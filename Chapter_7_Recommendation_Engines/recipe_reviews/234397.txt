I have made this lots of times, but, always in the oven.  The method is basically the same.  The only difference is that after I put the ingredients together in the baking pan, I COVER the pan with foil.  I didn't notice whether or not the posted recipe uses cooked or uncooked ravioli.  I use UNCOOKED ravioli.  The layers pretty much work the same way.....I like to add a little fresh mozzarella in between the layers so it has that gooey-ness of lasagna.  After I cover it, I bake it ABOUT 45 minutes to one hour at 350.

Yummy! Followed the recipe and it turned out fantastic. Love it when you don't have to read 15+ reviews with each one telling you a different way of altering the recipe. With this recipe you don't have any reviewers altering the recipe because there is no need to; It's great the way it is. Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe.

I used half ground beef/half ground sausage and a homemade marinara and I omitted the additional salt. I was able to put this together fairly quickly (and fairly cheaply as well because all of the ingredients were bought at Aldi!) at the start of my day and it was ready to go at dinnertime. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and add cheese in the layers as well as on top. I did sprinkle a good amount canned parmesan along with the shredded mozzerellla, too. The whole family enjoyed it, especially my two kids. We sopped up the additional sauce with white trash garlic bread (softened butter and lots of garlic powder, spread onto sandwich bread and thrown under the broiler). NO LEFTOVERS. Definitely a make again.

Used a 24-oz jar of Classico® Tomato and Basil sauce and a 12-oz container of my homemade marinara that I always keep on hand in the freezer.  I'll admit that I'm not a huge slow cooker fan, but this one won me over, and I definitely would make it again.  It really is a "no brainer," tastes pretty darn good, quick to get into the crock pot, and using a crock pot liner makes cleanup a breeze.  I think one or two links of Italian sausage cooked with the ground beef would be a good addition. The presentation may not be classic lasagna, but you definitely will think you're eating lasagna...those cheese raviolis really do the job!  RandyOSU you won me over!

This is a great recipe for this nights where you need to do something about dinner but can't be at home to cook it.  I keep cooked ground beef in my freezer so this was easy to pull together.  I followed the directions and the timing was too long and resulted in mushy pasta. I like to give a recipe a fair shot by not doing any changes the first time I make.  Next time I will cook for three hours and that will be plenty.  The kids gave it 2 thumbs up so we will be making this again.

This recipe is delicious.   The whole family loved it.  I did add frozen thawed spinach that I squeezed access water out of to the meat sauce.   I also substituted ground turkey in place of the beef.  Also put some shredded Italian cheese in between layers.  Turned out great.

Very good and VERY easy. I used 4 jars of pasta sauce and 30 ounces of raviloi. This does make a lot of food, but the leftovers should reheat well. I will be making this often.

I really like this recipe!! It just barely fit into my tiny crock pot (I'd recommend using a 6 qt if possible). I didn't thaw the ravioli first because I didn't have the time to, and it turned out fine. I also just add mozzarella to our plates after the lasagna is scooped out instead of putting it on top while still in the crock pot. It is super delicious reheated as well. This is one of my favorites and I probably will never make "real" lasagna again.

I usually make my ravioli in the oven but thought I would give this method a shot. Worked fantastic in my 5 quart slow cooker and was ready in 3 hours. I did let it set a little longer while photographing the dish for the site. But I advise eating at 3 hours. The longer it cooks the mushier it gets. I didn't use prepared pasta sauce but instead used a quart of home canned tomatoes, one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and 3 oz. tomato paste in its place. I also simmered my sauce about 1/2 hour to 45 minutes - just something I do when I make spaghetti sauce so I did so for this also. Worked great. I also layered the cheese in before cooking. It turned out nice and cheesy, the stringy kind of goodness! I admit I didn't have high hopes for this - never do with any slow cooker recipe. But this one didn't disappoint. This would be great for busy families that have after school activities. Just toss the ingredients in the cooker, run your errands or kiddos around and come home to a hot cooked meal waiting for you! For easy clean up use the slow cooker liners. They're great! What can be better than that after a busy day? Thanks for the keeper.

Fixed this for our homecoming pot luck meal.  It was great.the only thing I did different is add Italian cheese in the layers.  Cooked on low 4 hour added cheese 1 more hour.  Turned out as good as I hoped.

My family loved it. I did use ground turkey instead of beef. I also baked it in the oven on 350 for and hour instead of the crockpot. After adding the cheese, it baked another 30. Due to time, it was easier to change it.

Will most certainly make this again. I tweak it just a little. I mix ricotta cheese with the mozzarella and  make an extra layer and also add extra mushrooms. Top it with mozzarella and fresh Parmesan. It makes it very creamy. Abviously, not a low cal change!  But great for a special occasion.

Very easy to make and was delicious too! Preparing this ahead of time really made dinner time a breeze.  I just added a salad and some rolls and dinner was done. Thanks for a simple and yummy recipe!

Absolutely loved this.  Hubs has asked me to make it again.  I did use sausage instead of beef because that is all I had.  Still yummy!While I was making it I thought about doubling the recipe but this made just enough for dinner and leftovers.

This slow cooker lasagna was as good as any lasagna I’ve ever made. It pains me to say that. Am I anti-slow cooker? Am I a food snob? I don’t know, but I’m gonna re-evaluate my core beliefs. This recipe started in the grocery store. I’m standing there, looking at all the interesting fresh ravioli options, and I realize — I need to use frozen pasta (like the recipe directs) or else the ravioli probably turns to mush. So, I make my way to frozen foods. I never bought frozen pasta before, and I can’t find it. Then I realize, if I buy fresh ravioli and freeze it, it becomes frozen ravioli, right? Geez. So, I select some interesting fresh ravioli, stick it in the freezer, and get on with my life. I added onion and garlic to the sauce. I inserted layers of ricotta mixed with cooked, squeezed-dry spinach between the layers of ravioli, and cooked it on high for a little under 4 hours. Wow. I ask my husband, “Is this as good as any lasagna I slaved away for hours to make”? “Yep”. Okay,  confirmation. If you’re a little bit of a slow cooker snob,  I suggest you lower yourself to my level and give this recipe a try. Life can be a balancing act and this dish is proof that a short-cut is sometimes the most delicious way to get from one meal to the next with no sacrifice, and all gain.

I tried this recipe out on the seniors at church, thinking that it looked so simple they might fix it for themselves.  I think that idea was a success.  I got one request for the recipe.  The flavor is very good, but I will make a couple of changes on how I fixed it.  I used a five-quart round cooker, but the next time I will use the oval six-quart so I can spread it out more.  By doing this, the cheese will cover a larger space.  I'm also seriously thinking about putting some of the cheese between the two layers of ravioli and not so much on top.  I will NOT cook this for five hours again; in fact, I had a bit of burning on one side.

Absolutely delicious!  Made it with my own homemade spaghetti sauce, because I'm Italian and jarred sauce is not allowed in my house. ;)  The ravioli was frozen solid when I put it together in a baking dish, and it came out perfect, cooked at 350 degrees, for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  
Will definitely make again and again!  Buon Appetite!

Very easy to make and delicious!!!  When I make this again (and I will) I will not add the mozzarella cheese in the crockpot, but on the individual  plates.  Less mess that way.

I  doubled the amount  and the dish went in less than 30 minutes. I wasn't that sold on the form of it, but all-in-all the taste was fantastic. Next time I  make it , I will be adding more cheese in between layers.

This was super easy and tasted great.  Make sure you know your crock pot, however, as three hours on low for mine was almost too long.

The grandkids loved this! All 3 went back for more, and they're VERY picky. Will definitely be making it again. Just added peppers and onions when browning the meat, and a few of my own spices.

I used home  made spicy sage breakfast sausage and the family loved it.  I found it a littte on the dry side so next time I will use 2 jars of sauce as suggested in the Cook's notes.

I LOVE this recipe. I did add lots of fresh spinach and grated zucchini to it.  I could not find frozen ravioli so used fresh from the meat department and ground turkey instead of beef.

This was very good, but nothing like lasagna.  I would call this Randy's Slow Cooker Ravioli.  It is also easy to put together and a cinch to clean up if you use a crock pot liner.  Having leftovers for lunch.

I skipped the  frozen ravioli and layered  with a box of pre-cooked lasagna noodles. (Available in the dry pasta section at the super market.) Just add more sauce. I topped with more grated cheese before serving at the end. I garnished with a few slices of avocado ( optional) and dollop of sour cream on serving the plate .Great new twist.

I made without the ground beef, instead I cooked up a red, green bell pepper, and 8 ounces of mushrooms, and large sweet onion, a few garlic cloves in some olive oil and added that  into the sauce. I did layer some ricotta along with fresh spinach. It needed a bit more than four hours on low to fully cook, topped with mozzarella.  I'll try it again with ground beef, but will still include some of the veggies, they added great flavor.

Family didn't care for it. The ravioli came out a little gummy, so the consistency was unappealing. Perhaps if you shortened the cooking time it would come out better.

This is so good, and so filling! I cut the recipe in half, as it is just my spouse and I, and we still have some left over. 

I didn't make any other changes.
We'll definitely make this again soon!

The only change I made was not adding basil and Italian seasoning.  The sauces I chose were flavorful enough.  I should have used the cooking times from the recipe but I was too impatient and did 2 1/2 hours cooking and then 30 minutes with the cheese.  It was still wonderful though.

This was awful! It smelled delicious while cooking and the sauce was good. I cut the cooking time down as recommended but the ravioli was terrible. I can't say it was mushy but it was very paste like. I won't be making this again as it got a 2 thumbs DOWN from the family.

Made a vegetarian version using spinach and ricotta stuffed ravioli. I used a jar of basil tomato sauce and added chopped red pepper, chopped sun dried tomatoes  and chopped black olives. I layered in slices of fresh mozzarella . Delicious!

My family really enjoyed this.  It's simple to make.  A good slow cooker meal for summer.  I wasn't sure if it would be enough of the ravioli but it made plenty for a family of four with some left over.

One word: Amazing! While I was making it, I wondered how it would be any different than just making the ravioli with sauce. It blew my mind that it tasted just like homemade lasagna! I will be making this again and again!

I tried this because it sounded like something I could make, freeze in portions and reheat at work and it was. I did make a couple of changes. I used reduced sodium spaghetti sauce and added no salt to the recipe. I used mild Italian sausage. I layered in cheese in the middle , but didn't add it to the top because I wanted to add the cheese to each portion as I used them. It was very easy and tasty. I had people hovering over me at lunch asking me how I made it. Good recipe. Next time I will try spicy Italian sausage and throw in some fresh sliced mushrooms.

EASY GOOD  I over compensated
 with to much sauce 21/2 jars because I thought pasta would
soak it up. I will stick to 2 jars next time. I will also add cheese
between layers next time. I liked it. I will make again because
it is handy  and good. There are many times that this would be a great option for a meal.

Really good recipe. I might add a little water to the pot for the last hour next time. I served with homemade bread and a salad. Great!

My hubby liked it better than I did but he likes lasagna better than I do.   The sauce is a little meaty for me but it was a keeper recipe.  Quick and easy.  I did the Italian Shredded Cheese between layers as others suggested.  Next time I might use sausage or combo of beef & sausage.  I used 1 Bertolli Tomato Basil and 1 Classico Traditional Sweet Basil.  I cooked for 4 1/2 hours but think it could have been done in 3 - 3 1/2 hours.  Will make again.

Very good recipe. Very good quick substitute for lasagna noodles. I used meat ravioli instead of cheese and still very good and added few vegetables: carrots zucchini and peppers.

I made this and loved it! I used 1 jar of sauce and one can of tomato sauce because that's what I had, and I added some shredded cheddar because we like a lot of cheese. I'll definitely be making this again, possibly adding more garlic for additional flavor.

This had way to much seasoning in it. Couldn't get past all the oregano taste. Overall it is a great concept and I will make it again with out all the added seasonings. It was easy and cooked up well in the crock pot. I used half ground beef and half itlain sausage.

I followed the recipe but mine came out clumpy, not very tasty and not at all pleasing to look at. We ate it the first night, no one ate it the second night...I took it for a lunch and threw away the rest. Not sure where I went wrong with all these great reviews.

It was so good! Even better as a leftover, I think!
Although, I feel like it was less like a lasagna and more like a really good "chef boyardee" ravioli, but still a much make!!!

I haven't tried this recipe yet but by looking at it I might as well make as is & pop it in the oven for less time.
Why go to all that bother just to put it into a crock pot & let it cook for several more hours. Too much work for a crock pot dinner.

Ingenious. Loved this in the slow cooker.  Referencing many reviews, I added a layer of ricotta w/ 1/2c of chopped fresh spinach.   YUM! Never again will I make the more laborious lasagna that my family has been using for 5 decades.  This was better in every way.  I made 1/2 the recipe and cooked it for just 3 hours.  Along w/a salad, it fed 6 people.  Perfecto!

I added more meat and a little extra sauce.  It was a MAJOR hit with my brother  (who doesn't really like "lasagna" from a slow cooker). I've made several lasagnas and never had a hit like this. Thank you for sharing your recipe. It is a keeper in my books. I will also pass this recipe on to family and friends.

This was the Best and easiest pasta recipe that i have done from this site, I was going to grab pasta from a restaurant, but decided to look and on AR  since i have gotten so many recipes from here and i am so glad i did  (I did use a Cheese Blend - Mozzerella, provolone and parmesean between each layer)  ... you will not believe how good this is!!

I made this recipe as it instructs, except for some of the seasonings only because I didn’t have them available.  This was delicious and easy to make.  I made one for my adult children and grandchildren and they loved it.   Then, I made it again for my husband who doesn’t care for pasta dishes. He raved about it to our daughter and told me it was delicious.   It’s definitely a keeper

This was such an easy recipe! It was very delicious, but I would use less tomato sauce the next time, extra can be added at the plate if necessary. This will be my new lasagna method.

We enjoyed this but would use less ravioli next time as we felt it lacked sauce.  But great taste, texture, and filling!  We will add this to out monthly rotation of meals.

I loved this recipe essentially as is. I used 2 jars of sauce and am glad I did. I don’t think one is enough. And I just left out the bas because I don’t like basil. Everything else was the same. Super tasty and I will be making this again!

I did add Italian sausage & chopped onions to it the second time I made this and it was incredible. I also used Classico roasted garlic spaghetti sauce. Just make sure you thaw the ravioli first and it’s perfect.

After reading the reviews I made this in the oven. I also added about a quarter of a roll of sausage. Then topped it with cheese  too and it was a big time success! Love it!!

The ravioli I used came out extremely soft, almost mushy, but a good recipe when you don't have a lot of time to stand over the stove!

My family loved it.  I would say it didn't really seem like lasagna but a really meaty ravioli.  It was still really good and the family has requested it for me to make it again.

I made this in the oven, 350 for about 1 hour, covered for the first 45 minutes.  Used frozen ravioli.   I added ricotta and spinach between the layers.  Using 1 jar of sauce, I added a grated zucchini into the sauce just before layering otherwise it turns out too dry.  The zucchini gives the extra liquid the ravioli need to cook.  We liked it, just don't overcook.

I made this dish for my husband (who happens to love ravioli) and company we were having.  I used spinach and cheese ravioli because that’s what I had on hand. Came out very tasty and I would make it again.

Delicious! And so easy too throw together. I added 1 pound of mild Italian sausage to thicken the sauce (this was for the 12-serving recipe). Lots of compliments from my family!

Made this for the first time for our grandson and his family, and everyone loved it. His wife even went back for seconds, which is rare! The only thing I did differently was to use turkey burger instead of hamburger and added 2 cooked and cut up Sweet  Italian Turkey sausages. I also did as some other reviewers and added part of the mozzarella to the layers.  I used frozen ravioli and cooked on low for 3 hours, then added the remaining mozzarella on top and cooked for another 45 minutes. Will make this again, thanks for the recipe.

It comes out much better in the oven. I put it together the same way but tightly cover with foil. I don't defrost the ravioli. Bake at 350° for 45-60 minutes , adding the cheese to the top for the last 20-30 minutes.  I found it gets too messy in the crock pot but this way keeps it together.

We found it very tasty and certainly easier than “regular” lasagna. I reduced the pasta sauce to 1 1/2 jars, but next time I'll use two jars and increase the meat to 1 1/2 lbs.

I substituted ground beef for sweet Italian sausage. This doesn’t require a slow cooker. I baked it in the oven and it was ready in a fraction of the time it would otherwise take.

My family loved it, especially my brothers. I personally will most likely make some adjustments, but that's par for the course with recipes that include spaghetti sauce. I love cheese, and I think I'll be adding some in between the layers of raviolis, versus doing it without. All in all, it's an easy and tasty meal.

I added a little red pepper flakes because my family likes things spicy, but the general consensus was that it’s a little dry. Next time I will layer cheese with the meat  sauce and ravioli. Maybe cottage cheese or ricotta.

Used world best lasagna meat sauce from this site instead of jarred pasta sauce and meat from this recipe. Used about 36 oz ravioli and added mozzarella and Parmesan into the three layers of ravioli. My daughter loves it more then actual lasagna so guess what- will be making two crockpots next time and having lots to freeze for when I don’t have time to cook. I actually had to turn my setting to high since at two hours (several reviewers said it only needed 2 hours) on low (with the extra layers) mine was not done. I did throw extra fresh parsley in with the last layer of cheese for the last 30 minutes of cooking

Mostly followed the recipe, but added shredded mozzarella between each layer. Rather than cooking in a slow cooker, I poured into a 9”x13” casserole dish, covered with foil, and baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. It’s a keeper!

I've never reviewed any recipes on here before, but this one needs to be reviewed. I read through the recipe and decided that this sounded good. I had all of the ingredients so why not! First using Recipe Pro's scale down, I changed everything to serve 4 people. Next I cut the amount of hamburger down and added a proportionate  amount of Italian Sausage. From there I followed the instructions and VOILA! turned out one the best meals I've mad yet!

This was pretty good! I used ground sweet Italian sausage instead of beef because I prefer it. I also topped it with some shredded parm. Next time I will add more mozz, especially on top. Also, I cooked it in the oven instead of the slow cooker. Just pre-cook your ravioli, layer everything the same way in a deep baking dish, cover and bake until everything is thoroughly warmed, then uncover and bake until cheese on top is browned.

I love pasta and this was amazing. I did make minor changes. I did not put basil and oregano (wife hates oregano) but I used a sweet basil pasta source. After 3 hours and 15 minutes it was done. A real great recipe!!!

I made this exactly according to recipe except I didn’t use the whole 25 oz bag of ravioli, the ratio just wasn’t matching up for the amount of sauce. That’s ok, now I’ll just have extra frozen ravioli for another meal another day. Overall very easy to prepare and the outcome was delicious! I also suggest adding leafy greens to the meal so the overall vibe is less heavy and more healthy.

Since I have a small 1.5 quart oval slow cooker, it made it difficult to layer the ravioli with the sauce. But I should've made more sauce, since some  ravioli came out hard or dried, while the rest was good. It only took my cheese to melt three minutes to melt, since I didn't have to wait a full 45 minutes. I would have to cook it for less time and add more sauce, the next time I made it.

This was delicious and so easy to make.   My family loved it and gave it a 5 star rating.  I was a little worried there there was going to be too much seasoning but it came out perfect.  Using the 2 jars of sauce made the perfect amount of sauce. I will be making this again.

Excellent as is, very easy to make and always a hit in my house. I also make this using homemade Alfredo sauce, both cheese and beef ravioli, as well as using ground hot Italian sausage along with the ground beef. Try mixing in some Gruyere cheese  along with the mozzarella, for even more cheesy goodness.

My husband really liked it. I don't eat red meat so will try it with ground turkey breast next  time. I wanted to make it as the recipe stated. I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate their interpretation. My slow cooker cooks hot, so it was done at three hours. Cheese melted very quickly too. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a great base recipe!  I baked it in the oven, but that is the only thing I changed about the recipe.  The whole family loved it, and it reheats really well.  It is a super easy, super tasty way to cook "lasagna" without the mess and fuss.  The recipe itself  is easy to personalize, with different spices, types of ravioli and such.  Definitely a keeper!

I pretty much followed the recipe as I like to give it a try before making changes if needed, the only changes I made was to sprinkle the mozzarella in each layer also. I cooked mine for three hours before adding cheese  on top, as my crock pot cooks hot. So good and easy also. A definite keeper.

We really liked this dish and I will make it again.  I followed this recipe with one addition. I added a can of diced tomatoes to the sauce.  It did not taste so much like lasagne as it did saucy ravioli—still good.

This was very simple to make. I followed one of the other reviews and added cheese to the layers. The end result was delicious, but something seemed to be missing. I think I will try adding ricotta cheese the next time I make this dish.

Made it for a New Year's Eve party.  Everyone loved it.  I followed the advice of some of the reviews and only cooked for 3 hours on low and added layers of cheese after the layers of ravioli.  Will definitely make again.

Easy to fix, inexpensive, and good to eat.  If it were just me, I would give this four stars, but I award it five based on the recommendations of my grandkids.  They inhale this.  One even takes leftovers in his thermos to school for lunch.  I have fixed this numerous times.  Sometimes I use plain cheese ravioli; other times I use the cheese/spinach combo ravioli.  Always use store brand marinara sauce.  It will fit into a three quart slow cooker (it  will be tight though).

This was beyond delicious!!! I have a very large family, so used roughly 1.5x what the recipe called for, but cooked for same amount of time. The kids cleaned out the entire crockpot very, very quickly, they loved it! In addition to the spices mentioned above, I added some parsley flakes and cilantro, and also sprinkled in oregano, parsley and cilantro onto the cheese (we ran out of mozzarella, so I substituted Colby Jack cheese for that too). I will most definitely be making this for every potluck for the foreseen future!

We had a luncheon at work for Christmas and the theme was Italian. I followed the recipe and the suggestions to add cheese in between the layers.  I added Italian Cheese once and then Mozzarella once and kept adding like that between the layers.  This turned out so good and it had a lot of flavor.  There was not much left over.  I will make this again.  I cooked for about 3 hours and 1 hour at work the next day and it was fine.

I used the spinach and ricotta-stuffed fresh ravioli you can find in the dairy/butter aisle.  I baked it in the oven- the usual 45 minutes covered with foil, 15 minutes uncovered.  Absolutely delicious!

Extremely delicious even though I messed up a few things!  My crock pot's low setting is very hot.  I should have left it cooking for 3-4 hours instead of 6.  It definitely needed more sauce too. I used 1 jar of Barilla pasta sauce.  2 jars would have been perfect.  I chose Rana 5 cheese stuffed ravioli as the pasta and it was very good.  I am excited to make this again!

I went into this with low expectations thinking this would be just ravioli with meat sauce. somehow it works in the slow cooker and you can walk away and come back later. I like recipes where I don't have to buy a lot of ingredients that I hardly ever use. I already had everything in the kitchen

We used ground turkey instead of the beef and you couldn't even taste the difference. I even brought some into work with me and shared it with a Co worker and a patient who also Said you couldn't tell it was ground turkey. I will for sure be making this meal again.

This was so good. I only made changes because I was in a hurry and because I bought the wrong ravioli (meat instead of cheese). I had to bake in the oven instead of crockpot. Still it was amazing. I used ground turkey because that's what I had on hand. So easy to put together and easy to serve. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe!

Turned out great, very delicious.  I used an old 70's era crock pot that is tall and round.  A newer, bigger slow cooker would work better.  That way you could spread it out over a larger area.  I used 50/50 ground hamburger and mild Italian sausage.  Next time I would try layering with ricotta cheese.

I prepared this as per instructions, but baked in a 350 oven as another cook suggested.  Took about 1 hour and came out great.  My husband said to make this again, often.  It's so easy, I just might.

What a wonderful, hearty dish. Very easy to make. I added a pound of Sweet Italian Sausage with the ground beef and used fresh mozzarella in between the layers. Other than those additions kept everything the same. Turned out amazing. Will make again and again.

Having lasagna at Carrabba’s last week and boyfriend said “this is better than Olive Garden’s, but not as good as yours”!  (This is the recipe that I always use for lasagna now).  So good, yet so easy!

I enjoyed this recipe but don't see the need for the slow cooker. Next time I'll just bake it. I added onions to the ground beef but will also add celery and bell pepper next time. Bertolli marinara is the best sauce I have found so far. Will make again!

As I expected way too much sauce but I wanted to try it as written and my instincts said pasta should not be cooked in the crock pot.  It was okay but needs modifying which defeats the purpose of this recipe.

This was so simple to make and was a big hit! I made this for a ladies group and one was a vegetarian so I omitted the ground beef. Also had to throw together quickly and bake which was mentioned in other comments. Everyone loved it. I'll try it in my slow cooker another time when I'm not gone all day.

I made this but turned it vegan by changing the cheese ravioli to home made potato  gnocchi, eliminating the ground beef (you can add veggie crumbles), and changed the cheese to Soy  
Sation. Turned out great!

I'm always fearful of pasta in a slow cooker but this was great!  Followed exactly as written and the whole family loved it.  Can't wait for leftovers!

I made this recipe exactly as written using 2 jars of roasted garlic pasta sauce. Besides being so easy to make, it is delicious. The whole family enjoyed this and it will make a repeat performance. Thank you for sharing.

Great. Loved it. Modifications: Used miles buffalo wing sauce, added grilled onions, and chunks of cream cheese over the roasted potatoes. Shredded the cooked chicken on top and added corn and pees. Then the cheese. When served I shredded some greens over the top. The entire casserole was gone with just three people.

My daughter-in-law and I took our slow cookers on an extended family trip to the snow and made this for a crowd. It was so nice to come in after playing in the snow and have a warm, hearty, very tasty dinner ready to eat!

Very good!  I made it and it turned out awesome.  Only thing that I'd suggest, put more cheese on it and mix it in.

I followed the recipe exactly and it's perfect. I only cook for myself, and tend to cook large recipes that reheat well so I can have dinner for a week. This is perfect for those days when you don't feel like spending hours in the kitchen, and just want a delicious meal that lasts extremely well in the fridge. I've made this 3 times now and results are consistent. I recommend serving with some parmesan, crusty bread, and a salad.

While I enjoyed this, there's nothing really outstanding about the taste.  I already have a slow-cooker lasagna recipe that's just as good and not any harder to make (using oven-ready noodles), but this was fun to try and it turned out fine. The only change I made to the recipe was to use reduced fat cheese, which I put within the layers because it melts better that way.  I have to say, though, my hubby raved about this and would probably give it 5 stars (and he doesn't even really like Italian food that much), so we'll be having this again I'm sure.

Not the greatest, not the worst. I followed the recipe as written (I do that the first time I make something), but I don't want to make this one again and tweak it. It was too mushy, and I don't know how to fix that other than not using the slow cooker. Decent taste, though, and certainly easy to make.

This was so yummy. It's guaranteed that I'll be making it again. I messed up & bought tortellini instead of ravioli, too. So, subbing tortellini is no problem.

This is very tasty, though not quite as good as traditional time-consuming lasagna. The only change I made was to divide the mozzarella cheese and put half on the first layer and the other half on top. It's really easy to put together, and goes great with green beans and toasted italian bread.

I liked the recipe  made as is but, I will add less sauce next time. I  also might add some ricotta as my family said not enough cheese flavor for them. I will make again.

Made it and it was a success!! Only change is that I added spinach ravioli stuffed with asparagus to make it a little healthier. I also sautéed the meat with bell peppers and onions to give more flavor.

It's got A LOT of garlic in it. I loved it and I will make it again, but I will leave out the garlic powder. There is plenty of fresh garlic in the recipe  and it could do without the powder! Still, easy prep and so yummy!

Used 12 oz. soy crumbles, 32 oz. pasta sauce, 25 oz. cheese ravioli, 1 1/2 c shredded mozzarella.  Same spices and cooking time as recipe says.  Makes 6 servings at 397 calories per serving.

This is a very good recipe. It's easy and I will most likely make it again. A high quality marinara will make all the difference here! I used Italian seasoned ground turkey so there was nothing to drain, and the extra spice was very good.
One thing I will change next time though - I had to use Buitoni ravioli, which soaked up a ton of the sauce. The end result was a bit dry. If I have to use ravioli that will expand like that next time, I will add a cup or so of water to the sauce.

This was a hit with my family! And myself! I used more seasoning than it called for since I'm big on flavour.  I did it in the oven in a casserole dish. Will definitely be making it again.

This was okay. I made it with roasted garlic sausage instead of ground beef. It was a little too "wet" for my taste-too much sauce, too much cheese. 
It was an easy recipe, and excellent, if you need something to be waiting for you after work. I'd just rather put a little more work into it, and come out with something Spectacular, not just Okay.

I made it almost exactly as written.  I used only garlic powder and Italian seasoning and added the seasonings when i was browning the ground beef.  I used a little more ravioli than it called for, so it was 3 full layers in the slow cooker.  I sprinkled the cheese between the layers and topped it off with the cheese from the beginning of cooking.  Cooked on low 3 hours.  This was for a potluck at work so it was made the night before with frozen ravioli.  Tasted delicious and I received compliments from everyone.  This is a keeper.  I am making it again this weekend for football Sunday!

Made two slight changes. Browned beef, drained then added spices and such. Didn't make sense to add stuff to the beef then drain it and loose most of the stuff you added with the fat. Next, I layered the mozzarella in with the sauce and ravioli just like you would if making it the old fashion way. That way it serves just like normal, not like a bunch of cheese ravioli in meat sauce.

Excellent - 2 jars of sauce seemed like a lot, but was perfect. I used 1 lb. italian sausage and 1/2 lb ground beef.  Spices were perfect and I added a dash of crushed red pepper.  The cheese ravioli were so yummy, along with layering the italian cheese as others recommended.  4 hours on Low setting was perfect!

Loved the stringy melted mozzarella cheese on top, and how the raviolis retained their shape! Everyone enjoyed this dish. I feel it was a bit too saucy; I may try 1 jar of pasta sauce next time.

Fantastic.  The teenagers couldn't get enough.  I did add fresh basil from the herb garden and used sweet Italian sausage for an authentic touch.  Great for a prepare in the evening and cook during the work day meal.

Would give it 10 stars if I could!  Easy freezer dinner.   It is a great meal for when you have to feed a family at different times. Put it on just after school and everyone can eat when they get home, since nobody gets home at the same time!  It stays well in the crock pot on warm.  Made in 6qt pot with two 13oz bags of frozen cheese ravioli, 2lbs of ground beef and homemade sauce. Layered sauce, meat , frozen ravioli finishing with sauce on top. Added the cheese after cooking  2 hours on low. Put on warm after 3 hrs.   Did not change seasonings. Everything one enjoyed it. Thx Randy!

Very good. Made it just as instructed. I have a 6qt crockpot and let it cook for 3 hours. I put it on warm, sprinkled with cheese and let it melt for about 15 minutes.  Will definitely make it again.

Very good and easy.  Used Italian sausage instead of ground beef.

I will definitely make it again. I used double the ravioli, and double the ground beef to make a larger batch. Next time I will do the same, but will use 3 cans of pasta sauce.  I used just 2 this time, and it needed the extra moisture. I didn't have any because I don't eat meat, but it was for a party, and everyone there gave it a big thumbs up. If I make it for myself,  I will still do the same and use veggi crumbles instead of ground beef.

A good comfort food dinner.  Husband is a meat eater, so we doubled the meat and seasonings.  Delicious.

Was kind of wishing it would fit in my 3.5 quart casserole crock pot but 5 or 6 quart  one needed.  Definitely use a liner.  As per others, sprinkled a bit of mozza between the layers.  The Costco I went to didn't have frozen ravioli much less fresh ravioli.  So I used fresh tortellini and it worked out fine.  3.5 hrs total cooking time and stayed hot while I took it to a potluck.  Thinning the sauce with perhaps 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup of water wouldn't come amiss.

This recipe is so-o-o-o-o welcomed.   Ravioli Lasagna has been offered by COSTCO  in their ready-to-pop-in-the-oven meal pack for quite awhile.  Now I MYSELF can make it due to your sharing of the recipe.  Thanks so much!

I made this today and it was delicious!  I followed recipe exactly except for the amount of the frozen cheese ravioli.  My store didn't have the 25 oz package only a 32 oz. package, so that is what I used.  It came out really good; it took 3 hours on Low and about 30 more minutes longer after I put in the mozzarella.  It was very cheesy and good; I served it with a side spinach salad.  I will try it in the oven the next time, as someone else had suggested, and i'm sure it will be good that way too.  Thanks for submitting this recipe, I will definetly make it again!

I used sauce from a jar and if I had used my own homemade sauce it would have been perfect.  Loved it and it was so easy.  
Had it for the young missionaries from the church and it was all eaten.  Will make it again.

This recipe as written is very easy and delicious.  Because we love cheese, we added layers of mozzarella and ricotta cheese alternating with the meat sauce layer. It was VERY cheesy!!!  LOL We also added chopped onions to the meat sauce cuz we like onions, too.

This was very good. I used ground turkey and baked it instead of using the slow cooker, but when I have more time, I will try it that way. Yum!

I was having company for dinner and didn't want to turn on the oven as it was in the triple digits outside.  I happened to have some fresh packaged Ravioli from the deli and thought it would be a perfect time to try out this recipe.   It didn't disappoint.  It turned out delicious!  I made it as stated on the directions except I used the fresh ravioli rather than frozen.  It worked perfectly.  The guests really enjoyed it and requested  the recipe.  I plan to use this recipe when we have potlucks at church.   It is the perfect take along dish!

My husband and I really liked this recipe and made it just like it is.  However I made it in my Instant Pot.  Seared the meat first then added the remaining ingredients, cooked it on manual for 10 minutes and voila!  Turned out perfect!

I loved this! I will now make this INSTEAD of lasagna. Followed recipe as written, except baked it as another reviewer suggested. Wasn't sure whether to use the ravioli frozen or not, so I cooked it as directed on package, assembled it as the recipe suggested and baked at 350 degrees for approximately 30 minutes until heated through and the cheese melted. Thanks for posting!

It turned out ok for first time cooking it. Really need to use 2 jars of sauce in the beginning. Think I may try fresh ravioli next day. Thanks

OK...I'll confess right up front - I haven't made this yet and  my Italian heritage almost kept me from even looking at the recipe.  I'm glad I did though.  I'll get some Mama Toscano's ravioli the next time I'm down on The Hill (before PC it as called Dago Hill) and make this, substituting spicy Italian sausage for the ground beef.  Now THAT sounds to me like a WINNER!

It is quick and easy to make    Very filling.  I make this quite often -with and without the ground beef. Add a salad and bread sticks and you have a meal that satisfies a teenager appetite.

This is the perfect potluck dish.  I use Italian sausage instead of ground beef and Classico Marinara (or other non-meat kind, 4 cheese is great).  I put it together the night before and refrigerate the container.  Then I heat on high once I get to the office.  That will ensure 3 hours on high.  It turns out great and all the "young kids" at work think I really know how to cook.  Then I share the recipe and the secret's out.

I made it according to the recipe and it was just all right. The ravioli turned  out kind of mushy and it just wasn't the same without the layer of ricotta.

An even easier dish: google Ravioli Lasagne,  the four ingredient recipe for the oven. Add extra half jar of sauce. Delicious and unbelievably easy!

A great shortcut!

 Here's a Nifty trick : instead of a lasagna casserole, use large square ravioli and your usual rectangular lasagna pan. The result is practically precut lasagna square s.

Followed recipe exactly-- but did add an additional 24 oz. Jar of pasta sauce. Cooked on low for 4 hours, and added cheese to cook for an additional hour. Was terrific. Even my picky eater asked for seconds.

This was a fabulous and easy recipe.  Follow it exactly! It was done in 3.5 hrs.  I think 5 hrs is too much.  I made it for 40 servings/people in a roaster oven (set at 200 degrees) for 3.5 hrs , set cheese on top, and then set for another 45 minutes.  Keep it on warm mode (150 deg) until ready to serve.  Beautiful!  Definitely grease the pan first for easy cleaning.

My son made this and substituted Italian Sausage for the ground beef. He also added a cup of cottage cheese when layering the ingredients. Everyone loved it, including the kids!

Just made this for dinner, and the family loved it! I didn't feel like digging out my crock-pot, so I made it in the oven. I used sausage instead of ground beef, because it's what I had on hand. Layered everything, just like in the recipe, covered with foil, and baked for 45 minutes at 350. I used a mix of shredded Italian blend and mozzarella between the layers. Served it with salad of mixed greens, and cheddar biscuits. Will definitely be making this again!

Use Garlic Powder and Italian Seasoning only for the meat, only used on jar of pasta sauce and cooked for 3 hours and it turned out wonderful. Kept the ravioli frozen, and added the shredded cheese in between the layers of meat and ravioli. I think we'll add ricotta next time to make it seem even more like ravioli!

If I could give this 10 stars I would! I was very surprised how good this is! I work 9-5 so it was on much longer than advised and that was a concern but no problem! I used my slow cooker on a base not my croc-pot, I can control the temp better  and it was on very low. I added small scoops of ricotta and I had some fresh mozz that I also added. It even cut easily into squares. Will be making this again!

I had a onion to the meat sauce, but other wise I did like what it called for.  On one of the reviews they said for it to cook for three hours I would say that was a great idea.

I added a pound of Italian  sausage which thickened up the sauce nicely.  Otherwise  followed instructions  as written.  I will make it again.  I could see adding the multi Italian cheeses in between the layers.   Would be a good potluck dish if you have a large   crockpot and and have fewer layers.
