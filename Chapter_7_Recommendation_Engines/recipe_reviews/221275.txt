I used Martha White strawberry muffin mix in this recipe and "soured" milk. I used a little less berries only because I only had about a cup of chopped fresh strawberries. The kids LOVED this breakfast, especially my youngest boy. This was a great way for me to get him to eat as he's always been a little finicky in the mornings. Today, I did not have one issue. He ate his and asked for seconds.

These were a nice change from ordinary pancakes topped with syrup.  I made them a little larger than 1/4 cup because I wanted to be sure there was enough room for the filling; ended up with 6.  The banana-nut flavor really shines through and is worth the price of a package of muffin mix.  We ate them with our hands, like a taco, and they really don't have to be hot to be enjoyed either.  And they include some of my favorite food, yogurt and fresh berries.

We did have to adapt the recipe a bit as I was out of yogurt. I made a cream cheese mixture of cream cheese, sugar and vanilla instead of the yogurt and I used buttermilk pancake mix as I was out of muffin mix. I did use strawberries and bluberries. My son was excited when he saw whst he called pancake tacos, and there were no leftovers.  I can't wait to try this recipe ss is.
