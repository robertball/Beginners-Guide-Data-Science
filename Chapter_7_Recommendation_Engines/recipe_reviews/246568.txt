I read the recipe and, since I only had 4 small potatoes, decided to: (1) combine the ingredients in an oven bag, plus chopped cilantro and shreaded carrots; then (2) add 2 chicken thighs to the bag, (3) shake it and (4) bake it for 90 minutes. (I put them in the oven at 3:10, then went shopping and returned by 4:30 - it It was probably ready earlier.)  I plan to bake this again with the right amount of potatoes and at least 2 more thighs. DELICIOUS!

Nice mild flavor, but next time I'll cut the potatoes in even smaller pieces to make sure every bite is flavorful.  I didn't have scallions when I made this so will try again.  Cayenne adds just enough "zing" without being overpowering.

After parboiling the potatoes, I tossed them in a bowl with the mix and let them sit for close to ½ an hour. There were no green onions, so I substituted minced onion. Then I tossed them in the airfryer at 180º for 14 minutes, until they were browned the way I wanted them. They tasted good but I think they’re missing something, so next time will try adding a bit of rosemary to the mix.

Messy beyond belief; not enough flavor and I added a bunch of additional honey and mustard.  Will not make again.

I couldn't taste the honey -mustard at all. I was a little disappointed. I made this for Christmas dinner and was super excited to serve it to my guests.

I used the 3Tbsp EVOO, 3 Tbsp Sabrette Mustard, 1 Tbsp & 2 tsp regular honey, 1 tsp Mikes Hot Honey, only 1/4 tsp salt, a pinch of cayenne, 1/8 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp dried chives. In place of the green onions, I minced up 1/3 cup of yellow onion. The adaptation recipe came out just great and I was happy that it had a little less sodium than the original recipe.

We loved these for the taste and how simple they are to make. I did add some minced garlic and used a white onion instead (it’s what I had). I also used whole grain mustard.

Thank You for submitting this recipe. With the exception of cutting the recipe in half, the cook time and ingredients are way off.

My husband couldn't stop raving about this.  Besides the potatoes, I used this on boneless chicken thighs that I pre-browned on the stove top and then put in the oven with the potatoes.  Very easy and very good.

I didn't have red potatoes on hand so I used russets. I followed the recipe as is.  The fambam loved it! I will definitely make it again.
