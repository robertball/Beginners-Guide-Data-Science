This is very good!  The steak was very tender.  Instead of cooking it on the stovetop, after browning on both sides in an ovenproof pan, I baked (covered with foil) them for 2 hours at 325 degrees. Very tender!

I was so surprised at how good (and easy)this recipe was!  I've always dredged cube steak in flour, salt and pepper and pan fried.  This made the meat much more tender and the gravy on mashed potatoes was awesome.  Served with fresh green beans and corn for a wonderful meal, enjoyed by both hubby and 9 year old son.  Oh, I did add onion and mushrooms to gravy just because I love them.

I was a little skeptical of this recipe due to the short ingredient list, but it was great! The steak was tender and had a great flavor. I didn't have any bouillon, so I just skipped the water and used beef broth. I will definitely be making this again.

I was the hero of the night with this simple recipe.  The only change I made was adding one big onion cut in rings.  The steaks were so tender you could cut them with the fork and the gravy was great.

Awesome! I added a little garlic powder to the flour and browned in the pan. Then I put them in the crock pot with some beef broth and chopped onion and minced garlic. it made good gravy too (just added a little milk and flour). Cooked on low for 4 hours or so

Excellent!  I've made cubed steak a thousand times but following this recipe and simmering for a couple hours turned this into a family fave!  It was extremely tender and the gravy was delicious over rice.  I couldn't believe the amount of raves I got throughout the meal ~ Thanks so much for this recipe!

Excellent! The picture doesn't look too appetizing, but I tried it anyway, and am I glad I did! These turned out tender, not chewy, and the gravy made from the drippings was some of the best I've ever had.. Seriously! :)

I give this five stars before even trying it.  Why?  I love cube steak, always have, we have it once or twice a month pan fried.  Now I cook for my mother in law five times a week and she likes her food very tender.  I KNOW I will love this because it's exactly like my pan fried recipe, only difference is the slow baked simmering.  I wanted a recipe to make the meat tender like old fashioned Swiss Steak, one of my mother in laws favorite dishes.  I don't enjoy pounding the round steak before slow cooking Swiss Steak for a couple of hours.  Now I see I can take my mother in laws Swiss Steak recipe and adapt it to cube steak.  Now I have a way to fix tender meat in one of her favorite meals and one of mine.  Thanks for sharing.  Simplicity is something to celebrate!  *  Well, now it's nine hours later and I stand by my Five Star review.  I kept getting comments all during the meal saying, "This is really good."  One of my sons said, "I think I like this better than pan fried cube steak."  The meat was fall apart tender.  I put one can cream of mushroom soup, 3 cans water, one tsp minced garlic, and five bullion cubes in a bowl, stirred together and set aside.   I browned 10 cube steaks as described in recipe, then sliced 2 small onions. I layered the meat in a dutch oven, spread onions over the top of the meat poured the wet mixture to cover it all, baked covered in 275 degree oven four hours, served over rice with a warm roll and a side of steamed carrots and parsley flakes.

Inexpensive way to make a cheap cut of meat very tasty and tender.  I have a similar recipe "smothered steak" which is more complicated and calls for cream soups, but I preferred the ease of this one.  I did add thinly sliced white onion on top of the steaks as they simmered.

I love this recipe!  Our family does not really enjoy beef that much, but this recipe is one that they love.  It is truly a 5 star recipe.  After making it a few times, I have changed it somewhat, but will not bother to post the changes, as I really find it annoying  when people do this, and then post on how their changes made it a "Real 5 star recipe".  Thank you so much for one of the best recipes that I have come across on here.

I grew up with my mom making this recipe all the time.  Only thing different is that she added about 5 whole allspice while the steaks were simmering, removing them before making the gravy.

Surprised I hadn't reviewed this before.  We LOVE this recipe.  I used beef broth added a whole onion separated into rings and a can of mushrooms with their juice.  I use my electric frypan and cook the 2 hours on low.  It is fork tender and delicious.  Of course I add all kinds of extra spices to the flour.  To me that is just common sense if you want more flavor.   Thanks gerhart.

Great recipe.  I made it last night, awesome.  Incredible that with so little ingredients it turns sooo good, so much flavor.

Since I am a working mother with no time, I made it in the pressure cooker: after browning the floured steaks (as the recipe calls) I added the water (1 1/2 cup), buillon and cover it.  Pressure for 15 minutes.  Then placed steaks in a plate.  To make the sauce I added to the pot 1/2 cup of milk, 1 tsp flour (remember there is left over flour in the pan), 1 tsp butter and pepper to taste.  No salt!.  Stir and let cook until the sauce thickens.  Add on top of the steaks.  Does not need anything else!! But if you like you can add mushrooms to the sauce.

Enjoy this "working-mom-with-no-time version"

Cube steak can be an inexpensive way to prepare.  It has been tenderized prior to cooking and needs only a minimum time cooking to absorb flavorings and tenderizing.  I suggest following the recipe but reduce the cooking times to about 30 min.  Suggest making wine reduction sauce:  brown floured meat in oil; remove from pan; add 1 c. beef broth, scaping pan of flavor filled juices left in pan.  Add 1/4 c. red wine (no more) to broth; slow simmer until liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally.  Return cube steaks to sauce & simmer 20 minutes, slowly.  Add more broth if needed.  Do not add more wine; it will overpower the broth.  Makes a wonderful sauce without that heavy gravy taste or extra calories.  Enjoy!

This is a great recipe for a low cost 'steak' meal. I hate when people rate recipes and say they changed things but I am guilty this time. I simply used beef broth instead of water and it makes the recipe out of this world! You get such a tender meaty taste. This recipe was a starting off point for me on new things I have created. I have cooked other meats in similar ways and they always turn out to be tender and delicious. This is one of those recipes you can add veggies to and it will only enhance the flavor. Its great on its own and easily customizable which is awesome.

Thanks for sharing a great recipe. I did follow some of the other reviewers by adding garlic, onions, mushrooms, and then baking. I didn't have any beef bouillon or beef broth but I did have a packet of gravy mix so I added that and it worked! Served with mash poatotes and green beans! Delicious! Husband asked for a knife but he found out he didn't need it! The meat was fork tender!

We're not big beef eaters, but I was at the butcher a few months back and saw the cube steaks in the case and got 4. Found them in the freezer last night and wondered what to do with them. Really glad I found this recipe. I floured (garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper in flour), browned in a few Tbsp of oil, splashed each with Worcestershire, threw in about 1/2 a sweet onion chopped, and 2 cups of boiling water with 2 beef bullion cubes. Covered on cook top for about 1 1/2 hrs on low. It was really good. The gravy wasn't that thick but had little bits of the onions and stray beef pieces and was fine over the meat and mashed potatoes. Miserably full as I type this as there are only 2 of us and no leftovers. Thanks for the recipe.

It turned out fork tender.  The first time ever I've made cube steak fork tender.  I did as some other reviewers suggested, used beef broth instead of water/bouillon and added onions.  Wonderful recipe!  Thank you for posting!

I liked this.  My family didn't seem to like it as much but I say tough.  :)  The gravy was very watery and needed to be re-boiled on the stove with some cornstarch.  Lots of salt and pepper was added but overall great flavor! Being from the south we typically eat this deeper fried with peppered milk gravy so this was a nice change of pace.  My skillet couldn't hold all of them so I did oven bake after browning (325 for 2 hrs).  Thank you for the recipe!

Great, easy recipe.  Had cube steaks that I did not know what to do with.  My husband, who is usually not a big steak fan, let alone cube steaks, loved it.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup with some water, instead of water/buillion mixture.  Made a lovely gravy/sauce that went well with the steak & mashed sweat potatoes.

This was one of the most awful things I have ever made in my life -  simmering them for 2 hours like that made them extremely dry - to the point that my husband wouldn't even eat them, and he has NEVER turned away food.   I only made this recipe because of the high ratings it got and I still can't believe the result.  So disappointing.

I am new to cooking and rely on receipes to inform me of what I need to know. I followed receipes to a tee and watched it very closely for the first hour and then noticed that all of the water had evaporated and still had another hour to go! I rechecked the receipe and didn't read anywhere that you would need to add water to ensure they didn't burn up but added another two cups of water anyway hoping the steaks would turn out anyway. I walked away for 15 mins knowing I had to simmer for another hour and already added double the water the receipe called for and when I came back they were burnt. Me being a starving single mother did find a couple bites to salvage and it was very salty tasting. Completely unedible!

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I was very surprised at how flavorful the gravy was.  This is definitely a great substitute for country fried steak.

My husband and I have been trying to perfect the art of making cube steaks this way.  We were so pleased with this recipe, finally it was tender and juicy and not chewy!  I took advice from past reviews and added mushrooms, diced white onion and garlic to the sauce. And I covered a casserole pan with tinfoil and baked it in the oven at 325 degrees for 2 hours.

I have really enjoyed this recipe. Its very simple and taste great. I normally dont change the recipe but this one was just dying to have an onion added. I was so hungry I only cooked it for 1.5 hours and it was still tender enough to eat with a fork.

This was excellent!  My husband declared it one of the best things I've ever made, and used the phrase "restaurant-quality".   I made a couple modifications.  I drained all but about 2 tsp. of oil after browning the meat, then added a Tbs of garlic and some sliced onions to the pan.  Used a can of beef consomme instead of the bouillon granules, and about half a can of water.  Followed the rest of the recipe to a T; made gravy out of the liquids using a heaping spoonful of flour and a couple splashes of milk.  Served over rice, but I think next time I'll do egg noodles.

Very good, however like many other cooks, I added chopped onion, garlic and mushrooms to the "sauce" ... 
I also added red wine (cheap burgundy) for part of the water ... 
Lastly, I stirred in a bit of Kitchen Bouquet" to darken the slightly pinkish (from wine) sauce

This is wonderful and easy to do.  I love to saute some Vidalia onions and place on top the last 1/2 hour of cooking.  Place over rice and this is one great meal.

I was looking for something different, but this was entirely disappointing. Simmering took all the flavor out of the steak, and all you could taste was the bouillon. Next time I have cube steak, I'll stick to a quick dredge and pan fry.

Wonderful. I used salt, pepper and garlic powder. I doubled the recipe. I used 1 tsp. beef bouillon granules and 1 package on onion soup mix in 2 cups of water. I put them in a 9x13 casserole dish and poured the mixture over and baked covered at 325 for 2 hours. They were the most tender I've ever had.

This recipe was so good and also easy to make. I made it exactly as stated but also added some carmelized onions to it after simmering. I served it with mashed potatoes and 'Mushrooms with Soy Sauce Glaze' (from this website) and green beans. Perfect comfort food I will definitely be making again.

PERFECT!!  I read all the wonderful reviews and was still somewht unconvinced that so many could be so right!!  I'm a believer!  This recipe will become a staple in my dinner repertoire.  Followed the recipe but was wondering what to do with all the oil after frying the meat.  I did take some of it out cuz it just seemed to be alot to leave in.  I had some leftover beef broth from another recipe and wanted to use it up so I added that along with a sliced onion as others recommended.  I also added garlic powder to the flour before dredging the meat. To the cold beef broth, however, I did add the remaining flour from dredging the meat and used the wire whisk to remove the lumps.  I added this roux to the meat and onions.  The smell was scrumptious and the meat was amazingly tender.  The onion gravy was fabulous.  I have already forwarded this recipe to my sisters!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I've never made cube steaks before, and I have to say I thought they had a weird texture.  Other than that, which is not the fault of the recipe, it was a fairly good dish.  I did saute some onion in the oil after browning the steaks.  I also drained off as much oil as I could before adding the water.  The steaks were fork-tender, and the gravy was good on mashed potatoes.

I tried this recipe exactly as was given and found that I needed to check it every 1/2 hr to add more water/broth.  However, both my husband and I enjoyed this so much more than the cube steaks I had prepared in the past.  Will definately cook them this way in the future!

To make GLUTEN FREE I used Argo cornstarch in place of the flour, and Herbox beef boullion cubes (3), and added garlic. Due to lack of time, I simmered mine with the lid on for 1 hour, and than added water with cornstarch to thicken to make the gravey for 10 more minutes. Very good and easy. The steak was tender after 1 hour of cooking. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I covered the meat in beef broth rather than water and bouillon.  I thought medium high was too high to heat the oil, but I followed the recipe and the steaks burned/stuck to the pan on the first side.  I turned the heat down, and turned them over and the other side turned out fine.  Then when I simmered them, the flour crust on steaks turned to mush and hung off the meat in strings.  It was very unappetizing.  We ate it, because I didn't have anything else in the house, and the meat tasted fine, but the flour crust ended up as mushy globs throughout the sauce.  I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.

I have to say that this was extremely tasty!! as simply as it was I would have to say it was better than what I would have made!!! The family loved it, even my very picky eater who eats nothing except chicken!! (homemade chicken strips) so I will be sure to make this again! Thanks for sharing!!! p.s. the meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork!

Fantastic recipe, just like Mom used to make. I mix some cornstarch and water in a glass and add it to the drippings to make gravy. It doesn't dull the flavor as much as using flour does.

Excellent recipe, my BF loved it!  I used steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper, gave it an extra kick.  I also only had to simmer for an hour.  Added corn starch at the end to thicken the gravy and served over rice.

My  mom made this a lot, too. But, we saute onions and peppers first, removed from the pan, did the meat, and then added it all together.  Put the gravy  over rice. Great comfort meal.

This recipe was super easy to make and absolutely delicious! The steaks were SO tender. The recipe sounded a tad bland, so I added a tsp of garlic powder to the flour and small onion and a can of mushrooms to the simmering juice which added some extra flavor.

Didn't have cube steaks so substituted chopped beef steaks following same procedure of flouring and seasoning. Then made gravy with some of the drippings adding 1 tsp. Wyler's Beef Shakers Seasoning.

Only reason I gave this 4 stars, is because this is almost exactly how I have made this for years, with a little twist.  After I have browned steaks and have added (beef broth), I then add a thin sliced onion, and fresh sliced mushrooms.  Then cook down in gravy.  This is for people who like onions and shrooms of course.  All in all a good recipe as described above!

OK, so I find this SIMPLE recipe to finally use up the cube steaks that have been in our freezer for awhile.  They were purchased from a local natural beef farm.  I followed the recipe to a "T", adding some fresh onion and mushroom slices as others had suggested.  I was concerned, after frying the meat, that I should discard some of the remaining oil in the pan.  There seemed to be quite a bit. But, since the recipe didn't suggest that, I didn't do it.  ONE HOUR into the cooking time (I had it on 3, which I would consider MEDIUM-LOW as the recipe states), I could smell something burning while I was upstairs on the computer.   I raced downstairs and you can imagine my unhappiness as I took the lid off of the pan to reveal a total burnt-up mess in the bottom of the pan.  All of the meat is completely stuck in this thick, black STUFF on the bottom of the pan.  Oddly enough, there is still liquid in the pan - it appears to be the oil though.  I honestly don't know how I will ever clean out the pan, and I cannot figure out what it is that is so thick in the bottom of this pan - fat? burnt oil?  Don't know.  What I do know is that my meal is ruined.  I would HIGHLY suggest making this in a crock pot, or literally putting  the burner on LOW for this recipe.  And in case you are wondering, yes, I had VIRTUALLY COVERED the meat with Beef Broth (as opposed to just using water) as instructed in the recipe.   Aggrevating, because this local meat was not cheap!

The kids loved this especially the gravy it made they put it on their potatos and dipped their meat in it.  I did add a couple pealed cloves of garlic and some thyme both whole while it simmered.  Very nice taste.

Ok. I made this last night for dinner and my husband raved on and on. Lol...He says I can make this 3 times a week if I want to, it's so good.  Now, I did, and didn't, follow the recipe. Let me explain.  I didn't have bouillon in any form. So, I improvised. Here's what I did. I omitted the salt pepper on the steak and I seasoned the cube steaks with Mrs. Dash Onion and Herb seasoning. I pressed it into the meat,  on both sides.  Then, I pressed the cube steaks into the flour, both sides. I sprayed my skillet with a non stick spray,then I added just a little bit of the oil into the pan. I got the pan hot. Then I placed the meat into the pan and fried them until crispy, on both sides. I removed them from the pan. I did this 2 twice, because I was cooking 5 large cube steaks that were too big to fit into my skillet at one time. Anyway, I sauteed a whole onion. Then I added 4 cups of low sodium beef broth. Then, I added 2 envelopes of Lipton Onion Soup Mix. Mixed it well. Then I placed all 5 cube steaks into the pan and put a lid on and just let it simmer for 2 hours.  It came out so tender and so awesome and with great flavor. Had the perfect amount of gravy.  I noticed in some reviews, they ran short, but I was doubling the amount of meat I was cooking anyway and I knew we'd like the gravy. **Note: omitting the salt is a good idea when using a soup mix as they are very high in sodium. Otherwise, it could come out very salty. Oh, I served this over Basmati Rice and a veggie.

Holy lamas. Made this tonight and served it over rice and stir fry veggies for those of us that eat them. Hubby's review..."Best Ever".. I did use 4 bullion cubes and baked at 325 in my iron skillet covered for 2 hours instead of leaving it on the stove. These were fall apart, cut with a fork tender. Found my new way of making them. Freaking epic good!!

I did this recipe with my modifications ter I browned the steaks & I really liked it. After I browned the steaks I removed them from the pan & flash sauteed mushrooms & onions in the oil & juices with a dash of browning seasoning.Then I returned the steaks to the pan & added beef stock with some salt, pepper & Worcestershire sauce. I had to thicken the sauce a little but it came out great & flavorful!

I made this tonight for tomorrow's dinner, but I found it also a little bland as some have said because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out following the recipe. I understand that everyone has their specific tastes and if you want flavorful meat, you have to add your own spices, so along with the onions, I added a tiny bit more salt, pepper, montreal steak seasoning, garlic and onion powder to the beef broth, stuck it back in the oven at 325 for 45 mins more, and I say it's pretty tasty now (at least to me). Hope my family enjoys it, but I will def make again with all the seasonings from the beginning to see if that makes a difference. And yes it is VERY tender. Happy cooking!!

This is my husband's favorite meal (and I make a lot of different ones!). He's always asking when we're going to have the cube steak. I even put in a special request through our meat CSA so I get cube steak on a regular rotation just so I can make this! The only thing I do different is after browning the meat, take it out and add a sliced onion for about 5 minutes. (It picks up any yummy brown bits while cooking too!) Take the onion out, add the meat and broth, then pile the onions on top and let it cook. We're having it for dinner again tomorrow!

OMG This is SOOO good. And now I feel like I've been wasting my time cooking cube steak any other way. How EASY. My husband, a home grown picky eater, ate three servings and was dissappointed when there were no leftovers. My Mom was so complimentary (not an oft occurence).  Really going to be a go -to recipe for me. Love everything about it.
I DID deglaze the pan with a bit of Marsala wine, but otherwise DO NOT MESS with this

I was a bit leary to try this because of the amount of oil used. Only had 3 cube steaks so scaled recipe and used 1/4 cup oil. I did use the 1 tablespoon of beef bouillon (Herbox) and used enough water to almost cover the steaks. I browned and baked in a cast iron pan covered with foil. WOW..we were pleasantly surprised at how good these were. Baked at 325 and they were fork tender in an hour. Not as greasy as I expected. Next time I might add a little flour to the gravy.. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is an excellent way to cook cube steak and has become a favorite.  The only changes I made was instead of beef bouillon, I added beef stock and fresh mushrooms.  This truly is one of the best recipes I've seen and tasted.

Adding some garlic and onion powder makes this pretty good. And, oh, so tender! I used both beef broth (canned) and beef bouillon graniles. Thickened the liquid with Wondra for a delicious gravy!

I've never made cube steak before but this was good and tender. My son didn't like it, but my bf who loves cube steak said it was good. Worth making again. Very easy! UPDATE: Made a few changes and now son doesn't remember ever not liking them haha. I first caramelized onion prior to frying the steaks, adding garlic at the tail end and removing them before the frying process). I seasoned steaks liberally with steak seasoning and some greek seasoning (liberally because seasoning will be lost in the slow cooking process). Poured out extra grease before adding steaks back to the pan to make less greasy. Used a beef Maggie cube. Piled onions on top of steaks while they cooked. FULL of flavor. Very good. Made with homemade creamy garlic mashed potatoes, green beans and corn.  Easy weeknight meal. Oh, I forgot. I also added a bay leaf and some baby carrots to the liquid. Now THIS was good!!! I will definitely be making again!

Have made this a few times and rave reviews from everyone. I always add sliced onions, salt, pepper and a bit of garlic and use Beef Consumme for the broth. Have added a little extra water as well. Very good with mashed potatoes!

this was great. came out fork tender, flavorful and appealing to the  eye. The only thing I changed was that I added bell peppers and onion to the gravy, and i seasoned the flour with salt pepper and paprika. Other than that this is a great easy and delicious meal.

Great recipe! I added one, three cup package of brown gravy mix and browned an onion too. Cooking it for 2 hours really makes it!!! Thanks!

I'm on the fence.  Definitely more tender than just pan frying, which was good, but I wasn't over the moon about it.  I'll probably make it again though because BF likes cube steaks now and then.  I did toss some onions on top of the steaks while it simmered, that was a good addition.  The liquid wanted to cook away, I had to add more near the end.  Probably wouldn't matter unless you plan to make gravy.

As the fiance said, 'This is the best application of cubed steak ever'!  We were about to write off cubed steak forever, until we found this recipe.  Great over mashed potatoes and followed another reviewer's addition of 1 onion (which we took out after it was cooked) and 2 pounds of baby bella mushrooms, which went with the gravy and mashed potatoes so nicely!

I haven't bought cube steak in years but picked some up recently at my husband's insistence.  I used 2 low sodium beef bullion cubes, 2 cups of water and half on an onion sliced.  I only cooked the steak for about an hour, then removed from the pan.  I added flour/water and thickened the gravy even more.  We had mashed potatoes with it.  Dinner was great!  This one is a keeper.  My husband is happy that cube steak in back in the dinner rotation.

Great flavor. Mine turned out too salty, so I will change how much salt I put in next time. I always think its funny when recipes say add salt "to taste" when you can't taste it. Haha. 
Also, I rreally think after 1 hr mine was done. At 1.75 hrs it came out a little dry.

Easy to make and so delicious!  Vey tender and flavorful!  The only thing I did differently was to add a cut up onion in the skillet to simmer with the steak.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great and super easy family supper. Threw in an onion and 2 smashed cloves of garlic. A sp;ash of cream to finish for the gravy. Served over egg noodles.  Yum! Definitely a keeper!

Really excellent comfort food.  So easy and the end result was tender and delicious.  The photo does not do this dish justice.  I never buy cube steak but bought some on sale and found this recipe.  With some brown rice and a salad it is an excellent meal!

Super--very hearty!  I normally fry cube steak and then make gravy.  This was much more flavorful, tender and the gravy makes itself! I added onions and mushrooms but changed nothing else--mmm!   Both my boys and husband ate it all!

this turned out awesome.  I pan fried in a cast iron skillet, then put that in the oven.  The only thing I would change - add more water!  I didn't have enough gravy in the end.

I am not a cubed steak fan so i was reluctant to try this, especially since the picture did not make it look very appetizing and there were not many ingredients. but WOW!!!! everyone loved this when i made it, even a super picky 2 year old and 4 year old!! the only changes i made was i doubled the amount of bouillon cubes needed. this is a total keeper! in fact my household will be buying cubed steaks JUST so i can make this recipe!

This does make a cube steak extremely tender.  It just didn't have enough flavor for my taste.  I browned as stated on the recipe, then I put steaks and dripping into the crockpot, covered with water and added bouillon granules.  I cooked for 2 hrs (on high) then added 1 thinly sliced onion (it kind-of dissolved).  Cooked for 1 1/2 more hours and then added a mixture of 1 cup milk to 2 T cornstarch to make a gravy.  It was very thin.  It would have been better if I had left it all in the skillet as the recipe says.

Yum,  I made this with pre-made hambuger patties and used onion soup mix with the boullion. It was great and a good way to use up those patties too. Very easy!  Made it in the electric skillet to keep the kitchen cool.

this was VERY good! the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is because slat and pepper seasoning is not enough! i seasoned mine with all seasoning. and made gravy to put over mashed potatoes. mmmm....VERY good! the origional recipe needed more seasoning. COOK THE FULL TWO HOURS OR IT WILL NOT BE TENDER ENOUGH. MORE IS BETTER!!!!

OMG soooo goood. I couldn't find cube steak at the store I visited. So I had to buy ground sirloin patties. I followed the recipe then jazzed it up alittle. I put in some onion and mushroom after the meat was partially cooked. Put in an onion mushroom soup mix as well. Covered with water and simmered. Served over rice and a green veggie on the side.

I made this tonight and it turned out excellent! Modifications included using two boiling cups of water with three beef bouillion cubes, and I baked it for two hours on 325 degrees, as others suggested. I have NEVER made homemade gravy before, so I just used a small handful of flour and a dash of milk, used a whisk, and it was delicious! I used it over red potatoes. Asparagus as a side dish. Will make this again!

This was quite yummy and easy to make.  The meat was oh so tender!  I mixed a little flour and water into the juices to make gravy for the potato.  I'm thinking next time I will brown some onions with the steak.

Best cube steak EVER! I browned it on the stove like the directions said, then i transferred the meat and all the juice to a large casserole dish. I boiled water with 2 beef bouillon cubes and then added it to the dish until the meat was covered. Baked at 325 for 2 hours and enjoyed, it was so good my husband wanted to take it to his moms house for her to taste how yummy it was!

I was so surprised at how good (and easy)this recipe was! I've always dredged cube steak in flour, salt and pepper and pan fried. This made the meat much more tender and the gravy on mashed potatoes was awesome. Served with fresh green beans and corn for a wonderful meal, enjoyed by both hubby and 9 year old son. Oh, I did add onion and mushrooms to gravy just because I love them.  Somehow I ended up with two profiles on here, so I'm trying to get all my reviews on the right profile.  Sorry for dup post.

This was the best cube steak I have ever had!! (And I am not a big fan of cube steak!) I baked mine in the oven as suggested by someone else, but other than that I didn't make any other big changes. I did have to drain the oil and add some more water and cornstarch to get enough gravy for everyone's steak and mashed potatoes. GREAT RECIPE!! Thanks for sharing!!

Very good cube steak/swiss steak in brown gravy. Recipe fails to mention you need to flip the meat while simmering. The bottoms will burn if you don't flip the steaks. My first try with the recipe on simmer and the bottom was real dark. Do the flip.

Delicious!  I added garlic powder, fresh garlic, fresh onions and a little cayenne to suit my taste.  It comes out very tender and flavorful. Give it a try!  Don't worry about the variations that we post, just follow the recipe as is and you will have a good dish.

Couldn't believe our cube steaks from the bottom of the freezer could be made into something this tender and delicious!  Followed the oven directions,  which worked great.

What a great bachelor's recipe. Inexpensive, easy to make and not a lot of prep time, leaving a guy free for manly, manly stuff like watching the game and putting things together without reading the directions. I did invite some extra guests to the party by putting some sliced onions in just before the cover went on. They got a along famously with the other ingredients and the party was a taste success!

This was an excellent way to prepare cube steak.  It was fork tender when finished.  My wife turned up her nose when I said I bought cube steak,  so I tried to find a recipe that was a little different than the 'flour, pound, and fry it' approach.  Afterwards, she said she loved it, and it was the best she had ever had.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe. The cube steak was so tender that my kids could cut it with their forks. The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter and served it up with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. 

The second time I made it, I wanted to save room on the stove, so I browned them in a cast iron skillet, covered the pan with foil and stuck in a 325 oven for the 2 hour simmer time. It turned out just as lovely as when I stove simmered it.

The third time I made it, right before I put it in the oven, I placed a slice of onion on each cube steak. Then I served them on toasted sandwich rolls. The meat is so tender it makes perfect steak sandwiches.

Anytime hubby cleans his plate I feel like dinner was an accomplishment! This is his favorite meal- cube steak, mashed potatoes and green beans. The only difference is I cooked the steaks through and kept them in the oven while I finished everything else. The gravy was tricky but at the end it came out great

I confess! I modified just a bit, not much though. I added paprika and garlic powder to the flour and baked at 325 for an hour. The flavor was perfect and normally tough cube steaks were super tender. There was no need for milk or additional spices as just a touch of flour easily thickened the sauce into a gravy.

This is definitely a keeper~I'm not much of a beef eater, but this was awesome. I didn't change a thing other than the addition of some onions. I served it with rice and green beans. Thanks!

Delicious and inexpensive!  The extra cooking time is worth it; although I found I needed to add a bit more water towards the end.  I did add some additional spices to the flour (crushed red pepper, Nature's Seasoning - this replaced the salt/pepper, and some dry mustard).  I also put several slices of red onion on top at the beginning so they caramelized nicely.  Gravy is wonderful over rice or potatoes.  Perfect dinner for a hungry bunch.

This was really easy and very tasty! I added some lipton onion soup mix to the water, which I think enhanced the flavor. I also added a dollop of sour cream which made the color more gravy like and made it just a touch thicker.  I served with peas and brown rice and my two teenager diners loved it!

This was extremely tasty with so little ingredients!  The only thing i did different was mix my beef bullion in with my water before covering my steaks. They came out tender and full of flavor!

Great starter recipe! I dredged the cube steaks in flour and seasoning and pan fried them until lightly browned. I then transferred them to a baking dish. I put some butter in the same pan I browned the meat and slightly sautéed some mushroom and onions. Mixed that with a can of gravy and beef broth and poured it over the meat. Covered the dish with foil and baked in the oven for 2 hours.  House smelled fantastic!! Meat came out tender and with gravy it was excellent over mashed potatoes!! Found a new way to transform that cut of meat!

This was so easy to make, and the meat was so tender. I substituted the beef boullion with beefy onion soup mix because that was what I had available. Also, after browning the meat I added a chopped onion and sauteed it until it was translucent. I then added the beefy onion soup mix with 2 cups of water. Stirred it to loosen what was on the bottom of the pan. Then I added 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it and a can of Golden Mushroom soup...not diluted. Stirred until completely mixed, then poured over the meat. I cooked egg noodles rather than potatoes. My husband loved it! I will definitely be making this again!

It was really good. I did this recipe healthier. I used deer meat instead of cow and olive oil instead of vegetable oil and gluten free bis quick  instead of all purpose flour and they turned out super good. Recommend to everyone

I tried this recipe as written first time. It was good but..I didn't like how the coating became soft/gummy after simmering. So now, I season up the cube steaks & sear on both sides in a bit of bacon drippings. Then I add beef broth (with 1 T cornstarch mixed in)and thin sliced onions. Cover & bake 2 hours at 325. Works great! Tender and tasty. Inexpensive dinner I did not consider for years as I disliked cube steaks I used to just flour/fry and try to eat. Nice idea although I do this a bit differently then written. Great start though, thanks.

These were AMAZING!!! In fact, I am making them again (for the 4th time in a. couple months time). It is tremendously sad to see someone give this recipe a poor rating because 1). Didn't have the proper type of bullion, and 2). Said it didn't specify exactly how much water to add. 

The recipe calls for enough water to almost cover the top of the meat. To give an exact amount of water in the recipe, we all would have to have the exact same cut and height in meat, and the exact same pan we are cooking them in. 

Life isn't like that! Lol! Plus, adding enough water to almost cover the meat is fine for this recipe.

Again, sad that because of this, it got a poor rating by this person.

I follower the recipe as it says but did add seasoning to the flour mix. I was a little disappointed in the way it turned out :-/ was a bit dry and not as good as I hoped for. It did make a nice gravy to put over top. I was expecting more.

I made this recipe one night when I ran out of dinner ideas and had the experimental combination of being low on groceries and not wanting to brave the cold to get said groceries. I just call this smothered steak because it replaced my old recipe for that in a heartbeat. I've made this more times than I can count. I pretty much follow the recipe, except I love onions and I add about half a cup of them at the beginning. They pretty much cook away after two hours, so my little niece and nephew haven eaten it with impunity. Minced garlic can add a bit of flavor too. This is the definition of comfort food.

Great flavor and the meat was super tender. Our 2 year old couldn't get enough and she doesn't really care for steak of any kind. Served with mashed potatoes to top out the meal.

This was amazingly good!! A keeper.  This recipe transformed a tough cubed steak...(I only eat forage fed/organic meats, which although delish, are tougher than the hormone laden beef), tender & delish. A great way to tenderize a normally tougher cut of meat. I added crimini mushrooms to the gravy while it simmered.  The mock mashed potatoes (cauliflower, garlic, cream)& sauteed spinach were tasty for a healthy, lower carb meal.  The flour on the steaks thickened the gravy nicely.  This is a simple, but very tasty meal. It smelled so good while simmering :-) Thank-you for sharing.

This was outstanding! I cannot believe that cube steak can taste this good. I followed the recipe exactly, adding sliced mushrooms the last half hour. Keep an eye on the liquid, I used water and bouillon but you could also use canned beef broth. It was done in one and a half hours, very tender. The best cube steak I've ever had.

The first time I made these I did it on the stove top, but i had to keep adding water to keep them from burning. Second time i did it in the oven and they were great! Will make these again and again!

Recipe is great..just like my mom's..I add a little garlic salt to meat and add onions/mushrooms to gravy ..I also cut my meat into smaller portions before flouring ..Like a little bigger than bite size because I have small kids and this is easier than cutting up after cooking plus the meat seems to be more tender. I like to use my electric skillet with this recipe.

A comforting meal on a chilly fall evening. This was delicious! Cooking on a budget has lead me to some of the best recipes and cube steak can come out tough and inedible if cooked wrong. I had no leftovers. The long cook time made the steaks very tender and flavorful as well. I did however add fresh sliced mushrooms and onions to the gravy while it was cooking. At the last minute, I noticed a half of a package of button mushrooms at the bottom of the frige and needed to use them up before they went bad. (hey! waste not, want not, right?). I served it with real mashed potatoes and a side of peas and carrots. Thanks for sharing!

They came out so tender and literally falling apart.  NO KNIFE NEEDED!  I added onions and mushrooms too, because we like them.  Thanks for another great recipe. :)

Great recipe for cube steak.  After frying the steaks instead of the beef bullion I added 2 tablespoons of Lipton's Beefy Onion soup mix in a cup of water.  The steaks were very tender.

Great Recipe.

I used a can of crem of mushroom soup, 1.5 cans of water to make gravy.

Added one red onion once the steaks were simmering in the gravy.  Simmered for 2+ hours and served with mashed cauliflour and collard greens.

This recipe was delicious!  I've made cube steak before and always had trouble getting it nice and tender.  Cooking the steak longer after frying it definitely makes it juicy and tender.  The only changes I made was adding garlic powder and cooking on low for only 1.5 hours.  I also added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the leftover juice to thicken it up and make gravy.  Great recipe!

Amazing alternative to the chicken fried stake my husband always insists on making out of the cube stake.  Delightful and a family favorite.  I added a small amount of worshisire, onion, garlic and mushroom to the pan on top of the meat, and a dash of red wine vinigar towards the last 20 minutes if simmer time.  Made a great meal with mashed potatos and corn on the cob.

Wonderful and very easy to make which is exactly what I need because I don't like to cook.  Followed recipe exactly with no substitutions and steak was very tender. My husband and daughter both ate even though they were both skeptical. He has never eaten any cube steak I have ever made and today he went back for seconds. Will definitely make again. When I made the gravy, I took the meat out and put on plate.  Then poured remaining broth into a gravy separator and drained most of the oil out before putting it back in pan.  I added a little milk, corn starch, and Worcesterchire sauce and heated back up.  Poured over mashed potatoes and on steak.  Very good.

This is a lovely recipe. I baked it in the oven as advised from another reviewer. All the family enjoyed it. My only question is the milk in the comment is not in the recipe. If I wanted to, I would add a tbs or 2 of cream at the end.

Made this for dinner tonight and my husband loved it. Will definitely make it again. Easy to prepare and delicious. I made a mistake and added too much bouillon so it was really salty. Had to tweak it to get the saltiness out. I think next time ill use low sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon and ill add mushrooms. Great recipe. Thx!

Delicious way to make cube steak! I did not have any bouillion so I added a package of brown gravy mix to water and then added that. I cooked some mushrooms and onions on the side and then added them. Great served over Jasmine rice.

This recipe is so amazing! I cant believe how tender the steak was. My 3, 7, and 9 year old loved every bite. I did make gravy out of the broth and that was good too. Although i did use more beef bouillion.

I made this in my iron skillet, and it turned out well.  I used less oil than called for and beef broth instead of water and bouillon, but otherwise followed the recipe.  (I guess I also seasoned the meat with more than salt and pepper...)  The gravy is thin, but flavorful and the meat is fork tender.  Would definitely make again!

I made this recipe a few months ago and almost forgot to write a review. This recipe is awesome. My husband loves steak and even though the steak isn't as big as what he's used to but he loved the flavor and tenderness of the steak. I would definintely make this again.

Turned out nice and tender.  I only sauted it for 45 minutes and used butter.  The kicker was that I made a gravy to go over it.  I added flour, water and seasoned to perfection.  Thank you!

This is one of the best cubed steaks I ever made! My husband, who normally doesn't like cubed steak, said it was the best he's had in a long, long time, so he was very impressed! I did add some bello mushrooms and seasoned the flour more, but other than that, I followed the recipe and even cooked it for less time (1 1/2) and it still was very tender!! One thing-put in on low, not med.low so it doens't scorch your sauce, and then add a little cornstartch with some water at the end of cooking. Perfect! I will add this to my recipe box. Thx!!

Well, I changed the recipe quite a bit using a combination of the reviews.  I added 1 tsp garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt & 3/4 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp white pepper to 1 cup flour.  I forgot the paprika and next time will add it.  I didn't have onions or mushrooms on hand.  So I used 1 can Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup, 1 packet Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix, 5 beef bouilion cubes dissolved in boiling water.  Put in crockpot and cooked on high for 5 hours.  Next time will either shorten cooking time to 4 hours or cook on low for 4 to 5 hours.  The gravy mixture was excellent and the cube steak very tender.  My hubby loved it and cannot wait till I make it again!

Great basic recipe. I, of course made some changes. First I dredged the steaks in flour and browned them and transferred to a baking dish. I used the drippings to make a wild mushroom gravy by adding shiitake, portabella, and buttons along with a couple of cloves of garlic. I sauteed these in the drippings along with some extra butter and EVOO. I added about half a box or more of beef stock and let it simmer for awhile. I ended up thickening it with some extra flour and pouring over the steaks. Baked at 325 covered for 2 hours. DELISH!

I've never made cube steak before. This recipe looked simple enough. My family loved it! I fried thick onion rings with the steaks, put the steaks in a baking sheet, put the partially fried onions on top, then poured the gravy on. I baked everything in the oven for 45 minutes. It was delicious!

My Husband recently had a massive heart attack so he can no longer eat a lot of beef, but cube steak was always one of his favorite meals. So instead of using Beef I substituted Venison Cube Steaks, and they turned out delicious! I did add 1 tsp. each of Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Paprika, Seasoned Salt and Fresh Ground Black Pepper to 1 Cup of flour before dredging the steaks, and also used Canola Oil to fry them. I also added onion slices, mushrooms, and some chopped roasted Garlic. Since I didn't have the Bullion I used Swanson Beef Broth instead.  This was my very first time cooking deer meat and everyone said it was great! (I still refuse to eat it!) Thanks for sharing!!

This was great!  My mom always made cube steak when I was a kid and I loved it.  But when I would try to cook it as an adult, it always turned out too chewy.  This was a perfect and easy way to make it fork-tender.  I also added some onion powder to it.  My gravy was sparse, but it didn't really need it because it was so easy to chew.  I'll definitely make this again.

We were not wild about this recipe. The crust became very gummy after adding the liquid. It could by I use too much flour.

This was very, very tender & tasty.  I used a can of beef broth instead of buillion granules.  I would suggest cutting back on the oil, as it left quite a bit of grease on top of the sauce when it was done.  My picky husband & teenage son loved it.  I thickened the sauce for gravy & served over mashed potatoes.

This is the best cube steak recipe I have ever tried, even my four kids who are all under the age of 9 love it.  The only changes I made was I used white rice flour in replace of the wheat flour and beef broth instead of beef bouillon, this is due to my gluten free diet. YUMMY!!

While this does turn out to be a very tender way of preparing cube steak - the flavor is just not there.  It is extremely bland, even with added seasoning salt, onions, & garlic.  I won't be making this again.

I thought the sauce a little plain - so what I did was in step 2 - I stirred one can of cream of mushroom soup with 2 TBSP milk and 1 TBSP of Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce together - added that mixture to the bottom of my dutch oven, added 5 red potatoes - and layered the cube steaks on the top of the taters.  Then baked for 2 hrs at 325.  I used the 'sauce' as a gravy for the potatoes.  Turned out pretty good.

Tender (course I always use tenderized meat), but a quick and easy way to make smothered steak. Nothing really fancy, but a hearty meal. Will make it again sometime.

I added diced onions and jalapenos to the pan for the last hour.  They practically melted into the gravy and gave it an extra kick.  Great use for cube steak.

This is excellent, the only cube steak recipe I use.  I add a bit of garlic powder to the flour as well and also sliced onions to the water.  Perfect and the gravy is fantastic.

My cube steaks were too thick... my fault and use low salt beef broth as it cooks down broth can be too salty.  You can alway salt to taste later.  Other than my mistakes this was a great recipe.

I made mine keto friendly, with almond flour and pork rinds for coating. Used a cast iron skillet, and only had to cook for about an hour before they were done. Very tender. Made gravy out of xanthan gum & leftover “fixins”. Quite a tasty dish!

I didn't have beef boullion granules so I used so other spices I typically use for burgers; it turned out alright just a little too peppery. 
Also when it came time to make the gravy I had too much liquid to use flour so we mixed up cornstarch and water then added that in to make the gravy. We also scraped out the bits before mixing in the cornstarch.

Dude, I can’t even believe how good this was. I added a whole sweet onion and whole peppercorns to the simmer because why not? I also seasoned the steaks with garlic powder as well as the salt and pepper the recipe called for. PHENOMENAL! This is my first time making cubed steaks and I definitely have the confidence to make them again! Thanks!

I've always made my country style steak this method even before I saw this recipe.  It's the slow cook time that pulls the flavors together and tenderizes the meat.  Most of the time I'll substitute beef broth for the bouillon cube.  And to give it a little extra boost of flavor, add a little brewed coffee.  I usually use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of coffee .   Onions and/or mushrooms are always a great addition if you want to vary the recipe.   If I want to have this on a week night, I have made it in the crock pot on low.  I start it just before leaving for work and it's ready when I get home.  The cube steak will melt in your mouth.

This was superb!  The directions were simple and straightforward.  However, the crowning glory was the delicious, ulta-tender steak.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed it. I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and roasted carrots. I will definitely continue to make this dish!

This was excellent.  I did it in my InstantPot.  Salted and floured the steaks as directed, then seared them in oil on the Saute function, then added the beef broth, sealed the pot and pressure cooked at the normal level (Manual setting) for 20 minutes, then did the quick release method.  I pulled out the steaks, turned it back to Saute, added some salt, pepper, and flour, and whisked up a gravy.  Very good and tender and worked better time-wise for a weeknight dinner.

I’ve been trying to find a good beef cube recipe for weeks now because I accidentally ordered the wrong meat one day at the meat store..I thought I was ordering beef cube which I make a good stew for not cubed beef, who knew?? Lol! But this will help! Thanks so much!!

I didn't have beef bouillon, substituted with a little of a Au jus gravy pgk. Tried to watch the salt, but it still was too salty. Corrected with a tsp of sugar. Added few drops of Worcestershire sauce and kitchen bouquet.  Cooked on low for 1 1/2 hrs. and meat was very tender.

Always a family favorite!  Glad I found it.  Have made it several times, and use the other reviewer's recipe for the milk, flour and water.  SO tender as cubed steak tends to be a little chewy if you don't beat it to paper thin!  This is delicious!  I do add Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix to the water and beef bullion and let it cook for about an hour, done!  So easy and so good, thanks!

I made this cube steak recipe after reading many of the rave reviews. We Loved it! The steaks were very tender and delicious! I made a cornstarch & water slurry and thickened the juices after removing the meat, made a yummy gravy! The only change I made was using beef broth instead of bullion and water and I  put the pan in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours. Perfect recipe, thank you for sharing!!

Very basic recipe but very good. I put a bit more water in to have enough liquid  to make the gravy. I added about triple the amount of bullion. 4 cubes. Cooked on a lower heat and 2 hours later the steaks were extremely tender. Simply add a couplw teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in half a cup of cold water to thicken juice for sauce. Add a bit more water if necessary. SERVED WITH MASHED potatoe and green beans.

Very good !  Cooked onions and mushrooms in drippings with flour to make gravy. Layered steaks in  baking dish, poured gravy over top and baked covered with foil at 325 for about two hours.  Oh yum with rice or potatoes.

Very easy and tasty recipe. I usually struggle with making gravy so my husband usually makes the cube steak but with this simple and effective way of making gravy I have finally perfected this dish. I did use a little soy sauce in the gravy to darken it but other than that the recipe was followed directly!

Made just as directed and it was so tender. I have to say this was the most tender cubed steak I have ever eaten. I made a homemade gravy, Turnup greens and whipped potatoes to go with this wonderful cubed steak. This one will be around to stay at our house.

. I added onions and mushrooms and then had it in the oven covered for 1/2 hours. It was okay. I do want to make it again though to figure out how to make it more tender and tasteful.

Very tender..but not very flavorful.  Due to high sodium, I did swapped out the water/bullion for low sodium beef broth (that did help the flavor) . I missed the step to let the meat rest after dredging on a couple so the coating was a bit soft on those (my fault completely).  I will try again, but will be more aggressive with seasoning (add some garlic, onions, etc).  However, the cooking method did make the meat so tender.

Turned out fabulous!!!  The only thing I would do different is, no seasoning with the salt. You’ll get enough salt from the boullion!

This came out great! So tender and full of good flavor. I added a sliced onion to simmer to the broth(about 2 C I used). Thickened  the gravy up and threw in some sliced mushrooms. Added a bit of cream for creaminess and oh my goodness. So yum! Going 5o make this more often!

The flavor was great and the meat was fork tender.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers, added sliced onions and mushrooms and baked it since I was going to be in and out of the house and didn't want to worry about an unattended pan on the stove.  I set my oven at 325 degrees and baked for 90 minutes.  I believe it was at least 30 minutes too long.  When I took it out and removed the cover, the water had all cooked away. So, I took the meat out and set it on a platter while I added enough water to make a nice amount of gravy and beef bouillon for flavor. I thickened it with a cornstarch slurry, added some half & half for a creamy effect and a teaspoon of our favorite whiskey (didn't have courvoisier or would have used that).  It was very tasty.  Served it with Jasmine Rice to rave reviews! :)

Cube steaks are quite often on sale where I live, and I was about to stop buying them prior to trying this recipe, as I never loved them.  These were, without a doubt, the best cube steaks I’ve ever made for my family.  Gone are the days of the tough and overly-dry cube steaks!  This recipe was so easy to follow, too.  Thank you for sharing it!!

This was so disappointing. I followed the instructions exactly and thought it sounded odd to soak something after browning it but I did. The flour crust turned to some mushy stringy thing and all you can taste is the beef bullion cube and ALL the salt! The meat was able to be cut easily with a fork and when you scraped off the flour-mush crust it was edible but not something I would ever recommend or do again.

I made this exactly as posted.  I'm always looking for recipes for my 92 year old mother who hates to cook and will not do recipes with lots of ingredients (I think 5 is about her limit).  Mom and I both enjoyed this.  Next time I make for myself I will add a few of the things others have suggested, just didn't want to scare Mom off.  I may try making in the slow cooker as I'm kind of a lazy cook.

Maybe those who complained about the 'au jus' drying up either cook at a med/hi simmer or their cover allowed too much evaporation.   Just sayin

LOVE THIS! I need low salt recipes because I cook for my mom with heart problems so I just replaced the bullion with “no salt” broth and added some garlic and onion for extra flavor. Served it with rice and the whole family devoured it!

Made it exactly per the recipe, and as usual it turned out great. I would probably do a few things to jazz this up, but it’s still a salad recipe as is.

If you think  what Cracker Barrel serves is good eats, this recipe is for you.  Tender, yes -- it would definitely appeal to the toothless/denture senior-citizen tour-bus crowd.  Salty enough.  Otherwise, no flavor profile and nothing interesting or challenging.  Hubby loved it but he thinks Kraft Mac'n Cheese is haute cuisine, go figure.  Kid wouldn't even touch it.  I'd skip this recipe and look for something with more flavor.  I'll make it again if he asks, but plan something different for myself and the kid.

Very tender and tasty.  I added 1/2 onion while cooking for extra flavor.  The drippings made a super gravy that I topped the steak and mashed potatoes with.  Hubby loved it!

I've made this twice now.   The first time it was so tender but I thought it really lacked flavor, although my husband loved it.  Tonight I aldded butter to the skillet, put the meat in an egg wash,, more grill seasoning to the flour and added beef onion soup mix to the water.  
It was tender and so flavorful - husband loved it and even my dad gave it a thumbs up :)

After reading the reviews, I brown on both sides and then place in a 9x13 pan with beef broth, onions, and mushrooms.  Cover with foil and bake at 325 for 2 hours.  Super tender and delicious.  A family favorite!

My daughter LOVES cube steak but I'm not a fan of feeling like I'm chewing leather, which is what happens for most cube steak recipes. THIS recipe, however, is literally the best thing ever. We make it  any time I get cube steak and the whole thing gets devoured! I've made it with gravy and without and, honestly, either way it's fantastic.

I used this recipe with 4 top blade steaks as it is a tougher cut of meat.  Used a cast iron skillet to brown the steaks and beef stock as I didn't have any bouillon.  After browning I covered the skillet with heavy duty foil and put in a 275 degree oven for 2 hours.  The last hour I covered the steaks with onion slices.  It turned out great!  Steaks were very tender and the gravy was perfect over mashed potatoes.

Cube steaks came out tender, but the taste of it was what I would call "an almost". It's probably just my personal taste but while it was good,  it seemed to fall short and may need a small adjustment in seasoning. At yet, I do not know what, but I will make it  again and experiment.

I never make cube steak.  However, it was on sale this week and I thought this recipe sounded good.  It was super easy and my husband loved it!  The meat was very tender --you didn't even need a knife.  The gravy is delicious and was perfect for the mashed potatoes that I made to go with it.  The recipe didn't specify the water.  I used 2 cups and 2 bouillon cubes.  I added a few onions to the gravy as it cooked for the 2 hours.   Very good!

I have always hated cube steak but my husband loves it. So, I was looking for a recipe that sounded at least half way appealing. This is DELICIOUS! I only use this recipe for cube steak. I cook it exactly as instructed amd make zero changes.

Only changes made were to use beef broth to simmer with and 1tsp better than bullion, 2tsp corn starch and I cup milk to make gravy. Very tender and full of flavor! Will be on the menu rotation from now on!

This was really yummy. I did add some onion but it would have been great without it too.

Thank you for this recipe.  I use whole wheat flour and extra light olive oil, and beefy mushroom soup instead of beef boulions, turned out FABULOUS! Tender, juicy and great flavor.  My cube steak use to be tough, but this was so tender it almost fell apart.TWO thumbs up:)

Mom used to make this (1950s) and my brothers and I loved it. I thought I'd reconnect with this recipe. It was OK (meaning I didn't throw it out), but somewhat bland. Perhaps our young taste buds were completely satisfied with less flavor. I finally took it off the stove and served after 45 minutes - as the gravy kept reducing. Perhaps I had the heat too high. I still have a couple of steaks left over and will try another recipe.

Kids cringe when they hear I'm making "cube steak" because of the toughness of the cut.  BUT, we were pleasantly surprised how tender this turned out.  Didn't need a knife to cut it.  This will be on the top of my cube steak recipes.  Didn't change anything, except add about 1/2T Onion flakes to the broth.  Great recipe!

Very good base recipe.  Mine came out too salty but that's because I added extra beef seasoning.  I also added lots of onions and multicolored peppers.  I had some left over so I'm going to see how it freezes.

Wonderful recipe for cube steak!  Dredged as instructed, adding 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the flour mix.  Browned in heavy frying pan in 1/4 cup oil.  Added about 2 and 1/2 cups water with a rounded half teaspoon of "Better than Broth" to the pan with the meat.  Sprinkled on a small handful of minced dried  onions.  Added pan lid and placed in 325 degree oven for 2 hours, as described by Carianne.  Just great!!

This recipe is amazing!! MY boyfriend is a meat and potatoes guy, and I made this for our anniversary dinner. It is so easy to make. Instead of cooking it for two hours, I decided to put it on the stove early in the morning, and cooked it all day to make it extremely tender!! It was very delicious!!!

Excellent  - minimum time to prepare. This is a great "fall back" recipe when you are short on time. Yes, it takes two hours to cook, but it's the stove doing the work. My husband, a meat and potatoes kind of guy, LOVES it, and never fails to compliment me on this dinner. I've served it over egg noodles or potatoes. He wonders how I get the steak this tender. I've never revealed the secret (cooking for two hours, then making gravy) and he thinks I've slaved over it. Let him believe it! Thanks for sharing, gerhart!

These were really good, a hit with the husband and 2 yr old! I added about 3 cups of water & bullion mix to my big skillet to have enough liquid in there. Then after they were done add about 1/2 cup milk , salt, pepper and some cornstarch to thicken. Its a keeper and a great use for the many cube steaks we get after butchering!

This is an absolute family favorite. The meat was very tender and juicy. I used beef broth in place of the water and bullion cubes and it was perfect. It was also a very easy dish to cook. As a young mom/wife I felt very accomplished making this great dinner for my family! Thanks!

Very easy to make. followed recipe exactly except for used garlic powder on steaks in addition to salt and pepper. Very good, rave reviews from my husband and his friend who was visiting. Made 6 steaks for 3 people and not one was left. Thank you for the recipe. served with mashed potatoes, field peas, corn and herb garlic biscuits.

I have made this twice so far, the above listed way -and- the reviewer suggested baked way. I couldn't say which was easier or better! All the ingredients are things any kitchen has on hand, which I love, and the recipe is practically fool-proof! Only things I added in were onion and garlic powder to taste. Hubby took it to work and the guys he works with raved! Will be making this for a long time to come. Thank you!

This is great dish!  We have made this many times. 

The review that only gave one star because "amount of water was not stated" doesn't make sense.  The steps specifically state enough water to almost cover the steaks.

This is the same recipe my grandma, my mom and me have made for years. Delicious! The only way to improve it is to lay thinly sliced rings of onions on top of the meat and let them cook in with the gravy. Serve with mash potatoes. Absolutely awesome! My grown sons love it. We call it smothered steak. You can also make hamburger patties this way. We call it hamburger steak.

I'm a foodie so I was skeptical of this simple recipe. But after my husband made it I was sold! My son loves it so much that for Christmas I gave him coupons to request it anytime he wants. Great way to get protein in for my picky eater!

Very good. Recipe should mention to cook until liquid is reduced (or add more boullion) to give broth more flavor. I also seasoned the steaks with s&p and granulated garlic & sprinkle of dried thyme leaves. I also added rather thick onion rings & fresh mushrooms.  Just add veggies as u cover for the extended simmer. Yum! Thanks so much for sharing recipe. Love this website. I use daily. So many ideas.

This is an excellent, easy recipe for days when you're going to be home, but you don't have time to babysit or get into a fussy recipe. Personally, I think it's greatly enhanced by the addition of mushrooms and onions over-the-top as it slow cooks for the two hours. Excellent served with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.

This is one of the most simple and delicious dishes anyone could make(if you like cube steak). I made this tonight and could not believe how yummy and tender the cube steak turned out. Followed the recipe as written. After cooking the cube steak for 3 min. on each side, I placed them on a plate and added onion and cooked with the juice steak and added about a 1/3 cup of flour , then added the water and billion, brought to a boil, mixed really good then put the steaks in the skillet, and simmered for 2 hours. Perfect, Perfect way to make cube steak. This one is a keeper!!! Thank you for the

Since I found this I make it a few times a month and now my bff makes it too.  I also cook it in the oven as another reviewer mentioned to me it comes out more tender that way.  I do a few different variations as well.  I use canned beef stock or consomme because I don't use bouillon.  Also adding a can of diced tomatoes on top with just enough of the beef stock to come halfway up the cube steaks.

This so good!  I've been cooking cube steak for many, many years, but never did I simmer them for 2 hours before.  I thought this was overkill, but I was wrong.  They came out so tender and delicious.  I never knew they could be so tender.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I'll use it every time I cook cube steak from now on.

These were the most tender cube steaks I've ever had! Fantastic! I added a little garlic powder, baby carrots, and sliced red onion, simmered for 1.5 hours and served with garlic and parsley mashed potatoes. The steaks fell apart while trying to serve. 4 clean plates at super's end. Thanks!

I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It was not to our liking.  I'd never had cube steak before, so maybe the problem was more the meat than the recipe itself.

The only change I made was to cook it for about 1 1/2 hours instead of 2 hours.  This recipe is absolutely amazing.  It was the best cube steak I have ever had.   I will definitely make it again, and in the very near future!!

I will most certainly make this again. It was very simple, tender, and reminded me of something my grandmother used to cook. I will change up the end by taking out the meat after browning. Then adding back some of the flour with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder before putting the meat and water back in to simmer so I can have a thicker gravy. I like it to stick to my rice.

The only changes I made were to sub canola oil for vegetable oil and no beef bouillon. I only use grass-fed beef and the flavor is so good that no bouillon is needed.  This was a great recipe that really tenderized the tough cube steak.  I checked on it after an hour in the pan and it was tender and I was hungry so I ate it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked the steak in the crock pot about 5 hours on low and didn't use the stove. I used season salt instead of regular salt. I lined the bottom of the crock pot with cooking oil, sliced onions, and minced garlic. I dredged the steak in flour before putting it in the crock pot. I used 32 oz of beef broth and poured a can of mushrooms on top. I added flour after about 4 hours and stirred it in to start making gravy. I made the rest of the gravy when the steak was done.

easy and YUMMY! I use a gas stove, and it doesn't have the "low" or "simmer" option. I lightly boiled the cube steaks for about one hr not 2 and they were divine!!!

I have made several recipes on here and have always had success with anything with this positive of a rating. I followed the instructions EXACTLY, with the exception I followed the "top reviewer Carianne's" comment. I chose to follow her advice and cook it in my oven for 2 hours after browning them at 325 degrees. Surely you meant 225, Carianne? UGGH. THEY WERE DRIED OUT AND BLACK. I went with her advice over the instructions because of the fact simmering would be MORE LIKELY than the oven to torch those steaks.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.

I didn't have beef bouillon, so I took a little beef gravy and mixed it with water, then covered the steaks with that. I was a little nervous that cooking the steaks for 2 hours would end in disaster, but I kept the faith and these are the best cube steaks I've ever made. Will definitely be adding this to our rotation!

This is how I cook cube steak, it is so tender and good! If I have it on hand I use a can of French onion soup instead of water and beef bouillon. Sometimes I also add potatoes and carrots on top before simmering for a one pan meal!

This recipe arrived in my in-box and the reviews were so good that I decided I had to buy cube steaks and give it a try.  After reading other reviews, I decided to sauté an onion and some garlic in my pan before browning the cube steak.  I put the sautéed onions and garlic on top of the individual servings of steak -- after browning and before adding the water and bouillon granules.  I opted to bake mine for two hours in a 300-degree oven.  When it came out, I made gravy with the liquid left in the pan and leftover flour (from breading the steaks) and milk.  The result?  Definitely fork-tender and the flavor was pretty good.  I agree with other reviewers that it might be pretty bland if not for the onions and garlic.  Reminds me of a cross between hamburger steak and chicken-fried steak.  In the end, I think it's a good recipe, I just don't think I"m a big fan of cube steak.  Probably won't make it again, but if you like cube steak, I would recommend giving it a try.

I Like the approach of braising for 2 hours but changed it to some of my basic technique for slow cooking.

First of all I Used beef stock, then deglased with a 1 cup of good red wine, cooked for 1 1/2 hours removed the steaks, skimmed the fat off returned to pan, added 1 tbs of kitchen boutique for flavor and color, reduced by 1/3 added 1 tbs butter, returned the steak to the pan turn to coat and served.

This has become a favorite at our house.  It is so easy, and turns out perfect and so tender every time.  I followed the directions exactly, and wouldn't change a thing.  Even my picky little eaters cheer when they find out that we are having this for dinner! Thanks for a great recipe.

It was good not great. The gravy was a nice addition - I'll try making it again. I thought the meat was tough.

This is so close to how my Mom makes her's. We add a little onions diced up to it, I like a little heat to mine, so I add a little crushed red peppers. it makes the gravy so good.

Yes. kids loved it. I added cooking wine to electric fry pan and sauteed mushrooms. Served with mashed potatoes. Kids liked it. I added onion powder/ garlic power and paprika.   Easy for a busy mom! Browned meat then placed in eectric fry pan on 2 hours and off I went to finish household things!

Great recipe! I made it for supper tonight and so very pleased I found this recipe looking forward to making it again! I seasoned each cube steak with pepper&garlic salt-both sides then floured them. I fried each cube steak one at a time, three minutes each side then set aside. I used the 4 hour crock pot method from other reviews and it was absolutely AMAZING!  Put them in a sprayed crock pot added three cups beef broth topped with quartered sliced onions and sliced baby bella mushrooms. After four hours in crock spooned mushrooms&onions out into bowl placed in oven to keep warm put cube steaks on pan in oven (170 degrees). Thickened up gravy. Cube steak, gravy, then top with mushroom&onions, mashed potatoes&gravy with side of green beans. POW! Yummy dinner. we did use just a fork to eat meat...no knife needed.

Seldom rate recipes but this was so simple and good. After 2 hr. Simmer, steaks were very tinder. Added mushrooms to gravy and thickens with corn starch. Excellent.

I've never made cubed steak, so I was a bit nervous. This turned out great! My son loved it. I did a one pan method and after browning and adding the water I covered it with aluminum foil and popped it in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours (per another reviewers suggestion.) The meat was tender and served over noodles with the gravy made a great meal. My only change will be to reduce the salt next time. I think I will skip the salt with the flour as the bouillon gives it enough salt. Will definitely be making this more often! Great bargain dinner!

This is the first time I have ever enjoyed a cubed steak! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! The only thing I did different is threw in an onion to simmer down with the steaks. Then at the end removed the steaks, strained out the onions and lumps and caught what was left of the beef stock in a bowl, made another few cups of stock, whipped up a butter and flour roux in the same skillet then added the stock for a yummy brown gravy and made some rice.

I made this recipe exactly as listed,  but doubled it. I fried the meat in my electric skillet at 350*with the oil.  Then I took the meat out and stirred in the beef bouillon and water ( I used 3tsp of beef bouillon granular's to 4 cups of water. My electric skillet is oblong and big) I put the meat back in pan and let that come to a boil. Turned the heat down to 200*,  covered it with the lid, and cooked it for two hours. The meat was so tender you could cut it with your fork! It was wonderful!   The gravy was also, made mashed potatoes to go with the gravy. I will definitely make this dish over and over. The only change I will make is add a onion. Try this simple but tasty recipe, you won't be disappointed! Thanks for sharing it. God Bless to all.

I made this for dinner and my kids, one of which is very picky, loved it. She even went back for seconds! Will definitely make this again. I used beef broth instead of water. As the meat cooked, the gravy seemed to cook away, so I just added more beef broth and about 2-3 more tsp of flour and mixed it up in the cooker. I moved it to a smaller burned and turned on low. This did the trick. I ended up using 32oz of beef broth. My picky one even asked for more gravy!

Tasted more like fried chicken than steak, but it was enjoyable. My husband hates steak (except for filet mignon) because he hates having to chew each bite 100 times, but he was happy with this steak. I didn't have bouillan cubes, so we used a beef ramen noodle flavor packet. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't care much for the fried chicken flavor.

The cube steak fell apart before I could even flour it. It looked more like hamburger meat than cube "steak". A ring of oil lingered in the frying pan so I ended up straining the liquid after this was done cooking. It tasted OK, a little plain. Not a huge fan this time but I will try making this again.

Wow.  What a simple easy recipe.  The only changes I made were that I didn't add salt, and I used cyan pepper and red pepper flakes and added a slice onion when I added the water.  Next time I would brown the meat and before adding the water I would remove most if not all of the oil, otherwise this was fork tender and the gravy was excellent.

I thought this was extremely good!  After seasoning them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, I dredged the cube steaks through flour and browned them in the oil.  I then took another reviewers suggestion and put them in a crockpot with sliced onions and minced garlic and 3 cups of beef broth.  I let them cook for 4 hours on low.  They were so tender!  I then strained the broth and used that to mix with two brown gravy packets, put the meat mixture back in crockpot on high and poured the gravy mixture back in.  I let that cook for about 1/2 hour while stirring and then let it sit on warm.  It turned out fantastic.  We served it over wide egg noodles.  Great recipe!  (I then had it for lunch two more days!)

I did tweek this just a bit.  I use garlic roasted mushroom soup mixed with water to pour over the meat after browning.  I also baked the steak at 325. Gravy over potatoes is amazing!

I have made this recipe a couple of times now.  Once on top of stove and once in the oven and it is great either way. Comes out so very tender that even the 90yo lady I take care of can eat it without problems. Am making it tonight and I added some onion this time and used beef broth instead of adding water. Will have fresh green beans and mashed potatoes to go along with.  Thanks for a very good and tender cube steak recipe.

With respect to the author, this didn't turn out like I hoped.  Another reviewer has given good ideas to fix this, using a wine sauce and reducing the cooking time...I'll probably try that next time.

I took the advice of some of the others, and after browning the cube steaks I sauteed some onions and fresh mushrooms in the skillet.  I added 2 T. Amish beef base and 1 1/2 cups of water to the onions/mushrooms and simmered them about 5 minutes before pouring it over the cube steaks in a casserole dish.  Baked at 325 for about an hour and a half, then took the steaks out and added about 2 T. flour to the juice to make a nice onion/mushroom gravy.  Very tender and flavorful, but glad I took them out at 90 minutes.  I think 2 hours would have made them too dry.  Very nice way to do something different with a normally ho-hum cut of meat.  Thanks for the recipe and to the other reviewers for their suggestions.  Will definitely make again!

I added onions and mushrooms and baked it for 2 hours...it was the BEST cubed steak I have ever made! My son loves cube steak and usually uses a knife to cut it up but this recipes makes the cube steaks so tender that a knife isn't needed! Easy and delicious!

I've been able to make a tender cube steak, but the flavor was never there.   I'd pretty much given up on cube steak but decided to try this recipe.     This was great.   I did sub beef stock for the granules but all else as the same.   It was the best and very flavorful.   I made gravy out of the juice and served it up with mashed potatoes.  Yummy.

First let me say- not a fan of cube steak.  In the past I would  make it for family and eat something else.  However, this recipe made it taste pretty good.  Still not a fan of the texture, but it was more tender than I have had in the past.  I had no beef bouillon so  just used beef broth.

I used Montreal seasoning instead of salt and pepper. I also carmalized 1 small onion before I pan fried the cube steaks. This was very good. I made mashed potatoes and peas to go along with it.

The cube steaks were perfectly tender in 60 minutes  I added sliced onions and used chicken Better Than Bullion because I had it.  Very reminiscent of my mom's cube steak.  Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Didn't use milk for the gravy;  just added corn starch to thicken the pan juices.  I think the complaints of meat turning out too dry and water boiling away can be easily corrected by turning the heat down;  start checking for tenderness in an hour.

Easy and delicious! I do add 1/4 cup of red wine and a pack of onion soup mix to the gravy but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. Very tender and the whole family loves it.

This was good.  The meat was not as tender as hoped, but that could have been a bad cut, or the fact that it was not 100% thawed when I began cooking it.  I used much less oil that called for--maybe 1-2 tbsp.

Family loved this! Easy too! Just for a bit of extra flavor, I used garlic salt instead of regular. Simmered for 1 hour, still fabulous.

My husband and I love this recipe. Making it tonight with the addition of onion, sliced mushrooms and a few garlic cloves cut up. Easy and economical. A great way to use an inexpensive cut of meat. I also use broth instead of cubes to cut down on the salt. I feel if you want more salt add it on your plate.

Excellent. I twisted the recipe a bit. I make the cube steaks as directed in the pan, put them into my casserole dish, Make the gravy in the pan then I pour it over the steaks, put a little mushrooms on top , cover and baked at 325 for 2 hours. My kids (2 & 5 ) are very picky eaters , they love this! Big hit in our family!

Very good. I sauted some onions and garlic and added to the gravy mixture and also added a packet of dry onion soup mix. Because the gravy was too thick I added just a bit of water to thin it out. This recipe is a winner.

Excellent..Paid close attention to reviewers' opinions.  Everyone loved it. I tried it both ways:  in the oven and on top of the stove.  The oven was more tender.  On stop of the stove was more tasteful

Very easy to make - sauteed a sliced onion, mushrooms chunks, parsley and basil flakes in olive oil then added meat to brown.  Added water then (2) beef bouillon cubes.  Gravy was so good with smashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Meat was not chewy at all!

This was OK, about like you might get in a small town diner, but the gravy was too watery and the meat too tasteless.

Following the suggestion of others I browned and then baked at 325 for 1.5 hrs.  To coat I used a double dip method of egg, then seasoned flour and repeat. To make sure I had enough liquid  I created a thin gravey in the pan I browned the meat, poured it over the browned meat then I added more water to the baking dish during the last 1/2 hour.  Huge success the meat eaters in the house loved it. Thank you this was a great find.

I used this to make flour tacos. I made this with a really thin, really cheap cut of meat, and it turned out so delicious everyone thought I used brisket! It was a bit salty, but not so salty the tortillas/rice we used couldn't redeem it.

This was delicious! I floured and cooked about 6 steaks for 3 minutes on each side, then added two cups of water in which two beef bouillon cubes had been dissolved. I added a little Worcestershire sauce and a sliced onion. I only simmered for one hour and the meat was so tender and delicious!

I floured and browned the steaks in butter and added sliced onion to the pan. Instead of bullion, I mixed a can of beefy mushroom soup with water and poured over steak after it was browned. simmered for about an hour. I didn't have to thicken the gravy, there was enough flour on the meat to do it.
 I  rated the original recipe a 3 because I changed it so much and I couldn't post this without some kind of rating.

I was looking for something easy and no hassle to make, at my witts end with all the normal stuff I make for supper..this was great, prep was quick and easy, was able to leave it to cook while at one of my childrens sports functions. I used beef broth instead of water and thickened it with corn starch, I forgot about making the gravy with flour, but I will try that next time..We ate it with rice, however I think it would have been better with mashed potatoes...will make again, steak super tender and yummy..family loved!!

Believe the hype!!!  
 I made this meal for my family of picky eaters and the pot was scraped clean.  The meat was so tender it was falling apart, but believe me not a forkful was left on their plates.

I followed another viewers advice and cooked in the oven for 1 1/2 hours.  It was tender but bland and I even put onion rings in it for added flavor.  Will not make again.

Very simple and easy.  I have another recipe that's similar, but simmering the meat for so long is key.  It made my embarassingly old cube steaks fork tender.  The only thing I did different was use an electric fry pan and used venison cube steaks.  I also made gravy out of the bits left in the pan.  My kids loved it!

I give this 5 stars because it is the BEST cube steak I have ever had!  It was so very tender and I even served it after only about 1 and 1/2 hours of simmering.  Some might say it need doctoring for flavor, but my family really likes the mild flavor, we don't like onions, or heavy seasonings. I loved it, so did my family.  The only thing I might add next time would be cream of mushroom soup instead of beef broth for a change.

Was very good and tender.  I used Lipton Beefy Onion soup and had to add more water to keep the meat mosit.  Once the meat was done I removed it from the pan and then added some corn starch dissolved in water to the gravy to thicken it up a bit.

I've made this recipe twice now, and it has already become an "old standby."  I will be making it for years to come.  One hint--if you don't stock beef boullion granules, you can substitute beef stock for some of the water.

This is  super easy, extremely tasty way of cooking cube steak!  I did add an onion and also added a bit of extra flour at the end to thicken the sauce a little!  My husband loved it!

Excellent dish!  Tender, delicious!!  I tenderizesd the meat by mallet.  Seasoned with garlic salt and pepper.  Added mushrooms and onions and after frying the meat, baked it in the oven at 325 degrees for 2 hours, covered with aluminum foil like Carianne did.  Out of site!!  And I didn't even do the gravy.

This was just okay for us.  I cooked for a longer than it was supposed to cook.  Probably another hour worth so I could get my other dishes finished.  It was incredibly soft, but the gravy wasn't thick enough and it wasn't that tasty.  I might make again.

Excellent recipe!  It turned tough cube steak into a tender flavorful dish similar to pot roast.  I seasoned my flour with cajun seasoning and added some worcestershire sauce to the broth.

I loved how tender it made the meat. The flavor was pretty good too. I used chicken bullion instead of beef.

followed directions - it was terrible!  Plain hamburgers taste better.
