This was very good.  My mom used to make the brandy slush with steeped tea bags and I thought I would try this for her visit.  I changed it up a bit.  I used Raspberry Vodka instead of the Cherry Brandy because I don't really like brown liquor.  I also used about 20 oz of frozen lemonade and the called for 16 oz OJ.  Next time I make I'm going to use 24 oz. Frozen lemonade and only 12 oz frozen OJ. I like the lemon flavor better than the orange.  We drank this with Diet 7-Up and it was great for a hot day!

This is an excellent slush recipe. I was looking for something other than my standard brandy slush (with tea bags) or frozen Margarita slush to serve at a party. This was a hit! I had many requests for the recipe. It is a delicious combination of sweet/tart and very refreshing. I've already put another batch in the freezer for my superbowl party! Thanks Susanne!

Oh my, is this ever good! I made this for a holiday get-together using a black cherry bourbon instead of brandy. I put a tub of this in the freezer on the porch....big mistake, even though it was frigid outside that's where all my guests were! A big hit!

Simply delicious! We use cran-raspberry or some other cran combo of juice. Love it! It is so versatile. We've used blackberry brandy when we couldn't find cherry brandy. I've used all different kinds of frozen concentrate juices instead of lemonade, though they're always red. I do use the orange juice called for in the recipe. So much easier than the old fashioned way of making slush! My family always looks forward to this at my house so I not only make it at Christmas (which is my family's tradition) but I now make it for other holiday gatherings as well. I make a triple batch so it takes several days for it to become slushy!

I didn't have the frozen concentrates, so made this w/ brandy, cranberry, orange & lemonade juices + a splash of Fresca.  YUM!!!  You don't even taste the alcohol, but it packs a punch!

Fantastic! If you are looking for that perfect adult beverage for your next summertime gathering, then look no further.  This is the perfect balance of sweet, tart, and overall deliciousness. I made exactly as written except that the frozen juice concentrate only come in 12 ounces and not 16 like the recipe calls for. All other alcoholic slush's I have made in the past come out of the freezer a solid rock and you have to play the waiting game while they are thawing. Not this one. It comes out of the freezer the perfect consistency and you can serve it right away. I can't say enough about this recipe. It's got enough bite to it that it's not overly candy tasting. If I cold give this 10 stars I would.
