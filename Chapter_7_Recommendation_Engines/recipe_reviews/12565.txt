I cut the recipe in half and didn't add the lemon juice but it still came out very good. Never thought of using flour tortillas in that way.

This was a really good recipe and very versatile. Use any fruit you would use in a pie or cobbler. We used peaches. And the one thing about recipes is you can adjust things to your taste. It doesn't mean it is a bad recipe. In other words if you like your sweets less sweet than most then just cut down the sugar. Don't berate the recipe for being sweet if it is a dessert. Just adjust to your tastes. This is a keeper.
