This was absolutely delicious!  It would have been fine as is, but I doubled it to stuff my 16lb turkey and added one cup of shredded cranberries (lef-overs from a mold I made) and a handful of white raisins.  I had a ton of compliments and didn't have any left-overs.  I wish I had made more so I could have had the left-vers too!

This recipe seems too simple to be good, but I've made it the last two Thanksgivings and the family loved it. I used Pepperidge Farms packaged stuffing in the past, but I plan to make the bread mixture from scratch this time around. It will be a small improvement over an already tasty stuffing.

Very nice!!!!! The stuffing was used in the turkey and came out looking very grose based on the kind of stuffing mix I used, but was very tasty with the apples and pecans. I also added raisins and celery which gave it a little more flavor.

This was a real,'pass the dish please"
My in-laws were asking for the recipe!
Needless to say,I think we'll be using it as our stuffing instead of a side dish.

i used almonds instead, and it was GREAT.  the stuffing in the bird did look kinda gross but it tasted sooooo good.  The stuffing i made outside the bird was good too but not as mushy.  the flavors blended very well.  I chopped the almonds fine and it was a good texture with the soft apples.

I tried this recipe with chicken last night and must say that it is very tasty indeed. The nutty flavour of pecans softened by apples is truly unique. Try this recipe for yourself.

A basic simple recipe.  Not too much extra flavor aside from the bread, apples and pecans.

I really enjoyed the addition of the apples, but a few of my guests said they prefered regular old stuffing.  So I say use this recipe if your party is bored with regular stuffing.

This produces a good tasting result, though unremarkable.  More could be added to increase the flavor, so this is a good starting point.  It certainly is an easy option, and I bet it would be better if cooked inside a bird to get some yummy flavor from that.  Thanks for the idea of this.

I made this to take to a Thanksgiving dinner at the church and it seemed really dry.  I'm not sure why mine was dry when everyone else talked about theirs being mushy but I wouldn't make it again.  I thought there were way too many apples in it.

Very tasty! I used cornbread stuffing mix made with onions and celery.  I find the cornbread gives it a distinctive flavor. I liked the combination with apples and pecans.  Everyone gave it a thumbs up.

I stuffed my turkey with this recipe.  I don't know if the taste makes up for the look.  My husband liked it, so that is the most important.  It wasn't what I was hoping for.  Maybe, if I had used the cubed stuffing..it wouldn't have been so mushy.

this was okay. using the store-bought stuffing mix was easy, but I wasn't sure whether to add celery and onion like the package said. I thought it basically tasted like regular stuffing with some apples added (couldn't taste the pecans at all)-which is really what it was. I was looking for something more. but it tasted fine for what it was-everyone ate it.

Very good and so simple.  I used Stove Top and then added the pecans and apples.  My family loved it...when they asked how I made it, they were totally surprised to learn that it started from Stove Top.

I only gave 4 stars, because I didn't actually use this recipe to a T. I did, however use this one and another one to make an awesome combo. Thanks for the idea of using Pecans and apples. My husband asked me to leave the apples out, but I'm glad I didn't listen. Absolutely wonderful!! I don't even like stuffing, and I ate a big spoonful. Got great reviews from the Thanksgiving tabel. Thanks again.

This is really such a simple yet versatile stuffing recipe - great for those who don't want to put too much effort into the prep work that goes into stuffing.  Next time I made add sausage for some extra flavor.  Be sure not to over cook or it will become too dry and separated (vs. crunchy on the top and moist beneath).

Super yummy and it had a nice crunch. I used Granny Smith apples for a bit of tartness and added a 1/3 c crancherries. The family loved that it added flavor to bland turkey and mashed potatoes.
