Very good, but next time I will try only using half the brown sugar and adding more if I need it.  Using a full cup over powered the coconut taste.

This sauce is really good.  I actually served it with chicken breaded in pecan meal and it was delicious.  Really sweet, so a little goes a long way.  Will make again!!

This is a good start but it is way too sweet.  I will use half the sugar next time and may even go to a white sugar.  I think half the brown sugar would be fine but it also turns the sauce brown which is a little strange for coconut sauce.  If that does not taste good I will go back to the brown.  All of the sweetness takes away from the coconut flavor.

Per the others' reviews, I slowly added the brown sugar as needed. I used the coconut sauce to top the Biko (Pilipino rice-based dessert), also found on Allrecipes, and it was delicious! Thank you for another wonderful recipe, Lola!

Very tasty,  I agree about adding sugar, better to start out with less. Had it over chicken and rice, my first time cooking it.
