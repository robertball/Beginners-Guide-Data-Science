I liked this easy casserole and the family raved about it.  I added cooked sausage, used cheddar cheese instead of the Monterrey jack, fresh cooked spinach squeezing the water out and fresh cooked mushrooms.  Because it was denser, I did have to cook it approximately 15 minutes longer but the knife test proved reliable.

I made this recipe as written.......the family loved it. My older son has gone meatless, so I was looking for a new breakfast bake. This does need to be baked for longer than 35 minutes. I started at that but it was way to runny. I believe I baked it close to 50 minutes. Just keep an eye on it the first time you make it and make your own time adjustments. Thanks

I made this ...the only change I did was saute the baby bella packaged mushrooms with garlic, onions, and olive oil...I sliced the onions finely though....and added fresh spinach and put it to the side until it was ready to mix into the egg mixture...it was in the oven for 40 mins or until I did the knife test... it turned out delicious. i appreciate this recipe..Thank you!

Made this for brunch first time around and everyone raved about it! Made it again this weekend and I realized that I forgot the flour the first time around. Actually liked the flour-less version better! Both times I cooked this dish for much longer- I'd say 45-50 minutes until the top was nicely browned. Needless to say, this is a very easy and very forgiving dish ;)

This recipe couldn't be easier. I used fresh spinach, added chopped turkey sausage, and sautéed onions so that I have a complete breakfast in one dish, which I then eat for breakfast during the work week. I also used low fat shreded cheese and low fat cottage cheese - came out famously!

Wasn't sure what to expect.   Turned out fluffy and rich.  I really enjoyed it.  Used fresh  spinach and mushrooms, sautéed and chopped them.  Didn't have 16 Oz of shredded cheese,  so I used 8 Oz of cheddar/jack  and it was plenty.   Nice alternative to heavier breakfast casseroles.  Will make again.

Just finished preparing this for the second time. Prep is super quick with easy to find, inexpensive ingredients. My whole family loves it - even the ones who aren't crazy about mushrooms. It cooks very evenly and stays moist and fluffy. If you have leftovers, it's even better the next day.

My 12 year old son loves this the most, we all do! It's perfect to make with kids. The minor tweaks we made were 8 oz of fresh mushrooms instead of canned, colby/jack blend because I couldn't find just jack pre-shredded and BEST was 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup, our first attempt was a bit greasy. Didn't miss the butter at all! Yummy!!

Took half of all the proportions. It seemed like there was not enough liquid to coat mushroom and spinach, so I added 1/4 cup of milk and that did the trick. A little too much cheese to my preference, used about half of what the recipe asks. Family loved it so will be making it again!

Giving 5 stars but did make some lower fat reductions and it is still a delicious dish. I used only 8oz cheese., cheddar. Also 2% cottage cheese, 1/4 cup flour. 1/4 cup butter. And I used 8 oz fresh sliced mushrooms. Still great, with less fat and plenty of taste. I've made it about 3 times now. Freeze leftovers.

This is delicious.  For a low fat version I just left out the butter, sprayed the pan with olive oil and only used half the cheese.

I make this for every staff meeting, as it is always requested.  I ALWAYS use fresh mushrooms and saute them with a little sweet onion before adding them to the recipe.  I can never find just monterey jack cheese, so I use colby/jack shredded cheese.  It gets rave reviews!

So easy to make and very flavorful! I made it for a light dinner with a side of brown rice. Sliced, fresh mushrooms were substituted for canned. I assembled all of the ingredients ahead of time and let it "marinate" in the fridge. The fresh mushrooms soaked up any additional moisture. I will definitely make this again!
UPDATE 2.28.2018. We continue to make this. It's a family favorite!  Sliced, raw baby portabella mushrooms and sharp cheddar really add a lovely flavor! YUM!

Another breakfast winner! Great when you have vegetarians to feed.  The cottage cheese and butter make it extra good.  I used fresh mushrooms which I first cooked slightly in the microwave.  Also used all lactose-free milk and cottage cheese products and it was delicious.  Though it doesn't say to, you could make this the day before to have ready to just pop in the oven in the morning.

I hope chefs read these comments:   BAKE IT FOR AT LEAST 50 MINUTES!!         (I'm typing this as I sit here late for Bible study brunch because it was a soupy mess after 35 minutes so it's back in the oven.)

This was a great vegetarian casserole to accommodate my guests.  Because I  didn't read the directions correctly prior to grocery shopping, I only used 8 oz of monterey jack and added a little sharp cheddar to try to make up for it. I used fresh rather than canned shrooms and did not use the 1/2 cup of butter that was called for because it seemed like it would be good without; And it was! Does more butter make everything better? Absolutely! But I'm telling you, it was great without it too. :)

This was sooo good!  I used fresh spinach and mushrooms, sauteed the  mushrooms in a little olive oil and then just the the spinach on top, covered it all and let the spinach wilt a little. I also reduced the amount of butter.  Delicious.

Didn't use quite as much cheese and didn't use mushrooms, but came out super super good! Very moist. Sometimes eggs can dry out when baked but this was great.

I used 12 ounces of fresh mushrooms and cooked them first. I used fresh spinach and wilted it first as well. I added a big squirt of Dijon mustard also. I only used 1/4 cup of flour and no butter at all. I also added one pound of cooked sausage. I used the same 9 x 13 dish and it filled to within 1/2 inch of top. I had to bake mine for about 50 minutes but in any case, longer than 35. When done, I sprinkled some panko crumbs on top and some shaved parmesan and stuck under broiler until just melted. My wife loved it and it was very good. I only include this review to give others ideas. I normally hate it when people change the given recipe but maybe they are like me. A recipe is just the first brick, let me finish the wall.

Wow, even a mediocre cook like myself was able to make an AWESOME breakfast!    Was clearing out the fridge and found this recipe.  I used fresh spinach, mushrooms, and onion (2 small diced). Sauteed all of them, made a bed of hash browns on the bottom of a pan (cooked a little first).  Used 8 eggs, that's all I had.  Per other reviews, halved the flour and butter.   Made this right in the stovetop pan (oven safe, of course) and put some sliced tomatoes on top - again, cleaning out the fridge:-)  Didn't have cottage cheese so just used cheddar, about 1/2 c parmesan, and some shredded mexican blend.    See what I mean - I made all those changes based on what I had on hand and it was still AWESOME!

I absolutely love this recipe!  It’s no low fat, but it gets such raves when I bring it for a brunch. I think the secret is the flour and baking powder. I did make a couple of adjustments....use 3 tablespoons of flour instead of a half cup, use fresh spinach sautéed with a little onion or leek. The last time I made it, I used a can of drained and chopped artichoke hearts instead of mushrooms. I also add a teaspoon of dry thyme and about a half teaspoon of dry nutmeg. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Made a few minor changes by cutting butter to 1/4 cup, and adding 1/2 onion, diced and 3 garlic cloves, diced. Like most other reviewers, it needed more time to bake as the center was still loose after 35 minutes. I baked it for a total of 50 minutes at 350 degrees, and then increased oven temp to 400 degrees for an additional 7 minutes. This gave it a nice golden brown top and a slight firmness around the edges. The knife tip to test doneness worked perfectly.  Extremely simple recipe that produced a very flavorful casserole. I made a grande breakfast burrito from one of 8 slices, and it was excellent. Thank you Karen for sharing your 5* recipe!

Turned out great! I didn't have the cheese it called for so I used half cheddar and half Edam with the cottage cheese. I also added extra egg and chopped onion.

This is a great breakfast casserole that I make while we are camping in our motorhome.  Everyone raves about it, I add different vegetables here and there.

Very yummy! I did sauté 3 minced garlic cloves and sliced fresh mushrooms in a little olive oil before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients. Loved the texture and taste.

I made this for a brunch this morning. Instead of mushrooms, I used a mixture of onions and green, yellow and red peppers. Cooked for a total of 1 hour. Came out delicious and everyone loved it.

This was good. I didn't like it quite as much as a leftover. Maybe because I microwaved it. Still worth making. Next time I'll just make what we need or heat up leftovers in the oven.

I'm not a cook. I needed something simple.  This was easy and my wife said it was a winner!
I tweaked as others by adding fresh spinach, mushrooms and bell pepper.  I fried bacon and added some leftover hambits.  The cook time was about 50 minutes at 350.

Excellent! As many have said, I used 1/2 the melted butter, it was perfect...not greasy. I sautéed the mushrooms with garlic and onion, red, green and orange peppers. Cooked about 50 mins until light brown on top. Delicious!

We only had 8oz of Monterey Jack and it was obvious in the finished casserole - it was fluffy and looked great but was a bit on the bland side.  I'm sure if I had the full 16oz of cheese it would have made a difference;  definitely will make this again.  Cooking time was closer to 50 min.

Had to make 1/2 of this for just my husband & I.  (Just adjust the ingredients to match 4 servings here on the same page as recipe).  Used a 9X9X2 square glass baking dish.  Other changes made:  Used Feta cheese & Mexican shredded cheese, with a bit of Parmesan sprinkled on the top before baking, which added a nice flavor and a slight crust on top; used 6 eggs; added 1/3 c. of almond milk; used fresh spinach--sauteed with about 4 shallots, several garlic cloves, & mushrooms in olive oil; used 4 TBS butter; added some nutmeg and thyme; used 1/4 c. of gluten-free flour; baked in convection oven for 24 minutes at 350.  Served this with a dollop of sour cream--wonderful!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  This is so much easier than making a quiche!

I love this recipe. Makes 8 big squares i take to work re heated with a cup of coffee in the factory. Nothin better. I like that its spinach on its own without feta. I like that you make a big mess to add or subtract ingredients. A great base recipe.

THe only change I made was to use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.   I sautéed the mushrooms with onion and added it with the other ingredients.  If you do this allow extra cook ing time as th took a extra 20 minutes.  It was excellent.  I served it Easter morning and got rave reviews from my guests. This is a keeper!!

I needed to bring something highly portable and gluten free to a last minute brunch and took a chance with this, and am glad I did. I followed the recipe except I sauteed 8 ounces of fresh baby bellas with  two 5-ounce bags of fresh baby spinach, along with a little bit of chopped sweet onion before putting into egg mixture. I also substituted sharp cheddar for the monterey jack and GF flour, used  4 percent cottage cheese, and sprayed the dish with Pam rather than greasing with butter. Baked for 35 minutes and checked it and gave it another 7 minutes. Took it out, zipped it into my pyrex food carrier/warmer and it was still hot when I arrived at the party 30 minutes later. Looked good too.

I really enjoyed this recipe, although I made several changes. I didn't feel that the flour and baking powder were necessary, as I prefer a less quiche-like casserole, so I left those out. I used fresh, baby Portabella mushrooms and sauteed them in butter with about 1/2 cup of a chopped yellow onion. I also used 1/2 Monterey Jack cheese and 1/2 sharp Cheddar cheese. It was a delicious addition to our Christmas breakfast and didn't need any meat but I will make it again with ham or sausage for variety.

I did make some adjustments because I am gluten free, but all i did was add a gluten free flour that replaces regular flour and add chunks of fresh onion and fresh mushrooms. It was a hit!

I did make some changes, but I will definitely make this again!  Quiches used to be my go-to when preparing brunch for guests, but the whipping cream is too rich for me.   This was a superb substitute!  I used fresh mushrooms that I sautéed in advance, as well as chopped frozen spinach that I removed excess water from by cooking it down in butter.   Additionally, I added cooked sausage.  Lots of compliments from my guests, and I can't wait to eat the leftovers!  This will definitely be in the rotation in the future.    Oh, and for the "sweet" part of my brunch, I made the Mango Cardamon bread pudding found on this site as a "French-toast"- like dish.   Paired together this made a great meal!

This recipe accommodates lots of variations.  I didn't have frozen spinach or cottage cheese, and didn't use butter but it still came out great!  I only had fresh spinach so I used about 1 1/2 cups.  Then I added 3/4 cups of diced onion, a little bit of sauteed mushrooms,  cup of shredded jack cheese, package of breakfast sausage, and a 1/4 cup of non-fat milk.  I loved that I could throw it in the oven and bake it.  I let it cool then cut it into about 10 slices and put them into snack baggies so I can grab and take them to work.

This is a great recipe!  Thank you!  I sauteed  a little onion, garlic, fresh mushrooms and spinach with butter in a pan ahead of time, then added all of that to the egg/cottage cheese mixture. I cut back on the 1/2 cup butter then, since I knew I had already sauteed the veggies in butter.  It turned out delicious and even my 11 year old approved!  I made a second pan to cut into pieces and freeze for a quick protein-filled breakfast on the run.

This was absolutely delicious "but" I did change it up a bit because I didn't have cottage cheese or Monterey Jack.  I switched it up with sharp cheddar, mozzarella, cooked pork sausage, greased the pan with olive oil but added the butter, flour and everything else on the recipe.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder and topped it with freshly ground pepper and more sharp cheddar cheese.  I cooked it on convection which was to perfection.   A dollop of sour cream to top it off made it just delightful!  It was really fun being able to tweek this recipe.  Definitely will make again and again!

This is a crowd pleaser!! Everyone loved it at my brunch. Used fresh spinach and mushrooms and added pork sausage. Threw in a couple more eggs too. Made it the night before and it reheated beautifully. I will definitely make this again!

A great lunch time recipe although it's a bit much for 2 people.  I had to cut recipe down to 1/4.  I added hebenro cheese shredded and some pico de gallo to give it some zip.  Good stuff with a Chardenay!

Great recipe, very versatile. I made this similar to other posters... used fresh mushrooms and spinach sauteed in garlic flavored ollve oil, skipped butter, used only 1/4 cup of flour, 1-1/2  cups of cheese (co-jack). I can imagine many different ways to make this... it's one of those recipes where you can use what is in the fridge that needs using up.

Wonderful and easy recipe.  Moist and creamy....I'm convinced it was the cottage cheese that did this.  Like other reviewers suggested, I sautéed fresh mushrooms and spinach. And, because I love veggies, I added onion and a few tomatoes.  Be sure to drain this sautéed mixture before adding to the egg mixture.  Yummy and a repeat recipe for sure.

Easy and DELICIOUS.  I made as written except for the fresh spinach and mushrooms which I sauteed in garlic butter before adding to the egg mixture.  I estimate that I used at least a pound of fresh spinach and 12 oz of fresh mushrooms which shrinks when cooked.  My Bible study ladies all want the recipe ( I told them it's a 5-star recipe and they say it's a 6-star) and I will be sharing it.  I will make it again for this Sunday's church potluck.  This is a real keeper!

Should have left the flour out of it. 
This turned out more like a cornbread egg casserole.

This was a nice dish. I could have gone without the cottage cheese (not a fan) though. To me it just got lost in the dish.

Very good casserole!   Simple to prepare and rose nicely!   Tasty and good presentation too.      I used fresh mushrooms which I sautéed beforehand.      Based on the comments I read in advance of making this dish,  I did cut flour in half and used a little less cheese.  I don't know if the reduction in flour and cheese made a difference or not.  The dish was delicious and I will make it again adding other veggies!

I made a couple of changes. Sauteed some onion with fresh mushrooms and added fresh spinach as well. Drained well and added that to the egg mixture. Also added a little bit of red pepper for a little kick. Delicious. Will definitely make again.

I used fresh spinach and mushrooms without cooking ahead a time.  I was afraid  it would be to watery with fresh (traditionally watery) vegetables, but it was perfect (after turning up the heat a little and leaving in the oven a little longer)

use real mushrooms instead of canned and sautee these in olive oil and garlic.  Also took closer to one hour to bake.  Yummy!

I made this Christmas morning, I made it exactly as written and I loved it but next time, I will tweak it a bit. It would be great with some chopped up bell peppers or something with a little bit of tang.

Love the base flavors of this dish. My modifications included using half of the Jack cheese suggested, adding sauted red bell pepper and onion, and cutting the amount of spinach (I cooked up what I had of fresh spinach). Easily adaptable, which makes this recipe even better in my book!

This was an excellent casserole alternative to those with sausage or bacon. I followed recipe as stated and didn't have any problems. Before putting it in the oven, I sprinkled diced red pepper on top to make it look more "Christmasy".  I did cook it a little longer but that may have been due to several other items in the oven at same time. The knife test worked great. Everyone loved it.

I like this because it's much lighter than our usual frittatas.  I sauteed fresh spinach with half chopped onion, used fresh mushrooms, and added a bit of tarragon and 3 chopped veggie italian sausages from Trader Joe's.  Bit hit for Hanukkah brunch with latkes and fruit salad.

I used the  basic recipe, but I used different fillings.  I used sausage, spinach, and feta cheese.  It was wonderful!  Fluffy, light, and flavorful!
