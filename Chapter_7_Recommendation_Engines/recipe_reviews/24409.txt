Awesome recipe.  Took more time than indicated on recipe though.  Give yourself a good hour and a half once you start putting it all together.  Used chicken breasts and boiled them alone.  Used italian sausage, baking it in the oven at 325 degrees for about 45 minutes.  Did cook the chicken and sausage the day before and refrigerated as suggested.  Added 1/2 pound of fresh, pre-cooked shrimp with the meat.  Flavor is mild enough that there is a kick but won't send you running for the water.  If you like your food hot I would add more spices.

This recipe is unbelievable!!! I make it for my husband & usually within a day or two he has completely polished it off (by himself!!!). The only suggestion I can offer is to make this a little easier and faster, I've never stewed the chicken. I will just take cooked chicken breasts & combine everything at once.

Absolutely delicious!  I've always loved jambalaya, but never thought it could be so easy to make.  Now I make it on a regular basis, my husband and I enjoy it very much.  Since neither of us like sausage I use raw deveined shrimp, and toss them in during the rice cooking stage.

This is the PERFECT for someone who hasn't cooked cajun food before. It provides an excelent Jambalaya base which stands on its own very well. Also, and perhapse more importantly, it gives you a nice general recipie to build off of and create your own dishes with whatever's around. Tons of fun!

This is a winner.  It took me about 1 1/2 hours from start to finish.  I used chicken breast, Eckridge beef smoked sausage, and added shrimp at the end.  I had only tomato sauce rather than paste and it worked out just fine.  I also used about a cup and a half of rice and increased the stock accordingly.  I don't think you can mess this one up - just stick with the basic recipe and add or delete spices as you like.  I added salt and pepper and a few shakes of creole seasoning.  I'll be making this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cook a lot of different types of Jambalaya (vegetarian, spicy, pasta, etc.) and this is a very good recipe. I used chicken cutlets; browned them (on both sides with a little bit of the spices from the recipe), cut them into chunks, and added them for the last 15-25 minutes of cooking.

Worth the time and effort. This recipe makes quite a bit, so I freeze half for later. We have served this to a crowd with rave reviews. Be sure to cook the rice long enough, I found that it took much longer than the recipe stated.

This has become a regular in our home! Make it with Healthy Choice sausage, and it's delicious AND healthy. I always substitute one green bell pepper for a red one, stir in a pound of pre-cooked shrimp during the last few minutes of cooking, and stir in generous amounts of Texas Pete hot sauce. Substitue Rotel for canned tomatoes for more of a kick. Yum! A meal in itself, unless I'm serving more than two, and then corn muffins (with jalapeno) and gumbo are a perfect match!

This is great. I added some salt and pepper and a lot more hot sauce! Served with "Rory's Most Wonderful Corn Bread" recipe from this site. Both were a hit.

Excellent!

It was a last minute decision to make this, so I didn't boil the chicken. Instead, I cut up boneless, skinless breasts and pan fried them with andouille sausage in some olive oil. Before doing that, I sprinkled them with some cajun seasoning. I used red, yellow, and green peppers (leftovers from the previous night's meal) which gave it a lot of color. I omitted the tomato paste and it still tasted great. I used brown rice in place of white, and I used chicken bouillon since I didn't make any homemade broth. Great dish.

I wish I could give higher than 5 stars. I've made this several times and each time its just incredible.  My husband doesnt like seafood so I leave the recipe as is. I made it for my parents and they loved it. My mom has requested that I make this for our next family reunion.

I made this for my family on Fat Tuesday.  Since we were short on time during that busy weeknight, I made the rice separately, which significatly reduced the cooking time. It was delicious and we will make this dish again.

This was good but just didn't wow me.  I made just as is written and be very prepared for spicy.  I like spicy but some of my Super Bowl guests were not as high on it. It was just too spicy for some.  Have some cold, cold beer ready to quench the fire!

I sauteed the veggies with six diced bacon strips and added a ladle of broth at the end of the cooking time, which I feel made a flavorful addition to the recipe.  I had red, yellow and orange peppers on hand and they added a wonderful color to the dish.  I only used 1 1/2 onions as the ratio of onions to peppers didn't seem right, maybe my onions were too big.  I also used almost twice the spices (we like spicy food) and added about about a tablespoon of cumin for more of a smoky flavor.  I also added the chicken and sausage (used the spicy smoked kind) when the veggie and broth came to a slow boil and let it simmer with the meat in.  I think it added more flavor to the meat.  I recommend cooking the rice separate and using the chicken broth to cook it in.  I added another bay leaf to the broth to cook the rice and everything turned out phenomenal!  Definitely will cook this again!

I was actually looking for a way to use up left over seafood, from a low country boil, when I came across this recipe.  It was just what we were looking for.  I added an extra can of diced tomatoes, since I was increasing the amount of meat, and added extra the spices to make up for it, and then added the seafood at the end.  I realized later that I had forgotten the tomato paste.  I tasted it before the seafood and thought it was just wonderful, so we can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!!!

I followed the recipe pretty closely and it turned out great and was so easy to throw together!  I altered the recipe slightly by using boneless chicken breasts and chicken sausage and also threw in shrimp while the rice cooked (as suggested by another reviewer). I do like it spicier so next time I will increase the spice factor a few notches.  Great, easy recipe and I will definitely be adding this to my repertoire.!  Thanks!

Perfect amount of spice for the kids. Not enough for me, but nothing a little hot sauce couldn't take care of. Good flavor though and very easy. I added 1# of shrimp at the very end.

Tasty dish.  I didn't have any green peppers so I used red and yellow...this added a sweeter flavor than I was going for so I will try the green next time.  I added a handful of shrimp at the end.  The dish could use a bit more salt, depending on your taste.  Will definitely make this again!

This is, hands down, the best jambalaya recipe I've made.  I have been making this one for a few months now (just realized I never reviewed it).  It is WELL worth the time it takes to prepare.  I never measure my spices and this dish allows me to do just that.  I sometimes add in more rice, counter that with more fresh stock.  More cajun seasoning, less cayenne, whatever we are in the mood for that day.  It is also a relatively cheap meal if you consider how much food it makes (again, sometimes using more rice than called for).  Leftovers are fantastic with a little broth splashed in while reheating.  Pair this with some cornbread and you've got some full kids with warm bellies. :-)

I have made this so many times and it is wonderful!! My husband requests it over and over. A few changes: I add a jalapeno pepper to the sauce, I use boneless skinless chicken breast, polska kielbasa, and shrimp. Also I make the rice seperately and serve the Jambalaya over it. I'm not a big fan of making the rice in the dish for fear it may become to mushy. Enjoy!

i had a few changed to this recipe, due to what was in my pantry.  i halfed the recipe.  Used a lil cayenne pepper instead of chili powder, omitted worcestershire, didnt have paste so i used a small can of tomatoe sauce, 1 half a large green jalepeno, and 6 healthy shakes of hot creole seasoning.  since i halfed the recipe it all came out delicious and perfect texture.  Leftovers get spicier, be warned!

My husband doesn't like Jumbalya, but after I served this he said, "This is really good...What is it?" Works for me. I made up a new name and he now eats Jumbalaya regularly ;).

My result tasted ok, but it didn't have that jambalaya taste I was hoping for so I am not giving this a high rating. It tasted more like some other kind of stew. Also took a bit longer than expected to prepare and was better with added salt and extra spices. Will probably not make this again as I am wanting to make jambalaya!

This recipe is very good. I agree with the other reviewers who said that there needs to be some extra spices. I added fresh oregano, fresh thyme,paprika, cracked pepper, sea salt, and parsley. Just for fun, I used one red bell pepper along with two green; the slight sweetness of the red was complementary to the jambalaya. I recommend using the whole chicken because, along with the sausage, it creates a very good stock in which to cook the rest of the ingredients. It was a very easy recipe to make, and I love how you do not have to be exact with the measurements when cooking dishes like this.

Good stuff.  Use some Tasso Ham and Andouille Sausage instead of the smoked sausage if you can get your hands on it.

Delicious flavor, but I simmered for over an hour and could NOT get the rice cooked thoroughly. I loved it anyway, but next time I'm going to make the rice separately until just cooked, then simmer in the Jambalaya for a while for flavor.

I didn't use a whole chicken, I used two boneless chicken breasts and I added shrimp. And this was spectacular!!! People couldn't stop telling me how great it was. My whole family loved it.

Great Recipe.  Made only a few changes.  Used a pack of boneless, skinless chicken breast rather than the whole chicken.  Used one large onion & one large bell pepper and extra garlic.   Mixture was very thick, so I chose to cook my rice separately in chicken broth and then served the stew over the rice.  Very good!

Really good flavor and consistency.  I made this with three modifications.  I cooked the rice separately in chicken broth, I seasoned with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper along the way (to shredded chicken, to rice and broth, to sauteeing vegetables), and I used whole canned tomatoes and pulled them all out just before adding the tomato paste since my husband doesn't like to eat cooked tomatoes (that he can see!)  I used a "Cajun Andouille" sausage that turned out to be much too hot for me to eat, but my husband and teenage son loved it.  I was quite content eating around the sausage because the dish is really delicious.  I also cooked the mixture about two times longer than the recipe called for, uncovered the whole time, and kept adding chicken broth. Don't forget to pull out the bay leaves before serving.

A very good recipe. The only complaint was that there was too much of a tomato taste so next time I would either leave out the tomato paste or only use a 16oz can of peeled tomatoes.

We always try to goto New Orleans once every year or two.  The food there is awesome.  This Jambalaya was New Orleans quality at home.  If I had ordered it from any Brennens or similar caliber restaurant in New Orleans, I would have been completely satisfied.  I did spice it up a bit more with hot sauces and peppers than the recipe required., but otherwise it was perfect.

This is a wonderful tasting Jambalaya. I was lucky enough to find canned tomatoes in Cajun flavor. I also used canned chicken broth because I didn't have time to leave the stuff overnight and skim the fat. I added 1t thyme and 1/2t black pepper, too. I used Kielbasa, shrimp, crab, and scallops with the chicken. Everyone at my dinner party loved it...a couple ladies took the recipe home, too.Thanks Claire.

This recipe is oh so easy and oh so good! Everyone raves about this dish. I have been making it for over 5 months now. I was very nervous on making it at first. I thought I would mess it up. Impossible! Now, I add crab meat and shrimp with the chicken and sausage and anyother seafood we want. Thanks for the recipe! It is a keeper!!

This recipe is excellent!  I made it for a dinner and my southern friends loved it!  Everyone had seconds!  This dish wasn't spicey enough for me, though, so I added a couple more teaspoons of chili powder and  hot sauce.  Otherwise it was delicious!

I loved the taste of this, but found it was much more time consuming than the recipe indicates.  Plan on spending some extra time in the kitchen!  It's worth the effort.

My husband and father-in-law raved about this recipe!  I did make a couple changes--I used cubed boneless, skinless chicken filets to speed things up and cut the fat.  I also substituted one red bell pepper for color.  I added some Old Bay seasoning for extra flavor, and I added some shrimp.

Great Recipe.  I actually made it over three days.  Boiled the Chicken and Sausage day one.  Made the Jambalaya up to the point of adding the broth and rice on day two (and the longer it simmers, the hotter it gets!).  And then reheated, added the broth and rice the day we were doing to eat it.  Had enough for three more meals!

Next time I may try grilling the chicken and sausage for a little more flavor.

Really good, but needed a little more kick as stated in a previous review.  I also added shrimp which was a hit.  I will certainly make this again.

I made this recipe almost exactly how it was written except I used 2 lbs. of boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken and I also added 1/2 lb. of cooked shrimp. It was good, but in my opinion the tomato taste was a bit overpowering. It had a really sweet taste to it which Im sure is from the tomatoes. Next time I will omit the tomato paste and 1 can of the diced tomatoes and replace it with some of the reserved chicken broth. Very good basic recipe though, and just enough spiciness!

This recipe does taste good, but it doesn't really have the "jambalaya" flavor I was looking for. Instead, it seems to taste more like a cross between chili (chicken version) and spanish rice.

This recipe was super delicious! The only thing I had problems with were some parts of the recipe which weren't noted (don't use the all the liquid from the can of tomatoes, cover the pot after the rice is added to cook, and it definitely took WAY more than 20 minutes to cook the rice). The rice was definitely the most troublesome part,...I think it would have been much better off to make separately and just add it in afterwards to combine. Rice will still get all the flavor. Added more cayanne, pepper, salt and a bit of cumin as well. Overall, excellent starter recipe!

This is one fantastic dish.  I have made it 4 or 5 times, for family, in-laws and friends.  Always gets high praise.  I make sure to make my stock with the whole chicken (skin-on) and at least a pound of hot Italian sausage.  Using this as the broth brings out a rich flavor.  The heat is good, and always available for increase or decrease depending on taste.  Definitely make rice separately.  Everyone has different opinion on amount of rice needed.  Let them add their own.

This is a very good and easy to make. Instead of boiling a whole chicken, we bought chicken breasts and cubed them. We then sauteed the chicken and sausage along with the peppers, onions, and garlic. We used low sodium/low fat chicken broth as well, and we could not tell that we used low sodium chicken broth. I would suggest making more rice with this though, probably doubling it because it makes a lot of jamalaya. We are looking forward to making this recipe again!

I used 2 lbs chicken (thighs were on sale so I used them instead of a whole chicken), 1 lb andoiulle (cajun)sausage, and 3/4 lb shrimp. I took everyone's advice and omitted one green pepper. It was absolutely perfect, will add to the regular rotation!

I have made this for a Super Bowl party and a Camping trip. It travels well. I used 2 split boneless breasts and 4 thighs instead of a whole chicken. I also use Turkey Kielbasa. Great feedback from all who have tried it.

Great recipe!!  Want to shorten your time?  Use shrimp instead of chicken.  Just add it during the last 5 minutes or it gets rubbery (I use two bags of the frozen 32-37 count pre-peeled shrimp).  I also add some chopped jalapenos.  Oh and don't ever use minute rice with this recipe to cut down on time...it comes out to thin.

This was good. To make it better, take other's advice and add shrimp. What's more, the spice needs a drastic increase. I added two habenero peppers, and for this volume, I wish I added 3! At least double the recommended cayanne pepper. For added taste, sautee the vegies with about 8oz of chopped bacon. Also, in my opinion, you can not take the advice of those who said to skip the boiling of the chicken because that is the only way to really shred the chicken as is so necessary for this recipie. If you're going to do it, take the time and do it right, and you will not be sorry!

My family loved this recipe.  I made it with a can of Rotel and another can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  I left out the tomato paste all together -- my husband doesn't like a big tomato taste.  It turned out great!  We will be making this again.

This was very good, even my husband said it was good!!! He really doesn't like jambalay and he thought this was great!! I made a mistake and cooked the chicken and sausage in the crockpot and the sausage was too greasy, no taste, so I removed the sausage and added a fresh batch it was perfect! Thanx!!!

This is very good if you increase the spice. I added a finely diced jalapeno and twice as much chili powder and cayenne. I also used both Texas Pete and Frank's.

Really good recipe,I made double the serving because I had a big group of people over. I added a bit of peanut butter when sauteing the onions and green pepper. It added a depth of flavor. i only added a tiny bit about 3/4 a teaspoon. I didnt have cayenne pepper, I bought a seasoning called Mexican chili powder that has, chili powder , cumin and garlic perfect for this jambalaya.

Was pretty good for first time making Jambalaya. I would suggest cooking rice separately and then adding. Took a while for rice to get tender in mixture. I would add more spice because it was not very spicy by recipe. I will fine tune it and add Shrimp next time.

Great recipe! I had to add more seasoning though: cumin, adobo and Sazon. It still was missing something, didn't realize what it was til I started reading the reviews. Please add Creole seasoning to this recipe or you will not get that Cajun flavor. Otherwise great recipe..

Was a little bland for my taste - and I added a lot more spice... Also needs more rice to be like the jambalaya I have had before... I agree with others that adding shrimp is needed, too.

Love this recipe!  I usually cook it in a slow cooker.  If I am running short on prep time I just put the whole chicken in then lift it out, after cooking, in one piece  (depending on how much it falls apart)  & return the meat to the pot.   I often  add a little smoked paprika or may substitute some black garlic for part of the fresh.  I have also added chunks of squash, zucchini, or okra when my CSA has given me more than I can otherwise use.  They soak up the flavor & don't change the taste of the final product.

This recipe was awesome.  I followed it pretty much to the letter.  I used 2 green peppers because they were huge.  This wasn't extremely spicy.  Next time, I will probably increase the hot sauce and/or cayenne pepper slightly.  It was interesting regarding the heat/spiciness of this recipe.  The heat was an kind of an afterthought, or kind of in the background.  But as a matter of personal taste, I prefer it a little more spicy.  It did seem to take a little longer for the prep time for me than the recipe indicated.  But that was probably due to my not being so great at chopping and dicing.  Great recipe.  The jambalaya I cooked was very tasty.

Not spicy at all - it was so not spicy that I gave it to my 15 month old daughter. I've never been to New Orleans; my only comparisons are the Zatarans box mix and a Cajun restaurantPhiladelphia. After having both of those, I knew what to expect.  I did cook the rice seperately;  the chicken I cooked a couple days before. Also neither my husband nor myself like sausage so I omitted that and we didn't add shrimp. I would like to tryit once more and give it another chance.

This is a great recipe!  I frequent New Orleans and this has the same texture and look as the jambalaya down there.  Great thing is that you can make it as spicy as you like, I omitted the hot sauce and cayenne b/c of my kids and it was not spicy at all.  I used rotisserie chicken instead of boiling one, and used canned chicken broth for the juice.  Otherwise, didn't change a thing about this recipe and it turned out great.  About the rice: I simmered on LOW for one hour COVERED and the rice came out great, fully cooked and tender. Stir frequently to ensure no sticking.

Nice recipe!  Only a few recommendations.  I used a rotisserie chicken to save time and add flavor, which turned out well.  I also added 1/2 lb of frozen already cooked shrimp.  If you wish to spend a little more I would recommend fresh shrimp as mine got a little tough once it was time to reheat it for leftovers.

This was awesome! I've never made jambalaya before so was a little nervous, but it came out wonderful. My husband loved it and even went back for seconds (he never eats seconds). The next day he ate the leftovers for lunch (didn't even save me any, lol). This is a new favorite... can't wait to make it for company!!!

As my husband said upon tasting it, "This rocks!".  Pretty simple yet deliciously flavorful.  I used a can of tomato puree versus paste since I don't like the heaviness of paste.  I also added oregano (1 tsp.), parsley (1.5 tsp) and thyme (1/2 tsp.) to give the tomato taste more depth.

All I had to compare this to was a dish of jambalaya I had at a restaurant. This recipe definitely met if not exceeded my expectations. I did as most people seemed to be doing and used boneless chicken breasts. I also substituted crushed chiles for the cayenne, hot Italian sausage for the smoked and jasmine rice for teh white rice. Awesome recipe!

Awesome recipe.  I doubled it, added shrimp, used andouille sausage, and added a lot more cayenne, red hot, and chili because I like it very hot, and I used a little less of the broth because I like it thick.  I might not boil the sausage first next time, to keep more of the flavor in the meat, and not in the broth, because I tossed some of it anyway, but it was very good as is.

Fantastic and very easy!  My friends ask me to bring it to parties, tailgates, camping, etc.  Like others, I did make some minor modifications, following their lead.  To save time, I bought a rotisserie chicken from the store, used andouille sausage and added a 1 lb of chopped cooked shrimp.  Also, I used only 1 pepper and doubled the chicken broth.  Definitely worth it!

I make this often but I make it in half the time by using a rotisserie chicken, chicken broth and cooked rice.  Not only does it take the cooking time down but it also makes certain that all the rice grains are fully cooked.  The problem with using uncooked rice is that some of the grains of rice were raw when done.   OH and you need to add salt and pepper to taste.

Everyone in my household really liked this. This was my first experience cooking cajun type food, although I'd seen Justin Wilson and Emeril do it at least a hundred times... My husband and son want me to add shrimp too the next time I make this. I cooked 4 chicken breasts with the andouille sausage slices in 2 cans of chicken broth. I did not have plain white rice, so I used Jasmine rice, this dish was very forgiving and it worked out great. This is better than my mom's jambalaya. Thanks for a great recipe. Now onward to gumbo?

this recipe is pure genius. i scaled it down to two (it still made enough for 3), replaced half the green peppers with purple peppers, and doubled the cayenne pepper to make it spicier. i also cooked the rice separately so it wouldnt turn mushy. it tasted amazing, i will definitely make this again!!!!

Wow this was good.  I made modifications; I used 6 italian sausage links and 2 cups of rice, with 2 cups of chicken broth.  It was wonderfully thick and spicy.  This recipe was also very easy to make and so simple.

I made this for my daughter's french class for Mardi Gras a couple of wks ago. It was a big hit with her class! I used chicken thighs, 8 of them ,49 cents a lb. that wk so it was very inexpensive to make. I didn't use as many green peppers because they are expensive right now and I used 1/2 the amt of bay leaves. The spices were right on target, not too spicy for the school kids and I served the rice on the side! The rest of the ingredients stayed the same.

I thought this recipe was outstanding.  My boyfriend was wow'ed by it.  I used two large chicken breasts, cubed, and simmered them in a small amount of chicken broth.  I baked the sausage in the oven for about 20 mins and added both to the spicy vegetables.  I cooked the rice (I used long grain brown rice) separately in chicken broth and used about a tablespoon of each of the spicy ingredients in addition to 1 tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning.  Excellent.

My husband LOVED this.  He ate three bowls tonight alone!  I couldn't make it to the store so I made some substitutions and did without some items.  I only used one large onion and no bell peppers or tomato paste.  I had packs of chicken breast strips (already cooked) from the pack (sometimes used on salads) that I used instead of cooking a whole chicken.  I also used smoked turkey sausage since we don't eat pork.  I boiled the chicken and turkey and also added a little shrimp for 15-20 minutes.  Everything else I did the same except at the end I added a little chicken broth to get the texture I wanted.  The amount of seasoning listed in the recipe are perfect if you like just a little spice, but not too much that you have to constantly drink to relieve the spice.  I used minute rice on the side as directed on the box and used two cups instead of one. Thanks!

This recipe was really good, I had to add more tomatoes to cut some of the spice ( I added xtra seasoning) but it turned out great. I will not be adding the rice but will make it on the side next time, it soaked up too much of that wonderful juice.

I tried this recipe last night and it turned out really good.  Boiling the whole chicken, shredding it, and using the broth adds so much to the recipe.  For other recipes, I would only use chicken breast, and it is not as flavorful.  The only thing that I didn't like was that the rice got to mushy.  Next time, I will make the rice separately (as someone else suggested) and poor the sauce over it.  Also, I added jumbo, uncooked shrimp to mine in the last step.  It isn't jambalaya without shrimp.

Awesome!  Since I'm lazy, I used a 16 oz can of chicken from Costco and a can of chicken broth in lieu of step 1.  From there it was easy and tasted incredible.  My wife loved it as well.

this was pretty good -- i added some additional seafood items (clams, mussels, shrimp) which added a nice flavor to it. i did have a louisiana native tell me it was pretty darn close to authentic, although he couldn't quite figure out what it was that was lacking. but for all intents and purposes, a great recipe, highly recommeded.

I had never made jambalaya before, but decided to try it for my daughter's birthday party, which fell on Superbowl Sunday.  We had 35 guests at the party, and they all raved about it!  It did take a while to cut the vegetables, because I doubled the recipe (to 16), but it was otherwise very simple.  I used cooked Cajun sausage from Sam's club and put it in when I simmered it.  I made it the day before and then the morning of the party, I added the rice.  It was a little too spicy for the kids, but some of the adults wanted it hotter!  I definitely recommend this and it would be a great dish for Mardi Gras.  Kudos to Claire's aunt!

This is a great recipe. I made it over the christmas holiday for 20/25 people and everyone raved about it! Thanks for putting this recipe out there. I've made it 3 times now and it's been great every time (I added crab, shrimp, and scallops because I love seafood).

Claire, thank you so much for such a great recipie!! This is by far the best jambalaya I have ever tasted!  Reserving the broth to use throughout the recipie really makes it.  I also chilled the meat overnight to skim the fat...it worked like a charm! Thanks again for making me look like a great cook!

My boyfriend at four helpings (one sitting) and then declared, "You couldn't get a better bowl from a street vendor in New Orleans."  I used cajun sausage (like a bratwust type) freshly made at my grocery store, cooked it in about an inch of water over the stove and sliced it up instead of smoked sausage.  I also added shrimp during the last 20 min.  IT WAS AWESOME!!!

This was a great recipe! I did the chicken the night before and the entire recipe took only 30 minutes to complete. I used pre-cooked sausage,  which was done with the vegies. I added liquid as needed instead of adding to much at first and waiting for it to simmer down. Thank you for sharing it with us. MartaP

This is my go to for jambalaya awesome flavor.  Everything is smoked on a Traeger even the shrimp and then finished on the stove. This was the most I did at 1 time for 20 people. 
I did add 4 lbs. of shrimp With Slap Ya Momma seasoning on it which the recipe don’t have in.

I’ve been looking at this recipe for awhile and decided to try it for dinner this evening.  I BBQ’d two large chicken thighs, seasoning them with garlic powder and Creole seasoning.  Added them to the pan along with sliced andouille chicken sausage.  The other tweak I did was used canned chipotle chili peppers (2 peppers diced) instead of the chili powder.  This gave the recipe a nice smokey heat.  I let it simmer on low for about 25 minutes.  Love the recipe!

I've lived in Louisiana for years and have lots of Cajun relatives, so I've tasted a lot of jambalaya.  This recipe was really good.  My only complaint was that I didn't taste any of the cayenne at all, so it was rather bland.  When I made it the second time, I tripled the cayenne it called for and tripled the hot sauce, which made it marginally acceptable.  Next time I'll sub the diced tomatoes for Ro-tel.  That should do it.

This Jambalaya came out fantastically. I used 3 boneless thighs and 2 breasts and chicken sausage which was perfect and only took about 20 minutes to prepare. Great Tip to keep as much of the broth as possible. I also decided to add an extra Kick by cooking 4oz of prosciutto cubes in the pot before adding the vegetables. I basically made the rest of the recipe as suggested except I didn't have Worcestershire sauce which didn't hurt the overall flavor (not sure if I tasted any Bay leave flavor but I had some and tossed them in). I made this in a 5 Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven which had just enough room to make the whole batch but If I had a larger Dutch oven I would have added more broth. the rice took more like 30-35 minutes to finish cooking but the end result impressed everybody that ate it. This was my first time making Jambalaya and won't be my last. I'll try making it with some seafood next time and maybe splitting 1/2 the amount of ingredients because I ended up with more food then My roommates and I could eat in a week Haha. So good!

Incredible!  This is a fabulous recipe.  I don't have the time to cook the chicken and sausage so I use the pre-roasted non MSG chicken from the deli and the Hillshire Farms precooked spicy hot smoked sausage.  For the reserved stock I use Pacific low sodium chicken broth and beef both.  Those cajun complicated recipes with specialized spices and ingredients have nothing on this recipe.  Love love love it.  Don't forget to throw peeled and deveined non-cooked shrimp in 5-10 minutes before serving.  If you use precooked shrimp just give it enough time to warmup but not too long or they will be tough.  Watch your sodium by using low sodium stock, broth, and tomatoes.  Good sides are corn on the cob and corn bread.

I can't say I've had "real" jambalaya (I've had a few in my day, but none that were like this), but this was phenomenal. I did forget to add the hot sauce, but that was easily remedied. Hubby and I gobbled this whole thing up in 2 meals.

Made a few tweaks because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand and added others to suit my taste. I added 2 cans of corn (didn't have peppers tho even if I did I'd have still added the corn cause I've always ate it in restos like that) garlic powder, celery salt and creole seasoning. Also didn't have chilli powder so I used cumin. Came out great and very spicy, the way I like it!

Excellent recipe! We like it spicy so I made just a few changes: used brown rice & subbed 1 can diced tomatoes w/jalapenos for the regular. Also added 1/4 tsp of ground chipotle pepper and Sriracha instead of the hot sauce. Yummy!

I made this for the very first time ever for Mardi Gras. We had a themed gathering with the family and everyone enjoyed this dish. I tossed in some shrimp too! I've had homemade jambalaya before and this recipe tops it times 10! The spice/hot level was favourable among my guests as well. They enjoyed the heat intensity... it wasnt too mild nor too hot for them which helps make this perfect for multiple guests!

I recently used this recipe for my first time making jambalaya...and now it will be the only one i use! Everyone I was cooking for absolutely loved it. I did add about 1/2 lb of uncooked shrimp right at the end but otherwise I stuck to the recipe and it was great!

I cooked this for my twin daughters' 20th birthday dinner.  I had never before made jambalaya from a recipe, just from a box.  But this was so easy and tasted great.  Their friends all loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was good, but there were some things I would have liked to change. First off, I only used 1 can of tomatos plus the tomato paste and it was STILL way to tomatoey. The rice took much longer than 20 minutes to cook as well just as a heads up. Overall, it was still good. I added some okra and it was delicious

Fabulous!  This was my first time making jambalaya that didn't involve a Zatarain's box :).  Like some other reviewers, I used chicken breasts.  I added seasonings to the chicken broth, as well.  I used Trader Joe's andouille chicken sausage, and browned it in the pot along with the green peppers.  I omitted the onion and used onion powder instead.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  This is delicious, and I will definitely be making it again!

Great, tasty recipe.  Reminds me of my time in Louisiana many tears ago.  Now I need some crawfish, redfish or catfish to go with it.  Next time I will add shrimp to the recipe.

First attempt at Jambalaya and it turned out great.  Served it on New Years day and everyone loved.
I saved a lot of time by purchasing a deli-made rotisserie chicken and canned chicken broth.
I agree with other reviews, this definitely needed more rice.  Next time I will probably use 3 to 4 cups of rice.
Also, this is a great leftover.

I made this recipe for my family which is a very picky eaters and they loved it, my daugther which loves hot food said it was at the right temp but I did do some changes to the recipe due to I can not eat bell peppers so I use new mexico peppers/green chilles which provided the heat to the dish. This is the closes we have come to eating bayou food in along time due too we are currently living in West Africa where you just can't run out the the store and buy the necessary ingredients need for this recipe or any other recipes. I will make this again.

Maybe I screwed this recipe up, but I didn't like it much at all. There wasn't very much rice, so it was basically a bunch of onions, peppers, and meat with a little bit of rice in between. Also, the recipe wasn't very specific about how much rice to use, and it didn't say whether or not to drain the tomatoes, so my jamalaya was very soupy. It also took longer to cook than it said it would. The flavor was great, however; the spices made it taste good.

I love good Cajun food.  With this recipe and the help of a dear friend I took som Jambalaya to a party.  All I took home was an empy pot!!
I oftem times will spice up a recipe cuz I like A LOT of flavor.  But this one does a pretty good job on its own.

We tried this last night and were VERY disappointed.  I froze the leftovers (makes a large batch) and don't know if we'll even eat it.  Maybe I did something wrong, but followed the recipe pretty much to the letter.  We didn't find much flavor and the only flavors we tasted were the sausage & shrimp.  I'm still looking for a good jambalya -- this isn't it.

This is absolutely the best!!!! I have made several times & the recipe is always requested by everyone.I do not use a whole chicken, I use a combo of boneless/skinless breast & thighs & use chicken base for the broth. I do add shrimp & use "bahama mama" sausage, I have also substituted barley for the rice. YUM-YUM!!!!!!!!!

This was very good, I used a rotisserie chicken from the store since I just bought it, this saved a lot of time.For broth I used swanson  natural goodness chicken broth. I also added a little diced ham and used lite smoked sausage. The lite sausage did not seem to affect the taste at all. Since all the meat was already cooked I just skipped the first part of the recipe and went straight to cooking the onions and green peppers. I didn't make it too spicy and my son liked it a lot. I will make this again.

Amazingly good.  We didn't use chicken, but did use chicken stock at the liquid, and put about a pound of shrimp in at the end.  We also added shiracha sauce.  We loved it.

I broke my vegetarian diet to try shrimp jambalaya.  I picked this recipe due to its reviews and added 3/4 pound of pre-cooked shrimp in lieu of the chicken and sausage (I also cut the recipe in half).  It was good, but not fantastic.  I have never had jambalaya before and I expected something a lot thicker and spicier.  Then again, perhaps the meats in the original recipe would have yielded more thickness and flavor.  Next time I make it, I think I'll use more pre-cooked shrimp, torn up into small pieces to absorb the flavor, as well as adding more spice!

Very good recipe but I had to enter a significant amount of extra liquid to cook the rice.  I probably needed to turn the heat lower so be sure to watch the dish as it simmers.  Also, I left out the chicken and sasage and substituted shrimp, which I threw into the simmering mix approximately 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe is great!! I did make a few changes, but very minor ones, I only used one onion, I cooked my rice separately, used chicken broth instead of the water and spiced it up with Zatarains cajun seasoning after adding the meat.  My husband LOVES it and him being from the north east and never have had Jambalaya, I was happy to hear him ask for it again and again.

My husband enjoyed this, but it looks like I'm the minority on this one since I thought it was on the bland side. You'll definitely need to adjust the spices and add some salt and pepper. Thyme and hot (spicy) smoked sausage links would probably be a nice addition as well. I would also suggest not boiling the sausage but adding it to the pot later to retain more of it's flavor since you end up not using all of the broth.

Very nice jambalaya.  It was my first ever attempt and it turned out quite nice.  I might add a bit more rice/broth next time - very intense with lots of meat and green peppers.

I changed a few things, I used cut up chicken breasts, polska Kielbasa and I 1 red pepper instead of 3 green peppers.  It turned out really good.  It had a spice to it , but it was just enough.  I do not like spicy food, but I enjoyed this very much.  I also made it "low carb" by leaving out the rice.

Apparently, this is great! I don't eat meat, but I made this for my boyfriend who is a big Creole-food lover. I whipped this up in an easy amount of time, with extra sausage (because chicken in Alaska can be expensive!) and a few dashes of Cajun seasoning. I made it really thick, and he loved it! A lot easier to make than I thought. It smelled delicious. :)

The shredded chicken in the mix was quite yummy!  I wouldn't add as much bell pepper the next time around.  The Jambalaya is good, but I feel like it's missing something...or maybe I just need to use better quality spices.

Great recipe that tolerates forgetting things on a store run or the inability to get certain items (like tomato paste) due to moving out of country. Very easy to spice up or spice down depending on your tastes. All around winner.

Between my boyfriend and I we have lived in Louisiana for 12 years in the heart of Acadiana (Cajun Country).  This was NOT jambalaya.  It was a very good dish and I will make it again, but I was disappointed by the misleading name.  I followed some of the suggestions and cooked the rice separately in the broth from the chicken and sausage.  I also added a fresh jalapeno.  Thanks for the recipe, but still looking for a true Cajun jambalaya.

Excellent!! My boyfriend was raving after just one bite! We will be making this again and again. The chopping of veggies is the only part of this that is a little tedious, otherwise simple to make. I omitted the chicken and used canned chicken stock instead of the homemade broth, but otherwise followed to the letter. Perfect amount of kick in my opinion, but easily adjusted up or down as desired. Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

This is a family favorite, everybody loves this! I have on occasion substituted the whole chicken with chicken breast to save time. And I always use Kielbasa sausages and add bacon to the recipe to give it that little *extra* It turns out fantastic!

taste is very good, don't overcook the rice, and my family prefers kielbasa, they seem to like the texture. I had added chicken, chorizo, and linguica, next time I'll just use chicken and kielbasa.

Tasted great and my guests loved it as well.  Next time I would cook the rice in the broth seperatly and then add it to the rest later because I could not get mine to cook!!  I had to continuously add more broth.

I don't have much experience with Jambalaya, and with 2 small kids I didn't put as much spice in it.  It turned out pretty good!  It sure did make a lot, though (I had 4 large chicken quarters...a LOT of meat)!  My husband will have leftovers for lunch for quite a while, but he LOVES jambalaya, so he'll be happy!

This recipe is GREAT!! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! My boyfriend encouraged me to make my own jambalaya since we always get the box kind.. and I will never go back to the box! I used chicken breast pieces and hot Italian sausage to make the broth... my sister and brother-in-law loved it and they don't even eat spicy food!

This was very good but it wasn't hot enough with the measurements she suggested.  It did have a very nice flavor.  I used just about everything she did I just subsituted polish sausage with Hot Iltalian (that's all I had) and because I am not a big green pepper fan I only used 2 not 3.

This recipe was great!  I substituted chicken broth for the water and used spicy Italian sausage to give it even more of a kick.  I did find that the recipe called for a bit too much green bell pepper, so I just used 1 large one.  An instant family favorite!  Thank you!!

Wonderful and super easy! I used turkey sausage and it was just as good as the regular kind.  Healthy Choice brand is good as well. I accidentally added the tomatoes with the onions, garlic, and bell peppers - worked out fine though!  3/4 Tbl. chili powder and just a pinch of cayenne pepper were plenty spicy for my taste.  I added 2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the final mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious!  I served this with corn muffins at a superbowl party.  It was a huge hit - no leftovers!  I substituted kielbasa for the sausage and it came out terrific.  Not too spicy.  Definitely will do again!

I don't eat meat, so boiling a chicken and sausage was pretty gross for me.  However, overall, this was pretty easy to put together and smelled good cooking.  My husband raved about this as did our Superbowl party guests.  Will make this again for a casual party.

This jambalaya was pretty easy and quick to make.  However it had too much meat in it and too meaty a flavor.  I wont make it again.  The spices were good though.

My Louisiana-born daughter-in-law gave it rave reviews. I think it's the chicken-sausage broth that helped make it so tasty. I'll be fixing this version often in the future.

This is the best jambalaya I have ever had.  I used chicken breasts instead of bone in chicken.  I only boiled for about 20-25 min. at the beginning.  Very yummy!  thanks Claire

I liked the fact that the main ingredients most people already have on hand, and that it's not too spicy.
