This is pretty much exactly how I make ceviche, except I add fresh minced garlic and I eat it with homemade tortilla chips instead of saltines.

I usually marinate the raw shrimp in lime juice for about 30 minutes, add the remaining ingredients, and then let it sit another 30 minutes or so. I don't understand the reviews saying the shrimp never gets "cooked"-- maybe you need to add little more fresh lime juice? I think I use about 3/4 cup for only 1 lb of shrimp.

This is great with a little tweaking.  Instead of the ketchup use coctail sauce. Add three times as much hot sauce,worshtishire, salt and pepper to your liking.  To cut down on time add lime juice to already cooked shrimp each chopped in half.  The lime juice is great for taste but I agree it didnt cook the raw shrimp well. Just use cooked shrimp.  I double the cilantro as well for added flavor and please don't eat these with saltines!!!!  Buy a big bag of lime flavored tortilla chips and serve in chilled martini glasses with chips stuck in the ceviche.  Classic and tastey.

This recipe is very good.  BUT the shrimp to not cook in the lime juice in the amount of time specified in the recipe.  The lime juice will cook the shrimp but you need to leave them in your fridge overnight.  The recipe turns out great but don't get caught with uncooked seafood!

This is AWESOME!  I doubled the batch for a family party and it was gone before I turned around.  I let the shrimp cook in the lime overnight, added the other ingredients in the morning and served it in the afternoon.  I served it with hotsauce on the side for anyone that wanted to spice it up and scoop-type tortilla chips.  Definitely one of my favorites from this website and very pretty to serve.

My husband said this was the BEST ceviche he's ever eaten.  The only thing I did different was add about 4 tablespoons of chopped jalapeno since we prefer food extra spicy.

I made this recipe to go along with my favorite Spanish Alborino for a recent wine tasting party. I halved the recipe and followed the ingredients exactly and it was plenty for a group of 8 people as one of many tapas. The only thing I did differently was throw the shrimp in a pot of boiling water for seconds and then into an ice bath before drying them off and mixing with the lime juice. I am always wary of seafood I get from the supermarket so I wanted to cook them a little bit first before serving them to other people.  The flavors in this recipe are great. I had the opportunity to attend a lunch and learn with the chef Rick Baylis and this Ceviche is just as good as the Ceviche he served as a first course. Thank you for such an easy and delicious recipe.

Superb. I used half lemon juice, half lime and quartered jumbo tiger shrimp. I let it sit for 15+ mins while cutting up the vegetables. I added 2 chopped jalapenos and cocktail sauce the the ketchup blend and served it with small quesadillas instead of crackers to make a meal of it. The picky husband now says he won't eat shrimp salad from the restaurant again, as this one surpassed it. Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was very good. I added 2 cloves minced garlic with the tomatoes, onion and cilantro. I also marinated the shrimp mixture overnight and drained off the excess liquid before step 2. Next time I will add a second avocado. Thanks for sharing

I made this with mostly small cocktail shrimp, with four big guys on top. I also used my own hot sauce ('Bob's Habanero Hot Sauce - Liquid Fire' from this site). I served it in a martini glass, on a bed of Romaine leaves - looked pretty fancy! The combined flavors were  definitely very good, but I thought it needed something more to truly give it the 'wow!' factor... maybe a little tequila? Anyway, this was great fun to make, and it certainly impressed Husband. Thanks!

The taste of this is 5 star, but I am only giving it 3 becuase something is off in the recipe...it says that your shrimp should "cook" in 5 minutes.  Mine took pretty much ALL day.  Luckily I started this recipe first thing in the morning.  As long as you do that you should be OK!  Oh, and instead of mixing the avocado in, I served the ceviche in avocado halves.  YUM!

This is the BEST ceviche we've had-Hand's Down! I used fresh lime & lemon juice. Got the shrimp from Costco. We served on tostada shells with a layer of mayonaise. We will be making this again and again.

Delicious! I refrigerated the shrimp in lime juice overnight, then added the other ingredients in the afternoon.  I skipped the ketchup and didn't miss it. Served on tostadas on top of a layer of mashed avocado to hold everything together. Fantastic summer meal!! :)

We love this recipe! Usually when I prepare it I like to add chopped cucumber to it.The cucumber gives it an even more refreshing flavor.

A friend from South America taught me this recipe years ago but I hadn't been able to find it again till now. He said the shrimp had to soak in the lime, tomato and onion for at least 24 hours to turn out properly - then you add the rest of the ingredients. Can't wait to try this again now that I know the ingredients again!

Makes a very good light supper.  Slightly less than half recipe is enough for two.  For tostada shells, brush 6-in corn tortillas on both sides with peanut oil & bake at 400 F for 5 min on each side.

Made this for a party.  Turned out great!!  I didn't actually 'cook' the shrimp in the lime juice.  Just let it soak for a bit.  I had pre-cooked frozen shrimp already available.  This recipe makes TONS.  I had lotsa leftovers, but they last a few days.  Very tasty!!

This recipe is SO delicious! I had ceviche for the first time recently in Mexico and this tasted just like it! I was skeptical about cooking the shrimp in lime juice, and I was right... in over an hour it didn't cook through so I just simmered it in the lime juice for a few minutes.  I used the recommended amount of tomatoes, but not all the onion and a little more cilantro than it called for.  I did use ketchup, but think I'll try cocktail sauce next time to see.  This is a great recipe to play around with and add any extras you want.  I think I'll add cucumber, sea scallops/imitation crab meet next time as suggested by others.  This is a great summer light meal and a great party food!

Delicious! A few changes I made: 1. I used 1/2lb fresh (uncooked) medium shrimp and 1/2lb fresh (uncooked) flounder (chopped up into small bites). 2. I used cocktail sauce instead of ketchup. 3. I left the fish/shrimp in the lime juice for 20 minutes before adding the tomatoes, cilantro, etc. Once I added the tomato mixture, I let it set for another 40 minutes. I had no problems with undercooked meat. The results were fantastic. I will absolutely make this again.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe.  I make it for Christmas every year.  A few suggestions:  To save a lot of time, buy fresh frozen shrimp that have been shelled and deveined.  Also, the smaller you chop the shrimp, the faster it will "cook".

This was a big hit with everyone at our bbq! I used precooked shrimp b/c I'm pregnant and didn't want to risk it and served it with corn tostadas. I'm originally from Mexico and that's how we eat ceviche. We use saltines on shrimp cocktail though, so I'm sure it would be a great combination, too.

I cut the recipe in half and there was plenty of salsa! I used cooked shrimp and cubed up the avocados and put them in (I liked the pop of color they added).   *** Do NOT eat with saltines, it's not as good. They'd be much better with fresh Mexican tortilla chips. Otherwise, everything else was the same. Enjoy!

**BE SURE to chop the shrimp.  That is why it is not getting "cooked"!!**  Great!!  Made it as is with the addition of grated carrots and chopped cucumbers.  Was the perfect ending to a warm day!  Look forward to eating more of this as summer really hits us in South America.

We loved this recipe. The only thing we changed was we used already cooked shrimp because it was all we had on hand. It was still delicious. Next time we will use the fresh raw shrimp.

This ceviche was so EASY, and tasted GREAT!  I didn't have any Worchestershire sauce, so I left that and the ketchup out; we didn't miss it at all.  I also added ~ 1/2 tsp fresh minced garlic.  Next time I'll throw in one or two minced serranos instead of using the hot pepper sauce.  GREAT recipe (even though I changed it somewhat) -- thanks!

This was awesome!  I used cooked shrimp because it's what I had on hand; I just let it soak about 30 minutes;  The changes I made were to add a small can of Snap E-Tom (12 oz) instead of ketchup and instead of tomatoes I used a can of Rotel and for crunch I added some cucumber but I bet celery would also be good; I used about 1T Sriracha sauce.  Along with avacado and cilantro this was GREAT!..   :)

Delicious! Added 1/2 a red onion instead of a whole white & that was plenty. I used precooked shrimp, otherwise prepared the recipe as written. Served with baked tortilla pieces instead of saltines. This one is a keeper, a good bit of summertime in mid-winter.   This did make way more than 4 servings. We served it as an appetizer and 12 people went through about 2/3 of it. Looking forward to having the leftovers later!

I've been looking for different recipes to use the avocados that are ripening on my tree faster than I can eat them.  This was a hit with my husband and me!  I followed the recipe exactly (until the end, when I added a little extra avocado, which I enjoyed mixed into the ceviche). This was my first time using lime juice to "cook" shrimp. Don't be afraid! Get good shrimp and they take on an amazing citrus flavor and perfect texture. The recipe portions are scaled for using this as a meal, so if you want it as an appetizer, it will serve 8. Great leftover too - be sure to add freshly diced avocado just before serving.

Wonderful!  I agree with other reviews, however, that the shrimp take longer.  Also, FRESH lime juice important for fast "cooking".  We like ours a little hotter too, so we used more hot pepper sauce.  YUM!!!

This is a very good recipe.  I like my ceviche a bit hotter and add a diced jalepeno or serrano pepper. Also white fish will marinate in an hour or less, but shrimp take several hours or overnight to turn opaque in lime juice.  I usually put the shrimp in the lime juice the night before and then add everything else an hour before serving.

This is a pretty good ceviche recipe. We have made ceviche for years as Estillo said its great on a hot summers day. We enjoyed this recpe; but we are going to stick with the small shrip and instead of the katsup and worstirsire sauce we like clamato and tortilla chips. Thanks for the recipe it was nice to try it a different way.

My husband loves shrimp and enjoyed Ceviche when he was in South America.  However, he wasn't overly fond of this, thought it was lacking something, and he will eat anything!  Since I don't like shrimp much myself I can't really judge.  Won't make this again as it sat in my refrigerator and was a waste of shrimpl

This is the first 5 starI have ever given.  This recipe is amazingly good!  I did cook the shrimp (steamed) about half way  but the rest was done as per the recipe.  So light, so full of flavor, so fresh, I will save this, print it, share it and enjoy it many more times.  Thank you Estillo.

This is pretty close to being very good.  However, it turns out way too citrusy and acidic.  Something needs to be done to balance out the acid taste.

Made this with pre-cooked shrimp (cheating, I know) and it was a big hit, very light and fresh.  Makes a great appetizer or even a main dish salad.

I made this today and was so skeptical about the lime juice cooking the shrimp after reading some of the reviews but I still followed the recipe to the "T" just to see and those of you who said it didn't work had to have done something wrong or missed a step because this dish came out perfect! I left the shrimp marinate in the lime for 10 mins as the recipe says 5 mins or until cooked THEN add cilantro, tomato & onion mix (I added garlic.(because I couldn't see it not being in there) I also used hot cocktail sauce instead of ketchup & added horseradish sauce and it was delicious! Very light & very summery!

I have tried several other ceviche recipes but never one that called for ketchup and worcestershire before. It intimidated me at first but I am very glad I tried this. This is now my favorite. I had to use lemon since I was out of limes but other than that I followed the recipe. The time stated to marinate the shrimp both before and after adding the onion, tomato, and cilantro is more than sufficient for cooking the shrimp perfectly. I think that maybe others who feel that the shrimp was not cooked were expecting it to turn bright pink like it would if you cooked it with heat. It will not. Marinating it longer will just give you rubbery overcooked shrinp. Once it is opaque and pink around the edges it is cooked.

I bought uncooked shrimp and prepared according to directions- big mistake!  It was uncooked in the center.  Had to enjoy the next day.  Sad anniversary dinner.  Luckily we were having steak too!  Anyway, definitely used pre-cooked cocktail shrimp or plan in advance.

I used this recipe over the weekend to make ceviche for the first time but there's no going wrong on this!  It was perfect!  I had some time, so I did let the shrimp sit in both lemon & lime juices for about 4 hours.  I also cut the recipe in half & it was plenty to serve 4 peeps.  Based on other recs, I skipped the ketchup & used a couple tablespoons of cocktail sauce.  I certainly did not measure out the cilantro or onion. I just did what felt right.  All in all, a super delicious recipe! Thank you for posting!

The taste on this ceviche is awesome.  It is time consuming to make.  I cut medium shimp in thirds and it took about an hour for the lime juice to cook the shrimp.  I made it a few hours before my guests arrived so it was really cold.  I also added cucumbers for some added crunch.  I served it with pita chips and my guests loved it.

Excellent appetizer. We serve with "scoops" tortilla chips which makes it easier to eat. Also have made the mistake of not chopping the shrimp up enough and it hasn't "cooked" well. 'we let ours marinate in the lime juice overnight.

This is AWESOME! I just had ceviche for the first time at a restaurant last night because I had always been to scared to try it and I fell in love so I was determined to make it at home tonight. This recipe was better than the restaurant! I left out the ketchup and the crackers, but that's all I changed. I used some tomatoes from my garden and some Romas from the store. I will most definitely be making this again, and probably for guests! It's sure to wow people and can be made ahead of time. LOVE THIS - a new summer staple a long as their are tomatoes in the garden.

I read all the reviews and Still decoded to try this exactly as written.... First the shrimp were still totally raw after 20 minutes in the lime juice ( even though I chopped them pretty small). So I decided at that point to just add the tomatoes onion etc and let bit all marinade an hour... After one hour the shrimp were still completely raw! Still grayish blue color and not opaque at all.  I kept an eye on it for another hour before we just ordered pizza and decided to try for lunch the next day. Well in the morning the shrimp were opaque finally, whew. And the end result was absolutely delicious! We even had some the next night and it was still great. Served on tostadas with lots of avocado. For sure if I make this again will marinade the shrimp overnight. I don't understand why it didn't work for me as written.

Great ceviche recipe! It tastes very much like I remember eating it in Mexico. I goofed and used parsley I had on hand from another recipe instead of cilantro. Luckily, I could still add cilantro after my error, because the cilantro is like the tie that binds this recipe together. I think this tasted better after it sat in the fridge overnight. At first I thought it seemed a bit too sweet.

This recipe feeds far more than 4 people if used as one of a few side dishes.  We used cocktail sauce instead of ketchup and a lot more of it.  In the interest of saving time, I used cooked cocktail shrimp but this method really didn't infuse as much flavor into the shrimp as the "cooking" in lime juice.  Definitely get more avacado and cocktail sauce to serve on the side.  I prefer tortilla chips on the side over saltines.

This was delicious! I only needed enough for two people so I changed the recipe a bit. I used about 1/4 amount of shrimp with 1/2 amount of veggies. I doubled the sauces though. The great thing about this recipe is that you can alter it depending on how you like it; there's no right or wrong. I used frozen precooked shrimp so I didn't have to wait for the lime juice to cook the shrimp.

This is one of my husband's favorites!!  I have made almost the same recipe for years.  Only items I add differently is cilantro and a little Clamato so that it is juicy.  When I make a big batch for a party I add cucumber to make it go further and it tastes great.

This ceviche was okay. I added 1 seedless cucumber diced, and omitted the avocado and hot sauce, just because i didn't have any avocado on hand and my husband doesn't like hot sauce.  Next time I will only use Lemons instead of limes, i though the lime was way to bitter.

Good - but, like the others, you need to 'cook' this overnight.  I tried for 6 hours, and then had to resort to nuking in the microwave.  I also added cucumbers to it.  Guests loved it.

Excellent!  I made this the night before to take to a lunch get-together at the park with my mom friends.  I think the extra marinating time in the fridge did a lot for the flavor and pretty much stamped out any fear of "under-cooked" shrimp.  I served it by spreading homemade guacamole on tostadas, then spooning ceviche over the top.  It got rave reviews and there wasn't a speck left!  This is also quite healthy and low cal!  Can't beat THAT with a stick!!...  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

good recipe, but 1 hour in lime juice will not do it.  Try blanching the shrimp for 10 seconds only in boiling water, thendrop in ice bath to cool...drain and then add to lime juice.

This is a great ceviche recipe!  I used cooked shrimp because I was concerned about undercooking, but the shrimp still had lots of flavor.  I served it as an appetizer on a buffet, so I mixed the avocado in so that it wouldn't turn brown.  It does make a huge batch, so I only mixed the avocado into half initially.  I will definitely make this again!

This is the first time I've tried making ceviche at home and it came out really delicious. Like some other people, I added some chopped jalapeno to give it a little kick, and I served it on tostada shells instead of with crackers. I was surprised I liked the sauce so much - I was very skeptical about the ketchup. My boyfriend loved it too. I will definitely be making this again!

Very good ceviche. I forgot to chop up my shrimp so it took overnight before it was cooked. My husband loved it, but he suggested using cocktail sauce next time. i will make this again and again. Also, as a extra, I put some in a cup and added clamato juice with tobasco. YUMMY!!!!

I made this yesterday for a party we attended.  Everybody that tried it loved it.  I was able to get very fresh shrimp so I "cooked" it in the lime juice for a little over 10 minutes before adding the tomatoes, onion & cilantro.  Nobody believed me when I said the shrimp wasn't boiled.  I think I should have added some fresh jalapinos to the mix as suggested, but it was excellent as is.

I like to prepare things in advance so when guests come I can just serve. This dish is great for that. I did cook the shrimp in boiling water for a min. till it turned pink and curled and then quickly added it to cold water to stop the cooking. Day 1 I cleaned the shrimp, and added the lime juice, tomatoes, onion, and cilantro. I think 1/2 or 3/4 of the onion is good, the whole onion is a little too much.  refrigerate overnight.
Day 2 I added the worcestershire sauce, ketchup, hot sauce, & S/P. Back in fridge.
Day 3 just cut up avocado and added it to mix poured shrimp in festive glasses and added a lime wedge what a hit! Delicious!

I made this on New Year's Eve for my husband's family, and they LOVED it! I did a few things differently. I dumped the shrimp in boiling water for a few seconds, and then let it sit in the fresh lime juice overnight. I also added 2 jalapenos (finely diced) and 1 cucumber, chopped. I served this with tostada shells and chopped avocado on the side. This was a hit, and is well over 4 servings! I'm sure I'll be making this very often!

This was delicious, thank you.  It was 10x better the next day too!!  I highly recommend making a full day in advance, all the flavors really come together.  I didn't make any changes nor do I agree with "rating" a recipe that has had dozens and dozens of changes made :)

Made for dinner club and thought I had way too much but everyone loved it!  Used 3 limes but still didn't have enough juice so added lemon and lime concentrate.  Used 2 avocados and could even use 3 next time as I mixed it in and served it out of a bowl. Was absolutely delicious.

I made this for my boyfriend tonight and he loved it. He ate it on a tostada shell with mayonnaise. He had four of them! I made it exactly as the recipe stated without any changes.

This is a crowd pleaser! I've made this several times and it's so tasty with a great kick. I add Tapatio to spice it and use precooked large shrimp because it's easier. Everyone seems to rave about this recipe and I serve it with tortilla chips.

Great recipe! I added Tiger Chile sauce (it's a sweet and spicy mixture) really sent it though the rough. I would let the shrimp sit alteast over night in the lime juice to make sure it "cooks"

Whoa this recipe makes a ton.  If you are serving it as a side dish, you can half the recipe and you will still have plenty left over.  I let the shrimp marinate in the lime juice for 9 hours.  It was a little chewy, so next time I will let it sit for about 4-5 hours. I'd also like to add some scallops.  This turned out pretty good for my first time making ceviche.

Excellent! Dice shrimp small - it does take a little longer than 5 minutes to marinate, but will continue "cooking" in marinade after all ingredients are mixed in.  Add fresh minced garlic.

This was delicious. I didn't use any avocado because when I cut into them they were icky and it was still great. The sauce is pretty spicy, just the way I like it.

Delicious! One of my new fav healthy go to meals/snacks. Followed the recipe, but added a little chile powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and a dash of sriracha...yes sriracha! Smeared avocado on a tostada and added the ceviche on top. Talk about a perfectly spicy, refreshing, and filling dish!

Thanks for sharing this gem.

The added flavor (ketchup, Worcestershire, hot sauce) really makes this dish spectacular.  I cut my shrimp a little too large and the centers of the large pieces were still raw after 30 minutes so I added the juice of one lemon and that did the trick.

I use this recipe as a jumping off point- I use snapper instead of shrimp and add a cucumber and a red pepper (for crunch) It's a hit!

Like others I cheated and used the already cooked shrimp due to time constraints.  The lime seemed to further cook the shrimp and it was tough in texture.  I am only giving 3 stars because although the recipe is easy enough to follow, it was time consuming and just wan't to my taste.  Visually appealing no doubt.  May try one more time with raw shrimp.

My SIL made this as an appetizer for Xmas.  If you like guacamole, you will LOVE this.  Im not a cold shrimp eating person but the flavors come together so well in this recipe that you cant help hoard the bowl to yourself! I would have never thought to add the sauces to something like this as well.  I have now made this part of my recipes so I can make it for myself.  Well done!

This was really good! I had the same problem as others with the shrimp not cooking fully in an hour, so I took the whole thing and simmered it for about a minute. This fixed the problem. Maybe if you let the shrimp sit overnight like others suggested, the shrimp would cook through. The flavor was nice, though!

Soooo good! I made it as written except I marinaded in the lime juice for a few hours. It cooked just fine (I used raw frozen shrimp that I thawed before adding to the lime). I used more hot sauce per our tastes and just added the avocado into the mix. It's amazing. Served with tortilla chips.

This was a good base but needs modification. I added quite a bit more lime juice and cilantro, as well as garlic salt & lemon pepper, but it was still missing something. Not sure if it makes a difference but I did use half uncooked white shrimp and half precooked lobster tail pieces. Next time I may add some diced jalepeno.  Definitely do not serve with saltine crackers. Pairs best with tostadas (or in a pinch, tortilla chips) guests can pile high. Serve with a slotted spoon or there will be too much liquid. Also serve alongside a bottle of Tapatio so everyone can choose their own level of fire. I'm going to play around with this some more as it has the makings of an amazing ceviche! Thanks for posting!

I forgot the avacado! I used 1/2 lb bay scallop and 1 lb shrimp. I let them marinate overnight only because of convenience.  I also added a minced jalapeno and one clove of grated garlic. The seafood in this recipe cooks very well - just not with heat. If you cook it you aren't making ceviche! Really awesome recipe and I have shared it far and wide already.

This recipe is great!! Everyone raved about how good it tasted...Needless to say I will be keeping this recipe...I gave it 4 stars because I did add a couple of other things..Like I did put in Canola oil..I did boil the shrimp...I was pressed for time and I was not going to try the lime to cook shrimp..I used cocktail sauce instead of ketchup..And salt and pepper...So good!

I gotta try to make this again because it just didn't work.  I'm not sure if the others used bionic shrimp that cooked in a few hours with the lime juice but mine just didn't.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight as others suggested but the shrimp was so rubbery and limey that it was too strong to eat.  My husband had to rinse it in cold water for half an hour to get rid off the strong acid flavor.  But we're not giving up and we're going to make it again by cooking the shrimp first and then let it sit in the lime juice for an hour or so.  Oh, also... don't add the other stuff into the bowl until the shrimp is cooked; otherwise, the flavor is overpowering.

Mine did not "cook" enough in 6 hours, so I simmered the seafood just a couple minutes on the stove, chilled and continued as directed. Fabulous! I used 1 lb each bay scallops and shrimp, and also added 2 diced jalapenos instead of hot sauce.

I wanted to make something light for dinner and found this recipe. This is every bit as good as anything you'll find at a restaurant and then some because it's fresher. As a few others have said, it required sitting in the fridge over night because the shrimp weren't "cooked" in the short amount of time stated in the recipe. I also added a little red onion for flavor, jalapenos for some extra kick and a shot of cocktail sauce. If you're looking for a great change of pace, I'd recommend this and an ice cold michelada, which you can find by Google if you've never had one.

Definitely a hit! The shrimp took longer than 5 min., but it did really work.  The crackers are a must.  Just the right amount of dryness and salt.

Great recipe. Definitely leave it in overnight and stir the shrimp around as the lime juice does not cover it all. I was getting discouraged since some of the shrimp didn't seem to be cooking. Give it enough time to turn pink so that guests aren't scared to eat it.

Cut shrimp into 1/2 inch pieces and marnited in lime juice overnight.  But never could get them to "cook" as described in the recipe.  After marinating for 20 hours they still weren't "cooked".  Maybe it was b/c I used previously frozen, although thawed, shrimp, and I should have used fresh and never frozen shrimp?  Anyway, had to throw the shrimp out so I didn't complete the recipe.

Excellent flavour, but definitely needed a much longer time for the lime juice to work.  Next time would make ahead, hours before or even overnight.

Excellent! ...But other reviews were correct: expect to let it "cook" for more than 5 minutes - I was rushed for time so I first had to briefly sautee the shrimp and then chill. Don't leave out the avocados; they really complement the other flavors. We ate this on plantain chips, store-bought tostadas, and soft tortillas with cold beer and limes and it made a perfect warm weather pinic meal, then heated the leftovers for soup! Awesome dish - thanks!!

Easy and very flavorful ceviche. I rough chopped already cooked shrimp and Persian cucumbers.  I also added mango for an interesting sweet note and Yuzu Hot Sauce for a little more kick and citrus notes.   I would usually use a cocktail sauce for more kick but I made the sauce with ketchup per the recipe and I found I liked the bit of sweetness it added as it married well  with the mango .  It was a big hit at my event.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was the best ceviche I've ever had. I diced everything on the small side, like our local restaurant does, and served it with saltines. By the way, I do wish some of you reviewers would acknowledge that yours is not the only authentic way. So what if you grew up in Mexico and never ate it with saltines? Our local chef grew up in Mexico and ALWAYS had it with saltines. That doesn't make you right or him wrong.  But no matter how you eat it, this recipe is the best!

Do not try eating these if you follow the directions exactly as stated unless you want to end up sick to your stomach. The shrimp will not cook in the lime in 5 minutes. That just does not happen. However, I set them to "cook" in the lime overnight and they were perfect. I'm not a huge fan of saltines, so I used Tostitos instead and it was delicious.

Totally loved this! I chopped the shrimp to about 1/4" chunks and tossed with all the other ingredients in a bowl and covered it like you would pudding with plastic wrap and plopped it in the fridge for the night. I stirred it a couple of times and yes, it took a little while to cook. I had to alter for ingredients I thought I had....so used cocktail sauce for the ketchup and Worcestershire, and finely minced jalapeno for a spice because, sadly, no hot sauce.  I added a bit of chopped English cucumber because I had it. Well  worth the wait! I live in South Texas and I have always had ceviche served with tortilla chips, so that's what I did. I would make this again!!!

So simple! A couple adjustments made-  1)  I chopped up the large shrimp into dime sized pieces before adding it to the ziplock bag of lime juice, which really helped in reducing the amount of shrimp required. 2) I didn’t buy enough Roma tomatoes for both the guacamole and ceviche I was making, but discovered you can substitute a can of diced tomatoes and forego the ketchup just fine! 3) I used buffalo wing sauce for the hot sauce (I forgot to pickup hot sauce at the store) and it worked out great! I made about a gallon for our boat dock Cinco De Mayo potluck and this was a hit! So easy to make the day before and allow the flavors to set in!

Terrible.  DO NOT USE.  You must parboil your shrimp before anything, otherwise you'll be waiting until next year for the lime juice to cook your shrimp and by then they'll re terrible.  Glad I ruined two pounds of good fresh shrimp following this recipe.

This was a hit at work. I used jalapeño ketchup and Tapatio sauce. I added extra jalapeños and cilantro for more crisp flavor.

This is a great go to recipe that my family loves. I did a few things different though. I omitted the ketchup and used cocktail sauce in its place. We used red onion instead of white to give it some color. We also added garlic salt and some lawry's season salt.  We serve it with chips. Its a great recipe!

Super easy and very tasty. Just ensure you dice up the veggies small and chop the shrimp or fish up in small pieces, this will allow it to cook in the lime juice faster. I will be making this again soon.

Holy moly, was this amazing!
I've never made ceviche at home before but had recently tried it at a party and knew it was time for me to try :)
This recipe is wonderful with the perfect blend of ingredients. I followed it almost exactly (except I took one reviewers advice of letting the shrimp marinate/cook in the lime juice for 30 mins before adding the other veggies. I also added some jicama (because I had it on hand) and topped the final product with avocado (because AVOCADO!!) 
I highly recommend this recipe, you won't be sorry!

This is really pretty delicious! I used to make ceviche with just the standard ingredients of pico de gallo and added whatever fish I felt like. I always thought something was missing with that. I never thought to add worschestershire sauce and ketchup but that was definitely what my recipe needed! I also add a few shakes of tapatio:) recently moved down to Florida and now that fresh seafood and fresh produce is readily available and cheap, ceviche has become a staple! Especially with the upcoming warm weather :)

LOVED this recipe! It was a major hit! The only changes I made were: 

1. I "cooked" the shrimp in lime juice overnight
2. I used cocktail sauce instead of  ketchup 
3. I added one canned jalapeno pepper

I divided in half so could have 1/2 original and 1/2 with 1 mango as needed to get used up.  my friends liked better than I did, but in all fairness I didn't add salt or pepper as have to watch salt intake, friends did add and said was much better.

Made ceviche for the first time today using this recipe as a guideline.  I didn't have any cooking of my fresh, raw shrimp issues in the lime/lemon juice (I used half of each).  I did add some minced garlic, 1 diced Serrano chile, diced cucumber & shredded carrot.  Everything looked fine and tasted delicious until I added the Worcestershire sauce.  It turned the juice to a light brownish color that I didn't like.  It didn't look fresh & appetizing any longer. I tasted it before adding and it was fine so next time I will leave it out only because of the color appearance.  I made it a day ahead to insure shrimp was cooked and veggies marinated in the yummy liquid.  Very tasty and will definitely make again.  Oh, I did finely chop avocados (2) and added to ceviche.

i made this just as it was written. it took about 20 minutes for the the shrimp to turn opaque for me, but 20 minutes in the juice out of the fridge plus another hour in was perfect. i also drained most of the lime juice after i took it out of the fridge. it was delicious. this was my wife's first time eating ceviche. she let out an audible moan and exclaimed wow after eating it.

Very delicious!  As mentioned in other reviews, the shrimp did not become opaque in an hour.   I would recommend steaming them for a couple minutes chill then add them to the lime juice.  I instead let them sit in the lime juice for 3 hours and then went on with the instructions.  Love ceviche especially with avocado!

WAY too much for 4 servings. Plus, lime juice did not cook the shrimp. Taste wasn't all that great either.

As always, before trying a recipe - I read reviews first to get suggestions.  I followed recipe as written, but our stores didn't have large shrimp so got the largest we did have.  Cut them into bite-size pieces, put the lime juice on them (about 1 cup juice) and they "cooked" in about 30 minutes.  Added the tomatoes, 1 full white onion, 2 bunches of cilantro (as we love it)!  Then comes the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, salt, pepper, and hot sauce (added much more as we love spicy) !  Added avocado pieces directly to this mixture, stirred and put back in to chill !  So good!  Served as a salad and added crumbled Feta cheese before serving.

I made this very quickly so I didn't do a good job if reading the recipe and chopped my avocado along with everything else...but it tasted great. I too used cooked shrimp bc my kids were eating it. I wanted it as a light dinner and not an appetizer so I put I over lettuce for some and made lettuce wraps for others. Very easy but time consuming to chop everything.

This was a good recipe! I am giving it a 4 because my husband loved it. I felt that something was missing in the taste. After reading some previous reviews I used pre-cooked shrimp instead of raw. Overall it was very good! I served it in a frozen martini glass and it looked amazing!!!

Loved this recipe and so did everyone at my party! This is how I will make Ceviche from now on. I used half shrimp, half imitation crab (both fully cooked) and doubled the cilantro (everyone loves cilantro don't they?) I served it with Tostitos scoops as an appetizer. Thank you!!!
