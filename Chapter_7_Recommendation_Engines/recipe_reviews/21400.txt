Very easy recipe.  I would suggest,for those that are getting a grainy texture, to heat the sugar and flour until the sugar starts to melt a little then add 1/4 of the milk and whisk until smooth.  Follow the recipe as written after that.  Whisking a lot and making sure that your sugar is fresh and not clumpy will make it smooth.

Very good, very easy.  Rich.  Requires a lot of stirring.  I used an extra egg yolk (getting rid of yolks from angel food cake), and it set up nicely.  Will use again.

Fantastic! Easy recipe, not expensive to make, no specialty ingredients or equipment, maybe requires a little patience but it was worth it! This is a new family favorite, a can't-live-without kind of recipe. Who would think it was this simple?  I agree with Amy on technique of blending ingredients well and slowly - never underestimate how much better that can make your recipes. I started by blending the flour and brown sugar together in my sauce pan NOT over heat, blended it very thoroughly and taking care to break apart any clumps. THEN I heated it, while stirring, and added the milk a little bit at a time and stirred constantly while adding the milk until it was well blended and smooth. After it boils, it will look lumpy (don't panic!) just keep stirring.... this is now a family favorite!

This recipe is very creamy and sweet.  I used 1/2 dark br. sugar 1/2 light, it turned out really sweet.  Next time I believe I will cut the sugar down to 3/4 c and still use half and half.  It gives the pudding a much richer butterscotch taste.

Good recipe.  Very easy to make.  I little runny, but that could have been my fault.  Nice smooth flavor.  Next time I might use dark brown sugar, and use a little less, it was a bit sweet for me.  Husband liked it though, and he hates everything.

I liked this--it tastes very much like butterscotch.  I used almost 3/4 cup brownsugar, and it is very sweet, but butterscotch is supposed to be.  This is a somewhat thin pudding and very good as is in dessert cups.  The directions would be better if you mix sugar/flour together first and slowly whisk in half the milk before you turn on the heat.  Then whisk in rest of the milk until it boils.  Add some of the hot pudding to the egg yolks and then stir in.  This will make a very smooth pudding.

eh... When I made it it came out with a cottage cheese consistency because my brown sugar was a brick! It sure did taste like butterscotch though! :)

for taste- amazing! for calories- yikes! But, overall this is a great recipe... took me about 5 minutes, and soo yummy. You should really whisk CONSTANTLY and add the milk very slowly to get a great creamy and smooth texture. This was my first time so I used 3\4 brown sugar and 1\4 white. Not too sweet but still nice and butterscotchy. I also added an extra yolk (using them up), 1/2 the amount of butter and some vanilla. Didn't cut out the flavor at all, really nice!!

This is a nice easy recipe, but not much flavor. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and was great. I also mixed the flour, sugar and milk before I turned on the heat and it came out exactly like pudding is supposed to look and there was never any clumping.

TOO SWEET. also maybe this is my fault (although, I have no idea what I could have done wrong), but the texture is not creamy, it is gritty, from the flour I think.. not making again. Husband said it tasted like pure brown sugar, what a waist of eggs.

East to make, but I would suggest adding 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla, to cut it back a little on the sweetness.

Pretty tasty...reading other reviews, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, whisked in the flour. I whisked the egg yolks into the milk and slowly whisked it into the sugar/flour. Brought it to a boil, whisking constantly, and cooked for about 3 minutes. I found it needed the extra cooking time to get rid of the flour taste. Added only 2 tablespoons butter. It was smooth and creamy...just what I wanted (I ate my serving warm!!)

Best butterscotch pudding.  Very, very sweet.  Tastes just as good warm.  Used 1 percent milk and was still great.

Fast, easy, and very tasty; basically a cream sauce with sugar and eggs. Chefs take note: USE A WHISK! Pudding takes a little time and use med-high heat at first, gradually turning down your heat as your milk rises in temperature. You will have lump-free, thick creamy pudding if you use a whisk and remember to simmer on lowest heat for one-two full minutes when your sauce comes to boil, stirring constantly during this part (you must cook out the flour!). The pudding will thicken even more when it cools. Perfect as written above...

then try this variation...

Instead of whole milk, use 1 C skim with 3/4 C fat-free half-n-half; leave out the eggs, use a 1/4 t vanilla, and add one pat of "light" butter at the end for further creaminess. Granted, it doesn't have the same rich texture, but it tastes like butterscotch with 1/10 the fat content.

I had the same trouble with the graininess.  I thought I spent enough time  with the stirring, I mixed the flour and sugar thoroughly in the warm pan before adding the liquid so there were no lumps. I think the trick was the fact that i allowed a light boil for a couple of minutes and I think it needed a hard boil for a couple of minutes.

Overall, I am trying to ressurrect this outcome to put on top of my bread pudding  (see bread pudding I) because it is not that great by itself.  For all the butter and sugar in it, I would hope it would be just a little bit better.

Yes, I could have done better, but I think the  bang just isn't worth the caloric buck in this case. :(

Tasty desert but doesn't much resemble any butterscotch I've eaten in the past. It's really easy to make and doesn't require uncommon ingredients. Make sure you like the taste of brown sugar as that is what dominates this simple concoction. Overall, I recommend it if you have the munchies but are feeling too lazy to make something proper. C+

This turned out really well, though it was entirely too sweet and I had to add more milk. It didnt really turn out tasting like butterscotch, but it still tasted good. I didnt chill it for three hours, and instead kept it in the fridge for an hour, and it was fine.

This is a nice rich dessert.  Very sweet in a carmel sort of way.  You have to be in the right mood for this.  Also, I was expecting to make a mold like a custard but I see that this is simply a creamy pudding to leave in the dessert dishes it is chilled in.

Tasted fine but I'm not sure I'd call it butterscotch. The taste was vaguely reminiscent of butterscotch but with the full amount of butter was too greasy. Unfortunately the first time I made this I did not read all of the comments and got the dreaded "grainy texture" that so many commenters got. The recipe was much improved after doing what Amy said: 

"heat the sugar and flour until the sugar starts to melt a little then add 1/4 of the milk and whisk until smooth. Follow the recipe as written after that. Whisking a lot and making sure that your sugar is fresh and not clumpy will make it smooth."

If you do that, and cut the butter you'll get a quick workable butterscotch recipe.

The directions don't seem right.  I put my sugar and flour in the pan first over medium heat like it said and the sugar quickly burned before I could get to the milk.  So I tried again with milk first and it was much better.  I also found that no matter how much I wisked the flour would clump.  It tasted nice, but I think I'll keep looking for a go-to pudding recipe.
