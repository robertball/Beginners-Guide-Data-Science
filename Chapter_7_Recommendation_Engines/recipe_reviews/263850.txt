This was a really nice salad! I did pretty much stick to the recipe, with the exception that I only used about half of a small red onion rather than the whole thing, and only 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar instead of 3. We served this with grilled steak and grilled bread, and everyone enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!
