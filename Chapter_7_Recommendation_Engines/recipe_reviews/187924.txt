I'm the first reviewer to make this recipe exactly as written, and it is delicious.  I'm sure the additions noted would also be good, but as-is, this is a hearty, healthy soup.

Very good soup!  I used potatoes, onion, carrots and pepper from our garden. I added a can of diced tomatoes instead of the wine, and threw in some corn for color interest. DH (who loves everything creamy) even thought it was delicious.  And it is very healthy! Can't wait to have it again tomorrow.  Will make again and again!

Delicious! Kosher salt and dried basil to taste, 1 can diced tomatoes, 2 cans broth, and 1 cup water instead of 2. I didn't have a red pepper, but I had to make this, so I used a few dashes of hot sauce and cayenne. This is the only kale soup recipe on this site that I found with wine in it. It makes a big difference. Otherwise, it's much closer to chicken soup. First thing, before sauteeing the onion, I crisped up some canadian bacon to add flavor. For the kale, I used one bunch, chiffonaded/julienned very thin and let the whole pot set overnight. The soup was transformed. I highly recommend it! Thanks for the recipe.

Great Soup! But I'm giving it 4 stars because the recipe timing should be flipped -- the kale needs to cook longer than 20 min and should be put in before the potatoes and beans or they become mushy and overcooked. (I used canned beans.) Just flip the last two instructions and make a great hearty soup. I also added a little parmesan cheese to each bowl before serving and also added beef kelbasa (sp?) when I added the beans and potatoes. Delicious!

I used more carrots and kale than it called for (doubled), as I like a hearty soup and used veggie broth instead of chicken to make it vegetarian.  It was really, really good!  DO NOT SKIMP on the wine - it absolutely makes the flavor of the soup!  Thanks for this tasty recipe - will definitely make it again.

Delicious! Other than doubling the recipe, I omitted the chile pepper (since this is for a 2 yr old too), added a little sausage, and some sea salt, since I used homemade unsalted chicken broth. I reserved half of the garlic and added at the very end, to get the most of its amazing health properties.  I used Pinot Grigio wine (I keep the mini 4-pks around for cooking) and it gives the soup a new dimension. Oh, and I put about 75% of the soup in a blender, and then mixed them together to give this a creamy bean-potato base. Nummy!

I made some changes, mostly because I didn't have everything in the kitchen.  Subbed garbanzo beans for the white beans, which ended up giving some nice texture.  I had parsnips (yum!) instead of carrots, so I added a can of tomatoes for the color.  And because tomatoes make everything tasty.    Subbed a bay leaf because my sage plant died.  :(    Didn't have chicken broth so instead I used water with a couple tablespoons of soy sauce and a dash of Worcestershire.  Kept the wine in and I'm so glad - it added a nice depth and sharpness to the soup.    This cooked up quickly and was a beautiful and delicious soup for a chilly, rainy winter evening.  Nice and forgiving recipe - one to keep and play around with depending on what's in your fridge.

This was great soup...I followed recipe exactly, but added a little more kale than it called for, and also sauteed one link of turkey kielbasa sausage with the onion.  This was the perfect compliment to an already great recipe.

Had guests over tonite and they left with the recipe.  I added crushed red pepper flakes b/c I didn't have the chile and they sd it was just the right amount of spice.  Only had 2 potatoes and doubled the broth amount.

Great recipe!! The flavors were amazing.

The only thing that I will change next time is that I may put the potatos in in the last 20 minutes so that they keep some texture.

I made two changes to this recipe.  One, I added chopped summer sausage during the 'saute onion' stage, and two, I left out the cannelinni beans (the SO doesn't like them).  It came out very, very good, and reheats very well for a tasty and simple lunch!  My favorite potato and kale soup recipe so far!

Good recipe! Thank you. I make a soup similar to this using 1/2 lb. Italian sausage or 1/4 lb. chopped pancetta. I use 4 cups of chicken broth instead of wine since the soup is good without it. A 1/2 cup of chopped celery is a good addition; I do not use the chile pepper. Spinach can be used instead of kale, as noted by another reviewer. If you want a thicker soup, mash a few beans against the side of the pot and stir before serving.

I used spinach because the kale was out at the store.  I also added 1/2 lb sweet Italian chicken sausage.  Turned out good!

Guys, your recipe is EXCELLENT as-is, and was also fantastic in giving me inspiration for a vegetarian version of Portuguese Kale Soup (Caldo Verde) as your recipe already has many elements of that soup.  So, using your recipe, the second time I made a vegetarian version of Portuguese Kale Soup/Caldo Verde, and that was also excellent.  I made this soup as Chris&Kelly prescribe with substituting 4 cups vegetable broth instead of 3 cups chicken broth, and I added a total of 4 cups chopped Kale instead of just 2 cups (please include/don't waste the chopped tender kale stems with leaves!).  And lastly, the key to Caldo Verde is the flavor of Linguica, or Chorizo sausage, so add a package of "Soyrizo" - lightly sauteed in olive oil, with an extra clove of garlic & a little more chopped onion (Melissa's brand is what I have in the Albany NY area ... very good as a vegetarian chorizo/linguica soyment substitute that works well for soups and even chiles. It doesn't have the texture or real linguica or chorizo, but the flavor is very good).  Note that it is a spicy product, so you may want to taste for spices before adding that small red chile pepper that is called for in this recipe.  Either way, go for it as this is a fabulous soup recipe in any season.

I loveee this recipe, since first seeing it i've made it quite a few times for family and in laws. I love it, everyone I make it for oves it! 

My favourite thing about this soup is that it's so easy to swip and swap and substitute ingredients. I just use what ever I have in the fridge.

I change the beans to what ever ones I have in the cupboard at the time I have used borlotti beans, butter beans, chick peas and kidney beans on occasions.

I ALWAYS add a can or two of chopped tomatoes it just really brings out all the flavors and adds a great colour. 

I agree with other people who said to leave the potatoes near to the end, they just go horribly mushy and dissolve otherwise. 

I use chicken stock cubes and dried herbs because I never have any broth or fresh herbs around when I need them

I have also like to give it a little kick by adding either cayenne pepper, tabasco or chilli flakes. 

I haves used courgettes and spinach in replace of kale. I have also made with out the wine on occasion and its just as tasty. 

I will be making this soup for years to come. Thank you for such a great tasting, healthy and flexible recipe. 

....I really want to try making it with some chorizo in next time.

I made this tonight and made some changes. I added one can of chopped tomatoes, half a white onion and one shallot and 1 teaspoon of salt. When I tasted it before adding the tomatoes and salt it was bland for my taste. Also, instead of adding a red chile, I added chile flakes to the soup. It was good and a unique flavor.

This quickly became my favorite soup, and I crave it all the time!  My husband made a few changes though - because we're vegetarian he switched the chicken broth to vegetable broth, and he also adds corn.
Also we couldn't find the right beans so we use navy beans.

Mmmmmm this is the best recipe on this website!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was really good! I made a few small changes though because I thought it was a bit bland as is. I added some chopped chicken breast because I like my soup with more bulk. Next time I will try some sausage like other reviewers did. Sausage would perfectly compliment this soup! I also skipped adding water and instead added more broth and white wine. To kick up the spicing, I threw in a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 2 teaspoons of piri piri spice mix (in this mix is dried Bird's Eye chili, onion, paprika, sea salt, pepper, garlic, and cow's parsley). Wow, it added just the right amount of heat! It wasn't overpowering, but it left a nice warm feeling after every bite. I'll be honest and say that I didn't follow the cooking times as stated. It didn't make sense to me to cook the potatoes until tender and THEN add the other ingredients. I just threw everything in the pot at once and it was all done to perfection in about 40-45 minutes. I will definitely be making this again as everyone in my family really liked it. My oldest daughter (11 years old) devoured a whole bowl in just a few minutes! Thanks for the great recipe Chris & Kelly!

Awesome soup! Opened my email this morning to find this recipe in my mailbox. I had everything on hand except for the kale, ran out for that and the rest is history. I followed the recipe with the addition of a few slices of bacon that I chopped up and browned with the onion in the first step. Even with the use of dried herbs (my herb garden is under several inches of snow!) the flavors are exceptional. My 12 y.o. daughter couldn't get enough of this amazing stuff. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Yum....can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I changed a few things and my pot was practically licked clean by my family and guests.  I cut some bacon into small pieces and cooked it- removed it and then cooked the onion with the olive oil and bacon drippings.  Everything else in the recipe remains unchanged until the end when I added the bacon back in with about 1 1/2 cups of half and half.  DELISH.

Amazing, truly amazing! I added the kale at the same time as the other veggies, since I figured they'd all be cooking for a while, and it turned out great.

Delicious. We are a vegetarian household, so I substituted veg broth for both the chicken broth and the wine. (We don't drink alcohol.) Followed rest of recipe as is, except for using a sprinkle of dried crushed red pepper instead of a fresh chile pepper. And dried herbs for fresh, as fresh was not available. I believe that these minor changes kept the integrity of the recipe. It was SO good. Serve with hot bread for dunking.

I added mushrooms which "beefed" it up a little. (just because I had them in the house) I also used all stock instead of water. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit!

Excellent - easy to make and adapt.  Can use Swiss Chard or Spinach for the Kale.

I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of Kale. I used more chicken broth (homemade) instead of adding water. Used canned diced tomatoes like some other reviewers instead of white wine. Used dried herbs instead of fresh. I didn't double the cannellin beans though and instead put some diced chicken breast.  I added some peppercorns while cooking. I didn't find it spicy enough, so when I ate it I added some hot pepper flakes. Maybe if the initial hot peppers were in from earlier on it would have given some more kick.Pretty good recipe, though I think with Italian saugage or bacon it would have even been a bit better.

This soup is very good and healthy. I grew kale in my garden this year and wanted to use it. My husband and oldest son both ate it which is great since it has nutritious kale in it! The only thing I did differently was use beef stock instead of chicken.

Great stuff. I, too, switched the order of the potatoes and the kale. I used a jalapeno instead of a chili pepper, and it came out great.

I love this soup. I have already made it twice. I smoke some Italian sausage and add that in to the soup. I have done things a little different each time. It is a flexible recipe that you can improvise as you wish. Also one time I used butter beans rather than cannellini beans and it was surprisingly good. I think I usually use 1 cup less water, substituting the other cup for anything else more flavorful than water (ie: chicken broth, wine).

Great soup!  Instructions were perfect, be sure to finely chop the Kale.  I may add some Kielbasa browned with the onion next time.

This soup was yummy!! and very healthy! I followed the recipe exactly excpet I switched the red chile pepper with a fresh jalapeno. I gave it 4 stars because the flavor was bland. When I added salt ot hot sauce it tasted much better. I will definately make it again. Great healthy recipe

I really enjoyed this soup.  So easy and yummy!  I did make a few alterations to suit my taste.  I doubled the garlic (love it!), used all chicken broth (again, my preference), added more kale (to up the nutrition content) and omitted the chile pepper (my 2 y.o. was eating it too so I didn't want the heat).  I also added browned ground turkey for some extra protein.  As for the kale, I did not sautee before adding to the soup (as another reviewer did) but I did add it before the potatoes to give it time to cook down.  I will definitely do that again because the potatoes in this soup can fall apart and the kale takes a while to wilt down.  This soup was absolutely delicious, and is now in my regular rotation.

Very delish!  I had to add chopped cooked chicken breast since my hubby wants meat for dinner.  I did cook the chopped kale in a bit of butter with some minced onions and chew tested to make sure the kale was well cooked. I think you could add or omit ingredients and this soup would still be wonderfull!

Very good soup!  Made this for dinner tonight and both hubby and I loved it.  I added an extra  2 cups of water and added salt.  I didn't use the chili pepper.   I also simmered it longer than stated in the recipe.... We will make this again.

I don't eat kale nearly as often as I should, but that's because until now, I did not know how to cook it! I enjoyed this recipe very much--I was even able to get my carnivore husband to eat some!

I'd made this recipes several times. I think it's wonderfully flavorful & is one of my go to autumn soups. I've always made it vegetarian by substituting veggie broth instead of chicken. Other changes include using dried herbs instead of fresh (and plenty of them!) and red pepper flakes instead of the fresh chile. At this point i don't measure anything and often add more veggies & broth to stretch it further. Last thing i'll mention, as another reviewer has as well: don't skip the white wine! I did once and it just didn't have the same oomph.

This was so good, wish I could give it 10 stars.  I think the white wine is key!  And I subbed collard greens for kale because I couldn't find kale...really, really good!

Very good and healthy soup.  The only things I changed were I added marjoram instead of sage just kind of last minute decision, I used 2 leeks instead of an onion and I didn't have a chili pepper (I guess I could have added chili powder but I didn't think of it).

Soup was good and healthy.  I did use regular chicken broth instead of low sodium -and still had to add a little salt to give it more flavor.  Also, threw some turkey sausage pieces at the end for a little extra protein!

This is one of my favorite soups. Instead of water and wine, I swap it out with organic chicken broth. For a lower carb option, I use cauliflower instead of potatoes. Organic spinach can be swapped out for the kale, too, if you'd prefer. If I have it, I like to add chopped red peppers or mushrooms, too. To make it creamy, just add a 1/4 cup of fat free half-n-half or evaporated milk. I like to garnish this soup just a touch of fresh shredded parmesan cheese.

Delicious!  Great soup with great healthy ingredients.  My husband was a little skeptical and said when eating it he never imagined it would be so tasty! I had to use great northern beans and did add some lean cubed ham for some extra protein.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent! Only minor changes.....I used all broth, six cups and no water and cut the potatoes in quarters and then sliced.  Left out the chile as my family does not like heat.  I added the kale at the same time as the potatoes and cooked 30 - 40 minutes....perfect!  This also might be good with browned keilbasa as well....perhaps next time.  Enjoy!

I made this recipe based on its rating and the rave reviews.  What a waste of ingredients!  This had absolutely no flavour at all!  I made it exactly as written except that after the sauteeing of the onions, garlic and carrots, I put it into the slow cooker for 8 hours.  We are kale fans but did not care for this soup!

Just fininshed making this soup and it came out great! It's rare that I have all the ingredients on hand, so that made it even better! I did add smoked sausage kielbasa to the recipe and probably more kale than the recipe called for. I did think it could have used some salt which I added. Topped my bowl with Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of evoo. This is a keeper.

Delicious, loved it!  I wanted a thicker soup so,  before i added the beans I put 3/4 of the potato and carrot mixure into the blender.     I omitted the chile pepper too.

This is a good hearty soup, and five plus stars for nutritious. A great way to include kale which is one of the healthiest vegetables on the planet. Used 1 lb. of honey gold potatoes. Hard to judge on flavor: four stars shortly after finishing this soup; close to five stars the next day. Given the flavorful array of ingredients, including fresh herbs & wine, this soup was borderline bland tasting but distinctly more flavorful after resting in fridge overnight. Briefly read a few reviews before making this soup, and resisted the temptation to add some spicy sausage as other reviewers did. If we make this again, we will add sausage and/or dried spices to give this a flavor boost unless we plan to serve it at least one day later.

This soup was good.  I didn't find it phenomenal, nor did I find kale to be the star that I expected in this. The kids ate it, but I could tell it wasn't their favorite thing I've ever made, and they're pretty good eaters. I added some chopped cauliflower and ground turkey to bulk this out, and it ended up making a huge pot.  After adding liberal amounts of salt and Mrs. Dash, I still found this lacking in something I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Cheese came to mind, but since I was making this to be healthy, I resisted.  For the same reason I did not add any cream or milk, which also seemed like it might be good.  After dinner, I added some chicken bouillon, which granted, added even more salt, but gave this soup the "umph" it needed.  All in all, a solid soup, but I will probably look elsewhere next time I'm in the mood for soup.  Which I won't be for awhile, because this made enough to feed us for a week!  My only other thing with this soup is that, even with the colorful veggies, it doesn't strike me as a "pretty" soup, not very good potluck fare - which is unfortunate because it really is very healthy.  However, I would pass this up at a buffet table in favor of other dishes.  And I would be missing out on some pretty decent soup,  I can see how a little cream and sausage rather than plain ground turkey would have made this a really great soup.  Hmm... maybe I will have to give it one more go.

My family loved this!  I did double some of the veggies - I used two onions and 2 cans of cannellini beans and 1 cup of diced carrots...it was very yummy!  My five year old and nine year old ate two bowls!

Wonderful Soup-  Have made this for many years and has been a family favorite for our cold New England nights.  I will occasionally throw in left over baked Kielbasa (chopped) or some crumbled browned italian sausage.  Some great rustic bread and you got a great meal to warm you up on those cold winter days.

Excellent! I didn’t have a chili pepper, so added hot sauce and Parmesan to the bowl. Family can spice it up to their liking. Also, didn’t have fresh sage, but added fresh basil instead. This is really a delicious soup.

I've made substitutions in the recipe and those are what "make it" for me! Instead of the fresh herbs, I used 1 tsp. each of the dried rosemary, sage and thyme. If you decide to use the fresh, increase the amounts, "to taste". I also seasoned with salt & pepper which the recipe doesn't call for. Sometimes it's hard to find a small red chili pepper (which is very hot and you should wear gloves when chopping)and so I found a "chili pepper paste in a tube in the cold section where they keep the fresh herbs etc. and I use a tsp. of that. Making it in this way I get rave reviews and everyone wants the recipe! I love this soup! I loved it the first time I made it but I also remember "making it my own" by seasoning it up to my liking. Most recipes are not going to come out "perfect". They are going to have to be adjusted to each ones individual tastes and that means more or less seasonings.

We love this soup! The only changes that I made were adding black beans as I did not have cannellini beans and adding one serano chili minced with the garlic as many husband likes heat.I also added one handful of quinua for protein. Also, my home grown kale only takes 5 minutes to cook. Delicious. Thank you for the delicious dinner!

I absolutely love this soup. I did make a few changes though. For example, I added one can of diced tomatoes. Instead of the chili Pepper, I added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flake and 1 teaspoon of table salt. Finally I heated up a Kielbasa sausage in a flat iron pan for approximately 10 minutes. I then chop the sausage up into small pieces And put it in with the soup and let it all simmer for an additional 25 minutes. In my opinion, in order to get the full flavor of the kale, you have to cook it much longer then what was posted in this recipe. Otherwise this is a wonderful recipe. Thanks for posting.

I always add spicy Italian sausage. I also add the cannellini beans at the beginning because I find the canned beans are not tender enough. We eat this at least once per month.

What a great soup! It's my first time cooking kale so I was a bit timid about the whole exercise. Also, I used dried beans (white northerner - couldn't find dried cannellini at the store). Someone on this site suggested adding one can chopped tomatoes with chilis and I did that too. Didn't have a red chili pepper on hand so used chili powder to taste. Also just a quick squeeze of lemon to bring all of the flavors out. Very good soup - the sort I normally wouldn't try because it looks too healthy (gasp!).

Simply fantastic soup!!!  It is so vibrant and fresh tasting.  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the rosemary, as I can't stand the stuff, and I added salt, as I can my own broth, and it is salt free.  Other than that, I made it as directed, and the whole family really enjoyed it!  I served it with fresh baked bread, and it made for a hearty meal.  I love this for a healthy and comforting alternative to the meaty main dishes my guy usually prefers.  Thanks Chris&Kelly- this is a keeper for sure  :)

This is healthy and the wine & garlic makes it tasty.  Unlike other meat-based soups that tend to coagulate in the fridge after a few days, this soup heated to taste just-made for a week.

Great soup. I definitely needed to add some salt. I have been thinking about how healthy kale is and wondering how I would ever fit it into our diet.  This will be a regular. Who knew I could get my family to eat kale! Thanks for a super healthy recipe!

This recipe yielded a flavorful soup without too much effort. It is an easy mid-week recipe. I omitted the red chile and it was still very tasty. I used red kale and it turned out to be very hearty.

As written, this is very bland.  Believe it or not, it needs salt!  My kids wouldn't eat it, so I should have made it more spicy from the beginning (and I used a Thai chili with the seeds).  If I make it again, I will use more herbs, or maybe use dried herbs, which have more concentrated flavor than fresh.

I did the recipe as described using all fresh herbs, but I added one link of hot turkey sausage and one link of mild turkey sausage while cooking the onions. Also during step where you cook the potatoes I added done sliced mushrooms. When I added the kale, I added about and extra half of cup since it didn't look like enough and added another 1/2 cup of chicken broth to balance it out. This with a baguette is an amazing meal when I'm home with a bad cold.

OMG  ....This is awesome.  I was skepticle because it didn't have the many extra ingridients I always add to my minestrone recipes. I thought  ...."where will the flavor come from????" To my surprise it was totally amazing!  I often hunt for vegan recipes that have protein for my 21 yr old vegan daughter.  this is a keeper.  I did substitute diced tomatoes for the wine and red pepper flakes for the peppers.  there was definetly a kick to the bite.  next time I will add an extra can of beans and one less potato at my daughters request.  I had never used kale before.  I used the whole bunch chopped up the leaves andboy oh boy, it has lots of flavor!

This is an inexpensive but delicious soup.  I sometimes add a little bit of ham, but it is just as good without the ham.  It has made me a fan of kale!

VERY  GOOD AS ARE THE REVIEWS. I HAVE MADE SEVERAL VERISONS OF THIS SOUP/STEW. IT HELPS TO USE FROZEN KALE ET AL GREENS . THE 2&1/2 PACKAGES IN WHOLE SALE CLUBS OR RESTURANT SUPPLY STORES . ALMOST ANY TYPE OF STURDY GREEN WORK. CHICK PEA'S TO OR ANY OTHER TYPE, DRY ARE BEST. BEEF STOCK GOOD . ANY TYPE MEAT CHICKEN , & PASTA ALSO, FOR A CHANGE. I ALWAYS ADD VINGAR TO ALMOST EVERYTHING I MAKE. EVERY THING YOU ADD MAKE'S IT BETTER. LEFT OVERS GREAT. IF YOU CHANGE IT EACH TIME YOU REHEAT IT .   VAN

At a Portuguese Restaurant I had a soup very like this.  It also had chorizo sausage.  I have duplicated it but also used Italian turkey sausage (hot for those who like spicy, or mild sausage for those who do not)

This soup is great: savory, tasty, and warming without being too heavy. My self-proclaimed soup hating boyfriend polished off three bowls and took another for his lunch the next day. Thanks for sharing this great and healthy recipe!

Made this last night. Absolutely delicious. Ended up using 1 cup of Orzo pasta instead of potatoes. Also made this vegetarian friendly, so substituted 2 15.5oz cans of vegetable broth, and 4 cups of water, in place of the chicken broth. 
It's a favorite recipe in the house!

I swapped the cooking times for the potatoes and kale, because kale needs a lot longer than 20 minutes, added celery to the onions and carrots, subbed chickpeas for cannellini because it's what I had on hand, and added smoked sausage to the bowls of my two die-hard carnivores. It was soooo good! This one's a keeper!

This was really good! I doubled the kale and carrots. I like it best with vegetarian broth, that makes it a vegan meal. Definitely cook the kale for awhile  first, then add the potatoes and beans in the last 20 minutes. If you don’t have the fresh herbs or pepper, use dried, it’s still great!

Used veggie broth (instead of chicken), used a can of butter beans AND a can of black beans and a can of petite diced tomatoes.

Very good!  A bit cumbersome to dice up all the veggies, but so worth it!  We grew our own kale and this is the first time I've cooked with it!  This soup is a winner and it's a super food in my book.  I'd like to convert it to  an Instant Pot Recipe.....

first time rating any all recipes recipe.  i have tried many but this is the first one i'm reviewing because neither my husband nor i liked it.  i tried it because the main ingredients (kale, cannellini beans and potatos were all things we both liked).  not sure what turned us off, but i'm glad i only made a half recipe!

With the exception of using leek instead of onion, I made as the recipe as is. I tasted it and it was bland. So I mixed in italian seasoning, tomatoes I had in the freezer, roasted garlic and a parmesan rind. Thank you for the jumping off point to make a nice vegetable soup.

Sauteed keilbasa, onions and carrots.  Then added lacinato kale and garlic  and cooked until kale was wilted and soft.  Added other ingredients plus a can of tomatoes.  Crushed half the beans to thicken the soup.  Didn't have fresh herbs so added a bay leaf, 1/4 tsp. oregano and a dash of ground thyme. 
 Cooked 30 minutes and it was great.  Potatoes tender but not mushy, kale was soft.

I made it exactly as the recipe said but found it not particularly tasty.  I added some Better Than Bouillon Vegetable and it was better.  I had some quinoa cooked and added some of that also.  Then it was a much better soup.  Also a little hot sauce!  I'm sure it's healthy but lacking any depth of flavors as made.

For health reasons I have to avoid meat, alcohol and sodium.  Seems my wife wants me around a few more years.

I used 32 oz of low-sodium vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and wine.  And added 1/2 tsp of powdered turmeric to the list of spices.

I followed the cooking directions and it came out awesome.

Thank you for sharing the recipe.

My family loved it. I will definitely make it again. I made a few substitutions. I used spinach instate of kale,  used only parsley
and dill, no other herbs, green onions, celery and used organic chicken broth which  made all the difference. 
Soup was very flavorful and lite. Perfect summer meal pared with salad.

Loved, loved,  loved this soup. The only change that I made was to add more kale and used 3 cups of stock and one cup of water.  I had it for lunch the next day and it was even better if that's possible!

I left out the sage, cut the potatoes in a small dice as I was in a hurry, and only cooked it about 15 minutes. It was excellent. I  only cooked it about two minutes after adding the kale, as I like it to have some texture. As I didn't have the beans called for, I used garbanzos. Yummy lunch!

I usually make kale soup with half & half, or milk, Wasn't feeling it today found this recipe made it. Yummy it was. I will make again. I did change a few things in making it the 1st time. I added a little more kale by a cup. Also added chicken Italian sausage. Browned it up set aside & didn't add until the last 30 mins of cooking. I would add another can of beans next time. Thought we had thyme didn't, so I added dry Italian seasoning. The red chili I used the dry that you can pick up in jars, seasoning section of stores. That I might leave out or shake a little in next time. I didn't put in a lot, (so I thought) but my husband felt it was too spicy hot for him. Other then hubby saying it was somewhat spicy we both liked it a lot. Also added shredded Italian cheese before we ate it. Yummy.  One other thing next time. I'm going to use homemade chicken broth . Steve makes it from chicken in the crock pot.

Very good!  I made the recipe with a few adjustments. I added a can of chopped, roasted tomatoes and a package of apple/chicken sausage links, chopped and browned before added to the soup.  We had this with a rosemary bread and butter.  Nutritious, yummy and filling. I am looking forward to tasting it tomorrow after the flavors have had more time to meld.

I have made this soup many times, and I usually make it pretty much as written, although it easily lends itself to interpretation! Today I doubled the recipe and added some cooked chicken Italian sausage. We are also using spinach in place of the kale today. It will be very tasty when we reheat the leftovers tomorrow night. This soup it definitely worth the time it takes to chop the veggies and gather and chop the fresh herbs. Don't skimp on the herbs or the wine. They are what sets this recipe apart from other kale-potato soups.

Loved this soup.  Very hearty and healthy.   Didn't have fresh rosemary, so substituted 1/4 tsp dry.  Doubled the kale.  Topped each bowl with a small sprinkling of parmesan cheese.

What's not to love? Even though there is no meat this is a robust and filling meal. The fresh herbs really make this soup. I did add a can of chopped tomatoes, kidney beans and celery just to add to the volume and use them up. I liked those additions but they certainly aren't necessary. This will be a go-to when I'm looking for a healthy meal that will last throughout the week.

I've made this before but I have never rated it. Like the other reviewer's said you can make it your own by adding a few of your favorite things. I started out by sautéing the onions carrots and then the garlic towards the very end. I use at least 4 cups of chicken broth and threw all the other ingredients in and let them marry together in the pot. Yummy! I added a can of diced tomatoes and I more than doubled the kale but it was a mixture of kale spinach and arugula. I used fresh sage and Rosemary but I remembered that I had used I Italian  seasoning before and it really added some good flavor, so I did that again here. I cannot keep enough of this soup around! Even my picky grandkids love it!m

When I taste-tested it, it seemed to lack flavor (as another reviewer stated), so I added a few bay leaves and garlic powder and that did improve it somewhat. I did use my homemade chicken stock, and found the soup also needed more salt. Did skip the red pepper and rosemary. Good soup for a cold day!

Just made this recipe as is, and should have looked at the reviews first.  It is bland as it is, so I am going to look through people's suggestions on how to doctor is up.  Potatoes turned out mushy, and I left the skins on, and now they are like strings in my soup.  Oh well.  It needs salt!  But of course, that would make it less healthy...

Great basic Kale and Bean Soup. We like to add cooked chopped chicken, double the kale, onion and carrots then dice just one potato. As others said, the kale needs longer cooking. I cook the kale first and set it aside to add after the rest of ingredients are cooked. We don't care for the rosemary, sage and thyme so leave it out and use seasoned salt with ground pepper. Don't leave the wine out, it makes the soup extra special.

I would give this recipe 3.5 stars.  I added twice the amount of kale, some pinches of salt to taste and a tablespoon of red wine vinegar.  The recipe was very nice and quite savory.  Went well with a nice multigrain baguette.

I doubled the kale and beans (used a 6 bean mix).  It was alright but I found the broth somewhat bland.  I added a teaspoon of light cream cheese to my bowl and it was delicious.

Stuff is good. You can 'bump' the ingredients a little, more potato, more kale, chard instead of kale, but as long as you stick close to par, this is a hearty, well balanced soup-great for the drizzly overcast days we get for 4-5 months every year!

I left out the white wine and added an extra cup of chicken broth (4 cups total). I also added more kale (3+cups) and a stalk of celery. The herbs smell and taste delicious! I used new potatoes, quartered and I used half a habanero pepper (de-seeded) It adds a nice tingle to my lips! Man is this yummy!

This is a delicious soup.  I make it like ham and bean soup--substituting Great Northern beans and adding  diced ham and ham hocks.  It is a fall and winter favorite for a cold evening, and is great with either some crusty bread or cornbread.  My guests rave about it.

Loved this soup!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious.  Everyon loved it, even the "green" haters.  The Kale was very mild and next time I think I will use 3 cups instead of 2.  I think it would be great with some sauteed ground turkey too.  Love using the fresh herbs, fresh always make for a richer flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!!

So delicious!  I made this recipe almost following the recipe to the letter, making a tiny change or two.  The broth is one of the few that I have made following a recipe and had it come out flavorful and not too salty - the person who wrote it did a fabulous job.  The fresh herbs are so aromatic and tasty, it makes me never want to used dried versions again!  The few changes I did make was to add a little more wine to make it less like a stew, and I undercooked the kale a bit to retain some more nutrients.  At the very end, i added a splash of heavy cream, and voila!  FANTASTIC RECIPE :)

This soup was excellent. Easy to make. I took it to my daughters house and they kept all the leftovers. They had it for lunch the next day. My granddaughter the vegetarian loved it. I'm going to make it again today. I didn't have white wine but red wine worked fine. I didn't have fresh herbs but dried were good and I used a dried red pepper. Thanks for a really good and healthy soup receipe.  5 stars for sure!

Use regular fresh garlic instead of minced.  Added about 1/3 C.  beebe pasta.  Little extra salt needed too. otherwise, very good. Might add some good sliced sausage to make it even heartier.

yummy!!!  i didn't follow the recipe exactly, simply because I didn't have all the ingredients or all the right amounts on hand. nevertheless, this is a great starter recipe with a really yummy flavor.   I used tabasco instead of the chili, and I really like the flavor it added to the soup.  Unlike any other soup I've had. Plus it's super cheap to make!

This was fabulous just as written.  Used crushed red pepper (didn't have a chile pepper) and added smoked sausage (we love meat in soup)!  Hubby is begging for me to make it again!!!

made it yesterday-- very good [ though a little bitter ].  i used vegetable broth in lieu of chick broth, because i am a vegetarian; not sure how to counter the slight bitter taste.

Very yummy and such a savory.   I loved it.  I threw a can of green/yellow mixed beans in it as well.  I sliced the potatoes pretty thin and they cooked really quickly.  It had so many flavors and great taste. I was pleasantly surprised.  Great way to make use of kale, which I love...and great source of protein and fiber.

I made this for dinner tonight. I skipped the wine and added an extra cup of chicken broth. I added italian sausage and red pepper flakes for extra spice. I didn't have potatoes on hand, so I added 1 cup of Quinoa instead which upped the protein in this dish alot. I wasn't crazy about the rosemary "needles" because there seemed like a lot, other than that it was awesome! I served it with a piece of provolone cheese cut up in the bowl - will definately make it again!
