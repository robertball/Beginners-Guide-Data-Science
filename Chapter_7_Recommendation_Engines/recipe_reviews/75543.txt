This was a hit!  I will not purchase canned items, therefore, my family has not had Joe's for YEARS!  Thanks, this was great!  I added a little ketchup and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  It took away the over kill on sweetness....but just sweet enough!

My husband and I both felt that this was not as flavorful as Sloppy Joe's we are accustomed to.  Perhaps using a little less beef or a little more sauce would help to intensify the flavor.  Also, the onion and celery should be sauteed with the ground beef in the grease that accumulates before it is drained off.  The onion and celery do not become tender in 3 minutes of cooking it with the dry beef. Decent flavor, but would be better if flavor was more intense.

I converted this recipe for a crock pot. After I browned the beef, I just added everything (I left out the brown sugar) to the pot and let it go on low. Turned out great.

Modifications: I added some hot sauce and I might have added some jalipeno pepper (if I had any) -- It needs a kick.

I am giving this recipe five stars.  Earlier reviewer didn't find it flavorful enough, but we loved the flavor -- it seemed sufficiently intense for us (we did use the "optional" mustard, which may have made a difference..) Yum! Thanks, NICNEC...

Pretty good - a little sweet for my taste, but easily fixed by omitting the sugar. I added a bit more chili sauce, and added celery salt since I didn't have celery. I also added some green tabasco sauce - yum!

This recipe satisfies a taste for sloppy joes.  I prefer chili to sloppy joes so I added some chili powder and hot sauce to give it some zing.

Taking the other reviewer's comment, I doubled the amount of chili sauce, vinegar, and sugar. Very easy and good. My husband really liked it.

My husband and I love Manwhich, but I thought our favorite sloppy joes would be out of the question for me once I was diagnosed with high blood pressure.  I stumbed upon this recipe, added some sweet red pepper and it tasted great!  My DH said it was better than the original canned version!

VERY tasty and very easy, just how I like it!  The only thing I did differently was I didn't have celery so I used some celery salt.  Turned out great, but I do think I'll try to remember to have celery on hand next time as that could only make these even better, if that's possible.  My first thought was 3 pounds of ground beef would serve way more than 6 people, but after tasting these, I'm pretty sure everybody is going to want 2nds and even 3rds.

I thought this was really good!  I halved the recipe but used more chili sauce than called for because it seemed a little dry without it.  Great easy recipe!

We've made these twice now and they are delicious!  Going into the family recipe file.  The first time I made them, I used regular vinegar and it smelled so much of that, I thought I had ruined them, but they were fantastic!  So now I always use regular vinegar.  We use 2 lbs. of ground round and keep the sauce portions the same.

I thought this was very good. Very easy like it says. I used 2 lbs. ground beef and kept the sauce amount the same. Did use the mustard and a dash or two of Worcester sauce. Next time though I will double the sauce amount, it certainly would not have been enough for 3 lbs. It is a keeper though.

These were ridiculously quick and easy.  I have always been satisfied with manwich, but decided to try whipping up my own sloppy joes.  This recipe appealed as I always have chili sauce sitting around going unused.  Super economical and couldn't be faster, the taste was a little sweeter than I am used to and so I added a couple of ingredients to add a little heat, chili powder and hot sauce.  I liked that there were no peppers, and these hit the spots.

I found this recipe searching for sloppy Joe with chili sauce.  I think it’s key to any proper Joe, but unused in so many Joe recipes. This is easy, as the name implies. Few ingredients too. Sweet is fine and I expect some in my personal Joe preference. Sorry to say, that’s where my kudos end though. First of all, 3 lbs. of ground beef for 6 servings? Wow! I like to eat heartily, but still, I made this recipe with only 1 lb. and got respectable helpings on 6 open face bun halves. (I left out the celery too, had none.)This 1lb. could also translate into, at least, 3 very, very generous closed bun Joes (probably a little too much for children’s portions.) It would also be 6 reasonably portioned closed Joes when served with sides. If you can stand a little more math, this 3lb. recipe should yield at least 9 super-sized to, perhaps, 18 sensibly served sloppy joe sandwiches, on normal sized hamburger buns. Also I used over ½ a bottle of chili sauce for my 1lb.  I used the appropriate scaled amount of vinegar with 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce. What little sauce there was, seemed watery. The chili sauce added flavor and colored the watery sauce, but disappeared into the meat, instead of making a thick, sloppy sauce. It needs tomato sauce or ketchup or something. Note; more, and thicker, sauce would also add further volume to the portions.

Simple & absolutely easy recipe to follow and tastes good! My boyfriend hates celery so I substituted it by using yellow bell pepper and dicing it up to little pieces. 

The other reviewers were right in saying it's too sweet! I cut the sugar by half and it was still too sweet! It may have something to do with different brands of chilli sauce but I suggest a tablespoon (for serving of 6) is enough. Because during taste test while cooking, the sweetness will not come out till e after the flavours mix which can take up to an hour or two after the sauce is cooked. 

Would definitely make this again but I would suggest substituting about 20% of the chilli sauce with ketchup! And the tobasco sauce was a great idea!

Thanks for the recipe still! :)

I omitted the sugar and added tobasco as suggested by other reviewers....it produced very good results. It also tasted better the second day as the leftovers as the flavors had time to meld. I would make this again!

Family loves these sloppy joes!!!  Did not add celery (did not have on hand)and did add the mustard.  One thing, I used 2 lbs ground beef and left sauce amounts as is and it worked out great - this one is a keeper, never buy the can again!!!

These are wonderful and the only thing I would suggest is a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and better seasoning of the beef..salt and pepper etc.

I followed the recipe and these were way to sweet for sloppy joes. I am sure this can be fixed buy ommitting the brown sugar or reducing it. But I will not be trying this one again.

This is a good basic recipe...if you like your sloppy joes more tangy than sweet you won't like these.  My only subsitition was I used ground turkey and 1/4 lb. ground sausage instead of the ground beef.

Just okay.  It needed some kind of a kick.  A little too plain for our taste but not the worst that I have ever had.  Probably would not make again.  Sorry

This was a hit in my house!  My teenage son tends to be picky and even he loves it.  I've made this several times and have used the optional mustard, not sure I taste a difference though.  The recipe is super easy which is a hit with me!

Awesome recipe with lots of flavor!  I add some garlic for a little extra zing, and my honey likes a bit of hot sauce too!  This is the only thing my picky 5 year old has ever requested that I make again!

This was delicious! I actually used about half the meat and just made up the difference in extra veggies, and added some Worcestershire sauce to the mix. It tasted fantastic!

This tasted great and was so quick to make!  I didn't have celery (husband doesn't like it anyway) so I put some celery salt on the meat as it cooked, and added celery seed to the mix.

I LOVE the sweetness!  I did add a bit of red pepper flakes to taste.  The sauce I used was garlic chili sauce and it made it so tasty!  I think I did add a bit more than called for (I'd halved the recipe).

I made this the day before while cooking chili on the stove at the same time (love to make two meals at one shot) and since it sat overnight, it tasted even better than when I tested it after cooking!

Thank you for a great alternative!

I followed the recipe as instructed, except I omitted the celery & mustard, doubled the chili sauce, and to bring out the flavor I added a pinch of crushed pepper and TADA!  This really went well with my dinner party and I will definitely make these again - Thanks NICNEC!

This was very good.  I only had 2 1/2  lbs. of gr. beef & I did add a small can of tomato sauce and a generous dash of Paula Deen's House Seasoning. That fixes anything! It was just right.

Didn't add the celery. I don't know why every recipe that I researched calls for celery because I don't recall my mother putting it in her sloppy joes.

Except for a couple of minor differences, this is the same recipe my mom used to make for us back in the '50s, and I really enjoyed it then (and now).  I made two changes: reduced the ground beef to 2 lbs. and used green pepper instead of celery.  Yes, it IS "super easy" and very kid-friendly since it's not at all spicy, but if you like more zip in your Joes you can easily add something to punch it up to your taste.  One note -- 3 lbs. of ground beef yields 6 servings???  I got 8 generous servings using only 2 lbs.

We all loved it so I will make it again. I took advice from other reviewers and didn’t add so much brown sugar, I only added 1tablespoon and that was plenty. Cooked my onion and some garlic with the meat.  Added a dash of worcestershire, celery seedworked fine since I didn’t have celery. I also used enchilada sauce when I couldn’t find any chili sauce in the cupboard. It turned out really yummy. Made the mistake of not draining the fat off my meat. Definitely will next time.  I followed this recipe as a base, I’m a cook not a scientist. I make adjustments....like a cook.

Really excellent recipe! Simple to make, I followed some other commenters and added a Tbl of Worcester and also added the onion and celery before draining the grease to cook them a little easier. If you have yellow mustard around definitely add it because it counteracts the sweetness of the sugar. I used a full Tbl. This came out delicious and my roommate who told me she doesn't even normally like Sloppy Joes even enjoyed it!

Used 2-1/2 lb. of 80/20 hamburger  because it's what I had. Used listed quantities of all other ingredients (including yellow mustard) as listed in recipe except the following: didn't add the celery, did add 1/4 cup finely diced sweet orange pepper, also added one teaspoon each of paprika and chili powder. It was great! I'll make it again exactly the way I did tonight.

All items were pantry items.  The first time I made this there was not enough "sauce".  The next time , because I was cooking for a crowd, I added one more pound of beef (total of 4) and doubled everything else plus 1 tsp. of table salt.

I did not make it as I love Chef John's sloppy Joes. Just  wanted to say that 3 pounds of gr. beef makes a heck of a lot more than 6 servings.  However the recipe sounded pretty good and easy.

Good base recipe. Per other reviewers, I found it lacking in flavor. I added garlic and onion powder (roughly 1/2-1t each), ground mustard (2.5t), beef base (Better than Bouillon low sodium - about 1T). I kept the other ingredients including the sugar as is: those who thought it too sweet, well... sloppy joe sauce IS sweet! I used the Chili sauce recipe from this site (Ellenmel) because I do not like high fructose corn syrup in my food (bottled chili sauce from store).

I subbed Steak-ums for the ground beef and rolled it up in a tortilla with cheese, heated long enough to melt the cheese. Delicious. We call them Sloppy Jose's.

This was very good; much better than the stuff you buy in a can. I did however, only use 2 pounds of ground beef(and that was more than enough for my family of 3) and the 12 oz of chile sauce was still not enough. I would imagine the meat would be very dry if you use 3 lbs and ONLY the 12 oz of chile sauce. Next time I will up the amount to about 16 ounces. This was still delicious and I will definitely put it on the menu again!

We love this recipe in our family! I use about half the sugar, and I usually end up needing a little more sauce since I also add diced bell pepper and shredded carrots. My 2 yr old loves it!

Loved it! The only thing I did was add about a teaspoon of sweet basil by accident but we still loved it!

Used two bottles of sauce. Too dry otherwise. Great flavor. Will make again. Super easy.

As a few others have mentioned, we prefer Sloppy Joes that have a kick to them.  Consequently, this recipe seemed pretty bland to me, and so I added a T. of Chili Pepper, Kosher salt, and about 1/2 c. of spicy barbecue sauce, which brought some life to our taste buds.

We loved it!  I used the "Homade Chili Sauce" brand that I bought from Safeway.  I found another reviewer had mentioned it so I tried it instead of Heinz.  I also used the mustard that's optional - I had Gulden's Spicy Brown mustard  on hand so that went in (I eyeballed it) and I did use some brown sugar but way less than what was called for.  I tasted it beforehand and realized it needed just a hint of sweet and again eyeballed it.  It came out great.  There were only 3 of us eating so I used 2 lbs. of ground beef and about 3/4 of an onion and less than a full cup of celery.  Terrific recipe.  Oh, and since another reviewer had mentioned perhaps sautéing the celery and onion with the beef while it was browning, I tried that.  I seasoned it with salt and garlic powder.  After it was done, I drained it, added a little more salt and then added everything else.

I'll definitely make it again.  I served it with Alexia brand potato/carrot/green bean sauté.  It's frozen and fires up quickly in a pan with a oil-based seasoning pack that comes with it inside.  Super easy kid-friendly meal.

Tried recipe last night. Because my wife and I are both diabetic we used splenda instead of brown sugar and was bread instead of rolls. It was great. Will try it with Agave nectar next time.

YUM. And yes, quick & easy.  I like my joes sloppy, so I halved the meat, celery, and onion, but kept the quantities for the sauce ingredients the same.  I used Heinz chili sauce.

Very Good and easy! Will make this again! Didn't have any celery so made it without and still good. Can't believe someone said it didn't have flavor. Followed as directed and my family loved it.

This makes a huge amount!  I will make it with only 2 pounds of meat next time so there is more sauce - however, it is really good and we will be eating it again!

Pretty darn good. I did use only 2lbs. of meat and then doubled up on the chilli sauce . The onion and celery was a good addition. I saw in other posts where the writer felt the joes were to "dry".....just add more chilli sauce and that will take care of the  problem. Nor Did I think it was too sweet{ maybe because of the extra CS?}.This will be my sloppy joe recipe from here on out.

We LOVe these joes. I no longer buy the seasoning pkt kind & I'm sure to stay stocked up on bottled chili sauce as I have all the other ingredients on hand already. We put shredded cheddar on top of them before topping w/ the bun.

I didn't really like this one.  It was very sweet and I didn't like the celery in it.  I will not make this again.
