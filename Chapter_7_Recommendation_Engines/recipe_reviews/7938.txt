I made this for my husband's Easter potluck.  When he called me in the afternoon he said, and I quote " I went in the lunchroom to get the pan and caught a guy licking it"  Gross, but you get the point!  Apparently, it was a huge hit and not a morsel was left.  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I had to make alterations suggested by a few other members in order to get the recipe to work.  1. I melted the chocolate chips 2. I added approximately 7 minutes to the cooking time as it was undercooked after the suggested time.
Thank you for the great recipe!!

Absolutly wonderful cheesecake.  I made mine in a pie dish and it still comes out fine. I also use an oreo crust (about half a bag of oreos and 3/4 stick of melted butter)- hey.. if your gonna go chocolate... go all the way!  I omit the chocolate chips (to keep the smooth velvety texture) and add 1/4 C expresso to make a "chocolate cappachino" cheesecake.  Personally, I think it tastes better than that choc capp. cheesecake recipe on here and WAY easier!!  I dont use the sour cream topping because the cheesecake has such a beautiful chocolatly color by itself...  Thank you for the recipe!

I misread the recipe and melted the chocolate chips before mixing them into the cheesecake mixture.  It was a good mistake to make.  The cake is rich and creamy and so chocolatey.  I also added a tiny bit of cinnamon and topped it with sliced fresh strawberries.  I used a ready-made chocolate crumb crust.  Yum!

This recipe was perfect for adapting for our family’s dietary needs. I subbed used 1/3 cup + 1 tbl of Stevia and ½ cup + ½ tbl of organic sugar. I replaced one of the packages of cream cheese with Neufchâtel cheese.  Instead of butter, I used Smart Balance Blend. I also used low fat graham crackers. To ensure consistency, I used an extra egg yolk. The sour cream was reduced fat. Like many others in the reviews, I melted the chocolate chips.   This was by far the tastiest cheesecake I’ve made in awhile. It was also the simplest. I was a little worried that it wouldn’t be set in the allotted time, but I was worried for nothing. The second really made helped bring together the flavors in the topping. I’m not big on toping cheesecakes with sour cream, but this worked. I will say that I’d be fine with no topping at all because the cheesecake doesn’t really need it. The crust was just right, the consistency of the cheesecake was perfect and the taste was spot on. There are no leftovers.  If you are hesitating about which recipe to try- go for this one. Its easy and its delicious. What more can you ask for?

I made this cheesecake for a friend's birthday.  It was devoured quickly and the recipe requested by almost everyone.  I would, however, bake the cheesecake a little longer because the center didn't appear to have set all the way.

Ecellent & EASY recipe. I love this cheeesecake recipe.
It was simple & I used the chunck chips and added a few on top prior to the sour cream topping. I was worried it would not set up it seemed not done but to my surprise it was PERFECT. I added cherries on top and it was exquisite and delicious! I give HIGH marks.
Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent!!! My Dad pronounced it "Divine". I'd recommend using the mini chips and make a chocolate wafer crumb crust instead of grahm cracker for the ultimate in chocolate. Will definately be making this again & again!

A true chocolate lover's dessert! I get tired of seeing 'chocolate' recipes that call for almost no cocoa. Took a star off because the sour cream topping didn't work, it was too much vanilla. Next time I'll either leave out the vanilla or not do the topping.

This makes a very rich cheesecake. I halved the sugar and melted the chocolate chips before adding them to the cheesecake batter. The cheesecake was decorated with sliced, fanned strawberries, chocolate chips and confectioner's sugar for my friends' birthdays.

I have never seen my husband go back for seconds of ANY dessert (except cheese) until I made this!  I adjusted the recipe and used Resse's brand peanut butter and chocolate chips and also substituted Splenda for half the sugar.  For simplicity, I used pre-made crusts as well.  Finally I topped it off with melted chocolate over the top to dress it up a little.  I actually had people say it looked like a store-bought cheesecake!

Excellent and easy (for cheesecake) recipe. I do a couple of things different from the recipe: -I use 1/2 cut butter in the crust for a more solid crust -I also cook it an extra five minutes during the first time it cooks.  -I really like the topping, so I add about 2-3 more ounces of sour cream than the recipe calls for and put put in a little more sugar and vanilla (I don't measure this, I just ad a bit more and it comes out fine each time).

I absolutely loved it. I am only a beginner cook and this recipe was incredibly easy and delicious! It was a big hit in my college dorm. The sour cream topping may seem bizarre, but it tasted great. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Very rich and creamy cheesecake. Didn't think I'd like the chocolate chunks in it but the added crunch was pleasent. I used a store bought graham crust to save on time and it worked perfectly

This cheesecake is absolutely wonderful and rich!  I am a huge chocolate lover and this is a great creamy cheesecake.  After the first time I made it I was asked by 5 other people to make it again for various functions!!  Its a huge hit.

This went over well at my house. The only thing I added was a tablespoon of brewed coffee just because of how the coffee and chocolate work together.   Great recipe!!

I made this recipe tonight for the first time and found it very easy to do.  I melted four bakers chocolate squares with a double boiler instead of mixing in chocolate chips as per some previous suggestions and added 10 min to the first cooking time.  All who had it enjoyed it very much. The most notable comment was how smooth the cake is.  I have tried many cheesecakes in the past and this is by FAR the easiest one I've ever done.  I also used a store bought graham cracker pie crust to make it easier yet... and it all fit in perfectly.  This is now my "go to" recipe for something sweet and a little fancy.

Made this for Valentine's Day and it was delicious.  Very rich and creamy.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  It sliced well and was pretty.

Yummy! I substituted the sour cream for non-fat plain yogurt in the topping and it was still good. Used white chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips for the contrast in the cheesecake. Will definitely make again. :)

This cheesecake was very good! Only one thing I might do differently is add fewer or no chocolate chips at all. My family and I thought it had too much chocolate. Otherwise it was very good and i will make it again some time!

I made this cake for a family gathering we were having. Everybody seemed to like it. I thought that it was just too rich. When you say chocolate lover's, you really mean it! I wanted a chocolate cheesecake. This was more like a chocolate pie. There was cream cheese, of course, but it was overpowered by the chocolate. I don't think that I will make this one again. But, if you're truly a chocolate lover, this is your cake.

I dunno...This was good, but not amazing.  I gave it 4 stars as it was impressive to look at, and fairly easy to make.  The presentation wowed my husband and family for our Valentine's dinner.  I guess I had greater expectations for it in the taste, texture department.  Maybe it just wasn't what I expected.  Hubby and kids enjoyed it...I did, too, but felt somehow disappointed.

I'm thrilled to have found this recipe! It was the easiest cheesecake I've ever made, and quite tasty. I skipped the crust, as I always do these days since I'm trying to minimize carbs/sugar (and the cheesecake part is of course the most important part!), and I also used Splenda rather than sugar. The first time I made this, I used the sour cream topping but didn't care for it so much; it tasted fine, but didn't add much for me so I skipped it the second time (so I basically just made the filling) and it was delicious! Word of warning though - I had the brilliant idea of partially melting the chocolate chips and swirling them into the filling the second time (because the first time, I complete melted them and mixed them in very thoroughly), but I didn't stir in the partially melted chocolate very thoroughly because I was trying to swirl it, and I ended up with solidified swirls going through my cake that are super difficult to cut through. A wiser cook than I would have predicted this, I'm sure, but I didn't really think about it. So...next time I'll just throw the chips in unmelted, like you're supposed to anyway! Thanks, JJohn32! Great recipe.

I loved the cheesecake part but I didn't really like the crust. I agree with another reviewer that it is very good with mini chocolate chips.

This was odd.  Did anyone else think the sour cream and sugar mixture was bitter?  The crust was awesome and I will use it again for another cheesecake recipe.  :(

This was only my second cheesecake and it turned out great.  Everyone said it was one of the best graham cracker crusts they've had on a cheesecake.  I will defnitely make it again.

This was delicious.  I really love the sour cream topping.  Three things: I think I will try baking the crust for 10 mins first before adding the batter.  Mini chocolate chips might have been better.  It seemed wee bit too much.  Last, I will probably bake for a few minutes longer next time.  Will definately make again.  Great recipe.

AMAZING! I LOVED this cheesecake as did my entire family! I can't say anything bad about it...except I wish I had more. ;) I did drizzle it with chocolate syrup and I think that took away from the chocolate flavor...it's not overly sweet and the syrup is. ;)

WOW! I went with another viewers mistake and melted the chocolate chips. I also added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to the crust mixture and omitted the sour cream topping. I followed the baking instructions to a tee and it came out perfect. I had to make another the next day b/c my family devoured it and I wanted more than 1 piece!

I made this for a birthday party and I LOVED it!  The semi-sweet chocolate made it a little too rich for me and I prefer VERY rich, dark chocolate.  The second time I made it, I used milk chocolate and it wasn't quite as rich, so it went over better with the rest of the family.

This cake was delicious !!!  I put 1/2 cup of quik instead of Cocoa powder and I cooked the cake 30 minutes instead of 20 minutes. It was worth it to add the topping (sour cream).  Next time I will cut down the sugar from 7/8cup to 1/2 cup, since chocolate chips & quik made this cake very sweet.

I didn't use the chocolate chips or vanilla (was out if both) and the cheesecake was just as divine. Between a brilliant holiday sale at my local grocery store on cream cheese and a beautiful old springform pan I found at a yard sale for $1.50, im ADDICTED to making cheesecake.  Never knew it could be this easy!!!

Very yummy. I used oreo cookies for the crust. And covered with chocolate ganache, using ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate. The sour cream topping sounded weird, but was very good, it went well with the cake. The cheesecake, sour cream topping, and chocolate ganache all went well together, yummy combination, everyone loved my cheesecake.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  I used miniature chips, fearing so much chocolate and it being too rich.  Even with this adjustment, the recipe is a bit much.  If I try it again, I will not add cocoa to the original cheesecake mix and just add chocolate chips.  Also, when you are done beating the cheesecake mixture, it is THICK, very different from regular cheesecake.

This was good but very rich, my husband, and 3 kids (under age 8) could not finish even a small slice.  He brought the leftovers to work and it took a whole day for it to disappear.  It did turn out to appearance as a nice presentation with the white sour cream mixture on top.  Next time I would use 1/2 cup on miniature chips instead.
