We love Kugel at our house, but I'd never before seen a recipe for Sweet Potato Kugel...this was a real treat for us.  It was fun to make and turned out perfectly.  We loved it!  I will definitely make this one again!!!

Entertained 10people at my house and they all loved this chicken. I made the chicken rolls the night before and baked them according to the recipe however I did broil then to get that crispy taste to the bacon. I definitely will make this again.
