I let this marinate over night and did not serve it with the extra marinade.  My husband and I both thought this chicken was delicious, though!  We would definitely make it again for a quick (and healthy) dinner.  I served this with stir fried peppers (red, green and yellow) and onions.

This is my go-to chicken marinade for grilling now.  I use a couple of cloves of fresh garlic instead of the powder and I use rice wine vinegar just becuase I like it more than regular vinegar.  Thanks!

I made this recipe last night.  I followed the recipe exact but cooked it on low for 6 hours in the crockpot.  It was delicious.  I made rice added that to crockpot on high for 1/2 hour.  No leftovers.  Yummy!

Thanks for sharing.

We loved this! Word of advice though, it says marinate for an hour, next time I am going to do it over night. We ended up soaking our chicken in the left over sauce. Very good!

I made this chicken exactly as instructed and it was very bland. I couldn't eat it but my husband, who isn't too picky said it was okay. I will not make this again.

Easy and tasty - but it's definitely a little more subtle.  I used half for a marinade on some chicken and shrimp, which I grilled to put on top of an Asian salad.  I thought the marinade might make a decent salad dressing too, so I used the other half and added a bit of honey and brown sugar to it, with a little extra soy sauce and it was quite yummy.  Will definitely use again.

Quick and easy but boring. For us, it lacked taste. It isn't bad, just boring.

This Recipe was very bland.  I made this to Recipe and was very dissappointed to be honest.

Awesome recipe!!! I followed the recipe to a "T" except I did not use the extra marinade. I made "Simply Asia" noodles and brocoli for a side. The family loved it!

Very bland - I marinated chicken tenderloins for three hours (it recommends one) and basted every two minutes during 12 minutes of broiling.  Absolutely awful. Would not make again.

I actually let one batch of chicken marinate for an hour, grilled it and ate it immediately.  After taking that chicken out of the liquid, I put in four more frozen breasts and let it marinate for about 36 hours.  We did not use the sauce as directed to serve with the meal.  
The first batch was good. I don't know why people are saying it isn't flavorful.  The second batch was phenomenal.  I like that there aren't alot of processed ingredients in this marinade. Simple and tasty!!!!  Even my picky picky 13 yo gobbled it up.  Wonderful quick and healthy meat.  Bye bye chicken rut.
