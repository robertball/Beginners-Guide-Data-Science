This is a lovely chicken dish and cooks quickly and to perfection in the instant pot. Only changes that I made was  I increased and julienned the peppers and carrots (I always prefer extra veggies)
For my personal taste doubled the peanut butter and added a little  Sriracha sauce.

Chicken sweet potato curry with coconut milk was a good recipe to bring  to my table for my husband and father-in law. By cooking the curry under pressure allowed the coconut milk and sweet potato to combine in a thick sweet and creamy sauce.  I am very happy with this unique curry recipe. My in-laws enjoyed it as well

I did not use an instapot or pressure cooker. I used same ingredients and cooked on top of stove and simmered for about an hour. It was wonderful!!!

I love any combination of curry & coconut milk, but what gives a unique kick to this curry chicken  is the peanut butter. The best rice to accompany this dish with is Jasmine rice. Both aroma's (and flavors) combined give that authentic gourmet delight
