This was a special meal growing up.  My mom would usually add chunks of boneless pork ribs stewed up with the chicken until soft. Hmmm....delicious!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Not being a major meat eater I used less chicken; bad move!  I totally should have used the 4lbs - and I should have doubled the amount of chorizo as well.

Chicken was nice and tender.  I expected the plantain to taste sweeter.  It taste like potato.
