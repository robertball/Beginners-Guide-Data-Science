Deeelicious! Sweet potatoes and Splenda make a good pair... hardly a hint of aftertaste.

Was well received by my family; didn't tell them it was made with splenda until after dinner, and they were all quite surprised.  I was told I could make it again, yeh!

This is very good.  It has a sweet, subtle flavor and a very good texture.
