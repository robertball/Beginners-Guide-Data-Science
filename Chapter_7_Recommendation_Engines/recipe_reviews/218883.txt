Great recipe and even for those who don't THINK they fancy pineapple! I didn't do the precise measuring, but just mixed the liquids then added the Ricotta then the cake mix and it came out fabulous. I did add a tsp of vanilla which added a nice little pop of flavor. No need to frost and definitely get the crushed pineapple that's in its own juice not sweetened in any way. Also, use REAL ricotta not low cal or diet. The muffins loose texture if you sub in the fake stuff.

I used a coconut cake mix instead of white cake mix and whole milk ricotta.  I also added 1/2 cup toasted, chopped pecans.  Outrageously good!  This is to correct my previous review.  I didn't realize I had checked 1 star instead of 5.  Duh.

I just made these this afternoon. I made them exactly according to the recipe, using the white cake mix and they are very moist and flavorful. They were easy to make, and absolutely delicious. Having my second one with a fresh cup of coffee right now. Could not wait for the coffee to be made so had to eat one before I had the coffee. Thanks neesienc, this is a definite keeper. Juneann

For me this was just ok. I get where its going, but mine were pretty dry and crumbly after spending 21 min in the oven. I would suggest either not draining the pineapple (as the batter was unusually thick) or reducing the baking time to 15-20 min.

I made these with a coconut cake mix and fresh pineapple (guessed on the amount).  I thought they were delicious, like little Pina Colada cakes.  Yes, cakes, not muffins.  That is why I gave this recipe 4 stars and not 5.  They do not have the consistency of muffins, at all.  I would definitely make them again, however, possibly trying the white cake mix and mixing coconut in the batter.

Little dry for my taste, even after adding some of the pineapple juice to the batter. Nice flavor!

A FANTASTIC way to use leftover ricotta without having to resort to yet ANOTHER Italian dinner.  Great muffin.  Light but lots of taste.

My first batch came out tasty and moist, but they also burned on the bottom.  I decreased the temp. to 350 degrees for 30 min for the second pan.  They are still in the oven so I hope they come out.  I don't usually like using cake mixes, but I have to say they do come in handy when there are leftover ingredients to use up...in my case the pineapple and ricotta cheese.

I used mascarpone instead of ricotta, because that's what I had. Added the pineapple juice as per the reviewers' comments... Turned out fantastic!

I have made these twice already, they are very good. I am going to make these today for breakfast on Christmas morning, they freeze up well so I usually double the batch and freeze half. I haven't tried adding vanilla extract to the recipe but maybe I will today.

These are so tasty! I used a French vanilla cake mix instead of the white mix. I would recommend adding a Brown sugar crumble to dress them up.

My muffins were very moist as I missed that bit about draining the pineapple!  Nevertheless, they turned out well and my kids loved them.  Difficult to categorize - too sweet to be a muffin, too healthy to be a cupcake :-)

Very good!  More like a cupcake than a muffin, but it was still good.  My family loved them.
