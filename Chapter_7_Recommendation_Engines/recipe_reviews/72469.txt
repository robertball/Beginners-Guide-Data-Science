Everyone should know I made this recipe exactly as written. I should have known better when I was making this.  I was worried about the berries not getting thick with nothing on the berries but lemon juice.  And of course they didn't get thick.  They were runny and not very attractive at all.  The topping was odd also, after adding the water of course it made the batter topping smooth and again not very attractive.  All in all, I won't be making this again. Highly dissapointed. What a waste of great wild blue berries.

Excellent! I too made some changes. Each sugar amount was changed to 3/4 cup. Because of less sugar I reduced the amount of salt to 1/4 tsp.Since frozen berries were much more cost effective, I used those & reduced the boiling water to 1/2 cup. Delicious! One thing I will do different next time: I made this early in the day.It comes out with a slightly crisp topping. But when I reheated it for my guests it made the topping more cakelike. Still delicious, no one knew except me. I'd like to try it next time still warm & crunchy. personal preference Topped with vanila bean ice cream it was delish & plenty sweet.Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  This was both delicious and gorgeous!  I used a round corningware dish instead of the suggested pan and the cobbler turned out great!  Cut back on the sugar a little bit, added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the crust but other than that I followed the directions exactly!  For those of you tempted to add more blueberries b/c you think that it doesn't look like there is enough in the pan.......don't add more or you will overflow when baking.  The blueberries plump up huge when they cook in the hot water mixture.  Now, I just need someone else to help me eat it!  :)

This recipe is fantastic.  My wife had some frozen blueberries that she needed to use up so she tried this.  She read the reviews first and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (in both parts) as others had recommended.  That was about two weeks ago.  It was so good that we made it with raspberries when we went to a friends house for dinner last weekend and we made it with some fresh-picked blackberries this morning.  Heated and served with some golden vanilla ice cream makes it just that much tastier.  My wife noticed that it bakes up better with the fresh berries (as recommended).  There was a bit too much juice with the frozen berries (perhaps reducing the water would help). I thought it was great either way.  Definitely a great summer recipe.

This was so simple and a hit for dessert on Easter.  I had some yummy fresh blueberries and it turned out great.  I recommend a cookie sheet under the pan as mine boiled over a bit.

This definitely lives up to its name.  I agree with the other reviews though, you can really cut down on the sugar that is called for.  I use 3/4 cup on each part (1 1/2 total for the whole recipe) and it comes out great.  And that is also using wild Alaska blueberries which are alot more tart that the kind you buy at the store. My mom has made this same recipe using rhubarb for many years.

as suggested by other reviews, i reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup in the batter and 1/2 cup in the cornstarch mixture, and this was a perfect cobbler! i may add a bit more cinnamon next time, but all in all fantastic... the crust was the perfect marriage of pie and cake, and the berries magically made an absolutely fabulous filling, in both flavor and texture. most definitely a keeper!

It's blueberry season and my husband brought home 15 pounds of the suckers!!  I froze most of them but did make this great cobbler.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar to a total of 1 cup.  This cobbler was so good I think my husband is going to go back to the blueberry farm and get a further 5 pounds!!

I took the advice of the other review and did half the sugar and I think you could cut back even more. But it was easy and tasted great so I will try this again. My husband loved it!

I made this today at the hospice where I volunteer. I used 3/4 cup sugar in the batter and 3/4 cup in the dry topping. It was slightly tart and delicious. I like the way the dry topping makes the batter crisp on the top. I will definitely use this recipe again at home.

Really delicious cobbler!  Based on other reviews, I used about 4 cups of blueberries, sprinkled about a tablespoon of cornstarch over the blueberries, and slightly reduced the amount of sugar in both places where it calls for it.  Both the blueberry layer and the topping were delicious, and topped with a little vanilla ice cream it makes a wonderful down home dessert.

Delicious!  I also cut back on the sugar...3/4 c. on the blueberries and maybe a little more on the top.  It was plenty and this is very tasty cobbler.  I didn't have any whole milk so I used evaporated instead and it worked just fine.  I didn't find my batter to be thin as some have said. It was just right for cobbler.  And the blueberry mixture thickened up just right.  This is easy to make and I am with the one who wanted to eat the whole thing by their self!  Perfect with Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

Easy and Quick!! As did the majority of reviewers, I cut way back on sugar and it was perfectly sweetened! The batter was not runny as stated, so I added more liquid to get it to the consistency to spread over the blueberries. More cake like than most cobblers, but we loved it! We reheated it in the oven the next night and it was even better!!!!

This was not to our liking. I didn't realize until final steps that it had so much sugar altogether. Top crust lovely and all, but I don't think I'll use this recipe again. Shame to ruin all the blueberries!

This cobbler smelled great as it baked and looked delicious....but...it is almost ridiculously sweet.   My teenage daughter made it for dinner and after tasting it, I looked at the recipe I saw that it called for more than TWO and a HALF CUPS of sugar for 3 cups of blueberries.  No wonder it was cloyingly sweet.  (And I do have a sweet tooth!)   Sorry to be so negative in a sea of positive reviews but we won't be making this one again.

This recipe is unbelievably simple and fantastic!  I don't normally take untested recipes to gatherings but I needed a dessert the other night and had a couple bags of frozen blueberries so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was gone in less than 5 minutes!  I used a mixture of frozen wild and regular blueberries and I did not have whole milk so I used skim.  It turned out perfect (the boiling water part freaked me out a bit, but like others said, it gives it that perfect crust so don't skip it).  So many people recommend reducing the sugar but I didn't.  Nobody complained that it was too sweet and hey you only live once!  If you are eating right 80%, you can let go 20%!  Thank you so much for this recipe, will definitely be making again!

Delicious and the family loved it. So sorry if you are one of those people who want the recipe followed exactly, bc I try to improve the nutrition of most carb based recipes. My family and I have to eat it after all. I halved the sugar in each step. I used half whole wheat flour and it was still fluffy. I only had an 8x8 pan, so that's what I used. It took the same amount of time that the larger pan would have.

I thought this tasted very good.  I have a sweet tooth & usually don't adjust the recipe to make it "more healthy" but this I did take others' advice & reduced the sugar on top to 1/4 c. mostly b/c I don't like "crunchy" sugar on top.  I also put it in a 9x13 dish & it worked great - no spills.  very yummy!

very yummy! we picked 18lbs of blueberries so I was looking for something to use them in. I found this but didn't have flour so I used 1 1/2 cups bisquick (in place of flour and baking soda) also added more cinnamon and a little vanilla. Everyone loved it. I have now made three times. It's quick and easy

this is now known as "the famous blueberry cobbler" good with blackberries, too. any kind of berry is probably good, though i haven't tried any other.

This receipe is excellent if you reduce the sugar as many of the other reviewers suggested.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup each(we don't like things too sweet).  Since I used berries that I had picked and frozen, I reduced the boiling water to 1/2 cup and increased the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons.  I made 2 pans with this recipe, one for home and one for work, and everyone just loved it!  Thanks for the recipe and the tips for improvement!

My family LOVED this recipe!  I did add a little less sugar than it called for, as well as 4 T. MARGARINE and 3/4 c. SKIM milk but it was excellent.  The boiling water step is unusual but why question what works?

This recipe is way to sweet.  For the topping you can limit the sugar to at least half the required amount.   The husband wasn't impressed but the kids loved it(probably all the sugar).

I used the Servings yield to reduce to 4 servings since I only had about a pint of berries.  I used 4 Ramekins, sprayed with cooking spray.  I placed the berries in the bottom, topped with the batter then placed on a cooking sheet before pouring on the hot water.  Baked aprox 35 mins and they turned out beautiful and the kids licked the ramekins clean!!

This was sooo easy and what a great hit with my family.  The ONLY thing I did different was put my fresh blueberrys in a bowl to stir to evenly coat with the lemon juice!  Thought it was a weird recipe but will be making it on a regular basis.  Thanks soo much for sharing.

The berries were very runny first of all.  But mostly my issue was the amount of sugar. WAY WAY WAY too much sugar, I love sugar, but this actually made me feel sick.

This is great if you follow the directions. I lowered the sugar for the topping. My husband loves this with vanilla ice cream.

Very good taste and texture on the cake part.  I doubled the recipe but reduced the sugar as suggested and next time would reduce it even more to 3/4 cup and 3/4 cup, or less.  Would add some cornstarch to the berries as they were a bit runny.  Added vanilla extract to the dough.  Will make again.

Loved it!! I'm not necessarily a desert person, but oh my, this was wonderful! I used frozen blueberries & reduced the water to 1/2 c (as was suggested), as well as cutting the sugar to 3/4 c each part (as also suggested) and added the cinnamon (as was suggested). Yummy with vanilla bean ice cream!!

WOW!!  I made the recipe as it calls for, except I used frozen blueberries, thus lessening the amount of water to 1/2 a cup.  It was WONDERFUL!!  We topped it with vanilla bean ice cream! :)  I'll definitely be making this again soon, using other berries, too!

Very tasty.  I cut the sugar in half... but will cut it even further next time.  I used wild blueberries too (more tart, less sweet than those bought in the store), and I STILL would cut out more of the sugar.  The other proportions (flour, corn starch, etc) were perfect, the blueberries came out the perfect consistency... not too runny and not too gelatinous.  If using store-bought blueberries (more watery), I'd use a little more corn starch.

D LOVED this!  He just raved.  I'm not crazy about crystallized sugar, and this had a little of that on the top, so I didn't like it quite as much. It was extremely sweet, but I counteracted that by topping with unsweetened whipped cream.  It was very good...I won't use quite as much sugar next time.  My (frozen) berries thickened up nicely.  I used what I thought was an 11x7 pyrex dish, and it was nearly overflowing-just barely contained.  (I was too lazy to go measure it, but I'm pretty sure it's very close to the specified size.)

My family loved this dessert!  I increased the blueberries to two pints (4 cups), in addition to the lemon juice over the blueberries I included the zest of the same lemon.  After reading the comments about it being too sweet, I reduced the sugar.  I used  3/4 cup sugar for the batter that was spooned and spread over the top of the blueberries.  For the topping I used just one cup sugar.  It turned out wonderfully.  Enjoyed so much we are making it again and again already!

Wow!!!  I did half the sugar as well according to other reviews, but by looking at the last review with only one star, they must not know how to cook because this turned out excellent!!!!  This is now a family favorite!

Very good!  I would also cut back on the sugar, made as is and VERY sweet.  I made with small frozen blueberries and the water content was fine, just cooked 25 minutes longer.

I live in Central-Europe, Hungary, where blueberries are not typical therefore I attempted making the cobbler using mostly red currants - and a few black, because I didn't have enough from those... Also, I noticed that I was out of lemons, so I used some orange juice instead, and I love spices, so I sprinkled 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg over the berries before covering them with batter. I used 3/4 cup of sugar both times the recipe called for it as others suggested and the cobbler came out being deliciuosly tart and fruity. For those who have a sweet tooth, some vanilla ice cream made it even more delectable. Oh, and I used flour and ground walnut instead of cornstarch, which I didn't have... Taking everything into account I must say: WOW! This recipe is a definite keeper!! It is healthy and sooo delicious at the same time. Now I want to try this cobbler with all sorts of berries... :)

This was really good and easy.  I followed others' advice and halved the sugar (I also halved the entire recipe). I also used skim milk instead of whole milk. The batter wasn't runny like I expected so I added an extra TBS of butter and a dash more of skim milk. This recipe isn't quite as rich as some others; it has a lighter taste to it.  If you're looking for a super rich and buttery cobbler this one isn't it.  But this one is really good, easy and quick to make, and tastes great with vanilla ice-cream.

I followed the directions as written and thought that I was ruining it when I poured the boiling water over the dish, but was I ever wrong.  It was excellent served warm with ice cream.  My son actually woke me up that night to tell me how much he liked it.  I will definitely make it again.

Perfectly delicious blueberry cobbler!!!!  I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup based on other reviews, so I had to give 4 stars instead of 5.  Luscious with freshly whipped cream!

I've never made cobbler this way before, but it was great!  I reduced the sugar (used 3/4 C for first part, 1 C for 2nd part).  Will definitely use this recipe again!

Yummy! Everyone at our bbq loved it. The only thing I would do next time is cut back on the sugar. I had not heard of this method before and loved the glaze that formed on the cobbler. I will make it again soon since we are having a great  blueberry season.

This is a terrific dish because it is very easy and very delicious!  Pouring the boiling water on top of the batter/dry ingredients made a fabulous sugar-crusted top when the cobbler came out of the oven.  I made this as a second dessert option and it turned out to be the star of the show.  I will definitely use this again.  Thank you.

this is a great cobbler recipe.  not your usual cobbler but the taste can't be beat.  i make it with canned peaches and it turns out great.  it's a great goto recipe for making at the last minute.

this was excellent. my husband mother and I went blueberry picking in June and froze alot of blueberries so I used some of these in this recipe and it's excellent I also made fresh whipped cream as I didn't have any ice cream and we all loved it. My mom said she would cut down on the sugar so she could eat more but I wouldn't change a thing

Way, way too sweet. Took tips from reviews to cut down to 3/4 cup sugar for each part but would actually cut down way more. The blueberries were also really runny. Everything else was fine but I can't eat more than a few bites at a time because of the sugar.

With only half of the sugar topping, this cobbler was still plenty sweet, bubbly and satisfying. The family couldn't eat it fast enough.

Great taste and easy. Took advice on using less sugar, adding an extra cup of berries and sprinkling more cornstarch over berries to thicken a bit more. Thanks for sharing. My family loved it!

Crust was a little hard, but it was pretty tasty.  I have made it twice and the filling is delicious.

This recipe is soooo DELISH!  I like it just the way it is, but like most, my hubby said it was really sweet.  So for his sake I may cut down on sugar next time, but for me, I wouldn't change a thing!

Great idea-but toooo sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't have any suggestions right now except to cut the sugar either out of the 1st topping and the 2nd topping.  Oh and tooooo gushey.  Cut some water, maybe.  
The top crust is awesome.

I just made this and it turned out great! I would have given 5 stars but I did make some changes. The first thing I did was use 5 cups of berries (wild blueberries)! I like lots of fruit. I did decrease the sugar some but still found it quite sweet. I didn't really mind the sweetness so much but I found it overpowered the blueberry taste. Next time I will half the sugar in the milk mixture and see how that goes. Because I didn't read the recipe thoroughly, I ended up mixing all the dry ingredients and then adding the milk. However (before adding milk),after reading some concerns about runny berries, I took a handful of the flour/sugar mixture and sprinkled it over the berries and then just shook the pan gently to get the flour down through the rest of the berries. No runny berries here. I also added extra cinnamon for personal taste. I will be making this again.

My husband and I just ate a piece of this with vanilla ice cream, he LOVED it. I did cut the sugar to 3/4 cup when it called for sugar and I used orange juice instead of lemon juice. I will definently make this again !!

Will definitely be making this again.  I was in a hurry and didn't measure a thing and it still turned out delicious.  I think the only thing I did different, is tossed the blueberries with a little cornstarch after adding the lemon juice.  VERY SIMPLE recipe that tastes great!!

My family loved this recipe. Made a few changes, lessened the sugar by half and used Pinot Grigioe wine for the boiling water.  Gave it a nice tart but sweet presence.  Will make it again.

This is the best cobbler recipe I have ever found.  I chose to make this for a Safari Club International BBQ that my husband and I were attending.  I was a little nervous since I had never made it before, so on the advise of other reviewers, I decreased the amount of sugar to 3/4 of a cup.  I also doubled the recipe and when the timer went off it looked beautiful!  OMG...it was the hit of the party!!!!  I am not kidding when people were saying that they wanted to lick the Pyrex dish clean...lol  This will be my choice for all cobblers from now on.  Blackberries are ripe for picking so this will be my next cobbler.

This is the first recipe I have ever taken the time to review;  I think it should be rated higher! :)  This is the BEST cobbler I've ever had and it's super easy, even for someone learning how to cook like myself.  YUMMY!

Sooo good!  Based on past reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c each, and the sweetness was just right.  I think it would have been too sweet for our taste with the full amount of sugar called for, hence the four stars.  I also reduced the boiling water to 1/2 c since I was using frozen berries.  It still had plenty of juice, but it wasn't overly runny.  I love how the top gets the nice crust, and the dough underneath stays moist.  It's a really delicious recipe.  Thanks!

I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup each, but ended up throwing out about 1/4 cup of the sugar topping mixture.  Next time I'll only use 1/2 cup but keep other topping ingredients the same.
this was my first cobbler recipe and i won't be looking for another.

It turned out really good, but for some reason made my stomach ache. 

I also reduced the sugar to about a half, and it was still a bit on the sweet side.

Way too sweet!! I even cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and 1 cup respectively. Next time i will reduce even further. I used a 9x9 square pan and it took longer to bake. I also used frozen blueberries. I would increase the cornstarch if i use frozen again as it came out a littler runny. Overall, its a good recipe but the sugar issue prevents it from being a true 5 star recipe. I also completely forgot the salt and i dont miss it at all!!

Very good. A little to sweet. I would definitely reduce the sugar. I made a smaller version for two, and I think I used 1/2 the sugar. The next time I would use even less. It's worth trying again.

My first attempt at a cobbler. This was easy & delicious. Definitely a keeper. Per others, I used slightly less sugar, and it was sweet enough.

As recommended, I cut back the sugar, but not as far as some suggested.  I used nearly a cup on both mixtures requiring sugar, which was still a little bit "too much"--but not too much to ruin the recipe.  The cobbler was fantastic--honestly, the best I've ever had.  I highly recommend it.  I see no reason to explore blueberry cobbler recipes when this one is the bomb.  It's looks beautiful and tastes delicious.

Mouth Watering! This was my first cobbler. It was SO easy. I used fresh blueberries and like others, I cut my sugar in half. I took a handful of oats and brown sugar and mixed in a small bowl and put on top for a crunchy toppping.

this is a truly yummy recipe.  i also cut the sugar down, and i used all different kinds of berries.  it goes together quickly and cooks fast, too.  the boiling water step threw me, but i went for it and now it makes sense!

Weird recipe. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup in each part, but it was still way too sweet. I had to bake it 20 mins longer than called for, as it was still gluey after 45 mins. The crust was nice and crunchy, but kind of pale and weird-looking because of the cornstarch/water mix. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the batter and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to the berries, which I think was a good call. I think the recipe could be fixed by taking the cornstarch "topping" mix and cooking it with the lemon juice & berries on the stove first, to make a thickened sauce, and then baking it with the batter on top, using only 1/2 cup of sugar in each part. It might cook faster that way, too.

This was a lovely, simple, delicious recipe that I'll be making again.  It was the perfect ratio of fruit to batter, as long as the fruit is spread out to one layer in the baking dish.  

I don't like to make major changes to a recipe the first time I make it but the reviews to reduce the sugar were so consistent that I reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe; 1/2 cup only in the batter and 3/4 cup in the topping. I wouldn't reduce it below a 1/2 cup in the batter or it would be too thin, but I would reduce the topping further to a 1/2 cup.    

I added a full teaspoon of cinnamon, as a couple of reviews indicated that adding more cinnamon made a very positive difference and I'm glad I did.  I always think cinnamon and blueberries is a strange pairing, but it's also always a nice surprise.  

The last change I made was to add a couple teaspoons of cornstarch to the blueberry-lemon juice mixture, which made sure that it didn't turn out soggy as it had for a few members, and instead it made a lovely thick syrup.  

Because of past cobblers I've made, I sifted the flour and baking powder together.  That helped the texture of the cobbler be "cobblery" but not cakey, lumpy, or heavy.  I also used organic sugar rather than white sugar.  I used lactose-free whole milk + a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  

I think that there was too much baking powder because I could taste it so next time I'll reduce by 1/2 tsp.  Since I sift, b.powder isn't as much as issue.

I made this recipe last night…it was amazing…so so good. it was very easy as well however I wish I would have read the reviews beforehand because I would have added the vanilla extract and added a few less berries…I also cooked it for an hour and ate with vanilla bean ice cream…delicious! Give it a try =-)

I've made this twice and had it for company or taken it for a party.  Both times everyone raved about it. I think it's relatively simple but absolutely delicious, especially served with vanilla ice cream!

This is a good recipe. I believe the instructions are a little misleading on the batter topping that covers the blueberries. Do not over mix these ingredients. Cut chilled butter into sugar (I use two knives).Add flour and baking powder..continuing to cut in. Add milk and stir just to moisten. This makes a thick doughy batter. Continue with final topping. Bakes up just like a cobbler should.  Delicious taste and texture!

I made this summer 2012 and I just now reviewed it!  My dad says this one is a keeper and he's picky about the fruits he will eat.  I love when I make recipes and he says that; you know it's good then.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Not so yummy.  Very watery when the recipe is followed exactly.  Ended up digging the blueberries out to munch on and throwing the rest away.  I will try a different recipe next time.

I listened to other reviewers and cut the sugar, used 3/4C for each part. The recipe says the batter will be thin.... um... not sure what I did wrong, but I've made it twice now, and it's NOT thin. And that's using half the sugar! But that's ok, it still turned out great! Needed more like 55 minutes to bake.

My family and friends LOVED it---even the couple of people who don't like cobblers. They cleared out the pan in less than 30 minutes. Would highly recommend the recipe and was even able to put it together with my 4yr old helping.

This was tasty. It bubbled out of my 11x7, so I think I'd use the next size up next time. I left out the cinnamon for someone's preference, but I would add some if I made it again.

I have used my grandma's wonderful, but very time consuming recipe for years, this was so good.  My husband who swears he "hates" Blueberry Cobbler, couldn't keep out of it!  The only thing I did diffrent was change the 1 1/2 cups of white sugar in the filling to 1 cup white, 1/2 brown and put some butter pats on the top when it baked....  yummy stuff

This is the BEST cobbler I've ever made or eaten - my best friend also made it and said she would give it 10 stars out of 5! It is amazing.  I did add about 1/8 of a tsp of vanilla to the batter.  What a great way to end the evening - and for my husband to start his day - he ate almost 1/2 the pan the first time I made it.

I made this as stated except using 3/4 c. sugar in each part.  Yum!  I had lots of compliments and some asked for seconds.  I tried it both with and without ice cream and I like it better without, since the ice cream overpowered the flavor of the cobbler. I'll be making this again.  Thanks Poodleowner2!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I will certainly do it again, but I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar by 1/2 both in the batter and in the topping.  The sweetness was just right, not cloying.

I have to say this was fantastic!!!  It did come a little runny and for that I was going to take away a star but the taste is so darn good I just can't do that.  LOL  It was a really easy recipe to make too which is a plus.  As per some reviewers advice I cut the sugar to 1 cup for the batter and 3/4 cup for the topping.  Still it was quite sweet.

this was a great mid week "throw together" dessert. Pretty tasty for something so quick and easy. The bread portion was nice and crisp when I took it out of the oven. An 8x8 inch  teflon pan is ideal to bake this dish in. My son gobbled this right up, then came back for seconds! 
I used fresh blueberries

Nice recipe, I cut down the sugar, both bottom and top, just because I'm always trying to cut down sugar! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

The cakey part of the cobbler was really nice and fluffy.  Next time I will definitely use LESS sugar on top.

Good cobbler...I used two cups of frozen blueberries and a cup of frozen blackberries.  I reduced the boiling water to half a cup and used three quarters of a cup of sugar in the batter and topping.  While it was good, I'll probably try a different cobbler recipe next time.

Wow!  Fantastic!  I did just as the last reviewer said with the sugar.  Perfect!  Mine took a little longer in the oven, about 55 minutes.  I served this with vanilla ice cream and it was SOOOOO good ;)

Love this recipe! I also halved the sugar and it came out perfect. Ever since I found this recipe I made it about 3 times in as many days, that's how fast it went! Warm some up and pile on some vanilla bean ice cream and you are in heaven!

This is really a great recipe. I do have to admit I was a little nervous about pouring the hot water over the top, but it turned out great. Nice crispy crust. The best cobbler recipe I've come across.

This recipe is great! We had taken our grandaughter out to the berry farm and I had a fews pounds of fresh blueberries.  I did what other suggested, cutting back the sugar to 3/4 cup for both.  Great ala mode.

I made this recipe last week as a trial run for company I was having the following weekend.  I really like this recipe, but boy was it ever sweet. I cut the sugar but obviously not enough. I think 3/4 cup on both parts of the recipe would be enough.  I will be making this recipe for our company with the sugar reduction.  This recipe was easy and would be wonderful served warm with ice cream.  I did reheat a small portion in the microwave and it made the crust mushy.

I have never rated a recipe online before, and I had to write in about this one.  It was FABULOUS.  My kids absolutely loved it.  I decreased the sugar as suggested and it was plenty sweet.  I will make this again and again.  Looked beautiful, tasted better.

I made this recipe exactly as written and whooooeeee you could go into a diabetic coma it is so sweet.  HOWEVER, my husband adored it so I will continue to make this.  I used frozen berries as that is all I had, cut back on the water to 1/2 cup and it was delicious.

Was pretty easy, that's always a plus for me. I thought that there was a little too much salt though. I could still taste the salt when it was done and having cut down the sugar to 3/4 c per part (per other suggestions) and upping the milk ... I thought being able to taste the salt wasn't good. It was fairly easy. HINT: use a foil disposable pan for EASY and quick cleanup. Will definitely make again.

I reduced the sugar as recomended in several reviews and I am glad I did. I probably could have reduced it even more. With that said, this recipe was fantastic!! I made a small one for my kids to try before making a large one to take to church for a pot luck. What a hit! I loved it and I do not normally eat a lot of blueberries or things made with blueberries. This is definitely in my recipe box at home. Thanks

This was great.  Used half the sugar (will probably cut down the amount of sugar on for the topping next time), used skim milk, 4 T. butter, and half white flour and half whole wheat flour.  Worked like a charm!

I'm not sure what kind of magic is involved in this rather strange sounding preparation but it works and it's amazing. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup in each part but otherwise changed nothing. Used frozen blueberries. This was so delicious, it disappeared like magic, too, and I had to make another pan the next day! Awesome recipe!

Way too sweet! I made this recipe as written, except for the fact I did not have a fresh lemon so I used two tablespoons lemon juice, and I also substituted 2 % milk for the whole. I did like the way the crust crisp up on top, but it was just so sweet I could not even finish eating my portion. I saw that other reviewers had mentioned cutting back on the sugar, and I sure wish I had! The berry flavor was so overwhelmed by how sickeningly sweet the cake part was. Two of my kids liked it just fine, but they're sugar fiends, so that explains it!

I did cut back the sugar to 3/4 C each on crust and topping, per other reviews and am very glad I did - it was perfect.  Will make again, maybe adding more blueberries.

This is by far and away my favorite cobbler recipe! I make it EXACTLY as written and it turns out beautifully every time! It forms the most delicious sugar crust on the top! You will not be disappointed!

Easy and delicious . I changed the servings to 12 and baked in a 13 x 9 dish.  I made a day prior to a noon lunch and the topping was crispy and the fresh blueberries I used did not run all over.  Cutting into square serving sizes was easy.  I baked for appx 1 hour.  Definitely a repeat recipe

As with a lot of other reviewers I was not fond of the topping.  I also cut own on the sugar to 1/2 C each with the filling and the topping.  It was just right with the sweetness.  I did like the filling, though.

the amount of milk needs to be tweaked a little. the batter is supposed to be thin, but it was very thick with the 3/4 cup of milk. i just splashed a little more in and it came out great!

10 25 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/72469/yummy-blueberry-cobbler/ ... Read reviews, reduced sugar to 2/3c in batter & on top.  Because of reducing sugar in batter, I only used 3T butter.  I also reduced the salt to 1/2t & put it in the batter, not on top.  Rather than a pinch of cinnamon, I did a couple shakes, 1/8 to 1/4t & mixed it with the sugar topping.  Wow, changes, one more:  1/2c boiling water, not 3/4c.  Reason:  frozen (juicy) homegrown (sweet) berries.  Since reading of overflow, I upped the dish to 8x11.5 & then with only one layer of berries in places, added another cup.  Yeah, I did.  :)  Good idea.  It was  fine.  I'd reduce the sugar topping more if I made it again, but it wasn't too sweet; just me wanting less sugar.  It gave it a crunchy top.  Pretty nice.  :D  'Can't say I know the definition of "cobbler," but this wouldn't come to mind even though it is good.  It's more of a blueberry pie filling topped with coffeecake.  That's not a bad thing, just different  than most.  I give it 3 stars; E & S, 4.  K said it smelled good, but didn't try.  :?  :D

I made it with fresh blueberries and it was so good and easy, I made another one with frozen cherries and added chocolate chips to the batter. So delicious. Like others, I cut back on sugar and added vanilla to batter. I found I needed a little extra milk as well to make it the right consistency. Will definitely make again.

I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup on the top layer.  I also added 4 cups of blueberries instead of 3.   I mixed cinnamon in with the cornstarch and sugar and salt.  This was a really good recipe.  I might add a little more milk or water next time for a runnier texture.  Over all very good, and did not boil over like has happened to some people.  I used a 7 x 11 pan.

This was amazing!!!!  The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter and people raved about it.   The second time I made it, I used 3/4 C sugar for the top layer and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp.   Everyone still raved about it.   I will continue to make this delicious dessert.

I made this exactly as the recipe required. It was soooo sweet that it's just too rich. I think nearly 3 cups of sugar is just way too much for a small dish. Also the blueberries on the bottom were soupy. If I ever made this again I would not make the first topping, put some cornstarch in the berries and just top it with the flour mixture.

This got mixed reviews at my house. My kiddo thought it was delicious, hubby said it wasn't worth the calories ("too sugary and not doughy enough"), and personally, I thought it was pretty good. I was a bit worried about the 1.5 cups of sugar being added to the top of the topping. I enjoyed learning the technique of pouring boiling water over a sugary topping to kind of glaze the top. Thanks for posting!

I did like the final product. The dough was not at all thin like the recipe states, so that's my main concern, I was confused by this recipe. It's like a biscuit dough really. I also reduced the sugar and used frozen berries. In the end it was yummy. It also took an hour to bake and not 45 minutes as stated (maybe using frozen berries had something to do with that).

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband declared it was a "keeper".  I loved the fresh taste of the berries and lemon. It took slightly longer to get "golden brown"; almost an hour. Maybe this is why some reviewers didn't like the texture.  I'll be making again!

Great, yummy recipe! I will definitely be making again. I took others advice and decreased the amount of sugar and it turned out great. I also took advice about putting it in a smaller casserole dish, but be advised, it takes longer to cook the topping if you do this. I will be putting it in the originally suggested 9X11 next time.

A good starting point for cobbler but way too much sugar. Would give it 5 stars with the following adjustments: Bake in 9x13 pan. Sprinkle some cinnamon on the blueberries. Make 1.5 times the batter recipe but using only 3/4 cup sugar and add 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt. Batter is not thin - more like a frosting consistency. Use only 1/2 cup sugar in the topping and add up to 1 tsp cinnamon. Next time I will also add some fresh grated orange rind to the blueberries and lemon juice.

I love this recipe! Instead of doing all blueberries, I made it with half blueberries and cherries! Still great!

It was fast and delicious...I decreased the amount of sugar but the rest was followed to the letter and my family gobbled it up...

This turned out beautifully and was delicious. I did cut down on the sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla to my milk.

I used the recipe for frozen blackberries and it was excellent!  I used 1% milk and it was fine.   I left out the cinnamon (for blackberries) and will leave out the salt next time as it was kind of obnoxious.  Overall, a wonderful recipe!

I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup in both places in the recipe and cut the boiling water to 1/2 cup because the first time I made it there was a bit too much liquid. This time it's perfect!

UNBELIEVABLY delicious! I regret that I forgot to add the cinnamon before I added the water at the end, but I'm not sure it could've been any better. I did cut down on the sugar at the end, but this was a fantastic dessert no matter what! The berries were liquidy, but that's how cobbler is supposed to be.  I will be making again and again trying different berries.

This cobbler was hands down perfection!! I got so many race reviews and I myself was impressed. Just delicious. The only thing I changed was the I baked in a 9 inch pie plate and I didn't add all the sugar mixture on top. I used about half. But it was so delicious especially when paired with vanilla ice cream.

Excellenct cobbler! My husband and I ate half the pan in one night. Couple of changes - like many others I changed the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup for both. It was plenty sweet. Reduced salt to 1/4 tsp because I reduced the sugar. I used a tablespoon of lemon juice instead of fresh (it's what I had in the house). I didn't have fresh blueberries so I thawed one pound of frozen and reduced the amount of boiling water to 3/8 cup. And I like cinnamon so I actually dusted the entire pan of blueberries with it before adding the batter. I also cooked mine for about an hour. It thickened everything up nicely. I will be making this many more times. Fairly easy and amazingly delicious! Can't wait to have an excuse to make this for a dinner party!

I did reduce the sugar and still was too sweet for my taste but great in all other aspects, I will make it again with even less sugar and will venture with other fruit as well. Thank you!

This recipe was so easy, my 11 year old made it!  She used 3, 6 oz containers of fresh blueberries. We also substituted buttermilk for regular milk. I think it gives it a little extra flavor.

DELICIOUS!!! My husband told me it was the best "cake" he has ever had!  Considering we are recently married and I have been trying to impress him with my cooking (he's always maintained the idea that I couldn't cook when we were dating) this past month I would say this is a definite win!  He did mention that it was a little too sweet so I might cut back on the sugar a little next time but overall very tasty!  We made it with fresh wild blueberries we picked over the weekend by Lake Superior and topped it off with a dollop of whipped cream.  It doesn't get any better!

This cobbler was delicious!  The only thing I changed was to slightly reduce the sugar to 1 cup each and I used a 8x8 pan because that was all I had available.  I've never made cobbler before, this recipe was easy for my 4 year old son and me to do easily and it came out so good. I'll definitely be making this again and again.

This was a good starting point. I followed the directions and used the majority of the reviews for guidance in decreasing the amount of sugar. This recipe still has some flaws though. It does not come out with a cobbler texture which is disappointing but I think with a few minor tweaks it will work.

I took the advice of most others and reduced the sugar in the dough to 3/4 cup and 1/4 cup on top. I also added some raspberries since I had some. I will definitely use the recipe again.

Def suggest cutting  the sugar in each portion. I used 3/4 cup in each and still slighlty too sweet for my taste but kids loved!
Sustituted vanilla silk soymilk and earth balance vegan buttery stick. Used 1 cup all-purp flour & 1/2 cup wheat flour. Dough wasnt so thin but easily spreadable. Also added extra cinnamon on top. Otherwise followed recipe but with 2 3/4 cups fresh picked bluberries. 
Baked in pyrex round 9.5" dish. 
Everyone loved! And they couldnt believe it was vegan! So yummy!

This was just okay for me.  It's nothing like I think a cobbler should be.  My batter was not "thin" or "smooth" at all, so I added milk to it.  This resulted in a crust that was more dumpling-like, a gelatinous goo, actually.  Maybe the recipe has a typo in it and it should read "thick".   After cutting way back on the sugar, the filling has a great taste, but I will keep looking for the perfect cobbler.

Excellent.  I didn't have corn starch so didn't use it.  I don't know how it could possibly have been better with corn starch???  I'm going to use this same recipe to make peach cobbler when the peaches come in a month or so!

It says that the batter "will be thin"...mine definitely was not.  Also, the 1-1/8 cup of sugar topping just sat on top and had to be brushed off, what a waste.  I did NOT add the water because it made no sense to me.  Thankfully I didn't because the whole thing bubbled over anyways and it would have been an even bigger mess if I had.  One thing I did was add 2/3 cup of milk to the batter to make it thinner when I realized it wasn't thin enough to spread out over the berries.  With my adjustments it cooked up nicely. I'd make it again with my adjustments only:2/3 cup extra milk in batter, no water at the end, only 1/4c sugar for topping or maybe substitute an oatmeal crumb topping or some coconut.

This was a fabulous cobbler, one of the best I have ever made with blueberries.  I added some vanilla to the crust .and a little extra cinnamon to the topping.  It is totally a five star recipe!

Excellent!! Used the tip of only 3/4 cup sugar for each part & when it came time to put sugar mixture on top I didn't use it all. It just seemed like too much sugar! So I think 1/2 cup on the sugar mixture would be plenty. Vanilla ice cream on top & it was a great way to use up our u-pick blueberries!

This was really good. I followed other reviewers and used 1/2 c. of sugar in each step that called for it. It was plenty sweet with the 1 cup total of sugar. Will definitely use this recipe again with other fruits as well.
