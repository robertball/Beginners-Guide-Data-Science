Fabulous! I made this with what I had on hand which meant omitting fresh parsley & pimentos. I also forgot to add the butter. I put this in a small casserole, topped with a sprinkle of parm and baked for 15 mins @ 350. It was a delicious hot dip. I used tostito scoops and crostini. Excellent!

Awesome!  We seasoned our salmon filet before searing it.  Then, we substituted the sour cream for mayo.  We LOVE this dip hot!!  It is even good as the filling for a lettuce wrap!!

This was yummy. I used a salmon fillet in it's own microwavable pouch, orange bourbon flavored. Also as some others recommended, used mayo instead of sour cream plus I added one dash of liquid smoke. Loved it!! Perfect for crackers or snacking with some toasted bread and veggies.

DELICIOUS dip. Can't say enough good things about it. I did not use canned salmon and instead bought fresh grilled salmon from the market. And instead of using just sour cream, I used half sour cream and half mayonnaise. I served this on sun dried tomato and rosemary focaccia chips. Excellent recipe and feeds a generous amount of people. Highly recommended!!!

This turned out very well.  I used mayo instead of sour cream, added a few drops of liquid smoke and used chopped red pepper instead of pimento.  Made small cream puff shells and filled open halves with the dip.  Very good!

Recipe good on crackers, however would taste better with more spices.  I added more dill, parsley, garlic and onion.

Served this on cucumber slices for a "garden cucumber fest" at my office. Very tasty. I also tried it with smoked salmon...lent an almost bacon-y flavor to the dip.  Thanks for a creative recipe.

It was great! I wanted to put some liquid smoke in, but I did not have any. Instead, I used 1/4 tea. smoked paprika. It gave it an excellent  color and flavor (I will try to add a photo). I also substituted the sour cream for mayonnaise, and added 1/4 tea. garlic powder.

My 5 year old, said it was better than baked beans, and that's his favorite. I didn't even refriderate it and he was eating it right out of the bowl. I did grate some lemon zest and it really brought all the flavors together and perked it up a bit. I also made it with boiled salmon, I was acutally making it for the cat and had so much left over.  It was an excellent choice for this dish. Oh, i also used sweet smoked paprika

I halved all the ingredients except for the salmon. I also omitted the butter completely. Replace the sour cream with olive oil based mayo and use lowfat cream cheese.  Its a much healthier version.  Still turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I like the cream cheese and sourcream in this recipe. I added 1-2 tsp horseradish, some capers, and salt/pepper for taste. It gets light and creamy when you use the hand mixture-another nice touch. Tips: Don't add too much sourcream like I did-because I didn't measure it. It was a little to thinned out, so I added about 1/3 can more salmon and that seemed to "bulk it up" to the right consistency. I also did not have pimentos, so I substitued a small can of mild green chiles and it worked well-very similar to pimentos in taste and texture.

The basic recipe was just *okay* for me. I tried it cold AND warmed up in the oven.  I prefer it warm, but it still needed something. It was lacking in flavor (for us at least).  I only had a 14.75 oz. can of Salmon, so I doubled everything else. I also used half mayo have sour cream, as per other reviewer's rec's.  I upped the amount of parsley and chopped up some sweet Vidalia onion, along with some green onions, and garlic.  I also threw in a can of chopped artichoke hearts, a couple drops of liquid smoke (again, as others suggested), & red chili pepper flakes to try and add "something" to this dip.  I think (and I could be wrong), some capers would go really well in here.  In fact, that MAY be what I feel like I'm missing. IDK.  Either way, it's not bad per se, just lacking in some flavor.  We ate these with Parmesan, Garlic & Herb Baked Pita Chips just to add extra flavor.  Those helped too. :)

Very tasty with fresh salmon left over from a previous meal. Added some ranch dressing to smooth it out which seemed to complement the dish. Baked it in the oven at 350 and served warm with crackers.

Amazing. I did not use butter and peppers, and added fresh dill, scallion, and parley. Turned out soooo good. This will definitely be a staple for my weekend dinner parties.

I made this recipe using chopped red pepper and leftover grilled salmon.  Served in phyllo cups sprinkled with a little paprika.   They were a huge hit at a home party!!!  Will definitely make this again but will try it with the pimentos next time.

We loved this for a light lunch. I did cut the recipe in half since only 2 of us were eating. I left out the pimentos since I didn't have any and I used a leftover dill baked salmon steak. I think next time I would totally omit the butter and try some other suggestions such as the capers and maybe a dash of hot sauce but it is still delicious as is.

This was an excellent dip that received great reviews from my guests. I followed much of the advice listed:  added horseradish, extra dill, sweet paprika, salt, capers, substituted half the sour cream with mayo.  I also used only 2 tbsp butter which was plenty.  I had to make it the next day for my family because they had to share the day before!

I made this dip so many times, I needed to rate it. It is SO good that I haven't found anybody to not like it so far, my picky kids and all guests say this is fabulous! I made it as a snack for Thanksgiving and I'm going to make it again for my Xmas guests.  Sometimes I make it with goat cheese (a whole Costco roll, I  mix it with some water before to make it more creamy), you can't tell it's goat cheese and it makes it healthier. Sometimes I make a double batch because it's so good and it disappears quickly and I like to have leftovers for the next day (snack or kids lunch at school). Oh, in general I use green onions chopped very finely and it looks great with the green of the onions.

Very good.  I did make a few changes, though to intensify the flavor and to use a few things that I had on hand.  Used 1 scallion, all parts, minced, greatly increasing the onion to about 2 tablespoons.  Used 1/2 red bell pepper minced (didn't have a jar of pimentos), greatly increasing the pepper, and it made it pretty.  Used way more parsley.  Added about 2 tsps. fresh lemon juice.  Added about 1/2 tsp. hot sauce.  This is great on crackers, even boring ones - I just had saltines.

This recipe is a winner!  So simple and good.  I used green onion and chives flavored cream cheese instead of plain cream cheese.  I added cayenne pepper for spice and used dry parsley since I didn't have fresh.  I also didn't have dill weed so I added a tiny amount of dill pickle juice.  Absolutely loved it!

It seemed to be a hit but needs  more seasoning. Perhaps a carribean spice might be good.  It would have been better if I would have made it earlier so flavors could meld.  It was super easy to make.

I found it a bit bland and I would not add the butter, it really kills the flavor of the salmon. I added capers, dill, lemon pepper and another can of salmon.

This is the most awesome salmon dip recipe! I've made this several times as is and the recipe is just great. I tweaked it once with 7 oz. of fresh salmon cooked in garlic butter and 2 minced, smoked chipotle peppers...WoW! Mmmm-Mmmm, good!
