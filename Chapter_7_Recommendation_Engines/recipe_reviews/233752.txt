Pretty good.. I was able to make one big loaf with this recipe.  To the other reviews that said it was missing something, I'd suggest adding 1 teaspoon of lemon extract. It adds a little zingyness to the bread and compliments the flavor of the bananas and strawberries. Thanks for the recipe!

Best recipe for ratio of fruit to carbs, fat and sugar.  Best fiber content too. Used handpicked Michigan berries for gorgeous color.  Great texture too.

I’m on a gluten-free/natural sugar only diet so I used home-ground oat flour instead of wheat flour and I used 1/2 C raw, unfiltered honey instead of sugar. I’ve got to say this is the best dessert I’ve been able to eat with these restrictions. Tasted delicious while also being very nourishing!

Made this recipe and forgot to put in vanilla because it wasn't mentioned in the instructions anywhere. That might be a good thing to add in! still pretty good though !

I halved the recipe,  and subbed honey for the sugar and coconut oil for the olive oil.  You can taste the wheat flour and the oats, but it was all good.  I think the full recipe would fit into one good-sized loaf pan.

This bread was ok. I was looking for a way to use up some strawberries before they went bad. I followed the recipe except I used 3 bananas, which ended up making enough batter to perfectly fill the two pans. This bread just seems to be missing something, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I added a little cinnamon, brown sugar & walnuts on top which helped, but I think I'll stick to my regular banana bread.

I was looking for a healthier version of a quick bread to use up some bananas and strawberries.  I thought there were several problems with this bread.  I thought it would have a lot of flavor with the bananas, strawberries, cinnamon,& vanilla, but, I thought it was lacking something.  I think it may need some extra cinnamon and maybe even a touch of salt to bring out the flavors.  It was a little drier than most quick breads, but, it did use less oil.  Maybe adding a little applesauce would help.  My husband thought it needed to be sweeter also.  I guess that would defeat the healthier side of it if more sugar was added though!  Maybe a mixture of brown and white sugar?  The previous reviewer suggested putting the bread into one loaf pan.  Although it does make shorter loaves I think I would keep them in two pans.  It took 25 minutes to bake in two pans it was perfectly golden on top.  I think if you put it into one pan it would burn on the top and bottom before it is cooked.  I would not make this again - there would be too many changes to it for me to make the recipe to our liking.

Like the author of this recipe I was looking for a way to use up bananas and strawberries.This recipe is good and I will make it again, however the instruction to use 2, 9 by 5 loaf pans is unnecessary. You can easily cook it all in one. Because I didn't know better and only had one loaf pan I made half as muffins. Still tastes good but ended up with a short loaf. Next time I make this I will add a tablespoon of molasses as it could use a little brown sugar flavor.
