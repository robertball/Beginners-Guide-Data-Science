I have used both scallops and shrimp when making this and they both work great! I used a little more orange zest, cream and wine than was called for in the recipe. I added a pinch of pepper to the sauce when it was done cooking. I cut the shrimp in smaller pieces once they were done cooking. The overall taste of the sauce was quite pleasant and different from the cream sauces I've had. The orange zest added a little something that made this sauce quite unique. I think it needed a little more garlic in the sauce; the shrimps were seasoned nicely. I served this over store-bought porcini mushroom-stuffed tortelloni. We like out pasta dishes saucy, so we will double that portion of the recipe next time. I would definitely make this again!

The flavor was very good, but as I was cooking the cream, butter and wine, it separated. The scallops got overcooked. I would suggest that you don't reheat the scallops, they get too tough.

I don't eat seafood my husband does.I came across this recipe and it peeked my interest so I gave it a try. I cut up a chicken breast and cooked as directed,then in the same pan I cooked the scallops as directed.I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I split the sauce between the two meats,so very very good, the orange is a nice flavor and not at all over powering.I asked my husband to rate he said 10. I asked why he said because I made scallops LOL I asked what about the sauce, he replied it was banging and then I put the scallops in and made it heaven.

I thought this dish was very good.  I used a small onion chopped fine because I did not have any green onions.  I also used Season All Seasoned Salt in place of regular salt.  I gives it a little more flavor.  I cooked the scallops about 1 1/2 minute on each side and did not put back in the pan until the sauce had thickened.  If you are not careful, you will overcook the scallops making them tough.I would make this dish again.

My family loves scallops and are always trying to find new ways to cook them. This one will be added to the recipe file to make again. The sauce was perfect. I didn't have a problem with the wine and cream separating. Although I did need to add a little flour to thicken it up. I also didn't let the scallops heat for 5' it took about 3' and then I pulled them off the low heat. They were perfect. I followed other reviewers advice and added a little more pepper to the sauce. Very tasty recipe

The sauce separated and didn't thicken the way I was expecting it should. The flavor was marginal. I made this for my family of 7 and only one person liked it (and I think he only said so to be polite!)
