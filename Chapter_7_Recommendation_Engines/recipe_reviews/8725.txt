This was great and so easy.  I only had the frozen chicken breasts (like you buy at Sam's Club) I threw them in the pot frozen (didn't pre-boil) and took the advice of some of the others and cut down on the liquid and the butter.  Instead of water I used a can of vegtable broth, but I think it needed just a tad more liquid than that.  I also cooked it longer (like 6 hours).  The chicken absolutely fell apart and had a wonderful flavor, probably from the veg.broth).  Overall, it was great!  Will definately make again.

I had success with this recipe after reading the other reviews.  I cut the butter in half, and cut down on the water.  I also placed frozen chicken drumsticks in the crockpot 3-4 hours before I added the dressing mixture on top, and after a couple more hours of cooking they were both done to perfection.  It was even better left over!  Don't give up the first time if it doesn't come out right...it's worth experimenting a little until you get it the way you like it!  Enjoy!

I stumbled upon this recipe; had all the ingredients, read the other reviews and VOILA!!  This is a real winner!  The changes I made were to use 3/4Cup of butter and about 1+ Cup of the chicken broth...Just enough to get it "mushy"...I cooked for 5 hrs on Low.  The onion and celery were al dente which was fine.  VERY good recipe!  Reheated in the microwave the next day is wonderful!!

Good recipe - I do agree - use a lot less liquid than specified!!  I just mixed diced raw chicken into the mixture before cooking and used one can of chicken broth - which was a little too much!!!  I pre-sauteed the onion and celery until al dente.  I used half white and half whole grain bread. I also threw in a handful of orange-flavored, dried cranberries and some sliced raw mushrooms (which will add their own liquid while cooking!).     Next time - I'll use really tough french bread and whole grain bread  and will add even more dried cranberries - they made it really "Thanksgiving-like"!!!!

OMG!!!..This is such a great recipe. Fast to make and great tasting.  I read the other reviews before making it for the first time.  I followed alot of their suggestions of cutting back on the butter and liquid, which IO did.  1/2 cup of butter is more than enough. I also toasted the bread light brown before cutting it in cubes. I used 1 chicken boullion disolved in 1 cup of the fluid left over from poaching the chicken.  I had chicken backs that I wanted to use, instead of breast. I took off the skin, but  left the bone in, to hold the meat together.  I put the meat on the bottom of crock pot, then covered with the dressing. Dried cranberries were the added touch this needed.  It was so nice to come home from work and only have to prepare a vegetable to go with supper.  I will certainly make this again.

This recipe has potential, but the liquid measurements have got to be wrong.
I would cut the butter and reserved cooking liquid in half.  Also, you don't have
to bother toasting the bread cubes if you use day-old french bread.

11/10/2003:  Wow!  This was great!  I followed the earlier suggestions to half the liquid and the butter.  I also put frozen chicken leg quarters in the slow cooker first, and then boned and skinned the chicken before adding the rest of the ingredients.  My family raved for days about this recipe.  Thanks, Peg!  This will definitely be on my list of "best" recipes!  
Update 1/2/2017:  Fourteen years later, this recipe is still used in several of my nieces' and nephews' Thanksgiving and Christmas BEST stuffing recipes!  It has been adapted by some to be more vegetarian by leaving out the chicken.  Other families have made it more low-carb, by using low-carb bread.  But Peg's original recipe definitely ranks in the top ten of my family's holiday MUST HAVE recipes!  
Another UPDATE 11/22/2017:  Over the years I've had the best luck with this recipe when I've used the best tasting bread I can find.  The absolute ultimate was when I mixed Russian Black Bread (which is slightly sweet), with toasted English Muffin bread.  (That year, even the teenage nieces and nephews who wont talk to me, smiled at me in appreciation!)  
Unfortunately,  Franz Bakeries has stopped making the  Russian Black bread, so this year I am trying Kings Hawaiian Bread (slightly sweet), with toasted English Muffins, and homemade white bread.  However, the only  time I really regretted my bread choice was when I used the pre-packaged dried cubes which are sold for stuffing.  Don't do that!

I poached the chicken breasts in a broth / water mixture with a bay leaf, then cubed the chicken before I added it to the crock pot. I used a couple of loaves of day old bread, one was white and the other was a whole wheat.  I used a lot of sage because it's a flavor we enjoy. This was really good, really easy (if I had used dressing mix instead of cubing and toasting the bread myself it'd be nearly effortless). It's a good dish for a cold day...made the house smell like the holidays were on the way!

So good!!! The flavor of the stuffing was out of this world! DH said he could eat it every day! After reading the other reviews, I too cut the butter in half and used less liquid ( 2 cups chicken broth) The other changes I made were, I sauteed the onion and celery in olive oil, used frozen boneless chicken breasts, and used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water. I will cut the butter down even more next time ( 1/4 cup?) and since it was mushy, I will cut the broth back to maybe 1-1 1/2 cups . Really though......very very tasty and easy! I put it in my favorites...thanks!

Just a hint, I tilted the lid to the crock pot about an hour towards the end and the liquid dry up quite a bit. There was so much steam on the lid that I decided this might be the problem. It was the consistency of the stuffing that comes right out of the turkey at Thanksgiving. My Mom thought I'd made a turkey with only a few weeks to go.

I used a package of sage stuffing mix from Pepperidge Farm, cut down the butter to 1/2 cup and used 2 1/2 cups of the juice from the chicken with bullion added (for flavor)  I placed 1/2 of the stuffing on the bottom of the crock pot and then the chicken breasts and the remainder of stuffing on top.  Turned out wonderful.  I cooked it on low for 3 hours, any more and it would have burned.

13 cups cubed bread?!!  There's no way my crockpot could fit that much in there.  I used a box and a half of Mrs. Cubbison's stuffing cornbread which is more like 5 cups.  So I halved the butter and liquid.  I also added craisins which really added to the taste.  The chicken meat was 3 bone in chicken breasts I just cooked in vegetable broth for a few hours then added the mixed dressing on top of it.  I had no idea what "escalloped chicken" was but basically it turned out like chicken and stuffing.

I did the same as many did.  Reduced the liquid, used frozen chicken breasts, chicken broth, and added dried cranberries.  It was very good and my family loved it.  I couldn't stop sneaking taste.

I made this when my Mother-in-law was staying with us, and it was a big hit with the whole crew. The suggested 1 1/2 cups of liquid worked great for me. I was very scared to try this recipe, but I am so glad I did.

I don't know what went wrong. It had some good reviews so it had to be me. I had 2 nice whole breasts on the bone from my organic pastured chickes I raise. I brined them for 24hrs and then browned them and put them on the bottom of the crockpot. I figured the bones would serve as a rack. Then I moistened some cornbread stuffing mix with chicken broth and the mushroom soup,leaving it a little drier than usual because of the mushy reviews. Put the stuffing on top of the chickens and set on low for 8hrs. Went to work and bragged to everyone about what a good meal I was going to have,even called my daughter and invited her family over. Came hoe fro work expecting the house to smell like Thanksgiving. Instead it smelled life my furnace blew up. I opened the crockpot and the stuffing looked like watery oatmeal. I dug down deeper to find the chicken burned on the bottom so bad that I couldn't even pry it off. I don't even know how that's possible. We opened a couple bottles of wine and gave it the cerimonius send off along with a few laughs,crockpot and all went into the garbage. I don't know what I could do differently. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears. The upside????I get a shiney new crockpot.

Took advice from previous reviews and cut butter and broth as indicated.  I substituted the bread cubes and spices for sage stuffing mix (big bag)and that saved time and worked well. Recipe turned out well but if I make again I would add fresh mushrooms to the stuffing.  It was an ok dish, nothing I will rush to make again soon.

This meal reminded me of Thanksgiving! It was delicious. I used 4 large frozen chicken breasts and placed them into the bottom of the crock pot. Cubed some french bread and placed on top of chicken. Then made the soup mixture using 2 cups of chicken broth for liquid. I cut the butter to 3/4 cup, but would do 1/2 cup next time. The stuffing came out a little too wet, but it was wonderful over mashed potatoes! After refridgerating and reheating it was firmed up and the perfect consistency. It is even better the next day!

I'm sorry but this was not a great recipe. My husband, daughter and I all thought it was way too salty and too watery. I even baked my bread a little drier. As for the butter, wow, way too much. I won't be making or even trying to amend this recipes again.

Very good flavor. If you like stuffing and moist poultry, this is the dish for you. I omit the seasonings and use a large box of cornbread stuffing mix. I used margarine in place of butter once and no celery; it was not nearly as good.  My family likes this served with a green vegetable and cranberry sauce on the side. No leftovers here!

I took the advice from several reviews and cut the butter as well as the liquid in half.  The flavor is good but it still comes out pretty soggy.  I'll probably keep the recipe just because it's so easy-- but if you're really craving chicken and stuffing, I'd go the extra mile and do them the old fashioned way.

This (stuffing part) tasted ok, but the texture and appearance were just disgusting and the chicken breasts needed more flavor

We loved this recipe, even my 2 year old!  Very comforting.  I did reduce the butter to 1/2 a cup and am not sure how much broth/cooking liquid I used, just added until it was moist but not soggy.  I also put the breasts in the cooker with some water and chicken base, s/p, fresh thyme sprigs and a splash of chardonnay for about 45 minutes before adding the stuffing mix on top.  I used the liquid to moisten the stuffing and then added some more water/chicken base to the bread until moist.  I also added fresh sage to the mix rather than dried and chopped some mushrooms for the stuffing mix, to hide for picky eaters.  One more thing, I added a handful of dried currants to the stuffing, I was out of cranberries.  The chicken was moist, flavorful and extremely tender.  The stuffing was yummy too, just moist enough.  I served with steamed green beans.  I will definitely be making this again this winter.

Taste was so so, but the dish is soggy and just looks unappetizing.

This was really easy and tasty for a crock pot dinner. I did reduce the liquid and butter  as some reviewers suggested.I wanted something different for my lonely chicken breast and this fit the bill.

I, too, cut the butter and liquid.  The flavor was terrific.  The texture of the stuffing was quite mushy though.  So maybe try what the other person did and put the chicken in first and the stuffing in after a couple of hours???

the flavor was incredibly good but the end result was soupy. I will definitely make it again but I will reduce the recipe to 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/2 or 1 cup chicken broth

There are details missing from this recipe.  How can one slow-cook fully cooked chicken for 4 to 8 hours?

Will NOT make again. Came out really mushy. Just can't take the consistency.

This was pretty good. I used boneless/skinless chicken tenderloins instead of whole breasts because that's what I had in my freezer. The only change I made was to sprinkle some paprika on top for a little color. My 5 & 6 yr old boys enjoyed it, and they're super picky eaters.

I read a lot of the reviews and I took a little from many. I used Frozen Chicken breasts directly from the freezer and I substituted a can of chicken broth for the water. I lightly toasted Italian bread and white bread to make the cubes. I did decrease the butter to 3/4 cup and I added the craisins as someone suggested as well and Voila' an awesome dish that I will make again.

I thought it was really good and I didn't have sage or poultry seasoning on hand. I used a garlic crust bread.

I made this recipe tonight and it was pure success! I didn't have white bread so I used garlic bread cubes instead. I was also out of poultry seasoning, so I used 1/2 tsp of Tuscan seasoning and 1/2 tsp of Montreal chicken seasoning in its place. I also added chopped red pepper and a layer of scalloped potatoes between the chicken and the dressing, which was creamy, thick, and simply delicious, on top of white rice. My boyfriend went back for 2nd and 3rd helpings! I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Peg!

It had good flavor, but the stuffing was mushy.  Not at all good leftover.
