These cookies pack a powerful taste of chocolate.  I made two different sizes - the smaller ones are definitely the right size.  I will make these again and again.

I was looking for something cheap and easy to make with the ingredients i had, these fit perfectly!  i did everything directed, except i made small 1/2 inch balls, and rolled them in powdered sugar when they came out of the oven. i did a few a second time as directed but it was almost too sweet. these were AWESOME! i WILL make these again and again! and to quote my husband, these are the best cookies you have ever made!

I found this recipe in an old Taste of Home cookbook and made it for the first time this year.  What a hit.  I've shared the recipe with several people and they've now passed it on to others.  What a great soft cookie - not at all crumbly.  It's wonderful.

I thought these would be round like snowballs, but mine came out slightly dome shaped cookies.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used margarine since I did not have butter.  Not what I expected, but the kids enjoyed them.

I have made these cookies several times now, I enjoy them very much. I have found that the ideal size is about that of a marble. Any larger and they are dry and too chocolatey, any smaller and all I can taste is the icing sugar. They are usually the first to go from my holiday baking platters.

I followed the instructions and the results were perfect. My husband said to give these a "10" rating. These cookies literally melt in your mouth, and have a nice chocolate flavor. Thanks very much Mary Lou!

Made them exactly as the recipe stated but added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  They were awesome and my family ate them up quickly.

The cookies were very good, but VERY chocolatey.  I think I would make the cookies much smaller next time.  The flavor was good and they were very easy to make.

Mine were crumbly/grainy. Had to bake them longer to see the cracks on top, maybe that was my problem. Not sure where I went wrong.

These were not good to me. There was a strange taste to them and they were kind of mushy/mealy.

Sorry, these were incredibly tasteless and crumbly.  Followed the recipe exactly, and watched for the cracks in the top to make sure they were done.  Don't get the high rating at all.

Wow. These are perfect! So soft! Soft on the outside and the inside... I have never had a cookie that has stayed like that before. I followed the recipe exactly, except for I let them cool on the pan for about 2 minutes after they were done, then rolled them in powdered sugar only once. They are very soft, so be careful, they fall apart easily at first. Also, my cookies were dome shaped... I don't know how some people got them to be ball shaped... they were still good though. Lastly, I would like to comment that they were not too chocolatey... my family found them to be perfect.

I watched these disappear before I had a chance to pack them up as gifts.  I made one change, based on an allrecipes video -- I added a teaspoon of ancho chili powder and a couple of liberal grinds of black pepper.  This intensified the taste and the depth of the cocoa.  I will definitely be commanded to make them next Christmas.

They also soften nicely when stored.  Great with a glass of milk.

Made these exactly as recipe is written, and they were great. 8 minutes was the perfect time. I think the other reviewers who got crumbly results cooked for too long. Don't overcook!!! They will be very soft when you take them out, and might look underdone, but let them sit on the sheet for a minute or two after you take them out and they set. THANKS!
