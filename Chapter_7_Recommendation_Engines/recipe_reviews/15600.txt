I don't know if my squash was not big enough or what, but the spices were extremely overwhelming and it was all you could taste!  I had to throw it away. Maybe with less of each of the spices it would be better. I was very disappointed.

Sheesh, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg for one squash is enough to choke a horse! I cut this down to a half teaspoon of cinnamon and just a pinch of the other spices and that was MORE than enough seasoning.  Even after adjusting seasoning it was just okay.

This really is not very good even altering the amounts of seasonings. I LOVE squash with these spices and I love pineapple so why not. I really will not make this again. It just didn't work together.

Way to much spice! We could barely finish our portions. More pineapple and butter would help. Also, cooking squash in microwave, then in oven after adding spices saves time.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I had a certain dessert quality to it, that was interesting.  I put a little more pinapple in that the recipe called for and next time I may try a little less.  Also, I cut way back on the spices.  I just sprinkled a little in with the pinapple and kept adding to taste.  Overall this is a good recipe!

Used cinnamon and cilantro, and less than called for.  Also more pineapple.

I used fresh pineapple and ginger. Put them both through my juicer and used the pulp. Then reduced all the spices to dashes; i.e. 1 tps = 1 dash added a tiny bit of butter. It was delicous

I loved this.. I used my common since on how much spice to use with what size squash I bought. I also added a small amount of home made maple syrup in it. I will make this again......

This recipe is exceptionally good. I do had more spices as I like them, but other than that, made no changes, it was great!

Definitely not a winner. Way, way, way too much spice. It totally overwhelmed the flavor of the squash. I wish I had read the reviews before I made it. This flop will be removed from my recipe box ASAP.

So many of the reviews warned against the spices being too overwhelming, so I just sprinkled them to taste. I know I didn't use anywhere near as much as what was called for. In the end, I loved the flavor the pineapple gave as well as the light flavor of the spices.

I found that the spices were too overpowering.  The only change I made was fresh pineapple instead of canned.

It was ok. It needed a little sweetness. I cheated a little by microwaving the squash to speed up cooking time. I also used fresh pineapple which I had in the house.  The next night when we finished the remaining half, I drizzled some maple syrup over the top.  Much better. I eould definitely try this again, but add a little sweetness to the recipe.
