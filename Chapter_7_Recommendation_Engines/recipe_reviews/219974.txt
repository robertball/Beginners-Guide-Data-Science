I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of broccoli, and I mixed in salt, pepper, and garlic to give flavor.  This is a healthy dish that is not too creamy and my boyfriend enjoyed it.

My son loves this recipe and he is a very picky eater. I do add more chicken, use chopped broccoli instead of florets  and I double the breadcrumbs and butter mixture for extra flavor.

Sorry 3 1/2 to 4 stars for me.  It was good but it wasn't great.  In my opinion it was a bit overkill with the broccoli.  I will substitute the creamed brocoli with cream of chicken soup instead next time that way it still incorporates the chicken, or perhaps double the recipe and do one of each for a larger family like mine. However it is super easy to make for a weeknight meal.

I have been making this recipe for a while, but instead of using the canned soup, I make a sauce using butter and flour, seasonings such as pepper, thyme, garlic, paprika, and low sodium chicken broth. I add some milk after the sauce thickens to make it more creamy. For the topping, i use sharp cheddar cheese and some panko bread crumbs. To me it makes more sense to use ingredients with no additives and lower sodium. I use real butter with no GMOs. It was ready in 45 minutes.

Good, simple and fast to make recipe. 
For more flavor I added the following: 1 can of mushrooms, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of broccoli/cheese soup, sauted onion, celery and garlic together then mixed it in with the soups. Sprinkled chopped green onions on top. Cut down to 1 tb spoon of breadcrums and instead of chicken breast I used 2 cans of canned chicken. Came out FANTASTIC!!!

My family loved this recipe.  I used sharp cheddar cheese and panko bread crumbs as well as cream of mushroom soup.  Great for a school night when you have a lot to do.

This was easy and I liked that it used ingredients I already had laying around. It wasn't spectactular but very good. I didn't the butter over top and didnt't miss it. Subbed Cream of Chicken for Cream of Broccoli, don't think that altered the recipe that much. Again, very good but not amazing.

I used cheddar cheese soup and I season the chicken with garlic salt, onion powder and pepper.  Then I mix the bread crumbs with butter and sprinkle on top.  When I made it just like the recipe, it was a little bland for me.  But with some simple substitutions, you can definitely make it what you want.  It’s also easy to double or triple for larger families.  It’s a nice dinner for a quick weeknight meal.

Our family loved this! I used cream of mushroom soup and more chicken. There was a tiny bit leftover, but only we all had a second helping. I also used seasoned croutons (finely ground in the food processor) instead of bread crumbs. We'll definitely make this dish again.

This dish is absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I made my own cream of chicken, since I didn't have cream of broccoli in a can. This was my first casserole and my fiance went crazy over this. I will be making this more often!

I was looking for a quick meal for a family on-the-go and gave this a try.  It was easy to prepare ready in 30 minutes.  It was a good combination of ingredients, but rather bland.  I'll make this again and experiment with adding some additional ingredients to make it 5-star.  Nevertheless, the casserole dish was empty by the end of the meal so it was a hit at our table.  Served it with buttermilk biscuits.
