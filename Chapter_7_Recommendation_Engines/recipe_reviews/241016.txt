This was delicious. I substituted walnuts for the almonds and massaged the dressing into the leaves. Super easy and really yummy!

Easy and yummy. I massaged the dressing into the kale to make it more tender.

I introduced my Italian MIL to kale with this salad. She really enjoyed it, as we all did.

Made it exactly per the recipe. This keeps in the refrigerator for a couple days. Enjoyed it with dinner the first evening and lunches for a few more days. I am Type II diabetic and my blood sugar levels improved from eating this! Thanks for sharing! Kale rocks!

This was really really good.  Had never had kale before but am trying to eat healthier and this seemed like a good recipe.   Added some chicken and avocado and it made a complete meal.

I didn't use almonds but add shredded carrots, cubed cucumbers and spinach.  Tastes great!
