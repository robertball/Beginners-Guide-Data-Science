These amounts are off. Three of each berry simply isn’t enough for 6 servings and there is way too much sugar on them. The mascarpone should be doubled but not the sugar in it, just double the amount of mascarpone. I didn’t care for the whipping cream in it, either. The peach tea is a fantastic twist, though. Great idea, miscalculated measurements.
