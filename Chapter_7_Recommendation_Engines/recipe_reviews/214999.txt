I spent the past several days test baking mini batches of gluten free scones trying to come up with a product I would be comfortable using to barter with a friend for Christmas gifts.  This recipe in combination with some techniques learned through other recipes proved the winning combination.  Thanks, Magdalinka!

I ended up using the proportions in this recipe, but I made a flour mix with roughly 1 part brown rice flour : 1 part almond flour : 1 part tapioca flour.
Also, after I cut in the butter, I put the dry ingredients and butter mixture into the freezer for ~10 minutes.  I then added the liquid mixture slowly while stirring.
I didn't use the ginger or lemon zest and this may be why the flavor is a bit bland at first, but it matures so nicely on the tongue and leaves you wanting more!
I did find the lemon to be an important and subtle flavoring.  It doesn't give them a lemony flavor, but adds depth and interest to the butteriness!

Tomorrow I plan to make them again and play around with adding currants, berries and white chocolate!

I'm grateful for this recipe and tried it eagerly. Ran into some issues. First, cutting 3/4 cup of butter into dry ingredients takes me WAY more than 10 minutes. Prep for this took me closer to 45-50 min. Also, once I was mixing everything together, the dough got really grainy. It fell apart and stuck to my fingers. A little extra flour helped a little. Rather than one round cut into wedges, I made 8 balls and pressed them, and then had enough left for a round that cut into 4 wedges. I ended up with 12 scones in the end. They bake pretty flat. They taste pretty good, though.

To die for!!! When you follow directions carefully, these are a great high fiber scone for us GF-ers! So flakey & scrumptious! I added less ginger (didn't have a whole cup). But awesome they were :))

I made some changes to the recipie due to what I had on hand. I had to sub the rice flour (because i didn't want to buy a whole pack and not use it) with whole wheat flour. I also had some goat milk that expired soon, so i used that as the milk. If you really love ginger (like me) put in about 1 1/2 cups and a little extra lemon juice to balance it. You must also flour everything when you are kneading it because it is SUPER sticky. Great recipie!!

Tips:- Instead of cutting/rubbing in butter, you can course grate it. Keep it in coldest part of fridge for a few hours. To bind rice flour add Xanthan....use cooks measure 1/2 teaspoon.Bbe very careful when measuring as even slightly too much xanthan can cause it to be sticky.

I've been making scones for years, so I used Celebrine's flour mixture: almond meal, tapioca and brown rice flour and added 1/4 t Xanthum gum as a binder. I also replaced the 1 c. milk with 1/2 c. greek yogurt + 2 T milk. Don't like huge scones so I made the dough into 11 - could easily have been 12. Delicious! Will definitely make these again!

Scones were very salty and bitter. I even used less salt than the recipe called for. Perhaps the 5 tsp of baking powder gave it the bitter taste?  Looking for a different recipe, this one did not work out for me.

Not sure about this recipe, the scones came out too dry and would barely hold together. I'm wondering if there needs to be more egg or some other binding agent in the recipe?  I liked the ginger lemon combination.
