I tell ya, my kids can be hard to please. Each has their own taste, but this was an absolute hit. I have a family of 5 and it was all gone, but 1 tiny bowl. I doubled the dumplings and put out soy sauce and teriyaki sauce to top it off.  Simple, easy, low cost and the family loved it. I'm going to add some things to this recipe, so check it out and let me know what you think.

Very authentic and true to the old recipe. Those of you who complain don't understand "authentic". Change it to your liking but quit harping, learn to cook and realize where the recipe originated. Bunch of dummies!

Overall this was a different and fairly tasty recipe. I sprinkled the cabbage with soy sauce while cooking and thought it was delicious, though would have been good with just salt too. The dumplings (which I doubled to have enough for the cabbage) were very heavy and bland. The dumplings need to be tiny. Next time I make the dumplings I will double the recipe, add 1 tsp of baking powder for some fluffiness and some salt for a little more flavor.

If using soy sauce, as other suggest, omit the salt for seasoning as it makes it too salty.  Yummy dish and so easy to make!  I was confused about when the dumplings were ready but it took about five minutes in boiling water.

We (me, hubby and kiddos) like this best with the butter omitted and using 4 slices of bacon as the fat then served over homemade egg noodles.

This was very easy to make and a very quick, tasty side dish.  My husband loved it so much there was none leftover!  I doubled the dumpling portion of it, which was perfect for us.  A little pepper and you're all set!  Nothing fancy here - but it would be good for a quick snack, too.

Can't say I'm a big fan of this one.  Just made it and it's.... missing something.  I added Hoisin sauce to the cabbage while it cooked.  The dumplings are terribly bland.  I don't know how to make this recipe better, but it's not great on its own, I gotta say.

I loved this but my kids didn't. I've got left overs for the rest of the week and I'm not upset about it one bit! This tasted great! I made the dumplings by using chicken broth instead of water like one reviewer recommended and kept everything else the same. I'm very happy with the way it turned out. I will be making this simple meal for myself for lunches often.

Made the recipe incorrectly as we got confused about the flour and water bit - only later did we realise the boiled water and the water to add to the dumplings were different. I boiled up some chicken stock - then just added the flour directly into the boiling water and wondered why we couldn't get a dough-like consistency doh! Anyway we were still able to make small balls and drop them into the boiling water to boil. Taste was as other reviewers reported, a bit bland, but this is good in that you can still add things - I added chinese sausage to the mix and it tasted good with it. Will also reduce the amount of butter added too, as it became greasy after a while. Reckon I'll make this again.

I thought this was great!   Very simple but so good.  I used store bought whole wheat gnocchi instead of making my own.  I am Polish and I grew up eating pierogi so my husband calls this dish the inside out pierogi since the cabbage is on the outside.  Cabbage and gnocchi put together do taste a lot like pierogi.  It really satisfied my need for Polish food.

I can't decide if I really like this.  There isn't a whole lot of flavor.  I don't think I'll be making it again.

I made this to go with my St. Patty's Day Corned Beef.  I cooked the dumplings in the juice of the corned beef that cooked in the crockpot all day.  Delish!

This is a quick and easy dish, perfect to use up a cabbage.  A little bland for our taste but we added some browned chicken apple sausage to the cabbage mixture and a little stone ground mustard at the end. Kilebasa or other sausage might work as well.

This was really good and easy. A nice side to make "something out of nothing" I was skeptical because the recipe didn't call for any eggs but it turned out really yummy. This is a great frugal recipe I will make again. I added some chicken bouillon granules and onion powder to the dumpling dough and poppy seeds to the cabbage mixture. This helped add a little more flavor and added to the appearance. I served this with Cheesy Acorn Squash also from this site. Thanks for a great find!

Simply good!  Because I was serving this as a side with a beef entree, I used beef broth to cook the dumplings instead of water.  Delicious!

This is good. I topped it with soy sauce like suggested because it's kind of a plain dish. But I like plain. Easy to make - be sure to make small balls of dough, I made mine big and ended up cutting them up in my bowl.

Ok, this took less than 15 minutes to make and was delicious! I followed the recipe except I used Adobo instead of salt. I think it would be delicious with the addition of sausage, I may do that next time. Thanks so much for a super easy, amazingly good recipe!

This is a very good recipe.  I used some bacon grease I had in the frig instead of butter (maybe about 1/4 cup). I took the suggestion of other reviews and used soy sauce.  I cooked some Italian sausage first and used the same pan to cook the cabbage. I also cooked the dumplings in water with chicken bouillons. My husband really like the dumplings.

I followed the recipe except for adding a splash of seasoned rice vinegar and some cracked black pepper. I enjoyed this dish and was suprised at how good the dumplings were. A little homemade sauerkraut mixed in, would give it a good flavor too. It's a keeper!

My family liked this next time i'll cut the butter in half since i couldn't get the whole head of cabbage in. I also tried subbing half a cup of the flour for whole wheat and i liked however my boyfriend didn't like those dumplings.  Definitely tastes better with soy sauce. Since I use unsalted butter and kosher salt i didn't have a problem with it being to salty.

Good, basic way to use cabbage.  I put a chicken bullion cube in with the dumplings and thought it was pretty great.

Amazing.  I needed to find a recipe to quickly use up half a bag of cole slaw mix.  I sauteed up the mix and a diced onion in about 1 T. of butter.  I wanted to use all the butter the recipe called for, but I figured I'd better not.  Instead, I added a bit of chicken broth at the end of the cooking so that the cabbage mixture wouldn't dry out.  The dumplings were so easy and made the dish substantial enough to be a full meal.  I can't believe something so simple could taste so good.  I'm so glad that I found this recipe.

I love this dish!  It will become one of my staples, for sure.  I was afraid it would be really bland, and I'm not a huge cabbage fan, but it really is just delicious as is!

I opted to skip the suggestion of adding soy sauce and instead added polish sausage.  They go so good together.  I think it would be unbelievably bland without the little kick that the sausage gave it.

I used 1/2 the butter and it came out fine.  It was good, but bland.  The next day when I reheated it, I added a dash of soy sauce and it was much better.

Super recipie! I did as someone suggested and boiled the dumplings (knoephla) in chicken broth, I also doubled the kneophla in the recipie.  I quartered the recipie and used 1/4 head of cabbage, along with the double batch of knoephla it was easily a side dish for 2. The recipie did not say how long to boil the knoephla, I made mine quite small and when I had them all in the broth I cooked them for an additional 8-10 min. 

Such a simple, quick, and delicious recipie!

My family did not care for this at all.  We found it to be quite bland and weren't fans of the texture.  Everyone left their servings almost untouched after the first taste.

I picked this recipe because I was so tired of looking of ways to simultaneously cook dumplings & cabbage while my roast was in the oven. This recipe was great! I used red cabbage and a red onion--I'd probably scale back and only use 3/4 of the red onion next time because it was a little tough on the tummy. Thanks for helping this bohunk save time cooking and a great and simple recipe!

I really had my doubts, it didn't sound to good but this turned out great. The entire family loved it. I added shredded carrots, chili powder and I used veggie broth for the dumplings instead of water. I made vegetarian (no chicken) chick'n nuggets to go along with it. It was a great dinner.

Cabbage was great but dumplings  needed some help. These create heavy dumplings. Lighter dumplings add more water.This is what I did: 
2 cups flour, 1 egg, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/3 cup water.  I boil with lid on 10 min then lid off ten. The last step seems backwards but that's how my Grandma made them and they we perfect every time.

I added carrots and red bell peppers to veggies.  Also some crumbled Jimmie Dean sausage.  Kids gobbled all of it!  I liked it the way it was but some felt the need to add teriyaki sauce.

Major yums! I used less butter--about half a stick, I just couldn't bring myself to use as much as called for--and since some had said that the dumplings were bland and hard, I made a batch of spaetzel from the allrecipes recipe, which is made with egg and milk instead of water, and added that instead. I also added a teaspoon or so of caraway seeds while cooking the onions.  Fantastic! Even my boyfriend who doesn't like cabbage had seconds.

I love this recipe.  Every New Year I try a different cabbage recipe and I'll stick with this one!  I cooked slowly so it wouldn't burn...and put Lawry's seasoning on cabbage and in dumplings.  Excellent!

SO MUCH BETTER THAN PLAIN CABBAGE! I loved it.  My son who will NOT eat plain cabbage said this was "eat-able." From  him, that's a big compliment.  And he did, he cleaned his plate! I will be making this a lot with the cabbage from our fall garden.

I've grown up on this dish. My Jewish Hungarian Grandmother called them "kludskás'. She added ¼ tsp white pepper and egg white to the dumplings to firm them up.  Other than that the recipe is identical.  People with a need for ketchup on everything will find this dish tasteless.

This was super good. I changed a few things. I cooked up a lb of ground beef and then added a cut up cabbage, 2 sweet onions and 2 tablespoons of butter. 
With the dumplings I made them with unbleached flour, almond milk, and parsley. After the cabbage and onions were cooked down I spooned the dumplings on top and put the lid on and steamed them for about 20 min. 
It was delicious

I'm Slovak, Polish and German, so I've been eating and making halushki for years. Our family has always used egg noodles, so I thought the change to homemade dumplings was fun. Still, I prefer egg noodles. I also like to put a lid on the cabbage pot. I think it helps cook the cabbage more quickly - and cabbage can take a long time to cook, so that's good! - and bring out its taste. We used a larger head of cabbage, so I added 2 onions, instead of one. I also used another stick of butter, for a recipe total of 1 cup. I salted the final product, as suggested, but think a dash or two of black pepper would've been good. I've also added some sage to halushki with good results and, though it's not traditional, freshly grated parmesan cheese.

Delicious! I did season the dumpling dough with salt and pepper and I used 2% milk in place of water. I made this dish twice in two days and  it was a hit with everyone.  I could eat this every day. Thanks for the recipe!

Cabbage can be pretty uninspiring but this was great!  I did it all in the crock pot and used orzo instead of dumplings.  Got lots and lots of raves and requests for the recipe.

Very good cabbage mixture and I added some cooked turkey that I needed to use up.  However, the dumplings were a bit of a challenge:  very thick, dense, and chewy.  I will make this again but will need to work on the dumplings.  Regardless, thanks for sharing your grandma's recipe; we enjoyed it.

My whole family loved this, including the 1 and 3 year old. I did make a couple changes, but nothing that would make me drop it a star. I halved the butter, because I just couldn't bring myself to use that much. For our family's taste, it was plenty. I also added a touch of thyme to the dumplings. We served this alongside some egg noodles and kielbasa. It was a hit!

Delicious!  I sauteed the cabbage and onions until golden brown adding a little salt at the end of the cooking time.  Doubled the dumpling recipe and added a tsp of baking powder and a little salt.  Boiled golf ball sized dumplings for 5 mins then lowered heat to low, covered and cooked another 5 mins before removing and adding to cabbage mixture.

The cabbage turned out great. I did put some soy sauce in while cooking. The dumplings were a little weird for me but still decent. In the future I will probably not make the dumplings but just make biscuits instead.

Just like my mom used to make! Soy sauce is not part of Czech cooking, though, as some used.

My family loves this recipe.  No leftovers.  We are Polish/Ukranian and this is a perfect recipe for our family.  Love it.
