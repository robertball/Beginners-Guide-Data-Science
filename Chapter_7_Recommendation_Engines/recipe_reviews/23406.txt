I made a fairly significant change to this recipe - by mistake.  The result was so wonderful you might want to make the same "mistake!"  I committed cardinal sin #1 when it comes to baking and didn't read through the recipe carefully before I began.  Since in most cases you'll make a cake with all ingredients at room temperature, I measured out the cream and set it out with the  eggs.  When I set out to make the recipe I noticed it directed that the cream was to be whipped before adding in the flour, and that wasn't about to happen with it at room temp!  But I wasn't about to start from the beginning either by re-chilling the cream. So... I took a chance and beat the eggs with the sugar for a few minutes to aerate the mixture, then added the dry ingredients alternately with the (unwhipped)cream. I baked it in the 8" layer cake pans as directed, but I wasn't comfortable with the baking temperature of 375 degrees, so I lowered it to the more traditional 350 and baked the layers about 23 minutes.  I watched it rise nicely and perfectly as it was baking and I was encouraged.  I turned the cake out from the pans and it was stilll perfect. Frosted it with "French Silk Frosting" (although a vanilla buttercream would have been nice too), cut myself a slice and was wowed.  The cake has an open and tender crumb, fluffy (almost dainty in its lightness!) and is very moist.  Because it's flavored with just a little vanilla it would be compatible with just about any frosting. Very pleased!

This is wonderful cake. I did not have any cake flour on hand so I used all purpose. ****Subtract 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour for every 1 cup of cake flour**** This cake turned out wonderful and moist! I made cupcakes with the recipe but next time I will use it as 2 8 in. round pans.

OMG, it's been a while since my family has given a perfect review to something I bake! I made it for mother's day, and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly and frosted with mocha cream(from this site). It came out fabulous! I made sure not to over beat the batter, and was a bit worried about its texture. It was a bit grainy when I poured in the cake moulds. DOn't worry, it comes out just perfect after baking! Light, fluffy, yet full of flavor. My mother even said it tasted similar to great pound cake. One reviewer said that it tastes like whipped cream? I agree! My brother who is usually very difficult to please, called me at home after I had left their house, to tell me that he had just had a piece, and loooooved it! He also said he would pay at least $40 for it! And he never calls me to tell me he likes something, so that must mean something!
Thanks for that great recipe, outstanding!

This was fantastic! I didn't have cake flour, so i used All Purpose and it was still delicious! I increased the servings to 12, and I baked the cake in two 9 inch pans. I made fresh whipped cream and layerd the cake with the whipped cream and strawberrys. What a hit! I had to make it twice in one weekend, and there isn't one piece left!

This is the most amazing from scratch cake I have ever tasted. I am glad I tried this one. I knew it was going to be good after I tasted the batter. I followed the recipe and direction, but I baked mine in a bundt cake pan. I topped this with Vanilla Glaze from this site and served it with a scoop of my homemade Lemon Poppyseed Ice Cream.

This cake recipe turned out so light and fluffy...almost like a sponge cake consistency.  I used all-purpose flour and deducted about 2 tablespoons worth.  The flavor was outstanding!  I made this in some mini bundt cake pans and into cupcakes and lightly dusted them with some powder sugar.  My hubby couldn't stop eating them!

Made this as a birthday cake and for the layer I added fresh strawberries and buttercream icing.  The cake turned out really fluffy and light.  It's an easy recipe with a great result.

I decided to make this recipe only because I had some extra cream in the fridge I need to use up, and I'm so glad I did because this is going into my collection. I was so impressed with the flavor and texture (very crumbly and light), for a recipe that is so simple I didn't quite expect it to taste so good. I made an icing with butter, icing sugar, heavy cream and vanilla that went wonderfully, but a word of caution the cake is very sweet so a dab of icing will do. Would go great with any fruit as well.

Update: Sorry I have to change my review and the # of stars. This was awsome as soon as it cooled, but after even 2 hours later it completely dried out, even after being wraped. I have never had a cake do that in such a short time, very strange. For that reason I will not be making it again.

Though the flavour and texture of this cake were wonderful, it became much too dry the day after I had baked it even though I had wrapped the layers in saran wrap, put them into an airtight container, and brushed them with a simple syrup.  In the future I will definitely lower the amount of flour and see if that helps.  Thanks for the recipe, but unfortunately, I'll have to keep looking for my perfect white cake.

At long last I have found my go to cake recipe. This cake is light and fluffy without being dry. My only complaint is the fact that I could very faintly taste the baking powder. I'll decrease it to 2 tsp next time.

I thought this was a very good cake.  Nice flavor and very easy to do.  I followed the review of naples and did not whip the cream first and I liked the way the cake turned out.

Really good flavor and texture, simple to make.  I also didn't whip the cream and it turned out wonderful.  A really homemade taste.

The cook at the mission where my daughter volunteers gave her a huge container of cream to bring home, saying he wouldn't be able to use it by the expiration date. I thought it would be quite nice if I could make something with it that she could then take back in and after a search came up with this recipe. Thanks to bizzymomma for mentioning in her review how to sub AP flour for cake flour. Just because I was more comfortable doing so I baked at 350 and this rose beautifully. I sandwiched it with raspberry jam and dusted with powdered sugar. The mission slices up all their cake donations and then put them out for people to help themselves. My daughter did manage to get out of one client that this was yummy cake. Thanks for the recipe Sal.

Go easy on the sugar i found it to be really sweet, because the whipping cream is already sweet enough. I made this into a bunt and made a glaze to go on top with powdered sugar a little milk and lemon lime juice. Delicious!

Loved it!  So light and fluffy.  I did make it into cupcakes but wasn't the greatest idea as it stuck to the cupcake liner.  It crumbled easily when I tried peeling off the liner.  I will stick to greasing and flouring the pan.  I'm sure this cake will go well with strawberry filling and frost it with some sturdy whipped cream frosting....mmmmm.

I took a look at other commenters' suggestions and dialed down the baking powder to 2 tsp. I also noted several comments about how quickly the cake dried out. I tried substituting part of the whipping cream (1/4 c) with some canola oil, so there was 2 1/4 cups of whipping cream instead of 2 1/2. It seems to have made a difference, but I may adjust it a bit further and add a slightly more oil next time I make this. The crumb is still a bit drier than I like.

That being said, this is a nice change from some of the eggy truck tires I've been making in yellow/golden cakes from scratch. Nice light taste and texture and it's a very easy and painless cake to prepare. 

I recommend you serve this the day you make it and not to let it stay in the pan any longer than 10 minutes or so while cooling. 

Keep an eye on the cooking time. In my oven, 20 minutes wasn't quite long enough but I think 25 minutes was just a smidge too long.  

I will be making it again -- I only gave it a 3-star rating because I modified the recipe a bit. (It drives me crazy whenever someone rates something 5 stars but it's based on the massive changes they made, not the recipe as it is on the site!)

This cake was delicious! I made it exactly as directed, and everyone loved it. Unfortunately, it was a little dry the second day so I'm going to try to tweak it a little and maybe add a little bit of oil and/or plain yogurt to keep it moist. I appreciate the recipe!

I saw this recipe and got so excited to try it . I love whipped cream and from some of the reviews, I just had to try it. I don't know where their taste buds are but what a let down! It was DRY and no flavor! I shredded the recipe that I printed so I would not make the mistake to make it again. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had whipped the cream and spread it on a rice cake.

I had high hopes for this cake but unfortunately have to give it three stars because it doesn't work well for cupcakes.  As others have mentioned in their reviews, this cake doesn't get high in the middle - it flattens out - and at least one person had theirs sink in the middle.  For my cupcakes, the batter rose above the edge of the pan, then sunk, leaving a flat ring of cupcake baked onto the pan around the edge of every cupcake.  That ring-around-the-edges of my cupcakes stuck to my expensive non-stick pan.  I tried everything to get the cupcakes out of the pan without ripping the tops off, but it didn't work.  (Note: I did use paper liners and the cupcake "stumps" weren't stuck, just the tops.  I also followed the recipe exactly, made sure not to overmix after adding the flour, and filled the cupcakes about 2/3 - 3/4 full of batter.)  On a good note, the batter was beautiful - light and fluffy - and the taste was pretty good.  It would work as a cake rather than cupcakes.  If you do try cupcakes, I'd recommend not filling the tins more than halfway.

It was a great cake, I cooked it for less time then it said, in two 9x9 square silicone pans and cooked for 15 minutes, they turned out perfect. I dont think I whipped the whipping cream enough before I added the egg, it wasnt as thick of a cake as I expected it to be, but still tasty and beautiful. I used the cream cheese frosting and whipping cream for the filling from the "Strawberries and cream cake" recipe. Good combo with the berries. The cake wasnt to overly sweet, and the frosting and cream was light and airy. I will be making this recipe again.

This cake was amazing!  I was impressed by how moist this cake was.  I made two 6" round cakes, and iced them w/ a buttercream frosting.  I will definately make this cake again - it was just as quick as making a box cake - but better!
I used a combination of almond, butter and vanilla extract in this cake...the flavour was reminiscient of sugar cookies/angel food cake...yummy!!!

Edited to say...I'm confused why someone took a picture of a boston cream pie and uploaded it as a pic of this recipe?!?!?!?!

This is a fantastic tasting, light cake. You can frost this with creamy chocolate frosting (from this site) as I did or you can fill it with fruit and frost it with a basic vanilla buttercream. Baked to perfection in my oven in 25 minutes. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great cake - big hit with the family.  I topped mine with hulled and halved strawberries (cut side down) and baked it in a 9x13 cake pan.  The strawberries sunk to the bottom leaving a pretty pink/red layer at the base.  Great with Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting.

I made this cake twice now and both times I had to lower the temperature and bake the cake longer to get the center to cook.  But the outsides of the cake got over cooked.  And the cakes also sank in the middle when they were cooling.

This turned out excellent.  Very very light and fluffy and tender.  I tried making cupcakes out of the batter.  They taste great but crumble a bit when you try to pull the cupcake liners off since they're so soft.  I also filled the lines a bit too full (the batter raises a lot in the oven) and had some spillage (nothing too serious, though.)  I will try a cake next time, though I don't have 2 8" pans.  I may also cut back on the sugar a bit since this turned out very sweet.  We didn't think it needed a frosting or any kind of topping since it was so sweet, but I would like to try it with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.

I absolutely adore the flavor.  Not too sweet and really does taste like whipped cream.  I was a bit disappointed with the size, however.  I baked these in two 8" cake pans, but came out with two 3/4" layers.  Next time I might try to use smaller pans since I like thicker cakes.  Definitely A+ for flavor though!

This is my first time to bake a layered cake, I don't know what to expect. I used a cream cheese whipped cream frosting to bind the two layers together. I think it looks great but it doesn't taste like what I have expected. 
The cake is a bit dry and burnt but I followed the recipe 100%. My husband and kids love the cake but I am a bit disappointed because I thought the cake would be moist.

This is the best cake ever! I tried 3 different test cakes before my son's first birthday. This was the winner by far. The batter is so yummy and the cake comes out so moist. Perfect! Thanks for the recipe. I used (from this site) Mom's Buttercream Frosting and Pasty Cream for a filling. It came out wonderful.

Wow! What else can I say! This was a delicious cake...moist,sweet,great texture. I made it with Cool Whipped Frosting and it will no doubt become my favorite white cake recipe. I have been looking for the perfect scratch cake to use in the Tiramisu Layer Cake on this site...and I think I've found it. Thanks so much!!

I'm something of an adventurous cook and don't follow recipes exactly. This recipe was no different, but I made many more changes than I normally would. It was the whipped cream use that brought me to this recipe, and the simplicity of it (against other whipped cream cakes on the site) that made me feel comfortable making changes, but the basic recipe is useable, so it gets four stars from me.
Alterations:
Since I only had a cup of heavy cream, I used low fat milk for the rest. Like others, I barely whipped up the cream/milk (but I'll make the effort the next time). 
I kept the temp at 350, but increased it to 375 about 3/4 through the baking time because I wanted to make sure the middle of the cake baked well.
I also added spices, since I like a cake with kick: cinnamon, fresh ground nutmeg, and roasted ginger. 
As for flour, I had whole wheat pastry flour, so that's what I used. 
I baked the batter in two 6" ramekins, and in 4 smaller ramekins as well. I only filled them about halfway (I prepped the ramekins w/canola oil & flour.) 
I also decreased the sugar by about a third because the amount seemed too much for my taste.
While these are a lot of changes, I share them because I wanted to make sure the cake didn't dry out, which is what I saw a few reviewers had said. 
The results were terrific. I made the cake on Sunday, put it under a cloche, froze the rest, and two days later, the cake on the stand is still moist and yummy. I expect when I remove others to defrost them t

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake was wonderful — light, fluffy, and very whipped cream flavored. I made a homemade whipped cream frosting and topped it with blackberries and raspberries. Perfect spring dessert.

Let me start out and say that this cake does taste GOOD!!! I made the mistake by making cupcakes a big NO NO!! This recipes definitely needs to be made into a layer cake....This was a super easy recipe to follow it produces a very tender soft crumb...It is Delicious! I made half cupcakes and what batter  I had left I made into a single layer ....

I misplaced my regular recipe for strawberry shortcake so I tried this one. When I find the old one, I'm throwing it out. This is a great cake Don't worry about "improving it" or changing it. It's perfect. My layers baked in 20 minutes. The whole family loved it.

I'm impressed with this cake. Its has a pound cake type of texture. The down side is I find it too sweet. I intend to try it again with less sugar. all in all I got a tasty buttery cake.

I made this recipe with a few modifications - 1. I followed naples34102 method 2. I have a dairy allergy so I substituted non-dairy cream (i believe it was sweetened cashew almond cream). This was the best white cake I have ever made and definitely the best cake I have had since realizing my allergy! It was very rich, airy, and moist. 

I was hesitant after reading the reviews about cakes drying out in less than 24 hrs but I have not had that issue and I have cooked 1-2 layer cake and a dozen cupcakes with a 1 layer round. I did over bake the cupcakes which made them very spongy and dry but that was completely my fault. I made it once with regular flour and deducted some as the other reviewers suggested and the second time I made it with cake / pastry flour with no noticeable difference in texture or dryness. 

This is now my standard go to cake. A great recipe with excellent and predictable results, even for dairy free bakers!

Wow, this recipe is amazing!  I used all purpose flour, subtracting 2 tbsp per cup, and a little extra baing powder, as other reviewers suggested. The result was moist, fluffy, delicious cake that I couldn't put down!  It almost seems a shame to frost it!

Even after greasing and flouring the pan, I could not get the cake out of the pans when it was done baking. I ended up with a pile of crumbs that were stuck together with frosting. It was very light, but I agree with another reviewer who said the taste of baking powder was a little too much.

Absolutely delicious and fluffy and met in my mouth! Tastes great plain even! I did frost some of it with slightly altered "Mocha Cream" though.

This is an amazingly smooth and light white cake.  Although I was hesitant to try it and thought I would waste my heavy cream, I am glad I went for it.  This is my new staple recipe for white cake... I just know that whoever tastes it will be dying to know what makes it so velvety smooth.

Yummy and so light, fluffy and flavorful! I made two layers and filled with sliced strawberries and pastry cream; frosted the outside with buttercream frosting and decorated with more strawberries. Excellent plain cake recipe!

I made this for my Dad's 76th birthday.  Let me just say that the flavour of this cake was amazing!  Not overly sweet and it was very moist.  Everybody who had it raved over how good it tasted.  I put fresh strawberries in the middle and frosted with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.  I also added blueberries on top, more for decoration.  Yummy.  One thing I would do different next time is to be more careful of how much I beat the mixture after adding in the dry ingredients.  The cake didn't rise as much as I anticipated, but I think this was because I mixed it too much.  I will definitely make this again!

This had a really good flavor. It was so moist that I couldn't have frosted it if I had wanted to. It just came apart when I touched it. The sweetness was just right for me. My kids loved it. Yum.

This is my standard white cake recipe from now on. It's fabulous, light and airy but rich and moist at the same time. It's perfect.

This cake is so wonderful.  I made it for my husband's birthday party and had many, many people say it was the best cake they had ever eaten. Very light and delicious.

This cake was ok.  It had a pretty good flavor but both of the layers fell in the middle - not too sure why this happened, but I may try this recipe again.  If it turns out better I will update.

LOVE the taste of this. Thinking of trying as a larger cake. Does anyone think this will double well?

I was looking for a recipe to help use up my whipping cream, and decided to try this one out. Wonderful, quick and easy cake to make. Paired it with Carol's mocha cream ( which uses whipping cream too ), and you have a delectable frosted cake. Thank you for posting.
