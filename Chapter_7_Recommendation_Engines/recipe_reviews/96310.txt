As written, the recipe is ok.  Make sure to keep an eye on your first batch and time it; mine were burnt at 4 minutes.  Also, there is a fine line between too doughy and burnt.  Once I got the timing down, I added about 1/8tsp garlic powder and substitued the oregano with italian seasoning.

Easy and wonderful.  I would just add more seasoning and cheese.  Also followed other reviewers on the change in time.

The ingredients alone are not enough.  I made a second batch adding garlic, salt, italian seasoning, doubled the cheese amount of romano and parmigiano-reggiano cheese.   Because of the additions I cannot offer greater than 3 stars.

I played with this recipe a bit to make it a bit better. I didn’t like the slight flavor of corn starch left on the wrappers. I dipped them in a bowl of cold water and pat dry on paper towels before baking. I also thought they needed just a touch of salt even though the Parmesan cheese is salty. I sprayed the cookie sheet with cooking spray and sprinkled some popcorn salt on the oil before setting down the washed wanton wrappers. I baked them at 400 degrees for 8 minutes and served with warm marina sauce. Thanks for this recipe!

Mine took the full 6 minutes, with a switcheroo right in the middle to get both sides even. I did sort of Asian style -- to go with Hot & Sour Soup -- so I just added sesame seeds. I'd add a little salt if not adding cheese if you were going for a flavor other than Italian. They're definitely tasty, just like you'd expect!

Interesting recipe, but not sure if the effort in making these is worth the results.

Easy to make, fun to change around.  We didn't use all the cheese, but doubled the herbs!  The first batch was eaten right away, so we had to make another batch to bring to our outing!  We will make these again!

WOW!!! I was looking for something that I could make to snack on that would be healthy and this fit the bill perfectly! I did change it up slightly to make them as healthy as possible. Instead of brushing them with egg whites I just sprayed them with non-stick cooking spray before sprinkling on my spices. Also, for variety, I did half with garlic powder and bbq seasoning and the other half with garlic powder, onion powder, italian seasoning, freshly cracked sea salt and pepper, a little parmesan cheese and parsley. I agree with the others that say 400 degrees for 4 minutes...they turned out perfect! I think these are my new favorite chips and I will be using this very, VERY often! Thanks for posting. :)

Modified this recipe is GREAT!!! Like a blank slate. I added and tried may diff types of herbs and diff flavors of cheese I had on hand. You can dip these in sour cream and salsa like nachos or even dip them in a cheese fondue! They are great to have on the side of tomato soup in place of crackers for added flavor!! Healthier then chips but can salt them up and they hit the spot when it comes to salt cravings .. really so many uses!!! As for the effort, what easier then brushing on egg, sprinkling them with anything you want and baking them for 5min? Great snack for a group of people!!!
