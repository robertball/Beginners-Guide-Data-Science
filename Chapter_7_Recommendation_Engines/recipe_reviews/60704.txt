OH MY is this ever good!  I didn't have sourdough bread (which is my favorite) so I used thick sliced  italian bread. I softened the butter and added the parmesan to it along with a bit of garlic and oregano (kinda like a garlic bread paste).  I actually made two of these they were so good. The second one with tomato in between sprinkled with a bit of salt and cracked black pepper.  These would be great with tomato soup!

This is surprisingly INCREDIBLE for how simple the ingredients.  The second time we made these we ended up mixing the parm with the butter (less messy) and adding some garlic powder. My husband WOLFED these down.  Perfect accompaniment to deli-style tomato soup.

Made my 1 yr old a regular grilled cheese for lunch and though...hey why not try this.  Anything with three cheeses and buttered bread fried up....has to be delicious.  Thank you for a new twist on an old favorite.

These are great sandwiches, but I must say that they're not the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had. Still, I made this 8 times over several days, using up almost a whole loaf of sourdough bread. I made it exactly as written; the "outside" step is a little messy, but kind of a neat idea, and works well - the outside becomes golden and slightly cheesy. I'm not sure I'd ever made a grilled cheese sandwich in a skillet before (though I think that's the usual way), but it works well. I enjoyed this recipe and highly recommend it.

this recipe is simple and easy.  i put cooked bacon in the middle of mine which gave it a little more flavoring.  next time i'm going to use mozzarella cheese instead of the american cheese.  i would recommend this recipe to anyone!

My kids loved this. I didn't have sourdough but I DID have homemade Mexican Sunset Bread which I used in exchange. My kids each ate TWO sandwiches. Anything to make for a quiet lunch earns all five stars.

Very tasty. An excellent way to make and serve grilled cheese sandwiches. I used a George Forman grill to do the sandwiches and they turned out beautiful.

Simple and delicious.  Adds just a hint more flavor to the traditional grilled cheese.  I used Kraft singles with shredded mild cheddar cheese and parmesan.  I thought the finished result would be chewier, but it turned out perfect.  Will definitely make again.

This sandwich was great.  I made it last night, using English muffin toasting bread.  The Paremsan I had was the shredded kind--not the powdery version which most everyone gets.  After buttering the bread, I sprinkled the shredded parmesan on and then gently pressed with a knife to get it to stick.  I cooked it in my George Forman grill.  The sandwich came out a nice golden brown and the cheese on the inside was perfectly melted.  I think it was the parmesan on the outside that gave it a little different taste.  Very good.  I will be making this again!  Great with tomato soup.

Very yummy and crunchy crust! I used American cheese and a marbled cheddar (because that's all I had), and it was amazing! Very creamy, too.

The more cheese the better. Be sure to use a quality cheddar and real shredded or sliced parmesan. I've made this on sourdough and french bread and it is always fantastic.

Ohhh, this was yummy.  I mixed the butter and parm together along with a sprinkling of garlic and onion powders.  I only used cheddar cheese and dipped my sandwich in spaghetti sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  This is the best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever had.  I was looking for something different than a plain ol' processed cheese sandwich and this was perfect..gooey cheese...yum.  I made some yummy tomato soup to go with and it was the perfect dinner for the chilly weather.

I really enjoyed this.  I usually only eat whole wheat bread, so eating the Italian bread was fun in itself.
I also melted the butter with a bit of garlic as someone suggested.  Next time think I will try it subbing the American for mozzarella.  Love it, thanks Nicolemicah!

OMG - Fantastic! I'll never eat plain grilled cheese again. I added a little garlic powder into the butter, used a slice of cheddar and had some shredded asiago cheese that I also added on top of the cheddar.  EXCELLENT!!!  Thanks for the recipe! I think it cooks best in a non-stick skillet.

Very good.  I too mixed the parm with softened butter.  It made a delicious crust on the bread.  Next time I will add a little garlic to the butter as well and maybe a tomato slice.  Good as is though.

How could this be anything but absolutely delicious?! I used Viennese bread which I toasted, topped with the cheeses, then broiled 'til brown and bubbly. Although I loved the combination of cheeses on their own, this would be great with onion, tomato, bacon etc etc. Thanks!

Yummylicious. This was really tasty and a wonderful change up from a plain grilled cheese. The parmesan added a nice flavor. This was really filling and I could only finish half. Thanks Nicole!

It was okay.  A friend gave me her recipe for grilled cheese and it is much better.  Use Sharp Cheddar and Muenster on Italian bread.  Yum!

Hmm, I don't know about this one. I followed the recipe, but made 3. I used butter with canola oil, and 3 Tblsp had the sandwiches sitting in tons of oil. Then, I was wondering how the parmesan cheese wasn't going to stick to the pan, and I was right! They parmesan cheese stuck to the pan and it tore the bread right up. It seemed like a lot of cheese, when the end result was a greasy regular tasting grilled cheese.

Grilled cheese deserves five stars just as a food item.  I guess I'm not quite sure why this one is any more surprising than any other considering the base ingredients are bread and cheese.  If you want to make this a five star standout, pair it with a five star soup, ie Barr's French Onion.

Great flavor! The three cheeses make this so flavorful--even my picky child ate it and loved it! At medium heat, I did smoke out my kitchen, dining room, and living room so I had to turn it just below medium. A good variation is adding ham and replacing the Parmesan with Swiss. Delicious!

This sandwich takes grilled cheese up quite a few notches. I used slices of Amish White Bread from this site and baked the buttered sandwiches in the oven at 400 degrees for 6-8 minutes per side just because I can get a more even browning that way. I didn't read the recipe closely and put the parmesan inside the sandwich rather than on the outside, but I intend to make my grilled cheese sandwiches this way again.

I followed the recipe with one exception, I added a nice layer of Limburger cheese, that added a nice flavor to the sandwich.

i have made this type of grilled chz before, they are great, i also mix the parm and butter together, not as messy, used sourdough bread, i added a heirloom tomatoe slice (did this in the summer) oh i added garlic powder to the pharm and butter, after the tomato i add 2 slices of turkey bacon, and this was a dinner sandwhich, so i fried an egg, broke the yolk and turned it over and cooked slightly on the 2nd side, so the yolk wasn't runny, or hard cooked, just perfect, i know it's a big sandwhich, but worth it when you and your family (hubby) are hungry oh la la

Been making grilled cheese sandwiches like this for years. I add a sprinkle of garlic powder to the Parmesan butter before spreading and spray the pan with a light coating of olive oil for a very nice crust.

Awesomely easy...and very easy to mix it up. Tried adding a little fresh garlic to the butter and put ham, tomato slice and fresh basil on the inside. Talk about yummy gourmet sandwiches!

I am really shocked to see this recipe online! This is how my uncle always made Grilled Cheese Sandwiches. He gave me the recipe about 15 years ago and this is how we’ve made Grilled Cheese ever since! We do make our own sourdough bread though and we use fresh Parmesan   Reggiano with fresh, “real” cheese slices in the middle. Tomato soup pairs great with this!

I made these grilled cheese sandwiches to go with Quick and Easy Chicken Noodle Soup.  They were amazing!  Made  them as per recipe stated. I loved the fact that the outside of the sandwich was not greasy from the butter. I will definitely make them again. They are high in calories though for anyone counting.

These are super yummy!  I did change the recipe a bit in that I used cheddar, Swiss & jack cheeses - no American.   I also put both slices of bread in the skillet at the same time and the slices of cheese on each piece of bread.  I cooked slowly, to allow the cheese to really melt & the bread to toast before putting them together.  The result is delicious,crusty bread with warm melted cheese inside.  The butter/Parmesan on the outside is brilliant! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the first time I added cheese on the outside of a grilled cheese sandwich.  It shall be my new standard.  Per other reviews, I mixed the Parmesan and butter first.  Per a food oriented television recipe, I used cheddar, muenster and Swiss inside.  Fit for company!

This is a great version of a grilled cheese sandwich (and possibly my new favorite)!  My only substitution was to use whole wheat bread in lieu of sourdough (to use what I had on hand).  The parmesan on the outside is a wonderful addition!  Thanks for sharing, NICOLEMICAH!

I really liked this a lot.  I didn't have sourdough bread so I used Italian sliced bread, but I think next time I will try the sourdough.  The Parm really gives it a nice flavor!

This was the best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever had!  I used focaccia bread from our local bakery, smoked gouda and white American cheese.  I mixed the butter and grated parmesan as suggested in other reviews. We had these sandwiches with spicy tomato soup and my family couldn't get enough.  I had to make more sandwiches for everyone. I will never make plain grilled cheese again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I thought these were great.  I sprayed the skillet with no stick spray and didn't have any problems with the parmesan sticking like some people did.

I just love this recipe. However, I make it with 1 slice pepperjack, 1 slice medium cheddar, and 1 slice swiss. This tastes great with the Garden Tomato Soup also featured on this site. These are the perfect comfort foods! I also wrap it in foil on a plate for a minute to get the cheese nice and gooey!
