Great tasting eggplant! I followed other reviewers suggestions and grilled each eggplant slice, then topped with fresh basil, goat cheese, and finally a tomato slice. I left them open faced and just closed the grill for a few minutes to melt the cheese. To serve I topped each with freshly ground black pepper and a parsley sprig. It was so simple and tasted fantastic. Next time I think I would brush the tomato slice with the olive oil/balsamic mixture, just because they kind of dried out on the grill. Thanks Carolyn for a keeper!

Loved this recipe- my husband usually will not eat goat cheese, and we had these 2 nights in a row! 

Added an extra step at the beginning - salting eggplant releases excess moisture and a bitter flavor from the vegetable. Slice the eggplant as normal, lay on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt. Let it sit for about 30 min, then rinse and pat dry. Then you can marinate as normal. 

Also, did not make sandwiches with it- that's too hard to grill! Grilled one side of the eggplant, flipped, and put on cheese and tomato. Never made the eggplant "sandwich." 

Next I'm going to try slicing the eggplant lengthwise, grilling as normal, and rolling and securing with a toothpick after they're off the grill to make eggplant rolls!

This is absolutely delicious! My husband and I both loved it.  The only changes I made was to salt the slices and let them sit on paper towels about 30 minutes then pat dry.  Then I marinated them in the olive oil & balsamic vinegar until I was ready to put the slices on the grill.  I grilled one side 7-8 minutes then flipped over and added the goat cheese and tomato slices and grilled another 7-8 minutes. Also, I served them open-faced instead of sandwich style.  Thanks so much for a really great recipe!

Very good recipe.  When flipping the eggplant try to pull the bundle off the grill and flip over a plate or tray.  The top eggplant isn't cooked or bonded with the cheese so when you try to flip it over the grill it may fall apart and make a mess on the grill or fall between the slots.

I gave it a five because it's easy to prepare, and I love goat cheese. My diet doesn't allow me to eat carbs, so this was perfect for me. Very tasty, wonderfull idea. TIP: If you can prepare them in a panini maker, it would be easier. Grill the eggplant separate first. Put them together at the end with the tomatoes also. Love it, love it, love it...

A delicious and impressive appetizer that beautifully complimented our grilled chicken dinner. Even my tomato-hating husband enjoyed this. If you love goat cheese, you will love this dish! The robust balsamic and mild, creamy goat cheese pair together quite nicely. Thanks for the fabulous recipe of an appetizer for the grill!

I left the tops off and added some fresh torn basil leaves underneath the cheese. Everyone loved it.

I ended up "marinating" the eggplant in the balsamic/oil mixture (I used 3 T. of each, along with salt, pepper and garlic salt) for about 30 minutes because I had to step away for a bit.  I was worried the balsamic vinegar would overwhelm the eggplant, but it was awesome.  Just the right flavor.

I made this on the stove and modified the recipe as follows:

1 medium eggplant, sliced 3/4"-1" thick;
3 T. balsamic vinegar;
3 T. olive oil;
generous dashes of salt, pepper and garlic salt;
1 c. mozzerella cheese;
1/4 small onion, diced;
1 c. medium cocktail shrimp, tails off, cut in half; and
dash of Italian seasoning.

Add eggplant, vinegar, oil, salt, pepper and garlic salt to gallon-sized plastic bag.  Mix around and let sit for 30 minutes to marinate.

Heat large pan on medium-high heat.  Spray with cooking spray and arrange all slices on pan.  Cook approximately three minutes (until the balsamic carmelizes on the eggplant), then flip the eggplant and cook the other side for three more minutes.

Heat a separate, small skillet on medium heat.  Spray with cooking spray and saute onions.  When the onion is nearly done, add shrimp and cook until opaque.  Add Italian seasoning.

Layer as follows on half of the eggplant slices (leaving the other half plain as those will be the top of the "sandwiches"):  2 T. mozzerella cheese, 2-3 T. shrimp mixture, and 2 T. mozzerella cheese.  Put the plain eggplant slices on top to create 4-5 sandwiches.  Continue cooking until cheese is melted.

Great recipe!! I marinated my eggplant in the balsamic vinegar and olive oil for about half hour. I chopped my tomatoes and sauteed them in a pan with fresh chopped garlic and fresh basil. I placed an even layer of tomatoes on each eggplant then topped it with fresh mozzarella and with another piece of eggplant. Baked in the oven for 20 minutes at 375. Everyone love it, thanks again for a great recipe!

Wow!! This was fantastic. Followed everyone's suggestions and added some basil leaves. I also had some spinach leaves on hand so I threw those in too. Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to try it on company...

This was amazing!  I brushed mine with olive oil, drizzled with balsamic vinegar, seasoned with garlic salt & pepper and let it marinate in the fridge for an hour.  I then brushed it with what was left on the bottom of the container and grilled.  When I pulled them off of the grill, I loaded them with feta, a slice of beefsteak tomatoe, drizzled again with the balsamic vinegar, and added fresh oregano on top to garnish.  People who didn't like geeplant LOVED this.

Very tasty.  I salted 30 minutes each side, then mariniated in balsamic vinegar (no oil) and basil for another 30 mins.  Spread in single layer in baking sheet, topped each slice with tomato, then baked for 375 for 10 mins.  Removed from oven, sprinkled crumbled feta on 1/2 the slices (some people eat cheese, some do not), and returned to oven for another 10-12 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Garnished with salt, pepper, and basil.  Served with warm Ciabatta bread.  Perfect for summer, easily adaptable for vegans.

I could not find goat cheese at my local market, so I substituted Mexican melting cheese with awesome results. Also I did not add the top slice of eggplant and bbqed the eggplant before adding the tomato and cheese. My vegetarian friends loved this recipe!

Excellent and easy!  Followed the recipe exactly but chose to make it in the oven.  I think this was the right thing to do since reviews of those on the grill said it dried out, had trouble turning, lost cheese, etc. I made it with fresh mozzarella since that is what I had on hand.  Would definitely make it with goat cheese, too.  The flavor of the balsamic vinegar makes this.

This was so good!  Very easy and a new favorite (We tried the sandwich style stacking, grilling the eggplant and then layering them with the tomato and goat cheese and then topping it off with another slice of eggplant).  Great flavor!

Great ingredients, but not together fixed this way.  It was eatable, but we were totally disappointed and too messy to cook and messy to eat.

I make something very similar to this dish.  The only difference is that I use roasted red peppers instead of tomato.  You can also bread and fry the eggplant. Either way.....it makes a great appetizer!

Probably would have been 5 stars if I had followed the recipe as written, but we didn't have any balsamic vinegar on hand. Really needed that extra kick to take it from very good to amazing. I substituted mozzarella for the goat cheese and added fresh basil.

Made with provolone because it was on hand. Brushed both sides with marinade prior to and during grilling. Added a little garlic salt and Italian seasoning to marinade & skipped salt & pepper. Was delighted to find such a tasty use for eggplant without being drowned in tomatoes.

Great recipe, but I completely forgot the balsamic vinegar. Still works without it! I don't have an outdoor grill, so I used my George Foreman...first grilling the slices of eggplant and tomato separately, then assembled the stacks in a shallow baking dish, drizzled it all with olive oil and chopped basil, then popped into 400 degree oven for 5 minutes to let it all melt. Great side dish.

I made this in my grillpan. I salted both sides of the eggplant and let it sit for about 10 minutes before grilling.  Turned out soo delicious! Made it with a side of spaghetti w/ marinara sauce.

Very good! Would make it again! I added a basil leaf to each stack and used tongs to flip them and had no problems.

I made these in the oven and they were really yummy - and really easy and I would eat them as a vegetarian main course as well as an elegant side dish.

What a great recipe for eggplant. I used swiss slices on some, cheddar on others - they came out great. Next time I'll try it with goat cheese or mozzarella

I did this on my George foreman grill, and I think it came out rather tasty. Added some basil and a sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano. My husband actually ate eggplant! That right there earns this recipe some stars.

I followed the recipe exactly and then turned it into a dip!!! I put them in the fridge till the next day in tupperware after following this recipe (i made them opened faced). Then I put all the open faced eggplant sandwiches into the food processor and then into a glass pie plate. I topped with three cheese shredded mexican blend cheese & warmed in the oven @ 350 till cheese melted. I then sliced kalamata olives on top and served it with sliced french bread rounds that I toasted in the oven (I offered feta cheese crumbles on the side)!! It was FANTASTIC!

I took another reviewer's advice and soaked the eggplant slices in olive oil, lemon juice, and minced garlic before assembing.  A tasty addition to lunch and a good way to use my first CSA eggplant and tomatoes.

Had this tonight and loved it! I had to use Monterey Jack cheese because it was all i had.Other than that i stayed true to the recipe. Next time i make this i will add some Oregano. Also i will remove the skin from the eggplant We found it to be kinda chewy. Still a really good dish! And its even gave me a few ideas. Thanks!

I've always loved the eggplant-goatcheese combo.  I use lemon juice and tsp of garlic powder instead of balsamic vinegar, and pine-nuts instead of tomatoes because I'm allergic to tomatoes (and the pine-nuts get roasted in the grilling process and taste wonderful with the eggplant & goat-cheese!).

Fantastic!!! I did open face and used herbed goat cheese.  Also, it is important to salt the eggplant and let it "sweat" for about 15 minutes on each side - lay the slices on a paper towel and sprinkle with salt, after 15 minutes, flip and do the same to the other side.

Yuuuuummie! Wonderful marriage of flavors.   
I used the "open" method.  I added some chopped fresh basil to the coating of the eggplant plus some black pepper on the goat's cheese before melting it.  My family really enjoyed it!

This was so-so.  A bit of a trick to do the flipping on the grill - taste was OK, but still something.  I will try again - cutting eggplant thicker, and not making sandwiches of it.

I really wasn't impressed by the recipe. I salted the eggplants first and assembled the sandwiches after the eggplant was grilled. I used the Foreman grill and found the sandwiches to be too soft and mushy. Perhaps using a real grill solves that problem?

Not just a delicious but also a very good looking dish! Can be served on any occasion and won't be a disappointment. I also tried baking it as well, but I think the grilled version came out a little better (as with everything grilled). I packed leftovers for my husband's lunch, and everyone around him was asking for the recipe!

Excellent!
I sliced the eggplant, brushed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, layered tomato and basil, seasoned with salt, pepper, and a small amount italian seasoning and either goat cheese or smoked mozzarella on top and then baked at 450 for 10-15 minutes on cookie sheet.

So easy.  I didn't add the 2nd piece of eggplant on top and added a piece of fresh basil, as others suggested.  All of this was home grown or from a local farm share....YUM!

I've made this a few times now but had to dial down the amount of balsamic and goat cheese in order to get the family to eat it.  All and all a nice way to present eggplant.

I think the key to this recipe is using the right eggplant. We bought some from the farmers market; picked that day. A great meatless meal that leaves you satisfied. Will definitely make again.

WOW!  Fantastic recipe.  I used Feta cheese on some and Brie on others.  I think with the spice combo I used I really liked the Feta cheese the best.

Sorry, my husband and I tried making this without the vinegar and tomatoes and leaving the top off but the taste was just not good to us.  Maybe we don't like goat cheese and/or eggplant?

Was AWESOME! Friends invited us over for Pizza on the grill so I thought this would go well with it.   I used my Panini Grill - they were a HIT!  Granted the Goat Cheese was expensive - it was well worth it!

These were really good! I soaked the eggplant for a couple of hours in the olive oil and balsamic and stuck it in the fridge which made the taste great. Be careful when grilling them- we tried to use foil so they wouldn't burn on our hot fire but some of them stuck to the grill. They still tasted good though!

we loved this!  my husband is not a vegetable eater, but he loves balsamic vinegar on things, so this was a real hit.  i baked the eggplant and i used shredded mozzarella in place of goat cheese since it was on hand.

Very little taste.  I'm disappointed because it took a while to make these and goat cheese isn't cheap.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.  I made these for my whole family, who have very adventerous palettes, and noone liked them.

Tried this recipe without the cheese (which I'm sure is the best part) and it was still wonderful.  We had this as a side dish to our meal and it was a huge hit.  I will definitely use the cheese next time!  Great recipe.

Good, but needs tweaking. They had sort of a tangy metallic taste.  I like the idea of making the grilled eggplant sandwiches, but might season the eggplant with dried Italian seasonings and olive oil instead of the vinegar next time.  Fresh basil added a lot of flavor.

This was a great idea. I don't like tomatoes so I used roasted red peppers instead and replaced the goat cheese with fresh mozzarella. I also added a piece of basil on top and it came out great.

Delicious.  As suggested in other reviews, I added some fresh basil, cut the eggplant the long way, and grilled the eggplant one side at a time.  Next time I will add spinach and put it in a wrap.

These were a hit at a recent dinner party. We substituted fresh mozzarella cheese for the goat cheese as it was half the price. I will make these again and again.

Very good.  I marinated the eggplant in balsamic vinegar, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning.  I don't have a grill so I baked the eggplant for about 15 minutes/side at 450F.  Then I added the tomatoes and cheese and broiled it on high for 3 minutes.

I used a reduced fat goat cheese that got kind of gritty on me. Not sure what happened. If you use a George Foreman, these are super fast. No flipping needed! I like this better as a side dish than an appetizer.

I did this in the toaster oven on broil and used cream cheese mixed with feta because I didn't have goat cheese.  I think I was able to achieve the same overall taste with those adaptations.  It had a good taste but nothing that popped.  Perhaps herbs mixed with the cheese would make it even better.

SENSATIONAL!  We used balsamic vinaigrette dressing & mozzarella & provolone instead of goat's cheese. Threw in fresh basil also! It was EASY & didn't fall apart. Looked like a gourmet veggie dish from a fancy restaurant.

Very rich appetizer, great with a glass of red wine. Very easy recipe to prepare. 

One may attempt to make a eggplant sandwich instead of what is suggested in the recipie. This makes it easier to grill.

I didn't have a tomato but I bet if I did they would be that much better.  I marinated the eggplant for apx 30min but that made them taste a little too vinegary.  Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly and serve on thick crusty bread (maybe rubbed with garlic?).

I did the oven bake rather than grill so maybe that’s why it wasn’t as flavorful as I expected. I think it may need a little more seasoning if I make it again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I just changed a couple of things to make it a little bit better. I substituted mozzarella for the goat cheese, and I also added a fresh basil leaf in between the cheese and the tomato. Made it super gourmet.

Left these open-faced and baked in toaster oven.  They were very tasty hot, but much better cold the next day as the flavours were stronger.  Used my own Greek dressing instead of balsamic and oil.   Also, mixed mozza and feta for them. Would be a wonderful appetizer if made ahead, baked, and chilled before serving

This recipe turned out horrible.  The eggplant was not cooked evenly.  I'll own execution.  Maybe a better BBQ specialist could make the ingredients sing.  But I will not be trying this one again.

I made this over a week ago, and made "extra" for lunch for work.  Once my wife finally tried one, I did not have any for lunch the next day, lol.  Cooking them was actually quick and easy, all the work is in the prep, and it is worth it.  Enjoy

Very good. I also added a slice of mozzarella to each stack and garnished with basil.

Loved it, no changes made.  I cooked mine in the oven and flipped after 15 minutes.  I cooked another 15 minutes and cooked till they were done to my taste.   I can see maybe adding some roasted red bell pepper and sautéed mushrooms to the filling.  Would also use different cheeses now and again just for variety.  Excellent as is though.

MMMM!  I didn't even know I liked goat cheese!  so creamy! I had a big fat eggplant, so I didn't put the top on.  I added a lil basil, some terragon vinegar, and used Rotel hot tomatoes with green chilis instead of plain ole tomato.  baked 20 min. in the oven. YUMYUMYUM!

Delicious, even if they were a bit messy.  I think next time we would make them open faced (so only 1/2 the eggplant per).

This is a great appetizer.  I don't have a grill, so I sautéed the eggplant for about 10 minutes and baked the sandwich in the oven for an additional 10 minutes.  It was very tasty, can't wait to try it on a grill!

Wow! Delicious, easy, and healthy. All of my favorite things! I made this as a side dish instead of an appetizer, and my whole family gobbled it up. Didn't need to use the toothpicks and everything held together with no problem. This would be a good vegetarian alternative if you're hosting a cookout. A couple of them could make a meal.

Good little appy. I liked it as is, although with a little basil sprinkled on would be a nice addition. My husband came home from work and stuck his between two pieces of rye bread for a sandwich! Good idea, I thought!

I made this with the lamb chops with balsamic reductin from this site.  This recipe worked well with the lamb chops and I also made yukon gold mashed potatoes.  The only problem I had to get past was the grilled tomato.  It takes a bit to get used to the consistency because I don't normally like fresh tomatoes cooked.  Otherwise very simple and tasty.

Make sure you buy tomatos that are the same diameter as your eggplant. Mine were too small and things got messy!

Also, the flovor wasn't as rich as I had expected, but think that was because I used a cheap goat cheese. (It was all the store had.) I'll try it again with a (hopefully) higher quality brand and see if the flavor improves.

This was pretty good but I changed a few things (I broiled it in the oven). First I sliced the eggplant and brushed each side with olive oil and sprinkled some dried basil on top. I then put them under the broiler about 7 minutes each side (watching them closly). I then topped each slice with a slice of tomato and put it back under the broiler for a few more minutes. I them topped it with the cheese and put it under the broiler for an additional couple of minutes. Very good.

We didn't care much for this dish.  It was too hot to go outside and fire up the grill, so I did them in the oven. I think the grill would have added a better flavor so I'll try it again on the grill before I decide for sure if I'll be keeping this recipe.

I'm sure I did something wrong when I was making this.  The eggplant was too hard and the vinegar was too strong.  If I try it again, I would use thinner slices of goat cheese and keep them on the grill longer.  The presentation was great though.

BIG hit - even with non-eggplant people.
