Really easy recipe and delicious. I baked the pumpkin layer for a few minutes first and cooled it a bit so that the layers would be more distinct.

Very very good, I also baked the pumkin layer for about 5-10 minutes to let it set slightly and it turned out great, both layers were very distinct and it looked wonderful and tasted better!

Delicious. The pumpkin helps the pecan pie set up nicely, so it's not runny. Simple to make. Highly recommended. No alterations needed.

Recipe should state that mixture requires a deep dish pie crust. What fit in the pan was great but I missed the extra pecan filling I had to discard. Rave reviews by family!

I had never baked a pie all by myself before i made this one. I did of course use frozen pie crusts ITS OK PEOPLE even top chefs swear by it. This pie came out wonderfully I actually found the recipe on verybestbaking.com but they wouldn't let me post a review, It wil be this thanksgiving desert from me. I tried it before it was completely cooled, bad on my part, every good cook must try their food before serving. Don't give your guests something that you wouldn't eat yourself. If this recipe doesn't come out right for you, then you must have done something wrong, probably could use a few more pecans, just because they are delicious, but its great as it is.

This was my first pumpkin/pecan pie and it was good, but could have been better.  There wasn't enough pumpkin taste and I doubled the pumpkin pie spice amount.  Next time I will use a great pumpkin pie recipe cut in half and mix it with a great pecan pie recipe cut in half.

This was SOOO GOOD!  I followed others comments and made in a deep dish, double to pie spice and added a few extra pecans just because I love them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good.  Add a lot more pumpkin pie spice if you want the pumpkin flavor to come through.  Also, this was much better after being in the fridge completely chilled.

I tried this pie out at Thanksgiving.  We all loved it!  I think I prefer it now to my old traditional pecan pie recipe.  Super easy and you dont really have to worry about it setting as much.

I love pecan pie, and pumpkin pie, but didn't like this pie.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The top layer never completely set.  Even after refrigerating the cooked pie overnight, the top layer was extremely runny and liquidy.  Also, the flavor combination didn't work for me.  You completely lose the pumpkin pie flavor.  I had high hopes for this recipe but unfortunately won't be making it again.  By the way - if you decide to try this recipe, be sure to use a deep-dish pie crust.  I did and even then the top layer nearly spilled over the sides.

It was good but layers are not distinct.  I am not sure that's possible for this type of pie as the pumpkin layer turns dark upon baking.

Taste delicious!!! I made them into cupcake sized tarts! I uploaded a picture too! So pretty and great tasting! It made 12 tarts. I used foil liners without the paper liners that came in them. I baked them 40 minutes!  They came out perfectly! Yummy!!!

Easy and delicious as is.  I tried it because I needed a dairy-free pumpkin pie. The amount of spice was perfect as far as I am concerned - I don't like to mask flavors with seasoning, just enhance them.  My entire family agreed that it better than both pumpkin and pecan pies.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made it before and we loved it. This time I made it and the pecan pie part did not set up. It sat up after 24 hrs. But not completely. I figured out what was wrong. I used a frozen pie crust that I thawed out , but did not get to room temperature. By doing this there was to much moisture and that why it was soupy. I laid out a frozen pie crust last night on the counter and overed it up. It thawed out all night. Then this morning I made the pie. It turned out perfect. This is a simple easy pie to make. And always a big hit.

This was very good and easy to make. I followed others advice and added more milk as 2/3 cup is definitely not enough. Also I baked the pumpkin layer 12 mins before adding the pecan pie layer. It still required 50 additional mins to sufficiently cook.

This recipe was so good! There was 1/4 slice left after Thanksgiving (with 3 other pie options available). I also cooked the pumpkin layer for about 10 minutes, let it cool and then added the pecan layer. I put closer to a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice in the pumpkin layer. And I added a little more pecans (maybe an add'l 1/4 cup). Super good pie, love love love it!
