I happened to have all the ingredients on hand, so I gave it a try.  The flavor profile is definitely unique, and I've never put raw sweet potatoes/yams in anything, but I actually liked it. It's not something that everyone will like, but if you are a more adventurous eater, give it a try. I think it tasted even better the next day because the flavors were more intense.
