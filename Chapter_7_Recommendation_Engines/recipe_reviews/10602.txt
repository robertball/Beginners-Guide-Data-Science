As my daughter and I were making these, she thought that they would look so plain - so we decided to reserve some of the chocolate/peanut butter mixture.  We put it in a ziploc bag.  Then we cut a small hole in the ziploc and drizzled the chocoalte/peanut butter mixture over the oatmeal layer.  Nice presentation!

What a great dessert! Took me only 15 minutes, start to finish. Very rich - a small bar goes a long way!  The second time I made these, I followed some others' advice and increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup (liked that change!), and decreased the butter to 1/2 cup.  I didn't like the change to the butter - made the top too crumbly.  I think next time I'll try 3/4 cup butter.  Thanks for the recipe!

I took the advice of the former reviews and used a little less butter.  I think that the longer you cook them in the pot the less greasy it will appear.  I substituted 1/2 a cup of ground flax seed for the oatmeal to give it a more nutty nutritious flavour and substituted the peanut butter with butterscotch chips as there is always a risk of peanut allergies when serving to the public.  Personally I would have preferred the peanut butter, but to be on the safe side. . .  Nice and simple!

Again, too much butter reduce by 1/4 cup.  Also I would reserve only 1/3 for topping.  Delicious though.  Five stars with the changes.  And I don't give out five stars too often.

This recipe was very good. I followed the recipe exactly, doubling it for a 9x13 pan, and found there was at least 1/2 cup too much butter. Once the crust was in the pan, I soaked two paper towels trying to get some of the moisture out, and drained butter out of the pan from the reserved topping. However, these bars were wonderful! My friends raved about them, and they disappeared right away.

These reminded my husband of a cookie his late mom used to make him. He was SO happy that we found a similar recipe. These are his new favorite :)

In order to keep the oats from falling off, I cooked them much longer than the recipe calls for and I added a bit of milk. When the oats were nice and soft, I pressed the first half into the pan firmly, then after I added the chocolate I lightly pressed the oatmeal that goes on top into the chocolate. I had very minimal crumbling. Great quick recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I made it with bittersweet chocolate and chunky peanut butter and it's absolutely delectable!  Perhaps it would be better to cook the oatmeal a little longer, at least to the maximum time it says, for better results.  However, now that I'm not allowed to bake, recipes like these are highly appreciated!

These are really delicious no-bake bars. I cut the butter to 3/4 cup and added about 1/8 cup of milk to the oats to make them less crumbly. It took me about 15 minutes before putting them in the fridge. I also reserved about 1/8 cup of the peanut butter/chocolate in a plastic bag and cut a hole to drizzle over the bars. I cut them pretty small because they are pretty rich. Yum.

These were sooo tasty.  And ridiculously easy to make - literally done in 10 minutes.  Everybody loved them.  After reading the reviews I made them with only 3/4c butter and they came out perfectly.

Instead of greasing the pan, I lined it with waxed paper.  When cooled, you can lift the dessert out of the pan and cut it into bars without damaging your pan.

Very good!  Actually won first prize at the Alaska State Fair in the 'Unbaked' division.  I made them once as written but the second time I added salt to the oatmeal to cut some of the sweetness and add the sweet/salty combo that I like so well.

I can't believe I'm the only one to dislike this recipe! It was bland, boring, and no one in my house would eat it. I like the idea of it, but the actual thing was disappointing. I cut back on the butter to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 milk to make up for the loss in liquid. It kept the oatmeal soft and stir-able. I guess I was expecting something more on the level of a Hello Dolly (aka 7 layer bar). I won't make it again. Also, even though it was "no bake", it still made plenty of mess on the stovetop and took 2 hours to cool down, so it wasn't any easier than oven bars.

These are some of the best bars I have made and I bake a lot. I did decrease the butter to 2/3 cup, and increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup and used a little more than a cup of chocolate chips. I used a mixture of Milk chocolate and semi-sweet chips. YUM!
I used an 8x8 pan and placed 1/2 the mixture in the bottom, topped with chocolate/pb filling and then genlty crumbled the other half of the mixture over the filling. Chill for a couple hours and these are great. I may add chopped Reese's cups to the topping next time for an extra PB flavor boost!

With the very high amount of butter and peanut butter for such a small recipe I almost didn't make these. So I thought up a modification: replace the butter with the peanut butter. I did 1/2 c peanut butter plus 1/4 c butter instead of the 1 c butter. Then I omitted the peanut butter filling part entirely. Just sprinkled the chocolate chips in, then added the top layer. It was great, and eliminated 3/4 butter (1440 calories total) from the recipe. I would use this recipe as an energy bar. I also read another reviewer who did part rice crispies, so I cooked up 1 1/2 c of oats instead of 3 c (and tossed in 1 T flax seed for good measure), then added 1 1/2 c rice crispies when I turned the heat off, then proceeded as normal. It was really good. Lighter, crunchier and even fewer calories.  It sets up much quicker in the freezer

Absolutely GREAT recipe - and suitable to take to a pot luck or bake sale.  Thank you to the person who stopped me from using the full cup of butter.  3/4 cup was perfect.  Someone mentioned 1/2... I'm certain you will have a very dry mixture if you do.  (and to the person who suggested an extra spoonful of peanut butter!)  Also, just for personal preference, I used half quick oats and half large flake.  I like more texture to my food made with oats.    They took 15 minutes to put together and about 60 minutes to set in the fridge.  It was the waiting part that was the hardest!

These were good & not overly sweet.  Made a double, 13x9 batch for a potluck.  I reduced the butter as recommended by others.  

Used  1 1/2c unsalted butter, 2c brown sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 6 c quick oats, 2c choc chips, & 1 1/2c PB.  I put 2/3 of the oat mixture on the bottom, only 1/3 on top.  Did not crumble much at all, think the secret is to cook the oat mix longer than 2-3 min, allowing the oats to soften more & stick together.  

Will make again as they were a huge hit at potluck, came home with empty pan.

Great, easy, flexible recipe.  Followed other reviewers' advice - for a double batch I cut the butter to 3/4 cup and cooked the oat/butter/sugar mixture for 5-10 minutes while stirring.  Turned out great!  I also subbed 1/2 cup oatmeal with 1/2 cup flax seed.  I think these would be wonderful with some toasted coconut mixed into the oatmeal too!  Thanks!

These are out of this world.  My husband keeps asking me to make more and more.  

The only complaint I have is that there's too much butter.  You can see small globs of it on top where it rises to the surface because there's so much!  I added extra oats the second time I made it (3.5 cups instead of 3 cups), and that seemed to help a lot.  So, I recommend either decreasing the butter or increasing the oats.

Additionally, if you use a 9x9 pan, your bars will be pretty thin.  At least, they'll be much thinner than most of the nice-looking bars in the photos.  It doesn't impact the taste at all, but it impacts the look of them.  If you're giving them as gifts, I'd recommend using a smaller pan to make the bars thicker.

32 servings in a 9x9 pan?  By my calculations, these are roughly 100 calories per bite.  There's a reason this is the first generation of kids expected to have a shorter life than their parents.

I doubled the recipe to use a 9x13 pan. Doubled, it called for 2 cups of butter, but reviewers said the butter was too much, so I used 1 1/2 cups. Once I got to the point of adding the oats, I did not see how the mixture was going to hold together firmly enough to get the bars out in one solid piece. So after cooking the oats a few minutes, I added Light Corn Syrup to the mixture. I didn't measure it, I just kept adding until it appeared to "stick" together better. I'd guess it was 1 to 2 tablespoons. I used 3/4 of the mixture on the bottom layer, and crumbled the rest over the top of the chocolate. I pressed the top layer down a bit. Popped it in the fridge for about 30 minutes while we ate dinner. Immediately cut them and removed from pan. I had no trouble at all with the bottom being crumbly, it held together nicely, so I think the Corn Syrup really helped with the problem that others had. Easy to make, and very tasty...addicting!

I changed it like others, but mine was even more different.  I doubled the recipe, and cut the butter to 1 stick, then added non-fat plain yogurt for a little protein and moisture.  The taste of the batter was amazing.  The yogurt gives it a soft texture and nice taste, not greasy at all.  It's a rich batter, but not heavy.  Nice stuff!

My husband loved these.  They taste basically like a fancy no bake cookie, much prettier than those piles.  Drizzled the top with melted chips for even nicer presentation.  Next time i'll line the pan with saran wrap to make cutting them and getting them out of the pan easier.

This is an incredible, awesome recipe! It is so simple and quick to make, but the taste is wonderful! I cut back the amount of butter to 3/4 cup after some of the reviewers complained of extra greasy bars. This worked great...they weren't greasy at all, but still held together nicely. I also added the vanilla after I removed the pan from the heat, so it wouldn't lose it's taste. Other than that, I made these as written, and everyone loved them! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...I'll definitely be making these again!

Make sure you let these chill for at least 3 hours - I was impatient and ate one early, it didn't taste anywhere as good as when it was chilled properly.

Excellent!
as others I cut back butter to 3/4 c.  I also doubled up the peanut butter/ chocolate mix.  They were very rich but oh so good. I would make again as they were simple and quick and very yummy

I've made these twice; once as stated (other than decreasing the butter), and once with a few changes. The first time, they were good, but not amazing. The second time, I decreased the butter to 1/2 cup (same as the first time) and used old fashioned thick rolled oats. I was out of chocolate chips, so used butterscotch chips instead -- and WOW!!! What a great substitution. I think I will use butterscotch chips exclusively with this recipe from now on, they were THAT GOOD. And a total hit with the kids and husband!

This is a fantastic recipe without modifications! I've made a double batch twice in the past month, and both times they have disappeared very quickly. In some other no-bake oatmeal bars I've tried, the oats seem too hard, almost painful to chew; not so with this recipe, when prepared as instructed. The oats cook just enough to take the edge off but not get mushy. I simply doubled all the ingredients and used a jelly roll pan lined with that stuff that's parchment paper on one side and foil on the other, foil side down. After letting them sit in the fridge overnight, I pulled the whole slab out of the pan using the liner and let them sit for about 10 minutes to soften slightly. Then I used a pizza cutter to cut them into bars. Storing them in the fridge is a must, IMO; they get a little too soft and the butter starts to "leak" out of them at room temperature. I layered mine with waxed paper in a square plastic container and they kept quite well in the refrigerator. They make a nice snack and even a nice power breakfast treat if you're in a hurry. I will make these again and again; they would probably make great holiday gifts.

Delicious. I doubled the recipe and added the mixture to a 9x13 baking dish, reduced the amount of butter, and saved some of the peanut butter mixture to drizzle on the top of the finished product. Nice presentation.

Made these today.  Oh-my-gosh..... sooooo good!! I used milk choc chips ~ and a bit more than a cup of them (had an open bag in the pantry).  Kept in the fridge then took them out to cut, and put them back.  They were easy to get out and did not crumble at all. Had one after supper and then about 8:30 the hubs wanted another!  So easy, and so fast!!!! Definitely try these!!

I can't believe this recipe has a 4 1/2 star rating.  It's terrible.  Way too greasy and bland too.  I was looking for a recipe similar to this that I love, and this wasn't it.... I'll keep searching for my beloved "Oat Fudgies", and try to figure out what to do with these Oat Bars that no one wants - hopefully, I'll be able to recycle them into some other sort of cookie as suggested by other reviewers.  Be kind to your arteries - don't make this!

The only downfall to this recipe is the amount of fat so like many other reviewers, I made some alterations.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I also used all natural reduced fat peanut butter for the center mixture.  If you're looking for a little more flavor add some coconut to the oatmeal mixture. This recipe was easy to make and turned out to be pretty darn good!

As long as you reduce the butter by about 1/3rd you're good. I was told by my guy these were his new favorite food.

I followed the advice of others and made some changes so I am only giving this 4 stars, but with the changes I made they are definitely 5 stars or better.  I doubled the recipe and made in a 9x13 pan.  I used 1 1/2 cups of butter instead of 2 cups. I think the bars would be very greasy with the full amount of butter.  I also used 3 large Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bars instead of the chocolate chips. I made a sling out of parchment paper and lifted the bar out whole and cut it on a cutting board so it was very easy to cut the bars evenly. I cut them into very small bars since they are so rich.  I made them for a reception at church and they were the cookie that everyone was talking about.  At least 6 people asked for the recipe and one man who only knows how to microwave frozen dinners asked for the recipe so he could have his granddaughter make these bars for him. I will definitely be making these again.

You HAVE to reduce the butter in these. I made them just as the recipe said and the butter SETTLED on top because there was way too much. Otherwise I think it would be very good.

Fantastic and quick. I really like these. I made the filling with 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate and the other half 60% bittersweet and then the peanut butter. I also added a teaspoon of brewed coffee to the filling, coffee compliments the chocolate.

These bars were so easy and very good.  They are wonderful on a hot summer day when you don't want to fire up the oven.  My whole family loved them.  I lined my pan with foil so they were easy to lift out and cut.

These were really good. I would agree with the comments to cut back a bit on the butter, but they still tasted awesome! I was out of peanut butter, so I just sprinkled choc chips on the warm oat mixture and spread them as they melted. MMMMMMMMM.......

Definitely reduce the butter! However, these were scrumptious, and very popular, even with the excess grease.

Great recipe.  I made a few changes.  Only used 1/2 cup of butter and 2 1/2 cups of regular oatmeal.  I also added about 1/4 - 1/3 cup peanut butter to my crust mixture.  I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet and added a little more peanutbutter to my chocolate mix.  I basically just adjusted the amount of peanutbutter to my liking.  I did not reserve any of the oatmeal mixture for the top, I just had a layer of oatmeal crust and a layer of chocolate/p.nut butter mixture.

Easy recipe. Everyone loved them. My suggestion is to use unsalted butter. It's too salty with regular butter. I lined the pan with parchment paper which made it super easy to remove and cut. I will make these again and again!

I found these to be a little on the dry side. They were okay but not my favorite. I like the chocolate peanut-butter chocolate but not the topping/crust.

I had to edit this review. I'd give it no stars if it were an option. My original review of 3 stars was based on a small taste I had & the fact that these cookies *looked* good. After letting them set for a day....it's beyond me how this recipe has so many stars. After attempting to taste test a whole cookie, before serving these at a family dinner, I decided to trash the whole batch and kiss $10 worth of ingredients good bye. (I doubled the recipe.) The fat & calorie content really bothered me.....but these cookies really didn't taste that good. Chewy & VERY buttery, but with out any real flavor. Which is beyond me, given all the chocolate & peanut butter. All I tasted was butter. I did take one bar to dinner so my family could test these. The comments ranged from "no flavor" to "too much butter" to just plain "nasty".
I'm all for a rich dessert every now and then, but this recipe is totally not worth the calories or the $ you'll spend on ingredients.  
My first review is below:

Heart attack in a cookie.....These are good but I doubt I'll make them again, simply because of the outrageous fat & calorie content. When I want a cookie, I want a COOKIE, not two bites with hundreds of calories. The picture looks good....and I had decided to make these for a family get together before I took a close look at the recipe. Easy to make, but way way to rich for my taste.

Super easy and good bars! The only thing that I did different was use regular oats, as that was all that I had, and add more peanut butter per other suggestions. I froze the bars for a few hours and then cut into small squares- can't wait to get the feedback on these tasty treats!

I think this recipe has potential but needs some tweaking.  1 C of butter is just way too much, result was greasy oatmeal.  Will try again with more brown sugar, less butter and bringing to a boil before adding vanilla and oats.  Microwave works great for melting chips and peanut butter together.

These were so good. I need something to make up for the bad cookies I made the other night.  These certainly did the trick. Per other's reviews I decreased the butter to 3/4 cup.  I also used a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  This is a very fast easy dessert to make, I was able to whip this up and have in the freezer before having to be at the soccer fields by 8:30 am.  Definitly a keeper. Thanks!

This recipe prompted me to create a profile to write a review. I was really dissapointed. First, there isn't enough of the oat mixture to completely cover the top and bottom. Second, the mixture is heavy and greasy. I followed the recipe to the letter. I dont understand why it was so bad. My ingredients are fresh... I know how to work the measuring cups... What can it be? No one can argue that chocolate and peanut butter taste great together and we all want quick and easy treats from time to time (ok - almost always) but something is wrong here. I threw the bars out after trying them.

These taste wonderful-however, I think the serving size should be a 1 inch by 1 inch square, as these are incredibly rich and it doesn't hit you for a little while just how rich they are.

These are quite good. I used 3/4 C peanut butter, and that balanced the chocolate perfectly. I think next time I won't add so many oats: 3 Cs seems like a lot and I didn't end up using them all. I'll scale it back to 2 1/2 Cs or else up the butter to 1 and 1/2 sticks. Yum! We really enjoyed this. (The picture sold me on making this.) :)

These came out wonderfully delicious. I replaced the chocolate chips with dark chocolate Kisses leftover from Easter, drizzled chocolate over top and sprinkled that with a handful of coconut flakes.  Very easy, very yummy. Great for work "snack days" and for kids.

FANTASTIC! Quicky, easy, and so addictive. Put peanut butter and choc chips in a glass bowl in microwave for about 30 seconds, stirred it all up, poured it in. Used only 1/2 c margarine, and as other reviewers stated, the crust is a bit too crumbly, so I might increase it next time. Also used 3/4 c peanut butter (for me, more is ALWAYS more when it comes to PB :). Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for cutting back slightly on the butter as others recommended. Not sure if that made the difference, but my bars turned out way too crumbly on top. Maybe it would have been better to use much less than 1/2 of the oatmeal mixture for the topping?? I will try again with the full butter amount to see if it makes a difference (and then will re-rate) but for now, can only give 3 stars as the oatmeal mixture was just too much and too crumbly on top.

We liked these ok, but they weren't a favorite. I followed the recipe exactly, but I thought the middle filling was too thick; it needed more crust, less filling. I probably wouldn't make again, since there are other bars we like better.

I doubled for a 9x13 then reduced butter to 2.5 sticks and added milk (maybe a cup or a little less??).  I reduced sugar by maybe a 1/4 cup but I think it could've used a bit more.  I added flax, wheat germ and wheat bran to the oatmeal base as well as used primarily rolled oats.  The oat part turned out fine.  I reduced chocolate chips some and used natural peanut better and probably too much of that (didn't measure - maybe 1-3/4 or more?).  The center was bland and could've used more chocolate.

Kudos on the super easy, super yummy recipe. I give it four stars as opposed to five because there is just too much butter in it, I am excited to try again with less. Also, add-ins are perfect for this one because it is so simple.  The bottom came out a little weak with just the oats and more than half crumbled off. A more crumby bottom would be a great touch, perhaps graham cracker crumbs.

Absolutely delicious! I made these with equal amounts of peanut butter and chocolate which I highly recommend for the peanut butter lovers out there. I also decreased the butter in the crust, which I do NOT recommend--next time I will use the full amount because the crust was too crumbly. I took another reviewer's suggestion and drizzled some  of the choc/pb mixture over the top and they look just as good as they taste! :)

I realize that I am the definate minority here, but these just didn't do it for me.  I followed the directions exactly.  Like many other reviews have stated, the butter was way too much.  I  would probably decrease the peanut butter as well.  Just a matter of taste.

I liked the idea of the layering and the chocolate/peanut butter mix. Cutting them at refrigerated temperature was fine. However, when serving, the oat part crumbled badly, after only being out for a few minutes: making for poor presentation and was very messy to pick up and eat. Sorry, the flavor is "addictively" delicious, but the recipe needs tweaking.

Pretty good and dead easy, but I'm confused by the rave reviews.  I would not serve these to guests or as christmas cookies, but are good to have in the fridge for a chocolate craving.  They were pretty plain and the oat mixture was sticky and got all over your hands.

I made this for a family gathering and took most of it back home with me.  They were way too crumbly - would not hold together at all. The taste was just OK. Next time I will probably stick to revel bars, which is what I usually take with chocolate and oatmeal and have much better luck with.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before making these.  they were greasy and bland!  I ended up scraping them out of the pan, adding enough flour and another 1/4 c oats to hold them together and a bit of baking soda.  I then rolled them into balls.  The kids liked them this way, but I baked some of them, too, for about 10 minutes.  Even without an egg added (I may do so if I make them again), they held together well and had a nice taste. The recipe as written is not worth making!

Super duper yummy !  I added a layer of shredded coconut to the inner chocolate layer & to the very top.  I also topped by lightly pressing in chopped walnuts.  I recommend cooling overnight as cutting them while they are anything other than solid lends to the bars falling apart.  Unfortunately, much of the oatmeal I used as left in the pan or plate because they tended to crumple apart - but they tasted SOOOO great that it really didn't matter.

Very tasty and easy. I followed previous reviewers advice and cut the butter to 3/4 and 1/4 milk.... was still quite greasy.... I think I'd cut the butter to 1/2 butter and 1/2 milk next time.  Definitely worth trying though!

I made these for my students to snack on during their final exam review session.   They disappeared quickly and many students asked for the recipe, so I'd say it was a success!  It's an extremely rich recipe, so the serving sizes could be smaller.

These are so good! I followed the recipe very closely -- the only thing I changed was using 2/3 of the oat mixture on the bottom and 1/3 on the top instead of half-half. I used the full amount of butter and didn't find the bars "greasy". I love how quick and easy these are to make, how the recipe doesn't require an electric mixer, and how most people would have the ingredients in their kitchen already. I also loved the hint of peanut butter. These bars would be great to make for a bake sale (but be careful of the peanuts). I'll definitely make these again.

Used 3/4 cup grass fed butter and 3/4 cup peanut butter as recommended. These are so easy to make and delicious and gluten free.

I did the recipe exactly how it is listed and didn't listen to the other reviews...mistake. WAY too much butter. I should have listened! I would cut the butter in half at least. As it was, there was a lot of butter sitting in the pan after scooping the oatmeal out. Will try again with modifications though.

These were awesome and a keeper for summer when I don't want to heat up the house.  Did follow others advice when making a double batch and only used 1 1/2 cups of butter.  It was great, no problems with crumbling either.  They are good right out of the fridge or at room temperature.  Thanks for the recipe!

These got rave reviews from my family and from me.  I took the advice of others and decreased the butter by 1/4 cup and increased the peanut butter by 1/4 cup.  Also used a mix of quick and regular oats and cooked the oat mixture a few minutes longer than called for.  The suggestion to line the pan with foil worked out beautifully - just lift and cut.  Thanks for the recipe and for the helpful reviews!

Absolutely delicious and addicting! I used 3/4 butter and made these in less than 20 min! Took them to a Super Bowl party and got rave reviews!! Oats, peanut butter and chocolate is always a winning combination! :)

Wow! My family loved these! I tried to get away with using less butter, but it made the oat mix more crumbly, so I suggest using the full cup of butter.

These were VERY good and VERY easy. However, I thought the taste fell a little flat so next time I will add a little salt to the oatmeal mixture.

So yummy! When I tasted the chocolate/peanut butter mix when it was just melted, it tasted kind of strange... but after it has cooled in the fridge overnight, it was absolutely fabulous! We used 60% dark chocolate chips instead and it definitely can go darker if you are a dark chocolate fan. Also, I used a 8x8 pan as that is the only square pan I have. All turned out really well. Although, I suspect the butter can be reduced by a bit if you want it a little healthier... Overall an excellent and indulgent recipe and made for a great snack on our road trip! Thanks for sharing!

Very easy and a great way to satisfy my chocolate cravings without heating up my house in the middle of the summer. I did cut the amount of butter by 1/4th and increased the peanut butter.

Using a whole cup of butter makes these way too soft and salty.  Mykids took one bite and spit them out, I don't blame them.  I'll stick to my regular no bake cookies.   What a waste of ingredients.

These were so easy to make, and turned out great.  Make sure you let the oats cook long enough or they will be chewy.  I had a bar with some vanilla ice cream, and it was a great balance.

LOVE these! So easy and quick to make.  My three adjustments were minor -- I put 2/3 of the oats in bottom of pan, and 1/3 on top instead of 1/2 and 1/2; I used an oblong pan and it worked fine; and finally, I sprinkled some Skor bits on top for a lovely extra toffee crunch, yum!

Very good. I did only use 3/4 cup butter. And also substituted flax seed and frosted flakes for 1 cup of oatmeal.  And then spread a 1/3 chocolate chips over bottom layer before adding melted mix.

Easy to make. It taste kinda like nutter butter. For peanut lovers...these are for you. I had used crunchy peanut butter and added pecans for more of a crunch but before pouring the chocolate/peanut mixture, I had spread a thin layer of caramel first (caramel in a jar).

These are fast to make and great for the summer because they are no bake. I did use 3/4 cup of peanut butter as suggested by others. Used a 9x9 pan but felt I did not have enough oat mixture for the bottom and top so I will probably make 1 1/2 of the oat mixture next time. If you like chocolate and peanut butter you will enjoy these, very sweet. Wish I had tried these at the beginning of the summer, was 64 in the house this morning so I turned the oven on and made some cookies to warm up the house.

Very good and definitely worth making again!  For a bar with peanut butter and chocolate, I would head right over to Peanut Butter Bars I from this site, though.  They are tough to beat!

Well, it was too buttery.  Not to big with flavor, but was for sure much better when eaten with icecream.  It will be a while before I make this again.

These were just OK.  I agree with other reviewers that they are sort of greasy and hard to handle.  I will definitley be making the PB/choc chip sauce again however - possibly as an ice cream topping?  That part was yum!

I made this to share with my gluten-free friend on a trip. I picked the recipe because it was for wheat free cookies without weird flours. Everyone who tried them (even the wheat eaters) loved these cookies! The fact that they are no-bake is a bonus!

I really liked this. It's so easy! I actually used half semi-sweet and half unsweetened (just what I had on hand) and coupled with my natural peanut butter and everything I figure this was probably a pretty healthy sweet!

Lovely! I used the same as the recipe, then added an additional 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips to the chocolate. I used natural peanut butter to make it heartier and I added 1/2 cup of toasted, chopped mixed nuts. Served with ice cream at a party and I was a very popular hostess.

We loved these! My kids and I devoured them and I brought a second tray-ful to a work party where everyone enjoyed them. I do find them just slightly "buttery" on the bottoms, but not too bad. The oats cooked fine and soft for me, and the flavor and texture of the 'fudge' in the middle is terrific!

Rich and delicious treat.  One of the kids said it reminded them of chocolate no-bake drop cookies and I agree, but these are even richer because of the chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder.  Also, I used regular rolled oats, not quick-cooking.

I made these today. I expected them to taste rich and delicious because I love the combination of peanutbutter and chocolate. They were just ok. Also the recipe called for 1 cup of butter I found that too be too much. When I put the first layer of oatmeal/butter/brown sugar into the pan to flatten out, I noticed that it was extremely greasy. It called for a grease pan. I was better off leaving the pan ungreased. I had to keep taking paper towels and blotted off the butter. If I ever bake these again, next time I'll use a lot less butter and a little more sugar.

I cut the butter by half, but added 1/4 cup APPLESAUCE to oat mixture (figured it needed a liquidy replacement). It was the perfect texture and held together fine without greasiness. Tastes like a layered no-bake. I liked the texture of old-fashioned oats in this. Also I think BOILING the sugar/ butter mixture ensures the best "stickability" of the oats. DRIZZLING a bit of chocolate mixture atop was a great idea, Mary G!

I remember making this exact recipe when i was in high school having sleep overs. My friends mom wouldn't let us cook so we figured out how to do these in the microwave. They come out perfectly. Thanks for the recipe! It was nice to try them again!

I'm not sure what happened with these, but I didn't care for this recipe! Even though I reduced the butter to 3/4c, they still tasted greasy. The chocolate/p.butter layer was not flavorful enough and the oats were chewy (in a bad way!). Even my daughter who devours all things chocolate, couldn't finish one of these...I will not be making this again!

These were just OK.  I thought the oats were greasy and a bunch fell off while cutting. Our kids liked them...and I liked the ease in making them.
Not sure if I'd make them again.

I was looking for something quick and easy to throw together for a cookie contest at work when I saw this recipe.  It took only a few minutes to assemble everything and make a batch.  I couldn't believe how simple it was. The best part - I won best overall cookie! And odds are you already have all these ingredients on hand. It's no-fail!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I am obsessed with these bars. I don´t have an oven right now, and my husband has lost about 10 pounds in three months, so I am trying to make delicious high calorie food.  These bars were a huge hit with him, and I have already made two batches.  I think that for my two years in Peru this will be a staple.  Just be sure to use enough butter or the oats layer won´t stick properly.  Thanks for this recipe!

The base definately needs something to hold it together a bit more - I think next time I will add a tsp of flour while the oats are cooking.  I also used mint chocolate chips and crunchy peanut butter.  Yummy.

Not bad, but not great. Much too rich. Kept in the fridge they were nice and firm. But not exciting enough to eat more than one.

Pretty good!  I reduced butter to 3/4 cup, as recommended.  Didn't actually measure the peanut butter therefore may not have put enough in (needs more).  May try crunchy peanut butter next time. Tasty stuff.

I also cut the butter back to 3/4 of a cup and added 1/4 cup of milk and cooked the oats a few minutes  longer.I took these to a picnic and they were gone in fifteen minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly, and myself along with my company loved them.  They were delicious, and I read the reviews where some cut the amount of butter, and I could see why, but I wouldn't change a thing, they were a huge hit!!!

Overall, I liked the No Bake Chocolate Oat Bars.  No question that they are super easy to make...th challenge I ran into is that my husband did not like them.  Normally, any dessert that I make (typically cookies), is gone within a day or so...not with this one.  

I would consider making them again for a get together...or just to take to work.

i'm not a cookie person, but i decided to make these to take to a baby shower. i used a spring-form pan which made it easier to cut them without too much crumbling. i followed the recipe exactly -until the end. i had some extra white chocolate laying around so i melted that and drizzled it on top. and i cut them while they were cold. the only problem was that a few hours before the shower i realized that half the pan was gone (i'm going to blame my husband...). i didn't have quite enough oats so i used some shaved cocnut to fill in. used the white chocolate again on top. everyone at the baby shower loved them and wanted the recipe. the best part was that they were so easy and quick to make - i have twin newborns so anything that i can make while they're napping is a winner...

I can not believe the reviews for this recipe.  I was not impressed at all. We ended up throwing most of them away.  They were very bland.

They definately taste best cold when the chocolate is firm but everyone said they liked them even at room temp. I misread and thought it said use a 9x13 pan, so I was so surprised when I was almost done and noticed it said 9x9 because I had more than enough of the oat mixture to cover the bigger pan I just had to double my chocolate and peanut butter. I only used 1/2 cup plus 2 tbl butter and it was plenty. Very fun combo and super simple.

An easy recipe that is perfect for summer.  I thought they were a bit too buttery and planned to half the butter next time, but everyone else told me not to change a thing!

EXCELLENT!  Very yummy, easy to make, easy clean up.  These bars taste great out of the fridge.  I cut the butter in half and used 1/4 cup of light sour cream to replace butter. Came out perfect!  Great PB, chocolate taste

I am a little surprised by all the raves for this recipe, it just goes to show, the Spanish saying is true:  Contra gustos no hay disputa. (There's no arguing over tastes.)  I cut down on the butter to 3/4 c and used an 8x8 pan.  I cooked the oats on the stovetop as long as I could, but they still tasted kind of raw, which, some people like!  I prefer baked.  But definitely try this recipe, the kids in my class gobbled them up. The delicious middle will melt and be messy unless you keep the bars cool.

When you have a combination of Chocolate, Peanut Butter AND Oatmeal you can hardly go wrong.  Add to that the fact you do not have to cook it and it puts up there with one of the  PERFECT recipes.  This is an absolutely wonderful recipe.  I did not & would not change a thing!!

YUM! Added graham cracker crumbs and marshmallows to the peanut butter and chocolate chips.  I didn't use enough butter (1/2 c) so the oats didn't want to hold together very well (my fault).

I also cut the butter down to 3/4 cup. Cooking the oats in the butter/brown sugar mixture a few minutes made them taste as if they were baked. A great summer treat!

This recipe was amazingly good! I made a few changes, based on food allergies. I substituted vegan butter for the butter, honey for the brown sugar, and used grain sweetened chocolate chips. I also mixed some unsweetened coconut into the bottom layer of oats. I can't wait to make this recipe again!

Delicious and so easy to make!  I was looking for an easy dessert to take to a party and this is it.  I may experiment with this recipe with caramel and coconut at some point because I could see both those flavors adding to this nicely.  Definately a keeper!

I needed someing "different" for a school gathering. I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. Boy! Was it a BIG hit! I have had several requests for the recipe, but I think I will need more printer paper for the next time I make these to fill the requests I know I'll receive!

It's greasy. Could have been a really good thing but the ratios are off.  The butter overwhelms everything else and makes it feel like i'm just....eating butter with some chocolately oats thrown in.

I wish I had read the other reviews before I made it but I didn't and I followed the recipe exactly.  It was way too greasy.  The chocolate PB combination was great and I hate that I'm going to through it all out but I don't know how to salvage it.

I've made these three times now; this is what I've learned:  After reading the reviews the first time, I was careful to let them cook to the end of the 3 minutes in order to avoid the greasiness.  They were still a little greasy, but not too bad after they had completely set.  The second time I made them, I used an extra 1/4 cup oatmeal (for a total 3 1/4 cups) and didn't grease the pan.  That cut down on the greasiness a lot.  I just made them a third time using a different brand of oatmeal, and the topping feels different already, so I'm going to say that the recipe is brand sensitive.  I also used real butter this time instead of margarine and between that and the different oatmeal had to let it cook closer to 4 minutes. I have used peanut butter and I have used almond butter; each has turned-out yummy.  I think this is going to be one of those recipes that stays on my grocery list!

Absolutely love this recipe! Like others have said I cut the butter down to 3/4 and cooked the oats to the full 3 minutes. I also broke up some pretzels and but them in the chocolate layer and the saltiness/sweetness was a perfect balance! They didn't last long at all and everyone is already bothering me to make more :)

These are so simple and everyone loved them. I cut out 1/4 cup butter, added extra chocolate chips and peanut butter. Also cooked the oatmeal mixture a bit longer over low heat. I reserved about 1/3 of the chocolate/peanut butter mixture for the top. Chewy and satisfying.

Great recipe. I did not use any butter - made prune puree (half cup soft pitted dates and 1 cup warm water in blender and then passed it through a mesh strainer to get smooth liquid) to substitute 1 cup butter. Excellent - could not taste the prunes at all - only yummy oats, pb and chocolate.

I substituted 1/2 cup honey for the brown sugar which allowed me to decrease the butter to only 1/2 cup without the base crumbling.  I also cooked it for a bit longer.  Fantastic recipe!

These cookies are delicious. I made these recently during a short stay out of the country.  The apartment we were renting did not have much as far as cooking utensils so I was pretty limited in what I could make.  These no-bake cookies were about the easiest recipe I could find.  Since there were no baking pans, I made do with a plastic tray lined with was paper.  I could not find quick oats, so I used regular oats and just simmered them a little longer with the sugar and butter mixture.  I did add a little almond milk to soften them up a bit.  Fortunately the almond flavor complemented the recipe nicely.  The end result was delicious.  This recipe is not too complicated and very forgiving.  The end result was a delicious cookie that everyone in our group enjoyed.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious. The middle layer is creamy to the point of tasting like pure sweet butter. I did a 1.5 batch in my 9x13 because technically an 9x9 would be doubled in a  pan 18 inches long, and I had a limited number of oats. I followed some suggestions, reducing the butter by 1/4 and increasing peanut butter- especially because I used whipped. I would save maybe only a third or fourth of the oats tinpot into next time as it was rather crumbly.

I cut down on the butter by 1/4 cup and reserved only 1/3 of the topping as suggested by other reviewers.  These bars were far too sweet for anybody to enjoy except for the one with the sweetest tooth among us.  Also, they were very messy.  With each bite the topping would spill all over the place.

I scaled the butter down to 3/4 cup and upped the peanut butter as recommended by other reviews and these were still only okay. You can't really taste the peanut butter and it was pretty bland with vanilla being the only flavoring. These would be better if it were less expensive to make, but this particular recipe isn't worth the cost of real butter, chocolate, and peanut butter.

Wonderful.  I cut back butter to 3/4 c per some suggestions, but they do need something to help hold them together: a bit crumbly and I may keep tweaking this.  But cooking the butter and sugar until bubbly gave it a toffee candy flavor and the whole combination is so delicious, that even in its current state, this is a five star recipe.  Yum!

I liked the flavor and idea of these bars but I have to say I wasn't a fan of the rather "rough" raw oatmeal texture of them. I melted the butter and added the sugar and oats, and put it in the microwave rather than do it on the stovetop. I put it in for two minutes on med low but if I make these again I will maybe try three or four minutes instead. Also I took other suggestions and cut the butter by 1/4 cup and it was still a bit on the greasy side.

This was just O.K. to us, pretty bland.  The oat topping and oat bottom were so crumbly that it almost all fell off which is the main reason for a rating of 3.  I will probably not make these again.

Im giving this 5 stars, even though i slightly changed a few things, based on the reviews. I doubled the recipe, to make a 9x13 dish. I did however NOT double the butter. I used only 1 cup of butter, and 1 cup of applesauce instead. Also used 4 cups of Oats, and 2 cups of coconut flakes. And added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips into the oatmeal mixutre, once off the heat, so there would be something crunchy in the bars. My bars have only been chilled for 3 hours, and seem on the softerside... but thats beause of the apple sauce. Definatly will slice, and move them to the freezer, so they will be handy to pull out during the holiday season.

I've made these several times and they never fail to be a favorite.  Kids, adults just about anyone loves these. They are so simple and quick.  Great anytime of year, but in summer it's nice to keep the oven off, yet get a rich dessert!

These were easy and very good!  Mine were a little crumbly, so next time I'll reduce the butter like others have mentioned.  I put 16 M&M's on top so each square would have one and it looked festive.  They're definitely better chilled.  I'll make these again!

I have made this recipe twice for 2 different parties and on both occasions they disappeared before the other desserts - everyone loved them.  My last party was a Luau so I added macadamia nuts to give them a Hawaiian make-over but I think they are best without changes!

This was yummy. However, I would suggest doubling the amount of ingredients to make the bars thicker. The recipe listed here makes only a thin layer (even with a 9x9 square pan), in my opinion. I will make this next time with thicker layers.

I love these easy to make bars! I actually make them vegan by substituting margarine for butter and they still turn out fantastically. I make them every Christmas now as I have vegans in the family... My only change is that I do make extra of the chocolate/peanut butter filling.... Otherwise I don't find there to be enough inside.

Really good, but really rich!  I think next time I may decrease the amount of PB b/c it overpowered everything to me.  Thats a personal preference though, really.  Others want more PB.  If you are looking for an easy to make treat, you should try this!

These are delicious. I wasn't paying as much attention to the directions as I should have and ended up using the entire bag of chocolate chips instead of just one cup. I also reduced the butter as other reviewers suggested. They turned out very rich but the crumbles on the top didn't stay put. I would probably make this again.

Fabulous recipe, everyone loved these. Also used less butter...I doubled the recipe to make in a 9x13, so I used about 1 3/4 cups, it was the perfect amount. Also added more PB to chocolate mixture...and did 1 cup milk chocolate and 1 cup semi-sweet...it turned out perfect. Everyone wanted the recipe!!  :)

As I am not a huge fan of peanut butter I was hesitant to even try this recipe. After having one bite I was sold. There is just enough chocolate to counteract the peanut butter. It is rich so having more than 3 pieces is not advised. I did and I had to eat a banana afterwards to get the richness taste gone. This is fast and easy to make in a pinch.

Very quick and easy, made these last night and ate a few within an hour. I think I would use more peanut butter the next time. Followed others and used 3/4 butter rather than 1 cup and it still turned out great..not greasy at all. Great recipe! Thanks Traci.

Easy and delicious!  I did the chocolate butter/peanut butter in the microwave to simplify it, and I made my bottom oatmeal layer a bit thicker than half the batter.

Great recipe

These are good bar cookies, but not fabulous.  They can use less butter ( I followed the recipe exactly and there was butter not soaked up by the oats).  I agree with others that you can reduce the butter by at least a quarter cup if not a bit more.  Also, to make them look like the photo, I think you probably have to make them in an 8x8 (mine were much thinner in a 9x9).  At any rate, not sure I'll make them again, but it was worth a try!
Addendum:  I have to increase this score to 4 stars, all my friends seem to like these very much, so in all fairness, I am giving them more stars than I initially noted.

Excellent! Make these again. Decrease the butter to 3/4 cup for the oatmeal mixture. Use 1 1/4 cups choc chips and 3/4 cup peanut butter for the middle chocolatey mixture. Better.

Eh. i followed other's suggestions and used 3/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup PB and they were fine, but nothing special. if you have a craving for PB/chocolate you could just spread some PB on a chocolate bar and get the same effect with fewer calories. the oats do provide some crunch, which is nice, but i don't think this recipe is worth the 10 min it takes to make them.

Excellent recipe! I run a daycare and the kids are always asking me to make these for snack...even the pickiest of eaters!  I have also reduced the butter by 1/4 cup as I found them a little greasy the first time I made them.  I also add 1/4 cup of graham crumbs to the oat topping.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

have had these at coffee bars...decided to try to make them myself...your recipte amounts are not accurate...you need four times the cups of chips to get the thickness of chocolate 
shown in the photo...thank goodness as the small amount of peanut butter called for ruined the chocolate taste but was solved when adding more chips

I thought these were ok. I made the recipe without any changes and after doing so, I agree with other reviews that the butter could be lessened. Or perhaps the bottom layer of oats could be baked for a short time prior to putting the chocolate on, just to keep it from being too greasy.

Delicious! Like others, I cut the butter to 1/2 cup and added a splash of milk.  The oatmeal wasn't super soft, but we like a little crunch.  I did half milk and half white chocolate in the chocolate and did 3/4 cup peanut butter.  Yummmm!

They do taste good. The chocolate and peanut butter taste are really the only thing you taste. I left it in the fridge for 2 hours and then stuck it in the freezer for 10 mins before I cut it and the oatmeal bottom kept crumbling apart and not sticking together. Next time, i will use the correct size pan (accidentally used a 9x13" pan) and leave it in the fridge over night.

my 15 year-old daughter loves these for breakfast. I switch the ammounts of peanutbutter (1c) and chocolate chips (1/2c) to make them a little healthier.   this makes the middle stay soft so they have to be stored in the fridge.

Everyone I know who has tried these, love these.  I love them.  They're addicting.  If you cook the chocolate chips to almost burnt, you will create a cappuccino type flavor, which was a big hit.

I was looking for something quick to make for a bake sale.  These turned out great.  I did use 3/4 cup of peanut butter as others suggested.  I refrigerated overnight, let them set out a bit before cutting into squares and then into triangles since they were so rich. YUM! Will make again!

Wow, these were quick and tasty!  I cut the butter down by half and the oatmeal mixture held up just fine!  They were much quicker and easier than my standby no-bake cookie recipe.  The whole family enjoyed them.  The only part we didn't like was waiting for them to cool and firm up so we could eat them!  These will be made a lot in the summer months!

I would have given this 5 stars but I needed to adjust the recipe to make it harden.  Like other reviewers said, reduce the amount of butter by 1/4 cup.  By taking out this extra 1/4 cup the oatmeal mixture hardens.  I've made the recipe both ways and 1 cup is too much.  We love the taste and they are super easy to make.  I also added about 2 more tablespoons of pb.

This recipe was good but I think I will stick to my no bake cookies.  I couldn't bring myself to use a whole cup of butter so I reduced it and the oatmeal was too crumbly.  If you don't mind using so much butter they taste good.

I don't really understand why people raved about these. The oats fell off easily and were kind of chewy. They were sugary and not chocolaty enough. I wouldn't make these again.

Super tasty and super quick and easy.  Love them.  I did add 1/4 cup extra oats since other reviewers said it was too buttery.  Perfect!

This is a awsome recipe! It doesn't even last  2 days in my house. Very easy and quick to make. The only suggestion I have like others is to reduce butter by 1/4 cup.

These were a big hit. Following others comments, I used 3/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup peanut butter. 

I wasn't able to fully compress the top layer so I found the top was very crumbly, not sure how to remedy that but this was pretty minor given how easy the recipe was. I might actually use less filling (say 3/4 cup chocolate chips & 1/2 cup peanut butter) next time but that's just my preference. Great recipe, everyone (a class of 25 adults) loved it!

These are easy and excellent- I've made them many times. Once I used old-fashioned oat- oops! Big mistake, they still tasted good, but the fell apart!

They're a perfect treat!!  Simple to make, delicious to eat.  I made these for a party and everyone loved them.  They are very good and I will definitely make them again.  My only change was I needed 3 1/2 cups of oats instead of 3 cups.

I found the mixture to be a bit too greasy when adding it to the pan, but once they were in the frdge a while they seemed ok. Brought them to a work brunch, huge success, everyone loved them. Easy to make and taste great. Next time I may decrease the butter to 3/4 cup just to see if they are less greasy.

This recipe was delicious, but a good amount of the oatmeal mixture on top pretty much fell right off when we ate it. It didn't stick together nicely like I hoped. I think next time I'll try drizzling some of the chocolate and pb on top to keep the oatmeal from falling off. After just slicing and transporting the bars to a plate, a lot of the oatmeal had fallen off, so I saved it and used it in a granola bar recipe.  Very tasty though and very rich!

These were just O.K.  I made them for a party, and only a few were consumed.  They are best served straight from the fridge, but there is certainly nothing exciting about them.  Easy, but I won't be making these again.

very yummy...I just made this..i followed advice and used 1/2 cup butter..i did about 2 and 3/4 cups oats just because it looked a little dry in the pan. i used a 9x5 dish.  iwish i had saved some chocolate to drizzle on top. i drizzled a little caramel on top and then thought little bits of marshmallow might be good in it. i also added chopped walnuts and pressed it in to the chocolate..no crumbling here and no extra grease!

I agree with others, theree was too much butter. I would decrease the amount next time. Also I used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking oats. I would also add more peanut butter (personal preferance). Will make again though, kids loved them.

I have to hide these in the fridge if I want them to last more than 10 mins!!!! I listened to some of the other reveiws and used 3/4c. butter and 3/4c peanutbetter and thought they turned out well. I also tried drizzeling them with a little bit of the center on top. This makes them very pretty when cut. After they harden in the fridge I wrapped them individually in plastic wrap so they could be stored in the cookie jar w/o sticking together, (where they went VERY fast). Easy to make, very basic ingredients, and super yummy :)

I made these for a quick chocolate fix without heating up my kitchen on a 90-degree day.  Good flavor, but they get a weird consistency when they come out of the fridge to room temperature -- sweaty, oily, spongy.  It might have to do with the weather here.  If I try them again, I'll try them in January when the humidity and temperature are more cooperative.

Made this yesterday and changed only two things as others suggested.  Reduced butter to 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) Drizzled about 1/3-1/2 of the mixture on the top of the bars.    Husband and I both call this a keeper!

Super easy and delicious too! We'll definitely make this again as long as I can remember that it needs time in the refrigerator before I serve it. Not a last minute dessert but otherwise my household loves it.

I was not impressed. The middle chocolate layer tasted great, but since this dish isn't baked the oaks took on a dry, raw flavor- sort of like raw uncooked flour. Definately fast an easy, just not 5 star quality.

I doubled the recipe for a 9X13 batch, only use 1 1/2 cups butter, very important!! Also! Milk chocolate chips tasted MUCH much better than semi sweet, I tried both, definately milk chocolate! Also saved like 1/2 cup of warm peanutbutter/chocolate filling in plastic zip loc baggy and cut off the corner to make pretty drizzle lines over the finished product. Everyone wanted the recipe!!

One word.....DELISH!!!!   These are awesome!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I doubled everything but the butter and used all the oatmeal for the  bottom and then made another half batch for the top mixture for the topping.  PERFECTION.  Thank you for submitting this 5 star recipe!  Best part of all there is no baking involved!  WOOT!  WOOT!!!

These were amazing and so simple. I took other reviewer's advice and only used 3/4 cup butter and it came out perfect with minimal crumbling. I also added 1/2 cup flaxseed and drizzled some of the chocolate mixture on top. Absolutely divine! Thank you for a great receipe.

VERY easy and very tasty, that makes this just about perfect in my eyes.  I always try to make a recipe exactly as stated the first time just to see what it is intended to be and then tweak it from there.  I won't be doing any tweaking on this one.  I read some suggested to reduce the butter but I didn't think it was needed.  Just make sure to cook the oat, butter and sugar mixture as stated.  I could see the butter being absorbed as it cooked.  And the rich, buttery flavor these bars have is something you don't want to cut short.  This will be my go to recipe when I need something quick and easy for that bake sale or treat day at work.

i enjoyed these a lot, especially how quick and easy they are to make.  for the butter i used 1/4c regular butter and 1/2c light butter spread (total 3/4c). the result was a much more crumbly oatmeal than it would probably normally have been. but in an effort to cut some calories i think it still tasted great.  next time i might put most of the oatmeal in the bottom and press it down (cuts down on the crumbliness!) and just put a little on top so it stays together better.  thanks!!

I was looking for something to kill an oaty, chocolatey, peanut buttery craving I was having that didn't include turning on the oven.. VIOLA! These were AWESOME! I only had margarine on hand, but I can imagine using butter would make them only that much better!  Sinful!

Amazing!  I read some reviews so I could double the recipe and used 9x13 pan.  I followed one persons recommendation of using 1.5 cups butter and adding a little Karo syrup to the oats in the pan - seemed to work like a charm!  I am making these again this week...  I think I ate half the pan last night by myself! LOL!

Excellent recipe! I used 1/2 cup of butter but the oats were staying dry and crumbly. So I added 2-3 tbsp water and cooked it for much longer following other reviews. I added about 1/4th cup peanut butter towards the end. This mixture was very tasty but felt oily and I might try reducing the butter and increasing the water a bit more.

I am so sorry, but these weren't all that great. I expected them to be so delicious with these ingredients, but unfortunately, due to the texture, they weren't. Even though I followed exactly, and used quick cooking oats, the oats stayed hard and had a bite to them. I even cooked a little longer hoping they would soften up or puff up a bit, but they did not. It's been two weeks since I've made them, and am still begging my kids to finish them, because I hate food going to waste! They think they taste okay, but never ask for more than one small piece (which is not normal!). Thanks for sharing your recipe though!

I followed the recipe, with the exception of using less butter as advised by other reviewers, but wasn't wowed. The oat part was bland, and overall the flavor didn't pop the way I'd hoped.

Ok, 3.5 stars. They are good, just not quite 4 stars and certainly not 5. I'm glad I used only 3/4cup of butter, as they would've been exceptionally oily/greasy. The flavors are really quite good, it just doesn't top the many other fabulous recipes out there. For ease of prep, they could be a 4 or 5... Good go-to recipe if you don't want to turn on the oven or if you want a treat but ran out of eggs...the other ingredients are probably in your pantry!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and agree with using less butter. I used margarine b/c that's what I had so that could make have been why. It was quite easy to make, and took less than 20 minutes for everything. I felt a bit rushed doing both mixtures at the same time, and had trouble crumbling the oat mix on top b/c it was still quite hot. Next time (I WILL make this again!) I'll use less margarine and do the oat mix first and set it aside. All in all, very good recipe I know my kids will love this!

I followed the directions exactly as written.  They tasted too strongly of butter and were soggy on the bottom.

What a great recipe! I like that it's easy to modify, by using different chocolates or adding coconut flakes to it. I added coconut flakes to the oat mixture. It is so good, and dangerously addicting! There's quite a bit of butter, so either add more oats, or use less butter. Personally, I love the crunchy oats, so I'll probably use a cup more next time.

The only reason I'm giving this recipe a 4* instead of 5 is because of the amount of butter. I add 3/4 cup and a little extra oats. And just for preference, I add a little less chocolate chips. I store them in the fridge so they stay firm. They don't last long around my house. Great recipe when you reduce the amount of butter.

i usually try to make a recipe for the first time without making many suggested changes, so that i can rate the original recipe fairly. in this case, i wish i would have followed suggestions to reduce the amount of butter in the oat mixture. it was absolutely too much butter and overpowered the flavor of the oats. i also agree that less peanut butter would be a good idea, so that the peanut-chocolate layer isn't quite so thick (trust me -- i love chocolate and peanut butter but you want a treat that works together as a whole). my son helped me make these, and he loves them. that all being said, i might make these again, with modifications.

The is a really good recipe, my husband and kids ate the whole batch in one day.  Like others though, I did have a problem with too much butter in the oatmeal mixture.  The second batch I made I just added 3 1/2 cups of oatmeal instead of 3 and it turned out great.  My family like the extra crust and topping.

Awesome recipe. I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup though...next time I think I'll leave the sugar out all together to make it a bit more healthier. Although the amount of butter is a bit much...that's the one indulgence I'll keep at its full 1 cup. It's a yummy dessert or snack.

My 12-year-old daughter made these this afternoon and we just had them for dessert.  Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I had her cut the amount of butter in half.  That wasn't quite enough to keep everything together, so next time I think we'll try 3/4 cup.  Other than being a bit crumbly, though, these were very good!  We'll definitely make them again.

Oh man these are rich!  I did as others suggested and used 3/4 c. butter and 3/4 c. peanut butter.  And I melted the peanut butter and chocolate chips in the microwave, making sure to take the mixture out and stir it often.  I found that I didn't have enough of the oatmeal/brown sugar/butter mixture to completely cover the top, so I might up the amounts next time.

These were gone before I turned around to get a second bar!  The only thing I changed was that I only had regular oats on hand.  It still came out great, though.

To start, I did alter this recipe after reading other reviews.  I used 3/4 C butter and 3/4 C peanut butter.  The oatmeal topping and bottom were pretty crumbly, but this was so good.  I don't know who I'm going to give these to...If I don't give them away, I'll weigh 500 lbs!  This was also a super easy recipe.  My 4 year old helped me, and was able to measure all of the ingredients.

Really good but as others mentioned there's too much butter.  I had a big puddle of it on the bottom of the pan as I was putting it in the pan. Rich but delish.

I decreased the amount of butter to 3/4 cup, and increased the amount of peanut butter to 3/4 cup. There was too much oatmeal mixture for the bars, but it was good to eat plain! Next time, I'll make peanut butter and jam bars by adding about 1/2 cup of raspberry jam!  These are great!

Because I used less butter (like others recommended) I found that when eating the bars, the oatmeal topping kept falling off.  I think next time I will make with the stated amount of butter, so that maybe it will stick together better.  Great recipe - everyone loved them!  Made two batches - one with semi-sweet and the other with milk chocolate - don't know that I could tell much of a difference in the taste.

This recipe was just okay for us.  I can't put my finger on why.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  I love all of these ingredients, I guess just not like this. I will probably not make them again.  Edit-5/29/09-I decided since these have such rave reviews, I must have done something wrong to not have loved these!  Well, not sure what I did wrong the first time, but I am upgrading this from 3 to 4 stars.  I made sure to gently smoosh the top layer of oats into the chocolate mixture, that seemed to keep them from being so crumbly, too.

I really like this but did make some changes due to comments from previous reviews.  I decreased the butter to 1/2 cup and added 3/4 cup of peanut butter instead of 1/2.  Made this way, it came out perfect.  And very easy to prepare.

These are soooo good.  Very rich - you need a glass of milk to drink with them.  I love these.  The only change I made was to melt the chocolate chips and peanut butter in the microwave for 1 minute and then stirred until smooth.

I thought these bars were awesome! I love no-bake recipes in the summertime, and these were so easy to make. I think that the reviewers who complained about them not staying together didn't refridgerate them long enough because I had absolutely no trouble.

this recipes was deffiantely easy however i was dissappointed with the end result.  While cutting the bars, they fell apart and didn't look as great as i hoped.  i did find however that if you melt together 1/2c. choc chips, 2 tbs peanut butter, and 1 tsp shortning, and drizzle it on top, they look a lot better.  the taste was okay, but not amazing.

These were gone fast!!  I decreased the butter by a third and they were not greasy at all.  The only down side was that they were pretty crumbly.

Very delicious and easy to make.  I did decrease the butter to 1.5 sticks and used the 1/4 cup milk and had it on low heat about 5 minutes.  I also used a 9x12 pan but I do not recommend this, the oat layer is just too thin. Next time I'll up the oats to 3.5 cups but if you don't want to play with the recipe then just stick with the 9x9 pan.

DELICIOUS! Easy to make and very tasty. I didn't have a nine by nine inch pan, but they came out nice and thick in the 9'' x 6''. I'm not the hugest fan of chocolate, so to make sure it didn't overpower the peanut butter, I halved the choco chips w/butterscotch  chips. The center was nice and gooey. THANKS! can't wait to make them again.

My husband wanted me to put this quote in the review, he says these bars were "absolutely freaking amazing". I followed the recipe except I added just a little more peanut butter (we are pb fanatics). It turned out great. This is now my husbands favorite dessert. Thanks!

This turned out great.  I ran out of oats so I used rice krispies to make up the difference.  Still great!  I reduced butter as others said.  I'll make this one again and again!

I wish I had read the reviews that suggested to cut back on the butter before I made these, but they still came out good/ Also, it was hard to spread the chocolate & the top oat layer.

Yum!  These were very good.  The topping was a little crumbly, but I thought the flavors were delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and they were a big hit.  I'll definitely make them again as they are yummy and easy too!

I reduced the butter to 3/4 cup as suggested by many of the reviewers.  It seemed to be enough although the crust was a bit crumbly.  I might try with the full cup next time.  Although they are "no bake" you still use 2 pans on the stove so there is still some clean up.  Really good though.  Everyone loved them!

Sorry, but all I could taste was uncooked oatmeal.  I ended up scraping off as much crust as I could and just eating the chocolate.  Which was good, it tasted like a Snickers bar.  I would try this again but with a baked crust, like a shortbread or graham cracker crust I bet it would be better.

Surprisingly, I really did not like these.  And that really did surprise me because of all the great reviews and the fact that I like all these ingredients and it sounded good.  I also cut down on the butter to 3/4 cup, but the oat mixture still has a very strong butter flavor that was a bit overpowering to me.  I think it also need to be cooked more somehow - the bottom part, anyway.  I felt like something was missing, like graham cracker crust, nuts or coconut, but then you would basically have Dolly Bars.  Still, this was very easy to make and I will probably try again but will tweak to my family's tastes - maybe try margarine and crunchy peanut butter.  My husband is a milk chocolate fan, so maybe I'll try milk chocolate chips next time.

This recipe is easy and makes a great bar. I took the advice of other reviewers by reducing butter to 3/4 cup and using a 9" x 13" glass pan. These package well for a take along dessert or potluck.

The kids loved these but the adults didn't care for the uncooked oatmeal. Cooking them with the brown sugar for 2-3 minutes wasn't enough. Maybe will cook them longer next time.

After reading the reviews, I decided to decrease the butter.  When I actually made these, I forgot all about it and used the full amount.  The other reviews were correct--way too much butter, and a bit greasy.  Tasty nonetheless.  And not overly sweet.  I used natural p.b. without any sugar, etc.  But definitely decrease the butter to a maximum of 3/4 cup.

These are really good. I did use 3/4 cup of butter and even added a little more oat (1/4 cup) just because it looked so oily. I also didn't have a 9x9 pan so I used an 11x7 which worked fine. Oh and I also didn't do the oat topping, just oat bottom and chocolate topping. With all the adjustments, they still turned out delicious.

This is just a easy, REALLY tasty, wonderful recipe.
As advised by other reviewers, only went 3/4 C butter, but followed the rest to a tee. 
The hardest part about it? Not eating the whole batch in one sitting.
Took 10 mins to prepare - too easy!!

the oatmeal is not suppost to cook and soften in the butter.  to help with the raw taste, try toasting the oats in the oven until golden, then add them to the butter and proceed with recipe.

The consistency is a bit different, but these taste just like the Oat Bars at Starbucks!!!!
I cut back the butter to 3/4 c. like other users said, but I'll try adding some milk next time to soften up the oats a bit.

These are so good and super easy to make! Only change I made was to reduce the butter to 3/4 c. as suggested by others. I sprayed the bottom and sides of the pan well with cooking spray and then just flipped the pan over onto a cutting board after a few hours in the fridge. The whole thing popped right out and made cutting it up a lot easier. Make sure you cut these in small pieces - they're VERY rich.

THESE ARE AMAZING!!!! The only reason for 4 stars is that they are quite greasy with all that butter so i halved the butter and added milk instead- turned out a lot better and still clumped perfectly. There's also really no need to grease the pan either. Great taste, gotta make these for all those cookie moments!

I cut back the butter like the other reviewers said.  I made sure to cook my oatmeal for a longer time and it stayed soft.  I melted my chocolate chips and peanut butter in the microwave for one minute.  Very fast and easy to make.  But I don't think you're going to get 32 pieces out of it!

These were wonderful - everyone loved them! I only used 1/2 cup butter so the oats didn't completely stick together --leaving the bars a bit crumbly but the flavor was perfect and the bars were not at all too greasy. I also used natural peanut butter to cut some sugar. Delicious!

Really good!   I was able to put this is an 8x10 dish and get more servings without doubling recipe.  I did NOT change the butter and I thought they were perfect.  The chocolate & peanut butter layer was a bit thick (even in the larger dish), so I might that cut down next time but AWESOME nevertheless.

This recipe rocks!!! Instead of doing all chocolate chips I put in 2/3c chocolate and 1/3c butterscotch chips. Very pretty and tasty. :)

These were good. I reduced the butter as per reviews. I've never had peanut butter and chocolate together before but I loved it. Thanks

These bars are absolutely delicious. I think there could be substantially less butter used, as much of it drained and formed a layer on the bottom of the pan, but the complete saturation of oats in butter is what makes them so good.

I used milk chocolate rather than semi-sweet, and I couldn't have been happier.

Loved this!!! I was so quick and easy! It reminded me of no-bake-cookies that I have been making and eating for years. Had to double the recipe ( we have 8 boys) and I used more peanut-butter. This is a keeper!

Yummy, the chocolate peanut butter middle was creamy like a truffle. I think next time though I will use 3/4 cup of butter.

I made the recipe as is.....definitely reduce butter maybe by a 1/4 cup.   Add more peanut butter as other reviews have suggested.   In the original recipe, I cannot taste the peanut butter at all.

Used baking sticks instead of butter, that was a mistake. Stick with butter so will firm up.

I've made these a few times and they disappear quickly!   
FYI - I do add more oats (~1/2 cup)  and suggest a little less butter for the calorie wise (~ 3/4 cup works well).

only thing I did differently was that instead of melting the chocolate and peanut butter on the stove top, I just popped them into the microwave for about a minute on high.  Worked like a charm.  Definitely a dangerous recipe for someone who is trying to watch their caloric intake as it tastes very good and is super simple to make.

I made a few accommodations for food allergies and some of the suggestions in earlier posts. I Decreased the butter to 3/4 cup and increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup. Since I have a chocolate allergy I substituted salted Carmel chips, 1 cup. They turned out fabulously delicious!!! I keep them in the fridge for a cool treat.

The second time I made this recipe, I melted the butter and chocolate in the microwave. My family said it tasted better and it took a fraction of the time. I used natural peanut butter and dark chocolate chips and 1/4 sugar, so it turned out flavourful rather than sweet.

I made them as written but used PB with flax and chia seeds.  I probably could have reduced the butter a bit, as there was a little that didn't get soaked up.  Everyone loved them regardless.  My only suggestion is to make sure you cut them before freezing, because it's very hard to do afterwards.  Delicious at any temp.

Seriously delicious!  I've made a lot of these types of bars and this is my favorite!  I used Bob's Gluten Free Old Fashioned Oats. Cooking them a little in the butter and brown sugar made them a soft and delicious texture.  I love that the chocolate and peanut butter are melted together.  I will make this again and again!

So good!  Very decadent!  I’ll have to move it from “snacks” to “desserts”. My daughter said it was like the bars you get in the bakery case. 
I followed the recipe, except used olive oil instead of butter and took one reviewer’s advice and cooked the oatmeal for longer (maybe 8 mins?). All amounts the same though.  Perfect!

Just a couple suggestions.
Use an 8 x 8 inch pan, double the chocolate filling and decrease the butter from 1 cup to 3/4 cup.  Otherwise, good eats!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions:
* reduced margarine (I used instead of butter) to 3/4 cup
* thinned out the mixture with a little milk
* cooked it for more like 5-6 minutes to make sure the milk was incorporated

All these were great suggestions! I also didn't have quite the amount of oats on hand than were required, so I substituted sweetened coconut flakes. You couldn't taste them at all, but they added an extra chewiness to the bars that everyone liked. I will make these again for sure, and I might try different types of chips, like milk chocolate or butterscotch, in place of semi-sweet. These were super easy and a great treat for when it's too hot to turn on the oven. Thanks for the recipe!

I accidentally added one cup peanut butter when I made these after misreading the ingredients. The bars turned out amazing and everyone loved them!! I’ll definitely be making these again!

I din't make it, my cousin did.  Very more-ish, the more you eat the more you want.  I am so glad  she cut them into fingers because it would be more than the block I would have to run around.  She did say  to use a good quality peanut butter as this can change the taste.  I'm making them after my nieces birthday cake.

These were awesome.  I cut down on the butter as others suggested, to 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks). And added a little extra chocolate and peanut butter. Also cooked the oats about 5 minutes to avoid crumbling.  Perfect!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

These are good.  Nothing to write home about.  I followed the recipe exactly, except added a  little more peanut butter and cooked the oats for about 5-6 minutes, adding a little water occasionally since the mixture was so dry.  I also used margarine instead of butter and I didn't think it was too greasy at all.  Thanks for the recipe; it was the perfect treat for my neighbor's son who is allergic to gluten, milk, and eggs.

Made these and they're delish! 1st time I followed the recipe but subbed almond butter for peanut butter bc that's all I had. 2nd batch I cut butter to half cup and increased oats to 4 cups and it came out perfect! Using 1 cup butter was a little too greasy for only 3 cups of oats.

This is the best tasting and easiest dessert recipe I've ever made. The ratios are perfect. No modifications are needed, although I do use dark chocolate chips and decrease the butter to 3/4 cup just to feel better about making these all the time. My kids have asked me to make these once a week from now on. Love that they're filling and not too sweet!

Eh, these are ok. I made according to the recipe, but they are just kind of boring. It is a bit too much butter - I should have followed others. But still, I can’t see how that would greatly change the taste. The oatmeal needs more flavor...perhaps cinnamon. But I’m not sure I’ll bother making them again. On the plus side, they were fairly easy & faster than waiting for each sheet of cookies to bake.

I made this using white sugar, 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of whole milk. I added in 1/4 cup of whole flax seeds in place of some of the oatmeal, and didn’t have chocolate chips so I used Nutella. It was good, but wasn’t quite a bar and didn’t quite set. This may have also been because of my changes. It’s really rich and I checked the nutrition of it in a calorie counter and it only had 5 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber :/ . It did have over 300 mg of potassium though!

Good base, but too cloyingly sweet! Next time I'l try reducing the sugar by 1/2. Also, I added about 1/3 cup unsweetened coconut. Finally, as other reviewers have said, it really is important to let these come to a FULL boil and then let them boil for a complete 1 1/2 min (even up to 15 seconds more than that is fine).

Didn’t have quick oats so used rice crispies. Added enough to absorb the butter 4-5 cups. Used 10 in round pan. When it set, lots of the rice crispies were very loose. My husband thought of marshmallows so we melted almost an entire bag and poured it on top. Hard to cut into beautiful pieces but who cares., it was absolutely delicious. Will make it again but will try quick oats next time and some rice crispies too. Yum yum

I needed to make something quick for a get-together and had this recipe saved and all the ingredients on hand, so I decided to give it a try. However, I was disappointed and won't make it again.  It's tasty, but not great. The oatmeal crumb is very crumbly and hard to eat. especially as it sits out and softens. The chocolate/peanut butter filling is rich and tastes good, but not great. It's a lot of fat (1 c. butter, 1/2 c peanut butter) for a not-all-that-great treat. Not bad, not great... If I'm going to indulge, I want great.

What a mess!  Barley enough to cover the bottom of a 9 X 9 pan.  The remaining oat batter was not enough to cover the top.  Chocolate melts too easily and them you are holding a handful of meted chocolate goo!

Wonderful recipe! I would also recommend cutting the butter to 3/4 of a cup- it came out perfectly. Also, I used soft brown sugar(by accident) and it came out wonderfully none the less. The top layer crumbled a little so I simply pressed the top layer in again after it had already set and that solved the problem completely.

Easy, quick, yum. Doubled recipe, used 1 1/2 c butter, everything else same. Reserved 1/2 c choc/PB mix to drizzle over top. Forgot to add extra PB as recommended but honestly love the taste as is. Enjoy!

Very good!  I cut back on the butter per other reviewers and added a little cinnamon to the oats mixture.   We'll do this one again when we need something for school or church events.
Thanks for posting!

I love this! It is a very simple whip em’ up recipe if you want something sweet and chewy without a ton of mess and two hours in the kitchen. I love to bake but need a break every now and then with a simple sweet delicious recipe and this fit the bill. Next time I will make it in an 8x8 pan but triple layer it and add a little more cinnamon as 1 tsp is not enough. I might even add cranberries for a tart/sweet flavor. You can really play with this recipe to make it what you want but it is good on its own. Highly recommend.

I made this for my nephews at a family dinner and we were talking about them made with oatmeal & one of my nephews walked up took 3 bars at once & said he doesn't like oatmeal. Well when he found out it as mostly oatmeal in the bars he said "I guest I do like oatmeal. The kids ate all the bars, this recipe was a success.

I made this  for the first time today after thoroughly reading comments, with a few changes. Less butter being number one. Half a cup, thenI incorporated both a little milk, peanut butter and salt in cooking the oat. With not chocolate chips on hand I used small pieces of dark chocolate with nuts as well as grounded Maltesers I had left around the house, mixed with less peanut butter. Topped it with some powder coconut, and it came out great. Next time I'll use a little more milk to keep the oats together better. Oh and the freezer is definitely the place to put them first. But be patient, regardless.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for.  There was not too much butter.  The recipe calls for quick oats, not rolled oats like so many of the pictures are, and the quick oats absorbed all the butter just fine.  :)  I thought it was a little underwhelming--I don't like peanut butter, and thought it needed some spice (like cinnamon), but I took it to a church picnic where people were actually going around trying to figure out who made it because they wanted the recipe so badly.  It was, in short, a big hit, with tons of compliments.  So... five stars!  It was also super easy and quick and non-messy to make.  I will definitely be planning to make it again!

I tripled this recipe since I bake for a lady that does my lawn and her helper. they turned out wonderful  nice and sweet and chocolatey just like they like! I did cut the butter by 1/2 cup for a triple recipe and I did double filling,  I wanted a nice thick layer of peanut buttery chocolate in the middle.  I will make these again everything I like in a recipe quick, easy and tasty!!

I tried reducing the margarine (instead of butter) down by 1/4 like others mentioned, but the oats didn't bind together. I also added a little salt like others suggested, and my wife thought it was too salty. Probably won't try it again.

Wow, these were really sweet!! I used 2 cups oatmeal and 1 cup unsweetened coconut chips, subbed approximately 1/2 cup coconut oil and 4T butter. I did use the 1/2 cup brown sugar, but would definitely reduce that amount next time. I also added some peanut butter powder to the oatmeal mixture, as well as 1/4 tsp salt. I do think that this would be fantastic with a rice krispie base and the oatmeal topping. It was easy to make for a no-bake option on a hot day, but I'll tweak this next time to reduce the sweetness and change the texture a bit.

Made exactly as recipe stated.  Everyone loved them!  I thought the butter was too much though and next time I would reduce that somewhat.  But honestly, they went so quickly once I set them out for everyone to eat that I know they were good!

This reminded me of O'Henry Bars which I make with the same amount of butter, but since this recipe was in more of a compact pan, it seems a bit heavy on the butter. I think I'll reduce it for this recipe to 3/4 c. of butter. I did add 1/2 t. of cinnamon (I thought I got it from this recipe, but I guess it was from a different version) which gave it a nice different flavor.

I made a few changes. I added unsweetened coconut and pecan pieces to the melted butter and before adding the oats I added a scoop of my husband's vanilla protein drink mix. I also only used half of the chocolate chips which I think is still too much chocolate.

These look beautiful but taste very bland.  I love chocolate, peanut butter, and oats. First off the chocolate flavor was very muted, perhaps it needed salt?  The oats had a very raw taste, if I were to make these again I'd toast them before mixing.  The butter just weighed everything down and gave the bars a heavy, waxy mouthfeel.  I would tweak this idea by reducing the butter significantly, making sure salt got into the recipe, and mixing the peanut butter with the oats instead of the chocolate and make a chocolate ganache for the middle layer.

Very delicious and easy to make.  I made these a week in advance, wrapped the uncut block for the freezer, then set out for about 15 minutes before cutting into small squares.  Worked perfectly.  I'll definitely make these again.

This recipe is fairly easy to prepare, as long as you have time to let it set up in the refrigerator. They were yummy because of the combination of ingredients, but I need to find something that I can use instead of the large amount of butter so all can eat. :)

These were very easy. I only greased the bottom of the pan with cooking spray, and it was fine and the sides did not stick. Make sure to melt butter on low heat so it doesn't burn. Only takes ten minutes of prep...and they only need to chill for about two hours, so they can be made quickly. I left them in the fridge overnight then let them come to room temperature before cutting. I cut them into strips in the pan and then removed each strip and cut it smaller on the cutting board. Very rich, so the bars can be cut small.

Pretty good. The filling is delicious. I agree with other reviewers, there's too much better in the crust. It ends up pooling and solidifying one the bottom and especially in the corners, not very appetizing. Ill make this again but I'll reduce the amount of butter.

I made these for the first time yesterday. However I took someone's advice and used 3/4 cup butter instead of 1 cup and  used 3/4 cup peanut butter instead of a 1/2 cup. Thanks, because they were perfect!! I also substituted 3 cups Nature Valley original muesli (basically oats with a few cranberries and nuts thrown in) for the 3 cups oats. This was perfect too, because to help the person who said they were bland, this definitely perked them up. Try my adjusted recipe and you won't be disappointed.....YUM

Super duper easy and very yummy. A bit messy and the top of mine crumbled off as I ate it - only a problem if you are eating with small children like I was! (I followed the recipe exactly and even pressed the top later down). I think I'll make it again - just will be mentally prepared to vacuum after ;).

I only used 3/4 cup better and also used 3/4 brown sugar.  I increased the vanilla to 2 t.  After melting the peanut butter and chocolate chips together they tasted a little bitter so I mixed in 1/2 cup powered sugar to the mixture.  These turned out so good!! Next time I'm going to mix some marshmallows in to the chocolate/peanut butter mixture.

There was way too much butter in this recipe. The next time I make these, I will only use one stick of butter (1/2 cup) and if it isn't enough to moisten the oats, I'll add some coconut oil.  Even taste wise the butter was over powering.   I think it will be much better with less.

This is great without changes except I did use less butter as others suggested from the start.  On the second batch  I decided to try making changes to the proportions of the layers . I increased  the oats by 1/2 cup. I pulsed the oats in the blender once or twice to make them a bit finer before I added them to the butter.  I also added a tsp. of salt. I love salty and sweet together and this was just my personal preference. I doubled the chocolate and peanut butter layer and used an 8X8 dish. They came out great.

Super sweet! Though I accidentally added double the brown sugar, definitely don't do that lol. It's still delicious, just SUPER sweet. Also I used a 13x9 pan, so if doing this I recommend adding a little more oats and maybe a little more brown sugar (hard to tell though because of my mess-up). 
Also didn't have any vanilla (oops!) so I used about a teaspoon or two of honey. 
Also used nestle's milk chocolate chips (not semi sweet) and chunky peanut butter cooking over a double broiler (first time using one, much easier than expected.) Very, very good.

Oh and used less butter, I think I used a little less than 3/4 a cup, turned out very good.

Very low effort with tasty results.  I thought the oatmeal part was a little chewier than I'd like.  I'd rather put a little more effort into a cookie and get better results, like the traditional no-bake drop cookies.

I used a little less butter but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I'm glad I made them, and they satisfied the husband's dessert craving, but I probably won't make them again. I like sweet things, but these were too sweet. I think it was the brown sugar. It was like wine cooler sweet instead of red wine sweet, if that makes sense. I much prefer the chocolate peanut butter oatmeal "drop cookies" made with cocoa powder to these bars. 
My husband said "5 stars, I guess" and I would only give them 3 stars.

These were excellent. I added vanilla protein powder to the oat mix and used maple syrup as the sweetener. Tasted like marshmallows. I also used almond butter as the hubby doesn't care for peanut butter. They disappeared in no time!

These were good and very quick/easy to make, but I agree with other reviews that there is WAY too much butter! They turned out quite greasy and the top is "soggy". They taste great and are very rich, but the butter is overwhelming & messy. My suggestion would be to cut the butter in half. I will say that the bottom turned out well, but the top is really just a greasy pile of oats that falls all over the place when cut. The top would be better with half the amount of butter and some flour & brown (or white) sugar, similar to the topping found on dessert crisp recipes. 

I will make these again, because they are very quick & easy- and also very rich, so small squares can go a long way! But it needs modifications, because as written, the butter is just too much. I also see others saved some chocolate mixture for a drizzle on top- that may help (and add to the aesthetic appeal)!

Very addicting. I reduced the butter to 3/4 c. per another reviewer's notes and it was enough. I used 1/2 butterscotch chips & 1/2 dark chocolate semi-sweet choc chips and it was sooo good. I also used a 9x13 pan (was in default mode by accident) and although thinner, I think it helped create a good size portion. I can't imaging the sugar overdoze if made in a smaller pan. Very yum!

My 11 year old made these.  Delicious!  However, next time she will try 1/4 c. Less butter  and the sugar doesn't need to. Be packed. TFTR!
Update:  used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and it was completely fine.  Maybe try 1 1/4 sticks.   Used just shy of 1/2 c. unpacked brown sugar and could get by with even less.

Love these bars! 1 cup of butter is too much, they come out greasy. I reduced it to 3/4 cup and it worked well. I do not bring these to room temperature before cutting, I keep these refrigerated and they cut good and are awesome!

Delicious! I reduced the butter by 1/4 cup as suggested, and I used a portion of coconut oil. I also used old fashioned oats, so I did cook mine a bit longer. I think I'll add something else next time - maybe graham cracker crumbs, but not sure. I'll be making these again very soon!

I haven't, but intend to try this recipe.  My problem is, there is no statement of how many servings with this, or many of the recipes.  How can you give nutrition info when you don't know how many servings a person will make, and you don't tell them what a serving is?

The concept here is a good one. But they were way too sweet and a little greasy. Next time I'm going to cut the sugar and butter in half. It also needed a little something extra. I still can't decide quite what. I might add some peanut butter to the oat mixture.

I love this recipe! I added half the amount of butter but with 2 spoons of milk. Between first layer of oats I added one layer of Marzipan, then chocolate with peanut butter and then rest of oats. It was great!

Made this yesterday as a surprise dessert and it came out great! Was VERY rich, so we could only eat a small square of it. Put it in the freezer for 3 hours, then took it out to sit on the counter for 30 minutes before cutting it up. Did not get the defined layers like the pictures, so I think next time I will let the chocolate cool before putting on the top layer of oats. Was still really good! Made it exactly as directed.

I made this with 3/4 cup butter and 2 T milk and got a good consistency for the crust.  I thought this cookie was good, but not outstanding.  There are other cookie recipes I like better, so I probably won't make this one again.  It's not like it's especially easy as a no-bake, since you have two separate pots on the stove, plus you have to let the bars cool for several hours.  Oh, and definitely eat them cold, much better that way.

Good bars.  I gave only a 4 since the substitutions are really needed.  I used only 1/2 c. butter and added 1/4 c. peanut butter (for flavor) and a little milk for the bottom layer for moisture.  Loved the flavor.  I like the look of only 2 layers, so I put all of that layer in the pan and topped it with the choc. chip/p.b. layer.  Beautiful looking bars and delicious.  I am ready to try subbing out a little more of the butter - applesauce or yogurt.

Delicious! I read the reviews before I made them, so I cut the butter to 3/4 cup. My husband does not like peanut butter in desserts, so I used almond butter instead, and to the chocolate mixture I added a small amount of toasted almonds. Though not something that can be consumed as soon as it is cooked, for it needs to harden, this is one treat I know I will be making often.

Wowza!!! Can't wait for my peanut butter loving husband to come home because he will be blown out of his shoes, I just know it!! I made some changes though, which I am very happy I did. When making the oatmeal, I used about 7oz of smart balance buttery spread (instead of butter), and added 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon, as well as extra vanilla to the sugar/oatmeal mixture. Then, after I finished mixing all the ingredients together, I made sure to let it cook longer then 3 mins. (I probably cooked it on medium for about 7 mins or so. Then, after it was cooked, I added more brown sugar to taste and lightly mixed it in with the oatmeal mixture. Then, for the chocolate mixture, I used trader joes natural butter (less sugar), 3/4 a cup of dark chocolate morsels, and about two 1oz squares of white chocolate. I added a pinch of brown sugar and cinnamon to the chocolate as well. Then, I followed the rest of the recipe as written, but at the end I sprinkled it with a little brown sugar, drizzled some of the chocolates mix on top, and then sparingly placed dried cranberries on top. Delish!

I reduced the butter and it was still very buttery tasting.  And it was sooo very crumbly to eat.  I was packing them to take for lunch at work and often made a mess when transferring from the pan to a small Ziploc.

Made this exactly following the directions... It's become a staple in our family for the last 2 years now. Tasty and perfect! Way better than the "nobakes" recipes you see around with pretty much the same ingredients- those never taste as good. This recipe is perfect! Love it.

I am not sure where the idea of too much butter is coming up. I actually had to increase mine by 1 Tbsp to get the mixture to stick together at all. Possibly because I had steel cut oats? Anyway I cooked mine quite a bit longer as steel cut always take much more time to cook. I'm a bit worried that they will crumble and be a mess as they are still cooling. I did taste a bit and if they stick together they will be yummy.

It's a great dessert.  I tried to make it healthier so I also did 1/2 cup of butter but I added a 4oz of applesauce to make up for the rest of the butter.  The rest was according to the recipe.  Turned out to be very good.

Loved this.  It was so simple to make when I get home from work, and it is so yummy.  Even my picky 7 year old (who normally wouldn't TOUCH oatmeal) loves it.  Excellent recipe!!

Omg, INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!!!!! & SO easy to make!! 
I added chopped salted almonds, a little vanilla unsweetened almond milk to the chocolate mixture...used dark chocolate chips rather then semi-sweet & used a combo of organic coconut oil & I can't believe it's not butter. Oh & used steel-cut oats- that's all I had on hand.

I tried to follow reviews about decreasing the butter by 1/4 cup and it didn't seem to work to well for me. The oatmeal ended up pretty crumbly and didn't stick together to make bars.  The filling was okay.  I liked the flavor, but it probably needs doubled to make it a hearty bar that is worth eating.  I think I will pass this one up in the future and go with a different recipe.

Neither my hubs or I cared for these. I like most dessert bars made with oats (my husband doesn't because most include fruit and he HATES fruit!!!), but I guess I don't care for UNCOOKED oats. Baking is key, IMHO. Having said this, I made a tiny error that might have *slightly* swayed my rating.... I mistakenly used a 1/2 c. of butter instead of the 1 c. called for (oops...). Some reviews recommend cutting the butter by half, but THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA! I couldn't figure out why my oat mixture was crumbly and now I know why. :o) I'd like to make these again using the CORRECT amount of butter, DOUBLING the chocolate / PB layer (there wasn't enough of it compared to everything else) and cutting back on the final layer, making a thicker crust to compensate. I'm not sure these changes will positively impact my rating, but I'm willing to give them a try. :) Maybe this will work for you, but it didn't do much for me. Thanks anyways, Traci!

add more oats to balance out all of the margarine. Can use a mixture of rolled oats and quick oats.

Delicious and easy. I did read reviews and only used 3/4 cup butter. I also think it could use more PB, because there's not a strong flavor-if you like it! :) 

I think that more butter would perhaps hold the granola topping on better, but it's not too crumbly and worth saving the calories to keep it off!

Easy AND DELISH !!!!   Gonna use honey & less sugar next time to see if I get the same taste.  Anything to lessen my sugar intake but still have a killer bar taste is worth a try.

Thanks for this recipe !!   :)

AMAZING. next time I'll make it not soo sweet...I only put a hint of peanut butter since I'm not a big fan and it was soo good. the tiny bit of peanut butter gave the desert a pleasant surprise.  first you tasted chocolate then the hint of peanut then chocolate again. YUM. Everyone loved it.

These are delicious! My husband said they were his favorite dessert I have ever made. Very quick and easy, and a nice thing to make ahead and stick in the fridge over night. Very chocolatey but not too sweet. I followed other reviewers and only reserved 1/3 for the topping. I also stuck the bottom layer in the oven for about 10 minutes just to get it a little firmer.  Will make again for sure!

Loved this! I've been trying to eat healthier, so I halved the butter. This made the bars a little more crumbly, but they still had a wonderful taste - chocolatey, with a little hint of peanut butter.

I was looking for a peanut butter and chocolate recipe and was recommended these. I cut the recipe in half to try it out as I do most recipes. I followed the recipe except I used whipped butter to cut the fat in half and natural creamy peanut butter. I didn't have a pan half the size of a 9x9 pan and just put them in a mini muffin pan sprayed with pan spray. I did have a little trouble removing them, but once the bottom of the pan got warm enough they popped out. I thought they tasted like a granola with a chocolate and peanut butter layer. The granola however was just "too sweet" for me. I put the chocolate and peanut butter in the microwave for 1 minute and it mixed easily. I plan to use that, in other recipes, because the taste of that part of the bar though was good.

Loooove these! They turned out wonderful.  I did go ahead and increase the peanut butter to a full cup, and added some extra chocolate chips because all I had was a 9x13 pan.  Also, I just like lots of chocolate and peanut butter.  These remind me a lot of preacher cookies.  Delicious!  Can't wait to share with my friends.

I'd say 3.5, i didnt have a 9x9 so i put it in a pie pan (closet thing to it) but i dont think that that would change the flavor. They were kind of plain and the chocolate texture was really thick which would be good if the crust had more flavor. they werent bad though i might make them again

I was very excited to try these out but the end result was disappointing. They tasted mostly like butter. I will try them again but try tweaking the recipe with less butter.

Very tasty and decadent.  I doubled the recipe (as another reviewer recommended).  A little piece packs a big punch!

These bars taste terriffic - however - I made this recipe 3 times and couldn't keep the oatmeal mixture from crumbling and falling apart.  I believe I've followed the instructions to the letter - Can anyone help - what am I doing wrong?  I'd love to make these again because they taste so good but I don't want to have to serve them with a fork...

Absolutely delicious! My girlfriends couldn't get enough!!  I also used 1 stick of butter which was perfect. I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter. Next time I will use 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 3/4 cup almond butter.

I think I'm in love.  I cut back a bit on the butter as suggested by others. I also used natural peanut butter and they're still fabulous!  These are not going to last long.....

Incredibly rich!! Cut them tiny! They taste just like a no bake cookie but even richer, IMO. Super easy-from start to finish(minus refrigeration time) was 15 min.!

I love peanut butter & chocolate so I was very excited to try this recipe that had so many great reviews. I did follow another's suggestion to drip some of the chocolate on top of the bars to make it look more interesting and I'm glad that I did.  But even still, overall I was very disappointed! It was TOO basic in flavor & texture. I would make again, but not without adding some nuts & such to the oatmeal mixture.  I also would perhaps add more peanut butter so that flavor is not lost. The final result was ok - just ok. Not the 5 star recipe I was hoping for.

We loved them!  They taste good, they aren't enormously unhealthy, and there aren't a million ingredients!  I used the whole cup of butter and just gave the oatmeal some extra time heating to help absorb it, and I think it did keep the dough from falling apart.  Next time I'm adding chopped pecans to the oat mix!

These bars were definitely quick and easy.  I did reduce the amount of butter to 3/4 cup and it turned out fine.  The taste was just okay in my book.  I can imagine that kids would love them but they are a bit crumbly.  I probably won't make these again because there are too many better recipes out there.

These were awesome and I got rave reviews!  I did double the recipe for a 9x13 pan and only used 3/4 C butter like others suggested.  I had no problems with them holding either.

loved it! they were so good and EASY! mine were a bit thinner than the recipe because i used a cookie sheet but i think theyre better that way, just a little harder to make. the only complaint that i could think of is that, i do wish the oatmeal was crispy. but its still really good. 5 stars!!

These are quite delicious, and very easy to make! I found them to be a little too sweet and chocolaty - Next time I will add about an extra cup of oats and half the amount of chocolate filling.

I made the following changes: I used 130 g butter, and added 5 Tbsp milk to compensate for the loss of liquid. I also reduced the (dark) chocolate chips so that I had only 3/4 c chips because the pictures seemed to have a big layer of chocolate! I did cook the oats a little longer but that just depends.
EXCELLENT =)

These are amazingly easy and absolutely delicious.  They take no time at all to prepare.  I used 1/2 a stick of butter and had I would say over half the oats just fell off the bars when it came time to cut them.  I will make these again but I will follow the recipe and use the full amount of butter!

After reading the reviews, I decided to reduce the butter to 3/4 cup and I increased the PB (not sure how much though). This was great! A small portion went a long way.

These were ok but not great according to my family. Even though I cut back the butter, as other reviewers suggested, they were still too greasy. My 4 star rating was an average - 5 stars for ease of making and 3 stars for taste. I will stick with my fave no-bake chocolate oatmeal bars.

These are good, but it seems like all I taste in the oatmeal mixture is butter, and without the full amount of butter, the mixture crumbles too much.   I wish there was a way to keep the oatmeal together without so much butter.

Really good and really easy. I did add a little more peanut butter and chocolate chips to make more filling. It was even better the next day.

Awesome!  My husband fell in love and ate the entire pan (except for the portion I couldn't resist).  The filling is delicious!  I think next time I will try using 3/4c butter as suggested by other reviewers

Hmm, this was an instant favorite with all my friends. However, personally i found that the overall thing was a little too greasy and the oil taste is overwhelming. There was nothing special about the peanut butter bars.

Made these for a friend who'd just had a baby.  Of course I kept back some to try.  These were great!  Similar to Scotcharoos, but maybe the oatmeal makes them healthier!

I sent this recipe to my sister in law to see if it was the same one she'd made for us so many times...it wasn't and this one was SOO yummy!  Definitely recommend serving it from the fridge.

I followed this recipe exactly and thought it was a little too sweet and slightly greasy.  Otherwise it was a quick and easy recipe for those with a super sweet tooth.

I made this and it tasted good, but it crumbled so badly that I had to serve it as an ice cream topping. I don't like to give out bad ratings, but there you go.

In my opinion, you can never go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter. I should have read more reviews because I ended up with puddles of butter... Still very delicious. Because I used regular oats, I cooked them for a little longer than the recipe says on low heat to soften. I will be making these again with less butter and possibly trying suggestions like nuts, graham cracker crumbs, or rice krispies. These would be excellent with a caramel sauce layer or on top! Mmmm!

These are really good.  I had decreased the butter to 3/4 cup because of other reviewers suggestions BUT I thought the top was too crumbly.  So next time I will make it with the suggested 1 cup butter.  Has a great taste though!!

I thought these were good, but for some reason they just didnt knock my socks off.  I felt like they were missing something.  If I make them again, I might try a 1/4 t cinnamon in the oat mixture and maybe a pinch of salt.  I will admit they are easy as can be and have a very appetizing look to them. Edit: made them again with 1/4 t salt added to the oat mixture.  Thats what they needed!

These are delicious! However, one word of caution: they are extremely intense. They should be cut in tiny pieces, much smaller than your average brownie. I served them cold with no problems, but the following day at room temperature the oats were terribly messy.

These are super rich, as everyone already says.  I brought a batch to a BBQ and the disappeared pretty quickly.  That having been said, I would use a little less butter next time.  I did not have a problem with the bottom crumbling at all, but I did find the texture a bit greasy. But, overall, I a really easy, delicious recipe; Take 2 - I did a few things to make these a bit more healthy, but they are just as good.  1) I cut the butter in half and used only 1/2 C. 2) Because I reduced the butter I only used 2.5 C of oats instead of the full 3 it calls for. 3) I added a couple of tbs peanut butter to the oat mixture (because I reduced the butter so much I felt like it need a little extra liquid to help with the binding). 4) I reduced the choc chips to about 1/2 C, but added 1/2 C rice krispies to the melted choc/PB mixture - to beef it up while adding no more fat and only a few calories. 5) I mixed a few choc. chip and rice krispies into the reserved oat mixture before I sprinkled it over the top.  Make sure you press down hard and really pack it in there or it will get crumbly.  I froze it for a 1/2 hour, took it out and used some wax paper to really help press the mixture down then put back in the freezer.  While frozen I cut into 1 inch cubes (to keep me from eating to much at once!).

These are great especially since they are so quick and easy to throw together. Not having to turn on the oven on a hot summer day is definately a plus. I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the butter to 3/4 cup and put a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I also saved a little of the chocolate mix to drizzle on top it definately perked up the look of the bar. Can't wait to bust them out at our potluck tonight. Thanks for a great recipe. Update: The taste was great but these are really rich. I ate a small piece and didn't feel so good after. The kids loved them though.

we did the less butter/more peanut butter approach - pretty deliscious.  Very rich.  Make sure you really press the oat mixture down - otherwise ours got crumbly!

Made these for a get-together.  Got lots of good reviews from others and hubby.  I thought they were okay.  They do taste like no-bakes, but something is missing, maybe needs more peanut butter taste.  I even added a chocolate/peanut butter drizzle over the top.  This helped, but it would have been really plain without it.

Delicious!  The only complaint I have is that the oat crumbs are very crumbly.  I think about 1/2 cup of oatmeal fell off while cutting and plating the bars.  Definitely a sweet treat.  Cut the bars small. They go quickly!

As written these bars are just okay - take the advice of previous reviews and cut the butter to 3/4 cup.  My family thought that the peanut butter flavor was a bit overwhelming. So my final recipe include using rolled oats not the quick kind, 3/4 c butter, 1/2 c raisins & 1/2 tsp cinnamon in with the oats, 1 1/4 c choc chips, 1/4 c peanut butter.

This is a favorite of my family! I tried it first the way it was written but I ended up making changes the next time. I use 1 stick salted and one sweet. I also use a whole bag of chips. I saveD some chocolate aside to drizzle ontop.I had to cook the oatmeal longer than it said. Let's see... That's it! I make this all the time and people always ask for the recipe!

I just made these today! They only took about 15 minutes of work. The hard part is waiting for them to cool! I followed the recipe exactly (except I left out most of the vanilla because I don't like it) and I thought it was great! This was such an easy treat, great for get togethers or an easy dessert! This is a new favorite!

Delicious with 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 c applesauce with oats.  I also added a splash of vanilla to the chocolate and peanut butter mixture. I also used a 13x9 in pan.  The amount of oat mix and chocolate still worked just thinner.

Quick, easy, and perfect tasting!  Like many others, I also cut down on the butter a bit, using about 3/4 c.  I do think they're much better after they've set overnight as opposed to just a couple of hours.

I dont think this should get 5 stars just because it only takes 10 minutes to make. These were not good, they tasted ok when they are just made. I will not eat these ever again.

I made this exactly as written and it is delicious (and very quick and easy).  My only complaint is that they don't keep very well (mine got a little soggy).

I couldn't believe how impressed people were by such a simple recipe. I increased the oat/butter/etc topping/crust portions to allow for a thicker crust and topping.

I followed others suggestion of cutting back on the butter and I'm glad that I did.  This is a very quick and easy recipe that the kids will love.  I also cooked the oats longer than stated (adding a smidgeon of water) so that they had the right texture, I used the Splenda brown sugar which worked just fine.  Ido wish that I had added additional peanut butter as there was just a hint of PB in the taste. I will make again, using 3/4 cup butter, at least double the PB called for, and cooking the oats for at least 5 minutes if not longer.

I was really looking forward to these and loved that it was a simple recipe however I ended up quite disappointed. The taste was just bland to me and for whatever reason the chocolate & peanut butter just didn't taste right (I used 3/4 pb). I also had the same issue as others with the oats falling off. I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of butter but it wasn't enough to moisten all of the oats. Once the bars cooled, I ended up scraping off the majority of the oats. I could live with the oats issue but the taste just didn't do it for me.

These are good. There's not really anything wrong with them, but they aren't really that spectacular in my opinion. Chocolate, peanut butter, and oatmeal. I'll eat them all but don't know that I will make them again. Also, for sprinkling the top layer on--don't forget that you just had it on the stove and it's still really hot. Sticking your hand in and grabbing and handful is not really the most comfortable thing to do, so use a spoon! I did not bring to room temp before cutting, not sure why you would need to. UPDATE: OK, so I let them come to room temp mostly to see how they would taste to people I might ship them to. Much better! I can't quite put my finger on it, but if you eat them cold they are not really special. Room temp, they have the right chewy gooey texture that blends much better.

Very quick, easy dessert. I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan, & took the tips of using 1/2 c. less butter. I'm glad I did b/c the crust would have been far too greasy with more butter. I also made a thicker crust so only 1/3 of the oat mix went on top. Just thought it looked prettier to seem some of the chocolate.

These were just okay. There was WAY too much butter - and I even took the advice of other reviewers and only used 3/4 cup. I tried adding more oats to soak it up and still had a pool of butter in the bowl. Once I put the first layer in the pan, I blotted it with a paper towel that ended up soaked in butter. The finished product was pretty bland. I probably won't make this again.

I cut back the butter to 1/2 cup, and added an egg to the butter/sugar mixture. Make sure its not too hot when you do this, and stir constantly until blended.  Then turn up the heat and let it bubble a bit while stirring to be sure the egg is cooked.  Then I added the oats, and cooked them a bit to soften them. I think it was a great modification, although I never tried the original...  I did feel that it held together very nicely.  These will be an important new cooky for me during the next few months, my oven is broken, so I'm going to remodel!

I love these.  I've made them a few different times and while it's yummy as written it's VERY buttery.  I also love using rolled oats in it, I haven't tried it with instant.  Now I half the amount of butter and let the butter/sugar mixture boil for 2 min before adding the vanilla and oats, it sticks together wonderfully and still tastes yummy.  I also don't scrape every last bit of chocolate into the pan I save the last bit in the bowl and scrape that into a baggie so I can cut the corner and make pretty squiggles on the top of the bars, always makes it look like this 15 min dish took forever.

These are definitely worth making if you have a peanut butter lover around. I did use a little less butter and more peanut butter as other reviewers suggested. Even so I thought they tasted a little too buttery for me, but my husband and sons loved them. Will definitely make again, but might try even a little less butter.

5 for taste, 4 for texture. The oatmeal has that "no bake" texture. But really, is there anything better than chocolate and pb?

These were super quick and easy to put together and it came out okay. But for some reason I didn't like this recipe as much as I thought I would. The top part of the oats do fall off more than I would have liked, probably because not all of it could get stuck to the chocolate/peanut butter mixture. I followed the recipe exactly and they were okay, but it's not something I'd make too often.

There were good. I especially like the no bake part. Sometimes with 3 kids 3 and under I just don't have time to bake. I took a pan of these to work and had several people ask for the recipe. I did have trouble with the oatmeal part being crumbly but people like them anyway.

These were very yummy, but simple.  I let the chocolate cool on the first layer so I had a better top coating (meaning it wasn't as crumbly as other reviewers mentioned).  Next time I make these I will make half of the oat mixture and wait until the chocolate is semi-firm to make the second half of the mixture.

I didn't have quite 3 cups of oats so I cut the butter down. I was going to do 3/4 cup, but then decided to go with 1/2 cup. Next time I'll try it with a bit more butter as it's a bit crumbly. I thought there'd be too much chocolate/peanut butter filling as it seemed like a lot for a small pan, but it tasted just right.

I made these bars using other users recommendations and also a small alteration of my own.  I used 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of peanut butter and since I only had 2 cups of oats I used 1 cup of finely chopped pecans.  These bars were so good that they literally disappeared!I think next time I will make sure to pat the crust down more though to prevent them from crumbling and I'll use less peanut butter because they never really hardened.  Overall awesome though and I will make again!

These are so easy to put together. I did cut back a little on the butter using 1 1/2 sticks instead of 2 and I used sugar free chocolate chips and the splenda brown sugar blend, my husband and I both enjoyed them.

Deee-licious! Quick and easy. If you cook the oatmeal for a few minutes the butter is absorbed. I left it on low with a cover for 5 minutes. They were gobbled up in less than an hour. My coffee group loved them. I sitting at my computer making recipe copies for my friends.

These were ok. I didn't really like the texture of the oats since they weren't baked. I even cooked it for a little longer on the stove than called for. I like the baked oat bar recipes better. Thanks for sharing though!

These were really good!  I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers and cut the butter to 3/4, and increased peanut butter to 3/4.  I didn't have quick cook oats so I just let the mixture cook for a while longer and it worked fine.  Also, I put it in the freezer instead of the fridge so it would set up sooner!  It was firm enough to cut in about an hour and a half.

This was a nice variation on a really similar no bake recipe I grew up with and it's equally as good.  I used a 9x13 and reduced the oats to 2 cups and the butter to 3/4 of a stick and put the mixture all on the bottom rather than crumbling.  It all turned out very well but the oatmeal mixture was kind of crumbly on the bottom and could have offered more flavor to the mix, though I did change the original a lot. Overall easy and tasty.

These were very rich!! I think next time I would rather these bars be thinner so I will make in a larger pan. Easy to throw together. Make sure you have milk on hand, you will need a big glass!!

YUM!!!!  Decreased the butter a tad (to 3/4c, I believe) and increased the peanut butter a tad (also to 3/4c, I believe).  Sooooo good!!!  I'd love to try using chunky PB next time!

my son is allegic to milk and eggs so he really enjoyed making these and eating them too. We substitued earth balance for the butter... and it cut back on half the fat and calories butter would give you. Still very yummy and it packs protien and fiber.

Very addictive and delicious!  Easy to make, most ingredients are already on hand.  My daughters and co-workers love it!  The last time I cut the butter down to 1 1/2 cups and it was delicious!

Outstanding just as written, but I have substituted honey for 1/2 the brown sugar and they still came out great. Substituting old fashioned oats for the quick oats works but not as well as the quick oats. Even decreasing the butter by half doesn't ruin them but they don't have such a rich yummy taste if you do that. Everyone to whom I have served these, loves them. They are quick and easy to make. A recipe I'll make often!

I reduced the butter to 3/4 cups. It still seemed greasy, but it didn't bother me.  Tastes good, but too crumbly- maybe the full butter that the recipe calls for would help with that.

I halved this recipe and used slightly less butter than written. I used half almond, half peanut better. I didn't have chocolate, but I'm not a huuuge chocolate fan, so I really enjoyed this. While toasting the oats, I added a bit of milk to soften them up so they wouldn't crumble on the topping. I added a thick bottom layer of oat, added the peanut butter mix, then added the rest, pressing the oats in pretty firmly. I sprinkled a bit of cane sugar over the top for looks. This is very easy and very good. Next time, I'm going to try and add some cranerries. :)

I found this recipe because I was craving a PB/chocolate combo, but wanted something relatively simple in terms of number of ingredients and ease of making.  This was soooo easy!! And very very yummy!  I rated 4 out of 5 b/c although I cut down on the butter to cut out some of the fat, it was still pretty greasy.  I will make these again when I need a quick treat.  I might try adding more PB though, just b/c I LOVE it! Oh, I also used 1 cup of old fashioned oats b/c I wasn't reading carefully, and I didn't notice a difference.  You may need to cook the oats longer than the recommended time if you do this though.

these are highly addictive. My children are not big fans of oatmeal and I had hoped that this recipe would make them change their minds. It didn't but I enjoyed them tremendously. They lost their crunch after day 2 so keep this in mind if cooking ahead of time.

I made these for the holidays.  They were delicious.  I don't know if I did something wrong with the bottom layer of oatmeal mixture, though, because most of it didn't "firm up" and stayed in the pan after I cut them up.  Not a huge deal because my husband and son ate what was left in the pan.  :)

Quick, easy and it looks really impressive. However, the oats were too moist from the butter and they did not taste like they were cooked enough. The chocolate and peanut butter combo was really good, maybe I'll try it again and cook the oats more.

These are great! I had to use a slightly larger pan because that was what I had available which led to thin layers, but still soo good!  I am already plotting out when I can make these again!

Very good, very rich.  I added more chocolate chips and more peanut butter.  The most difficult part was getting htem out of the pan.  The oat layer was very crumbly and half of it stayed in the pan when I was trying to get it out.  Otherwise, they seemed to be a big hit.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good, quick bar recipe.  I followed advice and used 3/4 c. butter only and slightly more peanut butter than called for.  Definitely didn't need the extra butter.

OMG, these are fantastic!  I also cut down the butterto 3/4 cup.  I may try less next time.  I may even cut down a little on the sugar and see how that pans out.  These are so quck and easy!  Love them, thanks!

When I need a delicious chocolatey oatmealy fix--this is where I go. Super easy and super quick, this recipe is amazingly delicious! It's so simply but I can barely refrain myself from eating the whole thing--thus I only make it occasionally, even if I want it all the time!

Quick. Easy. Delicious.  I cut butter down to 2/3 cup.  Also heaping 1/2 cup peanut butter.  Turned out great.  I made them 2 times already this week.  Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was just okay.  I would probably make more of the oat mixture if I ever do it again so that it could be a thicker crust and the top could be totally covered.

These were amazing! I decreased the butter to 3/4 C. and they turned out perfectly. I took them to a family get together and returned home with not even one crumb in the pan! And what's best is that they didn't heat up the kitchen since they don't have to bake. This is definitely a keeper!

YUM!  I just made these using 3/4 cup of margarine and I always use milk chocolate chips.  I think these are pretty good.  I used a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter but I wish I wouldn't have just used normal 1/2 cup because I was looking for more of a chocolate taste but I really could taste the peanut butter, either way these were still awesome!

This recipe was prretty good! I didnt really follow the directions though. I used 1 whole cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup. I also only cooked the oat mixture for about one min. But the whole thing was fantastic once refridged. Next time I probably will only use 1/2 cup peanut butter!!!!

I cut the butter to 3/4 c and incresed the peanut butter to 3/4 c. as suggested by others.  The rest I followed exactly.  These are a great warm weather treat.  I will decrease the butter a little more the next time.  I can't wait to try some of the other suggestions for this cookie.

Oh man these were soooo good! I could probably eat the whole pan myself...but I'll try to restrain myself. I was looking for something to make without using the oven becauce its been so hot here. These were perfect! I used half semi sweet chocolate chips and half milk chocolate chips. I'll be making these all the time now!

These were very good, I took advice from another and used 2/3 C margarine and 1/2 C b sugar for the base, I only had 2 C of the oats so I used all of that for the base.  I used semi and milk choc. chips with the peanut butter for the filling and added a layer of cheerios pressed onto the top.  My daughter turned her nose up at it when she saw the cheerios, but she had a bar of this in her hand on her way out the door this morning!  I will try these again but I will use the oats/b sugar for the topping.

I loved these.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet.  Just my personal preference.  SO yummy!

Utterly fabulous! I love chocolate, peanut butter and oats, so these bars were a dream come true. I cut the margarine to 2/3 of a cup and added a bit more peanut butter. For a 9x13 I did 1.5 times the recipe and it was perfect. Thanks for a real winner.

Also made butter & peanut butter 3/4c.  Used aluminum foil to line pan - no greasing and no dirty pan.  Milk chocolate would have been better, the semi-sweet doesn't taste as good with peanut butter.

Very Very Good!  I made these bars two times now.  The first time semi-sweet chips were used and the second all I had were milk chocolate.  I much prefer the taste of the semi-sweet morsels in these yummy bars.  Make sure you take copies of the recipe with you if you!  I have had the requested for parties and had to write this out for people several times now.

These bars were pretty good but I did find the oatmeal mixture alittle on the buttery side.  If I ever make them again I will cut the butter down to 1/2 cup.

5 for simplicity, 3 for taste.  These were okay, but they tasted just like the "no-bake cookies" we made in home ec (years ago :).

I cut the butter to 3/4 cup, added a splash of milk, and cooked for the 5 minutes, as others suggested.  We keep them in the fridge and they hold together just fine (minor crumbling).  I had these at a take out restaurant in Boston several years ago and have been waiting for the recipe to show up on Allrecipes -- was so pleased it finally did.  Kids and husband love them -- not too sweet, in our opinion.  We also tried these a second time with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and they were even better!

These were okay.  The oatmeal layers are pretty greasy, but they are tasty, and they're certainly easy.  To me they tasted more like a fudge bar than a cookie.

Great idea.  I love peanut butter but didn't think it fit.  I was actually trying to create the oat bars that are at whole Foods.  I took others advice and reduced amount of butter to a little over 1/2 cup and omitted peanut butter completely.  Still very rich and so good!

I would stick with regular no-bake cookies.  This recipe was alright but wasn't as moist as no-bakes (which isn't alot but better than this).  The flavor was there but it wasn't a standout with my family.....maybe we are just true cookie people :)

So easy and delicious! I mixed some cereal that was about to go stale (Kashi and Cheerios) with the oats and it came out great.  I also used a little less butter.

Very easy to make and delicious. Everyone loved them - they are a little rich but good. I think the oatmeal butter mix needs to be just right so it wont turn out greasy like some reviewers stated. I waited 3-4 minutes until it looked a little dry before pressing it in the pan. I refrigerated the bars for 3 hours and they held together perfectly.

These were definantly an easy no bake. The taste was ok....but not too thrilled with the "crumbliness" of the oat's. The husband came up with a sure fired way to eat them without leaving a trail for the dog..use a bowl & spoon!

These were not my favorite.  Just ok-too sweet and the oats were too raw tasting for us.  Most of it wasn't eaten-not usual for sweets in our house!  It definitely gets points for being easy though but I probably won't make this again.

Don't let the "too rich" reviews deter you! These are very good. They are rich so a 9x9 pan will go far, perfect for a single bite serving!
 They really do need to be kept cold as they will get a tad messy if it's warm outside.
 Also, I put my oats in a blender or food processor to make a very coarse flour out of it. It makes them blend and cook a little better.

Definitely cut back on the butter by 1/4 c as suggested by others.  I used milk chocolate chips instead because I prefer the flavor, and these were great! I ate the whole pan myself the first time I made them.  For a variation, try peanut butter chips, then sprinkle with milk chocolate chips before you add the top layer of oats. Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy.  These were very good.  I did use less butter, my crust did crumble upon cutting.  I did not save any oat mixture for the top and put it all in 9 x 13 pan.

This recipe is so speedy-you can whip it up in just a few minutes! I've made them twice now for the office and each time they're gobbled up in no time! Make sure you combine the oatmeal mixture well so it holds together good for you. Press into the pan firmly-chilling sets them up perfectly.

Good, but very rich. I like sweets, but this was even a little too sweet for me. I used less brown sugar and butter than was called for & kept refrigerated. They didn't crumble that way, epsecially in the summer heat.

Although they turned out excellent, I didn't have enough oat mixture to make two layers in a 9x9 pan. Simple enough to make some more though. Quick, easy as anything, and tasted great. Thanks!

I love this recipe!  It was soo easy!  I was worried b/c one too many times recipes call for spreading out half a mix and it's never enough...this one worked for me.  To dress it up a little I saved some of the chocolate PB mix to drizzle over the top.  This is such a good basic recipe I want to try it different ways..I'm thinking white chocolate and cranberries, or double PB...

These were really good.  I'd give it 5 stars except that I did make some modifications.  Used 3/4 cups butter, mixed the peanut butter in after had cooked the oat for 2 mins and then stirred in the chocolate chips once the mixture had cooled quite a bit.  Tasted just like the quaker chocolate chip bars and easier for travelling this way than the chocolate peanut butter layer in the middle that would melt easier.  Didn't crumble.  Would probably use less sugar (1/3 cup)or add less chocolate chips next time as it was a tad too sweet.

These turned out well, but I felt like there was something missing. I followed the recipe exactly, but it was still missing a little kick. But the did turn out well, held their shape nicely, and were very easy to make.

These don't stay together.  They taste okay but they are nothing special.  I thought my husband would love the chocolate peanut butter combo, but even he said, "They're fine."  I'm not impressed

They were really good. I made them for my son's baptism celebration. They were all gone when it was over so they definitely went over well.

These weren't spectacular, but they were good and very quick and easy.  The kids loved them.    Next time I may use a bit less brown sugar, since although I have a huge sweet tooth, I felt the brown sugar taste competed a bit too much with the peanut butter and chocolate.  I used the full amount of butter and had no problems with it being greasy.  Thanks!

I used half bittersweet and half milk chocolate chips, and 3/4 cup of butter instead of the 1 cup. As suggested by other reviewers. How easy this recipe is! But tasted wonderful! My family loved it and it is definatley a keeper. My kids can even make this! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

With my changes this recipe was awesome.  I would definitely cut back on the butter, and instead of the chocolate chips and peanut butter, I used a bag of mini reeses peanut butter cups.  It was a pain to unwrap but it added a little sweetness to the chocolate mixture.

These are great!  Only thing I did different was that I  sprinkled some coconut over the choclate layer.  Next time I will probably leave out the peanut butter as I am not a big fan of it.  Thanks for sharing!

great recipe--even geat to eat frozen! 
i agree; you don't have to use a full cup of butter. i also made individual pieces by making the layers in a muffin tin and added a drizzle of the chocolate mixture on top for an added "wow."

I was eager to try the recipe because they looked so good and I had hoped they would be similar to No-Bake Cookies. It was similar but I thought the crust/topping needed a little more zing. I did add some salt but it was still a little too buttery for my taste. That being said they did get eaten. I think I might do half butter, half peanut butter instead of full butter in the crust.

These were delicious and a huge hit with my family.  However, next time I'll reduce the butter to 3/4 c. (I forgot to do that as was stated in previous reviews).

These are so easy to make.  I think you could use a little less butter and they would still hold together fine.  I also added granola to the oatmeal mixture.  I liked the extra crunch.  I will definitely make these again.

Used 3/4 cup butter, 1 cup peanut butter (our family loves peanut butter) and added some shredded coconut to the oatmeal mix.  Pretty tasty for the time it took to make (about 10 minutes).  Makes a lot of bars.

These tasted great, but I reduced the butter to 3/4 cup as posted in other reviews, and the oatmeal did not stick together well.  I'll try them again, but use the 1 cup of butter to see if they don't crumble as much.  My family preferred these straight from the fridge.  They were a little soft and messy at room temperature.

I reduced the amount of butter - don't!  It was delicious, but didn't stick together too well.  I think I may reduce the amount of peanut butter next time so that you mostly taste the chocolate.  But it's a great, easy recipe.

I hate to be the one to end the chain of high praises for this recipe, but I would not "rave" about this one.  The consistency of the oatmeal is not pleasant while eating.  Although quick and convenient, I would find a better recipe elsewhere!

This recipe was so easy to make. I didnt even have to go shopping. I had everything in the cupboard. 
I made this on Fathers Day and I received many comments. The kids burned it up!! It's a great base recipe. Alot can be done with this recipe, I cant wait to fiddle daddle with it. 
Thank you for sharing

I liked it, but I agree with others...too much butter. Next time I'll try the suggestion to add graham      er crumbs and rice crispies.

I thought these were absolutely delicious. I did everything as directed and they turned out perfect. I love the buttery flavor of the oat mixture and they were an awesome texture. We gobbled up the whole pan of them between four of us, and I was still hoping for more afterward. I didn't have a 9x9 in. pan, and I used an 8x8, but I didn't know that they made a 9x9. Anyway they were great.

Overall, O.K.  Husband wished the oatmeal mixture would have held together better.  I would have liked to taste more of the peanut butter.  We each had 1 serving and probably will not finish.

once again...that wonderfully delectable combination of peanut butter and chocolate! i actually feel a bit more healthy eating these what with all the oatmeal. these are simply fantastic and very easy to put together. like so many others i reduced the butter. i used regular oats (thats what i had on hand) and just made sure they cooked in the butter a bit longer. yum!

I used 1/2 cup margarine, 1/2 cup milk, and put all of the oats in one layer then chocolate on top.  These were so fast and really delicious.  I'll definitely be making them again.

These are quite nice, I did make a couple changes, cut back margarine to 3/4 cup as advised by others, I also only used 3/4 cup of Choc chips but also used 1/4 c of peanut butter chips mmmmm yummy. But I did find that oatmeal mixture really isn't enough to cover both bottom and top I like my crust on squares a bit thicker, so next time will double the crust recipe. I also add a bit of coconut to the remaining oatmeal mixture and put it on the top only.  How anyone gets 32 squares out of 9x9 pan beats me. Next time I am going to try adding nuts to the top half of the mixture only. But for a quick chocolate fix this is nice

A very yummy bar recipe! They were done in 15 min. I did cook the oat mixture for 6 min. to rid of the 'uncooked' taste. I added a 1/4 t. of salt. I didn't find these bars to greasy at all. Also right before I added the oat topping I crumbled 2 butterfingers on top of the chocolate. WOW!

I was so disappointed by these! I had really high hopes with all the good reviews too.

2 stars because, Yes, they are really easy and you probably already have the necessary ingredients in your pantry. BUT...they are bland. Very bland. I also cut the butter to 3/4 cup as per many of the reviews, but I would NOT do that again. My oats are a little too hard even though I cooked them the full 3min...there was not enough liquid to be absorbed w/only 3/4 cups of butter.

Bummer!

I brought this to work for a birthday party, and they were a HIT! I've already had several people asking for the recipe. I cut the butter down to 3/4 cup as well, but I'd even go with less next time becuase they were a little greasy. I used reduced fat Jif peanut butter, and that helped. I also cooked my oat mixture for about 5 minutes instead of the suggested 2-3 becuase they were not blended well after 2 minutes. Thanks for a great (and EASY!) recipe!

i dont think theyre *phenomenal* per se, but theyre okay, i guess. i think i might have used the wrong chocolate or made them too thin, but im not dying to have them 24/7. i would rate it a 3.5, but... i guess that rounds up to 4 stars.

Absolutely yummy!  I often use my co-workers as guinea pigs and they loved it!  I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!® instead of the real stuff and it was still very rich.  The next time I make this, I'll cut down as others have suggested.

I took other reviewers' advice and cut back about 4 Tbsp. on the butter and it was still very buttery tasting, but the oatmeal stayed too hard....maybe if you substitute some milk in place of the butter it would give the oatmeal the moisture it needs to soften up, and wouldn't taste so buttery in the end.  The bars tasted good, but not great.  However, they are very quick and easy.  But I think I'll stick to my no-bake drop cookies I usually make.
