Excellent, but this recipe can be made even easier.  (For other reviewers who are browning the meat - there's really no need. Since it's shredded, browning the meat doesn't add much to the flavor or color.)  I just put the pork in, even without salting it sometimes, then pour about 2/3 to a full bottle of BBQ sauce on top and cook on low for 6-8 hrs. or high for 4-5 hrs.  Adding the beef broth just makes it soupy and the pork gives off a lot of juice while cooking anyway. BBQ sauce alone can tenderize the pork perfectly.  And I tried with and without coffee and it made no difference in flavor or tenderness - so don't bother.  When pork is done, I shred the pork, add the remaining BBQ sauce or how ever much you want and let it sit in the crock pot on high for another 30-1hr to heat through.  I like Stubbs Original BBQ sauce (a little spicy) or Stubbs Mesquite BBQ sauce (thick & sweet) or mix 1/2 and 1/2 of each. Eat with warm Kaiser buns and you're in heaven.  So easy to make but taste like a lot of work.  Awesome dish!  Finish off with a slice of Coconut Sour Cream Cake (from this website) and you're transported to Southern Heaven.

This pork turned out soo tender and moist!  I used a 9 pound bone-in pork shoulder and trimmed it down to fit into my crock pot.  I added a can of beef broth (left out the coffee b/c the roast will give off a lot of natural juices) and some salt and pepper and put the lid on it and let it do its thing in the pot for 8 hours.  The next morning my apartment smelled awesome and I shredded it and had the pulled pork all ready for Sunday dinner!  Come sunday, I put the meat back in the crock pot with a bottle of Baby's Ray's and let my guests dish out their own sandwiches.  My advice to someone who wants to do Pulled pork, use the shoulder or butt portion roast.  I wouldn't waste a cut like tenderloin on some thing like this.  The long, slow cooking toughens a cut like tenderloin, whereas a cut like the shoulder has lots of connective tissue and fat thatt softens as its cooked.  Save the tenderloin for shorter cooking times.  This is a really easy recipe to follow and turns out really well.

I made this tonight and my husband just about died - he loved this so much! He says it is the best pulled pork sandwich he has ever had!  He also said this was the best thing I ever cooked (and I am a fairly good cook). I agree - it is really good! We usually drive 40 minutes to a restaurant in Maine so he can get a pulled pork sandwich. We are going to save money and a lot on gas now! I made a smaller roast because my crock pot is small, so I cut the recipe in half. (Our 2.5 lb. roast made about 5 good-sized sandwiches.) I used Hunt's BBQ "Hickory" sauce and it was perfect (not too sweet and slightly smokey). I added a small amount to the shredded pork and then we added extra on our sandwiches as needed. I served the shredded pork on toasted kaiser rolls. Really good!

Outstanding, Sarge!!!  I was leary because I've never made pulled pork before, but this was soooooo easy to complete and the flavor was just incredible with my homemade BBQ sauce.  I made a small tweak by adding 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the broth.  Started it at midnight in a slow cooker on Low and went to bed.

I wasn't sure what to do with all that broth the next morning, but reading the various reviews I went ahead and removed the shoulder from my cooker (about 11am) then poured the broth out into a large gravy separator.  Pulled the pork apart on a tray with forks (being careful not to overdo it and make it too fine) then returned it to the cooker.  Added 1 ladle of the broth back in ... along with 3 cups of my BBQ sauce.  Cooked it one more hour then served on kaiser rolls with side dishes.  Oh Wow!!!  None of us could believe how great this turned out.  Everyone was commenting on it and nobody could stop with just one sandwich.  

I can't see eating the pork without a BBQ sauce or gravy as some reviewers commented, but with the right sauce - this is a definite HOME RUN !!!   Thanks, Sarge.  I'm making this again when family comes to town in two weeks.  They'll love it.

Great..but!  I've combined this and another recipe I've read somewhere and have experimented with an effort to get the most taste with the least work. I've used the following about ten times and guarantee you, it's impossible to miss.  Pepper then brown the pork (shoulder or butt, the cheap cuts), stick it in the slow cooker, pour 1/2-3/4 bottle of your favorite bbq sauce on it, wait 8-10 hours, debone and remove any leftover chunks of fat, shred the meat, put it back in the cooker on high, mix well with the balance of the bbq sauce, wait 1/2 to 1 hour, serve on buns (with good beer).

Oh wow! Absolutely scrumptious! I read most of the reviews and took some of those suggestions when making this. I added three minced cloves of garlic and some onion flakes.  I sprinkled the roast with salt & pepper and then seared it before putting it in the slow cooker. It cooked all day and smelled delicious when we got home.  After six hours it really did fall apart easily.  I took about a third of the meat and placed it in a pot on the stove. I added the season broth and BBQ sauce.  Sweet!  The plain meat itself appeared dry at first but then we put the "au ju" as my hubby called the seasoned broth, on the shredded pork and placed it back in the slow cooker.  Delicious! My hubby was very impressed and had two of each sandwich...plain and BBQ. That was his birthday dinner and he loved it! Thank you! It's a sure bet I'll be making this again in the future!

I have tried a lot of pulled pork recipes with a ton of ingredients and steps. But not one of them compares to this. It is fantastic. And it is so easy! I never use any other recipe. I add 3 cloves of cracked garlic to the liquids.

WOW!  I can't believe I actually made something this good!  Based on other reviews, I also added liquid smoke and a jar of BBQ sauce, and upped the coffee to 1 cup.  I also added Worchestire sauce, a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, and 2 sm cans of tomato paste for thickness and a touch of sweetness.  My husband LOVED it!

Great recipe.  I cooked it on high for just half the time (around 4 hours).  I served it with warm BBQ sauce and kaiser rolls, baked beans, cole slaw and sweet tea!  I perfect southern meal for Father's Day for my husband.  I have learned that it is best to quickly brown (on all sides) on the stove any roast you will do in the crock pot before putting it in the pot.  It gives it a little color and more flavor.

This was so easy!  I rubbed my pork with salt, pepper, garlic and a little celery salt before putting in the crock pot.  I also added 2 tablespoons of Liquid Smoke.  I put mine in about 10pm and left it on overnight.  I was SO good!  Thanks for sharing!

There are a few thing missing here - coming from someone that has requests for my pork at events year after year...  1) apple cider vinegar, it's a must especially if you're from the South.  I use a cup and no broth or coffee.  Just rub it down with spices and pour the vinegar over the meat.  2) more hours.  This should slow cook for 10-12 hours.  I've made over a hundred of these things and it definitely needs more time.  3) Leave the fat on before cooking, and be sure it's on top when you put it in the pot.  Trust me, it comes right off in the end and completely enhances the juiciness of the meat.  There's no need to cut this in half at all.  If you cook it as long as I do, the bone falls off, and the meat can be shredded with your fingers.  This is better than a fork because you can feel any fat as you pull.  Sometimes you can't tell it's fat unless by touch.  I hate giving a bad rating but I know that 6-8 hours isn't nearly enough on low, so I'm going to give it four.  Hope these comments help.

since i was cooking only for him, i cut about 1.5lb off the 5lb pork butt and froze the rest for next time. i forgot my mom was had my crock pot so i used a large pot instead.   i cut up some onion rings and layered the bottom of the pot - roast on top. i also made a few slits in the meat and inserted garlic cloves.  i used 1/4 starbucks americano, 1/4 beef broth, 1 tsp liquid smoke, and 1/2 jack daniels honey bbq sauce.   after 3 hours on low heat, i removed it from the pot and wrapped it in tin foil for an hour.   i put the juices and onions from the pot in a separate container.   i shredded the meat and put it back in the pot, added back just enough juices to moist the meat and some more jd bbq. i heated that up for 5 minutes.   i took the top half of a kaiser roll and dipped it in the juices i separated. next i piled on the pork, some onions and a large glob of cole slaw.   my boyfriend took one bite and was in love!   this was an easy dish. next time i will cook the rest of the roast and freeze the leftover meat in portions.

I have made this many times and figured out that using pork butt is definitely the way to go.  However, keep in mind how much this will produce.  I end up freezing the remaining without sauce in quart sized bags and use in other recipes!  Pork tacos, Pork enchiladas, wraps ... ect  When Im ready for the pulled pork I grab a quart sized back out of the freezer and boil in the bag on the stovetop until warmed.

Holy lip smacking good!! This is, hands down, bar none, the BEST pulled pork I have ever had!!

I had a 6.5lb pork butt roast, cut it in half and trimmed off some of the really visible fat on the bottom of it (but left much of it for flavor), put it in the crock pot, poured a can of beef broth and the coffee over it and let it do its thing! The only thing I changed was the time. I started it at 10:00 last night and when I got up this morning at 5am it seemed good but wasn't quite as tender as I'd like, probably because it's a bigger roast. So I let it go on low all day while I was at work. Came home at 4:00 - it literally fell off the bone it was so tender, I had to actually use a spoon to get it out of the crock pot! Took a couple of forks and shredded it... perfection! So it cooked a looooong time... about 15 hours. I have to tell you - the longer it cooks, the more tender and flavorful it gets! Do NOT be afraid to let it cook on low all night and all day before you serve it! Poured a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce and put it back in the crock pot for another hour to let the flavors blend. Served it with cole slaw (I like to put slaw on top of it on the roll) and I've got to tell you, there's nothing much tastier than this! This is hands down a favorite in my household from now on!

I was so excited to try this after all the great reviews.  It was definitely tender, but the flavor was very bland.  I even added some pork bbq spice.  If I decide to make it again, I will need to step up the flavor profile 10 fold.  If you are a big bbq fan - you will probably be disappointed.

As someone who supplies a sailboat crew on a distance race with an awesome meal, this is SO easy. I usually use a boneless pork loin roast (on sale - stock up) to eliminate the deboning step and it's a good way to use up that bit of stock left over in the refrigerator.  Once I have this completed with the BBQ sauce added I freeze it if it's being used for the race.  No freezer aboard so by the second day this is defrosting well. When they're ready for supper they can re-heat on the stove quickly and spoon onto buns for a handheld meal while they're balanced on the upwind (high) side of the boat.  I provide some cut veggies or non-sloppy cole slaw to grab and round out the meal.  Portable food is a must for this purpose. I really think they crew returns every year for the food!

We've made this pulled pork for about a year now and it's the best ever! We do add liquid smoke and have found that if we have a pork shoulder and let is cook on low for about 24 hours its just melts in your mouth. My family made me promise not to let it cook overnight as they can't sleep with the incredible aroma that floats around the house. I just can't make that promise. =)  Great recipe, easy to do and everyone loves it.

Very easy pulled pork recipe.  Nice and moist. I have made it several times and followed the recipe exactly.  Unlike other reviewers, I don't think browning the meat before putting it in the slow cooker will make a difference.  Once the meat is tender, I remove it from the crock pot.  I then dump the liquid that remains in the crock pot into a pyrex bowl.  I then put the shredded meat back into the crock pot, pour BBQ sauce and add some of the juice I saved back, to make sure the meat stays nice and moist.  The best part is, you can add any amount (and kind) of BBQ sauce you like, I always put some BBQ sauce on the table for those that like even more.  I have never gotten a bad review from the many people who have eaten it!  I am quick to tell them where I got the recipe too!
Thanks for sharing!!

I had a great recipe once and lost it.  I could only remember it used coffee and liquid smoke.  So I altered Sarge's recipe a bit.  I omitted the beef broth, used 1 c. brewed coffee, 1 tsp liquid smoke and 1 tbl worcestere.  Once the pork pulled off the bone and was finished cooking, I added 1 bottle of sweet baby Rays BBQ Sauce.  OMG delish.  Sided with my famous baked beans, it was a superb meal.

this is one of the easiest and tastiest meals I have made. I basically followed the recipe, except I used a boneless pork roast (center cut) because I couldn't find a bone-in pork butt at any of my local supermarkets. My roast was 3 lbs and because I was worried it would be dry since it was boneless, I used the full 14 ounces of beef broth and 1/4 cup of coffee. I seasoned before adding the liquid with salt and pepper and nothing else. After adding the coffee and broth, I cooked on low for 7 hours. After 7 hours, the pork was very soft and I kind of "stirred" it with a butter knife while still inside the crock pot.  I didn't have a lot of extra broth-- again, I think mine was not as moist because of the cut of meat I used. I then added in some of my favorite BBQ sauce and served it on fresh kaiser rolls to rave reviews. My 3 lb roast made enough for 5 large sandwiches.

This works great with a "Boston Butt" pork roast. 
Meat literally falls off the bone and the retained broth is a wonderful brown gravy stock.!
This has become a "standard" for office "Pot-luck" lunches -
Guests always come back for more!

Oh Man! This is good stuff. I made it again the next weekend just so I had some more great sandwiches. I added some crushed garlic and worcestershire sause and a little of the broth, then let it cook another hour. PERFECT!

Add a dash of liquid smoke to the meat before cooking for that smokey flavor.  We like to seperate the fat from the meat after cooking, and add BBQ sauce.  My husband is from Austin, TX and prefers Salt Lick BBQ sauce. Excellent!

Followed exactly as stated recipe. Served with BBQ sauce in a bowl on the side. Both husband and 13 yr. old son loved it. Will use to make pork burritos with leftovers. Super recipe.

This is amazing.  I made it with a 3 1/2 pound roast.  Once I had pulled the meat apart and removed the fat, I put it back in the slow cooker with about 1 cup of the meat juices (fat removed) and bar-b-que sauce from the Spoiled Baby Back Ribs recipe on this site.  After this was warmed up it was just perfect for supper.  It would need more bar-b-que sauce if I had more meat.  So easy to make!

The possibilities for this are endless!  After picking the meat apart, I leave it plain.  When we want BBQ sandwiches, we just drizzle BBQ sauce over the top.  Ive added taco seasoning to make tacos (daughters FAVORITE). Tonight I made BBQ pizza with it.  Even my picky husband loves it!

Giving this only 4 stars as I didnt follow the recipe:  
I got a 3LB pork butt roast from my local asian market butcher counter.  I've found that for a cheaper cut of meat, the asian market butcher counter is the best place to go.  Most chain grocrey stores only sell 7+lb bone-in roasts which is too much for my family.  Anyway, I seasoned the meat with pepper and mrs dash and placed it in the crockpot with NO liquid.  The meat will create its own drippings.  Cook on low for 10hrs.  Remove meat from crockpot, drain (save drippings), and shred meat removing as much fat from it as possible.  Place shredded meat back in the crockpot changing the setting to warm.  I spoon the fat off the top of the drippings and pour the remaining back over the meat.  
I either make my own BBQ sauce (Recipe from Brisket with BBQ Sauce) or heat up some original Sweet Baby Ray's sauce in a saucepan.  I let everyone add however much sauce they want on their individual portions.  
Very tasty and very easy recipe!

Once I figured out that a "pork butt roast" is also known as "pork shoulder" around here I was fine.  I (obviously) have never made anything with this cut of meat. After cooking the pork shoulder in the crock pot it took a while to pull the good pork meat away from the fat.  I was pretty concerned about the amount of fat in the juice as well so after it sat for a while (after I shredded the meat) I spooned off about 1/3 of the juice from the top and discarded it.  There was still plenty left. I then put the de-fatted meat back into the remaining juice and added our favorite bbq sauce.  While it IS a little labor intensive it was very good and worth every minute. I made this the day before a party and just warmed it up in the crock pot the next day.  Worked out great!!

This is the only pork recipe I use!  Skip the coffee, don't need it....seasoned with S&P, garlic and onion powder.  Used 1/2 pkg of Lipton onion soup mix.  Take out after 6 hours and ladle out most of the broth. The broth plus BBQ sauce will make it too watery.  Break apart meat and add Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce (I use no other!  It's the best!) and let it cook for another hour.

This recipe was awesome in two ways #1 extremelty easy to make and #2 DELICIOUS!!  The only thing that I did that was different was adding some mesquite seasoning to the recipe.  I served this on some fresh rolls with corn on the cob and a salad.

Was a good easy way to cook the pork and with the right BBQ sauce it should be good (we had a sweeter kind in the house which is not normally our preferecne). I also have to turn my slow cooker up a notch or two otherwise it has to cook too long (not the recipe's fault).

Used a frozen pork loin and it worked great.  Should have saved the stock but was in a hurry to add my favorite BBQ sauce.  Will definitely make again...maybe a great tailgate sandwich in the fall!

This was just great!  Even my picky 7 year old loved it!  And so easy.  I'd never made pulled pork before, and I thought it would be much more difficult.  My family enjoyed it with and without the BBQ sauce.

In the words of one of my guests "This is insane". I used a 10lb pork butt roast following Sarge's recipe only adding Bad Bryon's Butt Rub (dry marinade) and grilling it for 20 minutes and then into the crockpot for about 10hrs. Served with Texas Pete Hot Sauce or Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce, coleslaw on homemade buns. Sides were corn on the cob, homemade potato salad and and bbq baked beans. They gave it a 6 star out of 5 star rating.

ALWAYS A HIT!  I have made this countless times now & it is great for big gatherings.  I use a 5-6# pork loin & 1 can of low sodium beef broth...that's it!  No coffe, no S&P, no browning it first.  When it's ready to be shredded (about 8 hours on low) take the meat out & pour the liquid through a strainer to remove some of the fat.  Once you shred the meat, put it back in the slow cooker and add a little of the juices back to keep it moist.  I usually keep the BBQ sauce on the side, but I have added it at the end a few times too.

This was FANTASTIC.  I used a sliced sirloin roast.  I served it with BBQ sauce on toasted buns. Tonight I'm using the leftovers as stuffing for burritos. This pork could be used for many dishes. It was so tender and flavorful. What a nice surprise.

Wow what an easy recipe. I used bone pork roast and 2 can beef broth and cooked all day in crockpot. It was so tender juicy and what a flavor. I was suprised how good it tasted right out of the pan. I pulled it and used hunts brown sugar bbq sauce and added a little brown sugar and used most of the broth. It was so juicy and tasty ,this is the ONLY way I am making pork in a crock, it was that good.

I must have done something hugely wrong.  The roast was tough and tasteless.  I bought a bone-in butt roast so I couldn't cut it in half.  Should it have been boneless?

This is the most tender pulled pork I've ever made. It came out perfect! My family
absolutely loved it. I put my favorite barbecue sauce on it and heated it through
in the crockpot. Don't forget to save the cooking juices because that's mighty tasty
too.

Cooked without coffee or much salt, seasoning, etc. on high for 6-8 hrs. adding BBQ sauce at the beginning and a little at the end of the cooking time. No broth, as the meat gets juicy without it. It turned out fantastic!

Fabulous recipe. I skipped the coffee. Make sure you save some of the liquid to use to thin out the BBQ sauce and moisten the finished product. 8 lb Picnic Shoulder went real fast. Will be making this again.

Excellent recipe!  So easy to make and so so good!  I add 1/2 bottle of BBQ sauce to the slow cooker.  Both shoulder and butt roast work well.  The meat comes out so tender.  I like to top the pork on my sandwich with cole slaw.

Turned out perfectly.  I paired this meat with "Raspberry Chipotle Sauce" by Holly, all wrapped up in warm tortillas.  See my custom version of Holly's recipe to see minor tweaks I made to the sauce.

Wow!  We had pulled-pork sandwiches at friends' house a while back, and I asked for the recipe.  The one I received had a list of 20 or so ingredients, so I went in seach of something easier.  Sarge, thank you SO much!  My family loved this recipe, and it couldn't have been easier to fix.  Like someone suggested, I added a splash of liquid smoke, and it added another great flavor to the dish.  I have a love/hate relationship with my crock pot, but this recipe was put in the "love" pile!  :o)

Pork goes into crock-pot and comes out dinner. This one is a no-brainer...so delicious and easy. Toss in some BBQ sauce, put it on a bun with slaw and you've got dinner (and a few lunches). Great recipe.

Definitely lives up to the hype all of the other reviewers have given this.  I especially liked the background flavor the coffee gives, so I would highly recommend NOT omitting that.  Reduce the amount of broth if you're worried about it being too liquidy.  Even better as leftovers. Thanks, Sarge!!

Out of the many Pulled Pork recipes my family has tried, this by far is the best, easiest way to cook it.  I make it exactly the way Sarge directs, but I add a second step after I shred the pork once cooled.  I put it back in the slow cooker on low, and add a bottle of barbeque sauce to it. Once it is heated through again, it is free for everyone to help themselves.....and they do!!

I've made this recipe many times and I absolutely love it!  I add 1 tea liquid smoke with the broth and coffee.  This really helps the flavor.  After its done cooking I shred it and toss with bbq sauce and put it back in the slow cooker to heat it through.  Serve it on onion rolls and OMG its the best thing thats ever passed your lips!!!!!

I loved this recipe, have made it 2 or 3 times in the last month.  I have used beef broth and vegetable broth (on different occassions), added minced garlic, upped the coffee to 1 cup (we love coffee), added 1 tblsp of liquid smoke, and used the cut of meat from the recipe, there are bits of fat but I like it with a little pork fat.  After shredding the meat I poured about half a cup of the juices along with the meat back into the crockpot and then added the barbeque sauce, I used kc masterpiece and sweet baby rays on different occasions, back in the crockpot for 1/2 hour, just delicious!  Oh and I cook it on low for 8 hours.

This is an awesome recipe for those who work. Just make your coffee use some of the coffee grounds to slow cooker, salt and pepper the pork, add the water and bam. Insta dinner. It's always nice coming home to a pork smelling house and all I have to do is shred the meat with two forks and add bbq...so easy a husband can do it! I will say the taste will depend on what sauce you use, but it gives you a personal twist. I always use a 2.5lb pork butt or shoulder and there is always left overs. We are only two people. If there is too much water in the pot after you've seperated it you can always ladle it out, no worries!

i never review recipes but just had to comment on this one.  i needed something tasty for a family reunion nd this was perfect!  i used two 4.5 lb. pork butt roasts, 1 cup of coffee and 1 14oz. can of beef broth. i slow cooked it on low for 8.5 hrs. overnight and it just fell apart!  i took all of the grease out and cut away any large fatty portions, then put the pork back in the crockpot mixed with a large jar of barbecue sauce.  it would have worked just as well to offer a couple different sauces on the side.  thanks for a great recipe!

This really is very easy. Just do a pepper and salt rub on a 5 pound pork butt roast (shoulder works too, but its a pain), and put it in the crock pot on low with a 14 oz can of beef broth. Searing the sides before hand and adding the coffee didn't seem to add much, so I skip that. I recommend serving this on a kaiser roll with Stubbs original bbq sauce and coleslaw (but remember, the coleslaw goes IN the sandwich). Yummy.

I have always used seasoning on my pulled pork, and I have given up on that after trying this recipe!  I used a shoulder roast, so there was no bone, and it turned out beautifully.  I did add 1T of liquid smoke and generously coated the outside with salt, and actually ended up sprinkling some more after it was finished.  This was far superior to my old method.  It's simple, and delicious.

Very Nice Sarge. Thanks for the Info this is such a great recipe. thats so easy to make and can be spiced to everyone certain tastes, I myself like to hit it off with alittle crushed red pepper and acouple dashs of toasted seseame oil. gives a awesome flavor. as far as picking out pork to use, find something with nice marbleing. that fat adds a great amount of flavor and will cook down so ya wont even see or have pieces fat in the final product. Thanks again Sarge

I have made this recipe many many times and it always comes out wonderful!!! After the pork is done, I remove it from the crockpot, pull it apart with a fork remove any fat, then place back in crockpot with barbecue sauce, our fav Dinosaur Barbecue, let cook for a little while longer until it warms up, serve on rolls, its wonderful any time of the year!

Very tasty without question! I added a 1/4 cup of rootbeer in lieu of the coffee for sweetness. Outside of that pretty much just stick to the recipe and enjoy!!! ; ) Always a favorite around here!

The pork was amazing!  I used 1/4 cup of regular cola instead of coffee to give it an extra sweetness.  I also used some of my favorite spices (paprika, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper).  Many of these spices were in my BBQ sauce, which I also added to the mix (maybe 1/4 of the bottle).  After cooking on high for about 5 hours, the bones popped right out of the meat.  This is definitely getting made again.

Oh my...I can see why this one got so many good ratings!!  Rarely do I say that I LOVE a recipe, but I sure do love this one.  Made as noted except that I used a boneless pork shoulder roast and rubbed 2 cloves minced garlic and some rib rub onto roast before adding to slow cooker.  Used half a can beef broth and cooked for 8 hours.  Drained, shredded and added the other half can of beef broth and the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and cooked for another hour.  YUM!!!!  This one is a keeper for sure!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I rarely give five stars to recipe only when a recipe does not require any adjustment and works like magic time and time again.

This is the best way ever to cook pulled pork! I did let the roast sit in the fridge overnight, covered in a dry rub recipe I found on Food Network ( 3 TBSP. paprika, 3 TBSP. kosher salt, 1 TBSP. garlic powder, 1 TBSP. ground mustard, and 1 TBSP. brown sugar) and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours in a little low sodium beef broth. I had to use a spoon to get the meat out of the crock pot! Served it with Russian Potato Salad from this site and baked beans. The pork is so good, you don't even need BBQ sauce!

This was so good, and easy. I used a boneless pork loin roast, garlic salt and pepper. I did add the beef broth but not the coffee, so I threw in some Liquid Smoke, and about half of a diced onion. I loved that I didn't have to mess with it at all. It was tender and juicy, and I even liked the taste of it without BBQ sauce! I can't wait to make this again.

The best pulled pork I've ever made!! I adjusted the recipe a bit. I really found that you don't need to use an entire can of beef broth. If you have a 4 to 5LB. of pork butt roast (which is perfect for this recipe)the meat cooks with plenty of juices itself without the addition of liquid. I used 1/2 a can of beef broth and 1/4c of coffee. Which gives the meat a nice succulent taste. I cooked this on the stovetop for 6-8 hrs. and it was perfecto! The last hour I drained the juices and added a bottle of BBQ sauce and let it simmer and pulled the pork with two forks it was just the best ever on rolls. And this makes plenty so much so I had to freeze it and I made this for a small party of 8 people. Next time I'd like to try this same recipe and omit the BBQ sauce and just use the juices and make gravy. YUM-O !!

Delicious and very easy!  I substituted a pork loin rib end boneless roast (that's all the store had) and going by what others had said, I reduced the beef broth to 1/2 c.  Then after shredded the pork (it didn't need much help, it was very tender), I put it back in the slow cooker and added one bottle of BBQ sauce.  I cooked it on low for about 1 hour more and served it on sandwich rolls.  Delicious!

This was very tasty and everyone loved it.  There were two things that no one was prepared for- the color and consistancy was that of pate.  We weren't sure if it was cooked too long or pulled too much. Either way, it was delicious and there was not much leftover.  We used pork loin instead of butt roast, a 1/2 c. of coffee and seasoned it with garlic powder and seasoned salt.  We also ended up putting the drippings by 1/4 cups into the pork along with the bbq sauce because it seemed so dry.  Great for a party (there were 10 of us, we all ate ourselves sick and still had enough for a small lunch the next day!)

Was very good but we made this with a few changes. First we did not use the coffee, and second, we used boneless pork roast verses the cut that is suggested in the recipe. We also used some liquid smoke as suggested by another. The first time we thought it tasted a little salty and thought maybe if we cut down on the beef broth that would do the trick. So the second time we made it that is exactly what we did, and it was still a little too salty for my taste. I think next time I will use the correct amount of beef broth and totally omit the liquid smoke..that is what was making it so salty. 
Other than that this was very yummy and something I will be making again for sure.

This is pretty good. I actually prefer to just cook the pork in a cn of beer and onions with a good rub on it. In the last hour or so I drain everything, shred it, and put it back in with a good BBQ sauce. Delicious!

Having time to cook has nothing to do with this wonderful recipe!  Even if you have all the time in the world, this is the greatest recipe you can find for pulled pork. No changes need be made - my husband, a picky eater, says "this is to die for!"  Way to go, Sarge!

This is the most awesome recipe. I don't even pull the pork, we just eat it -- it is so tender, moist, juicy, delicious & easy.  My 2-year-old loves the meat and can't get enough. Thanks!!!

At 1st I was a little hesitant because of the amount of coffee. My fear was immediatly non-existant when I tasted this SIMPLE recipe. MUCH BETTER than store bought pulled pork. DELICIOUS!!!

My husband loves anything that takes more than 4 hours to cook.  When I made this for him he asked me when it would be ready I told him tonight- he almost passed out.  And then he tasted it, and he did pass out!  Great recipe SARGE!

This pulled pork was BOMB!!!  I didn't exactly follow the recipe to a t, but I knew it would work with minimal fuss from reading the reviews.  I bought a 3.5 lb of pork shoulder, cut it into five pieces to fit into my crock pot.  I salted it well with garlic salt only, then placed it in the pot where I added 2/3 of a 20oz bottle of Hunt's Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce.  I added 1/2 cup of beef broth.  Then I set the crock pot to 5 hours on high.  I took it out at 4.5 hrs...OMG!  This pork was AMAZING!  It flaked beautifully and just melted in your mouth.  I buttered some sesame hamburger buns and added a little bit of BBQ on top of the meat.  

I will definitely make this again and again.  Easy and delicious.

Incredibly easy, moist and delicious.  Next time I'll try seasoned salt instead of just S&P.  We especially like that you don't have to commit to a barbecue sauce.  It's good just as it is, or you can serve a variety of sauces on the side to fit individual tastes.

I had my doubts, but this was by far the best pulled pork we have ever made!  I had to do one substitution...there was no shoulder or butt roast when I went to the store!  The butcher suggest "rib ends".  I was skeptical, but used them and the whole thing was awesome.  Don't know how you could improve it.  Thanks, Sarge...a delicious, simple recipe enjoyed by all that watched the Packers beat the Bears!

My first time making pulled pork and boy, am I glad I chose this recipe! It was so easy and so delicious. I made it just like the recipe called for, as I believe it should always be to give an honest "review"; you can always modify the next time.  Thank you!

Oh yeah!  Used the coffee and broth (and just a touch of Liquid Smoke) and the poker party gang was too busy munching and licking fingers to say anything but "MMMmmmmMMMMM!"  Gave 'em their choice of Sweet Baby Ray's or my own N. Carolina style sauce and they couldn't stop smacking.  Took the time to pull a lot of the fat off the roast after it cooked, but that was the toughest part of the whole recipe.  Shredded/chopped it and put it back in the crock pot on warm with a little of the 'jus' and everyone served themselves when ready.  Easy, delicious and pleased the whole group.  Thanks, Sarge, from an old Navy Chief!  =)

This is a super easy recipe.  I put it together yesterday morning & it was ready to be pulled late in the afternoon.  After pulling it, I put a new liner in the pot, added BBQ sauce & put the meat in.  After mixing it up, had to add more sauce.  Turned the pot on for 4 hrs & let in cook on low.  When it was done I put in the fridge over nite & packaged it this morning.  We are full time RV'ers & hat sandwiches are a quick supper when we are on the road.  The flavor of these is delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe, Sarge.

Gut-wrenchingly DELICIOUS! My husband declared this better than Dicks Bodacious BBQ! Super easy in the crock pot. Reviewer kbresler was right on- I followed her suggestions.  1)rub the roast with garlic salt and pepper. 2) I put in frozen chopped onion (a handful) to float in the broth. Didn't spear the roast with garlic and did use half beef broth/half veggie broth. It was still perfect. I cooked it on high for five hours and then three hours at low. Drained the broth and onions out, scraped off the fat and added a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays' Sweet and Spicy BBQ Sauce! Perfection. Thank you!

Thank you "Sarge" - It doesn't get any simpler than this! Serve on crusty French rolls with a good "Saluda-Style" cole slaw (sweet/sour vinegar-base w/red cabbage added for color)  Make sure you use the pork shoulder or butt; pork loins (in my opinion) are less fatty bit also less flavorful.

My DH made this and it was so good.  Best pork BBQ recipe there is and it's so easy. Served it with Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce, from this site. This is the best sauce on the planet.

This is very good!!! I love that you cut the roast in half because before adding the BBQ sauce I pulled half out for other recipes. I drained the juices and added Sweet Baby Rays and made the French Bread Roll to die for and YUMMY!!

Delicious and easy.  I love that you don't have to brown it first.  I've made this a few times with and without coffee.  It's great either way and doesn't have any coffee flavor if you do use it.  I've also played around with adding garlic and onion powder, paprika and brown sugar to make more of a rub. Sometimes I make it just like the recipe. It's hard to mess up.  It's great any way you want to spice it up.  I do really like adding a big of liquid smoke like others have said.  My favorite way to eat it is without the bun along side garlic mashed potatos and veggies.  Mmmmmm!

I love crock pot recipes because I can go to work and cook dinner at the same time.  I've never done a pulled pork before but this was truly amazing!  I used pork shoulder and trimmed the fat.  Mine did require the full 8 hours of cooking on low and it was at it's optimal tenderness and "pullability".  Once the pork was pulled, I drained most of the liquid in the pot and then used the Vinegar based NC BBQ Sauce on this site and let it "stew" in those juices for a bit.  My daugher found a great tangy sauce on this site called "Tanky Spare Ribs" and she made the sauce to go with the pulled pork sandwhiches.  The vinegar based sauce was good for keeping the meat tender and moist but the bbq flavor and consistency of the tangy spare rib sauce by Judy Clark just really hit the spot with these.  We had them on Kaiser rolls and with cole slaw.  Just awesome.  The family thinks we should have this once a month now.  The only really bad part was, we ate them while watching the season premier of "Biggest Loser", and felt a little guilty...

First reviewer was correct.  Didn't add the coffee, only added 1/4 cup beef broth and 2/3 bottle of BBQ sauce and it still came out with so much liquid that I took it out in the last hour and added cornstarch to thicken it over the stove as a sauce for the sandwiches.  I also added grilled onions in the last hour when I put in the last 1/3 bottle of BBQ sauce in.

This was awesome. However, I must admit, I changed it a lot. I covered the meat with 6 cloves of garlic and a large onion, flavored with pork seasoning, and left out the coffee. I let it cook for 21 hours, and it was AMAZING!!

True to his word, Sarge's bbq pork is great.  I had a 5 lb boneless shoulder.  Seasoned it with seasoning salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika.  I upped the coffee to 1 cup, which I added to one cup of beef broth.  I put it in the cooker at 8:30am, it's now 3:30 pm, pulled, and back into the crock with 1/2 bottle of Ray's with a cup of the drippings.  My wife loves it!  Thanks, Sarge.

OH MY GOD. AMAZING! My husband begs for this dish almost on weekly basis. We don't have a slow cooker so we do it in a pot on low heat on the stove and it always works out. We have become famous for it among our friends.

Very good!  I added garlic powder when seasoning with salt and pepper, and used 1 tsp. liquid smoke.  I also took the suggestion to serve with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I chopped the meat and put it back into the slowcooker with the leftover juices and bottle of BBQ sauce, but next time I will serve it immediately with the BBQ sauce on the side.

Oh my, this was good. I made 2 batches of this for my daughter's birthday party. The variations I used were: pork loin, upped the coffee to 3/4, and used 4 finely cut cloves of garlic. After all was done and pulled aprt, I put pork back into crock pot and filled back up with the juice. Served with the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce from this site. This definately gets put into rotation.

This is the best pulled pork ever!  I was looking for somthing that didn't have bbq sauce in it.  I have made this three times now over the last several months.  This last time was the best!  I eliminated the broth all together.  I upped the coffee to 1 & 1/2 cups and made it double strengh.  You dont really taste the coffee, but it did give it a different flavor.  Kind of a pain to remove all the fat after cooking, but well worth it!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could, thanks Sarge!

This was delicious!  It created a very pleasing aroma throughout the house as I had it slow cooking over night.  Althought the meat was amazing w/o anything else, I added BBQ sauce and we ate pulled pork sandwiches.  Next time, I will try it w/o BBQ sauce and simply make a salad.  Also, I will not add any salt b/c the beef broth has enough salt in it already.  I will be making this for years to come!  Oh, by the way, I used an 8lb pork tenderloin.

I loved this recipe! I lived in Kentucky awhile an missed the pulled pork sandwiches you get there. This was an excellent substitution.  I added 1/4 tsp. minced garlic and 1/2c of coffee as suggested. It was excellent! After letting it cook and pulled it from the bone I add a small amount of my favorite BBq Sauce 'bone suckin sauce' it was fabulous

Tasty, easy and perfect for a large crowd. After shredding, put back in crock with Sweet Baby Rays. You can't miss with this one! Potatoe salad and cole slaw are nice sides.

First, I abhor coffee but decided to use it anyways since other reviews stated the coffee taste was undetectable.  Once cooked, the coffee taste is undetectable.  The combination of coffee, 1 tsp. liquid smoke, beef broth, and cheap clearanced out meat made the best pulled pork I've ever had--it's as good as any BBQ found in Texas!  I just threw it all in the crockpot before work & had dinner waiting that evening.  Great job & THANK YOU Sarge!!

I've made this twice now. It was fall-apart tender both times. It was no trouble at all to shred for sandwiches. First time followed the recipe nearly exactly. I used low-sodium beef broth & added a little liquid smoke as suggested - it was good but a little bland (that's why only 4 stars). The second time I didn't have beef broth on hand so substituted regular chicken broth & left out the coffee. Browned the meat before putting it in the slow-cooker & again added a little liquid smoke. Much, much better the 2nd time. The kids really loved it so it will definitely go into regular rotation at our house.

This was a very good recipe.  I did have a little trouble with too much fat on the pork that I bought.  I probably should have tried to cut some of it off before I started but I didn't.  I went to shred the meat and I ran into some fatty chunks which were pretty gross, I picked them out, but I was a little paranoid that I didn't get them all and a guest of mine would get one in their sandwich...ew!  Anyway...I drained the pork and shredded it and returned it to the slow cooker with some "Sweet Baby Ray's" BBQ sauce.  I let it simmer in the BBQ sauce for about an hour and served it on a toasted hoagie with the Restaurant-Style Cole Slaw recipe from AR. My guests asked to take some pork home with them so it must have been a success.  Next time I will try to buy a less fatty roast and make sure I trim it before I put it in the crock.   Overall a very good recipe.

One of the best pulled pork recipes I've had! I used two 2 pound pork butt shoulders, cut them in half, and then followed the recipe. I pulled the pork after about 12 hours in the slow cooker, it tore very easily and I just used two forks since there was no bone. I wasn't going to need it until later, so I put about a 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and the pork into a Tupperware container, mixed it up, and stuck it in the fridge. I served it with the same sauce. I was just sweet enough, and leaving it in with the sauce gave it just the kind of sweet flavor I love. Going to make it again next week!

This was the easiest meal I think I have ever fixed. My pork roast was seasoned with onion and garlic and they didn't have any plain ones at the store, so I used what I could find. I only had a small roast (3lb). This could have used some au jus as my husband wanted a dipping broth and there wasn't very much. This really didn't have any Wow factor or flavor but it is a good basic pulled pork dish. I prefer Kalua Pork if I'm going to make a pulled pork, but this is easy, much faster, and we still enjoyed this. My husband is looking forward to the leftovers to take to work for fixing breakfast taquitos. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Spectacular!! I added 2 cups beef broth, and 1 cup freshly brewed dark-roast coffee. I also sprinkled some dry mustard on the meat, along with the salt and pepper. Unbelievable. Try using the broth to make a gravy, and pour over mashed potatoes. SO GOOD!

Everyone wanted the recipe!  I added a grill seasoning instead of just salt and pepper.

I have made this several times and this is the best pulled pork I've ever had. My company loved it too. It was moist, tender, and did not taste like I had just dumped a jar of BBQ sauce in a crock pot with ribs. I highly recommend this easy and delicious recipe!

Very simple yet incredibly delicious.  Added an entire bottle of BBQ sauce after 7 hours of cooking and left a bit of the drippings with it too.  Yum!

I followed this recipe exactly. It was a good recipe that you can eat as is. I was looking for something that could be used without any sauce for my sons graduation party since not everyone likes BBQ sauce. This one fit the bill. I make a lot of pork roasts and this will be my go to recipe from now on. 

Update - I have been making this since 2012. I have tried others but still go back to this one for a good roast that you can use a variety of ways when you are done. However, I want to mention a very important step to this is cutting the roast in half and putting salt and pepper on it. I got lazy a couple of times and just put it on the top.  It made a difference in the end product. You wouldn't think salt and pepper would make such a difference,  but they do.

I've been making this for years and finally getting around to making a review. The only thing I do differently is add dry BBQ seasoning rub. Once we moved north, it was impossible to find decent BBQ. So many of my friends *LOVE* this recipe!  I do take out 1 chunk at a time and keep the lid on.  I'm not too fast on the shredding and get distracted.

I used 3.75lbs of pork butt roast.  I also slathered salt and pepper all over the roast.  Also, instead of using beef broth I used about 24oz of Cherry Coke.  Total the roast only need 6 hours to cook.  Update: I used 3lbs of pork shoulder butt roast.  Instead of beef broth I used about 24oz of Cherry Coke.  It cooked on low for 4.5 hours.

Nom nom nom! This recipe was crazy good and so easy it was ridiculous. The only thing we did slightly differently was coat the pork in salt, pepper, and garlic salt. The pork was so moist and flavorful, even before mixing my sammie with a little Sweet Baby Ray's honey bbq sauce. Delish! Thanks, Sarge---this is a total keeper!

This recipe is simple and delicious.  I prepared it exactly as written.  After 6 hours in the slow cooker I removed the pork and let it cool before pulling it apart and then replacing it in about 1/2 of the liquid in which it cooked to keep it warm.  Serve on a bun with a little BBQ sauce and cole slaw and you've got an amazingly tasty sandwich!

It doesn’t get any easier than this one!!  The hardest part, well, most time consuming, for me was the pulling.  I had a 4 lb. roast, but still used the full amount of broth and coffee.  I froze the leftovers before adding the sauce, which will be nice to have on hand for busy days.  Thank you!

I will be making this for a 3rd time this 4th of July since a Mothers Day Cookout.  I use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  It is especially delicious after 2 days.  All the flavors get to meld and yes, everyone says Mmmmm.  I tried it with the Amish Slaw on the sandwich and that made the Mmmm's even longer.  If you don't like Mayo in your slaw, try the Amish recipe on this site.  Fantastic combo.

I was curious how the coffee flavor would come across in this recipe. I could tell there was a slight deeper flavor there, but if I hadn't known, I wouldn't have tasted the coffee, at all.  Beyond the coffee. this was pretty good as is, but I will definitely add spices/flavors also next time.  Oh, and just in case you fall asleep and let it cook for 13 hours...haha, it still is tasty ... but a little dry :)

This was good, I followed instructions and when I got home the flavor was very bland, so I whisked in a 1/2 c. of BBQ sauce to the broth that was still in the crock pot, and it was perfect after that.  Will definitely make again with the addition of a little BBQ sauce.

This turned out perfect!  My fiance and I just loved it.  It made a LOT of meat, so we've got leftovers in the freezer!  I would definitely try liquid smoke like others have suggested for next time, though.

This is so good and easy. I made this for a potluck at work and everybody loved it. It's a really inexpensive way to feed a group. I mixed this with Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce recipe from this site and some buns to make sandwiches. So so good.

It doesn't matter how much you season this pork...it is going to turn out phenomenal!!!  I've just seasoned it with salt and pepper; I've tried a rub of salt/pepper/paprika/garlic powder/brown sugar; I've tried it with adding Worchestershire sauce and liquid smoke to the beef broth...it all comes out wonderful...and there's not much left over afterwards!  ;o)

This was fantastic! Also made some alterations. Cooked 4lbs of pork ribs without the BBQ sauce in slow-cooker on low for eight hours, then put in fridge over night (dinner was for the next day). Next morning I skimmed the fat, then poured one bottle of BBQ sauce in and put on "stay warm". Returned home at 5pm, sliced up, returned to pot while buns toasted, and served up. Whole family loved it!

I don't have a slow cooker so I approximately by putting in the oven for total of 4 hours at 350 degrees.  It worked magnificently!  Relying on a preivous reviewer's note, I dumped in 1 cup of bbq sauce and didn't bother with all the other instructions.  Delicious!

I made this recipe today and was so impressed with the end results.  The meat was VERY tender and moist.  The hunks of meat were falling apart just lifting them out of the cooker with a fork.  I followed the recipe as written (only adjusting portions because my piece of meat was larger).  However, I did add a small pack of BBQ rub to the meat with the salt & pepper for a little extra kick.  I cooked the meat for 3 hours on high and 2 hours on low.  Perfect!  I wiil make this again.

Excellent flavor!  I did not have a can of broth, so I used 2 cups of water with a TBSP. of beef base and upped the coffee to 1/2 cup.  I used garlic salt and coarse ground black pepper and splashed in 2 tsp. of liquid smoke (perfect addition for our tastes).  Served with hickory smoked BBQ sauce,   sliced sweet onion & pickles. Loved it! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

So good. No need to brown the pork prior to slow-cooking it. I cooked the pork on low for about 8 hours, shredded it and put it back in the pot with BBQ sauce for a couple hours. Melts in your mouth!

I have made this twice now and it as been very moist and tender both times.  I use a 2.5 lb. roast for four of us and that is plenty.  Takes about six hours or so to cook through on Low.  When it's done, dump the liquid , shred the pork, and add a full bottle of bbq sauce. I used Stubb's Original last night.  Piled the meat onto toasted kaiser buns and served with a cold pasta salad.  Delicious!

My family loved this meal!  I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's the first time I've made pulled pork of any kind.  I left out everything but the BBQ sauce and seared the (salt, pepper and a little garlic salt) meat in an enameled cast iron dutch oven before putting it in the oven to cook.  I used a shoulder blade cut (2 4+ pound roasts) and it turned out beautifully.  Like my potroasts, I started the pork in a moderate oven (350) for a couple hours, then backed it down to 275 for the remaining time (about another 3.5 hours).  As easy as it is to make, it was very impressive to friends that I "went to all that trouble!"  This is a really good way to take advantage of those sales on pork roasts.  Dee-lish!

I seasoned the roast with a mixture of brown sugar, paprika, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper then browned the roast in oil and butter in the frying pan.  That makes for nice little bits after you shred the meat. Also added carrots, celery, onion and a little molasses to the stock in the crock pot.  Picked out the roast and drained the pot to put in the shred meat back in and bbq sauce for last 2 hrs.  Very Good!!

THE BEST!!! I have used this recipe many times over, there is no better or easier way to make delicious pulled pork! The only thing I do differently is I use onion powder with the pepper & salt rubbed into the meat, and I double the broth. I use the "Kitchen Basics" natural brand broth (sold in a carton 32oz) no MSG, lower in salt, and actually has real beef stock in it. Use the best & this recipe will always be perfect! Top with your favorite BBQ sauce and eat eat eat!!

I agree with the other reviewers who say don't bother adding any liquid. The roast will make liquid on it's own. I added bottled bbq sauce at the beginning & just let it cook! My first time making pork bbq & I will make it this way from now on.

This is such an easy and wonderful recipe; everyone begs me to make it for football parties, etc. This also works well if you're serving a huge group; just make a day or two it ahead of time and warm it up in the oven with extra bbq sauce before serving. Add a couple drops of liquid smoke for more flavor.

LOVE THIS!  I made this last night and it was easy and tasty.  I used a 5 pound roast, rubbed it with salt and pepper and added 1 can of beef broth, i cup of beer and 2 TBSP of Liquid Smoke.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on HIGH for 3 hours.  After it was done, I shredded it and added Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce.

AWESOME - Everyone loved it!

I've made this twice, and both times it's great!  I put the meat on deli rolls w/ sliced onions, a side of beans and coleslaw.  W/ the leftovers the next night, I add a package of taco seasoning to the meat, simmer for a little bit, and have burritos.  Awesome recipe!  Thank you!

This turned out great for its simplicity.  I used pork loin and added 1tsp liquid smoke.  The meat was very tender, served on rolls with KC Masterpeice Original BBQ sauce.  This is a keeper!

This was really easy and really good.  I popped it in the crock pot on high for about 5 hours, then drained it, pulled it, and added a bit of BBQ sauce.  It was great - the kids & hubby all liked it (the picky 12-yr-old pronounced it "delicious" - a true review.)

This is delicious.  Am new to pulled pork and have never cooked it before.  It was so simple.  I learned that pork butt is the same as pork shoulder and that this method can be used with a high or low setting on the crock pot.  Also, you can't taste the coffee.  After having nothing left of 7 pounds of this recipe, my family of grown kids and their families requested it again 4 days later!!! I served it plain and we passed the mustard based BBQ sauce that we picked up "down south".  Made gravy with the broth and used it over rice.  You can bet that this is going to become a staple.  Thanks Sarge!!!

This recipe deserves a standing ovation! I used a little more beef broth, doubled the coffee. (Don't worry, you non-coffee drinkers will still enjoy this.) It was so tasty, I decided, why hide the flavor with BBQ sauce....Instead, I shredded the pork (it practically fell apart it was so tender!), made the flavorful broth into a gravy and served the pork open-faced on Kaiser rolls with the gravy drizzled over it! Add some scalloped potatoes and green beans on the side and sit back and enjoy the compliments. My husband was quite impressed!! Can't wait to make this again!! BRAVO!

I didn't have any beef broth, but I used beef consommee instead. It still turned out wonderful! The whole family liked it, and I'm going to make something with the leftovers tonight (maybe burritos like others suggested). We didn't even bother with barbecue sauce, and my 4yo son had a second sandwich.

Excellent!  Fool proof for an ameuter like me even!  I started on high in the slow cooker to eat that evening but since I forgot to plug it in, I decided to put it back on low and eat it the next day.  When I got up in the morning (about 10 hours after plugging it in) I realized it was on high.  Oops.  In spite of that, it wasn't even dry, but wonderfully tender and moist and just fell off of the bone.  I had added some liquid smoke and it tasted fabulous.  Used bbq sauce from Sticky Fingers and it was just perfect.  I can't wait to make it again.

Pork tenderloin was on sale this week, so thought I would try this recipe.  Don't care for BBQ sauce.  Followed the directions, but added rosemary and minced garlic (from the jar)to the crock pot. Used a LOT of pepper.  Shredded the pork, put it back in the crock pot with the juices and served it on a kaiser roll.  Yee-Hah!!  Husband said it tasted like the pork sandwiches served at his old Italian Parish picnics.  A true winner.  Thanks

This was sooooo good!  The coffee made me wonder but you'd never know that it was there.  Before I put the pork in the crock pot I browned the roast on all sides.  Turned out beautifuly. My husband will be buying pork roasts all of the time just for this meal.  Kids loved it too, a new family favorite!  Thanks Sarge!  Barb in BC, Canada

Ive made this many times. I make in the eve overnight in the crock pot and by morning the house smells delicious and the pork is  all cooked! Be careful to insure the crockpot is on low heat and keep anything potentially that might burn away from the pot at night. It does get quite hot!  I make exacty how recipe calls and it give you a lot of meat.

I found that the cooking time listed was not long enough.  I had to cook it longer until it was done.  I was dispappointed in this.  It was tasteless and bland.  I have had a lot better pork barbeque, even from the slow cooker before.

Great basic pulled pork. Don't overdo it on the cooking time though or your pork will be grainy and disintegrate.

This has become our "Go to Recipe" for pulled pork. The beauty of it is it is no fail and you can combine it with whatever BBQ sauce you prefer. We have a homemade sauce that is our favorite. We serve this almost any time we have a large get together. It is always well received.

I LOVE this! To season the pork, I used a texas rub and salt...then added a little extra broth and coffee than it called for. Top the sandwich with homemade coleslaw and this is FANTASTIC!!! I usually don't comment on recipes, but this is an absolute must have recipe!

I made this recipe as it is listed. It was REALLY good, juicy, and very easy to make.  I put it in the crock pot and walked away. It was even ready before we were, so I turned it off for about 45 minutes prior to us sitting down for dinner, which seemed to make no difference whatsoever.  I also really like that you can make the end product what you want.  I put out a couple kinds of BBQ sauce and a bowl of chipotle mayo so everyone could choose. Get rolls with crunchy crusts that can stand up to the juice!  Even my eats-birdlike-amounts mom had two sandwiches! This is a new family favorite!

Absolutely Loved this!  So moist.  I too added a touch of liquid smoke just for my own preference.  Great for a party or to have ready when the family gets home in the evening.  Thanks for this recipe.  Adding it to the recipe box!

WOW!! This recipe is FANTASTIC. I used pork ribs instead, added additional  seasonings, and used vegetable broth. Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly because it was my first time making pulled pork. The coffee gave the meat inside the slow cooker an awesome aroma, and I loved how it turned out!

This recipe was super easy and the pork was full of flavor. I've tried other pulled pork recipes that called for a ton of ingredients that didn't taste as good as this one.

Enjoyed this a lot! The only thing I added was a coating of Mccormick season salt. I also cooked it for 12 hrs instead of 8 because I had an older slow cooker.

Wonderful and so easy.  I use my own spices/rub for the pork but follow the rest of the recipe as stated.  It is tender and so good.  I like Sweet Baby Ray's for a sweeter sandwich.

Absolutely delicious! I used the amount of beef broth called for and skipped the coffee. Once done I took somebody else's advice and added about a cup of the broth back in the crockpot after chopping the meat, the bottle of bar-b-que sauce (KC Masterpeice) and allowed to cook another 30 minutes, in the crock pot. Really good on Martin's potato rolls!!

So easy and so good!  I used this recipe to turn some leftover pork roast into pulled pork.  I cut the pork roast into chunks and simmered it for an hour and a half on top of the stove in the beef broth and coffee mixture.  The pork was delicious as is, but we combined with with Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce for sandwiches.  We'll definitely be making this again!

This was the best thing ever. I made it for friends one night and everyone was coming over shaking my hand and telling me that they've never had pulled pork so good before. I did add some of my things in there. A few cloves of garlic, Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke and let it all cook for a bout 9 hours in slow cooker. I also made BBQ sauce that's on this site (Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce) They are heaven together and even the left over is still amazing.

Really easy and good! I couldn't find a butt roast so I used a loin end roast. I didn't change a thing otherwise, except skipped the salt, and rubbed with finely chopped garlic instead. When the roast was done I skimmed the fat off the drippings and strained them. After I shredded the meat I put about 1/2 cup of the strained drippings over the meat and returned to the slow cooker. I served this with Cattlemen's Classic BBQ sauce and Pat's Baked Beans recipe from this site. Quick, simple, and most tasty!

Sarge, I'm from S.C. and pulled pork originated on the east coast. Sounds like you are familiar with southern style cooking. As you indicated in your recipe, pulled pork is not to be cooked WITH THE BBQ sauce! Cook the meat, add coleslaw and BBQ sauce on a bun and WOW! We use mustard based BBQ sauce. You can order it online from Maurice's in Columbia, S.C.

This was the tastiest pulled pork I've ever fixed.  After watching the AR video I added four or five drops of liquid smoke, since I had some.  We will be making again.

I prepared this recipe for the 1st time last week for a pot luck gathering and it turned out great! I used a 5 lb pork butt bone in. Added 2 tsp liquid smoke as others have suggested; also added 1 sm onion quartered and 2 cloves of garlic to pot and slow cooked overnight (8 hrs). I have an oval shaped low cooker. Drained,took out onion etc and pulled the pork. I then added Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce to the pork as most suggest, but thought it too sweet, so heated up some Everett & Jones Mild BBQ sauce and made it available to ladle over the pork once put on the bun. It's a great combo of sweet and favor. Um Yum!! 5 lbs of pork butt fed 15-20 people easy. I used soft sweet rolls and cut them in half.  I'll be making this again in a couple of weeks.  This is a keeper recipe for me.

This smells terrible while cooking, but it tastes awesome!  I drained the juices out before adding the BBQ sauce after cooking.  I will make again!

Delicious! The only thing I did different is:  1) I rubbed the roast with garlic salt, salt and pepper. 2) Cut up a medium onion and put it under the roast in the crock pot. 3) Speared the roast (2.5 lbs) with frersh, whole garlic cloves I used 6 cloves..   I cooked it on high for five hours and then two hours at low. Drained the broth and onions out and added a bottle of Sweet Rays' BBQ Sauce. Yummm... :-)

WOW!  I made this for a 4th of July get-together and even the people who don't like BBQ gobbled this up.  I used spare-ribs (they were on sale) and I've never in my life had my BBQ come out this nicely.  The coffee really gave it a richness and a nice flavor.  The night before I put it in the slow-cooker, I rubbed it with plain mustard and some spices (salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika) and let it sit overnight before cooking it.  I don't know if this helped or not, but it all turned out very well.  Thanks, Sarge!!

Great recipe, I've made several times with rave reviews.  Couple changes:  cut pork into large chunks (saves using cleaver at end and hastens cook time), omit coffee, add liquid smoke, add garlic.

I'm from Memphis and we are picky about  our BBQ.  I was skeptical about this as it is so easy, but I made it for a large group of Memphis savvy BBQ lovers and they all loved it.  No, it is not AS GOOD as BBQ slow cooked in a pit, but that is not really an option for most of us to do at home.  This is the best alternative I have ever tried and almost everyone at the party wanted the recipe.  I did it as written.  Did not have liquid smoke but will use that next time to get a little of that smoky flavor.  Even if you are a "cook" like me, don't turn your nose up at this thinking it is too easy to be good.  It is delicious and worth 5 stars considering easy of preparation to finished product.  The perfect crowd pleasing food!

Absolutely delicious. I served it 2 ways. One as called for made with just enough sauce to pull together and then serving extra sauce on side.  Also, served with a lot of sauce all mixed in right away.  Preferred first method as with the second method, all I could taste was the sauce.  I also added smoked flavor.

Great recipe but you don't need that much liquid in the slow cooker.  I cut back the beef broth and coffee to 1/2 and it turned out great!

SO easy and good. I add some BBQ sauce while cooking and then add to taste after pork is pulled. Don't discard juice - after pulling slowly add juice to your desired consistency. My husband likes this very saucy, so I add all the juice back in.

This was a great recipe - I used 1 cup of beef brother, Worcestershire sauce, and salt & pepper. I cooked it for 8 hours in slow cooker, shredded it, then added BBQ sauce. My family ate all of it.

This was so simple and couldn't have turned out better! I added some spices that weren't called for in the recipe and after "pulling" the pork, put it back in the crockpot with a couple cups of the cooking liquid and some barbecue sauce.  Served it with the Zesty Coleslaw and Texas-Style Beans from this web site, and my family loved it.  This would work great for a crowd.

Super easy and delicious.  I made this recipe a couple years ago with a higher quality cut of pork since it was on sale and thought it was good but not great.  I think the key to the tastiest BBQ pork is using the butt roast or shoulder roast (which is what I used this time).  Husband couldn't stop raving about it, and it made tasty leftovers as well.

This was terrific and sooo easy! I followed the recipe and after six hours, the meat was literally falling apart. I took it out of the slow cooker, shredded it, then put it back in for another hour with a bottle of Kraft Hickory BBQ sauce. I also added back in some of the broth after draining off the fat. It was delicious! We had friends over for dinner that night and they called a couple of days later wanting the recipe because they were still craving it.

Yum, this was fantastic!  This couldn't have been any easier.  I thought the coffee was weird but I didn't taste it.  The first time I followed the recipe except I only used 3 1/2 pounds of pork and cooked it for six and a half hours.  The second time I did two 2 1/2 pound pork shoulders and used a can of french onion soup and half a beer, left them in for almost ten hours, pulled the fat off, and used a whole 28 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Rays.  Served on hamburger buns with cole slaw.  Mmmm!

EZ and Pleaz-EE! I followed the directions as written (next time will take some hints from the trusty reviewers) but cooked it in a crock pot on low and added liquid smoke which was key in giving it that smokey bbq flavor. We served it with Famous Daves Tex Pit BBQ sauce on kaiser rolls- a great combo. Next time I will definitely return to crock after shredding and let it re-absorb some of the au-jus...the meat got dry quickly but had great flavor.
All in all- a definite recipe to repaeat; my hubby loved it and I froze half in the au jus for a snowy-I don't want to cook-day.

I changed the coffee to 1/2 cup, and added a good dash of Liquid Smoke. This made an excellent pulled pork sandwhich after topping it with a sweet slaw, and severed it with Bourbon Baked beans.

This review is way past due...I did not realize I hadn't given it one.  WOW!!  So super easy.  I wasn't sure exactly how the recipe read and after reading a few reviews the only thing I changed was, after it is cook (which I cooked more like 12-14 hours) I drained most of the broth off of it before adding my BBQ sauce.  Pulled Pork has always been one of my husband's favorites, now he doesn't have to wait till we go out to order it!!  I've made this at least a dozen times and it turns out fabulous every time.  Thanks for the  wonderful recipe.

This turned out very well!  The pork was tender and easy to pull apart.  A few things I did:  1. I did not feel like brewing coffee, but I might try it next time.  Instead I added about 1/3 cup cider vinegar to the beef broth.  2. While I was shredding the pork, I removed any large portions of fat.  There's nothing worse, in my opinion, than getting ready to enjoy a big bite of tender meat, and instead getting a mouthful of slimy fat.  At first I tried carving away some of the fat, but that took a long time.  It was easier to remove after cooked.  3. The sauce.  (These measurements are not exact but close.) I added 1 cup barbecue sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 teaspoons yellow mustard, and 1 Tablespoon brown sugar.  Added the sauce and threw it all back in the cooker for another hour.  Each person can add their own additional barbecue sauce at the table.
Served with homemade rolls.

AMAZING!  

I use this recipe everytime!  After cooking, I shred the pork, drain most of the juice, put it back in the slow cooker, and add a bottle of my fav bbq sauce.  (sometimes I add more juice back in to keep it moist)

This has been a HUGE hit at all my parties.

I skipped the coffee ingredient, but followed the recipe aside from that.  It was easy and great!  My whole family enjoy it, and with the slower cooker it became a quick weeknight meal.

This is so easy to make. I do it in the crockpot often during football season, since nothing comes between me at my Patriots! After reading the reviews, I made, and stick to, the following changes:  Double coffee, 2 tsp. - 1 T. Liquid Smoke, Garlic Salt, Pepper. When pork is ready, drain liquid, then add 1/2 - 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and cook for 20 more minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly as directed, and was surprised at how well it turned out.  It really doesn't need all the extras other reviewers have included.  I'd do this one again and again for a delicious and reliable standard chicken.

Holy Moly!!  This is awesome - 10 stars!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 3 lb. pork shoulder roast.  After 7 hours on low, it literally fell apart and I couldn't help myself - I ate some and now I can't wait for dinner.  The meat is so good by itself that I'm going to serve it as is with the BBQ sauce on the side rather than mixing it all up like I usually do for pulled pork sandwiches.  My family will be all over this one.  Thank you!

This was about the easiest meal I ever made....and it was a big hit! Something about the coffee probably gives the meat a smoked flavor, and piling on Grampa Dave's Texas Chainsaw Bar-B-Que Sauce finished it off just right. Hoo-Rah, Sarge!

I've never attempted pulled pork before, so I was amazed at how great this came out. I've only ever cooked tenderloin, so I had some fear about the butt/shoulder roast. I cut a 4 lb roast in half, followed the recipe (well, I didn't have as much time as suggested, so I did 2 hrs on High and 4 hrs on low) and after "pulling" half of the roast, I realized I didn't need to shred the other half--I could actually save it to use for another meal! How awesome is that?? The roast came out so tender and half of it (2 lbs) fed 3 adults and 2 kids. Served with Restaurant-Style coleslaw and Chip Truck fries (both from this site), this was a terrific summer-time meal that I will definitely make again and again. I'm still so excited about the idea of getting two meals from a $7 roast, I can hardly stand it!! Now I just have to decide what to do with the other half...tacos, enchiladas, hmmm...Thanks Sarge!

I will NEVER buy pulled pork again!  This is so easy and cheap to make I don't know why anyone would go and buy it already made...  I put my roast in the crock pot before I went to bed last night and woke up to a fall apart tender pork roast.  It almost shreds itself!  Use this recipe, it's awesome!  I used Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce from this site, both recipies are keepers!

This was delicious, but I simplified it a lot.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and just put the pork in the slow cooker covered with plain bbq sauce all day long, after about 10 hours or so we pulled the meat away from the fat and shredded it a bit, it was so tender and moist.  We put it all in a casserole dish, poured the bbq sauce + juices from the slowcooker over it, and cooked it in the oven at a low temp, covered in foil, for another hour until folks arrived.  We used kaiser buns and also topped it on the sandwich with more bbq sauce, sweet baby rae's, which was fine straight out of the fridge and not warmed up.  We used 4lbs boneless pork and it was enough for 10-12 sandwiches.  Also excellent when reheated.  YUM!

this was so good, but all i did was put the pork shoulder in the crock pot with 1/2 bottle of bbq sauce and let it go for 8 hours.  i drained off that juice, "pulled the pork," added the pork back to the crock pot, added some more sauce and warmed it for another 30 minutes.  easy and very good.

5+  This is one of my favorite recipes. I've made this dish a dozen times and get rave reviews every time I serve it.
Great just as it is, but I have tried substituting the beef broth with French onion soup for a little different flavor, also excellent.  Don't have beef broth on hand?...chicken broth works just as well.  Very versatile and excellent every time. I've tried with pork loin roast - the taste is still good, but it's a bit dryer due to the lower fat content in the meat.  Thanks for an awesome recipe to add to my regulars!

Can't say enough about this recipe, great results.  I omitted the coffee, and just because of timing cooked it much longer (15 hours on low) but it was the most tender and delicious meat I have ever eaten.

Easy and delicious.....doesn't get much better than this!

Nice and easy pulled pork.  The longer you cook, the better it is.  I use a nice homemade BBQ sauce to compliment this recipe.  I add some garlic, onions, etc. to the broth.  I then use it afterward as a pork stock for soup or whatever else.  Easiest way to do pulled pork.

There are some great tips. I decided to try this recipe and add apple sauce instead of the coffee. It was delicious! I used the crock pot on high for 5 hours idea. Pork just fell part. It had a wonderful apple flavor. It’s a great tail gate idea too!!

My husband loves pulled pork sandwiches, and he says this one is a keeper.  I just added garlic powder,paprika and a dash or two of liquid smoke,let the crock pot do its thing...shred the meat, add some of the cooking liquid then finish  it off with KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce and it was good to go. Thanks for such simple recipe!

Made it in my crock pot, which I have used all of two times in 3 years.  I trimmed that big outer layer of fat off the pork shoulder (8 lbs by the way), and I cooked it overnight on low for 10 hours with a half a can of broth, a bottle of bbq sauce, and some cider vinegar that I used to rinse out the bbq sauce bottle (no coffee).  I had salted and peppered the roast before hand.  What I saw this morning at 6 AM was the most amazing tender meat I have ever seen.  I literally pulled the bones out of the pot before I even tried to get the meat out because it all fell apart.  I was left with a really good amount of liquid, which I refrigerated and have defatted, and it is going to be served with the pulled pork tonight.  I may add more vinegar to it to give it a little more kick.  Outstanding, hands down the easiest thing I have ever made, makes me want to look into using my crock pot a little more.

This recipe is awesome! My first time making pulled pork BBQ and I couldn't have picked a better recipe. I used a 5lb. boneless pork tenderloin. After the meat was cooked, I shredded it in a 9x13 dish and tossed with a little bit of BBQ sauce and some left over juices and heated up in 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes. My whole family loved it!

I must admit I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  I used a can of french onion soup instead of beef broth.  I also used a few drops of liquid smoke instead of coffee.  That was what I had on hand.  It was still good.

Delicious! I trimmed  the layer of fat from the bottom of the roast - this is easier to do when the roast is partially frozen. I poked several holes in the pork halves with a meat fork; added paprika and granulated garlic to the rub - exact quantities were 2TBL   paprika, 2 TBL salt, 1TBL granulated garlic. Once rub was applied, I sprinkled roast with black pepper.  I increased the coffee to 1/3cup and cooked on high for 6 hours. I added baby carrots during last hour of cooking time, and thickened the sauce with 3 TBL corn starch mixed in a small bowl of ice cold water. Mix the cornstarch until completely dissolved and pour into slow cooker.  It will thicken as it heats.  I served this roast with steamed white rice.  My husband, kids and grandkids said it was the best roast they'd ever eaten. We'll use the leftovers for shredded pork sandwiches or shredded pork tacos. This recipe is a keeper!

This was the first time I made pulled pork and it was so easy and so good.  But one problem I had was that after mixing the juices with bar-b-que sauce and then mixing it into the pork, the pork became sort've mushy.  It tasted great, but it was (as another reviewer stated) sort've a pate.

What I love about this dish is: it's so easy!! You can put it together before you head for the office and when you get home *viola* you have your meal. Just add rolls, and sides. I serve with baked beans and potato salad.

Loved this.  Did if for my Super Bowl Party.  The only thing I'd note is that depending on your cooker size, you'll want to add either some more water or broth to cover all the meat.   I used a Pork Loin and everyone loved it.

This is THE best pulled pork recipe I've ever had. and I'm not the only one who thinks so. My coworkers are still raving about it. I added 3 dashes of rice wine vinegar in the crockpot which made it even more tender. DE-LISH!

Very good. We rubbed the roast with a pork seasoning mix. I added a bunch of whole peeled garlic cloves and a touch of liquid smoke and let it cook overnight. We live in a small place, and it smelled so delicious that we couldn't sleep :) After about 14 hours, I used a slotted spoon to separate out the pork from the liquid and am letting it sit on low for another hour or so. Already taste-tested and it's amazing. Thanks!

I love this recipe!  I have made it 3 times now, once for 30 people on a beach vacation.  It is such a hit!  We double the coffee, season with garlic and pepper, and add 2 tsp. liquid smoke.  At the end we add bbq sauce.  It has become my most requested meal with friends and family.

This was great!  After reading all of the other reviews I decided I had to try it for myself.  I used 2/3 cup coffee and 2 teaspoon liquid smoke.  AFter i shredded the meat i put it back in the slow cooker with about 1.5 cups of the broth and 1/2 a bottle of sweet baby ray's bbq sauce like others had recommended.  We really enjoyed this!  thanks

Great, easy recipe. AFter shredding the pork, I added about half a bottle of good CArolina style vinegar bbq sauce and put it back in the crock pot. Soooo delicious and couldn't be easier.

I used a boneless pork shoulder roast.  After I shredded the meat, I added some of the liquid from the pot and some smokey barbecue sauce.  Very very good.

I have made this recipe 4 times now and every time I get rave reviews. I only made a small change and that was to add more coffee.  I used 1 can of beef broth to 1 cup of instant or regular coffee. They both work. So good!

Christopher, with some minor additions like onion/garlic powders and as others suggested, worst. sauce and more importantly liquid smoke, this dish was sensational!! I added more broth than suggested because I wanted more juice for dipping purposes; similar to a french dip. The flavor of this dish was so darn incredible. Me, being a non meat eater (nothing political) kept nibbling little pieces of the pork. Served this on great Italian rolls and my family went crazy over this. My daughters boyfriend even made himself two sandwiches for his lunch tomorrow. This was an excellent change from the ho- hum, so what else is new, typical barbeque sauce stuff. Thanks so much for sharing a restaurant quality recipe!!

So easy and so yummy!  I didn't have any coffee or beef broth, so I used salt pepper, chicken broth and took the advice of others and added 1 1/2 TBS of liquid smoke - amazing!

My husband said this is better than the pulled pork at our local barbecue restaurant.

I used a pork shoulder roast and cut the fat off it before cooking. Based on the other reviews, I increased the coffee to 1 cup, used one 10 oz. can of double strength beef broth, and 1 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke. It turned out great, but next time I think I'll use a less fatty cut of meat. I removed most of the visible fat, but the meat was still very rich (too rich for me, but not for my hubby).

I served it with Trader Joe's barbecue sauce, rolls, and creamy spiced coleslaw (from allrecipes).

Great recipe!  I trimmed most of the fat off of the pork butt roast before I put it in the slow cooker and it came out great....meat fell off the bone and I had no trouble removing the little bit of fat that was left on the meat. I did put some barbecue sauce in with the beef broth and coffee. After the beef was pulled I served it on buns with a selection of barbecue sauces.  Each person could add the barbecue sauce of their choice in the amount they wanted.  This recipe is a keeper.

Effortless and Delicious.  I bought a 4lb boneless pork butt left it whole and cooked on low for 8hrs.  Shredded and added Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  Best pork pulled pork.  Next time I will trim off the fat because when I shredded it fell apart so easily that the fat was hard to sift out.

I followed the recipe as written, and it turned out fabulous!  We added our favorite BBQ sauce to the mix, then placed it in the over for about 15 minutes.  We put the pork over toasted buns, and we still had a TON of pork left over.  It was even better the next day.

Very good!  I used a pork loin roast and hardly had any fat like others were complaining of with the other cuts.  I seasoned with garlic and added a half cup of brewed coffee although I'm not really sure what it did for the meat.  After cooking, I poured off the broth (freezing it to use later), shredded the meat and added a homemade BBQ sauce then put it back in the slow cooker on low for half an hour.  Very tasty!

We had to use Pork Loin but it was still very good.  I love pulled pork but I am not a fan of bbq sauce so this was perfect.  My husband did add bbq sauce to his and also loved it.  It was so easy and I can't wait to make it again.

Fantastic. I followed this recipe, and then shredded the pork and mixed in an entire bottle of barbeque sauce and heated it through in the oven. It disappeared so fast my head spinned!

Very easy but pretty bland. Needed liquid smoke and more seasoning than just salt and pepper, I thought.  Shredded nicely and when mixed with BBQ sauce, it made decent sandwiches.

Very bland, leaves pork dry and unpalatable. Needs a major dose of spices (at least three or four) to make it edible.

This recipe is excellent!  I used it to make an 8 lb. pork shoulder.  After pulling the meat off the bone, I returned the pulled pork to the crock pot and mixed in a bottle of BBQ sauce, letting it cook for another 3 to 5 hours on low, stirring occasionally.  I brought it to our company's potluck lunch and it was the first dish to go.

Great work, Sarge!!! I don't drink coffee, so I buy a cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee just for this on the day I make this terrific recipe.  So easy and so worth it.  I love to use my slow cooker year round to save on electricity bill in summer for air conditioning and the save on cooking gas in the winter.  Not to mention, you can use cheaper cuts of meat and have them come out so tender after hours in the slow cooker.

This recipe could not be easier.  I used pork tenderloin and left it in for about 6-7 hours.  I also put in a little bit of liquid smoke which made it taste awesome.  It's really important to pepper the meat before you start.  My boyfriend was really excited about this dish, we used Bullseye bbq sauce after it was done, and my dad loved it with CarbWell bbq sauce, since he is diabetic.

Good! Unfortunately, I had to leave out the coffee since I didn't have any. But the pork roast cooked to perfection in the beef broth. When it was done, I poured off the broth and put the pork back in the slow cooker and shredded it. Then I let it cook for another hour on low with some KC Masterpiece Honey Smoke flavored BBQ sauce. We put it on buns and had some delicious pork sandwiches. (I topped mine with cole slaw). I had been craving this type of sandwich, and am not able to find them in my new city. (For the cole slaw I used the Restaurant-Style Coleslaw recipe also on this site). Thank you!

I read all the reviews and this recipe is just like everyone says, absolutely delicious! I added 1 tablespoon liquid smoke for the added flavor. I let everone add BBQ sauce to their portion if they wanted so I could make enchiladas with the leftover. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have made this twice already and it is a perfect recalso because the ingredients are easy and so is the slow cooker. I have also added liquid smoke  to make it taste BBQ and some garlic and onion powder. Love it!!!

Super tender for sure. Definitely save some of the sauce, even if it is runny, because without it the pork is too dry.

Delicious! I made this when we went camping (I know, not really "roughing it" with a crock pot in the trailer!) and everyone loved it! I didn't use any coffee, just beef broth. About an hour before we were ready to eat, I shredded the pork (which was a cheaper cut than suggested), removed most of the beef broth, and then added in Bullseye BBQ sauce. I added a bit of the broth back in afterwards to maintain the consistency/moisture I was looking for. Then just let it cook on low until we were ready to eat!

I tried this recipe today, thought it sounded easy and I was curious how it would turn out. Put it in the crockpot, set it on high for one hour, then dropped it to low for another four hours. It was amazing, tender, juicy, and unbelievably flavorful. I started with a seven pound pork butt, with a double dose of beef bouillon and a half cup of strong black coffee. I love pork, and this is one of the best meals I've ever had with pork. Ridiculously easy, awesome recipe!

Have done this recipe 3 times now with a 5 lb Boston Butt and it's been a huge hit each time, but with a twist.  I start out with a memphis-type rub that has brown sugar, salt, garlic, pepper and cayenne.  Rub that on liberally then hickory smoke at about 225 degrees for 2 hours.  Take it off the smoker, into the crock pot on low using this recipe.  After pulling the pork I use a very small amount of sauce or none at all and serve with the crock pot warm.  

My tendency is to add too much liquid to the crock pot.  The meat will produce its own juice so go easy on the beef broth and coffee.  I personally like the coffee.  It does seem to add something with the hickory smoke flavor that helps the final product.

Such an easy recipe and with fantastic results!  I used Green Mountain Dark Magic coffee and a can of beef broth over a pork roast.  I added one onion, sliced, to the bottom of the slow cooker and seasoned the pork with garlic salt, pepper and a bit of seasoning sauce.  I was generous with the spices, to make sure all parts of the pork were covered.  I cooked it on low for 10 hours, removed the liquid and separated the pork with a fork.  The onions basically melted into the pork, adding even more flavor.  I put the pork back into the slow cooker and set it on warm while I waited for dinner to start.  As for the liquid, I let it cool to remove the fat and then basted the pork as needed while it kept warm in the slow cooker.  I cannot wait to have leftovers today!

Yum!  Crockpot does the work for you.  I also put a bit of barbeque and brown sugar over the roast while it cooked.  Shredded meat and then added barbeque sauce.  The family could not get enough!

This turned out great! I made this for my wedding reception buffet and everyone was raving about it. I threw the pork roast into a large slow cooker before I went to bed and pulled it when I woke up. (the house smelled amazing that morning!) I added Big Al's K.C. BBQ sauce after pulling the pork, and served it with a bowl of the bbq sauce on the side. Will definitely be making this again.

Very simple to put together.  I like adding your own BBQ sauce at the end.  I really couldn't taste the coffee but it didn't hurt a thing to put it in.  Might add a bit more next time .. 50% coffee, 50% broth.  Nice and tender.  A fun Saturday night supper after doing house and yard work all day.

This was really good.  I did add 1 tsp of liquid smoke to the mixture and was glad that I did.  I don't think that the coffee really added much but we did use BBQ sauce with it so it may have been masked.  I will use this recipe again!

Making this in the slow cooker is the only way to go.   I used beer instead of beef broth and coffee, and it turned out great.   I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

I really like this recipe.  It's simple and really good.  I thought with so few ingredients it might be bland but that is not the case at all!  I like how it's not cooked with bbq sauce so my husband and I can add our own (he likes ketchup based, I prefer mustard based).

This pulled pork turned out great! I did change it quite a bit though...I put about a half cup beef broth and about a half bottle of bbq sauce in the slow cooker with the pork...I omitted the coffee after reading some reviews that it didnt make much of a difference!

Very easy! I love the fact that it requires no bbq sauce in the crock pot because I think it makes the bbq sauce taste burnt! Followed the recipe, just added liquid smoke like video suggested (based off of reviews). Thanks!

It did get really soupy, and there really wasn't any flavor.  The next time I will try what the other review said:  Just throw the pork in with a bottle of BBQ sauce.

Great easy recipe! I added 2 tablespoons of liquid smoke and rubbed a boston butt with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I placed it in the crockpot the night before the party and it turned out fantastic. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it! So easy! Will probably add some more seasoning next time just to kick it up a bit, but it made a fabulous sandwich! Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This is great. I had a 5lb boston butt. I added garlic to the rub and some liquid smoke to the pot and followed the recipe. I went to 6flags for the day and this thing sat on low all day, 10 hours. It is fantastic.

Wow!!!  Best thing that my crockpot has ever turned out!  Super moist and tender.  I followed other members suggestions and added 2 tbs. of liquid smoke. In addition to the liquid smoke I stuffed some garlic slivers into the pork butt, added BBQ sauce, dried onion, and a dash of vinegar.  I rubbed the pork with Rudy's dry rub as well. I also basted the pork throughout.  All in all, it was divine.  Thank you, Sarge!

This really is *EZ* and very delicious too! I cut it in half the night before cooking and rubbed it with the salt, pepper and also some fresh minced garlic then put it in the fridge in a gallon size ziploc till the morning. I put it in the slow cooker before work and only used the beef broth but it was still very moist and flavorful! Next time I will add the coffee too since the last reviewer says that adds another depth to the flavor! Thanks so much Sarge! I can't believe something so simple with so few ingredients could smell so great while cooking and taste even better!! This will be a regular meal in our house. FYI: Next time I'm planning to add a little liquid smoke also to make it taste even more authentic.

This was the highlight of our 4th of July BBQ! I did not use the coffee and only used about half of the beef broth. My pork butt was fatty enough to keep it moist during cooking. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce and it turned out amazing!

The Pork Pulled apart Perfectly. You really Need a Great BBQ Sauce To Add to The Meat once You Remove It From The Broth.   On A Soft Roll With Coleslaw On Top ... Yummo

This was so incredibly easy that I was embarrassed to pass on the recipe!  Next time I will add more broth so that the meat is covered.  Also, I think the key is the BBQ sauce.

OMG - this was awesome! I followed the recipe as written and added a few more spices of my own - garlic salt, smoky paprika, liquid smoke and some cajun seasoning.  My intentions were to make BBQ (sauce)sandwiches, but the meat was so tender, juicy and tasty that we ended up eating the meat by itself!  It would have been a shame to cover up the taste with sauce! After 8 hours of cooking, the meat was tender enough to eat, but we had a baseball game and nobody wanted to eat before we left. So I kept it cooking for another 4 hours and that made a huge difference - I couldn't even pick it up - the meat fell right off the bones.  I will definitely make this again.  I might even try adding sauce some time  - but maybe not!

I was looking for a recipe for slow-cooked pork that didn't use a lot of ingredients. This was so good. The broth and coffee add depth to the flavor of the pork; but don't over-power it. Ate it on tortillas first night. I'm freezing the rest and sevring it later as bbq pork. Will definately make often.

OK, we all know that "real" BBQ is cooked low & slow over hot coals. Fine; but if you don't happen to have a BBQ pit, this recipe will give you a very tender & juicy product. Choose a tangy BBQ sauce & serve with a crunchy cole slaw w/ finely chopped Vidalia onion. Thank you "Sarge" - you rock!

This recipe is definitely a "no fail" recipe. I've been making it for a years now and it is "Excellent".  I too as another reader stated would give this recipe a "10".  It is so simple and carefree that it leaves you time to make dessert too :-)  Use store bought BBQ or make your own. I love making my own Thick BBQ Sauce and slow cook it in the sauce the last 2 hours.  There is nothing not to like about this recipe - Buona Appetito!!

Tender & moist are just the beginning of this recipe. Simple and easy and the ending. Loved it! The only changes I made was I used one cup of coffee and garlic pepper seasoning on the roast before putting it in the slow cooker. Thanks for a easy and cheap family favorite.

This was Awesome!  I think my husband's first comment was "Mama Mia".  The meat was so tender and falling apart, that I had trouble getting it out of the crock pot.  I made just as directed, and now will try as reviewer suggested....without the coffee or broth and just the BBQ sauce. While the meat is VERY tender, it definitely needed a BBQ sauce to give it flavor.  I think the most important thing I will take from this recipe is the cut of meat to use.....I never know what cut of meat should be used for what....and I think that is what made this recipe good and tender!

I was referred to this recipe as a simple yet delicious Pulled Pork recipe and I was not disappointed!  I used a 7lb shoulder and skipped the coffee.  We left it in the crock for about 12 hours before pulling it, then added it back into the pot with some BBQ sauce.  DH and I sampled the meat before and after the BBQ and both times were simply delish!!  Once adding the BBQ sauce, I could probably eat the meat cold its that good!  Thanks so much Sarge :)

I tried this recipe this weekend to serve to family and friends.  Everyone enjoyed it.  My teenager asked me to make it again!  I shredded the pork and then chopped it with a clever and refrigerated it overnight  I then rewarmed it the next day in a covered casserole with some of the saved dripping added.  about 15 minutes prior to serving I added BBQ sauce (just a little to moisten).  Served on small kaiser rolls with BBQ and horseradish on side.  Very good.

DH loved this.  The butt I used was quite fatty, so spent about 30 minutes trimming it up before putting it in the slow cooker.  Thank you previous reviewers.  Used your suggestion and added a bottle of sauce after it was finished and kept it warm in the slow cooker.  Served with coleslaw and dill pickle sandwich slices all on the buns.

This was amazing!  The pork absolutely fell off the bone.  We added some vinegar based sauce to the pulled pork for wonderful sandwiches.  Thank you for the super easy and delicious recipe!

This was excellent! I was cautious because I didn't know how the coffee would make it taste, but there was no hint of a coffee type flavor. The meat was liiterally falling apart...it was so tender and smelled so good! I used pork shoulder and rubbed with salt, pepper and garlic. Thje excess fat from the shoulder portion was no big deal becasue of the tenderness of the meat it was so easy to seperate. Used KC Masterpiece barbecue sauce when it was done...eaten up in a day!

This was AWESOME!  I've never made pulled pork before, but this tasted like I was a pro!  I followed the recipe exactly, and at the end, drained the liquid, shredded the pork, and added a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, and heated through.  I served on hearty wheat rolls, and topped with homemade cole slaw.  This was a HUGE hit with my family.  Definitely a keeper!!

This recipe was awesome. As recommended by others, I added some liquid smoke to the crock pot. It turned out fantastic. I made some German Coleslaw, and we used Bishop's BBQ Sauce (vinegar based bbq sauce). It tasted just like Whitt's BBQ from back home. My husband loved this too. I've already recommended it to all my friends. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my favorite & the easiest pulled pork recipe I have ever made.  Everyone who eats it loves it.  Don't change a thing, except maybe double it so you have lots of leftovers!

This recipe is great. Add a teaspoon of liquid smoke when you are adding the broth and coffee.  It gives it a great depth of flavor.  Very delicious with a side of coleslaw.

I was amazed at how easy this recipe was to make. You follow the directions and let it go.  I cut the meat in 3rds to make it a little easier to handle.  Boy was this good and it really goes a long way.  I can't wait to make it for my family when the boys come home from over seas.

Excellent!

Served it on boring hamburger buns & still saw my SIL eat 2!!!  (She's not a big eater, either! a waif of a girly) 
Defatted mine before adding Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy sauce, served up for Labor Day get-together.  Wonderful with cole-slaw on top!!!  yummy.
Even had some today for lunch, extra yummy on GOOD rolls!!!

Used this recipe for the cooking part and it was great.  I did notused the beef broth or coffee but instead used Al's KC BBQ sauce from this site--the sauce is awesome--but the saw broke down in the crock pot and became more like a stew than a thick sauce for pulled pork.  Luckily I reserved some of the BBQ sauce and was able to slap it on top after cooking--yum yum and so easy.  Do plan on using Christopher's version this winter...thanks for sharing.

WOW! I've made this recipe many times. Every one loves it and it's so simple.  The pork butt (shoulder)cut is the best.  It does take a little time to take the fat off once cooked, but it's a crowd pleaser.  It's simple and delicious. I add bottled BBQ sauce and a little vinegar before serving.

I made this for my son's 4th b-day party.  There was none left.  2 years later, I'm still asked to make it at every family gethering we have.  I end up making twice as much as needed just so I can have left overs.  It is wonderful!!  And the best part is, it's simple and very little work.

This one never fails.  The meat falls from the bones and the guests are always surprised when I tell them the secret ingredient is coffee.  This is a huge favourite here.  Thanks, Sarge!

Very easy and very good! The pork absolutely just fell apart.  I added some juice from the crock pot and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce when I was done and served it on toasted buns. I will definitely make again!

We were disappointed with this recipe.  I think the key to crockpot recipes must be marinating the meat or putting on a dry rub.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce but I don't think it would matter what sauce we used.  We didn't eat the leftovers.  Next time, I'll try a recipe that has a dry rub and I'll let it sit with the dry rub for a day.  Maybe liquid smoke would help but I've never used it before.

We cooked the roast for 6 hours and then drained the liquid, shredded the meat and smothered it in "Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce" from this site, and let it sit on low for another half hour. Heaven!

Wonderful!  Thank you for such an easy, and just great tasting recipe.  I didn't grow up eating pork, so I didn't know which cut of it to use to make pulled pork (which I have grown to LOVE), or how to cook it.  Used decaf coffee because we have a little one who we don't give caffeine to yet, but no other changes made to the recipe.  Just a note:  I was really worried about the amount of liquid when I started the recipe.  I thought maybe the meat would dry out without being completely covered in liquid - but it turned out just fine - no dryness at all.

The pork turns out well, but too soupy for my taste.  I would recommend draining it before shredding.  I don't make it this way anymore though, now I just use BBQ sauce and a little bit of root beer and it comes out just as good as this recipe.

I brought this in for a potluck at work today. Everyone said they loved it and there wasn't a bit left in crockpot so I guess they really did! This was super easy for a work pot luck, I just cooked it overnight and let it cool in the morning as I was getting ready. It was easy to shred it with a fork, put my own homemade BBQ sauce on it, take it to work and reheat it in the crockpot. Thanks Sarge! It's a keeper! :)

soooooo good. Can't go wrong with pulled pork, but I was amazed at how easy this was to make. I started with a seasoned meat as indicated in the recipe, then decided to ditch the coffee and broth idea and go right for hte bbq sauce. I just watered it down a bit to give enough moisture and let it rip. 8 hours later (could have been sooner, but we just wanted to over do it) we were in heaven! Enjoy this recipe please!

This recipe is so easy! I used a 6 lb. pork butt shoulder and put it in the crock-pot overnight (about 10 hours). Then next morning I shredded the meat, which was so easy - I barely had to do anything. The meat was so tender and moist. I put it back in the crock-pot on low for a few hours with the Eastern NC BBQ Sauce I found on this site. It was so delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

I would give it more stars if I could!  My husband just went bonkers over this and could not keep his hands out of the pot!!  Very easy to make and taste is delicious too and very tender!!!  I did omit the coffee and since I was only feeding 3 people, I used a 2.5 lb. roast and half a can of beef broth.  I should have made a 5 lb. one the way my husband attacked this!!  I didn't bother cutting the roast in half either.  Of course, I served this with coleslaw!  YUMMY!!!

This recipe is great with "Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce". I used beef broth and liquid smoke, but I ommitted the coffee. After cooking on low for about 10 hours I shredded the pork then added the sauce and let it simmer on warm setting for a couple more hours. It was fantastic!!

Excellent. Skipped the coffee, used the beef broth & half a bottle of good BBQ sauce. Drained & added rest of BBQ sauce added in & heated for 30minutes. Delicious and easy! Used Kaiser rolls and ate away!

I am at this moment making this for the second time. I like to drain off the liquid after it cooks for hours and hours, and I add Famous Dave's BBQ sauce. The last time I made it, I literally used one fork to shred the meat by just sticking the fork in and gently twisting. The meat was unbelievably tender! Thanks for a great recipe. :-)

I saw some people say they have not been able to find a sauce. Go try Big Al's KC BBQ sauce on this site. It has been reviewed like 80 times and everyone loves it. My family and I do not buy BBQ sauce anymore. We just make this. It is absolutely fantastic. Try it out if you are looking.

Very easy, smelled fabulous while cooking. The secret to Southern flavor tho is the bbq sauce and I have not found a really good sauce yet. But my family, who did not benefit from a childhood in the South, absolutely devoured it.

This was very good and easy. It makes a great base for making BBQ pork because there's not a lot of competing flavors.

I love this recipe.  It makes the best pulled pork ever.  I use the Eastern NC BBQ Sauce recipe to add to it for an authentic NC BBQ sandwich.

Very Easy, Incredibly good.  Few minor changes.  I used a large pork butt.  I cut the butt into large chunks and browned them in a pan.  Once browned,I cooked in a large stock pot.  I deglazed the pan the pork was browned in and poured the drippings in the stock pot.  Covered with water, 1 cup coffee, and bullion equal to the amount of water used.  Cooked on low for about 6 hours.  After it cooled a bit, I shredded the pork by hand in order to removed all the fat and such.  Stirred in a couple of bottle of Dinosaur Barbecue Sauce and cooked to warm up.  Yum Delicious!!!

This recipe was fantastic! I followed the directions exactly. When there was one hour left to cook, I drained the liquid and added the Vinegar Based BBQ Sauce (also on this site) and put it back on low for another hour. Now I can finally stop wishing I was going back to North Carolina just for the BBQ!

Easy and delicious!  After I pulled the pork,  I put it back in the crockpot with about a quarter of the juice and a half bottle of bbq sauce to give it a little zip. Those who wanted more bbq sauce added it when  they made their sandwiches. Everyone loved it!

This was so awesome!  The only thing I did different was I added a bottle of smokey mesquite bbq sauce to it about 30 mins before it was done. I ate it on big rolls with cole slaw. It was delish!

That was VERY VERY good! I added the liquid smoke also. It was the perfect touch. I simmered some Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and added some of the broth from the crockpot. That gave the sauce a smokey flavor too. We loved it!

Made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was delicious.  Used 1 cup beef broth, 1 cup coffee, fresh garlic and shallots and 1 TBSP of liquid smoke.  Have used the leftovers for tacos, sandwiched and a cous cous dish.  Will make this again and again - so easy.

We thought this was good.  I did use BBQ sauce after shredding but will also add some garlic to it next time as others suggested and cook it for at least 10 hours.

This recipe is very good and easy.  I agree with other reviews that the original recipe is fairly bland but it was okay for me because I added BBQ sauce anyway.  After I shredded the meat, I drained most of the juice out of the crockpot and added 1 bottle of BBQ sauce and cooked on low for another hour.  It was very good.

I increased the coffee to 1 1/2 cups. I have made this several times.  My family loves it.  Very simple, fast, and the ingredients are always available.  I also sprinkle Tone's Canadian Steak Seasoning(from Sam's Club) on the pork roast.

pretty good BBQ.  not the best I ever had, but not the worst either.  the "flavor" hadn't set in to the meat after the recommended cooking time, so I cooked it for another 24 hrs.  Better after more time under the heat (like most BBQ is).

This turned out great.  I used a 7# shoulder roast, but will add some liquid smoke next time.  After shreadng with a fork, I returned it to heat and added 2 cups of Bullseye barbeque sauce (kids love the bull) and it was quite tasty!

I'm not a good cook and just got married - needed something good for family, been batting ZERO. Family LOVED this, husband couldn't get enough of it and claimed leftovers for lunch next day. I changed nothing on recipe and couldn't believe how EASY this was to make. Totally effortless! Thanks!

Excellent!  I fixed 10 lbs. for a potluck and came home with an empty dish.  I did add onions, garlic and a little liquid smoke.  I didn't shred the meat, but "chunked" it for sandwiches.  Will definitely make this again!

I have made this many times with decaf coffee and love it. I have also found that this recipe works well with smaller cuts of pork too (pork chops, or whatever else is on sale...). Infact if your halved pork roast isn't getting as tender as you would like, try quatering the roast before cooking next time.

This recipe was perfect for our annual 4th of July camping trip.  The day before we left, I roasted the meat (I used a 6 lb. pork loin roast) in my Nesco roaster on the 'slow cook' setting for about 8 hours.  I followed the recipe exactly, and added garlic powder.  I fork-pulled the pork, and then packaged it up and put it in the cooler.  The next day at our camp site, I made a BBQ sauce on the Coleman stove, then added the meat and heated thoroughly.  I served on buns, with smashed potatoes and salad on the side.  Leftovers the next day were even better!  Thanks for the deliciously simple and easy recipe!

Easy, easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, with no additions, and it turned out great. Some reviewers have said that the pork was bland, but I was looking for something that would not compete with the very hot and spicy North Carolina vinegar barbecue sauce that I made and used with it (also from the allrecipes.com site). We enjoyed this so much I'm making it again tomorrow!

This Pulled Pork recipe is fantastic.  It's probably the easiest thing I've ever made for dinner.  I used the pork loin roast and liquid smoke as other reviewers suggested and it turned out GREAT.  The meat just fell right apart.  My husband (a very picky eater)ate the leftovers for days!!!  Thanks so much Sarge!!!

Very tasty.  I added a bit of kitchen bouquet to the crock pot and since I love coffee, and work at Caribou, I got a double shot of espresso to use instead of regular coffee.  mmmm.  Thanks so much for the keeper

Wow!  I wish I could give this more than 5 stars; it was awesome!  Since some expressed that this tended to be a bit bland -- and since we are ones to prefer things with a lot of flavor -- I used a cup of coffee instead of the 1/4 cup called for.  I added some kosher salt and a lot of pepper throughout the day; at the end of 6 hours, the roast fell apart, and it was delicious.  We enjoyed it for the big football game, and what a treat it was!  (Way to go, Steelers!)

This was really good and easy.  However, I added about 1 tbl of liquid smoke, it was necessary. Otherwise, it would have lacked flavor.  LIQUID SMOKE IS ESSENTIAL!

This recipe turned out wonderfully! I changed nothing, and the roast came out very moist, and very easy to shred. A 4 1/2 pound roast easily filled 8 oversized hamburger buns, and reheated very well, did not dry out at all. I used a Kraft bbq sauce, and just mixed the shredded pork in a bowl with the bbq sauce. Came out great. Thank you for the recipe, will definitely be keeping this.

This recipe is super simple and fabulous! I used the low setting on my crockpot and it still needed more time after seven hours though. Next time I'll up the heat a bit. I sent the recipe to my mother and she cooked it overnight in a 250 degree oven and said it was perfect and it was a hit at their SuperBowl party (my dad didn't want to share!) My kids loved it too with their favorite BBQ sauce.

I really liked the taste and consistency of the pork.  I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  I used the pork shoulder roast which is the same as the pork butt roast.  I followed the recommendations by some other reviewers and put the shredded meat back in the crockpot for an hour mixed with BBQ sauce, but one thing that we didn't like about that is the consistency of the meat from being stirred so much to mix the BBQ sauce in.  Next time, I will follow the original recipe of putting BBQ on the meat when you're putting the sandwich together.  Overall, very tasty and I would definitely make again.  I used a 3.5-4 lb. roast and we got 10 sandwiches or so out of it.  We used small hamburger buns.

There was nothing special about this. Definately use a different cut of pork. Pork butt roast just has WAY too much fat. You can't cut it out before cooking because the meat is too marbelized with it. The "great stock" you get for beef gravy is also way to greasy. I admit that it does fall off the bone and shreds easily, but the fat is just gross. Plus, when you put anything in a crock pot for 6-8 hours, of course it will be tender. I will not make this again. I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1 because my children liked it. I though it was just plain boring.

This one is a sure keeper.  I used a boneless loin roast about 2 1/2 pounds, so cut other ingredients in half as well.  Didn't have brewed coffee, used instant crystals - worked great.  Add your favorite barbecue sauce to this and you will see how fast it disappears!!  Great, thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe. I could not find a butt roast so I used a pork sirloin roast and it was wonderful. The meat just fell apart. I used some for bbq sandwiches and the rest was very tasty without anything on it.

We have a WINNER! I made this today, using Barbeque Sauce II from this site also, and turned out the best pulled pork sandwich we've ever had. After preparing it like the recipe called for, shredding it, and put it back in the crock with the BBQ II, letting it cook for about an hour more on low.

Not sure why all the raves. It was tender but that's what slow cooking does. I used loin instead of butt so maybe that was part of the problem but mine was real dry. It tasted fine but was much better with bbq sauce. Maybe next time I'll triple the coffee to give it more oomph.

Very nice juicy and tender meat. What I did after shredding pork with a fork. I drained excess broth out of slow cooker. Returned meat to cooker covered with homemade BBQ sauce and cooked on high until thoroughly heated. Served on crusty rolls as BBQ pork sandwiches with cole slaw and beans. Rave reviews from everyone. Next time will have to make more, so there are some leftovers.

A good, solid recipe for pork.  I did both a loin and a butt roast and found the butt roast results more to my liking.

I used the concept, but not the exact recipe.  I used a bottle of beer instead of the broth and also added some molasses.  Very good. I would definitely make this again.

This is probably the recipe I use the most from this web site. I have made it at least 6 times in the past 6 months. It is SO easy and tasty.  My husband is a hunter and we usually use a deer roast instead of pork, though we have had both and they both come out tasting wonderfully. I don't change a thing.......this recipe is perfect!  Thanks  =)

Wonderful smell, even better sandwiches. Boned the pork, trimmed off the fat. Was much like the pulled pork sandwiches in Annapolis, MD restraurant. Yummy.

This recipe was really good.  The pork came out wonderfully juicy and delicious by itself.  I added some bbq sauce from another recipe for beef brisket onto the pork and baked it a few minutes.  It was sooooo good.

What a simple slow cooker recipe. I used low sodium beef broth along with the coffee. I served this with the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce. The extra pork I will use for Brunswick stew. Thanks!

This is now a "go to" family favorite that never fails.  For the best flavor, use a pork roast with the bone in to get that extra goodness.  On occasion will add a tablespoon of liquid smoke, but that's up to personal preference.  Besides the family dinner table, it's an easy traveling dish for potlucks, funeral meals, feeding 4Hers, or little league groups.

This was an excellent roast!!!!  I seasoned mine with sea salt, pepper, garlic powder, & onion powder and seared it first.  Then added the broth and coffee in the crockpot.  It was absolutely delicious without any extra BBQ or any other sauce.

This is the easiest pulled pork recipe ever!
My husband smokes meat all the time but we like this just as much, and it's great for vacations to the lake when the smoker isn't available. 
Every time we make this we get compliments and people can't believe how easy it is! I've shared this recipe many times.
And kids seem to like this better than the smoked meat.

I followed the recipe except I added 1 tsp. Of liquid smoke at the beginning. It was a little bland but nothing that can't  be fixed by adding your own touches to it. All in all a pretty good basic recipe.

All I can say is yum. So good. I followed as written once cooked I shredded it, and put it back in the slow cooker spooned some of the broth back in crock so meat wouldn't try, and but bbq sauce. So good made this about 4x already always a hit.

This was a good base recipe for me. I like a smoky flavor, so I added 2 Tbsp liquid smoke, 1Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, and 1Tbsp each minced onion and minced garlic. I have an InstaPot pressure cooker, and I was on a time crunch, so I cooked it in my Pot. I sautéed it first, with salt & pepper, in a little olive oil, then poured in the liquid ingredients and spices. Since I had almost 10 lbs of meat, I cooked it on high pressure for 2 hours. So tender and juicy!!

AwEsOmE pulled pork!!! And yes--5 stars even with a couple small changes. I made it as-is a few times & it's very delicious. Then I actually read some other reviews and now I use 1 cup equivalent of instant coffee grounds, no water (there's already a lot of liquid to be drained off). I add a few cloves of garlic if I have it. A couple ounces of liquid smoke if I have it. Delicious every time! And sometimes I use a frozen roast if I didn't thaw it overnight

Living in Alabama has allowed our family to enjoy a tremendous amt of  award winning BBQ.  I followed the recipe exactly  and then at the end needed to add a generous amount of liquid smoke, maybe 10 teaspoons, I would have rated it 5 stars if didn't need LS.  Also, my pork butt was 5 lbs with bone in.  The texture, tenderness, and moistness was as delicious or better than many  professional pork plates we have enjoyed.  Super easy way to make one of our favorites.

I followed the recipe exactly the way it said to. I had friends over for dinner to be my guinea pigs because I'm making this recipe to feed over 100 people in November. Rave reviews from everyone. Since we are feeding so many people, several ladies will be cooking and I wanted us all to follow an ez recipe. Thanks so much!

This is an excellent recipe, I have used as written and I have changed a couple of things. First I have used my favorite BBQ rub put in the ref overnight then put in in the crock pot with the beef broth and coffee  for 8-10 hours in that process I also use a couple of tablespoons of liquid smoke but  it will depend on how smokey you want it sometimes I use more.  I use hickory it really does give it that smokey taste that's like a smoker, then when its done I pull it and add my favorite BBQ sauce.

The pulled pork was really delicious. Very tender that it  shredded nicely. I made this  dish  for Father's Day dinner & it was a hit. I didn't use coffee just the broth & added barbecue sauce  after  the meat was pulled apart & let simmer for about. 15mins. I will definitely be making this again

This was my first time making pulled pork. I didn't brown the meat, left out the coffee and added three garlic cloves and one shallot. I used a boneless pork butt roast that was tied in string. I left the fat on (with the fat on the top) and there was very little waste when it was all cooked. I was nervous about leaving my slow cooker on all night, but it was absolutely fine. I actually cooked it for about 10 hours on low. I thought my dog's nose might fall off from all the sniffing she did! The aroma was outrageous. I served this to friends with BBQ sauce on the side and they loved it.

I made it for the first time and followed most of the recipe. I didn't cut the 5 lb. roast in half when adding it to the slow cooker. Cooked it overnight on Low for 9 hours. Tasted great! Some of the other reviews were soooo helpful. I wouldn't have known to use my hands and pull all the fat off the pieces of pork. Mine would have been much too fatty if I hadn't read the reviews. I made it the day before my company came which was great so I wasn't rushed. I just had to warm it up with some barbecue sauce the next day. Served on rolls with slaw and baked beans. Was super!

Easy. In the crock pot overnight. Placed the meat & juices in another container in the refrigerator while at work. Skimmed off the congealed fat and shredded meat with bottled BBQ sauce.  Froze half of the shredded meat without BBQ sauce for future tacos and burritos. Needs something- perhaps cider vinegar.

Although we haven't tried this version yet, we do always use the slow cooker for pulled pork and it's absolutely the best way to go! Don't forget to put some cole slaw between the meat and buns!  (prepared shredded cabbage, little mayo, little salt and ground pepper  - Done!).

I prefer to cook pork butt in crockpot with adding just a can of beer. It will fall apart & I can choose to use part of cooked pork with just adding bbque sauce or use in my green chili Mexican cooking. (Of course you first remove bone & fat. ) suzaz60

My first time making pulled pork and it came out better than expected.  It was absolutely delicious!   The only thing I did was add a bit of liquid smoke.
I can't wait to make it again for a party.  Fed it to my best friend as a test and was pleasantly surprised how much we both enjoyed.

This recipe is so easy and amazing!!! I added somethings that other posters did, mainly garlic powder, onion powder, sage, a dash of paprika, and a bit of celery salt...I rubbed the pork with it and then seasoned the juice. For the juice I couple of dashes of liquid smoke, hickory flavor! My husband and friends LOVE it! I only did 2lb and I think my crock pot cooks fast, so it only took about 4 hours until the meat simply fell apart! Bravo, Sarge!

I have made pulled pork almost this same way for years.  I have never used the beef broth, which would probably add some depth, but water will work just fine.  If you put a layer of baby carrots on the bottom of the slow cooker and then add meat, it seems to add a nice subltle sweetness. (The carrots are delicious cooked this way.) If you like to utilize the meat for seperate meals, I use a generous amount of Cumin to the pork.  When it is done, I make pork tacos or "carnitas" with all the fixings and then another meal of pulled pork BBQ sandwiches.

My husband was home, so I didn't use the slow cooker.  Instead I prepared as directed then put it in the oven at 275 degrees for 7 hours.  I'm sure the slow cooker would be just as good.  Hubby did the shredding  - which made my day!  I put some in the freezer and used it a month later - perfect hearty quick dinner.

I didn't put the coffee in but did add some crushed pepper flakes. I used a different cut of pork. It came out sooo succulent and flavorful!! My husband gave it an A, which is hard to come by! We'll be making it this way in the future!!

This has been my go to pork recipe for years!  I always get rave reviews when I make it.  I recently started seasoning the roast with garlic and creole seasoning in addition to the s&p.  Also add one tablespoon of liquid smoke for a really nice authentic smoked pulled pork flavor!  It's delightful!!

For a quick dinner this is a pretty good recipe.  Followed the recipe except I rubbed a rib rub from this website (Tennesee Rubdown) all over the pork instead of the salt and pepper. At the end took out the pork and poured the drippings/stock into a measuring cup and tried to remove as much fat.  I shredded the meat and put it back in the slow cooker on warm and added some bbq sauce (C&C BBQ) and some of the liquid.  Served on hamburger buns with some baked beans.

EZ, versatile, and simple. Made mine on stove top using pot with heavy glass lid and cooked it on minimum heat for about 4 hrs. After shredding the meat, returned it to the pot and added my favorite BBQ sauce (Baby Ray´s or Bull´s Eye). I also added 1 tsp. of liquid smoke and 2 cloves of garlic.

without a doubt the most AMAZING pulled pork I have ever had! I took other reviewers suggestions and added onions (I used 1 medium sized onion)and garlic cloves (I used 3 cloves and chopped them) to the bottom of the crock pot. I also added about 2 Tbs. liquid smoke.

Not bad as written, but I agree with MommyFromSeattle.  The beef broth and coffee really aren't needed.  Neither is browning.  Just put your favorite BBQ sauce in the crock pot with the pork.  I also salt and pepper the meat, but I suppose you could skip that if you like.  Shred it, add some warm fresh sauce and pile it on a kaiser.

SO YUMMY!  I'd only made chili in my crock pot before this.  I used the full can of beef broth the first go-round, very soupy, but the pork was really tasty.  2nd try I used salt, pepper, a teaspoon of coffe grinds, 1/4 can of beef broth and 1/2 jar of BBQ sauce.  It could not have been more perfect...added the other 1/2 jar, cooked for 30 minutes more...juicy and delicious!  Even better warmed up on a toasted roll, eaten as leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!

Another cool add in is when you first start cooking it, add a crushed dried or fresh habanero pepper to make a more spicy flavor when finished.

I have cooked this several times for my friday night get togethers. I don't put in the coffee or cut the roast in half before cooking. I use a rub and rub it down put it in the slow cooker for several hours with some beef broth. When done I drain most of the broth off.(save some broth to add to the pork later) Shred the pork and add a little more rub then put in BBQ sauce. I have also added a little liquid smoke too from time to time. Put a little broth back in to keep moist. Everyone raves about it and it really is simple and inexpensive to feed a group of people.

This was so simple and awesome.  I probably spent less than 5 minutes on this.  I did add some BBQ sauce to the crock pot while it was cooking.  I also added some (maybe a cup) of the gravy/juices to the meat and sauce.

This meal was so easy to make. Smokey BBQ sauce was perfect. I removed part liquid after six hours and added just a bit of the BBQ sauce. The meat was ready so I just set on serve until time to eat. yummy

Used 2 cups coffee, added a splach fo cider vinegar and worchestershire sause to the broth, after I sprinkled garlic powder, paprika, onnion powder on the roast, making this an entirely different recipe, I guess. Served with North Carolina Barbeque Sauce from this site. Topped the pulled pork sandwiches with cole slaw. Oooh good!

Very easy. I like adding the BBQ Sauce later. Added no garlic , salt or pepper. although that would have been ok with the end results. Either way works fine depending on how many ways you end up using the finished product. No liquid smoke!

Made this for the first time this weekend, exactly by the recipe, and I loved it!  Even reheated, the meat is very moist and tender.  I actually like that the meat isn't seasoned heavily "in the crock," that means I'm free to top it how I like when I serve it--barbecue, ranch, honey mustard... :)

I was making for a crowd so I had 15 lbs of meat. I roasted in oven 12 hours at 250, cooled pulled and put in crock pot. also added liquid smoke to broth. used a few ladles full of the liquid mixed with bottled bbq sauce. put just a little back in the pot and served the rest on the side. everyone at the party raved about it and asked for the recipe.

Made this for the 4th of July party and it was a hit. It was so easy in the slow cooker. I used "Sweet Baby Rays" BBQ sauce but next time I will save some of the liquid from the crock pot to give some moisture to the leftovers.

This was the HIT of the July 4th celebration.  I cooked for 7 hours then transferred, in foil, to charcoal grill for 30 minutes.  I used indirect heat and the added smokey flavor was the perfect touch.  I used 1 cup "Sweet Baby Rays" BBQ sauce to hold it together.

Excellent.  I've used this recipe loads of times.  Usually use a shoulder butt, however loins were on sale this week so I am using that instead. Use the coffee it adds to tenderness and flavor. I like to let everyone add their own bbq as there are normally lots of children floating around our place.

I don't see how using coffee and beef broth makes this "BBQ." When I think of "BBQ," I think of either BBQ sauce or grilling... If sauce is supposed to be added to the recipe, it should be mentioned there, not in the description (IMHO). That said, the only part of this recipe I used was the coffee (and brewed it dark). I really liked that idea. I added the coffee to BBQ sauce, added thinly sliced Vidalia onions, used a 2.5 pound sirloin tip roast, and the meat tasted yummy. A tip: If you use tip or butt (hard to dry these out), and your meat turns out tough, try chunking the meat then putting back in your crock with sauce for 30-45min on med-high to high. This should help soften the meat enough for shredding.

This recipe was awesome!  I didn't use the coffee and poured some beer in there instead.  Turned out great.

As far as consistency goes, the pork fell apart really well and was very moist. But flavor-wise it was very bland, even after I added garlic, worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. Of course, once you add BBQ sauce it's great but the broth alone isn't enough.  It's always fun to try new recipes though so thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to do!  I didn't think it would be this good but it is as good as the BBQ that is the best seller in our town! Just don't add all of the sauce ahead of time, put some on before you serve it & serve the rest in a bowl and let people add their own!

Very good.  I used a 5 lb boneless pork loin roast, cut in to 3 pieces, rubbed on St. Louis style chicken & rib rub (store bought) I added a table spoon of minced garlic to the beef broth.  Did not use coffee.  Cooked on high for four hours.  Very tender & juicy.  Will definitely make it again.  Also, the resulting broth was incredible. Thanks.

So easy and tasty!!  I made this the Saturday before Mother's Day and then warmed it in the crock pot on Mother's Day.  It was so simple and everyone raved about it.  I had several different BBQ sauces available for people to try.  Everyone really enjoyed trying all the different sauces with the pork.  Will absolutely make again.

I have been using this recipe for a few years now and love the versatility!The tender pork is delicious when done and can be eaten as is or dressed with ANY sauce. I have made a green verde pork, carnitas, bbq, sweet terriyaki, and even used just a plain brown gravy and added mashed potatoes. I love that you can't go wrong!!! 10-12 hours in slow cooker yeilds same results and creates a heartwarming aroma throughout the kitchen and home! Always a favorite at potluck and bypasses chili during superbowl parties. Thanks Sarge!

I made this for a Super Bowl party and everyone commented on how much they liked it. I was running late so I cooked the pork for 4 hours on high in the slow cooker and it wasn't enough time for the pork to fall apart on its own. It needs at least 8 hours on low. Next time I'll leave it on overnight.    The recipe is very good as written, but since we like our food spicy, next time I will add some hot sauce to the liquids.  UPDATED: I made this again, but this time w/ 9 lbs of pork on low for about 12 hours, it was falling apart. I didn't even need to shred it, just turn it around a few times. I drained the liquids, added about 2 cups back in and a bottle of BBQ Sauce.  It is so good. Thank you Sarge.

The pork was absolutely tender, but because I couldn't get over the fat smell and I had to add so much seasoning for any flavor, I am rating a 3 - liked it.

I am no cook and trust me this was easy!!  I used a 5 lbs blade roast i did season it with a little salt, pepper, celery salt and onion powder and then seared it first.  I did not add the coffee because i didn't have any...still tasted great.  Cooked about 7.5 hrs and it shredded nicely.  Added Jack Daniels Smokehouse BBQ and it was fabulous!!!

This was great.  I'm giving it a four, only because there wasn't anything particularly special or unusual about it.  It does make great gravy for mashed potatoes.  (Used a separate BBQ sauce on the pork after done cooking.)

This is a definite easy way of making pulled pork. It was alittle too wet for me. Because of all the natural juices from the meat, I think I would cut down the liquid next time. Still very good though.

Made this to take with a bunch of friends to an amusement park. Made the day before & mixed in chipotle/beer Barbeque sauce. Packed in cooler & brought along soft kaiser buns. Made lots of sandwiches and tasted great!

The coffee and beef broth are not need.  The coffee adds nothing and the beef broth makes it to soupy.  All you need to do is place the pork in the slow cooker with very thick BBQ (we like Sonny's which you can buy bulk at Sam's) and let it sit on high for 5-6 hours.  Shredded the pork and then put it back in on low for an hour.  If you add any salt it with be to salty but a little crack pepper is nice for a spicy kick.  YUMMY!

Wow!  I was skeptical but I gave it a shot.  This BBQ is just like I grew up with in NC.  Awesome!  Don't change a thing.

I purchased a slow cooker for this recipe and I am glad that I did , This was very good, however I did use a pork loin and I thing that after adding the BBQ sauce it was very mushy, Taste was excellent, texture was not, next time I will try a different cut of pork.

I made this recipe with no changes.  At the end I drained most of the broth and added our favorite BBQ and let it simmer.  Everyone loved it.  Delicious!

I made this for my boyfriend and he raved about it. I had never used my slow cooker before so I was a little hesitant but this was so easy! The pork fell apart it was so tender. this is a keeper.

Used pork tenderloin, because I had it, and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Put meat in crock pot raw and coated with BBQ sauce.  Didn't add anything else.  Cooked on low for approx. 6 hours.  The meat just fell apart it was so moist.  Barely had to "pull" the pork at all.  Before serving I added more BBQ sauce and served it right from the crock pot.  Received rave reviews.  Even got a "Phenomenal" from my brother-in-law.  Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe and a family favorite.  The only thing I do differently is add a half a stick of butter when it's roasting in the crock pot and then we add BBQ sauce to the finished product.  I have made as many as 5 roasts at a time for a big family reunion and party.  Is WONDERFUL!  Love the hint of flavor that the coffee gives it!

So easy and turned out perfect!  I rubbed paprika on the pork before cooking as another reviewer suggested.  I cooked about 7 hours.  The texture was great and I'll definitely make again!

Simple and perfect.  Just rub the pork with salt, pepper and for me paprika, then add to the slow cooker.  I did add the beef broth and after about 10 hours my 8 1/2lbs of pork was fork tender.  I drained the juices of the fat and then put the juices and shredded pork back in the cooker till it was time to eat.  Everyone loved it!!

This pulled pork was OK; however, I need to read more reviews and try and get a little more kick into the basic recipe.  I do think the best pulled pork recipes will be cooking the meat without the aid of a BBQ sauce.

All right, I consider myself "cursed" in the kitchen, I can louse up any recipe, even when I follow the directions to a T. Then I tried this one and it was perfect, perfect! Better than any pulled pork I've had in a restaurant! And easy! I know I'm gushing, but it was such a relief not to be disappointed when I lifted the lid of the crock pot!  Thank you Sarge!

The overall flavor really depends on what type of barbecue sauce you use.  I found that I need to use a sauce with more kick, as the pork was good, but lacking the tang and kick I like in pulled pork.  I will experiment with a vinegar based sauce with lots of flavors the next time.

Oh my, this recipe is perfect. I started making pulled pork about a year ago, and Sarge, this recipe is by far and away the easiest and the best. Thank you very much! I followed the recipe exactly, except cooking time. It's delicious, super-moist and tender. Perfect. (My bbq sauce is Cattlemen's Classic)

Good but a little bland.  I added salt and 1 envelope of Lipton's dry onion soup.  Cooked an extra 4 hours.  It made a great sandwich.  Served it with Ciabatta and bbq sauce on the side, baked beans and potato salad.

This is a superb pork recipe. It yields very tender meat that is wonderful alone, or used in another recipe. It's very versatile and this is my family's favorite way for me to cook a pork roast. I have tried it with a beef roast but the pork is so much better. Just wonderful!

Fantastic! This pulled pork is so easy and so good. Put this one in your recipe book, you are going to want to use it often. Followed the recipe and when done I drained it and added back just a little of the juice, added about a cup or so of Bar-b-q sauce. Served on buns. Excellant meal!

Excellant.  A big hit. Will definately make again. After cooking in the slow cooker all day in coffee and broth, I drained it and simmered in Dinosaur BBQ Sauce (locally made in Syracuse, NY).  AAAWWWW, it was AWESOME!

Very tender, and a simple and easy preparation for pulled pork.  Mixed with some Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy dressing along with the Au Jus left in the crock pot.

This pork had a great flavor and was very easy to make. We put some of the seasoned broth back in with the pork. It made wonderful BBQ sandwiches using Grandpa Dave's Chainsaw BBQ sauce (from this site). My friend who works in a 5 star restaraunt loved it!! Thank you!

Very easy and the kids really liked it. Even my daughter, who usually hates pork, gave it 4 stars. She said she had to take one star off because it was pork:-). Be sure to serve it with BBQ sauce on the side. Some people may like the pork plain, but we thought the sauce was a must. I followed the recipe exactly and will be doing this one again. Thanks Sarge!! And, thank you fellow reviewers for suggesting this one to me!

At first I wasn't sure if I was thrilled or not, but my husband is the BBQ king, he loved it - thought it was fabulous.  When I reheated it the next day I did not add any BBQ sauce to my sandwich  and ate it just the way it was prepared and I also thought it was great, there is something to this easy receipe.  We will be making this again, thanks!

this recciepe was wonderfull. the only changes I made was I added a few dashes of liquid smoke (as another review suggested) and I used a beef chuck roast instead of pork.  I will definately be making this again. I also used leftover pulled "beef" to make beef enchaladas which also was excellent.

I thought this was a very good recipe but there were a few adjustment I made. 
I used a fresh picnic shoulder because they were on sale.  After the meat had  been pulled I made a sauce of vinegar, black and red pepper and a little of the broth to mix in the meat.  That made it taste a little more like southern barbeque. Start early or cook overnight, it takes a long time to get done in a crock pot.

What a great recipe!! My family loves it and it's super easy. We add barbeque sauce along with a dash of jalepeno. We  serve it on buns, wrapped in tortillas, and...our favourite...pulled pork nachos!(We got that idea from our favourite restaurant  and now the kids don't bug us to go as much as our own nachos are just as good!)

I served this for a party and it was wonderful.  The meat was tender and had a wonderful flavor.  I did put the pulled pork roast in a covered roasting pan and added the BBQ sauce and baked it for a while to heat through.  My friends can't wait to have this again.

This was easy and tasty.  I made a few modifications.  I sprinkled all sides of the meat with Seasoning Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder and Paprik before putting into the crock pot.  I used the 2 Tbsp of Liquid smoke as others suggested.  When the pork was done, I pulled with a fork and added about 1/4 of a cup of the remaining liquid.  I also added some additional salt and Garlic powder to the pulled meat.  If you like it extra saucy, put barbecue sauce (I recommend Daddy Same's which I found in my local super market) in the mixture as well as on top of your sandwich or you can just leave the pulled meat as is and add the barbecue sauce on the top only.  I had mine open faced on a toasted piece of Texas style bread.  Add Jalapenos to the top of the meat if you like it spicey or coleslaw if you have a cooler palet.

THis was a sucess. I would like to thank the author of this recipe, as well as others that reviewed it, as I took thier suggestions. After trimming fat, I cooked the pork shoulder for 6 hours on low (bone in)- upped the coffee to 1 cup-  After the 6 hrs - it was fork tender so, I shred it, drained it, and added bbq sauce and chopped onions and cooked it on low for about 45-60 min.
It was perfect!! thanks everyone!

Yummy and so easy! I Double it for guests and serve it in it's juices in a deep platter. Kaiser rolls and a choice of sauces (BBQ, Mexican, sweet hot mustard, etc.) make this a dish to please everyone.

Couldn't be easier & all three of my kids loved it.  I had a large pork roast (bone-in).  I didn't have coffee so I substituted a little beer (it's what we use to cook country ribs in) I also added the liquid smoke as suggested and a little creole seasoning on top.  So tender and juicy, it doesn't even need BBQ sauce!  Thanks Sarge, this is a definite keeper!

Very tasty and EASY!  After 7 hours on low, mine was a little dry, but I used a pork tenderloin so that might have had something to do with it.  I added a T of liquid smoke, a small minced onion, and used garlic salt instead of regular - I was glad I did.  Flavor was really good and didn't need too much Sweet Baby Ray's sauce as the flavor was already packed in.  Thanks for a quick and easy weeknight dinner!

YUM!  I too added a few splashes of liquid smoke, and I used a shot of espresso for the coffee...I probably could have used another shot or two. Don't skip the coffee though like another reviewer suggested, I forgot to add it once and it wasn't nearly as good without it. The meat was excellent though, so tender and flavorful.  After I scooped the leftovers into a dish my daughter even wanted to drink the stock left over since she loves soup.  The entire family loved this!

Excellent!  So simple and per other reviews, did add 1 Tbs. of liquid smoke.  The flavor of the meat was sooo good, that I reluctantly mixed it with bbq sauce. Delicious either way.  Thanks Sarge!

Very good pulled pork, husband and son enjoyed it, much better than the packaged store-bought variety.  I used a pork loin roast and added 1 tbsp liquid smoke.  When roast was done, I put the shredded pork in a large saucepan over medium heat and added a bottle of BBQ sauce.

This was awesome! The meat was sooo tender and juicy - everyone loved it.  I used a 3lb pork butt roast and cooked it on high for just under 5 hrs and it turned out perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

THis is a great base for how to smoke pork for pulle dpork sandwiches.  I just made this yesterday for the neighborhood summer cookout and was very happy.  Made the following adjustments: 1. Couldn't find a decent shoulder so I bought an 8# pork loin with the most fat on it I could find.  When I was smoking the pork, I wound up adding 2 sticks of butter to the drippings & basting the pork. 2.  Cut the loin into 2 equal halves and marinated each for 24 hours in a zip lock bag with a bottle of liquid smoke for each half. 3.  THe next day I used 1 jar of McCormicks Pork Grill RUb for each half - added chipotle, red curry, cumin, & lots of brown sugar to each jar.  Wrapped each 1/2 of the loin in saran wrap & let it sit for 24 hours. 3.  SMoked it opn the gas grill with  foil pouch for a smoker set righ on one of the burners.  On low it held at 200* for the 3 hours it took to cook. 4.  My sauce was reduced to 1 cup of vinegar - will add more next time.

This was so easy and it came out so good.  Everyone loved it.  Instead of just salt and pepper I did use a seasoning for pork or beef.  And I cooked it on high for 5 hours.  I will definitely do this again!

Excellent flavor!  Followed the recipe exactly and the result was fabulous.  Nice change from the generic crock pot recipes calling for a bbq sauce base.  This recipe really lets the natural flavor of the pork take center stage.   Thanks for sharing.

I thought the recipe was just "eh".  I added more coffee per suggestions. Ick. I'd probably rate this even lower if it weren't for the homemade bbq sauce a friend gave me that rescued dinner.  In the end, the pork was just a reason to eat the bbq sauce.

This is pretty good.  Not as yummy as when its cooked in the smoker, but wonderful.  I addded some liquid smoke to the cooking liquid and it helped a lot.  Good plain or with BBQ sauce!

We made this for the first time over the weekend and it was very very yummy!  It worked out well because I am not a fan of BBQ but my husband is, so we pulled some out for me to eat plain on a bun, and put the rest back in the crock pot with some sweet baby ray's for him.  Good all around!  We will make it again but may add liquid smoke and will get some 'slaw for the hubby to eat on top of his!

This dissappear fast with no leftovers and everyone had seconds. I do agree with others though; this recipe would be really bland if no other condiments are added. I added garlic and tiny bit  of oregano and liquid smoke. The gravy tasted really good, however I didn't feed it to my family as the fat content was to great. The meat gets leaner when cooked this way and it shredded so easily, it just fell apart. I started cooking a 4 pounds roast around 2:30 p.m so I wrapped the roast on aluminum foil and   put it in the oven for about 1.5 hours,  I had the slow cooker already going with the broth and after the 1.5 hours   I dumped the roast in the crock pot,put over the coffee and cooked it for another 3 hours and 15 minutes in high most of the time.  A little barbecue sauce and dinner was served! So easy even when I was late to cook this. My daughter doesn't like bbq sauce so she prepared her sandwich as a Cuban sandwich with the plain pork, pickles, mustard, and swiss cheese. She claimed this cooking method was by far the best for the sandwich. I disagree but I do agree this is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe that I have made once. I used chicken broth instead of beef because it is what I had on hand. The suggested roast was very fatty, so for my second try I will use pork loin. My mother-in-law made it and included garlic. She said it was great. 

Trying it the second time with a homemade BBQ sauce recipe.

This is the most tender pork I have ever made and it was sooooo easy!  I couldn't give it 5 stars only because I had to serve it with a sauce since it was on the bland side.  Would likely be fine for most, but I tend to season my meats heavily.

WOW! I didn't change a thing. After he tasted the roast my husband told me not to tell our boys dinner was ready so he could have his fill before they got to it!! LOL! I did use a leaner roast to begin with. It was fantastic served over egg noodles. Thank you Sarge. Tonight Hubby requested it for Christmas eve dinner at his fire station... NOW that's an honor!

Made this twice.  First time followed recipe, but cut most fat off of the boston butt.  It didn't pull well, but flavor was good and it was tender.  Took suggestions and used pork loin (it's lean), seared it, used chicken broth, and tsp of liquid smoke.  Pulled the pork and used sweet baby rays and got rave reviews.  Wonderful!

Easy and delicious - a combination that's hard to beat!  I served it with a two BBQ sauces - a Carolina mustard sauce and a Texas tomato sauce on sourdough rolls.  My guests loved it.

This pork is absolutely outstanding.  I used a boneless sirloin roast and it was unbelievably tender and delicious.  Threw everything in the slow cooker before going to work and dinner was almost ready when I got home.  So easy to just shred the meat and just put in on rolls with some barbecue sauce.  I used half for one meal and froze the other half of the meat and all the broth for another meal in which I sliced the meat and made gravy for mashed potatoes.  I didn't like the gravy as much as plain pork gravy, but still, this is a five star recipe for wonderful pork.

I used a 3lb roast and cooked for about 5 1/2 hours and did not use the coffee, the meat literally fell off the bone.  I used Uncle mike's Vinegar Pepper sauce also from allrecipes and it made some delicious bbq.

Great, simple recipe. I followed this exactly with no modifications and it was a big hit at our potluck. I recommend this a bunch! Try to plan to make this a day or two before you'll need a good gravy because there was tons of yummy juices in the crock pot. I kept it warm in the crock pot with the bbq sauce on the side (which was good because there was someone who did not like bbq sauce).

This was tasty, but shredding the meat turned out to be a bit more work that I was expecting.  It doesn't go with the "come home to dinner" philosophy that normally comes with slow cookers.

I made this using pork loin roast- asked the butcher originally for the butt, but thought it looked way too fatty for my taste.  I followed the directions and this turned out very good.  So easy- will definitely be making this again!

Good recipe -- the pork flavors itself and doesn't pick up the flavor from either the beef broth or coffee.  I pulled the pork added in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and it made a resturant quality sandwich.  It's a keeper!

Great recipe for bbq pulled pork.  Put some KC masterpiece over it and voila.  Made a great amount for leftovers.

Made this to feed the crew working Christmas Eve services at church.  What a hit!  And leftovers fed the family the day after Christmas.  Our picky eater wants the recipe.

I've made this a number of times and it always turns out perfect. Good way to feed a crowd for lunch.

THis was just OK.  I had to do some tweaking to this otherwise it would have been a waste of meat.  I added barbeque sauce and Montreal steak spice at the last hour+-.  I put it on  steak buns and added sliced onions,tomatoes, dijon mustard and cheese and was OK but not what I was expecting.  It was very tender and easy to pull apart though.

Fantastic!  My husband declared it the best home-made pulled pork he'd ever had.  I guess the coffee made the pork smoky, but I actually couldn't taste the coffee.  I got rid of all that broth after slow cooking because of the fat.  And then I returned the pork back to the slow cooker with a separate KC style sauce.  The meat is sooooo tender!!!  Fabulous!  p.s.:  make more- I wished I had leftovers.

This was ok, I would not make again.  The flavor was too strong and tiredsome after the first couple bites.  Definately not worth all the work after the results I got.

I was impressed, but not as much as I'd expected to be after reading all the rave reviews. The pork didn't taste like much of anything prior to adding barbecue sauce. It was tender, but that's due to the crockpot and length of cooking time, not the ingredients. We did enjoy the sandwiches, too, but I think I could have just crock-potted with BBQ sauce and gotten the same effect.

Easy to make, but every one else thought it was most impressive. They thought I slaved hard on this. Far be it for me to dispute their many compliments!
