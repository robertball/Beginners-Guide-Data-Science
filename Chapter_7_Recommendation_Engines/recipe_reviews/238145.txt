I used frozen blueberries and raspberries and fresh pineapple, so I cut back a bit on the ice. Trust me, the kids will never know there's fresh spinach in this because all you really taste is the fruitiness, with not one fruit dominating.  We eat with our eyes and I can't say that I'm crazy about the brownish color, but it does taste good, and this breaks down great nutritionally.  Thanks Laurie C. for sharing your recipe.

Yummy! I didn't have blueberries but used the rest of the ingredients. Even my two year old had some.

I'm sorry but this recipe didn't work out well for us.  We found it to be incredibly tart.  No one really liked it much.  I am not sure what went wrong because I followed the recipe, but my only thought is maybe because the fruit is not really  in season right now, although the blueberries and pineapple seemed fine when eaten on their own.

Yum!  A quick and easy recipe we make often. Might try it with some kale mixed in next time.
