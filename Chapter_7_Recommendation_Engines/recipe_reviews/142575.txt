It was really good!!!  We tried it as the meat for some tacos, and the only complaint I got was that it was kind of salty.  Other than that, it was not bad at all!!!

My kid & I liked this. Followed recipe to the T, with mild, jar-salsa poured over the top and it was not only pretty good, but VERY easy & quick to prepare. Not to mention, easy on the pocket (used thin cut pork chops). I whipped this up in no time & paired it with a side of corn. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!
