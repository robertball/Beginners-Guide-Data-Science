I've made this three times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, using skim milk/pre-sliced mozzarella, fresh homemade pesto, and the best off-season tomato I could find. I had a little trouble poaching the eggs in the simmering water but I finally got it right. ============ Overall, I thought the results were somewhat lackluster. Maybe it was my expectations: this recipe may have been "inspired by eggs Benedict" but despite the English muffin, this isn't even close. This is really a just a caprese salad on a poached egg. =========== The second time, I made a trip to the specialty store and bought a ball of real, whole milk mozzarella. Wow! What a difference that makes! I poached my eggs in my handy little poaching cups, and I topped the whole thing off with some easy, cheesy Bechamel sauce. This was awesome. All the different flavors really complemented each other and teased my taste buds with delight! ============ Last night, I made it a third time, using real Hollandaise. Now I think I've found the almost perfect dish. In a couple of months, when I can get a home grown tomato, then it will be perfect! A wonderful vegetarian alternative to eggs Benedict, and with some fresh fruit on the side and a mimosa to sip, the best brunch ever to treat guests or just yourself.

Nice Italian twist on Eggs Benedict!  This was perfect for Sunday breakfast.  I toasted my English muffins and then added the rest of the ingredients, not bothering to heat antyhing in the toaster oven.  I used plum tomatoes that I sliced less than thick and opted for fresh basil vs. pesto.  I sprinkled everything with a bit of sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper - delicious!

I think we have a winner here. I made this for a Brunch. We had 10 people over for Brunch  so I made 14 servings. I knew the taste of some of our guests and so I knew I was going to have to offer more toppings other than just the pesto. Also, 4 of them I left the tomato off, just in case and it's a good thing I did. I made the muffins and placed them on a heated platter. I did everything except put on the psto sauce. I made 6 sauces to go with them. The pesto sauce, a hollendaise sauce, a cheese sauce, a Italian flavored sauce, a cream sauce, and a salsa. Those I put into my old fashioned Lazy Susan with dipping spoons so each could top theirs with what ever they liked. Most of the guests took small servings of several sauces. The ones without the tomato, I put sausage/bacon patty. The guests ended up using the sauces almost as dipping sauces. Taking a piece of muffin and dipping it in a different sauce each bite. The muffins/cheese/eggs were a hit. The ones with the sausage and no tomato were a hit. The sauces were a hit. Gotta' tell you, it was one of my better offerings. If you want a winner, this is it.

I have been making something similar to this for years.  I made this exactly as written.  I got an egg poacher that you use in the microwave that is fabulous.  You can have a poached egg in 35 seconds and no dirty pan!  I think the pesto sauce is to overpowering for the delicate egg moz and tomato combo.  I think a fresh leaf of basil is all you need.  With some modifications this could be a real winner- without the pesto.  Thanks for sharing.

I just used this recipe for the correct technique for poaching an egg and it worked perfectly!  I poached 2 eggs beautifully the first time I've ever tried.

Absolutely delicious! I made my own fabulous fresh pesto to top the poached egg. The egg poached nicely, although it did take several extra minutes of simmering, & a gentle dunking to cook the egg white on top of the yolk. I will make this again!

I made the poaching process a little easier by turning off the water when it began to boil. After that, I added the vinegar and salt, and then slipped the eggs in gently as described by the recipe. I covered, and let the eggs cook without simmering. Because they are not moving at all, they are much more "together" and I removed them after 10 minutes. I followed the rest of the recipe and the combination of pesto with the eggs and mozza was divine! Loved it - thanks!

This is the first time I've made poached eggs. I was surprised that the egg was actually pretty good since I've never had one. But the tomato being thickly sliced that is all I could taste. I liked the pesto on it but I think the tomato should be thinner. And I had problems poaching the eggs in simmering water so I put it at a full boil and that worked much better. Sorry.

Poached is my favorite way of eating an egg so I was all about this recipe. As much as I love eggs benedict, this was a delicious change, not to mention healthier too. Thanks so much Yogin!

I only had canned tomatoes...sliced not diced and regular wheat sandwich bread. I only made this because we had pesto and it was almost time to throw it out and ive had this recipe in my box for years and never tried it. Even though we tried it with out fresh tomato and no english muffin I must say YUM! I will try this again with fresh tomato and english muffin and write another review. Thanks for sharing your recipe. TERA

I didn't have much luck with the method of poaching the eggs like stated so I poached them in full rolling boil like I usually do. Also, I toasted my muffin with the pesto and some cheese at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. I returned the eggs in the hot non-boiling water to stay warm and sliced the tomatoes. When the muffins were done, I continued stacking the muffins and added a little bit more cheese and a small amount of balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I know weird but if it worked for Insalata Caprese, why not this recipe too? Very tasty recipe. I don't think my 4 year old liked it very much but she's picky and ate only the cheese and tomatoes. :) Next time, I think it would taste alot better with fresh made pesto using fresh herbs.

Served this as one of our weekend breakfast specials at our restaurant and it was a Big Hit!  The only thing we did differently is serving it on a home made english muffin which adds lots of yum!

I cooked these this morning for breakfast and they were delightful. I will definitely be using this recipe again. I actually used basil leaves instead of pesto because I wasn't up for making any and it tasted great as well. Delicious!

This was my first attempt at poaching an egg!  I read all of the reviews and decided to try boiling my water and adding the salt and vinegar.  I put my egg in a little bowl and dropped in the water.  I immediately took off the burner and put a lid on.  I let my egg sit covered for approx. 4 minutes.  I think because I took off the heat it had to cook a little longer.  I used a slotted spoon and retrieved my perfect poached eggs.  I used shredded mozzarella on a toasted muffin.  a slice of tomato, egg, pesto and on top I added slices of avocado.  Very good and tasted very similar to a dish I had at a restaurant last week!!!

I love poached eggs, so this was a real treat.  Used multi-grain English muffins and fresh mozzarella.  The cheese, tomato and pesto went really well with the eggs.  Delicious!

This was very tasty and reminded me a lot of pizza. I didn't have fresh tomato so I spread some canned chunky crushed tomatoes over a slice of french bread and then the mozzarella. The poached egg was bland and not cooked very well with that method though and I will go back to using my egg poaching pan with the egg poaching cups and cooking the eggs in butter instead. This method did not work well for me. The dish overall was fabulous though and more of a brunch or even breakfast for dinner meal.

This was amazing!!! It took my husband and I about 30 seconds to clean our plates! I'm a big fan of eggs benedict, but it's very time consuming. This was so quick and delish!

OMG, the flavors in this are so good!  Tomato, mozzarella and basil go great with EVERYTHING!  :)  I just poached the eggs my usual way and used fresh basil leaves instead of pesto.  Yum!  I didn't have an english muffin either, so just served it on wheat toast and it was fabulous.

LOVED this! I've never made a poached egg, so this was a first for me. Not sure if I did the best job making it, but it was good, lol. I really loved all of the flavors in this. I used homemade pesto, which was perfect. I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Definitely a keeper! Beautiful presentation, easy AND delicious recipe. I followed the instructions but with a couple of variations: had no pesto around so I used some fresh basil; also I added a slice of Canadian Bacon. Scrumptious! My husband LOVED it! Thx for sharing.

Great and easy to make! I made it exactly as described :) I wouldn't call it a show-stopper, it's more of a "great for how easy it is"  and something I'll enjoy for a quick meal on weeknights.

Made this for Sunday breakfast and was little leery of the pesto BUT it was great! I added a slice of Canadian bacon on top of the toasted muffin then the tomato and cheese. I don't have a toaster oven so just put in the broiler (away from the heat) and that worked great! I also heated the pesto a little.

Made this for Easter brunch last minute. I did not eat it, but everyone raved about it. My pesto was old so I couldn't use it. So I substituted it for fresh basil. But everyone agreed pesto would have made it great, so don't skip the pesto.

Great recipe, unfortunately I've never been able to follow a recipe to the tee; so I made some changes.
I used Smoke Gouda instead of mozzarella.
I added oinions, smoked turkey, and ground sausage.

Absolutely lovely breakfast! The only thing I did differently is that I toasted the English muffins in the toaster since I don't have a toaster oven and didn't want to heat up the big oven. I also added a piece of ham to the bottom of my husband's servings. If you poach the eggs in a stainless steel pan, scrub out the pan as soon as you are finished while it is still warm or else the egg whites harden on it like concrete!  I will be coming back to this one for both breakfast and lunch!

This dish was delicious. I altered the  recipe by using fresh basil and olive oil. My husband wanted second. I will definitely make it again for brunch.

These eggs were delicious !! The only 'down' side was that the man of the house found the green on top looked......"interesting"........which isn't always great in his terms. However he really liked the flavour. Perhaps slipping the pesto under the tomato once it had been broiled would take care of that !

This is a quick, delicious breakfast!  I soft boiled my egg in the microwave (put 1/2 c water in small bowl or coffee cup, gently break egg into water, being sure that the entire egg is submerged, cover with a saucer, microwave 60-90 seconds, depending on the power of your microwave), toasted the  English muffin in the toaster, then broiled the cheese until browned.  The only change I would make is that I will add a bit more pesto next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am not much of a creative breakfast cook but saw this recipe, had similar ingredients in the house so decided to try it.  WHAT A SUCCESS!  WE LOVED IT.

I used slices of toasted gluten free bread topped with shredded pepper jack, slices of organic grape tomatoes and a poached egg sprinkled with fresh organic basil from the garden... We will be having this for our special weekend  breakfast for sure!  Hubby loved it.

Turned out great, definitely will slice the Mozzarella a bit thinner next time and add fresh basil.  I used about 1/2 Tsp of the pesto and that was plenty but I did put the pesto on the table and a few others added a bit to personal preference.  Nice Recipe all around!  Thank you!

Easy and delicious combination! Didn't have any pesto so I drizzled an Herbes  Provence oil over it and used fresh snipped Thai basil. Will definitely make this again!

This is very good. I've used different kinds of cheeses depending on what I have on hand.  Swiss is nice and flavorful.   If you use your  egg poacher the recipe is more photogenic but if you slip the eggs into simmering water they taste just as good! This works well if you add Canadian bacon, ham or bacon, too

I've made this several times. It's a great breakfast. It's quick enough for a before work breakfast if you have the cheese pre sliced and make the pesto before hand.

This was a delicious start to my morning.  I'm not usually a breakfast eater, but had a craving for a poached egg today.  I made this as written, but I have a poached egg pan and I used that to make the eggs.  The flavor was delicious and liked the bit of pesto at the end.  A recipe that I know I will be using again.
