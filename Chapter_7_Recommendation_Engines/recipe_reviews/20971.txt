I have never had ribs better than these. Not even in a restaurant! They were tender, juicy and very flavorful. Believe me, they are well worth the time to make them.  My family inhaled them!

This was awesome.  I only used the rub in this recipe, and I added a little brown sugar to the mix.  I used a store bought sauce with it and it turned out great.  A really good mix of spicy and sweet.  
Best ribs I've ever had.

Great combination of spices.  It may look like it takes a long time, but marinating is so simple, and the seasonings are great.  Wonderful recipe!  Make it for friends and watch them finish it all off and ask for more!

The sauce was absoulutely too salty and just tasted wrong. I even tried tweaking this and the salt was so overpowering

Wonderful rub - I made it exactly as Big John said, and rubbed it into a slab of pork spareribs. Let them sit in the frig for 17 hours. Then baked them, covered with foil, at 300 degrees for 2-1/2 hours. Fired up the grill at medium heat; basted both sides with Jack Dabiels Hickory BBQ sauce, and grilled them for 5 minutes on each side. Yummy!

You know, this was good.  It was fun making my own grilling sauce for a change.  The meat came out really good but not a tangy as I would have thought.

Big John, I shamelessly stole your dry rub and adjusted it to make my own. Thank-you, Sir!

I liked it. I added more garlic and onion powder. Plus added fresh cracked black pepper all of this is to taste. I also used this on beef back rib and spayed them with apple juice I grilled them.

I loved this rib recipe sauce! I doubled the brown sugar because I like it sweet, but it was delicious.  I was on a pretty tight timeline, so I didn't get to let the sauce take as much time as I think it needed.  I think that may have led to a being a little "gritty."  Even with that being the case, it made my 1st time making ribs go really well.  I figure it's my fault for not letting the sauce cook for more than two and a half hours-I'm sure I could give it 5 stars if I had a little more time.

Made as written except the 1/2 chopped tomato never made it in my sauce because I totally read right over it. I was more impressed with the rub than the sauce but they were both good and this is a recipe I will use again.
