I followed the recipe exact only using a homemade cajun seasoning which had paprika so I omitted the additional paprika. I turned these every 10 minutes to make sure they did not burn. My seeds were done at just about 40 minutes. Very good, we all really liked these especially my oldest son.

These were amazing! I am not sure if it made any difference or not but I soaked the seeds in salted water for a few hours before following the directions here. They were perfect, just didn't make enough! I will never throw away pumpkin seeds again!

I used bacon drippings instead of butter, only because we had bacon for breakfast. :) Other than that I followed the recipe and loved it!!!

I thought these turned out nicely. But I will say that I boiled my seeds in salt water then dried them out overnight before doing the recipe. I only had to cook them in the oven for 15 minutes.

These were great! I used almost 1 tsp. smoky paprika (all I had on hand) and didn’t change anything else.  Yum! I’ll make this again

These turned out quite good. I didn't use salt because I don't like salty nuts and seeds. I also used soy sauce instead of worcestershire because I didn't have any. Soy sauce worked just fine.

These really turned out good.  Next time I'm going to sprinkle some ground red pepper on them and more cajun seasoning before baking.
