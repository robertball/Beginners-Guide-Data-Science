Loved this recipe. Prep took me more than 10 minutes, but it was worth the wait. Super healthy and filling dinner - just one bowl did it for each of us.   A couple of twists: 1) try Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup to lighten it up. 2) add 1 tsp of red chili powder to give it an extra jolt  Because of the Healthy Request soup, we did add salt to taste after it was served. A dollop of lowfat sour cream on top made it that much more tasty.

Good chili, easy to make and filling. It was a bit bland, so I added small amount of jalapeno cheese and taco seasoning mix and dried chili peppers to spice it up. Also.. I only had one can of white beans so I added 1 can of black beans which I think is a good addition.

I slow cooked instead.  I used whole chicken breast and jalape√±o peppers instead of green peppers for more of a kick.  Slow cooked for about 8-9hrs.  Topped off with some tortilla strips.  If it's too thick add 3/4 cups of water or chicken broth.

I am throwing away my other white chicken chili recipes. This was so easy and delicious. And you use only one pot for cooking! The only changes I made were to use a little more cumin and chili powder, added 1 and a half teaspoons onion powder, 1 teaspoon Adobo seasoning , and subsitiuted chicken broth for the water.

It's tasty enough for a quickie. Had to add more water and it's really bland. Added some salt, pepper, and a touch of cayenne pepper.

I made this for a chili cook-off in my High School foods class! All of the judges LOVED it! We had to change the recipe a little so we took out the ground cumin and the green pepper. We used red kidney beans instead. It was rated the 2nd best out of 7!

This recipe is AWESOME! I used 2 chicken breasts, defniately could have used 3, 4 might be too much. I used white beans because we don't like kidney beans. I added a teaspoon of chopped jalapeno when I was frying the chicken. I used 1 can reduced sodium chicken broth to replace the water. I added a little creol seasoning, and a little more chopped jalapeno. The ending result was REALLY good!!!!

This was decent, especially for a recipe calling for condensed soup. I give it four stars mostly because it was so easy to put together. If I were rating solely on flavor it would be a 3. I did not use all the chili powder it called for because my kids would not have eaten it, I only used about half a teaspoon to add flavor without spice, and I added some white pepper so it would not be bland. My husband and I added sriracha hot sauce at the table. I also substituted celery for the green pepper because that is what I had on hand.

This recipe is so easy and will make your tongue want to slap your brains out.

I added on packet of taco seasoning while cooking the chicken, onions and peppers for an extra kick.

I also added on can of green chilis to this recipe.  Bon Appetit!

This was my first Chicken chili and I loved it!!! I did change some things based on taste and what I had on hand ~ no Cummin, so I added 2 pkgs of Sanzo Orzo (hope I got that right) that my mexican neighbor lent me. Then I added a generouse sprinkle of Cayenne pepper because I like lots of spice. And added a brick of cream cheese to lighten the color and give it a nice creaminess. Also I used 4 cans 
(4.5 ozs) of Swanson All White Chicken pieces since I did not have any chicken thawed out. Served with some corn bread and I may be in love with this chili. YUM!!!! Thanks for the recipe I will be making it again. : )

I thought this was really good & very easy to make. I did not saute the chicken, peppers & onions, I just threw them all in the pot, brought it to a boil & then simmered for about 45 min.  I thought it needed a little something - maybe next time I will use jalapenos instead of green peppers for some heat.

This was very easy to make and tasted good. My kids loved it and I was happy with it as well. I used red and green peppers and it was great. I also added some chipotle (only to my bowl) which was fantastic.

Yummy. Made a few changes based on what was on hand. Used okra instead of green peppers, added a can of diced tomatoes w/ chili seasoning, a tsp of salt, and some cilantro. To make it go further I serve it over pasta (macaroni, rotini, penne, etc.)

I made this last night, and our family loved it. It was so easy to make. I highly recommend pairing it with Reba's Tennessee-style Corn bread, which has shredded jalapeno-monterey jack and a can of creamed of corn in the middle.

I made this and the only substitutions I made were I used red & yellow pepper instead of green;  I didn't have any white kidney beans so I used one can black beans and one can pinto beans and I added 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. Garnish with cheese & sour cream! YUMMY!!! I think next time I might use chicken broth instead of the cream soup, but I will be making this again. I served with cornbread.

This tasted amazing!  However, it left a few things to be desired.  There was too much chicken in ratio to everything else.  There wasn't enough condensed soup (which I'm guessing was supposed to thicken and flavor it) and I had to add more water than called for just to have a soup rather than some liquid in the bottom of the pan.  I only used one can of beans but I could definitely have used two cans.  I also simmered the soup for about 15 minutes to make sure the chicken was cooked completely through and to mingle the flavors.  Definitely a keeper!!

When this was done, it felt like something was still missing.  I added a good bit of garlic powder and some diced tomatoes and felt like it made a big difference.  There is an herb that this can benefit from, but I am going to have to play with it to figure it out.  On the whole, a pretty good dish.

A hearty chili.  This is more filling since it has chunks of chicken in it instead of ground meat.

I knew I wouldn't be home today, so I threw all the ingredients minus the oil into the crock pot, including the chicken breasts.  When I got home, I pulled out the chicken, shredded it, and stirred it back in.  A good, hot meal that took no time or effort.

Very easy! And tasty too! I adjusted the spices to taste because I'm not a "hot" person...but it came out great! I also used only one can of beans. Add some tortilla chips and what a filling meal! Will definitely make this again :)

Very quick and easy.  I substitued some leftover chicken broth for the water and this gave it a deeper flavor.  A bit thick -I used two heaping cups of leftover turkey- so I added a bit of milk.  Also substitued the green pepper with a small can of chopped jalapenos.  Very yummy.

Yummy!!! I used a cut up rotisserie chicken to save time. I also used chicken broth instead of the water. We added a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream on top, delicious! Will definitely make this again!!

Loved it! My husband would have eaten the whole pot if he wasn't so full. I added some salt to the cooking chicken. To serve, I topped it with cheese, avocado, crunched up tortilla chips, and a dallop of sour cream. My husband added some chipotle hot sauce to his. This will be a big staple for us from now on!

I made this with my leftover turkey.  It was very good and a great way to use up leftovers.  I added extra garlic and pickled jalapenos.  I would make this again.

Very good base.   I only used one can of beans.  For my family's taste it needed some heat and a little more spice.

Honestly, this soup was just okay for us.  I picked it because I had all of the ingredients ready to go, and it was quick and easy.  We really enjoy most chicken chilis, but this one just didn't have that "wow" factor.  Kids finished their small bowls of it, but my husband and I did not finish ours.

This was OK... although it was flavorful, it didn't taste like chili to me... no kick or spiciness. Next time, I would add minced garlic and much more spices, including some red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper. I guess many here found the same thing as quite a few people are suggesting to add to the seasonings.

I've made this chili twice..my hubby loves it.  I replaced the water with chicken broth, used white small beans, leftover rotisserie chicken and increased the chili powder to 6 tsp and cumin to 3 tsp and added some pepper flakes. Served with corn muffins that I added corn and cheddar cheese to. So tasty and easy.

My husband is the cook in the family but I decided today that this recipe was one that I could do. I followed it to the "T" except that I added more water because it was a thick consistency. Tasted great and it was fun to be in the kitchen with my hubby!

We liked this a lot!  I made it as is with the exception of one thing, I added some garlic powder to it.  I stirred some cheddar cheese into the chili and we also used shredded cheddar as a topping. Hubby also put a dollop of sour cream on his.  The crunch of the corn in it was different from other chilis and I really liked it. We will have this again.

I have made this multiple times and it's been a hit. Use frozen chopped onions and green pepper to save prep time. I like it as is, or zip it up a little using cream of celery soup instead of the cream of chicken and adding a stalk of celery sliced thin and a pinch of dried hot pepper flakes. Make extra and freeze for quick meals.

I love this recipe! when i made it i didn't have a pan big enough to hold it all at once so i did it half at a time. i put some chicken broth in there so it wouldn't be so thick, and that helped out a lot! also the second half i ended up using half of a jar of Tostitos mild red salsa. That i think made it great! also using taco seasoning helped it out a lot too! but definitely happy with what the final product was

I enjoyed this recipe immensely, and as I am terrible following any kind of recipe I made some key changes that made it a 10 for us! For starters, I actually cooked the chicken, green pepper, and onion in the same pot that I made the chili in with all the spices to which I included fresh minced garlic, salt, and pepper. I followed everything else except that I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes and used chicken broth instead of water - 1 Can. Then, we added sour cream and cheese to our individual bowls to taste, and it was superb! We had some friends over and we finished off the entire thing like it was going out of style. With cornbread, this is definitely one we'll be eating again and again. Thank you for sharing!

Due to my boyfriend's recent cholesterol test I've been on the hunt for good heart healthy recipes.  This Chili was really good but I did make a few changes to the recipe due to the comments I read about it being a little bland.  When you have high cholesterol just adding salt is not an option.
My Changes:
I omitted the green bell pepper and used 2 jalapenos and 1 orange bell pepper to balance out the heat
I used a red onion to bump up the flavor
Instead of 3/4c of water I used Chicken broth

It was a little on the spicy side but that's how we like it!

I sprayed my pan with Pam instead of using veg oil.  I cooked the onion and pepper with the seasonings until tender.  I added the remaining ingredients including a packet of taco seasoning and kidney beans instead of the white beans.  I used the meat from a precooked rotisserie chicken to save time.  I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes.  It turned out great.  Will definitely make this again with the above changes.

This is a great basic recipe. I agree too, that it was a little bland. Here are my changes:

added 2 cloves of minced garlic, 
1 small can of fire roasted green chilis instead of green pepper, 
chicken broth instead of water.  
I also had some left over wild rice pilaf and a few black beans in the fridge so I threw that in too
Also added some salt and cayenne pepper.  

Seasoned chicken with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper while cooking.  

LOVED the cannellini beans, never had them before and will use again.

This is a great recipe to play with and make your own!!

I had to make one adjustment. I realized too late I was out of chili powder. So for the spices, I substituted 6 tsp of chili seasoning mix. Overall, this was a really good, filling recipe. I would definitely use it again. Not spicy, just right!

I made this recipe and my family loved it.  The only thing I changed was I used one can of chicken broth in place of water.  I will most definitely make it again, but I will leave out the green peppers.  My husband is not crazy about peppers.

This is the first time I've ever had or made White chicken chili and I think it was a great first time recipe. I'm not a fan of beans of any kind so I picked out my beans and gave them to my daughter and she loved them. I really liked the chicken and chili it went together very well. The only things I left out was the green pepper and corn because I didn't have them on hand. Next time I make this I will plan to use them. I also added a bit more water because we like our chili a little more soupy. I also put salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the chicken before cooking it with the onions. I will be making this again.

I added a can of chickpeas and cooked it in the crockpot (after sauteeing the turkey and veggies). We served it with avacado on the side. Delish! My husband asked me to make it again for lunches.

Well, I almost hate to review this recipe because though I was determine to make it, I discovered soon after that I didn't have all the ingredients. But I made it with what I had, and it was still terrific!  I was out of cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom. I was out of onions!  I added a can of tomatoes since I didn't have onion, even though that's no substitute.  I used black beans. I was out of chili powder so I used taco seasoning instead. Still loved it!!

Since I am from Texas I can't really call this chili, but it turned out alright for stew. I added a jalapeno to the chicken. I put in some of that Green Giant southwestern style corn, some crushed red pepper and about 4 tablespoons of sugar. That made it edible.

This recipe was a hit with my family tonight! I didn't have Cream of Chicken Soup so I used Cream of Celery instead. I also added some salt and Tabasco to it. Yum!

It fed us, but it wasn't my cup of tea. I skipped the green pepper and used chicken broth (plus a little extra) instead of water. I prefer Leanne Ely's White Chicken Chili recipe.

I omitted cumin because I didn't have any and forgot to add the corn..did add chopped green chilis from a can, chopped jalepe√±os, and some kind of hot red pepper, besides the fact that I added too much chili powder it was delicious; everyone in the home loved it and definitely a keeper of a recipe!! Thank you!!!

I tried this recipe last night, and it was great. A nice twist on the standard chili. I took some notes from some other reviews and added a pack of taco seasoning. I also add som jalepenos b/c I like a little kick. I am sure I add more chili powder and cumin than suggested, so I just say to season to your liking. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I'm obsessed with my crock pot so I threw all the ingredients in there! I'm also a five star spice kinda girl so I added a 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper and two jalape√±os sliced in half. It was the perfect amount of heat! This is an awesome recipe!

Have used this recipe many times during this cold, long winter . . . . quick and easy to make and modify to your taste--I use whatever beans I have on hand. I added some home canned diced tomatoes and jalape√±o pepper. This recipe is a keeper!

I was really excited about this one, and it just was alright. It seems like it's missing something, more of a zing maybe. It was kind of bland, and I followed the recipe exactly, although I did season my chicken separately as well. I don't think I will be making this again.

One hitter winner with the family. Just added a jar of salsa, green onions, cayenne pepper and chiles to it to kick up that southwestern flavor. Sprinkle with cheese and top it off with a dollop of sour cream. Yummy!

So easy to make.  So delicious too!

I didn't have any cumin, so I added a little bit of cayenne (I love hot) and some salt.  I didn't add the bell pepper and used Goya small white beans.  

Made some corn bread with it and it definitely eats like a meal.  Even my bf who doesn't particularly like beans or corn think it delicious.  (?ÀÜ?ÀÜ?)

I made this with leftover turkey instead of chicken, northern beans instead of kidney beans, and a can of chopped green chillies instead of the green pepper.  I also did not have corn in the cupboard, so I omitted it.  I agree with other reviewers that it was a little bland.  I ended up adding about a teaspoon and a half of kosher salt.  With some sour cream and cheese on top, it was amazing.

Was planning on making something entirely different for dinner tonight, but of course I forgot to buy one essential ingredient. Came across this recipe and had everything on hand, so I decided to take a chance. Boy am I glad I did! I did spice it up a little bit more to suit our tastes, but all four kids gave it a thumbs up, which is saying a lot around here!

Absolutley delicious! Quick and easy, with restaurant quality results. The only addition I made was adding some jalepeno wine to the sauteed veggies because I had it in the fridge.  I will make this many times in the future!

Very quick and easy to make.  However, it was missing something.  There wasn't a whole lot of taste.  I'm a beginner in the kitchen so not even sure what i'd add to add flavor, but definitely add something for flavor if you're going to try this.

WOW!!!  This took no time at all to make!  Didn't have the chicken breast on hand, but  I had some precooked mesquite chicken breasts from Sam's Club so I cubed and used that.  YUM!!!!  Only had 1 can of beans in the pantry, but it is still delicious!  I will make sure to keep the things I need on hand so I can whip up a quick meal!  I actually had everything on hand this time anyway!  Thanks for a great meal!!!

Wonderful recipe!  Not Texas Chile but a great alternative. I did play with the recipe a bit. Used 2 cans of chopped green chili‚Äôs in place of bell pepper and increased the chili powder and cumin because it was too bland for us. Also used chicken stock in place of water and used more than called for because it needed more liquid. That was my personal taste. Hubby

Love it! Used a seasoning packet instead because the only spices in the cabinet are salt and pepper and about a 1/4 of a medium onion.

Not my favorite ~
Tasted before adding the Campbell's soup and it was awful.  So I took other's suggestions & added pepper flakes, a bit of salt & garlic.  Better but not good - I added the cream of chicken soup ad it was much improved but still just not 'it'.  I then added 2-3 oz salsa and thought it was now 'ok'.  May be the corn takes it from 'ok' to 'wonderful' ~ I'll find out tomorrow when I serve it :0

This is a really good recipe for when you want to make a quick meal. I substituted the water with chicken broth,  and ended up adding another cup to add more ‚Äújuice‚Äù. I also added a cup of shredded Monterey Jack cheese to thicken it up a little. We topped ours with tortilla strips, sour cream, and jalape√±os. Perfect for a winter day!

Made 2-19-2019 according to recipe but used broth instead of water.  I, like others, thought it was bland and tried to figure out what  it was missing.  I figured out it is the "tang" from a can of green chiles.  Next time I will use one or two cans of chopped green chiles.  To "fix" this we added green tabasco sauce to each bowl.

I found this recipe, extremely bland. I personally, hated it. I couldn't even make myself eat more than 6 bites. My husband thought it was ok. My son liked it. I even added hot sauce and tomatoes with jalapeno peppers. Nope, still didn't like it. will be looking for a different recipe for Chicken Chili. Sorry, to the poster for the bad review but this was just gross, in my opinion. My idea of chili is supposed to have a little kick. This just didn't do it for me.

Excellent change of pace especially when trying to avoid red meat. And of course with any recipe you can change it up a. It to make it your own.

I found that this tasted better the second day after I added some salt and pepper. Also it needed to cook a bit longer so the onions and peppers could soften more. Great flavor and very easy. Added to my favorites!

I loved how easy and quick it was to make. I made a few adjustments with the Ingredients. I omitted the corn. I added a jalape√±o, bunch of cilantro, some cayenne and paprika. It was a hit and even when I made 4x the recipe it didn‚Äôt last long in our home.

I read the reviews and one of them said that the recipe was rather bland. So I added some extra spices "without" tasting first. I won't do that again! The chili was very good, but a little hot. I will make it again and will taste before I season next time.

I make this recipe and love it. Sometimes I make it without cream of chicken because I sometimes have an asthmatic reaction to those creams but with or without it is very delicious. I actually only make this in the crockpot and I add garlic and red bell pepper to the recipe. I add the cheese when it is done cooking. I've also served it with different things at request : hot sauce, cornbread, Doritos, tortillas, salsa, taco sauce, collard greens or garlic bread.

Made this for dinner tonight and there was not one drop left!  I like a little more spice, so I added one extra tsp. Chili powder, and 1 tsp. Cumin.  I also added a packet of taco seasoning and substituted broth for the water.  This is a keeper for sure!

Love this recipe!  I don't always have the exact ingredients on hand. For example I use sweet peppers when I don't have green (very colorful) and chopped rotisserie chicken makes a quick & delicious change.  A MUST at our house is  the addition of one chopped jalape√±o pepper and two minced garlic cloves.  This chili is a definite hit!

This is the best white bean chili recipe that I have found to date and I have tried at least 20.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Probably in a couple of weeks.  I can take it to work and have it for lunch for a few days as well as dinner.  Thank you so much for this recipe! PS:   I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water.

This is such a wonderful quick, easy recipe.  It tastes like it spent all day simmering but really only takes 30 minutes.  I had a few modifications that made this so AWESOME my daughter liked it better than Cheesecake Factory's.

1- I added about 50% more chili powder and cumin as others mentioned it was a little bland

2- I used two small cans (2oz ea maybe) of mild chilis instead of fresh green pepper (it gave a better Southwest taste and the peppers pretty much disintegrated into the broth)

3- Instead of water, I used beer.  For this, I would suggest an American Lager; I used Miller Lite.  I then added water to thin the broth a little as I didn't want it so thick.

4- I did not add corn but when serving added tortilla strips and grated cheese on top.

I think it tastes best with some hot pepper sauce added to it (Louisiana or such) but this addition is probably best  once served as others might not be inclined.

Super easy and I have the ingredients on hand most times. I usually use red kidney beans and whatever colour pepper I have on hand. I also halve the spices, due to my kids and spouse having dainty tongues ;) Always turns out great!

Nice and thick chili thanks to the addition of the condensed soup. It did not make six servings, however - we got 4 servings. The only change I made was to use shredded chicken (cooked earlier in a crockpot) instead of having chunks as the recipe states.

Easy and delicious!  I swapped out the chopped green pepper with a  red pepper to add some color and added a half small jar of chopped green chilis for some more kick.  Other than that, followed the directions to a T.  Will definitely make often!

Based on what was in my fridg/pantry, I subbed green chilies for the green pepper and used chicken broth too, instead of water, to amp up the flavor profile a little. I also added 1/4 tsp of white pepper and sea salt.  Excellent!!!  Yum!

This was very good.   I cooked it in the slow cooker.  I put my chicken breast in there with everything else and let it cook, then shredded the chicken.  I made my own cream of chicken soup.  I found it a little thick so thinned it out with chicken broth.  I subbed green chillies for the peppers.   Topped with sour cream and cheese.

Excellent and easy chili!  I always add about 1/4 to 1/2 c. of sour cream and about 1/2 tsp. of salt.  By the way, if you have never used organic chicken breasts, they are so much better than regular ones--more expensive, but well worth it!

this was seriously delicious and so incredibly easy to make, I was sitting down in 30 mins eating and I was sorry I made so little!  I added a diced jalapeno as other reviewers had mentioned and it had a good kick to it.  This is definitely going to be a winter staple in my house

I used leftover rotisserie chicken otherwise I followed the recipe. The only thing I will do different next time is add a small can of chopped green chilies and an extra can of canneliini. But I will definitely be making this again. It is very good and an excellent way to use leftover chicken.

I liked it, however I thought it needed a bit more moisture.  I might add some chicken broth to my leftovers. I also think it needed a little more bite which is easily corrected.

This was tasty and filling.  The flavoring was mild and just enough for me (I don't like spicy). I didn't think it needed the cheese.

Wonderful!!  I usually end up using Great Northern beans instead of Cannellini beans because it's what I have on hand.  Other than that I don't make any changes.

I made this just they way it stated but I didnt have the cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom and its AMAZING. I let it simmer for an hour on super low. Very good taste, not to spicy and didnt taste bland to me.

This is a great recipe. I've never made chicken chili before and this was easy and delicious. I had to use light red kidney beans and pinto beans because it was all I had, and I used chipotle pepper powder instead of chili powder. 

I will be making this again for sure.

I LOVE this recipe!! I use 1 can of green chilies instead of bell pepper. Did it the first time I made it by accident and have kept doing it that way ever since! I also like to put a spoonful of sour cream on top and eat a little bit of it with the chili on a tortilla chip. Soo DELICIOUS!!!

Awesome! I had excess chicken after making a pot pie a couple of nights ago, so I made this. I didn't have cannelini beans or cream of chicken soup, so I subbed light red kidney beans and cream of mushroom. It still came out delicious; even my 4 and 6 year old girls ate every bite! Thank you!!!

I made this tonight, with a few modifications. I omitted the green pepper, simply because I don't like them. Also, I wasn't paying attention when I made my grocery list and only had one can of cannellini beans. I used the one can and substituted a can of baked beans (all I had on hand) for the second. To combat the added sweetness, I added about some salt (probably slightly less than 1 Tbsp) and increased the amount of cheese. Instead of just sprinkling it on top at the end, I stirred and melted in about a cup and a half of cheese. I intended to make it as the recipe states (minus the green pepper), but I really like the way it turned out with my improvisation. I think next time I might add a bit more chicken and perhaps a little cayenne pepper to give it some kick.
