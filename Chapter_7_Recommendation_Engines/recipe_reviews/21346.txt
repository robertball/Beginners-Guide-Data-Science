Nice easy recipe, quick to prepare and throw together.  Cheap, which is good.  However, it did seem to lack something in taste.  Next time, maybe I'll throw in some cilantro and see if that spices things up any.

Taste better than it sounds.  Would definitely make again.  Anything with veggies can't be all bad, eh?

I've made this twice so far, and it's been a hit at my house and a great way to use up a lot of zucchini without really realizing that it's in there.  The changes I made was that I cooked the zucchini for a lot longer to make it quite soft.  This did produce a lot of liquid, so I used 1-2T of flour to thicken it into a sauce (mix flour into a paste with a little water before adding to prevent clumping).  This really made a difference, and the results were similar to an alfredo sauce with a lot less fat.  My kids even loved it -- they ate it for leftovers the following day and begged me to make it for dinner that night as well.  Definitely one of the best main dish uses of zucchini I've found so far.

Good recipe! Here’s how I make it now that I’ve tried it a few times. 
- Grate the zucchini & sprinkle with salt to release the water. I put it in a colander over a bowl while water is boiling for pasta. Dump it in a linen towel and squeeze out the moisture.  I also chop up a few cups of fresh spinach, too. 
- I use 3 cloves of garlic and I don’t brown it. I put it in the pan together with the first round of zucchini. Then add rest of zucchini & chopped spinach. 
I use veggie rotini pasta; it clings the ingredients better.  Toss hot pasta with yogurt ( I use a small 5 oz or so cup of plain Greek) and shredded cheddar first. Blend well, then add the zucchini mixture and toss. 
- Garnish with shredded Parmesan cheese
It’s really good this way, too!  Enjoy!

A nice pasta, and easy to make for a quick weeknight dinner. It was just a tad bit dry, so Hubs suggests adding a bit of chicken broth to the zucchini mixture next time, which I will do. Thanks!

I followed the recipe and it was pretty good as written. I've never been a fan of cooked veggies due to texture, but this was okay for me.

The second time I made it, I used parmesan cheese and omitted the yogurt. I added chicken for additional protein.

Another awesome dinner from AR! Mind you there is no pasta in this dish when I prepare this, I spiralized the zucchini in advance and spread out on paper towel that I replaced a couple of times to aid in removing as much of the moisture out so the refrig will dry it out a bit more . Added diced Linguica Sausage and Shrimp cooked in butter and garlic, then stirred in Basil Pesto Alfredo sauce ........ this had disappeared  so quickly and will be a definate repeater and I can see all the variations that will come.

I thought this was good, at least for using up what I had in the house. I did 2 zucchini in my spirelli tool and 3 garlic cloves. I used an old fashioned Pennsylvania style egg noodle, for the pasta. I didnt have yogurt or cheddar. I used half the amount of light sour cream and havarti cheese. Adding a little of the last 2 ingredients improved this recipe over similar recipes that included garlic cooked vegetables and pasta only. ty
