Yum, Yum, Yum – we thoroughly enjoyed this pasta salad made with tomatoes and basil from our garden.  I mixed this up in the morning to give the flavors time to marry, with the exception of the basil.  I added the basil about 30 minutes before serving so that it would be fresh.  This is an outstanding salad with lots of flavor.  It will be repeated in our house.  Thank you, blondeprincess, for sharing your recipe!

Really good. I made the pesto with basil from my garden, and I used Formaggio marinated mozzarella cheese balls from Sam's Club. They are cherry size, so I cut them in half. I added a teaspoon or so of Aleppo pepper for a little kick. Let the pasta cool a bit before adding in the cheese balls! I served this with poached salmon topped with scallion ginger sauce, a green salad, and naan. For the pasta, I used pipettes which have openings large enough for the pesto to get inside, so good! This would be a good salad to have with bbq ribs or chicken.

Decent general recipe.  For those saying it was missing something - I'd say that something is balsamic. Either mix some vinegar into the dressing, or drizzle some balsamic glaze on after the fact.

It doesn't have the caprese taste without the sweet-ish tang of good balsamic vinegar, so I added balsamic  and also more garlic. And I added toasted pine nuts atop each plate right before serving.

This was pretty good. Due to a tomato allergy, I subbed steamed broccoli florets for the grape tomatoes, and I added some sliced black olives to add another dimension. Instead of the mozzarella pearls, I subbed a block of fresh marinated mozzarella instead, and I sliced it into 1/4" chunks. Since other reviewers said it was bland or lacking something, I added some fresh mushrooms I'd cooked in EVOO and balsamic vinegar, and they had a little tang which greatly improved the salad as a side dish.

We love basil pesto so I know this pasta salad is going to be delicious and it was.
I used homemade pesto sauce and little more than called for, bow tie shaped pasta and went ahead and cut also the Mozzarella balls in half to have more of them though out the salad.
Everything was perfect until I realized that this salad is in no way going to make 6 servings. I had to boil another 1/2 cup of pasta and add little more of the rest of the ingredients to come up to a 6 serving amount. So be mindful of that when making this recipe. Otherwise, this is a great tasting pasta salad.

Very good pasta salad.  Easy to make and I like the fact that the dressing is made fresh and not from a bottle.

Made this salad to take to a potluck.  Doubled the recipe cutting down on the salt,& added lots of extra pesto, basil,  and then sprinkled pine nuts over the top.  It was delicious & I came home with an empty dish!

Super simple, yet hugely popular at my house. During a season of hot weather, I make a huge batch of this in the morning and it lasted for days, and still tastes wonderful. I add cold grilled chicken strips and it's a perfect all-inclusive summertime meal.

Super fast and just as wonderful, this pasta salad will help you get good food on the table in no time. This was a perfect light meal for Christmas prep days when you’re knee deep in cooking other stuff. I whipped it up early in the morning and set it on the table at lunch where people could just serve themsleves. This would be an excellent dish for a pot luck. Thank you for the recipe.

Easy and pretty fast to prepare. 100% student proof. However the downside is that the required ingredients are often found in larger quantities.

This was good but was missing something.  I think I would use fresh minced garlic if I make it again. It's good but tasted like store bought. And yes, it's very salty once you make the mixture.  I made a day ahead of my bbq and when I served it, the salt was not an issue. It needs to meld for awhile.

This is pretty good!  I think it could have used a bit more flavor, or maybe another element, but overall, nice easy and goes together quick!

This was my first time making any kind of pasta salad. I made it for a high family dinner. It was a hit!! My husband especially loved it. I couldn't find the pearlini mozzarella, so I used fresh mozzarella diced from a cube. It probably wasn't the same as intended in the original recipe, but it was still fantastic.

Great cold pasta salad. Just make sure you cool everything else down BEFORE you add the mozzarella. I neglected to do that and it melted the mozza balls and looked really strange.

Simple and delicious!  Use fresh garlic and basil- just 2 cloves of garlic  though-the flavor can easily overwhelm the delicate taste.

This is one of my favorite salads. I have made it several times. When I scoop out a bowl for a serving, I do drizzle it with balsamic vinegar which gives it that caprese salad zip!

This salad was so quick to get together and had great flavor!  The pesto was wonderful will all of the other ingredients and the basil gave it a fresh flavor.   I used a fresh mozzarella ball and cut it in cubes instead of using the small pearlini. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Great salad.  I love Caprese salad and this is a nice change of pace.   I added marinated artichoke hearts as I had a huge jar from Costco.  Also a little lemon juice  as I add lemon to almost everything I cook.

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried.  I'm sure it would be even yummier with fresh! Will be making this again.

I forgot to mention in my first review that this is delicious, but flavor does not improve overnight.  The sauce dries up.  I would not recommend making too far in advance.

It was ok, but needs some acidic component (balsamic or red wine vinegar) to complement the oil.

It was delicious but only enough for two portions. I'd double it next time. Also the suggestion to add some balsamic vinegar was a great one it cuts the oil perfectly.

It tasted good but I did add 2 fresh garlic cloves. I used a zester  so I wouldn't get any large chunks of garlic.  Also I would recommend that you salt the dish at the end to taste. Served it with grilled chicken.

We are not huge fans of pesto, so I only used about 1 tablespoon, which was plenty for our tastes. I used farfalle in place of the rotini as well, as that's what was in the pantry, screaming to be used up! This was a nice, fresh, summer pasta salad, that we enjoyed. My son added a bit of balsamic vinegar to his (which he prefers), and that was a really nice addition too!

Needed to double it. Put in 7 tablespoons of pesto, 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar to brighten it up. Did not double salt, used psrmesan cheese instead, one quarter cup. Added sliced black olives and freshly ground basil.  Everyone loved it! Kept going back for more.

I rarely make a recipe exactly as written and this was no exception.  I was trying to use up leftovers from my holiday feast so I added some things.  I added Black olives halved, pepper nibs, 1 hard boiled egg, juice of 1/2 lemon and my pesto was homemade spinach pesto.  The whole thing was delicious! 
Thanks for the basic recipe.

I made this for a potluck, and it was a big hit. I used twice as much pesto (I used the Costco/Kirkland brand), and skipped the olive oil. Will definitely make again.

I made it earlier in the day, then served it at dinner. It was a bit dry, so I just added some warm water, and it turned out just fine. Very tasty!

Delicious! A real hit! Made using Kirkland jarred pesto and added garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. Addition of balsamic vinegar to taste was key imho. Cut up fresh mozzarella log purchased at Lidl. Economical, easy (no chopping veggies !) and delicious pasta salad.

I made this for a gathering of very picky eaters. They loved it! I had made a double batch and all but about 1 cup was gone when it was time to go home. For best results I recommend using homemade pesto rather than pesto from a jar.

I made this as written. 3 stars because it's a rather bland and safe pasta salad, no caprese flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great recipe  Followed the recipe as directed with the addition of 2 TBL. of balsamic, 1 cup of frozen & thawed green peas & small can of drained & sliced black olives.  Omitted the fresh mozzarella as didn't have it on hand.  As another reviewer have mentioned, this is a  great pasta salad without using bottled salad dressing.  Thank you for posting it.

It's different. I used shells instead. May try tweaking it the next time. A little short on flavor. Has a lot of promise.

This pasta salad was OK, but as other reviewers noted, something was just missing. I liked that the ingredient amounts were perfect, but this just didn't hit the spot for us as a pasta salad...hence the 3 star rating. Since I made my own pesto (Pesto by Anderval), I omitted the extra oil, garlic, and salt (parmesan cheese is salty). Made this gluten free by using Barlilla GF Rotini. Also, omitted the pearlini mozzarella from my serving. My husband had his with the mozzarella, but didn't feel it made a difference. It made a decent side to the Italian Sausage, Peppers, and Onions by GIGI9801 (used as sandwiches), but no different than if I pretty much made any other pesto pasta. I had the little bit that was left today for lunch and added a splash or two of Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing, which made the salad better, and more reminiscent of "Caprese" style for me.

Such a simple and quick recipe but oh so good.  As with all foods and tastes, each of us have our own preferences. As such, after reading all of the reviews and prior to making, I modified this by adding sliced black olives, and went a little heavy with extra tomatoes.  I can see adding other extras to jazz it up a bit if I so choose.  This is quite scrumptious and will be a go to pasta salad for my home.  It is best to let all of the flavors meld for at least 24 hours to obtain more pop.  Delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it did seem a little bland, so I added more pesto, olive oil, salt, and garlic.  That helped a lot, and  it was a big hit.  Easy to make, and a great compliment to our dinner of grilled chicken and sautéed zucchini & onions.

I doubled the recipe and still added more pesto.  When I serve the salad, I will drizzle the top with a balsamic vinegar glaze.  The vinegar adds a nice added flavor.  I will make this again.

Probably my own fault as I did not have any buffalo mozzarella and used cubed feta cheese instead - it was desperately rich and I felt sick all evening!  However I would try it again with the mozzarella!

Loved this with the addition of balsamic vinegar and one clove of garlic, as others suggested.  The fresh garlic isn't very "caprese," but does make it tastier!

Tried this last night and found it quite bland.  I used pesto bought from an Italian specialty deli but even doubling the amount didn't give as much flavor as I was expecting.  Added extra garlic powder, some onion powder, salt and pepper but still bland.  I also ignored the amounts listed for the tomatoes and added a whole container.  If I make this again I'm going to have to jazz it up a bit to suit our tastes.

I chose this recipe because I was looking for some new ways to use Pesto.  On the plus side, this goes together quickly and easily.  It also makes a reasonable amount - ngo 'food for an army' here.  I appreciate those things.  On the other hand, this is not the most flavorful of recipes.  The only change I made was to use fresh garlic instead of granules. I let it sit 6 hours before serving and it was definitely on the bland side.  I drizzled some good quality balsamic on it, as others have suggested and also sprinkled on some freshly shredded parmesan.  It helped, but it was still on the bland side.  We finished it off today.  Sitting overnight in the fridge did make a difference in taste but it still needed the balsamic and parm to help it along.  While it wasn't a waste for us, it probably wasn't spectacular enough to repeat.

Very good and easy. Needs more fresh basil than called for. Good warm  and cold. Will make this again.  Edit. I've made this a few more times now. I will stick with the four stars for this recipe as written. But add more pesto and fresh basil and add torn pieces of prosciutto and you have a five + star recipe.

I added cucumbers,  yellow bell peppers.  It was good. 3.5 stars from me. My friend liked it too. Felt like it was missing something....maybe some fresh garlic. I also added a little balsamic vinegar like other people suggested and that was nice.

Loved it.  Husband who hates pesto and tomatoes even ate and LIKED! Great flavor- best eaten fresh but will hold for a day or so. The flavors will be a fit flatter

I was hosting a party and needed something easy to make, this was a big hit and took no time! I also added black olives into the pasta salad to enhance flavor.

This is amazing! I use large shells as the pasta. I also use a little more evoo than they suggest. I let the pasta cool before I add anything. I ball fresh mozzarella with a melon baller. I also let it all marinate in the fridge together most of the day and add the basil before serving. Everyone in the house really really loves this. They were asking me to make double the amount to have left overs etc. huge hit.

Excellent pasta salad for potlucks and groups. I made it for a small block party and my wife's tennis party. Double and triple batches. I made the pesto from the garden and added a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar per batch to the "dressing" before  coating the pasta. Otherwise, followed the recipe as is. Never any left to bring home.

Made it for my celiac boyfriend using store bought gluten free rotini. HUGE hit! Super tasty, and very healthy. I also recommend putting a ton more tomato and mozzarella. I dunno how much...just eyeballed it until I was happy. I also doubled the amount of pesto. Amazing!

Just tripled this for a high school football potluck picnic. ALL GONE! It was really great - I added balsamic vinegar which made it more like the caprese salad I'm accustomed to. YUM!

I made my own homemade pesto sauce (Lidia Bastianich's recipe from the PBS cooking show--I have her cook book), but the dish is a lovely presentation and quite tasty.  Thanks!
