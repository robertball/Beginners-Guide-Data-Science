Great and tasty!  Make into smaller cakes and serve with a sour cream dill sauce for a wonderful party appetizer finger food served on colorful picks garnished with radishes.

Really tasty.  Found this recipe as I had one salmon fillet in the house and about 20 shrimp and was not sure where to go from there.  The salmon fillet was only 1/2 lb so I used all of the shrimp.  I also was low on breadcrumbs and used 1/2 cup of stuffing mix.  The shops here (Australia) do not have seafood seasoning so I looked up Old Bay online and threw into the cakes: allspice, mace, paprika, pepper, celery salt, crushed red pepper, ginger, and nutmeg. The one thing I noted was that the 3 tablespoons of butter in the breadcrumbs was a lot and that moisture was enough to stick a lot of it together which left me with about 1/2 of the mustard/mayo mixture and seasoning unused.  I would decrease butter in future and use more of the wet mix.  The end result was very tasty.

This recipe was so amazing it made me sign up just so I can comment! I was just looking for something to make with what I had and this was close enough. I used a yellow onion instead of red, spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, garlic powder instead of salt, seasoning salt instead of Old Bay, salmon in a can instead of filet, and it came out GREAT! I served it over some fresh cooked spinach and it was perfect! I fell in love the second I made the mayo mixture. Next time I'll use fresh salmon and more panko to make then stick together more.

So we tried this recipe tonight and it was awesome!!!  I made a few changes though.  First I used canned salmon and not the canned that still has the skin and bone on the fish! I used chicken of the sea boneless skinless pink salmon.  I used frozen shrimp.  Since I used frozen shrimp, I did cook the salmon/shrimp mix like the receipe says in order to cook off the water from the frozen shrimp. I used a frozen precut onion and pepper mix.  I doubled the recipe.  It worked fine.  I used fat free mayonaise.  However, I'm not sure if it is the mayonaise that keeps the patty together.  Perhaps next time I'll add an egg white to the mix because the patty did fall apart when I flipped it.  I used spray oil and butter.  everything worked perfect.  I will cook this again and again.

Very good. The flavor was so much better than canned salmon. I did add a bit of green onion to it because I had it on hand. I served it with a Dill Hollandaise sauce. I will be making this one again.

I did not have mustard so I doubled the mayo, could have used about another Tablespoon of mayo.  I also didnâ€™t have seafood seasoning but I used seasoned breadcrumbs.  I added garlic, onion powder and a little cumin.  My whole family loved them.

I have made salmon cakes before but the shrimp really added to them. To make them Keto I subbed the panko bread crumbs for crushed pork rinds, you couldn't tell the difference.  I also added a tablespoon of capers, they were delicious!!

I'm not a big fan of salmon so I just used a whole pound or so of some "fresh" local georgia shrimp and it was GREAT! Also added Vidalia sweet onion (finely diced) and a little sweet yellow pepper!!!

They're very good, but I couldn't get them to stay in one piece when I flipped them over. Otherwise, I'd totally make them again!

Finely chopped half the shrimp and salmon, and left the balance whole, salmon flaked. Left most of the additional seasonings out, as was flavorful and spiced appropriately simply with salt/pepper. Made golf ball size, coated with panko and sprayed with canola. Broiled for about 5 minutes. Dinner party raved.

This was a very good recipe. It was a little salty so next I will use less Old Bay seasoning. And next time  I would use more breadcrumbs. Overall this is an excellent recipe!

After reading the reviews, I added two eggs to help bind it together. Otherwise, I did not change the recipe. The seasoning was very good. I found that it took about 15-18 minutes to cook. This is a keeper. I served it with homemade tartar sauce.

Seasoning in this dish is excellent. I had a small problem with the consistancy. It was difficult to keep the cake together. Next time I will drain the salmon and shrimp to remove extra moisture and up the breadcrumbs a bit. But I will make this again.
Note the mayo mixture makes a nice sauce on the cake.

Mine fell apart too. The next time I made this I took 5 extra shrimp and pureed them with a little cream. This helped in gluing everything together.

These seafood cakes had wonderful flavor.  HOWEVER....I must had misunderstood about the "chopped" salmon, because I had a terrible time getting these to stick together in patties.  Maybe someone can give me some tips.  Thanks for a yummy recipe though.

I used the majority of the recipe.  I used yellow onion instead of red, and yellow mustard instead of Dijon and it was still delicious.  My son said it was one of the best dishes on his list that I've made.  I will definitely use it again.

This was pretty good.  I broiled it as long as the time said, but it seemed to be bit too soft on the inside. So i cooked it for 7 minutes longer at 350 degrees.  After that it seemed fine, and the flavour was good.  But due to some of the changes i made i'll be using another recipe for fish cakes. thanks anyway
