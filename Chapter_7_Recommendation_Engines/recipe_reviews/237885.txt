This was a huge hit for "Up North"!  The family was skeptical of the hot dog buns but after the first bite all anyone could think of was how much those buns were transformed.  Nobody thought it was too sweet or rich and the whole pan was gobbled up within 24 hours.

I liked the addition of nutmeg; it really added something special and it was evident in the final product.  

Some variations I may try:  Adding booze to the chocolate marshmallow sauce (maybe some rum or bourbon), replacing the graham crackers with Teddy Grahams or Nilla Wafers.  The possibilities are endless!  Thank you for sharing!

I didn't have hotdog bun so I used day old bread. Other than that, followed this to a "T". Very sweet for our taste but I think this would be a hit with kids. Thanks for sharing.

This is a huge hit every time I've made it.  I've used regular bread as well as potato hot dog buns.  Both great!  I add a little cinnamon and vanilla extract.   Serve with whipped cream/cool whip on top.  YUMMM!!

Very tasty and easy to make!   As others have noted the hot dogs work much better than expected.

You won't believe this, but I made this recipe using the leftover bread sticks from Olive Garden. It turned out super delicious and I made it for guests who said they did not even taste the garlic. I cannot vouch for the various amounts of garlic that each restaurant uses, but our bread pudding was delicious.

Made it for a monthly women's group meeting and there was only a serving spoon's-worth left in the casserole; I'd say it was a hit!  I'm not a baker by any means, and this was very easy to make.  Everyone asked for the recipe!

This is a keeper!  Not SOOO sweet that the adults were in the pan as much as the kids.
