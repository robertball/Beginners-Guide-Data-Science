I made this recipe exactly and it came out deliciously! I made it as a chilled appetizer - I portioned it out in large martini glasses over one large grilled prawn and then topped it off with a sprinkle of finely shredded iceberg lettuce, with blue corn chips on the side - Oh My Goodness - the taste and colors were amazing!!! Be sure to have a bottle of Tapatio on the table - the flavor was perfect on this!

Have made single servings of this 2 days in a row now; add the heat, it's good! I love the avocado in it. This soup even makes cucumbers taste good!

4 stars, but 5 with a few additions.  I added 1 1/2 tsp chicken boullion (min. satl, such as Better Than Boullion) dissolved in 3/4 c. heated milk, lime zest (1 tsp.) and 1/4 c. snipped cillantro.  We loved it!!!

This was a well received side at a summer dinner party with a few modifications. I added a jalapeño, some cilantro, and a little unsweetened coconut drink then chilled it overnight. Delicious!

I concocted this same recipe last summer, and it was so delish!  I was very happy to see the fresh garlic in this recipe as well.  I did add some fresh chopped dill to mine.

This confirms I am not keen on cold soup. Onion might have been helpful. My husband eats anything but even he didn't want to see it again. Would have been a little better if the second avocado was riper.

Incredibly refreshing and delicious. I altered mine using the recommendations of reviewer bethnewell, and it came out so tasty. I would imagine that without the addition of the chicken bouillion and cilantro it might be a bit bland. My brother, who despises cilantro, had a taste and thought it was very good. This will be a summer staple for me!

I made the recipe as is.  It was a nice chilled dish on a hot day.  In the future, i will use less lime juice and add cilantro.  But overall, i would recommend this recipe.

I live next door to an avocado rancher.  I often have avocados coming out my ears. (It's an ugly job, but someone has to do it.)  So I was very happy to find this delicious recipe.  I kicked it up a notch by adding fresh cilantro and jalapeños in the blender.  Refreshing.

Excellent!! I did not change a thing and it is such a great mix of flavors. I almost didn't add the garlic but did anyway and so glad I did. Wonderful for a hot day! It is going to go perfectly with dinner tonight. Love it!

This soup just didn't do the trick for me. Nothing wrong with it, it just didn't suit my taste preference. However, my husband and sister liked it, so it must just be a person-by-person thing.

I was disappinted in this. I love all the ingredients and was excited to make something cool and refreshing. I followed the recipe and it just fell flat for me. I started adding things to give it a little "zing" like white pepper. Sorry but I won't be making this one again (the only reason for the 1 star) but I thought it was a GREAT idea!

This soup was delicious on a hot summer day! I didn't add the chunked avocado, but appreciated the sweet and chunky texture the tomatoes added. Garlic lovers, you may consider an additional clove!

Awesome!  I added another a avocado to make the soup more creamy.  I also added a half cup of broth from bouillon cubes but I think this made it a touch to salty.  I won't do that next time.  I would also suggest chopping the cucumber into smaller sections if you want to use an immersion blender.   Next time I think I will add shrimp at the end.

Great recipe, although like many others, I added a few things.  I added some kale, veggie broth and just a touch of cream and ground flax..only one lime and served it warm and it was really flavorful!

It's ok.... I liked the refreshing taste of the avocado and cucumber.  What put me off is the addition of tomatoes.  I love tomatoes but I thought they overpowered in this dish.  If I make it again, I will only add a few, not an entire pint.  Also, I added a little red onion to the food processor.

I made this exactly...and both my husband and I didn't care for it.  We thought it was kind of weird.  WE love everything that is in it so I thought we might enjoy it.  First, my limes were very juicy so I feel that I only needed 1 or maybe 1.5 lime(s) instead of 2 juiced.  I also think there is something missing like cumin or cayenne pepper or something to give it more flavor or a kick.  My husband ate it with lots of hot sauce since he found it kind of bland and I ate it for the benefit of my health.

Just a waste of great ingredients. Eating a fast pickle or an avacado with tuna salad and tomato is so tasty. Or just with some pico. My husband tried to make it through a bowl because he thought it was my recipe. He reluctantly told me he couldn’t do it. When I said it wasn’t mine he was so happy! I had a taste and couldn’t do it. Maybe for body cleansers only!

I like all the ingredients, but its just not for me.  I made it as written and tasted it - not awful, but not anything I need again.  Then I added jalapeño and cilantro.  Better, but still not liking it.

I LOVED this. It's like guacamole cold soup. I added some milk to make it a little thinner. This time I'm trying plain yogurt.
