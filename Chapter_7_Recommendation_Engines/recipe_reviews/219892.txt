This is a great colourful savoury appetizer.  It was exactly what I was looking for and a wonderful vegetarian option.  I made my own hummus (I had chickpeas to use up) and couldn't find pepperoncini peppers so I substituted fire roasted red peppers (from a jar).  It turned out great and looks pretty too!

I made this today for a Super Bowl party and it was delicious and so pretty!!  I was a little concerned about the pepperoncinis, but the ones I used had very little heat.  This will be a regular favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

One of the best hummus dips I've ever tasted!  Very fresh and light. Will definitely be keeping this recipe.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious!  It was gone fast and I had to print out recipe for several of the guest. Made exact except homemade hummus and sprinkled Dill over the feta. Seriously delic!  Was thinking about adding grilled chicken slices and serving in a pita for a nice poolside summer meal.

This was a huge hit at my party!!  Very easy to make as well.  Instead of feta cheese, I used goat cheese since I like that better and it was still good!

I made this dip as written except that I made my own roasted garlic hummus and reduced the amount of Italian seasoning to 1 t (this decision was based on some other reviews, but I think I might put more in next time). It is a very pretty dip and delicious. It was completely devoured at the Super Bowl party I brought it to. I got many compliments on it. I made my own pita chips to go with: 8" pita pockets, cut apart into two circles, brush with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder and kosher salt, cut each circle with a pizza slicer into 8 triangles, arrange onto two cookie sheets and bake at 350 for 7 mins, then swap the positions of the cookie sheets and cook another 7 mins or until golden brown and crispy! YUM!

This is yummy. I just wish I liked Italian seasoning more. I would reduce the amount the next time I make it for personal preference.

I made this for a birthday party and all was eaten. I did not use the cream cheese, just started with the hummus. It was wonderful served with warm Greek style pita. Great change of pace from layered taco dip found at EVERY party.

This was delicious.  I did cut the Italian seasoning in half. I had artichokes and I substituted those instead of cucumbers.  It was a great addition. You can really use what you have to top it off.

This was fabulous. Here are the adjustments I made (mostly based on what I had -- or didn't -- on hand): no lemon juice, dill instead of Italian seasoning, a little more fresh tomato, no pepperoncinis, no cucumber. Came together quickly: I did the cream cheese and the hummus layers the night before, refrigerated (covered) overnight and the next day added the rest of the ingredients. Delicious!

Very nice twist on 7 layer dip, and you can change up the flavor a bit by using different types of hummus.  I love the garlic flavored hummus but for variety I think roasted red pepper or artichoke hummus would work very nicely.  Perfect for a party with the recipe for baked pita chips I found on here. Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS! Made as written, except that this was a last minute decision and I only had plain hummus, so I added a little garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture, and I had no kalamata olives on hand, so I just used sliced black olives (yes, I know they are different, but that's what I had). Great blend of flavors! We used BIG Wheat Thins and melba toast for dipping, but next time, I will go te extra milend make pita chips. This was somethng different and we LOVED it! Will be using this recipe often! Thanks for sharing. :)

WOW!  This was absolutely delicious.  I made it the night before which I think helped the flavors really pop the next day.  I made it just as directed and it was perfect.  I let it sit for just a bit before serving to soften the cream cheese and make it easier to dip.  I didn't think I would like the pepperoncinis but they made the dish and I wish I had added more.  My husband wants to put it in wraps for lunch, also!  SO GOOD!!!

5-star all the way!  Delicious and beautiful!  I made this exactly as written. Intended to double it, and did double the cream cheese mixture and hummus. Then there wasn't enough room on top to double all the goodies. It was just terrific anyway. Thank you!

I've made this dip for several parties. Everyone devoured it. The only change I made was substituting all ingredients used in cream cheese layer. I used some roasted red bell peppers from a jar, chopped, and mixed in cream cheese. Everything else was exactly as recipe stated. We loved it...thanks for sharing your recipe!!

This was a huge hit at my meeting! I loved it also. I used 1/2 the Italian seasoning and omitted the tomatoes, since they're not in season. Can't wait to make this again. Served with pita chip recipe on this site.

I was looking for something out of the ordinary, but satisfying when I saw this recipe. I absolutely LOVE it! Great flavors and awesome layers like a traditional bean dip. I especially like the pepperoncinis and added more of those on top. It's going into my regular rotation!
