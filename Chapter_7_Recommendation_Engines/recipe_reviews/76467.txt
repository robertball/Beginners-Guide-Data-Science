This recipe is good, try it, but IT MAKES A 9"x9" CAKE, NOT a 9"x13" one.  At least, I can't imagine how so little batter could have made the larger cake.  Beyond that though, this was great - moist, very orangey, a nice colour.  After the juice soaked in (15 mins or so), I topped the cake with store-bought chocolate icing.  That was a good choice - the combination tasted like those chocolate oranges you get at Christmas.  I made it for Halloween.

Great cake. A smaller pan works best.
For a different cake, try Meyer's Lemons with this instead of oranges. Delicious. Like others, whipping cream makes a great serve along. After whipping, add just a tad orange zest to the the cream.

Thanks to the other reviews, I used an 8 inch square pan. It baked for the same time specified in the recipe, 30 minutes, and turned out perfect and delicious. I made it twice in one day! I had large home grown oranges which produced a lot of juice, so I poured the juice from one right into the batter. I whisked a small amount of powdered sugar into the remaining orange juice before poking holes in the cake and spooning the juice over. Spoon a little at a time and you can tell when the cake is saturated. No mushiness at all. It tasted the best while still slightly warm but was fine the next day too.

This cake really is easy. I was doubtful about all that juice sitting on top of the cake, but the cake is dense and it does not get too mushy with the juice. I served this with whipped cream and little clementine sections on top. It probably would also work with canned mandarin oranges. The juiciness of the oranges on top, and the moisture of the whipped cream, together with the flavorfulness of the cake, made this a very good dessert.

Good flavor, but the juice didn't soak all the way into the cake, so the bottom was soggy.  I used a 9x9 square pan, and it took about 40 minutes.

Made this cake & it turned out to be fantastic!
Family & Friends loved it!
Small variation: I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract & juice of one orange in the batter and then baked it.no juice was added later.
Perfect!

This is not a good cake.  First,  DON'T put it in a 9 x 13 pan, there is not enough batter.  There is barely enough batter for a 9 x 9 pan and it's a very flat cake when it finishes baking.  Second, it is way too sweet and maybe (I say maybe) if you use Seville oranges, like you would use to make marmalade it might be more orangey tasting and better.  I would not make it again.

Good cake topped with a TB or so of whipped cream if you wish to add creamy sweetness.
However, there must be a mistake in the pan size.  I baked it in a smaller pan than the 9X13.  You'll see why when you see the batter.
It's a healthier alternative to some other cakes as there's no salt and no sugar topping, just pure orange juice.

Quick and easy to prepare with a nice orange flavor however I found it dries out very quickly so this cake is probably at its best if served as a dessert, with whipped cream etc., right after baking

Overall, a lovely cake - though I thought it would be more dense due to the wet ingredients.  I'm happy I read the other reviews first.  I used an 8 inch round tin and baked for an extra 10 minutes.  I found this cake to be a bit too sweet, but am unsure if this is due to the amount of  sugar or the sweetness of the oranges.  My two oranges gave me 1/2 cup of juice, I think more was needed.  I think this  recipe would make amazing muffins. Thank you for posting!

Apart from subbing applesauce for the oil, didn't make any changes - it was such an easy cake to make, and it looks and tastes amazing!! The hit of orange is exactly what the citrus lover in me was looking for.

Delicious! instead of pouring the orange juice over the cake, I didn't use zest and put the juice straight into the batter. came out awesome!
