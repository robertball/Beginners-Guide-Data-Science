Fabulous! And so easy.  I sprayed my peppers with cooking spray, added salt and pepper, and stuck them in the oven while I did the rest of my prep so they would be soft.  I cooked the rice in a rice cooker and browned the ground beef and onions with lots of seasoning.  Mixed it all together, stuffed the peppers and topped with pepper jack.  Served with sour cream, and this was a winner!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this last nite, my family liked it with the red peppers, the only thing that was not liked was the doritos, they became soggy when you put the peppers in the oven to finish cooking..

These were EXCELLENT!  Of course, my kids fussed and wouldn't eat the pepper (not a shocker), but they don't count in terms of reviews.  They don't like anything that's not processed and/or unhealthy.  They did eat all the good stuff INSIDE the pepper though, so that's a WIN!  

That said, hubby and I thought they were terrific!  I've made Mexican stuffed peppers before, but these were much better.  I think the difference was the salsa, as opposed to tomato sauce.  My husband bought the pre-shredded Mexican cheese, but I think next time, I'd like to try a Monterey Jack - something that might melt a little better and add a little more *kick*. 

Very good though - thanks for sharing!  Oh, and we topped ours with a little sour cream - YUM!

I subbed turkey for the beef, for less fat. I switched the green peppers with red peppers... I found that a lot of people who don't like green can enjoy the sweetness of a red. Also, my cooking time was much longer. I baked the peppers for at least 45 minutes and they were still a little too crunchy. So if you like your peppers on the softer side I would blanch them first. This is a great "starter" recipe, very customizable.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was excellent. I used red bell peppers and cooked the meat along with the onions and garlic. I put tomato sauce on the bottom of my baking pan so instead of water I mixed a little bit of tomato sauce in with the meat and taco sauce. Since I used hot Pace Picante chunky salsa, I only needed 1 cup. I was able to cook and mixed everything in one pan which made clean up a snap. I also added a can of corn, then baked them at 375 degrees for 45 minutes so that the peppers would be soft. Absolutely delicious.

I made  almost exactly as written, except for vegetarian. I used beans for meat. The cheese I used was much spicier than intended, ( out of Mex style) so our mouths were burning. Great recipe, will use again without spicy cheese!

I will definitely make it again! Very flavourful!  I used shredded Monterey Jack & Jalepeno Cheese instead  and it give it a bit of a bite which we like!

Well I have to say that I made these peppers but not exactly as the recipe calls for.  I was in a hurry for dinner and I had some red peppers that I needed to use.  So after doing a quick search I came across this recipe.  Actually the only thing I changed was that I used chicken instead of beef.  They were a big hit but next time I will definitely use beef.

No changes. They were very good, only problem --cheese topping got much too dark.it actually was too hard to eat. Next time I won't put cheese on top until the peppers are almost finished.  Additionally,  I ''ll cover top of peppers w/foil at the beginning,otherwise, the stuffing may dry out.  They were very very tasty.

Delicious!! My husband loves anything Mexican and these turned out perfect. I followed the recipe with some additions from other reviews. I did pre bake the peppers but we used Anaheim peppers. As I cooked the meat I added the onions to sauté them with it. For the water I used the juice out of a can of diced tomatoes and chilies . The rice I also pre cooked and added to the meat mixture after the meat cooked in the taco seasoning for a few minutes. This is my new stuffed pepper recipe and can’t wait to make them again!!

I used red and orange peppers. Didn't have Mexican cheese so substituted sharp cheddar. Also swapped brown rice for white rice. Turned out great!

used ground turkey, brown rice.  Also used the liquid from a can of Rotel tomatoes and chiles instead of water when adding taco seasoning and added 3/4 of the Rotel in meat mixture.  Put some of the cheese in the meat mixture as well after browning..  After stuffing, I put peppers in crock pot on low for 4-5 hours.  Put some salsa, rest of Rotel and a little water in bottom of crock pot.  Top with cheese before serving.  Had a good kick to it.  Yum!

Great recipe! I chose this one for stuffed peppers because I thought the salsa flavor would be great for some spicy kick and it is! Due to the comments about dryness in the recipe I used my own blend of seasoning instead of taco seasoning and I cooked the meat in marinara sauce and added diced tomatoes too! I also put marinara and some extra mixture at the bottom of the pan. It came out full of juiciness and flavor, delicious! I added chips at the end on the side...I will be making this again!

This was fabulous.  I made the filling almost exactly as per the recipe, except for the tortilla chips - I skipped those because I didn't have them - and I used ground chicken.  Also, instead of using whole peppers, I cut each pepper in half lengthwise, and there was plenty of stuffing to heap on top. They were delicious and I'm making them again right now (about 2 weeks later), this time with beef/pork mix.  I was worried the rice might be dry, but it was perfect - and I wouldn't change a thing.  If you do like your peppers more on the mushy side, you can cook them longer, but it wasn't necessary.  They held their shape beautifully, and were fork-tender.  Definitely adding these to the dinner rotation.

I keep making these over and over, because my husband keeps asking me to - and he never asks for anything!  We both love the flavors and are hooked.  I'll never use another Stuffed Peppers recipe!

So I changed a few things to make it a bit more appealing for a picky pallet.  I roasted the pepper for a few minutes on the stove (gas).  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and no taco seasoning (too much salt), substituted with chili powder, lime juice, garlic powder and chopped onions.  Also we used spicy Doritos which kicked it up a bit and mostly just put them on top.  And we topped with salsa and guacamole:)

Tasty but could have used more moisture.  I would add some tomato juice or something to the meat mixture next time.  I would also cook them for at least 40 minutes instead of 30.

My family loved this recipe, even my daughter who doesn't care too much for green peppers. I added the salsa, onion and garlic to the ground beef as I was browning it, then added instant brown rice. It was delicious.

I made this today and it was so good. I added fresh parsley, chives and soulfood seasonings to the recipe. This is my first time making Stuff Peppers. I will make this again and again.
