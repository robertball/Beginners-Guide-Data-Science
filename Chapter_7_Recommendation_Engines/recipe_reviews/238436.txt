This was a spectacular find. Was in a hurry and didn't have all the ingredients so a bit of modification was necessary. The recipe as written is for two and we were four. Also chicken tenders do not do this justice at all. We used boneless breast meat sliced and seasoned only with salt and pepper. We used fresh garlic (three whole cloves finely chopped) and sauteed it with the onions - rather than garlic salt. The Bok Choy is a perfect complement as is the cous cous. With the couscous we followed the box instructions for 2 portions and it was plenty for all four of us. Also we used feta cheese as it is what we had in the house. Regardless this was a huge success and one that we are all looking forward to making again - soon.

I enjoyed this recipe and will make it again love bok choy! It felt very healthy granted I added bell peppers too as an extra vegetable. The author's comment suggested rice as an alternative to cous cous and I did that since I had loads of rice in the cupboard. I've never heard of mizithra cheese and couldn't see it in my supermarket so used parmesan as another reviewer suggested. I didn't think the cheese went well with the dish - whether that's because I used rice instead of cous cous or because it was a different cheese I don't know but I now leave out the cheese altogether which also makes it healthier. The second time I added just a few small drops of soy sauce for extra flavour and I'd recommend that.

Cut raw chicken in cubes first and then added to onion. Sauteed covered until cooked through. Added chopped bok choy to to pot with chicken and onion and sauteed all. Then added some feta cheese. Served on top of rice and topped with grape tomatoes and more feta cheese. Husband loved it. Me too. Really easy and quick to make. Will make again.

This was one of the best meals we ever had. We had to substitute the Mizithra cheese with Parmigiano Reggiano. It doesn't require a lot of ingredients which makes it inexpensive and the bonus is that it took only approximately 30 minutes to make. It's a terrific meal to make during the week when your short on time! I highly recommend trying this one enjoy!!!
