The "off" flavor a reviewer described may be from cooking with "toasted" sesame oil (the dark one).  It is used for finishing, since it breaks down at high temps.  Untoasted (light amber color) sesame oil can be used for cooking.  Great flavor mix--simple and distinct.  I used 2 tsp peanut oil to coat before cooking, then tossed with 1 tsp toasted sesame oil after cooking to finish.

Given that it was 20 degrees in Wisconsin today, I'm sure I'll be forgiven that I didn't grill this. I tossed the asparagus with the soy sauce mixture right on a foil-lined cookie sheet, and roasted for 10 minutes at 425 degrees. I initially wasn't going to add the brown sugar but it was such a small amount I decided to after all. You really can't taste it, but I do believe it served to tame the somewhat bitter taste asparagus can sometimes have and mellow it out.  I loved the combination of flavors here--just make sure you don't confuse toasted sesame oil, which is basically a finishing oil, with regular sesame oil, or a lot of flavor will be forfeited.

I make this recipe all the time! I leave out the brown sugar and use 1/2 tsp. cumin. I make this marinade for french string beans (from costco) but use 1 1/2 of the marinade. I roast it in the oven at 425 for about 25-30 minutes. (For the stringbeans - I first snip off a corner of the bag, microwave it for 9 minutes then i put it into an oven-proof dish, pour the marinade on top and roast for about 30 minutes - until the top stringbeans wilt a bit. I top it with toasted sesame seeds. I always get asked for this recipe!!!

A terrific summer side dish!  I love asparagus on the grill, the smokey, charred flavor is delicious.  I steamed my asparagus for about 3 minutes inside, marinated, then placed on the grill with my pork tenderloin for a couple minutes to finish.  So happy you shared this!

I thought this was terrible on the grill.  The flavors were weak, and I could not get is as tender as I like it without the tips becoming charred black.  BUT, I wanted to give the idea of this recipe a second chance, so the next time I tried it, I cooked it in a saute pan instead of on the grill.  I was able to get it nice and tender, and still enjoy the tips, and enjoy the FLAVOR.  Since it cooked the flavors in in the pan as opposed to dripping them out and soaking up the smoke on the grill.  FOUR STARS IN THE PAN!!!

This was really good. I attempted to broil mine under the broiler. One minute it was fine, the next, it was mush. But we ate it anyways. Will definitely do again and pay more attention.

I followed the recipe exactly making no changes and these were amazing!  My husband complained when they were all gone.  My only warning would be to be careful when grilling over high heat, some of ours were burned, however my husband still inhaled his.

Excellent! My wife accidentally put the sesame seed on before the grill and it still turned out great! We put the asparagus in a BBQ fish-griller and turned frequently.

I don't have a fine mesh grill, so I cook small things on foil to keep from losing it down between the grates. I also lightly steamed the asparagus before grilling it. Turned out very tasty.

Added grape tomatos and sliced baby portabellos. Please note, I steamed the asparagus in the micowave a couple of minutes before tossing with sauce and placing on grill on foil palate.  Wonderful!

Loved this recipe!  Very strong flavors though so serve with a milder main course.

This was very tasty. I think if you followed the cooking directions exactly the asparagus would be too charred, make sure to watch them while they cook.  Great taste, we look forward to trying this again.  Maybe will even try it with broccoli.

This turned out amazing, even though I forgot to put on the sesame seeds.  I cooked them in the oven, by wrapping them in tin foil and cooking at 375 for about 10 minutes.  I have never been a fan of asparagus but after this recipe I am.

Wonderful!  I placed the trimmed asparagus in a loaf pan, poured the sauce over and let it sit while preparing the rest of the dinner, tossing the spears occasionally.  Cooked the whole dinner on the grill!

Nice idea as an alternative to the traditional garlic butter recipes. I used three bunches of pencil asparagus and did not even measure the ingredients, I usually eyeball ingredients on savory dishes. I also did not read the instructions like another reviewer and added all ingredients except the sesame seeds before grilling. Oh yeah, I also the asparagus and added sesame oil and seeds at the end. Great flavor! My boyfriend loved it!

This recipe is new to me. I was looking for something different for asparagus and this was definitely a winner. The only thing I did different was using coconut oil instead of sesame oil and it turned out great, the flavors really went well with chicken and ribs.

Made these to add some options for my vegetarian brother and his girlfriend when we had a barbeque. Turned out great! We all love garlic so I doubled the garlic and ended up skipping the sesame seeds at the end. Even a little extra toasty from the grill they tasted very good.

There were pretty good.  I made them as directed and grilled them for only a couple minutes on both sides directly on the grill.

Sorry, didn't like it at all.  I LOVE grilled asparagus but definitely did not like this marinade. I will stick to olive oil and sea salt from now on.

oh man, can i give it 6 stars? this is so stinking good! my husband said these were the best asparagus he's ever had and i tend to agree. definitely grill these, although i'm sure they're good broiled, there's no substitute for the taste of the grill and it goes sooo well with this! i copied the recipe exactly, except for the sesame seeds to garnish, just because i didn't have any. still amazing though. i'll never make asparagus any other way!

I made this the other night to go with Marinated Pork Chops (from this site). I put them in a grill pan at the same time the meat went on the grill and just gave them a little stir when I flipped the meat over. The tips had that yummy char to them, and the flavour was out of this world!

Great side dish with Grilled Mongolian Pork Chops!
I‚Äôve made this a several times now because of family requests.  If you like a little char on your grilled vegetables, follow the recipe.  I now microwave the asparagus first in the marinade on high for a minute and then finish them on the grill.
Once in a hurry, I left out the brown sugar and it was fine that way too.  Note that toasted sesame seed oil has a distinctive taste and is a key flavor to this recipe.

I did (as always when i grill them) over cook the asparagus slightly.  SUPERB flavor though!!!  All the flavors come through so nicely there is no need for salt and pepper (I know the recipe doesn't have it but people still tend to add it).  Thanks!

Good recipe... a little sweet and I cut down a bit on the grilling time so the asparagus was slightly firmer.

Coming from someone that doesn't like asparagus, these were GREAT! We used olive oil instead of sesame oil and we didn't use sesame seeds since we didn't have any. Very good!!!

These are great!  Probably the best asparagus on the bbq yet!  Have made a few times now.  Always a hit!  Still havn't put the sesame seeds on just because I havn't had any.  Can't wait to try them with the seeds!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made exactly as written and really liked these.  Usually I just coat asparagus with a little olive oil, sea salt and black pepper and grill.  I had bought sesame oil and seeds for another recipe and was looking for other ways to use them.  This was a nice change - a little Asian flair.  Will definitely make these again!

Soy and sesame are obviously a classic combo, and they work very well here with the asparagus.

Easy to prepare, all ingredients on hand.  Wrapped them in foil on grill and cooked until tender crisp.  The flavour was just ok, nothing spectacular.  However, they did have a nice texture being cooked on the grill.

These were just ok for me....the sesame oil seemed to take over and make them seem a little bitter.  I love asparagus on the grill, and don't even mind that the tips get a little crispy.  People ate them for sure, but we've had better luck I think with olive oil with salt and pepper and a little splash of lemon juice.  Timing suggestion was right on tho....Thanks!

This dish was pretty darn good!  I followed it exactly by the recipe, but due to being sidetracked the asparagus got to marinate in the sauce for about 15minutes, which I think made the flavor that much better.  It wasn't too salty.  I didn't really taste the sesame flavor.  I really liked it and will make this dish again.

anybody who says asparagus isn't good hasn't tried this recipe. I am in love with a broccoli recipe that is very similar to this one but uses butter instead of oil and cashews instead of sesame seeds. I didn't end up even using any seeds when I made this and used a smaller amount of olive oil (instead of sesame oil) but it was still delicious. I'll be making this again for sure

I can't believe it took me so long to review this. I have been making this recipe multiples times per summer, for about the last five years. With the exception of the sesame seeds, which I usually leave out, I always have these ingredients on hand and asparagus is one of my favorite vegetables. I would highly recommend.

Add a sprinkle of salt to the finished dish to lift it above average.

Good summer side dish.  I thought it needed a little something though, but I'm not sure what.  I even let it sit in the marinade for about an hour before grilling

Nice Asian twist with the sesame oil!! I love the aroma of sesame oil. I made it last night with all the exact ingredients. I never really follow the measurements with any recipe. I had extra marinate so I had my fiance baste it on the asparagus while grilling. This is an awesome recipe! When summer is over, I will try it on the stove. I believe it will be equally tasty!

This was a great change-up to the usual olive oil/garlic salt/cayenne pepper recipe I usually go with. Everyone loved it an I will definitely make this again and again!

This was an amazing and different way to eat asparagus.  I made this with soy-ginger salmon (martha stewart everyday food recipe) and it was the perfect match. Served with some wild rice pilaf and this is a meal I will make again and again.  I don't have an indoor grill so I just put it under the broiler for a few minutes they turned out perfect.

I was actually thinking that you could double the sauce for this and throw it in with the salmon in a foil packet and cook it would be awesome as well.  I am going to try that next week.  

Thank you so much for the recipe!

Ps I used the darker toasted seaseme oil and I had no problems with something tasting funny. I only tasted awesome

Wonderful flavor for Asparagus, especially if served with an Asian-flavored grilled salmon. Addition of scant 1/8 t. of Five Spice powder works wonders! No problem using toasted (dark) sesame oil.  THYMEFORME needs instructions on taste and textures of Chinese cooking...maybe just needs instructions in good taste!

These were good but not as flavorful as I expected.  I followed the recipe except I forgot the sesame seeds.  I think they may have been better with garlic powder and grilled in a foil packet.

We made this to go with lemon-rosemary salmon and rice pilaf. We cooked it on the Foreman grill since we don't have a grill and the oven was full; it turned out great! Next time I think I'll add a little more brown sugar, but other than that it was divine.

I like the idea of this recipe.  We love to barbeque and who wants a mess in the kitchen?  This recipe is easy, fast and has a nice flavor, I'll probably make it again.

This is a great recipe!!! This is how I got my kiddos to try and eventually love asparagus!  I  cook it in the pan vs grill and add 1/4 cup of water to make it a little bit more tender. Love the flavors together!

Yummy! I broiled it instead of grilling and it still turned out great!
