When I was a bartender near a doctors office , I had a doctor come everyday at happy hour for a walnut daiquiri . One day I ran out of walnuts . All I had was hickory nuts , so I used those . When he tasted it he said what is this ? I said " that's a hickory daiquiri doc :-)

This is a perfect, classic daiquiri!  My lime was quite tart, so it needed a tad more sugar, but that's easy to fix!  Thanks for posting this, Patrick Washburn!

I used Captain Morgan's Tattoo Rum and fresh lime juice in this recipe. DELICIOUS.
