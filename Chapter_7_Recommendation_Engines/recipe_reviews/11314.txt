I make these all the time. I've made some modifications to make them healthier (sub applesauce for some of butter, whole wheat pastry flour, less sugar, less jam filling), and my kids love them. If you make a double batch and substitute an egg for 1/4 cup of the butter, they don't crumble as much. I melt the butter and just stir it in.

I was a little skeptical on the taste of these bars since the ingredient list was so short, but WOW!!, was I amazed.  These are buttery, moist, crunchy and sweet.  Not dry or crumbly at all and SOOOO easy to make.  Definitely double the recipe because these disappear fast and the original recipe doesn't make that much.  I've also added 1 teaspoon lemon zest to the jam b4 before baking and it enhanced the flavor wonderfully.  Tip: if using cold jelly, warm it up about 20-30 seconds in the microwave.  This will make spreading much easier!   I used jelly with seeds and it tasted great, can't tell a difference.  These also keep soft and tender for days - so great for giving. You can't go wrong with this one - tastes just as awesome as the ones in my local gourmet bakery.  This will be my master recipe for these bars.

My husband said these were 5 star bars and I almost felt guilty...didn't EVEN tell him how little effort it took to make them! What a great recipe to go to when you need something sweet, home baked, don't want to make a major project out of it, and with just a few ingredients that you always have on hand!

I really like these.  I did bump them up a bit this time though.  I used seedless blackberry Polaner All Fruit and slightly less than called for (a double batch would call for 12oz and I used a 10oz jar).  I made a double batch in a 9x13" pan and greased it really well and had no trouble getting it out.  I also sprinkled the jam with a few handfuls of white and semi-sweet chocolate chips before adding the final topping layer and pressing it all in.  The key to this not crumbling is to really work the SOFTENED butter into the dry ingredients with your hand.  If you just stir it, it won't work enough of the fat through it and it will fall apart after it's baked.  All in all, a nice, sweet, easy, cookie.

When I make these and almost every other recipe for baked goods I replace butter and margarine with canola oil to cut down on saturated fats and hydrogenated fats.  I use canola in all my muffin recipes with great success I never use artificial sweeteners just cut back on sugars till I get it right. Diabetes can be difficult to manage in these days of convenience foods. I love Allrecipes nutritional information. When printing recipes go to advanced print options and check nutritional information for every recipe, this feature is fantastic.

These were delicious!  My only mistake was not leaving enough room between the raspberry jam and the pan, and so my raspberry leaked to the sides and was a little bit burnt.  It still tasted great though!

These were PERFECT in every way! Easy, quick, and delicious! I love to bake and do bake a lot and I get lots of compliments on my treats. These moist yummy bars were way up at the top of the raves. Try em.
The only changes - apricot jam (because that's what I had on hand). I doubled the basic recipe, sprayed 9x13 plus lined the sides with sprayed parchment. They were easy to cut and super easy to get out of the pan. I drizzled a tiny bit of white chocolate on top (not necessary). I almost forgot, I also added a tsp of cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture.

This cookie was great and really easy to make. I doubled the recipe and used a 12X8 pan, so they were nice and thick. The crumb topping took up the whole top so I drizzled some more jam on top to give it a nice color. I also drizzled white chocolate on them when they were cooled. They looked really pretty that way.

De-lish!! Made as written. Well, almost as written. I used raspberry preserves with tons of little seedlings and frankly can't see that this would make a difference either way. Mine were baked perfectly at 33 minutes in an 8x8 metal pan. I ate three because they wouldn't have looked well on the display plate, there were just too many. Three too many.

The bars were yummy! I made them for a cookie exchange and they turned out great! I added half a box of softened cream cheese on top of the raspberries then did the topping. As noted by other reviews if the raspberries come to close to the edge, after its baked you have to carefully separate it from the foil because it does stick. I cut them with an electric knife after they had cooled and that worked out great since they are a bit crumbly but they do firm up a bit when they sit for a while. I drizzled dark chocolate on half the batch. My husband liked them this way but I thought they were to sweet with the chocolate. Either way its a great recipeI plan to try it again with mango preserves since we have a mango tree!

These bars are sensational!!  I made them to take to a family BBQ and was asked for the recipe by everyone!  I did make a few small changes.  I doubled the recipe for starters because a single batch will not go far-trust me!  I melted the butter and added about 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I firmly pressed half of the oat mixture into a greased and foil lined bar pan.  I heated up the jam for easier spreading and crumbled the remaining oat mixture on top, pressing firmly into the bar.  I baked for 40-45 minutes and the result is probably the best oatmeal bar ever!! You will not be disappointed! I'll try different jams next time. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

Quick, easy, delicious.  For any of you who are wondering is substituting "quick" cook oats for the rolled oats will work - it worked just fine.  Can't believe how with such little effort and ingredients you can deliver something so delicious.  Saving this one to the recipe box for sure!

Everyone seems to love these.  I like to do them in throw-away pans and give the whole pan as a gift.  They look great with a little melted dark or white (or both) chocolate drizzled lightly over the top.  Be sure the jam does not touch the sides of the pan!

Because I hadn't made this recipe before, I did not double it, but won't hesitate to do so next time.  I took a few suggestions from others.  I want to cut back on fat and calories when possible, so I used the equivalent of 1 egg white from meringue powder and decreased the butter by 1/8 C as suggested (double recipe, replace 1/4 C butter w/ an egg).  And here is what I love about this recipe - it didn't compromise the crust a bit to do this.  Because of the oats, the crumb doesn't have to be super-tender (think shortbread or pie crust).  
Oh, and instead of measuring out 2 C of the crumbs to make the bottom, just measure out and reserve 1C of crumbs to make the top and dump the rest into your prepared baking pan.  That seemed easier to me.
They are delicious and even better - EASY!!!

WOW, this is awesome, very easy and very delicious chewy cookie bar.  When I found this great recipe, I made the two batches in the same week.  The first time I used strawberry jam and the second time I tried the black raspberry jam, and all the cookie bars came out wonderful and delicious.  I did not realize that I should use 8x8 pan but have accidently use 9x13 pan.  The result actually was surprisingly good on which the cookie bars came out thin and very chewy but also got plenty to share.  
By using 9x13 pan, I used close to a small jar of 10oz fruit jam.  I though this can be a useful information to share.  I totally baked 35 minutes for my cookies.  This recipe is great for any parties and you would not want to miss this easy and delicious cookie bars.  Really thank you Holly for sharing this awesome recipe.

These are fantastic! Also one of the easiest baked goods I've ever made. Everything goes into one bowl, which is awesome for clean-up purposes. I followed the recipe exactly, baked for  30-35 mins (allow for extra time if you use a glass baking dish), and the bars came out perfectly--the right amount of toasty on top, jammy in the middle, and soft and pliant on the bottom. I used fresh, organic raspberry jam I bought at a craft fair, and that freshness is what really sets the bars apart from other cookies.  Also, the fact that this recipe gives you a thick ribbon of jam through the entire pan of cookies, unlike some other recipes where you have to go searching for the jam. 

I've made three batches in less than a week, and everyone is asking for more. A keeper recipe, for sure.

Did as others suggested - dbld recipe, rubbed butter into dry ingredients with fingers, sprayed my 9x13 pan, patted in bottom layer firmly, put raspberry jam on top with a half cup of chocolate chips mixed in, patted top layer down lightly.  Came out of pan easily, no dry parts and tasted delicious!  Thank you for great recipe!

Vegan alert! I replaced the butter (the only animal product) with coconut oil. My husband almost cried because they tasted so good. Coconut oil has the same texture as butter. Try it. You'll love it! Much healthier fats! I even made it organic. Used my homemade organic raspberry jam too.

These are delicious!   Made exactly as directed, except put some white chocolate chips on top of raspberry preserves. Used seeded preserves as that's all I had - and its fine with/without the seeds.   Also, added about 1/2 c. of finely chopped walnuts to oatmeal mixture.  These extra things are not needed, but were sure good added to the bars.   Will definitely make these again!

very good and fast to make, added a pinch of cinnamon to the crumbs, was enjoyed by all!
When I make these for the homeless shelter where I volunteer, I triple the batch to bake in a jelly roll pan. I use 1.5 cups brown sugar, 3 cups rolled oats, 2.5 cups flour, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 1.5 cups softened butter, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 2.5 cups jam, bakes in 35 minutes, cuts into 48 squares.
If I use apricot jam then I use cardamom for the cinnamon.

This recipe is awesome!  I have made it several times. Not only is it delicious, it can be prepared in just a few minutes. I use my food processor to mix the dry ingredients with cold butter that was cut in pieces. A few pulses mixes it perfectly. As directed, I put 2 cups of the oat mixture into a buttered 7 x 11 glass baking dish. To the remaining oat mixture still in my processor, I add af few walnuts or pecans, and pulse a few times. I pour the mixture into a bowl and using my hands, I pick up handfuls of the mixture and squeeze the mixture to get it to form some small "clumps" before sprinkling mixture on top of raspberry jam.  I really think this taste better served the next day.  PS..I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 but I thought there was too much oat mixture. Next time I'll make make 1 1/2 of recipe for 9x13.

These bars are fantastic. I make them exactly as written and they always come out great. I use strawberry jam instead of raspberry, but I think it would also be tasty with blueberry. Be careful not to spread the jam too close to the edge because it will spread a lot during baking and can burn if it it's in contact with the sides of the pan for too long.

During the summer, I go u-pick blackberries and raspberries, freeze them on cookie sheets then store for winter in quart zip-lock bags.  Instead of jam, use a solid layer of whole frozen berries.  Delicious!

Rating 4 stars because what made these exceptional was the addition of almond and vanilla flavoring (not called for in the recipe).  I felt without the flavoring these were a little bland... I added the almond flavoring and these were FANTASTIC!  Almond pairs very well with raspberry!  I use an almond emulsion as emulsions are stronger than extracts and do not contain alcohol - order online from lorannoils.com.  Looking forward to making this with other fruit preserves such as boysenberry and apricot...

Wow, these are delicious! I really didn't expect them to be so tasty because they were so easy to make!
They were a little bit crumbly, but they still stay together fine. I used Smuckers Raspberry Jam (with seeds) and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Yum!

Great recipe! Very easy and delicious.  I did not use foil. I sprayed the pan with vegetable oil bottom and sides.  Instead of jelly, I used raspberry preserves (with seeds because that's what I had on hand). To facilitate spreading, make sure jelly/jam/preserves are room temp.  Then drop teaspoons of jjp on the bottom crust and smooth out with the back of the spoon. I had no problems with crumbling. Make sure bars are fully cooked. They're done when the edges are slightly browned and starting to pull away from the edges of the pan.  The hardest part: wait until the pan is completely cooled before cutting--or they will crumble. And use a spatula to remove bars from the pan.  Finally, I used a food processor. First put dry ingredients in the processor bowl and pulse lightly.  Then add cubes of cold butter. I cut the stick of butter into 8 pieces. Again, pulse lightly, just until butter is incorporated.  Much easier than mixing by hand.

Delicious.  I used a Swiss raspberry preserves, and they were great for a baby shower.  I also made them a week ahead and froze them, and they thawed beautifully the day before the shower in the fridge.

We liked these but it didn't wow us.  They were ok.  Not sure if different variations of jams or different brand might make a difference.

What a  satisfying treat this was last Sunday!  A perfect pick-me-up that the whole family loved.  The only change I made was, I used 100% whole wheat flour.  Thank you for a truly delicious recipe!

These were excellent! I love finding recipes that don't need tweaking, and this is one of them. I went ahead and lined my pan with foil, and created handles on each end. After they cooled overnight, I took them out using the "handles" and it made the task of cutting them much easier.  I had no issues with crumbling, and they looked so beautiful. Thanks for a super easy and delicious recipe :)

I wished I had read Tricia Jaegar's review first, and not bothered with the foil. Where some of the jam leaked, it stuck badly to the foil. These were delicious, although a little too sweet for me. So, I would prefer a little less jam and more "crumb" so I will use half as much more of the "crumb part, next time. I used Smucker's black raspberry and can't wait to try a red raspberry or a strawberry. In an attempt to make a little healthier, I used "Smart Balance" for the butter and my bars didn't crumble on me hardly at all. Next time I will try with an " all fruit" spread to make even healthier.

For a fruit filled bar recipe, these weren't too bad. I made these bars twice, once with raspberry preserves,
 and the other with a home-cooked strawberry jam, but I thought the raspberry preserves added more flavor. I'm thinking these bars would taste great using apricot preserves. Laying aluminum foil in the pan made it easy to remove the bars from the pan. I baked the bars in a glass pyrex baking dish for 40 minutes.

I had fresh raspberries that were on their last leg so made this dish exactly as described, except I used about 1/3 cup raspberry jam and about 2/3 cup mashed fresh raspberries. They are amazing!! It was the perfect use for the berries and the flavour is awesome! Thanks for the tip from another review to rub the butter in well, the bars aren't crumbly at all. I don't have a strong sweet tooth so I love the tartness of the fresh berry flavour.

The best jam bar I've found. These hold together well, while others I've tried were too crumbly or sticky. Lining the pan with foil not only takes care of the mess, it makes it easy to lift the whole sheet of bars out and slice them into squares. Just be sure to leave some overhang on two sides. We threw craisins in our jam and microwaved to plump the craisins and make the jam easy to spread.

I really can't complain one bit with these.  Buttery, pretty, chewy, didn't fall apart, easy to whip up, great warm and cold, great with several jam flavors, transportable and not overly sweet.  Love it!!

I was looking for a cookie bar that would be good and delicious, but also easy to make. I came across this recipe and my first thought was, "Wow, how easy and delicious this sounds", but then I started reading the reviews and I began having doubts. But since I really didn't have time to look for anything else, and I already had the ingredients for this I decided to go ahead and risk it. I was suprised with the results. It was delicious!!! Thank you so much! It was not dry at all, the sides were a bit crunchy, but if you let it sit a day or two they soak up some of the jam. It is not at all like a "bad granola bar". I personally loved the way the sides were crunchy and the center was soft and moist. It did not crumble at all, especially if you let it sit. I added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the "cookie dough", and when I do this again (which I will do:) I will add 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Also since I didn't have enough raspberry jam, I did half (oh, I doubled the recipe, and used a 9x13 pan) of raspberry and the other half of blackberry. Quite delicious! I used seeded, and it worked out fine. Well, hope someone else finds this usefull. And people, STOP being so pessimistic! :D

Ooooh, these little babies were tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly, even though I don't consider myself a raspberry fan.  Cutting the butter in was a little work, but it was worth it!  I lined the greased pan with parchment, then greased the parchment, and had no trouble getting them out of the pan.  They are a little crumbly on the top, so they are not really great for fingertip foods, but are delightful as a snack with a cup of tea, or as a bite of dessert after a week-night meal.  My family wants me to make these treats again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I included these bars in my Christmas cookie spread this year. I made them exactly as the recipe was written. Everyone raved, and they were the first to disappear from the platter. I have filed the recipe with my holiday recipes for next year!

Very good! I used Smucker's Simply Fruit (seedless blackberry was the only flavor the store had) and the bars weren't too sweet at all. I tend to like everything less sweet but I may actually add a little more sugar next time. If you use a regular jam or jelly, the bars will be sweeter, but the fruit spreads make these mildly sweet and completely delicious. I added 1 tsp of lemon zest to the fruit spread. For the crumble on top, I threw the remaining mix into the food processor and added a bit more room temperature butter and pulsed until it appeared more chunky/crumbly. It made the top nice and crunchy. The food processor is great for mixing the crust from the start as well, pulsing until blended. Thanks for the recipe! **Update: I made this again with Polaner All Fruit Seedless Blackberry, cut the flour and oats in half and put that entire crust mix on the bottom. Topped with the lemon peel and fruit spread, and then used the topping from the Blueberry Buckle recipe by JBS BOX. This is awesome! The topping is sweet, crispy, and adds so much to this bar. It sinks in to the fruit spread, but it's delicious. I highly recommend it.

These are verry good.  I used homemade apple butter, but only had 1/2 cup, so I added 1/4 of homemade peach preserve also, mixed them together.  ok, better yet sub CARMEL ice cream topping for the JAM and add 1/4 cup chopped pecans to the toppping mix... BORED OR LEFTOVER - crumble in bowl and add some milk.. very good.

These are delicious!  This works will all different types of jam! Blueberry is by far my favorite.  Also, I almost double the jam amount just because people seem to like them that way.  This is such an easy recipe!

These were good but a little too sweet for my taste.   I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry since it's what I had.  Maybe my jam was too sweet to begin with.  I think this would be great with cinnamon added as others have suggested.  I will make again but decrease sugar next time.

Me and my husband thought these were so good we almost ate the whole pan in one night. I didn't bother using foil so I just greased the pan and they came out very nice and clean. I used apricot raspberry jam. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

I saw this recipe and made them the next day...they just looked so good and they were!  I had to substitute white sugar for brown because I was out of brown sugar and molasses.  The texture and taste were still great though.  I also used raspberry preserves with seeds because it it what I had on hand.  Thanks for the great recipe...it's a definite keeper!

These are very good, but a bit crumbly. I'm wondering if the addition of an egg yolk would get rid of the crumbliness. I've needed to add a bit of cold water when mixing the ingredients because there is not enough moisture.  I've used both raspberry and apricot preserves in this recipe. IMHO, the apricot is far superior.  Also tried drizzling chocolate on top (on the philosophy that everything is better with chocolate.)  Would not recommend this mod.

I decided to make these because we had a jar of strawberry jam in the pantry that we needed to use up. Turns out, this was the best thing I have made in a while! I doubled the recipe to fit a 13 by 9 pan and added some chopped pecans to the top to give it some crunch. Thanks for the simple and delicious recipe.

These were deeelicious. Unforunately, my mom bought strawberry preserves instead of raspberry preserves, so I had to use those instead, but the cookie base is still really  tasty. I added a tsp of cinnamon, which really enhanced the flavour. As I like raspberries better than strawberries, I can't wait to try this with raspberry preserves instead! They will definitely -- no doubts about it -- taste even more amazing.

These are awesome!  Only changes I made was to double it, used margarine instead of butter, used strawberry jam (all I had on hand) and added some cinnamon to the crumb mix.  Baked for 35 mins in a 9x13 glass dish lined with foil and sprayed with Pam.  Had no problems cutting these or removing from the pan - just lifted the foil out.  Hubby and I each had one right out of the oven (almost too hot to eat!) and they were great!  The key to these is to really work the butter into the oat mixture and to press it firmly into the pan.  Really go to town on it to make sure the fat is evenly distributed.  Which is really fun to do when your mixing it by hand anyway!  I put half the mix on the bottom and half on top.  Also microwaved the jam a bit to make it easier to spread.  Can't wait to try raspberry and other flavors, too! **UPDATE** These kept well for over a week.  After eating them at room temp, hubby and I agree that they are on the sweet side.  Will cut down on the sugar next time.

These were wonderful. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I basically followed the recipe exactly as is. Since the butter came straight out of the fridge, I microwaved it for about 20 seconds to make it easier to mix with my hands. I used seedless blackberry jam (also microwaved it for 10 seconds to make it easier to spread). I covered the pan with foil and sprayed PAM on it, and had zero problems with sticking. Baked at 350 for 37 minutes. Next time I will reduce to 35 minutes, but at 37 they were fine. Everyone who ate them loved them- I even had someone tell me they were "divine." Great, SUPER EASY recipe!

These were fantastic!!!!  The only thing I added, not that it needed it, was melted white chocolate on top.  I took these to a potluck and everyone raved about them.  This is definitly a keeper

These are wonderful if you like oatmeal and raspberry.  I used unsalted butter.  I did not need to grease the pan.  I just sprayed the foil and when it was cooled I lifted it right out of the pan.  No pan to wash makes this recipe even better.  It's sooo easy.  Store them in the frig. in an airtight container.

Makes very tasty bars. I used raspberry jam with seeds and did not foil line my pan (just greased it lightly with butter) and they turned out smashing. Easy to make, the hardest part is waiting for them to cool!

This is so good and very easy to make. The first time I made this, I used strawberry jam.  I used raspberry jam for the second time. We like the one with raspberry jam better. Mine was brown in 30 minutes. Make sure you spread the jam to within 1/4 inch of the edge to prevent it from sticking to the side of the pan. Warm up the jam so it is easier to spread them.

This is definitely a keeper for me. It reminds me of the strudel you would get at a bakery, but this being a little healthier version of it. It is perfect for an on-the-go breakfast, snack, or dessert. The only thing I did to this recipe was add about 1 tsp. of cinnamon and about a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg since the mixture seemed a bit bland. It resulted in some amazing bars. Next time I make it I will add a glaze on top once it cools. Then the recipe will be extraordinary.

Holy raspberry cookie bars, BATMAN! These things are great!  I made them to bring to work and they were gone by 11am.  Everyone walked around saying "MMMmmmmm".  They are super easy to make too.  I cut the butter in with my mixer and had no issues. If you use the tin foil you can easily pull them out of the pan to cut.  Highly recommended!

I scaled the recipe to 16 servings because I have a 9x9 pan, and that worked great.  I added some chopped walnuts to the topping, too.

Chewy, with a crunch, and delicious! Maybe I'll put some extra jam next time. I can't understand why the recipe called for seedless jam - I used the regular one and it came just great!

This was a good recipe to make low sugar.  Just substitute Splenda brown sugar mix for the brown sugar, and use a sugar free jam!  Still turned out great, and much less calories/sugar.

OK, I added almond flavoring to the oatmeal mix, and drizzled it with cream cheese frosting flavored with almond. I also doubled the recipe because I was making a BIG batch for our Veteran's Day celebration. With over 25 different types of cookies and bars, mine went the fastest and people RAVED about them, going back for 2 or three more. The seeded raspberry jam didn't hurt the flavor or texture a bit - but I used a whole BIG jar of it. Very nice, and very pleased.

I didn't have raspberry jam, so made 1 batch with blackberry and another batch with strawberry.  I took them to our ABF group at church - one friend said she ate SIX of them and was having a hard time not eating more!  Will definitely make again.

I made these to take into the teachers' lounge tomorrow, but my family has already eaten 2/3 of the pan.  These are so good and so easy.  The only hard part was spreading the jam - it was pulling up on the bottom crust a little, but did not affect the finished bars.  I doubled the recipe for a 9X13 pan, but only incresed the butter to 3/4 cup.  I will definitely be making these again, possibly in the morning when the family is gone - maybe they will actually make it to the school.

These were super easy to make with only a few ingredients (that I always have on hand).  Great for sharing.  I didn't have raspberry jam so I covered half with apricot and half with blackberry and it was still delish.  Really work the butter into the crumb with your hands so it will stick together after cooking.  Enjoy!

Amazing - I ate the whole pan in two days.  I used a little more jam than called for (with seeds) and warmed it up like suggested by another poster.  Next time, I'll add finely chopped pecans to the mix.

The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly and they were amazing. I tried them again with some modifications other users suggested without success (half butter, half apple sauce, adding cinnamon and vanilla extract, and used apricot preserves, although this last part I did like). I recommend keeping the recipe as shared

I had a recipe like this years ago that I loved and had misplaced it.  So when I found myself with a lot of leftover raspberries & blueberries from our 4th of July bbq, I found this recipe and went to work.  I had so many berries that I made two 13x9 inch pans so that means I made TWO double recipes. One pan was raspberry & the other was blueberry. I made the berries into a jam like sauce first.  This recipe is so simple and so delicious.   I can imagine this with so many different jams.  I bet pineapple or apricot jam would be delicious.  Lining the pan with sprayed foil sure makes life easier.  I feel like I'm being somewhat healthy when I eat these.  Oats, berries...it's almost health food really!  Yes, I highly recommend these.  I recommend doubling all of the ingredients and making a 13x9 inch pan.  They do not last long.

Oatmeal Cookie Bars for breakfast! Why not :) They actually remind me of a healthier homemade 'toaster pastry'. I did do a lighten up makeover on the recipe. I replaced the butter with 2 TBS. of margarine, 1/4 cup apple sauce and 1 egg white. I also cut the sugar by half and used white whole wheat flour. That brought these little cuties down to 2 points each. I then followed another reviewer's suggestion and baked the bottom crust for 7 minutes, topped it with the jam and the rest of the dough and baked for another 25 minutes- perfect! I can't wait to try different jams. Today I used blueberry, yum! Have fun with it!
UPDATE:
I remembered to put lemon zest on top of the jam in my last batch, another reviewer suggested it. Fabulous! It brightens up the flavor with a subtle contrast.

Fabulous!!  I work at Starbucks, and I've been looking for a recipe for our Organic Blueberry Oat Bar, and this is the closest I've come!!  I used Smucker's Sugar Free Strawberry Preserves (10 cal/tbsp instead of 45 cal/tbsp!) and Brummel & Brown imitation butter instead...tasted WONDERFUL and cut the calories per serving from 219 to 146!  I've already got my second batch in the oven, thank you!!

I make this recipe all the time for my friends and everybody loves it. It tastes very good. I like to add toasted coconut, walnuts, sliced almonds or pecans on top which makes it even more delicious. It tastes good with apricot jam too. You can also make the dairy free version using unsalted margarine.

I made the recipe as written, except I used a round 8" dark metal pan.  Just 35 minutes to bake.  Next time I'll add a bit more salt to balance the sweet.  The crumble was a bit too dry, so next time I'll also add more butter or decrease the flour.  I'd recommend creaming the butter and sugar before stirring in flour & oats.  I didn't this time, and the texture suffered.

You can sub the oatmeal out with ground almonds, too - yum!  Good, solid recipe.  Oh, and I find slicing when they've just come out of the oven works best - that way nothing's got all sticky or brittle yet.

Excellent. I usually use margarine (because I bake a lot, and using butter all the time would be even less healthy) but that's about the only change I make. Sometimes I add almond extract to the oatmeal mixture after cutting in the margarine, it adds a nice flavor to the base and topping. I think other extracts (rum, vanilla, etc) would be nice, too. I sometimes use two different jams on separate sides for variety, and I prefer to use raspberry jam WITH seeds. I made a batch two days ago that had raspberry jam and I mixed about ½ cup chocolate chips into the jam before spreading it, and the raspberry chocolate flavor was great! Thanks, Holly, these are marvelous!

This was a very easy bar to make.  I did use a lower sugar jam, but instead of rasberry I did strawberry blueberry jam. Also I pressed the bottom down quite well so it did not fall apart when cutting. My kids loved this and so did I.  I am doubling it and taking it to a exchange student host party thsnks Holly it is sooooo good. Oh one more thing cook five minutes less than recipe states otherwise it will be overdone.  My oven gets quite hotter than others I don't know why.

Excellent! Tastes like chewy oatmeal cookies filled with fruit. After putting 2 cups of the crumb mixture in the bottom of the pan and spreading with jam, I didn't think what was left was enough for the topping so I made 1/2 a batch more of the oatmeal mixture to add on top. I am very happy with the way it turned out and couldn't wait till the bars were cooled for a taste.

This recipe sounded great and the reviews were so good that I had high hopes. It was way too dry and very crumbly; half the topping just fell right off. My kids hated it and my husband thought they were too sweet. It stuck to the foil (my fault really, I spread the jam too close to the edges and forgot to butter the foil) but they left an awful metalic aftertaste in my mouth (I'm never cooking anything in a foil lined pan again). If it hadn't been for that I might have been able to ignore how dry they were and finish off the batch. As it was I ended up throwing half of them away. :(

These are moist, soft and great textured cookies that are very easy and taste great.  Big hit with our family.  Will make them again!  I even made it with wheat flour, no sugar preserves and parkay light margarine to make it a tad bit heathier and they were wonderful.  It's a keeper!

This is a staple, easy dessert recipe that is easily transported wherever you're going, and loved by ALL who try it!  It is very good exactly  as written, and that's the 4 star rating I've given.  I've made it many times since, and have made some changes that my family and friends prefer.  I love the tartness of raspberries, but it kind of gets lost with the sweetness of the jam/jelly and the crumbed.  So instead of using jam, I use the same amount of frozen raspberries, let them come to room temp and slightly mash them with 2-3 teaspoons of sugar and a couple dashes of lemon juice to taste.  You can't taste the lemon juice in the bars; it just brings out and brightens the raspberries.  The rest of the recipe I make exactly as written.  I use more of the crumble on the bottom, and sprinkle the rest on top.  I don't like to completely cover the raspberry filling  because it looks so beautiful peeking out among the crumbles.  Be sure to gently press the top crumbles into the raspberry a bit.

These are so good!!!   I have made these many times but this night I decided to try something different.  I put baking paper in the casserole dish first.  The result was that the bars came out nicely and seemed to bake more evenly, not browning on the bottom first. They seemed more like bars that you would buy and I was able to cut them easier.  Very happy to have discovered this trick!

I used xylitol in place of the brown sugar.  Adding a spoonful of molasses would have made it more authentic.  I added about 3-4 Tbsp sugarfree vanilla syrup in the crumble mixture. I also scattered fresh raspberries and about 1/3 cup chocolate chips over the jam before crumbling the topping over the jam.  Sugarfree jam makes these bars perfect for a sugarfree diet!  

Taste is out of this world!  Serving warm as dessert, with ice cream.

I don't give too many 5 star reviews but these cookie bars tasted great and the recipe couldn't be any easier.  I will be making these again and will be trying some different jams.  I am thinking fig preserves would be great in this recipe.

These were a bit too sweet, but still very tasty! I think maybe adding lemon juice to the jam, and less sugar in the crust would be better? Would like to get it less sweet and "perfect", because they were so easy and convenient!
I did follow some of the reviews and, with a doubled recipe, used 1/4 cup less butter, and also added an egg to the crumb mixture.

Made these twice that past couple of days. First time I used organic strawberry jam and it was delicious. I was craving them again, but did not want to blast out my budget on jam. Found a can of Pillsbury chocolate frosting. Put about a half cup in the microwave for about 30 seconds, then substituted the chocolate for the jam.  Ran a bit, so will need to work on sealing sides better. But man-oh-man, is this fabulous!

I didn't have enough brown sugar, accidentally melted the butter because I wasn't paying attention.  Couldn't make the 2 C of the mix cover the bottom of the pan so I put the whole bowl in there and used a potato masher to pack it down.  Slapped the jelly on top, baked it, went for a walk, came back and devoured a piece.  These are REALLY good!  Even with my screw ups :)

This is an excellent bar cookie. Except for adding 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon as many reviewers suggested, and using apricot preserves, I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a pastry blender to cut the butter into the sugar mixture until it resembled coarse crumbs.  I also used old fashioned oatmeal. Two very good things about this recipe:  requires ingredients that most people have on hand, and only requires one bowl. So, this is easy to make at the last minute, and is easy to clean up as well. I would certainly make this again. I would definitely take it to a party, or give to someone who enjoys home baking. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I made these the other day for a dessert party, and I was totally the star. I was nervous serving something I had never tried before, but everyone was asking who made the bars, and how they could as well. 

I doubled the recipe and made a few very simple changes. 
1. I added a dash of cinnamon to the crumb mix.
2. I squished down some almond paste on the first layer before spreading jam. This was a GREAT idea.
3. I used blackberry jam, because that was all I had. I think this made it more unusual and exciting.

So again, super easy to make, and great. These were literally the talk of the party, among men and women. Dream come true.

Use a high quality jam, and you will be rewarded ten-fold.  I did not line the pan with tinfoil -- simply butter the pan beforehand, and you'll get perfect results.

Excellent bar recipe with ingredients usually on hand.  I wanted to use up some of my homemade orange/pineapple jam and it turned out perfect.  Followed the recipe exactly and the timing was perfect.  I like them refrigerated so that they are a little more firm and hold together better.  Thanks for this recipe!

Good and very easy to put together at last minute. I think it is perfect when you want a not too sweet treat. I subbed seedless blackberry jam for the filling. Kept the jam to within 1/4 inch of the edge and had no problem with leakage.

Ridiculously easy and deliciously awesome! I used E.D. Smith preserves for these and they weren't as sweet as I would've expected regular jam to be (more fruit, less sugar), which I preferred. I made a cherry version and a mango-peach-orange version and both went over very well with my coworkers! I didn't measure the amount I pressed into the pan for the base, as I was more concerned about an even layer and having enough of a base. --I loved the flavors and how they didn't turn out greasy, as this type of bar can sometimes be. Simply delicious!

Fabulous, exactly as written! Better the next day, by the way ... I definitely suggest lining the pan with parchment paper ... otherwise they would probably stick.

I needed to bake something simple from what I had on hand for a spur-of-the-moment gathering. Took a chance and am so glad I did. For something so simple, these are delicious. I already bought some blackberry jam to make them again.

Wow! This is replacing my former Raspberry Bar recipe that was very similar, but didn't have the right quantities. Mine turned out golden and perfect! I added the 1 tea. cinnamon that others had suggested and I'm glad. Next time I will try adding a bit of lemon zest to the jam, and using whole wheat pastry flour sub for 1/2 the flour. Minor changes to play around with it. This recipe is really excellent and made as-is is a solid recipe.

I added this to my holiday sweet table and it was a hit. The only changes I made was adding some shredded unsweetened coconut and some sliced almonds to the crumble. I used margarine as I needed it to be non-dairy and I doubled the recipe. It was fantastic, easy and delicious.

Oh, so good!! I've made them w/ and w/o cinnamon, and I can tell you 1tsp. of cinnamon is a MUST! I've also used canola oil in place of butter since I'm living in China where butter and margarine are kind of expensive. But boy, canola oil works wonders!! It's always a hit among my family and friends. My Chinese friends even like these! Now that's saying something! Oh, another thing, I used blueberry jam instead of raspberry. So yummy!! Thanks for the great recipe. Will use over and over again!!;)

Very good but not amazing.  I didn't have a problem with the oatmeal part crumbling as some reviewers did. I cut down on the sugar in mine by using Orchard raspberry preserves instead of jam and also using Splenda brown sugar blend.They were quick and easy and made with ingredients I always keep on hand, but I felt like they were missing something. Next time, I will try adding some cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture and see if that helps. Overall a good recipe though.

I was looking for a recipe that would use up the raspberries from our garden. I found this and even though it didn't use them up (we just ate them) I decided to give it a try. I doubled the recipe and while they were cooking my mom and I ran to the store and bought some vanilla ice cream. They were delicious and the leftovers we ate with breakfast. Will make this again.

I made these yesterday using Boysenberry Jam that I had on hand.  They are wonderful.  I read that some people had trouble getting them out of the pan.  I simply sprayed my glass 9"x13" pan with Canola spray and then when they came out of the oven I immediately loosened the sides with a plastic egg turner/spatula.  When they cooled and I cut them, they came out easily.  A bit crumbly on top, but not overly so...  just eat with a plate underneath to catch the crumbs...   Wonderful recipe.

these bars were not only delicious, but EASY too! I made these bars and completely baked them all while my infant son was taking a nap. When I took them out of the oven I drizzled a little white chocolate on top. MMM, I couldn't resist and cut a square while hot and was amazed how easy and intact it removed from the pan! Now, we will see how my husband likes them! :)

Great summer picnic dessert! I've tried both raspberry preserves and mango/passion fruit preserves, and both batches turned out great. I'm sure I'll be making using other fruit preserves as well.

Mmmm...they sure are delicious!  I love how simple these bars are too!  I did not line my pan with foil - just used a generous amount of Crisco.  I also added a handful of white chocolate chips over the jam and that added some great flavor.  But they'd be yummy without it too!

This is a good recipe. I changed it a bit by replacing 1/2 of the butter/oil with applesauce and only had strawberry jam & frozen raspberries.  I used a small jar of jam and added 1-1/2 cups of the raspberries to it. Next time I will try added some orange zest to the fruit and prior to topping it I will sprinkle chocolate chips to it.

I thought these were perfect.  I only used 1/2 cup of jam and reduced the butter from 8 T down to 6 T butter & 2 T applesauce...the texture & flavor was really good and just right for our family since we like not-too-sweet desserts.  I think next time I will just put the crust ingredients (except the oatmeal) into a food processor to mix and then stir in the oatmeal before pressing into the pan.

Wow.  Delicious.  Fast and easy.  Dangerously good, I already ate three bars and it's not even totally cooled yet.  I couldn't wait until it was cooled to cut into.  It did not crumble.  Thanks to all the reviews, I did not spread the jam to the edge of the pan, stopped about 1/4 inch from edge, perfect.  I also put wax paper on the bottom and sides of pan, no sticking.  Thank you for a great recipe and all the great advise from previous reviews.

i made these last night. if i could i would give 4 1/2 stars.  i doubled the recipe because i used a larger pan.  i cut them up after they had cooled a bit (but they were still warm).  DEELISH!  i didn't have seedless jam so every once in a while there's a bit of a crunch from the seeds in the berry jam i used.  i think next time i will add more jam and look to see if i can find seedless.  they were best warm out of the oven but they're good today as well (today they sort of remind me of a fig newton).

I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan & I didn't have quite enough raspberry jam so I added some strawberry and cherry jam to make up for it. I also added a dash of cinnamon to the oats and a splash of vanilla too (by accident, I add vanilla to almost everything I bake so I grabbed the vanilla out of habbit... its not neccessary but it does taste good w/ it!) . These are fantastic bars, the crumb topping was a little bit crumbly (isn't that the point though?) But the jam held it in place really well. If you're having problems w/ it you may not have mixed your butter in well enough or may not have pressed it into the jam enough before baking. I can't wait to try this w/ apricot jam or strawberry jam w/ white chocolate on top! I will sprinkle a bit of sugar on top before baking the next time I make these for a little extra crunch.

This is my go-to recipe for oatmeal bars each and every time, only ever varying the preserves.  Easy/quick to make and everyone loves it! I could eat the whole pan!  I mean...I wish I could eat the whole pan...

Way better than expected - took the advice to heat up the raspberry jam first.  They aren't super sweet which I really liked.

Love it. People were asking me today for the recipe.  I doubled the crust recipe and put it in a 9x13.  I found this recipe because I wanted to use some of the raspberries from the garden so I made my own sauce instead of using jam.  Took 15 oz. of raspberries, 3.5 tablespoons of sugar, and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in 3/4 cup water.  The pan is already half gone. SOOO GOOD!

these are great and so easy to make!! I added fresh, slightly mashed raspberries and blueberries to the jam- it really makes them THAT much better!  I would definitly recommend them- and sprinkle some sugar on top before baking!

SOOO  good, easy, and they taste like you labored over them for hours!!  Almost like a streudle-topped-pie in bar cookie form.  The perfect dessert to take to a friend's for dinner- kids and grown-ups alike found them delish.

Delicious!  I used strawberry preserves instead of raspberry, because that's what I had on hand.  These would be great with almost any flavor of preserves.  My kids keep asking me to make them again!

I wanted to make something my kids could eat on the go for breakfast and didn't want to give them store bought breakfast bars, and these bars are just right.  I used all whole wheat bread flour.  I doubled the recipe, and used grape jam with peanut butter on half then strawberry on the other half.  I will use more the next time.  I am looking forward to testing out differnt fillings.  I love how versatile the recipe is.  The bars are good, they tasted pretty healthy so I wasn't sure if my kids would like them as much as say a cookie.  They really liked them though.  I sprayed a glass 10x13 dish with pam and they came out really easy no mess at all.  They also held together good.  I did add an egg because it seemed really dry.  So now they can have a cup of milk, a banana and a nice hearty breakfast bar for the mornings we have to get out the door fast.  If you're just looking for a sweet treat this isn't it, but it is just what I wanted.

In no way did these turn out like bars at all.  I did use whole wheat flour so maybe that was it but they were more like rasp jelly crumble or crisp than cookie bars.  The taste is fantastic but a little too buttery for me.  I will try again with white flour and much less butter.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very easy, very good.  I did nearly melt the butter and that helped.  Also adding some lemon juice and zest to the jam and warming that to spread it well.

I'm totally in love with these. They are far better than any similar store-bought ones. Only slight change I make is to put some tiny slices of extra butter on top before putting it in the oven. This makes the topping a little crunchier more streusel-like.

Excellent cookies!  I warmed the jam in the microwave in a glass measuring cup so I could just pour it out on top of the filling.  Worked perfectly.  Next time I'll mix in the oats after cutting in the butter; was a bit strenuous with the oats in it.  Otherwise, no complaints and the cookies are delish.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved these bars.  I listened to the other user reviews as usual and here is what I did to make the ideal bars.  I mixed the batter by hand, taking time to work it between my finger tips. The more time spent mixing the better.  This will keep them from being "crumbly". It is also really important to press the batter into the pan.  Take care not to get too much jam near the side of the pan because it will boil up and burn.  I made a double batch and was glad I did!

These are soooo good!  I used seedless boysenberry jam because I didn't have raspberry.  These easy bars look beautiful, taste great, and you really can't go wrong!  I look forward to trying other flavors of jam and preserves--I think fig preserves would be amazing.

Very easy and very delicious.  I let these cool overnight before attempting to cut them and I had no problems with crumbling.  Instead of jam, I used apple butter and added some cinnamon as well.  I followed the advice of a reviewer and added an egg to the butter/flour/oats, but I won't do that next time.  Try this easy recipe!

Delicious and so easy! I used mulberry jam and sprinkled it with chocolate morsels. They were glorious and didn't last long! Make sure you let them cool completely and you won't have any problems with them crumbling. Also, make sure to line the pan with foil to avoid burning. A great dessert for any occasion!

Great recipe!  To prevent the jam from sticking to the side of the pan (as previous reviewers note), when I made the crust, I pushed it 1/2" or so up the side of the pan (like a cheesecake crust) so the jam would not be in contact with the pan.  I did not use foil but I did spray the pan with cooking spray and lined the sides of the pan with parchment paper.  Cookies came out of the pan clean!

I bake something weekly for my coworkers, and this week I baked these bars.  I used blueberry jam, baked it in a circular pan, and cut it like a coffee cake.  I drizzled it decoratively with some almond-flavored icing, too.  I was treated to such comments as, "Absolutely sinful.", "It's unfair how good these are." and "This is the best thing you've ever baked."  With those kinds of reviews, I'd say this recipe deserves five stars alright!

These bars taste great, are quick & easy to make (less than 10 minutes to prepare), and easily modified to accommodate whatever you have on-hand. I lined the pan with foil then sprayed it with canola oil. I accidentally melted the butter in the microwave so I just poured it into the dry mixture, stirred with a spoon, then crumbled with my fingers until the dough was well-mixed.  I didn't have enough blueberry jam so I spread it thinly over the bottom crust, sprinkled about 1/4 cup frozen blueberries over the jam, then sprinkled the rest of the dough over the top.  I gently pressed the dough down with my hands to make sure it stuck together.  They tasted SO GOOD! Each time we've made this (with whatever--jam, jelly, honey, Nutella), it was wonderful. I recommend doubling the recipe to a 9"x13" pan because the 8"x8" pan just doesn't make enough!

So easy to make and so good! I doubled the recipe and made them in a 9 x 13 pan. They didn't turn out crumbly at all like other reviewers said. I added these to a tray of all the goodies I made for the holidays and brought it to work and these bars were one of the first things to go, people loved them. I was asked for the recipe many times. I will definately keep these on my holiday baking list. Thank you.

Nice flavor and quick to make.  I also added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the oat mixture.  Best to work the softened butter into the oat mixture with your hands.

These bars were a BIG HIT for my morning department meeting.  I doubled the recipe and added 1/8 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the half of the mixture you put as the bottom of the bar.  It also says seedless jam.  If you cant find it, use raspberry perserves w/ seeds.  It is great!

This was a huge hit w/ my dad, who isn't a big sweets person.  It was very easy to make, and I ended up using strawberry jam by accident--it was still great!  Thank you soooo much for the recipe!

EXCELLENT Cookie Bars!!!  I doubled the recipe using raspberry jam instead of jelly and baked them in a 9 x 13 pan for about 45-50 minutes.  They turned out perfect!  Golden brown, just the right sweetness and very tasty!  This is a keeper!  Thanks so much Holly  :o)

They're tasty but a little too crumbly.  Maybe I didn't press the base down firmly enough?  Thanks Holly.

I did like it, but it was not what I expected.  It had great raspberry flavor, i guess it's the texture that I really didn't care for.  It didn't turn out like any bar recipe i've ever made at first it was more like a thick bread pudding consistency and when it completely cooled it was still way too moist, it needed to be a bit more firmer, i'll work on that the next time i make it, and I will.  I did add about 1/2 a cup of fresh raspberries in the batter and on top and deffinately added, if I hadn't done that the recipe would have lacked good raspberry flavor.

These have good flavour, but I would make a couple of amendments.  I would use less of the crumble on top and use a bit more raspberry jam.  Cooking time is right on.  I'd probably cut back a smidge on the dry ingredients.  Pretty good for an easy recipe.

These have become my go-to bar cookie recipe. I just use freezer jam, which is nice and sweet. They are easy to make and you can cut them into small bars for just a snack.

These turned out very well! A great way to use a bunch of jam just sitting around. Plus this recipe doesn't call for many other ingredients, so it's easy to whip up with little prep. I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the result. The only problem was that they turned out a little overdone, even when cooking them the minimum time, but that's likely down to my very imprecise oven. I would definitely recommend these bars when you're looking for an easy, tasty dessert that's slightly out of the ordinary. Or when you just want to get rid of a ton of jam.

I tried this last night and my husband and I just about killed it! The only modifications I made was adding about 2 tablespoons of soft butter to the crumb mix for the topping and I pressed it down into the jam, I used blackberry and it was awesome, and we had no problem with the topping falling off. Also, I baked it in a 9x9 pan and it was a perfect depth for a bar cookie. I think thinner (a 13x9) would have made the bottom too hard. And when I wrapped it up I cut it and put it into a double wrapping of Saran and it softened up nicely without getting mushy. Wonderful Recipe! Thank you. This is now our all time favorite.

So good and so easy! I've made these a few times and they always turn out great. I melt the butter and mix it into the oat mixture with my hands.  I also usually use 1c jam instead of 3/4c.  But this recipe is a 5-star without any changes!

Just like the other reviews, this recipe is super simple and really delicious. Make sure to hand mix the soft butter into the mixture, mine came out moist but not too crumbly! Definitely will make it again.

Awesome! I microwaved the butter too long and it melted. I just stirred it in with a spoon and it still turned out perfectly. This was a hit at a dinner party we had. Definitely will make this again.

This recipe is much better and healthier when you substitute the butter with Coconut oil . Just use slightly less Coconut oil than the 1/2 c butter.

This recipe was a huge hit at my office potluck! I doubled it, added vanilla and a dash of lemon juice to the jam, microwaved the jam a bit so it would spread easier, and added a dash of cinnamon to the cookie dough. So good!

I loved the description and simplicity of this recipe so I added it to my recipe box and have tried it out twice thus far. I would like to say that it is a terrific recipe for using up all those jars of half full jam sitting on the counter top. I personally had about 5 different varieties to use up - so I did. combining the leftover jars of raspberry jam, blackberry jam, sour cherry jam as well as dried blueberries. The result was a delicious chewy mix of berries. The one point I want to make is that I feel the proportion of butter is too little, as is the jam. First time I used 1/2 cup of butter but the dough was too dry and crumbly. I also increased the jam to full cup but still not enough. Second time I increased the butter to 3/4 cup and doubled the portion of jam. still both ingredients are still not enough for the portion of flour & oatmeal. The next time I intend to increase the butter to full cup and use as much jam is needed to cover the entire top before sprinkling the top with dough. Also I used the tip from another review & used baking paper to line the pan - the bars came away cleanly every time! Highly recommended recipe. simple and delicious! Huge thank you MARBALET for sharing this recipe!

I loved the recipe and it would have been great if I made it "as is".  However, I made some adjustments, and it was wonderful.

As others have suggested, I doubled the recipe and replaced 1/4 cup of butter with an egg.  I did not use jam, but rather used 5 cups of fresh blackberries mixed with 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of flour.  My guests and family loved it!

I bought  a delicious looking raspberry spread at Costco tonight so raspberry oat bars were in order. I've made fruit and oat bars before but these are really, really great. Followed the recipe, no effort, room pleaser!! This is my new "go to" summer dessert, which is usually Bake Sale Lemon bars from this site.

Was wonderful and versatile! Made it! as is , the first time and it was fantastic but have changed it to go with ingredients on hand.  I now add crushed almonds to the crumble for the raspberry version. To make a cranberry orange version, i add toasted pecans and cinnamon to the crumble along with cranberry relish and orange zest for the filling. Have also made it with blueberry filling.  Always a hit!

I added a teaspoon of cinnamon. After mixing everything together, I measured out a cup for the crumb topping and added a little extra butter to the crust portion to help it stick together better; if it sticks together when you make a tight fist, it's ready to press into the prepared pan. I baked in an iron skillet lined with foil smothered in butter so that it would come out round and serve it like pie. I delicately cut into pie slices and served warm. I cut the whole "pie" completely because I was afraid when it cooled it'd crumble more easily (it shouldn't if you're gentle). These are amazing and am thinking of taking these to our family tea on Valentines Day:D

SUPERB! These are absolutely addicting and SOOOO delicious!!! Another plus??? It takes no time at all to throw these together. For as basic as these are, the flavor is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Even without additions (I wanted to add cinnamon as others have done, but forgot to...), these were P-E-R-F-E-C-T. TIPS: Be sure to NOT spread your preserve / jam layer all the way to the edge of your pan! Keep in mind that as the jam heats up, it will thin out a bit and continue to spread (which is why you need to leave a border). Also, these seem to keep better if refrigerated but that's a matter of preference, I guess - I like my bars to be firm rather than crumbly. And, whatever you do, LINE YOUR PAN with FOIL (I am SO glad I did!). Clean-up will be a BREEZE and you'll have one less dish to clean! A drizzle of melted white chocolate made these extra special. Thanks for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe, MARBALET. I can't wait to get creative and try a combination of other fantastic flavors! :-)

The whole family really liked these bars but hubby loved them. He has asked for them again and it has only been a week since I made last batch. I used the raspberry jam but I can see using different ones in this recipe. Just the right amount of crunch, sweet and color. A definite keeper.

I really worked the butter in with my fingers to get that sandy texture and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon/sugar. Once I had the crust pressed down I ended up using 1 cup of jam to get it to cover. I didn't spread it to the edges though as another reviewer suggested not to. Baked until golden, about 35 minutes. Came out great. Tasted wonderful. Thank you MARBALET.

Made these GLUTEN FREE and VEGAN - delicious! cutback some on the sugar, added almonds, used Jewel's GF All Purpose Flour, GF oats, vegetable shortening instead of butter, and used sugar free jams - pear has been my favorite.

I needed to use up some homemade peach jam so I made these cookie bars.  It was very quick and easy and a great vehicle for any flavor jam/jelly.  They are very buttery and delicious.  I didn't use foil in the pan, just sprayed really well with Pam and they came out fine.  I made as per the instructions but next time I definitely will add chopped nuts at least to the topping. Thanks!

It was so yummy! It really paid off patiently cutting up the butter and rubbing it in. Put it in the oven for 37 minutes and they aren't too crumbly (: Thanks for the recipe!

These are just what my sweet tooth ordered!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I threw in a few dashes of cinnamon and used raspberry preserves (with seeds) and the seeds were undetectable.  I will make these again.  These were quick and easy.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Easy to make, key is having the butter soften so you can mix everything together and it all holds together..  I used strawberry jam since that is what I had.  Tasted great.

I made these because my boyfriend was craving those starbuck's oatmeal fruit bars and we couldn't find them at our three local 'bux.  He raved and said these were way better than buying them at the coffeeshop. I agree. Delish!!

Fabulous! Thin the jam a bit with water or lemon juice to spread more easily. I added some flax seeds and may try coconut next. A keeper for sure

I made these the other day, only change I made was I had fruit in freezer I wanted to use up, so I thickened up my own raspberries and used that instead of jam, I really liked this recipe and will do it again, but I do prefer my squares a bit thicker...that is my only complaint on this recipe. I think next time will double the base and maybe try something other then raspberry, as I'm sure whatever fruit you use these will be really good.

Used Splenda , Molasses, & Honey instead of sugar. Also, used White Whole Wheat Flour & my grandmother's fig preserves. Very yummy cross between an oatmeal cereal bar & a fig Newton.

These were really good for a healthy cookie bar.  I added a little more jam than called for to make them more moist.  Definitely be careful to not spread the jam to the edge!

These were ok. Next time I'll try and add something to the crust b/c it was a little bland for my taste. I might go a little heavier on the jam than I did. I was a little short so I think I ended up only putting about 2/3 of a cup in it and I"ll spread it a little closer to the edge. I was worried about it leaking out and burning based on some of he reviews so I left about a 1/4 around the edges which didn't seem to be necessary. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is b/c of the crust being bland (not b/c I used less jam :) ) which would be my fault.

Made these with black raspberry jam as part of my holiday treat boxes that I gave as gifts to co-workers and they are delicious and so easy to make. One of those fool-proof cookies I will come back to again and again. Only problem? I couldn't stop eating them myself!

These were good.  I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 lined with parchment paper.  I may try and cut down on the butter by 1/4 cup next time.  Mine had an almost greasy taste (especially around the edges).  And I will probably add a little more jam as it seemed to soak into the base a little.  But that is my personal preference.  I will definitely be making these again and will experiment with all different kinds of filling.  I'm sure these would make excellent oatmeal carmelitas.

This recipe really delivered.  I loved it! :) I used strawberry jam (what I had on hand) and it was yummy.  I also drizzled softened cream cheese over it. Some of my kids liked it and some did not.  I can't wait to try it with raspberry jam and sour cherry.

I used 6 T of butter and it was fine. I added 1/4 cup chopped almonds to the dough. Did not measure the jelly, but pretty sure I did not use more than 1/2 cup.

These were really good. I did add about 1/3 of a cup of chopped almonds and should have removed 1/3 of a cup of oats so they were a little bit crumbly-but that was my fault not the recipe.  I also used Bing Cherry Jam from the Ball canning recipe book with 1/2t of almond extract added to it. Great flavors. My husband said he didn't care for them, though he had no problem eating them.  He said he didn't like the cherry flavor-whatever, he likes it good enough in his yogurt.  He just isn't into fruity desserts.

These are by far the most requested dessert I make.  I have made them perfectly each time just by following the directions.  My kids, friends and family fight for each bar I make and I can't seem to make them enough.  You really won't be disappointed if you make them as directed.  Make sure you always grease the pan AND grease the foil.  That can be where some raters had problems with the stickiness. Good luck and always try again.

Great recipe! I only had dark brown sugar on hand, but aside from a deeper brown color - it didn't detract from the flavor. I mixed in the zest and juice of a lemon to the warmed raspberry jam (to cut the sweet a bit), and topped the bars with chopped walnuts before baking - to add a little interest.

This was so simple and great tasting.  I used grape jelly instead it was gone in no time.  I will keep this and use again and again.

Inplace of the jam, I blended some fresh strawberries, a little bit of sugar, and a banana in a blender. It was like a fruit granola bar. Yummy.

I dont know what I did wrong, but the second step that says to spread jam on crust didnt go so well for me. It pulled up on the crust as I spread so then I decided to dollop the jam by teaspoonful and it ended up being a big jammy/jelly mess.

This was pretty good and fairly easy to make.  I had two complaints about it though: the jam is very hard to spread evenly on the crumbly mixture and the taste was lacking in tartness.  I'd recommend using a spoon to blob the jam all over the crust and a fork to smooth each little blob out over the mixture.

I really enjoyed these cookie bars..SUPER easy quick prep. I chose to use a mixture of raspberry preserves and seedless jam. I also put a fresh raspberry on each Square (around 9?) then lightly drizzled some honey along the top...yum yum.

Yup these are delicious. Very easy to make. I used sugar free raspberry jam and it still had the perfect amount of sweet without being too sweet.

These are delicious.  They were a little crumbly when warm, but I refrigerated them overnight and had them for breakfast (makes a great "bar").   Reminds me of a favorite aunt's "Thumbprint Cookie".

I used no sugar Polaner raspberry spread and this was still very sweet.  I was a bit shy of the 3/4 cup, so I added a couple tbsp of some sugar plum jam which may have accounted for the super sweet flavor.  This was so easy to make and tastes pretty decadent.  I would think that you could successfully sub just about any flavor jam in this recipe.

Yummy! For more flavor I added 1/2 t. vanilla and 1t. almond extract to the "dough". I sprinkled 1/4 C. mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 C. white chocolate chips over the raspberry jam.

These are good and very easy to make.  I used an overflowing whole cup of jam and am glad I did.  I think the crust/topping could use a little more flavor--maybe some nuts mixed in or some cinnamon and vanilla.  But all around a great recipe as is.

Excellent recipe! I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 inch glass pan and used about 2 cups of filling (blueberry, raspberry, cherry jelly). I also added some vanilla extract and lemon zest to the cookie part of the recipe and it came out great!

Very good, quick and easy, but I would have preferred a different filling (something less jam-y) but all in all a good bar and would totally reccomend! Crumb topping was amazing!

GREAT and SIMPLE recipe! I used bisquick to replace flour salt and baking soda. i also used coconut oil in place of butter since we have a dairy allergy in the family. and a final touch: added 1/2 c. coarse chopped almonds to the top layer! THIS IS ALWAYS A HIT IN OUR HOUSE!

These are very yummy!  I did change a few things, with great results.  I used half whole wheat flour and added ground flax seed.  I also put walnuts on the top.  They are a bit crumbly, but it didn't bother us.  I made these as a breakfats alternative for my kids...hence the reason for my healthy modifications.

Good but not great. The batter on the bottom held together well, but the top was very crumbly. Used my food processor for the crumb mixture which made it easy. I won't make these again and look for a better fruit bar.

I just made this, and it turned out great. I mainly chose it to use up some fresh raspberries I had, so I made my own quick jam with them. I also added some dollops of cream cheese (mixed with sugar and vanilla) on top of the raspberry layer, before topping it with the remaining crumb mixture. It added a rich, cheese danish taste to it. Yummy!

Just as easy as it sounds! Instead of lining the inside of the pan with foil, I surrounded the outside of the pan with the foil along with making sure to butter the inside. I took the foil off of the pan for the last 10 minutes of baking to allow them to become golden brown on the underside. Wonderfully easy yet delicious recipe!

This is probably one of the most delicious, yet SIMPLE, recipes that I've tried in a while.  I do suppose it helps that I have this insane obsession with all things raspberry, but everything about these bars turned out wonderfully.  My fiance, who tends to be a bit more conservative in his baked-goods consumption, devoured these bars in no time!  Thanks for sharing, Marbalet :)

This is absolutely genius. It's such a simple, easy recipe, and yet it produces a dense, rich oat bar. I used homemade preserves, and it was delicious. Next time, I'll consider layering dark chocolate in the place of preserves. The best part is how nicely it cuts up into bars. This is perfect for a bake sale or cookie exchange.

This was VERY good! I even made it with shortening instead of butter since I'm allergic to dairy and it still was incredibly yummy. Everyone at the party I took them to raved about them. Definitely double the recipe and make a 9x13. Use plenty of the jam (with seeds is fine). And if you use shortening, double the salt. That's the only change I'd make. Thanks for the great recipe!

Since I noticed so many flavour variations, I tried this recipe with left over whole berry canned cranberry jelly and it turned out very well!  I added an extra 1/2 cup of both oats and flour.  I also added slivered almonds, and could have added some cinnamon.  I'll try again, it was quick and easy and very tasty.

Very easy with simple ingredients.  I did not have raspbery jam, so I used fresh berries that I crushed and added some sugar to; worked well.   I also added about half a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  My teenage son and husband both asked why I didn't make a bigger pan.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for recipe.

This is a little on the sweet side, but I only had blackberry jam and it's not as tangy as raspberry jam, so I could see that working with the other jam. I wanted to make it higher in fiber, so I subbed white whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup of flax seed meal and one egg to balance out the lack of liquid.

These are very good, I took the advice of others and added cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I imagine it might be a bit bland without it.  Moist and chewy and crumbly all at the same time, great with a glass of milk.

This recipe is D-licious!! I did change the recipe though. I was trying to copy some Cranberry Apricot Oat bars that I've had before. I replaced the raspberry jam with apricot jam and whole cranberries. First, spread the jam, in the same way as the recipe states, than follow with  covering the jam with a single full layer of cranberries. Try to make almost a solid layer of cranberries with a little bit of room for the topping to fall into. It did take a little longer to bake.. about 50 minutes instead of 35-40. Everyone loved them though. Great recipe! YUM YUM YUM!

Five stars for the simplicity of the recipe, the everyday pantry ingredients, and the wonderful taste. Next time I will melt the butter as opposed to merely softening it. So, so good!!

Makes a great breakfast, snack or dessert.  I've made these with Sugar Twin brown sugar-still great.   Try apricot, orange marmalad, and peach, too.

These are just great.  They are very quick and easy but taste like you spent a lot of time working on them.  They sort of taste like a nutri-grain bar...but richer and better!  I didn't have enough butter thawed out so I subbed 1½ T. canola oil.  Still came out great.  I will be making these quite often.

I really liked the way this simple recipe came together. It IS really important to incorporate the softened butter well and just for variation, I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the mix. When cooled and cut into squares, I lightly drizzled melted white chocolate over them. The cookies turned out nice and like the name states, delicious.

So easy to make and my hubby loves them!  I don't think you can mess these up even if you try.  I didn't read to only put the jam 1/4 inch from edge so I managed to get them a little stuck in the foil and I also got busy talking to a neighbor and overbaked them a little.  No problem..they still were wonderful and I will make them again soon (although this time I will pay more attention).

Instead of raspberry I used extra crunchy peanut butter which I heated slightly in the microwave.  Spread on the oat mixture then sprinkled with chocolate chips and the remaining mixture, then baked as specified.  Yummy

These were outstanding.  For the holidays, instead of raspberry, I made them using fresh cranberry sauce.  I boiled the fresh cranberries in a little sugar water and boiled a few minutes after the skin popped to make thicker ti give it a jelly consistency and added some lemon.  They were a big hit at church!

wow, i'm not impressed, and i had to make it 2 stars. this was an imbalanced recipe--the crumble is the wrong match for the raspberry jam. it is more suited to apple or peach.

I doubled the batch, did as another suggested and added 1 egg and reduced butter to 3/4 cup. Replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with wheat germ and added two heaping tablespoons of vanilla protein powder. It's delicious!

loved that this was easy and easy to make adaptions to.  I used spelt flour, and earth balance (dairy free butter) and they turned out pretty well.  i think the only thing i wasn't crazy about was the spelt taste.  Will make again!

These are my best bar cookies that I make of all time! They are so easy to make but are so rich and wonderful to bring to events. My friends always beg me for the recipe and my family always begs me to make them on the holidays! A perfect dessert to bring anywhere! They are always a crowdpleaser and they go real quick so I make double portions. I have also used both blackberry and strawberry jam as well and their just as excellent!

I love this recipe.  Super easy to make but tastes delicious.  One of our family favorites.  I also doubled the recipe because it goes fast!  Used raspberry jam with seeds.  Will try drizzling white chocolate on top next time.  Also, perfect dessert to take to potlucks.

Brilliant! This recipe is so simple, yet so perfectly delicious! Whoever thought this one up deserves an award!  The bottom crust is merely apple crisp topping pressed hard and moulded into the pan, followed by melted jam, and topped with more apple crisp topping.   (for 'crisp' lovers, this recipe is a dream!!!!)  Whoever suggested lining the pan with greased tin foil: Good thinking. While I didn't have too much trouble getting the tin foil off the edges where the jam seeped through, I could imagine if a greased pan without lining were used, it would have been a nightmare!  Great recipe! Will make again!

I made a healthier version of these, substituting natural applesauce for half of the butter.  It turned out really well.  It kind of reminds me of a fruit and grain bar.

Delicious! A bit easier way to get the "crumbliness" with the butter: soften butter, add it to dry mixture, then use a knife to cut the butter through the mixture. Works way better than your hands, and it's not as messy. Other than that, I didn't change anything about the recipe and they are amazing!

Yesterday, I had a crumble bar from Starbucks, but I was so disappointed I was inspired to find a recipe to make my own. This was the right choice! They were a HUGE hit at my house - I can't believe how easy they were (and how impressive they looke!) My favorite part was that I already HAD everything in my house - sugar, flour, butter, oats? I didn't have to go out to buy extra ingredients! I only had strawberry jam on hand and used that instead, but it is still INSANELY good (and so easy!!!)  Next time, I'm going to try blackberry jam. Wow, these are winners. 5 stars all the way baby!  ^__^

These were very good - I doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. The only other change I will make next time will be to use an unsweetened "all-fruit" jam to cut out some of the sweetness and try half applesauce for half of the butter.

Easy and great tasting, but don't hold together too well - is it because there is no egg in the recipe?  Will try adding one next time.  Would be just as good without the jam too!

Really nice, quick recipe. I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon over the jam before adding the crumb topping. I didn't bother lining the pan with foil and I had no problems removing the bars.

Delicious.  I used quick cooking oats (was all I had in the house) and still turned out beautifully.  I also doubled the recipe and baked them in a 13x9 inch pan.  Used sugar free marionberry and loganberry jam.   Thanks for sharing.

My mom requests these all the time! They're one of those desserts that look like you put a lot of time and effort into it, when in reality they're extremely easy. I've also tried cutting up some chocolate pieces and sprinkling them into the jam. I'd recommend using something smaller, like mini chocolate chips, rather than something chunky. And be warned: if you add chocolate to this recipe, it makes for an extremely sweet bar! They're excellent as is.

Funny. I had thought this was a family recipe, with the unique name and all. Turns out, this is a typical recipe. Heh.
This has been a favorite of mine since childhood and it's something my grandmother made for her kids when money was tight. (Flour and oats were cheap
and jam was homemade.) It's a great recipe to make with your kids, too. Pass it down another generation!

To imitate Starbucks' recipe, I substituted fresh blueberries for jam, and I used whole wheat flour instead of white. I added half a teaspoon cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla in my doubled recipe. I actually found this recipe while in search for one that would match Starbucks.

I loved these!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. They were definitely firm enough and didn't crumble. I dusted powdered sugar and some extra brown sugar on top after they came out of the oven. Great for dessert or even a sweet breakfast treat! I'd love to try drizzling chocolate over it.

I haven't come across a recipe in a long time that completely satisfies my extremely picky sweet tooth. This recipe did just that- the mix of tangy and chewy filling and not-too sweet cookie was divine. This dessert bar felt like eating a heartier version of the Starbucks' fruit cobbler bar. I took note of several changes other bakers mentioned: added 1 T lemon juice to microwaved (25 sec) preserves, 2 t cinnamon,

I made these three days ago for a BBQ.  and they are still good several days later.  I read that some people had problems with it being more crumbly and not sticking together.  What I did to prevent this is make sure I pressed down on both layers and then when it come out you need to make sure it cools all the way, I did for 2 hours because I read that on another similar recipe.  I didnt have any problems with it staying in bar form.  I also added sliced almonds to the top layer.

I made this recipe out of pure desperation.  I remembered hours before going to my in-laws for dinner that I had to bring a dessert and I happened to have all of the ingredients in my cupboard, which included jam that I hated and was going to throw out anyways.  This turned out AMAZINGLY well!  Chewy and so much flavour.  Don't hesitate to make this one.

WOW these are so easy to make. They are  moist, sweet & crunchy. Everyone loved them. I doubled the recipe because these disappear fast. Made these a number of times. I've also made these with lemon, strawberry & peach, any jam you like works well. Tip: always make sure you jam or jelly is at room temp. for easier spreading.

These are delicious! They are very sweet though. I made them according to the recipe the first time only changing white flour for brown. The second time I made them with half the brown sugar substituted for coconut and with pureed apples and blueberry jam instead of raspberry. It made it much less sugary and just as tasty. I read lots of the other reviews that had trouble with the bars being crumbly, I think it is definately much easier to work through the butter evenly if it is melted. And dont be shy to compact the base in really hard and maybe leave it in the oven that little bit longer. Overall though it's already a favourite at my house.

I make this extra healthy by using whole wheat flour, all fruit instead of jam, and cut the butter by 1/4 cup and add 1/2 cup almond butter.  It is very yummy but the top layer ends up being very crumbly because of the almond butter.  Good, easy recipe!

These were awesome. I made them with two small jars of my mothers homemade raspberry jelly. OMG!They were out of this world. Very filling and kind of heavy, so they went alot farther than you think they will. You only need a small piece at a time. I also added an egg and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. Make sure you press firmly on both the bottom and the topping to keep it together. Ignore the 2cup ratio suggested. Just put half on the top and half the mix on the bottom, and press firmly. If when you mush it together in your hand it just crumbles and won't stick together then you need to add a bit of milk or another egg. Unless of course you like jellied granola. I also added  a couple handfulls of vanilla chips on top of the jelly layer before adding the topping. Use sparingly, but be very generous with the jelly. Your want to be really able to taste it.  Chocolate chips would also be wonderful. Don't be afraid to mix it up. Cranberry sauce, fruit compotes, all flavors of jelly or jams, and don't forget chopped pecans or almonds. This is a basic recipe that can have so many different things done to it and all can come out delish.

I found this recipe while looking for one with which to use my leftover canned cranberry sauce. I tried this using a whole-berry cranberry sauce and added slivered almonds to the bottom crumble layer for an added crunch and some added fiber and good, monounsaturated fat. This is doubtless a great, delicious base recipe for any jelly or jam you have on hand!

I make these frequently.  You can use any kind of fruit preserves or jam.  You can also melt the butter/margarine and stir it in with a fork - it's a little easier than rubbing or cutting it in and comes out just the same.  I bake the crust for about 7 minutes, spread on the preserves, and sprinkle on the rest of the crumb mixture, then bake for about 25 minutes more.  My kids love these and they got rave reviews the last time I served them at a neighborhood meeting in my home.

Excellent, easy, and attractive. As a previous post recommended, I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 inch cake pan and added one egg and subtracted 1/4 cup of butter (it worked out because I actually had one egg and not enough butter). I used apricot all fruit on one side and a mixture of blackberry and raspberry on the other side (I had smidgens in several already opened jars). I allowed it to cool in the pan and then on the counter before cutting. Minimal crumbling, great taste! I topped it off with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and used as a gift. I can't wait to play around more with this versatile recipe.

Really yummy cookie bars.  I used a raspberry jam with seeds, didn't measure the jar, but I used about 8oz.  Makes a small batch, these will be gone in a matter of hours I predict.

These were good! I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 inch pan. It was gone in 3 days! I ususally gravitate towards chocolate so my husband was delighted I made a "healthy" dessert.

Pretty Good. I did follow some other suggestions.  I added an egg and cinnamon to the flour mixture.  I also topped the bars with a simple powdered sugar/butter/milk frosting.  They turned out very well.  Family liked them.  I liked the versaility of being able to use whatever jam I have on hand for this simple recipe.

I found these to be pretty plain.  We had these and some other treats out for my kids lemonade stand.  We only sold 2, but sold out of the other things.  Wont be making again.

These were the raspberry bars I have been looking for!  I’m forbidden from making them again because we have a hard time not consuming the entire pan-full the day I make them.  Only addition was a teaspoon of cinnamon because I put cinnamon in everything.  They were chewy and tasty.

This was my second time making these - and both times I received great reviews from friends.  I recommend increasing the jelly to one cup and making these quite a few hours before you need to serve (preferably overnight).  They are less crumbly and easier to eat after a day.

These bars were delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan so all my work would last for a while.  I used blueberry jam that I had on hand and it was delicious! I also spinkled some frozen blueberries on top of the jam and I thought the addition worked great.  The first day it was crumbly but the second it was not and my husband liked it even more.  If I do blueberry next time I might add some lemon zest on the jam to give it a tasty kick.

Really great results for very very minimal effort. I thought this would be an "ok" dessert to hold the kids and husband over but they positively devoured it! Husband had his still warm from the pan over vanilla ice cream. Delish. They were great for breakfast bars too.

We had a bunch of near empty jam containers, so we used cherry, grape and raspberry. 

We'll be making a double recipe next time!

These are SOO good.  I substituted vegetable oil for 1/2 the butter (because I was almost out of butter) and was pleased with the results.  I used a slightly tart blackberry jam and was thrilled with the flavor.

Well, i didnt do raspberry b/c we dont like it, but i mixed apricot and peach jam and it was very good.  A sweet/tart thing goin on. YUM!  I also used real rolled oats, not the quick cooking kind, and that was pretty good, but i can see why you need the thin quick cooking kind.  Also i was leary of the entire 3/4 cup of jam thinking it would be too much goo and the bars would be heck to cut, but it definately needs the 3/4 cup or maybe even a cup of jam, otherwise you feel like your eating just oats and flour.  You need the gooey jam center for sure!  And the nutty flavor that the oats and butter give you after being baked, its so good!!!  Oh- and this recipe is soooooo EASY!!!!

Easy and good!  My mom used to make these all the time when we were little.  Now I know why!  They take no time at all, and it's easy to adjust the recipe to make them healthier.  I use whole wheat flour, add more oats and less butter, a bit of applesauce and cut down on sugar by a few tablespoons.  They are great if you follow the recipe exactly too!

I made this by doubling the recipe and baking in a 9 X 13 pan with the foil lining. I kneaded the mix by hand with the butter as others suggested, and I LOVED IT!! I made it for the bake sale we have each week to benefit the students in my Special Ed class. It was a hit and the first thing that sold out! One customer said that it was her new favorite. Others are eager to try it with various flavored jams. One is requesting it with a sugar-free jam. It was a hit! MY hubby (who states he is not into sweets much), gobbled them up this weekend when I made it again at home. He told me that I better hide the next batch that is headed for school or it will never make it to the bake sale. This is the best review I can give for any of the recipes I have tried on here.

I would just like to say that these raspberry oatmeal bars were, as the name says, DELICIOUS!!!! I followed the recipe to the T, but i ended up doubling it and throwing it into a 13X9 pyrex dish.  Also, i added more jelly (actually, i used seeded preserves, which worked out just splendidly) then what was called for.  Also, for the little extra touch, i sprinkled some cinnamon ontop of it with about 15 minutes left of baking.... will definatley be making this multiple more times in the future :)

I've made them before with a mixture of raspberry and strawberrry jam (when i don't have enough raspberry) and they're just as delicious.

I tried this recipe twice. They turned out greasy and flat both times. The flavour was good but it was more like the top of a crumble or crisp than a cookie bar?

LOVE UMM!!I used a glass 9x13 casserole dish and never greased or lined the dish and had absolutely no problem getting the bars out. I also tried crushed pineapple as the filler and added 1tsp. of cinnamon to the oatmeal. I wasn't as impressed with it as others were, some people liked the pineapple better then the raspberry.

These are perfect ... and very easy to put together. I use a good quality raspberry spread (with no sugar added) and everyone loves them. I've made it several time and will keep it as a favorite.

Maybe I overcooked these, but I thought the cookie layers were pretty dry.  Check out Cranberry Bars for an alternative.

Yummy! This turned out perfect. Very moist and chewy, I thought the jelly made it a little to sweet for my taste, next time I think I'll use sugar free (I know). Great fresh out of the oven with a dollop of ice cream =) Anyway--I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and sprayed the baking dish with nonstick spray and it came out perfectly. Wait for it to cool completely before cutting into squares, unless your going to serve it warm with ice cream (c: Next time I try this I am going to try substituting the flour for whole wheat, and use a sugar substitute for a healthier alternative. Thanks Holly, for the sharing this yummy recipe.

These are GREAT! ^^ I've used different types of jam and they all work wonderfully. I suggest putting the uncutted bars in the fridge to cool before cutting them. It makes for easier cutting and less messy. My bars didn't take take 35 min to bake. only about 25-30. so...watch them while it bakes.

Fantastic! I have made these many times since discovering this awesome recipe. The only recommendation I have is to use Smuckers fruit only seedless black raspberry which I have found to have the absolute best flavor. I also use 'real' butter, never margarine. Mixing the dough with hands seems to work best. The problem we have with this recipe is certainly not the 'crumbs' but the fact that we can't stop eating them!

This recipe is so simple and fast but tastes so so good. I used strawberry jam instead of the raspberry and everyone at my work loved it. I made it again the next day and had to double the recipe. Thank you for submitting this.

THESE WERE AWESOME!!! I USUALLY DON'T LIKE THIS KIND OF STUFF, AND I WAS MAKING IT FOR MY SON'S LUNCH BOX, INSTEAD OF A MORE EXPENSIVE GRANOLA BAR, ETC. AND TURNED OUT THAT I LOVED THEM! MY KIDS WEREN'T SO INTO THEM FOR SOME STRANGE REASON, BUT I WILL DEFINITELY BE MAKING THIS A LOT, DUE TO THE SIMPLICITY OF INGREDIENTS, YET SO ABOUNDING FLAVOR! I DID ADD 1/4 TSP OF CINNAMON, AND DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND BAKED SAME AMT OF TIME IN A 9X11 PAN.

I had to make a cookie for a last minute get together and decided on these.  They were fast and easy to make, but best of all, they were good. The next time, when not in a hurry, I will drizzle with white chocolate.

Perfect recipe. I made them with homemade blueberry jam. Family said they're "keepers". Next time will try a pinch of cinnamon, just for fun. I doubled this one so I'd have more waiting in the freezer. Yum.

Excellent base recipe.  Given modifications, it is a five star recipe.  I added spices to the base (can't really call it a cookie bar without eggs!).  I then used my own homemade jam.  I used the whole jar, which is closer to 1 cup than 3/4c.  I also only baked them for 32 minutes.  These two modifications made a big difference between a dry crumbly bar and a moist perfectly baked bar.  I've used apple-honey jam and raspberry-blueberry jam, both with amazing taste results.  I think they're better the next day, the top was crunchy but the bottom was perfect and they don't crumble.  I can't wait to try it using the apple butter I made last fall!

I used half whole-wheat flour and half white flour and light butter instead of regular butter.  It had a nice crunchy topping.  Next time I might try adding some cinnamon as mentioned by other reviewers.  I might also add some chocolate chips to the topping.  What's better than chocolate and raspberry!

Yum, yum, yum!  I made these for an end-of-school picnic for my son's preschool class along with some cookies & brownies.....I thought it would be good to have something a bit more "grown-up" tasting and these fit the bill.  Delicious and very easy.  I doubled it and made it in a 9 X 13 pan with no problems whatsoever.

I have been searching for a recipe like this for literally years.  These bars are absolutely delicious!!!  My only problem is that I could probably sit down and eat the entire pan myself.  I used regular (homemade) raspberry jam instead of seedless and everyone just loved it.

I made these with some apricot jam a friend of my wife had given us a few weeks ago and would have given some to said friend but I didn't double the recipe and honestly, they were just too effin' good to share! They're the perfect combination of dry and moist like every good snack should be. I'll definately be making these again with various other flavors and won't make the same mistake of a single batch.

I have made these three times now and the flavour/type of jam makes such a difference. The smuckers raspberry was the winner (PC's mixed berry and strawberry rhubarb were also good though). I had more luck lining my pan with parchment paper rather than tinfoil, as the tinfoil split and stuck to the bars when cutting. Great recipe and so simple!

This is a superb and simple recipe. The results are beautiful, and make them look professionally done. I gave it 4 stars because I had to adjust the sugar measurement, which I think is uncessarily high and interferes with the flavor balance.

 I've made this recipe 3 times already and I'm now on my 4th time. This time I slow cooked some apples on the stove with cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted ginger, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. I let that simmer in a non-stick pot uncovered while I made the base. I altered the base considerably having no rolled oats, but I'm sure it will be nice, and will update on how it came out later.
The only major change I made was the sugar content. I think a 1/2 cup is way too much- and it's unclear whether the 1/2 cup is packed. I decreased it to just under a 1/3, packed, and added 2 tblsps of cane sugar to that. It was perfect. Less like a dessert, and more like a snack. If you don't like super sweet, I'd recommend adjusting the sugar. Remember: the jam has sugar in it, too.
I also tried two types of seedless red raspberry jam.  Santa Cruz was my favorite.
Additionally, unless this has to do with the type of jam you use, I did not worry too much about spreading the jam to the edge of the pan. I was super careful the first time, but the jam hardly moved from where it was placed. I wonder if that has to do with the the water content in the raspberry product used.
Hopefully, I can update this later to describe how the fresh apple version came out!

Few ingredients, little prep time, and blow your socks off results! If you're having a bad day, gather your hair in a bun, whip these babies up, and put your feet up as your whole living room starts to smell like a bath & bodyworks candle

Alterations I made:

1.added cinnamon and vanilla essence to the flour/butter/sugar mixture. brings the crumble to a whole new level

2.used instant oat meal instead of old fashioned oats. worked fine, and i have a sneaky suspicion that the bar held up well (and did not crumble to pieces) because the smaller bits of at helps to gel the ingredients well

3.dotted the raspberry jam with...... you guessed it - actual raspberries! I used frozen raspberries which were thawed and dried. bits of the fruit peek out under the oat streusel gorgeously

What I'll try the next time round:

1.adding white chocolate chips with the raspberry. need i say more?

WOW! Great with homemade jams, but also GREAT with freshly picked raspberries or peaches tossed in honey or sugar instead of jam. A favourite with my kids, who can now make this on their own with great pride.

Oh, these are so yummy!  My sweet hubby found a little jar of grape jelly at the dollar store, knowing how much I love little jars for flowers and things, he bought it.  I didn't know when I was going to get around to using it so came across this recipe and although it didn't ask for grape jelly, I figured it would work just as well and it definitely does!  So good with a cup of coffee, my husband is going to inhale these for sure:)

A *huge* success!  So easy to make, yet they look so impressive and taste like something from a bakery.   They stay soft, smell fantastic, and everybody who tried them raved about them.  Far and away the most popular dish I served at a recent breakfast gathering.  (I doubled the recipe and it just wasn't enough for a 10x15 inch pan.  When I went to quickly make a third batch for the top, I was out of brown sugar, so I subbed white sugar and it was still great.)

These bars are very good. I used raspberry strawberry jam and it did have seeds but that was not an issue at all. Also, I added a few dashes of cinnamon to the crumb mixture. So good, and I will definitely make again!

These were extremely simple to make and incredibly delicious, but they were so crumbly that they were difficult to eat, even with a fork. There's no way they could be a bar you could pick up with your hand to eat them. I was a little disappointed in that, but, as I said, they ARE yummy.

I added enough sweetened coconut to cover the jam and it was great, although next time I'll add even more.

Delicious and easy to make!  I didnt bother with lining the dish with foil just sprayed my dish with cooking spray and they did not stick at all. I plan on making these again and trying out some different flavors of jam.

The way these came out, I give them a 5, but I did make some changes. First, I used puréed raspberries instead of raspberry jam. The sweetness level was just on the edge of being too sweet, and I think that if I'd used anything with added sugar, it would've been way too much. I also added a big shake of cinnamon and some vanilla extract.  I also reduced the cooking time pretty significantly - I took them out at about 30 minutes, and the texture was perfect. A number of people who gave this low reviews talked about the bottom being too dense, and I would bet that shortening the cooking time would resolve the issue.  There's nothing in there that has to be cooked through (like eggs), so just err on the side of undercooking.

Love it.  So simple and easy to make.  I did make a few adjustments due to my own personal preferences, but overall it was perfect.  I always have to double the recipe, my family devours this in seconds.

I half the amount of sugar in the, and also added fresh fruit with the jam.  It's delicious!

Delicious!!

These were pretty good!  It reminds me of a recipe I tried many years ago.  I didn't have raspberry jam, so I used apricot preserves.  I added a little cinnamon to the flour/oat mixture.  My husband really enjoyed this, and asked me to make it with peach.  I'd like a little more . . . complexity? . . . to the crusty part.  It was very easy, but next time I think I'll add a bit more cinnamon, and maybe some nutmeg.  I will make this again with some experimentation.

These are amazing. I brought them in to work and everyone asked for the recipe!

One thing to remember! Room temperature is the way to go for these treats. Bars right out of the fridge or right out of the oven do not do them justice. Just gotta wait for them to cool/warm up :)

Super yummy, followed directions exactly, except I only had apricot jam on hand. I am so excited to make these myself, I have paid $2 a square at my coffee shop for these.  Easy to make with my two preschoolers- they tried to eat the crumble before we even baked them. Next time I will try the healthier suggestions and double the recipe so I can gobble some up without guilt. Thank you!!!

Tastes and looks really good. I only made a couple changes because I realised I had no jam. So I had frozen raspberries, unthawed  them and mashed it up. After I used one egg to help keep it together. Worked perfectly! Next time I will try the jam.

This is one of the easiest desserts I've made. Very simple to make but it tastes great. My kids asked for seconds. I followed the recipe other than adding 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as others recommended. I also lined the baking dish with parchment paper instead of greasing it.

I made this recipe for school morning snack and followed the measurements given by the 4taals for a jelly roll pan. Then I made another 9 X 13 pan for the staff.  When I got home I followed the original recipe and used a 9 X 9 pan so that I could have it warm with vanilla frozen yogurt.  The most versatile recipe I have ever used.  The possibilites seem to be endless.  Thanks for a great recipe from 70 new fans.

Really quick and easy!!! I used seeded raspberry jelly (that I use for our pbj sandwiches) and it tasted amazing!!! I also didn't have light brown sugar, so I used dark brown with a little bit of white sugar sprinkled in... So good.

Super yummy and easy to make! It was a little on the sweet side for me so next time I might just make the raspberry part thinner. Oh and I used jam with seeds and it was just as yummy :)

I love this recipe!!  I have cultivated raspberry bushes, and had a lot at once.  I wanted to make something different, other than pie.  I found this recipe, and instead of the raspberry jam, I made my own raspberry sauce to use.  Very easy to prep, and they are a HUGE hit!!!  Definitely need to double the recipe because they don't last!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I was easy to make and more importantly, delicious. I used runny jelly that I had made with bad pectin and it turned out great. They sell a boxed premixed version at grocery stores, and this recipe is pretty much a clone of that only better because its home made. MAKE THIS,YOU WILL LOVE IT!

These are beyond amazing!! I make these all the time, I've tried raspberry and grape but raspberry was definitely better. NOTE: the recipe says 3/4 a cup of jam but I found that was nothing. I put almost a whole big jar of raspberry jam in!

Very easy to make, and tastes amazing every time! Made this for coworkers and cookouts several times, and I always get asked for the recipe. 

This recipe is very easy to adjust into a gluten-free recipe if substitute the regular flour with rice flour (or other gluten-free flour).

These bars are easy and VERY good!  I line my pan with foil backed baking paper and after they cool, pull the whole thing out place on a flat surface and cut them neatly then either return to pan or place in a plastic container for storage. (although they NEVER last long!)  I use black raspberry jam since that is my personal favorite and everyone loves them!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I was at the end of a tight pay period and needed something I could whip up with what I had on hand. So I substituted 1/4 c coconut oil + 1/4 c of peanut oil for the butter (because I am out). And used 1/3 c sugar (running low). Used strawberry preserves instead of raspberry. I didn't have quick oats, so I substituted steel cut oats. I toasted them in a pan over medium high heat for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Because of the reduced sugar I increased the flour about 1/4 cup. It all turned out fabulous- nutty and and chewy. I'm sure if you had all the correct ingredients they would be even better!

I have made this recipe several times now and every single time they are finished by my family within the day I make them.  I add white chocolate chips on top of the raspberry jam.  Wonderful!!!!

These tasted great, however, I'm having trouble with my topping. I've made these twice and both times the topping is really crumbly and dry.  Can anyone give me some tips on how to make it moist and buttery instead of dry and crumbly.

I discovered these delicious and simple to make bars while searching for something to do with raspberries.  These are just the perfect amount of sweetness and nice flavor combination with the tartness of the berries.  I received many compliments after serving these at a recent luncheon.

We love it.. I make it with blackberries, sour cherries, blueberries ..and of course the raspberries.. I like to also take some fresh fruit and cook it for a few minutes then mix in some of the jam to get the same amount. it works out great and has an even better taste.

The recipe was good, and the bars were okay but nothing special. ill use a different jam next time since the raspberry tastes weird after a while. I liked the crust though, needs a lil more on top. thanks!

I love these, as they are a great way to use jam that has been stashed away in the pantry. I replaced the flour with almond flour. Delicious and a bit more healthy, and gluten free.

OMG! This is the best bar that I have made. A REAL KEEPER. The only change I made was adding 1 tsp. Vietnamese Cinnamon. I have also tried Boysenberry Preserves OMG what a treat. Will try next time with E.D. Smiths(R) Black Cherry Raspberry and Blood Orange Spread from Costco. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe for a quick and tasty bar cookie. I have used raspberry, blackberry and apricot jam and they are all wonderful. I tend to get a little heavy handed with the jam. Always DELISH!

I got this recipe out of a magazine 3 or 4 decades ago.  It was called raspberry bars. I have scaled it up to make a 9 x 13 pan of them, which is still often not enough. ;-)  I've used all kinds of jam in the filling, depending on what I have on hand.  Blueberry is exceptionally good. I've also used cooked rhubarb, which is a nice contrast of sweet and tang. Very yummy overall.

Easy, delicious, impressive.  These were super simple to get into the oven, they taste amazing, and they look like they involve way more work than they do.  Definitely a keeper. I used organic seedless raspberry jam from Whole Foods - the jam is the star, make sure you pick a good one :)

I was actually surprised at how good these were.  I wasn't expecting much.  I used raspberry and blackberry preserves and added sugar and cinnamon to the topping.  They aren't the best but they are better than I expected and it was easy enough.  I could make them again.

Delicious!  You can also make them in mini-muffin tins.  I lined the muffin tin with baking cups, sprayed with non-stick cooking spray, and pressed about a tbsp of crumb mixture into the bottom.  Top with a bit of jam and about a tsp of crumb mixture.  

I did this because I tripled the recipe and made them in a huge pan, but still had crumb mixture leftover.  I might try it this way for the entire recipe next time - easier to bring them to an event this way.

The secret to a really great bar lies in the jam. Use the most
flavorful raspberry jam you can find.(not the most expensive)A
strong raspberry smell when you open the jar usually means
there's lots of flavor in the bar. The oatmeal can overwhelm
a so so jam so it's just a sweet blob. Add some blackcurrant
jam if you can't get a good raspberry jam. I tried a little
lemon juice and it didn't work, just a tart blob! I use the modified
amounts of oats and flour mentioned in other reviews and it
works well. The flour used is gluten free. My family loves these
bars.

These were a huge hit!  I doubled the recipe to make in a large pan.  Instead of jam, I used two jars of Smuckers triple berry topping.  These were DELICOUS and have been requested to stay on the menu!

These are ok cookies...I did everything the recipe said and followed others' advice about mixing softened butter with your hands, but it was a very crumbly cookie.  I was expecting it to hold together better.  And as for taste, it was good, but I've had cookies with a similar concept that tasted much better.   I mean, they're not bad, but I was expecting them to be great.

I cannot stop making these! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them! The favorites so far is raspberry and black currant. Strawberry was to sweet but it may have been the jam. Cherry with lightly toasted sliced almonds was good too. 

Hubby is not a fan of sweet things so I cut the brown sugar in half as well as the butter. I add one   lightly whisked egg with some vanilla to the dry ingredients. It takes a bit of working with my fingers to blend it together but it's worth the effort. This way isn't as crumbly as all butter  

I also use half white, half whole wheat flour plus 2T of wheat germ. I feel like it's a bit healthier but just as tasty. 

Did I say we LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them?  Mmmmm.

Very good.  I used blueberry jam since that's what I had in our pantry and they were a big hit at an afternoon party.  I expect any berry jam would work great.

Love this recipe! First time I made it with 100% raspberry jam and it was ok. The second time I used fresh raspberries with a dash of almond extract and it was to die for! I also used splenda brown sugar (1/4C), whole wheat pastry flour, and light butter and it was amazingly delicious!

very good taste and extremely easy recipe.  however, it is too unhealthy and very sweet...too much for me.  also, it just didnt wow me, which is another reason for the 4 stars and not 5.

Add an egg and use a whole 12.5 ounce jar of jam and you got yourself 5 stars! 
I added an egg for the crust after I separated the amount needed for the topping. 3/4 cup of jam does not go very far so I used a whole jar and added about 1/4 cup flour for stability. But if you don't mind a slightly more crumbly crust and a hint of raspberry then it's great and don't change a thing!

Made this for my coworkers and they all loved it. I think I baked them too long, they only needed about 30 mins. I used whole wheat flour and a little less jam than called for. Next time I will use the full amount of jam.

Yummy! Yummy! This was so easy to make and it was delicious. I forgot to grease the pan and put the foil in but I still had no problem getting it out of the pan (I think because it was a brand new pan or the type of pan I got). I doubled the recipe and used an 8x12 pan and the cookies were so good. Kids begged for more. :)

My 9 and 6 yr old daughters had fun helping me make these delicious treats.  We used a 9"x13" pan and sprinkled the extra crumb mixture over ramekins filled with chopped apples, a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon and baked them along with the bars for 35 mins.  Both were a big hit.

Reduced sugar by half, it was sweet enough with the jam. Used white sugar because it was all I had, also didn't use the baking soda because I was out. Used about 1/4 less butter which I also melted, super easy and tastes great! Thanks.

Delicious, I used whole-wheat flour and added another 2 TBS butter as I think the whole wheat makes it drier and they came out great and no one guessed they had been tampered with. Used Oregon Marionberry jam, very good.

Excellent recipe, a great and quick low-ingredient alternative to cookies when you want something fresh and fast.  I've started adding dried cranberries or raisins to the bottom layer for some extra tang and chew, in particular when I don't have a "red" jam (raspberry, black currant...), as other jams (yellow plum, elderberry, pear...) i have tried have less flavour when they come out of the oven.  Also roasted chopped nuts are yummy if there are no allergies in the eating crowd.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Have made these a couple of times now, they're a total hit. Doubled the most recent batch for work, they were a hit. I did not worry with greased foil, spray was sufficient. Agree that one key factor is working the oatmeal mixture thoroughly and pressing in to pan well. Mine hold together very well.

Oh my goodness--these are heavenly!! I made them exactly as directed, no subs or mods, and they were perfectly done at 35 minutes. The butter is very important for the flavor and texture, so be sure to use it if you don't have any dietary restrictions. I can't believe how simple these are to prepare! My daughter said she went into "another dimension" when she tasted one--lol. These will definitely be part of my holiday baking, not to mention regular baking.

This was very yummy. I make my own jam & had a few jars I wanted finished. I used a combination of raspberry, cherry & strawberry. I doubled the recipy. It turned out great. Think I may add some chopped nuts next time.

Takes a while to cool, reaaaaally sweet cuz its so hard to spread the jam around, it kind of all globs in the middle, and when you try to spread it around it takes up the crust. It was alright...

So easy and so good! I added a few mini chocolate chips in with the jam and they are delightful. Maybe a little too easy to make though, these could be dangerous.

The bars really didn't hold up too well...but they tasted FREAKIN AWESOME!! I added, per the suggestion of some other folks, 1 tsp or Almond Extract, 1 tsp cinnamin and in the toppng part I put slivered almonds and shredded coconut.  Crumbly or not they were great!!

The crumb mixture is wonderful.  I even added coconut and Sliced Almonds as one poster suggested.  
But there is not at all enough Jam.  I opened a jar of jam and am putting it on the top of each bar as we eat them.
I would at least double the jam if you want to taste it at all.

Delicious, indeed! I didn't have jam on hand but did have a bag of frozen raspberries. I cooked them with cornstarch to thicken and they were a fine replacement for the jam and no added sugar! I don't have a problem with the seeds. The bars were very crumbly on top so I will try adding an egg next time as someone else suggested. Now, not to eat them all in one sitting!

These were very good. I did add some cinnamon for a little something extra but they would be delicious either way. I think next time I make these I'll try a different jam to see how that works.

These bars are okay but they are missing something.  I think these would be really good if eaten warm with ice cream.  I used a little more than 3/4 cup of strawberry preserves instead of raspberry preserves.  I also creamed the butter and sugar together first, added the salt, flour and oats.  I didn't line the bottom of the pan with foil.  I simply greased the glass pan and it came out just fine.

Made these last week and believe me when I say this is the easiest and quickest baked dessert ever.  I can't wait to try other jams and jellies.  Its just the 2 of us and having to make a whole 13 x 9 pan is just too much for 2 this was perfect!
Thank you for a quick and easy recipe.

Followed recipe exactly and these turned out ok - will make some adjustments and try again as they were far too sweet for us and also a bit crumbly.

I thought this was a  nice recipe but nothing outstanding however my husband loved them.   They were gone quickly and already my husband has asked for more. I used a food processor for ease in preparation, adding the oatmeal at the last minute.

I followed the ingredients and instructions to a tee, and it came out hard as a rock.  The only thing I can think of that would have affected the bars is that I live in a high altittude (4500+).  The taste was fantastic, but hard to chew in our case

I will definitely be making these again!  The only problem I ran into was that the bottom was a bit soggy.  I think next time I will double the oatmeal mixture, use more on the bottom, and bake the bottom layer alone for a few minutes before adding the preserves and topping and baking again.  But I definitely enjoyed this recipe - it was hard to stay away from the dish!

I've made these 3 times in 1 week.  Each time doing something a little diff.  I make a 9 x 13 and use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup reg flour. I use sugar free, seedless Polaner Rasp Jam and it's great.  My husband needs a little sweetness though so I mix a little confectionary sugar and milk and drizzle it on.  It's soooo yummy!

doubled recipe - In place of 2 sticks of butter I used: 1 stick of butter and 1/4 cup of appleasauce and 1 egg. (as another reviewer suggested). Used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and "All Fruit - Polaners" raspberry (which doesn't have sugar) Was DELICIOUS.  I love JUNK food and even with my healthier modifications, this still hit my sweet tooth spot. The mom's group I made them for loved them too! My 3 year old gobbled them up.  I ate 7 large squares in one morning.  eeek!  so good.  gonna go eat another one.

Had to give 5 Stars thought this recipe was easy and I doubled it!! I also added a little bit of Clear Almond Extract to the mixture probably a little bit less than 1/2 a tsp. Really gives a nice flavor!! Thanks so much for sharing!!!

OKay - made these last week with apple butter and a little vanilla. They were GREAT and super breakfasty.  This week, I made a double batch with apricot butter (basically natural apricot preserves, but not super sweet).  The kicker - I added hazelnut extract to the crumble part. Holy ! The hazelnut with the apricot is soooo good! Must - stay - away - from pan! These are so easy to prepare and something to enjoy with your afternoon coffee!

Yummy!!! Would have given it 5 stars but I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon. Would be excellent served with a scoop of ice-cream or topped with whipped cream. It is a pretty sweet and rich bar.  Exceeded my expectations. Thanks for the great recipe.

Taste was excellent but it was a little crumbly. Had to cut into really small pieces and it still fell apart. Maybe the butter needs to be incorporated better.

Lovely for Valentine's Day! Fiance and I really liked them. VERY similar to my favorite apple crisp recipe, but with more flour, so it turned out a little drier and crumblier than I would have liked. (I'm all about soft and chewy!) But I love raspberry, and jam is so much easier than slicing apples! I will make this again, but might reduce the flour to 1/2 cup. The only change I made this time was to add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (I might add more next time) and I melted the butter (I don't have the patience to blend in solid butter, even if it's very soft.) Next time I will warm the jam, too - it was a new jar that hadn't been in the fridge, so I didn't think it would be that hard to spread, but it was still a little globby. Great recipe!

Very good and easy.  I made a double recipe and it fit very nice in a 9 x 13 pan.  1 small jar of preserves was exacty enough for a double recipe.  Cut in to small pieces as they are very rich and sweet.  Will make again!!

Absolutely the best! I've made these with both raspberry and boysenberry, and each of them was a winner. One of the easiest and best tasting desserts. They won't last long, you better bake a double batch in a 13 X 9 pan!

I made a few modifications to make the recipe healthier.  I used 1/2 cup of brown rice syrup instead of brown sugar.  There was still a little brown rice syrup coating the bowl when it was all over and I used it to lightly glaze the top layer - this gave it a nice crunchy sweetened coating.  I used no more than 1/8 stick of butter + about a 1/2 tablespoon of coconut oil rather than a whole stick as called for. I used the coconut oil to coat the pan as well. I used pastry flour, frozen organic raspberries and added in a splash of vanilla extract.  Next time I am going to omit the butter completely and substitute in a little apple sauce, use whole wheat flour and some fresh lemon juice and lemon zest to make a lemony raspberry bar.  The bars come out of the oven with a light crunchy top - if you want to keep them that way, let them cool completely before sealing them in a container or they will steam themselves into a nutrigrain-y type soft bar.

Very tasty.  I wish they were a little crunchier though.  They hold together, but I feel like the jam makes the bar almost soggy.  Maybe if I pre-baked the crust layer?  Or perhaps used a filling that's more like a pie filling than preserves?  (I feel like the preserves almost give them a soggy-jelly-sandwich feel--in the best possible way, of course).  Even as written, a very tasty dessert.

I have made this recipe twice now, the first time I used margarine and although the consistancy of the mix was gooey they came out tasting much like a cereal bar which I enjoyed (no raspberry cereal bars in England). The second time I used butter. I put everything but the oats and the jam in my food processor and blended them till they just started to go dougy then I added the oats and pulsed till I got the crumb texture, it was so much faster and easier then doing by hand. I use jam with seeds because I prefer it. The second time around they were lovely but to be fair I enjoyed them both ways both times.

I've made these 3 times in the past week!!  They are fantastic made as written, but in my attempts to health-ize them I've substituted 1/2 c of the flour for whole wheat, added 1T ground flax seed, and used mashed up real berries and peaches sprinkled with tapioca instead of jam.  When I used real fruit they got a little gooier, but they were still fantastic!  This is a keeper.

These were soooo good! The only change that I made was that I used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour to make them a bit healthier.  You couldn't taste the difference!!! So easy, and so good.  I second the other reviewer that said you should make a double batch because these will vanish quickly!

These are very easy and very yummy. If you have fresh picked raspberries, just combine 3/4 cup mashed berries with 3/4 cup white sugar as the filling. I will definately make again. The recipe is so versitile that you could use any fruit or jam that you have on hand.

Meh. It was missing something. Flavour maybe. The crumble was too sweet- and gritty (the sugar). The bottom ends up tasting like Natures Valley Granola Bars, only more dry and powderlike.

Great recipe as it is. All I did was squeeze quarter lemon into the jam to increase its tartness. Be careful and follow the recipe: do NOT take the jam to the edges - you will regret it (i did!). It gets real sticky. If you have baking paper, use that to line instead because the jam doesn't pull away from the foil and i suspect it will behave itself with baking paper :) It does taste super-yum!

Scrumptuous!  I also didn't bother with the foil, just sprayed the pan.  Had a can of raspberries in heavy syrup, so drained and used that since I didn't have the jam.  It was melt in your mouth good but it was on the crumbly side for cutting and serving at a potluck.  Next go around, I might look back again on other reviewers suggestions for moistening it up a bit.  Simple, simple, simple and not too sweet, just right.  Next time I'll use the Smucker's Low Sugar Raspberry Jam.  We always preferred it to regular.  It even seemed fruitier.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe! My son and I made these and he wanted to use bumbleberry jam, so we did. Boy were they YUUUUMMMY. I added cinnamon and used apple sauce for part of the butter. My mix was too dry so I just added more apple sauce until I got the consistancey I wanted. Hubby said this is a keeper!

My family loves these and we have to make a double batch each time.  I have also used chopped up frozen fruit instead of jam and the bars still come out great and tasty.

These were so close to 5 stars but they were just a tad too buttery.  Everyone raved about them, though.  I can't wait to make them again!

SO EASY and pretty darn good!!!  Kinda tastes like a much better version of a Nutri-Grain Bar, which I don't actually care for, but these are good.  Mine came together just fine, and came out of the pan fine as well.  I did crank up the heat to 450 for the first half of baking since I was trying to make dinner at the same time, but it didn't affect it at all.  We were wishing we had vanilla ice cream, and if we had I may have rated it 5 stars... =)

I really liked these. I added almond extract to the jam mixture and that really made it. I did have to much topping on the top so the jam didnt bubble through, which I think is a pretty look. Will use less next time.

So simple and so tasty.  Since these will be made again and again, I am already thinking of ways to vary the recipe.  I think I will add chopped almonds to the oatmeal mixture and some almond extract to the preserves.  I also plan to try using fresh berries in a thick coulis with a bit less sweetness.  There are tons of possibilities, thanks.

pros: simple to make with a short ingredient list cons: tastes boring and i feel like it's missing something. if i ever make these again, i would add nuts, vanilla, white chocolate chips, and maybe cinnamon to spice this dessert up.  one thing to note is that is does taste a bit better after sitting in the fridge for  few hours.

These were excellent, and a snap to put together. I made a double batch, as the only seedless raspberry preserves that I could find, were in a 10oz jar...too much for a single recipe, and not enough for 2 separate batches...so I just made a double batch. Next time, I'm going to increase the butter in the mix. I rarely eat anything sweet, so I feel that I can afford to do that on the few occasions that I will make these. Taste was excellent!

I had to use up some plum pie filling (homemade) and I did not want to make another cobbler. It turned out great, except a little soft (filling moisture, not the recipe), I froze half for another treat later! We'll see how it fares...

Quick and easy.  I didn't realize I didn't have any raspberry jam, all I had was strawberry preserves, so I used that instead.  I was actually glad, it turned out sweet, where the raspberry would have been some what tart.  Will be making again.

Flavor wise these were great. I used half grape jelly mixed with some blackberry jelly. The only reason these are getting 4 stars is because mine was slightly crumbly. But other than that, these were so easy to make. I will prob make these again, but play around to see if I cant get them to stick together better for me.

I made these because I had a sweet tooth but didn't want anything unhealthy. I used the suggestion of using the apple sauce to substitute some of the butter. My sister has a picky 2 year old and he LOVED it. I actually have made this recipe twice since the first time. Also I used preserves instead of jelly or jam because it has less sugar. This was so good that I will be making these for a family event coming up! Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious. I think they're more like a handheld crisp or cobbler than a cookie. I used a triple berry jam, and greased my foil with butter Crisco and I think it helped give it a rich buttery flavor. Next time I'll be sure to press the top layer in a little more firmly so it doesn't crumble and will probably use a little bit more jam. I think I'll give wheat flour a try and maybe use this as a healthyish alternative to brownies for the kids.

Nice cookie bar recipe!  As other have suggested, I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  Yum.  I also used seedless blackberry jam instead of raspberry.  The only way that these could be improved is if there was just a little more fruit filling.  (I don't know if this was because I used Polaner's fruit spread, which is sweetened with juice, not sugar.)  Next time, I think I will use a full cup.

Use REAL Butter/grease (not cooking spray) when greasing the 8x8 pan & foil. And reduce cooking time by 5-10 min. to avoid drying out. Awesome desert! Served over Vanilla Icecream! Big Hit!

Simple and very good. I was a little skeptical of the limited ingredients, but was pleasantly surprised by the results. I will make again. I used a mixture of different berry jams and preserves that needed to be used up.

Delicious and easy to make! I tried it with sugar substitute and it came out wonderfully. Might need a little more of the mix for your pan (I did to reach the edges of a small rectangular one).

OMG, so easy and always turn out great!!! Everyone asks for the recipe. The only thing I changed is that I add a sprinkling of white chocolate chips onto the jam. One of my favorite go to recipes in a hurry!

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!  These are really good!  I made them for a New Year's get together at my bro's house tonight; I secretly ate 1 bar already!  They are so yummy!  Perfect amount of every ingredient; don't change a thing!  I did add a little brown sugar and cinnamon/white sugar combo on the top, but it really doesn't need it...perfect without it!  Thanks, I'm sure my brother will love these (he's a big raspberry jam lover)!!

It actually turned out exactly like the picture and was very easy.  As other reviewers stated: - don't refrigerate jam prior to spreading  - let cool completely prior to cutting - I found it easier to use my fingers to mix the dry ingredients with the butter, rather than a pastry cutter. I used raspberry jam as the recipe called for - it had a pretty strong flavor which overpowered the more mild flavor of the oatmeal part, but overall very tasty!  I already bought a jar of blackberry jam to try and am thinking apricot preserves will also work well.  Great recipe!

Used blueberry jam instead, and didn't bother with the tin foil. This was a crowd pleaser. I also once doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 pan and turned out great.

A great snack type food that you can even take on the go. My family loves these and my extended family loves these. They don't look amazing but they taste very good! We use grape jelly. :) These are often messy so I  altered the proportions. I doubled this and put 3 1/2 cups of filling on the bottom with the rest on the top so you couldn't see the jelly (or touch it).

These bars are fantastic. I've made them about a dozen times. I always double it, and bake in a 13x9 pan, then I drizzle it with melted white chocolate chips after baking. It is one of the few cookie/bars I've found that do not taste good right out of the oven. They are best after cooling or even the next day. Super easy to make!

AMAZING!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, no changes and they came out perfect, my husband declared them "the best cookie bars I've ever had".  I was skeptic about the amount of the jam but it turned out perfect.  Simple ingredients, quick & easy to put together, wonderful for company.

Delicious! Made these with my 20 month old son and was a great time! very easy and a great 'kid-friendly' recipe, he was able to help with every step and i didn't have to worry about him ingesting raw eggs! We used cherry jam and a little leftover strawberry jam.  Also doubled the recipe (must do! they go fast and sit well so you'll enjoy having some 'leftovers', if they last that long!) and used Quick Oats.  Was great! Will DEFINITELY make again!! Very adaptable recipe!

It's hard not to eat the entire thing right after it comes out of the oven!! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon the second time around. And make sure not to let the jam touch the edge of the pan!

This is amazing.  I made exactly as is, maybe adding a bit of jam, I didn't really measure it...  so quick and easy, great for company, very versatile.  WOW.  I'm impressed.  Oh wait, I did also add a dash of cinnamon to the oat mix.  I made jam just before making this.  I didn't wait for my jam to fully set as I wanted this made right away, but it worked perfectly.   Super Yummy.

Easy and a family favorite.  You can mix right in your Kitchenaid or stand mixer rather than doing by hand.  Add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. You can use any kind of jam you want. Try with apricot preserves - my family's favorite!

These are fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly only I used seedless blackberry (b/c thats all I had), and they turned out perfect. Also, I like cinnamon, so added a TB to the crumb mixture. ~ Then I made them with canned apple pie filling (I finely chopped the apples) and they taste like apple crisp cookies! ~ This recipe is delicious, versatile and is a definite keeper. I have found the perfect oatmeal cookie bar. Thanks a bunch! :-)

These are dangerously yummy and buttery. They are very good still warm from the oven. I am normally a chocolate fan and tend to make brownies and cookies more often, but I keep coming back to this recipe when I want something different.

I loved that there was no eggs involved! And no Milk!  I'm lactose intolerant so I made the change of butter to applesauce and also I'm cutting back on wheat and used rice flour - the result was light but firm bars.  Thank you!

My roomate loved these! I loved them becuase they required such little ingrediants, which is valuable to a college dorm student.   Followed the recipe but used strawberry jam because that's all I had.  Delish!

These were just ok.  The oatmeal part came out too dry and not as chewy as I hoped.  I'll keep looking for a raspberry bar recipe.

This was good but I think it was missing something in taste. Next time I will add chopped pecans or walnuts to the crumble mixture on top.

I made these last night for the first time and they are delicious!  I followed the directions, only adding some lemon zest to the preserves.  I also used my food processor to combine the ingredients.  Pulsed about 12 times and it was done.  Baked for just over 30 minutes.  I have always loved these bars, don't know why I waited so long to make them.  Super easy and taste great!

These are fantastic! I've made them 3 or 4 times now, with different preserves, and I never have to bring any home; people always snatch them up! I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe.

These were so delicious and so easy to make with things right out of the pantry! I used apricat jam and also warmed it up a little so that it would be easier to spread.  Will definitely be making again!!

I remember making this recipes when I was young and loved it and praise be to God that I found it again. I used seedless blackberry jam because that is what I had on hand and turned out so good, my Sunday School class thought so too.

These were great. Very easy to make, I used my hands to mix it all up. I added chocolate chips to the top thinking I could spread them for a top chocolate layer but that didn't work well, next time I will add some chunks to the jam layer I think.

This was good.  Next time will decrease the cooking time, they were a little crispy after 30 minutes.  I'll also increase the cookie mixture by 1/3 to 1/2 because we would have liked more cookie to jam ratio.

Thanks for the advice regarding adding apple sauce & cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture. Just an FYI, I baked this in a stone pan and had no trouble with a burnt filling as well as no issues removing the bars from the pan.

These were so easy and I had everything available.  I did double the recipe as others suggested and used splenda brown sugar(only use half of what the recipe calls for).  It is a must that you MIX the butter(I used one small tub of I can't believe it's not butter) in with the dry ingredients and press down well in the pan to prevent crumbling.
These are delicious and will be made in my household many more times!

This was easy & very good. I used an all fruit spread instead of a sugary jam. I added cinn. and vanilla to the mix. I also added some honey to make it stick together better & pressed down hard with a metal spatula into the pan. No problems with crumbling. It definatley tastes like oats, so it does resemble a nutrigrain or granola bar.

very good. Im imagining you can use any flavor of jam. I used black raspberry. Delicious. Next time, I will use a little more butter and maybe add some water, as it was slightly crumbly.

These aren't as good as I thought they would be.  They are a bit crumbly, although I followed the reviews to help that.  They don't have a great taste and I would have liked them to be a bit softer.  May try making them again, but not what I thought they were going to be.

Super easy! So good.  I used homemade strawberry jam on one, and blackberry jam on the other.  I don't mind the seeds in the jam.  I'm trying not to eat all of them myself, the kids love them too.  Oh I also doubled the recipe to make two pans, and I used 1 cup of white unbleached flour and 1 cup of Whole wheat unbleached flour to make it more nutritious!

Good but not amazing though I tweaked it a bit to make it healthier.  Doubled up the recipe and used whole jar of rasp jam w/seeds (13 oz).  For the bottom crust I added 4 tbsp margarine, 1/2 c applesauce, and 1/4 c egg substitute.  Ended up being way too much liquid as the bottom was super sticky--I got it pressed into the bottom of the greased pan and baked for 7 min.  Don't use too much on the bottom as it comes out pretty thick!  I definitely didn't have enough for the topping so I made another topping batch but this time used all margarine so it more crumbly.  Next time I'm going to slowly add the applesauce/egg combo until desired consistency is reached.

By the way if you are not a huge sweets person a little jam goes a long way.  Microwave jar first and then spread.  Baked the whole thing for 25 min and it came out perfect!

These bars are FOOL PROOF! I melted the butter like some reviewers said and it worked well. I also added cinnamon to the dry mixture. Make sure to heat up the jam in the microwave before spreading or else its too hard! (i used raspberry jam with seeds and it tasted great you could tell). Family enjoyed it but i found it too sweet, could have been my jam though. Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome, the right kind of chewy, even after a few days! I needed a bunch so I doubled the recipe and greased a jelly roll pan. I used a full 18 oz jar of seeded raspberry preserves. I warmed the uncovered glass jar in the microwave as another reviewer suggested for easier spreading. For the dough, I did knead this with my hands in a big bowl and I did kept kneading it until there were absolutely no powdery crumbs. Then I divided it in half and firmly pressed the dough onto the greased jellyroll pan. After adding the preserves, I sprinkled the rest of the dough on top being careful to cover all the preserves and pressed that in. Don't be afraid to press, it may be a little messy, but the cookie bars come out perfect this way. Everyone loved these. I can't wait to try blueberry and/or some sugar free preserve varieties. It does not matter if you have seeds or not, you can't taste them anyway.

This was a great recipe.  I tried it once with the greasing the foil and once just spraying the pan with cooking oil.  They turned out better when you follow the recipe and use the greased foil.  I will make this again, maybe tonight!

Yummy salty sweetness combo that couldn't be left alone. We used strawberry preserves, but it had essentially the same effect.

It was pretty difficult for me to find rolled oats in my area; had to settle for oatmeal in the end, which will result in a more 'Nature Valley' kind of bar, only moister and softer. Using raspberry jam with seeds works just fine. I added an egg (in addition to all the butter) to keep the bars from crumbling after they baked.
Don't forget to grease well!
Pretty good bar, flavor was subdued, will add lemon zest to the jam next time.

I love these.  I also made them in the larger pan and used enought jam, probably about 10oz, to cover the first layer of crumb mixture (firmly pressed in bottom of foil lined pan).  Yum!  Easy!  Beautiful, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cut in diamonds.
Thank you for sharing!!

Oh these are good! My husband devoured them in less than 2 days, lol. Followed recipe exactly and next time will double it (so I may get more than one bar, lol)
I threw some flaked coconut on top about 10 minutes before they were done too. ( I love coconut on anything I can get it on!)
Next time, I will have to work the softened butter in a bit more. My bars didn't fall apart by any means, and came out of the pan alright...but they were a bit too fragile (crumbly) to pick up and eat without making a mess. My fault though..

Such a basic recipe and really surprisingly good. I think it could use a bit of spice - maybe some cinnamon. I used apricot fruit spread because I didn't have raspberry and it was really good. I also had no butter so used butter flavored crisco with 1 T. water and it still worked. Used King Arthur "white" whole wheat flour for added fiber! Will make again but might add nuts to the mix next time.

I wasn't "wowed" by this.  They were okay but nothing great.  Kind of reminded me of a Pop-Tart in flavor - very sweet.  Maybe using pureed fresh/frozen fruit instead of jam would cut down the sweetness?  I did use strawberry preserves instead of raspberry (it's what I had) but that should have worked just the same.

I used canned cranberry sauce instead of the the jam (needing to use up the contents of my pantry!) Very Good! No leftovers!  I served them warm with vanilla ice cream to top it off! 

I used whole wheat flour and used 1/4 cup honey instead of the sugar.

I have now prepared this recipe five times and they are wonderful.  However I have made them with raspberry, boysenberry, blackberry and lingonberry preserves(some with seeds and some not).  I also added 2 tsp of apple pie spice to the oatmeal mixture to add a bit of spice; it worked out great!  Yummy and a definite hit at brunch, potlucks and as breakfast bars too.  Thanks for the recipe, because it is fun to doctor it up.

I liked this recipe. But it was missing something. Maybe next time I'll play with the spices. 
I did bake the bottom layer for about 5 minutes before adding the jam. Worked well for me. 
I'll make it again but will need to tweak it to add a bit more flavor.

I am a personal chef for 4 college football players, and love making them different types of desserts. Made this one, added a handfull of chocolate chips to the raspberries, served it hot with vanilla ice cream with chocolate fudge swirls. A big hit....loved it...didnt have to worry about how the leftover bars held up....

This is a really delishous oatmeal bar.  I doubled the recipe. so I cut down on the butter (substituted 1/4 apple sauce) and added an egg. I also substituted whole wheat flour. It is a bit crumbly but nothing I can't deal with.

I used brown sugar (not golden) and ED Smith's triple fruit raspberry (with strawberries and blackberries).  Very easy to make; couldn't wait for it to cool, so I didn't!  It was great warm, not too sweet at all.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow when it has softened a bit.  I will definitely be making this one again!

YUM! I used ED Smith's Wild Blueberry Preserves from Costco. Big chunks of blueberries and my husband and his friends loved them. I cut them in squares, wrapped them in plastic wrap and sent them my husband to work with them. With the blueberries, they remind me of the organic blueberry bars from Starbucks... but even better!

Very nice bar.  Tastes like what a Nurtrigrain bar should taste like but doesn't!  I subbed whole wheat flour, used half apple sauce/half butter per another poster's suggestion and a bit less sugar.  I will try an egg in the crust next time too.

Great as a dessert or for breakfast.

I've made these 5 times so far and they are so good. My family loves them. I use whatever jam I have on hand, including sugar free jam which was just as good. It is easy to make too, takes less than 10 minutes to put together.

These are great! I lined the pan with renyolds wrap release so I didnt have to grease and they came out great. My husband asked me to make them with fresh blueberry preserves when the come in season. This recipe has potential for ALOT of great variations!

I made this recipe as is, made no changes.  It was excellent.  Very good, I will make it again, trying different flavor jams!

I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a great fan of putting jam in cookies, but these bars turned out great.  I used black raspberry seedless jam and it reminded me of a thick berry pie filling -- couldn't even tell it was jam.  And a perfect crust.  My family loved these and gobbled them right up.  Thanks -- I will definitely make these yummy bars again!

I've made this twice, once as is and once with Slenda Brown Sugar and SF Raspberry Jam.  I'd rate both versions a 4.  I found both a little on the dry side, but very tasty.

These are fantastic.  I made them the other night when I was craving something sweet but didn't have any eggs.  The crust/topping is wonderful as is, but I may try a little cinnamon next time just to see.  A lot of reviewers added more jam; I actually decreased it to 1/2 cup because I've always liked more crust than filling.  It was the perfect amount for me.

Terrific!  I added almond extract and cinnammon to the crumble mix.  Next time I'll try this with some of those more exotic jams in specialty shops.

absolutely the best oatmeal fruit bar ever. I used 1/4 c softened reduced fat margarine, 1/4 unsweetened applesauce and for the flour I used nutriblend by robinhood. I also used "twice the fruit" light blueberry spread for the jam DELCIOUS, I sprayed pan with non stick and used parchemnt paper allowed to cool completely and bars were easy to removed from pan. Thanks so much for sharing.

I followed this recipe to the T and they turned out exactly as I'd expected. Would think you could use any sort of jam as a filling.

Delicious is right! My son broke his leg & I took him over a batch of these to make him feel better. I used my food processor & pulsed the softened butter into the flour/sugar mixture & used strawberry jam in a squeeze bottle (made it very easy to spread the jam). These were a cinch to throw together & they tasted great. He ate half a batch in one sitting (sure am glad I don't have to pay his food bill anymore  ;o) ) & has already put in a request for more. Thanks for a tasty, easy recipe!

I LOVED these bars.  I made mine with cherry preserves and chocolate chips.  The crust wasnt crumbley for me but i followed another reviewers advice and really worked the softened butter into the dough.  I will make these over and over.

Those bars were excellent! Used low sugar strawberry jam, old fashioned oats, 6 tbsp of butter and 1/4 cup of applesauce to make it healthier. Will definitely make again.

These were pretty good. A little sweet for my taste. To the crust/crumb I added some ground almonds. I though the crust was great but with all the sugar plus the very sweet preserves the overall taste was SWEEEET. I still ate them though.***I found a way to cut the sweetness that is wonderful. put peanut butter on top. Taste like a pbj sandwich but better.

Yummy!! This recipe is so easy, I am excited to try it with other flavors of fruit preserves.  I added chopped walnuts to the oatmeal mixture and it was delicious.  Drizzling white chocolate on the top really topped them off!

I served these for the Superbowl. Got great reviews. Several people took "one for the road."  I drizzled chocolate over the top and they looked delicious.  I had to use margarine because I didn't have butter and it seemed to work well.   Will make these again!

My new favorite! VERY FAST & EASY! We made this as an activity with 2 little girls. It was very fun for them & not at all time consuming like other cooking projects. They loved combining the butter with the rest of the mix because it involved mixing with thier hands...great recipe to try with with kids!

It's below freezing outside, it must be time for some home-style baking!!!  What a fantastic cookie bar.  I just tried one warm out of the oven.  And I can't wait to try one tomorrow for breakfast with a piping hot cup of coffee!  Such a versatile cookie bar, good both morning and evening!  I used raspberry jelly with seeds and it was just fine.  Don't stress out over the flavor or style of jelly.  Go with what you have or your instinct....it will be delicious!!

I made these for a back to school night at my daughters high school. They were a hit. I did not have raspberry jelly on hand. I bought strawberry jelly by accident. Still wonderful! I have also used Guava paste and guava jelly-to give a little Carribean flavor! Better than the strawberry to me!!

Excellent! Sweet but not too, and crunchy and yummy! Fun & easy to make. I substituted fresh mulberries for the filling, doubled the recipe and had to used 1/2 cup Crisco and 1/2 cup sugar  because I was low on sugar. It still turned out great. Thank you!

bit thin and crispy and cookie-ish, which is a good thing. had to cut back on the baking time a 5 minutes as i began noticing some burning odor. 

edited to add: after sitting overnight, under plastic wrap (after cooling to room temp), the bars  humidified somewhat and were no longer cookie-like at all

I read all the past reviews to get the tips for this one, so I also upped the butter and let it soften before kneading in with my hands.  It was still a little crumbly, but it was fun to make with my son.  Wish I had had nicer jam on it, it was pretty bland but I buy the cheap jam.  :P

These were very tasty, but got a crumbly texture because I overbaked them by a few minutes (too many things going on at once...). Be sure to watch the timing - a few extra minutes will definitely take it from chewy and perfect to crumbly/messy (but still tasty). Will make again.

It definitly matters what kind of Raspberry Jam you use. I used Jam with no sugar and the Raspberry was bitter. So make sure the Jam is good. The oatmeal bar was very good and I would suggest to try with other Jams like strawberry.

These were very easy to make, easy to alter, and pleased everyone. I added cinnamon to the crust mixture and used apple butter for the filling. To make the dough less dry, I replaced some of the rolled oats with instant oatmeal. You could also grind the oats in the blender. Either of these changes will make the dough less crumbly. Mixing it with your hands also helps. My next variation of this recipe will be to use guava paste in place of the jam. I'll post my results here, unless someone beats me to it!

This was "ok" tastewise, but mine came out a bit dry and were definitely crumbly to eat.  Won't be making them again.

This recipe is great. The cookies stay moist for days after, and they are addictive. I used PAM non-stick flour spray for baking, and they did not stick at all. I agree with the other reviewers to let them cool completely, preferably in the refrigerator, before slicing. Easy recipe, sure to impress!!

I'm so glad I found this recipe. It's great because I always have all the ingredients in my kitchen (i used Smuckers 100% real fruit preserves). It's so easy to make too.  The best part about them is they arn't too sweet and have a very fresh flavor. I gave one to my Dad when I went to visit him and he said, "Mmmmmm, you're the best cook!" :D

Thanks so much for this great recipe.  Using other people's suggestions, I added cinnamon and vanilla extract to the oatmeal-crumb mixture (about 1 teaspoon of each).  It was super easy to make and very convenient because it requires few ingredients.  I will definitely make this again.

These cookies are fantastic!  I added only about 1/4 cup of butter, and used strawberry spreadable fruit, and they turned out wonderfully!  Thanks for the quick, easy, and tasty recipe!

Excellent recipe - I used sugar-subsititute jam, margarine instead of butter and only 1/2 the amt the recipe calls for, and no salt.  It was terrific.

Delicious and so easy! Kids (4yrs and 1 1/2yrs) loved them. I pulsed the butter into the dry ingredients using my food processor with good results. Don't process too much, though, or the oatmeal will get too fine. I used spreadable fruit instead of jam and it worked great and probably cut down on the sweetness. Be sure to press the top layer down before baking! I agree with another reveiwer - you don't have to grease the pan before putting in the foil but you definitely need to grease the foil!

I made this to take in to work for my co-workers, so I wanted something that would hold together well and be easy to eat.  I was a bit concerned by some of the previous reviewers who said that it was messy and fell apart, but then I noticed that one of them had actually used fresh raspberries instead of raspberry jam!  No wonder!  I had no such problem.  The bars sliced well once cooled and did not stick to the pan.  I didn't line the pan - just greased it well.  Everyone loved these at work!  My husband was upset that there were so few left over for him.

These are fast and absolutely wonderful.  I did not have raspberry jam so I used strawberry ice cream topping.  I made them at work for break and got rave reviews.  Even the boss said that this recipe was a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

I did double this to make it in a 9 by 13 pan.  The bottom came out great so did the middle, but the top was very crumbly and made a big mess.  Still, overall it was terrific and I plan to experiment with the top to see what will hold it together more.  Maybe more butter or brown sugar?  I will watch the reviews to see if anyone else has any suggestions on this.

excellent bars. i used jam with seeds and it made no difference. they tasted and looked storebought, but were quite crumbly. i would make them again. they were a hit at work. to make them healthier next time i might use whole wheat flour. i don't think you would even notice it.

These are FANASTIC! I am always searching for a great cookie recipe and I have definitely found it here.  I have to disagree with other reviewers that there was too much or too little jam....it was the perfect amount.  The only change I made was to add half a teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust and I spinkled some almonds on top (I thought that drizzling chocolate would make these too sweet).  These cookies are buttery and delicous and just YUMMY! Thank you Holly!!

I really enjoyed this recipe! The raspberry jam I used was very sweet, so I will try to find one with less sugar next time. I took these bars to a party with about 5 other cookies/bars, and these were the first to go! I think I'd like to try blueberry or strawberry sometime as well. Definately a keeper!!

Oh, I didn't think these were good at all.  My boyfriend, who says sweets are a food group, took one bite and put it down, and I couldn't bribe him to eat anymore.  My kids politely each ate one, but I pretty much have to throw the whole thing out.  It was dry and crumbly, the crust had no flavor, and the raspberry jam was overwhelming.  I'm sad that I wasted all those indredients, I made two batches for a fishing trip the next day, and we stopped for a bag of cookies on the way out of town.  Big bummer.

I liked these, though they were not quite sweet enough for my taste for a dessert. Would be great for a breakfast on the go! I drizzled a powdered sugar icing on top and now they're perfect. I also doubled the recipe and made in a 13x9 pan, and there was enough crumb mixture left over to make an extra pie plate full! I also substituted Lighter Bake (prune/apple puree) for half the butter, and it turned out just fine-- add about a tablespoon or two more puree than called for on the jar, to make sure the mixture is moist enough to pack into the pan.

I tried this recipe tonight and my family LOVED it.  I actually doubled the ingredients and used a 9x13 glass pan. When it cooled I drizzled cream cheese icing with almond extract (use less) instead of vanilla.  It's a great recipe.  Thanks a bunch!

These disappeared in 1 day.  I cut them in small squares and served them after a large dinner party.  It is the perfect sweet with coffee or tea after a large meal.  My husband loved these too!  I will be making these often.

It tasted alright, but it was hard to give to my kids in their lunch because the jam would ooze off and make a big mess.

This is a really nice recipe, it's quick and easy and and taste delicious. It would be easy to change the taste by using different flavors of jam, I used a low cal strawberry jam because thats all I had and it worked fine, I also used margarine instead of butter and that worked fine also. I'll be making this one often, I think I'll try it with apple butter and see how that works.

This is a great recipe, and so easy! I didn’t alter the recipe, although I did double it in order to fill a 9x13 pan- and I’m so glad I did because they have been a hit! The bars are great straight out of the oven, room temp, or chilled- and taste like the Brambleberry crisp flavor from Jeni’s ice cream- just without the ice cream. Def would recommend!

Wonderful. Easy and delicious. I used my food processor to combine the four mixture with butter. I was careful to only pulse it until a crumble just began to form.

Next time I’ll “gild the lily” and add some fresh berries on top of the jam. This recipe is going into my “make often” file. BTW, freezes well, too! A perfect little fruit square all around.

Pack more batter on the bottom for a firmer base, not much is needed for the crumble on top.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x12” glass baking dish. Baked for 35 mins. Came out great! Made this for a super bowl party and everybody loved it. Very little clean up and quick to make.

These are so good! The crust is my favorite part because it's buttery and a little crunchy, mmmm!! Melt in your mouth. So easy too. If you haven't tried these with cherry preserves yet give it a go!! It's amazing! Also turns out well with 1 cup of gluten free flour instead of regular and 1/4 tsp of xantham gum.

Hubby liked it!  Made a double batch for the hunting weekend that is starting this weekend.  I was a little short of the Raspberry jam, so I added a half cup of my homemade Mulberry/Raspberry jam.  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped almonds to the top layer.  Hubby loves some kind of nut in his cookies or bars.  I will make these again!

Yummy! My dear bakers, if the bars are still gooey when you take them out but brown on top they are fine. They will cool and harden. I used raspberry, lingonberry (good old IKEA!), huckleberry, strawberry, marionberry and blueberry jam. It's an awesome berry flavor!

Recipe turned out great! Crunchy, toasty, buttery, jammy! Will make these again and looking forward to trying different fruit jams for the filling.

I made it with peach preserves because that's what we had and it turned out delicious! I cannot wait to try other flavors. These are perfect snacks for my boys.

I love how simple this recipe is!! Everytime I have a sweet craving, I make these Oat Bars. My whole family loves them too. I've learned to put the jam in the microwave for a few seconds and add a touch of water to thin it out before you spread your jam layer.

This is by far an incredible snack. These bars are the bomb.  I know it's tempting, but you should not eat the entire pan. So long as you don't have too many of these delectable pastries, you'll love them forever.

Hello ladies, I made this recipe last night and I normally do not change anything but wanted something with cinnamon in it so I double the recipe and added a tablespoon of cinnamon and instead of Jam, one can of cherry pie filling it came out awesome, thank you so much for the recipe.

One of the best versions I have made of oatmeal jam bars, the crust stays together without crumbling too much, very tasty.  Used up some of my homemade jam, they were a hit!

As is, the recipe is very good. The second time making it I made a double batch in a 9x13 pan, did a parchment paper sling, cut the sugar by 25%, and added a tiny bit of cinnamon and lemon zest to the crumble mixture. I used homemade strawberry/raspberry/apple jam. Came out wonderful and I have recieved many complements.

Too crumbly and soft.  I also added white and milk chocolate chips.  A little too sweet.  Wouldn’t make again.  On the plus side, it was super easy with minimal ingredients.

I made these for Christmas handouts! Rave reviews! My college daughters requested them and they mail well. These have become my "go to", need to "make some thing in a pinch" bars. Change the fruit flavor, our favorite is BlackBerry.

This is a very versatile recipe and can be modified using any sort of jam. My children and grandchildren like these bars with milk chocolate chips sprinkled over the jam before adding the final crumb topping. Again, any type of chips could be used to change up the flavor.

Very nice recipe!  I doubled it and used a 7 x 11 pan.  I wanted them to be a little thicker. I used blackberry preserves because that's what I had on hand.   Also added some dark chocolate chips to the top.  It's a keeper!

Added a tbsp of chia seeds to the jam, and a splash of 1% milk to the crumb mixture to make it stick together just a little bit better.  Love this recipe!!!

I found it a bit dry I think I’d add a tablespoon of liquid (lemon juice?) next time.  Also a touch of lemon would make it pop!  Other than that I love the taste of oats butter and brown sugar together.  My adult son turned down the idea of these after they were baked I gad o e, the next morning 4 had been eating!

Turned out great - made twice now in last 24 hours.  I recommend greased parchment paper over tinfoil and added a touch of cinnamon and vanilla.  Very easy and delicious. Make sure to not spoon jam too close to the edges.

I made this exactly as written to RAVE reviews (my brother doesn't even like fruit desserts, and he asked me for this recipe and his wife was shocked!)

I followed the advice of other users, which definitely made all the difference:
1. Use parchment paper to line the entire pan, sides and all 
2. Mix the dry ingredients and the butter with your hands 
3. Keep the raspberry jam 1/4 inch away from the edges of the pan
4. DON'T make this the same day you want to eat it--it was crumbly at first, but after sitting for 18-24 hours, it was PERFECT...moist and yummy and totally deliscious.
5. NOTE:  The top layer of crumbs did NOT cover the entire surface area of the pan--so you will see patches of jelly peeking through--that is a-okay, it is still delicious.

I will be making this as often as i can from now on!

These were delicious and insanely easy to make. I wouldn’t change a thing about the recipe. I was a little short on the raspberry jam so I can’t wait to make these again with a little more filling!

I looked up this recipe after succumbing to an impulse buy in the Whole Foods checkout line. I found this recipe to be serviceable, but not as good as the WF bar was. That one had a creamier texture to it and this one was just a little too sweet for me. I will continue the hunt....

I love this recipe! I use gluten free oats to make it healthier. Instead of raspberry, I mix a can of pumpkin with a can of coconut milk. After they are baked, I drizzle them with white chocolate. They are a huge hit at gatherings.

I have made it several times and only changed two things.  The first is to double the recipe, and use a larger pan, of course.   The second was that it seemed to me that the rasperry jam itself, especially the seedless stuff, was a bit bland, and lacking in flavor.   I solved this by sprinkling about a cup and a half of chopped up frozen raspberries onto the top of the jam, before adding the final layer of topping and baking it.   Adds a bit of raspberry punchiness to the recipe.

REALLY good. Came out GREAT. That being said, of course I modified the recipe to my family tastes: Vanilla, chopped walnuts and chopped candied orange peel. Next time will try candied ginger (Trader Joes has excellent versions of each). I also used TJs reduced sugar superfruit jam. I was concerned that it might not bake up well with reduced sugar jam, but it was perfect. Also a note about toasting coconut. I turned the oven to 350 and put the pan with the coconut on it in the COLD oven. I was busy, you know. By the time the oven was beeping that it had reached temperature, I smelled lovely toasty coconut smells. I checked the coconut. It was PERFECTLY TOASTED, evenly, even the parts that I had lumped, and the thin areas were not burned, It was golden, crispy, delicate. First time I have ever toasted coconut in the oven without burning the first batch, or being unevenly toasted. I was amazed. I have repeated this a couple of time s since. WORKS every time.

I made this in a hurry, and it was absolutely delicious..  Did add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to crumb mixture, because I like the taste. Quick, easy, and all ingredients you have on hand.  Don't be afraid to experiment with the jam.  If you like the flavor, try it!

I just doubled the recipe and used jam without added sugar. They were delicious, devoured quickly and I had no trouble with jam leaking out. Making another batch again.

This was extremely easy to make. I didn't have all the stick butter I needed so I substituted spreadable butter for part of it. I also did not have seedless raspberry jam so I used seeded. I think you could also use apricot, blackberry or whatever you like. They were amazing. The only lasted a couple hours. My family could not stop eating them. Simple and delicious. I am making them again this morning.

These are really good. Crisp like a cookie, but not too dry.  I used apricot preserves because my store did not have anything raspberry so while I technically did not make 'raspberry oatmeal cookie bars', they came out delicious anyway. I will make these again and experiment with other flavors.

Made gluten free, this was a big hit with my family.  It was very easy to make and delicious! I’ll definitely be making this again. I made it gluten free by substituting the exact amount of flour with Bob’ Red Mill One to One Gluten Free Baking flour.

Yummy!  I didn't use jam. I just combined fresh raspberries with some sugar and a bit if lemon juice, and it worked great. I also skipped the foil and didn't have a problem with it sticking. This was a great way to use some of our fresh raspberries!

I had to make my brown sugar (1/2c white sugar 1/2T molasses) which gave it a stronger flavor then regular brown sugar. I served it with vanilla ice cream while it was still warm. So good! I used parchment paper.

Instead of Raspberry Jam, I used crushed frozen raspberries. Due to that, next time I will try adding some applesauce so it's more moist, or more butter to get it to crisp up for a more firm bar. Delicious though!

two changes we made:
-had to melt the butter because it wasn't mixing in otherwise
-added 3-4X the berry mix (used fresh berries not jam) than in the recipe to cover it well
-just doubled the rest of the recipe and made it in a 6x12" pyrex

Great basic recipe. Delicious as written and easy to modify. I generally have all the ingredients on hand, so I can make them on the spur of the moment. The flavor is more complex than you would think. They cut well. Addictive.

My neighbor gives me fresh raspberries.  I add sugar and microwave 2 minutes.  Then I follow this recipe .  Works GREAT!  I also like to let cool and sprinkle a little powdered sugar over the bars after cutting.  Look forward to late June every year!

Lovely recipe. I made it with a few changes;

Used Bob Mills gluten free Muesli (took out the raisins!)with added coconut and pumpkin seeds as I did not have plain oats on hand.
I cooked about 6oz of frozen rasberries until looked like thick jam instead of jelly.Cut the sugar and used extra pinch of salt.Thank you for posting! They were really Good!

The jam is good but it is too crumbly.   I think that it needs a little more butter to hold it together. Not really anything special., but not terrible. Wouldn’t waste my time making it again though.

I enjoy this recipe very much! The bars are delicious; they taste and look like they are professionally made in a bakery! I made some changes because I wanted to use up some ingredients that I had at home. Because I wanted to use up my quinoa flakes that are expiring, I decided to used 1/2 cup quinoa flakes and 1/2 cup rolled oats instead of the full cup of oats that the recipe calls for. Instead of raspberry jam, I used my freshly made homemade strawberry mango jam. Like another reviewer, I also processed all of the crumb ingredients in my food processor (butter cut in small cubes) and lined my 8×8 baking sheet with parchment paper. That is it -- easy-peasy!

DELICIOUS.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  Instead of using preserves I used frozen raspberries.  I combined  the raspberries with 1/4 cup of sugar and cooked until it was reduced by almost half.  I find store-bought preserves too sweet.  You can even sub strawberries for the raspberries.

Delicious & easy. A little sweeter than I like. Next time will use sugar free jam & drizzle with dark chocolate.

Very good but I used raspberry pie filling vs. jam.  It was less sweet which I liked.  Next time I would add an egg white to the crumbs in the base so it holds together a little better.

Wow, what a great simple quick dessert! People gobbled it up and several asked for the recipe. I didn't have enough berry jam so I used fig jam too. The FIG JAM IS A WINNER! I will make this again and continue to experiment with different jams although I will always use some fig jam.

I’ve made this recipe twice now - followed it once and made some healthier changes the second time :) I subbed in 1/4c apple sauce for half the butter (gets rid of the crumble, too), 1c whole wheat flour for AP and half the jelly/jam. I used whatever jelly I have on hand, although I might mention that strawberry isn’t quite flavorful enough. I used that the first time and it wasn’t as good as the second time when I used raspberry (with seeds) and blueberry mixed together. Next I might try grape. Now, they are more like filling granola bars instead of a dessert. Perfect for kiddos and/or just a healthy snack.

This recipe hardly needs another review...however. Easy and quick to make.  Very sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly - There is too much topping for me, so next time I'll reduce those ingredients by 1/4, keep 2c for the base and what's left for the topping.  I may keep the butter amount as is to make a firmer crust.  I really creamed the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients and it was still too crumbly.  I made half with apricot jam and the other with raspberry.

The flavor of these is very good, however, the texture leaves much to be desired. They are way to dry and crumbly. Perhaps there’s a way to make these bind together better.

Good bars. :) Make sure you really mix well with your hands to keep them dense and moist and not crumbly. These could, in my opinion use a little extra something, another small layer, but overall they're really good for how ridiculously easy and quick they are to whip up.

The bars were decent but I did have an issue with the amount of jelly used. There was too much jelly from following the recipe, making the bars too sweet. I would suggest using less if you were to make this.

I really liked these raspberry bars especially warmed up in the micro with a good cup of coffee. The only thing I thought the crumb topping was a little dry. I think I'll bake it 5 minutes less next time and see what happens. Other than that, a great bar cookie !

Made it exactly like it said to. I brought it to a high school reunion. I am the best known cook in my class but everyone hated it. They said I could have made something better. The raspberry sauce was too sweet and the oatmeal tasted stale after being in the oven.  I was not impress by this recepy. I don’t recommend it to anyone.

Great results for minimal effort! Using cooking spray, I followed what the instructions said to prepare the pan. It was very easy to just remove the whole thing in one piece from the pan, and then cut into bars. The sides were a little crispy, so I trimmed a very small portion off because I'm gifting most of these. Those won't go to waste, either....I've tried some, and they're very good! I can see using other fillings, as well, such as another flavor preserve or even chocolate or Nutella? Thanks for the great recipe!

Made as directed...I didn't bother lining the pan with foil, just used BAKING spray (has flour). So, so good. I'll be experimenting with different jams and preserves, too.

Delicious! I have to say though, that I also followed the advice of one of the reviewers to add 1 egg and some apple sauce to make the oat mix less crumbly and cut down the fat. The first time I made these bars I didn't use the egg...still yummy, but it was so crumbly...and the second time I am glad I did, since we had friends over and my, they all loved the bars!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe as written with the exception that I used fresh whole raspberries straight from my garden. They worked perfectly.  I think they tasted better the second day. I used parchment paper instead of tinfoil and didn't have any problems with berries burning and sticking. I'm making a double batch tonight to take to work.

Very good and easy.  I doubled recipe to make in a 9X13 pan.  I added 2 beaten eggs (for doubled recipe) to make a more cohesive dough.  Made in food processor; made it easier to mix the butter in.   Used 2 different jams-store bought was easier to spread on the dough than homemade dough was.

The kids loved this.  I also made another version with apricot preserves and they loved that too.  Since I live in Hawaii, I'm going to try it with lilikoi and also guava!  Should be tasty but I'll leave the ratings to the kids.

This recipe is great as is! No need to make any changes. My family loved to eat them with vanilla ice cream. These will be on rotation in my house.

I couldn't find raspberry jam so substituted with BlackBerry. It was a little sweet but overall good, I might make it again. The foil lined pan was a great tip.

This is an excellent recipe!  These taste so much like my favorite Raspberry Oat Bar that I used to buy at a pricey bakery.  Unfortunately for the bakery, I won't be buying it from them anymore because they're so easy to make and the ingredients are always pretty much always on hand in my home.  The only small change I made is in lining the bottom of the pan with parchment and greasing the sides.  I always do that with anything I fear might stick.  After allowing it to cool for 30 minutes I ran a knife around the sides and flipped it onto my serving tray.  It came out with tremendous ease.

I liked it, but I feel like something is missing. I think maybe the preserves with seeds would help out. The crumble to jelly ration might be off. Still good, but not 5 stars for me.

Made these twice.  First time I thought , gee I didn't leave them bake long enough.  This time, I made sure to bake them longer.  Both times left a soft crust, not one that is easy to handle.  As for the taste--- they are good!

I made a couple of minor changes.....1/2 cup quick cooking oats and 1/2 cup long cooking oats.  I also used homemade blackberry jam.  Any kind of jam could be used, but homemade has more flavor.   Quick and yummy......will make again.

I was looking for a cookie style treat to satisfy both an egg allergy and a dairy allergy. This really fit the bill by just substituting the same amount of butter with a non dairy butter. I used " I can't believe it's not butter" vegan option. I also used strawberry jam because I had it on hand. The bars are so good and easy. The next time I try it I am going to add coconut to the crust part.

Quick and easy desert that absolutely no one should be able to mess up.  I basically followed the directions as given.  But like most reviewers, I doubled the recipe and used my hands to massage the mixture.   I also added 1 tsp cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture.  But I used an 11.5 x 8 inch dish lined with parchment paper which I coated with cooking spray.  I baked for 40 minutes at 350 F.  I used the entire jar of jam (340 grams = 10 oz).  My only mistake was that I used too much of the mixture for the bottom layer.  But it is all trial and error.  I will make again.

These were fantastic! I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 pan. I put too much on the bottom half bc there wasn't enough to cover the top layer but it was still fine. I also didn't measure the raspberry jam, I just put a ton on until I felt it was good enough. Overall it was delicious and I will definitely make these again.

This was the second time I've made these, the first time I made as written, the second time, I doubted it. The only change I made was, I used blueberry jam and fresh blueberries, only because it was I had on hand. This is only recipe I'll use. It was easy and one of the most requested deserts I'm asked to bring . You don't need to change a thing, they are perfect just as written.

The remaining oatmeal mix that goes on top of the raspberry jam I added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans. It came out great! Like my thumbprint cookies at Christmas but without all the work.

Very simple recipe, using ingredients I always have on hand. Buttery, simple clean flavor, with a nice tang from the raspberry jam. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the oat mixture. Delicious. Made for a cookout/crab eat with family and they disappeared in minutes. Recommend making a double batch !

I didn't make any changes except for using seedless black raspberry preserves which were this recipe's only saving grace, IMHO.

It was simple to put together but  wasn't anything special at all and the reserved oat mixture that is sprinkled on top turned out very coarse and was unappealing. These bars crumbled so could not be served to dinner guests.  I won't make them again.

I did some changes to make it diabetic friendly. I used whole wheat flour, cut the brown sugar in half ,replaced the other half with Splenda, and I used sugar free blackberry jam. Couldn't find sugar free raspberry. Best tasting  Splenda baking recipe so far.

Wow!  These did not last very long in my house.  Instead of the raspberry however, I used strawberry jam as I don't really care for raspberry.  My next batch will be using black currant jam. The right amount of sweetness and crunch.  Thanks for your tasty and easy recipe!

I have made this more than once for my family! They just love it. My daughter who usually doesn't eat anything with oatmeal loves the bars. She will ask me to make it for her. It is simple to make, delicious to eat!

Followed all directions exactly, including the bizarre one to grease the pan and then line it with greased aluminum foil. I have never done that in my life. These bars were dry and very crumbly. Perhaps more raspberry jam would make them moister. I'll be looking for a different recipe.

Super easy recipe with things I had on hand. I used food processor to make the crust, pulsing lightly to not pulverize the oats. Will use a slightly more sour jelly next time. So easy and so good.

I liked that the recipe had so few ingredients.  I was able to make this in my RV and got great compliments.  Because the preserves are sweet , I may use less sugar next time.

Loved it.  So easy and delicious.  While I was preparing the recipe I was skeptical thinking the bars wouldn't firm up but they did.  Once cooled they were moist and firm. Perfect.  
Next time I may add a little chopped pecans on top.  Also may swap out the raspberry for blueberry jam.  There's all kinds of possibilities with this recipe.  This one is definitely a keeper.

This was OK, but I think it would have been better with more jam.  With extra jam, I think it would be worthy of 4 stars.

An excellent recipe. I didn't have seedless jam, so I used the raspberry preserves that I had. It worked fine. I also added some cinnamon to the bar mix. I much prefer this recipe to the commercial raspberry bar mixes sold in the store.

I will definitely be playing around with this recipe to try to find a better ratio of ingredients. They were good but definitely need to tone down the sugar.

This came out very good, and my wife and I liked it quite a bit, though I made a few modifications as listed below:
* used parchment paper instead of aluminum foil
* used 1/4 cup fresh raspberries (blended with 1/4 cup powered sugar since I didn't have raspberry jam
* added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips (mixed in with raspberries)

Next time I'll split the top and bottom portions of the oat mix evenly instead of 2 cups under, and 1 cup on top.  I used a food processor to mix all the ingredients.

Just wanted to note that I added a layer of sliced fresh strawberries over the strawberry jam, and it was delicious. Next time will double. This is the perfect homemade version of a boxed mix from my childhood that I loved - thanks!

I made these last night and they turned out great.  Didn't have raspberry jam so I used blackberry-raspberry jam instead and added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the crust.  Didn't warm the jam in the micro. before trying to spread--would have made spreading it much easier.  Definitely recommend this recipe and I'm sure children would enjoy helping to prepare and eat!

Great recipe and so easy! I doubled it for a 9 x13 pan. I had some frozen raspberries I wanted to use up, so made a quick jam with those, and it still worked out fine. I sprinkled some of the crumbs for the top  along the edge of the pan before adding the jam, to keep it from spreading too far.

This is good for kids but to sweet for an adult pallet.  It's also easy for kids to make.  The recipe calls to pat the last layer down lightly, I would say even less than that.  For adults I would add more oatmeal and some pecans, maybe a little more flour and butter.

Perfect , I didn't change a thing. So far all my guests just love them. I pack some up for them after breakfast and they are great for their mountain excursions.

So easy and so delicious!!  Made 15 servings in 11x7 pan, used cooking spray instead of foil and it worked great! Will definitely make these again!

Instead of raspberry jam,  I used a cherry spread that contains a lot less sugar than jam.  Since we are not a huge fan of anything really sweet, this worked out perfectly.  Also, doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13" pan.  Very quick and easy recipe and one that we will definitely make again!

I've made a similar bar many times. They are my go-to recipe for parties and potlucks. "Are you going to bring "those" cookies?"

 I add an equal amount of fresh fruit to the jam, mashing the fruit slightly but still leaving recognizable pieces. It really "bumps up" the taste. I found a peach-mango preserves in the store and made the bars with that and fresh peaches.

I have made these multiple times. They are easy to bake and taste great! I like to use real raspberries along with the jam. I also sometimes add a few chocolate chips in it and sprinkle oats on the top. I also love this recipe because it is easy to make it gluten free.

I love this recipe!  However, I use 1 cup of jam instead of the 3/4 cup and have used different flavors of jam. Blackberry, plum, apricot, blueberry/raspberry & apricot/blackberry.

I just made these for a formal tea.  I needed a lot so I tripled the recipe to fit on a large restaurant style sheet pan.  I also lined it with parchment paper.  It worked perfectly and I baked it for the same time.

These are a quick and delicious solution when you find out without much warning that you need to bring treats somewhere.  Any jam works, I've even used my homemade cranberry orange relish as a filling.  My son asked me try orange marmalade next time I make them.  Sounds good to me!

Delicious and easy to make. When I went to my pantry i was bummed to see  i didn't have quick oats!  I did find some maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal so i substituted that and cut the brown sugar in half.  Wasn't sure if they'd turn out good, but they did!!

My husband loves these jelly bars!  So do I!  At least some healthy items, oatmeal....and um.... LOL  Sometimes I do put unsweet organic coconut flakes in to add more fiber and love coconut but with the oats not necessary,  Stick to recipe!  Very good.  Mine come out different each time I think because of how soft butter is when I mix it in but always good!  Kids would love too in place of store bought cookies!  I change jelly too, sometimes raspberry, blueberry, blackberry.  I also use a lower sugar jelly.  Love them!

Very tasty! Not super sweet, which was a plus for me. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception - using vegan butter instead of regular butter since one family member is dairy free. Still turned out well and would definitely make again. Could be a great dessert dish for a potluck!

I have made this bar twice now but really just used the "crumble" part and switched up the filling. The second time I made this I put half the crumble mixture in my foor processor and blitzed it up to a fine crumb and then packed that down as the base. For the filling I made my own chia seed cranberry/raspberry jam-super yum. I also added coconut-1/4 cup to the other half of reserved crumble mixture.

I doubled the recipe, added half a cup of chopped walnuts, and substituted preserved cherries and kept it at 3/4 c. I'm glad I kept it at 3/4 c because I think a cup and a half of jam/preserves would have been way too sweet for me. It came out amazing with the modifications! I will probably try a blackberry or blueberry jam next time!

Very good!  The only changes I made were using strawberry jam (it's what I had on hand) and I did put a sprinkling of slivered almonds on the jam.  I cut the bars large and served it with a strawberry infused whipped cream to make it dessert after dinner.  Delicious!

These were so good!  I doubled the recipe, and used half butter, half applesauce to cut the fat/calories.  At first I thought it was going to be too much raspberry preserves, but it was actually just right.  My preserves had seeds in them and it was fine!  Boyfriend gobbled them up - will definitely make again!

If you love raspberry, this is awesome!  I suspect you could use other preserves as well?  Easy to make

I make this recipe all the time, it's quick and super-easy, and  is a top favorite of friends and family. One cool thing about this recipe is it is easily altered for diabetics by replacing the brown sugar with Brown Sugar Splenda (use 1/4 cup Splenda, half the amount of brown sugar the recipe calls for), and Simple Fruit or other sugar-free jam...it's so easy, and the recipients will feel really special because you made a recipe just for them.

sooo delicious! the first time i made this i forgot to add the baking soda and it was fine, it was firm enough to stay together when you picked it up and was crunchy. the second time i made this i remembered the baking soda and i could still pick it up but it was fragile. i experimented with different fillings such as peanut butter, homemade blackberry preserves, and raseberry jam. peanut butter is too thick and you need loots of water when drinking it. homemade preseves were good, but there were still seeds in it which ruined the experiments. jam was the best (like the recipe said) i think berry and more sour flavors would make better fillings.

This recipe is okay. Its not the best because I think they call for too much rasberry it should be a little less and also I think it depends what brand of the rasberry you use. I used Smuckers and it doesnt taste that great with it. Maybe in the future I will use other jam brands just to see if there is a difference.

These are amazing! I can't keep them in the house for long because they're so good. I make my own jam and it makes a huge difference.

I followed recipe and my family loved them.  Second time, i added about a half cup crushed walnuts to oat mixture as well as made a mixed berry jam (only because I didn't feel like going to the grocery and I happened to have berries). Five stars for both recipes.

This is a delicious bar cookie recipe. My only changes are to add 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and a dash of cinnamon to the dough. They pair so deliciously with the raspberry jam. I often double the recipe and bake in a 9X13 pan. And on occasion I make these with apricot preserves. In that case, I omit the almond extract and add in 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract.

Made it with awesome raspberry seeded jam from a local farm market. It turned out wonderful. Not sure why the original recipe calls for seedless jam. Probably a matter of taste but my local guy makes the best raspberry jam ever.  I will make this again.  Very easy to make.

Sorry to say it wasn't a hit.  It was a lot drier then I expected.  Nice flavor but it needs something to make it more moist.  It came out like a very dry granola bar.  No one in my family liked it.  We ended up throwing it out.

I  have made this 3 times and used a different jam for each one.  Raspberry, Apricot and Cherry.  I took them to work for a pot luck and everyone loved them. So easy to make!

I have made these for years - this recipe is identical to one that was put out by Crisco. You can also change up the jam flavor too!  Original recipe calls for a frosting type glaze. Good breakfast bar! YUM

This tasted really good.  Son's adorable girlfriend made it and hers was 5 stars.  She used the seedless raspberry jam which is really excellent.  When I went to the store there was no seedless so I got Black Currant which looked clear but actually had seeds and skin fragments.  Ah well.  But here is my BIG QUESTION: what do I have to do to make the top get golden brown?  It was pale and looked unbaked.  Adorable girlfriend  had the same experience. I sprayed the baking dish with Bakers Joy and it was easily removed.  Nothing stuck.

Followed recipe exactly, these red raspberry bars were outstanding. I never alter a recipe I til I make as directed.  Would I alter this one? No, it's perfect. I took out the vanilla & never used it.  I used one reviewer's advice and used the food processor to blend the butter & dry ingredients. Then, I finished blending with my fingers. I also used Reynold's non-stick foil  but I still sprayed it-just in case. Lifted from the pan like a dream.

Amazing! I made as directed with slightly less strawberry jam, as I was running low. Next time I will use less sugar I think. It was VERY sweet.

Theses were delicious, buttery, and simple. I did line the pan with foil. when they were done baking, I removed them from the pan by lifting them on the foil and let them cool on a wire rack. They stayed nice and crisp.

Delicious, quick and easy.  My "very particular " husband devoured these. 
I think  I will add fresh raspberries next time but  they were great without them.  Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice creme...HEAVENLY.

I made a raspberry one exactly as the recipe was posted. It was outstanding. Then I made two more, one blueberry, and one apricot. All delicious, but my family in enjoyed the apricot one the most.   Based on multiple enthusiastic thumbs up on this recipe, I know I'll be making it a lot more often -  especially since they are such a snap to make.

***** UPDATE :   I just experimented with a pumpkin butter version.  After putting Dickensin's Country Pumpkin Butter  for the fruit preserve, I added a light sprinkle of pumpkin pie seasoning for extra punch.  THEN, I mixed chopped pecans to the topping.  It came out delicious!  Going to be making a lot during the holidays!

This was a delicious recipe! I did double it as the original recipe doesnt produce enough. The one change I would make is to use have the sugar in the recipe. The jam is sweet enough already.

Very easy & quick recipe. I used raspberry jelly with seeds b/c I didn't feel like spending more money for a jar of seedless. I also warmed up the jelly in the microwave for a few seconds prior to spreading it onto the crust. This made it easier to spread as suggested by several people.To me the seed/seedless is personal preference. I liked how this wasn't too sweet or tart. I ate them for dessert & as a breakfast cookie bar. Next time I will put a little bit of lemon zest as one reviewer suggested in the jelly. I will also put extra jelly for the filling. I wonder how using blueberry jelly instead of raspberry will taste. Great recipe to build off of!

It was really good, I'm not a raspberry fan or I would have loved it.  Next time I'll just use a different jam, I usually don't change recipes I try to follow them as the chef posted, then next time I alter yo my likes.

Delicious! I used my homemade raspberry jam with this recipe and it is just the right sweetness with a hint of salty. I did accidentally put in a tad more salt from the recipe , so I guess my oops was good thing for ours. Will defiantly be making these again. A great compliment to a cup of coffee!

Made this last night and would make again. Used wholewheat flour, omitted the brown sugar and added in 2 Tbsp honey to the oat/flour mixture, used 1/3 cup of jam and added 1/2 cup blueberries. Halved the butter and added in 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. Was nervous about it drying out so only baked it 25 minutes and then let the residual heat work it's magic, it turned out well. Not at all dry, not too sweet  - would be great topped with ice cream, though it wouldn't be as healthy lol. Thinking about eating it with some Greek yogurt instead for a "treat"

The process of making this was not very enjoyable. I had to make two batches of the oat mixture because the "two cups pressed onto the pan" was all that was in the mixture! Think: 1 cup flour and 1 cup of oats (plus the other tsp of things...) but that would only MAKE 2 cups.So I needed to make another batch to fill the TOP.  I had to cook it longer then it said to make it because it wasn't COOKED. This recipe wasn't thought out very well when it was made.

When I saw this recipe it reminded me of a raisin bar I ate as a little kid (60 years ago).  I think it is the same bar. I made it as is, with raspberries and it was wonderful but I intend to make it again, first with raisins then with other fruits.

Excellent quick recipe to get a tasty dessert on the table  with little  effort. I made the recipe exactly as written except I used homemade strawberry jam instead of raspberry. Any jam could really be used in this recipe. Next time I make this I am going to double the amount of jam to give it more flavor. My layer of jam disappeared a little during baking.

This was a fun dessert while camping!  Before I left I put all the dry ingredients in a plastic zipper top bag.  Then I mixed in the butter by squishing it around in the closed bag of dry ingredients.  You could use any flavor jelly.  Great with vanilla ice cream.

I used parchment paper cut into 8x8 sheets at the bottom of my pans.  Much better then aluminum foil for cooking, serving and clean up.  Also baking for 32-33 minutes makes a better less hard cookie.

i made these bars so I could use some fig jam I made. They were buttery and delicious!  Everyone I shared them with loved them!  Putting the foil on the bottom made it  easy to take them out of the pan!  It's a make again recipe.

With one exception, the directions were followed exactly as written; however, the one exception was the use of  Sugar Free Jam.

A wonderful recipe that my wife loves so much that she has asked me to make them three times in one week!

This  is a great recipe.  I used less sugar, and apricot pineapple jam.   Replaced half the butter with an egg.   This will become one of my go to recipes for a quick dessert.   I make my own Jam, with fresh fruit as it becomes available.  Can't wait to try my cherry lemonade jam.

I made these bars with seedless blackberry jam and they were great. I did not make any modifications. Make sure the topping is well blended and crumbly before topping.

I have made this 3  times. First time as written and its very good and easy. The 2nd time I used almond flour and added finely chopped walnuts to the topping, excellent results. The 3rd time I subbed coconut oil for the butter, used only 1/2 cup jam and added a mix of almonds and walnuts (chopped finely) to the topping- this is how I will make it from now on! Excellent!! Next time I might even add some unsweetened coconut to the topping... This is a great recipe to adapt to whatever your tastes or diet restrictions might be. Also a great recipe to be doubled. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I didn't have butter so I  used margarine and I'm sure that's what happened.  Well maybe.  They were not sweet enough and very packy.  Will not be making these again even with butter.

These are awesome!!!  And incredibly easy to make.  When they were done and I took a small sample I wanted to sit down and eat half the pan.  As a Type 2 Diabetic I knew that would be a no-no.  I ended up cutting mine into bite sized morsels and storing in the fridge in an air tight container.  A nice mouthful  to look forward to with after dinner coffee.  I especially loved the oatmeal topping, and I'm thinking of making this minus the filling.  Has anyone done this?

I used 10 ounces of jam, 3/4 cup didn't cover the bottom crust.  Also, I heated the jam in the microwave for 15 seconds to make it more spreadable.

Doubled the recipe like everyone else- I did two 8x8 pans each with a different homemade jam that I had just made tons of due to the large number of peaches and plums I had from our trees.  So one was filled with peach jam and the other was filled with plum/peach/mango jam.  Both were equally loved at a party and since there were none to take home I just made another batch!

Where's the egg in this recipe?  There's nothing to hold the crumble together, so that's what this dish becomes, a crumble.  Good flavor, but definitely a "eat straight out the pan" kind of dish.  I would not classify this as a bar recipe.

I'll probably make this tonight, sounds really good. Why did you grease the pan and the foil? It seems the point of the foil was to keep the pan clean...

This was an excellent recipe!     Put everything in my stand mixer (except the jam!!) and it came out crumbly without the mess of working in the butter with my hands.  I questioned greasing the pan AND the foil, but I did it and they came out perfect!

I made these last night and followed the directions exactly except, as other reviewers suggested, doubled the recipe.  They are delicious - I mean really good!  I had one stick of butter in the fridge and had to take one out of the freezer and after waiting an hour, accidently put the one from the fridge in the microwave to soften (I have that feature on my microwave) so it melted a little but I found that did not interfere with the construction process and perhaps enhanced it as I added the melted portion after creating the crumbs (I used a pastry blender/knife).  My family is going to love these at tonight's bowling party (except they will be short two bars that I ate LOL).  Thanks!!!

Delicious.  I doubled the recipe as recommended by others and baked in a 9x13" pan.  I will definitely make these again however I may experiment with different jams/filling or reduce the filling by 1/3.   The raspberry jam I used, although naturally sweetened, still seemed too sweet for my liking.  My family had no complaints.  Easy and quick to make. Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good as is but I also added about 1 cup of fresh cranberries that I cooked down with a bit of water and sugar.  Not much of either since there is plenty of sweet in the bars and I did not want them too runny.  The sweet and tangy from the berries and cranberries is wonderful. 
These are a "go to" bar when I need a quick dessert or treat to bring someplace.

Wonderful recipe! I used fresh blackberries since they were ripe  this week (just mashed them up a bit with a teaspoon of sugar). I also doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  The entire family loved them - this is going to be our annual recipe for blackberry season!

The recipe is awesome.  I did double the recipe, for a 9 x 13, and used my mom-in-laws strawberry freezer jam, instead of the raspberry.  It turned out incredibly well.  I will be trying different fillings in the future.  The oatmeal mixture is really good.  THANKS!

This is an updated review. The day that I made these, they were pretty crumbly and didn't particularly impress me. By the next day, they had solidified a bit more, and the flavor seemed somewhat bolder. My husband loved them (crumbly or not). Because they were much better after letting them sit for a day (and because my hubby really liked them), I will be making these again. I plan to experiment with different jams to see if that makes a difference with enhancing the flavor.

Make these for work quite frequently and they are gone in less than ten minutes! I use homemade or store bought jam with equal success. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I double it and put it in a 9 x 13 pan.

Tasty and very quick to make.  I did not have any raspberry jam on hand, so substituted fresh raspberries. I added an egg as it looked like it needed more moisture. It seemed to help it blend together better. I put a drop of vanilla extract in everything  I bake.as it seems to help enhance the other flavors.

When I made them I did a double batch - one simply isn't enough for the demand.

I messed up this recipe, I forgot to add the flour  by accident but I did add a 1/2 cup white sugar on purpose. I looked in on the bars about halfway and realized my mistake when I saw the sugars bubbling. They turned out like a granola bar , they were great I loved them.

I doubled the recipe for a 9x13" lined with foil. Used 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1/4 tsp (this was accidental but tasted great), added 1/2 tsp McCormick Saigon Cinnamon. Reduced flour from 2c to 1-3/4c for a softer crumb. Used an entire 13oz jar of Bonne Maman raspberry preserves which are so good I can eat it plain. I think choosing a bold flavored jelly/preserve is crucial to making this shine. I wouldn't downgrade this recipe due to the changes because I followed exactly the first time and liked it.

I cut back the sugar based on other reviews.  I think it depends on the jam used.  Would have liked it a little sweeter.  Should definitely have added lemon juice.

I needed a quick, easy recipe to take to a winery for our dessert.  I found this and it was just what I was looking for.  With minimal ingredients and very few steps it was quick and easy.  I added some toasted sliced almonds and chocolate chips which I sprinkled on the jam before putting the topping on.  These bars came out heavenly!  They go great with wine, by the way!

These were super easy to make and completely scrumptious.  They only lasted one day.  I  tried it with Strawberry  Blackberry jam, next I will be trying Applebutter.  I also substituted applesauce for butter and used less sugar.

I changed it up a bit, using all organic ingredients and no salt. I also used Organic Cherry preserves instead of the Raspberry and it came out absolutely terrific. I will be quadrupling the recipe next time, they didn't make a whole lot of bars. I suggest at least doubling the recipe to make them last longer than an hour or two! I loved this recipe.

These are really good and so simple my 4 yr old was able to helped make them. We didn't have enough jam so I did a layer of frozen berries instead and they turned out fantastic. They are a tad sweet for our taste so next time I am going to reduce the sugar by 25%. On that note I'll probably reduce the butter too as they were really buttery and that says something coming from a girl who loves butter. Great recipe overall.  We will make this regular in our house.

I toasted the oatmeal in a pan before using. I also made a few changes to makes to a bit healthier. Palm sugar  and raw honey instead of brown sugar. I used spelt flour. Used  half butter and half applesauce. I did have to use a bit more oats and flour because the  dough was a bit wetter with my substitutes. It was really good!

Delicious!  I followed other's advice and baked 33 minutes then turn off oven and leave in for 2 minutes before removing to cool in pan. Wait to remove and cut until fully cooled. Good with blackberry and blueberry jam.. probably all jam those are just the ones I've tried so far. I also use less brown sugar since jam is so sweet and add cinnamon to mixture.

I used strawberry jam here, and I felt it was a bit too sweet as a result, but everyone else seemed to love them. The oatmeal bars themselves were quite good, and were quick and easy to make.

These bars are fabulous! We switched out the jam for frozen fruit to cut down on the sugar content and doubled the recipe. Our family ate almost the whole pan in one sitting!

I make these all the time. I have used frozen raspberries in place of the jam and they turn out great. I have also substituted coconut oil for butter which gives a different flavor but works great. These would be great with any kind of jam or fruit, I should think.

I make these every year for the holidays.  I make different favors by changing the jelly type. Some of the ones I have made that have been BIG hits are Lemon Curd and Apricot Jam.  You can also use Apple Pie filling, but you have to cut the apples into much smaller pieces.  I baking times are the same.  You can also add either cinnamon or nutmeg ( especially to the apple or apricot) to the crumble mixture.  I always double the recipe for each flavor and I use 1/4 tsp of spice.

Enjoyed & yes would make again. I had thawed left over raspberries, strained them , & put on top of base . I did sprinkle raspberries with a bit of sugar , but wasn't probably necessary, I just thought they could of been a bit tart. Cut a square & had with ice cream as a treat

Super easy recipe.  I made some modifications:  8x11 glass pan (I prefer a thinner base), reduced sugar to 1/3 cup, increased jam to 1 cup, added a generous layer of chopped walnuts, and finally drizzled some melted semi-sweet chocolate once cooled.  It tasted almost exactly like an old Slovak recipe my mom used to make for us as kids.  Delish!!

Everyone loves these! I'm not sure what it is. I find them just a touch too buttery, so next time I will cut the butter in half and maybe substitute in unsweetened applesauce for the other half as some have suggested. But everyone loves them with the full amount of butter! I also used 1 cup of strawberry preserves instead, and people seem to just go nuts over these things with a cup of coffee. It's one of my 'emergency' staples when I have unexpected visitors, or visit with someone at their home.

I am 23 and Rookie baker but the way, just getting into it. So I made these for my parents last night. They absolutely loved them. I added a table spoon of cinnamon to the crust and also added one egg to keep them from crumbling. I didn't have enough jam, so I added half a cup of canned crushed pineapple. I noticed it took the some of the sweetness from the jam away and made it more tangy rather than sweet. So good!

I followed recipe all the way through (I always do this initially before future tweaking).  The only slight modification is that I used raspberry fruit spread instead of jam (much less sugar and more of a natural fruit taste).  These bars are so good and very easy to make.

I thought these were just okay.  I made them for Christmas.  Some people raved about them and some didn't say anything.  Mixed reviews.  I used my favorite raspberry jelly from a local restaurant and bakery.  Be careful not to spread the jelly too close to the edge.  The recipe states 1/4 in from the edge.  I would even say that's too close.  My jelly spread to the pan and caused the pan to be a disaster to clean.

This simple dessert is a constant hit whenever I make it. I always have everything on hand to prepare them since all of the ingredients are staple items. I have tried them with a variety of jam flavors, but my favorite is the raspberry and I add chopped walnuts to the topping.

So delicious and easy!  The first time I made these bars,  I followed the recipe exactly.  Second time, I made some changes:  used 1/4 C butter and 1/4 C vegetable oil instead of 1/2 C butter and reduced the sugar to 1/3 C.  Also, added a sprinkling of sliced almonds to the topping.  To prevent sticking, lined the pan with parchment paper and took the advice of one reviewer to warm the jelly up in the microwave (about 20 seconds) so it would be easy to drizzle onto the crust.  Next time, I will try a different flavored jelly and reduce the butter further.  I will definitely make this again!

I absolutely love these! The recipe works wonderfully with both seed and seedless jam. I only gave this 4 stars because using aluminum foil to line thr bottom of the pan was a horrible idea. I throughly greased the foil, and I still ended up with the dough horribly sticking to it.

These were very tasty. I used 1/3 cup sugar and subbed another 1/4 jam. They came out jam-heavy, so next time I would stick to 3/4 jam, and keep sugar 1/3. The jam, especially if it's only made of fruit and sugar, gives the bar sufficient sweetness.

These are moist and delicious! I think those (few) who gave these a low rating must have cooked them too long, or spread them too thin. They weren't actually brown when we took them out, just a tiny bit darker tan on the edges. We used homemade cranberry raspberry sauce, and they are superb!

I thought this amazing recipe was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My family went crazy over this recipe and my family now wants me to bake them for Christmas to give them out to all my neighbors. They are great for breakfast and desserts. As well as maybe a afternoon snack or an after school snack. They are sweet and a little salty. Even though they take a while to make they are worth it and are very easy to make and shape. To me it was kind of hard to put the jelly over the mixture of oats and other ingredients though. In my family's opinion, they think it is the best granola bars they have ever had compared to the regular store bought packaged granola bars. Everyone who likes raspberry jelly or jam and granola bars  would love this recipe and the outcome of it. AND I MEAN LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This recipe has made me baking crazy. I just love baking and baking this made love it even more than I have ever had.

Our family loved these.  I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry and added a little cinnamon to the crust mixture.  These were great even a day or two later.

I really liked the oatmeal crumble base and topping. The jam in the center was just so super sweet. I looked for the seedless type as suggested and only found smuckers simply fruit. To be honest, I found it too sweet even before using it here. The bars held together, the foil liner worked great, though, and this was very quick to make. ty

I'm sure this recipe is great,  but I made some modifications and mine didn't turn out well so here's what NOT to do. I doubled the recipe and like other reviewers I subbed applesauce for half the butter. In the end the cookie crust mixture was not crumbly but more like a paste. I was concerned it wouldn't cook completely but it did. However,   the flavor was bland. I even added a little extra sugar but it was still bland. The raspberry filling was very tasty. I added the zest of several lemons to the jam and it was delicious.  So I guess the moral of the story is to make two batches instead of trying to double when making substitutions.  I will try it again because it got so many great reviews.

Very good. Almost too much jam, making them gooey and hard to cut into bars, but they taste so good. Also made peanut butter bars to go with these. There is nothing better than peanut butter and jelly desserts!

I have made these with the traditional jam filling, with a fudge filling and tomorrow I am going to try lemon. The first time I made them they were great, the second time a bit crumbly. I think I will ensure my butter it the proper consistency first.

Good bars. No need to grease the pan - only the aluminum foil. Could stand a bit less sugar than the recipe calls for.

I made this for my Superbowl party yesterday and they were a hit! Had several requests for the recipe and was reminded of it several times so I wouldn't forget sending it to them. They were so easy to make. 

I did substitute the all-purpose flour with gluten free all purpose flour and gluten free rolled oats because I had some celiac sensitive guests. They LOVED them. Even those without the sensitivity enjoyed them.  This is now a staple in my recipe box.

[10-2-2013]: This is one of my husband's favorites. I use applesauce instead of butter, which drastically changes the texture, but it's still delicious. He's on a no cholesterol diet, so it works for us. I also add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the oat mixture. Scrumptious! [Update]: I still make this a lot, but I prefer it with strawberry jam. I also like to drizzle a thin powdered sugar cinnamon glaze over the tops while they are still warm in the pan.  Just enough sweetness to take it to the next level.

This recipe was fine.  Idiot-proof and tastes good, so I'd recommend it to someone still uncomfortable in a kitchen.  But I wasn't overly impressed.  I used fresh raspberries, so it wasn't an issue of jam choice.  They're just, meh, alright.

I made this yesterday, and my kids and I LOVE it! Now I didn't use raspberry jam because it was more expensive at my grocery store. So I chose a strawberry spread, the store brand at that (Kroger). So I imagine it may taste even better with Smuckers jams. But it was very simple to make. I followed the recipe as is and doubled it as suggested by other reviewers. Very nice recipe.

I doubled the recipe and added the egg and cinnamon then reduced the butter as per a previous suggestion and they were great. I think using homemade jam also adds to the flavour.

I've made this several times.  I'm not a fan of raspberries so I subbed the raspberry jam for my homemade strawberry jam or something else I have on hand and it's just as good.  It's quick and easy to make.  Next time I might consider what some other reviewers did and sub it for other ingredients to make them a little "healthier".

I just made these. I'm giving five stars because my two teenage daughters, my husband, and I LOVED these. My 7 & 8 year-old daughters and their two friends each took only one bite, and hated them. So, I guess I wouldn't consider these "kid-friendly"...at least here anyway:) They were REALLY easy, and made with ingredients that I always have. Very convenient, quick dessert. Served with vanilla ice cream while they were still warm. thirty-eight minutes was perfect and my oven is pretty accurate. I will definitely make these again:)

Our families favorite bar recipe. We use a variety of fillings, one of our favorites is pear sauce with a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed in and butterscotch chips sprinkled over before covering with the top layer. Yum!

SO easy and SO yummy!  I've made them several times now, and everyone loved them at a recent potluck. I made them just as the recipe states, and followed other reviewers suggestion to make sure not to spread the jam all the way to the edge--leave about a 1/2 inch border so it doesn't leak out. I usually don't like raspberry jam because its kind of tart for my tastes, but the oatmeal cookie part totally mellows it out. I would give this recipe more stars if I could!

I used splenda instead of brown sugar and baked it in a 9-inch pie plate.  I also used blueberry jam instead of raspberry.  It was pretty easy to make and tasted good so I'll probably make it again.

I have made this numerous times and don't let the few amount of pantry staple ingredients fool you into thinking this is a bland and boring dessert!  Its my "go to" potluck dish and everyone RAVES how good it is!!   I even have the recipe memorized!  I double the recipe, add a TBL of cinnamon to the flour/oatmeal mixture, and heavily grease the 9X13 pan instead of using foil. Also, I prefer strawberry jam, but any flavor would be nice.  I have also added some white chocolate chips on top, and some chopped almonds.  I really love this recipe since its not very expensive to make, and the ingredients are always in the pantry.  TRY IT!!

This is a great base recipe. I have a freezer full of berries, so instead of using raspberry jam, I added a quarter cup of sugar to two cups of berries and about a teaspoon of lemon juice and cooked them down until thick. I also mashed the berries as they cooked and added just a tad of corn starch to help it set. BUT, the cookie part was perfect as written. I loved them and my husband would not stop saying how much he loved them. Thanks!

these are great, though a little crumbly for me. Next time I will add some mashed banana in the flour mix to keep it together and maybe a layer of peanut butter over the jelly! but even though they were crumbly, it was still delicious. just like the kind you buy at a nice cafe.

So simple and so versatile. I had about a cup of homemade cranberry sauce to use up, I used it instead of jam and it was really good. I let them cool completely and topped each square with a dollop of whipped cream. I've also made this recipe with homemade pumpkin butter(got the recipe off this site) and it was equally delicious.

Made this tonight exactly according to recipe except I didn't have raspberry on hand so I used homemade pear butter... I didn't measure it and I don't think I used enough because it definitely could have used at least twice as much fruit... but the flavor of the crust was amazing!  Basically just like the crisp part of an apple crisp on top and bottom.  Heavenly.  Crumbly though so next time I could see adding an egg or waiting until it cools all the way to eat.

Very tasty but I used part applesauce and part butter and mine wasn't crispy.  Oh, how I wish they were crispy.  Also, mine came out thicker than those in the photo for some odd reason.

I made these for a bake sale fundraiser, they were a huge hit.  Everyone who tried them came back for more.  The few that were left were fought over by my friends and family helping with the bake sale.  I did make one change.  I combined red and black raspberry jam together and added a little more then the recipe called for.

I will definately make these again!!

I give this 5 stars because this is the easiest thing to make and I always have these ingredients on hand.  I love this recipe!  I didn't have raspberry jam so I used apricot instead, which I enjoy anyway.  It was a nice mild flavor, great with my coffee this morning.  I'm bringing these to a playdate today.  I needed something easy and something I didn't have to go to the store because it's 110 degrees out and I don't want to run around.  Anyway, I'm very happy with how these turned out!

This was easy to make and pretty tasty.  The crust has an almost nutty flavor.  I used blueberry jam.  Next time I would increase to at least one cup, the jam layer is too thin.  They kept well and were still yummy several days later.

We made this gluten free by using Bob's Red Mill all purpose baking flour and gf old fashioned rolled oats.  Turned out fabulous according to our gf daughter and the four gluten-eaters in the family.  We will be doubling it next time!

I don't know if I can properly put into words how much my family loves this!  We use all different kinds of preserves, depending on our cravings, and they are all wonderful!  Thank you for such a simple and delicious recipe!

Thought it was a really great basic recipe! I switched out comparable stuff (whole wheat pastry flour for AP flour, sugar + molasses instead of brown sugar, etc), but really love the basic recipe structure. :)

Delicious!!!!! Although I use fresh, frozen raspberries that I've thickened and sweetened on the stove instead of jam. These bars deserve a 5 + star!

These were super good. The fact that the recipe was easy to memorize was a double bonus. I put everything into my food processor. It chopped up the oats which I loved. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. I also used strawberry preserves, since I did not have raspberry. Such a great recipe and so easy to change. Will try another reviewer's suggestion of using some applesauce in place of some oil. I feel this may be my new granola bar base.

My kids loved this when I made it the other day.  Like most people, I discovered I should have doubled the batch and made a larger dish.  I did add some crisp rice cereal about 1/2cup which went well.  I think next time I think I am going to substitute some wheat germ to make it a little healthier.  My kids are excited at the possibility of trying different flavor jellies.  They have already requested grape for the next batch.

Made these this past weekend and they were a hit! I did add some cinnamon and a small amount of dark choc chips. I baked mine for 45 mins (9x9) in a foil lined pan. They were delicious.

Absolutely delicious, and SO easy! The only changes I made (and it really wouldn't make a big difference, it was just a preference) was I added a few grated pecans and sprinkled some flax seeds on top before I baked them. I unintentionally melted the butter while meaning to just soften it in the microwave, but it was no problem. I will try this with other jams as well. Can't wait to serve these to my boys in the morning. They would be good warm with some vanilla ice cream, I'll bet! A total keeper!

These are delicious & very simple to make! I had all the ingredients except the jam already on hand, so a bonus for also being cost effective! I added a dash of cinnamon to the crust and some fresh lemon zest to the jam. I brought them to a neighborhood BBQ & they were a big hit with both the kids & adults. It's a keeper for sure, I'll be making these for years to come. Thanks MARBALET!

I really liked these bars.  I typed in raspberries and oatmeal and this recipe came up.  I had a container of fresh raspberries that needed to be used up, so I chopped them and replaced the preserves with the chopped fresh berries.  The bars have that tart raspberry flavor and they were really moist.

It's baking right now, but I'd love to know if anyone has made it without lining the pan with aluminum foil.  I am afraid of crumching on the foil when the bars are cut.

My sons ball team LOVED these. I followed another persons suggestion and tossed some chocolate chips in before putting the topping on. It was perfect.

I added an additional 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup chopped nuts, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  They are excellent!  I will definitely double the recipe next time I make them.

These just didn't pack a lot of flavor to me.  My parents like them fine, but my husband and I just weren't wowed by the flavor.

This came out so good! I made some few changes just to be on the healthier side; i sub the butter for coconut oil, I use half wheat and half unbleached all purpose flour, i cut back on the sugar and use strawberry because that was what i had on hand and it came out so good.

This is a simple, yet yummy cookie bar recipe. It's different from anything I've baked before, but it was tasty! I modified the recipe a bit, following the suggestion of another reviewer to make it slightly more healthy. I doubled the recipe to make it in a 9x13. I used 1 stick of butter and for the other stick, I replaced it with 1/4c of applesauce and 1 egg like someone else said. Since I didn't try it the original way, I can't say it was better or different. I'm sure the original recipe would probably taste a bit more buttery and the bottom may have been a bit more crunchy. And I only put 1c of the raspberry jam. Overall, it was still good. I'd try it again with a different kind of jam. :)

These bars are great to have as a party treat when having guests over. They are very rich, so cut them into small squares. They were delicious with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top. I also tried these with cherry preserves and they were still awesome!

This recipe was simple, quick, and very easy, so I highly recommend it if you're looking for something fast and delicious. However, I found that there wasn't enough of the oat mixture to cover the bottom AND the top. Next time, I'll double the recipe for the oat mixture.

I also used a mix of half raspberry jam and half apricot. Yum!

These were so easy to make and absolutely delicious! I did use "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" to cut down on some calories, but it still tasted great. I wonder if you could use any flavor jam for this recipe? I'm wondering about strawberry. Definitely delicious!

These are wonderful, I doubled the recipe as it wouldn't last past afterschool snack in my home. The only change I did, is instead of raspberry jam, I used homemade apple butter, and added cinnamon to the oatmeal....wonderful wonderful!!

Excellent recipe for Vegan Mazurka-like bar, minus the eggs yolk!  I substituted 1C home made blackberry jam (w/seeds ;-D) and sprinkled raw sugar on top for a wonderful end of summer treat!  Served best w/creme fresh or vanilla ice cream.

Very tasty, but a bit sweet. I did use Wildberry jam instead of raspberry though, so maybe that made it sweeter then it needed to be. I will defiantly be making these again, the kids love them.

I didn't follow to a T. but this is making me rate it with stars to put in comments.  I am choosing 3 because it has potential if dryness can be overcome. I'm thinkning it will be hard though since the filling is jelly and not fresh fruit.  COATING : Doubled crumb coating recipe exactly (had too much for top layer, but put most on)....STILL TOO DRY.  Bottom feels too thick and creates dryness in mouth.  PS...I hand blended in butter well,  and used amt stated in recipe...so that isn't it. EXTRA FILLING : tried that  (abt 2 and 1/4 cup with doubled recipe as it looked good eyeballing it in 9X13). Filling tasty but overpowered by dry bottom layer.  LAST SUGGESTION: (wasn't able to try this yet) Try thinner bottom crust (watch cooking time if you do) and just crumb cover top of jelly evenly using minimum for full coverage (don't use it all).  If it is still TOO dry, stick with fresh fruit crisp recipes as the fruit juice released during baking will solve this problem.

First off, the jam is really hard to spread, so this is not an easy recipe to make.  Second, they are WAY too sweet (and I'm a sugar fanatic!). My kids said they tasted like granola bars, so we sliced them in rectangular shapes.  Would not make them again, but it was fun to try.

I am very pleased with the simplicity of this recipe. My fiancee, mother and I all really enjoyed these cookies. I only had strawberry jam so I used that in a pinch, but I am going to use raspberry for sure next time. My Fiancee thought they might be bland because there were so few ingredients, but he couldnt get over how much he liked them and quickly gobbled them up. I can't wait to make these again!

I made these with an added egg to the crust/crumble mixture. I needed them to hold together well as bars, so I added the egg. It worked great. I also used strawberry preserves. Next time I will add some white or reg. chocolate chips, if I'm using a very sweet fruit mixture. I think the strawberry would have benefitted from a dash of lemon juice. The raspberry probably has plenty of "tang." I will make these again, varying the filling.

Wow. I had an unopened bottle of jam lying in the house for a while, since I really don't like jam much. But WOW. This was amazing! My whole family loved it, I will be making this again. Thanks =)

delicious.  can't stop eating them.  Next time I think I'll add more of the jam though.  They are exactly what I had been hoping for in an oatmeal bar and this will become a staple for my cookie recipes.

These cookie bars were delicious and very easy to make. I made them dairy free by using vegan margarine in place of the butter. I only had about a half cup of blood orange black cherry jam but it was plenty. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Easy and tasty recipe - I might try it with blackberry jam next time. I didn't have any tin foil on hand, so I was worried that I might have some trouble getting it out, but I used the baking spray that has flour in it and had no issues with the bars sticking.

These are truly fantastic!  I made a few batches to bring to a village FD party. So many people totally enjoyed these. People I didn't know had ask for the recipe.  I told them I found it on allrecipe.com. Thanks for a great cookie bar recipe!

Not bad. I wouldn't make this if you were trying to impress someone, but it is pretty good and easy. I used 1/2 unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 margarine in the place of butter. It probably could have done with less of both because I had to add more of other ingredients after. It was really chewy after baking though, which I like. I sprinkled chocolate chips on top too.

I would give these a 4.5 star rating for taste, but I bump it up to 5 because of the simplicity. I always have these items in my kitchen so it will be a great go to dessert. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the cookie part and might add a little more next time. I also think it would be great with other preserves - I'll probably try blackberry or blueberry next time. Yummy.

This is not a great dessert, unless you are craving jelly oatmeal bars for some reason.  It is just ok.  Would much rather have other cookies.

We thought this was very good. I didn't have raspberry jam so I used strawberry preserves and it turned out great. You could substitute just about any kind of preserves or jam with this recipe and I think it would always turn out great!

Use lots of pam or butter on the bottom of the pan, because the oatmeal can be a bit of a pain to release from the bottom.  Absolutely delicious and a real hit!

I honestly didn't like these all that much. The rest of my family really enjoyed them, but I just thought the jam made it way too sweet. And the granola-y part was too crumbly and just came apart when you tried to eat it. I would suggest more liquid to hold it together.

Absolutely delicious! I used mixed berry jam because that was what I had on hand and I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon (next time I'll double the amount) to the oat mixture, which really elevated the taste to a new level. I also added 1/4 cup of finely chopped almonds and an additional 1/4 cup of oats to the topping. The result was amazing! Best oatmeal bars I've ever tasted! This is definitely a keep!

OH MY! These are truly heaven sent:)They are sweet, but with a little tang, yum yum.They are ever so soft and delish.now I am a chocolate lover so I added a little coco powder & icing sugar to the dry crumbs. Then after I put the can of cranberry sauce layered I drizzled honey over it. then the rest of the crumbs.PERFECT! OH but DO NOT bake it more than 20min or it's not so soft. one thing i wish I could change would be the edges getting a little harder then the rest, but still a wonderfuly delish recipe!

This was my first attempted at a jam-filled dessert. I am so glad I read the reviews first, because microwaving the jam made it so much easier to spread! I kept the recipe the same, except decreased the sugar a little bit and used whole wheat flour. It turned out really good, and looks very nice, too! I'll be making these again for sure!

Made recipe exactly but used strawberry homemade jam because that was what I had on hand and whole wheat flour. I thought they were good but not amazing. I will make these again but would change the jam just because I prefer raspberry. I think it would be great for a treat for lunches and they are easy to store. Mine have stayed fresh and soft and it is day 4.

very easy to make.  A bit dry, but I didn't use a whole cup of butter either.  Push down the crust so it doesn't crumble (yum) and double the jam.

I made this cookie without reading the reviews  so I followed the recipe exactly and I loved the it. We ate them all in one days-four of us. Next time I might try some of the suggestions but the recipe stands on its own. Would be proud to take this cookie to a cookie exchange. I didn't have seedless jam..only change.

Very very delicious bars. I followed the recipe as directed for the "bar" portion, and will so in the future - it was great, moist enough on the bottom and crisp and buttery on the top. Not crumbly for me at all, when I form a crumbly mix with butter I use my (clean) hand and sqeeze fistfuls together which I then sift through with my fingers until fine crumbles form and there is virtually no powder from the dry ingredients left in the bowl - it may take some time, but the dough doesn't crumble. I used almost double the jam portion as suggested by another reviewer and thought it might have been a little too much, though my boyfriend loved it: next time I make these I'll probably use a cup. These were in the oven in five minutes and the family LOVED them, thank you so much for sharing!

These are *really* tasty! The only thing I will change next time is to double up on the jam, it just wasn't enough for me. Love the taste and texture of the crust. Thanks :)

Really good - even better with chocolate chips sprinkled over the top before baking (but I'm one of those people who thinks everything is better with chocolate!)

A very great bar recipe. Exactly what I was looking for. I did double the recipe though because they are so addicting they disappear almost instantly with my family and friends!

I have a similar recipe using a yellow cake mix, so I was thrilled to discover this tastes identical (I don't always have the cake mix on hand when I want it!)  I've made the bars with any kind of jam... apricot, peach, raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, you name it.  Always taste yummy!

Really good. My 10 yr old made them for us. We used our homemade raspberry jelly. A little crumbly, but we did add ground flax to the mix.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. I've made these many times now. No alterations needed... they are just perfect! So delicious. :) I think next time I may add some crushed walnuts to the top layer.

First time I have made filled oatmeal bars and very glad I did. Only changes that I made were: Used whole wheat flour. Added some cranberries with a tad of vanilla that I pureed along with the raspberry jam. I did double the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. Came out beautifully from the pan. Delish and will make again.

Pretty good.  Made them for my sister's tea party bridal shower last year.  Double the raspberry jam in the middle though.  There was hardly any in there and you couldn't really taste raspberry.

Delicious!  I made this recipe with strawberry preserves instead of raspberry and sprinkled cinnamon on top prior to baking.  It was wonderful.  I also shortened the baking time to about 25 minutes. Quick, easy and delicious.  I will definitely make again.

I love this recipe. I have not only used raspberry jam but have made it with peanut butter and many other fillings. The kids favorite is marshmellow fluff and mini chocolate chips to make smores cookie.

Wow, this is such a great recipe I've made it three times since I discovered it this week.  I first made it for a potluck at work and everyone didn't believe me they were homemade bc they tasted too good.  This is definitely in my recipe book as a quick, easy and impressive dessert.

These were very good, buttery and rich. I used seedless marion berry preserves and doubled the recipe, using approximately 14 oz of preserves.

I had just gone Raspberry picking so used fresh instead of preserves.  I increased the brown sugar in the crumbles to compensate for the lack of sugar since using fresh raspberries.  My friends and family loved them.

This was a great basic cookie bar recipe, though crumbly and messy to eat.  I used leftover pumpkin butter instead of fruit jam and added 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice to the cookie mixture. Made my kitchen smell like autumn!

I doubled the recipe, but found it too sweet with the full amount of jelly called for.  If I make this again, I will noticeably reduce the quantity of jell so that it's not so sweet.  I drizzled chocolate over half the pan and found that that way too sweet.

YUM! Tastes like pie crust! I used sour cherry jam and doubled the recipe for 9x12 pan (which required much longer cooking time). Next time I think I'll use a tad less salt.

Well, I am so sorry to rate this low, but this just wasn't our thing.  I guess we prefer real fruit desserts.  The cookie part was pretty good, but I should have been leary when I saw it uses a jar of jam.  It literally tasted like, well, biting into a jar of jam.  I may try the cookie part with fresh raspberries partially crushed or something.  We served these when company came over and no one took seconds or said anything about them.  I think they felt the same way.  Sorry... :~/

I took these bars to a friends house for dinner and 4 of us demolished the entire batch. They were such a hit! I followed the recipe to a T except for using strawberry jam because it's what I had on hand. I tried the white chocolate drizzled on top, it was a nice addition but the bars can certainly stand alone in flavor, next time I probably won't go through the trouble.

Good. I warmed up the jelly for 20 secs in the microwave. Added 1t cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture. Make sure the butter is softened. Thanks.

This is a great recipe! I did not find a need to use foil, just grease it! These bars are super easy to make, and everyone loves them! I make them all the time!

Easy to make and good too!  I added a tsp. of cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture and sprinkled some mini chocolate chips over the raspberry jam.

I did not line with foil.  Doubled the recipe and used a 13x9.  The jam spilled over the upper oatmeal mixture and the middle looked more like a puddle.  I am not sure what I did wrong.

WONDERFUL!  I have searched for a recipe for these bars and tried many.  This is the one that turns out just like the bars my husband loves at a local business that sells them for $2.99 a single bar.

Not bad, but it's pretty crumbly. Mine took much less time to bake.. only about 25mins. I reduced jam to 1/2 cup, as 3/4 seemed too much.. Plus, this recipe for crumbles serves as a nice streusel recipe as well!

So simple and yummy! I just threw all the crumble ingredients into the food processor for a few pulses.  Total prep maybe took 5 minutes. I used strawberry all-fruit type preserves just due to preference.

Ok, I really liked the taste of these, they certainly were very good. They would be even better with cinnamon mixed in. However, mine turned out pretty crumbly, although that might be due to the fact that I doubled the recipe. Doubling it also made them brown unevenly (although it might be my oven). The ends were too dry, but the middle was perfect (yet it still fell apart easily). My butter was very soft while mixing, and that helped make the mixing easier. Perhaps this affected how crumbly they were...I'll probably one day make these again, and hopefully they will be even better!

Definately easy and pretty good. If you want to keep the crust from seeming too dry use your hands to mix it.

Delicious! Reminds me of a fruit crisp. This would be wonderful warmed up with ice cream on top! Only changes I made to the recipe was to add a dash of cinnamon, and I used boysenberry preserves as that was all I had. Excellent with coffee too!

Cons: Lacking burst of flavor

Overall: Pretty good if you need to throw something together quickly.

Good way to use up a lot of jelly. I used half whole wheat flour (next time don't do this). I used apple sauce for half of the butter.

Pretty good. I didn't have flour so I used wholegrain flour and it turned out ok it seems. Better microwaved than cold IMO.

Really, this is a 3.5 star. I don't know, it didn't turn out the way I was expecting after reading all the reviews. It was almost more of a crumble rather than a bar because it wouldn't hold together. Maybe I should have melted the butter to make a more solid crust? Flavor was good, but I think I should have added a touch of cinnamon.

The whole family loved this recipe! I even made it out of all natural ingredients: whole wheat flour, natural sugar and all-fruit preserves. I added milled flaxseed to the dry ingredients. And it was excellent! A good replacement for nutrigrain bars for my kids

My little brother and my mom could not get enough of these when I made them!  They were gone ten minutes after I set them out!  Everything was the perfect amount, it had the right texture, and definitely the right taste!  I will definitely be making these again!

I made these with strawberry jelly because that's what I had. They were really good, but I think rasberry would be even better. They were also very easy to make. Everyone I shared them with enjoyed them.

I think these taste better the next day. They're super easy to make. I didn't use seedless raspberry jam and they were just fine. They're really tasty and not too rich--perfect for breakfast!

I thought these were a little too dry.  Easy to put together.  I heated the preserves in the microwave for a few seconds which made it easier to spread.  Any kind of filling can be used in this recipe.

I wasn't a big fan of these.  Using a bit less of the jam would of helped, as the raspberry was a bit overwhelming.  But I probably won't try these again.

These are absolutely delicious! They are so so so so so good... I didn't have enough batter to make the whole pan for some reason.  I had to go ahead and add an additional half of all of the ingredients to my mix.  That just means more yumminess! Thanks for the unbelievable recipe!

This was pretty good, except it felt like it was missing something (maybe chocolate drizzle or vanillan ice cream?). I had a few people say that real raspberries would have been better; but overall I got a really good response for these! Will make again (making sure to double batch).

These bars are wonderful!  I stuck to the recipe exactly (and used real butter).  I doubled it and used a 9" X 13" pan and they were perfect.  My husband loved them and has requested the same recipe using blueberry jam, which I think will be great.  This is a very rich and tasty cookie.

Very good raspberry cookie bar recipe!  I added a small amount of applesauce to the recipe to make sure they wouldn't get dry, and baked them in a glass 13x9 pan (doubled recipe).  They turned out great!  I will make again.

OMG!! These are quite the treat. Yummmmmy. I followed the recipe, with the exception that I took the suggestion of another reviewer and softened the butter instead of melting it. It seemed to do the trick with preventing it from crumbling. I will definately be making this again and again. Thank you!

These were good, not dry or crumbly at all.  I think the key to them not being crumbly is to make sure to press the crust into the pan really firmly. I used a non-stick 13x9 pan (doubled recipe) and sprayed with cooking spray, and had no problems with sticking. I cut them while still warm with a pizza cutter (my new favorite trick ;) I do think next time I'll use more jam, it seemed to kind of get lost in all the bottom/top crust.

These are really tasty! Only thing is I used strawberry perserves instead of raspberry, just for my personal taste. I was a bit confused about how much crumb topping should have been left to top it off. I said to use 2 cups for the bottom part, which I did, but had barely any left for the topping. I will most definitly make again, especially around Christmastime, but I will double the recipe.

Wow, what a yummy & easy treat! I actually had all the ingredients on-hand (which NEVER happens!) I added cinnamon as other reviewers suggested and used rasberry 'Double fruit Reduced sugar' jam. I even  added some chocolate chips on half of the pan of to see what it would taste like. Both sides were delicious!! Plan on making more today with blueberry jam. I would like to make this recipe even MORE healthy, but am not good at straying from the recipe. I fear disaster without exact mesurements!

This recipe is so wonderful! I was short on bron sugar, so instead I substituted 3/4 cup of sugar and a 1/4 cup of honey. I also had used whole wheat flour. My Family thinks so great, it's half gone and not even cool yet!

These are absolutely divine beyond belief...I've made them a few times now, and wouldn't change a thing. They've been devoured within a few hours by my housemates every single time, and I've even had a request to make them as refreshment for a riding competition on Wed.

Fantastic recipe! Very easy to make, but make sure that the jam is at room temperature or it's difficult to spread. A homemade version of Nutrigrain bars (only better!)...they're great as dessert OR breakfast.

I love these and you can use any kind of jam....The cookie part is a bit crumbly maybe more butter would help that...Otherwise very good...

I thought this was great.  I'm not really a cookie bar fan just because I don't eat too many sweets but I had some oats to get rid of so I tried it.  I wouldn't change anything about the recipe.  It's great the way it is.

These were delicious and so easy to make!  This definitely needs to be mixed by hand to get the crumble texture.  These would go great with a warm cup of coffee!

Very easy recipe, I used white whole wheat flour instead of plain white, and subbed out the butter to Smart Balance, no hydrogenated oils for me! I stuck to the 32 minute baking time, they turned out great!  Has anyone tried Kiwi Jam yet?

These are terrific.  I did make one pretty major change which was to use a couple of cups of a black raspberry/
dark cherry mixture cooked with sugar and cornstarch instead of the jam.  Yum!

This was a very good bar.  We don't usually like rasberry but the seedless worked well with the oats.  I was pleased that the bars cut easily and didn't break when you picked them up.  I will make these again

Mmmm! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used 1 recipe to fill a 9x13 inch pan, which made the bars thinner but chewy and amazing! I also only used 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2. Was almost going to dump the pan because I thought they smelled burnt but they are wonderful and golden!

I didn't like this recipe.  The bars fell apart and the flavor lacked something.  I've made another recipe on this site which is much better.

These were pretty tasty.  They were really easy to put together and you could easily change the flavor by using different jams or preserves.  I agree with another reviewer that they were just a little too sweet...and I almost never say that about a dessert!  I think next time I might try this with blueberry preserves.

The title for this recipe is accurate...DELICIOUS!  And I love the fact that there are so few ingredients to produce such a great result.  I, too, used lemon juice instead of water and a jar of my mom's homemade freezer jam!  I will use this recipe again for sure!

I doubled this recipe using 1 cup of spelt flour and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and drizzled white and dark chocolate over top as the only changes. I also didn't quite have enough jam, but it worked well enough.
I would make these again......

Definately delicious! I didn't even do the whole stick of butter-I used about 3/4 of the stick. Didn't have enough raspberry jam so I used brambleberry or someother kind. They were both great. I think you could used just about any kind of jam. I drizzled melted white chocolate on some of them. Both ways were great!

I found this bar to be somewhat dry. Make sure you add the bulk of the crumble underneath the jam or else there will be too much crumble on the top and it will fall apart. If you use a bit more butter it makes it so it sticks together better. For the jam, make sure you use a really good, chunky, raspberry jam. It tastes a little too artificial otherwise.

Not as good as I'd hoped. Makes a good breakfast cookie, not too sweet.

I used cheap grape jelly and I also melted the butter and mixed with my hands, I added 1 tsp vanilla and sprinkled some cinnamon in as well. I also used 1/2 cup regular oats and 1 pkg instant cinnamon roll oatmeal. Turned out great, very easy and yummy. Thanks for sharing.

I made two different kind of Raspberry oatmeal bars this weekend (see my other reviews), these were definetly not the best.  I found them to be really dry, and lacking flavor.  I think if there is a next time, I would add more butter as they were super crumbly and difficult to eat.

I made these for a Christmas party, and they were delicious.  I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the oat mixture, and used Smucker's seedless raspberry jam.  They were sweet, but very yummy.

These were great!  A very easy, delicious old-fashioned recipe. Versatile too,  I substituted cherry preserves, and I think it would be good with any flavor of jam.  They were plenty sweet, I think next time I would try using a little less jam, or else will try a lower sugar jam.  This would be a wonderful cookie to make with your children, as it is easy and "fun", you can mix the oatmeal mixture with your hands.

These were ok.  Took them to a BBQ but didn't get many raves.  All I could taste was the raspberry jam.  If I were to make these again I would add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping.

This is a good, easy dessert.  I took the following advice of other reviewers: 1.  greased the pan and omitted the foil altogether; 2. doubled the recipe (using a 9 X 13 pan); 3. added a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon; and 4. used Smuckers 100% Fruit.  I made it for a picnic and everybody seemed to really enjoy it.  Thanks.

I thought these bars were pretty good.  I baked them in a metal pan, and they came out pretty dark.  I think if I make them again, I will bake them in a glass baking pan.  They got a little too dark on the bottom.

Awesome recipe. I used Strawberry Jam and it turned out great. I doubled the recipe and ended up with extra topping so I made another third of the whole thing and ended up with a total of 1-9x13 and 1-8x8.

5 stars plus!  have made several times and received stellar compliments.  i used seedless black raspberry (vs. red raspberry) for a more intense, sweet flavor.  i also used butter pam and reynolds release non stick foil to line pan.  No sticking problems whatsoever.  Excellent recipe.

I really enjoyed these (as did the ladies I shared them with.) I'll be curious to try other fruit flavors, as raspberry isn't my absolute favorite. Easy to have ingred. on hand, so I'm sure I'll be making these a lot -thanks!

These were great! My 2 year old loved them! I didn't have raspberry preserves, so I used a low sugar strawberry jam that I had on hand. I will make sure to have raspberry preserves next time I make them, as that's one of my favorite flavors. Thanks for the great recipe!

cookies are ok.  I'd add vanilla to the shortbread to flavor it...  Didn't have very much jam, so I added almonds, coconut and condensed milk to the middle.  White chocolate chips would've made a good addition too!

I made this dessert for an office Christmas party, and it was an absolute hit!  Very delicious, not sickeningly sweet, and everybody loved it.  This would also be a great ice cream topping if you crumbled it up.  Yum!

Very good, but too much jam.  All I could taste was raspberry.  I'm also one of those people who likes the crust from a pie best, so maybe it's just my own personal taste.  I'll make them again but will use less jam filling.

I work with college students and made this almost every week last semester!  I took some into the YMCA and the staff loved them too!  I use a larger pan to bake them in, but other than that, I think they are perfect.

These turned out wonderful! I altered it a bit as recommended in some of the previous reviews. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan and added a bit of cinnamon. Raspberry jelly was not on hand as I thought when I started but blackberry preserves filled in nicely. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

MMMM!  I topped the bars with chunky granola instead of the oat mixture and the top was delightfully golden and had an excellent texture and flavor!!  Almost too easy...

These are real easy to make once agin my husband devoured them I found them too sweet I think its because of the jam I used because that was to part I really didnt care for.  I used a seedless strawberry jam, next time I will use raspberry.  Yhe oatmeal part of it is delicious.

Deliciously fantastically quick!
I ate 2 as soon as the batch cooled! Maybe a more appropriate name would be Raspberry Crumble bars! Try pouring a bit of cream on it - scrumptious!
Thank you for a lifetime recipe I think!
