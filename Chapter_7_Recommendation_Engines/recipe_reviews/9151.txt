I started to make this recipe because it sounded good, but then, as I was making it, I realized it wasn't quite right.  The ingredients call for 1 1/2 cups water, but the directions call for 1 cup water and 1/2 cup pineapple juice.  I didn't have the pineapple juice, since it wasn't listed in the ingredients, I didn't buy it. I tried draining my canned pineapple juice, but didn't get anywhere near 1/2 a cup.  I called a friend who makes a similar salad.  She says hers calls for 3 cups of liquid.  This one has 2.  I decided to add the 3 just to be safe.  Also, this recipe asks for the pineapple to be cooked.  I decided not too, since it was neither fresh, nor frozen, I figured it wouldn't interfere with the jello setting up.  It was a good recipe, once I had it figured out, but I'm glad I didn't just dive into it or ask one of the kids to do it or it may have not turned out well.

I followed the recipe with the added ingredient of the 1/2 cup pineapple juice.  Didn't cook the pinapple either as it was a can. Everyone liked how it was NOT THAT SWEET (great for serving with a meal). I wishied it was sweeter as I served it as a dessert. Pretty, festive, and I think for more than 9 servings. Will make again.

If done right, this is a good recipe. There is absolutely no need to cook canned pineapple. For the water, use 1 cup and then add 1/2 cup pineapple juice. You can get that from the can of drained pineapple or from a regular can of pineapple juice. I've made this recipe for many years. It's delicious also with canned pears added or canned pears alone.

Since I can remember growing up this has always been a favorite at holiday dinners.  My Aunt was always in charge of bringing it but when she passed away no one knew how to make it.  I have searched and tried many this was the closest.  The only thing I do differently is I drain the pineapple first.  This is how I get my half cup of pineapple juice.  Also after the Jell-O has set a little I whip the Jell-O also it makes it creamier.  I blend the cream cheese and pineapple together before adding to the Jell-O and we do not add any nuts.  I am so glad I found this recipe.  Thank You SHECOOKS2   Also total liquid should be 2 cups so 1 1/2 cups boiling water and 1/2 cup pineapple juice.

I've been making this recipe for as long as I can remember.  I got it from my grandma, and streamlined it by "blenderizing" it rather than just mashing the pears.  SO yummy, smooth and refreshing.  It has become just as important as Green Bean cassrole & Candied Yams on our Thanksgiving table.

This a very tasty dish, and my family often requests it. I don't add the whipping cream-- too much fat. It's just fine without it-- maybe a little tangier.

I tried this recipe because I'm a sucker for jello recipes!!! This one is pretty good. Note that you should drain the canned pineapple to extract the juice...if you don't have enough, add water to meet the measurement. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why we needed to cook the pineapple (I did it anyway)...I thought that maybe it helped bring out the sugar? But then I figured it's probably because a long time ago they used fresh pineapple instead of canned...aw well, anyone's guess. Loved making my own whipping cream for it. I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 because I love this recipe with pears and pear juice instead of pineapple...it's 100x better!!! Though this one is still very good. Also, I mixed in the cream cheese and pineapple w/my mixer into the jello...makes everything more creamy. Thank you!!!

This is a great recipe - it makes a lot!  I used sugar free jello and it came out great.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.   It was suggested to use cool whip instead of whipping cream.  Next time I will try that - to lighten it up a bit. Although it is sinfully delicious as is.  I will make this salad for the next potluck or cook out.

Simple dish that everyone loves.  We always double the recipe, and it always gets eaten.  We generally   have it with special occasion dinners because it's so popular.
