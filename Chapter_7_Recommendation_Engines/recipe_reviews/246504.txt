Loved, Loved, Loved this recipe!  The creaminess of the ricotta, crunch of the coconut and almonds, and sweetness of the blueberries and honey worked perfectly together.  I would eat this for dessert!

Loved it!  The honey adds the perfect amount of sweetness.  I tossed the shaved coconut with the almonds and threw in some oats for a little more substance.  Tasty treat.

Wow!  this was nice!  I didn't have the coconut milk and I wasn't about to run out to the store (I live out in the country) and buy some for just 1 T., so I used the almond milk I already had on hand.  Don't know how it could have tasted any better.  Thanks Lexus Oliver for a healthy, delightful recipe!

Delicious! I used part-skim ricotta, so this made a great light breakfast. Also, I used sliced almond b/c that's all I had on hand. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious and simple to make. 

I use coconut water instead of coconut milk. Sometimes I just use regular milk and a few drops of coconut flavour extract .

There's lots of other fruit combinations that work with this:
Strawberries Banana (considering swapping almonds for pistachios); 
Pineapple (considering swapping almonds for pistachios); 
Blackberries;  
Mango (consider swapping almonds for cashews);
 Passionfruit  (consider swapping almonds for cashews);
 Strawberries and Banana;

This recipe is straight from heaven! I wondered if instead of blueberries and almonds you could change things up sometimes n try different nuts n fruits. Pecans and cranberries! That's what's great about all recipes they're inspirations.

Loved It.  I used part-skim ricotta to save some calories.
Honey was just the right amount of sweetness.  This
will definitely be on my breakfast menu.

Not really to my liking, more into granola/yogurt/fruit, but wanted to try something new.

7.25.17  This was a nice change from my morning yogurt, and I really liked the honey drizzle on the part-skim ricotta that I used.  Recipe calls for you to top this with 1/2 cup of blueberries and that would be too much for such a small portion unless you mix the berries into the ricotta.  Whatever suits you, I just sprinkled some over the top.

I also used part-skim milk ricotta and the outcome was still delicious.

A fantastic healthy breakfast or snack! I substituted cashew milk and omitted the coconut flakes. I also used sliced strawberries instead of blueberries.

What a wonderful, filling breakfast.  I used cashew milk instead of coconut and followed recipe.  This could even be a dessert, it's so good.  Loved it!

Absolutely delicious Summer breakfast! Definitely filling and satisfying while still feeling fairly light and healthy. Love the fact that it is so different from our normal breakfast selections.
 We sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top, per my 5 year old daughter's request.  Highly recommended and will definitely be making again! Thanks!
