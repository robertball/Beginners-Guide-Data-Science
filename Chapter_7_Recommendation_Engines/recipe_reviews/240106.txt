I had to make something nut, dairy and egg free and I was looking for chocolate. Like wow these turned out really well with my edits! I changed milk and butter to almond milk and dairy free Earth balance butter and subbed apple sauce for the egg, and I used the 1 for 1 Bob's Red Mill baking flour with the xantham added already, and skipped the peacans but added dry cherries soaked in hot water and drained, then added 1/2 cup coca powder unsweetened due to all the other sweetness! I followed the rest of the recipe and these turned out decedent! I would encourage everyone else to try these!!!!!!!

I liked these mini cakes. I made them into mini muffins because the title threw me off. Once I had read that this recipe yields 12 muffins I realised they are supposed to be regular sized muffins, but they were good anyway. As for the flour mentioned in the recipe, according to the Bob's Red Mill site, that particular flour blend is NOT gluten free, but containing whole wheat flour. I used a gluten free blend from this website (Best All-Purpose Gluten-Free Flour Blend by pho1962) and thought they were more sponge-like than cake, but still delicious. I left out the xanthan gum. I used the option of pecans and am glad I did as they gave a nice texture to the muffin as well as taste. Thank you BrightBritain for your recipe.

Loved this recipe, made a few changes to it but it turned out so well! I used Pillsbury All Purpose Gluten Free Flour which bakes super well. I also added chocolate chips. Two notes: I needed to bake the muffins for 5-10 minutes longer than what the recipe called for, also the gluten free flour doesnâ€™t rise as much as regular flour so I put double the amount of mixture into each muffin pan!

I think these would have turned out better if I had baked them longer.

My daughter was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease so we're playing with different gluten free recipes.  This one is definitely a winner!!!  I made this as gluten free pancakes.  OMG!!  These were the best pancakes I have ever tasted!!
I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose gluten free flour (that way you don't have to add the xanthum gum since it's already in there!)  I had to increase the milk to a little more than the ingredient's 1/2 cup, to achieve the desired consistency.  For dry ingredients I only used the 1 1/2 c flour & cinnamon...no need to add any extra sugar.  These are already sweet enough.  We didn't add the nuts because go figure, they had gluten in them. 
We added fresh blueberries to half the batch as well...yummy!!
It yields 20-24 medium size pancakes.

These are amazing! The only change I made was to use milled flax seed in place of the zanthan gum. My kids ate them right up and my coworkers loved them!

Was very easy to make. However, there was no coffee mentioned in the ingredient list or the recipe. Didn't put any coffee in a looks just fine, but not brown. :|

This recipe is easy to follow and the nutmeg makes my house smell delicious! I used gluten free basic baking mix, baked a little longer and results great! I'm new to the gluten free lifestyle but this recipe is definitely a keeper.
