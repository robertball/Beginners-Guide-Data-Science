This was so simple! The no one would suspect the sauce to be from a jar.  It tasted like it cooked all day on the stove.  The sauce  was rich, thick and had such depth to it; and it only had the onion and peppers added to it.   The Italian sausage was perfect with this dish although, I do think that chicken breasts would be delicious too.

The polenta was so creamy and velvety and with the added parmesan, it was truly delicious!  

I highly recommend this recipe :-)   I will be making this one again and again.
