A really fun take on the traditional mint julep! I was wary of the lemon juice addition, but it's actually a nice touch. It lightens the drink up just right to make the flavor what you want in a blended cocktail. I found about 25 ice cubes made it the right consistency. (I made at least three blenders-full of this stuff for a derby day get together - I had it down to a science!) Thank you for a great recipe!
