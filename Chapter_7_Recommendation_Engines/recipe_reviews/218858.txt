this dish is extra easy to make...I made this dish today for my family and my step daughter and husband really enjoyed it. Instead of fresh garlic I used minced garlic in the jar and I also cut up and added a tomatoe. I also added garlic powder, season salt, accent and italian seasoning to the sauce to give it more flavor. DELISH!

Very easy and very good! It takes no time at all to put this together for a quick weeknight meal. So, even if you're short on time you can have a nice dinner without a lot of fuss. All I had to add was a nice garden salad and garlic breadsticks!

I threw in some sliced onion and fresh sliced mushrooms when I sauteed the red peppers. I sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese over each serving. Very simple, family inhaled it. Paired with a tossed salad and garlic bread, this makes a quick and filling meal.

I did make some changes but it IS Rigatoni a la You, so I felt it was okay :)  I used whole wheat bowtie pasta simply because I had some left over and I can't find whole wheat rigatoni at my normal store.  I used the Johnsonville chicken Italian sausage (a favorite in our house) and added some squash, zucchini, and mushrooms to the veggies.  I had them in the house and thought, "Why not?"  I added some crumbled feta on top, but my husband dusted his with parmesan.  Both were really good!  I used plain tomato sauce seasoned at home with dried basil, oregano, and parsley.  This dish was quick enough for a weeknight meal but good enough that I served it to a dinner guest (on a weeknight - ha.)  Nice little recipe to have in the arsenal for last-minute dinners.

Very easy to make and yet another Johnsonville recipe that my kids devoured. I didn't change a thing other than to use hot sausage.

My family loves it when there is sausage in each bite they take. So, I crumbled up the sausage and fried it in a pan. I added red and green pepper to give the dish a bit more color. I went pantry shopping and used penne instead of rigatoni. My husband said this recipe is a keeper!

I used yellow bell peppers instead of rad and I substituted the parsley for basil instead.  Basil is one of my favorite herbs.  My family loved this recipe.  It was a big hit.
