So delicious!! I couldn't find vital wheat gluten, so I omitted it, but it turned out great anyway. I also added more water in the kneading process. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

One detail:  If you've had breast cancer that was estrogen-receptor positive, you should avoid flax seed and flax meal.  Either leave them out, or add more of the other seeds.

This is great bread! I had to make some omissions based on what I had handy (no sesame, sunflower seeds or coconut oil. I tossed in some wheat germ instead - otherwise followed the recipe except for the shape...I got 6 sandwich rolls and 1 large bunny loaf out of this. Thanks for the recipe!

Let me preface this by saying I am just starting to bake bread.  It is very difficult to find a recipe with 100% whole wheat.  The only modification I made to this recipe was to add an additional 4 Tbls water as I could not get my dough to form without. I just pulled it out of the oven and my husband and I both enjoyed a slice.  Great flavor and not too dense.  Next time I am going to try using just vitamin C and omit at least some of the wheat gluten.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe for healthy bread!

This was my first time attempting bread and it came out great!  I didn't have the flax seeds (added a bit extra flax seed meal) or the coconut oil (substituted toasted sesame oil) and needed to add a bit more water to get the dough to form. Tried to use my kitchenaid mixer but ended up just making it smoke -- so did all kneading by hand.  I didn't knead for full times because I got tired, but it still came out great.   The bread was a big hit and now I'm going to use it for french toast.

The bread was tasty and good for sandwiches but the flour / water content was off. I used more water and approximately 5 1/2 c flour.

The bread turned out beautiful.  I did have to use 2 cups of water  instead of 1/34.  Also when you cover it, don't put saran wrap on it, it will stick. It was so good.  I will make it again.

I kept trying this recipe based on the great reviews and still had a hard time getting it right, UNTIL I used the wet ingredients first and then slowly added my flour until my dough was the consistency I wanted. This worked like a charm every time. If I added the dry ingredients first and then added the wet, I would get a different result each time. Doing the wet ingredients first was a no-fail way to make sure my dough was exactly how I wanted it. Now I have happy bread :)

** I need to note here that I use a Kitchenaid mixer for my kneading with the dough hook.

should have read the reviews first, but the water/flour ratio is off.  I am somewhat new at bread and kept thinking that I was not doing something right, but it was the ratios.

This was pretty good - very dry though and very hard to kneed. Not sure I would make it again.

Great for a 100% whole grain recipe. I halved it and did it in my bread machine on the wheat cycle at 1.5 lb loaf. Instead of all the extra stuff I just did flax. It's so fluffy, like store bought, but healthy!

I've been making 100% whole wheat for a while and have been searching for a good recipe, and I found it here. The missing ingredient for me was the wheat gluten. It makes it nice and fluffy. Other reviewers say they have left this out, I think you're missing it if you do. 

Yes, it needs more water! Probably could safely start w/ 2c. Also, feel free to not skimp on the flax seeds and such. From experience, I knew 1 tablespoon wasn't near enough for this size (2 loaves). I went w/ 2 heaping tablespoons of the oats, flax, sesame, and quinoa.. and it's not enough in my opinion. If you like those things in your bread, then I'd say 2 tablespoons is a starting point. I'm starting with 3T of each of those next time.

I use my bread machine to mix dough. Depending on your bread machine size, you may have probs doing this size of a batch. It was overflowing on me a little.. just had to keep an eye on it. 

The 2T of coconut oil can be substituted with any kind of shortening. I use olive oil. Did I mention to not skip out on the wheat gluten? (I recommend a non-GMO brand and non-GMO whole wheat).

This is a keeper.. I bake bread every few weeks.. This turned out great.

Made it yesterday in my bread machine.  I cut flour, vital gluten,  honey and salt in half. I use olive oil since I had no coconut oil, the amount called for. I doubled up on the flax meal since I had not flax seeds. I did not use sunflower seeds since I didn't have them either.  I used 1 1/2 cup of water. The rest of the ingredients I used as indicated.  I placed the ingredients in my bread machine in the order called for my machine, and mixed on dough cycle.  Remove and rolled out and cut into 3" rounds as I usually do for my bread rolls. Let rise for 1 hour and baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.
My husband likes his bread in these small rolls.  They were wonderful. The taste was very good. Texture was soft, thanks to the gluten and added water.  I will make it again since is it a very healthy bread. Sorry about all the adjustments but I can't knead dough anymore; my hands are too weak. Thanks for the invention of the bread machine we enjoy fresh bread every week.

Super good!  I've made it a couple times, everytime without the wheat gluten, but its still great.  

Like all bread recipes, you may have to adjust the flour and water amounts as you begin to knead.  I've had to add an extra half cup of water each time.

Overall, surprisingly tasty, filling, and protein packed.

Very good bread.  Tasty and and nice texture.  The recipe called for 1 3/4 cups of water.  I was only able  to get 4 cups of flour mix in so next time I'll use 2 3/4 cups of water.  Vital Wheat Gluten was found at Vitamin Cottage (health food store).  My weinerdog really likes it. I almost gave out early on the 25 minutes of kneading but in the end it's worth it.  The bread is nice and spongy.  Cuts easily without falling apart.  I was a little doubtful about putting the instant yeast on top of the honey water mixture as most people recommend that you add the instant yeast in with the flour but the bread definitely doubled on both rises so I guess that debunks that myth.  I'm eating it right now and I'll be making it regularly from now on.  Thanks for the recipe.  I love it.

Very tasty and hearty bread.  I didn't have coconut oil or flax seed meal  but used substitutes and worked well.  It doesn't last as long as store bought so it needs to be eaten.  Freezing a loaf should work also.

The taste was great, but there was only one leavening ingredient in this recipe. In the future I will add an egg or two to help the bread rise enough to get the soft texture I desire.  I did add more water, and will continue to do so.  I also recommend substituting a tablespoon or two of mashed potato flakes for some of the ingredients you may not have.  I love adding potato flakes to my breads! This bread can recipe can also be used to make a good cheesy bread or rosemary bread.  With just one batch, I made two regular loaves, a rosemary loaf, and a cheddar/Monterey jack loaf.

I ommited the seeds, coconut oil, and gluten. So basically I just used wheat flour, honey, yeast, water, and salt. Such a great recipe. My first attempt at making homemade bread and everything went great. Definitely a keeper!

Forgot to add to my review that I added 3-4 T of coconut milk to the dough when kneeding it- the mixture was pretty dry and hard to work with.

Not making it again. The measurement s were off...not just for water but every thing. Also I felt that dough was not enough good three loaves and too much for two loaves. Mine turned out quite dense. I make breads a lot. My search for a goood wheat bread is still on.

I have now made this recipe three times and really like it. I added additional grains and decreased flour a bit to compensate. I also brushed with egg white and coated the outside with grains.

Experienced baker. Tried recipe 3 times and each was a total flop. Stay away. Also tried to post a review. This is the third time to try to post a review. If this one doesn’t work, I may avoid the app as well.

Great multi-grain bread recipe! I used what grains I had on hand (whole wheat flour, a little white flour, rolled oats, quick oats, and extra quinoa), added a little extra honey, and a little molasses. I also took other reviewers suggestion about using 2 cups of liquid---I used 1 cup warm water, and 1 cup warmed milk. I also used butter instead of coconut oil. Instead of shaping the dough into loaves after the first rise, I divided it into 10 round rolls and placed 5 each into two 9-inch cake pans. Let those rise, brushed the tops with an egg wash, and put some rolled oats on top (just for looks lol), and baked them at 350 for about 28 minutes. With making 10 rolls, they ended up being about the size of hamburger buns--which was perfect since I made them to go with some homemade sloppy joes for dinner. Thank you for the recipe, I look forward to making this again!

Great texture once I added an extra cup of water.  We're on a low-sodium diet, so I also reduced the salt and yeast by half--produced nice loaves with a hearty flavor and excellent crumb,

Wouldn't rise.  Even left it overnight. Used fresh yeast.  Brick like with bitter taste.

Super delicious bread. I bake a lot, but really never made bread until very recently. I have a Zojirushi bread maker which I've been using for the kneading most of the time, but it was in use, so I kneaded this in my Kitchenaid Mixer. It turned out perfect. Only issue was finding Vital Wheat Gluten.  I went to a few stores with no luck, before I could find it, and I live in Dallas. I guess the whole anti-gluten movement has caused sales to wane and many stores have stopped stocking it. I finally found it at Central Market (HEB owned). Glad I did, because apparently it really helps keep wheat breads from being so dense. I followed the recipe and have since been using coconut oil in all my breads. The nuts and seeds were a great addition. I will be making this again this week, but in a round bread dish, because I prefer eating it with my meals or as toast, rather than sandwich bread. Delish!

I just made this using fresh milled flour in my nutrimill. I used hard white winter wheat berries. I didn't have any of the added grains but it was still delicious! To cut out fat I added 2 TBS of non-gmo lecithin granules instead of coconut oil. I also had to increase the water by 1 cup. I used half my dough for rolls and the other half for cinnamon rolls, a healthier version that is still delicious!

Came out a little too dense for my taste but I will make it again and let it rise a little longer. Other than that it was very flavorful and healthy!
