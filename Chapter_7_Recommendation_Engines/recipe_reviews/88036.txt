I needed a new recipe to use an abundance of fresh mangoes. After reading all previous reviews, I made my own adjustments. Instead of chicken thighs, I used chicken breast tenderloins. I tossed the frozen tenderloins with the spice mix and let them thaw in the mixture, then let them chill in the mixture all day. Because we only eat whole grains, I substituted brown jasmine rice. ( Remember, brown rice takes longer to cook) I also skipped the water & I mixed in the entire can of coconut milk. I followed step three (reserving the mango) except that I put the mixture in a large stove top pan with a snug lid. After bringing to a boil, I simmered the rice mixture for 35 minutes. I then added the chicken tenderloins & mango to the mixture. Covered it again & cooked about 15 minutes more. This was very tasty and I liked not having to have my oven on. Next time I will serve with chopped peanuts & more fresh mango as a garnish. This is a keeper.

I loved the flavors of this dish and the chicken was wonderfully moist, but what did I do wrong?  By the time this came out of the oven, the rice was soupy and very over-cooked.  I will make this again, but next time I will HALF the chicken seasoning/marinade and add some water to it so it is a rub or paste; as the recipe is, there is WAY too much seasoning for the chicken.  Next time, I will skip adding the water, and I will mix the coconut milk into the rice.  This has very good potential!  Thanks Toronto Mommy, aye?

I used jasmine rice (uncooked) and instead of mango I used 1/2 cup of orange juice. Turned out awesome! the only thing I will "tweak" next time is to add more spice to heat it up

This tasted great.  I think the recipe is supposed to read "2 Cups UNCOOKED rice" - this is what I did, and it turned out perfectly.  I prepared everything the night before, marinating the chicken serperately and then keeping the mango, onions and seasonings in a seperate bowl.  Then in the morning I sprayed the mango mixture in TWO greased 9 x 13 pans (I followed the recipe exactly except did 12-14 thighs), poured the uncooked rice evenly over that (1 C in each dish)layed the chicken over it all, and poured half the liquid over one dish, the rest over the other making sure all the rice was submerged.  Next time I might try using more lime juice, or maybe some zest.  Took it to a church "international potluck" and got rave reviews!  Thanks!

This was a good base recipe but a little overpowering. I'd suggest cutting the spice mixture for the chicken in half and adding a little oil or water to make a rub. I loved the flavor of the rice, but I think that next time I will cook the rice separately (adjusting liquid for type of rice and under cooking by 5 min), add the remaining rice ingrediants with a splash more lime juice, and then finish in the oven.

This recipe seems to have potential, but it fell short of flavor.  It did smell good, but the curry flavor as well as the mango was weak.  The rice was slightly mushy. My whole family was excited to try, but they all gave it a thumbs down.

I reduced the amount of Water for the rice to a half cup, and the rice came out sticky but not soupy. This recipe was good, but very spicy. If you don't like too much spice, add the pinch of red pepper flakes to the chicken, but leave the rice alone. This does take a lot of time to prepare, so make things ahead, or start early!

This recipe is amazing!!! I can't say more. I followed exactly and it was wonderful. The kids liked it too!!  Thanks Toronto Mommy. Definately worth the time and effort. PS....make sure the mangos are ripe or use canned. he unriped one will leave your rice a bit bitter.

I was unhappy with this recipe.  Perhaps my hopes were too high because of all the great reviews and the exotic ingredients.  I agreed with all the people that said that the rice didn't come out good; I didn't agree with their high ratings.  The flavor was fine but it was certainly more work that it was worth and I wouldn't bother making it again even without the rice.  I stumbled upon it by searching for Carribean recipes and I have to say that the Carribean Spiced Roast Chicken recipe is a much better investment of time for a Carribean taste with its rum and lime basting sauce.

Takes a long time to prepare and then cook, so plan half a day ahead.

Very spicy - I ended up cooking an extra 1c. white rice (uncooked) to help balance the curry flavor.  I made it without the mango - didn't have any.  Perhaps that would have tamed the curry flavor a bit.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the rice to be a little on the soupy side (next time I'll increase amt of rice), but overall it was still delicious!  The chicken was tender and very flavorful, and my dinner guests were very impressed!  I will definitely make this again.

Very good! Using chicken thighs is a must!  I too used the whole can of coconut milk and just a little of the broth. 
I put the chicken in a baggy with the seasonings over night which made prep the next day go very quick. I will be making this again.

I found this recipe to be delicious! I only had time to "marinate" the chicken for about 45 minutes, so I cut it into smaller chunks so the spices could cover more surface area. I left out the red pepper flakes thinking my kids would eat this dish, but the curry itself was a little too spicy for them. Now I wish I would have included them for my own sake! 

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons. One, the flavor was a smidge underdeveloped... Maybe a little more lime and just a bit more salt for the chicken. And two, the rice was mushy around the edges and a little underdone in the middle. I'm not sure what would remedy this... Longer cooking at a lower temperature? Shorter cooking at a higher temperature? Even still, the texture of the rice isn't so bad--especially if you stir it up before eating--just not perfect. I will definitely make this again, even if I can't get the rice perfect.

I was short on time, so I did not marinade the chicken; however, I did season the chicken before combining. I had breasts on hand, so I cubed them and mixed in. The rice came out lacking in flavor, and the chicken was dry. 400 is way too high. Think I will try the slow cooker next time or cook the chicken in the sauce on a lower temp and make the rice separately.
