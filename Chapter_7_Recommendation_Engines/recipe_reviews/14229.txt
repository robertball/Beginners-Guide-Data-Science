I really enjoyed this receipe.  It was fast, easy, and extremely flavorful.  I also tried a variation by exchanging the lemon juice with red wine vinegar.  This receipe holds up well in the fridge for about 10 days.

This recipe is very good.  It tastes as it should I think.  I usually added more parsley because I like it that way but otherwise I followed the recipe as is. Make sure you chop the parsley by hand and do not use the food processor or it may be to watery.

The burgul is too much and the parsley is way less than in the conventional tabbouleh recipe. Tabbouleh is thought of as a parsely salad, not a burgul salad. I have substituted 1 cup burgul for 0.25 cup and 1 cup parsely for 2.5 cups, and ommitted the cucumber which is a non traditional addition.

Tabouli is one of my favorite side dishes. I have always made it without mint, just because I didn't have it on hand and it is wonderful. I have't tried it with the green onions suggested here, usually just a little yellow onion chopped super fine, or just left it out. I don't squeeze fresh lemons either, though I'm going to try that way next. Every way I have tried tabouli (except a prepackaged mix- not the same at all)it is always good. I have also found it is a conversation starter at pot-lucks because few people can recognize the main ingredient, thought it looks very colorful and appealing.

Boiling the bulgur is not necessary. Just put an amount of dry bulgur in a bowl and add the same amount of water and let it sit for 30 or so minutes - no cooking necessary. While the bulgar sits soaking in the water I chop up all my other ingredients, which for me is cucumber, tomato (the outside edge, not the juicy fleshy inside part), red or yellow onion, and LOTS of parsley. The mint can be overwhelming so I don't add it. I also add a lot of salt and put much more lemon juice than olive oil, but that's because I prefer the lemon taste. Great basic recipe, though!

This salad is great, I love it.  It is easy, fast and vegan.  I especially like the crunchiness of the cucumbers.  It would be good with water chestnuts too.

This turned out well even though I made a couple of mistakes.  It was the first time I'd made bulgur and after letting it soak I felt that it was too soupy.  But I just added more bulgur and it soaked up the extra water.  I also may have added too many green onions and they were a bit overpowering.  But it was easy to make and tasted very authentic.  I will definitely make it again.

I made a variation of this and it is GREAT!  I substituted quinoa, to make it gluten free.  I made the quinoa according to the package, but changed out 1/4 cup of lemon juice for 1/4 cup of water.  I used the tomatoes, parsley, green onoin, cucumber, and added feta cheese.  Since quinoa is a good protein this can be a really healthy, light meal.

for me without trying the recipe and as i grow up making this dish every week at my home, pls allow me to say that this is not Tabbouleh, the main ingredient in tabbouleh is the parsley, you can put for example 3 cups of chopped parsley with 2 tbsp of bulgur, one chopped tomato and nooo cucumber in it.

Really fresh tasting. To be picky, I'd say there's maybe a touch too much oil, and not quite enough mint. The cucumber is a nice addition. I'd definitely make this again.

Excellent per recipe.  I would not change anything.  Just need it to rest in fridge for at least 1 or 2 hours and adjust seasoning per your taste.

This salad is astoundingly good. The onions, parsley and lemons dominate the flavor so much, that the mint doesn't come through. Next time I will maybe cut back on the onions or increase the mint. I didn't have bulgur so I used whole spelt berries that I soaked overnight and boiled for an hour. I like the texture they provide.

My gosh, tabouleh in general is just awesome. Be sure to use fresh herbs- theyre the best. Add the tomatoes just before serving to avoid putting them in the fridge- they get all mealy and gross. Also, for the health consious, I put about a cup of this stuff in a sun dried tomato tortilla and it was awesome!

I really enjoyed this one! I had only had tabbouleh outside of home and I liked it, but found that it was "missing something" for me--this recipe made it all that I wanted it to be.  I liked it by itself and tucked into a warm pita.

I needed a dish to furnish for a last minute party.  I did not have any bulgur so I substituted orzo pasta.  My gosh, I had to force myself to stop tasting it.  I was not sure about the mint but put it in anyway.  It was the ingredient that pulled all the flavors together to make a great dish.  Cudos to you for a great dish that I will continue to make for a very long time.

When I left Michigan, the one thing I really missed was having all the Middle Eastern delis around. I really grew to love the food while I was there, and tabbouleh is one of my favorites. I made this salad and tasted a couple hour later and thought it didn't taste right. Luckily I made it a day ahead of time, and by the next day it tasted perfect! This recipe is great exactly as written!

Absolutely delicious!  I substituted 2 Tbsp pickle juice for 2 Tbsp of the lemon juice (you still get the acidity from the vinegar, plus some salt and a lovely garlic taste).  The pickle juice also complements the cucumbers really well, since they're both related.  Delish!  I might try using quinoa instead of bulgur for a variation sometime.  Our local natural food store sells a quinoa version that is to die for! *** Update:  I also tried this with red bell pepper instead of tomato.  The pepper gives a nice crunch, the flavor is terrific, and it doesn't tend to get watery like tomato does.  I'll probably use the red pepper from now on.

Very Good.  The recipe made too much for my family, will cut the recipe in half next time.  But if I was going to bring this to a pot luck it would be perfect.

This was very good and you feel good eating it because it is just so darn HEALTHY!!!!!! Vitamin C from the parsley and tomatoes, fibre from the bulgur wheat, omega somethings from the olive oil, etc. The only thing I would do differently would be to cut the onion WAY back - I love onion but I found the quantity really overpowering.

This was excellent and so easy!  I added two more tomatoes since I live by the theory, 'the more tomatoes, the merrier'.  It turned out so merry, I thought it was Christmas in my kitchen :)  Thanks so much for such a great tabbouleh recipe.

I used a boxed couscous as I could not find Bulgur in my small town. I also had to use dried mint and had to go to four grocery stores before I found that. But, it was really yummy. I left off the green onion because my kids don't like onion.

Delicious, fresh, colorful, and so filling. Cooked the bulgur wheat (red mill brand) according to package directions. Seeded the cucumbers. Fresh squeezed lemon. Did not seed plum tomatoes. Did not use parsley, and it tasted just fine. I was afraid the mint would taste bad, but it was great! I can't wait to make this for friends and my floor (I am an RA).

I just made this recipe, my first time ever for tabbouleh. I did cut the extra virgin olive oil to 1/4 cup, and I might try even less next time to reduce the calories. I also did not add the mint. The salad came out delicious, and it looked very pretty in one of my grandmother's glass dishes from the depression era. I had recently read about how parsley is so good for the health, and I wanted a recipe that featured parsley. I am very pleased with the results. I also loved the ease of preparing the bulgar. I might try the recipe and substitute quinoa so my friends with gluten allergies can enjoy it, too. I used bottled lemon juice, but I will try it again with fresh lemon juice next time.

Fantastic!!  Have also used couscous as I had no bulgar.  Have added a handful of olives (I didn't have cucumber)  Always get asked to bring this dish to functions.

This tastes very good!  I made a few changes because I didn't want to go out and get what I missed in my pantry (no time to shop):  I replaced the cucumber with a green pepper.  I didn't have enough parsley so I complemented with dill and cilantro.  I didn't have fresh mint so I just broke a mint tea bag over the salad.  The result was absolutely fresh tasting and delicious!  Next time I'll buy my bulgur ground a bit coarser, I think it would be better than what I had.  This was for a potluck and I brought mini pitas to eat with the tabbouleh--great success! Thank you, this is a keeper!

Very tasty and as even better the next day. I'd would reduce the olive oil quantity the next time. I didn't de-seed or peel the cucumbers. Just chopped them up. Healthy side dish or salad. Served with Shish Tawook from this site.

I work as a server in a lebanese restaurant and this was almost as good as ours!

They won't give me the recipe, it's a trade secret so I used this one I found on-line and was pleased enough that I will use it for the base of experimenting until I get the exact taste I am looking for.

I served this with grilled spicy lamb burgers from this site and it made an excellent side dish. Might take another reviewers advice next time though and not add the tomatoes until just before serving to keep them firmer. Thanks.

Loved it as is!  We used parsley and mint from our garden, plus the tomatoes and cucumbers.  Perfect way to use them!  We doubled the recipe, which made a bit too much for us so we brought some to my mom who also loved it.   So good in the summer- very fresh and much better than any store-bought/restaurant  tabouleh I've ever had.   We made this last month and are making it again today!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Didn't boil bulgar, just poured boiling water over, covered and made the salad that evening .  The bulgar absorbed all the liquid so I didn't have to drain, dexture was perfect.  I added 1/4 tsp. powdered garlic , 1 serrano cored/deseeded chile , 1/4 c more parsley, wonderful.  Will never buy store bought again.

I made this for a family reunion and all the adults loved it! (The kids avoided it like the plague.) I did reduce the lemon just a bit and added a pinch of sugar to cut the tartness of the lemon. I also added some yellow cherry tomatoes for color. This a great recipe especially for large gatherings since it tastes better if made the night before. It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful!

Delightful and tasty!  I liked the fact the cooking water is less for the bulgar, which makes it fluffier.  I doubled the parsley, mint; added garlic and serrano; used less oil.  Thanks, Jen!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  I leave the seeds in the cucumber as I am too lazy to remove them.  I also substitute a finely chopped onion for the green onions as I usually don't have green onions on hand. I like this salad because it tastes refreshing and is healthy and filling.

This tabbouleh would have been good if it weren't so oily.  I found it quite oily in comparison to what I would get in a good Lebanese restaurant.

I make this all the time. I don't much like the mint, but cilantro is great.

I thought this was a good recipe. My husband is always looking for "better" salad, as in more flavor. We eat bulgar often so this salad had lots of welcoming flavors to us. It had very strong flavors so I am still unsure as to what to serve it with but I now use the lemon and oil dressing on romain salads too. The texture is the only thing that gets some getting used to. The parsley is very different but good.

First time making tabbouleh!! I made this with quinoa and it turned out great.   I think next time I will use finely chopped red onion for a stronger onion taste in each bite. Also, I  will chop my tomatoes in smaller pieces than I did the first time. I think it will be perfect next time I make it.

There was slightly too much mint, but the green onion was overwhelming. I only put in half of the called for green onion, but it dominated every bite and left a strong after taste that did not blend well with other parts of the meal. 

Cut way back on the green onion and a little less mint and it would be quite nice.

I added a bit of finely minced garlic and cut the oil in half. I am a celiac, so I used quinoa instead of bulgur and with my mods it turned out really well-nearly as good as my Lebanese friends!

This was excellent. I added about 1/2 cup red onion for an extra kick.

This is outstanding, but I sort of made it my own.  I didn't have scallions, so I diced up a small vidalia onion instead.  Then I added the zest of 1 lemon to the mix in addition to the lemon juice.  FInally I sprinkled in some crunchy sea salt to cut through the lemon and it was just delicious. I couldn't wait the hour to eat it!

This is very good.  I would recommend decreasing the lemon juice just a bit, though.  It was slightly sour for my taste.

I wasn't very happy with the outcome of this recipe. The taste was bland and it was very watery even after I drained the bulgur. I don't know if I'd make it again.

Very good and fresh, but not a whole lot different from what you can purchase at the deli.
