These turned out quite well for me. I ran my oats through the blender using the ice-crushing feature, until the oats turned into a course almost flour consistancy. I used half whole wheat flour in place of half of the AP flour (because I was using oats AND some whole wheat flour, I did add a quarter cup more milk, as I've found that you just need a little more liquid when you use whole wheat flour), soured milk instead of regular milk, melted butter instead of oil and pecans instead of walnuts (we aren't a fan of walnuts). I also added a little spice--one half teaspoon of cinnamon and one half teaspoon of nutmeg. Because I've worked with oats in baking before, I knew to let the batter sit for a few minutes before spooning it into the muffin tins. I baked mine at 350 for 20 minutes. These turned out chewy with the right amount of sweetness and quite yummy. My kids loved them. I think next time I make these, I'll try this recipe with chopped apples in place of the raisins and add a teaspoon of apple pie spice. I think I'd cut the fat a bit and replace a little of the oil/butter called for in this recipe with applesauce.

Excellent Recipe.  I added 1/3 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup coconut, and 1/2 cup raisins. Baked exactly 18 minutes.  Delicious.

I just got done making and serving these for brunch. They were very good! I read a few reviews that complained about dryness, so I added an extra splash of milk and an extra splash of oil. Perfect baking time for me was 17 minutes. I did not add the raisins or nuts, but I did add a couple shakes of cinnamon. I was a tad easy on the 1/4 cup of honey, because after pouring the batter into the muffin liners, I put a thin slice of butter and a drizzle of honey on top of each muffin before baking. I may experiment by adding a splash of orange extract to the recipe next time.

this is a very hearty, tasty muffin.  A great breakfast muffin, and one that my picky eater, 7 year old daughter, likes.

These were wonderful.  I skipped the walnuts and raisins for texture reasons and added a splash each of almond extract and orange extract.  I also sprinkled some oatmeal on the tops for looks.  The bake time was exact.  400 for 18 minutes.  I'll definitely make these again!

Delicous and moist with blueberries, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 cup of blueberries, 1T extra of milk and reduced salt (1/2 tsp). I pre-heated my oven to 350 then turned it up to 400 after inserting the muffin pan.  Also, I allowed muffins to cool in the pan after baking for 16 minutes.  The outcome was moist, tasty muffins that my whole family loved.  When we made them again with raisins instead of blueberries (other substitutes constant) the taste was great when fresh but a bit dry once cooled.

Excellent recipe - soft, sweet and easy to make.  Added just a tiny bit more milk (maybe an 1/8 cup) to ensure oats are well soaked.  Made to take camping so will freeze and see what happens!  Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be quite bland. My husband agreed. They turned out well as far as looks go, but they will only taste good with some jam on top.

I thought these were a little dry, maybe because I used wheat flour instead of white.  Maybe next time I'll do half white half wheat.  I also substituted chopped dates for raisins and pecans for the walnuts.  I made a crumb topping with oats, chopped pecans and a little brown sugar.  I made one pan of mini muffins and one regular... The mini muffins got burnt!  I think for mini muffins maybe adjust the temp down a little.

Made them exactly as per the recipe, without raisins or nuts.  I wanted to taste the basic flavour before adding anything.  I find the flavour mild but delicious and smooth, and I will make these again for sure.  Super simple and delish, can't ask for more than that....

i just took these out of the oven, and for some reason, i found out that 400 was too high.  the tops were overdone.  however, i turned the oven down to 325 with 3 minutes left from the original 15 and they came out pretty well.  next time i will cook at a lower temp and keep a close eye on them.  also, i added extra milk, choc chips and raisins.

I made these muffins for a tech rehearsal and everyone liked them. I didn't add the raisins, I only put in the walnuts. some of them I put walnuts and chocolate chips. I added a tiny bit more milk to keep them from getting dry, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. I'll make them again with apples, I think.
