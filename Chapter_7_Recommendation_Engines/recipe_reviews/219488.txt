A hit! I'm not the biggest fish fan and have nothing but praise for this easy recipe. I cooked this tonight using Panko crumbs to which I added Italian seasoning. Everything else was per the recipe. All of the spices blended beautifully, and even though I used liberal pinches of red pepper, it wasn't at all hot. It was just nicely seasoned, perfectly cooked and wonderfully crunchy. A definite winner, I'll make this spice blend part of my regular fish rotation. Thanks, crabbyjean!  Update: I've made this many times now, and have found that letting the fish rest for an hour in the fridge makes the coating stick even better. I make a big batch of the coating mix using gluten free panko crumbs, Italian seasoning and all the spices so I always have it handy. It's great for coating chicken, too. BTW - I now love fish!

Today I tried this recipe and it was good. I did not have the roasted onions flakes, so I substituted with Mrs. Dash onion and herb seasoning, I also added 1tsp of parsley flakes. I the place the fish in the egg and milk mixture in a Tupperware bowl with a top and put in the refrigerator for 45 min. Then I put the dry ingredients in a plastic gallon size bag and put the fish in it and slightly shake the bag. I place the fish in a pan (spray pan with Pam) and drizzle the lemon and butter over it. Place pan in the refrigerator for 1 hour and place in oven for 35min on 325 or until golden brown. It was so tasty. This is going to be one of my favorite recipe for my favorite fish Tilapia.

Very yummy! I followed the recipe exactly and will make this again. Next time I may try a little hot sauce in the egg and milk to spice the fish up even more. I used Haddock and it does cook very quickly. I chilled the coated fish for one hour prior to frying.

I made some changes....I used panko bread crumbs instead of the regular Italian bread crumbs.  I added the juice of one lemon to melted butter, drizzled it on top and baked it (as suggested by another reviewer)  It was awesome!

As written, the coating tends to flake off easily. try mixing the salt and pepper with 1/2 cup of flour and coat the fish in this, shake off excess before dipping in egg mixture, again let excess drip off, then coat with crumb mixture. Let rest for about 10 minutes before frying.

This was just excellent.  Never considered bread crumbs before, so this was a nice surprise.  The only changes I made was regular bread crumbs, but added in the classic Italian herbs and left out the red pepper flakes (I live with wimps) and it was lovely.

Can't imagine any light fish that this wouldn't work with very well.

Nice job and thanks for the imagination!

Have tried this recipe with pickerel and bass...all our store bought talapia comes from China and I don't think I need to tell you how they farm it...the recipe was good...instead of bread crumbs I put oats in a blender...great and more nutritious...

Great spicy taste for fish. Since we don't like tilapia, I used sole and it came out wonderful. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I drench the dish on some seasoned flour first so the egg mixture would stick more on the fish and do a double dip with the egg and bread crumbs. works beautifully. it also adds an extra crunch on the fish.

Easy and good.  Letting it set for an hour before cooking was a great suggestion.

I don't usually rate a recipe if I have to change anything, but I live in Africa so I had to make some substitutions.  Also, I let it sit in the frig for 1 hour after breading as others had done.  This was an absolutely delicious way to fix our local fish here called lotte.

We loved this.  My husband caught some bass in the morning and we had it for dinner.  I used panko crumbs.  I think it's best fried pretty dark.

Very tasty.  I used garfish and fried some onions to garnish the fish.  Great with a light salad.

Faaaantastic!  I had a small dinner party and wasn't feeling the motivation (feeling more tired than anything) to make anything.  You know those nights?  I made this using cod fillets from Costco that I had defrosted and followed the recipe exactly.  Fillets in the egg wash, breaded, fridge for 15-20 mins then in the pan.  I am so pleased at how well it turned out - lots of compliments.  Whew!

I am not a big fish fan, but even I enjoyed this!  Followed the recipe as written except 1) didn't have roasted onion flakes so used dried minced onion instead and 2) put the spices in a Ziploc bag to coat fillets after dipping them in the milk mixture.  Usually my husband and I use cocktail sauce on our fish dishes, but this was so good, it didn't really need it!  Great recipe...thanks for posting!

Made this with cod fillets. Used Panko instead of bread crumbs and baked instead of fried - everything else as written. AWESOME!!  Wonderful flavor. I did put the breaded fillets in the fridge for about an hour (just long enough to get the rest of my dinner together) before baking.

I made this for my family just this week. They loved it. The hour in the fridge makes a huge difference when frying the fish. It actually stays on the fish rather than falling off when you flip the fish over. Not at all greasy either.

AWESOME!!!  Crispiest fish ever.  Definitely on my rotation.  Whole family loved it.  I used four large fillets and needed to add butter and oil while cooking.  Dredged fillets through cornstarch before the egg bath.  Chilled for 15 minutes.  Turned out perfect.

It was good.  My husband does not really like fish but this had enough flavor so it didn't taste fishy and he loves it.  Has already asked for it a 2nd time.

Needed a recipe that had things I already had in my kitchen pantry and this fit the bill. And it is delicious! Definitely good to add the crushed red pepper flakes but literally just a pinch is all you need. I don't like hot spicy foods and with just a pinch it didn't blow me away at all but gave a nice flavor. Keeper!

I made this a couple of nights ago and we're having the leftovers tonight. Both my husband and I really liked it. I did put some tabasco in with egg as another reviewer suggested and it added just a little zip. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I definitely make this often. Thanks crabby jean! Update! We reheated in the toaster oven and was as good as the first time.

I don't eat tilapia however this recipe is excellent with any white fish - flounder, red snapper, dover sole, etc.  
I do bake it in the oven as well.  Give it a try just not with tilapia.

LOVE THIS DISH!
Use fillet of flounder (wild) instead of tilapia (farm raised).  Delicious, everyone enjoyed.

Been using this (my mother-in-law's" recipe for decades), nothing new here except for the blackened & red flakes spices.  Using more garlic, onion (flakes or powder) doesn't overpower the fresh fish taste.
You can use only the egg white, forget the milk or use egg beaters instead of the whole egg for a healthier version.

I find flounder, Nothern Pike or any mild whitefish is the best!

This was good. I tasted the crumbs before breading the fish and decided to add a 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning. I also added a few dashes of hot sauce to the egg mixture. Overall I thought it was good but probably could have still used a bit more kick for my taste but then I'm a New Orleanian so this fish is probably perfect for the masses. My son and boyfriend loved it.  Adding it to the recipe box.

Amazing! The changes I made are that I used haddock, used 3 teaspoons of mayo instead of an egg, added a 1/4 cup of flour  to the pepper mix (to make it stick), used cornbread crumbs, and used onion powder and garlic powder instead of flakes and fresh garlic, but it still came out perfect! I'll definitely be making this again.

This is very flavorful, and from now on, this will be the recipe I turn to when breading fish.  I want to add that it would work for any other kind of white fish, not just tilapia.  Cod, sole, flounder or haddock would all be great with this.

This is the first time I’ve bread and my fish and cooked it like the directions said and it was really really good. Even the kids loved it. I added a few extra spices and fresh cilantro and any fresh herbs I had handy and it made the breading even better. I did a little lemon juice which always makes best taste better.  Sorry no pictures that went too fast. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I am not a big fan of fried food but this was very good.  I didn't have Old Bay blackened seasoning and just used regular Old Bay.  I didn't have onion flacks but I used onion powder.  Excellent flavor.  Will make again.

Pretty much followed the recipe....went the easier rout because my grocery store makes a spicy bread crumb mix ( hot peppers and all) so I just did the egg/milk wash then into the  spicy bread crumbs...fridge for the 15 min, followed by the cast iron griddle nice and hot, three min. per side, leaving me lovely char marks for presentation! Definitely will do again!!!

This was so good the first time, my family requested it again.  SO easy!  Refrigerating battered fish is key before cooking (I did it for 1 hour) & gives you time to prep your sides!  I made the creamy lime cilantro dressing for a salad & it ended up on the fish.  Good stuff!

This was an awesome recipe and I used halibut. I added corn flakes crumbs and a little more red pepper flakes, put all of the ingredients in a large zip lock bag and rolled the batter so was quite fine. Really enjoyed it thanks!

My family enjoyed the tilapia although it wasn't quite "kickin" enough for us. I recommend adding the spices directly to the fish while it's cooking in the pan. Gives it a good spicy flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used minced onion flakes as I couldn't find roasted onion flakes. My hubby really liked it. I breaded the fish in the morning and let it sit in the refrigerator so it was ready to cook when I got home. I grabbed the wrong pan and the filling stuck in spots. I will use my nonstick skillet next time! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

tilapia is a baking fish, not a frying fish.  its also a tank cleaning fish. I made this and threw it out after researching the fish. bass are raised in a tank, sold on market. tilapia are added to the same tank to clean the tank and then sold.  you do the math and keep this recipe.

I Made no changes except doubled the recipe.  I love seafood. My family not so much. However, everyone loved this fish and there were no leftovers. So next time I'm tripling! Delicious & flavorful without overpowering the taste of the fish.

Robert didn't care for it.  I thought it was good, but not that much flavour....had not added the red pepper flakes, though.  Maybe that would have helped.  Had baked it and the fish was very dry...maybe didn't put enough butter on it.

I used cod and haddock to prepare this dish. Doubled the recipe and froze half of the dish with the coating mix.  Added a dash of corn meal, a sprinkle of fish fry mix , added pinko and followed the recipe as stated.  I served it with steamed corn on the cob and a fresh house salad.  A delightful addition to my stash of recipes.  Thanks Jeannie.

Followed the recipe except added dried instead of fresh garlic. I was in a real hurry and this tilapia was well received. Will definitely make this again. I served with a favorite summer stir fry : onion, zucchini, fresh corn kernels and a tomato. It made for a light, colorful and quick summer meal!

Nothing spectacular or to write home about.  However, I ask Hamish to clarify his comment as I lived in various locations in China for 3 1/2 years and went fishing at local fishing farms and never saw anything wrong at any of them.

First time I ever made fish and tried this recipe.  It was very good but I needed to fry my tilapia for longer than 3 minutes per side.  It was more like 7 minutes per side.  We will be having this again (hubby requested it for next week).

What makes this recipe is the milk and then pan frying it in the butter and olive oil. For All the other ingredients I used different things I had in my cabinet.  It's a winner my family loved it. The fish comes out almost creamy on the inside!! So good ????????(Add a little lemon juice on top before serving it)

Strangely, I didn't have any eggs or milk on hand, so I just made the seasoned bread crumb mixture, coated fish on each side and fried in a pan as directed...squeezed a little lemon juice on it at the end, and it was fantastic! My new favorite. Easy and delicious!

This is a great tasty way to pan fry a fish.  I too kept the fish in the fridge a little longer than 15 mins. as others did, but didn't have time for a full hour, but it wasn't needed.  Thirty mins worked fine for me.  I had all the ingredients expect for the toasted onion, so I just used minced onion flakes.  I will say that I did get some kicks in the taste but would prefer just a bit more.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I'm going to put extra Old Bay in.  Oh, and I never eat Talapia, so I used some Snapper that were thinner cuts than normal.

My mother only ever cooked fish in crumbs, but she used crushed Corn Flakes.  I found it very good.  I used ordinary bread crumbs as I found the rest of the ingredients seasoned enough.  My Old Bay Mix (found the recipe here on AR) is highly spiced.  I did find it hard to make the crumbs stick to the fish and I had to put the fillets back into the egg/milk and then the crumbs again. The first lot were well soaked and on the second try the crumbs stuck very well and the coating was quite thick.

You have some very creative people that send in recipes! I loved this.  It was easy to make, and as another reviewer said, I happened to have all the ingredients in my cabinet, so it made it easy.  I will try another reviewer's idea of baking them also, but this was perfect. May not be necessary to use the salt, but what little you put in shouldn't make a big difference. Will definitely be making again.

This recipe is fantastic. I would add a little more red pepper flakes next time as we like a little more zip. But it was great as is. I baked instead of fried and used cod. Absolutely wonderful and crisp!

This was an easy and tasty meal - great for those frozen tilapia filets. I'll definitely be making it again. I mistakenly used Pepperidge Farms italian stuffing instead of breadcrumbs and it was still delicious (I just picked out the larger chunks, pressed it like the directions said and sprinkled the finer parts on both sides to make sure the seasonings got on). To me it was pretty spicy but my boyfriend loved it! Next time I'll half the recipe to make four filets since they're pretty small.
