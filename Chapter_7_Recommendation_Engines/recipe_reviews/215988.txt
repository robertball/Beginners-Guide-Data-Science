Very good.  I made the following changes, I diced the vegetables rather than slice. I added garlic, eggplant and broccoli.  I also added a layer of cheese between polenta and vegetables.  I couldn't find prepared polenta so made from scratch which didn't fry well.  I may skip frying it all together next time to make healthier and maybe vary the cheese.

I have never had polenta, much less cooked it.  This was fabulous.  Even my husband (a meat and potatoes kind of guy) loved it!  I put all the vegetables in the food processor to shred them and cut down on time.

Very good!  Next time I will not fry polenta - to save calories and I don't think it made a big difference. Also, I increased tomato sauce to 1.5 cups and reduced cheese to just a sprinkle on the top.

So good! Couldn't stop eating it. Like all casseroles, a nice comfort food.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have zucchini so I used mushrooms and added biscuits, quartered.
