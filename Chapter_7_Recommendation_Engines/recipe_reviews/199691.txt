Best if you can make a few hours ahead or the night before to allow flavors to blend and the drink to chill - then you don't need to add ice which dilutes the drink. I used a moscato which is an extremely sweet wine to begin with, so I use 1/2 the sugar. I recommend superfine or powdered sugar which dissolves more easily. I zest the citrus into the liquid before cutting the fruit which puts more fruit flavor in the sangria. I don't use grapes because I don't think they absorb the wine nor add flavor to the mix. I save adding the soda until just before serving to keep the fizz. Club soda is good, but sometimes I use ginger beer (from Trader Joe's) for a nice spicy snap. Salud!

This was awesome. I've never made sangria before and wanted something simplre for an outdoor summer event. I used a little apricot brandy and a little less sugar - depending on the wine you might not even need sugar. Thanks for sharing Sara!

This was a really beautiful and delicious treat.  I served this with desert, so I changed a few things.  I used white zinfandel, so I skipped adding the sugar.  I also traded out the grapes for pitted cherries, and the 4 limes for 2 large oranges.  Also, I used peach schnapps instead of the brandy.  Yummy!

I just made this for a secret santa party and it is delicious! Instead of putting it on ice, I combined the wine, brandy, sugar (and a half full bottle of champagne that I opened a few weeks ago), then added the fruit minus the grapes.  I ended up adding orange slices and a splash of orange and apple juice. Its sweet, but really good!  I let the flavors blend in the fridge for 5 hours, but I bet it would be even better over night!

This recipe is delicious!  I needed something simple and tasty for a green & white bridal shower I was co-hosting  - and people LOVED it!  Only thing I changed was I used a guava rum instead of brandy because I already had it in my bar.  And then I used limes, green grapes, green apples, and kiwi.  I would definitely recommend!

I served this at my Feliz Navidad Fiesta, and it was a hit. I froze the grapes and added them just prior to serving instead of adding ice. I thought it was a pretty way to prevent the sangria from getting watered down. I wasn't sure about what kind of wine to use, but I ended up using Sauvignon Blanc, and it turned out great.

I made this for a New Year's party and it was absolutely delicious!  As another reviewer suggested, I used apricot brandy and lemon-lime soda.  I plopped a few sliced strawberries in my glass instead of the lime, lemon, apples and grapes.  Wonderful!

Way too much citrus, it was so bitter.  I'll change the fruit around next time.

Great recipe! Everyone loved it...I doubled the brandy & added some green pears. Also added a cup of raspberries before serving. The color stood out from the rest of the fruit :-)

4,5 stars from us. I have never tried white sangria before, so I was very surprised how it will be. The taste was pretty nice, citrusy and refreshing. This sangria definitely is a great drink for hot weather. I made a mistake and put more club soda and I used rum instead of cognac. Next time I would use lemons and limes without zest.

I used an inexpensive pinot, cut out the brandy entirely (I'm just not a fan), and added some plums and pears to the party. OUTSTANDING summer punch :D

Many of the most positive reviews have some sort of sweetened soda subbed in for the club soda - I agree, I made as written with just club soda and it was not near sweet enough. I'm not one for super-sweet drinks but with all that citrus the extra sweetner is needed. Lemon-lime soda I added in after the fact worked fine. I liked the fruit mix and the regular brandy flavor, but this is a very customizable recipe that would probably taste great all sorts of ways. Just cut with sweet sodas and you'll be fine :) Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a bit hit at a recent party. I made it pretty much according to the recipe, except I left out the grapes. I'll definitely be making this one again!

I made this  for a pool party and everyone loved it. It is much lighter than a red sangria. I will definitely make this again... and again. I made a couple slight adjustments based only on what I had in house. i used a Moscato white, pears instead of apples, green grapes and sparkling water instead of club soda - all worked well and I would repeat. Happy accident!! Great recipe! Definitely recommend.

The only change I made was to use  ginger ale instead of  club soda.   It was still somewhat bitter   but the  flavor  improved the  longer  it sat.   Since  most sangria  drinkers  like a sweeter taste  I  would  probably make  with  sweeter wine  next time.

I made this last night for a winter get-together (dinner was a white wine fondue from this site). I made it in the morning, all except the club soda and ice, which I added immediately before serving. It went over REALLY well. The only thing I skipped was grapes, since I didn't think they'd add much and I already have a ton of fruit around the house. I wish I'd doubled the recipe because it sure didn't last long.
