This is the exact recipe I was searching for.  My Great Grandmother made this and I alway buy it at the PA Dutch Farmer's market.  It tasted just like it, thanks for posting.

Wonderful in flavor and ease.  My youngest son doesn't like the mayo version of slaw so we make both now!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe but make slightly different.  I use 1 bell pepper and add 1 or 2 chopped white onions.  I also add vegetable oil.  This is a family favorite!

I used this recipe on top of pulled pork. I liked the combination, my husband didn't, unfortunately. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

My family isn't a fan of green bell peppers, so we substituted orange and yellow and it turned out fine. I also totally forgot to season the cabbage with salt (does anyone know why you would do this?) and I used half the sugar. My husband loved it and we used it on pulled pork tacos. Thank you for posting!

A lot of sugar but delicious. I added grated carrot.

The only thing I did was give a quick rinse after the salting.
