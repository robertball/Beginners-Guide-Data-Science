I will definitely make this again.  This is the first time I have used iceberg lettuce in years and it is the right type for this salad.  The only thing I omitted was the almonds, otherwise followed the exact proportions.  I added the chow mein noodles after adding and tossing the rest of the ingredients with the dressing.  They stayed nice and crunchy that way.

Excellent salad...can be very portable---mix all  except dressing in a big zip bag and put the dressing in a container and serve it at work or family gathering at the last minute- I have added cashews and it works great also---i do roast the sesame seeds and almonds for about 15 minutes in oven--gives a great taste

Because I wasn't too interested in a 700+ calorie salad, I simply put the lettuce on a plate, and added a little of each of the rest of the ingredients, e.g. one slice of crumbled bacon, a pinch of noodles etc etc. I bet this would be delicious finished off with some 'Hot Bacon Dressing' from this site! Thanks, Teri!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe - great salad!  Great for potlucks as it's still good when it's "soggy".

A tasty salad that was fairly quick and easy to make. The dressing tasted 'right', however, it had quite a bit of sugar in it, and wasn't overly exciting. My kids didn't care for the dressing too much. The toasted sesame seeds and almonds were a great addition. If you are using crunchy chow mein noodles, add them at the last minute, and if you think there will be left overs, only add the crispy noodles to what you are going to eat. They can go soggy very quickly with all that dressing!

I make this salad all of the time--my friends and family LOVE it!  Instead of 6 slices of bacon, I use the whole 1 lb. package--I also use 2 packages of pre-shredded lettuce instead of shredding my own--much easier.  YUMMM!

My kids loved this salad.  I made half of the recipe for the 4 of us and left out the bacon.  Lettuce started to wilt as soon as I tossed with dressing but still tasted great. Added chow mein noodles at the end.  Served with "Asian Flank Steak," also from this site.  Next time I might add a little sesame oil and/or soy sauce, especially if I'm making it with the Asian steak.

This is an easy, flexible salad.  I used two small heads of "Artisan" salad (a varied 4-pack) for the lettuce and used turkey bacon (I'm sure the real thing would be even better).  For the dressing, I used 1/4 olive oil, 1/4 c brown sugar, 3 T rice vinegar, and the S&P.  This is a great salad if you are serving people who don't care for tomatoes or cucumbers.  Two of those eating this don't eat dressing and reported that the salad is excellent without the dressing. I plan to add some sliced strawberries and some blueberries to what's left for a different taste tomorrow.

This salad was fabulous! I subbed water for half the oil, omitted the bacon, and added a generous handful of craisins for a burst of sweetness. My family polished it off.

WOW!  This was such a great summer night dinner!  Tasty, easy and quick - that makes for a winner around our house.  I didn't have time to let the dressing sit for the full hour but all of the sugar had dissolved and it tasted delicious.  Great crunchy, sweet and tangy salad, thanks for the post!!

I love lettuce! This is the 30th time that I have made lettuce salad and every time I try doing it in a new way.  I must say it is one of the tastiest lettuce salads eaten so far,.

There's mixed reviews in my household. My two little ones weren't too impressed especially with the dressing and left some behind. My older son loved it but he likes anything that has bacon in it. My husband was so so on it and wouldn't really care if I made it again or not. As for my self, I liked it but I could probably do without the bacon (I'm probably the only person on earth that doesn't love bacon). I did everything as the recipe ask except for the dressing. I made the dressing with extra virgin olive oil just because the thought of using vegetable oil for salad dressing really grossed me out. Probably won't be making this again.

Love this! Used bagged, pre-washed and torn lettuce and bacon pieces from the pouch for time savers and convenience. Delicious! Thanks.
