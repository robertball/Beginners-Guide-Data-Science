I was worried about the outcome but was worrying for nothing. This worked great for me and was super fun to make. I only let mine go for 2 weeks but will let it go another week next time. To make things simple on myself I bought the shredded cabbage in a bag. Sauerkraut is cheap to buy yes, but making it yourself is a lot more fun!

I used 1.5 lbs of cabbage and 1 TBS of kosher salt.  It fits perfectly in one large canning jar.  I have glass weights to hold the cabbage down.  1/4 tsp of harrissa adds a nice heat and enough garlic flavor for me.

It was scary, but turned out awesome. I do advise doing this in a room, garage or she'd that is not used very often.  it doesn't stink but it does make the kitchen smell a little off. worth it though!

I have made home made sauerkraut for a couple of years now and this is the very simple recipe I have followed, other than the garlic, which adds a nice flavor.  If garlic doesn't like you, then skip it and trust me you will get some great sauerkraut!!
