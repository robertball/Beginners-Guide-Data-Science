I'd hate to just reiterate what everyone else is saying, but it's all true.  I also made the following adjustments and I think it will just keep getting better and better as I suit it to my taste.  8oz instead of 16oz whole wheat pasta, 2 cans healthy request cream of mushroom instead of 1, 2 cans of drained tuna instead of 1, added some garlic pepper, parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs on top.  Comfort food at its best.

I used half the pasta (and used egg noodles)
Doubled the tuna and soup cans, used frozen veggies (brocolli florets & peas) and 3 cups cheddar.
Hint - add brandy or cognac to soup for wonderful flavor.  WOW!
Added buttered breadcrumbs on top.
And the best cooks say NEVER oil your pasta.  If you are adding it directly to the mixture after draining - there shouldn't be any sticking.  This is a favorite for me, hubby and friends!

an excellent family meal, I suggest you make a double recipe and freeze leftovers, great to reheat in the microwave.

I would have given 5 stars but like others i did modify, I used Velvetta, linguine noodles,garlic powder, pepper and a little seasoning salt, and to the top crushed saltine crackers and finished with a little melted butter on the cracker top. It was excellent this way to my family. Oh I omitted the oil as well

Not a bad recipe - pretty much your basic tuna casserole.  I used less noodles (recipe calls for waaaay to many!) and added and extra can of soup and an extra can of tuna.  I also used frozen veggies instead of canned.  Hubby liked it ok, and my picky 4yo son actually didn't complain (a miracle @ dinner time).  Will definately make again.

This recipe was very simple and seemed bland on paper.  My family are cheese freaks, so I added 4oz of Velveeta to the soup mixture, as well as half a package Lipton's Recipe Secrets Savory Herb and Garlic.  My children asked for seconds!!

Call me crazy, but I love tuna casseroles. This is one of the better ones I've tried (I still think my mom's is the best). I did omit the can of mixed veggies, using chopped celery, a can of green beans, and a can of mushrooms instead. I also added garlic powder and did sprinkle the top with french fried onions about 5 minutes before it was due to come out of the oven. Yummy :)

was scrounging around for something to make for dinner and came across this recipe after I input what I had in stock, can't say anything bad about it! The hubby was glad to see a casserole on the table for supper, and it had so much flavor! A++ for this one!

I reduced the recipe by 1/2, and even though the yield says 2 servings, I got about 5. I used 12 ounces of pasta instead of 16, and substituted the can of veggies for 1 cup of frozen veggies.  I also added a few crushed croutons on top.  My picky teenager asked for seconds!

quite tasty and a very simple recipe.  Great alternative to the traditional tuna noodle casserole.  Loved the cheese and the veggies (used frozen also)---great way to "trick" the kids into eating their vegetables when its camoflaged in a great casserole.  I'm always looking for new ways to prepare tuna...added garlic powder and onion powder for a little extra seasoning...will keep this in the repetoire when I need a simple family pleasing reciple!

My kids claim not to like tuna but they came back for second now didn't they!  I think the cheese really makes this recipe special.

This was good, I did add an extra can of tuna because one can is just not enough for all that pasta and I also added a can of mushrooms since hubby and I love mushrooms.  Everything else I followed exactly and was not too crazy about the can of mixed vegetables, it wasn't bad but next time I will use some frozen mixed peas and carrots thawing them out when the soup and cheese mixture is heated and they will finish warming in the oven.  Will make again with my suggested changes.

BEWARE OF THE OODLES OF NOODLES!!!  You do NOT need that much!   This was great!  I added a few chunks of Velveeta, an extra can of cream of mushroom soup, and an extra can of tuna.  I also added a few spices and some garlic.  I used Rigatoni noodles and I topped it with some parmesan cheese and shredded cheddar.   Almost forgot- I used only 12 ounces of noodles, which may have been a bit much (even with the extra can of soup), next time I may only use 10.

This recipe is absolutely amazing with a few changes:
1)I used 2 1/2 cups of pasta and I used 2 cans of tuna instead of just 1.

Also, I highly recommend using the regular cream of mushroom soup. It's not as tasty if you use reduced fat or fat free :) 

Enjoy!!!

Bland, boring and just not very good at all. Using cream of chicken instead of cream of cream of mushroom helped a little, but not much.

This was a nice quick dish! I was looking for something to make with some leftover pasta I had in the fridge. I added 1 can cream of celery, garlic salt, parmesan cheese, and substituted the mixed veggies with green beans. Saved it as I am sure this will become a staple for busy nights.

Nice taste, mild, even using sharp cheddar.  Recipe worked perfectly.

I added pepper but no salt; used defrosted frozen veggies instead of a can.  Next time, I'll try doubling the fish for more of a tuna taste.

The best thing about this recipe was how easy it was.  However, to make it tasty, and to make it serve two people a normal portion, I had to make a lot of changes.  

I used less than half the pasta (200g total) and less than half the cheese (100g total).  I used about a cup of frozen mixed veg., which I heated in the microwave while the pasta was cooking.  I omitted the oil from the pasta cooking process as it is unecessary and would have added more fat to a recipe already bursting with fat.

I added about a quarter cup of milk because the mixture in the saucepan was too pasty.  I seasoned with a herb-and- spice salt mix, and added pepper, but it still didn't have enough zip so I added a bit of parmesan cheese.

Even after reducing the amounts, I still ended up with about 2.5 servings, enough for me and my husband and our toddler.  The end result after the changes was delicious comfort food.

I have always loved tuna casserole and this one is great.  I've tried it several times but I use three or four cans of tuna, Cream of celery soup and add a can of drained, rinsed canned corn.  Yummmoooo

This is a good simple recipe.  If you want a more striking taste, you can add more spice, different veggies, a topping, etc. to make it more exciting.  Both my son and husband had seconds.

This was pretty good for what it is, a fairly fast and easy meal. Did use two cans of tuna, I think one would be not nearly enough. Also, added bread crumbs sprinkled with butter (toasted under broiler for a few minutes) instead of cheese spread.

I thought this was great. I only used peas, and added crumbled crackers to the top. Everyone in my family loved it. There weren't any leftovers!

This turned out delicious, but the recipe was quite vague on cooking times.  I heated the soup mixture just until the cheese melted into it, and I baked the whole concoction for 15 minutes.  I made a few adjustments.  1) I only used 8 ounces of noodles, 2) I used 2 cans of tuna, 3) I substituted asparagus for mixed vegetables, and only used half as much, 4) I added just a pinch of mustard powder, 5) I added 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese to the topping.  Haha, on paper, it looks like a lot of adjustments!  Anyway, we really loved this, and the whole tray was gone in 15 minutes!

This turned out pretty good.  Few notes: we added two 5oz cans of tuna and it still didn't really taste too much like tuna so we'd add at least 12oz next time.  Also, it turned out a bit dry so we'd try to bake it for less time next time or add to add some milk to keep it more moist.  Overall, pretty good and we'd try it again.

So easy and hubby loved it!!!  He is picky about tuna casseroles and this was simple and delicious.  I used 2 cans drained tuna, 2 cans cream of mushroom chicken, 1 can peas and carrots drained, wide egg noodles, 1 stick butter and 2 cups shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese.  Followed directions for preparing and baking.  I did add pepper to mixture and garlic salt.  Delicious, thanks for the great recipe!!!!

this was my first bad pick of recipes. in fact, i even made an account so i could write this review. i had all the ingredients on hand in my home already so it was a quick pick. before i started cooking i read the reviews and took many of the added suggestions (double the tuna, cream of mushroom, pinch of garlic salt) and still this casserole was really bad. my boyfriend said it wasnt that bad but he only had one bowl..even with the popular add-ins this was a very bland, unattractive and not so appetizing dish.

Mmmmm so good! I used broad egg noodles, tripled the tuna and soups, garlic and onion powders and over the cheese I added a nice crunchy topping of buttered panko bread crumbs. My gang had three helpings! Comfort food at it's best. Thanks so much Wendi!!

I used many of the suggestions below...4 oz of velveeta, plus 2 cans of soup and 2 cans of tuna.  I didn't have mushroom soup, so I used Cream of Celery instead.  In addition, I added a bit of milk to the tuna mixture (1/4 to 1/2 a cup) to make it a bit creamier.  I also added salt and pepper on top before baking.  After the cheese melted I sprinkled the top with some Italian breadcrumbs I had in the pantry and baked for about 5 more minutes.

My 2 year old asked for seconds, even thirds and she rarely eats a casserole!

We really like this casserole.  It's definitely a basic, simple recipe, but it's easy to play with the ingredients.  This definitely serves about 4-6 people.  I always use 2 cans of tuna and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, otherwise it's too noodle-y and a bit dry.  You can also play with the spices- salt and pepper are a must!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good stuff for a cold day.  I added a couple of herbs to it and left out the cheese, and it was very satisfying.  My two boys, 2 and 3, ate it up!  It only took a minute to make, and the leftovers were just as good.  Another keeper!

This is really good. As the other reviews suggested i agree 2 cans of tuna are needed. I only used 1 can of soup, then added some milk and butter. At the end I sprinkled some breadcrumbs in top and after baking for about 20 minutes. I broiled for a little crunch top. Delicious!

This recipe tasted pretty good and when following the recipe almost exactly, it wasn't a lot of cooking, mostly just mixing together. Even the baking part only took five minutes for my toaster oven. My brother and mom really liked it. However, I plan to add more tuna next time, probably double the original amount since the tuna was almost nonexistent. I'll also probably add salt because it was a little bland. Overall, the recipe as is was really good, it can be even better though!

Delicious! Thanks so much for posting your recipe! I had to make due with what I had in the house, so I used 2 cans of tuna, elbows, 4-cheese Mexican shredded, a Cauliflower medley instead of the mixed veggies, and added French fried onions. Still came out terrific.

So I gave this 3 stars because tuna casserole is great but in following this recipe, I wonder why you can't simply mix all ingredients in a bowl and bake as usual. The extra stove-top pan seems like a waste of dishes to me. Thanks anyway.

I do a lot of different adjustments to my tuna casserole. I make mine very similar to if I am making homemade mac and cheese pie. I start with making a roux (butter and flour  paste) then I add milk to the paste.  I let that simmer for a bit, then I add a few cups of cheddar cheese to the liquid mixture to make a cheese sauce, then I put it aside. In the meanwhile, I'd be boiling my noodles; I usually use Farfalle noodles (bow-tie). In terms of the tuna, I always fry my tuna before putting the casserole together. While frying, I add onions, garlic, paprika, a bit of cayenne and black pepper to the tuna. Then, I get my casserole dish, pour in the noodles, then the cheese sauce, and finally fold in my fried tuna. I sometimes add green peas for a fresh taste. I add grated cheddar cheese on top, and baking for 40 minutes. I wouldn't ever do it in any other way. So delicious. This recipe was at best a nice effort.

l made it with what I had on hand and we loved it!  Used a 13 oz box of penne wheat pasta, 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of mushroom with roasted garlic because that's all I had.  I mixed in 1 mini block of Velveeta with 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and used a 12 oz bag of frozen mixed veggies (corn, carrots, peas and green beans).  Spread more shredded cheddar on top before baking.  Start to finish in one pan and in an hour.  Delicious!!!

I make this often however, not with oil. You can add salt to the water, just a little, to prevent sticking. If you must use oil, use coconut. Far better for health.  I add celery, corn, peas, and sometimes chopped up carrots. Load it with cheese on top. Kids love it!

Easy Cheesy Tuna Casserole Haiku: "Way too much pasta. Tuna gets lost in all that. Flavor's a yawn too." I love a good comforting tuna casserole, but this one was so heavy on the pasta-to-tuna ratio that it felt like all pasta. I used frozen mixed veggies instead of canned, but that was my only change. I'd do that (along w/ reducing pasta, increasing tuna and adding sauteed onion, garlic, and more spices) if I made this again.

This was easy to follow and really good. I substituted the mushroom soup for French Onion soup just because my family is not a mushroom fan. Over all this recipe gave me inspiration

I added another can of mushroom soup, tuna and also through in a can of french style green beans. It looked like a lot of noodles and no veggies or soup. Of course, i had to plus up the amount of cheddar as well. It is awesome!

I've made this recipe several times. We love it! My only changes are two cans of mushroom (makes it creamier), half a bag of noodles, and a whole bag of cheese. Delish!

I made dinner for my boyfriends Family and I was praying that I would find the perfect recipe! This one made me look like I really knew my way around the kitchen, and they told me that I passed the test lol 
It was delicious. The only things I did differently was change the pasta, and I mixed two different kinds of Cheese together (Mozerella and Gouda!) it was a big hit!

So i followed a few of the other suggestions from reviewers and this turned out pretty good.

I used 2 x condensed mushroom soup and added 1 can water
2 tins of tuna
1 cup of peas (not tinned as we don't like the taste of tinned veg)

I added crushed premium plus crackers on top covered in teh rest of the cheese.

Everyone really liked this but next time i think i'll try adding a little seasoning (salt pepper etc...) my kids generally won't eat anything that has been seasoned so i tend to cook new recipies without then add in as needed.

Fine as is.  The oil didn't seem to hurt it.  I added another can of tuna and milk since it was too thick without it.  Also dried onions as I like that in my casseroles.

Although I didn't make this recipe to a "t", it was a great base.  I used leftover wheel pasta - probably half a bag.  I used cream of celery soup, a can of peas, shredded swiss in the mix and then a 4 cheese blend on top.  Also used a garlic salt and pepper mix to taste.  We had no leftovers.

this was okay at best.. i halved the pasta.. didn't add any oil.. used a cup of frozen peas in place of the canned veggies.. and had to season the hell out of it otherwise it would have been pretty bland.. made this for bf to take for lunch and luckily he's not very picky

I made this pretty much as is and while I liked the texture and creaminess of it, I did not like the mushroom soup taste that I got from it. We would prefer a milder taste in our house so Ill try again but will use cream of chicken soup next time.

I didn't love this.  I didn't have Cream of Mushroom so I used Cream of Broccoli, but I don't think the change will make it any better.  It was very bland and kind of mushy. I won't make this again.

Too much pasta and I had to double the rest of the ingredients. Very bland. I ended up eating mine with picante sauce.

This was not the greatest casserole... but I think it's a good recipe if you're trying to get rid of things in your pantry or don't have the typical ingredients for a tuna noodle casserole on hand. Ex. egg noodles, peas, red pepper...

For how easy this dish is to make, it's great! Prep takes literally minutes, which is important for new moms like me who don't have much time to cook! The only thing is that it tasted a little dry the first time around, so next time I added butter before putting it in the oven, and it turned out yummy!

My family loves this recipe!  It's easy, and delicious.  It's an excellent "base" recipe, so we have tinkered with the recipe (more cheese, different toppings, etc.) and have come up with some great combos!  Also, a good recipe for beginners.

I used fresh veggies and it turned out great.  It was really easy and I had everything in the cuboard or fridge.
