My 14 year old son prepared it.  We loved it, kids too!

I made this as written, except I added a chopped red pepper that I needed to use up, and I didn't use the chives.   It was edible, but not my favorite.  The flavor was a bit boring, and I wasn't a fan of the potato in there.  I'm sure there are better vegan chili recipes out there.

I made some changes, for what I had on hand and for taste preferences. I used small green lentils instead of red, cannellini beans instead of kidney, tomato paste+water instead of puree. I used beef broth instead of veggie for more chili flavor, added a few seasonings (cumin and cinnamon), added the seasonings at the same time as the beans etc and let it all simmer together for about 30 mins. The result was flavorful and hearty! And everything was cooked perfectly.

I made this as directed, but was quite disappointed with the result. It was more of a bean / vegetable soup than a thicker chili. There was no spice and the potatoes weren't cooked all the way. It was fine if you want simple soup, but we will not be making again.
