My husband loved this! It was easy and tasted very different. It was WAY to spicy for me but I'm pretty sure that's how it was supposed to be. Thanks!

I knew by looking at the ingredient list that this would be too sweet for us as written so I substituted a can of pinto beans for one of the cans of baked beans and it still ended up too sweet for our liking. If I make this again I will use only pinto beans.
