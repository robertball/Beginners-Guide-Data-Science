I cut back on the milk in this recipe and added a few mushrooms that I had in my fridge.  When you are putting this together, make sure you check to be sure that there is enough seasoning in this because I thought it was a little on the bland side.  This was easy to make and would be a good dish for a busy night!  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great.  I didn't have the bell pepper but had some corn on hand.  I had made beer can chicken the day before.  The family loved it and will definitely make again.  Great flavor.

I made this with linguine and TONS of veggies (broccoli, carrots, celery, onions). My husband asked for more AND requested more veggies next time! It turned out great! !

This was a good, quick and easy dish that I modified based upon what I had on hand, and I cut the recipe in half.  I had fresh portabella mushrooms so I added almost a whole 10oz. package of those but left out the celery. I also added 1 large clove of garlic. I used canola oil to cook the veggies instead of butter.  The milk seemed like too much so I cut that in half.  I didn't have enough cheddar cheese so I substituted with Swiss for half of the cheese and sprinkled some parmesan on top before I baked it.  My only disappointment was that it had too much pepper, but that may have been my own mistake when I cut the recipe down.  I would make it again but leave out the pepper.

I was looking for a quick recipe using rotisserie chicken and this recipe was perfect! As a disclaimer, I made a couple of changes because I didn't want to make a trip to the grocery store. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and a combination of shredded cheddar and swiss cheeses. I also used whole wheat linguine for the pasta. As several others had suggested, I reduced the amount of milk to 13/4 cups, and I found that amount to be perfect for the amount of chicken and pasta. My husband really enjoyed it and I will add the recipe to my growing list of AR favorites.
I think the next time I'll add some frozen peas and a small can of mushrooms. I also think the recipe would work with chopped ham or turkey.

I did as many others, reduce the milk in half. I also added 1/4c sherry and added garlic powder. To increase the vegetables I also added broccoli to my onion and green peppers. It turned out great.

I used leftover chicken thighs to make this! It was awesome. The only thing I added was 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning. I served it with garlic bread.

I made this exactly as instructed except no celery because I had none. Came out excellent. Two 13 yr old boys darn near ate the entire 9x13. With oven baked garlic breadsticks on the side, it was a winner for sure. Oh yeah, I did sprinkle some Panko on top of the cheese after it had cooked for awhile. Just because I like a little crunch on a cream casserole.

True to its name, this was an easy recipe, and my family enjoyed it.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I subbed cream of chicken soup. I added with the milk (didn't change the amount) a small can of mushrooms (rinsed, drained), a can of diced tomatoes (rinsed, drained), 1 TBSP of green chilies, a bit more pepper, and 1 tsp garlic powder. I also used whole wheat penne. While my boys loved it and had seconds, I thought it was a little bland. I'll make it again, but I will probably add some Italian seasoning and maybe a hit or two of hot sauce or a sprinkle of cayenne.

I love to cook but this one was a last minute surprise. I came home from work and my wife was sick and nothing planned for my family of 4.  I made this recipe with 2 chicken breasts and a  package of sausage that was in the fridge.  Yeah, it is not mac and cheeze but when you are tight on ingredients it works. Came out great. Tweek it to your liking, it is basically a casserole,  use what you have. I did, the kids loved it and i had lunch for the next day.
