Pretty nice. The quality of the ginger ale is key. I used whatever fruit I had. Thank you for the recipe.

This was very good. I unfortunately did not have all the fruits called for so I used blackberries, pineapple instead. It was good and hopefully next time I will try it with a different ginger ale to taste the outcome.
