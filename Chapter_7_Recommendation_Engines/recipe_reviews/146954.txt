Very Good, 1 tip I was told by a neighbor, if you are using fresh tomatoes, place in a brown paper bag the night before and freeze.  Let them start thawing in the sink and run under warm water and if they are ripe they are very easy to peal if they are still a little green they are a little harder and then you do not have boil the water and let them cool.  Really enjoyed.

Excellent sauce! Only changes I made: I did not use Riccota(will try next time) and I used regular brown sugar. Very rich complex taste , best sauce from this site for now, although takes time, but well worth it.

First, my changes. Added 1/2 can of olives, used only red bell pepper and omitted the sugar and dairy. (allergic to them) And with those few changes, I had pasta sauce to RAVE about! It was fantastic!! Thank you so much, this is keeper! My first time making sauce from scratch, and I am not going back to canned-this sauce rocks!

This sauce was amazing!  I didn't have zucchini, don't like mushrooms, used garlic powder instead of garlic, used tomato sauce instead of paste, didn't add the bay leaf or the ricotta, used a variety of tomotoes from the garden and it was just fantastic!  Definitely worth the time, I will be making this again.

OMG this is so fabulous! I used fresh vegetables and tomatoes from my garden. So I did not use roma tomatoes, I used beefsteak tomatoes. I omitted the red bell pepper. This is the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had. Making this again for sure!

EDIT:  Try blending the tomatoes in a blender intead of smashing them for a smoother sauce.  Then mix the paste in.  Hope it helps!    I wish this sauce had pics because if it had I wouldn't have tried it.  I prefer a more smoother sauce to where I can taste the sauce on my noodles.  With this sauce it more of a thicker veggie substance.  The spices seemed a bit much so I did decrease on table of the oregano and am so glad I did!  I think it actually needed a little less then that.  NOTE:  If you don't have Roma Tomatoes then be aware that they are by no means a large tomatoe, they are between small and med.  size.  Mash the tomatoes up good.  The sauce was ok.  But will definatly be looking for another sauce.  Thanks for the recipe though.  It was something to try!

A really nice spaghetti sauce. Forgot the ricotta, added some meatballs. Found the sauce a little sweet but remembering the ricotta would probably halp balance that out. Love the fresh ingredients and no added salt.

This was rediculously good.  I left out the sugar/splenda, chili powder, didn't have any zucchini or ricotta, and I used a bag of regular tomatoes from my neighbors garden.  Also I added about a half pound of ground beef and chopped chicken liver (vitamins!) Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum.

This makes a very rich, tasty sauce without much salt.  I substituted part fresh oregano for the dried and used a generous amount of fresh basil in place of some of the italian seasoning.  I also used half olive oil and half butter for cooking the vegetables (less than called for overall.)  The recipe makes a beautiful, chunky sauce.  However, I pureed mine so my picky children would eat it.  Make extras to freeze!

Delicious and easy to make sauce.  I used tomatoes, bell peppers, and eggplant (no zucchini) from our garden, left out the ricotta, and served with chicken meatballs and whole wheat linguine.  Family loved it.

Amazing sauce! This was my first time making a pasta sauce from scratch. I don't think I will ever but a jar of sauce again. I used all fresh ingredients from my garden. I did make a few changes. Instead of roma tomatoes, i used about 10 big boy tomatoes. I omitted the red pepper, chili powder, Splenda blend and ricotta. I added 1 cup of chopped carrots, 1/2 cup of chopped celery and I used about 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped basil. I reduced the oregano to 1 tablespoon. The aroma of the sauce has made my mouth water all day! If you prefer a chunky sause, as I do, than this is the perfect recipe for you! I will probably add the ricotta cheese to a future batch. I just didn't have any on hand.

Delicious Sauce!!! 
I started making this sauce last year when I was new to gardening and wasn't sure what to do with all my tomatoes.  I came across this recipe and thought, this sounds awesome!  Well it was.  I made some of my  own modifications (as everyone probably does), first I did not include mushrooms or ricotta cheese, as I do not care for either of them, second, I added mild italian sausage.  Just remove the sausage meat from the casing (easy to do, just squeeze it out of both ends), brown the meat in a frying pan then add it to the sauce.  I usually do this part after the vegetables, just use the same pan. Always turns out great!

love this recipe with a few modifications.  first time we made this, we made it as per the recipe, and it was great before we put in the ricotta.  the ricotta made the texture a bit different, but it was still good.  I've made this a number of times since, making a few changes:  we left the cheese out, and used double (or more) garlic, and added a chopped up chilli pepper to the garlic and bay leaves.  nice and spicy, and fresh tasting.  lots of compliments as we've served this a couple times as vegetarian option for dinner parties.

Too much sugar, other than that I love it. Will half brown sugar next time, hopefully that makes it perfect for my taste.

I used it as a starter sauce,  and then took it from there.  Very good start.  I agree with most of the other reviews , you don't need the ricotta , I didn't use it as keeping the calories down.  I blended my tomatoes down and added red wine and water together for the 2 cups.  My family likes a smoother sauce.  Also my family isn't big fans of the veggies so after I sautéed them I blended them into a purée and added to the sauce.  I added fresh basil and oregano along with other Italian seasonings.   More garlic and also as I was using wine I upped the paste to 15 oz instead of 12 also increased the brown sugar and added salt.  My family loved it, especially my husband who likes when sauce holds to the pasta.  I also made homemade pasta, meatballs and homemade bread so all went well together.   Recommend it as a starter then take it from there..

I loved the chunky veggies and the spices. Used baby bellas and added some shredded carrots.  Forgot to add the ricotta. It just needed a bit more salt, I think (but I like things really salty).

This was good, I really liked all the vegetables in this sauce and I was able to use up tomatoes from my garden that needed to be eaten.  I used regular light brown sugar in place of the Splenda.  I did not have any mushrooms, but would add them in next time.  To make a smoother sauce for my toddlers I pureed it it batches in my blender.

Yummy stuff!  I was only able to cook this for about 3 hrs and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to but I ended adding about an extra 2 to 3 cups of water throughout the cooking process because it was just cooking down so much!  Salt (and pepper if you want) is definitely a must to get this seasoned right.  Next time I may cut down the sugar by half.  We really did enjoy this :)

I spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect spaghetti sauce.  This is it for me!  I do cheat and use canned tomatoes but everything else is exact and it's really yummy.

Although the flavor was good, I did not care for the texture and sight of this dish.   The kids would not even try it.  I guess we will just stick to other recipes that have worked better for us.

I made a huge batch of this, like 96 servings, but only used 1/2 cup sugar for the whole batch, left out the zucchini, and used fresh oregano, tyme, basil, and only green bell peppers cause it's what I had. I also used 2 red, 2 yellow and 2 videlia onions.
