I made a layered rainbow cake for my daughters fifth birthday party and I'm allowed to send treats into her preschool to celebrate her special day with her class, so I made these! They were a huge hit and adorable. I used the same Wilton gel dyes I used for the rainbow cake for more vibrant colors and made a buttercream frosting and added sprinkles. Too cute. :)
