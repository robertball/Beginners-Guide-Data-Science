Thought this sounded really good, but the soup was pretty bland. Added a little salt, splash of hot sauce, and a few other seasonings which helped, but don't think I'll be making this again. The scallops were good, but this is a general recipe. It was a nice thought but a side of sweet potato souffl√© and asparagus will take it's place. I tried!

I cooked up the sweet potatoes when I made the vegetable broth.  This was thick enough that flour was not needed. the ginger and cinnamon were fine when ground into the soup!  There was enough spice without the cayenne pepper, so I didn't use it.  This has great taste.  If we can afford scallops again, I will be making this again!
