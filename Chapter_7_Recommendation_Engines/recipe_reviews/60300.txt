I love this salad and have been making it for years!!  It is great if you are on a diet and use sugar-free jello.  Substituting orange jello for lemon is my favorite.  I also mix all the ingredients together at the same time (not chilling the jello then adding the pineapple and carrots.  Do not use store bought shredded carrots.  Shred them yourself on a grater (better texture than in a food processor).

This is very similar to a recipe my mother always made called "Perfection Salad."  She learned it in home ec class in the early '40's.  She always used lime jello, and besides the carrots and pineapple, she would sometimes add in some finely chopped celery, or some shredded cabbage.  One of my favorites from my childhood!  Thanks for sharing it, Asteng.

Great recipe. Super easy.  My Grandma always uses orange jello.  This is always a holiday favorite as the bright color pairs well with other foods.

This was a holiday favorite at Grandma's house! Grandma also sometimes added some shredded cabbage if she had some.  Great way to get the kids to eat their veggies. Please pass the lemon jello  :).  I give this recipe 10 stars for nostalgia!

My mother always used lime jello but all I had was orange this time so I added orange soda for the cold liquid and after it thickened, I whipped it with my mixer. Then folded in grated carrots and finely sliced celery. It's great!

My mom in law made this salad or a version of it and it was really different and tasty.   She used lime jello (she said any citrus flavor would do-good with lemon also), she added small chopped celery, shrredded or chopped fine apple, shredded cabbage, a bit of pineapple and carrots- the amounts of each are to your liking or what you have on hand, and last but not least, onion. Yes, onion. She always served it cut in squares on lettuce with a dollop of mayonaise sprinkled with paprika on the side.  It looked special and it always added a refreshing treat to our meal.  Yummy.

My family cannot get together without this salad. My dad and I will even fight over the left overs! lol We mix some Miracle Whip with milk to make it smooth like a creamy salad dressing, then a bit of sugar, dash of salt and small sprikle of pepper. This zippy topping is amazing; sorry grandma never measured and it is to taste.

Excellent!  The crunch of the carrots almost makes you think there is nuts in it.  Perfect balance of taste with lots of carrots.  Wonderful colour to add to a table.  Great Salad, give it a try!

I am 77 and have made this salad for years as my mother before.  Lost the recipe and "voila" after 6 years I found it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I also make my own dressing.  Heavy cream, mustard, vinegar and sugar.  I can not give you amounts as I do it to taste.  It really makes the salad, though.  I forgot, I also add finely chopped celery.  I have an old fashioned hand grinder.  Does the carrots great.

I bought orange jello by mistake, but I don't think it mattered. I didn't have crushed pineapple so I just chopped up some rings. I also only used two large carrots. I had four, but 2 seemed like plenty and this was still delicious. Obviously very versatile recipe. I will be making again :)

Well, I was afraid I wouldn't find this recipe. We always had it at the holidays. Simple but very nice taste addition to any meal. Mom always used lime gelatin instead of the lemon. It brings back memories of when I was a kid. Thanks for posting it.

This takes me WAY back to my childhood when my grandma would make this for special family dinners.  My nephew requested this after hearing stories about it for years.  This was the only recipe I could find, and it was exactly as I remembered.  Of course I had to find an old jello mold to make it just has grandma had.  It turned out perfect and was a hit.  I will certainly make it again.

This is really good I am a diabetic so I used sugar free strawberry jello and lite pineapple chunks, shredded carrots and celery chopped real fine, my grandson ate it up not actually knowing how good it was for him.

Reduced Sugar Option:  I love this salad but have diabetic relatives who carefully watch their carb counts.  To reduce the carbs per serving, I have made this recipe with sugar-free jello (either lime, lemon or orange) and, instead of adding the extra carbs of the pineapple juice, substitute either sugar free lemon-lime soda OR Minute Maid light lemonade (from the soda aisle).  Tastes great and has fewer carbs per serving.  Try it and enjoy!  :  )

My Grandma called it Sunshine Salad and I loved it - she would make a dressing out of miracle whip, a bit of sugar and thin it with a little milk.  Top the salad with that and YUM!!

I have made this a few times now and I love it! I have tried it with crushed pineapple and also with pineapple tidbits and I preferred the tidbits for a few reasons.. one being I was able to drain the juice and also the texture & size of the little tidbits was perfect. Also I prefer strawberry gelatin but like the orange also... next I will try with lime gelatin and also going to try a strawberry-banana one too :) Thanks!

I love, love, love this salad--always have.  I've never made it with lemon Jello, but I will next time.  I used orange flavor this time because that's what I had.  Only had room in dish for 2 carrots, and it seemed to be the right amount anyway.  Added 1/2 c. finely chopped celery.  First time using crushed pineapple for me, I've always used chunks.  I like the crushed better.  Very good recipe.  My aunt who entertains a lot and always sets a beautiful buffet  would also add mandarin oranges in addition to the pineapple.  Always looked forward to having this dish at family get-togethers.  Can't wait to try with lemon flavor and will leave out the celery next time.  Last time I made this recipe was 15 years ago for Christmas, nobody even touched it except for me and my boyfriend. That's okay, more for me and they don't know what they're missing.  Since it's summer, I'll be making soon...it's so refreshing!

I had this at a friends house and wanted to make it one night, but I had never made jello before. This was very helpful. It one of my go-tos now.

I grew up on this recipe. My mother added, as I do, sliced pimento stuffed olives. It adds color and cuts the sweet a little. When I married in the late 70s, this salad was listed in my red Betty Crocker cookbook as Sunhine Salad.

Not gonna lie...this was MUCH better than I thought it would be. Next time, I'll swap out the carrots for coconut. It's basically a citrus explosion in your mouth...with a little carrot crunch.
