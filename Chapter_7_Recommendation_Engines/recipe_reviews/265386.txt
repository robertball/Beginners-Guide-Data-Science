AMAZING.  Oh my goodness- I literally giggled in delight when I tried the finished product!  I left the recipe alone other than adding 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and upping the amaretto to 1/2 cup.  My husband tried it when it got home this evening and said that it tasted just like cobbler.  I was a little nervous about adding the sugar before the pectin but the consistency is perfect.  Excellent recipe!

My mom gave me a bushel of peaches, and this recipe was great for them! I love this on toast, but I think it'd be great on Creme Anglaise or vanilla ice cream too.

I had some very ripe peaches & didn't want to toss them, so I salvaged what I could & got about 4 cups, added a couple of ripe mangoes & followed the recipe, sort of. The fruit was sweet, so I added less sugar, about 1 3/4 cup.  At the end I substituted Triple Sec as  I didn't have amaretto, & made about 6 half pints. Easy to make & delicious!

Added a little extra amaretto, titch more ginger and it received rave reviews. Made another batch with a pinch of cardamom for special foodie friends and that received great reviews also.
