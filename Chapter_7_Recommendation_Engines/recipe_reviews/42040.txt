It's not that it isnt good- it just wasnt what I thought it would be.  If I were to make this again I would change a few things.  First off- I would not cover it while cooking.  It seemed more boiled than it was baked.  I like my wings a little more candied. Plus- I would add half the amount of italian dressing than called for.  The ingredients are complimentary- but the italian dressing overpowers the apricot/onion taste that I believe would be tasty.

This recipe was just okay. My guests liked them butsaid they lacked that special kick taste. I won't make them again for my parties.

I made this for New Year's Eve, and although everyone tried it - the plate remained over half full.  I won't make it again.
