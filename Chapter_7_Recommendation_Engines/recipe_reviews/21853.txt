My sister in law asked me to bring sweet potatoes to a holiday party at her house... I am not even a big fan of sweet potatoes so I didn't know quite what to bring.  I found this recipe online and it looked so easy and I love apples so I thought this might work.  Oh my God, it was SO easy and it tasted so very good!  It was a big hit!!  Since she was having so many people over, I doubled the recipe and made it in a disposable foil pan in the oven rather than the microwave. I also sprinkled about a half cup of chopped pecans over the top to make it look a litle fancier and add some crunch.  I baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes and she had it in a chafing dish at her house to keep it warm.  It was awesome! I got lots of compliments  :)

Threw this straight into the trash can! This should NEVER happen to a sweet potato!  Terrible texture contrast and taste contrast.

This was really good.  I wasn't sure if the sweet potatoes were supposed to be drained, so I left about 1/2 the juice and it turned out good.  Thanks!

Enjoyed this quick and easy way to fix a side dish that is almost like a dessert.  Only way I changed it was to use fresh instead of canned sweet potatoes since I had a bunch of them.  Precooked them in microwave, then peeled & thickly sliced them before adding to the apple pie mixture.  Also cooked them in regular oven till bubbly since oven was on anyway.

This was so easy to make my boyfriend made it for me (his cooking level:  he just learned to brown hamburg).  It was delicious, we'll definately have it again.

Made for my family for Thanksgiving, now they've all got the recipe and are making it for their holiday parties too!

My husband loved this one. I will make sure to drain the sweet potatoes next time, I think that will bring out even more flavors. Thanks!

Simple and delicious; we used raw sweet potatoes which we microwaved then scooped out but we had home canned apple pie filling.  We had to guess on quantities for both; however, we loved it! Yes, it would have been much faster with the canned goods, but we used what we had.

Being a recent convert to sweet potatoes, I loved it; and so did those family members loving sweet potatoes. I left the pecans in quarters for easy removal for those disliking nuts.  Even my mother-in-law, tantalized by its wonderful aroma, ventured a taste and proclaim it very good (she didn't like sweet potatoes!!!!).  With the apple rings on top, it has great eye-appeal.  It's not overly sweet (like sugar or marshmallows) but naturally sweet from the apples (I used "Cameo" apples).  Also, use 3 MEDIUM size sweet potatoes, not large like I did -- too much left over.

This printed version is almost exactly the version my grandma used to make. I've made a few tweaks/changes that I think zazz it up quite a bit.
1. Peel and boil your own sweet potatoes in salty water instead of using canned. It isn't much work, and improves the dish.
2. Use a bit more brown sugar. I don't ever measure it, just eyeball it.
3. I use ground cloves, nutmeg, and allspice along with the cinnamon right on top of the sweet potatoes. Spice fairly liberally.
4. Add fresh cranberries! Toss in about a half cup (two small handfuls?) of fresh cranberries, trying to distribute them evenly throughout the dish and atop it. Don't add too many! The tartness makes an excellent counterpoint to the "sweet-on-sweet" of the potatoes and apples. It also makes it look much more festive.
5. Dot the top with 1 or 2 Tbsp of butter, and cook it in a 350F oven for 30+ minutes, covered with a lid or foil.
This sweet potato dish beats the pants off of whipped potatoes covered in marshmallows!

I substituted copycat pampered chef cinnamon plus mix for the cinnamon, I mashed my sweet potatoes, I stored the pre-mashed and mixed ingredients overnight before I baked mine in oven for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. I also added mini marshmallows to the top. It was to die for, will make again!!

My girls totally loved this, I thought it was fine. Easy and quick. I did drain the liquid from the sweet potato can, even though it didn't say so in the recipe. I felt I needed to because it was all liquid. However, I think I can improve on this recipe by adding a crumble mixture to the top and baking it in the oven. That would make this recipe rock and sing dozens of praises!

I used 3 fresh sweet potatoes cut into pieces and boiled to fork tender then drained. I put them into a 9x13 baking dish then spooned the apple pie mix over the top. I mixed 3 tablespoons of melted butter with 3 tablespoons brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and spooned it over the apples. Then I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes. Before serving I topped it with 3/4 cup chopped, toasted pecans. We love this and will make it again. Perhaps 1/2 cup raisins would be tasty as well! Thanks for the recipe!

this was a  great side dish for Thanksgiving, the apples really add so much to the flavor. it's a little on the sweet side so could probably go with a little less brown sugar but easy to make. made mine ahead and reheated on top the stove.
