This was sooo good.  I held back a star only because I made a few critical changes to the recipe that affected the flavor in the positive.  First, I didn't use basil.  I really didn't think it was a flavor combo that my family would appreciate.  Also, since we don't like wine (not even for cooking), I used 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of beef broth.  I also added an extra clove of garlic (of course).  The result was a fantastic side to our main dish and will definitely be added to our rotation!

Absolutely delicious! After reading others' reviews, I made a few changes: I used 2 bags of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen, 1/2 tsp each basil and pepper, and 2 cloves garlic. I also used white rather than red wine (personal preference!). This is an elegant, easy side dish, but it does need to go straight from the stove to the table. Fortunately it only takes a few minutes to make, so I cook it just before the other dishes are done. Thanks Leslie!

LOVE spinach.  LOVE portobello mushrooms. Did not like this dish. I used fresh spinach and it looked beautiful, but both the basil and the red wine gave it an unpleasant taste. I hate to waste food, so I reluctantly ate my portion--hubby could not do the same...

This was *EXCELLENT!*  I'm not one for mushy spinach so I changed the order a bit and used fresh baby spinach but I omitted the basil.  I also used a tablespoon of Gourmet Garden garlic (already crushed so you don't have to!) instead of just one clove.  I cooked the mushrooms on medium heat in the garlic butter for appx. 10 minutes (until they were very brown).  Then I added the wine and appx. 10 sec later (mushrooms are like sponges and sop up the liquid quickly)  I tossed appx. three mittfuls of baby spinach into the pan.  I lightly tossed the spinach with the mushrooms until the leaves *just began* to wilt.  Once they reduced by half, I served the portions onto the plates right away.  Cracked pepper and parm cheese is the perfect je ne sais quoi!

I tell you, if I could give this recipe 10 stars  I would. It tasted look something I would expect to be served in a fine restaurant. It is unbelievably easy to prepare, and the flavors are magnificent.  My husband loves spinach and so he was  extremely happy with the perfect blend of flavors that did not overpower the spinach flavor at all, and when my 22-month-old daughter ate hers (usually like pulling teeth to get her to eat anything green) I knew it was a hit.  This will be prepared at least twice a month at my house.  ENJOY!!!

This was an outstanding saute!  I was serving 5 hearty eaters... so here are the adjustments I made:

4 total tablespoons of butter (next time I am going to try olive oil)
3 large garlic cloves
a bunch of chopped green onions
3 total portabellos
double all of the spices and cheese
used fresh spinach

Everyone raved about this recipe... it was the first dish to empty on the table!  Very hearty!

Very different dish, never would have thought to mix spinach w/mushrooms.  I did, however, modified the recipe.  I used 6 cloves of garlic and 1/8 cup of Parmesan cheese.  Also, I suggest omitting the salt as you really don't need it unless you prefer a strong salty taste.  Thanks Leslie for a wonderful side dish!

I loved this recipe.  Easy and delicious.  One change I made: because I had no wine on hand, I used lemon juice instead, and it was lovely.

This is a favorite side dish of ours whenever we have a steak dinner.  I've used either red or white wine, depending on what I have on hand.  I've also made this with both fresh and frozen spinach, again depending on what's in the frig.  The only change I usually make is to omit the basil, just because it doesn't really seem to add anything to the dish.

Excellent dish, although I tweaked it some. One of the best spinach dishes I have had. First I sauteed the mushrooms (which I just used regular sliced mushrooms for the store) a minute or two first before everything else so as not to overcook the spinach. Then I add enough fresh baby spinach to cover the entire skillet, than added the dried basil, kosher salt, pepper, and garlic powder instead of clove garlic. When that reduced down, I added about 1/4c of chicken broth and cooked for a few minutes. Stirred in the Parmesan cheese and served. Was amazing, even my boyfriend, who hates spinach, loved it. Definitely recommend this twist for those who don't like the flavor wine sometimes gives to food.

I love this combination of mushrooms and spinach. This recipe is very tasty, healthy and easy. The only change I made is I substituted the butter with olive oil and added some sun dried tomatoes for extra taste.
I served it on top of some farfalle pasta, it was incredible! I would though recommend to double the amount of mushrooms, as two are hardly enough for 4 servings.

So delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I did use 2 bunches of fresh spinach.  I made this last night and my husband has already asked when I am making it again.  The same husband that really doesn't like spinach...;)

We loved this recipe.  It was a hit with everyone.  We made a few changes, I used olive oil instead of butter, fresh spinach, I used 3 cloves of garlic and instead of the parmesian I used feta cheese.

I am beginning to learn how to cook and this recipe is going on my first page for side dishes!! Absolutely delicious, it works as a side dish, to top off chicken or add to pasta as a sauce/veggie combo!   The measurements were on point, the only thing I subtituted was lemon juice for the wine thanks to a reviewer's suggestion. Let me tell you it was brilliant and completed the dish perfectly for a buttery lemon taste.

I had some spinach and button mushrooms I needed to use up so I searched the site and found this recipe.  My dh and I loved this side dish.  The only changes I made was:  used fresh spinach which I steamed prior to adding to the sauteed mushrooms.  Did not have portobello mushrooms so used the button mushrooms.  Did not have red wine opened so I used white wine and added a llittle extra grated Parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make again.  YUM......

This is an easy and delicious meatless entree when I'm by myself. To make it quicker I bought 6oz sliced portobello mushrooms and fresh bag of spinach. I bumped up the garlic to 2 cloves and I didn't have red wine, so I used white wine vinegar. Also I didn't have Parmesan, so I used Feta. I think the cheese is optional.

YUM!  I love mushrooms and spinach.  This was terrific.  I altered a bit to make it weight watchers friendly.  I used olive oil instead of butter, reducing amount to 2 T from 3.  Increased the wine slightly (or you could use a tad of chicken broth).  VERY good for only 2 points!

Excellent! Who knew two super healthy veggies could taste so good together? The Parmesan is wonderful with this dish. It made just enough for 3 people.

This was FABULOUS!  My mouth still waters from the remnants of the ingredients!  I did use fresh organic spinach, less salt, less dried basil, more pepper, the exact recommended red wine and fresh parmesan ingredients.  I could taste every single natural flavor of this dish and could not be more elated!  I will definitely use this recipe again and will share with my friends.  A great accompaniment to any beef dish.  I LOVED IT!

AMAZING! I notice some folks did not follow this recipe step by step or thought to put fresh spinach or white wine. FOLLOW THE STEPS AND THEY WILL LEAD YOU TO FOOD NIRVANA!!!! Everything was absolutely perfect! My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. This is definitely a winner for a dinner party as well. Frozen spinach is the way to go however if you're going to use fresh, make sure you put a hefty amount!!

I made some changes to suit us, but it was great!  I needed a main dish, so I added some prepared chicken at the end.  I used 3 cloves of garlic, 3 Tbsp wine, 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil (instead of dried), 3/4 c. Parmesan inside the dish and more grated on top to taste.  I also added 7 or 8 regular white mushrooms sliced and a medium white onion sliced into strips.  The extra mushrooms, onion and chicken made this a definate main dish, and one that got MAJOR rave reviews.  The extra grated Parm. on top made a big difference.  I used the leftover fresh basil tossed with slices of Roma tomatos w/ some garlic, salt & pepper and the pairing was delish!  This was a great base for any changes you need to suit what you have and/or what you like.  I'd highly recommend it!

I followed this recipe to the letter and the recipe was a real let down. It was a waste of really good portabella mushrooms. The recipe turned out super bland and everything kids imagine about eating spinach.

This was excellent and super easy to prepare. My husband eats few veggies and loved this recipe. Will make often. Thanks! I used 10 oz fresh spinach instead of frozen.

Good flavor. I used spinach from the garden and took the advice of another reviewer and used some balsamic and beef broth instead of wine. I went heavy on the garlic and added a tiny yellow onion, and used fresh basil and parsley.

This is one of the best vegetable recipes that I have ever tried.  I used white wine instead of red, and it was so good.  I would reccomend this with any meal.

Loved this dish.  I used fresh spinach...it was what I had on hand.  I also added some green onion because it needed to be used and I used white wine instead of red.  Will make it again.

I had fresh spinach and white mushrooms that needed to be used so I found this recipe.  I used majoram instead of basil, garlic salt instead of fresh garlic, and red wine vinegar instead of dry red wine.  Excellent!  Thanks for the inspiration!

This was just OK for me.  I think next time I'd just create my own version instead of following a recipe - I tend to like a little more garlic and I think some extra wine wouldn't have hurt either.

This is a nice side dish with good flavor.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.   It didn’t wow us, but it was still very good.  I would add some chopped onion the next time just for additional flavor.

My boyfriend and I loved it, we are always short of time so the fast easy prep time is a bonus. I served it with grilled chicken so low mess in the kitchen and a fast, tasty meal that is healthy, what more could you ask for? (I did use butter flavored cooking spray to make it a completely healthy dish!!)

Delicious and easy!  I used 4 cloves of garlic which really zipped up the flavor.  I also used a non-stick pan and a dash of olive oil instead of using the butter.  The parmesean added wonder flavor, but it made the dish look kind of muddy -- next time I will try sprinkling the cheese on top instead of mixing in.  This complimented the filet mignons nicely and was such a treat!

Wonderful made with fresh spinach!  Don't add spinach until mushrooms--and other early ingredients--are almost done, then dump in 4 cups fresh spinach.  Follow remaining recipe.  Don't overcook spinach!
Awesome flavor; probably the best thing I've made from Allrecipes.com and I've made a whole bunch ?

I am on a restrictive paleo diet so I am looking for variety.  I had to cut out most of the parmesan but didn't want to cut out the flavour.  I used olive oil,  added red pepper, red onion and used Italian seasoning for a bigger flavour.  I sprinkled parmesan sparingly . I made a second batch for lunch it was soooo delicious!!  Thank you for the recipe...this is so fast, easy and scrumptious!

This was really good but I like a lot of garlic so I added three cloves.  Otherwise, it was perfect.  Served it over bow-tie pasta for a delicious meal.  My 16 years old said it was like something she would eat at Olive Garden.

Used this as a sandwich filling on my Good-N-Crusty Roll recipe. I added Provolone cheese and roasted red peppers.  Hubs used soy, parm cheese.  Fantastic weekend sammie.  We grilled them in the panini machine brushed with olive oil.  So good!

Wonderful and so easy!!  I used less butter (about 2 T.), fresh baby spinach rather than frozen, and added the parmesean at the end as a topper rather than mixing it into the pan.  This will definitely be a repeated favorite!

fixed Sun. to go with some aged steaks. thought I'd try the balsamic touch idea.  Bad move. I'll stick to sauteed w/wine or butter Mushrooms, and wilt the Spinach all by it self and serve separate much better control and taste

I LOVE portobellos.  I added some brown rice and ate this as a main course.  Yum!

Wow, this was great! Didn't have Portobellos, so I used cremini mushrooms instead (which are baby portobellos anyway). This is the only recipe I'll ever use when cooking spinach from now on! Made it with gorgonzola & thyme-crusted filet mignon and white wine-roasted fingerling potatoes. A very romantic Valentine's Day dinner!

Seved it with steak and everyone loved it.  They didn't want to share.  I made some substitutions.  I used 1 tbs butter and 1 tbs olive oil, used half the spinach (fresh), used swiss and monteray jack cheese (doubled the cheese) and doubled the amount of white wine and used 1/2 the amount of salt that it called.....  Had to use what I had in the house!

Excellent side dish!  Used 10oz fresh baby spinach and 8oz sliced button mushrooms.  Loved the sauce - it seeped into our breaded pork chop, making that 3 star recipe 5 stars too!!

Loved this!! Even my 10 yr old who always says she hates spinach ate this!! Only change I made was to slice up a bunch of the baby portobello mushrooms (didn't have the big ones on hand). Not only was this incredibly delicious, but it's also incredibly easy!! Will definitely be making again!! :)

I thought this dish was absolutely delicious. It has so much more flavor than the simple ingredients hint at. I used small chantarelles instead of the portobellos, leaving them whole, and regular button mushrooms would probably even be just as good. Next time I'll double it...this was SO good! Thanks you, Leslie.

Simple, quick and delicious! I did saute diced onion (half of a small one) before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.  This recipe got the big thumb's up from my husband AND from the mother-in-law, who is very sparing in her compliments.  I served it with just bread for an easy, light evening meal.  It's a keeper.

I made this as a main dish with a small side of baked sweet potatoes. Extremely healthy and lectin free. LOVED IT!  I always use a high quality olive oil and ghee instead of butter, and European Parmesan cheese to avoid the products of corn and soy fed cows. #gundrymd #ownyourhealth

This was pretty good!  I used fresh baby spinach, NO basil (didn't have any), and Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine.  My wife and I are not spinach lovers and I'm not a mushroom guy but this was awesome!  I will definitely make this again!

Awesome and hearty side dish!  I've made this twice in 2 weeks.  I frozen and fresh spinach as well as portobello and white mushrooms with equal success.  Freshly grated cheese is the key.  I love this recipe and will make it many times over.

Had to change the recipe based on what I had. Used a premixed bag of fresh baby spinach and arugal, and I had baby portobello mushrooms. Prepared as directed but I used a dry white wine instead and I had a container of shredded Parmesan and Romano so I used that. It was good. Was paired with a steak and roasted potatoes.

Very tasty, I found the basil to compliment the dish just fine.  I also used fresh spinach, but this would taste good with frozen too.  This was an elegant side dish for a dinner party, with roasted herbed red potatoes and savory pork loin with a sweet sauce.

We Loved this side dish with grilled rib eyes!! I didn't change much: less butter, more minced garlic, added onion powder and used white wine instead of red (I highly recommend this change!) Yummy and pretty healthy too :o) We will be having this often with dinner.

This was pretty good. I had to use a combo of balsamic vinegar and lemon for the wine and used fresh spinach and regualr mushrooms. I also added some cherry tomatoes. It was quite watery but over all okay. I melted some mozzarella on the leftovers on top of rice and that was really good. Not sure if I would make again.

What a fantastic dish!  The flavor was a perfect compliment to my Garlic Prime Rib.  I used 16oz of fresh spinach, 3 mushrooms, and I accidentally forgot the parmesian.  I bet when I make it again (very, very soon) and add the parmesian it will be the best spinach dish ever!  Well, it already is, so it will just be even better.

This turned out amazing but only thanks to Nicole F's review and that is to add fresh baby spinach right at the end and just allow it to heat thru.    Otherwise it would have been soggy but realize that the recipe called for frozen which we do not use.

I made this side with poached salmon and it was fantastic!  I guess I drank all the wine in the house, so I used chicken broth.  It was absolutely fantastic, although next time I want to try the wine just to see what it tastes like.  This will definitely appear again on my dinner table.

I increased the basil and pepper to 1/2 tsp. each and increased the garlic to 2 cloves as recommended by others.  I still think it was missing something so I added 1 Tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and that was the zing that I was looking for.  I also omitted the salt.  I made this again for a dinner party and it gets cold really fast; will only make this again for the family not a huge group.  Also, the presentation wasn't as pretty as the picture posted.

It's a very good dish but definitely, should be eaten as soon as it is done.

Thanks for the contributions people!

This was excellent!  I doubled the garlic, substituted olive oil for the butter, used one bunch fresh chard (chopped into thin ribbons) instead of the frozen spinach and tossed it with penne (two cups dry) for a complete meal. Delicious.

I used finely shredded swiss cheese since my husband does not like Parm. I ommited the basil and added more garlic. Super dish. I served it along with roast beef, carrots, potatoes and onions. Sourdough bread and dinner was ready. Thanks.

so simple & so delicious. I also doubled the dried basil, added 3 cloves of garlic, used normal button mushrooms instead of Portobellos. I omitted the wine and call me crazy but I put 2 tablespoons of whole milk instead and then a tablespoon of cream cheese so it can melt along with the milky/spinachy sauce. yum! My mom and sister loved it!

This was good. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, added a little more garlic and added sliced onions. It needed a little more flavor, though.

This was a yummy quick and easy recipe. My husband absolutely loved it. I used a bag of fresh baby spinach, regular mushrooms & the cream cheese. I highly recommend it for a quick side dish.

This is a great recipe and it's made even better with fresh spinach. Just wilt the spinach and proceed with the rest of the recipe. You can use button mushrooms instead of portabello.

Yum.  This is good.  I love spinach and usually keep it simple by cooking first then putting it in a pan and saute it with lots of garlic and some olive oil but decided to change it up a bit.  Very good and i found I didn't eat as much as the mushrooms are very meaty and are filling and the cheese makes it rich as well.  Served with some fish and it went really well together with the lemon from the fish and spinach...yummy!!  Won't make this every time because of all those factors, but for a change up it's perfect.

Excellent!  I used the frozen garlic cubes and basil from Trader Joe's.  I also added zucchini and just a sprinkling of chicken bullion.  This was very tastey.  The wine had a nice touch.  Would probably also be good with balsamic vinegar. Will make it again and again.

Excellent - yum! Very easy and quick. I did use fresh spinach. 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil instead of all butter. Had white wine on hand - came out great! Thank you so much - a winner!

This was good.  I would have rated it a 4, but my husband loved it and I always round up so a 5 it is.  I thought there was too much spinach and wished there was more mushroom...I used 10 oz of portobellos.  I followed the recipe exactly except I subbed parsley for basil.  Thanks for the yummy side dish!

I quite liked this, but I'm afraid it went down like a lead balloon with him indoors who thought the flavours were very harsh and didn't complement each other. Won't be making it again for him, but will probably make it for myself.

Absolutely wonderful! I followed the suggestions of Sara L. My husband, who's not a cooked spinach fan loved it. 2 bags of fresh spinach barely served 4 so I'd increase that next time.

This was very good - my first time with portabellos.  My husband did not care for the spinach so I'll probably leave that out next time.  Somehow I almost over-salted this dish.  Will leave out salt altogether and salt at table next time.

So good! Subbing mozzarella for the parmesan, this works with Phase I of South Beach. I liked it enough with fresh spinach, that I'll probably never try the frozen. Will make often. Thanks!

Fabulous side dish. This came together so quickly and easily. My husband loved it and it accompanied our grilled ribeyes nicely. Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great. Will make many more times. Again, very, very quick.

Quick. Easy. Delicious. I used button mushrooms instead of portobello's, and this was wonderful!  Even those that did not like spinach enjoyed this (if they were willing to try it!)

This was my first time working with Portobello mushrooms. I can not believe how easy and delicious this was. I made the mistake of buying the frozen chopped spinich. The spinich pieces were too small for the size of the mushrooms. Next time I will buy the whole leaf spinich. I doubled the recipe and added 6 or 7 garlic cloves. Everyone loved it!

I didn't have portobello mushrooms, so I used the regular button mushrooms.  I am sure it would have been even better with portobellos, but we thought this was wonderful with the others.  I don't usually cook with red wine, but the wine makes this dish.  Also, I used fat free butter and it worked fine.  This is a really great side dish!

I used olive oil instead of butter, as it's healthier, & omitted the basil due to family preference.  I made it once with frozen spinach that I partially microwaved & drained first before adding to the skillet and another time with zucchini instead of the spinach.

I thougth this was very good, and my company enjoyed it as well.  I would add a little less wine next time; I thought it was a little over powering.

I also made this with a package of fresh spinach, which worked out very well.

Keep in mind, because the spinach cooks down so much, this doesn't feed very many.  There were no left overs, and only 3 of us ate it (the 4th, my husband, had his 2 bites because he doesn't care much for spinach).

This was a really good recipe. like many, I generally use this site for ideas that I can make my own. I added sliced onions in the butter and garlic until they carmelized, then at the end I added in a can of diced tomatoes after the spinach. Serving over a quinoa/rice mix as a main dish. Yummy!

Amazing side dish...and super easy. I add extra garlic, omit the basil and as one reviewer suggested, used balsamic dressing (2 tbsp). I also used a  1 tbsp refrigerated chicken condensed chicken stock and warmed it in the microwave with the balsamic before adding to the pan. This side dish was so good. Both times I have made it, and my measuring is never fully exact. I would serve this even at a holiday meal!

YUM!!! Did follow suggestions, and made a couple changes knowing our favorite tastes. Removed basil and parm cheese, used frozen chopped kale instead of spinach (adds a little more crunch), and used 2 tbsp red wine vinegar mixed with 1 packet Truvia and 1 teaspoon onion powder, along with 1/2 cup bacon chopped. It's a hit!

Ok...I went a bit nuts.

I figured why not grill the portobello with some onions with balsamic and garlic . I saw tomatoes in the picture so said to myself “let’s grill them too”. Brought it in and sautéed the spinach then thought....toss it all together (more garlic please and  chopped up onion/portobello ). Still missing something so I cooked some thin pasta in garlic oil (wife fried garlic cloves in oil). then I added some garlic/herb alouette and a splash of cream. Pepper all over and it came out brilliant

Excellent...very attractive on the plate. I had to leave out the garlic due to a sensitivity, but just upped the other spices and it was very tasty.  I am always surprised how much spinach and mushrooms shrink, so I started with about 25% more . Wish I had upped the quantity to 50% more....

I was worried about this dish because I'm not a huge fan of spinach (cooked or raw), but it is so good when it's done! I used a 16oz bag of frozen spinach, so I roughly upped everything else (3 mushroom caps, 1/2 tsp salt/pepper/basil, 2 garlic cloves, 4 tbsp red wine, & about a 1/2 cup of cheese). I can't say I really notice the basil, so I'm not sure it's entirely necessary, but I'll definitely be making this in the future!

I needed to spice up a spinach dish and this recipe is a winner. Easy and simple to prepare recipe which is what I like. I followed almost all the ingredients except I didn't use a portabello mushroom. It still turned out as good.  My husband said it was a keeper!

Omit basil. Sub sherry for wine, or use equal parts balsamic vinegar + beef/chicken broth. Extra garlic. Serve with sliced tomatoes and garlic bread.

Love using recipes for ideas that I can modify, so I made a few minor changes on this one and added to make it a full meal. I used white wine and beef broth  (1 T of each) and left out the basil but added half of a a small minced shallot. The blend of balsamic, broth, garlic and shallots was amazing. Of course I love balsamic and could drink it from the bottle- haha. I cooked some Italian sausage ravioli in water and then added them to the pan for the last five minutes of cooking in the mushrooms and sauce. I finished with a sprinkle with fresh grated parmasean cheese. Thank goodness I had only cooked four large ravioli because I could have eaten the whole package if they were available. I loved it so much that I made it a few days later when my mom came to visit and we both agreed that this could have been on the menu at any of the restauants we ate at in Italy a few years ago. Awesome!!( And I am not really a mushroom lover.)

I absolutely loved this recipe! I did make a few changes for my own personal taste. I omitted the basil and added cherry tomatoes and toasted pine nuts. I also used fresh spinach.  It was so filling that I actually made it my main course for dinner.  I will definitely be making this dish again!

I made this for a Christmas Party that my vegetarian Aunt and Uncle would be at, knowing that many of the courses would be some type of meat protein.  What a crowd pleaser for everyone there.  This dish went so fast, late comers were asking about how to make the mushroom dish.  My Aunt has since said how much her friends like this dish also.

This was awesome!!  I used fresh spinach and didn't take into account how much it would reduce so mine was mostly mushrooms but still great!!  Will buy frozen spinach next time though! Also, I didn't have any red wine, so I used Marsala instead and it was very good, it complemented the mushrooms very well.

Doubled up on garlic passed through the garlic press. Started the saute with butter, fine minced shallot and garlic. Added all ingredients and continued to salute. Wine and Grated Parmesan went last (a Cabernet was needed to stand up to the earthy tones the mushrooms produced). Found the dish robust and went well with Steak, Baked Potato and Grilled Asparagus.

This was so good it was painful. I did use fresh spinach instead of frozen, and white wine instead of red (I was serving it with seafood). Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and couldn't get enough!

Had to use white wine instead of red but flavor-wise it turned out great.  Would definitely recommend serving immediately before the mushrooms release all their juices.  Everything turned kind of brown when we didn't eat it right away.

As written it's a 4.  It becomes a 5 when you leave the wine out!  Just doesn't need it--the veggies can stand by themselves in all their glory-- well, with a bit of the cheese added.  I DID make this recipe as written the first time to be fair.  The wine made it taste odd so it was left out during all successive executions of this dish.  I noticed another reviewer thought the same thing about the basil and wine!  The combination of the 2 veggies is also somewhat more appealing and interesting than either veggie by itself.

Great recipe! I cooked it as written with these exceptions: used half butter half olive oil in pan; doubled garlic; cooked mushroom until half done before adding spinach; saved Parmesan cheese as a topping at the table. Very tasty!

Excellent recipe.  Made a few changes- less butter and more garlic.  Chopped up some leftover green onions and was wonderful!  Didn't use as much butter to cut out on the fat content. Will make again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Only thing I changed was used a bag of fresh spinach, not frozen. It cooks down quickly and the texture is better.  This is very tasty and goes with everything.  We have this once a week!

So delicious....I did use fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and evoo instead of butter. Will make again. The flavors of the red wine and parm are really good. Thanks!

The spinach was quite yummy....except, i completely forgot to include one of the main ingredients, the grated parmesan. Then it turned out my husband doesn't like spinach, AT ALL. So I ate his serving as well, I didn't complain, it came out good, must tast delicious with the cheese in it. Next time.....

This is excellent. It works very well as written, but it is also a great dish to add to. There are so many variations, it makes a quick meal easy to put together with whatever you have on hand. I find using fresh baby spinach is even easier than using frozen. I also usually throw in some finely chopped onion or shallots.   Thanks so much for the recipe, it has become one of my staple menu items!

My dad helped me make this and we both thought it was amazing!!! No variations, it was the best side I've made since I started cooking. Made with Cabernet Sauvignon... it was great! Served with steak. But it's only getting 4 stars b/c 4yo brother didn't approve... :P

This is a delicious side dish!  Tastes like something you'd get at an expensive restaurant, but it's actually super-easy to make.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I didn't have any basil so I had to do without, and it was still fabulous.

Very tasty!  I used red cooking wine (stupid Massachusetts, you can't get real wine in a supermarket) but that worked out just fine.  It had a very Italian flavor to it -- I served as a side dish with salmon and we were very impressed.

This was sooo yum. I really liked this. I could eat this alone as a meal. I love mushrooms and spinach together. I served this with the garlic salmon on this site and it was the perfect side dish. Great recipe!

Very good! I used up some fresh spinach (instead of frozen), and I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, but it was still surprisingly tasty! I'll be hanging on to this recipe.

Very good! It was missing a little something. I added some garlic powder as I went along. Have to figure out what spice to add to give it a little more flavor. But was a big hit.

This is a great side dish for steaks.  The next time I make it though, I'm going to use fresh spinach added in the last few minutes of cooking.  It was really good with frozen spinach but fresh is always best to me.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really good, served with steaks and baked potatoes. I ended up using two tbs more butter to keep it moist, used one tbs balsamic vinegar instead of wine and a bit less parmesan. Next time I think I'll experiment with different cheeses or no cheese.

If you love spinach, very good and very healthy!  Some didn't care for it totally...but they aren't huge spinach people.  Seemed a little dry...maybe a bit more wine next time?

Excellent side dish!! I served it with Seared Spicy Salmon and mashed potatoes au gratin. Will definitely be making this one again!! I used fresh spinach and white wine.
