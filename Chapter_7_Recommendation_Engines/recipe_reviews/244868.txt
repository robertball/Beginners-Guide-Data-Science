I really liked how quick this was!  I had fresh organic green beans with which to make a simple side dish.  Came across this recipe and poured a swirl of extra virgin olive oil in the skillet and added about half a tablespoon of butter and, then, the green beans.  Stirred until coated and added similar seasonings (I used an all purpose seasoning sold by U.S. Wellness Meats, that is made in St Louis.) Turned to coat the green beans and periodically turned again in the skillet.  I didn't time it, but, checked with a fork until done to my liking.  They were great this way!  Will make again!

Wow. All I can say is WOW! The last time I had green beans they either came in a frozen square or a casserole! This is my first time making fresh green beans. They were delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely adding fresh garlic cause I have tons of it! And adding butter with the olive oil like someone else suggested. Yum!
First I warmed the skillet with olive oil and butter. While that was heating I cut the tips/end of each green bean(GB) then cut them in half and cleaned them. 
Second I threw the thinly sliced garlic in the pan then the GBs then the seasonings. Covered and stirred every 10 min until our desired firmness. Per my hubby "2 thumbs up and definitely make again!" :)
Ok so maybe I had more to say than just "wow"

I steamed the string beans first for 7 minutes and then sauteed them in the olive oil and seasoning. Quite delicious!

The seasoning stuck to the pan instead of the green beans. Had to put the lid on for a bit of steaming effect otherwise these never would have cooked - looked nice and roasted but were still raw after twice the cooking time (and I used thin haricot vert).

Very basic, and very delicious.  I've tried several green bean recipes that were a lot of work, and honestly were not that great.  Every single member of my family loved these - from the picky eaters to all the adults.  Easy and delicious!

These are amazing - the only cooked green beans my husband will eat! He just said “wow, those are so good we don’t need any fries with our dinner!” I recommend steaming in the microwave to nearly the desired doneness then sauté for 2-3 minutes with the spices as listed at medium-high heat. (We like them al dente so we only steamed for two minutes.) Yumm!!!

I think often we get caught up in making something basic "fancy."  Well, at least I have!  No need to always do that.  Yes, this recipe is basic, but it's also VERY good.  Just doesn't get any easier or tastier than this.  Quick enough for a weekday meal or IMO fancy enough (add  sliced mushrooms and onion slivers) to serve to company!

Made it exactly as written, and it was delicious!   Next time, I may add some fresh onions, and maybe mushrooms.  Tastes so much better than cooking then in water or steaming them!  Will definitely be making them again!

I remember eating green beans from our garden when I was a kid. And I hated the fuzzy skin. Pretty sure they were steamed. So when a friend gave us a whole bag of green beans, I decided to find a good recipe. We've been married for 17 years and I've never cooked fresh green beans, but I'm definitely going to keep making them now! This recipe rocks! My kids all loved it too. I did use this recipe as a general guideline rather than following it exactly. I used bacon grease rather than olive oil  (so sue me, I'll use olive oil next time, lol), added butter on the recommendation of one review, used a whole pan of green beans, put in half an onion, and just sprinkled on garlic salt, onion powder, and pepper. Cooked for 15 minutes, turning every 5 minutes or so. Might cook just a little longer next time. We like our beans pretty soft. Loved the sautéed onions in this too. Might do a whole onion next time. Awesome!
Thanks for the asparagus tip. I'll have to try this with asparagus too!

I marinated the beans in Italian dressing for a couple of hours. Then I started off with some water in the pan. Covered and steamed the beans. Added some vegetable spices. Turned out good.

As others have commented, this is a great basic recipe. It's a 5-star recipe as-is, but it it also very adaptable. For tonight's version, I added bacon and green onions.

works good when covered for a minute or two to allow slight steaming, cooking beans a little faster, and more tender.

Great recipe, however we everything was to dry in the pan, and after 6 minutes the beans were still raw and salty. I poured about a cup of water in, which perfectly steamed them to crisp after 5 more minutes.  The water helped to dilute the saltiness as well.

Made it just like the recipe except I didn't have any onion salt or powder so just left that out. It was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

This dish made for a nice low maintenance side, however it was a little too salty for my taste. I also tweaked it by adding a little lime juice near the end of the cooking. YUMMY!

I bought some fresh green beans today to have with grilled chicken and baked potatoes for our dinner.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  My husband and I both thought it was delicious.  The only thing I did differently was add some fresh minced garlic and a few sprinkles of Emeril's Original Essence to the beans.  They were so favorable.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was a easy, delicious way to make fresh green beans. I thought the seasonings were just right. I liked the soft, crunch texture of the beans. I will make this again.

I did what others suggested, I steamed them in the micro for about 5 to 8 mins and added some cajun seasoning (just guessed depending on how many beans I had) other than that followed the recipe.  It's a keeper in my house.

Hubby and I enjoyed.  I've made fresh green beans many times and this was as easy as any.  I stayed pretty true to the recipe:  I used butter in addition to oil, used garlic powder, onion powder and a bit of salt.  I would like to suggest to people that they allow the green beans to brown (or blister) a bit.  It enhances the flavor and in so doing, it cooks the beans more.  That way they won't be too firm, but just right.  (Once they are browned, you can even cover the pan and let them continue softening up a bit more if you choose.  )

Thanks for sharing.  The only changes I made was adding sausage, bacon, butter, replacing onion salt with onion powder.

Delicious! Added a tad more garlic salt to taste, and cooked about 6 minutes longer. Will be making these all the time!

I followed instructions but need a heavier hand with the seasonings.   It was very easy to make. And tastes not bad. Try it.

So so easy and so so delicious! My fiance won't stop asking me to make these now. I didn't have all of the seasoning on hand, so I used onion powder in lieu of the onion salt. Definitely going to be a staple for many years to come. Super healthy, and I was so proud of my simple yet yummy family side dish. No butter is always a win for my family!

I so wanted to like this recipe but the green beans took way too long to cook this way! By the time I was done cooking them the spices were stuck on the bottom of the pan and the green beans were burnt, and they STILL weren’t as thoroughly cooked as I would’ve liked. Next time I’ll steam them first and cut back on the amount of spice - they were way too salty tasting.

Great recipe! My children really enjoyed it too. That was a huge win, for sure. I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was steaming the beans in the microwave for 3 minutes before I put them in the frying pan.

I made my green beans  with oyster mushrooms, used avocado oil and Kerrygold butter, garlic powder, onion powder, and coarse sea salt. All I can say is I am good with eating green beans now. :) This was actually my first time making green beans ever! Great recipe!

The whole family enjoyed them. I did cover and cook for probably 15-20 minutes. They were still firm but probably not as crisp as my hubby would prefer. This recipe is a keeper for us.

This was so delicious and easy to throw together. I happened to have some portabello mushrooms on hand, so I sauteed them for about 4 min, then added the green beans.  They were a great addition. My green beans were partially cooked, so they came out not as firm as I'd like. The next time, I'll try fresh beans from the start. Like others, I also added some butter in with the olive oil.  I used garlic and onion powders and salt and pepper. Those simple spices really went well with plain old green beans! Definite keeper recipe!

I used homemade onion soup (from Allrecipes) and took the other suggestions of using beef broth instead of water. Didn’t brown the Roast as I was in a hurry. Cooked for 10 hours on low. Amazing fall apart roast. Will be my go to from now on.

I didn't have any garlic salt or powder.  I did use one big garlic clove and about a pinch of salt, black pepper, onion powder and EVOO... sautéed in the pan for about 5 mins the coveted for about another 5-8 mins. Sooooo good! Everyone loves them. Will definitely make again!

Hubby and I both loved it. I don't like veggies, so I'm trying different ways to fix them so I will learn to like them.  This one worked. Didn't have onion salt so used onion powder.  Next time will use onion salt.

Fast, easy and delicious.  Followed the recipe as written except I followed someone's suggestion to steam the beans first which I did, for about 7 minutes.

wonderful for all my garden veggies; I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

It took forever to cook the beans to my preferred tenderness and in the process the chopped onion I used (instead of powder) burned and also the beans a bit.  I would try this again but probably steam the beans first as someone else suggested.

Smells way too strong....I was looking to see of frying green beans was an accepted option.  All this recipe told me was yes.

Very simple dish to make and tastes great.  I like that it cooks so quickly.
