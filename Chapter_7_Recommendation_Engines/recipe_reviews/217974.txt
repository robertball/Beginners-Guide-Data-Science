This was just OK! I was the only one out of five people who liked this. The two kids might have liked it if it wasnt too spicy for them.I made it exactly as written. It uses way too much oil. If I make this again I will probably cut the oil in half to 1/3 cup and skip the first browning of garlic step as I didnt feel it did anything. I would just add all 3 cloves of garlic at the same time as I add the broccoli rabe. As far as the flavor it really seemed to be missing something like 1 tsp of italian seasoning. If I make this again I will rerate it.

It was great!  Iâ€™d maybe use a little less oil.  Other than that, yum.  The next day, we chopped up greens more and added the dish to a miso soup broth with orzo pasta and it was delicious!

This really is a very good recipe. I wanted something to do with leftover broccoli rabe and chickpeas, but different than the usual pasta dish. This is it! I read the other two reviews and CNM Catering is right, this recipe calls for too much oil. I looked at the submitter's original recipe and it requires only 6 Tbsp of oil. So the five stars is for the original version. I asked around the Buzz and a bunch of cooked broccoli rabe is about 450 grams and a 15 oz. can of garbanzo beans weighs about 8 oz give or take. So I made it using the original amount of oil (6 Tbsp) and it came out crsip and delicious. Make sure you drain the broccoli very well because mine got a bit soupy and I had to cook it off which over-cooked my broccoli. The amount of hot peppers depends on your liking but a kick is necesary. I topped with parmigiano reggaino. Typically served with sausage it also goes well with veal, pork or lamb chops. Thank you Tomn for submitting this tasty dish.
