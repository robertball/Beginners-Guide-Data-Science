I used Trader Joe's yellow curry sauce (11 oz), and added whatever vegetables I had on hand, chicken, and rice, and it was delicious.

We couldn't find yellow curry sauce, so we used red curry sauce and the soup was delicious!

Excellent - it seems too easy to taste this good!   Forget chicken noodle - next time I am sick, I am making this one.  It will clear out the sinuses and soothe the throat.  I used one tablespoon curry paste.

This was really simple and so good.  I added a can of bamboo shoots and japanese mushrooms and that added a lot!  I also didn't have red peppers, so added a small jar of roasted red.  Very good!

Love this soup!  I used frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh and one tablespoon of curry paste instead of curry sauce.

I made this with chicken and substituted the curry with a TBS of yellow curry paste.  I added bamboo shoots like another review recommended.  My young son loves it!  Thanks :)
