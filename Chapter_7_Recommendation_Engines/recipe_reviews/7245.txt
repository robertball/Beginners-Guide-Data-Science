Pretty darn good!  If you aren't baking on a pizza stone, you should pre-bake it a little before putting on toppings or the middle will be under-done.

Jay thank you so much for an EXCELLENT thick, pan type pizza crust, that was crisp on the outside and chewy/tender on the inside! 
The only personal perference additions I did were: I added Italian Seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder along with the salt/oil. And I baked them for 10 minutes prior to adding the toppings in a 12 inch cake pan and 12 inch cast iron skillet, that were both olive oiled WELL, and dusted with yellow cornmeal. They came out of the pan very easy onto the cutting board. 
It was easy to make this. Just have to adjust weather and flour consistency to the stickiness of the dough. Some days need less, some days need MUCH more. Adding about a 1/2 cup grated parmasean cheese to the dough is great with the seasonings. I never roll the dough out, I just use my hands and flatten it in the bottom of the pans, working up the sides Also sometimes string cheese rolled in the crust makes the kids happy too.

I had been looking for a pizza crust similar to Pizza Hut pan style and this is the closest and best so far!  It definitly makes 2 crusts unless you have a huge pizza pan.  And the trick to getting a crisp bottom on your crust is to bake it on a lower rack in your oven so your crust bakes before your toppings burn.

I made this dough in my bread machine and it came out perfectly.  The crust is crunchy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside.  I did bake the crust about ten minutes before adding toppings and divided the dough to make smaller pizzas.

My God, could there be a better pizza dough recipe out there thats as easy as this???  I have never made pizza dough from scratch before, and after the success of this pizza, I wont be buying another premade pizza again!  WOW that was easy and tasted AWESOME.  I just melted butter garlic and poured it on the pizza and added cheese, it was a great addition to my italian dinner without the hassle of baking a loaf of bread.  I cant imagine how good that pizza could be with all the toppings!  If you are thinking about this recipe, dont hessitate, add this to your recipe box now and get it over with!

I tried this crust last night and was very pleasantly surprised. I kneaded it with the dough hook on my stand mixture and left the dough slightly sticky to acheive a more tender crust. I rose beautifully and was very easy to stretch into two medium pizzas. I baked the pizzas on a pizza stone preheated for an hour at 500 degrees. They baked in about 8 minutes. The bottom of the crust was very crunchy (but not burnt) and the edges were nice and soft. I've had problems with tough crusts in the past, but this one was nice and tender. I will make it again!

This recipe is perfect.I made the full recipe but I seperated in half and made the 2nd off on the 2dn day. I used my pizza stone and prebaked the crust for about 10 mins. at 325. then I put the toppings on. The crust needs a little something so i brushed it the second day with an mixture of olive oil and garlic powder. It rises amazing! and it tastes like real pizza crust. My husband loved it and I think from now on I will make my own dough because it is sooo easy and much cheaper than buying the frozen ones. I can't wait to make it again! Thanks JAY!

My husband and I enjoyed this crust very much.  I added a little garlic and onion powder to the mix and put it in the bread machine.  I baked it on my pizza stone and it was perfect.  It was crusty and chewy on the outside and soft and yummy on the inside.  It made two large sized thin pizzas.  We have plenty for dinner today, too!!his may be the recipe we use for all our pizza!!

I have been looking for a nice home made crust recipe after being disappointed by bobili, and pilsbury crusts.  This recipe was very good and fairly easy to make.  I added some fresh garlic to the top.  As others noted this makes a large pizza.  Next time I will make 2 smaller ones.

Great Recipe, comes out perfect. I find it’s great for making large batches and freezing.  Before letting the dough rise portion it out into the sizes you would like to use and cover the portions with oil.  Place the dough balls on a cookie sheet and freeze them till there solid then place in a freezer safe container.  This way they don’t stick together while freezing.  When you want to make a pizza take out a ball rub it with a bit more oil and let it stand about 6 hours.  Then roll, top it and pop it in the oven the same as the recipe.   I’ve tried defrosting it in the microwave but you need to watch it carefully to make sure the dough does not start to cook.  Also because of the nature of dough it can easily pick up odors from the freezer so you might want to pop some baking soda in there while your at it.

*update* I've made this several times and this makes a top-notch pizza crust with a crispy crust and chewy center.  I double the sugar and increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp because it’s a tad bland as written.  I recently substituted 1 C flour for whole wheat flour and found it did not alter the texture.  100% whole wheat made the dough gummy and hard to roll out.  Kneading was difficult and messy the first time.  I recently tried doing most of the kneading in my stand mixer with a dough hook and then kneaded the rest by hand.  This made the dough much more manageable.  In the end, I added an extra 3/4 cup of flour (1/2 C flour in the stand mixer & 1/4 C while kneading by hand) but it still came out tender.  I baked it on the bottom rack on a preheated baking stone to get the bottom crispy and used corn meal to transfer from the peel instead of flour (a la Pizza Hut vs. Dominos).  Made 2 crusts.

Awesome pizza crust, and the dough makes great cinnamon rolls as well, just roll flat, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, roll up, slice up, and pack in a 13X9 pan that has the bottom coated with more cinnamon and sugar. Glaze with cream cheese icing and you have an awesome breakfast treat!

The recipe is good but the directions can be better.  
    On step three, before you put it into the oiled bowl place the ball on the counter and your hands on either side and just force the ball to travel in a circle on the counter until the ball is tight and completely smooth
  Put it in the bowl, cover it with plastic wrap (dont worry about making a seal) and put it in the FRIDGE
  Yes, I said it, in the fridge, yeast will continue to do its thing in the cold.
  Now leave it in there 12-18 hours, the dough will still double in size (for me it doubles in the fridge within 3 hours but I leave it in there longer to let the yeast develop more flavor)
  Take it out and cut the dough in half (two smaller pizzas are easier to toss in the air than one large one, but you don’t have to do that) flatten it with your hands, then fold it back onto itself and form a ball.  Roll the ball between your hands as before until it's tight, cover it with a damp kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes (the recipe said one, but that’s not enough)
  Stretch (dont use a rolling pin) or throw the pizza until it's the size you want (the outside will be higher and you'll get the rising lip that pizzas have) and bake it the same way the recipe calls for.  
  I use an insulated cookie sheet that is nonstick so I dont have to grease it up and I just build my pizza on that but if you have a pizza stone, use that or buy an unglazed ceramic tile for a few dollars and use that as a pizza stone.

Okay folks.  I've got to go with MONSIEUR BOEUF on this one.  This crust was just aweful.  I don't understand all the great reviews either.  It was tastless, didn't brown, and was so tough it was hard to chew.  Yuk!  I can cook, so I don't believe it was my error.  I will not make this again.

After you try this, you may want to throw away the numbers to Pizza Hut and Dominoes!  This is easy, tasty, and CHEAP.  You will get a thick crust (if you make one big pizza) without all the oil and grease.  Very healthy!  I was a little taken aback when I took the mixture out to knead it because it was very sticky.  I thought this was going to be another dough-attempt disaster!  But after a while, it gets better when adding more flour.  I would suggest you have another person there to help you sprinkle on the flour or a plate of it ready because your hands will be a mess.

This is a great pizza crust!  It's easy to make, is easy to work with and tastes awesome every time!  I make this recipe in my bread machine, which makes it even easier.
If you like thin crust, this recipe will yield 2 large pizzas.  I you only need 1, this recipe freezes like a dream!  After the dough rises and is ready to be rolled out, just divide in half, spray the spare half with a tiny bit of oil and then wrap in plastic wrap, place in a ziplock back and throw it in the freezer.  When you're ready to use it, take it out of the freezer 3-4 hours prior to use, unwrap it, and let it sit at room temp. or in a slightly warm spot to thaw and rise one more time.  Perfect!

This the first home-baked pizza crusts that satisfied the whole family.   It was just crunchy enough for the crunchers, and just chewy enough for the chewers.  Thanks Jay!

This recipe was good. Mylady, your yeast didn't activate. Check your water temperature and make sure no drafts are hitting the dough while it is rising. Also your oven temp may be too low.
Cooking and baking are 2 different arts, as candy making would be another.
Use this if you like a soft and spongey crust. I cut my dough in half and used one half for pizza and the other for bread sticks. The 'Way Too Easy' sauce recipe was perfect for the breadsticks!

Delicious and easy, especially since I let my bread machine do the hard part for me! One recipe made two crusts for me - used one, froze the dough for the other.  Rather than using a pizza pan I formed the dough right on the pizza peel sprinkled with corn meal and slid it in the oven onto the pizza stone.  Experienced breadmakers will know the measurement of flour is only a guide since so many factors, like humidity, are responsible for how much you'll ultimately use.  I don't usually use sugar in my pizza dough but this tiny bit of brown sugar couldn't have made a huge difference in either feeding the yeast or browning the crust. It must work its magic somehow, however, because this crust was excellent.

I have made this pizza crust several times, and it is definitely a favorite!  I've never made bread before, so it took a while to get used to the whole kneeding process (but it always tasted good!).  My husband asks for this as often as he thinks he can get away with... :).  Like others, we found the flavor lacking, so I've made the following modifications:
1.  Double the brown sugar
2.  Add 1/4 tsp of garlic powder in with the salt
3.  1 cup of whole wheat (to make it more healthy, it improves the texture also!)
4.  Added some parm. cheese while adding the flour.
5.  Make sure to use cornmeal on your pizza stone (pizza stone is a must, yummy!  $12 at Bed Bath and Beyond) so it doesn't stick.
6.  Cook crust for 6-7 minutes without toppings, then brush the edges with olive oil before adding topings.

We make this with pizza sauce III.  yummy!  Thanks Jay!!! :-)

This has been my pizza recipe for over 2 years now, and it is consistently wonderful. I usually add more brown sugar than called for, probably about a tablespoon or so. Also, the amount of flour needed can vary by the weather, so just start with three cups and add more as you're kneading, until the dough is no longer sticky. Initially, we used this to make 2 12" pizzas, but then I bought a 16" pan and now only make one 16" pizza. It makes the best medium-thick, chewy crust. If you haven't yet, try this recipe--You will love it!!

I enjoyed the pizza that I made with this crust.  It was very easy to make and yielded a good crust.  It did turn out a little dry though, I would suggest brushing it with oil and maybe sprinkling some salt on it before putting on toppings and baking.  It made me wonder why I order pizza so often when it is really easy to make it yourself!

Fabulous recipe. I warmed tha bowl of my stand mixer and followed step 1. After adding ingredients from step 2 I mixed the dough on speed 2 using the dough hook for 1 minute. Next I added the remaining flour and continued to mix on speed 2 for an additional 2 minutes. I then placed the dough in an oiled bowl to rise for about an hour as suggested. Besides using a stand mixer the only thing that I changed is the cooking temperature. I preheated the oven to 475 degrees and cooked the pizza for 10 minutes then turned the oven temp down to 425 to finish the cooking time. My husband commented that this was the best pizza that I have made. Thank you for sharing a great recipe and I hope this may help someof you who would like to use the mixer instead of good old fashioned elbow grease (like me)!

This made the most wonderful crust ever! Very crispy crust with a soft chewy center. Takes 1 packet of yeast...I stood there measuring and after I did I wondered why didn't the submitter just say 1 pkg? I'm not knowledgeable enough in breadmaking to have known that but I won't forget it now. I made 1 change and that was to add 3 cups of flour at once and then work in the last 1/3 cup during the kneading. Hubby and I both agreed this is THE BEST piza crust we have ever eaten. This made 4 12" thin and wonderfully crispy crusts. LOL, this was my second try at "real" pizza dough, so I felt brave and actually tried to spin it, hand toss it...it is an art, mine were so uneven and oddly shaped, but it was sure fun to try. Hubby got a kick out of watching. I need never try another recipe again, this one is the cat's meow as my DH said.

I am a beginner at bread making and this recipe turned out perfect. It was crispy on the outside and soft inside. Although, by the time had finished making the crust I had ended up using about 4 cups extra flour. This is an easy way to impress people with your baking abbilities.

This crust sets the standard! It is versatile enough to serve as a starting point for seasoned crusts, stuffed crust, etc., but awesome on its own! Having worked in the pizza industry in the northeast (the toughest market), I can honestly say this is the most like the crusts used by the pros. Thanks, Jason!

This crust turned out great! I did however increase the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon, with the original amount the crust came out tasting a bit yeasty.

The flavor is incredible...it is a bit messy (good stress relief to knead the dough :)  I've used this recipe twice...once for pizza and once for husband's pizza pockets (made enough for his lunches all week!) I keep a printed copy in my kitchen...thank you for sharing!!!!

Perfect crust for pizza.  I used 1 tsp of brown sugar instead of a half.  rubbed olive oil on outside crust and sprinkled garlic powder and basil...delicious!  
Update: this is my go to recipe whenever I make pizza...it's the best

This is the best pizza crust ever and it is easy to make! I bake it in a 14" cast iron skillet that I coat with 2 Tbs. of olive oil and the pizza crust comes out just like Pizza Hut's pan pizza. It is awesome! I use a pancake turner to slide the pizza out onto a pizza peel to cut. It is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Everybody loves it. This makes a great deep dish for crust lovers like me!

This pizza dough is great!  I am constantly making pizza and this is the dough I use the most when I have the time.  It is nice and crunchy on the outsaide and very soft on the inside, especially when made on a pizza stone.  Great job, Jay!

Pizza Hut recipe includes some corn meal  flour as well as baking soda in addition to the regular ingredients.
In order not to overcook the topping I bake crust first for about 7 min , add the topping and continue baking depending on topping till golden brown

Wonderful! I am a frequent pizza baker, and this has been exclaimed as my best.  I baked it on a pizza stone, and it gave the nice crisp base and chewy interior of professionally-baked pizzas.

I have been searching for a long time for a good pizza crust.  I have finally found it.  Simple and perfect. Crisp on the outside, just soft enough on the inside.

Finally a pizza crust that's thick and chewy! Delicious! I did sprinkle the crust with a little garlic powder, oregano, and Parmesan cheese before spreading on sauce and toppings. NOTE: Add more than 2 cups of flour before trying to mix until it's not 'sticky' as the instructions indicate. My hand's were covered in sticky dough until I added at least 3 1/2 cups total. I suggest at least 3 cups of flour before adding extra and kneeding. I also don't suggest pouring it on a 'well floured' surface. Just keep working with the dough in the bowl and it will save you a lot of hassle and clean-up.  NOTE: This should make about 4 medium sized pizzas. You can freeze the rest of the dough for up to 6 months. Just roll out 10" rounds onto well oiled parchment paper (make sure all sides of paper that touch the dough are well oiled. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap to store. When you're ready to use the dough, let it thaw 30 minutes on counter before topping and baking.

I had to add more like 5 1/2 cups of flour to get it to a consistency that could be kneaded.  If you like a very thick crust then it is not too bad.

This is FANTASTIC!!  I've made it a ton of times now and love it every time!  I have an el-cheapo standard pizza pan and this makes 2 crusts *that* size.  I generally use one and toss the other ball of dough in the freezer to enjoy at a later date.  I've never rolled the dough, I merely stretch and push it out to fit the pan, which I spray w/PAM and layer w/white corn meal.  I've also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and it's just as fantastic.  I do have to say, I've always had to use quite a bit more flour than the recipe calls for to get it elastic-like and non-sticky.  I use my KA mixer, using my scraper paddle first, then finishing w/the dough hook.THANK YOU, Jay, for sharing your signature pizza crust; LOVE IT!

If you like soft and chewy, this is the crust for you.  I used it for stuffed pizza in a 8x8, too much crust for that size.  I'll try 13x9 next.  Easy to stretch. Note: 2 1/4 t. of yeast is one packet

This crust is so good that I have been making pizza at least twice a week for the last month - seriously. I have used regular flour, bread flour, wholewheat flour - even tried some rye flour for one pizza. My favourite is the regular flour, but if you like the crust "doughy-chewy", go with bread flour and you will not be disappointed.

I halve this recipe to make one pizza. To make it even better, I like to add 1 tsp each of garlic powder and basil to the dough when I am adding the salt and oil. Sprinkle the oiled pizza pan with cornmeal. Once the toppings are on the pizza, stir a bit of garlic and basil into some oil and brush along the crust. Sprinkle that with cornmeal. Makes a super crispy crust that melts in your mouth.

wow this was awesome. My husband is a master at eating pizza, and when I asked him if I should change anything he said no it's great.  This was my first time making pizza crust. Thanks Jay.  It was enough to make 2 med. so i froze the other half of the dough, not sure if I was suppose to, but will find out when I use it next time..

I have never made pizza at home before, but, this recipe was super easy!  

The crust was nice and crusty, LOVED IT!  

I used a pizza stone and instead of rolling out the dough I "slapped" it out (little something I learned working for a restaraunt years ago).  No more pizza delivery for us, we are hooked.

I finally got around to trying this - it is the best pizza crust I've made!  I used my bread machine and let it rise in the machine - rolled out for my large pan with holes - it made a thicker type crust, very bubbly, next time I'll prick with a fork before baking.  I baked for 10 min at 475 and then topped it and baked till cheese was starting to brown.  Crispy on the outside and bottom and light and airy on the inside - thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Bakes very slowly, probably should pre-bake crust 10-15 min. before adding sauce and toppings. Will try again.

My whole family loved it and that's not an easy thing to do. I also liked that it wasn't hard to make. This is a must try recipe.

Very good and very easy.  This turned out better than any pizza dough I've tried, including those for the bread machine.

It's worth it to make this as opposed to a packaged mix. I finally mastered using yeast. My biggest trouble was getting it to rise enough. Now I put the bowl of dough on a heating pad and cover the bowl/pad with a towel. Does the trick every time!

Another note about this recipe... it is a LOT of dough for one pizza. It will easily make two smaller pies or one larger one. I often double the recipe and then cut my dough into fourths. I freeze three of the quarters before letting it rise. Then when I want one I just pull it out and let it thaw and rise over my heating pad. It is excellent.

A couple of the different pizzas I make are buffalo chicken, and ham with mushrooms. For the buffalo chicken I top the crust with a thin layer of light blue cheese dressing, then a light layer of hot sauce, then cooked chicken coated with hot sauce and a pizza blend cheese. For ham and mushroom, I use a very sweet pasta sauce and smoked provolone cheese... that smoked provolone is the secret to a fantastic pizza!

As many others have stated, this was a good recipe.  I also had to add a little extra flour, and also added alot of spices, such as italian seasonings, garlic powder, and parmesan cheese to the yeast mixture before adding the flour.  Without the extra flavorings, the dough was a little bland.  Otherwise, it was a good, easy recipe.

My family raved about this crust with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce.  They want this all the time now.  But, I have to say, sticky doesn't even begin to describe the dough! Next time I am definetly putting it in the bread machine on the dough cycle.

The best pizza crust I've ever made!  My fiancee raved about it and said there's no sense in ordering out for pizza anymore!  I made breadsticks with the leftover dough, baked them for about 10 - 15 minutes while waiting for the dough to rise on the pizza pan, brushed them with garlic butter and sprinkled with parmesean cheese, they came out great!  Try with the "Easy Pizza Sauce" recipe and serve the leftover sauce with the breadsticks!  Easy, Easy, Easy!!

This crust is excellent! It takes a while to cook, so watch your toppings to make sure they don't burn. We now make two at a time because it gets eaten so quickly.

Am I the only one who had a problem with the dough being way too soft? Maybe it's the flour I used, but 3 1/3 cups of flour to 1 1/2 cups of water made a sticky mess that was impossible to knead, much less roll out. I ended up adding a good 1 1/2 cups more of flour to get it workable. Aside from that it was a perfectly good standard pizza dough.

After using Allrecipes for years, I was finally motivated to register just so I could comment on this recipe.  I grew up in Chicago, and I am VERY picky about pizza crusts.

Thus far, we've only made this once (tonight!) but I can already see what amazing potential this recipe has.  I cut the recipe in half, and ended up only using 2/3rds of it to make my crust.  It still was not quite as thin as I prefer, but that was by choice since this was a first attempt.

I baked it on a pizza stone which I'd rubbed down with olive oil & pre-heated in a warm oven.  I also used garlic salt instead of salt, and added a bit of garlic powder (1/4t), onion powder (1/4t) & oregano (1/2t) and about 1/2t more olive oil.  I also brushed the crust with some melted butter & minced garlic.

I ended up using more flour than the halved recipe called for.  It's one of those things I think you have to sort of "eyeball."  You just know when it's right.

I believe this crust will make excellent deep dish pizza as well, and plan to try that next week.  I also plan to try using 1/4 of the full recipe to make a very thin crust pizza (think Giordano's or Aurelio's).

My family was very pleased with the results of tonight's adventure.  This was nowhere near as difficult as one might expect.  One more note:  I think it's necessary to use more sauce on the pie than one would normally expect, simply because of the nature of the dough.

I've been making this for a long time and don't know why I never rated it.  This is by far the best pizza crust I've ever tried!  The only tip I want to add is to get the perfect round pizza without tossing it.  I learned this a few years ago on the Food Network.  Shape your dough into a ball.  With your index and middle fingers, push down in the middle of the dough.  Then work your fingers in a circular rotation as the dough pushes out.  Keep doing this until dough is completely laid out.  If you're like me, you can't toss your crust and trying to get a nice round pizza with your hands, rolling pin, or whatever makes for an odd looking round pizza, then you will appreciate this tip.  At least I did!  :)  Hope that helps!

What happened?  I followed this recipe to the letter, and the "dough" came out like soup (I thought 1.5 cups of water was too much...).  Had to use way more flour - at least two more cups just to get it to a kneadable consistancy, then the dough was still too salty and lacked flavor.

This was my first try at making pizza crust.  I'm glad I picked this recipe!  My family loved it.  I used the easy pizza sauce recipe.  They went well together.  From now on, I'm making pizza at home.

This will be my pizza crust from now on, it is perfect, it is just as described, slightly crunchy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. I made one pizza and breadsticks smothered in garlic butter and everything was great! I do have to say that the breadsticks tasted even better the next day reheated in the oven. Thank you :)

This is a great pizza crust.  I do make some additions, such as semolina flour added to the flour (1/2 cup), I increase the broun sugar to 1 tsp, and salt 1 1/2 tsp.  I also use bread flour or Italian flour.  I add pizza seasoning to it.  These changes are just things I do to fit our tastes.  I've tried many other recipes, with the additions, but none as good as this one.

Yes! It is an outstanding crust, but it's not exactly rocket science.

This is essentially the recipe that came with my Oster bread making machine; I use it all the time and I do prepare it in the machine, it's a snap.

Whether you roll-it-out for the thin, crispy crust variety of pizza, or let it rise in a Chicago style pan for a thicker more olive oil infused crust, it works very well.

Oven heat is the key to good crust and savory pizza, that's why coal-fired and wood burning pizza ovens are so popular; you can get UP there in the 500 to 600 degree range.

It doesn't take too long, but the crust comes out with an out-of-this-world finish on it, especially when you do a focaccia, which is not hidden under any sauce and/or cheeses!

Stay hungry, my friends...

One of the best pizza crust recipes out there. I have made it several times, both with all-purpose, whole wheat, and a mixture of the two -- all are delicious. Use the listed flour amounts as a guideline; it changes every time depending on the climate, but generally I will need to add a few tablespoons or more extra flour per recipe and knead for 5-10 minutes to get it to a workable, elastic consistency. I make this the night before I need it, and allow it to slow-rise in the fridge. Remove from the fridge and let sit on a floured surface for ~20 minutes before rolling it out. It's great! Brush with olive oil and par-bake it for ~7-10 minutes at 450F before topping it and putting it back in the oven at 400F, and the bottom crisps up beautifully! Highly recommend.

Makes a good pizza crust. The exterior is crusty and the interior nice and chewy. I did not prebake my crust. Just added the ingrediants to it and slide it onto my pizza stone with the pizza paddle. I have another recipe similar to this one and will alternate and perfect them to our liking. Thanks for the post!

This has been my go to crust for years.  I sometimes add various herbs and spices to the crust but it's good as is as well.  Last night I got three different textured crusts out of this recipe.  I got a nice crisp crust rolling out dough thin  with lots of flour and cooking on stone positioned on lowest rack.  I got a "pan" style pizza by rolling out medium and placing in a cake pan lined with foil and coated with a  heavy tablespoon of evoo.   I got a thin but sturdy(not floppy) and soft crust by cooking on one of those pans with holes in it positioned on top rack. We were in pizza heaven.

Wow Jay, you've really done it!  This crust was really easy to make.  I didn't even have to toss it.  I just shaped it into the pan.

A word of warning: the dough is very sticky, and there's enough to make two pizzas.  I only made one pizza because I was too lazy to shape another one.  My crust was really thick, but next time I will make two.

The texture of the dough reminds me of Pillsbury dinner rolls: really dense with a hint of sweetness.  It wasn't crusty and crunchy like a traditional crust, but that might have been because my crust was thick.

I'm going to use this recipe to show off to my friends!  Fresh baked pizza tastes so much better than store bought.

This makes a very large crust, or can be divided into two smaller.  

I made this in my bread machine, and it came out really well.  This will be our go-to pizza crust recipe going forward.

Ok...this is a wonderful and easy to make pizza crust.  It can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days in a ziploc bag too, if you have extra dough, or just want to plan ahead.  Wonderfully easy and delicious crust and super easy to prepare!

Wow!  This is one of the most consistent recipes for pizza crust I have used.  Every time, the crust has the same consistency, texture, snap, and taste.  It has never let me down.
To this, I do add one caveat: I feel his oven temp. is too low. I bake at 500, preferably using a pizza stone, and for 8-10 minutes.  This gives a crispier crust than the original temperature, and has the mouthfeel of a crust from a fine quality pizza oven.

It was easy and good. I did 2 cups white/1 1/3 whole wheat (and it did take all the flour). I also added 1 tsp each of onion and garlic powder to the crust for a little flavor. I too divided it into 2 crusts. I prebaked 1 while the oven was preheating, then i did the second as our pizza. The first I froze for another time. I just came back to edit. I just used the frozen crust for a quick pizza and it was just as good as the first. I pre heated the crust on a stone for 12 minutes then added the sausge toppings and cheese and baked another 6-7 minutes... Just made it again and I still love it!!

This was great!!  I was soooo excited about trying this that I forgot to add the right amount of yeast and totally forgot the salt.  Well,  The second batch worked out fine I have pictures of the success on my homepage.  We did a 14" plain on a pizza stone, and a 11" pepperoni in a stoneware dish.  On the dish one, we sprinkled some parmesan, garlic, and rosemary and prebaked for a few minutes before adding the sauce, cheese, and Pepperoni. WOW is all I can say.  We will definitely be making this again and again and again and again................
Wow 3 days later and we made it again !! This time we did a white pizza.  My wife said that it was so good!

Well, Now I think I've used this recipe about 100 Times and it is by far the best.  Thick crust, Thin crust, with seasonings and without, white or red sauce it's all phenominal.  We were on vacation this summer with a total of 16 people, so I made 7 pizzas and 2 strombolis.  Pizzas with 4-5 toppings, double stuffed pizzas, you name it.  All told it cost me about $22 for all of the ingredients.  Hmmmmmmmm If I had bought all of those pizzas???  Probalby around $18 per pizza so $150ish?  great savings and you get the pizza YOU want.  I love this recipe !!! I'll be making 4 pizzas tonight for my son's birthday.  I'll post the pics !

WOW!!!!! The best homemade pizza dough, hands down!  I've made many homemade pizzas before, but none of them came out as delicious as this.  The dough was so soft and light; I couldn't believe it was homemade; the pizza doughs I've made in the past came out dense and bland. This is the only pizza dough recipe I will use from now on.

Excellent pizza crust!!!  We made one 13" pizza on our baking stone the first night and refrigerated the 2nd half of the dough.  The next night, I pulled the rest of the dough out and made another pizza.  It was just as wonderful!  By the way, I did take the suggestion of others and added some Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the dough.  YUMMY!

I've never been brave enough to try to make homemade pizza dough but thought I'd give this one a try.  Really good and nice and light, but there is a lot of work involved.  I first attempted to make it in my bread machine on the "dough" setting.  Came out really gooey.  Perhaps that is because I didn't let the yeast set first.  I remade it by hand and it came out fine, although I agree with other reviewers that it is quite sticky to work with.  I had to add quite a bit more flour.  Also, I only added 1/2 tsp. of salt and should have put the entire amount in.  It was a little flavorless.  I made 2 med. pizzas on pizza stones and stacked them in the oven.  The top crust didn't bake up quite right and was a little soft.  The next time, I will use the convection oven.

Easy to make!  Try it with your Kitchen Aid mixer using the dough hook attachment.  It's so easy and only takes two minutes to knead.  If you use a pizza stone you'll get superior results that remind me of a brick-oven pizzeria.  This is a soft, thick, bread-like crust with a crunchy exterior and chewy interior.  Tastes similar to DiGiorno's frozen pizza, but better (and cheaper!).  I recommend spicing up the crust with garlic powder, oregano, rosemary, or anything else you want to add.  This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  My kids love coming home from school to the smell of fresh homemade pizza.  I cut 2 fist-sized piece of dough off to make 2 personal-size pizzas.  I put the rest into a well-greased jelly roll pan.  This gives you a thick, tender crust. Make sure to let it sit before baking it (if not on stoneware) as it does make a difference.

I made this in my bread machine.  It was so easy and so good.  I added 3 T. of Lora Brody's dough relaxer so that it would be easier to roll out.  My first really successful attempt at pizza dough.  If you do bake it without toppings to freeze as another reviewer suggested, prick the dough with a fork first!  I had a pizza dough puff!  Ha ha.

My wife and I tried this recipe, and unfortunately it turned out, frankly, gross. We carefully followed the instructions, yet the crust turned out tasting raw and extremely doughy in the middle, and tough on the outside. Overall, we both do not understand how this recipe could have recieved such high reviews because it is just disgusting!!!! NO!

This was my first time trying this recipe out.I like that it is a very simple crust to make with items you probably already have on hand. There was enough dough to make two pizza crusts, one for a 16 inch pan and one for a 12 inch pan. The dough had a very nice consistency and was easy to roll out. I did not use a pizza stone, and based on other reviewers, I pre-baked my crust for five minutes before adding the sauce and toppings. I also brushed the crust with melted butter and garlic before I popped it in. I baked each pizza for 17 minutes once I put everything on it, and the crust came out beautifully. It was light and crispy underneath the pizza and slightly crispy, but soft inside around the edges. My only drawback with this crust is that it isn't very flavorful on its own, which is why I am so glad I decided to put that butter/garlic concoction on before I baked it! It's an easy problem to solve with just a pinch of various spices. Next time I think I will add minced garlic to the dough itself while mixing it. This is a keeper for me.

This has been my most successful crust. I use way more flour than calls for, just keep kneading it in until it feels right.

I have had this saved in my recipe box forever, but have been reluctant to try it, as I like my crust pretty thin.  Finally, I decided to try it out.  When adding the salt, I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of dried basil, parsley and tarragon.  After I punched down the dough and formed it into a ball, I put it in a Ziplock bag I had lightly coated in olive oil.  I put it in the fridge overnight, and pulled it out for dinner tonight.  I separated it into 2 portions, and rolled one out. ..I brushed Uncle John's  sauce liberally on the dough, put it on a pizza stone and baked it for about 8 minutes.  Then I pulled it out, topped it with homemade pesto sauce, slices of fresh mozzarella cheese (hint: to make perfect slices of fresh mozzarella, place it in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes- much easier to slice!), and fresh from the garden tomatoes.  The crust was a tad thicker than my normal preference, but I am not complaining.  To say this pizza was scrumptiously delectable would be a major understatement!  Thank you for sharing this recipe Mr. Sharp...truly a go-to, palate-pleasing winner :)

this recipe is perfect.  i made a double batch, let it rise the first time overnight, punched down the dough, then divided into 10 balls.  flattened each one to a 6-8 inch circle, then par baked at 400 for 5 minutes on a cookie sheet sprinkled with corn meal.  now i have a freezer full of individual pizza crusts, ready for toppings at a moments notice!  thanks for a great recipe!

Made this pizza crust tonight- followed all instructions exactly and this is the best crust I have ever had/made. As stated in the description, it is crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. It also cooked up wonderfully. This is definetly a recipe I will be reusing in the future. Thank you for sharing it!

This is a great base for your homemade pizza that tastes better than anything you can buy pre-made. I was looking for a recipe I could use to immitate the famouse SQUARE from Spumoni Gardens. And this is it. I can't count how many times I have already made this dough and it turns out wonderful every single time. I'm not baking this on a pizza stone, but since I'm putting the cheese first, the the sauce, the dough doesn't get soggy as well. With time I added a few things to fit our own taste such as a little garlic powder and some parmesan cheese - I think the cheese makes it even better but neverthelessthis this is a great basic recipe. As other reviewer already noticed I also need more flour - about 1 cup.

Great pizza crust! This is the first recipe I've used from this site that I didn't change any ingredients. I did let it rise a second time (about an hour the first time, slighty less the second rising.)  This is much better than my regular pizza crust recipe (I usually use the recipe from my KitchenAid cookbooklet.) I made this into two pizzas that fit perfectly on my pizza stones (if you're making one pizza from this recipe, it's going to be very thick.) The crusts were fluffy and crispy and just perfect!

My children request pizza every Friday. When I found this recipe I stopped buying pizza. This dough makes a huge crust and is delicious! I have made fruit pizza using this crust and it turns out very well too

Ok, to begin with, I followed every step of the recipe (used yeast that was just purchased from the store two days ago). I triple-checked measurements. My yeast proofed just fine. Everything was perfect until I came to the point in the recipe that said, "Turn dough out onto a clean, well floured surface..." HAHA. At that point, my "dough" was the consistency of pancake batter...literally. I had to add approximately four more cups of flour just to get to the sticky point. That was on top of the 2.5 cups of flour the recipe calls for adding to the mixture. I lost count on the cups of flour to get my dough to the NON-sticky point. The dough rose perfectly after about an hour it had doubled. I punched it down and allowed it to relax. I rolled it out. I had a 20 minute preheated 425F oven...allowed the dough to rise on my pizza pan before adding the toppings. I cooked it for 15-20 minutes as directed and ended up with white, dry bread with sauce, cheese & canadian bacon.

This recipe is promising...it was my first homemade pizza crust.  I was worried about the dough because I had to add an awful lot of flour to get it to not be sticky, and then after I let it rise it was really sticky again so I added a little more.  The recipe said if you're baking it on a pizza stone, you can go ahead and add ingredients and bake the pizza, but I really think I should have prebaked it a little.  My pizza was doughy on the bottom.  The crust had a good taste, so I will definitely try this one again, and prebake it next time.

Wow, excellent recipe, added 1 tsp of brown sugar instead of half. Easy, crispy and light inside. I rolled it out pretty thin on a big square cookie sheet, ended up with 16 pieces of pizza. I also brushed the dough with a mixture of olive oil, black pepper, oregano, crushed garlic and pizza spice then let it rise the last 20 min before adding the toppings and baking it for 15 min. Hands down the best homemade pizza I've made.

Great pizza crust! It really takes a total of 4 cups of flour to make it not sticky.  Use your Kitchen-Aide with the dough hook attachment and you won't even have to mix or kneed the dough at all!

This was my 1st time making pizza crust from scratch and it was super easy and tasted wonderful!  I followed the instructions in the recipe along with a  couple tips provided by other reveiwers:  1) instead of using regular salt, I used 1 tsp. of garlic salt; 2) I mixed in the following spices to the flour for additional flavor - 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. dried basil leaves, 1/2 tsp. onion powder; 3) After you roll out the dough, use a fork to puncture holes into it to allow even rising in the oven; 4) Pre-bake pizza crust alone for ~ 7 minutes on the lower oven rack so that it's crunchier on the bottom; 5) Remove crust and add a thin layer of pizza sauce & toppings and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

So tasty! I made the dough in my breadmaker: First put in the 'wet' ingredients (water,oil) then the salt & sugar and eny spices you'd like to add (I added some basil, oregano, and Parmesan cheese). Next, add the flour then make a little well in the flour, and add the yest into that well. Set the bread machine to the white dough cycle and press Start! I believe this recipe makes enough dough for 2 pizzas...this time I used my pizza stone & brushed the crust with the 'garlic juice' that is in the jar of minced garlic (before baking)...yum! Next time (with my leftover dough), I think I'll try making a deep-dish by baking the pizza in a cast-iron round dish. We all loved this crust, perfect! :D
PS- (sorry forgot to add)...if you want to make your dough in the bread machine, you're going to have to add much more flour (I ended up adding in about 1 cup more).

Not that this needs another great review-but it was such a success, that I have to chime in.  I used 1 Tbsp of brown sugar to proof the yeast (1pkt) and added some parm cheese, garlic and onion powder to the mix as I mixed in the flour.  I probably used a scant 3 cups and only kneaded for a couple of minutes to get the dough into a non-sticky ball.  I didn't want to overwork the dough and toughen it.  I used the whole dough in a 14 1/2 inch pan, let it rise again for about 10 minutes while I got the toppings ready.  I stuck the dough into the over for 7 miuntes, pulled it out, added all my toppings and cooked it for another 7 minutes -a total of 14 minutes.  THIS WAS THE BEST PIZZA WE'VE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!  I had never done a homemade crust before because I was a little scared of the whole yeast thing, but MAN, THIS WAS SOOO EASY AND SOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!! We'll never used prepared pizza crust again!  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!!!!!!

This was good (had for lunch, we made a cheese bread instead of using red sauce and other toppings), but I think I prefer my other fav pizza dough recipe---I just like the proportions better (fits nicely in my pizza stone). This makes ALOT of dough...but thanks for letting me time something different!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I just added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  I used my Kitchen Aid with the bread hook to mix at a 2 speed for two minutes and then at a 6 speed for eight minutes.  I found that the higher speed of kneading makes a huge difference in the stickiness of the dough.  The gluten needs to activate so that you don't have such a sticky dough (still some what sticky though).  I sprayed a glass bowl and my hands before I handled it.  It is much easier to work with that way.  Formed into a ball, covered with Saran wrap and I let it rise for an hour before I rolled it out and placed it on my pre-heated pizza stone.  Baked for 5 min.  Poked holes  and added toppings (prego traditional sauce, mozzerela cheese, olives, and pepperoni).  Baked for an additional 10 min and I had a very yummy pizza that my family loves!  I think that this would make great breadsticks as well.  I will have to experiment.  Thanks so much!!

Looking for that perfect dough for your Calzones? Search no further. I only make this for my calzones and divide the dough into 12 portions. I fill with provolone, Italian sausage, sandwich pepperoni, sliced red & yellow peppers and onions. Kids and Hubby make this 5 stars.

Since this has received so many good reviews, I'm going to hope that my just so so results were due to user error and not the recipe.  I had to add a lot more flour to the mixture in order to handle it at all, and I agree with others, the crust was too thick for one pizza and next time I'll make two.  The crust also seemed a little bland and dense -- since it was my first time, I wanted to stick to the recipe but if I do it again I'll add more garlic salt, herbs, parmesan, etc.

The texture of this pizza crust is very good and was my favorite until I tried Ricardo's from this site (it's the best I've ever had). I'd say this definitely makes 2 large crusts though... I like thick crust, but good grief!

When Jay says this makes one giant pizza he was not kidding.  I didn't pay attention to that part and made one large out of the dough.  I should have divided it in half.  It was too much dough, and even after 35 minutes was underdone in the center.  It was however very good on the edges.  The dough is chewy inside, but really nice and crunchy on the outside.  I will use this recipe again, only use the dough to make two pizzas.

Great crust!! As good as Pizza Hut! I have a couple of tips though- oil your stone and sprinkle cornmeal on it, then put on the crust. I brushed the crust with olive oil and sprinkled on some garlic salt, then baked about 10 min before adding toppings. Also, I used about 1 tablespoon of sugar.  And if you want stuffed crust, roll string cheese sticks into the edge- worked very well.

I'm thankful it was edible, but it wasn't a great crust and was rather disappointing. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but it was very cake-like in texture and didn't brown. I like a crisp, chewy crust, but this was more like cake. I'll try another recipe next time.

Excellent!  I baked on a pizza stone at 425 for roughly 20 minutes.  I baked the first two pizza crusts for 10 minutes prior to adding sauce/toppings.  The last one I put the dough on the hot stone and added toppings then baked.  It was just as good.  No need to pre-bake.  I did pierce the dough with a fork before adding toppings.  Also used cornmeal on the stone and added onion powder, Italian seasoning, and garlic to the dough with the salt.  

It was excellent and I will continue to use this dough.  It baked crisp and chewy.

I add parmesan, italian seasoning, garlic powder and salt. I make it the day before and put it in a oiled, covered bowl in the fridge overnight. The slow rise/fermentation makes it taste better and aids in a brown crust.

This is the best pizza crust I ever made...one of the guys was bragging on my pizza to the rest of the ranch! It makes two large crusts, and I also use a stone...it goes together and mine rises fast, so its a quick, easy meal for us!Now...if i could only find a recipe for the cheesy bread.....

Great flavor but the proportions are a bit "off". I don't know if it's a typo but maybe it should read "1 cup water". Pizza dough is often 1 part water and 3 parts flour. The yeast solution needs to foam to see whether or not the yeast activated. Also, try adding 3 tablespoons vital wheat gluten for a fluffier crust or bread flour instead of all purpose. I also used a pizza stone at the bottom rack of the oven. Overall, good recipe!!

This is the only pizza crust recipe I use.  3 1/3 c. flour is not enough flour, unless you do 3 1/3 cup packed flour.  I usually up mine to about 4c. flour (measured by weight or by spooning flour into a measuring cup).  I throw everything into the bread machine on the dough setting and omit the oil.

I have used this with whole wheat flour or white whole wheat flour, and prefer the texture to AP flour or bread flour.  (However, the dough does not rise as much with whole wheat flour.)  I pre-bake the crust (after you roll out the dough, poke the crust with a fork a few times otherwise you'll have bubbles baked into the crust) for about 10 minutes and then add sauce and toppings.  I use a pizza stone unless I'm making chicago style deep dish...then I use a cast iron pan.

This is an awesome recipe!!!  The key to good pizza making is the pizza stone.  I have always put together the pizza on an aluminum pan then put it in the oven.  The correct way is to heat up a pizza stone in the oven for 20 mins. at 450 degrees.  Assemble the pizza on a wooden pizza shovel.  Then gently shovel the pizza onto the heated stone in the oven.  The pizza comes out like a gourmet restaurant pizza.  This recipe is good becuase the crust is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This is almost the exact recipe as the one that can with my stand mixer.  Only difference is the brown sugar.  I have not put brown sugar in my crust but it is a great recipe without it.  For crispy thin crust pizza, roll it out really thin and prebake for 5 or 6 minutes.  Put plenty of corn meal on baking sheet so it does not stick.

Then put the sauce on soon as it comes out of the oven.  When you bake the pizza, slide it on the oven rack without the cookie sheet.  Bake pizza at 425 for 8-9 minutes.  Result is great!  I've shared my pizza with 7 people and now they keep asking when they can come over for more.  Share at your own risk.

I've made this a few times now and every time it's awesome!  I made pizza last night with this recipe and the pizza "crust" was HUGE!  I brushed it before baking and after with melted butter and garlic powder and it was like having garlic breadsticks with out pizza.  I used the "exquisite pizza sauce" recipe from this site as well and used the left over sauce to dip the crust in.  I divided the pizza into four different topping types so that everyone got just what they wanted.  It was ten times better than any delivery we could have had and probably ten times cheaper!  I did add a little garlic powder to the dough and a touch more sugar and salt.

This was a first for me although I have been cooking for 40 years I never have made my own pizza dough.  My Dad used to make his own pizza's for parties often, so I figured I would give this a try.  I did roll it out very thin making two pizzas.  Added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the flour.  Living in Colorado was a little cool out so put the dough in the laundry room on the washing machine and turned the dryer on, closed the door and it rised to perfection.  The bottom of the crust didn't get as crisp as I would like but that is due to figuring out the right temp and time for my oven and high altitude not the recipe.  Had a great taste, was very easy to work with, and offered a very pleasant experience for my first pizza dough!  Thank you for this submission!

Awesome!  Shortcut for those who have little time!!!!  Prepare dough in the morning before you leave for work, turning olive oil side up to rise.  When you get home, it will be the ready for you to dress it up with all of your favorite pizza ingredients!  In addition to that...you could always add Italian seasoning, seeds, or fresh cheese to the dough for another variation.

I've made this recipe many times since I first found it.  It's the only recipe I use for pizza crust anymore! I've made it with white flour, half white and half whole wheat, and white whole wheat flours, on a pizza stone or a baking pan, with garlic and herbs and plain - and it's been great every time.  I use a KitchenAid mixer and it makes it a snap.  I do find that I need to use a little more than 4 cups of flour, though, to make a dough that isn't sticky.  It freezes well - I usually divide the dough in half, wrap one half in freezer paper and put in a zipper bag and then freeze.

Fantastic crust recipe.  This is about the 4th or 5th pizza crust recipe from this site I have tried and it is by far the best.  I just made it for the first time, and OHHHH MAN!!!!  I used 1/3 of the dough and put it in my cast iron pan and made cheesesticks out of it and used the remaining 2/3 dough to make my pizza.  Just pulled the cheesesticks out and it just melts in your mouth!  YUMMY!  Staple Friday night recipe from now on.  Thank you soooo much!  I did dust both pizza pans with a little cornmeal to add texture to the bottom of the crust.

I can't give it a five-star rating since I don't really know what /great/ pizza crust tastes like. Otherwise, it was easy to make. Made two thin 14" crusts or one thicker 16" crust. If you're pressed for time/space/motivation, don't bother kneading it and just add the full amount of flour all at once. It hasn't seemed to make any difference to me how I add the flour.

I scaled the recipe to 8 servings, followed the instructions (doubled checked after), but the dough would not rise for me.  Threw it away.  Obviously it works as so many have done it successfully, so I'm not sure why I couldn't do it

We have not ordered pizza delivery a single time since I started using this recipe. The crust is so versatile, and I've added different herbs to it (rosemary, basil, oregano) with great results each time. Sometimes I cut the recipe in half for one regular size pizza, but mostly I make the entire recipe and save half, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap while still in dough form, for up to 2 days.  You can make two pizzas with the recipe, and I've found that if you pat out the dough out into your circle of crust and let it sit for about an hour at room temp before adding your toppings and baking, the dough rises perfectly and develops the nicest crisp crust while staying chewy and soft inside.  This recipe is THE BEST!

I make this at least once a month. My husband's friends are so envious that they don't get "home made" pizza like he does. I don't agree with those who say it's "bland". In my opinion pizza crust is supposed to taste like bread (which this does!)not all kinds of seasonings, that's what your topping is for! I usually let my batch rise twice for a more developed flavor to the dough. Just punch it down after the first rising and put it back in the oiled bowl, cover and let rise until double again. I have found that baking for 15 minutes at 500°F makes a perfectly baked crust on my perforated aluminum pizza pan.

We eat a lot of pizza and I wanted to try another recipe and this was a winner with everyone at my house.  I did add 1 tsp. italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp. each of onion salt and garlic pwdr., and 3 Tbsp. parmesean cheese to dry ingredients before mixing. I took others advice and divided this into 2 balls of dough after it rose and they filled 2 14" air bake pizza pans. The crusts rose 15 min. after I brushed a garlic/butter mixture over it. Then I added toppings and everything turned out great.  It was easy, taste and texture were great-there were no leftovers.

I will stick to our favorite recipe. The KEY to great pizza dough is HI-GLUTEN FLOUR [13% protien or higher], an overnight proofing, and a pizza stone or pizza screen.

I added italian seasoning, basil, and parmesean cheese as others suggested. I also substituted one cup of wheat flour. I cheated and used the dough cycle of my bread machine for this and it worked great.

I love this recipe.  My first batch was a little sticky but tasted fine.  I add 1/2 tsp more brown sugar, dust my stone with a little corn meal, and mix about 3 Cups of the flour in before kneading in the rest. I bake the crust 5 minutes or so before adding sauce and toppings so I don't get a soggy crust. I also made it into breadsticks and brushed garlic,parmesan butter over the top! Excellent!

Just as the other reviewers noted, this recipe yields 2 medium-sized pizzas.  I served both pies tonight to 4 people and no one left hungry.  This crust got rave reviews and was very easy to make (1st time dough-maker here!).  It cooked up in 15 minutes on a 14" stone that was preheated at 425 deg C for 1 hr.  Like many have noted, I also used close to 4 c of flour.  Being a novice at this, after I cut the dough into two portions, I wrapped them each in wax paper and stored in the fridge.  BIG MISTAKE-- the dough stuck like glue to the paper and was nearly impossible to remove (I lost a lot of dough in the process).  Just passing on this info to possibly help other cooks out there avoid this painful experience.  Also, don't be stingy with the corn meal (on the stone and peel or any surface where you prepare the topped pie)...it makes a big difference.  Thanks Jason!

My husband and I have tried MANY different pizza crust recipes, and this one was the very BEST!  This was so delicious.  Unlike usual, we did not make any changes except making two medium sized pizzas instead of one big one.

This crust is fantastic!! I used it to make calzones this weekend and they came out perfect.  I was able to make 2 good sized calzone.  The dough rolls out so easily and bakes to a crispy outside and chewy on the inside! You have to try this! you will never buy dough in the store again!

Jay!!!  Fantastico!!!  I followed your directions to a "t" and found that (pastry chef here) it came to a better dough by using 3 cups of flour initially and then adding on till the stickiness left. I put the dough in the freezer for 2 minutes at the "resting" phase, then rolled it out (half though, half later - froze the other half and will make another pizza tomorrow). Toppings are running through my head now!!!  Girlfriend loved it too,, her own words "that crust was incredible".  Kudos!!!!

Pizza Hut thick crust pizza dough, if you like thick crust pizza then this is for you. Can make in a bread machine but put at least 4.5 cups flour for consistency to make 2-14 inch pizzas.

I'm in LOVE  with this pizza dough!  You cannot get better pizza at a restaurant than using this and making your own pizza.  I've also made breadsticks from this and everyone in my family agrees they are amazing!  for breadsticks, I just roll the dough into small logs and bake until just a light brown. Then I spread melted garlic butter over them with a few sprinkles of Parmesan cheese and they are the best!

My girlfriend makes this pizza crust for us often, and although I have tried dozens of different pizzas, this is the best!  She tweaks it with rosemary and garlic in the crust which makes it even more amazing.  Topped in the photo with moose burger, mozzarella, hot Italian sausage, feta cheese and pickled jalapenos.  PERFECTO.
Makes us two large pizzas, which is great because one is never enough!

As a Chicago pizza snob, I never buy frozen pizzas and rarely eat at any national pizza chains so my homemade pizza has some big shoes to fill.  This crust, while better than others, doesn't stop my search for a go-to pizza crust recipe.  It just doesn't have the chewiness that it promised and is a bit bland.  After making it a few times, I prefer it with added spice per other reviewers' suggestions (I add 1t Italian seasoning, 1/4t garlic powder, and increase sugar to 1T).  Maybe it depends on pan size/thickness, but it doesn't need pre-baking to cook through (and my try at pre-baking just made it drier) as been suggested.  I have a feeling the crust I crave needs a lot more oil (which negates the healthier homemade version I'm going for so haven't experimented with that yet), bread flour instead of all-purpose, and a pizza stone.  Overall, this is a good crust that I'll make occasionally until I find my perfect recipe.

Loved how easy this pizza dough was made. I pre-cooked the dough before making the pizza, but next time, I might try the recipe without the pre-cook.

This crust turns out perfect every time!  I increase the serving size to 20 and that gives me enough dough for two pizzas  (two regular pizza stones)  I divide the dough in two and roll out while the stones are preheating.  I assemble the pizzas on the preheated stones.  All ovens are different so just check bottoms until they are done to your liking.

Oh My Goodness! This was soooo good. I didn't change not one ingredient. I used my bread machine to do all the kneading and rising. I then did the final punch, turned it out gave it a little dusting with flour kneaded it twice and shaped it to fit my pizza stone that i pre-heated. I let it sit on the hot stone a few minutes to let the heat penetrate through the dough a little. I spread some pizza sauce on it then topped it with bacon, grilled chicken, salami, roasted red onion, red, green and yellow bell peppers and a lot of cheese. It was done in 20 minutes. Thanks Jason for a truly top notch recipe!

This was very good.  I used 1/5 tsp of brown sugar and that was all I changed. (just wanted to give the yeast a bit more to feed off).  It rose up really nicely.  I made 1 large rectangular pizza with it, cooked on stoneware.   It was crispy on the outside, and soft in the middle and had really good flavour.

Thanks Jason, you just put a big dent in the frozen pizza sales.  I'll never buy a frozen pizza again. The only thing i do differently is... I usually mix this in the dough cycle in my bread maker.  The dough was coming out a little bit too wet for me so i use about  1/3 cups more flour.  other then that it's just great!!!

Pretty good. I split into about 6 mini personal pizzas. I also added seasoning (basil, oregano, marjoram, garlic powder, and onion powder). Only thing I would have changed is to add more salt. We'll probably use this again.

This pizza crust was awesome and so easy to make.  I made home-made pizzas last night for a couple friends (my first time making pizza) and everyone raved about the crust.  It was 100% better than any store-bought pizza dough.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is a great crust.  Instead of using oil in the pans I sprayed them with cooking spray, and then dusted with corn meal flour. I also did what other folks have said and pre-baked the crusts for 10 minutes prior to topping. By doubling the batch it yielded two large cookie sheet size rectangle pizzas that tasted just like they were from a Pizza Joint.

Solid.  I used a stand mixer w/ dough hook.  Put salt and flour in mixing bowl and then poured yeast/oil/sugar mixture in.  I think I used about 4 cups flour. Kitchenaid did most of the kneading.  If you want more flavor, you could certainly add some herbs and/or spices but the original recipe is just fine as-is.

I've made this several times now and it has come out perfectly every time.  I mix it in my kitchenaid mixer. And, tonight we rolled it out and cooked the crust on the grill, adding toppings after we flipped it.  It was fabulous!

Second pizza crust I've ever made.  Delicious!  I added a ton of italian seasonings as well.  Our pizza needed a lot more time to cook (that may just be our oven).  Would love to invest in a pizza stone!

i ended up with 2 9" cake pan pizza'a(1 thick and 1 thin) and one large thin crust pie. the only difference was that i added 3 ounces of extra virgin olive oil to the cake pan pizza's which give that effect of pizza hut pizza. i also par baked the crusts for 5 minutes before adding sauce and toppings. these pizzas were excellent and definitely were similar to pizza hut pizza. thank u sooooo much for sharing this recipe it will definitely be used in our household many times. great job!

This pizza crust would probably be excellent if I had divided the dough and made two smaller pizzas, but I made one large pizza and it was WAY, WAY too doughy. If you follow the directions and bake at 425 for 20 minutes, the cheese would burn. I added my toppings when there were about 12 minutes left. Overall, it was pretty good, just too much "crust" for my taste. My family didn't like it either.

Excellent. I took another reviewers suggestion and added some seasonings to the crust. With the salt and the olive oil I added 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. Then while I was mixing in the flower I added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. I shaped the dough into two harts for valentines day dinner, and my husband loved it. This will definitely be my standard pizza dough recipe!

Ten stars. This is a fantastic recipe. Make just as written. It's perfect. Soft on the inside and crisp on the outside just as promised, it was also very easy to handle. I often have a problem with pizza crust sticking to the pan, but this one released no problem. The recipe made two 12" pies. My search for the perfect pizza crust is over. Thank you!!

This was great.  Makes alot.  Would make two pizzas next time, I want it thin.  Flavoring the crust is also a good idea, will try that next time too.  Over all just GREAT.

Very easy to make in a short amount of time which is a bonus for this busy mom of a toddler.  The first  time I made it just as the recipe said and it was wonderful.  The second time I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder and it was a huge hit with the rest of the family.  We found it so much more filling than store bought doughs.  Even reheated the next day the dough was tender and tasty.  We will definately be using this recipe on a regular basis.

This dough was pretty quick to make and easy to work with.  I replaced one cup of flour with whole wheat flour.  I rolled the dough as thin as I could into a rectangle, topped with veggies (sauteed briefly to remove excess water) then rolled the long edge jelly-roll style and sealed the edges.  I placed on a baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal and brushed the top with a wash of egg yolk and water for a shiny surface.  I baked at 350 F for 20 minutes, brushed with more egg wash then baked for another 15 minutes.  My family enjoyed it although we all agreed the dough could probably use a little more salt.  The amount of dough made a very large pizza roll, so I will probably divide into two next time.

This easily makes 2 medium pizzas, I halved it and made a generously sized single medium pizza.  It has a chewy texture, and slightly crispy.  It tastes like a pan tossed crust, which i really like.  I cooked my crust for 10 minutes (would add another 5 min), after it rose for 20 min, on the 2nd to lowest rack; i am glad i did, because otherwise it would have been doughy in the middle after the normal baking time.  Next time I am going to lower the oven temp a little bit, as the cheese got a lil too brown around the edges.  I brushed the crust with a garlic butter to give it a little flavor.  Will make again and again for my pizza loving hubby!

I prepared this recipe exactly with no additions or subtractions. I put my dough on a cookie sheet and baked it at 425 on the lowest rack for about 10 minutes to crisp up the bottom before I put the toppings on. After assembling the toppings and baking, I ended up broiling the pizza for a few minutes at the end to get the cheese browned. It was great. Loved the crispy/chewy texture. Next time I might add some herbs and spices to the dough. Definitely will use the recipe over and over.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, except that I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose white flour. The crust turned out tender and "fluffy" and delicious! I wanted to do a "seafood" pizza, so made an Alfredo sauce and then topped the pizza with mozzarella, cheddar, crab, shrimp, pineapple and green onion and it was outstanding! I've tried many of the pizza crust recipes on this website, but this one is definitely my favorite!  Thanks, Jay!

Good, easy and makes a generous amount. I have also added half whole wheat flour and got good results.  I usually use about a third of this recipe and press it into a 9 inch cake pan to make "pan crust" pizza and then press the rest into a jelly roll pan for a thinner crust. I oil the pans well and dust with cornmeal.

THIS is the pizza dough I have been looking for!  It is light and chewy and just perfectly crispy on the outside.  I have made several homemade varieties of pizza dough but this is my new ONLY one.  I made 2/3 of a recipe (changed the servings to 10) subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, tripled the brown sugar and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I rolled the dough out to fit a jelly roll pan and it was perfect.  I have not ever let the dough rise on the pan before, maybe that was the key?

Cooked a large pizza on stone, and crust was a bit thick, especially around the edges.  Next time I will make two pizzas out of it.  Everyone liked the flavor though, even my toddler ate some mushroom pizza with this crust!

The recipe as written creates a very wet dough that you have to add a lot of flour to to knead (i let it rise while it was still a little sticky).  It baked up into a very thick crust, but everyone in my house liked it.  I tried it again with just a garlic butter topping to go with pasta, this time using less water.  It was too dense and floury that way- make it as written.

Delicious!!  I couldn't have made a better pizza!  I didn't use very fancy ingredients, simply shredded cheese, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and chopped sausages.  It turned out so heavenly - the crust was a bit crispy on the outside, and soft and chewy on the inside!  Even the leftovers, which I reheated in my toaster oven, came out great!  I did make a few changes, though, such as pre-baking the dough for about 7 minutes.  I suggest pre-baking for 10 minutes though, because my crust near the middle still came out a teensy bit raw.

Very good. I made exactly as instructed except for substituting freshly ground whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. It turned out great. I made one batch for a very thick crusted pizza. I made a second batch into bread sticks. For the bread sticks, I rolled to dough out onto a rectangle shaped pan, brushed olive oil and sprinkled dried garlic on top, cut it into bread stick sized pieces with a pizza cutter then twisted each piece to make it look more interesting. I would make both the pizza and bread sticks again.

Look no further.... this is the BEST pizza crust you can make.  I followed the recipe exactly and included a reviewer tip of pre-warming my mixing bowl.  I put my large bowl in a pan of warm water (110 degrees) to equilibrate.  Then I put the brown sugar and yeast inside the bowl and added the 1 and 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees) by slowly pouring it down the side of the bowl.  The yeast dissolved very quickly but I did let it rest for 10 minutes before adding the salt and oil.  I added the flour slowly.   Keep in mind that the amount of flour it takes varies with the temperature and humidity but mine was close to that in the recipe.  I hand kneeded it until it was no longer sticky.  It took mine about 2 hours to double (that can vary due to the age of the yeast).  When it was ready, it was sooo easy to roll out and stretch.  I got two 14 inch pizzas.  I made Easy Pizza Sauce I and added cheese, pepperoni, and family favorite toppings.  Tasted fantastic.  Thanks, Jay!!

I've been using this " no fail" pizza dough recipe for a few years.  I have a big family and we all like thin crust.  I scale the recipe to 22 servings and I get 4 medium sized pizzas and a calzone to use up the rest of my ingredients.  I used a pizza stone in the early days and have now switched to the to cheap non-stick pizza pans, generously doused with olive oil, and the results are amazing. Love this recipe.  We use it every Friday night for our family pizza night.

This was my first attempt at homemade pizza crust and it was SO easy and delicious!! I added Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, and grated Parmesan cheese to the flour for more flavor. I used the dough hook attachment for my KitchenAid mixer to kneed the dough-- so quick and easy! *Be careful about the temperature of the water when mixing with the yeast- I accidentally killed my yeast once because the water was too hot and it was so frustrating!*

I wish I could make this recipe work. I have tried three times and with different yeast and I am exacerbated that out of so many amazing reviews I cannot make this pizza crust. I'm a failure. Every time it comes out chewy/hard and blah.

Produces a lovely dough to work with but I think I will increase the salt and perhaps add garlic or herbs next time for a less bland final product. Texture was right on for thick, deep-dish style crust. *How much flour you'll ultimately end up adding depends on the temperature and humidity of your location and kitchen. *To check for accurate water temperature for proofing the yeast use a candy thermometer.

AWESOME. I GRILL IT. DON'T OIL IT. THE FLOUR KEEPS IT FROM STICKING. IF IT BURNS ITS OK. IT ACTUALLY TASTES BETTER WHEN IT IS WELL DONE. ONCE GRILLED, MAKE PIZZA ARE USUAL AND BAKE IN OVEN.

"Fantabulous" (fantastic and fabulous)!!  This was my 1st try at making pizza.  Had my fingers (and toes) crossed in apprehension but the pizza turned out very nice.  Loved the texture of the crust. My family prefers thicker/softer crust and this suited them to a T as I rolled the crust thicker!  My grateful Thanks to Jason and Allrecipes!

Made this recipe twice, the first time I did it exact to the recipe and the second time I substitued half of the flour with whole wheat. I really enjoyed it both times, but the whole wheat was my favorite because it gives the crust a little more of a 'hearty' flavour. I rolled two thin crust which still baked up to a nice crispy soft combo. This is our new pizza recipe, no more ordering out for us!!!

AMAZING! If you love deep dish/pizza hut pan pizza's you need to try this. Only changes: 
1. Add garlic powder, onion powder, etc
 the crust is a little bland
2. I needed a lot more flour (an additional cup)

Yum! :) thanks so much for posting this!

As if you need more reviews, but I couldn't resist. I've been using this recipe for several months and everybody wants the recipe.  I roll it out on corn meal, add my favorite topping and bake it on my stone and everyone is asking for my pizza rather than take out.  That makes my day!

This dough is delicious and very easy to make and work with.  We made our pizza on the grill and it was awesome.  The dough will not stick when placed directly on the grill.  Bake one side for 5 minutes or so(when you see it start to bubble) then flip it, brush with olive oil and add your toppings!!

I've been playing around with different crusts for quite a while and have never found one that I've been thrilled with...until now.

I don't use a pizza stone but instead use a 16" perforated pizza pan (I found mine at Kohl's) that works great as it allows hot air to circulate through the bottom.  If you weren't using one of these or a stone, you'll probably need to precook the crust for about 10 minutes before adding toppings or it will most likely be doughy in the middle.  If you have a stone or a perforated pan then no worries...add toppings to uncooked dough.  If you're using a smaller pan, this is enough for two pizzas, if using a large pan, this is the perfect amount for a 16" pan-style pizza.

The only change I made to this recipe was substituting the all-purpose flour with the same amount of bread flour (high gluten).  I haven't made it with all-purpose flour but with bread flour, it's definitely soft and chewy with a crispy crust. Be sure to have some honey on hand to eat with the outer crust; if you live in Colorado and have ever been to Beau Jo's, you know what I'm talking about and this crust is extremely close to what they make.

My wife and I had fun making a pizza today and definitely enjoyed the fruits of our labors with a great spicy Italian sausage and onion pizza.  Enjoy!!!

This is a great recipe but even better with a few changes.  I used my mixer with the hook attachment and it was so easy.  I did double the surgar and subed 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  Sugar for taste and wheat flour for texture.  After kneeding I oiled the same mixing bowl and let it rise twice for an hour each and pounded back down.  Preheat to 425 with pizza stone in oven, this is a must!!  Roll out with corn meal on a pizza peel so dough will slide easily.  Top how you like and slide in oven on stone for about 15 min.  With 5 min left I brushed some melted butter around outside edge.  Turned out awesome and this is the only recipe I use now.

This is my favorite recipe for pizza crust. I do alter alot though. I add garlic and rosemary in with the oil and use 2 cups of wheat flour and only 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour.

Excellent pizza crust recipe!!!  I made these up ahead of time and baked them. . .kind of like Bobolli. . .and they were great!  What a fast treat to pull a frozen pizza crust out of the freezer and top it with what you are in the mood for!  Just bake!  I also made some personal size so my kids could make pizzas on their own without all the hassle. . .just included some frozen grated mozarella in a bag next to the pizza crusts.

This is a great recipe if you like thick pizzas. And we do! I don't understand the complaints about the crust being bland since, to me, pizza crust isn't suppose to have any special taste... Maybe American pizzas are different from Européan pizzas! :) Anyway, this is a base recipe and you can add any spices you want: try thyme, oregano, garlic powder...

We are pretty amateur when it comes to cooking and this was DELICIOUS! This tasted just like my parent's dough they used to make. We were a little worried at first because we had to add SOO much flour in order for it to not be sticky. I think next time we'll just add less water, maybe. And we didn't have a rolling pin so it looked a little strange, but everything turned out fine. WAY better than ordering out or store-bought. Be prepared though to spend some time in the kitchen if you're new at this.

This is perfect pizza dough. I did use 1 cup of whole wheat flour in the recipe, and mixed in enough white flour until not sticky (it was a little more flour for me than in the recipe). I let it rise (it rose up beautifully), then put it in the fridge overnight before baking. I had enough crust for two BIG pizzas - could have even made three! I will never buy those trader joe's doughs again! This was flavorful all on it's own, and also when I brushed olive oil and garlic powder on the partially baked crust. YUM.

The best homeade pizza crust I have ever had! I made it quite I few times and the last few I added more brown sugar, about 2T, and I thought it was even better. I made it in the morning, let it rise, prepared the crusts, and then I put them in the fridge until I baked them for dinner. It raised perfectly and had a nice texture to it.

I have tried quite a few recipes for pizza crust in my bread machine....always dissapointed I gave up... When I took this one out of the machine and started working with it, I knew it was "different". It glided through my hands like silk. I used half a recipe and got a medium-thin crust 12 inch pizza. Great texture and taste!  I like to prebake the crust for 3 minutes, then add the sauce and cheese and bake it for about 10 more minutes at 500 degrees.  I've played with tempertures from 425-450-475.  500 gets the pizza more evenly cooked and keeps it from getting soggy.

I was disappointed with the way the crust turned out. I followed this recipe exactly as it was written. The dough didn't rise. After it was cooked the inside was raw and the outside wasn't crusty. If there are any tips or tricks, please let me know. From the reviews I read, it sounds like it should have turned out excellent.

Prepared exactly per recipe and turned out perfect. I simply made breadsticks out of it instead of pizza by sprinkling italian seasoning, parmesean cheese, garlic salt over melted butter. Cut in approximately 1" slices and dipped in pasta sauce  or garlic butter. Kids really enjoyed them!

Well, this wasn't good. I tried this recipe three times and none of the times did this recipe turn out good. 425 is a mistake. I've never heard of a pizza recipe baked at such low temps before. It's always baked at 500 degrees. According to a friend of mine who is a chef and a baker, the 500 degree temp gives pizza that perfect crust. He outta know, he makes the best pizza in town. Even after 20 minutes the crust on this recipe never got golden brown. Not to mention, the pizza had no flavor either. It was pretty bland. My husband liked everything about the pizza except for the crust. He only took one bite and didn't want anymore. I can't blame him it was like white bread with sauce and cheese on top. I hate to say it, but I would've been better off buying a store-bought pizza than wasting all my money on this... even Totino's would've been better than this. I should've stuck with Ricardo's version. I just thought I'd try this one based on all the rave reviews. Next time I will head the bad reviews before I waste my money.

I love this pizza crust! I've made it   numerous times and it always turns out great. I have experimented with other pizza crust recipes and my husband and I both agree this one is the best. I am done trying other recipes, this is the one I will use from now on. Also works well with a stand mixer and the dough hook attachment on low, your hands don't get as sticky.

this is a great pizza crust and easy to make, the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the flour amount needs to be adjusted( I used well over the 3 1/3 cups called for) that aside, my family loves it and I will make it again.

Would probably cook on stone for about 5 minutes before putting toppings on and then another 10-15 with toppings. Definitely makes a BIG pizza! Had enough for 2 regular size pizzas. Very crispy! Delicious!

This is a very simple and easy-to-make recipe. Unfortunately, the dough was extremely bland and dry once cooked. I had to dip the pizza crust into extra pizza sauce to eat it. I would use this recipe again, but not without adding some spices such as garlic powder and pizza seasoning.
Hint: When splitting it up into personal-sized pizza, spread out the dough thinner than usual because it backes twice as thick.

This pizza crust was perfect, it tasted exactly how a pizza crust should!  I rolled the edges over string cheese sticks (make sure you roll it well to seal it in) and made a stuffed crust pizza that was better than any you can have delivered!

I'VE FALLEN BACK IN LOVE WITH THICK CRUST!

I just finished a VERY satisfying veggie pizza. The crust was a bit doughey and underdone in the middle, but I suspect it was my fault for layering so much sauce and fresh spinach on top. 

I'm sure it would only turn out better on a pizza stone, but it's really worth trying with whatever materials you have. I used a cheap Kroger cookie sheet and white sugar instead of brown. Despite eyeballing the smaller measurements (having misplaced my measuring spoons-0y!) and using a glass milk bottle to roll the dough, it still turned out fantastically the first time! (I'll admit, though, that I have some prior experience working with yeast, which is a key factor in making this dough).

The crust turned out nice and crispy and smooth-- like a non-greasy foccacia bread. I rolled it thick and the edges were a delight to munch on. I also ended up adding a bit more flour, but this largely depends on the absorbancy of your work surface (mine was pretty non-porous). If you have bread making experience, you'll have an easier time knowing when the dough is the right consistency. Another note is that it took me about 2.5 - 3 hours to finish this recipe--though I'm a slow cook and I wasn't able to take any shortcuts, like baking it immediately after rolling on a pizza stone.

Once again, thanks to the author! For the rest of you, this is a good "first" pizza dough recipe.

This is a delicious recipe.  I've been making my own pizza for years, but was never super-happy with the recipes that made it easy to get a yeasty taste.  This dough is chewy inside, crusty outside.  The two changes I made were using white sugar instead of brown, using a little more flour and plenty of olive oil for the rising bowl so it wasn't too sticky after it was finished rising.  I also do not punch it down after it rises...I get it right from the bowl and spread it into a pizza pan, and let it sit (covered with a dampened paper towel) and rise for another 20 minutes, then put my sauce and mozzerella on.  I bake it in a pre-heated 450 oven, bottom rack, for about 15 minutes.  I've made this at least 20 times, and it only gets better each time.  I've had many friends and family call it "heavenly" and "better than a pizza place". Thank you Jay!

Very dependable recipe and yeilds a soft, workable dough. I have even substituted whole wheat (1:1 ratio) and still tastes great.  Also, I double the recipe sometimes to make about 16-18 mini pizzas, which are great to put in the freezer for easy lunches or late dinners.  I place them individually in ziplocks and label.

LOVED THIS RECIPE!  We followed some of the other suggestions and added parmesan cheese, Italian Seasonings, and basil.  It made so much we broke it in half, froze the other half, and had dough for another time.  We also used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe with it, and it was FABULOUS!
Thanks Jason!

I made this for dinner tonight.  This was my first real attempt at making pizza crust from scratch and it turned out very well (give myself a pat on the back!).
I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the crust itself was bland...but then again, what are we expecting?  It's pizza crust for pete's sake!
Next time I'm going to try adding italian seasoning and maybe parmesan cheese to the dough when kneading.  I bet that would be good!
Thanks for the recipe, Jason!

This crust is the best.  Really great texture and easy to work with.  I made a barbeque pizza:  For the sauce I mixed 1/2 barbeque sauce & 1/2 pizza sauce.  Then I topped it with italian sausage, bacon, onion, parmesan cheese and mozzarella.  A nice change of pace.

First attempt at making pizza and this dough was really easy, just really sticky and I used about 1 more cup than what was called for.  Used the dough to make calzones and the "Gourmet Chicken Pizza" on this site and everyone kept on raving about how wonderful the crust was.  I added about 1/2 tblsp of garlic powder and needed in some butter, it was delicious.

This was a winner in my household!!  It is a definite keeper.  The dough is sticky, but I just added flour in the bowl until it was 'not sticky' enough to put out and knead.....then added enough flour until it wasn't sticky, like the recipe suggested.  Yum!  I also took the advice of using the Exquisite Pizza Sauce that Dana123 gave!  The two together was a hit!

Great pizza crust (good with exquisite pizza sauce on this site)!  It took a long time to bake up puffy- next time I will bake it sans toppings for about 10 minutes.  Also, I added garlic salt (cut back on regular salt) to taste.

Awesome awesome awesome!  This one's a keeper!  I would use about 2/3 of the amounts
called for here -- it still makes for a thick crust on your standard, large pizza.  Baste crust with olive oil and sprinkle on some 
rosemary or other herbs before adding other toppings too.  A quick & easy pizza sauce recipe: mix tomato paste with your
favorite marinara/spaghetti sauce until you get the right consistency.

This is the best pizza crust recipe I have ever found.  I use this to make pan pizza in a large cast iron skillet and it turns out perfect.  The crust is soft inside and nice and crusty on the outside.  This is the only recipe that I will use from now on.

I have had trouble coming up with a really good pie crust for my pizza. Last night I finally nailed it thanks to this recipe. Thanks Jay for sharing the recipe. I used a pizza stone and a regular Wilson cookie sheet. Both pizzas came out great. I did double the sugar and added some Rosemary. Otherwise made it as is. You gotta try this if your pizza crust is in need of help.

I make this whenever I make pizza and it is my family's favorite pizza crust recipe. I do a few things differently though which makes it a lot better. 

1. I brush olive oil on the crust which makes it crispier and a lot better

2. I add about 1 cup of extra flour when making otherwise it is way too sticky to the point I can't use it. 

Other then that I follow this recipe exactly and it is great. I just wish it was crispier and had more taste. I will take other reviewer's advice and prebake the dough before adding topping for 10 minutes and then put the toppings on and bake it some more the next time I make this.

Wow - loved it!  Why did I wait so long to try this recipe?  I know, it uses yeast and I have a fear of it.  I put all the ingredients in the bread machine and let it do the work for me.  When it was time to remove the bread, I put it in a Pam™ sprayed self-sealing gallon bag and put it in the refrigerator to use later.  When I got home, 8 hours later, the bag was about ready to explode!  I spread the dough onto a well greased pizza pan, let it rise for 20 minutes, pre-baked for 5 minutes, and then added the toppings.  I used:  sausage, pepperoni, onion, green pepper, mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese and fresh diced tomatoes.  For the sauce I made 'Exquisite Pizza Sauce' from AR.  The results were the BEST homemade pizza I've ever had. I like that I can make this again and freeze for another time.  This makes enough dough that you could halve the dough and make smaller pizzas. Thanks Jason Sharp for sharing your recipe.

Good crust recipe. I used more sugar and pre-heated the oven to as hot as it would go (550 no pizza stone, just a pan on the rack). No pre-cooking needed and pizza was perfect in 10 minutes.

This is the first successful pizza crust I have made.  All the others (some from this site) have been too bland, dense or chewy.  The only problem we had was there the extreme crust to topping ratio - a 14 inch cast iron pan was too small. 
Next time, I plan to sub half the flour with whole wheat and also use a cookie sheet pan.
Also, added tip - spray the crust with oil (Pam works fine) and sprinkle with garlic salt before baking.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I had to tweak it to make it outstanding! I made mine in the bread machine and added italian seasoning and garlic powder. After the dough cycle it was very wet so I had to add quite a bit more flour. With those changes it came out amazing!

I prefer to use whole grains whenever possible, so I used only one cup of all-purpose flour and the rest white whole wheat flour. Added 1 tsp Italian seasoning as other reviewers had suggested. I put all the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle, and it was way too wet when it finished, so I had to knead out the dough some more with extra flour. Pre-baked the crust for 7 minutes on a well oiled baking sheet, then topped with sauce and veggies and baked for another 10 minutes. Turned out WONDERFUL. I'd been looking for a thick, chewy crust that wasn't too heavy, and this was PERFECT, even with the the whole wheat. Will DEFINITELY be making this again soon!

I have a new go-to pizza crust recipe.
Crusty on the outside but soft and chewy inside. Good flavor, easy to work with, and baked up quickly and evenly.

I have never made pizza dough before and felt adventurous, so I tried this crust out the other night and it was awesome!  My husband is very particular when it comes to his pizza - a friend even gave him a gift certificate for his favorite pizza place for a wedding present!!!  I guess they were afraid he would never get to eat pizza again lol.  Anyways, even this self-proclaimed pizza conoisseur loved my pizza!  Now that says alot at our house!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Absolutely fantastic pizza crust!  I have tried recipe after recipe and this is the one that all my picky eaters agreed on.  I'll be making this often.  Hubby says awesome and all the kids said it's better than Pizza Hut.

At first I tried making this crust with all the suggestions of others. It was okay. Then, I made it exactly as is and it was SO good. I would not change a thing.

This is indeed a very good recipe.  I've used it to make both pizza and calzones for a superbowl party and several people asked "Who made this?  It's awesome!"  Using bread flour instead of all-purpose flour gives it an even better taste (to me, anyway.)

One note for anyone using this recipe - you will need more flour than the recipe states so don't start this if you're running low on flour.  I usually make double the recipe and need about 2-3 more cups of flour to get past the "sticky phase."  Then you'll usually need more when you roll out the dough.

Excellent! Used another reviews idea and added onion powder and garlic to dough. Also, subbed whole wheat flour. Came out perfect. This is delicious!

This was one of the best pizza crusts I have ever had! Very simple recipe and easy to make. I used a thermometer to measure the water temperature, which I recommend. I used a round pan, didn't prebake, and it came out amazing!

This recipe was amazing for breadsticks!  I made the dough as directed and used part of it for the pizza and the other I spread in a pan for the breadsticks.  I brushed melted butter over it, added garlic salt, parmesan cheese and then a little mozzarella, baked it until lightly browned.  I then spread a little more butter and parmesan cheese and cut into sticks.  They were the best breadsticks I have ever had!  I will definately be using this recipe again.

This was the most successful attempt I have made at homemade pizza.  This recipe is now my official crust recipe ... still tweaking the sauce.  I do love having my home smell like a Pizzareia when guest come through the door.  Had a little difficulty transfering to the pizza stone, but next time I am going to put it on parchment paper for the transfer, cook it 5-10 minutes and then remove the paper for remaining cooking time.

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now, and makes the family happy- I have managed to spread this out to 3 large thin crust pizzas, so we each get to choose our own toppings. Super simple and delicious!

Thanks for sharing this recipe Jason!  I finally broke down and decided to make homemade pizza using my bread machine. Ingredients were added according to the manufacturer's directions, but I did find a lot more flour was needed. None the less, this dough was very easy to work with and made two 12 inch pizzas.  Also I did not let the dough rise for the 15 or 20 minutes before adding the toppings. Second time around I replaced 1 1/3 cups of the flour with whole wheat.  Delicious and yes it is soft and doughy on the inside and slightly crusty on the outside.  Just be sure not to over cook.

I've never made pizza from scratch before, but this crust made me pretty proud of a noble first attempt. I had the pizza stone in the oven on the highest temp for a good hour and a half. I added some onion powder, garlic powder, marjoram, oregano, basil, and parmigiano. I split the dough in half, and on a corn meal covered cookie sheet I stretched out the dough. When I had the proper size, I took the stone out, slid the pizza on and got it back in the oven. After 5 minutes of pre-baking, I took the stone out, went to town on some homemade sauce, added some fresh mozzarella (be sure to cut into 1/8 - 1/4 slices and put on a paper towel plate, place paper towel on top, followed by another plate, and something that weighs 5 pounds or so and let it drain the moisture for a good 30 minutes or so), prosciutto, and fire roasted peppers/tomatoes. I cooked it for 12 more minutes, and it gave a very crispy crust, which wasn't bad, but I think I'm gonna scale back and go with maybe 7 minutes of cook time next.

This is my favorite pizza crust recipe! Some people like their pizza crust crispy, this is by no means crispy! It is fluffy and soft and to me incredibly delicious! It is really easy and makes two medium sized pizzas. I crank the oven to 425 then after I put the pizzas in I turn it down to 400, to prevent the toppings (onion,pepperoni etc.) from burning.

Followed as written but used whole wheat flour. Okay on the first try. Will make again as it was good dough but with regular flour and do a butter crust since well, I'm a south side chicago girl and thats how pizza should be.

I've been looking for a good pizza crust recipe, and this is definitely not it. I followed this recipe to the letter and the crust was awful. I bake all my pizzas on a stone, and it was still really raw and doughy. The recipe said to place the toppings on the dough and bake immediately. If I would've baked it longer the cheese would've been burnt. Maybe if the crust was par baked it would've been better. We threw the whole pizza out it was so bad. I will keep looking for a good recipe for pizza dough.

I used all-purpose, bread, and whole-wheat flour.  I made this in my bread machine.  The dough was very easy to work with.  I took the advice of others and baked it for a few minutes before topping it.  Toppings:  I sauteed kale in butter, lemon, and pepper.  I added a little bit of whipping cream and cayenne pepper to a jar of mushroom alfredo sauce.  I also had stuffed chicken sausage on hand.  I layered the pizza with sauce, kale, sausage, and cheese.

I have tried several pizza crust recipes and this is exactly what I've been looking for.  Great taste and texture.  I made it in my bread machine.  I added some garlic and onion powders.  I should have but didn't realize how much dough this makes.  I think next time I'll make about 2/3 of the recipe to use on my 12 inch stone.

Excellent crust that is soft inside and chewy-crisp on the outside!  This will be my new pizza crust recipe, but next time I will add some herbs and garlic powder as I did with my old recipe.  I made this in my bread maker on the dough setting which simplified the preparation.  I was able to make two 14" x 15" pizzas.  The only change I made was to bake at 350 degrees for about 19-20 minutes on air cushion cookie sheets since I don't have a pizza stone.  This is a really great recipe.

added Italian Seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder along with the salt/oil. And I baked them for 10 minutes prior to adding the toppings in a 12 inch cake pan and 12 inch cast iron skillet, that were both olive oiled WELL, and dusted with yellow cornmeal.

This recipe was great.  I only wish I would have pre-cooked the dough before adding toppings.  The center was not cooked through.  Also, this does make two pizzas.  One I cooked in a cast iron skillet in the oven (for a deep dish effect) and the other I made on a 14" pizza pan.  One could very easily have 2-14" pizza pans full of this dough.  The dough was very nice and easy to work with.  Thank you Jason.

Excellent.  Easy to make as well.  I've made it several times since I found this recipe.  Also pairs well for pepperoni bread.

This is a great crust. I rolled the dough to be an inch bigger than the pan and put cheese in the crust for a stuffed crust.

I've tried a couple of other pizza crust recipes, but I think this will be my go to recipe for now on. Today was my 3rd time making this crust, and every time I make it, I need to add a lot more flour than what's called for. At least 1/2 cup more. I don't know why, but that's how much is needed until the dough is no longer sticky and becomes smooth and elastic. I do add 2 tsp. of brown sugar into the salt and oil mixture for a little extra flavor. I also sprinkle in onion powder and garlic powder (maybe 1/4-1/2 tsp. of each). Also, for the oil I do half olive oil and half vegetable oil.

I've tried several variations of this recipe by adding garlic and herbs or sometimes an extra pinch of sugar and it always turns out wonderful! I put all the ingredients in my bread machine, separate it out into three dough balls ( we like ours thin) pre bake until slightly golden and then top and finish. I highly recommend this crust as a great base to whatever kind of pizza you can cook up.

I've never made pizza dough (or any kind of bread before) and this still came out fantastic.  A couple of lessons learned by a first timer:  1) Roll it thinner than you think you might need to, unless you like REALLY thick crusts.  2) Spaghetti sauce does not a pizza sauce make.  It's too thin.   3) This will also make EXCELLENT bread-sticks. :-)  Some reviewers said don't over sauce your pizza for fear it would turn out soggy. I personally did not have this problem.

When I am wanting a somewhat whole-wheat crust (which is often) this is the recipe I reach for. I sub 2 cups of whole wheat flour for the same of the AP and voila. I tried subbing out all of the AP, but the resulting texture was not quite as palatable.

I have seen this numerous times on the recipe buzz. And, after making it, I don't know what all of the excitement was about. I had thought it was maybe going to be more of a pan type of pizza crust, for some reason. But, it is like regular pizza crust, just much softer and thicker. The dough is equally soft and tears easily when working with. The flavor is actually pretty good, for just a plain pizza crust, but it is a lot of dough for one slice. Although, the crust was very easy to make, as I mixed and kneaded it all in one bowl. But, If you are looking to make an authentic pizza or impress guests visually this is not the crust. Though, it you looking to satisfy a big hungry family this will work great!

This sure doesn't need a review from me, but here goes anyways.  This was a very good crust.  I made it twice, once with beer instead of water, but that is actually another recipe, a custom version.  Anyways, I did bake it about 10 minutes before I added toppings.  I poked holes with a fork prior to baking.  I only used one of this version, and frozen the other.  I made a Hawaiian pizza with this one.  It was scrumptious.

I usually use bread flour rather than all-purpose for a crispier crust.  It makes an excellent dough. I also often substitute 1/3 whole wheat flour for a very flavorful whole wheat crust.

Wow! This is wonderful!!  I made this in my Kitchen Aid mixer and let it do the kneeding...not adding too much flour.  I made the mistake of doubling the batch.  We always like to eat left over pizza for a few days, so I wanted to make sure we had enough.  I only made 2 pizzas, and did not divide it in half equally, so one pizza had a VERY thick crust.  But it was still so yummy!!  Nice crispy bottom with tender center!  I've never had a homemade crust that tasted like a restaurant pizza!  I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and will experiment with more whole wheat.  This would be great to impress guests with!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I have never successfully made pizza dough before this recipe. Lord knows I have tried. I always end up with too doughy a crust and burnt toppings. Even refrigerator dough in the tube that goes *thwuck* has that result for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I let my KitchenAid mixer handle the kneading. The result was a thick, chewy, delicious crust that got thumbs up from both the roommate and the boyfriend. I highly recommend this recipe.

One of the best pizza crust recipes.  I have adapted it a bit.  Instead of using salt, I add garlic salt and then also add a little garlic powder to the crust.  Sometimes I let it sit overnight in the fridge and it is much easier to toss the next day and develops a wonsderful flavor.

This is an excellent crust recipe as is!  It comes out chewy with a fairly crisp crust, but I always pre-bake the crust before topping it (otherwise it may turn out soggy). That said, I am constantly changing it up to make things new. My favorite combination is using 1/2 wheat flour and 1 Tbsp fresh ground black pepper. I also cook it on the grill during the summer, and it works there too!

This was a good recipe to work with, but I think I can make improvements. I used approx. 4 cups of flour. Half of the flour was whole wheat. The dough was incredibly sticky and soft, so much so that I had to use a spatula to smear it on the pizza pan. It also did not form a tight ball. Next time I will add at least 5 cups of flour. Because it was so difficult to work with, I made 1 crust. It rose up well. The baked crust came out very soft, more like a roll or fococcia than pizza crust. I prefer a crust that is soft but has some chew.   I'll use this recipe again for its straightforwardness, but I will change a few things:  Use at least 5 c flour  Knead it longer  Make 2 crusts   I baked it for 9 minutes before adding toppings and then 12-15 minutes once I put the toppings on. It came out nicely done.   I'd say this is better than my other crust recipe but  it needs tweaking. Enjoy!

5 star recipe.  I even made significant changes to it and it turned out awesome!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and added onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning to the salt/oil mixture.  I didn't use even close to 3+ cups of flour.  I started with the 2.5 cups and then only added a little afterward so that it wasn't sticky anymore.  I also put the crust in the over @425 for 7 minutes before adding the topping.  Delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

No more store bought crusts here!  This was delicious!  My only modifications were that I let my stand mixer do the work of kneading the dough and ended up adding the full amount of flour because it was way too sticky with just 2 1/2c.

My favorite dough recipe, and my husband's fave, too.  Good with white, whole wheat, or a mix.  I always need more flour than it calls for, but it consistently tastes good and has a nice texture.

this seemed fairly easy to do. I put it in my kitchen aid and went to town. It has been years since I made pizza dough and I used Fleishmann's pizza dough package yeast. My kids really enjoyed their chili dog pizza. Very much.Thanks. I will use again.

This is my standard crust recipe!  I have made this at least a dozen times now.  I always use my bread machine and it makes the process a breeze.  I start by putting the water and oil in first, followed by the sugar and salt.  Then I add the flour and the yeast last.  I replace 1 cup of the regular flour with whole wheat and I also add a teaspoon or more of an Italian garlic herb mix I have.  Takes about 1 hour & 20 minutes in my machine.  This makes enough dough for me to cover 2 large cookie sheets.  If I only need one I wrap the leftover dough in plastic wrap, place in a freezer bag and put it in the freezer for later use.  Pull it out the morning you need it, place in the fridge and it'll be ready to go in the evening.   Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

Excellent crust.  I used more flour since it was still very sticky.  About 4 1/4 cups.  I also had to cook it about 7 minutes longer than stated-on a pizza stone.  Loved the taste, and crunchy outside, soft inside.  I made a big pizza with yummy toppings for hubby and I, and a small pizza for the kids with just cheese.  It was also the first pizza dough i was able to get into a circle shape...I'm not much of a roller!

Adding to the legions of AR cooks that love this crust. I've tried a lot and as soon as he took his first bite of this one, my husband said, "I think you've found the one." We had a sausage, mozzarella and basil pizza and a brie and fig pizza from the amount of crust this made. Crispy on the outside, chewy and flavorful on the inside. This is great! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was such an amazing crust. I added a little minced garlic to the dough before baking and it was great. I made 1 large pizza and 2 personal sized ones from one batch. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was super good! I added spices into the dough like italian seasoning, garlic etc. I topped it with the BBQ Chicken Pizza toppings on this site from KIMIRAE.

Fantastic crust!  I can see why some of the reviews compared it to Pizza Hut's pan pizza.  While the flavor isn't the same, the texture is very similar to the pan pizza - very crispy on the outside and fluffy and chewy on the inside.  There weren't many reviews of making this crust in the bread machine, but I decided to try it anyway.  I was impressed with the results and can't wait to try it by hand to see if it turns out even better!  I used the dough cycle on my machine.  The dough came out very wet, and I think that's what lends it's texture.  I let it rise in a greased 16" pizza pan for 15 minutes, then pre-baked it for 5 minutes before putting on the toppings.  We topped ours with Contadina pizza sauce, 1 lb. shredded mozzarella, mushrooms and pepperoni.  Delicious!

I've tried several pizza dough recipes from this site, and this was by far my favorite.  We made the recipe as stated, but next time I will try using a little wheat flour.

I have used this recipe over and over.  It is great for thicker or thinner crust pizza.  One thing sometimes do is brush olive oil and sprinkle garlic salt over the crust and bake it for 5 minutes before topping.  It helps crisp up the crust.  Also, I have started adding seminola flour for a portion of the flour and it really makes the crust yummy.  Great recipe!

I prepared the crust exactly as stated in the recipe but I think I had to add at least a cup if not a cup and a helf more flour just to get the dough out of the sticky phase.  I got two crusts out of it and I really only wanted one, so you can easily cut the recipe in half.  I must say though the flavor was wonderful and it baked up nicely rising beautifully in the oven and getting a nice golden brown, crispy yet still a little chewy.  Thank you.

Terrific pizza crust!  I, too, added some garlic & rosemary for great flavor.  I used a pizza stone and baked for 22 minutes for crispy outside, soft and chewy inside.  There's only three of us home now and every morsel disappeared.

oh, my goodness what a wonderful pizza crust.  i am not a bread baker so the fact of kneading the flour into the dough made me a bit nervous, but this is so easy to make.  i baked it on a pizza stone and it yielded the most delicious crispy outside and soft inside.

I’ve made this recipe before, each time taking reviewers’ advice and baking the crust for 10 minutes prior to adding toppings.  This last time I made it though, I did not pre-bake.  I will never pre-bake this crust again!  Pre-baking made my crust somewhat hard, and I was confused as to why this recipe had so many rave reviews when it seemed just okay to me.  Pre-baking, although it may work for some, didn’t work for me.  My non-pre-baked crust was the perfect consistency.  I made this for my sisters and I, and we all loved it.  I added Italian seasoning, rosemary, and garlic as I was kneading (I kneaded for eight minutes).  I sprinkled the same on the pan prior to placing the pizza.  Since my homemade pizzas were always okay but not fabulous, I had almost given up on them as a dinner item—since this last pizza turned out so well though, there will now be a homemade pizza in my house every once in a while. :)

Absolutely fantastic. I can't believe I hadn't tried this before now! I used 3/4 of the dough for the pizza and saved the rest to make breadsticks. I mixed a bit of garlic powder with some olive oil and brushed that on the outer rim of the crust before baking. DELICIOUS! Will make again and again! Thank you :)

Easy and, I assume since I can't eat wheat, awesome. It looked and behaved like pizza crust...  I was confused about the amount of flour, though.  It seemed like it needed a lot more than the recipe called for.  In any case I'll be using this recipe again.

No need to find another dough!  I stopped searching after finding this one.  Easy to experiment with by adding in some extra spices if you like a more flavorful crust, but the consistency is perfect.

Very good crust for deep dish pizza.  As many other reviewers noted, I did have to add at least an extra cup of flour.  I mixed in my Kitchen-Aid with the dough hook, and it turned out well.  This won't replace my go-to one for thin crust, but it's a keeper for the deep dish.

The perfect crust.  Here's a hint I learned in the corporate kitchen I work in.  If you don't have a pizza stone but want a crispy bottom crust through the slice of pizza into a hot pan for a minute or so before eating.  It will crisp it right up.

This is a great crust & I did it the lazy way. I used 1 small packet of quick-rise yeast. Once the yeast & sugar mixture dissolved, I added everything to the kitchenaid with a dough hook & let it knead itself.  I accidentally let the dough rise for close to 1.5 hrs. I also precooked the crust for 7 min. It turned out thicker than I expected but got super reviews from the boyfriend that prefers a thicker crust that's crispy on the outside (aka: not floppy at all).

Good recipe. I added Italian herb seasoning mix, garlic powder and onion powder. I also used my Kitchenaid mixer to mix the dough. I used the beater first to combine all the ingredients and most of the flour, and then used the dough hook and added the remaining flour until a ball formed on the hook. Only took a total of 5 minutes mixing time on setting 2.

I really enjoyed this.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and made the dough in the Kitchenaid.  I made 2 pizzas out of it.  The dough puffed up nicely around the edges and the bottom of the crust was just crisp enough.

This certainly was easy using the dough hook of my mixer and definitely geared toward those who like a thick crust. If I made this again I would use a bit more salt or other seasonings to perk up the flavor a bit.

It was good - but not fabulous.  I did follow the directions precisely and it did turn out according to instructions as far as rising, etc.  One thing I noticed is it was a bit stickier than I expected it to be and tasted a bit more like bread than pizza crust.  I also agree with others that say add more spice to it.  I am a fan of fresh basil so I put that on my pizza otherwise make sure you add dried italian spices to the dough.

This was some great pizza crust.  It was really easy to work with.  And it turned out great.  I just wish the recipe would of said that its enough dough for 2 pizza's.  I could tell it definitely was going to be too much for a regular 12 inch pizza pan so I made a rectangular pizza on my 13x9 pizza stone and it still turned out super thick!  Next time I will know to freeze the other half if Im just making one pizza.  The crust turned out nice and crispy but soft on the inside.  This is a keeper!

We've finally found a great dough for our pizzas.  I followed this recipe exactly (though I prebaked the crust for 6 minutes before adding the toppings since I was using a pizza pan which I think helped a lot) and rolled it out for a thin crust and was spurprised that the crust remained chewy.  We brushed the crust with melted buter and shaker romano cheese.  A key I believe to add flavor to this is to add in Italian seasonings and some onion and garlic powder into the dough as any other reviewers did.  It gave it a little extra kick and gave the final product a very pretty look.  The crust was just gorgeous and I am going to try deep dish next time and perhaps at some point substitute some wheat flour to give even more texture to it.  I split the dough into thrids and froze 2 and baked one tonight.  The one I made fed one adult and two children, perhaps a "medium" size pizza.

Excellent crust. I made one in my cast iron skillet and one in my pizza pan. Both were great. The one in the skillet thicker and most like the pan pizza from the Hut. It had better flavor and less greasy. I added 1 tsp. each garlic powder and oregano. I will look no further. Thanks Jay!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!!
My hubby, who is a "thin and crispy" pizza guy and I am a "thick and chewy" pizza gal, really liked this as well! SHOCK!
Made it in the bread machine and followed it to a "T". This crust really ROSE to it's occasion!! We made the recipe for 12 to fit a large round pan and even that was a little too much for hubby, but I LOVED it~reminded me of Pizza Hut, if only I had put the cornmeal on the bottom....!! Next purchase will be a pizza stone for more authentic crust. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

This is wonderful pizza crust!  It is soft and chewy on the inside and crusty on the outside. I added minced garlic, parlsey, and onion powder and covered the bottom in cornmeal. This is the first homemade pizza crust I've liked!

We were looking for an easy dough recipe and this was it!  I used the Kitchen Aid mixer to knead (felt like cheating, but saved me time!  Thanks for the suggestion- 2 min at speed 2, 8 min at speed 6) and it turned out perfect--I am sure I added more flour than the recipe called for, but I didn't measure it out.  I also added garlic powder, and next time will add some Italian seasoning, etc.  We made two flatbreads out of the recipe-One with just herbs, parm. cheese, and garlic.  The other with gorganzola, parm, mozz, prosciutto, tomatos sliced very thin, and garlic and herbs--excellent.  Baste the edges with more olive oil before baking.  We didn't parbake the crust first, but just topped and baked...with more and thicker toppings, I can see why you may need to though.  We have been buying refrigerated dough from Trader Joes in the past, but this far exceeds that, and sometime I am going to try to hold the dough in the fridge for a couple days and then bake it (like I read in other reviews).  I am making two batches tonight for real pizza!!

This is great! I retired another recipe we had been using after trying this.  I modified this by adding 1 tsp each of garlic, basil and Italian Seasoning.  I also decreased water slightly by 1/4 cup because dough was a little too sticky to work with.  I used 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and the rest white.  My family raved over this especially when I also used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe from this site also.

This didn't turn out for me, though I really believe it was due to operator error and not the recipe.  I added some Italian spices and extra garlic, made in the bread machine on dough cycle, then let it rise for an hour. Put in the fridge over night and used the next day. I used the entire amount of dough on a pizza stone and it was way too thick and got tough after first precooking it for 10 minutes then adding the goodies and putting back in the oven till the cheese was melted.  The dough behaved fairly well, I did have to add flour to it, but not a terribly huge amount. I am going to buy 2 deep dish pans and make 2 smaller pizzas instead of one huge one the next time. I think I just had too much dough for one pizza stone.

I've tried probably 10 different recipes and 30 variations of those recipes and NONE even came close to this one. I believe the rising of the dough is the key to this wonderful crust, I pre-baked for 5 minutes, then topped heavily and baked for 25 more minutes, and it was thoroughly done, not too crisp either.

Excellent, excellent, excellent! It made enough dough for two 12-inch pizzas. The dough was easy to work with and rose beutifully. I baked the dough for 4-5 minutes on a pizza crisper pan (round pan with holes) before topping and baking for an additional 12-14 minutes. Before baking, I brushed olive oil along the edges to lightly brown the crust. Would also make gread focaccia bread or breadsticks. Thanks for the recipe!

Upon reading previous reviewers' responses, I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: doubled the sugar and added seasoning (garlic powder, minced garlic, and italian seasoning) to the oil/salt mix. This was my first time making a homemade pizza crust, and the results were very tasty. Will use this recipe again. Thank you!

I've been making this crust for about 2 years now and it's the best! makes 2 pizzas, you have to pre-bake the crust before topping it or it turns out soggy. (I'll be trying it on a pizza stone soon) It's great with seasonings added to it, but I leave it plain so the kids will eat it and it's still awesome!

Wonderful crust! The taste was high quality and delicious, and I didn't find it to be bland at all whatsoever. I made it as the recipe states, and used BBQ Chicken Pizza recipe from this site for the toppings and made a 14" pizza, using all of the dough. My cooking time was a bit longer though, about 10-15 min longer. Perfect together..and I will use this crust again with other toppings as well. Thanks!

I rate this a 3 because it took many reviews to make this work.  It took at least another cup of flour, and "one giant pizza" for the size was very vague- is that a 16" or what?  I ended up using a cake pan, (forgot I loaned out my pizza stone), but others said so many different types of pans, it was confusing. I then only used 2/3 of the dough. I took the advice to cook the crust 10 min. first instead of the extra rising time - then added toppigs and cooked 20 more min. After reading the reviews - many of the 5 star reviews had numerous changes  by adding spices, flour, cheese, etc. to the crust.  That makes it a different recipe folks! We did like it quite a bit, believe it or not, but pretty sure I got lucky by taking the right advice from other reviewers. Maybe the pizza stone makes the difference -if so the recipe should say so.

This is the only recipe I use now.  We don't even by pizza from a pizzeria now. My husband who thinks pizza is "the perfect food" won't let make any but this.  I follow the recipe directions exactly and it come out perfect every time.  I prebake the crust on a lightly oiled pizza stone, usually earlier in the day, then we can top it and cook it when we are hungrly. BTW, this dough also makes for an amazing Calzone crust as well.

This recipe is fantastic.  I've made it several times and it freezes beautifully.  I find it makes two pizza crusts - be sure to roll the crust thinly because it rises a lot in the oven.  Thanks!!!

I have been looking for a pizza crust recipe that would turn out like this...it is definitely a keeper!  I have been making pizza crusts pretty consistently over the last five years and have had so many blunders.  I think this recipe would be hard to mess up it is so perfect.  I didn't try spinning it but it is the perfect consistency and has just the right amount of elasticity in it that I think I could!  So if you read this review you should try it too!  I had to add a little more flour than what it called for but...like I said… this recipe is so perfect you would be hard-pressed to mess it up.  It was definitely crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and the crust baked so beautifully, it looked proffessional!  Thanks for this Recipe!!

This is by far the best pizza crust I have ever made. It worked out perfect for elasticity and was easy to work with. I did not find it hard to throw together but I am used to making bread doughs, etc. I followed the recipe to a tee and did not need to add extra flour. I worked it all in and tried to toss it, but to no avail, but will keep trying to toss. I think it takes a little practice. It rolled out very nicely. This recipe did two large pizzas. I made one thin and the other thick. Worked well both ways. I do believe adding some herbs to the crust would do very nicely, but needed to try the crust by itself first. It was great tasting! I did make one change, I baked at 450 degrees rather than 425 degrees and I used cornmeal under the crust. The crust came out chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside. This is a keeper and I will continue to use it and will not look for another pizza crust recipe at all. Thanks, Jay

This was perfection.  I rolled it out thin but did use almost all of the dough.  The nice, thick crust was delicious.  I did brush some olive oil on the edges and sprinkled some garlic salt and oregano on them prior to baking.

Very good dough. I used it to make garlic breadsticks. Usually when I try to make homemade dough it turns out very bland. So, this was a really nice way to make pizza dough, as it was not bland.

I thought about giving this 3 stars, but considering how easy it is to make, I bumped it up to 4.  There are multiple drawbacks to this recipe.  Most, if not all of these are mentioned in other reviews, but since my wife found this recipe for me I never saw the reviews.

I have tried this crust 3 or 4 times and will probably use it again in the future, though slightly modified.

Yes, it is bland.  Not much flavor to it.  Adding salt, garlic powder, or your choice of seasoning should help.

Yes, it is thick.  The first time I made it I assumed it would make up one pizza.  Whoa was I wrong!  After I took it out of the oven it looked like a loaf of bread with pizza toppings.  Every time since then I have rolled it out absolutely as thin as possible, so it ends up making at least 2 large pizzas.  Sometimes I'll make several mini pizzas for my kids and a couple medium sized ones for me and my wife.  We still have leftovers.

I wish the bottom of the crust wasn't so soft.  Next time I'll put some cornmeal on the pan before laying the dough over it.  I imagine a pizza stone may help as well.

And yes, I needed to add a lot of flour to the recipe during the kneeding.  I can't imagine anyone making this recipe work with the specified amount of flour.

All in all, though, the it does work out and is quite usable.

This crust was absolutely delicious.  I did brush the edges of the pizza with mixture of olive oil, salt, and Bruschetta seasoning.  I've made many pizza crusts and this is the best one i've come across in quite awhile.  I did have to manually add about a 1/2 cup of flour to the mixer but this may be due the the high humidity on the day i made the pizzas.

Fantastic dough as is written!
For extra goodness I put in a tablespoon of dried italian herbs and brush the rim of the crust with garlic butter.  Put a light sprinkling of cornmeal on whatever you bake your dough on for a nice crispy crunch!

My family loves this pizza crust!  I have tried using all whole wheat flour . . . and it was awful!  It is still great, though, if you use half whole wheat and half regular flour.  We usually add some garlic, onion and other spices to the dough when we're mixing it, and it tastes GREAT.  It's our "go-to" recipe for pizza crust!

I've made this at least once a week since discovering such an easy, fool proof recipe.  My family loves it as a pizza, but I've also used the dough to make soft pretzels and those are even more popular.  Topped with a nice garlicky pizza sauce and some shredded cheddar, everyone eats them up.  Excellent recipe!

This recipe was ok.  I warmed my oven to 200 degrees then turned it off and put a damp towel over my stainless steel bowl and put it in the semi-warm oven to rise.  It rose QUICKLY and was very easy to work with and roll out and put on the pan.  I folded the edges like papa johns does so the end of the crust was thick.  I topped it and baked it.  The crust ends turned out ALOT like papa johns chewy crust, BUT, had no flavor.  It DID taste a lot like white bread and was doughy in the middle.  I give it one star for taste, and one star for ease of making. Probably won't make it again.

EXCELLENT! This crust was simple if you just follow the directions to a T. I only let it rise for 45 min. and I baked the crust with just the sauce on it for 10 min. to make sure the crust would be cooked through. It turned out perfect! It was easy to work with and tasty, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside perfecto!

This dough is delish! This is a Friday night regular now, toppings vary. The Barbeque Ckn Pizza from this site is great on here! Also, we have made this recipe, rolled out several small pizza crusts and froze them. They are easy to pull out and make mini pizzas with, and this dough freezes well! Great recipe. :)

I gave up attempting pizza crust a few years ago because I was less than successful.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a try.  My 4 year old son loved rolling out the dough and he topped the pizza.  He typically doesn't like pizza, but he ate 1/2 of this!  I topped the other dough with olive oil, herbs and parmesan --- I was going to serve it with steak for dinner but my husband ate it all before dinner.  He really liked it!  Thank you for sharing this recipe -  We eat pizza approx. twice a week so this will really help to cut down our money spent on pizza.   If I can do it, anyone can!  FOLLOW UP: I have made it often enough that I now "know" what I am doing - I add more brown sugar and salt and I do Not let the crust rise once it is on the pizza pan because we like a thin, crispy crust...I add 
San Marzono tomatoes ( hard to find so I buy direct from Italy  - it is required that i buy in bulk, so feel free to contact me if you are interested), "real" mozzarella and fresh basil...tastes just like the famous margherita pizza you find in the southern part of Italy!!!! CIAO/CHOW, BELLA!

I've used this recipe about 6 or 7 times now and finally decided to come rate it.  This is a fantastic pizza crust... I always divide the dough in half and freeze the second half.  One half works perfectly for a great crust on my pizza stone.  If you have a pizza stone, definitely use it! It makes a difference!  Nice and soft and chewy on the inside and crunchy outside!  Awesome!

Great pizza crust recipe...really easy to make, and the flavor is wonderful.  This is a great basic recipe that can be easily tweaked to individual tastes.  I sprinkled the crust with some Italian seasonings and prebaked a few minutes before putting the toppings on.  Only one caution: be careful not to prebake too long!  I did the first time I made this crust and the crust turned out VERY crunchy after the toppings finished baking.  It was still delicious (we love crunchy pizza crust in my house), but for people who prefer more of a soft, thick crust that could be a problem.  So if you prebake, keep a close eye on it!  

This made two large pizzas for me, and each had a nice crust thickness.  This recipe has become a staple in my kitchen!  My husband, who doesn't care much for pizza, loves it and asks me to make it all the time.  I highly recommend it.

This was an extremely sticky dough, but it should be that way! I ended up adding an extra 2/3 c flour and let the dough rise in the mixer bowl. After it has risen it isn't as sticky, but if you need to, oil your hands when working with it. If you add too much flour you'll end up with a thick, tough, doughy crust. If you don't add the extra flour everyone else is, you'll be able to make it an extrememly thin crust. I rolled it out on a thick layer of cornmeal (on the paddle) topped it and baked on a preheated stone. AWESOME! Best pizza we've had in a LONG time! THANK YOU JASON!

This made a beautiful, tasty crust with a couple of modifications. First, I did have to add almost a cup of flour to make this dough kneadable. I bake a lot of bread, and am used to working with sticky dough, but this was ridiculous! (Maybe in a mixer with a dough  hook this amount of flour would work) And it occured to me while adding all this flour that this may account for the lack of taste some reviewers mentioned, so I doubled the amount of salt, and used sea salt instead of table salt. I also baked untopped for 15 minutes, then topped the pizzas (the recipe made 2 12 pizzas) and baked for 10 minutes more. Perfect!

Not really sure what happened to this crust - I made it without any alterations and used it on a regular size pizza stone. After 15 minutes in the oven the crust was about 3 inches thick and all you could taste was the dough.  If I try it again, I will definitely use 1 recipe for 2 pizzas.

I was very impressed with this pizza dough.  As promised, it bakes up crisp on the outside and soft & chewy inside.  I would give it 10 stars for texture if I could.  The reason I only gave it a 4 overall was that I agree it could use more flavor as others suggested.  Also I had to add more flour to make the dough workable.  Made it on the dough cycle of my bread machine and then put it onto a huge perforated pizza pan (with holes on the bottom).  It practically rolled itself out it was so easy to work with!  This coming from a woman who has gotten so frustrated with previous pizza dough recipes that I have actually thrown them into the garbage & ordered out.  This is truly THE Pizza Crust for Dummies!

This is a great pizza crust, the best one I've found in 25 years.  The only comment I have is that I have 2 Pampered Chef 15" pizza stones and doubling the recipe make the pizza WAY too thick.  This will make 3 15" pizzas with plenty of crust.  It may look like not enough, but the dough rises and gets thicker than is seems that it will.  Just an observation that might help someone.

It's the best crust!  For a super thick crust that holds a lot of toppings, I made 1 giant pizza (11X17).  I've made this many times and make 2 pizzas with the same dough now:  use 2/3 of the dough to make a good medium crust in the 11X17 pan, and a restaurant style thin crust pizza using 1/3 of the dough in a 12-inch pan. No problems sticking: sprayed the pan with Pam and sprinkled it with cornmeal before placing crust on pan.

This crust is delicious!  I cooked the pizza in a cast iron skillet.  I heated up the skillet on the stove top with a little bit of oil.  Then I sprinkled some corn meal on the bottom of the skillet.  Makes a great deep dish pizza.  Be sure to use the Exquisite pizza sauce recipe from this site.  They are amazing together!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It makes alot so splitting it in two would be a good idea.  I used a pizza stone and let it rise a second time.  This is definately a keeper.

Yuck. I was hoping for a traditional, chewy, "hand-tossed" pizzeria-type of crust. This was like eating freshly-baked bread with pizza toppings. I'm going back to take-out pizza.

I have never made pizza crust before and it was hilarious, but it actually turned out good.  Even though I used a stone, I still baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding toppings.  The second time I made it I again baked the crust for 5 minutes but I added extra toppings (mushrooms and more cheese) and the crust would not bake through!  I had it in so long that the top burned and I had to toss the whole pizza.  Great recipe, but next time I'm gonna fully bake the crust..

I have never made my own pizza crust from scratch, plus I am from New Jersey, the home of great pizza.  But I have to say that this was a great recipe.  I needed more flour than called for, but that could have been the weather.  I rolled the dough out and put it on a pizza stone, then used the "easy pizza sauce" recipe and the "italian style sausage" receipe from this site.  It was great.  Because each of the recipes were double what I needed, I froze the leftover dough, sauce and sausage for another time.  Next time I would like to try the "white pizza dip" recipe from this site on the crust.  I am thinking of having a pizza party and ask people to bring their own pizza stone.  Thanks

I am usually not very good with bread recipes, but I really wanted to make homemade pizza.  This is a great pizza crust recipe.  I added italian spices and actually did it the day before.  I made it as the recipe said, then just put it in the frig.  The next morning, it had rised and I just deflated it and put it back in the frig until I came home from work.  Then finished the crust as the recipe said.  And it gave me one GIANT pizza.  Much too big for my pizza stone.  Next time I will just make two pizza out of this recipe.  This recipe is a keeper.  Now I only get take out pizza when I don't have time to make this.

I too had very high expectations about this highly reviewed recipe.  Maybe I did not do something right but it was only okay.  I had to add a lot of flour when I was kneading it; very sticky.  I will try to make again but definately not what I had expected.

Very quick and easy to make. Perfect for a Chicago style pizza pan, with a little left over for a personal pan pizza for your picky eater. Would make again...Thanks Jay!

I also thought this recipe was 'just okay' the first time we made it.  Apparently, our yeast was not very active, and that's why it was rather thin and bland.  Tonight we made with some new yeast and it was wonderful!  Nice and chewy, and enough of it that we could make one kid friendly and one adult friendly pizza.  For those who didn't like it, make sure your yeast is active, because it really is a delicious crust.

I found this a bit too dry after baking, although too wet and sticky before baking. I liked the recipe I got from the food channel, but thought i'd try this anyway to see which one is better.

We LOVED this!  This was my first attempt at homemade pizza.  Not only was it EASY, but it  made 1 "double dough" & 1 mini pizza.  Next time (as suggested by the kids) I will just make 2 regular size (12-14") pizza's.  They loved it!!  Thank you very much Jason, I will use this often!!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this pizza crust. Its much softer and "breadier" than my old recipe. Very good for those of us who like a thick, hearty crust. I'll be making this again.

OK..this makes a GREAT crust, but if you plan on using a bread machine you will need to make an adjustment.  I made two batches last night..I started with the 3 1/3 cups flour in my machine with the other ingredients and then added the 1 1/2 cups water.  TOO STICKY!!  I'm not sure exactly how much flour I ended up adding, but I would say it was easily more than a cup.  The second batch I made with only 1 cup of the water to start..I ended up adding maybe an additional tablespoon of water to form into a lovely smooth dough.  Be prepared to make a few minor adjustments..but be prepared to ENJOY your delicious pizza.  This makes a very tasty start to any pizza.

It might be my fault because I tried to put it in the bread machine on the dough cycle, but it didn't really form a dough.  It needed a ton more flour than was called for.

Jay,I have to say I have tried many crust recipes and yours is THE BEST. I found I had enough dough to make two 16" pizzas and the crusts were soft and chewy. I can now stop looking for the ultimate crust recipe,it's in my receipe box.

Jay - this recipe IS FANTASTIC!!!!!! We love it! Altho, I should have made 2 pizza crusts out of it rather than 1 bec it was too much dough for one pizza (I have a smaller stone than what you probably use). Anyways.........thanks again, this is truly a great homemade pizza dough recipe! Bring on some more of your signature recipes!!!

This is a very workable pizza dough...which for me is half the battle.  I did have to use quite a bit of flour to make the dough "not sticky", but once I got there it was a very nice texture.  My husband says it's his favorite pizza crust yet (and believe me, I've tried a lot of them).  I also liked this crust...although I'm still a little partial to my mother's recipe.  Maybe it's because she used to take the extra dough, braid it, bake it then slather it with butter.  Anyway, thumbs up to this recipe.  Thanks Jay!!!

Excellent recipe. I've been making this recipe for many years. I suggest checking the temp of your water before adding yeast. Too cold or hot can affect your results. I like 105-115 F  Whisk the yeast, water and brown sugar (I like Dark Brown sugar but light works also) together and let sit for 10 minutes. The sugar feeds the yeast so don't omit the sugar. I use ungreased parchment paper on a pizza stone or pizza pan. Great results. OPT- Brush baked crust with melted butter, garlic butter or garlic Parmesan butter.

I think this recipe is great but I would like to share that how your crust turns out depends on what kind of pan you use. I doubled the recipe and used 2 big pans. One was an air bake cookie sheet and the bottom didn't get crispy it was more doughy and the other was a new Wilton non stick heavy duty pan and the crust was perfect

This crust is so delicious.  I've never made a homemade pizza before, but it turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again.

My go-to pizza dough recipe. I use instant yeast and skip the sugar. I also increase flour by about to 2 cups.

THIS is my go-to pizza crust! I've tried different variations on the main theme:

Beer instead of water -- nice flavor
Spiced Olive Oil (Roasted Garlic with Rosemary is great)
Ground Black Peppercorns, Basil, and Oregano

These will enhance a nice deep-dish pizza!

Thanks, Jay!

This has become my go-to pizza crust.  I've been making it for quite some time (we make our pizza at home, since we're on a tight budget). I've occasionally strayed and tried other pizza crust recipes, but I always come back to Jay's! Most recently, I used 1 tbsp. of brown sugar instead of the 1/2 tsp. the recipe calls for. Wow!! This made an even chewier-on-the-inside, crisp-on-the-outside crust, so I'll use this tweak from now on. :)

makes good pizza. I recommend cooking the pizza at 550 F or hotter (as hot as your oven will go). The pizza will cook much more quickly, the crust will actually be closer to NYC quality pizza and the cheese will get all bubbly and perfect within 8 to 10 minutes. Try it and you will never settle for a cold oven again when cooking pizza.
P.S. ask at a pizza joint how hot the oven is set to...it's going to be a far sight hotter than 425 F.

Great Base Recipe! The taste is awesome and I'm going to use it for calzones as well. The only thing I would do different is try to flatten the dough much thinner before baking, because as others noted, it is quite a lot of dough, and even with an extra large pan the cooked dough was just a little to thick than I would prefer.

I made this two nights in  a row. The first night I used my kitchen aid dough kneader and it turned out "ok". The second night I followed the video and directions exactly and I loved the result! One change- I used about 1/3 c whole wheat flour. Next time I will increase the ww flour ratio. 
I also learned how to use a pizza stone - it is important to heat the stone for 10 min at a preheated temp of about 400, and also to generously flour the stone before putting the dough on. This made it exceptional!

Great crust recipe - I would give it 5 stars but I made some modifications which in my opinion make it better.  I add an extra tbsp of olive oil and an extra 1/2 tsp of salt.  The second time I made this recipe was when I realised my mistake the first time, which is you really have to knead that dough for about 10 minutes!  It really makes the difference.

I've made this twice and it was my first and second ever attempt at pizza dough or dough of any kind!  I followed the recipe exactly - the second time I made it (because it makes 2 large thin crust pizzas) I put half the dough in the fridge overnight and it still made delicious pizza the following day.
Thanks for this easy and awesome recipe!

I have never made a pizza from scratch, but will definitely be making it this way from now on.   I made a few of the recommended changes ( 1/2 teaspoon extra brown sugar and salt) and it was fabulous, and so easy using my stand mixer.  The only issue I had was that I underestimated how much it would rise in the oven and didn't roll it out enough, and it came out a little too thick for my liking (still tasted fabulous though). Those that rated this low stating it didn't rise probably had issues with the yeast, if made correctly (with good yeast and water the correct temp) it rises just fine. Also, you will get better results if you pre bake at least five minutes before adding the toppings and bake at 450 instead of 425. I am a novice when it comes to using a pizza stone and pizza peel, next time instead of two larger pizza I may try three smaller ones with a thinner crust that will be easier to manage. Made it with the Easy pizza sauce III recipe from this site and shredded my own mozzarella cheese, topped the kid's with pepperoni and the adult's with lots of fresh veggies as well....amazing!!!!!  My nine yr. old said it was better than take out.  Try this recipe, even if you are a novice pizza maker like me, you won't regret it!

Have tried a lot of crust recipes and this one is by far the best!  I found that there are a couple of keys to the best result. I mix the dough in a stand mixer and then transfer to an oil coated bowl, forming a ball and making sure the dough is coated with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap coated with cooking spray to let rise. The olive oil coating on the dough seems to be one key. I've skipped this step before and let it rise in the mixing bowl & it wasn't as good. This recipe makes 2 approximately 12" crusts for me. I use a rolling pin and a lightly floured surface to shape the crusts, pre bake on  a pre heated pizza stone at 500 degrees for 5 minutes and use a fork to poke some holes in the crust prior to baking, it still puffs a bit. The pre baking on a pre heated stone is another key. A pizza peel generously sprinkled with cornmeal helps with getting the crust on the hot stone. Also sprinkle the stone with a little corn meal right before placing the crust. I don't always top and bake right away. Bake as long as the toppings need at 500 degrees. I sometimes turn on the convection for a minute to brown up the top. Pre baking on a stone makes the crust crispy on the bottom, but still bread like in the middle.  "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" from this site is a great sauce!

This was a good pizza crust.  I baked on a greased insulated cookie sheet and it crisped up nicely.  After leaving on the pan throughout dinner, though, the pizza got increasingly softer.  Maybe next time I'll put it on a cookie rack to cool so it will stay crispy.  I cooked it without toppings for 7min, then added toppings and baked for another 8 or 9 or so.

This is a wonderful, basic recipe for dough. I prepared it exactly as instructed and used a dough hook and mixer. After adding the first 2 1/2 cups of flour to the dough, it seemed way too wet, or not dough like. Mine didn't ball up like other breads do. But, as the instructions stated, I turned that "dough" onto a well-floured surface. I ended up adding close to one additional cup of flour when working the dough. It still seemed not dough-like enough, but I left it as is. 

After allowing the dough to rise for an hour, it turned out fabulously! It was easy to roll; not too many air pockets like other crusts have often had. 


I baked my crust on a pizza pan for about 8 minutes at 425, before adding my toppings. I then cooked it an additional 8 minutes with 2 minutes of broiling. I like doing this so the center of the pizza isn't so soggy and the toppings are really cooked. I'm glad I did because the pizza dough still wasn't cooked quite as much as I'd like. 

I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

Best pizza crust ever.  I use 100% whole wheat flour instead of the white, and it STILL comes out perfectly!!

I've been using this recipe frequently for the last few years.  It makes a great pan pizza, and a pretty good thin-crust pizza, too.  I had tried out other recipes that turned out fine when fresh but that got tough or gummy when I re-heated the leftover pizza for lunch the next morning.  This recipe makes the best leftover crust I've yet had. 

I have successfully used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour for a more substantial crust, and it works very well.  

I usually let the bread machine mix up the dough for me (though I usually have to add 1/4-1/2 cup more flour) and then pat or roll it out.  I especially like baking it on a stone, but it works fine in a regular pan, too.

My dough came out tough and chewy.  I didn't like it at all.  It also lacked flavor.  I will look for another recipe.

I have the allrecipies cookbook and this is the pizza crust I have been using for years.Very soft and breadlike. Raises quite a lot. I always double it and makes 3 pizzas.

This was so, so good.  I did goof a little and made it really thick, but it was crisp on the outside and super chewy inside.  Great recipe!  Topped with My Little Italian Aunts' Sauce, meatballs, sliced onions, sliced garden tomatoes, and mozzarella.  Can't wait to try more and more toppings.  Thanks, Jason!

Best pizza crust EVER! I've made this crust dozens of times now, and I'm always happy with the results. We've even rolled string cheese into the edges of the crust before baking and it makes the perfect stuffed crust. Love it.

This is the only pizza crust recipe that I use now. I used to use a bread machine recipe, but then I found this and will never use another recipe. The only suggestion I have, is to pre-bake the crust, that way it gets nice and crispy.

This is soooo easy!   We love to let our kids make their own personal sized pizzas.  Some roll this into a very thin crust while others make theirs very thick, and either way, its turns out perfectly.

This is a great recipe! It is said that this recipe is comparible to pizza hut so I tried it. I have to say, it is even better than pizza hut! It isn't too greasy and there is a perfect crispness to the dough. I made it just like the recipe instructed but I think I may try it in the bread machine next. Don't forget to pre-bake the crust for about 5 minutes ahead of time. Happy baking!

i've been looking for a really great pizza crust receipe and i must say this receipe was excellent. My husband and daughter loved it!! I followed the recipe to the letter. The dough was a bit sticky at first but after adding the additional flour it came together nicely. Didn't have a pizza stone I baked it on a tray using foil at the bottom. Easy clean up, great tasting crust, crunchy outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Definitely my go to recipe.

I used whole wheat flour and it still was great! I have been looking for a good whole wheat pizza crust, and something about this recipe really worked well for me! Usually my crusts ate heavy and crumbly, but this one was much lighter and doughier. I will def be using this again.

I made this today and it was the best pizza crust I've ever made.  The only thing I did a little different was I made it a stuffed crust by putting cheese on the edges and folding them over as the dough was bigger than my pizza pan.  Very good soft and chewy, this will be a keeper.

This is a great recipe -- if you make a few changes!  It needs more flour.  I add more flour in step two...about 3/4 cup more.  Also, I set the servings to 10 servings in order to make a more normal sized pizza crust.  I also replace the brown sugar with sucanat for a more unique flavor.  Yum!

Such a great dough recipe.  I did end up adding 3 2/3 cups of flour, but still really simple and easy to follow recipe.  It is a lot of pizza dough though so if you don't care for such a thick crust you can just divide the dough ball into two balls before you punch it out.  That's what I did and I'll just pop it in the freezer for the next pizza night!

Great recipe - very easy and so worth the extra time it takes to prepare (vs. store bought). All thumbs up in my family. I've added about a 1/4 cup of sourdough starter, when I have any available, and it adds an extra depth of flavour. Update 2014: This recipe has become my pizza dough staple - I've used it successfully for years. It's great on a pizza stone in the oven or on the BBQ.

This recipe is fantastic! I swear. It came out so chewy and good, and moist. I just combined all the ingredients before adding the water, but that's because my yeast doesn't work right otherwise. Also, I used bread flour instead of all purpose, because I only had bread flour. This was a flawless recipe, and I will be using it often.

This recipe is simple and excellent.  I scaled the serving size down to 10 and it made enough dough to completely cover a 14" round pizza pan with about 2" of dough overhanging the outside edge of the pan.  I rolled the dough inward to make a good sized crust.  I paired this with the exquisite pizza sauce and tweaked it to my liking a bit and it came out great.  Also I didn't have to precook the dough, I just cooked it at 425 and took it out when the cheese was nice and golden brown.

This is an excellent pizza crust.  I change it by using 1c. whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c. white flour mixed with 2heaping tbsp of italian seasoning.  It gives the crust more flavor.

Outstanding !!!    Thank you Jayson Sharp !

I used a mixer with a dough hook for 7 min of mixing. I added 3 1/2 cups of flower so the dough does not stick to the hook and the rest per the recipe.

I use a pizza stone at 400 degrees and cook the pizza for 8 min only...Perfect. 

Also my sauce is precooked, so the fast cook time is not a problem.

So simple to make when using a bread machine . I set on "Dough" cycle rather than "Piazza Dough" . When done i pressed dough down in pan with two fingers then allowed machine to knead dough 20 times. After removing dough from machine I placed on floured surface and allowed to rest for 10 minutes.
The sky's the limit with this recipe.  My first attempt was stromboli. The dough makes 4 6"x8" rectangles. I will add a bit more flour next time since the dough was just a bit too sticky for easy rolling once toppings in place.
FYI: I used white whole wheat flour to add more nutrition and the texture was quite good.

This is by far one of the best pizza crust recipes I've found! I modified this recipe by making it a "stuffed crust" pizza. I cut mozzarella cheese sticks in half lengthwise. I rolled the dough out about 1 1/2 inches wider than the pie plate, placed the cheese stick halves around the plate edge, then folded the extra dough over and crimped the fold with a fork. I topped it with pizza sauce, added my ingredients, and it made a perfect stuffed crust pizza.

It took me 3 tries to get this right.  I had no idea how long to knead, so after it only rising slightly the first two times i kneaded by hand, I finally just set my kitchenaide dough hook on it for several minutes and must have added another cup of flour.  Then it almost doubled in size, and tasted MUCH better.  I also added some onion powder and garlic powder.  I baked it in a 14" cake pan for 15 minutes before adding toppings.  Good bye papa john's!

pretty good- I followed the recipe as it was.  Was it the best thing I have ever had- no, would I make it again- absolutely.  When the recipe calls to continue to mix in flour until it reaches the consistency needed, I did have to mix in quite a bit.

as good, if not better, than the local store bought doughs.  Easy to make, inexpensive to make and so very delicious.  I have tried many other recipes but this is the first keeper!

The easiest!  Makes a VERY large pizza or 2 mediums that will each feed my husband and I dinner and a quick slice the next day for lunch!  Great with an oil and garlic or Parmesan spread on the edge of the crust!

This recipe delivered. I was having friends over for dinner and realized half an hour they were supposed to arrive that neither of my pizzas had gone in the oven and no food was on the table. I could not afford for anything to go wrong as I was flying around the kitchen, defrosting pita, putting out dips, grilling veggies and assembling my two pizzas, and this pizza crust recipe did not disappoint. After prebaking for five minutes the crusts (I made two crusts from a single recipe) puffed up well and were beginning to brown lightly. The toppings went on and in about fifteen minutes (slightly less) I had two show stopping pizzas on my hands. My guests raved and kept eating the pizza despite their complaints of being so full that they would explode. The result in itself would be reason enough to make this recipe, but it is also one of the easiest crust recipes out there. Try it and you'll be glad you did. This is the only crust recipe I'm using from now on.

This was a good crust recipie especially for me since it was my fist time. The dough was really plain and needed some seasonings so next time I will add what it was missing.

Awesome! I rolled it super thin , uped the oven temp to 475. Used a pizza stone and put the cheese on first then the sauce and toppings. Try it it's the only way I make pizza now!

The best homemade pizza dough I've ever had, much less made myself!  It was soft with just the right amount of chewiness, and pretty easy to make.  My husband kept saying, "This is the BEST pizza you've ever made!" and the guests we had over for dinner wanted the recipe.  Thanks!!

I've made several Pizza Crust recipes over the years and I have to say that this one is my favorite.  It's easy, quick, comes out excellent, and tastes great.  I am so happy I tried it.  I made 2 double batches yesterday (so doubling works well) and I made it the day before.  All great.  Thanks Jay!!!

This was good (but not my best in my hubby's opinion and mine too).  I didn't use all the water.  Still had 1/3 cup water leftover. Hubby liked the crispiness of the crust but prefers my pizza. I think I will stick with bread flour but thank you for posting.  I like experimenting and trying other recipes.

Delicious! This made enough for a large pizza, and then I used a chunk of the dough for garlic breadsticks to go with. My boyfriend and I were both overwhelmingly surprised with how great this turned out, thanks!

Thick, chewy & crunchy! Mixed dough in KitchenAid with the dough hook, and it was a little sticky. Pushed into a 12" pie pan (dusted with cornmeal)with fingers, and pre-baked crust for 10 minutes. Even leftovers were delicious.

Thanks Jay, great recipe!  I asked a couple questions about this on The Buzz and with Buzzers advice, I was able to make 2 pizzas from this amount of dough.  Also, I put it directly on a cold pizza stone and that went in the oven pretty close to 20 minutes.  Forget about rolling out the dough.  It was WAY too sticky.  I put a little olive oil on the stone and on my clean hands and stretched it to cover.  Great flavor, texture and crispness.  No more frozen pizza for me!

This is a great recipe, but it makes twice as many pizzas as the recipe says. I usually make the full recipes and freeze the other half for another day. It freezes really well. If you want an amazing recipe, add 2 tablespoons of honey after the yeast activates. You'll need a little more flour to make up for the extra moisture, but the honey gives the dough a slightly sweet flavor that is to die for. I've also added garlic and/or italian seasoning with the flour and it turns out great as well!

This crust was awesome! I really liked how light and fluffy it turns out. Great flavor and texture. I stuffed the crust with grated mozzarella which was a nice touch as well. I made this for a group of guys and it got devoured! Also, I let it rise in the fridge while I went out for the afternoon and when I got home it was perfectly risen, ready to punch down and roll out. This is my favorite crust recipe I've ever tried.

Decent pizza. Pizza was still doughy and was placed for an additional 10 min in the oven.considering I made this without the breadmaker and the yeast kept dying, it took too long to make. I did jazz it up with lots of garlic powder and parmesan cheese on the crust.

Awesome pizza crust!  I used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour with great results.  Like other people said this recipe is enough for 2 standard size pizza crusts.  Just freeze the unused portion.

This is the fourth pizza crust recipe I've tried from this site, and hands down, this is the best.  Mixed & kneaded in the KA and added a little more flour to reach the consistency where you could work with the dough.   The texture was perfect, and as important, it really tasted good!  I made two 12" pies, but next time, I'm going to try three because we like really thin crust.  Thanks, Jay.

This pizza crust is awesome!  On the grill, in the oven, frozen then thawed, doesn't matter.  It's always a winner.  I add a bit of garlic powder and some Italian seasoning and it's incredible.

I haven't tried - too many negative reviews when you sort by rating but I have a very good pizza dough recipe from American Test Kitchen that is so similar that maybe with the few changes those that got poor results will find improvement.    ATK's recipe calls for 1 3/4 cups water to 4 cups BREAD flour.  They recommend that you use a food processor to mix dough if you have a 11 cup capacity or larger food processor.  It works great. Also for more flavor they recommend sauteing garlic with your favorite pizza herb(s) in the oil and letting it cool before adding to the recipe. ATK also feels a pizza stone or tiles are a must and that the oven should be preheated to and the pizza cooked at 500 degrees.  (The surface temperature of the stone or tiles should be 500 degrees before placing the pizza on it.  This requires at least 30 minutes of preheating your oven.) They use 6" square, 1/2 " thick unglazed terra cotta quary tiles which are cheaper to purchase and easier to store than a good pizza stone.  I'm a novice at pizza baking but get excellent results with this method.  Good luck.

just like kristinglori, I followed everything to the letter and it was a terrible consistancy when poured out of bowl. I had to add much more flour and wash my hands off because the dough was like a soupy bread mix and no way to incorporate more flour without it gluing to my hands.
 I can't understand how the other reviews can be so good when there is no way the amounts are correct.

Great crust.  It works great for personal pan pizzas.  Just separate into three or four equal pieces.  The crusty outside is wonderful.

the pizza dough is great however if you want a thin crust beware this is not the recipe for you! if you want a thin crust take the dough and cut it into thirds and make three separate pizzas (thats what i did) because the crust is thin and perfect if you do it that way. pizza was delicious and the crust was tasty but very doughy!

This was a great pizza crust.  I used it for gilling my pizza but im sure it would be great on a pizza stone as well.  I will make this again.  Had great texture and flavor.

This is good and easy! However this crust is really thick and I like thin crust better. I think I will play with it to see if I can get it a bit thinner and crispier. This would make really good bread sticks.

Thanks Jay for this really good recipe for pizza crust.  I followed the recipe exactly and mine came out great.  It made more then I expected which is good because next time I know I can make two slightly thinner pizza's.  I did a tomatoe and fresh basil pizza and it turned out delicious.  I took so much pride in telling everyone I made the entire pizza from scratch with a little help from your recipe.  Thank you again.

SO easy, and very good, if a little plain.  Easy to remedy, but it definitely needs spicing up.  Cooked it on the grill (brush w/ olive oil, cook on one side, flip, add toppings) & it worked perfectly.

this is a fantastic recipe as written. I like to make it using half whole wheat, and even all whole wheat and it still tastes great. I usually make only one pizza, so the extra dough I will roll out into 4-6 inch circles and put in the oven and they turn out like pita bread! my whole family love it!

This crust is absolutely delicious! Even with my pizza stone the crust was still doughy in the middle. I figure it's my oven causing the issues, so I will pre-bake the crusts from now on. This recipe yields two large pizza's. I make my own pizza sauce from scratch. It's the pizza sauce for Rachel Ray's french bread pizza. -2 pts cherry tomatoes -1 head of garlic -EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) -salt & pepper. Toss the tomatoes  w/ EVOO on a cookie sheet lined with foil. Salt & pepper to taste. Peel the skin off the head of garlic (leaving it intact) drizzle with EVOO and wrap in foil. Place it on the cookie sheet(if there's room) or directly on the oven rack. Roast the Garlic and tomatoes at 350° for about 25-30 mins. Allow tomatoes to rest a couple minutes, open garlic to allow to rest also. Remove cloves from garlic and add to a large bowl, add tomatoes and mash with potato masher, until desired consistency. Season w/ salt & Pepper if needed and then spread on pizza crust. --Yum-O!

In spite of me being an experienced bread baker, and in spite of all the rave reviews, I can barely give this 3 stars, but as one person, I don't want to affect the rating too much.  I followed the directions exactly, which it appears no one else does, and I was lucky I didn't crack a tooth on this pizza crust.  It turned out flat and hard.  I read the reviews again to see what "I" did wrong, and I see that there is a lot of changing,  adjusting and fussing to get this crust just right.  Will not make again.

First pizza crust I've ever made, and it was much better than the store bought crusts I've gotten in the past! Relatively easy and quick to make. I only added dried basil and sea salt to the crust. Yum!

Absolutely the BEST pizza dough recipe I've ever tried.  I do end up using quite a bit more flour than called for, cause it's still very very sticky and runny after the 3 1/3 it calls for.

This is an awesome crust, and my new "go to" pizza crust.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there's not really any need to let it rise for an hour.  I greased a large jelly roll pan, plopped my dough on there for about 10 mins and then easily worked it into place.  I naked-baked at 475º for 10 mins removed it from the oven, sauced and put it back in for 10 mins on the lowest rack at the same heat setting.  What I did next is a secret, you're not getting all my tricks ;) But needless to say the 2 baking times of 10 min each at 475º produced the perfect crispy crust that I was looking for!  Well done, friend.

A good, basic pizza crust.  I made a double batch, divided it in four pieces and froze them.  It's been very handy to have on hand for a quick pizza.

My kids went nuts for this pizza crust.  As did I. :)  It was a still a bit sticky when I tried to roll it out, so I ripped a few holes in it, but overall it was just delicious.

The outcome of this recipe surprised me. When I read "brown sugar" my mind immediately went to "in white crust? Yuk!" It turned out quite lovely, though, and really huge. My husband, who enjoys a thicker type Sicilian crust, was truly wild about it. It's too thick for me as one crust, so I'll either have to use a larger pan, or make two pizzas in the future. The texture is exactly what we always hope for, tender inside and slightly crunchy on the exterior. Thank you very much, Jason. This will definitely be in my best recipes folder.

Thank you!!! This was my last chance to find a pizza crust that made the family happy or I was going to have to throw in the towel and order out. I think I used a little less flour when kneading in the last cup but it turned out great!  I will definitely be making this again!

Awesome as is or you can add seasonings to flavor it up some. I try to bake mine for about 10 mins before I top it as others have suggested.

A very good, basic crust.  Dough is soft, smooth, a bit chewy.  You can easily add extra seasonings if you would like, but it tastes fantastic as it is.  Easy to make.  This is definitely my new first choice when it comes to crust.

My dough was incredibly sticky and hard to work with. I tried to cut the recipe though, so I wonder if allrecipes just messed up the calculations of flour and/or water. Once I managed to get it onto the pan and baked, though, it turned out to be a pretty good basic pizza crust recipe.

Wow! I've been looking forever for a good crust like this. This was excellent!! I used my kitchenaid to mix and knead the dough. I also did as other reviewers suggested and added a little Garlic and onion powder. I think I added 1\4 tsp garlic powder 1\2 tsp onion powder. I didn't really notice the taste of either, so next time I may add a little more of each. I got a large round pizza out of the dough and it was nice and soft inside with a crunchy crust. Just perfect!

The crust turned out great - exactly as stated (soft on the inside, chewy on the outside). I didn't think the amount it made was "giant," it made a large pizza exactly, which made me wish I did not listen to the reviewer who said it easily makes two pizza crusts, because I prepared toppings for two pizzas and was only able to make one of them. Otherwise, it turned out great and I will enjoy making this again!

The dishes aren't even washed yet and I had to post my rave review. This was the best homemade crust I've ever made/had! I followed the recipe and some of the reviewers who recommended pre-baking the crust before topping the pizza. After the initial rising, I put it my jelly roll pan (which it fit in perfectly) and let it rise another hour. Baked it for 8 minutes at 425 and took it out, topped it and baked it another 10 minutes. Absolutely perfect! This recipe will also replace my foccacia recipe which never seems to be airy and crisp like this dough was.   Highly recommend this one!

Have made a couple different ways as written and with modifications.  With modifications made a very good crust.  Instead of water I used milk.  I used 2 cups of bread flour and 1 and 1/3 cup of semolina four.  I baked on a pizza stone for 13 minutes at 500 degrees.  I let the pizza stone bake so it was nice and hot for about 30 min before putting the pizza on.

Makes a large pizza with THICK crust!! :) Delicious, but next time I'll be cutting everything in half to make a thinner crusted pizza.  Crust has a nice crunch to it, while being soft on the inside.

My first time making crust from scratch & it turned out soooo good. The dough took a little longer to rise than an hour, more like hour & a half. I baked it on a pizza stone & piled on the sauce & toppings. Was not soggy at all just super delicious! Great recipe, will definitely be using again soon.

OMG YUM!!!  I have been making pizza for a year now and have tried alot of recipes over that year and this one  is the best for sure.   (if you have the utensil to put butter on the crust I would most certainly do that it, kinda reminds me of pizza hut crust)

Awesome crust!  We chose to make it in a pan and it was the best we've ever had.  Used the one hour rising time to brown our Italian sausage and chop some mushrooms.  No more take-out or box mixes for us.

My first time making a crust, it was very good! I added some dried oregano and basil...added a nice flavor. I also suggest preparing the pizza on what you are going to be baking it on because I didn't and had to transfer it from the counter to the pizza stone...it ended up looking funny but still tasted good!

Fantastic! I usually grease my pan with olive oil and sprinkle with Corn meal. I also melted butter and garlic power and brushed it on the baked crust. This pizza Crust will replace my old favorite! No changes are necessary, it really is EASY and perfect as written.

This was really good but took a lot of work.  The dough took longer than 1 hour to double in size.  I needed to add a lot more flour so it wasn't sticky.  I baked mine on a stone but still cooked the dough for a little while before adding the toppings.  I will make this again but plan for more time and flour.

Made a huge rectangle pizza with an oversized cookie sheet. Baked dough for 8 minutes before putting the toppings on to crisp up the crust a little.

This was my first time making  homemade pizza and it turned out great. My only real complaint is that the crust didn't brown, but the taste and texture were spot-on. I used my bread machine (only my 2nd time using it) to mix the dough and let it rise for an hour. I used the dough to make one 13" hand tossed style cheese pizza. Baked @ 500 degrees on my pizza stone for about 12 minutes. This was so easy and tasted so good that I will definitely be making it again and again! No more take-out pizza for us :)

I keep using this recipe everytime I make pizza. It's great. Just like Pizza hut crust when it's just came out of the oven. But I never use 1,5c water. 1 cup is enough. But next time I will try 1,5c to see if it made the crust lighter and softer.

The only change I made was to substitute the 1/3 cup of flour for milled flax (just for a healthy touch!). This was the first time I've worked with yeast, and it was relatively successful. I made two, standard pan size thin crust pizzas with this... Be sure to adjust cooking time accordingly. Made veggie and chicken pizzas that my guests loved. Will be a repeat in this house!

Followed the recipe exactly and the crusts turned out well! Forgot to add in the olive oil during mixing but it didn't seems to matter at all... =)

I used this recipe to make calzones. The crust has a very nice flavor and was almost perfect for crisp and chewiness. Will definitely continue to use this for my homemade pizzas.

Making this dough right now. I'm fairly new to making pizza dough, and I find this recipe very easy to do for beginners. My 7 and 8 year old helps out with this and we have fun every time. We added garlic powder to mix. Very tasty and makes two nice sized pizzas. Will never buy pre-made pizza dough again. Thanks ~MsDD

This is my first time making pizza dough from scratch and it has been a huge success.  The outer edge crust is soft and chewy on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside.  I brushed some olive oil on the edges before baking to help it brown a little.  I made a Roma tomato, Basil and cheese pizza and the smell from the kitchen was wonderful.  Thank you for such a great recipe.  I may never buy frozen pizza ever again.

Excellent, excellent pizza crust.  I was thinking about making a pizza tonight, and this seems to be a sign!  I added some Italian seasoning to the dough for a little more flavor.  I used a round Green Pan to bake it.

***I made it again tonight, cutting the water back to 1.25C.  It is FAR less sticky and far easier to work with.

This is the best pizza crust ever!  I usually don't rate things but this time it was worth it.  My family loved it and couldn't believe how the pizza was an inch and a half high at least! It will be a regular family recipe from now on.  Thank you!

WONDERFUL! I sprinkled oregano, basil, coarse salt, ground pepper, rosemary, and garlic powder around the edges of the crust after brushing it with olive oil. Then about 5 minutes before I took the pizza out, I sprinkled fresh grated parmesan over the crust and toppings.

Great recipe, and you can definitely tweak it by throwing some spices or parmesean cheese in with the flour!  I've made this twice, and both times substituted increasing amounts of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour and it came out great (started with 1 1/2 cups and then 2 cups)!  The first time I made one pizza with this recipe and it was a very thick crust.  Second time, I split the dough in half, froze part and made a thinner crusted pizza with the other.  It was still thick enough for our tastes!

Best pizza crust ever!!! Made this tonight and it was crispy on the outside! I cooked mine a little too long so the inner dough was a little dry but that was my fault. I learned that if you wait until its light brown and then remove from the pan and put directly onto the oven rack you can get the bottom crispy as well. Will be putting this in my recipe box, its my new go to pizza crust recipe!

Made recipe as written, but in my bread machine on dough cycle.  This crust was a little bland, and kinda sticky to work with.  I would make again, however, I will also try the other recipes on this site for pizza dough..Thanks for sharing!!

The recipe doesn't specify the size of the pan to use, but my 13 in pizza stone was not big enough.  The taste itself was okay.  I made three pizzas, the first one was doughy, the second one decent enough, the third one blew up.

The recipe worked pretty well. I subbed the all-purpose flour for whole wheat (trying to be healthy, ya know). The only problem I had was there was so much dough, it made the pizza extremely thick. Probably just should have used half of it, but it was my first time making homemade pizza.

My first review...I followed recipe as close as I could. I did take the advice of baking it for 10 mins before adding toppings because I was using a large pizza pan...let me tell you this crust is AWESOME!!!! Kids gobbled it up and I had to threaten my brother when he came by just so I can have a couple slices for tomorrow. He was totally amazed at how good it was. I used a pizza sauce recipe from this site and that was amazing as well. I've committed to mainly using recipes from this site for the remainder of the year as a fun project for myself and this is one I can see using over and over and over again. We're going to save a lot of money on take out pizzas from now on!!! Thanks Jay!!! ***I brushed crust with garlic infused olive oil prior to baking with toppings...**totally awesome. Next time I'm going to try a cheese stuffed crust...this recipe makes a LOT of crust...which is great!

Made the crust as directed.  Baked on pizza stone for 10 minutes prior to putting on the toppings.  Baked loaded pizza for 20 minutes.  The cheese was starting to blacken and the crust was "wilty" in the middle.  Not the crust we are use to that you can pick up and eat with one hand!

Easy I used this dough make Hot pockets after trying several other types of dough.  This is my fav by far.  JUst simply roll to desire size stuff with what ever you want (I use everything from pep and moz cheese to ham and cheddar cheese.  Left overs work well too such as chicken or roast just add some veggies and brush dough with left over gravy or jar gravy) Bake on a greased cookie sheet dusted with corn meal @ 350 for 25 minutes.  You can also freeze them to reheat at a later date.

Good, reliable crust. Not too sticky to handle, unlike other recipes. Nothing amazing our outstanding about it, but it makes a good, thick crust that gets better the longer it rises.

I made this dough in my bread machine.  It is okay in the oven, but is awesome on the grill.  I threw it on the grill for two minutes, took it off and  added refried beans, taco meat and cheddar cheese to the precooked side.  Cooked it about 3-4 more minutes, until the cheese was melted.  I took it off and added lettuce and tomato.  It was very good.

Fantastic! I hadn't made any dough from scratch for a couple years and was suddenly taken by the urge to. I'm so glad I chose this recipe & will definitely make it again! The dough was easy to make and super elastic to stretch out.  I found that I ended up only including 3 cups of flour before it rose, and when preparing to bake (kneading and rolling stage) I added the other 1/2 cup at that point as it had become sticky while rising. I used the tips others left and threw it in the oven for a couple minutes before adding the toppings, and it cooked all the way through.  Fabulous!

Fantastic recipe. I have been making this for a while. however it needs more flour and salt. I usually add dried basil or cumin seeds along with salt and oil to yeast mixture and then add the flour. delicious. Thanks Jason.

This recipe is great as it is written. The only thing I did was to bake the crust for 10 minutes before I added the topping and then I baked it again. This is the perfect pizza crust.

EZ and Excellent! Along with the salt, we threw in a little onion powder, garlic powder and oregano into the mixture. Let the covered (with a damp towel) dough rise in 100° oven for the hour. Finally spread the dough over a warmed stone slightly oiled. Delicious with our favorite toppings....sauce, fresh spinach, onion, peppers, broccoli, mushrooms and cheese. Yum, you won't be disappointed!

Don't understand the hype. The dough was bland and boring. I even added a little garlic powder and Italian seasoning. The only thing I can think is maybe I added too much flour because it's humid right now? It does make a ton of dough. Anyone wanna come over for a slice?  Update: I tried again using as little flour as possible and using sea salt instead of reg table salt. Turned out much much better. I don't have a pizza stone so I make my pizzas on cookie sheets. I wish the pieces held up like regular pizzas. Mine are soft, flimsy and need to be eaten with a fork.

I made this recipe twice.  I am so glad I tried it again.  It is the best crust.  Make sure that you let the yeast set 10 min. in the water.  I think that is what helped to make it thicker.  Also, I used stoneware the second time around which made the crust crispier.  Love this crust!  Will make again!

This is a great recipe. I swapped out the white flour for whole wheat (King Arthur) and subbed honey for the brown sugar. It was a great pizza dough. We added fresh mozzarella with a simple tomato sauce. Next time, I will up the honey a bit because the whole wheat flour can handle some additional sweetness. I also used my kitchen aid mixer and beat it in the bowl with the dough hook for about 6-7 minutes. YUMMY!

this was my first time making a crust from scratch. it was so easy and so delicious! my kitchen-aid mixer made it so simple to do! i found i needed a bit more flour than it called for (it was a rainy day, probably why), and i needed more time for my toppings to bake. crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside! i mixed olive oil with a little italian seasoning, garlic powder and salt and brushed that over the entire crust before i added my toppings (pesto, fresh mozz, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, DELICIOUS!!!)

This was my first attempt at making a homemade pizza crust, and it turned out fine.  I made it, let it rise, punched it down, and then divided it into 4 balls.  I used one for a small thin-crust pizza and froze the other 3 for later.

Easier way: There is no reason to proof the yeast.  I refrigerate my yeast and it's still fine after 8 months. Put all ingredients EXCEPT the warm water into a food processor fitted with steel blade and pulse a few times. Turn on the processor and pour the warm water slowly into the feed tube. Process until the dough forms a ball. Let rise, punch down, place dough in oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and then refrigerate overnight. Use about 9 oz. for an 8 to 9 inch pie. For a tasty margarita pizza, sprinkle unbaked crust with a generous coating of shredded mozzarella, add about 8 cherry tomatoes cut in half with cut side up, sprinkle with salt, pepper, dry basil, garlic powder, and then drizzle on some extra-virgin olive oil. Bake about 15 minutes on a pre-heated stone at 425ºF. Check during baking to make sure pizza is not burning.

I make this all the time, but I use cornmeal instead of the additional flour, and add 2tsp of baking powder instead of the salt. Best Pizza dough ever, we don't order out any more.

This makes a wonderfully crispy and tasty pizza crust! It is worth the extra time it takes before it is oven ready.  Dough can be prepared ahead of time and then refrigerated for up to 2 or 3 days until ready to use.  I  prefer making personal size pizzas that can be baked more evenly and quicker. Stretch dough to desired size onto oiled cookie sheets or pizza pans.  Add desired toppings. Bake on lower rack at 425 degrees. Transfer pizza from pan to oven rack the last 3-5 minutes of baking time for a crispier crust. Total baking time is about 10 minutes for the personal size pizza.

I'm not great at crusts - this was easy.  it was soft and yummy!  if you like crispier crust, you might want to cook it 10 mintues before adding toppings.  I loved it as is - did add some seasoning!

Excellent!  I added some Italian seasoning and onion powder, but that was the only change I made.  This makes a LOT of dough.  I used a large rectangle pan and it baked up THICK like a pan pizza, which I really like.  If you prefer thinner crust or "hand-tossed" style, you could use a little over half the dough for the pizza, and make breadsticks with the rest.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

Good rising feature.  My only complaint was that it was a little bland, so on the next batch my son and I decided to add an additional 1/2 tsp salt.  That did the trick!  Good recipe - the second batch got the stamp of approval from the "gang" (my kids and their neighborhood friends).

I have made home made crust many times, but this is by far the best recipe I have used to date! It is very tender, yet crisp. I added oregano,garlic powder,onion powder,rosemary,pepper, and parsley so the crust was seasoned and pretty.I never use a peel, my favorite pizza pan?, a large well seasoned cast iron skillet,and whats really cool is it slides out in one piece pretty easily,this one is a keeper!

great crust, easy to make. after i prepared it i put it in the fridge for about 6 hours as i wasn't baking until later that evening. took it out and let it warm up to room temp for about an hour. then pre-cooked the crust for about 5 mins before adding the toppings! came out delicious!

Great recipe.  I've never made bread, crust, dough, etc from scratch but this was pretty simple.  I was able to make 2 jellyroll pan sized pizzas with the recipe & posted a pic of one of them (I was pic# 188 at the time of this review).

It was my first from scratch pizza crust, and it was nothing special. It was not crispy. The texture was not what I expected in a pizza crust. I should have made it thinner. I did cook it for about 10 mins before adding the topping, and I brushed with garlic powder and olive oil.

Really good pizza crust, a bit too chewy for my personal taste though, but others really enjoyed it. I followed the recipe as written. I will make this again, but I am still looking for a particular type of thinner, crispier homemade pizza crust. Thanks for sharing this :)

I halved the recipe for one larg thin crust pizza. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder + 1 TBS parmesan cheese + 1 tsb italian seasoning. I was making a thin crust so I just baked the crust and the toppings together. it was better and cheaper than any gross tasteless frozen pizza and not greasy like the delivered pizze.

Very good dough. Made it on a regular metal pizza pan, then slide it off when it was almost finished and browned the bottom & made it a little more crispy. Slid right off the pan very easy recipe. Double it and froze the second half.

i used my bread machine to make the dough for this, and the only change i made to the recipe was i used a full tsp of brown sugar rather than half. next time i'll use more (maybe a tablespoon or two) as i like my crust to be a little bit sweet. it did come out of the machine pretty sticky but it wasnt anything a floured cutting board couldnt fix :) i liked how i could shape it and make it as thick or thin as i wanted it and it held the shape (this would work well for thin crust pizza as well!) and i liked how it was actually chewy inside and crispy on the outside! thanks for the recipe, i think this will be my go to pizza dough recipe from now on.

This is a great recipe. I've used it numerous times, making it for family and guests alike. Everyone raves! My Dad told me it was better than the pizza he had at a five star restaurant. I follow the recipe almost exactly; but I usually use 2 cups of white flour and 1 1/3 cup of wheat. Also, seeing as Olive Oil is expensive, I sometimes substitute vegetable or canola oil. You really can't taste any difference. This recipe is a five star for sure. :)

Oh my, this was so delicious!  We don't like thick crust, so I made two large pizzas from one recipe.  I baked them on a heated pizza stone, and they came out wonderful!

This crust was so awesome.  It was very fluffy and soft.  Way better than anything you would get at pizza hut.  This will be the only pizza crust I will ever make.  Thanks so much Jason!

Awesome!  I made this in my bread machine with 2 teaspoons of garlic cloves and 2 tsps. of Italian Seasoning. I used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe from this site and baked it in my Lodge cast iron pizza pan.  What a wonderful recipe, no more take-out pizza for me ever!  Thanks for posting.

We love this crust! It's our go to homemade recipe! I figure 1 batch will give us 2 14" thin crust pizzas or 1 cookie sheet tray size thick crust. I prebake it for 10 minutes then add the toppings and bake for 10-15 more minutes. I use it with "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" from AR also. Very good!

We thought this was pretty darn amazing.  I took a tip from another review and baked it on a pizza stone in my gas grill.  I set the grill to high and left it there where it hovered around 450 to 500 degrees- it tasted just like something from a gourmet pizzeria. Browned and crispy on the outside, chewy, soft and moist on the inside.  Word of advice: only double this recipe if you want pizza dough coming out of your ears.  I didn't think it would be enough for a family of four as is, but doubling it I ended up with enough dough for 6 nice size pizzas- I ran out of cheese and made a garlic, olive oil and parmesan bread with one hunk of it. I ended up eating mine standing up because I was so busy cranking out the pies! Bonus: cool kitchen on a hot day.

I'm notorious for making super tough/hard pizza crust...crust that could crack teeth. But, this is a no brainer. I've made it a handful of times already, and each time it has baked perfectly. The 15 serving size is too big for my pizza stone, so I just divide the crust in 2, make a couple of balls and freeze one ball for later. I love to add Mrs. Dash seasoning to the dough, a little mozzarella cheese, garlic, etc. Also, I don't have one of those nifty wooden pizza spatulas to put the pizza on the stone, so I usually prepare the pizza on parchment paper and place it on top of the stone - voila! no sticky mess.

I made this in my stand mixer.  Worked very well.  I actually ended up using about 4 1/2 cups of flour.  Made two pizzas (about the size of a frozen).  Update - tried this in the bread machine and it was horrible.  To sticky to handle tried kneading more flour in but it didn't help.  Threw the dough away and baked a frozen.

Very easy! Very good! This was my first attempt at making pizza. Even though I will try this recipe again, I will still look for a better crust. If I could I would give it 4 1/2 stars.

It was a good recipe, but not outstanding. It was fun to try to make my own pizza dough. I think it's just as yummy and much easier to just buy pre-made dough.

Best pizza crust I have tried. I put all of the ingredients in my bread machine and let it do the work. I removed the dough before it switched to the baking cycle. Rolled out and poked center with a fork to bake evenly. Family loved it. Will use again.

This was an amazing pizza crust. It's definately thick. It made enough for 2 pizzas for my family and I. If you make just one and are cooking in a pan, definately cook it of for ten minutes first. I'll be making this instead od ordering out for now on.

This pizza crust was excellent. I used whole wheat flour and it turned out fine.  I also added some Italain seasoning to the crust for a little more flavor. Crust was thick, like pan pizza.

I tried this recipe on my family two weeks ago and they LOVED it! They loved that it was soft & chewy but could also be a little more crispy on a thin sheet. I made 4 pizzas for my sons birthday party this past weekend and they were all gone within two hours! I would say this is very close to Pizza Hut dough/crust in that you can make it a thick deep dish, or spread it out thin and it will taste just as good. So far I've printed out 4 copies to give to friends. This is a keeper! BTW-the original recipe says to roll out your dough but doesn't mention that you can actually get two crusts out of this recipe.

this was super easy. I will never buy pizza crust pre-made again. This is enough dough for a very large pizza.

I love this recipe and my husband does too. I make the dough in my food processor. Proof the yeast as directed, meanwhile mix 3 cups flour, the oil and salt together in food processor just to blend. When the yeast mixture is ready, add slowly while processor is on. Once the yeast mixture is absorbed, check the texture of the dough. I then add the extra 1/3 cup flour. Pulse until the dough is thoroughly kneaded and stretchy on outside. Continue rest of recipe as written.

I used one cup stone ground flour and 2 1/2 all purpose.  The crust was still very crispy on the outside and chewy on the outside.  It is very easily enough for two medium pizzas, or one very large pan pizza.

I wanted to make pizza since I got a new mixer for Christmas.  This was super easy with the dough hook. I made the regular serving size and it was a 13 inch pizza pan.  I do like my crust a little thick, but nothing drastic.  I just know from working at a pizza place that you MUST use a fork and poke holes in the bottom of your crust before adding any sauce. I will add some garlic and/or seasoning next time. (but that's just my personal taste) I will totally make this again!! Thanks!!

I love this crust.  I've been using it for a few months now, so I figured I should finally review it.  

We make homemade pizza almost every Friday and I make the dough, use half that day then freeze the other half for the next week.  It freezes just fine and half the recipe is more than enough to stretch over a large pizza stone.

I love it because it's crispy and light and airy inside.  Two thumbs way up!

AWESOME pizza crust. My family loves this.  I have used it for stromboli and have even mixed this up to wrap around hot dogs for my kids--(I tried it when they wanted hot dogs and we had no buns) Great treat.

Great fluffy pie crust. very thick american pie crust, but sooo tasty. I do not have a pizza stone. I throw a little corn meal in a half rack cookie sheet and then prebake it for 10 minutes, otherwise it is mushy in the middle.

I'm giving it a five, because I've had a hard time finding a crust I like.  "Jay's" is meant to be a thick crust, but I rolled mine as thin as I could get it, and it came out great.  My kids like thick crust, so I may let it go next time.  FYI: I used "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" from this site.  The two together = YUM!

I was very hopeful because of the great reviews this recipe had. I wanted to make homeade dough for calzones and thought I'd give this recipe a shot. I used my breadmachine and didn't change a thing about the recipe. I kept checking on it and it looked fine, but very "poufy." Then, when the timer went off, I went to get it out and it was awful. It was runny...more like batter than dough. I tried incorporating more flour but it couldn't be salvaged. I don't know if my water was too hot or the yeast wasn't good...I have no idea what went wrong.  I'm definitely going to try this again when I have time and inclination to make it by hand, and not in the breadmachine.

I had made pizza dough before, and the best I got was "similar to pizza". But this IS definately pizza dough - amazing! Easy to make, it did rise nicely, and it was delicious! I used it for the BBQ chicken calzones recipe. The ingredients given make 2 large pizzas.

First time making homeade crust and it was delicious.  Was very chewy inside and crispy outside. I will be making again very soon.  Also added more than 2 1/2 cups of flour at the end.  It was still too sticky to start kneading.

Excellent recipe. My first time making pizza from scratch and they were perfect. Recipe was very easy. I rolled the pizza dough out on a surface dusted with cornmeal because I like my pizza that way. I will try more crust recipes for fun but I am very pleased with this one for sure.

I've tweaked a recipe that I use every time I make pizza and to my surprise, it is EXACTLY like this one - well except I use white sugar.  But for some reason by following this recipe exactly, it was the best dough I've made yet!  YEA!  Don't change a thing.  Turns out picture perfect.  However, too much dough for me so I'll divide it in 1/2 next time.

Look no further.  This is it!  Perfect crust.  This amount makes 2 decent sized pizzas.  I used cookie sheets and rolled out to rectangular shapes.  The length of time you bake it depends on how thin you roll it.  I baked mine for just over 15 minutes.  For a pan pizza or thicker crust I think you'd need to go closer to 20 minutes.  Just fantastic!!!

The best recipe for pizza crust I have come across. I followed the recipe exactly...well, I did add about 1 tblsp of italian seasoning to the dough and it came out great. I divide the dough into five balls, roll it out, and put into cake pans for individual pizzas.  It makes it more like a pan crust. Delish!

Great recipe. I dont have a KA so i did this by hand and followed the recipe. I started with about 2.5 cups of flour in the mixing bowl and then kneaded in the rest. I kneaded it for about 5 min before letting it raise. Will definately make again.

I found that the dough that I let sit overnight in the fridge rose better the next day. I prebaked it for 10 minutes and then topped with toppings and baked for another 15 minutes. Delicious! My parents can't stop raving.

I looked through the recipes, ready to make pizza.  This one "sounded" great, so i tried it.  IT IS EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN A CRUST!!!  Perfect.  It really is crispy on the outside and chewy inside.  I am amazed and everyone was very pleased.  The clear winner.  I used garlic salt instead of salt. I did take my pizzas, which were deep dish, out of the 8in non-stick cake pans I used, 3/4 way through the baking, after they retained shape and placed them directly on the rack to finish.  So good!!! Thanks, Jay!!

Your crust was wonderful for grilled pizza. It was very simple to make (using a bread machine) and I was able to to stretch the recipe into 7 individual pizza crusts, thin and crispy style. As I rolled out the individual crusts, instead of a floured surface I used cornmeal instead. Other than that recipe was followed exactly.

Great recipe! You have to be generous with the flour so as to get the dough right but this is an excellent recipe for a good pizza crust.

I divided mine in half (I like a thinner crust and this was too much, so I made 2 pies).  I also added some red crushed pepper.  Used San Marzano crushed tomato sauce, sliced mozzarella and fresh basil for an out-of-this-world home-made pizza Napolitana. Everyone loved it!

Suggestions: Bake the crust for 5-7 minutes before adding toppings; then brush crust with olive oil, add toppings and bake!

I love the pizza crust this recipe yields; however, I used white sugar in place of brown one. I also added some onion powder and Italian seasoning to the dough. The result was a flavorful, chewy-on-the-outside and tender-on-the-inside pizza crust! Highly recommended!

Fantastic says it all! I rarely hand-make pizza, so I was a little nervous, but both pies came out perfect! 

I made Chicken Alfredo Pizza (minus the dough) from All-Recipes (recipe by lighthousekeeper)and worked in 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, 1/2 tablespoon rosemary, 1/2 tablespoon Italian seasoning, and a 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder into the dough.

I don't have a pizza stone, so I pre-cooked the dough for about 6-7 minutes before topping it. 
Yummy! Can't wait to make more!

Fantastic!  I doubled the recipe and it made two medium-thickness crusts for two large pizza pans.  Prebaked them for about 5-7 minutes before adding toppings, baked another 20 minutes, added cheese, baked for 5 more.  This is a keeper recipe!

I did not care for this recipe.  I followed the advice of the most popular review (olive oil, a little basil added) and also substituted some wheat flower for the regular, but I know that didn't make the negative difference in taste because I always substitute at least a little wheat flower for bleached and have never had an issue before.

This is a decent pizza crust recipe but nothing particularly special.  I had to use a lot more flour than it called for, probably a whole extra cup.  The crust was very chewy, and I'd suggest adding a few seasonings to the dough if you like it flavorful.  Also, if you don't like your dough extremely thick (like, focaccia bread-style thick), make sure to roll out the dough very thin before topping it.

My first successful pizza crust! Prebaking is crucial, (the first time I made this I didn't prebake and the cheese burned while the crust was still floury) but stick to prebaking it about 6 or so min, no more, or the crust will get a little too crispy. My family has made pizza crusts before but we always made it the wrong way, letting it rise too much, and using too much flour. I wanted a slightly thinner crust so I reduced the water to 1 and 1/4th cups and the flour to 3 cups(I didn't have to add any more flour while kneading either) and it was great. Not too thick. My family of four ate the whole pizza! It produced about 10 good size slices. Because of the prebaking, after adding the toppings, the pizza is done in about 5 min. Also make sure to let it rise a second time after stretching it out onto the pan( before the prebaking) a good 20-30 min.

My daughter asked for homemade pizza for her birthday dinner. I used this recipe for the crust. I added garlic and basil to the dough and used my breadmaker to mix the dough...about 20 min. I rolled out the crust, placed toppings on and immediately baked. Our guests couldn't stop raving about how good the pizza was. This is now my standard pizza crust recipe. Thanks for sharing!**** I made this crust again today. This time I prebaked the pizza crust for 10 minutes, added toppings and baked for another 10 minutes. My 8 year old son told me the pizza was the best he had ever eaten...especially the crust! I'm so excited to finally have found the perfect pizza crust!

I love this recipe.  I've made it quite a few times now.  I like to make half of it pizza crust and half breadsticks.  For the breadsticks I roll it out into a rectangle, lay a split in half mozzarella stick on the edge, roll the dough over to cover it, slice it off with a pizza roller, and roll it between my fingers so the cheese doesn't melt out.  Just keep doing that till there's no more dough.  Then I brush them with butter, sprinkle them with parmesan and bake till golden.  Holy moly.  Tonight we're just doing breadsticks and salad. YUM!  You for sure have to add seasonings to the recipe though.  I add italian seasonings, garlic powder and a little onion powder.

Made this a few times and it's always turned out great.  Last night I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of white.  It rose beautifully and tasted great.

This was my first time using yeast to make anything, and this recipe was really easy to follow. 

I used about half the dough for the pizza,since I was only cooking for 2, and made breadsticks using the rest of the dough (I sprinkled a bit of parmesan and garlic powder on them). I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

This pizza crust was good, although, not quite what I was looking for. My boyfriend thought it was really good though!!! I think I was just looking for more of a crispy texture on the outside. Maybe its because I dont have a pizza stone though?? I did like that it was really easy to make though!!

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for over six years and finally gave it a try.  Why did I wait so long!  I used this to make the "Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza" from All Recipes.  This recipe makes about four 12" pizza crusts, depending on how thick you like your crust.  I used the extra to make a loaf of bread and it turned out great.  I plan on using this to make stromboli's next and can't wait.  Thanks Jay!

Great recipe and easy, even had my 5yr old daughter make it. Made a double batch for the superbowl party, half I made into individual pizzas for the kids - parbaked them the night before and let the kids make their own pizzas.  Took the other half and made pizza breadsticks. I added fresh basil, thyme, oregano, and garlic to the the recipe just to give it more flavor.  The kids thought it was the best pizza they've had...didn't have any breadsticks leftover either.

I am always trying new recipes to try to find the best out there.  I tried this instead of using my usual recipe.  Unfortunately I was disappointed it just didn't stack up compared to my normal recipe.  It didn't have the flavor, or the consistency that I normally have with my pizza dough.  It was a ok dough but, nothing spectacular.  I will go back to my regular recipe.

Delicious. I split the dough in two before I roll it out and make two medium-sized crusts. I think using all of it for one crust would make a pizza that was way too doughy. The second time I made this I made the mistake of rolling the crusts too thin. Also, it's not a good idea to refrigerate an uncooked crust -- I did overnight because plans changed and I didn't have time to make the second pizza, and when I finally cooked it, it has like a cracker.

Best pizza crust we have made, but still not as good as a few I have tasted at pizza joints. We added parmesan cheese to the mixture and some italian seasoning. We used the cornmeal trick while baking and it does indeed help!

Awesome pizza crust recipe and super easy.  I substituted 1 cup of the white flour for multigrain flour and it gave an extra bit of flavour to the final pizza.  Definitely one to keep

This was really good.  My hubby loves a thick crust, so I decided to try to make one.  So easy....I doubled the recipe and it made 2 LARGE pizzas and quite a few bread sticks. I sprinkled corn meal on the pizza stone and the pizzas turned out perfectly.  I brushed the bread sticks with garlic butter, and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. YUM! I will follow previous reviewers' suggestions and add extra seasoning to the dough next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make pizza often but usually buy prepared crusts. Decided to give this a try and it was worth the effort. However 3 1/2 cups of flour wasn't enough. I added the whole 3 1/2 cups before kneading and it was still very sticky. I think I ended up using more like 4 to 4.5 cups. This makes enough dough for 2 large pizzas, unless you like your crust really, really thick. The dough rose very nicely but I don't think I let it relax long enough before attempting to spread it in the pan. I split the dough in half and struggled with the first piece. Had to wet it, add a tad more flour, and re-knead it a bit. It lost some elasticity so I just shaped it into a round crust and used a pizza stone. By the time I got to the second piece of dough about 10 minutes later it was very easy to spread into a rectangular crust. I let both crusts rise about 15 minutes, brushed them with a little olive oil and sprinkled with italian seasoning, then baked at 425 for about 8 minutes before adding the toppings. Once I added the toppings the pizzas took about 20 minutes more to bake. The crusts came out nice and light and slightly crunchy. Just the way I like them. Other reviewers mentioned using the same recipe for bread, calzones, breadsticks, etc. I think this recipe would be perfect for any of those. Can't wait to try them. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

Great crust recipe!  I like to roll mine out extremely thin and cook it on the pizza stone for 5 minutes, then I add the topping and put it back in the oven for about 15 minutes at the most.  It is nice and crispy that way.

I've used Jay's recipe for about 7 years now, and it's never let me down.  I can opt out of the rising stage and still have a good pizza.  However, making the time for the rising does produce a delicious crust!

The crust puffed up a bit on its first shot through the oven.  It made a nice crunchy pizza though, and I will not complain!  My personal modification is to brush pesto on the edge of the pizza, then when the dough is rolled up to make the crust, brush more pesto on the edges.  It's a scrumptious crust, far tastier than the stuffed or garlic varieties.

well, i made this today. It was very very good. I made the dough last night and let it rest all night. As someone else had suggested. I loved the way it had bubbled up. Great Recipe!!! I think the only change I will make next time is to roll it out on some corn meal.  THanks for the recipe!!

I really liked this recipe. I have tried a number of them from allrecipes, and this is one of the best. I think I will try to increase the temp a bit and play with the bake time - it was fluffy and soft, but I want it just a touch crispier on the outside, and I bake on a pizza stone already. One thing - I'm not sure it doubles well - I did this, and had to add quite a bit more flour. Next time I will try as stated and see if that makes a difference. I was trying to save time because I have a big family to cook for. :) Thanks very much for the recipe!

Was really disappointed given others ratings.  Ending have to add way more flour than stated, and the dough ended up chewy and took so long to cook.  If you do make this make sure to prebake the crust.  I won't make this again.

Thanks for the recipe, it is too good. very easy and quick. The only problem i had was to roll out the dough , is there any trick to roll it out neatly, everytime i roll it , it stretches and comes back smaller. i was not able to make it wider and thinner, mine was thick and small. i am new to pizza making.

Best pizza crust ever and easy to make too. I make this about every other week and it turns out perfect everytime. The last time I made it I let the dough rise to double, punched it down and then put it in an oiled bowl covered with Saran wrap in the fridge until I needed to use it. It will last a couple of days that way. It will rise again though so punch it down again and let it come to room temperature before rolling it out.

This is a wonderful pizza crust!  My whole family loves it; my 3 yr old, my 8 yr old, my 13 yr old, and my 48 yr old husband.  I love it because it is easy to make and so versatile.  We have homemade pizza about once a week, so I use it often.  

I brush the crusts lightly with butter, sprinkle with herbs, and bake them for about 5-8 minutes before I put the toppings on, and they come out just the right texture for my family.   This recipe has a permanent home in my recipe book!

YUM-O this dough was awesome! My husbands family is from Italy and he is always comparing our homemade to the ones they make back in Italy and the pizzeria pizzas. He loved the dough perfect he said a crispy crust and chewy center, just how I like it, not to thin not too thick, perfect! I made the dough in my bread maker next time I'll try using my pizza stone to bake it, we used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe on here my husband said it smelled like a pizzeria while cooking this is my new favorite dough recipe!

My family loves this recipe, I make it many times each month. I use this recipe just the way it is, though I do sprinkle corn meal on the bottom of the pan. 
I noticed many reviewers add extra flour to make it non-sticky. I don't because I don't roll it out, I just press it into the bottom of a pan and the stickiness makes that easier actually. Faster and easier, and it comes out perfect everytime, why work hard!?
I don't use a pizza stone, and I don't prebake the crust, I have never had issues with the crust being soggy or uncooked. I've noticed that soggy crust is often caused by putting meat or other toppings under the cheese instead of on top of it. Pizza hut can do that, but when I do it is a mess.
Overall, this is one of my favorite recipes! It makes awesome garlic bread too.

I see people talking about thick pan pizzas but I like thin base pizzas.  This recipe appears to do both as I get the most brilliant thin base pizzas from this recipe.  

My biggest problem is using the oven and adding fresh (in brine) mozzarella which makes the pizza a bit soggy.

I have never had a failure with this recipe and often make multiple batches at once and divide into single pizza balls and freeze.

Defrost in the micro at a very low defrost rate, roll out, add your toppings and bake......  brilliant every time

This gets 4 stars for the texture (perfect) but 3 for taste.  It really reminds me of the boxed Kraft pizza mix, which is a compliment I guess, as we don't mind that, but definitely not like take out/pizzeria style.  I made the dough in my bread machine, and the dough was so wonderful, pillowy soft and rolled like a dream.  I am a crust person and the crust had the perfect crunch.  Just missing something for taste in my opinion.

Love it & really easy!!  Next time will add a little garlic in the dough.  We did bake about 8 minutes before adding toppings.  I made one pizza & about 10 breadsticks with this.

This is a tender and chewy crust with a genuine yeast bread flavor.  The family loved it, in fact I have been asked to make it again tonight (second time in a week)  
I added oregano, paramesan cheese and garlic salt to the flour I sprinkled on my bread board when I rolled it out. This did add flavor.
I went light on the toppings and cheese, not knowing if the crust would get soggy with too many ingredients.  I will try it with a heavier mix of topping ingredients when I make it again.

I know this crust was good because the taste was.. but i forgot to prick the dough before baking it so the other end totally puffed up like a balloon.. oh and i would only bake it for 5 mins next time, then add the toppings then bake it for another 10 mins.. disappointed by my carelessness not at the recipe.

This is the best pizza crust recipe I have ever used. It is also so easy to make. When I make it I pretty much just mix everything up all at once and then knead the dough. This makes a wonderful pizza or even bread sticks. My guests always rave about my pizza crust, this is my little secret :)

I made this for my husband and me last nite and it was a hit!! I used bread flour instead of AP flour and added 1 Tbl. pizza seasoning and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the dough. I divided dough in half and rolled out each fairly thin (came out as thin and crispy, if you like a thicker crust, dont roll as thin) and placed on pans and pricked with for (like pie crust) before baking at 450 for 8 min. Put one crust in freezer(with no toppings) to use later. Brushed the other crust with garlic butter, put on toppings and finished baking at 425 till crust was browned and cheese was bubbly. My husband and I had to keep from eating the whole thing ;) No more bisquick crust or take out for us!! Not sure why some came out with more of a bread than crust, but I would guess that they didnt roll it out thin enough to begin with. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Not good in the breadmaker unless you babysit it and watch it to see when it needs more flour! But AMAZING if you follow the directions to exactly!

This was my first time making pizza dough and it was an absolute success! Make sure to roll the dough out really thin, because it rises like hella in the oven.  I had enough to make calzones a couple of days later.

YUMMMM! This was a really good pizza crust. This was my first time making a crust and I thought it was a little easy. I'm 15 so I had my mom help me roll out the dough because it was really sticky, so it got all on my hands and was kinda messy. But the end result was really good. The garlic powder and salt helped with the flavor alot. I will make this agin!

This recipe was great!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was worried because I used expired yeast.  Also, the dough was very sticky.  I didn't use much additional flour because I used the hook on my Kitchen Aid Mixer to form the dough.  I was glad that I did not have to handle the dough with my hands.  After the dough rose, it was still sticky and I couldn't form it into a ball.  I ended up spreading the dough on a large jelly roll pan greased with olive oil and covered with cornmeal.  I let it sit before I topped with bbq sauce, cheese, chicken, cilantro, and onions.  The bbq chicken pizza was perfect.  The dough was crispy and the crust was chewy, better than the premade dough from the supermarket.

I've been making pizza crust for years and this is the only one that has ever come close to tasting like the pizza I love from my home state of NJ.  I think the secret was in the method of preparation, since the ingredients are pretty much the same for all pizza crusts.  I love thick crust, but I really should have split this batch into two pizzas since I have a small pizza pan--the crust got HUGE and looked like it was going to take over.  Anyway, thank you for this recipe--it's awesome and so much better than the  pizza offered by the pizza chains in my area.

This recipe is a low-carb dieter's worst enemy!  No need for premade crusts, mixes, frozen pizzas, or even delivery anymore.  This is easy and so fantastic!  I added a few teaspoons of garlic powder with the salt and oil for a little added flavor.  As we like a thick, bready crust, I let it rise after putting in the pan for 15 minutes and it was fantastic.  A bit of cornmeal applied to the pan after oiling gave it even more of a restaurant texture and appearance.  Fantastic!

We really enjoyed this crust, but it is a little too much of a thin crust for my family. For a thicker crust that tastes great, I would try Pizza Crust I submitted by Kathi.  Its more of a Chicago style crust instead of New York.

Best homemade pizza crust I've tried yet.  Next time I'll definitely start with the full 3 1/2 cups of flour.    Then as I knead it, I'll add more.  It was very soupy with only 2 1/2 cups of flour.  Great Recipe!!

AWESOME,AWESOME,AWESOME!!!! Need I say more. This is the easiest recipe. I used my bread machine. My son who loves pizza, is picky about the crust. He gives this a 2 thumbs up:) Thanks for the recipe.

My pizza turned out o.k.  I need to work a bit on the toppings.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  It cooked nice all of the way through, not doughy in the middle.  Thanks Jay!!

I was scared that the crust was going to be doughy in the middle so I baked for an extra 8mins and had to remove it because the toppings were getting dark. I was pleasantly surprised that everything was done just right. I had a hard time working with the dough to press out into the pan, mine kept tearing. I've never made bread before so I figure it was something I did. Not enough flour or too much? I think next time I might had some garlic to the dough for flavoring. Turned out quite well.

I followed this recipe to the t, but I didn't use it for pizza, I used it for stromboli. So, of course I had to thin out the crust to flip over one side and I think it baked a little hard. Not sure if I would blame rolling it out thin or maybe using a little too much flour to work in the kneading. Overall pretty good.

I suppose it's not really fair to rate this since I changed it a bit...but I will anyway...I used all organic wholemeal flour for the first 2 1/2 cups, and regular flour for the kneading.  I also cooked the crust for 5 minutes before adding the toppings. I found the crust nice and soft but a bit heavy, maybe my warm water wasn't warm enough to activate the yeast enough, or maybe the wholemeal flour was the culprit.  Next time I will cook it for a bit longer than 15 minutes to try and get it crispy on the outside, but at that oven temp the cheese started to get hard and brown after 15 minutes.

I think I need some one-on-one help in making pizza from scratch!  I'm going to keep trying though, on this one, until I get it right.  The pizza stuck to my freshly-purchased pizza stone (I put cornmeal on it).  And it was doughy under the toppings, but not at the crust area.  Other than that, it was good.  I'll update my review after another try or two. Used it with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this website.

I made this crust for BBQ chicken pizza and it was wonderful.  For those of you who are ending up with soggy crust.. here's a tip.  Cook your pizza stone for about 40 minutes before placing the dough on stone and cook for the regular time.  (with the stone already hot you crust is cooked very evenly and it's done throughout.)  Also, I spread a mixture of oregano, basil and crushed garlic on the crust before topping, it gave it a bit more flavor.  This recipe is wonderful!  Try it with the "exquisite pizza sauce" on this site!

This has been a great recipe for me.  I have found that if I wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest until the next day it rolls out easily.

I have made this particular pizza crust 3x because of all the good ratings and reviews, unfortunately I was NOT pleased with the results. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so I  kept making this recipe until I got it right, and I am almost sure now that it is not me, it's the recipe. The crust is so bland, even with tasty toppings on it. I think it may need salt or possibly some garlic powder. In all honesty, the crust tasted like cardboard. But on a good note, it was easy to work with and flexible enough to make a thin crust pizza. Anyways, my husband and brother seemed to enjoy the pizza more than I did so I cannot give this a bad rating. But I will continue my search for a better pizza crust =)

I replaced 1 c. of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour, and put all the ingredients in the bread machine (I dissolved the yeast first).  The dough turned out REALLY sticky, so as I was working with it (I had to use spoons to knead b/c it just stuck to my hands!) I added probably another 1/2 to 3/4 c. of flour.  In the end it turned out yummy, and made two pizzas: one pizza-stone sized round pizza and one rectangular pizza the size of a standard cookie sheet.  I didn't have cornmeal, but it didn't stick to the stone or my silpat baking mat with flour underneath the dough.

This is by far the best pizza crust recipe.  It is the only one we use and have been doing so for over a year now.  Sometimes we bake the crust 10-15 minutes before adding the toppings to give it a head start.  Extra dough is great for breadsticks.

Excellent pizza crust. We use it in combination with Exquisite Pizza Sauce. Sometimes we make a double batch and the second batch we roll up into breadsticks, spray them with a bit of olive oil and sprinkle fresh parmasen cheese and romano cheese over them and bake.

We love this pizza crust!  I just put all the ingredients in my breadmaker and use the "dough" cycle.  Turns out perfect every time!  

Like others, we split the dough in half and make 2 pizzas.  

We never order pizza anymore! The kids prefer "Mom's Homemade Pizza" with this crust any day of the week.  That says a lot!

Have been searching for the perfect crust recipe...and thought we had already found it....until we found this one!  This is truly a pizzeria-style crust.  We like gourmet-style pizzas and feel that once the toppings are mastered, the crust will either make or break your pie.  Everyone we've made pizzas for thinks it phenomenal!

This is the first thing I've baked while living on my own.  Wasn't sure how big a giant pizza was, so I ended up having far too much crust on my pizza, but I reduced the recipe for my second attempt and it turned out very well.  Even though the pizza was half crust the first time, it was still wonderful.

Great!  Right now I'm living in Japan and it's hard to find really good pizza. Now I can make it myself. Works well for calzones and breadsticks too. I sprinkle a little garlic salt and herbs for extra flavor.

Very good recipe!  I had never thought of making my own pizza crust until I needed to!  I had always bought a mix at the store.  This blows it away!  I had made one huge pizza with this.  I was amazed by the texture.  It was crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  I had a few alterations on the recipe.  I had made the dough as shown, and then I sprinkled with garlic powder, parmesian cheese, and italian seasonings.  I then cooked it for 10 minutes, piled high with toppings, and then cooked for another 10 minutes.  This recipe went in the book!

This has become *the* pizza crust recipe at our home and I am making it approximately every other week.  A couple of points for you: This crust will be a 'thick crust' style crust.  If you like a thin, crunchy style crust, you will find that this is too 'bread-y' for you.  The recipe does make either one absolutely huge pizza or two med/large ones.  I have found that I really do need to prebake in order for the crust to be fully cooked.
I make this recipe in my bread machine dumping in all the ingredients and all the flour and allowing the machine to mix, knead and allow it to rise.  I then remove it from the bread machine pan, and roll out, adding about a cup more flour in the rolling.  You will probably need more flour than called for as other rieveiwers have suggested - this is a very 'wet' dough.
One more tip, I often roll this out directly on Reynolds Release aluminum foil so that I have no problems with it sticking.

This is the only recipe I use now. I use it for regular pizza, mini pizza (My four kids love to make own pizzas, makes 6 individual pizza crusts) and I use the recipe for bread sticks. Today I am going to make stuffed breadsticks, wrapping the dough around a string cheese stick. I think my kids will like this surprize! I think I could even wrap some of the cheese with peperoni first. And then heat some pizza sauce to dip them in.

I loved the way it was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside!  I do think it could use a little more flavor though.  Next time I will add some dried herbs and some Parmesan cheese to it.  It was also really easy to make since I just threw it all in the bread machine.  I halved the recipe and it made a crust that was big enough to cover a large baking stone.

This crust is amazing!  I just didn't believe that it would be as good as everyone is saying, but is exactly like a pizzeria pizza!

I doubled the mixture, then made 16 individual portion pizzas I topped them with cheese, ham, pepper, pineapple, onion and a tangy base sauce of ketchup, tomato paste and spicy tomato relish.  Boy!  These were excellent, and so economical - ended up costing me about 30 cents a pizza.   I laid them on cookie sheets and froze, then place in layers in an airtight storage container.

You can trust all the reviews. This one comes out like pizzeria crust. You will not be disappointed. It's so much more economical to make your own pizza. I always keep a jar of spaghetti sauce (be sure not to put a lot of sauce on. you should be able to see the underlying crust.) in the cupboard along with a bag of shredded pizza cheeses in the freezer.This way I can whip up my own pizza anytime. Or, sometimes we like the crust with only cheese, fresh basil and sliced tomatoes. Wonderful. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Wow!  The best pizza crust.  I used my bread maker for the kneading and rising.  I made one pizza the first day and refrigerated the remaining dough in an oiled plastic bag with plenty of room for expansion.  The next day, I made 4 individual calzones with the remaining dough.  SIMPLY FANTASTIC.

I have made this recipe time and time again and it always comes out great! I suggest putting foil around the edges to avoid burning because it does take a bit longer to bake than specified. Wonderful recipe!!!

I love this dough, it being the first I make.  Since I don't have any kids of my own, I made it for my sister-in-laws kids and they loved the pizza, especially the crispy crust.

Pretty good! My boyfriend liked it very much. Crust was simple to make, although VERY sticky until lots of flour added. Came out kind of chewy, not crispy at all for me. However, I baked on a cheapo store-bought aluminum pan, so a different pan or pizza stone might make all the difference!  Will definitely make again.

I multiplied this by six and served A LOT of hungry people.  Everyone loved it.  It turns out best if using a real pizza pan with ventalation holes instead of a cookie sheet.  I've done both and hands down the pizza pan pizza wins.

With all the great reviews, I thought I was in for a treat. I had no problem with it rising. It looked perfect. I divided it into 2 pizzas. One thicker and one thinner. The thinner definitly had a much more appealing texture, but my husband and I both thought it was missing something. I used the exquisite sauce and that was great. But the crust was sadly lacking. Just way to bland. I think I will keep looking for the perfect crust.

This was my first try at pizza crust and it came out pretty good! I would agree with former comments--the texture was good and this was very easy (pretty much foolproof) but the flavor was somewhat bland. The crust was also a little thick for me--next time I'll make 2 crusts from this recipe.  So, not 5 star but good and worth working with to make it perfect.

I made this for a Chicken Pesto Pizza that I also found the receipe on here. This was my first time making anything like this so I need to get used to and better at it. It came out tasting wonderful. The inside was soft and the outside was a little crunchy. It wasn't as pretty as I hoped it would be, but practice makes perfect. I do think it needs a bit of seasoning though, garlic or parmesan maybe. I'm going to try adding things next time I make this.

This recipe was awesome!  This is the first time I've ever made my own bread/dough of any kind, but it turned out perfect.  I would recommend spicing it up a bit, however.  I added garlic and onion powder, but it could have used more.  I did sprinkle some garlic seasoning, parmesan, and corn meal on the pan before placing the dough on it,however, so I did get a hint of something extra with each bite.  A great dough for experimenting!

The texture of this crust was great - chewy but firm. It's not a 5-star recipe, though, because the taste is a bit bland. Also, you need WAY more flour than called for to get the dough anywhere near workable. Not a bad recipe overall, though, and I probably will make it again.

Made this for lunch yesterday and it turned out very well.  I did bake the crust for about 10 minutes before I added my toppings.  In my experience, it really just turns out 10X better that way.  Then you can layer everything on it without the crust getting soggy from the pizza sauce.  Thanks for the post...delicious.

Being Italian, I have been eating Pizza my whole life. This is one of the BEST recipes for crust I have found, including my grandfathers! My picky husband raved about it also. Just tweaking for taste, I used bread flour with a little higher gluten content and added herbs/cheese to the flour mix, I am not sure if the HG flour made a difference and next time I will use AP with a small amount of whole wheat or rye flour since I like a bit chewier crust. I only needed a small amount of extra flour since I felt this dough is supposed to be on the soft side. It rolled out great and made one huge Pizza. All in all an excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing Jay!

Perfect pizza crust!  Recipe is enough for my huge pizza round plus a side of cheesy breadsticks (roll out thin, fill with shredded cheese, fold over, brush with butter and sprinkle with parm and garlic powder ect). BE sure not to overbake!  Thanks so much for the recipe, Jason!

This makes a great pizza crust! As everyone else said, though, it yields a *lot* of dough.

The first time I made it, I rolled it out into only 1 crust. To make sure it would be done in the middle before the toppings burned, I prebaked the crust for 15 mins. on 350 degrees. It worked fine that way, but the crust was WAY thick! 

On the second try, I rolled it out into 2 crusts and prebaked them for 5 minutes, then added sauce and cheese. One pizza turned out great, BUT - as a previous reviewer said - the one on the Air-Bake pan was awful. It did not get done on the bottom and turned into a soggy mess that we ended up tossing. If you make this pizza, go with a traditional pan!

It's better than delivery! It's better than Digorno! Thanks for the recipe... It really is great. I split the dough in 1/2 and froze the other 1/2.* The crust baked perfectly and came out tastie and crispy. I reccomend using corn meal on the pizza stone-- it adds a great texture to the bottom of the crust.
*Just take the frozen dough out of the freezer and after it thaws, it's ready!

I doubled the recipe for our crowd, and it was the perfect amount for two (11x16) cookie pans.  (What left-overs we did have re-heated perfectly the next day).  Yes, I will use this crust again. Very easy!

This is the best crust. I have been searching for a good one, and this is it! This makes a lot of dough, three medium pizzas! Since my boyfriend and I have different tastes when it comes to crust consistency (he likes thin & crispy, I like thick & soft), he just baked his a little longer and got the exact crunch he wanted, while I baked mine until it was just golden. I put the left over dough in the freezer and can't wait to use it!

EXCELLENT!  The best ive tried!  I would split this in half and make two pizzas...if not i would turn the oven down a little for a larger pizza.  I had NO problem with this crust getting down...i did increase the sugar to 1 tsp and added parmesan and pizza and italian seasonings to the flour before putting it in the yeast mixture...ill definitley make this again.

Good taste, fairly easy to make, makes one HUGE crust.  Big enough for a giant Chicago deep dish pizza. Yum!

We have been using this crust recipe for the last few years. It is very versatile. Sometimes I add herbs or cheese and sometimes I brush the crust with olive oil. I always use 1 cup of whole wheat flour(the rest is white flour), decrease the water by 1/4 cup and let the bread machine do all of the work. We like crispy crust so I usually prebake the crust. I've also used the dough to make breadsticks with olive oil and spices. Even with all of the variations we have tried, it always turns out great.

I've made this three or four times now, and it has the best texture of any pizza crust I've made. The first time, it came out a little bland for me, so I started adding canned minced garlic, basil, and a little grated parmesan cheese when it's time to mix in the olive oil and salt.

I found what really helps the flavor, though, is letting the dough ball set in the fridge for a day or two before using it. 

Overall, this recipe is great and I will definitely continue making it in the future.

Excellent crust.  Enough for two pizzas.  I used white sugar instead of brown and added a little crushed dried rosemary with the oil and salt.  I would start out adding more than 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Maybe 3 and then work the rest in as you knead it.

This was a good crust....the dough was quite sticky and needed more flour (even when pressing into pizza pan).  It is an easy dough to work with (stretches nice) and has a nice "light" feel to it.

I have been searching high and low for a good pizza crust recipe. This is hands down the Best! The dough is silky smooth and easy to work with. Crispy on the outside and soft in the centre. It also rises just the right amount. Thank you Jay for the wonderful recipe!

What a great recipe! I had never made pizza dough before but now this is the only way I will ever eat pizza again! No more frozen or delivery! I could have cooked it a little longer but I loved it! The only problem I had was when I put the dough out on a floured surface. It stuck and I had to use a lot of flour to make it not sticky. But it wasn't that bad. I'll definitely make this again next friday night!

Wonderful pizza dough. Had to add more flour than called for in the recipe to make a soft dough. Was raining that day...maybe that was the reason. Will do again.

Great!  This made two big pizzas of good-sized thickness.  I added a tablespoon of garlic powder to add a little taste.  If I wanted to, I could have definitely made three pizzas out of it.  From now on, whenever I have the time, I'll use this pizza crust recipe.

This is a GREAT pizza crust!  Like others have said, just the right amount of crispiness.  The recipe makes two pizza crusts for me.  Also, I add 1-2 T. of tomato sauce and 1/2 t. of garlic powder with the salt and oil for a little extra flavor.  Lots of room for experimenting there, with different herbs, etc.  YUM! Thank you Jay!

I like it.  It comes out every time.  It does make a lot of dough though.  I usually make one large pizza and a smaller thin crust one.  I use my stand mixer to mix and knead it and it works great.

This is by far the best pizza crust I've ever made, although it was a bit thick for me.  I only had a 14-inch pizza stone, so maybe that's why.  It makes a *really* big crust, so be prepared.  It looks beautiful, and I got lots of compliments.  It is a bit bland, but shouldn't be too hard to spice up.  Now to find the perfect sauce...

I really am glad I tried this recipe. I had been using the same one for many years and this one is better. It is not soggy when baked on a baking stone and it makes a generous size crust.  The dough is very easy to work with.  I have tried making this adding 1 t. Pampered Chef Italian Seasoning to the dough and also by changing the oil to 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 vegetable oil.  You will not be sorry you tried this...enjoy!

FREAKIN awesome... tastes just as good or better than most pizza places. WAYYYYY better than dominoes, pizza hut or any fast chain. I recommend getting fresh mozarella and shredding it yourself... the pre-shredded store bought cheese seems to turn to rubber after about 10 minutes. Jay you da man!!

Beware...this DOES make a really big crust.  I like a thick crust but it was too much for a cookie sheet sized pizza.  The taste is fabulous...I added 1 tsp. each of garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  Next time I will divide the dough and freeze half.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

GREAT crust. This is definitely one of the better home made pizza crusts I've used. Put some cornmeal on the bottom of the pan before you lay down the pizza crust.

This dough makes a very tasty pizza. I like a really thick crust so I used it all to make one pizza on my stone. It's worth the wait! Note: When ever I make my own pizza, I always pop the crust and sauce in for 5 min and then add the cheese-otherwise I end up with very dark cheese and somewhat undercooked crust.

WOW! I usually make pizza dough in my bread machine and it turns out good. But we just moved and my bread machine is in storage. So I decided to make my own from scratch. I'm VERY PLEASED with the results of this recipe. I only made a small alteration to make it a little healthier (used some whole wheat pastry flour) and added some basil and oregano to the dough for Italian flavor! This is SOOOOOO good---I will never use my bread machine to make pizza dough again!Thanks Jay....I'll be using this again & again & again......

My husband and I are always arguing about pizza crusts.....He likes thick crust, I think they are too doughy. This recipe changed my mind! I loved how fluffy and yummy this crust was! I did add a little more flour than it said to get it to pull together in my stand mixer, but that was easy enough. This was delicious and we will definitely make this our regular pizza crust recipe!

Awesome.  Very easy to make and it only takes an hour to rise.  Other doughs take 2 or more hours.  I can now stop looking for the perfect pizza crust recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I only had Red Star Quick Rise yeast on hand so that's what I used.  I mixed it all up and kneaded for 10 minutes.  I then proceeded to put it in a bowl, covered with an unsealed sheet of plastic wrap, and into fridge for a few hours due to a crazy schedule change.  I got back and it had risen nicely.  I preheated my oven with a pizza stone on the bottom rack at the temperature the recipe said.  I don't have a pizza peel so what I did was I took a sheet of parchment paper, rubbed some olive oil on it, and proceeded to make a pretty thin pizza on it.  I slid the pizza and parchment paper right on to the pizza stone and kept it in until crust had a nice color to it (between 10 and 15 minutes) .  The cheese didn't get burnt and it tasted fantastic.  One of the best pizza crust recipes I've tried from this website.

The best pizza dough I ever made. This one does not flatten out. And I dont need to use a pizza stone. It browns and crisps up just perfectly.

Awesome recipe! I added about 1 tbsp olive oil, heaping measurements of salt and sugar called for, and added heaping 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasonings to the dough and pre-baked on 350 for 10 minutes. This will be the only recipe for crust in our home:) thank you for an awesome recipe!

Great recipe!! The only change was adding garlic powder to the crust as it mixed to increase flavor.  I precooked the crust for 8 min.  Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside - just right. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is our go to pizza dough recipe.  I add a tsp of Italian seasoning to the yeast mixture before adding the flour and it gives a great flavor.  We use a 14" pizza stone.  The dough is thick and soft and my 3 kids love it!  I have divided the dough into parts and made individual pizzas for the kids.  It also freezes well, so I usually make a few at a time and keep some on hand.

This was my first attempt at making homemade pizza crust. Great, easy recipe! Some things I altered: I used 1 tablespoon each of regular olive oil and basil infused olive oil, a dash or so of onion powder, and around a tablespoon of a pizza seasoning blend that contains oregano, basil, marjoram, and garlic. The crust it makes is very thick! This recipe could easily make 2 smaller thin crust pizzas.  It also wouldn’t hurt to pre-bake the crust for a couple minutes prior to adding toppings. The middle was still fully cooked without doing a pre-bake, but it didn’t get as crispy as I would have liked. I made one on a stone, and one on a metal pizza pan... I didn’t notice a significant difference between the two methods. Overall, FANTASTIC recipe that will definitely get used again and again!

I have been playing with this recipe for two or three years and I think I finally have it the way I like it.  For me, the key is to use bread flour instead of All Purpose.  I also find that pizza dough is better when it is made several hours or days before you bake it.  Today, I made the dough in the later morning.  I let it rise on the counter until doubled.  Then I punched it down and put it in the fridge.  I punched it down once more in the fridge before taking it out for baking.  I let it sit out for at least 20 minutes before shaping it in the pan.  Then, I let it rise in the pan another 20 minutes or so.  And - I bake it at 475 - in an oven that has been preheating at least 45 minutes. I've tried baking with a stone and without a stone.  I find that my cheap, thin, tin round pan works the best.

After trying tons of crust recipes, I finally found the perfect pizza crust. I follow the recipe but I do add in 3x the amount of brown sugar. I will sometimes add in crushed garlic or italian seasoning. It will make 2 14" thick crusts. I bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes, but that is just my oven. Make sure you brush the crust with butter before adding the toppings

Update: I have now been making this weekly for Survivor pizza night. It is still a great dough week after week!

This is now my go-to pizza crust!  I had a "friendly" competition with my cousin (a chef at an Italian restaurant) over who makes the best home made pizzas.  Let's just say it was close to a very embarrassing moment for him!  The first few times I made this I was worried about the timing, but if you top the pizzas you can leave them out for an hour or so with no damage before popping them in the oven (the weight of the toppings seems to "hold" the crust down so they don't over proof and the crust rises up a bit around it to make a good food handle!).  Also, I find sliding them off the pans for the last 5 minutes of cooking time helps crisp the bottom, then I put them on wire racks to avoid soggy bottoms!  Awesome!

It is the best recipe for making a thick crust pizza should you prefer that style. I don't need to try any other. It is so simple and so easy. The olive oil makes the difference.

This pizza crust recipe is delicious and very easy! I added some italian seasoning and garlic powder to my dough to give it some flavor. This recipe is definitely enough to make two good sized pizza's. I used regular pizza pans and pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes before putting the toppings on. I then baked it with the toppings for 15 minutes and it came out perfectly golden brown.

I took the suggestions of others and added garlic powder, oregano, basil for seasoning in dough. I also pre cooked dough on pizza stone for 7 min prior to adding toppings. It was great.

Thank you Jay. This is the way I'll make pizza from now on, I hope. Making the dough is key because it tastes so much better and the texture is good. I kind of hurried it up but still, so much better and less expensive than store bought dough or delivery.

The pizza dough came out great. However, I just don't think it's worth the amount of time and effort needed to create the perfect dough. It tasted just like any pizza dough I get from a bakery or grocery store.

OMG have not made this in forever. It rose for about 3 hours, baked it before for about 10 min then used mushrooms, yellow peppers and onions and OMG I ate the whole thing, well with the help of my dog Taylor... Wonderful tender in the middle and crunchy on the outside. I loved this sooo much!!! Thanks!!

This is a great recipe. As some reviewers suggested, I only make 2/3 of the amount specified in the recipe and add onion and garlic powder. This one is definitely a keeper.

So good! I don't have a baking stone, so I pre baked my crust for 7 min, added toppings, then baked it for an additional 15 min. Turned out exactly how I wanted it to - crunchy but not hard. Next time I'm going to brush it with butter to give it more flavor.

Excellent crust!  Nice pizzeria texture when cooked on a pizza stone.  I use part all purpose flour and part bread flour.   I make the dough in the bread machine and store it in the refrigerator for a day or two (or 5) before bringing to room temperature and making the pizza.

I have made this recipe several times.  Just getting around to writing my review.  I did use my bread machine on the dough setting.  I did bake the pizza on a pizza stone.  The crust was crunchy on the bottom and chewy inside.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Jason Sharp.

I was nervous trying this recipe after I read through its bad reviews - and while I still don't know what went wrong for them, I am delighted by how this turned out for me! I was surprised I didn't need to add more than a half cup extra flour. Since a lot of the complaints were about hard dough, I left it slightly sticky and kneaded it only a bit. I added garlic powder, italian seasoning, and a bit of onion salt. I also pre-baked it for about ten minutes on a cookie sheet that was coated with some corn meal. The result? Exactly as advertised - crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, just thick enough, and flavorful (though probably because of the spices). Definitely a keeper!

A SOLID recipe but after making it 4-5 times, I've finally mastered it (with the following tweaks).

1.) use a full tablespoon of salt
2.) add an extra tablespoon of olive oil
3.) brush it with olive oil, once on the stone (or in the pan)
4.) par-cook the dough for up to 10 minutes

A+!!

An amazing recipe! Nice soft, light dough that crisps nicely on the outside. It was thick enough that the slices didn't sag upon picking them up, like many recipes.

This is the BEST pizza crust I have EVER made by far! It is absolutely perfect. As other reviewers said, it does remind me of Pizza Hut crust a little but way less greasy. I had to use regular sugar because I didn't have brown sugar on hand and it still turned out wonderful. My plan is to make the dough ahead of time, roll it out and then freeze it for future use. It truly was fantastic though, and my family loved it too!

So fabulous! Light and airy. It was like kneading a cloud. This is my crust from now on. My family loved it. I have used this recipe twice now and will always use it. Quite easy for me. I doubled it as we have a large family and made two tray sized pizzas. Would not change a thi. The only thing I did different is: I covered it with a warm, damp  towel to let it rise as I do when I make bread.

Perfect as advertised except for one small tweak. I use a pizza pan and pre-bake the crust for 12-13 minutes before adding the topping for a nice crispy crust.

Great pizza crust, easy recipe. We used it 2-3 times a week. Usually replace salt with garlic salt and add garlic power and Italian seasonings. Hubby cooks his on a metal pan. He likes his chewier. I cook mine on a stone pan for a crispier crust. Usually only do 10 min rise time

This pizza dough is perfect as written.  I divide into three portions and cook in a well oiled 9" round cake pan. I precook it for about 8 minutes, then add toppings, and continue cooking until cheese is bubbly.  I now refuse to buy pizza dough at the store.  I keep this in the freezer at all times.  I'm sure it is best to defrost for several hours, but I never remember to take it out in time.  Place in an oiled zip top bag, squeeze out the air, and seal well.  Then put the bag in a bowl of warm water (110ish-degrees).  Change the water after about 10 minutes.  It should be defrosted and ready to shape in 20-30 minutes.

This never lets me down!  I have added herbs on some occasions. This also holds up well bagged in the fridge if you make it a day ahead of time.  Always get compliments on the texture, taste, and ability to hold a mountain of toppings. Works awesome with my pizza stone.

Never fails. Very easy to make. It is the best homemade crust i have ever made. Sometimes I double up the recipe and freeze one ball of dough right after kneading. I put it in a large oiled freezer bag, pressing out the air before closing. Voila! Frozen pizza dough ready to defrost and rise on the counter (still in the bag) the next time pizza is on the menu.  My kids actually tell me that it's as good or better than some of the pizza chain stores.  Another tip is to make mini pizzas and put them in the freezer wrapped in foil. Reheat in the oven for only a few minutes. I also pack the mini pizzas for the kids' school lunches.

This is the best pizza crust we had ever had in our lives. I also used this recipe for making whole wheat pizza crust, let it rise for 1hr, punch down, let it rise for another 45mins, punch down again then put the toppings. I always have left over dough which i just roll into crescent rolls. This recipe gave me the best feedback I have ever had: "You are the best mommy in the world" so thank you very much "Jay".

I used a bread machine - it definitely needed a little more flour (at least 3 2/3 cups, maybe a full 4 cups).  It was super sticky & hard to get out of the machine.  I also used my regular pizza stone - which is not an extra large size so the crust was super thick & needed probably a good 10 min in the oven before putting the toppings on (it was still slightly raw when we ate it).  I brushed the crust with some garlic butter & that made it crisp up nicely on the outside.  I would definitely use this recipe again if I want a thick crust (my husband actually liked it a lot & he's more of a thin crust guy).

I really liked this recipe. My daughter likes a thicker crust and this was perfect. I followed recipe as written, but do to some negative reviews about the bland taste I added a half packet of Good Seasons ?dry Italian seasoning and some parsley for color. Since I modified the recipe I will not give it 5 stars. But with the modifications It would be 5 stars.

This really is a great crust.  I have experimented by adding honey instead of brown sugar.  Additionally, it works well with whole wheat flour, some corn meal, and a bit of semolina flour-- it will work on the texture. Therefore, you can work with whoever will be enjoying the pizza.

I am a very experienced bread, roll, crust baker. This was excellent! I used my kitchen aide mixer and did add a little more flour than called for to get the right texture. I used olive oil to grease my bowl, and that does impart more flavor than sprays, and I prefer whole and healthy to convenient and processed. Mt pizza topping began with a pesto base,, also homemade, which added more delicious flavor to the crust. From experience, I sprinkled cornmeal onto my jellyroll baking sheet before pressing the dough into the pan. 18 minutes in the oven resulted in a crispy crust throughout the pizza, with ideal chewiness. Perhaps the differences are a result of smaller pans, or varying ovens. I baked this with my convection bake setting.  This will return to my table frequently!

This was very good.  I did add Italian Seasoning and garlic powder but, followed everything else.  This is a keeper and will have to question myself if I ever grab a frozen pizza again.

I love this recipe!  I typically divide the dough to make 4 smaller pizzas so everyone can have exactly the toppings they like.  And I will double the recipe and freeze half.  That way I am able to just defrost and let rise for pizza the next time I want to make it.

I think all the good reviews are for it being crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside, but this recipe produces a very bland and tasteless crust.  I added some garlic powder and pizza herbs/seasoning because that's what I usually do when I make pizza dough. I used this recipe earlier today because I couldn't find where I put my recipe book for the pizza dough recipe I usually use. I found it after the pizza was out of the oven! It's the same as this recipe except that it requires 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar, and 3.5 cups bread flour which makes the crust tasty. Bad choice - I should have just looked for my book and made that in the first place.

The flour instructions confused me, as I changed the serving size to 8 but the 2 1/2 cup amount didn't change. I wasn't sure if this meant two half-cups or two and a half cups, so I added almost all of the flour and assumed the rest was for seasoning the kneading surface. Well, to clear things up, you're going to need a LOT more flour than it calls for. I ended up using around 3-4 cups of flour in total. I would recommend adding most before kneading as it becomes a mess otherwise. I also cooked this in a skillet, so I increased the cooking time by 5 minutes. Aside from the flour confusion, the pizza tasted as good as any I have bought, and much better than cook-from-frozen store pizzas. Thanks Jay!!

I found this recipe a year ago via a google search and been using it every week for pizza night. Important to use fresh yeast, make sure water temp is 110F and knead the dough. Turns out fantastic every time. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this pizza dough. It surpasses any pizza dough I have made. It is easy to whip up in my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I knead for 4 minutes. I used a pizza stone which results in a wonderful crust.

This recipie is amazing! I have tried many pizza dough recipies, and this is by far the best one. Very similar to what you would get at a local pizzeria. 

I did have to adjust the cooking directions to make it cripser, I preheat a pizza stone in a 500 degree oven, prebake the crust for two minutes, top the pizza, and bake it for an additional 7-9 minutes. This make the pizza come out perfect!

I have been making this for awhile and really like the results. Today I used 2 cups of bread flour and 1 1/3 cups all purpose flour and I liked the results even better. For a great crisp on the bottom i slide the pizza off the stone onto the bottom oven rack for 1-2 minutes at the end!

I've spent the past 3 years trying to improve upon this recipe. I've substituted varying quantities of wheat flour, or added certain Italian seasonings, or decreased the recipe for a thinner crust. And after all those experiments, I've figured something out: THIS IS PERFECT JUST THE WAY IT IS! Seriously. I wish the wheat flour had turned out because I do like staying on top of that health trend, and it's okay, but it makes for a tougher, chewier crust. As for the spice blends I've tried, they're okay, but it takes a lot to flavor the dough, and there is an easier way to have a flavorful pizza -- use quality toppings. I'm a supreme pizza girl in a supreme pizza household (well, the kids are a work in progress, but we'll get them there), and this crust supports the blend of meats and vegetables. (Not as good for a one-topping pizza, but then, I don't like one-topping pizzas.) 

Just one thing, and I cannot stress this enough, ***USE A PIZZA STONE*** You cannot make good pizza on anything else. You must use a pizza stone that you preheated in the oven so it's nice and hot. This cooks the crust from the top and the bottom, and keeps it from getting doughy.

This has been my "go to" pizza crust ever since I found it on this recipe website and it always gets GLORIOUS reviews by friends and family!  As long as you have fresh yeast, this recipe will NEVER FAIL YOU.  Crunchy on the oustide and chewy on the inside YES!  First time I made it, seemed strange that just after mixing it, the dough actually "poured" out of the mixing bowl and onto my floured surface - but don't worry, after it rises and you press out on a pizza stone it will be GREAT!  Pizza will be very thick, so consider dividing in half for hand tossed thickness like at pizza parlors - otherwise BEST PIZZA DOGH EVER!

Absolutely fab!  I've made this crust several times now and it always comes out perfectly done.  Have used it in a Pampered Chef deep dish pizza pan, not that I admit to owning one of those.  But beats any pie you can order out.  This spring I am building an outdoor oven and this will be the crust I use.

soo good, i add a bit of mixed herbs to the dough though. if you cant knead, punch the dough with your hands then fold it then punch again and fold, while adding flour. it works well for me although i dont know if thats a correct technique lol

My family has enjoyed this dough time and time again. Recipe is good for either thick or thin pizzas. Just roll it or stretch it out to your liking. We have also used this recipe to make calzones and panzos and it works just right... same oven temp, but I usually add around 10 minutes to the time, give or take. The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of flavor. I've added garlic powder, onion powder, fresh garlic, rosemary, or combinations of the above. With none of these things added, it is a little bland. As long as you season the dough, it's great. This is our go to recipe!

DELICIOUS! It's a great, easy recipe to work with. And, with some changes, it's literally the best pizza I've had. I put a bunch of spices in the dough (fresh garlic, oregano, black pepper, hot pepper flakes). And for extra goodness, I put a mozzarella cheese stick in the crust to make a cheese crust. Heavenly!

The best crust recipe I have tried to date. I did add one teaspoon of regular sugar to the yeast mixture also.
My husband RAVED it was the best pizza he has ever had and declares he won't be getting delivery or take-out if he has the option of me doing this again.

I used this recipe for deep fried dough sticks. You know how you get the garlic bread from restaurant? These had a nice crust on the outside and fluffy insides. When you are told that your breadsticks are better than Domino's or Pizza Hut you need to give the credit where it is due. I could not have had the success I did without Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe. Years back I loved these deep fried dough balls with cheese and marinara for dipping. I was about to go on the road back to that taste. I thought it would have been a long journey to go back 20 years. Not so. This was the first pizza dough recipe I tried in our deep fryer. I was a bit worried how the deep frying cooking process would alter the final product.I drizzled them with garlic salt and margarine as soon as they came out of the fryer. Now that I know this works I will be using real ingredients like garlic and butter. Wasn't expecting success the first time. Jay has done a wonderful thing. I plan on making little Calzones next time. This a great recipe for beginners. I am by no stretch of the imagination new to baking but the personal investment and technical skills necessary are minimal. The dough proofed in less than an hour(about 40 minutes) AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.  They say that perfection is a journey and not a destination but if you are looking for the perfect dough-ball recipe this is the recipe for you. 

Thank you Jay!

This recipe is perfect as is. I ended up with two medium sized pizzas. I brushed the bottoms of the crusts with olive oil and sprinkled with corn meal before the final rising. Cooked them in disposable aluminum foil pans and they still turned out incredible. I also brushed the crust with olive oil before cooking and baked on the lowest rung my oven rack could go. Crust turned out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside as promised.  I made mine with fresh basil, capacollo and pineapple. It was to die for.

This may be my first review on this site, although I've found many GREAT recipes here!  I saw that this was the recipe of the day & had to review it.  I have been using this pizza crust for several years now and it has never failed me! It is so versatile.. I use it mainly as pizza crust, of course; but I also add herbs to it and make it into a rustic bread to compliment a stew, I use it to make bread sticks.. for me, the possibilities are endless!  Absolutely no changes made. This is a GREAT pizza crust.

This was a wonderful pizza crust. I made it in the bread machine, turned it out onto a large cutting board, then line a 10 inch (sort of small) cast iron skillet with it, trimming it around the outside edge to make a deep dish crust. I then baked it for 10 minutes at 400 degrees before assembling the pizza. After assembly, I baked it at 325 degrees (convection mode) for about 20 minutes. The crust was very full and great tasting. About three minutes before taking it out I brushed the outer layer of crust with olive oil and seasonings. It was a hit! I will use this crust in the future.

I did not roll the dough out very thin, as I wanted thick crust deep dish. It rises a lot, more than I expected. But, where I live in China, pizza is unheard of, much less the kind I made using this crust! Many thanks to Jay!!!

This pizza crust recipe is exactly like mine without the added sugar. I don't know why it's needed. In any case it is a perfect crust. I prepare this in my bread baker and it's always ready perfect. After I place the sauce and whatever else I want to put onto the crust, I drizzle olive oil along the edge of the crust. Gives the dough/crust a wonderful crusty flavor.

I agree with the reviewers who 1) compared this crust to Pizza Hut's pan pizza; and 2) recommended pre-baking the crust a bit before adding toppings. I decided not to pre-bake, and I wish I had. I also noticed that, as I added the flour while kneading, my dough never become "not sticky," so eventually I just decided to work with what I had (which was decidedly sticky). It still came out great - I usually prefer a thin crust, but if I'm ever craving a thicker crust, this'll be my go-to recipe.

made a sausage pizza for lunch with this crust recipe. turned out beautifully - let dough rise about 10 min after rolled out - crust was a little doughy (but done) after a 22 minute bake, just how we like it!

The best pizza crust recipe I've found yet!  I've passed this on to many people.  I also prepared this in my breadmaker on the dough setting.  Great, definitely a keeper, I have used this recipe more times than I can count!   ...great bread sticks too!

This is a great recipe.  Very nice crust.  Instead of making one large pizza, I rolled out smaller personal sized pieces and let my kids put their own toppings on.  They absolutely loved the taste of the pizza and had fun making their own.  My oldest, who is sooooo picky devoured his entire pizza and told me I should make this recipe again.  Thanks for another great one!

I even doubled the recipe and it worked out great!

I gave this 5 stars, but I made pizza rolls out of it.  We've recently moved to the UK and have had a hard time finding good pizza, and our hometown makes amazing pizza rolls.  I rolled out the dough, put in fillings and fried them up.  There's a reason we call them "fat bags", but so so so good if you want to be so so so bad.

This recipe is awesome. I made a couple of modifications to it, as I do with almost every recipe, and I made this on my round cast iron flat griddle in the oven, and it was my first success with pizza crust! No need to order a pizza ever again!

Easy to make but I must agree with some of the others that something is missing with the flavor of this crust. The texture is good but it needs more flavor so gave it 4 stars. 

I'll experiment by adding other ingredients to bump up the flavor.

This crust should be a 5 star!  What a great texture, perfectly tender inside with a slight crisp outside.  I added Parmesan and garlic to the dough and it complimented it nicely.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm a picky Italian so I found this to be an okay pizza crust made as the recipe instructs. It reminded me more of the store bought pizzas like Ellios etc. Definitely missing something in the crust flavor. I ended up dividing the dough and making one medium pizza and one batch of cinnamon rolls. One pizza and cinnamon rolls for dessert, can't complain about that.

pretty good, basic crust. Be sure to cook the crust by itself for about 10 minutes before adding the toppings.

This was not to my liking. Instructions were useless unless you read the hundreds of reviews. And the time, is it 15 or 20 minutes. I cooked mine for 15 minutes and it was hard as a rock, what a waste of time.

made this one twice.  very easy crust, and looks gorgeous, too! i didn't have time to let it rise a full hour, so i preheated the oven to 170, turned it off, and let the dough rise in there for 30 minutes instead.  i've made it before by adding onion powder to it and that was really delicious as well.

Freaking great! Soft and crispy! I added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder and this crust was delicious! I topped it with a simple Ragu Alfredo Sauce and finely chopped ten cloves of garlic in to it. (don't fear the garlic. it made the pizza!) I also lightly coated the outer crust with olive oil. Then topped it with canned artichoke hearts, fresh mushrooms, fresh basil, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella and shaved parmesan. Man was that a great pizza! For as cheap as some of the ingredients were, it tasted exactly like a creamy, garlicky specialty vegetarian pizza you would get at a higher end pizzeria! Thanks Jay!

I followed the recipe exactly to start off but had to make serious changes to salvage it.  The first problem is that there is too much liquid relative to the flour. At step three I had a nearly liquid "dough" that I was supposed to turn out and knead.  I added the needed flour in order to make it solidify.  The pizza turned out flavorless.  I followed other's advice and par-baked it for a few mins before adding the toppings.

Great pizza crust. Just enough crunch on the outside and soft enough in the middle. Perfect pizza crust for homemade pizza. I baked mine on a stone and it was wonderful.

SPECTACULAR!  I make this recipe generally once a week.  I make the dough in the morning, let it rise ONCE toss it into a loose plastic bag and put it in the refrigerator, for use that evening.  I might have to punch it once during the day.  I use it as a substitute for bread stick dough too.

This is a fantastic pizza crust!  I come from Chicago and live now in Germany.  The pizza here is horrible so I decided to make a real pizza for family and friends.  This crust did the trick.  Everyone was amazed how good an American style pizza is.  Like others have said: when pan baking, pre-bake it about 6 minutes or it will be mushy.

This crust is delightfully chewy, and yet crispy at the same time. I don't think I will ever use another one. If I have time I make the dough with only half the flour (a sponge) and let it rest for an hour before adding the rest of the flour, for added chewiness, and a fuller flavor. But the recipe is fantastic as is!

Awesome recipe!  I make this into 2 'thin crusts as that's what my family prefers and often add garlic plus or other spices to the dough to make it a flavoured crust.  They never want take out pizza anymore - just homemade!

WOW!  I don't understand this at all.  It's flour and water and yeast, just like all the other pizza dough recipes, yet this one is truly the best.  VERY easy dough to work with.  Bakes nicely.  I can't say enough happy things about it!

Excellent crust.  I made 4 small pizzas with the dough so everyone was able to customize their own pizza.  We then grilled it on the BBQ.  One crust I rolled out too thin for the BBQ, but the rest I left with thicker crusts.  Everyone loved it!

I have four teenage boys and a husband.  I need enough food to fill their tummies and this pan pizza was incredible.  It was HUGE!!!  I used 12 inch pizza pans and had to half the bread since it makes for two pizzas that size.  They could only eat a quarter of a pizza and were too full.  I used the recipe for "Easy Pizza Sauce III" as my sauce and it was Soooo good. I will definitely make this again.  We brushed ours with olive oil, seasoned with italian seasoning, and pre baked the crust for 10 minutes.  You have to cook the crust slightly prior to topping it. I had so much left over that I precooked a pizza, topped it and stored it for the next night's dinner.  Oh, I also made cheesy sticks. Yum!

5 stars for sure I'm always making this pizza crust its so delicious. I bake it for the full 20 minutes cause when I take it out earlier I feel there's a floury taste to it. I also use bread flour instead of all purpose cause it comes out softer and I also rub butter on the crust when it comes right out of the oven YUM!

This is the best pizza dough ever.  I saved half of the dough and put it in the fridge for the next day.  However I forgot to have the dough sit until it was room temperature.  Cooking the dough cold in the oven is really good, but it was even better when it was fresh, so I am thinking letting it sit for an hour at room temp would have made it better.

really good but don't make crust too thin, it will get mushy. make sure to grease the pan because the bread will stick and you won't be able to get pizza out.

Perfect!  Just tried this out, but only had white whole wheat flour on hand.  The dough didn't rise as much as it would've with all-purpose flour--as expected--but the pizza crust still turned out fantastic.  Easy and fun for the kids, too!  Thank you!

I made this dough using my kitchenaid and it turned out perfect.  This dough rose beautifully and when baked was both crispy and fluffy.  Will definitely be making more homemade pizza from now on.

Very yummy. I added garlic powder to the dough. It turned out very soft and chewy. I forgot to prebake the crust and I think that would have helped it to cook more evenly. It ended up a bit on the thick side for me. I may try it again and spread out further to see if I can get it to thin out a bit.

Best Pizza Dough! Pared it with "Way Easy Pizza Sauce/Bread Sauce" found on this site.  Makes the best and easiest pizza.  I use it for a deep dish and cook on a stone.  Daycare kids loved it and now my Grandkids enjoy.

This is the best pizza dough I have come across. I did add italian seasoning, garlic powder and shredded parmesan cheese. I did bake it for 15 minutes without any toppings since I don't have a pizza stone, which has to be done. Thanks for the great pizza.

I saved a cup of this dough for the next day, storing it in the fridge wrapped in plastic wrap. However the next day I had the craving for something sweet and made cinnamon buns instead! It worked perfectly, making 6 miniature cinnamon buns. They cooked up golden on the outside and tender on the inside. Will definitely do this again, but with much more filling next time for extra gooey-ness.

I followed the directions exactly. I used 3.5C flour. I used my Kitchen Aid and personally, I like the dough a little sticky. That is what makes it light and not dense. TIP: instead of using a floured surface, oil a counter top and your hands to handle the dough and you will be able to work with it a lot better. Use a rolling pin and your (oiled hands) to roll into a circle.

Very good and fluffy. I did add 1 1/2 Tbsp Honey instead of brown sugar. I put the dough in the fridge to chill after proofing for 45 min. After 20 min. it was ready to shape. Chilling the dough makes it easier to shape into a round pizza crust.

Wonderful crispy yet soft and chewy crust. I followed suggestions from past reviewers which helped a lot and I also added a little more br. sugar, fresh herbs and fresh grated parmesan cheese to the dough mixture. It was absolutely flavorful and delicious. The only thing I forgot was to brush on a little olive oil to the crust to help it stay nice and golden. We were happy with the way the texture of the pizza crust turned out great which was slightly crusty on the outside. This was my first attempt to make home made pizza dough. Thank you Jay for this delicious recipe. I used, "Exquisite Pizza Sauce," also from this website. I plan on making this again as this was a hit with my family!

Excellent pizza crust, a tad hard to handle - but super soft & bakes well.  I used my bread machine for the first 3 steps.

Great crust! Love it. When adding the salt and olive oil to the yeast mixture, also sprinkle in LOTS of Italian seasoning. Makes for a great tasting crust with lots of flavor.

I have tried many pizza dough recipes but have kept searching for "the one." This is it! My searching is over! Best pizza crust ever!!! You can make the dough thick, and it's crusty with a nice soft center. If you make it thinner and cook it a little longer, it makes the perfect crispy thin crust. WONDERFUL!

OMG!  Are you kidding me?!  This pizza crust is so good!!  I've tried sooooo many recipes and none have satisfied.  I did swap out 1 cup of all purpose flour for 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour and it still turned out great.  Definitely keeping this one.  My days of ordering way overpriced pizza are over!

This pizza crust is awesome!  My husband and I have used it over and over again and it turns out perfect every time!  This recipe makes a lot of dough and we don't necessarily like really thick dough so we usually make bread sticks with the extra dough.

For my first attempt at homemade pizza, this turned out pretty well.  Main problem was the dough was very sticky and could have used more flour from the start.  Nothing extra flour couldn't fix. Once I got the dough set in the pan I let it rest for about 30 minutes before putting on the toppings and baking.  Was perfect in 16 minutes.  Looks like I will be making homemade pizza more often.

This was my first time cooking with yeast, and I am happy to say it was easier than I thought! The dough was tasty, but keep in mind it makes a lot of it-- enough to cover an entire 18X13 pan, and I would have rolled it thinner if I had the space. If you have a round pizza tray/stone, I recommend using it to make two personalized pizzas. I will keep this recipe because it was so easy and tastes better than store bought.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! It was my first time making a pizza crust so I was a bit nervous, but it was delicious! I also used "Easy Pizza Sauce III" from this site and wow, it was so delicious. I'm definitely making my own pizza from now on. :) I would recommend the recipe. Just follow instructions!!!

I've made this several times and have decided that I like it best as two medium pizzas because we like a thinner crust at our house.  For the first time last night, we actually had leftovers so I discovered today that the crust holds its own reheated as well.  On Valentine's Day, we make dinner together as a family and I used this recipe (with a little cinnamon & sugar) to make a treatzza pizza.  That was good too.

I loved this dough. I just put all the ingredients into my breadmaker, letting it do all the work, and I just have to decide what toppings.

First time ever making pizza crust, only made half the recipe for a smaller crust - turned out great! I used half whole wheat all purpose and half cake & pastry flour. Had to bake for nearly 25 mins tho, turning up the heat around 20 mins to 500 degrees. Crust is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

Excellent! Tastes like a fresh, awesome version of pan pizza crust. The recipe is also open to adaptation - you can add herbs (fresh or dried), cheese, or spices and have a gourmet flavored crust. I will make it again and again.

This pizza crust worked wonderfully!! The best dough I have tried. I added some onion powder, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese into the dough because I like a little extra flavor in my crust. Since I used a pan and not a stone, I baked the crust for 10 minutes before adding the toppings. It tasted delicious and had the soft chewy texture you look for in a great pizza.

REALLY AWESOME! I added about 2 TBSP of parmesan cheese into the dough. Also one thing you NEED to do is put a good layer of cornmeal down so it doesn't stick, and LET IT RISE for like 45 minutes after you form it on the pizza stone before you add sauce and toppings. FINALLY A WINNER! Been trying to perfect my pizza for years!

I liked this crust recipe. I divided the recipe based on the recommendation of other reviewers. I also took the advice to add garlic/onion powder and italian seasoning. I do need to add more because it wasn't enough and exact measurements weren't provided. Would definitely use again though.

OMG!!! You just helped me prove to my BF that pizza can taste good when it's made at home! He was convinced that the crust wouldn't come out properly, when he saw it in the oven he quickly changed his mind. He absolutely loves ur crust! Looks like I'll be makin pizza at home alot more now!

Great basic recipe. This is my first attempt at homemade pizza. I live in the south and I am from Chicago so ALL the pizza here just doesn't cut it. I did make a few changes but this recipe
is a good beginning. I added italian seasoning and garlic powder to the oil-salt mixture. This makes a BIG pizza, I easily made a pizza 16 inches across on a round cheap pizza pan with holes. I rolled it very thin, it was easy to roll. I have enough left over for a 10 or 12 pie. 
 Pre-heated oven to 450. I also brushed the crust with olive oil-melted butter  and let rise 10 more min. I pre cooked for 6 min. took out and added toppings. Cooked for 12 mins. spun around and cooked for 5 mins more. This is just like a Chicago thin crust pizza. 
Changes I will make next time:Pre-cook for 10 mins. Brush with butter only, and cook on the lowest rack. The crust was alittle undercooked underneth. But just a little. This crust can be thick or thin it's just up to you....thanks

Awesome - but don't cook this pizza crust for 10 minutes if you spread it out thin... I put 2 crusts in for 6 minutes and 1 of the 2 burnt pretty bad that quickly...

This was very good! I wish I read reviews because, as a newbie making breads, I was just following the recipe. The flour was way off for me. I added an extra cup of flour while using the dough hook on my KA and it was still extremely sticky. I was afraid to add more thinking it would mess up the dough. It rose fine and was still pretty sticky but I stretched it out with some more flour and it actually came out great! Seems to be a fool-proof recipe but I will definitely be using more flour next time.

This pizza crust was SO WONDERFUL I can hardly stand it.  You should know that 1. Pizza is my favorite thing to eat so I'm particular, and 2. Yeast is my mortal enemy and, even with that in mind, the final product of this crust was everything it promised to be, light, fluffy, chewy crust.  Oh. My. Goodness.  Thank you thank you thank you!!!  Anyone would be hard-pressed to find a better tasting, easy to make pizza crust.  BE WARNED - this makes a BIG pizza!!!

This is the best pizza crust by far I have ever tried!  I followed the directions and it was perfect!  I did cook it before putting on the toppings since I do not have a stone.  Very good!  Will use this from now on!  Thanks Jay!

Great crust. Followed the directions and it turned out great. I made it into two crusts, way too much for one.

Kids love it, especially when crust is brushed with garlic-parsley butter after removing from oven. This is my only pizza crust recipe from now on.  Thanks so much!!

Awesome!!! The things that made the difference for me is I used Spelt and unbleached flour. I also left the dough out for over 4 hours and when I cooked the pizza the dough was super soft. My husband said it was the best homemade pizza he'd ever had. Going to make it again this weekend!

okay, I have made this pizza crust three or four times before and thought it was good, but not anything wonderful. However, this evening I made this crust again and realized I was not letting the crust rise 15 to 20 minutes after putting it on the pizza pan.  this is the key to a nice crust!  I also stretched the dough out about 1 inch past the edge of the pizza pan and rolled some of the shredded mozzerella cheese up in the crust.  Took a little work, but it was really good and looked great.   I also baked the pizza at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes then bumped it up to the 425 degrees to brown the cheese a litte.  I don't like a doughy crust.

Used my industrial mixer.  Added 1 t of garlic powder & 1 T of Italian seasoning.  It's makes such a nice dough that my 8 & 6 year old could work their own crusts.  Awesome & easy!

I loved how this dough turned out. It was my first ever pizza from scratch and I was very pleased with the results. I made two pizzas with the ingredients listed for this recipe. It took a little longer than anticipated but next time around I will know how to manage my time for efficiently and how to make the dough. Thanks for posting this!

After my first ever adventure with home-made pizza dough I was scared to try it again, but seeing as I'm trying to learn how to cook better I decided it was time to face my fear. I stumbled upon this recipe. It is now going to be an addition to my cookbook. Ive never had a better pizza. Thank you for this!

I must have done something wrong....  Although the dough rose nicely before baking, once baked the crust was hard and thin, not having puffed up at all.

This was really easy to make and turned out awesome. This was my first ever homemade pizza, I didn't have a pizza pan so I put it on a baking sheet since the recipe calls for a "giant pizza crust". I followed the recipe to a tee, but next time I might add a few spices to it but it truly is awesome just the way it is. I paired it with Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site.

Really great pan pizza crust!!  It wasn't easy to make, but it wasn't difficult either.  Also, the dough didn't rise as much as I thought it would - but it turned out great so I guess it didn't matter.

This is really good pizza crust!  I used half for a pizza, and froze the other half.  A couple days later I used that half to make breadsticks.  I forgot, though, that as it's freezing, it's likely to try to rise.  Next time I'll leave more room in the container.  :)  Thanks, Jason!

I use all whole wheat flour with instant yeast in this recipe and it works great. I do, however, find I need to add more flour to get a workable dough. But I also grind fresh wheat, so that may have something to do with it.

It makes 2 medium pizza for my family.  The crusts not too thick but not too thin either. I added 1 tsp of Italian spices.

Delicious! Made it in my bread maker on the dough setting, and it was enough for two medium sized (12" or so) pizzas. Thanks!

I was a bit disappointed in this.  I found the dough to be too dense and hard to work with.  I used dark brown sugar (all I had on hand), which may have caused this.  The dough was sweet and the consistency was like that of pretzel dough.  Maybe I'll have to tweak it some.  I've probably made over 200 pizzas using my own recipe, so I'm not a novice making pizza.  This dough wasn't awful - just wasn't what I look for in a pizza crust.

This is some yummy dough! The best I have ever made! I have made a lot too! I made "as is" and added some basil to the dough. This dough is definitely too much for one pizza so I made it in my large and medium pans. The large was a thinner dough and the medium was a deep dish style that went very fast! Next time I plan on making 2 mediums. I printed this recipe out and I am looking no further!

This pizza crust had good flavor, but I think there is probably a better crust out there somewhere.  It made much more than I needed for one pizza so I made breadsticks with part of the dough.  I did what some others had suggested and pre-baked the pizza for about 5 minutes or so before adding the toppings.  The bottom crust was nice and crispy.  I'm still going to try other recipes.

This recipe was my first attempt at homemade pizza crust.  It turned out excellent!  The only change I would make is to add something like garlic-butter to the crust, something to make it a bit more flavorful.  A+++

8/30/10 Pretty good crust recipe. Will try 1/3 whole wheat flour next time. Good tip is to let the pizza dough rise on the pan for 10 - 15 minutes before cooking. Also tastes good with a couple tablespoons of garlic and some italian seasoning. 12/31/10 Heat the pizza stones up before making the pizzas. This creates a delicious crust. Also I still love adding chopped garlic and italian seasonings to the dough although this time I was out of italian seasoning so I used basil and oregano. Yum!

Easy to make, tastes very good just not "the best" I have had! I grilled to crusts on my gas grill and then wrapped in foil overnight as I wanted to use them in a hurry the next day and wouldn't have time to cook them fresh. I added sauce and tons of veggies and mozzarella and tossed in the oven to melt the cheese. Everyone raved about them!

Excellent! I tried this pizza crust recipe today; it was the first time I had ever made a home made pizza crust.  VERY easy -- not even worth the hassle of breaking out the ol' bread machine.  I did pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes before adding my toppings to ensure the crust got nice and golden brown and crispy.  Added my toppings, then finished baking until the cheese was all beautifully melted.  The crust was delicious and crispy and chewy!  Wonderful! Will use forever and ever and am excited to try different types of pizzas now!

This is the stuff.  Takes a little getting used to as with any dough, but the results are fantastic.  Better than any crust we have purchased from local pizza shops.

Excellent crust. I made it in the bread machine on the dough cycle and added some italian seasoning and garlic powder. It made 3 medium pizza's. My house smelled like a pizzaria before I even cooked the crust. I messed up and was waiting for the bottom to get golden. It never did and I burnt the pizza slightly. Still delicious. I will never buy a store bought crust again. You can't even compare the 2. UPDATE: I have made this 4 times now. I always put cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza pans. I tried baking the crust for 5 min and then adding the toppings but thought it came out too hard. I definitely won't do that again.

This is the best pizza crust! I use this recipe all the time and threw out the recipes for crust that I had used before. The only thing that I add to it is about a tsp of Italian herbs to the dough mixture.

Excellent!  I used Whole Wheat Flour and 3 TBS of vital wheat gluten.  Even the picky eaters liked it.

SO easy to make, and tastes great! I use the same recipe for bread sticks, all you have to do is brush them with butter afterward.

I substituted 1 cup of WW flour, doubled the brown sugar, and added italian seasoning and garlic salt to taste.  I also pre-baked the crust in my pan for 10 min. before topping.  It was perfect!

I wanted to make pizza at home for the first time and was looking for an easy, but good, recipe for pizza dough.  Well I found it in this one!  My entire family loved it and wants pizza more than ever.  I was able to make two, 12" pizzas which was more than enough for our family.

I have made this time and time again. It's the perfect crust. Thanks for sharing!  This recipes makes 2 pizzas. The dough refrigerates/freeze well. I usually bake the dough 7-10 minutes prior to topping (I just have a regular perforated pizza sheet). This way, the crust stays crisp.

Absolutely the best pizza crust I have tried, no more searching needed. I split the dough in half and made 2 medium size pizza on 2 different days.  This crust turns out so nice I'm seriously thinking of using this for a Sicillian Pizza.

If you have 2 hours to plan ahead this is worth it.  Made 2 batches, one on a pizza stone and the other in oiled cast oil skillets. Let them rise again and prebaked x 10 minutes.  The skillet's made fluffy crust that you could cut off and dip in olive oil.

I added garlic powder to the mix and really enjoyed it.  The outsides were crispy and the middle was still soft.  I found it a little too thick for my liking, so next time I'll add less yeast and/or roll it out thinner.

My crust came out VERY thick so I will have to work on my tecnique.  But even though it was thick, it was airy and good so it sat well in the belly.

It was pretty darn good!  I wish it would have browned better on the outside, though.  I used a pizza stone and cooked it for about 25 minutes, and it still wouldn't brown!  he dough was easy to make, though, and very yummy!  I added some spices to it to kick up the flavor, but that's it.  I will def use again!

This was so good.  It did take quite a bit more flour than it calls for.  I used a dark-colored pan and pressed it out thin.  Pre-baked for 3 minutes and then topped it.  Removed it from the pan for the last few minutes and baked directly on the oven rack.  The crust was crispy and chewy - just the way I like it!

Made a double batch of this for a birthday party. It was so simple, that it wasn't at all hard to fit in to party prep. I split the dough into several small balls and let each guest make an individual pizza. Adults and children alike loved this crust. It is simple, tasty and has an excellent texture.

I have never made pizza dough before and mine turned out great the first time! The crust is light as a feather and easy to work with. The recipe is super easy to follow and tastes great. This will be my go to dough from now on. Thanks :)

I love this crust, however my sister does not.  To me it's soft and chewy while still crunchy on the outside.  I like to top it with "Exquisite Pizza Sauce", also found on allrecipes, and lots and lots of veggies.  It makes a large hearty pizza.

The new standby in pizza crust! I put all ingredients in the bread machine (I make 1 1/2 recipes for 2 large pizzas) on the dough make option only. It's ready in about 1hr to 1 1/2 hrs. and saves us money on pizza and makes great pizza dough and we are discriminating pizza eaters! It's good with the standard pizzas or BBQ chicken pizza or Thai. Very versatile.

This was a pretty good baisc crust and really easy to make.  I did pre-cook the crust for about 5 or 6 minutes and then cooked the pizza about 14 minutes (but of course ovens vary) and it turned out well.  I have 6 children and cook for 8 every night and still had to double this to make enough but 1 1/2 times the amount would have been about perfect to feed a large family like mine.  Thanks!

Great crust.  I made this in my bread machine and it turned out nicely.  The recipe definitely makes a very thick crust, or a very large pizza.

Great pizza dough recipe. It was super easy to knead in my KA for about 5 minutes. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it didn't get crispy at all on the bottom, but I think I just need one of those pizza pans with the holes in it or something. Next time I might try some whole wheat flour. UPDATE: I tried again with a real pizza pan, but it was still doughy on the bottom, so I transfered it straight to the oven rack for a few minutes at the end, and that helped a lot! Also, we used almost all whole wheat flour this time and I would not recommend it. It completely changed the consistancy and texture of the crust. I think I will do 2 cups regular flour, 1 cup wheat from now on.

I let it  rise for a couple hours then put it in the fridge. Next day I pulled it out and let it sit on the counter till room temp. I added some Italian spices and next time I will add more salt. It was the best dough I've ever made!

I used this recipe last night to make my first homemade pizza ever. It was very easy to make and I didn't find it inconvenient at all to let it rise for a little while since I had other things to do. I followed the recipe and I topped the rolled crust with sauteed onions, mushrooms, roasted garlic, mozzarella and parmesan cheese. I cooked it for 20 minutes. I could not believe how beautiful and puffy this pizza was! It was absolutely perfect! I told my husband that dinner was done and he took one look at the pizza and ran to get the camera hehe. He was so proud of me that he wanted to take a picture. It is funny because I would consider myself to be a good cook, and I cook all of the time. It tasted as good as it looked! Thank you so much for the recipe! I don't think I will ever try another crust!

Dear Jay, you have pushed the boundaries of home cooking. I had no idea what could be achieved with a tin of flour, a rolling pin and an oven until I made this recipe. I acheived the most soft, fluffy, doughy pizza crust I've ever eaten. My buddies were speechless. One of my mates even went out the next day and bought a new oven so he could make this.  Advice: I only got the hang of this on the fourth try. The key is to really MAKE SURE the dough is "no longer sticky". I ended up having to use a lot more flour than I expected when "kneading in more flour". I really dug my fingers deep into the dough, and got every inch of it smooth. This also took a lot more effort than I expected. I really had to work up a big sweat to get a result here. When punhcing the dough, I also didn't hold back.  What I got was a very rubbery dough. When streching it out onto the pan, it had a lot of resistence, and kept wanting to bounce back. This was the main difference I noticed between this attempt and my other, unsuccessful, attempts.   Great!

This  crust is the best. Pizza always was a disaster for me, I always had problems with pizza crust. Sometimes it was very thick, sometimes very dry, sometimes I had something else. I tried this crust and I can`t believe I have a crust from an Italian restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly and I used the recomendations to make a thin crust (AR articles). This is a winner recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  The only changes I made were to use honey instead of brown sugar and I added 1/2 t of garlic powder and 1/2 t Italian seasoning to the crust.  I just tossed it in with the oil and salt.  This is probably the BEST homemade pizza yet!

I wish I had followed Jay's directions instead of the other reviewers'. I baked my crust a couple of minutes before topping it. It was hard as a rock. Also, one reviewer said it was like pizza hut's pan pizza. I think they meant hand-tossed. This recipe was the closest I came to getting it right. I'll try it again and follow directions. It's not Jay's fault I listened to others.  :)

Spray your hands with cooking spray and it will be easier to handle the sticky dough.

Fantastic dough. Unimaginably good! I followed the recipe exactly.

This was great!  First homemade pizza that my husband actually liked!  I used some of the dough to make mini pizzas for the little ones.  They have food allergies so I made their pizza's without cheese.  Great for the whole family, everyone loved it!  We will be making this again soon!

I was out of flour, so I subbed about half of the flour with yellow corn meal.  The texture was firmer and had a hint of corn meal...we loved it!  I also used vegetable oil instead of olive oil.

This crust is amazing. I used 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour and used whole wheat for the rest. I topped it with a homemade pizza sauce and cheddar, feta, and goat cheese.

I used a pizza crust recipe for 10 years, but was experimenting with others.  I will never use antoher recipe except this one.  It is easy, it rises plump, and is a super chewy crust.

Perfect pizza crust!  This is so simple it seems impossible that it could be that good.  This will be my go to pizza crust from now on.  One batch yielded me two large crusts.  It raised perfectly.  I did let it set 10-15 minute before using my hands to press it into a round shape on my pizza pans.  I prebaked my crust for 10 minutes at 375 degrees for 10 minutes, topped it, then baked for an additional 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  It was slightly crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.  YUM!

I was so shocked this actually turned out okay.  I halved the recipe since we like thin crust.  Forgot the oil until after I stirred.  Used wheat flour.  I only let it rise 45 minutes.  I have the pizza stone so I just put in the oven with the toppings then cooked.  I also added garlic powder and rosemary to the dough.

This is the best pizza dough recipe that I have come by. I have used it for 2 years now. I use my stand mixer with the dough hook and it comes out perfect everytime. I also recommend that the dough is prebaked for about 10-12 mins before adding toppings. I add 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to give it alittle zip.

Very good crust and very easy to make.  It makes a pretty thick crust for one pizza, so if you like it thinner, you'll want to divide the dough.

THis was wonderful. I made it for my family and our company and several commented on the crust. I let it raise for 1 hour in an oven that I preheated at 170 degress and shut off. It raised very nicely. Don't overcook this. I made two pans, the one I let the edges get nice and brown but when we ate it  the edges got alittle crisp. The other one I took out when it was very lightly browned but this one I actually had on a stone too so that probably helped. This was our favorite homemade crust we have ever had.

Make sure you stretch the dough out really thin, ours puffed up really thick in the oven becuase we did not stretch it out enough.

The crust came out perfect! It was hard and crunchy enough to be able  to hold all of the toppings that we put in it, and soft enough to make it perfect.

We have fun making adjustments to this recipe. After the yeast has risen, we add oregano, italian seasoning, parsley, cinnamon. Great recipe!

Easy recipe that makes fantastic pizzas (and I'm a novice to any kind of breadmaking.)  We made 6 8" individual pizzas from one recipe then had the kids "top their own."  Followed one reviewer's advice and baked on the bottom rack so that the crust baked completely and toppings didn't burn.  Will definately use again!

I followed the recipe to a T and the dough was way to sticky to work with...I added another 3/4 cup of flour and it was still to sticky...I finished the recipe, cooked the pizza and the crust tasted like flour...not impressed, sorry

I substituted whole wheat flour instead of white flour and used a teaspoon of organic maple syrup instead of sugar. Was delicious and crispy. I put the rest in my refrigerator and intend to make more pizza later this week. Topped with mozzerella and romano cheese, it was the best.

This was fantastic!  I ended up needing all the flour in order to make the dough not stick, and then added some more flour while I was shaping the crust.  Instead of making a round pizza, I just stretched it out onto my rectangular stoneware.  One recipe made a wonderful pan-style pizza crust that both my husband and I were impressed with.  I sprayed the crust with Pam and baked it for 10 minutes, then added my toppings and baked for ~10 more minutes until the cheese browned - all at 425F.

Per someone's suggestion, I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of Oregano with dash of freshly-cracked black pepper into the batter before kneading the dough. I also brushed some olive oil on pizza edges and baked crust with pizza sauce for 10 min. at 325 degrees before adding other toppings. My “Chicken Mozzarella Ham Pizza” really came out crusty on the outside and chewy from inside. This recipe can make two 10" thick crusts and three 10” thin crusts. So, next time we will double all ingredients to freeze them for later use.

This recipe is fantastic.  One thing I do differently is use quick rise yeast.  It may not yield such high-quality dough, but the time it saves me is well worth it.  So I add all dry ingredients together and then pour in the wet, and mix as usual.  I immediately shape it into pizzas and let rise maybe 15-20 mintues, just to say it bulks up a bit (I still put them in a warm moist place covered in a towel).  Then I top and bake.  Simple as that.  Remember that if you don't roll the ends of your dough inwards after shaping it, you won't get a nice crust.  Just roll them to the desired thickness.

This is my favorite pizza dough recipe. I've made it so many times just as the recipe says. I do bloom my yeast first (habit since I had a bad pack of yeast once and had brick bread. I've made this so many times I only measure out the water, everything else I just add until it looks good. Great crust!

This made 8 personal size pizza crusts for us and it held up well on the BBQ for grilling we loved the texture and was chewy which we like, great recipe! We made some thick and some thin crust both were equally good!

ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  This crust is the BEST homemade crust ever!  We rarely get "take out" pizza since we really enjoy making our own.  However, we've also tried lots of dough recipes and never really found one we love - well this is it dangit!  EASY and absolutely fab!  We typically (because we've made it several times now) do one pizza and one cheese bread - fantastic every time!  Thanks, Jay, for ending our perfect pizza crust search!

Before making this, I never could get a pizza crust quite right, but this recipe was it! I add mixed Italian seasoning in with the flour, along with a bit more onion and garlic powder, always sprinkle the bottom of the crust with corn meal, and pre-bake it for a few min before topping, and I have never had a better crust from any restaurant I've ever eaten at. We've made this quite a few times now, and it's so nice to let your family top their quarter of the pizza as they please and there's no arguments about who wants what kind of pizza! Now if I can just perfect a good sauce!

Fabulous! Like other reviewers I added some garlic & onion powder to the dough.  I also sprayed the dough with butter flavored Pam and prebaked it for 10 minutes. Next time I will only prebake it for 5 because it came out a little hard. This will be my go-to pizza dough recipe from now on.

I am a big fan of Pizza Hut's pan style pizza and have been trying to replicate it at home for years. Thanks to this recipe, I finally succeeded in my attempt! Now I make pizza with this recipe at least once a week. Sometimes I substitute malt syrup for the brown sugar and add in a sprig of fresh oregano...yummy!

Yum! I was surprised at how easy it is too. My only change was I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 bread flour. Now I look forward to trying the other reviewers suggestions.

First time crust-maker. Recipe was simple, and gives an absolutely delicious result. I did add some garlic and onion powder, about 1/2 tsp each, although next time I might add a little bit more. I divided dough into 2...my pizza stone isnt that big, and there are 2 different "tastes" in the family. I had a bit of a hard time transferring the dough round from a cookie sheet to the pizza stone. I used what I thought was quite a good layer of cornmeal. Next time I might try spraying it a bit. Before I added the toppings, I brushed some olive oil over the dough and sprinkled with italian seasoning. Nice crunchy outside (not hard) and fluffy inside. Better than delivery or frozen. I have requests to make again in the next couple days. THANKS!!

This is SO easy to make and delicious!  I added garlic and onion powder for extra flavor.  I used a pizza stone to make three smaller pizzas.  It was a fun pizza night, everyone had what they wanted, and not to mention, cheap!  We will make this again and again.  I will try again with whole wheat flour.

This was not awesome pizza crust.  No matter how long I cooked it, the inside came out doughy.  It was also pretty flavorless.

My wife and I use recipe this every time we make pizza.  We make one large deep dish pizza with some dough left over.  We put the extra dough in a 9x9 baking pan and make breadsticks in the oven while we are spreading the dough for the pizza.  Thanks for the great recipe!

this is my first time i make pizza and this recipe helps me produce a brilliant pizza! although i wrongly measure the water and it turns out as runny liquid after mixing, so i had to compensate with a large amount of flour (didnt measure how much as i only use my hand to add until the dough is not sticky) but nevertheless, it turns out just right! like other reviewer said, it taste like pizza hut pan pizza crust. thanks for sharing!

Wow, what a terrific crust! The best we've tried to date. The only alteration I made was subbing in 1 cup of whole wheat flour to add a healthy touch. The dough was extremely easy to work with an roll out. I got two medium thin crust pizzas out of this recipe. Made it on my pizza stone and pre-baked crust for 7 minutes on lower rack first. Brushed with olive oil to prevent sauce making the crust soggy, then topped as usual. This is a keeper! Thanks very much for sharing, Jason.

A great recipe! I use 2 cups whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose flour. I also season the dough when I add the oil, using approximately 1 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, and dried basil. I add extra salt and it's wonderful! This is my go to dough recipe.

What's great about this dough is that it can turn to either the thicker bread like variety or the thinner crustier (and hence less filling) variety depending on how you handle it. I am pretty hopeless at rolling out dough into a perfectly round circle so what I do is I beat down an appropriate amount of dough into a minimally floured pizza pan, then lift up the shaped dough with both hands while someone oils the pan, then place it back in. The dough would've stretched to larger than the pan size by this point (and thinner than before lifting it from the pan), so I cut of the excess and use it for the next pizza pan, patching up any small holes with dough.

Made this today exact per recipe and it made 2 sm-med pizza's for us.  Baked the first one exact per recipe and it was light and fluffy and baked on our Pizza Stone for 15 minutes at the 425.  Then the 2nd pizza I poked holes with a fork all over it and slid it onto the Pizza Stone, it baked in 11 minutes and was thin crispy crust!  I used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe from this site and my we loved this!  There is no need to ever get pizza out again!  This was awesome and the pizza disappeared as fast as it came out of the oven!  It was incredible!  Thank you for posting this easy recipe that is delicious!

Great recipe, and so easy!  I never thought homemade pizza would be my "lazy night" meal, but seriously, this stuff is additively good AND only takes a minimal effort to pull together. I made it for my new sis-in-law and her two little boys the other day, and they went on and on... the two year old just kept saying, "more, more" and banging his plate.  This crust rocks!

Best pizza dough recipe I've tried yet.  I added some seasonings:  1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning.  I also increased the brown sugar to 1 tsp.  I "knead" the dough for 10 minutes using my KitchenAide with the dough hook.  I sprinkle cornmeal over the pizza pan before I press the dough into it.  I also rubbed the outer crust with olive oil prior to putting the toppings on.

This crust was fantastic!  If you have a lot of toppings (our bbq chicken and hawaiian pizzas were pretty loaded), prebaking is a great idea...doesn't need a lot, just 5-10 min at 400 will do the trick.  I loved the idea of adding seasonings but didn't see any amounts in any reviews, so I guestimated and came up with: 1 heaping tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of onion powder, and 1/2 tsp of oregano.  I kept the salt the same and added a few generous dashes of black pepper--wow!  Jay gave the great texture and here's the great flavor! I started my pizzas at 375 and turned them up to 425 at the end to get a nice brown on them.  I also rubbed the outer crust with olive oil.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good, thick crust recipe. Very simple, and easy to prepare. I may try suggestions from other reviwers and add some herbs to the mixture next time to kick it up a little.

This is simply just the best pizza crust recipe out there.  I have made it too many times to count and I have found that it definitely bakes better on a pizza stone.  It will throw you at first b/c the consistency is sort of sticky, but just hang in there and follow the recipe.  Believe me, you won't be disappointed.  You will never order take out pizza again!

This is a great recipe after I figured out what worked best for me.  First, I mixed everything in the bread machine like any other dough.  I split the dough in half but we like a thick crust and so no more splitting the dough.  The first half, I baked on a pizza stone on the bottom shelf but will not do that again as it was tough.  I refrigerated the second half and removed from the refrigerator, generously oiled a small iron skillet, sprinkled with cornmeal and "tossed" the dough by letting the weight of the dough shape the circle.  (Just hold by the edge and work around in a circle until the right size.)  I placed it in the pan with a piecrust edge.  The crust rose on top of the warm stove while the oven was heating.  Then, I put on the toppings, drizzled a little extra olive oil around the outside crust and baked on the middle rack.  This was great!  We want be ordering anymore Pizza Hut pizza!  I don't see a need for preheating the skillet or prebaking the crust.  This is a really good crust and I look forward to trying bread sticks and cinnamon sticks with it.  I might try a little more sugar in the crust next time - possibly natural brown sugar, a little Italian seasoning and garlic as some suggested although, my husband said that it is perfect the way it is.  Thanks for a great recipe, Jay!

Loved this pizza dough recipe. After topping the pizza I brushed the edges of the crust with olive oil before baking. It made 2 pizzas so I topped the second one and put it in the fridge unbaked for the next day, turned out perfect!

Good pizza crust. I poked holes in the crust with a fork before baking to elimate any air pockets.  I added Garlic, Rosemary, Thyme, Basil & Oregano to the crust before baking.  Made 1 1/2 of the amounts to make two big round pizza sheets.  It was really good!

This is a great recipe! I have used it for pizza as well as italian pizza bread(italian dressing with asiago, parmesan and mozzarella cheese sprinkled on top). Everyone loves it. I noticed a few people were saying they had tough crusts. If this is the case you are over-kneeding your crust. The recipes states to add flour till it is no longer sticky but there should be a slight moistness before it goes through the 1 hour rising period or it will be dried out and tough. I also sprinkle cornmeal on the pan before I place the dough on to it. This definitely adds to it!

Nice, chewy crust...but not a lot of flavor.  We even added herbs to the mix, so we'll double what we added.  This made 2 nice sized pizzas.  Next time we will try the advice to move the oven rack down lower.  The crust was a little soft for our taste.

Very good pizza crust. Makes enough for a big cookie sheet. Change serving size to 10 for a pizza pan/pizza stone.

I make this dough about once a month for homemade pizzas. The temperature of the water is critical, as to not kill the yeast. Very yummy!

Wow. My husband said the pizza I made with this crust tonight is the best pizza he's ever had. This is a terrific recipe. I did end up adding more flour than it called for (don't know how much more) and it was still fairly sticky), but still perfect.  I topped it with a pizza cheese shred, a little bit of "crushed tomatoes with basil and herbs" some pepperoni, sprinkle of italian seasoning, some ground pepper, and finely grated parmesan reggiano...and mmmmm goood! We will never order pizza again.

Fab!  Great recipe.  The Family loved it.  I make it in the bread machine on the dough cycle.  I would add a little more flour because both times I've made the recipe it was very sticky and loose.  Still tasted good.!!

Excellent! I've always been intimidated by anything that required yeast but this recipe worked like a charm as written. Like other reviewers I added a bit of dried onion and garlic for that extra something. The texture and consistency of the crust is right on! Superior to fast food pizza and right up there with gourmet pizza.

AWESOME!!  I made this tonight on the grill and it worked wonderfully.  I even mixed the dough last night and refrigerated it until today and still was wonderful.  I made a barbecue chicken pizza with Big Al's KC BBQ sauce, diced chicken I had grilled beforehand and basted with the sauce, carmelized red onions, and cheddar cheese.  Made another one with roasted garlic and tomatoes, carmelized red onions, basil, pizza sauce and fresh mozzarella!!  I may NEVER order another pizza again!!  It was as good, if not better than the kind we get at a local gourmet pizza shop!!  Thanks Jay!!

I'm soo glad I tried this recipe!  This is the first time I've been pleased with the way homemade pizza crust has turned out.  I made this in my bread machine on the dough cycle and had to add about 1/2 c. more flour; the dough was waaay too sticky otherwise.  As suggested by a previous reviewer, I added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp. onion powder to add some more flavor.  After taking it out of the machine, I divided it into two, let it rest a few min., then rolled it out, pricked it with a fork, and let it rest in the pans about 15 min.  I liberally oiled my deep dish baking stone and my cast iron skillet, baked the crust 10 min. on the bottom rack before adding the toppings and baking for an additional 15 min.  Turned out similar to Pizza Hut deep dish!  Yum!

This was super easy to make and work with. I was hesitant when I turn onto a floured surface and all the dough just stuck to my hands in huge globs But over a cup of flour later it was perfect. I topped with slices of "fast and friendly meatballs" from this site as well as caramelized onions. My husband and 3 children consumed this extra large pizza by themselves before I even got a slice. They did save me a small 1 inch by 1 inch square so I could rate it properly. it was excellent, no need to look any farther for crust.

I SO wish I could report the same great results as others. I followed the recipe exactly (even bought new yeast today), but after 60 minutes the dough had not risen at all. I'm not horribly experience with using yeast, but it seems if there was some perfect room temp. needed for the dough to rise, others would have mentioned it.   Looks like we're getting take-and-bake pizza tonight after all. Very disappointing.

Very good pizza crust.  I did put some olive oil and garlic on the crust before baking.  I also baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding the toppings to assure that the pizza crust would be completely cooked throughout.

This is without a doubt the best pizza crust i have ever made, it turned out absolutely PERFECT! I mixed the dough in my electric mixer, which turned out much easier and better than if i had kneaded it. I cooked the dough for 5-10 minutes before adding the toppings, since i made a thicker crust. I did as another user suggested and I used about 1/3 of the dough to make breadsticks, they were also delicious. I seasoned the dough with parmesan cheese, basil and garlic. I will without a doubt be using this recipe for now on!!

I needed to add quite a bit more flour, but it makes a great crust. I pre-bake it on a pizza pan (about 5 minutes), then take it out, add toppings, and slide it back into the oven, right on the rack. Works great!

I made this in the bread machine! Tip do not use warm water, just regular temp tap and cook on the dough cycle. Also since I didn't have a pizza stone, I let the pizza rise in the oven for 10 minutes at 170 degrees. I then cooked it at 425 for 10 mins. I then put all the toppings then cooked in oven again for 8 minutes. It was perfect! I did add some herbs to the crust (basil & Oregano) and I'll add more next time along with garlic. This is the best!

If you use a pizza stone to cook the pizza, preheat the stone in the oven for an hour. The heat contained in the stone will give the pizza a great crispy crust.   Coat the bottom of the crust with Yellow Corn Meal. It you put the pizza on the without it, it will not come off easily. Then slide the pizza off the stone after its done so it doesn't continue to bake the bottom.

This was a great pizza crust!  I let my bread machine do all the work and it turned out great.  I used the entire crust to make one pan style pizza.  It was very good.  We'll make again for sure!

This by far was the best crust I have ever made. I puffed up so big and my kids ate every last bite. The only suggestion I have would be to add some garlic to the crust but that is it!!!

Ok, this was good but I am not a baker and I know why-I just don't have the patience for dough to rise!!  I followed directions exact but didn't let the crusts rise again once we got them on the pans.  Made heart-shaped pizza for valentine's day-would make again, just when I have more time.

Back in the 50's we always made our own pizzas...out of a kit!  We even had pizza parties to make them!  I've tried to make pizza from scratch many times since but could never get the dough quite right.  Well, this one is perfect!  I think it's time for pizza parties again!

My first time making Pizza Crust.  I was amazed because me and dough don't get along.  It came out "the bomb diggity!!" I added herb and garlic to it the first time and the second time I made it as is.  Great both ways.  I bow to Ray for this recipe.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Just perfect. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. It was sooo easy to make too.  We made personal pizzas and they were delicious and they were a HUGE hit!  This is the best pizza dough recipe I have made before.  It was perfect all the way around; taste, crisp on the bottom, chewy on the inside.  I baked them for 10 min. then pulled them out and brushed them with melted butter that was mixed with a fresh pressed clove of garlic and then put on the sauce and toppings and baked another 10 min.  So good!!  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

This dough was great to work with once I added another cup of flour.  I've made it a few times at different times of year and I always end up adding more flour or decreasing the water regardless of humidity or temp.  Other than that, the flavor is nice and texture is wonderful for a home-made pizza that you'll be proud of!

Overall I was pretty impressed with this crust.  I used a metal slotted pizza pan to bake. It turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside just like other reviewers said.  It does give you a lot of dough though.  I think next time instead of 1 large thick crust pie, I will make 2 smaller thin ones.

THIS WAS AWESOME!!! I made 1 LARGE thin stuffed crust pizza (16 inches) and used "Pizza Without the Red Sauce" for half the pizza and "Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza" for the other half. I had a small ziploc bag of dough remaining so next time I'll try to use up all the dough to make the crust thicker.

Really good recipe.  Only complaint is how messy the adding flower part is.   Maybe more specific directions on how much is needed would help, but I guess that varies.  Crust tastes great. almost as good as delivery pizza.

This recipe tasted like dry, bland pie crust, and it needs way more flour before turning it out to knead. Definitely won't make this again. I'm surprised at the number of five star reviews.

The BEST EVER! If this doesn't come out for you, you are doing something wrong! This is the best pizza crust. I have been searching for a better crust for years and this one tops them all. I pre-baked mine for 10 minutes and then added my toppings. So yummy! Not doughy at all. Thanks so much Jay!!! A++++++

The crust was great and easy to make and will be the go to crust for us. However, the dough did not double in size when left to rise.   Other reviewers have said it make a great deep-dish crust for them but that was not my experience.   The crust was excellent but thin crust. I made 2 medium pies with it.  I am making it again tonight but will make a double batch and freeze half for another day.

This was my first pizza crust and It was very good in taste. I used this for thincrust pizza and It came out very very good. Everybody loved this crust and Enjoy pizza! One time I did add hot water in yeast and the dough was not so good. So whenever you add water in yeast do add luckwarm water not hot water. Otherwise your dough will not rise well. Thank you for a good recipe!

This is a great recipe.. 1 thing I changed was the dough needs to set for about 1 and a half hours.. Then spread it on sheets and let it rise another 30 minutes.. Other then that it is a great recipe.. 2 picky kids loved it..

Made this last night in my kitchenaid. I made a double batch and used one for each pizza. Turned out to be a very thick crust pizza but the taste was excellent-everyone loved it and made the pizza go alot further.Yum!

This recipe is great for anyone and you wont be dissapointed. After the first go around it was tasting as good as any delivery. I found it does take more flour than whats called for however. For the standard amount I probly added an addtional 2/3rds to 1 cup of flour.

Delicious crust and very easy to make.  I added italian seasoning, garlic powder and parmesean cheese to the flour.  I used a 16 inch pizza pan and there was enough crust to add string cheese for a stuffed crust.  I baked the crust about 10 min. prior to adding the toppings.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I will not buy store crust again.

I had the neighbors over for a pizza party and this crust went over great. Everyone agreed it was excellent even if it was extremely thick dough. I will probably roll it out more next time so that it wont be as thick.

This is the best pizza crust recipe I have ever tried, and I have tried alot, I make homemade pizza almost once or twice a week my family loves pizza.  This dough turned out soooo thick, it could have made two pizzas, but I don't have a large pan so maybe that was it.  It puffed up in the oven so perfectly and was crisp on the outside and doughy on the inside, just as the recipe said.  I used white sugar instead of brown sugar, and pretty much did everything else the same.  Next time I will add more salt and make two pizzas out of it.

DO NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY MAKING PIZZA CRUST!!!!!!!!! I am not an expert by far and was so nervous about making this pizza dough... I wish I had made more... It was SOOOOOOOOOOOO easy. I have a family of 2 adults and 3 kids and this was just enough for us, but I wish I had enough to freeze. I don't eat just any pizza, but wanted to try this for the family and I am so glad I did. For the sauce I made the Easy Pizza Sauce II from this site with extra seasonings and it was SUPER DELISH! Thank you so much Jay!

I have not used a different dough recipe once since finding this. It is amazing. 
Tonight I made homemade soup and tried this recipe to make bread sticks with it. I rolled out the dough in a rectangle, brushed it with egg wash, then sliced it into 8 inch by 1/4 inch thickness. I brushed the top with butter, basil and parmesan cheese, and baked them for 15 minutes. just as good as the pizza dough way! YUM! thanks Jay!

This is for people who like a denser crust. I added 1/4 c parmesan, italian seasoning, and garlic powder. I also brushed the crust with olive oil every 10 min. or so while baking. It makes one very large round pan and one 9" pie pan.

The taste and texture were great.  The only problem I had was that it rose quite a bit while cooking, which I wasn't expecting, so I ended up with a thick crust.  Not really a bad thing, but I usually prefer a thinner crust so next time I will split the dough in half to make two thin crust pizzas.

Fantastic pizza crust, brilliant combination of chewy inside and crusty outside. Easy to make. I'd give it four stars about the rising time, but I know good things comes to those who wait.

Chewy, crunchy and delicious. I used this as dough for calzones. They definitely did the job, but I think I'll go about adding more spices and cheese next time around.

Great crust! I needed 1/3 c. more flour than called for. Also, if you're using lots and lots of toppings, a pre-bake might be a good idea. Everyone loved this one and it was very easy.

I have made these pizza dough twice now and it turned out delicious both times! Very simple and easy to make even if you aren't a bread maker. Just make sure that the water isn't so hot that you kill the yeast...I did that twice.

This is the first recipe I have ever used yeast for, and it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  The crust came out great.  I made 4 smaller pizzas with it.  I ended up cooking them longer, at a slightly higher temperature - about 475 on a pizza stone, because we like them crispy.  I will never buy dough from the grocery store again!

This was the best crust I have ever had! It was easy and fast to make. I have tried to make homemade bread before and it never turns out good so I was a little worried about this but it was great. I cooked the dough before I put the toppings on so the crust was perfect.

I was so nervous about making pizza for the first time ever, but this recipe is so easy, and taste fantastic, I made it in the morning and then I placed it in the fridge to pull it out 1/2 before cooking and it turned out fantastic. The fridge really brought the flavor out of the crust! Next time I will try adding spices or Garlic in the crust! Oh i am so excited I found an A+++ recipe!

Better than the crusts we've been eating but still not Papa Johns.  I did try to stuff the crust with some cheese and will use bigger slices next time since we didn't really taste it. Perhaps try adding some parmasean cheese to the recipe as well.

I put it all in the bread machine and selected the dough setting, came out perfect, and so easy!  This is the best if you want a fluffy, chewy crust.  I used 2 1/3 c white flour and 1 c whole wheat.  We've tried a few crust recipes from allrecipes, and we think this is the best.

I loved the recipe! It was easy and tasted great! I have never made homemade pizza and was worried the crust would end up being too hard but this ended up soft and I will be using this recipe again.

Awesome.  I've been using a store bought mix for my pizza crust for the last couple years and my husband started asking for a completely homemade crust.  This recipie got two thumbs up.  It certainly takes more time, but if you're not in a hurry it's definitely worth it.  It was as close to authentic pizzeria pizza that I've ever come.

Soooo good.  In my oven I need to cook more like 20 to 25 minutes.  I did it the full 20 and still felt as though I should have gone longer.  Other than that...perfect!

Excellent excellent excellent.....First time I have ever made my own pizza dough.  Super easy,quick, and the taste is phenomenonal!  Made just one pizza so a little too thick but split into 2 next time and was perfect.  But if you leave it as one dough...perfect focaccia bread type dough.  Made a white garlic sauce the first time and topped with clams, fried bacon, green peppers and raw tomatoes.  Perfect!  2nd time made a red sauce and topped with sausage, green peppers, black olives and raw tomoatoes...perfection again!  So versatile! Thank you from the bottom of our stomachs...:)

I've never made pizza before. This was great!  Someone said they were tossing out their pizza menus...don't do that! :) Keep them to use for a guide for toppings on pizzas you usually order.

I have never made pizza dough from scratch, I usually use frozen dough from a local bakery.  I may never go back, this was easy, and made an excellent crust!  Thank you!!

As far as pizza crust goes, I usually have nothing but problems.  This recipe, however, turned out pretty good.  I wouldn't exactly compare it to pizza hut's pan pizza as some reviews say.  It's more of a hand-tossed style.  I took some advice and added italian seasonings to the dough and also brushed the crust with olive oil before baking.  I also prebaked for 10 mins.  I will definitely make this again, only I will be a bit more generous with the seasonings and probably brush the crust with butter instead.

Always turns out great.  The last time I made the recipe, was mixing up cake batter in a separate bowl while allowing the yeast to proof.  I accidentally dropped one egg white into the yeast mixture instead of the cake mix bowl.  Turned out to be the best dough batch to date.

This was described as "the best homemade pizza they've ever had" by my family.  Was very simple ad came out wonderful. I will be using this one again and again. I also added italian seasoning and garlic and onion powder to the yeast and oil mixture to season it.

Made this in the bread machine. Was a bit too sticky coming out so next time I'll definitely do it by hand. But it still tasted great! Made no changes to it. Had a really nice texture, very soft in the middle and just the right amount of crisp around the edges.

Best.Crust.Ever!  I needed two pizza crusts and so I doubled the recipe. 

My changes: (1) substituted 2 cups white flour for whole wheat flour. (2) For knead I used bread maker, because I'm lazy like that.  BONUS: Be sure and give a generous edge crust on your pizza! Then keep the honey on the table and the kids (and you!) can eat the crust w/ honey for dessert! Seriously - its that good!

The first time I made this recipe, it was a disaster.  My pizza cooked unevenly, and half of it rose about 2 inches higher than the other (raw) side.  I gave it a second try today with an important change (for me anyways), and wow!  It's perfect!  Instead of dry active yeast, I used instant yeast.  I melted the sugar in hot water, mixed in the salt and oil, and then added a mixture of the yeast and flour.  It came out beautifully!

I thought this pizza dough made a phenomonal crust! I too added seasonings and parmesan cheese to my dough. I smeared this crust with 'Exquisite Pizza Sauce' from this website and I had a winning recipe combo. I made the dough a day in advance, divided it into 2 portions, applied a thin coating of olive oil to keep the dough from drying out and getting sticky, and finally wrapped the 2 discs in plastic wrap. Just let the dough come to room temp before patting it down and stretching it out- it makes it so much easier to handle. I baked my crusts ( I made 2 smaller pizzas) in perforated pizza pans on the bottom rack at 500 degrees for 8 min., then turned down the temp to 425 degrees and baked for 8 more min. I chose to brush some melted garlic butter on the edges of the crusts after they baked- IDK, just an idea I got from a pizzeria. It was crusty on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. My guinea pig wants another homemade pizza for his upcoming b-day. Thanks, Jay! * If adding greenery such as parsley, basil, spinach, ect. I highly recommend placing these topping directly on the sauce then covering with cheese and other toppings. The first pizza I made had crispy spinach with charred edges. Go 'head and giggle! :P

Excellent recipe and it makes a huge 16" crust that is 1 1/2 inches all the way around the outer edge. I convection baked a pizza at 425 degrees for exactly 15 minutes and it was perfectly cooked.  I think this could be split into two thinner crusts and will probably try that next time.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I have tried many pizza crusts and none of them worked.  I decided to try this one because of all the good reviews.  This pizza dough is fabulous!  It's basically fool proof.  I have allowed this dough to sit in the fridge for 2 days before baking and I have made it last minute and either way, it comes out perfect!  I like to cook my pizzas in a pan on the outdoor grill.  The pizza crust comes out crunchy on the outside,  fully cooked and nice and  "fluffy" on the inside.  You can't mess it up!
I like to put fresh mozzarella and good canned tomatoes on my pizzas like I had them when we visited NYC. 
TIP: Precook crust 2-5 minutes before final cooking with toppings.
Thank you, Jay, for a great crust recipe!

great pizza crust!! So yummy. The recipe makes about 2 pizza's for us. I tastes like deep dish pizza. We don't order out anymore since we found this recipe. The dough is way better than any chain pizza place.

I used this to make the BBQ Chicken Calzones from this site and it worked perfectly. For some reason though, it took almost 1cup more of flour before it wasn't just a big glob! Could've been my temp/humidity in my kithen though. It did make 2 normal size pizza crusts, so 2 huge calzones! I can't wait to try this with regular pizza toppings! Thanks for the great pizza crust!

This is the best pizza crust I've ever made! I used my KitchenAid so it was incredibly easy. Use metal pizza pans if you like crispy crust & Plan on 30 minutes baking time.

This recipe is awesome! It is dairy-free and very versatile!  I've used this with extra flour and rolled out thinly for a crispy, thin crust.  I've also made it hand tossed style and deep dish! 

So good- and after we've ordered pizza lately I've wished I had just made this because it is just better!

This is an awesome recipe.

One word of advice: If you substitute whole wheat flour, use Gold Medal Stone Ground Whole Wheat. Don't use Hodgson Mill Brand.  The difference is like night and day.  For some reason the Hodgson Mill flour creates a very terrible (lumpy and brittle) dough but Goal Medal makes a great (smooth and elastic) dough.  I've tried them both several times.

An old staple at our house now. Easy to make in the Kitchen Aid and makes plenty of dough to feed our family of four. Usually makes two good sized pizzas or three "medium" sized. It will rise, so don't roll it out too thick unless you want a thicker crust.

Followed directions for the most part.
Added some rosemary and other spices to the dough though. Smelled fantastic.
I found that it actually rose too much when baked in the cast iron pan I was using. I would probably use less next time perhaps. It was pretty good though.

Tonight I made homemade pizzas for the family using this recipe.  I normally buy the premade pie shells simply for the convenience.  Following the directions to the letter, it made enough dough for 2 large thin crust pizzas.  I prebaked the crusts for 4 minutes each at 425 as others suggested before adding toppings.  Perfect for our family of 5.  Next time, I'll add italian seasonings and try making cheesy breadsticks.  Thanks for sharing this one Jay!

I used whole wheat flour, and brushed the crust with garlic butter before taking the pizza out of the oven. Next time we'll choose different toppings. I made stuffed crust, and my husband didn't like how thick the crust was, but that's his problem. I thought it was pretty good!

LOVED IT!  I let the bread machine do the work on this.  I upped the brown sugar to 1 TBSP. and upped the salt to
1 1/2 tsp. For the olive oil, I used bruschetta flavored.   This made two good sized pizzas!  I will be using this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing!

I really like this recipe and have made it a few times.  I add grated parmesan or asiago cheese to the dough, along with garlic powder, and rosemary.  It makes the house smell so good while rising.  I like to press it into the bottom of my perforated pizza pan and brush with olive oil, then bake till very light golden.  We roast sliced tomatoes brushed with olive oil and basil, put them on the crust, top with roasted chicken, and top wtih ALOT of mozzarella! The kids and everyone else loves this pizza!!   Thank YOu!!

This pizza crust is incredible. Everyone loved it. The dough was really sticky so I kept on adding flour, but it didn't really help and I thought maybe I was adding to much flour and it would ruin the dough, so I left it sticky and smeared oil on the top before I let it rise. It was very hard to work with but it tasted great!

I might never buy pizza dough from the grocery store again!  This was very easy and delicious.  I used a mix of organic whole wheat and white flour, added some parm cheese and this came out perfect!!  So much better for you than pizza hut or many others like it.  I am using this recipe again tonight, this time I'm adding some seasonings like basil and oregano.....YUM

This was my second attempt at making homemade crust and it was very good!  It really made a pretty pizza, I didn't want to cut into it!  I used Easy Pizza Sauce III (with some tweaking) and topped it with 4 C shredded mozzerella, pepperoni and sauted sausage and onion.  Worth the effort!

Mmmmm......This is really good, despite all the trouble I had making it because of pans. The first time I used a pizza pan with holes,crust came out too crispy but the taste was fabulous, then I bought some deep dish pizza pans, crust too thick, more like bread, but the taste was excellent. Hopefully I will get my crust shaping right one day, now that I bought new pans just for making pizza! Try it!

Awesome crust!  I hate using yeast because it usually takes me a few tries to get it to proof.  Three tries this time but it was totally worth it.  It looked so good and was nice and thick.  That said, there are a few changes I plan on making next time.  1. Will use heavier toppings.  I used Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza from this site and it's just too light for a crust this thick.  2.  Will prebake for 5 minutes so that it gets a little crisper on the bottom.  3. Brush the edges with butter and sprinkle with garlic salt.  4.  Spray the bottom of the pizza pan with Pam.   Great this time, but I think it'll blow us away next time.  Thanks!

This crust rocks!  I did change it just a little...I use about 1 1/3 c of wheat flour along with the white flour and I also added garlic powder and oregano.  This is so easy and quick to throw together that I don't even order Dominos anymore!  Thanks Jay!

I thought this dough was extremely sticky and had to add more flour than the recipe called for.  The recipe made a HUGE crust and next time I will divide it between 2 pans.

I love oredering take out pizza, it is the one time I don't have to cook.  But I wanted to use some leftovers to make a philly cheese steak pizza and I used this crust.  It was so good, I might be tempted to forego takeout.  I used 1/2 spelt flour, to make it more nutritious.  The additions of spices to the dough would be phenomenal.

Made this about 25 times in the past 6 months.

I like to sprinkle garlic salt both on the bottom of the pan, and on top of the crust. ^____^

I'm trying to avoid high glycemic foods, so I subbed one cup white flour for stone ground wheat and used raisins in warm water, with a tsp of honey (blenderized) in place of the brown sugar.  I ran out of time and so after the first rise I put the dough in the fridge and came back to it about five hours later (tres convenient).  This was a tasty, tender dough, next time I will do a slow rise, overnight in the fridge, since I think that makes the dough chewier.

Very good.  I did make some changes, and it was still very good.  I used a bread machine, mixing the water, brown sugar, salt, and oil in the bottom first, and then putting flour and yeast on top.  I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and 2 1/3 cups of white flour.  It made for a very filling nice thick crust with a little bit of crunch but very soft on the inside!

Very good!!!  I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp italian seasoning at the same time that I added the salt.  I then mixed it in my bread machine.  I will definitely make again!!
*Second time making this I turned it into breadsticks.  I added 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 Tbsp of italian seasoning.  Then baked for a couple minutes, removed them from the oven and pre-cut them, sprinkled with approx 1/2 cup of fresh parmesan and then baked again for another 7-10 minutes.  Once they were done, I brushed them with garlic butter.  They were delicious!

This recipe was great... I ended up making two pizzas with it (thin crust).  It tasted a lot like Pizza Hut pizza crust... when I rolled it out, I used self-rising cornmeal instead of flour to acheive that "restaurant" taste.  Turned out to be probably the best pizzas I've ever made!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Muy delicioso! I used bread flour instead of all-purpose and it came out great! I also found that leaving the dough overnight helped to give it that pizzeria dough taste. Sprinkled some cornmeal on the bottom before baking and call it a day! I agree with the other members about leaving the dough to cook a little first before adding the toppings and maybe poking some holes on the dough beforehand to keep bubbles from forming. Also, I didn't know this the first time I used yeast but be sure to follow the instructions as far as the water/liquid temperature---that way the yeast can activate and give the dough that fantastic rise! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Nice recipe. If you don't have a pizza stone, sprinkle cornmeal over your pizza pan. This helps make a nice crust -- and no sticking. UPDATE: I had leftover dough in my refrigerator. Then, my nephew & I had a brain storm today (he's 6). We scooped out the dough, using a standard ice-cream scoop. We then rolled the dough into a ball, floured the ball, and then flattened it in a floured tortilla press. This made great little pizzas for lunch. And he loved pressing the dough and applying the toppings to the crust.

This is one of my family's favorite. We  make them into small breadsticks.  Using fast rising yeast, let it sit for ten minutes after kneading (should rise a little) and then shape into breadsticks.  Brush with melted butter, parmesan and garlic pepper.  Let them rise for about 20 minutes then cook for 14 minutes at 250 degrees.  Delicious!!

I added Italian seasoning to the dough, cooked it on a pizza stone and it turned out great. We use this recipe to make pepperoni bread w/ a layer of fresh spinach & mushroom - sooo good.

I have been using this recipe forever! It is by far the best pizza crust I've ever made. This is the only recipe I use when making pizza and my entire family (kids included) absolutely LOVE this. One more note: In all the time I have been using this recipe (more times than I can count), it has never failed. It's been wonderful each and every time.

EXCELLENT!  Wonderful to work with this dough.  PERFECT crust - you can modify to thick or thin, depending on your preference.

Easy to make and work with!  The flavor was OK but not really anything special.  I think next time I will sub honey for the sugar and see how that does.  I made two pizzas with this.  One thing we did was to prebake one crust before adding sauce and the other one we just added sauce before baking.  We preferred the one that was not prebaked - The crust was moist under the sauce and crispy on the bottom.  The prebaked one was more like a cracker all they way through.  Of course the dough was very thin to begin with because of making 2 pizzas with one recipe.  We are thin crust people.  Will use again!   Thanks

Very good. I did however, add the extra spices as suggested by others and I'm glad I did. It needed the extra flavor for our taste. Also, as a little bonus, I rolled mozzarella string cheese sticks to the edge of the dough(like pizza hut's stuffed crust pizza), and brushed the edges with olive oil for a crisp crust. My family gave it two thumbs way up!

Turned out great!  I followed the recommendations to create two pizzas, however next time I think I'll just make one pizza.  When I split the dough it made two very small pizzas.  I guess it just depends on the size of your pan(s).

It's a nice pizza crust and pretty simple instructions that are easy to follow. I made into two rectangular pizzas that are about A4-size each. But the crust was still quite thick so I think I'll divide it into three the next time. The kneading takes quite a bit of work but it totally worth it and definitely better than frozen crusts.

tasted good, but a tad yeasty. I'm thinking next time I might had a few seasonings to it. 
definitely makes two crusts (or one very thick crust).

With almost 1200 reviews, I figured I would try it.  Made pizza last night with my 8yr old and it came out great. I brushed the crust with a little butter after baking and it kept it chewy and nice. Only alteration to the recipe is that i subbed 1/3 of the white flour with wheat and added about 2 TBL of 10-grain cereal (milled, of course) for extra fiber. Oh and I also coated the pan w/olive oil and sprinkled w/ just a little corn meal. Will def make again.

This recipe was easy to make.  I don't know what I did wrong; however, it came out heavy and a little chewy.  Since it has gotten lots of rave reviews, it must have been something that I did.  I thought I followed the recipe to the letter.

This made an awesoem crust...highly recomended!!! I did make a few changes, i didn't have any olive oil so I used butter and I added 2 tsp of milk powder( makes it softer). I made the dough in the bread machine then let it rise in the pans till my husband got home to eat. I would definatly recommend cooking the crust for at least 5 minutes or so before adding the topping. The dough was a bit too soft in the center. I will be making this again and adding it to my recipe box...Thanks:)

This was so good we have decided to start home-made-pizza-Friday at our house. No more calling out for pizza. My husband and I both like a bit of sweetness to our crust, so we're going to try adding a bit of honey to the dough next time.

This is the best pizza dough recipe I've found.  I mix in fennel seed and black pepper and sometimes make it a stuffed crust by rolling strips of mozzarella around the crust.

This recipe is very simple but makes a fantastic crust.

But more important to me, is that it makes a wonderful loaf of bread!  Just make as directed, and instead of rolling out, just shape it into a tight ball and place on a cookie sheet or pizza stone.

I use this recipe for more than just pizza crust. I Add a little mixture of olive oil, herbs, and garlic into the dough once it has raised and I shape it into bread sticks. I top them with melted butter and coarse salt. YUMMMY!!!!!!!!! Everyone asks for this recipe.

Great recipe!!!  Since I tried this one I haven't gone back to any other recipe.  My friends really like.  I use  my KitchenAid to make the dough and it's so easy!  And bake on a stone for a crispy outside.

Great Pizza Crust!  I used unbleached all-purpose flour.  I used a pizza stone.  I also cut the dough in half after the rise to make two smaller pizzas.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because it does have a wonderful texture and turns out great everytime! That said, the amount of flour is not very accurate, and to make it flavorful you do need to tweak the recipe a bit. I liked it the way it was, but I probably wouldn't have kept making it, if it wasn't for some of the suggestions in the reviews. If it doesn't turn out right the first time, read the other reviews and make some adjustments to get the best pizza crust ever. This is the only recipe I use now...with my adjustments ;)

I'm not much for homemade pizza.  I tried this crust recipe and LOVE IT.  It is the closest I've come to a pizzaria style pizza made at home.  Of course... I made it on a high quality pizza stone.  I think that makes a big difference as well!!  The only thing I added was some Italian seasoning.  If you're looking for a really easy crust with amazing taste... this is your recipe!!

This was fabulous!  I added a tsp each of garlic powder, oregano and basil to the dough and baked it about 10 mins before adding the toppings.  Smelled so good could have just kept baking it and eaten it as it was!  The only thing was I added almost another cup of flour as was very sticky and then I guess I kneaded it too much as was very springy and wouldn't stay put on the sheet pan; kept springing back to the centre.  Finally convinced it to stay stretched out in the end tho.  Will definitely be making pizza and bread sticks and whatever else I can think up with this!  Thanks Jay!!

AWESOME recipe!  Had the same consistency of Pizza Hut's pan pizza crust.  The recipe yeilded too much dough for one huge pizza for the size of our pizza stone, and ours is a standard size.  We had to make two smaller pizzas.  We made pizza for two, and next time we're going to use half of the dough for a pizza, and half of the dough for garlic breadsticks.

Amazing! This was my first ever pizza crust and it turned out really well. No more mediocre frozen crusts for me!  

I need to use a bit more flour than called for to make it not sticky (maybe 1/3 c. more).  I used about 1 c. of whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose.  Makes two medium sized crusts or one gigantic crust.

This has been the greatest pizza crust recipe that I have tried yet.  I have made it several times for my family, and it has turned out great each time.  I have not had to pre-bake teh crust or anything.  It turned out think and crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Wonderful!

I followed the recipe exactly. We liked this. It was missing something in the flavor but I'm not sure what. I'm going to keep looking for a pizza crust recipe but this will be a good backup if I can't find what I want.

This makes the best pizza dough I've ever tasted!  The kids beg to have a regular weekly homemade pizza night!  My daughters friend was here for dinner and has raved to her whole family and now her mom wants the recipe.  I add garlic powder and pizza seasoning to the flour and it turns out wonderful everytime!

I added about a tablespoon of fresh rosemary to this, and it was AWESOME.  Per other reviewers I rolled it out using cornmeal to give it more of a resteraunt taste.

Additional Note - I have now made this two times in one week, that should give you an idea of how good it is.  I am using a Publix Brand Spaghettis sauce called Parmesean and Romano to make pepperoni pizza with fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil.  Fantastic!!!

This crust turns out fantastic no matter what is on it!  I've made it both using all all-purpose flour, and replacing 1c all-purpose flour with whole wheat, and it still turned out fantastic.

Outstanding results every time. This recipe doubles well (tripled it once and it was still fine). Also, you can add custom flavorings (garlic, spice) without sacrificing the texture or the taste.

Great crust, but it didn't really turn out like a pan pizza for me.  More thin and crispy, and soft on the inside.  I pre-baked the crust for 10-15 minutes.  Nice!

Used a pizza stone. Very good but a little bit time consuming with the hour wait. Healthier than the store bought pizza dough packets and frozen pizzas by far. Rose very nicely. Kept shape very well (didn't spring back). I used white sugar instead of brown and added 1 tsp of garlic powder to dough. Cook dough for at least 5-10 minutes before adding topping and cook in bottom shelf.  Nice easy recipe.

Fair is fair.  I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and have not rated it.  It has become our families signature pizza crust.  Easy to make, makes excellent pizza and is easy to work with.  Recently I have been adding one to two cups of freshly ground whole wheat (in place of some of the white flour) and it turns out great.  Thank you for the recipe my family loves it!

I've tried pizza doughs without any luck until today.  For those of you who are curious this dough turns out a little less thick than Pizza Hut's and less greasy.  I did a couple of things differently after reading many reviews.  I let it rise 45 minutes after kneading. I greased the pans with butter and molded the dough into the pizza pans.  Let it stand another 30 minutes or so.  Finally, I added the ingredients and baked in the oven as directed.  I doubled the recipe because we are family of six and got 2 x 16" and two 8" pizzas.  I also doubled the sugar and salt and the dough turned out with a really good flavour.  The crust was crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.  It was just perfect.  We did a cheese only one for the kids and one with the works.  The more ingredients you put the wetter the crust so keep that in mind.  Also, one very good suggestion from another reviewer was to bake in the bottom rack this way the dough will cook without burning the cheese and other toppings.  Thanks Jay!

Ohhh my gosh!  This recipe was great!  My kids faught over the last piece!  Even my pickiest pizza critic thought this was as good as Pizza Hut!  I did add some italian spices and garlic powder to the flour before making it a dough and I doubled the recipe and made two large pizzas...one for the kids and one for my husband and I.  The kids ate a whole large pizza between the four of them!  I will definitely make it again!  Thanks bunches...

great crust.  loved the texture and how easy it was to work with the dough.  it needs some seasoning though we're going to try to mix some garlic and herb in next time and i think it will be great.  much better than store bought crust mix!

I gave this 4 stars because my husband loved it, however my son and I were not really thrilled with it.  It is nothing like pizza shop crust, which is what I was looking for.  I did add some spice the the dough, per other reviewers {garlic powder, basil, oregano, and parmesan cheese} and mixed the dough in my bread machine.  It came out extremely sticky and I had to add more flour at that point and knead it.  It just didn't have much taste to it and got very crispy, although the crispiness might have been my pan.  Since hubby loved it, I will likely try it again, but I will also continue searching for other recipes.

This crust was great-it rose wonderfully and was delicious.  I did add some spice to the dough to give it an extra kick as suggested by other reviews.  This is so easy; I will certainly use this from now on-I am going to try using this recipe with whole wheat flour for a more healthy approach.  Thanks Jason for sharing your recipe.

I didn't quite expect it to come out so thick, but that was all right. This was the first time I made pizza crust where I didn't make a huge mess-- I don't know if it was the recipe or I'm just getting better, but that made the crust SEEM better, ha. Topped it with BBQ sauce, buffalo chicken strips and monteray jack cheese and it was perfect. I'll use this recipe again, as I like that I don't have to have bread flour on hand.

Cooks crisp on the outside but a little underdone near the sauce.  Otherwise very good.  I recommend lowering the temperature and baking on the top rack.

I do this in the bread machine and it comes out so perfect and so easy.  I have to use more like 4 c of flour but if I do I can take it out, divide it into 2 balls.  Let those rest 10 min and then roll them right out nicely.

This was very good, but I had to add more flour and it turned out a bit heavy.  I may go back to my old recipe. It could have been something I did wrong...but I would lower the water to 1 cup next time.

This dough was very easy to make and had a nice flavor but it took way more flour than the recipe called for and was hard to roll out into a circle, kept pulling back in. The flavor was excellent though. I took another reviewers advice and added some oregano and parmesan cheese. I made a smaller batch and made breadsticks out of them, they turned out pretty well also.

Just got done making pizza for our 9 year olds birthday dinner. This crust was very easy to make. Just throw everything in the kichen aid. It did take more than 31/2 cups of flour but it is humid today. The whole family loved the crust. This recipe is a "keeper" for us!

I guess some people are just really easy to please, and I must not be one of them.  Either way this was a disappointing pizza crust!!!  It was not at all chewy.  It was like eating flavorless flat bread with pizza toppings.  I rolled this dough into 9 single serving pizzas and it was still "bready" in texture.  Nobody at our gathering even finished their pizza-- good thing my salad was tasty.

This crust is definitely fantastic!  I love thick crust pizza so I only made one crust with this recipe.  It was not heavy or greasy tasting but still very filling.  My entire family ate it and loved it.  We have found the crust for us!  Thank you Jason!

Incredible crust! I will definitely be making this again and again. The whole pizza was good, but the crust made it wonderful. Even my kids ate the crust on the edge, when normally they tend to leave it on their plates. Thank you for a great recipe.

Pretty good stuff! It made enough dough for 2 large pizzas, I like that because I can tailor a pizza to the kids' tastes and the other to 'adult' tastes. The kids loved this crust, we enjoyed it but I thought it was a bit chewy, doughy. I prefer a thinner, crisper crust.

I have been searching for years for a good pizza crust recipe.  The search is finally over!!!  This crust was awesome!!!  
I initially mixed the dough in my stand mixer until it formed a ball.  I then kneaded the dough.  I had to use 1 1/2 cups more flour than listed.
I made a pepperoni roll and a pierogi roll with the dough.  I baked them at 375 for 30 minutes and they turned out GREAT!!!
THis recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out really well! I used some of the dough to make garlic bread sticks and they were yummy too! I did prebake my crust for about 8 minutes, I like my crust really well done. Thanks for sharing!

I made this tonight.  My kids helped.  It was super easy.  I made 2 large pizzas.  I did not roll them...I patted them thin in the center with a thicker crust.  Baked them at 425 for about 15 minutes.  Wonderful crust.  Next time, I may add a little something to the outside of the crust.  My kids even ate the crust.

I have made this crust at least three times now, and it is wonderful!  I use whole wheat flour and the taste and texture are great.  I really do recommend letting the dough rise a second time before putting on the toppings.  The dough gets nice and fluffy that way.  Awesome recipe!

I rolled the crust out to what I thought was thin enough to turn out the thickness of a hand tossed pizza.  However the crust rose into the thickness of a pan pizza.  For those of you who are going for a thinner crust make sure you roll very thin.  Great recipe though.

My first time making my own pizza, and was not dissappointed.  The preparation time was a little intensive, more than I would have thought.  But it was SOO worth it when I sat down to enjoy this!!  Will make again soon.

This was a good crust.  It was my first attmpt at making one.  It was easy.  I thought that it was a little too "bready" though. I may make it again.  And use a larger pan to see if that helps.

Wow! Never made dough before,but I noticed this gets easier each time I use this recipe. After the 2 1/2 cups of flour gets used to form the dough, I pretty much don't keep track of how much more flour I add to it. I just use enough for the dough not too be sticky anymore. I've used this not only for pizza, for calzones and breadsticks. Thanks Jay.

I have made this twice, and it is foolproof!  I did add some Johnny's garlic seasoning to the second batch, and it was over the top!  I found 15 minutes in 400 degree convection ove is perfect.  No more looking, everyone agrees, this is a winner!!  Thank you for sharing.

I had to let the dough rest in the bowl for a few hours and I made two batches. I read all the other reviewers comments and thought that if I just left the dough as is and rolled it out it would be a thick crust. So, I rolled it out with a floured roller until it reached a thickness that I thought would not puff up too much. I did have excess which I froze. I didn't let it rise in the pan but immediately put the topping on and cooked it. It didn't rise, except for the edges which puffed a tiny bit. So because my dh likes a thin crust I did this to the 2nd batch as well. So, I wish I would have let it rise in the pan for the first pizza which was my favourite. I also added onion powder and garlic powder to the mix.

I had never made my own pizza crust until I tried this.  The recipe was so easy to follow, and the pizza crust came out flawless.  Thank you for an excellent recipe that I will use again and again!

What am I doing wrong??  I tried this recipe twice and each time I end up with beautiful edges and a soggy bottom.  Maybe I should do as some suggested and prebake for 10 minutes before topping.  I may give it one more shot.

I have been making this pizza dough for over 12 years now and it always turns out.  I always get rave reviews from everyone who tries it.  I  make the dough hours before I need it and let it rise longer in the bowl.  Once I roll it out and place it on the pan I stick it in the oven and I turn on the bread proof feature and let it rise for just under an hour.  I find that I get a thicker crust when I do this.  Lately I've been using half all purpose and half whole wheat flour and it works great and gives it a nice taste.  Best dough ever!

I had such high hopes for this based on recent reviews and popularity.  While making the dough, I had to add much more than the 3 1/3 cups flour but kept telling myself that all flours vary.  While proofing, I then came back and read reviews and realized I was not alone in the flour issue.  Others also stated it needed more salt and sugar.  I did prebake the crust (made sicilian style on a large cookie sheet since I only had 1 round pan)  I again took advice and prebaked the crust for 10 minutes brushed with EVO and some garlic powder and herbs and added feta, spinach, calamata olives, mozzarella, romano, and parmesan shredded.  Had some roasted red peppers so threw a few of those on.  With the toppings it was okay but it is not a chewy crust...more like italian bread.  It is a rather bland crust.  I didn't have the sticking to the pan problem, threw cornmeal down...can't beat it; acts like little ball bearings.  I am glad I tried but needs too much tweaking so would rather search for another.

Great recipe!  I'll be using this every time from now on.  My husband commented on how "puffy" the crust was.  Meaning - it wasn't flat like the store bought ones we usually use.  It does make a large amount of dough so my pizza was "puffier" than it normally would be.  I used it all for one pizza since we wouldn't eat two.  But it baked beautifully even as thick as it was.

This was my first attempt at home-made pizza crust.  It was fantastic!  Easy recipe and delicious results.  I did have best results when I extended the second rise to 20-30 mins.  Really light crust - crispy on outside, soft and chewy inside.  I doubt I'll be buying frozen pizza much anymore!

i have never baked anything before, this was my first time, and it came out great!  i did everything as the recipe said, and the hint section was very useful as well.    it was exellent - my guests loved it!
i made one thick crust 16" pizza, and next time i will try to do two thin crust ones, because there is plenty of dough for that.

Excellant, to make it crispier i made it thinner and baked it seperately for 7 minutes...For more flavor I added garlic, oregano and basil...The recipe is best summed up as "YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!

Excellent pizza crust recipe.  I also sprinkle the crust with Italian seasoning but I also add a good sprinkle of California garlic powder before putting the toppings on.  Since I use a stone to bake the pizza, I don't pre-bake the crust.  I do cut the recipe in half which makes one thin crust 16" pizza.  YUMMY!!

PERFECT Pizza crust recipe1  It was crispy on the outised, yet still chewy with an excellent flavor! I'll be using this recipe over an over and over!  My boyfriend said it was, by far, the best pizza he'd ever had!  I oiled my pans with olive oil and sprinkled them with a little cornmeal first and also prebaked the crust for 10 minutes..then put the toppings on and baked for another 10 minutes....turned out perfectly!

good crust.  Baked on a stone but my toppings were getting really browned before the dough was ready.  May try to prebake the dough for about 10 min. then top and bake again.

Amazing! I split the dough (after it rose) into four portions to make 4 thin-crust style grilled pizzas. I punched down each portion separately. Caution: if you do the same, refridgerate the dough ASAP. I forgot to put the individual plastic bags containing the extra dough portions into the fridge, and had to repackage b/c the dough rose again and busted the bags' seams!! Also, the dough could use a bit more salt, but not sure how to adjust without messing up the rising process. Any suggestions?

Great crust!  I made two pizzas with the dough.  The dough puffed up really nicely in the oven.  I loved it.

This is the only pizza dough recipe for me!!!  Can't be beat.  I tossed everything in the bread machine on dough cycle and made it even easier, but I had to add a little extra flour.

This came out awesome!  I used about half of it and made it in my 12 inch cast iron pan.  I also spread the dough with garlic butter before adding other ingredients and baked it on the lower rack of the oven.

I recently made a pizza dough from a pizzeria website, and it was awful. I vowed never again - but out of curiosity, I thought I'd give this recipe a go. I am not the best cook, in fact I can't even make roast potatoes I am that bad. I followed the instructions by the book (halved the quantities as I didn't have enough flour), loaded it up with sauce and veggies - no cheese as I'm trying to give it up and I havent got any lying around. Anyway, I have just taken it out of the oven (just used a normal oven tray as I don't have a pizza stone) and hey - its fantastic!!! Really, really nice  - great texture - light and fluffy yet crispy. I will definetly be making this again. Thankyou Jason, you deserve a great big kiss !!

This is truley excellent! If you are making these in pans, I def recomend letting the dough rise for an extra 20 mins in the pan, before toping with sauce. Throw in some herbs into the dough before the final kneed, this will give it a tasty zing! Well Done! This is the best, Thank you Jason Sharp!

Wow!  Seriously, one of the best pizza crusts I have ever had--my new favorite.  I made roughly a 13-14" pizza with this in combination with a sauce recipe called "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" on this very site.  Cooked for right around 16 minutes (very old oven, and tends to be inconsistent) and the crust turned out absolutely perfect; very thick, soft crust--like deep dish style.  Worth every second of the prep time involved...

Also, we made this on a pizza stone, and we did NOT preheat the stone first.  I rounded-out the dough on the stone itself, topped it off and put it directly in the preheated oven--16 minutes later, it was perfect.

One more thing: careful not to over-eat with this recipe.  This crust will expand in your stomach and make you miserable if you're not careful...  ;)

Very simple and good recipe! I did have to tweak the amount of flour to get the texture I like. I baked it strait on the oven rack to get it crispy then I just added olive oil, cheese, tomatoes, and fresh herbs.

I don't know what happened . . . I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The dough was so STICKY; I couldn't get it off my hands!  I had to add so much flour (over a cup) in an attempt to knead it.  I worked with it the best I could, but ended up tossing it without even baking it.  The recipe ooked good (so did all the 5 star reviews).  I'm stumped as to what went wrong.

This is a fantastic and simple recipe.  I make is often for my family.  FOr us, it makes two pizza crusts as my husband prefers his crust not to be too thick.  I add some basil, garlic, oregano, etc. to the dough.  I have also made calzones with this dough and they turn out well. Thanks for this recipe!

Absolutely THE best pizza crust ever.  I use the dough cycle on my bread machine and add a little extra flour.  We love this recipe at our house.  This dough also freezes very well.

I really like this pizza crust recipe. I used to purchase pre-baked crusts but was looking for a healthier option and decided to try making my own. One recipe I tried (not on this site) didn't work at all.  I've made this one 3 times since, and it's been great every time.  The flavor is kind of bland tasted alone but I find the taste to be very good with pizza toppings.  I even ran out of flour once and used about half whole wheat, and it tasted even better like that.  I like to use the amount needed for the pizza I'm making that day and freeze the rest in individual sizes so I can make a quick pizza anytime I want it.

Excellent!!  I have never made pizza dough before last night.  I saw this recipe a while back and saved it to my recipe box and last night I made it for dinner.  It was very easy and fun to make.  After the dough rose and was ready to be rolled I just put the ball on my pizza pan and spread it out with my hands.  My husband liked it very much he said it filled him up with only 2 pieces, my 2 year old son ate one whole piece and is currently working on a left over piece for his lunch, my 11 year old sister said it was the best pizza she's ever had, and I couldn't agree more with all of them.  Thanks allrecipes I LOVE this site!

This was sooooo yummy! My husband and I have made this twice.  I used a pampered chef rectangular pizza stone and it made a nice crust...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I did pre-bake the crust about 10 minutes before I added the toppings.  Made the crust with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce found on this site as well.

It comes out perfect every time.  People ask me for the recipe all the time.  I add a little italien seasoning to give an extra boost.

GREAT!! This pizza crust was so wonderful! I had never made homemade pizza crust before- and I made this last night for dinner- my whole family was so happy- my boyfriend LOVED it- he even wanted to take it for his lunch today. I will never go back to buying store bought pizza crust again. Try this recipe- believe me- it's so easy to make and taste so good. This crust is ranked so high for a reason.

Wow! I've never made pizza crust from scratch before, but it turned out Great! I 1/2ed the recipe. And it was the perfect size, about a medium large. I did think it might need just a little more salt add. Plus, if you use a baking sheet/etc. make sure you cook it on your bottom rack of your oven. Also let it cook about 8-9 minutes before putting on your toppings.

I have been a cook for many year and this recipes was not worth making again. It had no flavour and did not rise, Would not make again. Frozen dough is better,

I've finally found a pizza dough recipe I like!  I kept the recipe as it was, except I kneaded in some pizza seasoning into the crust, as well as about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of cornmeal.  I think that the cornmeal really helped produce a yummy crisp crust.  And this made enough dough (with a litte left over) for a 9 x 11 sheet pan.  Thanks Jay!

Pretty good, but needed flavor, so I kneaded in some pressed garlic, garlic and onion powder, and oregano to spice it up.  If you're not using a pizza stone, I wouldn't pre-bake the crust first, as it rises and makes it hard to get the sauce to stay on the crust.

Speaking from a dough novice point of view, five stars is not enough for this recipe!  I consider myself a pizza connoisseur, and this crust rivals the best pizzeria crusts I have enjoyed.  I added four teaspoons of vital wheat gluten hoping to make the dough more elastic and chewy as I was afraid that the little kneading that the dough required would turn out a flat hard pizza.  I do not know if my addition made this crust chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside or if it was just the original recipe.  I will make this again and again.  Already planning on making calzone with it today.  Many thanks to the originator of this recipe.

Very good. I reccomend pre-baking for about 8 minutes before you put the toppings on. Ensure a crispy crust!

This recipe makes a very fresh-tasting, delicious crust.  It tastes much like Little Caesar's Pizza crust, just better.  I have a huge 22" pizza pan, and it takes about 3/4 of the dough.  I use the rest by filling the bottom of a pie pan with the extra dough, adding ton of melted butter and brown sugar, and sprinkling on a bit of cinnamon.

Like most people who wrote reviews I cut the dough in half and froze it and used it days later and it was still great. I did however make a few adjustments...I used half all purpose flour and half all wheat flour and I brushed the crust with a little olive oil and it came out really golden brown.

Wow!  Finally a pizza dough recipe that actually tastes like...pizza crust.  Thank's Jay!  I used a bread machine on the dough cycle [Order in: water, oil, flour (substituted bread flour), sugar (substituted "fake" calorie-free brown sugar), salt, yeast (quick-acting)] and it made this recipe that much easier!  Once the dough cycle was finished I halved the recipe as other's suggested (freezing the rest for later) and it made 8 delicious thin slices (took close to 30 minutes to bake it all the way through).

I like a thicker crust so I may try using 3/4 of the dough next time and using the rest for breadsticks but even as a thin crust it was very filling.  Will *definitly* be making again!

I have made this crust over a dozen times and I have found it to be the best. I have made a few changes the last couple times I've made it. I've added minced garlic to the dough to give it more flavor and now I always pre bake the dough (on a pizza stone) for 5 min. and then top the pizza with sauce, cheese and toppings. That way the crust gets cooked to a golden brown color instead of staying white. I will not buy frozen pizza anymore. It's just to easy to make this crust.

This is the only recipe I've used for years.  I use my bread machine to prepare.  I scale it to 8 servings for a perfect standard-size, 12 inch pizza.  I cut the amount of water slightly as I found I had to add too much flour to make it a workable ball of dough.  Also, after the second rise when the crust is nice and full, it "deflates" after I top it so I'm going to try baking it for 8-10 minutes before topping.  Still, this is the best  and easiest recipe.

This crust turns out everytime!  I roll it thin and make 2 pizzas and they always turn out perfect!  I also add about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp oregano to the flour before mixing (it's just something I do with every pizza crust recipe for extra flavour) But this crust is also great without any additions or alterations.

This is my first ever from-scratch pizza dough and it was awesome.  I made it exactly as written (unusual for me!).  I used baking stones coated with spray and sprinkled with cornmeal and I did not pre-bake the crust before adding my sauce and toppings.  We load our pizza up and the crust held up really well.  Thanks for the recipe!  P.S. My 11 y.o wants me to tell you that he really liked it!

My fiance and I made this crust last night, and it was excellent!!  Just like the recipe says - soft on the inside and a little crusty on the outside.

This made only one crust for us (we like our crust somewhat thick).  I used a pizza stone and pre-baked the crust for only 2 minutes (at 425).  I should have pre-baked for just another minute longer - we like to load on the toppings, and the crust came out just a tiny bit underdone in the middle.

Excellent - definitely a keeper!

Maybe it's just me, but this recipe didn't work for me. I've made it twice now, and both times it stuck to the pizza stone very badly. Also, it was a bit tasteless the first time so I added garlic powder and italian seasoning the second time.

My family loved this recipe.  I did use my bread machine.  I cooked one in an iron skillet and the other on a pizza stone.  We liked the one in the iron skillet better. I brushed the crust with garlic butter. I will probably use a little more next time.I added a 1/2 tap of garlic powder. It could use a little more flavor, but otherwise it was a hit.  This is definitely a keeper.

I added 2 tbsp italian herbs and a handfull of parmesan cheese.  I also brushed the crust with garlic oil and baked it until it was cooked in the center before adding toppings and baking again.  Made two 13" pizzas.  Very good!

This was the best homemade pizza we've ever had! And I have attempted dozens. Really excellent! I used half whole wheat flour instead of all white, but that was my only change. I did split this into two pizzas, which fed my family of six, and I baked them on a pizza stone (one at a time) for a nice crispy crust. I don't know if I'll ever go to a pizza parlor again, the only draw now being that at home I have to wash the dishes!

This make an excellent crust! Once the dough was done rising I knew it was more than enough for my round pizza pan so I made the pizza in a big jelly roll pan. The pizza came out perfect and the crust was a "deep dish". Next time (and there will be MANY more times!) I'm going to use my round pizza pan but use 1/3 of the dough to make breadsticks. When we were eating it Hubby asked me when I'm going to make it again! Now there's a compliment =)

Mmmmm...I'm in Italy and made this last night for my boyfriend here who loves American pizza, and it really turned out like American pizza! A nice thick dough soft on the inside and just a bit crispy on the outside, I even surprised myself at how good it was! We topped it with mozzerella, stracchino, prosciutto crudo, spinach, and sausage. YUM!

This came out more like a bread and not chewy like pizza crust. Maybe more kneading would've helped but it doesn't say how long. It was also pretty bland, if I do try it again I will knead it for 8-10 min and add more salt and sugar.

Yummy crust! This was very good crust. We added 1 tbsp. italian seasoning, 2 garlic cloves, and 1.5 tbsp of parmasan chz before adding the flour. Used half of dough for small pizza and the rest for bread sticks. Brushed olive oil over bread sticks and added a sprinkle of garlic salt, seasoning, and parmesan.

I've never made a pizza crust before but this one was very delicious.  I had a hard time at first because it was too sticky when I started to knead it; next time I will mix more flour in before kneading.  I think I spread the dough too thin in my rectangle pizza pan because the crust wasnt quite as thick as I like, but the taste has a lot of potential.  I will definitely try this again and maybe double the recipe for my rectangle pan!

I loved this recipe! I went with the excellent reviews and I'm very glad that I did. The dough did need a little bit more flour but that wasn't a problem. I've made pizzas before, but no other recipe was as good as this one. I'm going to be using this recipe again, and again, and again.

Turned out well!  I added 2 tsp. italian seasoning as another reveiwer suggested, plus some grated parmesan.  The only thing I would do different is to add the seasonings when mixing in the first batch of flour.  I had a heck of a time trying to get it worked in evenly by adding it when I was kneading!  At any rate, it turned out de-lish!  I only got one pizza out of it, but then again, my pizza pan is 15 and 1/2 inches!

Definately a winner and definately makes more than one crust.  After rolling out a circle big enough to fill width of the cookie sheet, I still had enough for about 8 good sized bread sticks.  I didn't have any trouble with it browning.  We had a "Greek" pizza with layers of thinly sliced tomatoes topped with minced garlic, sliced black olives, onion and feta.  I prebaked the crust for about 15 minutes to keep the crust from getting soggy once the tomato slices were added.  It has a lot more flavor than regular crusts - maybe it's the brown sugar.  Regardless, this is our crust from here on out!  Thanks.

This was easy and good.  I thought I would have a problem with waiting an hour for it to rise, but it took me that long to cut up all the toppings!  I will make this again for sure--it is scores better than the Jiffy mix that I normally use.

This is a professional-tasting crust.  You will never buy the boxed jiffy  or the canned pillsbury stuff again.
For fun, add flavorings to the crust when kneading such as red pepper flakes, cheese, rosemary, etc.
Thanks JAY!

My first attempt at a homemade pizza crust and I was not disappointed!  The yeast I used was even expired by at least a year, and it was still great.  There was nothing hard about making this crust.  Yes, it was sticky after mixing, but by adding the rest of the flour, it really had a nice texture after the kneading.  I used a large deep-dish style pizza pan and made a perfect "medium thickness" crust. Had enough dough left to make a small personal pizza. I also added a little Italian seasoning to the dough before kneading.  I think this crust would be hard to mess-up!

This crust is very, very good!  I admit that I botched it up the first time (or two) that I made it but I had to get it right since all the reviews were so great!  I am usually not this wonky with my culinary skills but I had some trouble.  But once I got it, this recipe was very easy and delicious.  I added some basil and oregano for variety. This recipe is highly recommended!

I prepared this dough in the bread machine, then added a bit more flour and spread it into a 12' by 17' rectangle pan. I then let it rise for an additional 25 minutes, before topping and baking it. This was a pretty tasty pizza crust, but it wasn't quite what I expected. I'm still on the search for a New York style pizza crust, and am beginning to wonder if I will have to wait until my next trip to NYC to taste that yummy crust. Just a note, even though I used a very large pan this crust was really, really, think, you could probably cut it in half and make two giant 12' by 17' pizzas.  My husband gave it four stars. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at homemade pizza, and I was not impressed with this crust.  I was happy that it did not have a sweet taste that seems to be common in ready made crusts that I have tried.  However, I added basil and garlic to the recipe and found it was still very bland.  It was also more bread-like than the type of crust I'm used to.  I think I'll stick to ordering out.

This was my very first time making homemade pizza crust.  I was bold, and went ahead and made two, as I knew 1 wouldn't fill us up.  I'm so glad I did!  Love the texture and the taste!  No more Frecetta for us!  Doubt we'll be tipping a deliver guy either!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I loved the texture of the crust, the taste, and also I REALLY appreciated the cooking time of this recipe and the simplicity of it. THe only remark I have is the edges of the pizza did not get golden brown. It remained pale. May be I'll brush it with olive oil or eggwash for some color next time. But that did not have any reflection on how it tasted in any way.

wonderful recipe!!  we used bread flour and made sure to brush the crust with olive oil before adding the ingredients (I made a great pizza by adding pizza sauce, fresh tomatoes, sauteed garlic, fresh basil, and parmesan/mozzarella cheeses--yummy!!!

I typically use a one pound frozen white bread dough cut into thirds for my pizza crust and bake on a stone.  This recipe makes more like 5 of my size and thickness pizza crusts.  Dough was sticky (probably needed more flour.)  Taste was ok -- not better or worse than the frozen dough, just different.  For the additional work this recipe is not worth it.  I am sticking with the frozen bread dough!

I have made this pizza recipe a few times now and it turns out great everytime.  One of these times I think I will add some basil or oregano to the flour when I make the dough for something a little different.  The last time I made the dough I split it into three and made panzerotties I think you Americans call them calzones. Roll out the dough and place the pizza toppings that you like on one half (no sauce) fold over and seal the edges well with water.  Deep fry them in a large skillet one at a time (I use my wok) carefully turn then over to brown on both sides till golden. Drain on a paper towel.  Serve with your favorite spagetti sauce.  They turned out excellent.  My family liked them even better then the ones we ordered from the pizza restaurant.  Thanks for sharing the great pizza dough recipe Jason.

Impressive!  We liked how the crust (when baked) resembled a pizzaria crust!  Once I had assembled all my toppongs on the pizza dough, I brushed the outside crust with some butter that I mixed a little garlic powder into.   Now all I need is a pizza stone to have absolutely perfect results. Thanks Jason for a crust I will definately use again!

I halved this recipe, and it was a perfect size for my pizza stone.  The crust tastes great and works well, but I had to bake about 15 minutes longer than recommneded in order to get crust completely nice and golden.

Until I find a better one, this is the one I will be using.  I made the dough in my bread machine and it came out way to wet.  It took about another cup of flour and lots of kneading to make it useable.  The extra kneading resulted in a tougher crust than I really like.  Next time, extra olive oil and flour.  Keeper.

Very good pizza crust, but way too much for a medium or large sized pizza. Dough is enough for an extra large.

I didn't divide up the dough into two pizzas and it was the thickest pizza I have ever eaten! It would probably be good if I had made it correctly.

I've tried quite a few pizza crust recipes, but this is by far the BEST one! Very simple yet delicious. Just the right thickness for a 16" pie. This one will stay stuck to my fridge door for a long, long time.

This tasted really good. Topped with buffalo chicken pizza from this website. It was sticky at first but comes together nicely. It spreads like a dream and made to 16 inch round pizza. Looked like a picture when I took it from oven! Will be making this alot. Will try making mini pizza's with it for a quick meal on the go. Thanks Jason for sharing this!

This is a great pizza dough recipe!  It does make a gigantic pizza, though, so sometimes I divide it into a couple different pizzas.  It is really good spread with BBQ sauce and smoked BBQ brisket, then topped with mozzarella.  My kids love it when I use this crust and make BBQ pizza.

I was looking for pizza dough once when I felt like having pizza but didn't have money to order out.  Also, there aren't any decent pizza places around here.  This recipe was so easy to make, that I never go out for pizza and I have had numerous compliments on it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  It is awesome!

Crust was very good- just the way I like it. I made 4 smaller pizzas, instead of a humongous one. Made with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce for a fabulous dinner.

This crust is very good.  I used it with the Hoagie Bake recipe and it was the perfect amount, and the perfect substitute for crescent rolls (which I hate).  I can see how this would normally be a lot, however I am big on leftovers, for lunch.  I will use this for calzones and strombolis.  Thanks!

I have been making this recipe for months now. It never fails. We even used it for one of my daughter's cooking-themed birthday parties and it was a smash hit. I use instant yeast and don't let it rise at all. It comes out quick and yummy!

I used my baking stone which is very large and my pizza still came out really thick!  Next time I will cut the recipe in half.  Despite the thickness, the taste was really good.

This pizza crust is awesome!  It took no time at all and tasted great.  We used the "Easy Pizza Sauce" from this website and they compliment each other well.  Beware though, this pizza crust is HUGE.  Thanks for the great recipe! :-)

This was easy to make and the crust around the edges had a wonderful texture.  I will definitely make it again but bake it a bit longer or on the bottom rack of the oven.  It was quite the pretty pizza, too.  I flavored my crust with garlic and Italian seasonong.  My husband liked it.

This pizza crust came out delicious! I added 1 tsp of Italian Seasonings and 1 tsp of Garlic Powder to the dough. I did not have a pizza stone so I used greased pie pans. I followed the instructions and I was able to make 7 personal pizza's that came out perfectly. I made 3 BBQ Chicken Pizzas, 2 Cheese Pizzas, and 2 Veggie Pizzas. The pie pans worked out great for me due to the variety I was able to make. Ordering pizza for our family of 6 costs around $20.00. Making the crust myself, plus toppings only costed me around $10.00. Everyone loved it better than the local pizza place we order from.
Another great thing is this crust did not come out with tons of grease/fat/oil. Some places when you pick up a slice of pizza, grease just oozes out of the crust. Thanks for the awesome recipe it is definantely a keeper!

This is the best pizza I've ever made!  The dough was easy to make. When the pizza came out of the oven it looked like it should have been in a cookbook, it looked so good!  The crust was yummy and not soggy in the middle of the pizza like all my other crusts have been, including ones in the bread machine.

Excellent Pizza Crust!!  Very Easy to make and form into a Pizza crust.  It also makes very good breadsticks like Pizza Hut.

This is now our favorite crust.  Even my husband loved it and he usually favors Pizza Hut pizza.

The first time I made this recipe I used half the dough for a medium-sized pizza and the other half for breadsticks.  Using the dough for breadsticks isn't the best, but the pizza crust was very good!  And about the stickiness:  I probably used a total of four cups flour.

I've also made this with part-whole-wheat flour, or a bit of garlic powder and dried spices (basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, etc.) and it's VERY tasty!

However, I'm after a chewier crust, and this recipe is just nice and soft.  So I've switched to using Pizza Crust I, which is similar but more chewy.

I'm still looking for a VERY chewy/tough pizza crust...

I have made this recipe up about 6 times and all to "rave" reviews.  I recently made it for our local firemen (my son is a fireman) and they reported back it was outstanding.

One thing we did differently was to make up garlic butter and brush all around the edges.  If possible, it made it even more delicious.

This has become my "Friday Pizza" dough. It is soo easy to put together and tastes just as good as the "Pizza Place" dough.  I use the "Way easy Pizza sauce" by Dan (allrecipes) or "Easy Pizza Sauce" by Frank Sweterlitsch.  Both are very tasty and my daycare kids love them both.  Thanks for the recipes Guys, you've made my Fridays alot easier.

It made a large pizza crust, in fact, I think next time I will make two pizzas! It had a good taste. You need to work in quite a bit of flour to make it pliable. I will make this crust again.

Great recipe!!!  We make it in the bread machine (I add a bit more flour so that the dough isn't too sticky) and divide the dough in half, spread the dough into two pizza pans and bake for 9 minutes at 425. We freeze the crusts so that the boys and their friends can make pizza anytime they wish.  They add the sauce and toppings and bake 10 minutes at 450.

I make pizza every Friday night and my family REALLY enjoyed this crust.  It's the best I've tried so far and was very easy.  I tried making breadsticks with it and they were OK, but as a pizza crust it's got our vote.  Try the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe...it's our new favorite also!

I changed the measurements according to the bread machine's recipe and let it do all the work.  It was great, but do not save the dough overnight to make pizza later, it was rock hard.

i put this in the bread machine and the dough came out perfect! I do suggest that you roll the dough completely out, as our pizza rose very high in the oven. It didnt effect the flavor at all though...delicious!

Wow, what a great pizza crust recipe!  This really is the best pizza crust I've ever made.  It's just as simple as all of the others, too.  I'm so glad that it is here to share with the rest of us!  I used to just deal with the crust of homemade pizza when I ate it... but now I can love it as much as the rest of the pizza!  I had to add a considerable amount of flour to make it not so sticky, but that wasnt an issue at all.  This is truly one of the best recipes I've come across on the internet.  I dont know how to say this enough!  This recipe made my dinner meal today a complete success.  Thank you so much, Jay, wherever and whoever you are!

Excellent pizza crust!  The texture is as described, "soft and doughy on the inside and slightly crusty on the outside."  I made my crust on a standard cookie sheet and found that it yielded a thick crust...kind of like a pan pizza.  I'm sure it would be different if I rolled it thinner and could make more than one crust that way if you prefer a thinner and crispier crust.  I also had to add more flour...about 4 to 4 and 1/2 cups total, which is not a criticism, I just note it so that you are not surprised if your use varies.  This recipe will replace my old tried and true pizza crust recipe.

This recipe was a big hit with my family!! I'm just learning how to cook, (I was never really interested as a child!!) and this was fairly easy. This dough makes a wonderful crispy crust, and stays very crispy all the way through!! Just make sure that you have plenty of time, patience (especially when it comes time for clean up!! the flour get's everywhere!!), and energy and energy when making this dough especially for beginning cookers!!

Since I got my bread machine for Xmas, I've been  searching for a really good recipe for pizza crust, and when I printed this one up, I was thinking, yea right this is probably another lousy recipe. Boy, was I wrong, this is the best I've found so far. It really IS crispy/crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I did have to add quite a bit more flour than the recipe called for, next time I'll just cut down on the water a bit. But hey, we got 2 huge pizzas from it, so I can't complain, lol. Thank you, Jay!

This is perfect crust for a calzone - I split the recipe and then roll it out, fill half with pizza sauce, cheese and toppings and cook as described.  The calzone is soft - I have never found a pizza place that can make it better.

Rises well, crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. Makes a great chewy deep-dish.

Very nice pizza crust!  Unlike other crust recipes I've tried, this one cooked through and lived up to its tasty description.  I also like to add a little garlic and Italian seasoning to the dough for some extra flavor.

Best all purpose dough ever! I’ve made this dough at least 50 times. Always my go to! Depending on what I’m making, I’ll add different herbs or cheese to the dough depending on what I’m using it for. I’ve made pizza, calzones, breadsticks, fruit pies, pot pies, and more with it. I’m making cheese stuffed bread sticks tonight for dinner, and realized I’ve never rated this recipe. Try it!

This was easy to make and so tasty. I used half of the dough for a medium pizza and the other half I stored in the fridge and made into cinnamon rolls. My husband couldn’t get enough of either one. I will definitively make again.

I enjoy cooking and do a fair amount of it. This crust is awesome. The only things that I did differently were...
I used filtered water for the yeast. I allowed it to rise twice. And I dressed it and cooked it for 10 minutes, then put the cheese on it to finish.  (It was cooked in a non-convection oven) 
It was fantastic... this is an example of why I use this site. In a word, wow.

So, I'm in Houston, Nov 2019 and it's super humid. My girlfriend said that might be why it took me almost FIVE cups of flour to get this dough to work, and even then it was fairly sticky after rising. That said, we baked it at 475 F for about 18 min, without prebaking, and it was wonderful. We added a bit of honey to the very ends of the crust for a an extra something. Overall worked out! I would like to try it again and measure a bit more precisely.

This crust is delicious and I don’t normally love crust. It’s got a crunchy edge, chewy with a soft center. The flavor is amazing, touch of sweet, and all around tasty. I followed the directions exactly!

Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I mixed it in my stand mixer and used the bread hook to knead. left it slightly sticky as one reviewer mentioned to keep it tender. I made 2 med. pizzas from this recipe. I have a cast iron pizza stone and heated it up in a 500 oven for thirty minutes. the bottom of the crust was crisping up before I ever got all the ingredients on, so I saw no reason to precook the crust. baked for 8 minutes at 500 and it was perfect. My wife and I swear we wont order take out pizza ever again. This is so easy and far superior to take out. love it. This will be my go to from now on.

Turned out pretty good I should’ve used parchment paper when rolling out the dough before toppings because one pizza turned out misshaped, which was my own fault but turned out pretty good. I even made my own potato wedges To go with the pizza.

It was easy and though it took more flour than I anticipated to get it no-longer-sticky; the result was an easy to work with dough which I *so* appreciated!

Dude, absolute perfection. Pizza was not only the best I’ve ever made but the best I’ve ever had. Making bread is a skill so unless you’re experienced at making bread don’t give this a negative review. Thank you so much for this recipe my entire family loved it.

First time making pizza crust. I followed the recipe exactly. It’s an easy recipe, tastes great. Sunday’s in our house is pizza day. From now on, I will make this instead of buying a pizza. I’d recommend this recipe to anyone.

Love this recipe! After it rises for an hour I roll it out into individual pizzas, bake it in the oven for 5 minutes, then pull it out of the oven, top it, and put it back in for 20.

This is my GO to Pizza!  Ever since I made this, we've not ordered delivery and definitely no frozen pizzas.  
Currently trying the crust from frozen for the first time, appears to be just as good (still cooking).
Only thing different I do is add some seasonings to the crust.  
AWESOME!!!  Thank you for sharing.

Fantastic flavor!! But, unless you like a really thick crust, cut the recipe down.
I will definitely be making this again!!

It was a lot of dough for one pizza. Produced a bread like crust that didn't brown much. Next time I might not use quite all of the dough and make bread sticks on the side with the extra. I don't think it was quite enough for two pizzas unless one is small. Easy to make.

Made this at least 10x with lots of variations in sauces and toppings. My significant other said that it's the best crust/pizzas  he's ever had. My daughter loves it too. We don't even buy frozen pizzas anymore.

This is the best pizza recipe I have ever made.  I didn’t even have to use a roller to spread the pizza dough.  I used floured hands, it was the easiest pizza dough I have ever made.  In the past with other dough recipes, I had struggled to keep the dough stay spread out, it always shrunk.  This dough once spread, it stayed in place.

This is the only recipe I use for home made pizza. This time I sprayed some olive oil on the crust before putting all the toppings on. It's been a couple of years since I've made it.   My family says they love this more than pizza from popular pizza chains.

I searched for a really good pizza crust recipe forever (it seemed) but once I started using All Recipes as my go to site, I found this recipe.  I am terrible about commenting but since I am making pizza tonight, I thought this the perfect time to comment while I am waiting on the dough to rise.  I did read the negative comments and just don't understand.  This is now my go to recipe and has been for several years, I can't even begin to tell you how many times I have made this recipe.  The ONLY thing I can comment on this that doesn't coincide with the recipe is that I split the dough and can get to large pizzas from this one recipe.  The crust is wonderful, crispy on the outside and just wonderfully soft on the inside  If your's didn't turn out the first time, try again....I have never found a recipe so perfect for my family.... and that includes recipes I have used from very famous chefs!!  Bon Appetite!!!

My family absolutely loves this pizza. I had no issues when following the recipe and directions, but I did precook the crust at 325 degrees, as per another review. They turned out delicious!

Excellent! I made it in the dough machine. I  Seperated the dough and refrigerated 1/2 for another day.  Amazing rise, crunchy yet tender. You won’t go wrong with this recipe. PS second time I added 1/2 t garlic powder to the dough and it was over the moon!

I’ve been making this dough for over 10 yrs and it has never failed me. My kids, hubby and extended family love it. In addition to the 1tsp of salt, I also add 1tsp of garlic powder, black pepper,  and Italian seasoning.

Pretty good!

I made a pan pizza in a large cast iron and I definitely could have split the dough in two, or possibly even three, servings. 

I had it covering pretty much the entire pan and by the time it was done rising and baking, it was over an inch thick. 

It was as described--chewy and doughy on the inside, crusty on the outside.

Made an awesome crispy bottom but chewy pizza dough.  I would definitely recommend cooking on a thick pizza steel or at least a stone.

No changes needed.   That woman that said it is way to sticky was incorrect!  If she would have taken the time to add more flour and knead it she would have ended up with the best pizza crust ever, best to keep it slightly sticky. .  I do not pre bake pizza dough.

I've made many different pizza crusts and since this got so many good reviews, figured I'd try something different. I'm now confused about how so many people are having success with this. First of all, there was too much water for the amount of flour it says--it was basically a flour soup till I mixed in at least another cup to get it to a point where I could actually work with it. After the rise when I started to work with it, it was still too soft and started to fall apart. I salvaged enough of it to get a pizza out of it, and it was super bland. Followed everything exactly, and I'm no stranger to pizza crust. Going back to the ones that work for me.

Absolutely delicious pizza crust. It made a lot more dough than I was expecting, so next time I'll probably save half for later. Made a very thick crust baked all at once

I will try again with the pizza stone. I was not sure about the wording concerning letting the dough rise 15 minutes before topping it with the pan. I assumed it meant out of the oven.  I liked it and will see if the dough can be refrigerated and used again in a day or two.

It wasn't quite elastic enough when I tossed it. But was still able to stretch by hand. This very well could have been baker's error. Sturdy crust. Family enjoyed it.

This is a lovely pizza dough recipe. I've made it several times exactly per the recipe. More recently, I've been adding a bit of corn meal to the dough (maybe 1/4 cup? I don't measure, just pour a bit in), as well as sprinkling corn meal on the pizza stone before cooking. I also pre-cook the crust for 15 minutes or so before topping. I love this. Also, when I'm feeling extra lazy, I don't even knead, but just mix it thoroughly with a wooden spoon in the bowl, then let it rise. This works great too. I'll also note, after reading the comments of some other folks here: really, it does not have to be that complicated (squeezing into balls and refrigerating for hours and more balling and  . . . ) to be delicious. Pizza crust is a flat dough. 

Really, you almost can't mess up this recipe. Try it!

I really liked the soft dough, but my toppings were very browned before the dough got slightly brown but not very crispy.  We all loved the soft texture, but if I was to make it again, I might try prebaking the crust.

Great Pizza Crust and will make again.  I modified the procedures when I made it the second time and it cam out even better.  steps below

1.	In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and brown sugar in the water, and let sit for 10 minutes.
2.	Stir the salt and oil into the yeast solution. Mix in 2 1/2 cups of the flour.
3.	Note if using a mixer and dough hook add the remaining flour as it mixes. And skip step 4
4.	Turn dough out onto a clean, well floured surface, and knead in more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. 
5.	Place the dough into a well oiled bowl, and cover with a cloth. Let the dough rise until double; this should take about 1 hour. Punch down the dough, and form a tight ball. Allow the dough to relax for a minute before rolling out. 
6.	Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
7.	 If you are baking the dough on a pizza stone, place dough on to a well oiled stone (I Use Olive Oil on a 15” stone using all the dough) you may place your toppings on the dough, and bake immediately. Or prebake the crust for 5-7 minutes, Then place topping on dough.(makes a less soggy crust) and bake till done
8.	If you are baking your pizza in a pan, lightly oil the pan, and let the dough rise for 15 or 20 minutes before topping and baking it.

I made this as written, and it was awesome. This was only my second time making pizza dough, and after my first experience with a different recipe, I was kinda scared to even attempt it again. So glad I did cause this recipe worked perfectly. Definitely will make again.

Great pizza dough! I halved the recipe and it made a personal pan stuffed crust pizza that I was very satisfied with. I didn't have a pizza stone, so I broiled the dough for 5 minutes on the bottom rack in a normal cooking pot to give it shape and to melt the mozzarella pearls I stuffed the sides of the crust with. I added my bbq base, cheese, toppings, more cheese, and broiled again for 6-7 minutes. The bottom of the crust was slightly browned and absolutely perfect amount of crunch to chewy ratio. I must say, this was my first time making dough at home and overall it turned out great even for a beginner. Next time I'll make some garlic butter to brush on the sides of the crust before I put it back in the oven! Delicious!

This calls for regular all purpose flour, when pizza dough most definitely needs "Bread Flour".  Pizza dough need the elasticity of the extra gluten in the bread flour that the all purpose flour does not have.  The flavour is weaker with the APF too.  Brown sugar just gives it a weird after taste. Use white sugar for a more authentic Italian taste. Also this crust was a little ...bland. You could try adding spices to the dough. Like Oregano, Sweet Basil and/or garlic powder.

Made it as-is many a times now. Adjusted to my family’s liking. While we do not like thin crust but they do not want super thick crust(which I love! But it is supper time and it is not about what MOM wants) , we found a simple medium. 
Make the recipe exactly, let rise 1hr. Punch down, divide in 2 equal halves(you can use a scale to get them exact). 
let the two rest for a minute before rolling out. once rolled out and on a butter greased pan rest about 5 min. 
I have never pre-baked, and this has worked perfect.  425 for 25 min. (ovens can vary) 
at the 20 min my timer goes so I can brush my salty garlic butter along the crust and a tiny bit on toppings, but mostly crust. Take out in 5 min. and your family will NEVER want take out pizza again.

I've made this twice now, the first time exactly as written, and the second time I used 1/2 tablespoon of brown sugar instead of the instructed 1/2 teaspoon (because it seemed like a typo), more flour and then grilled it. IMHO, this dough is too sticky to easily work with. I probably added a little over 4 cups of flour and it was still sticking to my hands, my peel, etc. I didn't really notice a difference with the sugar, and it grilled just fine, once I got it off of the pizza peel.

All that said, when it is finished cooking, it's pretty decent. Or at least the grilled version was. The first batch that I made I did half in a cast iron skillet and half on a pizza stone. The pizza stone version kind of sucked, but the skillet version wasn't too bad. When I tried it again, the grilled version was unanimously the winner. I'm going to keep searching for our ultimate pizza crust, though.

It’s great, not sure how people who “know how to cook” would give this one star. You have to be an idiot to mess this recipe up. Crust was amazing, not super chewy or dry, it’s got enough bounce to it but still crisps up pretty nice. Flavors were great and wasn’t greasy or too heavy.

Soft, light and fluffy pizza crust! Followed the recipe as described (used 3 1/2 cups of flour/ dough was still sticky). After an hour of rising I split the dough in half and rolled it out onto two 13"x9" baking sheets. Gave the dough another 20 minutes of rest before I topped it. Baked at 425F on the lowest oven rack for 18 minutes.

This is the only pizza dough recipe I use. Everyone loves it. It’s enough to make 2 pizzas in my cast iron skillets. I make sure and grease them well with olive oil and use a little cornmeal in the bottom.

This is my go to pizza crust recipe. I use my kitchenaid to mix. You can add whatever herbs you like, I usually add a little oregano or Italian seasoning, whatever I have. I prebake my dough on a pizza stone before adding toppings. It’s Delish. Way better then take out pizza.

It's a good crust. It's pretty puffy though, and it takes a long time to rise.  Also, since it was my first time making a pizza crust I was surprised by how much flour the dough absorbed before it stopped sticking to my hands.

Fluffy but never got crispy anywhere. Needs flavor if you are into that. Good basic pizza crust.

I was afraid this crust was going to be a failure. The dough was sticky and a little difficult to work with, even with adding extra flour while rolling. But it came out awesome--my family raved about it. You must like thick, soft, slightly crisp on the outside pizza crust. I'd like to try breadsticks with this recipe.

I  absolutely love this crust,  the only thing I did differently was to preheat my oven to 170 degrees F and put a small pan of water on the bottom rack .  It cut the proofing time in half.  I removed it from the oven, punched it once in middle, waited a couple minutes and then stretched it out on my baking sheet.  Let it sit another 15 minutes and then put on my sauce and toppings.  I let it bake at 425 for 12 minutes and then took the pizza off of the baking pan and let it cook the last few minutes directly on the rack.  It was perfect.

Because I am a maverick, I added 1 cup cornmeal and 1 cup pastry flour. Also, I only had bread flour so I used that. We grilled the pizzas and I’m telling you it’s OUT OF THIS WORLD. 
Also made a fruit/dessert pizza by spreading berry jam and sliced peaches, baked, then glazed half with a lemon glaze and half with a cinnamon glaze. I only baked that one because we ran out of time/space to grill. Soooo good. Best ever!!!!

Just finished making this, its the best crust recipe ive tried yet! I put it in the oven for 10 minutes before applying toppings helped make the dough cook all the way through and not get soggy. Its chewy and crunchy an excellent easy recipe i highly  recommend

Yum!!  I followed the recipe except added like 3 cups of bread flour and 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour and tossed it all in breadmaker.  I did the dough cycle until it was well kneaded and then let sit 15 minutes.  Rolled it out and place on pre-heated 500 F cookie sheet lightly covered in olive oil.  Baked for 15 min.  Crust was soft and chewy with just a little crisp.  Will make again!

Made dough as instructed came out more sticky  than I wanted it to be and added in or around 4.5 cups of flour total. I bet next time round we'll hit a 5 star , knowing what we do now! The final test was actually a delectable pie, there are no limits to what can added to make your own personal pizza.

I've made a couple of the pizza crusts on here, and I love this one! I followed others' advice to bake it a little bit if not using a pizza stone, before putting toppings on. I didn't roll the dough out with a rolling pin, but did "hand tossed" like I used to when I worked in a pizza restaraunt (basically just stretched it into a vaguely circular shape). That way the edges of the crust was thicker and the part under the toppings were thinner. And then I brushed some melted butter on the edges and sprinkled garlic salt. Had enough dough for two pizzas! Loved it! And I ordinarily am not a great chef so if I can do it, anyone should be able to lol

This has been my go-to pizza dough recipe for years, but I've never been able to make it with less than 3 3/4 cups of flour - 3 1/3 is just too wet. 
Sometimes I sub in a cup of sourdough starter for a cup of the water; and I either sub the sugar with maple syrup or eliminate it.  For two of us, I get three 12" pizzas.

This recipe was terrible. It would be helpful if it specified the size pan to use. Ended up using a 6-inch pie pan.

The crust didn't cook very well. Still doughy inside.

The portion for each serving is also too big.

Great crust! Turned out perfectly. I like to bake my pies in a 12-inch cast iron pan with cornmeal on the bottom of the crust-- they come out much crispier that way. Also, I turn the heat down to 350-375 for a thicker crust like this one.

I made this pizza crust and I have to say that it was AMAZING!  I did add a couple items to it to give it some flavor. I added 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder to the oil and salt mixture. I also made a butter, garlic, Italian seasoning paste to add on the edge of the crust after it baked with no toppings for about 10 min. Definitely making this every time we do homemade pizza.

Made this twice now and was great both times. I left as is for kids and added some Spices to mine. One thing i did differently was precook the crust on bbq grill about 4 min per side before  topping and baking. Wonderful texture and taste!

My absolute "go to" pizza crust recipe. Sometimes I will substitute bread flour for the all purpose. My husband prefers it and thinks it makes for a slightly crispier crust. I don't personally notice a difference but whatever makes him happy. I use this crust for regular pizza as well as for making pizza pockets to send to school and work for lunch.

I've made this recipe many, MANY times now and we love it. I use half the dough and freeze the other half. Half the dough makes a large thin crust. I spread the dough and assemble the pizza on a large piece of parchment paper, then place it (with help) on a cast iron pizza pan that has been preheating along with the oven. I cook it right on the parchment paper. It doesn't stick, no oil required. Makes a nice crisp yet chewy crust. Clean up is easy too.

Great recipe i have made it many times. We prefer a crispy crust so I barely let the dough rise then I put it on the pan and bake it about 5 mins. I put on the toppings then bake it again until its done. Delish!!

This is the best pizza dough !  I make this all the time and it's so easy. I always add garlic powder and cayenne pepper for a little heat.
I just doubled the recipe today to make even more.
Thanks Jay for this amazing recipe! It is delicious :)

I've made this twice and it's awesome. I'm not sure why, but it's better than the other recipe I've used for years, and it's not much different.

I made this dough recipe after using a different recipe that was a flop.  I used non GMO King Arthur all purpose flour.  Added a little garlic powder and oil to the dough before I put the toppings on.  I melted some butter and added Parmesan cheese to it and brushed on the crust.  Husband thanked me and said it was so good.

I love this crust and make it often. I pre-bake it for five minutes on a pan before adding any toppings and it comes out perfect every time.

I made this crust twice with a Chicago style pan pizza recipe. I pre-baked both times (about 15 minutes). The first time I did not brush oil on the top and it was still delicious. The second time I brushed butter, but I think I didn't cook it quite long enough. But it was still delicious! I'm looking forward to pizza each week now, and learning how to mix different pizza toppings. Lots of fun in the winter time!

This crust has a great flavor.  We cooked it as a thin crust as well as a pan version.  Both cooked up nice and crispy.  My only complaint is how much flour I needed to use to get the dough to pull together, but that may have been because I did it with the dough hook in our kitchen aid mixer.

We loved the crust but it does make two large pizza's, not one. I used all of the ingredients but used the KA with the hook to knead until the dough leaves the sides and the bottom of the bowl.  It did take a tad more flour but it was an overcast day. This was one of the easiest doughs that I've worked with and I make all of our bread. I didn't use a pizza stone so I preheated the oven for 20 minutes.  I will make this again.

This pizza dough is the perfect balance of crispy and chewy.  I've tried a lot of dough recipes over the years and this one is by far the best.  From now on I won't make anything else!

Perfect!  I do not usually have good luck making yeast doughs of any kind. This was a home run - fast, easy, perfect texture. I rolled it fairly thick and baked it on a pizza stone. Best pizza I've had in a long time!

Made it exactly according to the recipe. I cooked it ten minutes, then put all the toppings on, and cooked it for about twenty more minutes, (It had quite a bit meat and cheese) and it was perfect! Will definitely make again.

I've been making this recipe for years. It's great! I split the dough into 2 and make 2 medium pizzas. Can put the 2nd ball in a lightly oiled bowl in fridge for a couple of days. I put the pizza pan on the bottom rack when cooking. I've just tried doubling the oil which turns out good too.

My kids liked this crust without any changes. I found the dough easy to work with and the texture was fine, but the flavour was unremarkable. The second time we made it, I took other reviewer suggestions. I substituted garlic- and basil-infused oil for the olive oil, added about 2 t of finely ground herbs (I have oregano, rosemary, and red chili in a spice grinder), and substituted 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 c of a 12 grain mix for some of the flour. My kids actually liked this one just as much and we thought the crust was divine. We have used these crusts to make everything from cheese and pepperoni pizza, to spreading the crust with Chef John's artichoke-spinach dip and adding goat cheese and green olive tapenade! My review is 4 stars as the recipe is written and 5 stars with added seasonings for flavour.

Finally, a great pizza crust recipe! I followed some of the other reviews by adding herbs and spices to the dough, cooking a bit before topping, and I stuffed the crust. I probably should have used less cheese in the crust, as it came out looking like a tire, but boy was it good! The kids gave 2 thumbs up!

I used the bread machine to assemble this. Put in the full 3 1/2 cups of flour, and when I got back from work at the dough was very runny. So much that I couldn't handle it much and had to pour it straight onto my pan and kind of smoosh it around to get it flat. I baked at temperature indicated for 15 minutes before adding on the toppings. Then put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. Kids loved it even though I think I screwed it up by using a bread machine. I baked at temperature indicated for 15 minutes before adding on the toppings.

Alerted by reviews complaining that they got a too sticky or even liquid dough and then had to add a lot of flour to get it right, I started by mixing the dry ingredients (flour, yeast, brown sugar and salt), and only then added the oil and, gradually, the water. So I got the right consistency. I have no complaints about the taste. Just very decent pizza.

So yummy! Boyfriend and I both loved it! The recipe is so great because my boyfriend and I were able to split it and create our own personal pizzas! I also made my own garlic butter to put on the crust and it reminded just like something you would get from a pizza shop but even better! I will definitely be making it again. It's so simple.

I made this dough into calzones (with ham, ricotta and mozzarella).  It came out pretty good - 3 nice sized calzones, which is exactly what we needed.  I only had bread machine yeast on hand, and followed directions to add the yeast to dry ingredients (on yeast jar) rather than to the liquid directly.  Followed the rest of the instructions, but noticed that the dough is very sticky and wet.  I used way more than the 3 1/3 cups of flour called for.  It rose just fine, but was very hard to roll out due to the stickiness.  Possibly I didn't knead long enough?  I felt like maybe it needed a bit more salt for taste, but my husband and daughter liked it as is.

Excellent. I followed the directions exactly as written, and it turned out wonderfully. I did take a commenter's advice and move the oven rack lower so the bottom would brown. Worked like a charm!

Best pizza crust I have ever made. Those of you that have a tough crust, probably overworked the dough. It should be kneaded just until the dough isn't sticky anymore. Good crunch, light and chewy, reheated great!

This makes a beautiful pizza crust. In making this I found that 3 1/2 cups of flour made the dough a perfect consistency. I also decided to season the dough with garlic powder, dry basil and oregano to add more flavor. I baked with toppings on pizza stone at 450 degrees for about fifteen minutes.  Delicious!

First off, there is one big mistake in the directions/ingredients - just which amount of flour do you use?  I used more than the 3 and 1/3 cup of flour called for in this recipe.  I ended up adding about a 1/3 cup more to my bread machine (why do all the work when it will for you?).  I also added more yeast as my old bread machine needs it.  Even with the 1/3 cup additional flour, I was not happy with how it mixed in the machine.  It was very sticky.  The stickiness continued out of the machine and I needed about another 1/3rd cup of flour or so to roll this crust out.  After getting it rolled out, the problems stopped for me. I normally make the pizzas, then refrigerate for a few hours before baking.  Just allow 20 minutes or so for the pizza to warm up some before baking.  It baked up beautifully and was tender.  It was a nice change of pace from our normal crust recipe.  We will use this recipe again, but start with 3.5 cups of flour in the bread machine and reduce the liquid to 1 and 1/3rd cup (what my machine recommends for that amount of flour).

This pizza crust is my favourite recipe for home made dough.  I just put these ingredients in my bread machine or stand mixer and then use the dough.  Very good!

Amazing! I have tried SO many crust recipes over the past 15 years and this is now my go to recipe! It's crispy on the bottom and still chewy in the middle. it freezes awesome - i let it defrost in an oiled bowl and it gets all bubbly and amazing. Followed the recipe exactly. :)

This crust is excellent.  I've made it several times now and it comes out perfectly every time, even when I double the recipe.  I've been looking for a great dough/bread stick recipe and this is it!! Thank You Jay!!

The texture was perfect: soft and crispy! 
I worried the flavor might be a bit bland, so I added basil, oregano, and some fresh, chopped garlic to the dough. I was actually out of salt, but that didn't harm the flavor.

This is my "go to" recipe! Love it! I make 1.5 batches for 2 large pizzas though. I do have to admit, the dough is a bit hard to work with, very wet & finicky but with patience the result is well worth it! I often make the dough, roll out & prebake the crust ahead of time for a faster dinner hour.

Great Dough! I too tried and failed at my first attempt as some others may have done,but I figured out the problem . My crust came out tough and didn't brown right and just came out terrible so all I did was 1. Make sure my temp on the water was 110 Degrees and 2. I let my dough rise TWICE! Yup I let it rise for an hour and then punched it down and let it rise for another hour and voila! Turned out perfect !

Best pizza crust recipe I've found! I like it handmade and as is, BUT I like it better made in my bread maker adding: 1) chopped fresh garlic and garlic powder; 2) chopped onion/onion powder; 3) 1+ Tbsp. Italian seasoning; 4) 1 tsp. vital wheat gluten for each cup of flour. *Always oil and pre-cook before adding toppings, or they soak through!**I've been making this for years, and I've always needed 4 cups of flour, so now I just start with that.  Thanks!

Great Dough! After Reading A Couple Reviews, I Added 1/2 Tsp Of Sugar, 1 Clove Garlic Minced, 2 Tsp Basil To Dough. Also, I Followed The First Step By Lettting Yeast, Sugar And Water Sit For 10 Minutes . Then Added Salt & Flour, Put In My Bread Machine With The Setting For Dough. Slowly Added A Cup Of Flour. I Noticed The Flour Was Collecting On The Sides Of Pan So, I Added A Tiny bit  Of Olive Oil. Lastly After The Dough Sat For An Hour, I Put Olive Oil In My Cast Iron Skillets , Tossed My Pizza Dough (3 Small Pizzas), Placed Dough In Skillet Added A Small Amount Of Butter On The Crust And A Tiny Bit Of Garlic Powder. Cooked Dough For 10 Mins Then Added Sauce And Toppings. Will make this recipe again.

I used this pizza crust recipe a few days ago and it turned out perfect. Nice a crispy outside and good, soft, and chewy inside. I use a pizza stone and was super happy with the results. Awesome pizza crust. My three small kiddos loved it. To a mom...that's huge!
Thanks for sharing your recipe, its a keeper in my collection.

I've made it as written, and altered it a little as well, adding more sugar for a sweeter dough, substituting  about 3/4 of the flour with whole wheat, and doubling the batch.  Great every time!

Awesome crust. This was our first time making a homemade pizza and this crust is great. Will always use this crust from now on. We divided into 2 and made 2 different pizza's out of it. My husband thinned his out more than I did so he had a thinner crust (which he loves). Baked pizza on a preheated pizza stone. OMG!!!!

Used 1 packet (8g) of Fleischmann's Pizza yeast. Used about 3 cups of AP flour which made 2 x 14" thin crust pizzas on non stick pizza tray. Perfect pizza after 12 minutes on lower rack.

A pizza crust recipe review is a tough one since everyone could have a different preference in crust style and if it doesn't meet expectations, the reviews reflect it. I was looking forward to a great pizza crust. But this recipe is only okay. If your looking for a bready crust similar to a pan pizza crust at Pizza Hut this is it (I'd rate 4-stars). But I'm looking for a crust that forms a hard crust shell and dense chewy inside. This is not it, thus 3-Stars.

After working in a pizza place for about 18 years I've got to say this pizza crust is by far a easy pizza crust to make. And it's soft I followed the recipe didn't add or take away from it and me and my family loved it. If your just starting to learn how to make pizza crust try this one you won't be disappointed

This is my go-to pizza crust recipe, I must have made it a dozen times, and I am getting better at it every time. The recipe is big though, I make two or three round pizzas from the amount (although I do always at least double it because for some reason every time I make pizza, someone come over and a single dough wouldn't be enough). I don't pre-bake, but I let each rolled dough rise for a good half hour before filling. I sprinkle the cheese on top just for the last five minutes so that the crust gets some colour before the cheese burns. I also use a little more salt in the dough.

Did not pre-bake the crust but after reading reviews I should have. Cooked for longer than 20 minutes to make the crust golden. Total just over 25 minutes.

I used lots of flour and rolled it super thin.  I put it in a cookie sheet on parchment paper and put the sauce and toppings right on and baked it.  I did not wait for it to rise.  Excellent thin crust!

This recipe made better bread sticks than it did pizza dough. As others have said the taste is quite bland and did not brown on the edges even though the bread sticks I made from the same dough did brown beautifully. I will be keeping this recipe to use for bread sticks and to tweak until I can get the flavor right for pizza dough.

Used 2cups whole wheat flour and 1cup and a third of unbleached flour. Was awesome. Using a pizza stone made it even better, just like a restaurant pizza.

Excellent. I do play with it sometimes, occasionally changing amount of yeast, or using honey instead of brown sugar. Sometimes I cut in whole wheat flour. I always bake on oiled pan, allowing time before adding  toppings. I've never prebaked. Turns out crispy every time.

This was a great pizza crust! It took me a little longer than estimated but it turned out great! I even had a bit of dough left to make cheesesticks! My family loved it, now I don't have to spend all that money on pizza night!

I have been making this recipe for years and have it down to a science.  For some reason it tastes better if you make it like the recipe calls for and then stick it in the fridge 24 hours.  Other than that I brush a little olive oil on the crust and use a pizza stone.

Fantastic! Finally found the chewy, crunchy pizza base I've been looking for:) The dough was quite sticky so, as I was kneading, I added more flour.  We've just moved into a new place so I'm getting used to the oven, and I cooked the pizza for about 20/25 minutes.  Only had a few simple toppings, and it was just delicious.  I added onion salt, merken, and oregano to the dough. I made it as one large pizza, so there's definitely enough dough if you want to make two smaller pizzas.

This was okay/good.  It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside as others have stated.  It held up nicely to the toppings.  To me, it needed more flavor.  It did remind me a little of pizza hut crust, so if that is favorite this is a good recipe to try.  The plusses are that it was easy to make and much better than any store bought product.  I followed the recipe as written and did not make any changes.  Technically it was a success.  It just wasn't my taste preference. If you are going for pizza hut flavor, brush the ends with melted butter.  It is hard to please everyone, especially when it comes to pizza!  Thank you Jay for taking the time to share your recipe with us!

Best crust ever! I did place it in the oven for 12 min, then my children added the toppings, which was fun for them, I then placed it back in the oven, it was fun and it come out delicious! a family/group effort. I must say, I didn't think it was going to be this good because it was very sticky, but it turn out to be the best!

This is my staple for all pizza, pizza rolls or calzone! It will stretch out for a nice thin crust or let rise again on the pizza pan for a good thick crust! I prefer to use filtered water.

This was my first time making fresh dough, so I'm glad this was a popular recipe, because the video was handy and I had to watch it twice. I did add 1 full teaspoon of brown sugar, but I followed the directions, otherwise, and the result was delicious. The recipe yielded two dough balls; one of which I froze, the other made a large calzone. I brushed the inside with a butter garlic sauce and filled with ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms, and white cheddar. I also brushed the top with butter garlic sauce and baked at 425° for 20 minutes, dropped it down to 375° and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. This gave me a tender inside and crispy bottom. Thank you for sharing!

This crust was amazing. Like many others, I cooked the crust a few minutes before putting the toppings on. I also used the entire batch for one large crust. It was a hit. Everyone (5 of us) enjoyed it!

This came out pretty good...like others I added 1/4tsp each of garlic and onion powder, then 1TB of mixed italian herbs. I baked @425F on a stone. The edges browned up nicely and the base rose well.

This is my go to recipe for pizza crust. I've made it over 10 times now. The only thing is every time I make it I always had to add extra flour because it was always still very sticky when finished mixing.

Really tastes great! The only thing is the dough needed more flavor but all around went well as long as you followed the recipe!

I've been making Pizza for years but decided to change my recipe and try this instead. it was AMAZING!! This is the one I'll be using from now onwards. I made 2 large with this. I didn't have a Pizza stone so i let the dough rise 15 minutes after rolling it.

Excellent.  I've been making pizza at least twice a month for at least ten years.  The benefits of a bit of oil on the pan and letting it rest before topping are huge.

My very first attempt at pizza crust and this was so easy. I followed the directions to a T. I went easy on my toppings in case it was a huge failure. Used a stone and it baked to perfection!  I cannot wait to experiment now that I have some confidence with homemade crust. Thank you!  It's a keeper!

Thanks so much for this great pizza dough recipe.  Very simple to make and came out great.  Make sure you wipe olive oil on the stone before spreadng dough. Made deep dish in an oblong clay pan.  A Nice crunch on edges and bottom after baking.  It makes enough dough that you can freeze some for another day.

Turned out too dry and crusty. I pre-baked for ten minutes as someone suggested, and I put it on the bottom rack as someone else suggested. Next time I will just follow the recipe. 3 stars for now. I'll update if it turns out better next time.

This is the only pizza crust recipe I use. I took the advise of another reviewer to include some garlic and onion powders and WOW, it is almost like P___a H_t.  : ) Any left over dough I roll into a teeny loaf and bake as a breadstick.

This was my first from scratch attempt at pizza crust, and it was fabulous!  I learned from reading reviews how I could make the dough in my stand mixer, then I added a little garlic and some Italian spice to the dough.  I don't have a pizza stone, so I preheated my USA Pan and put the dough on that once the oven was hot.  I baked the dough alone for ten minutes, then removed it to brush on olive oil with garlic powder.  After that I added my toppings and baked for ten minutes more.  I always thought of homemade pizza as being an absolute last resort, an opinion probably shaped by those familiar pizza kits I had as a kid, the ones with the envelope of powdered cheese.  This has made homemade as good - or better - than restaurant pizza.  And it was so simple!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jay!

Absolutely fool proof!
Every time I make this everyone gobbles it up... crust and all : )
The only reason it wouldn't work is is your flour or yeast isn't fresh.

This was a really easy recipe. I made this for my boyfriend and myself. He was really impressed. This recipe can easily serve four people if you have sides with the meal (we had salads). It tasted similar to pizza hut's pizza crust minus all the messy grease. Since I put mozzarella in the edges to make a stuffed crust, I baked it for 8 minutes prior to adding the toppings. I knew I wanted a lot of veggie toppings, so it also provided peace of mind knowing the middle would be cooked. I cooked it for 20 minutes after adding toppings. The crust came out wonderfully crispy on the outside and doughy (but cooked!) on the inside. I will most likely make this again, but maybe adding garlic powder and cornmeal next time.

Good crust if you're in a mood for typical American bread like thick crust.  May not be the one if you're looking for a thin crust for pizza Margarita etc..

This crust was so much better than the last one we tried (which had equally good ratings), so maybe pizza crust is just really subjective.  Using the amount of flour given, the dough is so sticky as to be nearly impossible to handle.  I had to keep adding more and more flour, and am guessing I used between four and five cups total.  Once the crust was at the "not sticky" point, the texture was perfect  though.

Because so much flour was needed, we ended up with a really thick crust, like Sicilian.  I should have saved or discarded a bit, not gone ahead and used it all.  The edges didn't get as brown as I'd have liked, but the crust was fluffy and light.  It's not the most flavorful, but the crust doesn't doesn't compete with the sauce and toppings.

My husband and kids devoured the pizza, even my kid that doesn't care much for pizza, so this will be our recipe from now on.

Pretty awesome how simple it is to make this pizza crust. The flavor and texture is pretty great. I made this on a jelly roll pan so the crust wasn't as thick as a regular round version. I'm wondering if this would change the outcome to be more like the restaurant chains like pizza hut or papa johns. I will have to try that out next time.

I have made this crust numerous times. My family and friends love it! It's one of, if not the best, pizza crust I've made! Turns out great every time. Couple of things I do differently are adding a tablespoon of honey, an extra half teaspoon of salt (so I use 1 teaspoon and 1/2) and a teaspoon of brown sugar instead of 1/2 a teaspoon. Also, once the crust is rolled out, I melt butter, adding garlic powder and salt to it. Then, I brush it on the edges of the pizza crust. The crust is so tasty and flavorful that way.  Excellent recipe!

I loved this crust. But I ended up using less water than mentioned here, and the dough was still quite sticky. It would just tear apart and fall down when I tried to lift it. I had to cook it for a lot longer. I believe a higher temperature would help.

First time making pizza, turned out just how I like it. My 2 year old and husband both loved it. I used a baking tray oiled and put pizza dough in middle of oven for 10 mins before adding toppings. I added a LOT more flour  than it said to get it to the right doughiness. Next time I will probably just add the flour to the bowl and keep mixing with a wooden spoon until it looks right, it was too sticky with the quantity of flour in the recipe. I will be making this again for sure. My husband has already requested it at least once a week! We never buy pizza from the supermarket because we dont like them, I had bought bases ready made and added topping when my 2 year old was about one to give her different food but havnt done that for a while so really pleased with this recipe. DELICIOUS. Thanks. Ps my husband says 11/10 :)

As a college kid who has probably eaten too much pizza, this was a solid and simple recipe. While studying abroad it is hard to find crazy ingredients so it is good this one didn't need anything out of the ordinary.

Very good deep dish pizza crust. This is the recipe we will make from now on. We did bake the crust for about 10 minutes before putting the toppings on. Better than delivery!

A superb pizza crust! I have not ever made pizza dough before so made the recipe exactly as directed. This recipe was just the one for a beginner like me! My dough rose as described in the recipe - i placed the bowl in front of the oven vent while i was preheating the oven and it doubled in size as described in the recipe

I was not making a pizza in the true sense of the word. i divided the dough in half and rolled it out to about 1/4 inch thick, then cut the dough into 5 circles using a plastic cereal bowl. 

I then topped half of each circle with my homemade sloppy joe mix! You can see the recipe in my recipe box!

This was great, it was actually enough for me to make 3 pizzas as we like the crust a bit thinner, was crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside, just as it says! I did cook it for a few minutes before adding the toppings, but not sure if it really needed to be or not, great recipe!! Thank you

Real simple to make! I've tried making different pizza crusts before, even for bread machines, and I must say that this tops all of them. Loved the consistency and the texture and the whole family fell in love with it! We used olive oil first, put just american cheese and ham and poured a little bit more olive oil on top, then sprinkled it with some garlic powder. Delicious! Thanks, Jay!

The good: The taste of the crust was pretty good.  It could have been more moist, though.  It was also much thicker than I thought it would be--hence after putting on sauce and toppings it was tough to cook through.  If I use this again, I would either cut the recipe in half for one pizza OR pre-bake the crust a while before adding toppings.  Even after baking for more like 25-30 minutes on my pizza stone the crust was still doughy in the middle.

This was just what a pizza should taste like soft yet crumbly. Sensational. I doubled the original recipe and it yielded two large crusts and two smaller ones. I topped it with sauce and shredded chicken bits minced onion and capsicum. It was a hit.

I've tried about a dozen or so pizza crust recipes with varying results. I've made this particular recipe twice now and both times yielded a truly spectacular pizza. It tastes even better than take out pizza crust and as soon I find an equally majestic sauce recipe, getting take out won't be as delicious. I also should note that it works great with regular vegetable oil instead of olive oil.

AMAZING!  I have never made anything more than no boil lasagna.  I have never made bread nor opened a package of yeast.  I didn't even follow the directions just right but it turned out sooooooo good!  I ended up making a deep dish pizza.

I was able to make 2 12" pizzas from this recipe and the crust still was thick n fluffy. This recipe is an absolute keeper. I love it! I stretched the dough to 3 3/4 cups flour because 3 1/3 was a little too sticky to control. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I'm a happy camper.

This is the first homemade pizza crust recipe that has worked out for me. Made a few changes on the first round, which was substituting 1/3 cup of whole wheat white flour (which isn't much but I thought I'd put some of the good stuff in) and I prebaked for about 4-5 minutes because pizza never works out if I don't. It turned out sooooo yummy and will definitely do it again.

This was great! I've never made pizza dough before and at first I wasn't sure I followed the directions correctly. In the beginning the dough was very gooey and didn't look like what I thought pizza dough should look like until I added more flour. I let my standing mixer with dough hook do the kneading for me. I added a little more salt based on other reviews and I also divided the dough in half as this recipe makes two nice sized pizza crusts. I will definitely use this recipe again.

My husband and I love this recipe! I've tweaked it a bit as I keep using the recipe.I use abt 2-3 teaspoons of brown sugar. Also, we bake the crust in the pan for abt 8 min before putting the sauce and other ingredients on. This makes the crust rise a little and also gives it a little crispness.

This dough was harder to work with than I would have liked.  It was still sticky after adding extra flour.  It tasted good, we enjoyed it, but there are recipes on this site that take a shorter amount of time and come together better.  I used oil on my hands to press this dough into two 14" pizza pans.

I halved this recipe and it yielded a 15" thin and crispy crust.  I baked mine on a pizza pan with holes and although I forgot to pre-bake the crust, it still came out crispy on the bottom and edges.  Next time I will definitely add some seasonings, as the flavor was a tad bland, as is.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, JASON SHARP!

It is good recipe.  Maybe it could of cooked just a bit longer.  I made two pizzas about 12" instead of one very large.  Pizza #2 just came out of the oven.  I let it cook 16 minutes or so.  It was a much better crust than the first one, a little crisper but not overdone.  I put pizza #1 back in the oven for a minute or so.  My wife and kids don't want me to buy pizza from store or pizza shop anymore.  I saw a review that said the dough was tasteless, may I suggest putting garlic in the dough.  Of course you can add other spices too.  Experiment!!!

I thought the crust was just fine.  Not outstanding, but nothing real wrong with it.  Took about 1/2 cup more of flour than called for.  Used the whole thing for a pizza.  Didn't let it rise on the pan, Craig just put it in the oven for 3 minutes to pre-bake before adding ingredients.  Make sure to get sauce close to edge.  Edge of crust was real hard.  What if didn't pre-bake?  What if let it rise for 15 minutes?

This was a great crust!  I made no changes to the recipe and we really enjoyed this.  It made a nice, thick, crispy and yet tender crust.  It's a definite 'add' to our recipe wall.

This Pizza dough is simple, turns out well each time and you can add ingredients to the dough, like garlic, basil and olives without error. Turns out every time. I will note that i use fine whole meal bread flour with this recipe.

AMAZING and EASY!  I used it to feed my son's friends. Made 12 crusts the first night for his party.  Now making it in batches of 4 and they argue over the last piece.  Fabulous white pizza if paired with Garlic Aioli (recipe on this site), onions, spinach and banana peppers.  Have been told they don't want any others from now on... I think I just made more work for myself.  But, it's worth it!!!  Made the whole thing in the Kitchen Aid.  Did not make any mess on counters!

YOU DO NOT NEED TO LET THE DOUGH RISE FOR AN HOUR!! Just make the dough, spread it in the greased pan, and bake the crust for about 10 or 15 minutes before adding the topping (I bake it at 375 or 400 degrees) ,THE CRUST RISES WHILE BAKING, then take out ( the crust will be light with maybe some slight browning around the edges or underneath at this point), add the toppings and pop back in the oven until the cheese is melted and cooked to your liking. I add some seasonings to the crust dough: seasoned salt, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little cumin, and I put the oven on broil right before taking the pizza out of the oven to get the cheese nice and bubbly. My daughter and I made this for the guys during their football game and all really enjoyed!

I made this recipe for 3 people to have pizza with. It made plenty of dough and it tasted like real pizza dough. It was easy to make and it seemed like a really good consistency. I'll have to ask my brother because he's the pizza expert. Definitely a great recipe to have around.

This is my go to recipe for pizza.  It comes out perfectly every time. The only thing different I do is I put a little corn meal on the pizza stone before I put the dough on it.

My family of 4 adults has been making this crust for our weekly pizza Friday, which is really a giant adult pizza party. ONE batch of this pizza crust makes enough so that the 4 of us (2 gents + 2 ladies) can have our own pizza with our favorite toppings. It is delicious, makes us all feel like we are cheating on our diets, and is amazing thin or thick! Delicious with a little salt on the crust and is super easy to make!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Excellent.  I used 1/2 C all purpose flour and 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour for the 2 1/2 C all purpose flour the recipe instructed to be mixed with the yeast/water/oil/salt. I used very little additional flour (maybe only another 1/4 to 1/3 C) during the kneading and rolling steps. This dough was so easy to mix and knead, I can't imagine why anyone would want to bother using a mixer.  Following the instructions, I let it the dough stand about 15 minutes before I added the toppings. I baked it on a 10" x 15" cookie sheet in the middle of the oven. I did not have a problem with sogginess in the middle of the pizza like other reviewers.  I don't usually like thick crust pizza because it is so heavy and overly filling, but this crust had a light texture inside and a nice crustiness outside. This recipe is a keeper.

Very good recipe.  It's 5 stars if you add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a bit of Parmesan cheese to the crust.  I pre-baked mine 10 minutes before I put on my toppings. Made a thick crust for my 15" pan.

This is now our favorite pizza ever.  We loved it more than take out pizza.  The only thing I did different was added a little Italian Seasoning to the dough and cut about a 1/4 off of the main dough to make bread sticks.  I baked in a very olive oiled 9x13 for 10 minutes with minced garlic and a little more Italian Seasoning.  After that I added my sauce, cheese and mushrooms and a little more olive oil around the edges of crust and baked 15 more minutes.  PERFECT!!!  I think the minced garlic really gave it the perfect taste.

I have tried over ten pizza crust recipes in the past, and I can finally stop looking! Such a great base-recipe: delicious as is, and easy to add different herbs and flavors to it as well! Super easy, and results are fantastic.

I've been searching for a dough recipe to match my Grandmother's.  I top this pizza with 1 can stewed tomatoes, 8 basil leaves, 2 t. crushed oregano, and 3 T. brown sugar..all in food processor.  I top the dough and sprinkle with a good parm.  Just like Grandma's.

I actually used this dough to make a stromboli and it turned out delicious.  I added a little garlic powder and oregano to the dough when I added oil and salt, I also had to use more flour than called for to make dough not sticky.  I rubbed the top of the roll with olive oil and sprinkled garlic salt, parmesan, basil and oregano on top after about 20 min in the oven.  I will use this recipe again!

Didn't love it.  Made exactly as written and seemed a little bland and four-y.  Will try some variations next time.

Very good basic pizza crust and easy to make. I have made this crust at least ten times without any problems using my stand mixer. I can get one 14 inch pizza and one thirteen inch pizza (both thin crust) with this amount of flour. If you want more or less dough, adjust the amount of flour and water you use.

I love it...mixed equal amounts of durum, whole wheat and unbleached white flours.  This is so easy and delicious.  Why call for take away when you can make this at home in a few easy steps.  Made me go out and buy pizza stone.

This was my first pizza dough creation and it was ohhh so delicious. I will say that if you aren't baking on a pizza stone, DO grease your pan. We split the dough into two and made two smaller pizzas.  Our kids put the topping they wanted on theirs and the adult one was loaded down with toppings. The kids pizza took 15 min to bake to a crispy bottom with a soft chewy crust and the adult pizza took the full 20 min to get done. This recipe was so easy and just perfect crust. I think we will be enjoying homemade pizza more often at this house! I wouldn't compare to any delivery chains crust. This had more of a higher taste quality. Thanks!!!

I made this last night and it turned out perfect- thank you Jay! I also pre-baked the crust for about 10 minutes at 325°. Just one question- for those of you who use the second half later, do you let the dough come to room temp again before baking? Thanks!

This is delicious and exactly as stated, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  It didn't even need an hour to rise, I put it outside on my table, covered and with the warmth of the 1st day of summer, it was ready in 40 minutes.  Very easy, although I used the dough hooks on my hand mixer to mix it altogether, just a little less messy.  You can eat and eat this, you just enjoy it so much, no difficulty chewing whatsoever!

This was very good. It didn't blow my mind or anything but it was easy and tasted great as written. I followed the recipe exactly. I made a deep dish pizza in my cast iron skillet and had to bake it for 15 minutes. I like my pizza crust soft though so if you like a crunchy crust it probably could've gone a few minutes longer.

Delicious, it turns out perfect every time I make it! I agree, it's definitely best to brown it 7 or so minutes before putting on the toppings. YUM!

I don't know if I did something wrong but it came out a bit dry in some places and then hard in another place. A total bummer. Maybe pizza just isn't my thing.

The crust came out wonderful; It was crunchy with just enough fluff- it didn't brown and it cooked completely through and on time with the topping so nothing came out over cooked. 
Thanks for the recipe! I will make this again.

What a perfect pizza crust! I read so many reviews and also did decide to add some Italian seasonings and a bit of garlic powder. Used my Kitchen aid, so easy and quick. Placed my dough onto a pizza stone (unheated) and baked the pizza for about 35 mins. Crust puffed up nicely, it was crispy on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. I will never buy pizza dough from the store again! Awesome!

Perfect!  I've made this crust about 5 times now and my husband begs for it...I'm fond of it too.  I always add garlic powder & onion powder for more flavor.

Yep.  I'm a fan!  And I was skeptical at first.  This recipe is very similar to my former favorite pizza dough recipe.  In our house, we have Friday Night Pizza and a Movie Night and we make homemade pizza.  We've been doing this for about 5yrs now!!  Lots of pizza!! I already had my old recipe memorized and we liked it - but after reading all the raves, I gave this one a try!  Glad I did!!

Crispy outside, tender inside. Its delicious.  I add garlic powder for additional flavor.  This recipe doubles well.  I use my KitchenAid for the mixing and kneading with the dough hook, but give it a final knead by hand.  It practically makes itself that way! Also, I preheat the oven to at least 500deg with my pizza stones on the lowest rack.  Transfer your pizza with the toppings on to the preheated stone.  In the summer, we like to grill our pizza with fresh veggies and a sprinkling of cheese! Don't forget the cornmeal for ease of sliding the crust around and for extra crunch on the bottom (no flour).

Loved it! I did do as suggested and added 1 tsp of salt and an additional 1/2 tsp of brown sugar bringing that to 1 tsp. I used my kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook and went ahead and added 3 cups of flour to start...then added until it became thick enough to move to a floured board and that was maybe an additional 1/2 to 3/4 cup of flour? I only moved to the board the dough to the board so that I could oil the mixer bowl and put the dough back in. (no need in making two bowls dirty)...I used the quick rise yeast and I think 30 minutes was all it took to double. The crust was soft and yet had a crunchy texture. My husband definitely agreed in using this recipe again! Thanks so much for sharing! It was definitely easy to make! :)

Update: 6/7/14 I used this exact recipe to make the bread for Bierocks. Perfect! The bread was perfect for this recipe and so quick to make! I cut it into 12 pieces and rolled them out like mini pizzas to put the filling in...then put in oven at 425 for 10 minutes. Can't say enough good things about it! Will keep this as my go to recipe for that too!

Fantastic.  I proofed mine in my oven for the first rise, just turned it on as low as it will go and propped the door open a couple inches.  This cuts the rise time down to about half.  I also used milk for about 2/3 of the water called for at the beginning of the recipe.  I just like a little milk in my bread, I think my yeast tends to work better with it.  When I transferred it onto my pizza pan, I poked a few holes in the bottom with a fork to keep it from rising too much during baking.  I didn't do the 2nd rise or a pizza stone, and it turned out great.

This was really good. I wouldn't call it exceptional but I enjoyed it. The only thing I'd mention is that the recipe definitely makes enough for two pizzas. I used one 14" pan for mine. When I put it on the pan it seemed to be a reasonable amount, but it puffed up a lot more than I expected and was quite thick. Good recipe though - I'd make it again.

This was very, very good.  The only change I made was to add a little garlic powder, onion powder, and oregano.  It browned perfectly and tasted wonderful.  This will be my new go-to recipe for pizza crust.  Loved it!!

Good dough, but definitely needed some seasoning.  It was perfect texture, but pretty bland.  I added a packet of Italian seasoning.  Next time, I might throw in more sugar and salt.  The recipe was fairly easy to make.  Dough was very sticky and took quite a lot of flour to work into stiffness.  I don't have a pizza stone, so I followed the advice of other reviewers and let the dough bake for 10 minutes before adding cheese and sauce topping (no meat).  Baked for another 10 and was done.  We really enjoyed the pizza, mostly for the toppings and the freshness.  The crust on it's own was just OK.  This would be a great base recipe to keep on hand for making fresh breadsticks!

Minus baking the crust for 10 minutes before adding the toppings, I followed this recipe to the letter and the crust came out beautifully. I have been trying many recipes over the past few months and this one is the best! Lovely crispy crust, and the olive oil adds a nice touch flavour-wise.

This pizza dough is perfection! I was very nervous because it was my first attempt at baking any type of bread. I have always been too terrified to try anything requiring yeast! But I got a fancy KA stand mixer for Christmas along with the dough hook, and our basil plant was in need of picking, so I decided to try making a pesto pizza. It was EXCELLENT. After reading reviews, I added a bit of extra salt and some parsley and oregano to the dough. Pre-baked for 10 mins on my pizza tray, added my homemade pesto and some fresh spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions and peppers. Turned out incredibly delicious and super easy! Will be making this again and again. My six year old niece gobbled it up (she had her own small pepperoni pizza, of course!)

Made this about a year ago with half whole wheat flour, half all-purpose. It turns out just as delicious that way, too. Chewy, warm, mmm! Going to make it again today, can't wait!

Best recipe yet for Pizza. First I used 1 tsp of brown sugar, made sure my water was 110 degree's for yeast and sugar. I used my mixer and stand with a dough hook. after the 2 1/2 cups of flour I added another 1/2 cup to the mixer, dumped it on my floured counter....
I used another 1/2 to whole cup of flour as kneading the dough.
The dough will still be a little sticky but that's okay.
I used a non stick pan sprayed with a little olive oil.
I also brushed a a little oil on the dough before pre baking.
I pre baked the crust for 5 minutes and when i i took it out I brushed the outter crust with melted butter and minced garlic then added my sauce & toppings, baked for another 12 minutes and it was great....I got 2 meduim pizza's out of the recipe. 
Perfect

This was really good. I made it on a cookie sheet so I prebaked it and it turned out fantastic.  I only gave it 4 stars because the instructions were kind of dumb.  When I mixed my liquid with 2 1/2 cups of flour it was still VERY thin, like brownie batter.  I'm no expert when it comes to dough, but next time I will put in enough flour so that it isn't a huge sticky mess when I'm trying to work with it.  Otherwise fantastic as is

Having grown up outside of NYC and living in NYC for almost 25 years I know good pizza.  When I moved to PA I couldn't find a good pizza so I had to learn to make my own.  This was the first recipe I tried and I wasn't disappointed.  This makes a crust better than many NYC pizzarias.  I've played with it a bit like adding whole wheat flour, gluten, honey, various spices and it always turns out great.  It's just a matter of what I'm in the mood for at the time.  I'm making it again tomorrow night and I'll be making a whole wheat crust with some basil and garlic, with of course pizza sauce and mozzarella topped with pepperoni, more garlic, mushrooms and broccoli.  I'm salivating just reading this because I know it's going to be great.  This crust always turns out well.  Should I try some bread flour instead of regular flour?  Do I want to take the risk?  Hey, why not.  This crust is so easy to make in the bread machine, if it doesn't turn out well I'll just make another batch.

Ok, I've tried this with bread flour and instead of water I use milk.  I cook it on a pizza stone.  The crust is crispy on the bottom but the rest is tender.  The taste is great and I won't make it any other way anymore.  My friends in PA are telling me to open my own pizzeria.  As I said before, the pizza in this part of PA leaves a lot to be desired.  I tell them if they wan't great pizza any time they want, to move to NYC.  Now all I need is a great pizza sauce recipe.  Any suggestions?

This is the best homemade pizza crust I have ever made!!!  I followed the recipe and mixed it in my Bosch mixer and let it rise until about double (which i think is the key ). Then I baked it at 400 on my pizza stone for about 20 minutes.  Perfectly done crust!!!!

I have tried a lot of pizza recipes off the internet and this is by far the best I have found.  It bakes up nice a fluffy on the bottom and has a good flavor.  Give a try, you will like it.  Thank you for sharing.

Excellent pizza crust! I took others suggestion and used 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp brown sugar. It easily made 2 pizza crusts. I made 1 pizza a pan pizza by coating a cast iron skillet with vegetable oil and heating in the  oven until hot then putting the dough in while the skillet was still hot, then put back in the oven and baked the 15-20 minutes suggested! It made a nice crisp crust. Yum!

This is great. Next time will divide for 2 pizzas. One on a 13" stone was thicker than our liking.  Definitely good crispy crust and soft and fluffy in center. Yum!

Excellent crust!  I used 1 tsp brown sugar and let my kitchen aid do all the mixing.  I added just enough flour to make a soft dough.  It was sticky when I went to make the pizza.  I used a little flour on my pizza stone and a little on my hands to stretch it out.  Turned out great.   This will be my new recipe!

BEST PIZZA CRUST. I usually make two medium pizzas out of this recipe. I usually need a little more flour than the recipe says but its all on how the dough feels. I recommend this recipe to anyone.

This pizza crust is fantastic! I have made it twice and it came out beautifully both times. I found that when using it to make Chicago-Style Buffalo Chicken Pan Pizza on Allrecipes, use the baking temperature and time in the pizza recipe and not the crust recipe and it turns out fine. My friend made a vegetarian pizza and thought the crust was so good you could eat it with no toppings. I will be making this again this week!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I haven't gotten the crunch I desire yet, even with prebaking, but I think with a pizza stone it will be just right. Great flavor. Definitely give it a try.

I use this recipe at least once a week for pizza. I choose to use OO flour from Italy. The recipe makes enough for 2 large super thin rectangular pizzas. It helps to actually take the temp of the water before adding the yeast to ensure good activation. I let the dough rise in a slightly warmed oven for one hour prior to rolling out.

This was way too much dough for one pizza unless you like a super thick crust.  I wish I'd listened to my instincts and divided the dough.  Also the dough was pretty much tasteless.  I don't get all the rave reviews which was why I tried this in the first place.  I won't be making it again.

This actually made two large pizzas, could've easily made 3 pizzas out of this amount of dough.

This turned out great, I will definitely start making my own pizza more often!!  I used to work in a pizza place and so I know a few tricks with pizza dough.  I used this to make a pizza and some cheezy bread and both turned out awesome!!

Every good!! A few tricks: 1. cook the dough half way before adding the sauce and toppings; and 2. add italian season, pamasean cheese, and cerole cajun seasoning on pan with the dough rolled on top of it (this adds a zing of flavor)

This crust was fantastic. It was so simple to make and the texture and flavor was amazing for my first time making a crust.

The potato and kale pizza is on attitudesforsale.blogspot.com. To each his/her own, but I was impressed and it's super cheap at about $0.49 per pie crust.

Made this along with Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site. Used mozarella, mushrooms, tomatos and pepperoni for toppings. Turned out amazing. The crust really made this pizza!.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I was looking for a crust that was a little bit crispy and this one delivered.  I halved the recipe to make one pizza and it was just the right thickness.  I baked the crust slightly before adding my toppings. As some of the other reviewers said this crust didn't turn a golden brown when baked.  I used this crust recipe and the beer pizza recipe from this site for the sauce.  It was a great combination and I would have it again.

Good basic pizza recipe.  If you like thin crust, this recipe makes enough for two circular pizzas.

Easy, tasty and affordable! The only thing I did different was to partially bake the crust (10 minutes) before adding the toppings. Will definitely be making pizza more often using this crust!

My husband and I made two small/medium sized pizza's from this pizza dough recipe. Oooooh man did it turn out AWESOME! Like some other reviewers suggested I prebaked my pizza dough. I rolled it out as best as I could (1st time) and as thin as I could because we both really love thin crust pizza's. Then placed it on a pizza stone with lots of corn flour, I think we only baked the pizza dough for 10-15 mins each, just enough so it was firm and not dough like anymore. Then we flipped over the cooled pizza crust and put all of our sauces and topping on it, then placed back onto the pizza stone, and cooked for remaining time,..sorry foget how long I baked for. It tuned out awesome though. I was a little worried about the pizza tuning out soggy with all the sauce and ingredients on the raw dough before baking, but this way worked out perfectly!

This has been my go-to pizza crust recipe for about a year now. It is crispy yet soft, and tasty - just enough sweet. It is also easy to work with. I have tried several other recipes but keep coming back to this one. I love to top it with tomatoes, spinach, and mushrooms.

Just OK. The dough was like soup so I had to add another cup so 4 1/2 cups of flour all together. Very messy and the finished product was just okay, my husband said its like a good frozen pizza but nothing special. I will look for a better recipe for next time.

I made this tonight without alteration. The dough itself turned out well. I sometimes do not have success with dough. The taste though, was a bit bland though. My husband enjoys flavorful crust and this didn't have it. I made this into two pizzas. I made a small one for my son and one for the Mommy and Daddy because my son likes plain old boring pizza and we don't. I wanted this crust to be thinner, as well. Next time I will add herbs and seasonings to the crust and discard a portion of the dough so my crust can come out thinner next time. All in all, this recipe yielded a nice dough and wasn't hard to work with, but the flavor is only 'meh.'

This was ok. Not the greatest TASTING pizza crust. It was easy though and fluffed up nicely. Definitely prebaked without toppings for 5 minutes in a spring form cake pan.

Awesome crust! It was light and crunchy. It would be great to add some flavoring if you wanted a flavored crust. I think you have to avoid l kneading the dough so that it stretches out too thin on the bottom. I made one pepperoni pizza and one with ham, onions, and some garlic cloves on top for extra flavor.

This crust is VERY good.  I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour and it came out great.  This is the only pizza crust recipe that I will make.

awesome crust.  I've always tried to make pizza crust but it always turned out to be flat and crispy... which was fine.  Thank you for posting this.  It turned out great.  I love how you posted the temp for the water.

I make this in the bread machine, using bread flour.  I also pre-bake for 10 minutes before adding toppings.  This is the best pizza-crust recipe I've found, and I enjoy it every time I eat it.

I made this recipe gluten free by replacing the flour with Bob's Red Mill all purpose baking mix and about a tsp of xanthan gum- It came together wonderfully. I didn't measure the amount of flour I used, I added to the right consistancy, but it was under the 3.5 cups. The dough rose beautifully and rolled out easily, but it did stay a little flat through baking. It's not the best GF pizza dough I've made, but it is a really solid foundation. I'm going to work with it a bit more to get a bread-ier type feel.

Only add enough flour while mixing with dough hook until poked with index finger -the dough feels like chewing gum.  This  is the best advice I can give and helped me tremendously.  Leaving at room temp in a plastic bag coated with oil for 3-5 hours- punch down occassionally.  I use fresh yeast because it is what I have on hand but convert measure by googling.  You may have to use more salt to taste  and more flour.  Made in a small stand mixer with dough hook and went 5 min med low speed.   Not as easy as it seems to make great pizza dough.  Also great flour really helps.

I had a problem with this recipe.  I haven't made a pizza crust in several years so thought I'd try a new recipe.  I doubled the recipe, but it didn't rise after sitting for an hour.  It was still extremely sticky when I poured it out to knead - almost still a liquid.  I used a stone, so I didn't pre-bake the crust and the final pizza came out too doughy and dense.  Almost like a pie crust that didn't get cooked all the way through.  I'm going to have to keep playing with this recipe till it comes out right.

Really nice. My family prefers a paper thin crisp crust and even though I rolled this thin, it was still *slightly* doughy for the hubs. This is a winner though with the addition of parsley and italian spices, garlic powder. I whirled raw garlic in the chopper with oil and spread that right on the par baked crust, topped with fresh basil, smashed tomatoes and mozzarella. I doubled the recipe and will use the other half tomorrow for some lovely creation or another. Calzone maybe? This dough would work well for that.

This is my new favorite pizza dough recipe!  I use all whole wheat flour and make it in my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook and let it knead the dough for about 15 minutes.  The dough is definitely stickier than my old recipe but I just oil my hands well with olive oil when I spread out the dough.  It's easy to work with; it's not elastic like some other pizza dough I've tried so you don't have to worry about it shrinking once it's spread out in the pan.  I make 3 12inch pizza's on pizza stones and it always turns out perfect!

This dough is excellent. My husband could not believe it had brown sugar in it.  I was able to make 2 large pizza pies with this recipe.  I made it according to the recipe with no changes. Excellent dough.

The crust can make or break a pizza.  A bland (unsalted) crust makes an entire pizza taste like paper towels.  And a crust that is thick but too dense also makes for an unpleasant crust.

I like both thick and thin crusts, but I've been trying to "perfect" a thick crust pizza.  The recipe I had been using used only one cup of warm water and a quarter-cup of olive oil (I sometimes use butter instead) to 3.5 cups of flour and 2 tablespoons of yeast.  That resulted in a dough that was barely moist enough to hold together and it felt quite leathery.  If I rolled it out thin enough, it made a halfway decent thin crust, but a very dense thick crust.

I then increased the water to 1.25 cups and kept 2 tablespoons of yeast.  That was better, but still not good enough.  I then increased the water to 1.5 cups, yeast to 3 tablespoons, and then 3.5 cups of flour, about 1.5 tablespoons of salt, and a tablespoon of sugar (all ingredients prepared correctly, of course, like dissolving yeast with sugar, waiting 10-15 minutes, etc...)  Anyway, that dough TRIPLED in size!  I had it in a lighted, slightly warmed oven with a damp towel over the top of the bowl.  I came back an hour and fifteen minutes and the dough was sticking to the towel.  It was a quivering mess, like a bowl of wheat Jell-O, but when I manage to flop it into an appropriate size onto a pizza pan, it has made the best crust of any pizza I've ever made so far.  I plan to try 1.5 cups with 2 tbsp of yeast next.

Really great recipe, thank you!  Doubled the recipe to make two pan pizzas 15 x 10.  It was thick on the edges but very very tasty. I think this recipe might make a good french bread too. Definitely a keeper.  I greased the pans with olive oil and prebaked the crusts for about 10 minutes.  They turned out crisp on the bottom, which was great! Yum.

If you are craving pizza, don't waste your money on frozen pizza when this crust is so fast to make. I don't change a thing is this one. I whip it up fast in the food processor.

I was looking for a pizza crust recipe that would come out more chewy.  This was way too thick and bready for me.  DH liked it, but I was not thrilled with it.  I'll keep looking for another pizza crust recipe.

This was awesome! I reaaaally don't like doing anything involving yeast, but this was super easy. I actually threw all my ingredients in my kitchen-aid mixer with the dough hook, and it worked great. To let it rise, I stuck it outside in our 100+ degree weather in Texas and it finished in about 30mins. Ha! Tasty, easy recipe and I'll never buy pre-made crust again!

I LOVE this recipe!  Turns out perfect.  I usually pre-heat a pizza stone before putting the dough on. Thanks Jay!!!!

This is the first time I've tried making pizza crust from scratch so I was a bit nervous but it turned out perfect! Makes a large batch of dough, I used a large rectangle stone and a round pizza stone. Prebaked the crust for 10min just because I loaded it with toppings and was worried the crust might not bake through. Great, easy recipe. Will be using this all the time. Thanks!

Delicious! I put it in a warm oven and it took less than an hour to double in size. We pushed the crust out towards the edge of the pan which resulted in a nice thick crust.

I was very pleased with this crust. It was easy to make and came out quite nicely. I also liked that it was ready in an hour. I only baked it for 12 minutes (on a preheated stone) as I don't like a crispy crust and was worried it wouldn't be fully cooked, but it was wonderful. Thanks Jay! (I am a tough grader and rarely if ever give out 5 stars)

I have made this several times following the recipe exactly and it has turned out great each time. I usually add some italian seasoning to my tomato sauce and then toppings. It's delicious.

Turned out great! I was worried since I have a bad track record with baking any type of bread item. I followed the recipe, but substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (again, too nervous to do more, but wanted to make myself feel somewhat healthy) and left dough out for 2 hrs while running errands. I'm so glad to have a pizza dough recipe I can be successful at! ;)

AWESOME crust. I was pleasantly surprised by how much this crust was enjoyed, given the simplicity. I did have to use white sugar, as I am out of brown, but I doubt it made a difference. I also divided the dough and made 2 crusts- next time I'll be doubling the recipe instead! 
I did pre-bake the crust a bit because I baked them on baking pans- not stones. The crust was very soft.
I will make this time and time again!
Thanks for sharing.

This has become my GO TO pizza crust recipe.  It is easy and bakes up crispy on the outside and just absolutely delicious!  I occasionally add garlic to make garlic pizza crust, but otherwise, I don't change a thing!

Best pizza crust ever! The only thing different I did was use stong bread flour. The base always turns out perfect - soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Wonderful :)

Wow the best pizza crust I ever made. I had so many bad experiences with pizza dough and thought it was impossible for me to make good tasting pizza dough. This is a recipe that is almost impossible to mess up.

Absolutely the best crust I've had in years...the texture is just like a pizza place. I've had fun experimenting with the different flavors you can add to the dough...like ranch seasoning or garlic and fennel. Just make sure to let the pizza rest/rise after you put it on the pan (before baking)

The crust is easy to make, but it is bland.  And while it's a trade off, because it was easy and did work well, you really need a great sauce to, I think, pull this off.  The crust was also a bit hard for my tastes, cooking it on a cookie sheet.

I love to make pizza at home and usually turn to this recipe.  I often find myself adding more flour to get the right consistency.  I measure by weight, so perhaps this is why.  Overall a very good reliable recipe.

5 STARS! Very easy to make and it's the best tasting pizza crust I have ever made! I have made this a few times and it always comes out great. I followed the instructions exactly. But, if you are using a regular pizza pan, you must pre-cook (under 10 minutes) the dough before adding your sauce and toppings.

I make this crust frequently. Even though you have to wait for the dough to rise, it is totally worth it. This is a great thick crust.

Best pizza dough recipe I've ever made, hands-down. The only issue I came across was that I seemed to need A LOT more flour than the recipe called for to get it to be un-sticky, but otherwise, absolutely perfect.

This is the best pizza crust that I have ever made. It has good flavor, a nice crunch, and makes a wonderful thin crust pizza. It's very easy to make in a stand mixer, however you may need more flour than the 3 1/3 cups. Excellent recipe!

I subbed for whole wheat flour and garlic salt. The pizzas where great this way too. I was able to make two large thin crust rectangular pizzas. I used my stone bakeware and the crust was great and cooked all the way through to the center. Keep in mind your stone should be preheated before the pizza is put on it. I put the cheese on in the last five min of cooking to prevent burning.

I very much wanted to love this recipe but there are a few things that bothered me: 1. I prebaked the crust for 15 minutes and then put it in for another 15 ith the toppings and it was too hard. Next time, I will try prebaking for only 8 minutes and see where that gets me. 2. The crust was not very flavorful, I might add some herbs to the dough next time, just a little bit. As these things can be weather/product related and the crust really was soft on the inside and crispy (albeit a little too) on the outside so I will try this again

This crust was so easy to make! It looks really good too! I ate it but was sick and had no taste, but my husband and kids loved it and want me to make this instead of ordering out from now on! I baked it on a pizza pan with holes in the bottom, at 400 for 20 minutes, and it was cooked perfectly, no need to pre-bake the crust at all!!

I loved how pliable it was and definitely thick!  I doubled the recipe and could have made quite a few pizzas from all the dough!  I used my Kitchen Aid for mixing it.  Very easy, very delicious!  Thanks

This recipe was a sensation at our football party this weekend.   It was the second time I have made and it just comes out perfect each time.    I bake it on a pizza stone and used the Easy Pizza Sauce III found on this website also.   Thank you for a keeper of a recipe.

I made this and put it on a large pizza stone.  Next time I'll break the dough into two pieces and make 2 smaller pizzas.  The dough took a long time to cook in the middle.  To make one pizza you really need a very large pan.  That being said, it came out very good, the best crust I ever made.

Fantastic! I cooked on a round pizza pan, not  a stone, and pre-cooked the dough for about 10 minutes. Next time I think I'll only pre-cook for 5 minutes as the outer crust got pretty hard.  Re-heated the next day though was DELICIOUS.  I also added 1/2 tsp of onion powder and garlic powder when I added the salt. It was fantastic!

I found this to be more like a hand-tossed type crust as opposed to pan crust. Having been my first pizza crust, I loved it. Lesson learned, you have to press the dough out, not roll with a rolling pin. Making it for 2nd time today. Thank you for the recipe.

I would put my money on this pizza recipe over any homemade one! Be aware, this makes a veryyy thick pizza. Last time I made it, I took about 1/4 of the dough out for a thinner crust. Next time I may even half it. Also, add italian seasoning to the mixture before kneading it for extra flavor!

This crust was delicious! It did remind me a lot of Pizza Huts pan crust. I just halved the recipe and it turned out great. I followed some of the other reviewers and prebaked it about 15 minutes before putting the sauce and toppings on.I baked mine on a round cookie sheet which I greased then lightly sprinked with cornmeal.I baked it on the lower rack and it only took about 15 minutes after putting all the toppings on.My pizza turned out delicious and I will definately use this recipe again. I don't think I'll be ordering from Pizza Hut anytime soon..I liked my pizza better!

This is hands down the best pizza crust recipe I've tried! Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I used 2 metal pan, greased and sprinkled with corn meal.  I allowed the crust to rise the additional 15 minutes after I spread it in the pans.  Added sauce, cheese and toppings (NO prebaking) and put them in the mid/lower part of the oven (the one on the bottom rack was crispier).  They not only tasted fantastic, but looked professional!  They rose beautifully and came out just perfect.  This is it!  The search is over!

I normally use a honey-wheat pizza dough but was out of honey last night. I am so glad I found this! Absolutely delicious! Even my two-year old, who is not a fan of crust, scarfed down every last bite. I think this will become my new standard pizza crust :)

I don't know what made me enjoy this better--the taste or the excitement of making my first pizza dough from scratch.  This was a very simple and easy to follow recipe.  I did end up using more than 3 1/2 cups of flour, but I followed the directions and added flour until the dough was no longer sticky.  I created two small pizza crusts and cooked them on the grill.  I find it cooks faster on the grill and creates a nice, crispy crust just as I like.  I'll never use the canned pizza crust again.  Plus, this was so cheap!  I would allow myself a good two hours before planning on cooking the dough as it took longer to rise than an hour.  But I'm convinced this is the best way to make pizza at home.

Very tasty! My husband loved it. I did not cook it quite long enough though. I will definitely make it again. I did as others suggested and brushed the crust with olive oil and seasoning. Very good!

It may of been something I did wrong, but it just turned out okay. It tasted great, but the texture just seemed a little off. It didn't get crispy or crust like at all. I will definitely try making again on hopes of perfecting it.

I actually don't let the dough rise.  We like very thin crust, so I roll it out extra thin and there's enough for 4 personal pizza's for our "Make Your Own Pizza Night".  Excellent crust!

This was my first time making pizza dough and it was delicious! I had trouble rolling it out because the dough is so sticky so next time I will not be afraid to add flour while kneading. I would like to try this recipe with slightly more sugar and bread flour for a chewier crust. I can't wait to make this again!

After trying tons of pizza doughs, this one stood out. It was crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. Good flavor and easy. Fine AS IS.  If you have to do changes: Add some garlic powder to the dough and 1/2 teaspoon more brown sugar.

Wonderful recipe.  We make this every Friday night. We like to add different flavors to the crust by brushing with Olive Oil or butter and sprinkling with parmesan, spice, or garlic.  If I was really ambitious, stuffing the crust with mozzerella would be good too!

This was really good even though I sort of messed up the recipe (my computer died, and I had to go off memory).  I accidentally added ALL of the flour to the yeast mixture before kneading.  Turned out pretty good despite that.  I'll use this recipe again for sure.

SUPER easy!!!  Like others say, it does make a lot of dough.  Could be split into two pies, but if not watch your cooking time.  I made mine on a large pizza stone and wish I would have baked a tad longer.  Won't make that mistake next time!

Quick and easy and makes a great crust! This will grow a bit when baking, so make sure to roll it really thin. We use it for calzone night - one recipe makes 4 personal sized calzones. I also added some garlic and some herbs to the dough to add interest, but its fine without, if a little bland.

This was my first from scratch pizza crust and it turned out amazing! I did have to use quite a bit more flour than 3 1/2 though. I'm sure it depends on the weather at the time. I ran out of all-purpose flour and after using the 3 1/2 cups I had, I used part whole wheat flour, part bread flour for the rest and loved the result. My picky, "anti-whole wheat" sister even loved it! :) I will have to look no further for a favoriate pizza recipe! Thanks for sharing!

So I've made this pizza crust recipe at least 10 times since finding it on here, and it has never ever failed me yet. I like to crush up some garlic, mix it with a bit of oil and brush it all over, especially on the crust. It always turns out fantastic, and is chewy and crispy the next day, even out of the microwave! You have to try this recipe!  I've rolled these into calzones as well, and they turned out marvelous.  Here's a tip - double the recipe, set half aside. When it's risen, follow the directions, but roll it out in an even shape and bake it with cheese on top. Makes some awesome breadsticks! Very versatile dough. Thanks!

Delicious!!! I am a novice when it comes to dough and this one was extremely sticky; quite tricky for me. I used so much olive oil I was afraid it wouldn't turn out well. IT WAS SO GOOD! Definitely worth the  work! This is what pizza crust should taste like!

While my crust wasn't crispy on the outside, like so many experienced, the flavor was really wonderful and...bready.  The lack of crunch may well be the fact  that I used a pizza stone.  In any case, if you like a flavorful, chewy, soft crust, this one will do it for you in spades.  It makes a lot, compared with some dough recipes.  For my 15" round stone, it made a full, fairly thick crust.

This was very easy & tasty. The only thing I didn't like is the stickiness of the dough (I sprayed olive oil spray on my hands, that didn't work & I also used lots of flour). Thankfully my 14 yo son took over & finished. I sprayed the pan with olive oil & sprinkled cornmeal on it like some suggested. We really enjoyed it & will make it again since I doubled the recipe :)

oh my god. awryty,lemme explain. for as long as I've cooked,I've had a pizza crust recipe of my own, of which i think the whole world. i thought it was perfect.so i didn't even try any other pizza crusts,until i saw jay's here.with the great rating,i thought i might just see what so glorious about it.I cannot believe it took me so long! it was fabulous,and it felt so so light,crusty outside soft inside. very easy and very very delicious. perfection.  i did not make any alterations.  i baked in an oven,but i did not pre bake before adding toppings,just let it sit after i punched it down after an hour rising,and then let it raise again in the pan BEFORE putting it in the oven.it was done perfectly,middle too. this is my new go to recipe!

this crust tastes pretty good but it gets 3 stars because it takes 2+ hours to get a crust just as good as the quick crust recipe which is ready to bake in about 15 minutes!

Finally, a fantastic pizza crust recipe that is easy to make!  Once the yeast mixture was ready, I just poured into my stand mixer and let it do the work.  Definitely prebake your pizza stone and/or crust.  I like my crust a bit thinner, so this made almost enough for 2 servings - so I made one and freezed one.  This is a great and easy recipe - give it a try!!  We will never get pizza delivered again!

Wow! I've tried many homemade pizza crusts over the years, but this is the best and easiest one yet.  I increased the brown sugar to 1 Tbsp. and added a shake of garlic with the salt and oil.  We like a thin crispy crust so I got two large pizzas from this recipe.  I used olive oil to grease my pans and sprinkled with yellow cornmeal.  I baked at 400 in my convection oven.  My family loves this crust.  Thanks Jay!

I have been using the same bread machine pizza dough off this site for quite a while, but did not have the beer to hand which it needs, so I decided to give this a try.  Not a bad pizza crust, easy to make but if I am honest not as good as the usual crust I make.  I guess this will be my standby recipe, but not the one I will be using all the time.

By far the best we have ever had!  I have tried a lot of recepies for crust in the past with terrible reviews.  I made this recepie with an herb crust, but the simple version here tasted better to us (even though the herb was not bad, I added it when the salt is added).

Delicious.  I don't think that I rolled the dough out enough because the crust was very thick.  Also, I had to add a little bit more flour because the dough was a little too sticky.  But the pizza turned out great with this recipe.  I think that the brown sugar is the key.

Simply delicious! I usually just throw crust's away, but this tasted just like a breadstick! Break out the spaghetti sauce or olive oil and eat up!  I added a little bit of garlic powder and ended up needing about an extra 1/2 cup of flour, but it was wonderful!

This was easy but sort of flavorless. If I use this recipe again (and I would be inclined to try it) I would want to add some spices to the dough: more salt for sure, some rosemary and maybe black pepper and/or dried basil.

I only rated this 5 stars because more weren't available!  What a great crust - quick, easy to work with, and most of all, delicious.  I make the basic crust as Jay described - or I will play with it.  I haven't had a failure yet.  The only permanent change that I have made in the recipe is the use of malt extract instead of brown sugar.  I use malt (from beer brewing) for the sugar in all of my baking because I like the more complex flavor it gives.  Thank you, Jay.  This is truely a great recipe.

This was ligt and airy and delicious.  Made it in the bread maker and voila. Cooked for 5 minutes with sauce only before adding toppings. Made the copycat pizza sauce, sausage and green pepper.  Delicious!

My family goes insane for this pizza crust! They only thing I do different is add a ton of Italian seasoning, and garlic powder for some extra flavor! Thanks for the great recipe!

It was great for a make your own pizza crust. I have been looking for the perfect crust and that was gretting closer but didn't hit the spot. It was good and crispy on the bottem but for what I am looking for, that just wasn't it

We loved it! MY boyfriend told all of his friends about how amazing the pizza was and he told me we shouldn't buy frozen or order delivery ever again.  I did mix in some italian seasoning while kneading the dough.  Other than that, I followed the directions perfectly.    Just a side note: This was my first time making pizza dough.  There it no need to roll the sides of the dough to create the look of a crust.  The dough will rise and create a nice crust of it's own.

This is the best crust you will ever eat or make!!!! We upped the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon as we like it a little sweeter. best after it rises and you take it out of the bowl to let it set for about ten fifteen min. not sure what it does but it really helps. Makes it more workable for me. I use Fleischmann's rapid active dry yeast, and King Arthur unbleached bread flour. I will measure out how I make my wonderful sauce and post it on here soon.

I usually use honey instead, and more like a tablespoon or so of it, and I add herbs to the dough. It's got a great consistency, though! Just needs a little more flavor.

I have made this crust dozens of times over the last 8 years.  It is fluffy, chewy and tasty.  Yum yum. My kids prefer thin crust so I am searching for a thin-crust recipe that will produce results as excellent as these.

This dough recipe is easy and really good. I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I did Differently is put my stove on lowest temperature and and put my greased bowl with the dough inside to accelerate the rising of the dough to 45 minutes instead of an hour.I made one square pizza on a cookie sheet pan I am really surprised that my picky eater boyfriend love it so much so for sure I will make it again and recommend it to my family and make it double the next time I make and freeze so we could have it everytime we want. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was a really good recipe. I added a tsp of Oregano, 1/2 tsp. of garlic to the wet ingredients before adding the flour. It was a really soft crust and the family has kicked the old recipe out and replaced it with this one.  Oh yea, it would be expedient to cook the crust for about 10 minutes before topping it, worked great for me! Thanks Jay!

I have made this recipe a few times now. At first I couldn't get it right, but since then this crust turns out excellent every time! Relatively easy to make and very few ingredients needed. Sometimes I had a T of Italian Seasoning.  Yum!

This was okay.  It was a thicker crusted pizza than what we were used to.  The crust was very sweet but maybe we noticed it more because of the spicier sauce I made.

I made this last night. I was expecting this amazing crust because of all the great reviews. I wasn't crazy about it, it was very spongey, maybe I did something wrong but I thought I followed the directions carefully. Maybe it didn't turn out right because I made stromboli with it. Whatever the reason, I will not make this again.

Perfect! My kids will even eat the crust. I make mine in a bread machine and have no problems. When I want to "spice" things up I add 1 tsp garlic poweder and 1 Tbsp of fresh minced basil. But this recipe truely needs nothing, it's great!

This was great! Really enjoyed the chewiness, and the ease of working with the dough. I replaced about half the a.p. flour with whole wheat for a heartier flavor (and I prefer a wheat crust with BBQ chicken pizza in particular.) Used with Barbecued Chicken Pizza from this site.

Great crust.  Used 1 C wheat flour, will try to increase next time.  Divided into two crusts and froze one for next time and it turned out wonderful.

I have made this many times.  Takes some work and is a little messy, so if you have freezer space, make more than 1 and go ahead and roll it out on a pizza pan, cover with heavy foil and freeze.  Just thaw it out for your next pizza.

I was amazed that I actually made my first homemade pizza from scratch. It was abosultely the most enjoyable receipe to follow. The  " Spicy Chicken Pizza" came out delicious. My kids were pleased. They're my food critics. Bye the way, I spiced up the crust with oreagno, garlic powder,sea salt and crushed bay leaves.

I always get lots of compliments on this pizza crust.  I follow the recipe and then dust the pan with cornmeal before putting the dough into it.  I also poke the dough all over with a fork before adding my pizza sauce and toppings.  I often use the "Gourmet Chicken Pizza" recipe with this crust.  I have also frozen the dough when I made too much and when it was baked it still turned out great.

Awesome! I've never made dough before. It was easy, and makes the perfect amount for two pies. I typically make one and freeze the other. Later in the week, I've got a ready to go pizza crust.

This was good dough.  I rated it 4 instead of 5 because I am still looking for "it," the perfect crust.  The only thing I did different was using a cup of white whole wheat in place of some of the AP flour because I ran out of AP.  I used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe on this site to go with it, and it was perfect.  This recipe makes 4 personal pan-style pizzas perfectly.

I am 1,829th person to review this AWESOME pizza crust.My family loves loves this crust!!! OMG! I  made sure I had the freshest ingredients, {yeast,home made sauce, tomatoes,basil,mozzarella cheese,pepperoni} I actually accidentally add all of the flour and then used more for the kneading portion,it Still worked out just fine. this was so perfect and Delish! My son said he would rather eat this pizza crust then any other! I guess I don't need to look any further for a pizza crust.I grilled this and it was Fabulous!! I did have a little problem with the dough tearing, I need to stop trying to stretch it so much. Next time I will add some Italian seasoning to the dough. Thank You very much:):) Jay!!

I have failed with pizza crusts many times, but was successful with this recipe! The only change I made was adding an additional tablespoon of brown sugar. I would agree with other reviewers that the crust is a bit bland and would suggest adding garlic & onion powder and maybe some Italian seasoning to the dough.

Fantastic recipe!  I consistently need to use more flour than suggested to keep the dough from becoming sticky (perhaps related to using a mixer with dough hook?), but the outcome is still wonderful.  I've begun using the extra dough to make bread or cheese sticks.  Thanks Jay!

My kids loved this and they usually prefer almost any other pizza to my homemade.  I doubled the batch so ended up with 4 crusts.  I put one as dough into the freezer, we will see later if it comes out as good.  I used a stone so didn't precook as the recipe suggested but normally I precook all crust for about 10 minutes so it is not soggy.

Wow! Slow rise is the way to go for flavorful,chewy yet crispy pizza crust. It only takes a little planning ahead, and this recipe is so much better than a quick rise crust. I baked it on the pizza stone on the grill and it was fantastic.

Pretty sure this is the biggest pain-in-the-butt crust I've ever dealt with. No matter how much I flipped flopped an flung it it was a struggle. On the positive side, it turned out well. No complaints =) when I asked how my brother liked, it he said it's as good as Alfy's. Whoo why thank you [[got 2 crusts, which I topped with Taco Pizza]]

Excellent crust.  I like to freeze half in saran wrap (I've found it works better then wax paper).  I let it rise and then punch it down and split it.  One half goes right into the oven for about 15 minutes as a prebake before toppings - I've found this just makes a better crust for our taste.  I use a deep dish ceramic pie dish.  The other half goes right into (tightly wrapped) freezer bag and into the freezer.

Excellent pizza crust!  It's a nice deep dish and looks picture perfect!  Next time I think I will add seasoning to the crust.  Will for sure make this one again!

i've used this recipe more than once, and it works well with different variations of flour.. it's AWESOME. So delicious, no matter if it's baked on stone or baking sheets, and everyone i've ever made the pizzas for ADORE them. So thanks for this recipe, it's easy to remember by heart now, and i never used to make pizzas at home.. i sure do now. i will NEVER order in AGAIN.

The best pizza crust.  So versatile, I like to switch it up by adding herbs or spices right in the dough.

After trying many others, the family all agreed that this should be our standard.  I substituted one cup of the flour with whole wheat flour, and it was still crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I added garlic powder and oregano, and pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes.  Fantastic!

I love this recipe. I have been lurking on here for months and this recipe made me join just so I could write this review. I changed nothing and cooked two pizzas in 9 inch cake pans.I realize that I could have made at least 4 of the same pizzas had I spread the dough a little thinner. All the same, Fabu thick crust pizza was my result I sliced it half way between cooking so the oils from the toppings could sink into the bottom to get that greasy pizzeria taste. This will be staple recipe in our house no more spending money at the HUT. Thank you so much for sharing.

I love this dough & the only reason i dint give it 5 stars was b/c 'as is" its kinda bland. You will definately need to add your own spice/seasoning to it. But it was very easy to work w/ and always came out great!

It is a great crust, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Our guests loved it.  We made mini-pizzas on the grill.  I preheated the grill on high and rubbed the grate with veg. oil.  Be sure to make each pizza just prior to tossing on the grill.  They tend to become sticky when they sit.  I grilled each for a couple minutes on one side.  Then we took them off the grill, put (minimal) sauce and toppings on the grilled side, and placed them back on the grill to melt the cheese.  Used with "Unbelievably Awesome Barbeque Chicken" recipe, also on this site.

This is the first time I have attempted to make homemade pizza crust and it came out perfectly.  I did add some italian seasoning and garlic powder as suggested by others and used a 15x10 pan for one pizza, which made a yummy, thick crust.  I made a couple pizzas with another batch, but it was the thick crust that got the best reviews from my family.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This crust was the perfect mix of crispy and chewy (just like the heading says), and it wasn't too thin or thick.  I made it with the sauce from the Deep Dish Alfredo Pizza recipe from this site and added chicken. Very good!

The dough was the best I've found, and I've been looking for a while. I took one reviewer's advice and added garlic powder and pizza/Italian seasoning in with the salt and oil. This crust tastes amazing, is chewy and soft, and has a perfect slightly crunchy outer crust. This will be my crust from now on.

This pizza crust is delicious!  I love making my own dough and I was really impressed by how well this dough turned out.  Beware, this does make one giant pizza crust, but I like to divide the dough into two smaller pizzas.  This way the dough cooks faster without the cheese overcooking.  I even added some whole wheat flour to this dough and it still turned out delicious!  I recommend this crust to everyone.

I make my pizzas pretty thin, and this dough is fantastic. It's easy to make, tastes great, rolls out easily, rises well in the oven, and the crust tastes wonderful.  This is the first time I've had pizza crust taste so good.  It is important to brush the crust with olive oil at least twice: once before you put it into the oven and once again 1/2 way through.

Wow! This was good and easy my 14 year old daughter made it. The only thing I might do is try to add some seasons to the dough.

Great recipe! I will be making this again.  It was easy and it tasted way better than I was expecting. It comfortably fed my family of 5, who are big eaters.

I love this recipe.  I always hated making pizza dough before (Lucky when I was in college a local bakery sold it premade) because of the smell of the yeast.  This mixes up without the excessive yeast smell, cooks just perfect on a Pizzazz pizza cooker and other then the time allowing it to raise doesn't take a large amount of time.  My only regret is not reading the reviews before I made it.  It really does make a very large pizza, 1/3 to 1/2 is enough for me.  Now I can have a homemade pizza with fresh toppings for less then half the cost of a premium frozen pizza and it tastes a lot better.  Thank you!

This is the most wonderful crust recipe I've ever made. I've tried lots out of cookbooks, etc. but none compare. I sprayed the outer edges of the crust with PAM before baking for extra crispy.

This is good! The only thing I change when I make this is I increase the oil and water a little so the dough is nice and soft as I usually have a hard time getting the dough to spread out in the pan. I use about 2/3 of a recipe when I use my countertop rotating pizza oven.

Very good pizza crust. I cut the amount of yeast required in half (for a thinner crust) and added 1 teaspoon of soy lecithin for better mixing. It didn't rock my socks off, but it was a decent homemade pizza crust. The main downside was that there was not a lot of bubble definition in the cooked crust, even with a pizza stone.

It was really good but it took a lot of time to make so plan your day with that in mind.  Additionally, make sure you realize that this recipe makes a huge pizza, so what we did was divide it into thirds which was fun because we got to create three extemely different pizzas.

Oh my goodness, this is so yummy. Actually Im eating this right now. We had some pizza left over from yesterday and Im eating it cold. It's wonderful fresh and cold the next day. I made a large pizza with this, we like thick crust. And next time Im going to put some cheese in it. Oh that will be sooo good! It was my first attempt to make a homemade pizza, I had some much fun with it that Im going to be making this often. Of course, this will be my crust recipe!

I give it 5 stars for taste and 3 for ease to work with, so an average of 4 stars.  I upped the recipe to 20 servings so it would make 2 large pizzas.  I also made mine in my bread machine.  It mixed up well but the dough was very sticky and I ended up having to mix in quite a bit more flour to make it workable.  Now I use 1 3/4 cups of water as opposed to the 2 cups called for in the 20 serving recipe and that helps.  I have still had to add in a bit more flour but not nearly as much, I could probably cut back a bit more on the water.  The crust is very tasty though so it makes it worth the extra stickiness.

This crust was AMAZING! I never made fresh bread before and it turned out excellent. I made the Four cheese margheritta pizza from this site. I baked the crust 5 minutes before adding toppings and then baked for another 15. It turned out perfect. We dipped our crust in melted "I can't believe it's not butter spread" with garlic powder.

This crust was really good. I followed the directions exactly except cut the water down to 1 cup and the flour down to 3. I made a thick crust and baked ito n a pizza stone. The crust came out very soft on the inside and had a nice crisp on the outside. Very good! I usually eat thin crust, so I will divide this in 2 next time and see how it holds up.

WOW! This was delicious. I made the recipe exactly as called for and did not expect it to turn out well because I'm a mess in the kitchen! However, it suited even my novice cooking abilities and turned out DELICIOUS! I'm passing this recipe on to my mom.

I have made this 2x and I must say it rocks!!! I have discovered that if you cook your veggies first you will get a lot less water from them. I just do a quick stir fry of the veggies before I put them on since the adults prefer a veggie pizza.  Thank you for sharing this  reipe!!!

Very easy and turns out very good.  Even with variations, like adding ground flax or subbing in some whole grain flour it still turns out great.

I made this tonight, and it turned out great. I was a little worried because I've never made pizza dough without the use of my bread machine, but it was so easy. Next time I will add some Italian seasoning and some garlic to give it a bit more flavor.

I didn't care much for this dough. It tasted too much like bread and not enough like pizza crust. I also found it to be waaaay to sticky, and it was hard to stretch without tearing.

Best pizza crust I've found yet and I've been looking for years.  I did bake it a few minutes before putting on the sauce and toppings to keep it from getting soggy in the middle.  Worked great.  No more store bought pizzas for this family. Everyone likes homemade much better.  Thanks Jay!!

Best pizza crust ever. I made the recipe as is but added the following spices: 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1 Tbsp italian seasoning. This crust is great, crusty on the outside, but chewy on the inside. It was really good.

This was my first attempt at homemade pizza dough and I was thrilled with the results!  This recipe was easy and turned out fantastic.  I have used the full recipe to make one thick crust pizza and have also split it in half to make two thin crust pizzas (on a 15-inch stone).  I think the texture of this crust would be great as breadsticks also.

Love this pizza crust... nice and soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  The recipe makes two 8" circle pizza pans with the perfect amount of crust - not too thick like lots of other recipes.

Used again..still fabulous. But since it makes enough for two, I froze the second one for later in a small freezer bag. Then, placed in refrigerator to let it thaw. Perfect!

This has become my go to pizza crust recipe.  It is easy and quick (minus the time it takes for the dough to rise). I use it once a week for pizza night at my house.  I can make 2 pizzas with this recipe.  I do add a little garlic powder to the mix and brush the pizza pan with olive oil before baking.  Much bettter for you (and cheaper) than ordering out.

Delicious, tasty pizza crust. Easy to make and ready to use fairly quickly, makes the best crust, crunchy yet tender. Will make this at least once  week. Great for bread sticks also. We love it, no more take out.

I used this dough to make a grilled pizza.  I don't know why anyone would bake a pizza when they could grill it!  It worked fantasticly!  The only thing I would suggest is to add more salt and some minced garlic.

GREAT pizza crust.. This is the first time I have ever made pizza dough and it was so easy! All I did was follow the directions and threw everything into my mixer with the dough hook and added more flour until the dough was not too sticky and formed a ball shape. So homemade.. no more delivery or dellisio for me!

I tested a few recipes and this one is the one I'll be sticking with from now on.  I used a double layer aluminum pizza pan with the aeration holes and this crust turned out excellent.  I also used a not stick spray and a light powdering of flour, but I'm not sure if that had much to do with it.  The consistency of the crust was equal throughout and I didn't even use a rolling pin (I did use a drinking glass to try and get the edges equal though). I would take this over any restaurant style any day.

Followed this recipe exactly, except brushing the edges of the crust with 1 T of the olive oil and sprinkling the crust with garlic powder.   Then we topped it with a little sauce, a combination of jack and swiss cheese (we were out of mozzerella), kalamata olives, and carmelized onions.   Makes a very good, pizzeria style crust. This recipe is the one I will use again!

The best crust.  Adding spices to the crust isn't neccessary....those can be added to your sauce and other flavors can be added via your toppings.  I made this twice when my yeast wasn't active (too old I guess) and everybody loved it as a flat crust too....but whoa look out when you add active yeast....what a huge crust.  This easily makes two pizza crusts....nice and chewy if you don't overbake it.  People are asking for the recipe....which is a good indicator of a keeper!

I've used this recipe countless times, and it is a great crust. I have also put a little twist by replacing half a cup of the flour for yellow corn meal for a Chicago Style Deep Dish.

Very good, but with a few changes it could be great! I would definately add a few seasonings to the dough next time, it lacked flavor and was very blah. And also i would precook slightly before addign the toppings and the underneath part of the dough was not fully cooked but the edge of the crust was

Fantastic, pizzaria-quality pizza dough. I like that the ingredients are common pantry items and yeild a high-quality crust. I might cut back a little on the salt next time.  I made my dough in a bread machine, dusted it with white rice flour before shaping it, and baked it on a pizza stone.  I use wheat germ on my stone instead of gritty corn meal. Thanks for a winning recipe, Jason!

This crust was awesome! It was so fluffy and tasted great. We first thought it was going to be too sticky, but after we used some extra flour to thin it out, it worked just fine. Thanks for the recipe! Will make this again.

This is a great pizza dough.  I have been using this recipe for about a year.  I have not had a pizza delivered to my house since then.  I make this about twice a month.  I do add some Italian seasoning and sometimes I think I use a little more flour than the recipe calls for but otherwise I keep it the same.  My family loves it.  I put the dough in my warm car out in the driveway to rise and can sometimes cut that time down.  I use a 1/2 sheet pan lightly greased with evoo and have enough dough for another pizza on the stone.  That one is usually the adult pizza with things like feta and spinach or whatever the kids might not like.  For an easy sauce I just give a quick buzz to a can of Italian tomatoes with the hand blender.  I do not roll out the dough either I just spread it out with my fingers.  This recipe has turned out well every time. It is really worth the extra time.

This was the best pizza crust that I made so far from this website. I put too much sauce on though :( This is definately a keeper!

This was a very good pizza crust!  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and it turned out great!  I made a huge pizza and could easily be two mediums pizzas.

This pizza crust recipe is AMAZING! It's a no fail crust that always turns out great. I've had to make a couple alterations the first few times I made it due to time constraints and surprisingly it was still delicious and a huge hit with the family. When it's made following the recipe exactly though, it cannot be beat! It's so soft and fluffy on the inside but light and crispy on the outside. It even makes delicious leftovers! Thank y so much for sharing this recipe. We make pizza once a week instead of buying now that I've found this awesome recipe!

This was a good, easy recipe.  I didn't thin it out enough, and ended up with VERY thick dough...but it was still very good!

This recipe yields a really soft crust, and the only change I made was to double the sugar. I made two 9.5" pizzas with this, but I think two 10" pizzas will be even better, as the crust was a little thick. This is my permanent go-to recipe for soft pizza crust.

Super easy, & super tastey! I spread garlic butter on the crust. I also cooked the dough for around 10 mins before tooping it, because I don't like my cheese browned, it worked out very well =)

The best Pizza Crust I have ever made and I make alot of homemade pizza.  The only thing I do with all recipes is I put the crust in the oven without toppings on it and cook it just long enough to set the dough, and then I put the toppings on.  Great tasting crust, thanks for the recipe.

This crust is perfect. The texture is exactly as was described, and directions were clear. Next time I will add a little more brown sugar and salt along with a couple of other spices because I thought it could use a little more flavor. That's my taste buds though. 5 stars because I love that I can adjust it to my family with little change. Really good recipe that I will use over and over for pizza, and will try as bread sticks too! Thanks Jay!

Used this crust for a lobster pizza. The crust was crispy outside and chewy inside. I will continue to use this crust recipe.

We will never order delivery again! This pizza crust is phenomenal.  I did everything EXACT except I made the crust into 2 rectangle shapes on one big baking sheet and came out with 2 pan pizzas, perfect.  My husband is a pizza fanatic and he is so excited that I have this great recipe now, thanks Jay!

I hate to be the party pooper, but I really wasn't very pleased with this crust.  The taste was okay, but even though I rolled it out very thin, it still puffed up way too thick for our liking.

This pizza crust recipe was fantastic!  I tried it for the first time when my son had a play date after school that was staying for supper.  I made the dough,but only had time to let it rise for about 1/2 hour.  It still turned out great.  There was a lot of dough! I let the kids (4 of them) each make their own pizza's and baked them on a pizza stone.  We did roll out the dough, but it was not like cardboard.  It still rose while it cooked and tasted great.  The rest of the dough I rolled out to somewhat of a rectangle and place it on a large cookie sheet, spreading the dough to the edges. Topped with sauce and toppings and baked.  This was the best home made pizza I have ever made!  I will definitely use this again and let the kids make their own pizza's this way instead of using canned biscuits covered with flour and rolled out.  It just tastes much better.  Just prepare for the time it has to rise when you start to make it! My error, but I can't wait to make it again! : )  Thanks for submitting!

Excellent pizza crust.  I used it to make one extra large pizza, but it was a bit too much for that, next time I think I'll do two medium ones.

I may never order pizza out again! This crust is so good, i have been spoiled. It definately makes 2 good sized pizzas. I used a pizza stone for the first time, which i highly recommend and they are quite inexpensive. Made one pepperoni and one Pizza Without the Red Sauce from this site. YUM!

Delicious alternative to store-bought doughs.  I used bread flour because it was all I had and it came out nicely.  I rolled one of the crusts too thin (and thus flimsy) to transport into the over so I just made a calzone, it was inhaled!

I have made a couple other pizza dough recipes and this is the best.  It is easy to make.  I made it with whole wheat flour and bread flour.  This will be the recipe I will use for all my homemade pizzas.

This is a great crust, very easy to make. I will make this again. Next time though, I'll brush on a little garlic butter. But my family enjoyed this and will continue to do so in the future.

This is a great crust.  It is very soft and chewy without being rubbery or excessively thick.  I made two good sized pizzas from this recipe, so it makes plenty for my family.  This is now my staple pizza dough recipe.

I really like this pizza crust! I've made it several times. Usually I make a double batch and freeze part of the dough for later use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I always have to add so much extra flour to make it useable. I make it in my Kitchen-Aid. So easy!

This crust was SOOOO good! We tried other recipes from here but none compared to this. The recipes makes enough for a Huge pizza or two normal sized ones. We didn't let it rise for the whole hour but it was still fantastic.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!! I made three large pizzas with this recipe for just a few people for New Year's Eve, and I didn't have even one piece left. Also, they pointed out (and I feel the same) that they don't really care for homemade pizza crust, but this one was good. Thank you so much!

Incredibly easy and successful! I made this two ways - with 1 c whole wheat flour instead of one of the cups of AP flour and the way it is written.  A success both times!

This didn't turn out so well for me. I underestimated the size which left me with essentially a loaf of bread with a thin layer of toppings. The crust tasted good and I'll try this recipie again, next time making two large pizzas.

This was very good.  Followed the advice of some others and did this in the bread machine, could not have been easier.  I did proof the yeast as directed, then added the other ingredients.  I only did half the recipe but used closer to 2 cups of flour.  This dough was very easy to work with.  I did prebake for 7 min on a preheated stone.  I used this to make the buffalo chicken pizza and it too was great.  While the crust didn't get too brown the taste and texture were very good.

excellent crust! can be made very thin or thick and chewy. perfect every time.
I tend to switch out half the flour for whole wheat, make 2 or three batches and freeze them for later.
Love it.

This is a family fav.  I think we have begun a family tradition of doing homemade pizza on Christmas eve...and by request a week later for New Year's eve!

My first time trying this - it was sticky and I kept adding flour. But I put all the dough on a pizza stone and it turned out very good. I will definately keep trying this crust until I get it down!

Undeniably the best crust out there.  I knew when I was putting the ingredients together that this was a dough that would be easy to work with.  I only added some italian seasoning and garlic powder.  It rose beautifully and rolled out so smooth.  I will never, ever use a different dough recipe.  Well done Jay!

This has turned into my regular pizza crust recipe because it is so good. I follow the recipe exactly and get moist, fluffy crust every time. I usually double the recipe to make bread sticks on the side.
You can't ask for a better pizza crust recipe.

This was the first recipe I used when I learned to make dough. After making a few tweaks it comes out perfect. The first few times I struggled a bit with it being to sticky, and also it would get a lot of holes when I hand tossed it.   After watching a couple of youtube videos on making pizza....   I made a few changes such as... adding 3 tablespoons of oil, mixing in 3.33 cups flour right away, Putting it in a ziplock overnight with more oil in it (like in the video), then doing like the guy in the video does of not flouring the work surface but taking a bowl with flour and putting the flour right on the dough. After about 3 attempts I actually made a good pizza so give it a little time if you've never tried before.

This is the very first time I made my own pizza and even started from scratch. My bf and I love Pizza Hut pan style and this one turned out just right! Crunchy edges but tender and moist on the inside....emmmm...mm! I seperated the dough in half and made two medium-size super supreme pizzas. My bf said they were just like Pizza Hut's ones but my ones were better with fresh ingredients, less oil, less salt, and made with love. A million thanks to you, Jay! I wish I could give you a million stars too.

Very good crust, chewy in the middle, bakes well at the lower rack of the oven so the toppings do not get overly done before the crust browns and crisp. Spread with pizza sauce, sliced mushroom, sprinkle some olive oil, some Italian seasonings and generous topping of cheese...great recipe.

This was my first time making pizza crust, and as I covered my dough to let it rise, I was sure I had ruined it. I was wrong! Even a novice chef could pull this off. It turned out very nicely given the ease of preparation. I would like a little more flavor, but I will definitely make this again to see how it can be tweaked. Thanks, Jay!

Wonderful Pizza Crust recipe!  The best around.  Don't hesitate to use this tried and true recipe.  As others have mentioned, I did bake the dough for 10 minutes prior to putting the toppings.

Excellent! My boyfriend HATES home-made pizza (just found out last night after 5 years LOL!) but he said it was pretty good and was one of the better home-made pizzas he has ever had. I brushed some melted parmesan garlic butter on the crust before and during baking. However, I would recommend to add more flour than the 2 1/2 cups before you turn out the dough, I had quite the sticky mess for a while and added so much flour to get the right consistency it would have been easier to just mix in some of the additional flour before moving to the next step. Should have used my dough hooks and stand mixer, maybe that will help next time. Excellent crust though, would recommend to bake for a bit before adding toppings if using a standard metal pizza pan. This makes a great pizza!

Thia is easy to make, less complicated than I first thought. I used the dough hook on my Kitchen Aid and it worked great.
After you put in the 2+ cups of flour you just have to "wing it" adding a little more flour at a time until it is no longer sticky. Easy to work with, used a dark 11x17 pan @ 400 degrees for 20-25 min. I still need to keep looking for a good sauce  I have heard that Contadina makes good pizza sauce.

This is the best crust that I have made so far.  I made the dough in my bread machine, and it came out very sticky.  I added a little more flour as I shaped the dough.  The whole family enjoyed it!

Yes Children ( Like Chef on South Park ) this is an outstanding recipe. Made 4 crusts.  2 failed ( edges were like bread stix ); the other 2 were pure success.  The difference you may ask ? Olive Oil the crust edges prior to baking.  Just like baking any pie.  Good stuff Jay... you did it for me and my crew.

It had a really good texture.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and it still turned out well. I topped it with BBQ sauce, chicken, peppers, spinach and cheese.  My family really liked it.

This made a very nice crust.  I think I will try adding some garlic or herbs for a little more flavor.  I used part white flour and white wheat flour.  Thanks!

I have never made any sort of dough in my life.  And usually when bread enters the oven at our house I end up burning it..  But not today!!  The pizza I made was incredible.  I doubt we will ever being ordering and bringing home anymore pizza!  Jay's Signature Pizza Crust was the way to go.  It was very easy to make.  However I think I added a lot more flour than the recipe called for still it came out great! We will be making this again and again!

I am an idiot when it comes to bread and pizza dough. Somehow, even with store bought dough, I always have a problem with the dough being soft in the middle, and the cheese burning away LOL. I don't think I did this recipe correctly, and I promise to try it again next week with an update. It definitely has potential and if this many people are raving about it, it has to be me! I used a stand mixer, and when I had used all the 3 1/2 cups, it was still way to sticky to touch, so much that I had to plop it out from the mixing bowl to my oiled bowl, and after an hour or so I had to pour 1/4 cup flour on top of it and all over my hands and knead it through to roll it out. I used 2/3 of it on my 12" pan. I put it in at 325 degrees for 10 minutes, then removed it, topped it, and put it on the lower level for another 17 minutes at 425 degrees as someone else had suggested. To me, it was dryer than I would have liked, but I am guessing it is bc of that extra flour and because of how I baked it. I did add oregano and garlic salt to the dough, and I even put EVOO and garlic butter sprinkle glazed all over the crust, still dry. This DEFINITELY deserves a second shot, and I'll be happy to post the results bc next time I"m just going to do it EXACTLY as the recipe says even if my intuition says to add more flour or bake it differently. I'll be back!!

We enjoyed this recipe and I think I will use this again.  It was waaaay too thick of a pizza to use the whole batch for one pizza how the directions suggest.  I think this would be good for 2 pizzas with a thick crust or 3 pizzas with a thinner crust.  Thanks for the good recipe!

I've tried making this recipe 3x now.  The first two times it turned out horrible!  Soggy in the middle, blah blah blah, you know the story.  The third time I tried it a year later, I took some suggestions by baking the pizza for 10 minutes first.  I did try the cornmeal idea but it didn't really work, I don't think I added enough Olive Oil for it to soak into the crust, so I probably won't do it again.  But finally the crust turned out decent enough.  I had tried some small cake pans to make deep dish crusts and make them individual.  Needless to say the crust was a bit thick on the outside, but it made 3 little pizza's, and it turned out not half bad.  I think the biggest thing was to bake the pizza for 10 minutes first.  My husband didn't mind it, and I think with a bit more practice I could get it to a five star, but till then I am only going to rate it a 4.  Oh and if you're going to add spices to your dough you might need to add a bit more then you think.  I added Garlic Powder and Italian seasoning but you couldn't even taste it in the dough, so the dough was a bit more on the bland side, I think the next time I try it Im going to try a lot more spices to pep up the crust a bit.

This is now the only recipe I use! After many a trial-and-error with other recipes, I have found the winner! So many doughs have an overly yeasty taste, or are tough, hard to roll out, or dry. This pizza crust is great thick, or rolled out thin. It stays nice and chewy and never has that yeasty taste that I think ruins the home-made doughs.
I have used 1 tsp garlic powder, plus half a tsp each of dried basil and oregano, or kept is simple with a tsp of italian seasoning. It is also great with finely minced garlic added to the dough. I never have trouble getting it to stetch to fit virtually any size pan... it stretches easily with no annoying spring-back. I make the dough in my kitchenaid mixer before a final hand-kneading, and bake on convection setting. We are now using this recipe weekly.
Outstanding!

This pizza crust turned out exactly as I hoped/expected - crispy yet chewy, with a nice flavor (not a flour taste like some other crusts I've made from scratch). I put it in the oven by itself for about six minutes before adding the toppings and the center turned out just right.

Very good basic recipe. If you follow it the way it's written (don't forget to proof the yeast!), it comes out very tasty. Garlic, oregano, and basil can be added to 'spice' up the crust a bit. Sometimes I'll use the recipe for plain ol' loaves of bread. Having a stand mixer is great for being lazy.

I've been using this crust for the past few months since I found it, and people are always asking for the recipe! The only thing I did differently was add some Italian seasoning. Otherwise, it's perfect just the way it is!

This is absolutely the BEST Pizza Crust you will ever fix.  My husband said "don't ever fix a different one", and my mom said "you make them, I'll sell them", very good.

After reading the fabulous (and helpful) reviews for this recipe, I decided to make a pizza for the very first time. I halved the recipe to make one medium pizza. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt, and following others' recommendations, I brushed the crust with olive oil and baked it at 325 degrees F for 10 minutes before adding the toppings. After adding tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperonis, I baked the pizza on a low oven rack at 425 degrees F for 16 minutes. I ended up with a golden brown crust without burning the toppings. My only complaint is that the pizza was a tad bit too oily for me, but then again, it is a pizza. Overall, the crust was very tasty, making my first home-made pizza a great success!

This was a great crust, I pre baked it for 7 mins, then i spread some garlic butter on it, then put all my topping on it and baked it for 15 more mins perfect, i paired this with the esquisite pizza sauce.  I spread it really thin but it still puffed it and was huge.  I used the leftovers to make bread sticks and spread garlic butter and garlic powder on top.  yumm-o

Very good, but like other reviewers I also found it was very "sticky" and need ed to add more flour.  I put in about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning just to add a little something more to the dough.  I baked my pizza in a 13x9 pampered chef stone cookie sheet.  It didn't seem to want to brown and it was pretty thick around the edges.  Made a good deep dish pizza, but we like a little thinner crust.  I will probably make it again.  We all seemed to like it.  Used the exquisite pizza sauce recipe found on this site and we had a very good dinner.  It was a little work, but was fun to say I made the entire pizza by myself.  Our 16 month old grand daughter loved it.  We had to stop her from eating it.

Pretty good for my first try at making pizza dough, though the process was a bit messy. I added more flour then called for since with the initial measurements the dough was so runny. UPDATE: Using the Kitchenaid stand mixer + the dough hook is a million times easier then kneading it yourself! I have made this recipe countless times since first discovering it. I found the taste to be the same, with manually doing it versus using the mixer. The measurements seem to be spot on this way too. 5 stars, everyone loves this recipe!

This was the kind of crust I would expect to find in a fancy pizza restaurant... it was really amazing; I had quite a few accidents while making it but it turned out fabulous anyway.  The only adjustment I'll make next time will be to bake the pizza at a lower temperature, because part of the crust wasn't cooked at all.  With all the cheese I'd put, you didn't notice it so much, but still.  Better make it perfect. :)

It was fairly tasty, but not great with my veggie pizza.  I made a half batch with whole wheat flour and 1/4 tsp basil added.  It smelled great while I was making it, but I think the whole wheat overpowered the basil flavor.  It rolled out to a very thin 16" circle.  My husband liked it, but I like mine thicker.  It didn't rise very much after it baked (hence it being thin crust). Overall, a pretty good recipe.

Very very good! I didnt realize the dough would rise so much, so my crust was very thick and next time I will make sure to roll it much thinner, but still excellent. A hit with the family and I plan to make again! A keeper.

Amazing crust!  I had to cut the recipe in half to fit a 16 inch pizza pan.  I think the key is the well oiled bowl used for rising.  The dough soaked up some of the EVOO I used to oil the bowl.  The oil made the dough easier to work with.  Beautiful thick pan pizza crust.

Pretty good. I actually add 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup olive oil & an extra 1/4 cup flour. Gives it a good flavour. 1 tsp dried Basil & oregano added in with the flour also gives a good flavour kick.

It was very easy to make and tasted great.  The outside crust was crispy and inside it was soft and a little chewy.  I rolled the dough out on a pizza stone sprinkled with corn meal.  My two year old had fun putting the toppings on and viola... 20 mins later -- pizza!  yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I add some italian seasoning mixed herbs to this crust, and I use cornmeal on the pan to give it a pizzeria-style bottom, but the recipe is fantastic!

Fantastic!! I doubled the recipe to make 3 very yummy thick crusted pizzas. I did precook them for about 5 minutes before I put the toppings on.
My new bread machine doesn't handle making big batches of dough so I tried making this by hand and was very impressed with how easy it was.
Thanks so much!!!

As close as you can come to Pizza Hut's pan pizza as you can get without ordering in or going to the restaurant.  Great as cold pizza the next day too.

Good flavor, but would follow other member suggestions by precooking the crust before adding the toppings.

Super easy to work with.  I grilled mine on the barbeque and made a chicken alfredo pizza. The crust was wonderful. You need to make this crust!

This makes an absolutely perfect classic pizza crust.  Out goes my old recipe.  I preheated my pizza stone & followed advice to adjust my oven rack to the lowest possible position.  This produced a crust that was crisp, but not burnt on the bottom and tender inside.  I baked mine at 450 degrees for 10 minutes.  And this definitely makes two very good sized crusts.  Try the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site.  It's another winner.

This dough was super easy and very tasty.  My only gripe, and the reason that it is getting four stars, is that the dough actually puffed up too much.  However, I attribute this to the fact that I used too much dough in the pizza versus a fault with the actual dough.  

Long story short: great recipe for anyone who wants to make pizza at home!

This is a wonderful recipe that we have been using for several years now! The only suggestion I would make would be that we bake the crust by itself for a few minutes before we put the toppings on and toss it back in the oven for a final baking. This helps keep the pizza from getting too soggy. Of course we add lots of toppings (6+). If you are only adding a few you probably wouldn't need to do this.

Really easy to make and tastes great. I topped it with Alfredo sauce, a sauté of garlic, shallots, onion, red peppers, and chicken and used a standard cheese mix.

Good, not great.  The dough was very sticky and I had to us a lot of extra flour to be able to kneed it.  I will probably try this again and will add some stuff to spice up the dough a little.  I think that it is also really important that you use a great sauce and great cheese too.

Awesome crust!  i sprinkle some italian seasoning in the crust mixture before kneading it.  I also bake the pizza on one of the lower racks to make sure it's a little crispy....otherwise it's just too soggy for me.  We love it!

It was a great recipe but it lacked flavor.  If I had to do it again I would brush the crust with olive oil and add some spices to the dough.  Other than that it was pretty good.

This was the best pizza crust I have ever made. It does make a huge crust, so I made it fun for all and let each family member create their own personal pizza. As other reviews suggested I too baked it for about 10 minutes before adding the toppings. Be creative with your toppings. Enjoy!!!

Great on the grill.  Cooked on an oiled grill, over indirect heat and it took longer than I anticipated (20 - 30 mins) but came out fabulous. Crunchy on outside, moist and chewy on inside.  Paired with the "exquisite pizza sauce" on this site which was also delish.  Enjoy!

This was an ok dough... not great but not bad.  It was too much dough and I thought I made a mistake and this recipe was supposed to make two.   But when I checked the recipe only indicated one pizza.  I made a 16 inch... maybe it's for a two-footer?
Also it didn't have a lot of flavour

Made pizza for the first time last night with this recipe and it was great! Soft and chewy and the slightest bit crunchy.  Instead of letting it rise the extra 15 minutes, I just put it in the oven for 5-6 minutes to brown before I put the toppings on.  Made the recipe exactly as is, except I halved it (8 servings) because I'm only cooking for 2.  Made one nice pizza crust!  Next time I'll add some spices to it.  Don't have a pizza pan or stone, so I just spread it out in a round with my fingers on my cookie sheet.

I have never made home made pizza crust before so I had no clue what I was doing but apparently this recipe is fool proof.  I used a jelly roll pan with the intent of splitting this into two crusts but there wasn't really enough so I ended up with one very thick crust pizza.  It was soft and chewy and really delicious.  Next time though I will use two round pans and split it in two or use a large size jelly roll pan.  

I baked it for a few moments as suggested and then put the toppings on and baked for another few minutes.  I then put the cheese on and baked until the cheese was golden brown and bubbly. I was worried that it wouldn't be fully cooked because it was so thick but it was cooked perfectly.

thanks for the recipe!

This was a lot of work for the return I got.  The end result was good and sometimes I like making things just because I can.  I would use this recipe if I was going to make my own crust again, I just think a mix from the store is just as good.

This dough came out bland. If you are going to bake your pizza on a stone you need to divide the recipe in half. My pizza was way too thick. There are better recipes out there.

I would by lying if I said this wasn't so EASY and so GOOD. I got rave reviews from my sister, her boyfriend, and my own boyfriend. The only thing I did different is added some italian seasoning and some garlic powder to the crust. I also prebaked the crust for 10 minutes before I put on the toppings. It came out perfectly. I will never buy canned or boxed pizza dough again.

This was a good starting recipe.  I added seasonings like garlic, basil, oregano, etc. to make it my own.

Wow.  I made the dough the night before and wrapped it up in saran wrap and put it in the fridge.  The dough broke through the saran wrap!  I punched it back down and placed it in a rubbermaid container and 8 hours later it had pushed the lid off the container!
I really liked this dough.  My kids LOVED it.  The crispy edges were great.  
I really like the fact that it was a good dough to make ahead of time but make sure you put it in a container instead of saran wrap!

My first pizza crust! This was a terrific and easy recipe. I make homemade breads but had not tackled the pizza crust. I don't know what I was so concerned about. This turned out great. I brushed the edges with olive oil and it was loved by all!!

Easy Recipe.  Other than the cheese got too done, it was good.  It did lack taste.  I would make it again but might add more salt or italian seasoning.

Prebake the crust a little even if you are using a pizza stone. My toppings cooked before the crust was brown. The crust was very good though and I am making it again today for lunch and doing it a little differently.  Even though I put to much sauce on it and my cheese was overcooked, my 7 year declared " This is really good."  The crust itself is easy and tasty.

Excellent!  My family loved this so much.  I made one with just pepperoni for the kids (they are picky) and another one with more toppings for us.  The dough was enough for two.  I'd be proud to serve it to dinner guests without hesitation.  I may play with it as far as adding a little more salt and other seasonings to the crust in the future.  Thanks Jason!

This is a great crust recipe.  I like to use about 1/2 cup of white wine instead of water...... it lends a greater flavor!

This recipe is the base for all my homemade pizzas.  I add pizza seasoning, garlic powder, and a bit of oregano to the flour before adding it to the wet ingredients... the outcome is a perfectly seasoned pizza that goes with all the toppings I have tried.  Mmm!

Delish...5 stars plus!!  We are a faithful Friday night pizza family (typically McCain Crescendo/Kraft Delissio, etc), but every now and again we like to make our own (usually buy the pizza dough at the store!).  I have looked at this recipe on numerous occasions and wanted to try it.  I made the dough around lunch time and put in the fridge, brought out again just after 5pm to let it proof for a couple of hours (since it was well chilled).  Rolled it out and used a large stoneware bar pan since the recipe yields a large dough.  We always use stoneware for our pizzas as they cook them beautifully (normally the round pizza stone).  This was perfect in my barpan (Pampered Chef) and I liked the raised 'edge'.  I did not add any additional seasonings to the dough as I always season the actual pizza, so added oregano, granulated garlic and pepper along with our toppings.  Needed about 30 mins to bake and the result was AWESOME, perfectly crisp, yet still tender...gotta love stoneware!!  I used 2 cups white flour and 1 1/3 whole wheat.  Beats any store bought or ordered pizza...YUM!

Way too much work for the lack of taste. I had so many problems with this dough. It was sooo sticky. I had to add so much flour that it made it too odd. I don't know what the problem was but I don't think I will ever try this again.

Fabulous texture and cooks evenly. I just wish I could make it more flavorful without adding spices. I used it with a buffalo chicken pizza topping and it was good. (mixed gorgonzola, cream cheese and peppercorn ranch dressing to make a sauce and added chicken cooked in hot sauce with onions to the top. topped with a combo of american and cheddar cheese- just a mixture of things I had on hand.)-

Wow! Nice crust...great to work with.  I did prewarm my pizza stone before putting on the crust after 1st rise (sprinkled corn flour over stone and took a fork and punched holes around the pie)...then baked it about 5-7 min. and then added all the pizza toppings and baked until pizza was done.  When it came out after the pizza was done, I seasoned the crust with olive oil/garlic salt/parm. cheese.   Yum!

This crust looked beautiful and was very easy to make.  I wish that I had listened to the comments that suggest adding spices.  I've never added any flavoring to dough before (other than salt or sugar), but this definitely needs some garlic or onion powder and maybe some Italian seasoning.  

It came out a little dense, but I think that was because I put a lot of flour down when kneading, to avoid sticking.  I substituted 1 c. wheat flour for 1 c. white flour, to make it a little healthier.

With a few modifications, I'd give it 5 stars.

This recipe is perfect! It makes one 16" "family" size pizza or 4 personal size pizzas.  I spray the pan with garlic flavored PAM before putting the dough on it and it never sticks.

Great crust I cook the pizza on the bottom rack until the crust is brown (about 8-10 min) than move to the middle or top to cook the toppings.  Don't over flower it is ok if it is a little sticky

The crust rose up beautifully and was perfect.  The only thing I'd change is I'd add a little seasoning because it was a bit bland. Otherwise- it was great.

This was a great success.  I added garlic powder, italian herbs, and parmesean cheese to the pizza dough.  I made one pizza and I used the other half to make "Pizza Hut"-like breadstick with garlic butter, italian herbs and parmesean cheese.  For the sauce I used spaghetti sauce.  I also substituted a cup of wheat flour.  Like many other, I had to add a lot of flour to reduce the stickiness.

This was a good all-around pizza crust...but I personally prefer the taste & texture of Pizza Crust for the Bread Machine II.

I wish there were more stars for this recipe..... it makes me a star everytime I use it. To make it a little more my own I add garlic and italian seasoning to the crust. thanks for such a great, easy recipe. My 5 yr old nephew loves to help me make the pizza. His mom asked if his pizza was good? He said " no my pizza is delcious". It's the only pizza he will eat, is what he made.

I didn't really enjoy this crust.  It seemed like it was missing something - too bland.  I've been making my own pizza dough for years that I love so perhaps I just wasn't prepared for how different this one was

This was fantastic!  I turned half into 4 individual calzones tonight and I froze the other half to use for pizza next week.  I was worried it wasn't going to turn out (I've had spotty luck with yeast dough in the past) but I used a thermometer and followed the directions to a T: after it doubled in size, I knew it was going to be perfect!  I baked the calzones 2 at a time in a 425 oven for 20 minutes on a preheated pizza stone and the exterior was crusty and delicious and the inside was soft and chewy just like the description.  Thanks for the recipe, no more store bought dough for me!

This was wonderful!  My husband said it was the best crust he has ever had - previous ones that I made were too dry and flavorless.  I used one cup of whole wheat flour and the texture and flavor were perfect.

Much easier than the old pizza dough recipe I was using before. Taste much better, too! Soft and chewy inside. We kept half of the dough in the fridge for a couple hours, but it tasted just as good.

I think the only thing I would do is decrease the water in the recipe.  It makes a nice dough but I always have to add A LOT more flour than the recipe says to remove the stickiness.

This was my first attempt at making pizza and it turned out pretty well. The crust ended up being a little dry but overall it was good. My sister loved it but I think I'll stick to buying my pizzas in the future.

This recipe is great for a soft, easy pizza dough that tastes really good for as simple as it is. I don't work with yeast very often, but it really turned out great. I used one cup of bread flour and the rest all purpose flour. It make it a little bit more doughy, which I'm not sure I'll do next time. However... its soft and really good. I made the easy pizza sauce off this site, for one cheese pizza, then I used the 2nd crust for the Buffalo chicken pizza off of this site. Both turned out great. Thanks!

The Curst is crispy on the bottom and chewy on top - IT IS AWESOME!!!!!  I do recomment baking it on the bottom rack in the oven so the crust gets done the same time as the toppings.

This crust was awesome!  First time ever making pizza crust and it couldn't have worked better...I added a little bit of Italian Spices and Garlic Salt to the olive oil with the salt and it made the crust taste perfectly seasoned!  Although it's not quick this recipe is so worth the little bit of time involved!

OMG...This pizza crust ROCKED!  I used bread flour, set the oven too 200' turned it off, and put the dough in for about an hour.  Easier way for me to have it rise.  I also added italien seasoning & garlic powder.  Cooked up perfectly on my stone!!!!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!!

Excellent crust! Easy to make. I made mine with my kitchen aid mixer and dough hook (no kneading). I don't have a pizza stone, so I oiled and lightly dusted the pans with cornmeal.Turned out great!

Really good, basic crust.  I'm not a very good yeast user, but I was surprised at how fail proof this was.  Makes a nice bready, chewy crust.

Great recipe! This made enough for a nice thick crust large pizza tonight.  It could easily be halved and made into 2 medium thinner crust pizzas.  I added 2 tbsp. Italian seasonings for extra flavor and also precooked for about 10 minutes before adding toppings.  Advice:  make sure and brush with olive oil to the edge of the crust so the edges will come out softer. I will be definitely be making this again. Even though I make it by hand, it's a cinch to put together.  Awesome recipe, Jay, thanks!

We made this pizza with "EASY PIZZA SAUCE I" from this site. This was the best pizza ever! Excellent! Per comment suggestions, I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, oregano and basil to the dough.  Since we all like different toppings, we made individual pizza's using pie pans.  The dough made 4 pie-pan pizzas.

This was an amazing crust!! I made 1 small thin crust and 2 deep dish pizza's with it. Everyone loved it. I did need more flour then recipe called for but I never work off flour amounts from the recipe. Every flour is different and it depends on the weather as well. It was a nice soft dough and very elastic. Streched out really nicely. The thin crust was really crisp on the bottom and the crust had great bite. The deep dish came out really soft and not soggy at all. The bottom and sides got crisp while the inside stayed soft and fluffy. This is my new pizza dough recipe.

Okay, I've tried alot of pizza crust recipes and always ended up with something thick and heavy.  I was just about to give up, then I found Jay's recipe.  Love it! This is as good as the pizza shops.  I make the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" to go with the crust.  Excellent.

I have made this twice now and you really can't go wrong with this recipe.  The second time I added in some fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, garlic powder, and a little basil....Oh the crust was so delish!

It was simple and easy to make.  I will add some onion and garlic powder to the dough next time, as the crust was a little on the bland side.  however, i would definitely reccommend it.

Wow, it turn out pretty good.  It'll turns out better if you roll out the dough and let it sit more then 1/2 to rise and then top it up.

This is the first thing I made for my husband (recently married), and I am so proud of myself!  I used this crust recipe to make him Tabasco Pizza; we love spicy food.  He thinks this is a great pizza crust recipe, and so do I :)  Thank you so much for the recipe.

Well, this is by far the best pizza crust I've ever made. I won't be using any other recipe. I made it last Friday and it turned out great. My son now wants every Friday to be pizza night and to use this recipe. It's so easy that I don't think I'll ever buy ready-made pizza's again. I made this with Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site and went really well w/ it.

My one year old eats this pizza like cookie monster eats cookies.  She chows down and when she is done with one piece, she panics and cries for another piece.

Fantastic Crust, I make it once a week.

It seems the more I make it, the more I get the "feel" for the perfect consistency for the dough.  Once I got it down, perfect pizza after perfect pizza!  

Thanks!

This has now become the pizza crust recipe I use whenever I bake pizza.  This recipe is so versatile, because I have used it with different types of flours and herbs with it turning out perfectly each time.  I've also used it to make pizza rolls, pizza bread, and pizza pinwheels.  When baking pizza with it, I love how this yields a thicker crust since that is what my husband and I prefer!  Thanks for an awesome recipe :-)

Fantastic crust.  Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  I used my Kitchenaid mixer, which made it very easy.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasonings as recommended by other reviewers.  It was the best pizza crust I've ever made!

Best crust I have ever made.  I always need  more flour than the recipe calls for.
Also, I find baking it 10 minutes in the pan and then 10 minutes directly on the rack gives you the perfect crust, not too crispy and not too soft.

This was such a good crust! Not too thick, not too thin. Crusty and chewy at the same time. It made a lot of dough--enough for a big pizza and garlic knots and even some cinnamon rolls! 

This was a crowd pleaser! My super picky 2 year old scarfed it down, and my even pickier boyfriend ate half the pizza! 

My only complaint was that it was kind of bland. Next time I think I'll add more salt and some garlic, maybe some oregano. 

I also had some trouble getting the dough to rise enough, as it's pretty cool in my apartment. I put the bowl in the oven, covered with foil, set on the lowest setting (200 degrees) for about 15 minutes, and that really helped!

i made this in my bread machine. i read the review that said that the dough was a little too sticky when she made it in the bread machine so i decreased the amount of liquid by 1/8 of a cup. The consistency was good this way. This crust was good but went quite hard around the edges. That may be due to my longer baking time. I put the pizza crust in the oven for 5 minutes before i put the toppings on so that may be why. i would make this again but make the crust thicker and only make one pizza instead of trying to stretch it to make 2.

This made the best pizza crust.  I have never made my own crust before until now.  I will never by one again.  But next time I will either make two pizzas or cut the recipe in half.  I used my large pizza pan and it was still too much dough.  There is only two of us, so we will be having pizza for lunch this week.

This was awesome crust and I plan to use only this recipe in the future.  I added Italian seasoning to the oil coated bowl, b/c I forgot to add it to the flour before mixing, and it worked out great. I baked it in a Pampered Chef large bar pan and it was perfect.

I added 1 t. Italian seasoning and 1/4 t. fresh cracked black pepper to the dry ingredients to give it more flavor.  Topped it with about 1 to 1-1/2 c. jarred spaghetti sauce.  Next was 12 oz. cooked and crumbled turkey Italian sausage, 1/2 c. chopped sauteed red bell pepper, 1/2 c. sauteed  onions and 8 oz. sliced sauteed mushrooms.  I sprinkled 1/4 t. dried oregano over the top and 8 oz. fancy shredded mixed pizza cheese.  It made a full 1/4 sheet baking pan sized pizza, enough for 12 generous slices.  Wow, was it good!  We are not impressed with delivery pizza anymore after this.  Thanks, Jay.

I made this in my bread machine, and it turned out very well, albiet a little on the sticky side.  It was a bit of a challenge to stretch out to a large rectangle w/out creating holes, but we were eventually successful...we just had to flour & re-flour the surface and our fingers during the process.  Our plan for this dough was to make a Stromboli (rolled bread, stuffed w/ a 1/4 lb. each of thinly sliced deli-style boiled ham, hot Capicola, Genoa Salami, Sandwich-size Pepperoni, and Smoked Provolone Cheese).  This dough held together beautifully during the baking process.  Previously we'd always used store-bought doughs that have split or leaked during baking.  I must say that this dough performed really well.  It had good flavor, but next time I'll probably add some garlic & herbs to enhance the flavor a little more. I will make this dough again, and am looking forward to making traditional pizza with it.

This is THE BEST pizza crust recipe I have ever made.  It's easy and turns out perfect.  If you are trying to decide on one from this site - USE THIS ONE.  Kudos to Jay.  I won't use any other recipe.

Very easy to make.  I took previous comments and used herbs in the dough I used for the pizza.  I used plain dough for the breadsticks.  Overall amoung the best pizza dough I've made myself.

Good crust & nice texture but extremely bland.  Definately needs some herbs & spices in the crust.

Excellent crust.  It was crispy on the bottom and fluffy in the middle, not gooey or soggy.  I substituted a little whole wheat flour for part of the white flour and doubled the recipe using my food processor to mix the dough.  My four children devoured it. My five year old said he liked it better than delivery pizza.

I really like this pizza crust.  There are so many options of what you can do with it, depending on the type of crust you like.  Plus is makes enough, that we can make a thin crust and a thick crust, depending on what we want.

Awesome recipe!  I never would have thought of using brown sugar instead of regular granulated sugar, and I'm not exactly sure what it did for the overall taste, but the pizza came out fabulous.  I halved the recipe since I had a regular sized pizza pan, let it rise and then sit as instructed, and then went straight into piling my sauce, cheese and toppings.  I didn't have a problem with soggy crust in the least; perhaps other reviewers used too much dough?  Remember that this one recipe as written is enough to make a GINORMOUS pizza!  Next time I'll see if I can add extra spices to the dough, or brush it down with a little extra olive oil to sprinkle some oregano and/or garlic powder before baking.  The texture was great, but the taste was a little generic.  The second half of my pizza dough, which I stuck in the freezer for later, won't last the week!

Fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly and its definately my best homemade pizza so far. Used a cookie pan this time, but will definately have to get a pizza stone and make it again to see the difference. This recipe is officially in my recipe box.

I'd never made pizza dough before, and this one turned out pretty good. It was easy to make. We all agreed that it was missing a little something, though--next time I think I'll add some herbs. Good basic recipe.

I made this dough up on Friday, and was able to make pizzas all weekend. The dough was a little sticky, but I just floured my hands and I was able to work with it. I Love the texture. I liked it best with the Way easy pizza sauce recipe on this site, although I also made it with the Exquisite pizza sauce also on this site.

This was a really good recipe, even though I'm not what I'd call a "baker".  For the inexperienced kneaders, I recommend that you flour well and don't forget your hands (ha ha)!  This recipe makes a lot of crust so don't expect to use it all.  Once I got the process down, this was a delicious crust that I would recommend to anyone.

AWESOME!!!  I've made this crust several times and who's ever over for dinner LOVES it!  I'm able to get 2 large crusts out of this recipe.  I've followed the directions as written.  I may play with it a bit next time only but adding some herbs and parmesan cheese.  Yummy!!

The absolute best homemade pizza crust recipe in the universe. We really, really like it. I usually let it rise a bit longer than the recipe calls for (like a half-day) to get more bang out of my yeast. It's great!

GREAT crust! I used it on the grill though and if I had it to do over I would add some extra flour to be sure it would not fall through the grill. This was not a recipe for grilled pizza crust so it was not the fault of the recipe. Loved the taste! Thanks...

This pizza crust is fantastic!!!!  I used in in conjunction with two other recipes on here (Chicago-style stuffed pizza & Easy Pizza Sauce III), and it complemented them perfectly!  Of course, I tweaked those other two recipes a little to make the pizza taste just right, but the pizza crust needed nothing done to it.  It was excellent just as it was!  5 stars!

My pizza's haven't been the same since.  I changed it up a bit and used wheat flower and threw some honey in to give it a twist.  Very good!

Yum! Perfect pizza crust recipe that is very customizable. The first time I made this I messed up pretty badly and added too much water and then of course had to add more flour to salvage it, and it STILL turned out great. (I just had to let it rise a little longer since there was less yeast.) It's exactly as described - chewy and crispy.

I made this at the weekend and was positively surprised. I made it with wholemeal flour and it turned out a bit dense. However, my boyfriend said it was still the best crust I've ever made. We baked it in an ovenproof dish and it turned out really crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside. Very yummy! Next time I will try it with half regular and half wholemeal flour. I hope that'll make it less dense. But overall quite good!

This is everything it says it is: crusty/crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Easily makes two crusts. I made it with the Veggie Ranch Pizza recipe and it was wonderful! I can't wait to make more pizza :-)

I made this recipe 5 years ago in my food science class in high school.  2 other girls and I just randomly picked a pizza crust recipe to make and this was it.  To this very day this recipe has still been the BEST pizza I have ever had!!  SO good!

I liked the fact that it's a thick crust, because I don't like thin pizza. However, it had no taste! Next time, if I do make it again, I will add some garlic and herbs to the dough. I also think that baking the dough before adding the toppings is a good idea, otherwise it will take forever to bake!

This recipe is the best. I make this recipe substituting half whole wheat flour and half whole wheat pastry flour and omit the brown sugar. It is perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

This turned out well for me.  I will make this again, but will pre-bake the crust for a few minutes before adding the toppings - I prefer a less doughy texture.  My 5 year old son loved making this with me.

AMAZING!!!!  I am a Peace Corps Volunteer living on an island that doesn't do the pizza thing.  I tried this recipe as I was CRAVING familiar food....it turned out better than any pizza dough I have ever had!  I have made it for other Peace Corps Volunteers as well as people in my community, EVERYONE gives it raving reviews!  (I of course spruce it up with my own ingredients, but not a whole lot)  GREAT recipe, thank you SO SO much, I have shared it with everyone I know!

Oh, wow! If you like a thick and chewy crust, you'll like this.  Followed the recipe and it was delicious.  Did bake on bottom rack for at least 5 minutes in order to get the crust done. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is really great pizza crust!! It's not the easiest or quickest to prepare but it tastes really good. It doesn't have that "homemade" taste other recipes Ive tried had. 
 I made it in a 13x9" glass pan as a deep dish and it turned out really really good. (I had a little extra dough so I made a 13x9 AND an 8x8)
 There was enough to feed the whole family, 6 of us, and we usually order 2 larges when we order pizza.

This crust is very good!  It has more flavor than some other ones that I have made.  I like the crispy bottom and chewy center.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! I made pizza a couple weeks ago with a dough recipe from Taste of Home magazine that was a 100 year old italian tradition, but didn't turn out that great. This was sooo much better. Some friends ended up coming over, and even the picky eater said it was delicious.

This was a terrific crust.  I split the dough into 4 parts and made pan pizzas.  It wasn't that thick of a crust, but was crispy and buttery and delicious. I did use cornmeal on the bottom of the pans I cooked them in.

This crust is indeed crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside, but I wouldn't go so far to say that it is "like" Pizza Hut's pan crust.  I had to add about 3 extra cups of flour for it to even resemble dough.  I will probably make it again, but I will brush it with olive oil before putting it the oven.

This crust came out really nice but for some reason it did not puff up alot, only slightly...which I think is probably a mistake on my part. I'll definitely try this recipe again though, it tasted great! The only thing I did different was pre-baking the crust for about 15 minutes on a low temperature before adding the toppings. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This is a fantastic crust!  It is a bit "time consuming" but worth the wait and effort.(Definately not a weekday meal at my house) My family would rather have homemade pizza than delivery.

This is a great crust!  I added some chopped fresh rosemary and oregano to the mix.  I also had to use 4 and 1/4 cup of flour before it was no longer sticky.  I baked the pizzas (the dough makes two 'normal sized' pizzas) on two silver cookie sheets for about 22 minutes each.  The crust was very tasty and not too thick or thin.

Great crust! We baked it on a pizza stone. It was a very thick crust. Light on the inside and crunchy on the outside. It rolled out very easy and had a wonderful taste. We have made it several times.

This dough was edible, but not great.  My 3-year-old turned up her nose at this pizza.  I think it needed lots more oil to taste anything like take-out pizza crust.

I wasn't completely satisfied with this recipe.  It was a little plain but it was easy.  I usually use a frozen dough but I am trying to find one made from scratch so there are no weird ingredients.  I will probably keep looking.

I really liked the flavor of this. I halved the recipe, since I didn't want two crusts. Unfortunatly the crust turned out too thin for our preference, so next time I'll just use the full recipe.

WoW!! All the reviews already say how excellent this pizza crust is...but WOW. I don't have a pizza stone since this is my first time making pizza but I used round cake pans lightly greased and dusted with flour, to make four individual pizzas. They turned out wonderful. I didn't have any problem with the flour. If you knead the dough it adds that additional flour without making the dough too tough. I also let the dough rise a couple hours extra. MMM...THANKS for the recipe.

This is the best pizza crust recipe I have found and I will be using it regularly from now on.  It had a wonderful taste and was chewy inside and crunchy on the outside, just as promised.  I ended up with two 10-inch pizzas last night and was very impressed.  Great job, Jason!

Maybe it was something I did, but this recipe left me completely unimpressed.  Not worth my time and effort.  I made this once and the kids still refer to it as the "night mommy made the yucky homemade pizza."  I'll keep calling the local pizzeria until I find a better crust recipe.  Sorry!

This is much, much better than store bought crust but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  I would probably experiment with adding some herbs or cheese to the crust next time I make it.  I made it in my breadmaker and it came out perfectly.  Would definately make it again.

Not too bad, fantastic texture, but very little flavor.  Did not brown at all, either.  I will try it again, but will bake the crust for a while before adding toppings.

DELICIOUS! It was a little "much" dough for a 12" pizza, but it DOES say "giant pizza crust". Excellent taste. I topped mine with chicken, alfredo sauce, plum tomatoes, and feta cheese. Crust was a breeze to make in the bread machine. THANK YOU!

liked it but did not love it. Took more flour than in the recipe. Didn't come out as crispy as I would have liked.

Excellent!  Made a perfect crust when dusted with cornmeal on the bottom.  I made this exactly as written, and it made two quite large crusts.

This is the perfect pizza crust for us!  My family have already requested it again.  This makes a giant pizza crust.  I made 1 large and 1 small (thicker crust, the way we like it) pizzas from it.

This is the best pizza crust I've ever made!  Beware:  this makes a lot.  You may need to alter the amount of flour depending on the humidity in your area.  I used this recipe to fill a jelly roll pan for a large pizza.  It turned out to be a pretty thick crust.  Next time, I think I'll divide it to use for two pizzas.

Too bready.  I like New York style crusts and this is just not thin or crisp enough.  It was easy to make, though.

This makes a decent crust. I had to work with it a bit, and I'm still tweaking the recipe, but all in all, I like it! It takes longer than an hour to rise for me, but that's not a big deal.

The flavor was good, but I would prefer a thinner crust.  I'll make again, but either separate it into 2 crusts or cut down the yeast.

I just made this with garlic chicken pizza.  I followed reviewer "wingnut68"'s reccommendations and added the pizza seasoning and garlic powder, I prebaked the crust and then topped and re-baked but it was doughy.  I think next time I will also make two crusts out of this.  I can't decide if it was the crust or the pizza toppings that we weren't crazy about.  My husband liked so I will probably try again with a few changes.

This was my first attempt at making pizza and it turned out great. 

I cut the servings to 10 and that was a pretty good size for my 9x13 cookie sheet.

Like others said you will probably want to add more flour in step 2, because it will still be very sticky if you use what the recipe says.

This didn't work out so well for me.  I found I could taste the yeast too much .. AND worst thing .. on a 13" pizza tray it essentially became a loaf of bread with pizza toppings on top.  Since I prefer thin crust I'm going to half it and the yeast on my next try.

The crust was too dense for my liking, but I am sure it was my lack of skills and not the recipe.  I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour to make a flour mix, which may have caused the problem.  I will definitely try it again.

This is a really good crust.  But even with cooking it on a pizza stone, I cannot get it to be like "take-out"...crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside...  Still, it is the best at-home pizza crust I have found.  We use it every week:-)

Another thumbs up for this recipe--mine cooked up perfectly, not too thin, not too thick, not overpowering but not totally bland.  I added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning.  I also ran out of all-purpose flour after adding about a cup and a half, so I added whole wheat flour for the rest and it came out beautifully.  It was sticky with the quantities given, but I added a little more flour (kneaded with my Kitchenaid mixer) and it was easy to work with.  It makes enough for two full-sized pizzas.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an easy recipe which requires a little work. I made two pizzas out of this, using 1 cup whole wheat flour instead to add some more nutrition, and it turned out great! Husband really enjoyed this crust.

Really good and really easy.  This was my first time making pizza crust and turned out perfect.  I made two pizzas out of the crust.  I also took the suggestions of others added garlic salt, italian seasoning to the crust.  Can't wait to make again.

I was very excited when I was making this crust.  I was rising great.  I had problems when I cooked it though.  I ended up cookiong it for half an hour and it was still doughy.  It may have just been my toppings.  It will try it agian though.  So many people like it that I must have goofed it up somewhere.

We loved it!  I used the entire recipe for one pizza pie and I think maybe next time I would probably use half.  It made a very thick crust! I would definately use this recipe again.

Good instructions, Jay.  I made this crust using King Wheat flour, instead of all-purpose.  I sprinkled cornmeal & cracked black pepper on my peel.      Have some fun practicing with the dough tossing!

I'm new to cooking and this was my first attempt at pizza crust - what a great recipe!  It's recipes like this, with complete and accurate instructions, that help new cooks gain confidence.  Thank you so much!  

I did two smaller pizzas w/one batch, topping both of them with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe you can find here, (minus the anchovey paste); one had mozzarella; one had grated parmesan.  They both turned out brown on the bottom chewy on the edge.  I'll make this again and again !

Although my crust didnt rise that much, it was pretty good. I made the crust for "Gourmet Chicken pizza" on the site. Next time i would let the dough rise more and perhaps add in some basil, rosemary, garlic powder, and oregono. A Keeper

Thought the dough tasted good.  I made mine on a 12 in pizza pan, but since the dough is pretty thick I may divide between two pans next time.

Awesome recipe!  I used the bread machine pizza dough setting and it turned out great.  I even had to refrigerate it for a few hours before cooking.  It turned out great but will definitely cook for 20 minutes next time on my stone (I only did 15).  We will have this again for sure.

I used this pizza crust recipe to make the garlic chicken pizza, submitted by Becky M, since I do not have a bread machine to make the crust that is suggested in her recipe. I brushed the crust with butter and then sprinkled garlic powder over the crust.  It made a nice thin crust since I made it in a large pan.  There have been times where I have divided the dough between two smaller pans.  This is a wonderful recipe!  I will use this often.  I have also given the recipe to other people.

I give this 4 stars only due to a lack of flavor in this crust. The crust was extremely easy to make and well worth it. Does make a thick crust but will try and do as a previous suggestion from 2/14/06 and not let it rise once it is on the pizza pan. We will not be buying store bought again!

Great simple pizza dough. However, don't try to make it in a pan smaller than 14 inches. I will definitely make it again.

Better than store bought and delivery.  I have never made my own pizza before this, so I can't compare to other recipes but this one was easy to make and tasted great.  I'll keep it!  Thanks.

Excellent, easy pizza crust!  I was using premade Boboli pizza crust, and didn't like it at all.  Found this recipe, and never have to buy premade again!

It was the first time I've used yeast.  Didn't give me any problems.  I just used my cooking thermometer to get the right water temperature.  I also made two medium pizzas out of this, cooked on a cookie sheet.  The bottom tends to stay undercooked, but it's still delish!

I've made this crust several times and I wasn't sure if I wanted to give this recipe 3 or 4 stars....It was super easy to put together, and that's a big selling point for me...However, as others have said, it is kind of bland.  Also, even if you roll the dough out thinly, it puffs up quite a bit, making it a bit too thick for our liking.  I've also found that rolling it out is extremely hard to do.  It always wants to shrink back up.  I tried brushing the outer edges with olive oil and a few different seasonings last time and it came out much more flavorful. Nevertheless, I'm actaully using this recipe tonight to make pizza just because it's the easiest one I've found out there.  Just make sure to add some salt/seasonings to it if you make it.

I'm not sure if this pizza crust is the best...or if I was just so amazed I could make pizza ?!  I divided dough and made lunch (cheese pizza) and will make bread sticks out of the other half... I am giving 5 stars because of the ease of this recipe and the flavor and texture of the final product...Thanks Jay!!

Definitely needed more flour, was a bit tough to work with. I tried 2 pizzas, deep dish and thin crust. Not enough flavor for the deep dish, but perfect for thin crust, will use again.

This is a good base. I added some butter to get a crust that is more flaky and also I added garlic, basil and oregano to the dough and let it sit. This provides flavor that really accents any pizza that is made and may resolve the blan issues other may run into. Thanks for the recipe!

This crust was awesome! I've never made dough for pizza before, and it turned out wonderful!! I experimented with both the bread machine and with a bowl, and both turned out great.  The thinner crust cooks better, though the thicker was good, too.  Will definitely make this again and again!!

This crust was great!  It was crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  As others have mentioned, I had to add in more flour, probably about a half cup.  I split the dough in half, making one thick medium size pizza, and freezing the rest.  I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe is excellent. I usually make it into two thinner pizzas. I also change some of the white flour for wheat flour for added flavor.

Hands down the best crust I have had.  I made a chicken-wing pizza as well a traditional one and they were both equally good.  When it was baking it smelled just like a pizza shop in the kitchen.  Will be my new crust recipe!!!

This crust was very good.  I made the dough in the bread machine and had to add more flour in order to get the dough thick enough.  It cooked nicely.  Next time I may try adding some garlic granules to the dough to add some more flavor.

This is excellent!  I've made my own crust before and was impressed then (that I could actually make a pizza at home, I guess).  This was a better crust; my sons asked if I'd make this more often.  Thank you!

I've tried this recipe twice before, and it didn't turn out, due mostly to my own error with the mixer.  This time, however, the crust turned out perfectly, chewy and crispy as everyone has described.  I divided the dough into 4 sections before the second rise, and rolled 3 of them to the varying thickness my family likes and topped accordingly, and made the last section into small breadsticks.  Excellent- definitely a crowd pleaser!

Do I really need to say this. Excellent.
I made two medium pizzas out of this. I didn't roll this into shape just divided the dough into two pieces and then moulded and stretched each piece to fit my pizza pans. Puffed up beautifully in the oven. My husband says no more store bought or takeout pizzas for us. Thanks

Very good, though it seemed to be missing something.  Maybe more salt?  More sugar?  I'm just not sure.  I thought the crunchy exterior and soft interior were excellent though.  I would not hesitate to prepare this again.  If you have the time, homemade pizza is fun and tasty.  I used a large pizza pan, with cornmeal on the pan--and there was no problem with crust sticking to the pan.

Tasty crust...don't have a pizza stone, so cooked on bottom rack for 15 minutes, then put it on the top shelf for last few minutes to get a nice golden brown on the cheese.  Yummy.

Oh man, this was SO good.  I made a bbq chicken pizza on it, using bbq sauce, canned pineapple tidbits, shredded mozarella, and precooked chicken breasts from the refigerator section of the grocery store.  The dough was a little too big for my pizza stone, so I rolled up the edges so it would fit.  My husband loved the way it turned out like a stuffed crust as a result.  This is becoming a Friday night tradition for our family, and it is cheaper and tastes way better than the take and bake pizza we used to get.  YUMMY!!!!

This was a very easy recipe and the crust turned out great.  We tried it out by making a thin crust and a traditional crust.  Both turned out excellent.

This is the best pizza dough recipe I've made. My husband and I have been in search of the perfect pizza dough recipe, and I think we've found it! Not only is the crust perfect, but the directions are clear and explicit, so that you really can't mess it up! I would highly recommend trying this recipe.

Yum!! Made this crust for a buffalo chicken pizza (recipe also found on this site) and it came out perfect. I used a medium size cookie sheet in order to have a thicker crust. I usually throw out the crust from pizza, but not this… I ate every bite!!

I thought this crust was good. It was just like the description slightly crusty outside soft on the inside However, I found the dough to be very difficult to work with and I ended up adding more flour. I will continue to search for one that is outstanding. Thanks I had fun!!

This dough was great!  I doubled the recipe and we made 4 smaller deep dish pizzas, Chicago-style.  The crust turned out great, the pizza was delicious.  This will be the only dough I make for pizza from now on.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a fantastic recipe.  Very easy to make, I don't understand why some had problems with it.  I did add some pizza seasonings to the mix before I added the flour, then used it to make a white pizza(sauceless).  I halved the dough, to save the other half, spun it out and put it on a medium baking stone..brushed with oil and minced garlic, cooked it at the recommended temp for 7 minutes, then topped, cooked for 12 more then broiled for a couple.. we used fresh mozzarella, fresh tomato, mushrooms, sausage, with a bit of goat cheese.  It was fabulous and as good as a lot of restaurants I've been at.

Good, but not outstanding.  I needed to add about 3 cups flour before starting to knead it.  It was way too sticky to touch with just 2 1/2 added.

Perfect.....absolutely perfect.  I made this dough in the bread machine and then baked it on a pizza stone.  I made the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site.  My son must have said at least a half a dozen times, "Mom, this is the best pizza I ever had!"

This is a great recipe. As mentioned in other reviews, it's a little dense, so try it thin-crust style....it's delicious! Also, feel free to spice up this recipe with some fresh or dried herbs and/or garlic. This will give the crust more flavor. I also had to let the dough rise longer than what's stated in the recipe. But all in all, great recipe!

Go, Jay, go! This is fantastic and easy, especially if you have a stand mixer with a dough hook.  I made a calzone filled with chicken breast, monterey jack, green chiles and salsa and it was fabulous.  Thanks for such a great dough recipe.

This is a great pizza crust, I ended up with a crispy crust on the outside, and a chewy inside.  I added some garlic powder to the crust which added great flavour, i also used vege oil since I didn't have any olive oil on hand, and it turned out fantastic, only used 3 cups of flour. Some words of advice, do not increase the cooking temperature, I did and it resulted in a burnt crust, turned down the temperature for the 2nd crust and it was perfect.  I halved the recipe to make two medium pizzas.

Came out great!  Next time I would bake it a little closer to 20 minutes than 15, since it came out a little soft on the bottom, but the flavor was great and it was relatively foolproof.

My husband loved this thick "deep-dish" pizza crust.  NOTE: because it is really thick, you may choose to make two medium pizzas.  If you use all the crust on a large pizza, the crust may not cook all the way through by the time the top of the crust is brown.

You can make thin or thick crust by letting it rise longer in a warm place. We spice up the flavor by sprinkling the pan with either Italian Herb Mix(Penzeys.com) or with a little Oregano and Rosemary before adding the dough. Always a hit!

The crust looked good but had no taste to it.  I'd never made a pizza my family wouldn't eat before.  Now I have.  They wouldn't even eat the leftovers for breakfast.

We used this crust for a pizza fundraiser for our youth at church. We made 37 batches (for 74 pizzas) and it worked beautifully and tasted even better.  It rises well in the refrigerator and freezes too.  I used the leftover dough at home to make garlic bread sticks.  They were great too!

The crust turns out the way its describe ;crispy on the outside,soft in the inside..Although the dough turns out mushy at first but after adding the balance flour,everything goes with the flow. The dough were beautiful.However,I substitude olive oil with sunflower oil..because i dont have any in hand.Anyway,just follow the steps given in the instructions and voila! note:I didnt make 1 giant pizza,instead i make 5 medium pizza.

very good, easy, and basic. It gives a good homemade taste and look to the pizza. I've made this so many times I've lost count. It's the only pizza crust recipe I use. However, I haven't had much luck using whole wheat flour.

This is probably one of the easiest best pizza dough recipes I've ever tried.  I use "way easy pizza sauce/bread stick dip" from here and just add my own cheeses and toppings. Everyone in my family loves it when I make pizza now.

This recipe is great! I followed it exactly, used a stone, and it turned out perfect! My guy told me to keep the recipe for this one. I think it would make great breadsticks or cheesy breadsticks with some seasoning.

This crust was great. I doubled the recipe because we have a large family and then broke it down into individual pizzas. It was a hit and will become our Friday night treat from now on! Thanks for sharing. Next time I'm going to try and add some spices to mix it up a bit.

this was super easy and tasted great. i made two large sized pizza's with the recipe. it works really well as a thin crust, not as much flavor when used as a thicker crust. but i will definitely use this for my thinner crust pizza's.

This is by far the best pizza crust I've ever made.  It tasted like UNO deep dish pizza:):) YUMMY!!  I did use an extra 3/4 cup of flour just to make the dough "not as sticky".  Even after 10 min of kneading the dough was still a little sticky.. but it came out good at the end anyway:)

Really good pizza crust.  I made this for my 5 year old and her friends and it went over so well.  I do think that you should bake the crust a bit before adding toppings, as the crust was a little light (in color) and the toppings were very done.  Great dough.  Easy and yummy!

Fantastic recipe!  I added a ton of spices to the dough to liven it up a little:  garlic powder, lots of oregano, basil, etc.  It sure did smell up the kitchen, but tasted sooooooo good once it came out of the oven.

I changed this recipe slightly, using 1 1/4 cups water, 3 cups flour and 1 1/2 packets of yeast.  The end result was good, but it made a lot of dough so next time I think I'll use 3/4 cups water, 2 cups flour and 1 packet of yeast.  That should be good for two people, especially as I prefer to use it for thin crust pizza.  The thick crust version is a bit bready.

This crust was delicious.  I made it think crust on a cookie sheet and it turned out delicious.  We put chicken and alfredo and cheese and onions on it and it was delicious.  What a great recipe.

Best crust ever! The family LOVED it!I did flavor it with Italian seasoning to add some spice. This crust is very thick though, so it is much better to make 2 large 15 inch pizzas as opposed to one very thick pizza. I make this pizza every week and it comes out perfect everytime on a baking stone!

Followed recipe exactly.  It was so easy to roll out.  I used it for two medium pizzas.  My husband's first comment was how much he liked the crust.  I gave it only 4 stars because next time I will blend in some flavoring and the crust needs to be baked for 8-10 minutes before topping.  I pre-baked only one crust and it was perfect.  The other unbaked one...not the crispy outside, chewy inside of the other one.

Just as expect from all 600 plus reviews, this crust was great!  Had to add a little more flour than what was called for in recipe.  Crust turned out really thick and moist!  Thank you, Jason, it's a keeper!

I make this all the time and it is the best! I recommend prebaking the crust for 2 mintues if using a pizza stone before adding toppings and then bake for 10-12 minutes at 200c if using a fan assisted oven. I usually make double and freeze the extra dough.

Tried this in the bread machine and it didn't work for me. So I started over and made it in the Kitchen Aid.  Had great flavor but not a whole lot on the texture side. I would prefer it to be a little crunchier.  

UPDATE: Made this again this week with 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat. I added a whole head of roasted garlic and about a tablespoon of honey. I made 2 pizzas out of it and it was amazing. The kids are asking for it again tonight.

Excellent! This made a very large fluffy crust. I topped it with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site (delicious!), plus cheeses, onion, bacon and pepperoni. Not quite Donato's, but good none-the-less. Thanks, Jason!

Great crust recipe - for those who wanted a bit more flavour - I added some parmasan cheese, some garlic and dried basil and oregano and it worked just fine.

Next time I'll try the whole wheat flour and I might put some shredded cheddar in it....Nice easy and good - - use Allrecipe's serfvings tool to make a bigger batch and freeze it like someone previously suggested.

This crust is a KEEPER! I have half a brain when it comes to yeast and was a little nervous when I saw the big Y word-but sheer laziness drew me to it to avoid having to clean my bread machine-it was easy-fast-pretty painless-and I will be using it again and again and again. I especially liked the soft center.

I used my kitchen-aid mixer to make this dough, I added flour till the dough was no longer sticky and kneaded with the dough hook for about 2 minutes.  The dough was so easy to work with and tasted great!  I sprayed Pam on a stone baking sheet and sprinkled with cornmeal.  I prebaked for 10 minutes than added sauce and toppings cooked for an additional 13 minutes. Great Thanks so much for sharing.

I know that this recipe didn't turn out as good as it could have due to my limited cooking abilities (I'm lost when it comes to yeast) - but it was EASY and tasted pretty good.  I will try it again and hope for better results.

I dont care what anyone says...this recipe was soooo simple and easy and tasted fine. I was almost like a fairy came and made it for me! also if you bake your crust for 5 mins. then add your toppings, your pizzas freeze fantastic! I also found this recipe to make 2 pizza's too! excellent Jason! Thank you!

With all the great reviews, I was expecting a much better crust.  It wasn't bad, but not that great, either.  Crust did turn out crispy as promised, but didn't have much flavor.  I would recommend Pizza Dough II (http://bread.allrecipes.com/AZ/PizzaDoughII.asp) instead.  Husband liked it, though - that's why it gets 4 stars.

Crust was good, but still not competitive with our local take-out.  I added oregano, but it still needed more flavor.

This one is a keeper!  Thanks Jason!

This is the best pizza crust ever!  Dont' listen to the others who rated it low.  It was an easy recipe -I'm not the best cook in the world so that should tell you something.  Everyone loved it.  I passed it on to my Mom & everyone raved about it.

This is by far the best Pizza Crust that I have found... I like to make up the crust, put a little olive oil on both sides, throw it on the hot grill.when first side gets done add the toppings... cooks fast, and doesn't heat up the house...GREAT!

Just like the recipe claims, soft yet a nice firm crust.  Very good, next time I'll spice it up a bit though.

It was okay - I made this recipe by mistake thinking it was another one I had tried on the website and I was sorely disappointed.  While the crust was slightly crispy, it was also overly chewy.  I would have been willing to forgive this if it had any flavour, but it didn't!  Blah.

Before I found this recipe, I had given up on making homemade pizza.  I could not find a crust that was good.  Well, around here takeout pizza is terrible so I gave this a try.  I make this  (scaled down 1/2 to make one crust) with bread flour and quick-rise yeast.  My picky husband loves it!  It is soft on the inside and nicely crispy on the outside.  I have better luck using shortening to grease the pan since olive oil seems to make it slide it around.  I also tried to freeze the original two-crust recipe and it didn't taste as good when I made it fresh.  This crust comes out perfect every time.  I've conquered making pizza!

First time making homemade pizza dough and I was pretty happy with the result.  Seemed like I used more flour than called for as it was a very humid, warm day.  Mixed some pizza herbs right into the dough, and brushed garlic oil and asiago cheese on outside edge.  Will make this again as its cheap, and better than anything store bought!

I was not impressed with this pizza crust. I think with some work it could be a 5 star but not as is. If I make again I will add 1/3 a cup of corn meal to the dough and a little bit more salt. It was also a bit to crispy but that may of been my fault.

This is "the" perfect pizza crust. I froze half and used it at a later date, and the pizza turned out fine!
I do recommend pre-baking the crust before adding toppings, especially if you like lots of toppings like me!

This recipe lives up to it's reputation! I scaled to 1/2. I've never made pizza crust from scratch before and will NEVER use a pre-made crust again! Baked right on pizza stone, loaded with toppings! It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! So easy, so good! Excellent! May try stuffing some mozzerella string cheese into crust edges next time for stuffed-crust! Thanks Jay!!

It turned out deliciously!  It really held up under all of my toppings.  No soggy crust here.  It was a fairly hard crust, and I had to add almost 1/2 c flour to get my dough right.  Otherwise, it would have been a 5 star from me!

This was my first time making dough and the end result was pretty decent.  I followed the recipe and let the dough set for an hour, however, I don't think mine rose to twice the size.  But it was a good experience, thanks for the recipe.

Perfect pizza crust!  I start it in my bread machine and slowly add the remaining flour.  I divide the dough in half, making only one 8 inch pizza, saving one crust in the fridge for later in the week.  The crust has wonderful flavor and a chewy/slightly crisp texture.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!

Such a great recipe.. i've probably made this at least 20 times since finding the recipe.  I often add herbs to the dough or cheese.. tastes GREAT!  I always freeze half so that we can have pizza the next week without waiting for the dough to rise!

I have never made home-made pizza before so I was a bit nervous about it. I love to cook but for some reason haven't ventured into Pizza. This was GREAT! My husband being European likes very thin crust but even HE loved this. It was so thick and soft in the middle, yet 'crusty' on the outside. I will make this again really soon! It also makes good breadsticks.

this was great. so, so easy to make and knead - i don't have that much experience with making dough, so i was worried about getting a sticky mess, but this wasn't sticky or difficult to manage at all! i didn't have a round pizza pan, so i used a rectangular pan and made 'sicilian style' pizza, with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site, topped with grilled vegetables and mozzarella. my only complaint was that as i love really thin and crispy crust, this was a little thick and bready - but i think that's cos my was smaller than a round one would have been, so the dough wasn't rolled as thin. but cos this is so easy and tasted so great, i'm going to buy a proper pizza stone for next time i make it! i think also that will make a crisper base. i made dough balls (golf ball sized lumps of dough, baked and served with dip - just like at pizza express - a uk pizza chain, i live in england) with the leftover dough, which were yummy.

Best I've found. Sometimes roll cheese sticks into the edges of the crust before baking for stuffed crust.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  This has been the best homemade pizza crust that we've tried so far!  We will definitely use over and over.  I put the crust in a large jelly rolly type pan and it is about perfect--it is on the thicker side but delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This is better than Kristino's hand tossed, which till now held my vote for best pizza in the world. I made one smaller pizza, 'cause my family likes a thicker crust. Delicious! It rose nicely and baked up perfectly. My mother once tried making pizza, quite some time ago, and the results were not good. My siblings expressed some reluctance to try another home made pizza ("EWWWW"), But once this was on the table, it lasted all of five minutes flat ("Hey, this is good")Defenetly will make again. And again. And...

Very good.  Made recipe exactly as is but cut it in half as recommended by others that did not want to make a huge pizza.  1/2 of the recipe made a 13x9 pan no stretching required.

I had made a huge error in the recipe and didn't realize it untill our guests who loved the pizza asked for the recipe.  They noticed that I had mentioned the large amount of brown sugar I used and that was not what it called for.  I had added a half a cup of brown sugar (don't know what I was thinking?).  I would recommend making the same mistake.

I've never made bread or pizza base before but this was easier than I thought it would be. The dough came together well and rose properly. Makes enough for two thin based pizza's.

This crust turned out great---I used an airbake pizza pan (covered with holes) for one pizza and a regular metal pan for another (it made two medium sized pizzas).  I made a Buffalo Chicken pizza and a Barbecue Chicken pizza (both from this site).  Yum!  The crust was perfect, soft and chewy, and so much better than delivery.  I prebaked it for a few minutes before I put on the toppings and it was perfect.  Thanks!

Count me in as another rave review! I made this crust into calzones for dinner tonight, and it was perfect. Much easier to work with than the last few recipes I've used, and it tasted great, too. This will be my recipe for pizza crust from now on!

I wasn't going to post anything because it already has so many great reviews and then I thought one more couldn't hurt.  This has so much flavor already that you don't need need to do much but I added some italian spices around the crust part with some butter and yum yum yum.

Really love this recipe.  We do make 2 round pizzas out of it.  The crust is sooo good.  A friend I have goes to tons of trouble making pizza crust.  Gets the high gluten flour and all, this one is so easy with ingredients that everyone has on hand. Thanks

I think I may have already rated this, but I LOVE THIS CRUST!  The only thing is, I have to add more flour (4 1/8 c. total instead of 3 1/3).  I don't know what it is about this recipe, but it makes any toppings taste great.  It is very filling, one pizza fills up our family of 4 with usually a piece or two left over.  We do like a lot of crust on our pizza, so if you like thin crust, this isn't for you.

Fast, easy and delicious.  Any dough that goes willingly into a pizza pan is a keeper in my book!

This was by far THE best crust i have ever tasted!!! It rolled out perfectly unlike the elasticly store bought kind. It also baked all the way through perfectly and made a great huge crust!! its great for anyone who loves thick and fluffy crust! awesome.

I promised my son that we would make a pizza from scratch.  This recipe sounded simple enough.  He wanted to make it hiimself with my oversight and it turned out great!  If an 11 year old can do it, you can too!  The taste of this crust is superb!  Thanks for sharing.  I think this will become a household favorite.

This turned out great! It was just as the description says, soft and doughy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. I topped it with Boboli pizza sauce (my favorite pizza sauce, I hate those Boboli pizza shells though!) mozzarella cheeze, pepperoni, and red pepper. So good! My husband, (MR.PICKY) raved about the crust! He told me to stick with this recipe. I had a little of the dough left over, so I made a calzone with it. This is the perfect pizza crust for me, and it is the only one I will use now! (Note: I used a pizza stone dusted with cornmeal to cook the pizza on. To me, this is the best way to cook a pizza at home.)

My kids love pizza, and I was tired of the cheap-tasting store-bought varieties.  My wallet was also tired of the delivered restaurant-style pizza, so I decided to use this recipe.  

This was the best pizza crust I have ever made (in fact the only pizza crust I have ever made), and my kids raved about it!! I am finally considered a better cook than my mother.  I intended to follow the recipe to the letter, but I ran out of olive oil and had to use canola...my brown sugar was a little hard (albeit dissolvable), and I used a standard non-stick pizza pan.  Then I discovered that the bottom element in my oven had burnt out.  Believe it or not, this pizza crust still came out perfect(after cranking up the heat on the top element and placing the crust on the lowest rack). I can't wait to get my oven fixed, buy some olive oil and brown sugar, and try it again!

This is the best homemade pizza crust I have ever had!  I was absolutely delighted!  It's definitely a crust that can hold a lot of toppings without defeat!  Crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside...

My first time ever making pizza crust, and it made me look like a pro! I used a sauce recipe from this site (Exquisite Pizza Sauce), doubled both recipes, and had no leftovers. Love, love, love those easy and delicious recipes!

This made a pretty good crust.  I've tried a few other recipes and this one was the best so far.  It reminded me of the self rising frozen pizza crusts.  It was super easy to make and made two decent sized pizzas.  I used pizza pans instead of a stone and after I greased them I dusted them with cornmeal. They didn't stick at all.  I will use this dough recipe next time I make a pizza.

Not quite sure what all the fuss is about, but I found this just okay.  The crust stuck to the oiled pizza pan and was a bit of a mess to lift off.  May try a hot stone with it again.

This crust recipe is good, but no one could tell the difference between it and the refrigerated pizza crust.  In the future, I'll save time and just unroll the refridgerated dough.

This was my first attempt at working with yeast and (thank God) it actually turned out! It wasn't even that hard! I let the KitchenAid knead the dough so it was a snap. The only complaint I have is that if you use a stone you must preheat it or it will take FOREVER to cook. Also, it was a little yeasty tasting, next time I would add a tad more salt.

This was great! I used the dough for stromboli though. I could have gotten at least 4 if i measured the dough correctly. But i only got 2. But i enjoyed the dough! I will keep this recipe on hand for the next time! I loved how simple it was! I baked it on the pampered chef pizza stone as well!

Light & fluffy.  The dough was very sticky so I had to put the 3+ cups of flour in right away so I could kneed the dough.  We used part of the dough for the pizza & part for an apple dessert pizza.

I thought I'd try a new pizza crust recipe. This was pretty good, but not as good as my other recipe. It was a bit doughy for my tastes. Overall, though, better than most crusts, and pretty easy to make.

Not bad, but not that good, even with added herbs and spices.  Does make a large quantity, and very easy to make. Tasty but not extraordinary, although a welcome change from grease soaked delivery pizza. Probably the best recipe you'll find for homemade pizza crust.

Wow!  Great recipe, we love to make pizza but the crust recipe we had was just not what we wanted.  So I came here and we tried this one, it is a winner!  I did need more flour than it called for but the weather is wet and my flour was not packed down.

Absolutely awesome pizza crust!  My entire family is pretty picky about our pizza's-- mainly our crusts and sauces-- and this by far is the best crust I have made yet! I doubled the recipe and ended up with five 14" size crusts Thanks so much for sharing!

Thanks Jay! I made the best pizza I have ever had. This is a great thick crust with great flavor. I suggest using a stone to keep good heat through thick crust.

I trusted the hundreds of other excellent reviews - and they were right!! A really easy and delicious pizza crust. Just be patient kneading it out to get it to the right texture.

This was very good. I used the extra dough to make a stromboli and that turned out great too. I will definitely use this for future pizzas.

I love deep-dish and this sure turns out that way.  We love this pizza crust.  We are considering altering it to make breadsticks too.  It is very soft inside, but perfectly done.  Wonderful crust!

This was the absolute best pizza crust that I've ever made. I added fresh herbs and garlic when I added the flour, and I brushed the crust with garlic butter/olive oil mixture. I made individual pizzas for my family and my little sister's friend. Everyone ate their entire pizza! Even the ones who normally only eat one or two pieces! They are still raving about it weeks later!!

This was my first time making pizza and it turned out pretty good.  I just put all the ingredients in my bread machine and on pizza dough mode.  The only thing that we didn't like was that the dough didn't brown as much as we had wanted it to.  Next time I want to throw in some herbs and brush the crust with butter & garlic, as others had said.  Overall, this was a good dough recipe.  I'll be making this again!  Thanks Jay.

I've never made pizza dough before, and this couldn't have been easier! Once baked, the crust was nice and crispy on the outside, and perfectly doughy on the inside. Thanks, Jay!

This worked out nicely but wasn't as special as I expected.  Worth trying once.

This crust was so easy to make and tasted sooooo good! This was only the second time I've made pizza (the first time was a huge flop), and I couldn't have asked for a better crust! Crisp and chewy! Mmmm!

Well, what's one more rave review?  Thank you thank you thank you.  This is the crust I have been looking for!  YUM!  The texture is PERFECT!  I do agree with other reviewers who said it needs a little more flavor.  I'll 'tweak' it a little by adding more salt.

Absolutely the best!  I now add part whole wheat flour and some oats instead of using all white flour.  The flavour from the oats and the whole wheat is amazing!  I love this recipe!

WOW! Good bye Pizza Hut, hello homemade!! I have made this 3 times already. Each time it came out perfectly, even in the humid weather of Tampa Bay Florida. Now I just have to learn how to make a circle of dough! :) I never know what shape the pizza will be but I know the taste-YUMMY!

This crust is all it promises.  Very tasty.  Add some dried basil and oregano to the flour before mixing for a little flavor boost.  It's better rolled flat to bake on a stone rather than trying to make a "lip" in a pizza pan with sides.  It rises a bit too much for that.

This crust was great! I got lots of compliments on it, and it came out perfectly. It was very easy to make, with ingredients I already had. I'll definitely be making this in the future. Also, I had to add about 1/2 c. extra flour, but it turned out great! Thanks! :)

This dough was extremely easy to make and consistantly good, and also has the flexibility to make either deep dish pizza or thin crust depending on how much of dough you use.  My only note is that I always end up using more flour than the recipe calls for, but that may be due to the use of a mixer, instead of doing by hand.

This was a great pizza recipe. I added my own stuff, and it tasted absolutely wonderful -- reduced the water to just a bit over 1 cup, added a tad more oil, and sprinkled some dried oregano, basil, and italian seasoning generously into the flour mixture. It turned out fantastic. I plan to try garlic-cheese breadsticks with the same recipe. I didn't know a pizza crust could taste this good! Thanks for sharing!

This is just a terrific pizza dough!  It comes out perfectly every time!  I make the dough, let it rise, punch it down, then divide it in two pieces.  I use one piece for a pizza, and the other I put in a floured ziploc bag for the freezer for another time.  This makes a delicious pizza!

Incredible dough recipe.  I've made it twice now for company and gotten rave reviews each time.  Very easy with a Bosch mixer.  I'll use this every time I make pizza, and I'm trying it with calzones tonight.

This is a great crust! I added some garlic and fresh basil to the dough.  Also, you can divide the dough into five and make personal pizzas.  I am thinking of making a few different flavor crusts:  garlic and basil, crushed red peppers, sundried tomato and parmesan.  I found that you do have to keep adding more all-purpose flour to make it easier to handle.

I have never been able to make decent tasting homemade breads and pie crust, but this is something else! We like this better than delivery pizza. The dough comes together very quickly with a good stand mixer and a dough hook-ready to rise in no time at all. I've used this recipe several times now and have had excellent results every time. Way to go Jay!

Best pizza crust recipe I've found. I do use a liitle more flour than the recipe calls for. You can also use half whole wheat flour for  a healthier and tasty alternative.

My search for the perfect pizza crust is over!  Be warned, you will need to make 2 pizzas.  This make one enormous pizza--it wouldn't fit on my pizza pan.  Thanks Jay!

Could pizza be any easier. This is a great recipe for dough.  I order pizza last night and I was thinking it didn't taste as good as I can make myself.   Thanks Jason

This pizza crust was really good, although I found the dough quite sticky and hard to work with.  I pressed the dough onto a cookie sheet and made one large pizza.  I was a little worried at first, because after I pressed the dough onto the cookie sheet, it looked rather "flat & lifeless", but the crust raised nicely as I pre-baked it, and it turned out great!  Everyone loved it.

Very Good taste and crispy crust.  Next time I will divide the dough to make 2 thinner pizzas instead of one thick one.  LOVED by my family.  I made with Easy Pizza Sauce and it took no time at all to have an awesome pizza!

This is a yummy pizza dough. I make it in a bread machine using bread flour. Sometimes I have to knead in a little extra flour after taking it out of the machine. I halve the dough. One half I use in a 13"x9" pan, other half I freeze for later. I prebake the dough for about 10 minutes before adding toppings and then continue to bake for 10-15 minutes more. The pizzas always turn out great.

It's the best dough I've ever made.  My H loves the dough and said it's second to none!.  I've made it several times in the last 30 days.  Next time I will use it to make bread sticks.  Will brush the tops with butter and some italian herbs and garlics.

This pizza crust is fantastic!!  The only thing I did differently, is made in to three thinner crusts.  I prefer a thin crust pizza.  A double batch makes six thinner large pizzas.  I did find too that the dough kept fine in a ziploc baggie in the refrigerator for a couple days.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I saw all the positive reviews on this, so I had to give it a try.  My dough turned out a little too sticky, but I may have been a few tablespoons shy on the flour.  Regardless, the crust turned out great, and the pizza was a big hit.  I made this in the bread machine so it was super easy.

This was the most fabulous pizza crust I have  ever made!  It tastes exactly like a delivery pizza.  I made it in my bread machine on the dough cycle, and all I had to do was use bread machine yeast, and bread flour as the changes.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

Delicious! This makes a real thick pizza, but very soft. I would suggesting getting a giant stone plate. Mine was large, but it expanded beyond the size of the plate. I used "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" recipe as a sauce. I used a little more than 8 oz of shredded mozzarela cheese, and I thought it was enough.

I was so intrigued by the many 5 star ratings, so I had to try this.  Well, you can believe the hype;  this recipe is fantastic.  Our pizza turned out looking just like a restaurant style deep dish pizza.  It was absolutely perfect!  I will make it again.

This recipe makes nice crust that's fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  I doubled the recipe and used jumbo round pizza pans.  Kids loved it.  I'll be using this recipe again.

This pizza crust was absolutely incredible.  We 
used to use the store-bought (sorry, Betty Crocker) crust to make 'homemade' pizza, but never
again.  This was fantastic and well worth the time
investment.  Thank you for sharing, Jay...I will
pass this one on to my friends!

I have not had much experiance with yeast, so I was a bit "scared" to try this with out my bread machine.  Turned out very good.  It makes one HUGE pizza, so next time, I will cut it into two pizzas.  I did pre bake it before adding toppings, then baked it with the toppings for about 20 minutes.  Kids said it was very good.

It was so easy to make.  It came out just as the description said.  Note:  I usually put the dough in the oven for a few minutes to firm it up before the toppings. That way the inside isn't too soft.

Wow! With 148 5-star responses I had to try this crust.  I wasn't expecting anything new as I've been having pizza parties with many family members at least once or twice a month for several years.  I've used the same recipe for years, but always wanted something with a more tender texture, soooooo I gave this recipe a shot.  Wow!  What a hit with all our regular diehards!  This crust is delicious and is different!  I found the crust to be a little sticky as well, but dipped my fingers into olive oil solved the problem beautifully!  I also patted the crust into the pan with oiled fingers and it behaved beautifully. Lastly, I doubled the recipe and had three perfect crusts.  The best!

This just replaced my 10-year "tried and true" recipe.  It was exceptionally easy, as I re-scaled it to 12 servings, then mixed it in a regular food processor with a metal blade (no special plastic blade needed) for about 4 minutes.  It was a little sticky getting every last bit out of the processor, but the time and energy savings were worth it.  I did knead it for about 2 minutes before rolling out one very large pizza the size of my stone.  My entire family loved it, including two very discerning teenage boys! Good work, Jay. Next I'll try the topping given in the "Onion Strips" recipe at this site.  Can't wait!

This was SO simple... why couldn't the 20 other crust recipes I've tried get it right!  Thanks Jay....it is an absolutely perfect crust.  Don't need to try any more sub-standard recipes.. it's a keeper.  My hint: Instead of rolling it out, I pressed it out with my fingers (recommendation from a cooking show).  This allows it to rise better and stay "fluffy" instead of compressed.  Worked great.

I am a missionary in the Czech Republic.  Whenever we have groups over we serve pizza with this crust.  There are never leftovers!  Especially good with Italian spice mix kneded in.

WOW!! I've never made homemade pizza crust before, and this was excellent!  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I divided the dough into to separate crusts and baked two fairly large pizzas. The crust was the perfect thickness and texture.  My only suggestion is to add a little spice to the crust.

This is the absolute best pizza crust I've ever had. I used white sugar instead of brown, mixed quick rise yeast directly into the flour mixture, and used about four cups of flour. It made enough for one thick pizza crust and also breadsticks. Brush oil onto the pan, then sprinkle with cornmeal before pressing the dough into the pan. It gives the crust a wonderful crunchy, nutty texture.

This was a good crust, but nothing spectacular. I use a pizza stone to make our pizzas and this crust came out the same as my regular recipe (taste & texture). It is a good recipe though for anyone who doesn't already have a good crust recipe.

Like my review will matter much with the thousands of reviews already out there on this pizza crust, but I must say that this is the best pizza I've ever made.  I made it at a dinner party with my friends and we all had so much fun making it, it wasn't that quick although I still give it a 5 because I'd hate to see anyone belittle this pizza.  It was a major improvement on the other pizza crust I made that was titled "crazy pizza crust".

I reviewed this once but had to come back to say it again.  This dough is excellent!!  I use it atleast once a week now.  One time I hurriedly turned the oven to 325 instead of 425 and the crust turned out nice and tender all the way through. No crisp crust to chew through!  We bake it at 325 all the time now!

This is the best pizza dough recipe I have found.  It even freezes well.  I wrap the leftover ball of dough tightly in plastic wrap after it rises.  Then thaw it in the refridgerator while I'm at work.  Talk about a quick dinner!  I make 2-3 pizzas from this recipe.

Great tasting crust!  I will make it again.  I had to use much more flour then the recipe called for to get the dough the right consistency

Tastes fine but the texture is softer than I would like.  Needs to be a little crisper.

This is a really fantastic pizza crust. It was my first attempt at making pizza from scratch and it received rave reviews! One must plan well enough to ensure there is enough time to let the dough rise properly.

Great crust.  It was soft and chewy and a little sweet.  I put olive oil and cornmeal on the bottom to add crunch.

This is AWESOME!!!It made one very thick pizza.  Next time I will make two.  This is the best pizza crust I have ever made.  This came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just as it said.  My crusts that I have made in the past always came out doughy on the inside when brown on the bottom.  My picky husband liked this and it passed the picky teenager test.  My Mother who is 80 loved the crispy crust!  I topped it with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe found on this site and italian sausage crumbled and browned, fried fresh mushrooms, onions, green peppers and added mozzarella cheese the last 7 minutes.  It was so delicious!  I will be making this again soon!  Thanks!!!

   Hey Jay Great pizza crust!!!

 I tried 2 last night, one on a stone and one on
 a metal pan. The stone makes the crust AWESOME!!
 The whole bottom is nice and crunchy, yet tender
 inside. And WHAT A TASTE!!! You have a winner 
 here. I even made a stuffed crust pizza and it 
 turned out awesome, better then the restaurant
 that we usually go to and pay up the rear for.
 I will definitely use this from now on,thanks
 for sharing this easy and time friendly recipe.

Very good pizza crust.  We love it.  But when I knead by hand, I need to use more flour.  May be next time, I will use little bit less water.

This is a great and simple recipe. We don't order pizza anymore.   I made one pizza and one calzone out of this.  They both turned out perfect.  I am sure I will be having many pizza parties in the future with this recipe.

This crust was very soft inside and crispy outside.  I used a stone, and it puffed up quite a bit.  I think it would make very good bread sticks.  I might try splitting the dough between two pans, so the crust isn't quite so thick.  This was a very good recipe and I will definitely use it again.

Delicious, I may use high gluten flour next time and a little more oil on my pan when baking so the crust won't have as much flour but this is definatly the best I've tried!

I found the first crust I made was too thick.  I had left over for the next day and the crust I made then did not rise as much and was more to my liking. The easiest crust I have ever made.  Don't think I will be looking for another.

Absolutely great!  Even worked at high altitude.
My 14 year old now makes this regularly for himself!

This is the best crust recipe I've ever used.  I served it at a birthday party and everyone loved it.  I'll never use another one.  Great taste, easy to make.

Voila! My first attempt in making my first gourmet pizza turned out to be the best crust I have tasted. Absolutely loved it! For even a novice like me, it's a breeze! My pizza party is now talk of the town. Thank you.

I tried making this crust last weekend. This has to be the best pizza I've made yet. I don't think I'll be searching for another crust recipe again. My friends thought it was great also. 
The instructions on making the crust was great as well. I've not had one turn out this good on the first try yet. 
Thanks!

Great tasting crust. My husband loved it! I let the kitchenaid do all the kneeding and it turned out great and made it really easy. Only downfall was it is a very soft crust so the topping browned before the bottom, causing a slight imbalance and too soft a crust to hold heavy toppings. That can easily be corrected by pre-cooking the crust a little. Other than that, it's great and I'll look no more for another. This one is very workable and we really enjoyed it.
