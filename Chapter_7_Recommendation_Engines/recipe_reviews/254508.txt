Made as written except that I used St. Louis style ribs and I omitted step 5. We like our sauce on the side instead of smothered on the meat. These turned out really good but I would leave out the nutmeg and allspice next time. I happened to have all of the spices on hand but if you didn't and had to go buy them all it would cost you a small fortune. I also found that these needed way more than 3 1/2 hours. Plan on at least 5. After I smoked for 2 hours in the vinegar I put the ribs back in the smoker uncovered for a couple more hours to get a nice bark on them and it was in those last 2 hours when they became fall off the bone tender.

I change up the seasoning at times more sugar but this a great rub for long slow smoking. This is my go to every day rub for thin pork chops, beef ribs , spare ribs and butts.
