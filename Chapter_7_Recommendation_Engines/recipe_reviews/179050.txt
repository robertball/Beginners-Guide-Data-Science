I add more potato (cooked) and carrot. I didn't cook the fish or shrimp. I added them when the cooking was over and let the heat of the chowder cook them. I was great

This is the second time in a week that I have made this dish becuase my husband and I love it so much.  It's probably the easiest thing I've ever made too.  You literally saute some onion and garlic, throw in the soups and milk, then add the fish and shrimp and you're done.  I always feel like I'm making it wrong because its so darn easy but it turns out so yummy.  My variation is that I use fresh garlic instead of powder and only half a white onion and then I throw in some sliced green onion for color and added flavor.  I also add diced red potato (two small ones) to the soup and let it simmer for about five minutes before adding the fish and shrimp at the end, which I let simmer for another five minutes.  I use halibut for the fish because my husband says he likes how it doesn't taste too "fishy".  Oh, and don't forget a very generous dash of salt.  This soup definitely needs it.

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars.  It is a very good, easy recipe.  Like another reviewer I added more potatoes.  I also cooked the whitefish in the soup at the end.  Next time I'm going to be sure to use only organic, cream based soups as the "name brand" soups have msg in them.  It was quite easy, and very good.

So simple to prepare.  Doesn't taste canned!

I've made this as written, done all shrimp and all fish (I use walleye).

This is the easiest and yummiest thing I have made in a long time.  I just added a bit of Old Bays and also a dash or two of Texas Pete's Hot Sauce- because I always add those two items to seafood.... it was wonderful.  While I was eating it I was thinking that bacon and corn would be an awesome addition....not that it needed it but would make it even more spectacular!

It was delicious! I used tilapia & added cubed potatoes and a cup of fat free half & half and 1/2 cup vegetable broth instead of the milk, it made it creamy. Everyone in the family including kiddies loved it.

I used fresh garlic and added some carrots and celery.  My wife thought it was good. I thought a little plain. I would maybe add some old bay next time.

I made this with my kids.  I only used the cream of potato.  I started by cooking one small onion, potatoe and fresh chopped garlic in olive oil.  I added in bay seasoning and pepper to taste.  I then added about 15 small pre-cooked shrimp, after cooking for about 5 minutes I added in one can the cream of potatoe and a 1/2 cup of half & half.  I let it simmer for another 5 minutes and then blended using an emersion blender.  I thinned it out with another 1/2 cup of milk.  Added cubed two small potatoes and frozen shrimp and haddock.  My kids loved it!!!  Quick and easy to make and easy to make variations.
