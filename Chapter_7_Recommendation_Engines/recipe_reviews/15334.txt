I've tried quite a few oatmeal cookie recipes, this has been by far the best one...although I used only 1tsp. of cinnamon, as I don't like them to cinnamon-y,it was the perfect amount if you prefer just a hint of spice to your cookie. everyone loved them..including my kids who don't like anything that may sound as if it has something healthy in it...the 2nd time I made them I added in a package of milk chocolate chips and 2 cups of chopped walnuts. it didn't make them to dry and they still came out perfect.
thanks for the recipe I'll use from now on. :)

OK,OK, I"m not a baker, nor will I ever be..but this is a keeper and a great base recipie.  The first time I used shortening...they were good, but the second time I used BUTTER and added dried cranberries and bittersweet chocolate chips, and they were simply OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!

theses cookies are awesome, I've made them both with and without chocolate chips. (Of course I didn't add the cinnamon when adding chips) I used a mini ice cream scoop to drop cookies on sheets, then after 10 minutes of baking, I flattened the puffed cookies slightly with an "egg flipper", then baked for 3 more minutes this made them super chewy inside and crispy on the edges absoulutely DELICIOUS just like the bakery this way!
Thanks very much for the recipe Kristen!

Okay, so here's the thing. I wanted to use butter (I don't keep shortening on hand outside the Christmas season) but I didn't want to use a stick and a half so I used the servings adjuster thingie on this site and cut it back to twenty servings which made it one stick of butter (which is half a cup). I had to do a little monkey-ing around with a few of the ingredients to make them come out even, like I used one whole egg which meant I had to eliminate the water called for in this recipe. I also used a full teaspoon of vanilla and added a half cup or so of organic raisins. Even with my adjustments (or crazy changing to round amounts), this cookie baked up fabulous and didn't seem to be affected by my changes. That's a sign of a wonderful recipe--it dosen't fall flat when you change up the recipe a bit. The cookie was perfectly cinnamon-y and it was chewy with a slight crisp on the edges. I like my oatmeal cookies soft usually but I really liked the flavors of this. I'll make this recipe again, but I'll make sure to make a custom recipe so I remember the changes I made to suit 20 servings or using one stick of butter. NOTE: GREASE YOUR SHEETS. Trust me. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time getting these cookies off of the cookie sheets. Also, 350* for eleven and a half minutes was just right.

This oatmeal cookie is the classic slightly crispy/mostly chewy cookie I remember from childhood.  I made it EXACTLY as written and have the following observations.  The recipe is simple enough my children are able to follow most of the instructions independently.  I found the dough to be quite soft - a little wet, even; but the finished product was outstanding.  I baked the cookies on ungreased parchment paper lined cookie sheets and had no problems with sticking or spreading.  For the final batch I stirred in Orchard Trail Mix available at Wal-Mart, and the cookies maintained their shape and consistency despite the fairly large yogurt covered raisins and cashews in the mix.  I would reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  in the future if I were planning to add raisins, nuts, or trail mix.  This recipe has joined the gang posted on the back of my cabinet door and will be made often.

I did a double batch and it made more than 100 "two-bite"-sized cookies!  Substituted butter for the shortening and added dried cranberries and mini-semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also halved the cinnamon as I was not sure how it's flavour would mix with new ingredients.  Great texture and flavour.  A bit too sweet...I used a whole bag of chocolate chips...next time I would cut this in half and cut the white sugar in half as well.

I added dried cranberries and butterscotch chips to these for a great "autumn" cookie.  I took some to work and they vanished in seconds! The batter spread just the right amount: not too round and cakey but not totally flat and delicate either.  Take them out of the oven to cool on the cookie sheet before they really look "done" if you want them chewy instead of crispy (9-10 min).  Also, this recipe makes a lot...I got over 3 dozen!  This recipe will become a staple for me.

This recipe is properly named. They are awesome. I like them with a dash of powdered ginger and the full amount of cinnamon. My sweetie likes them with chocolate chips but I think they're better without. It makes about 42 rounded-spoonful-sized cookies and they still disappear quickly! P.S. If you're trying to sell your home, cook a few batches during an open house, the aroma is amazing! - P.s. I used butter, not shortening.

Love this recipe.  Cookies turned out crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  You have to make sure you don't spread them out as you spoon or they will be too thin.

Be alert that because there is such a high oatmeal to flour ratio that these are definitely OATMEAL cookies, with lots of whole-grain oat texture. It was a tad too much for me, not only in texture, but in flavor as well.  I used butter rather than shortening and would do so again.  The generous amount of cinnamon helped tame the almost too bold oaty flavor.

This is an excellent oatmeal cookie.  I have been using this same recipe for years. The only difference is that I use butter instead of shortening.  Just my preference.  I also add 1 cup of raisins.  I had tried many oatmeal cookie recipes but this is the BEST as far as I am concerned.

I'm making this recipe now, and i have to say, this cookie is really, really good!!!  I made them tiny, tsp size, and cooked for 12 min.  They are wonderfuly crispy outside, and soft inside.  Great flavor.  I made it just as the recipe said for the first dozen have just cooked 2.5 doz more with mini chocolate chips (added another 2T water), and they are delish!!  I have my 4-6th dozen with coconut, raisins, pecans, and choco chips.  They are also very soft and chewy.  All this tsp sized from ONE batch.  WOO-HOO!!!

These were pretty good, I didn't read to "grease the pan" and the cookies were hard to get off.

These are fabulous cookies! I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening. They were chewy and slightly crisp. Oatmeal cookies are my favorite, and now this is my favorite recipe to make them!

I have been on a long search for the perfect oatmeal cookies for my husband.  I tried these ones and they were the bomb!!  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  He loved them and they passed his test.  This will be my new oatmeal cookie recipe.  I made as written, didn't change a thing.  1 TB of cinnamon seemed like a lot, but it wasn't.

***First: 12-15 minutes is WAY OFF.

***Second: Even with chilled dough, we're talking 2-5 minutes in the oven at this temperature, unless you want charred discs.

***Third:  While it's true this recipe isn't cake-like (which is why I gave it a go,) it doesn't strike the perfect balance of crisp and chew either with the instructions as they are.  Taken as-is this recipe results in cookies that are pretty greasy, that get "lacey" (*very* spread out) in the oven.  A non-cakey crisp/chew cookie using this recipe is best acheived using the following points:

If you're going to use this recipe, cook on baking paper or a silicone mat (don't grease a cookie sheet... who does that anymore anyways?)

Also: cook closer to 3 minutes at about 340F/170C for temp.  You'll get a better shape to your cookies if you work with chilled dough following these guidelines.

Instead of all-shortening, half butter + half shortening works better for both flavour and texture.

I'm not sure what went wrong but I followed the recipe to a T.  They came out flat, flat, flat and the cinnimon taste was overwhelming.  I had all fresh ingredients.  I have to keep looking for a good oatmeal cookie that the recipe picture indicates.  That DEFINITELY was not what I got!-

AWESOME!!! I have been searching for an oatmeal cookie recipe, and this is it! I did take some of the other review ideas...used 3/4 cup of butter instead of shortening, added 1 1/2 cups Hershey's chocolate chips, an 8oz bag of cranberries and cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 tsp. I also baked them for about 10 mins then used a spatula to slightly pat them down, then continued to bake them for the remaining 3 mins. DO NOT over cook these! The tops of the cookies will look underdone but will continue to cook while cooling. These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made! Soft and chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside. Just the way we like them, but could never seem to get them. Thanks for the addition to the recipe book, this ones a keeper!

The BEST oatmeal cookies we have ever had.  The only change I made was to add in some semi-sweet chocolate chips at the end.  The chocolate cinnamon combination was exceptional.  My husband and I had a hard time not eating all of these in one sitting.  Definitely try this recipe... the name is so appropriate... they are awesome!

These cookies are amazing.  I made them plain, and after trying one, I made another batch with raisins and another one with chocolate chips.  All were just wonderful, chewy and a joy to eat.  Nothing at all like my other oatmeal cookie recipes, which is why I was looking in the first place.  I will never use any other recipe than this one ever again.

Fantastic!!  The perfect cross between crunchy and chewy.  I added a bit less cinnamon and then about a 1/4 cup each of semi sweet and milk chocolate chips.  I loved that they were just right when i took them out at 12 minutes too. . . not too hard!  Mmmmm. . .

Kristen, I don't care where you came by this recipe, I'm just glad you shared it with us.  My daughter especially like these cookies and asks for them with raisins.  I also shared these with my parents and my Dad actually made them for himself!  Thanks again.

I have made them twice now, the second time I halved the white sugar and added about half a cup of chocolate chips (with raisins of course) and I hope my kids come home soon because I'm going to gobble these up in no time. Also, the smaller the cookie the better, so about a tablespoon of batter on the GREESED cookie sheet!

These are fantastic! The only thing I changed was to use butter-flavored shortening instead of regular, because that's what I had, and I added a bag of cinnamon chips. I made 2 dozen BIG cookies, they're soft and chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside, YUM! A really great cookie.  BTW, in response to one review, this is most definitely NOT the Quaker Oatmeal Cookie recipe, it's completely different.

These cookies came out really great. I made super tiny ones, about the 1.5" size and cooked them for 12 minutes. They were much chewier than i thought they would be, which i love, and weren't as crispy as i thought the reviews said they would be. They're definitely not cakey or puffy like which I think is better for an oatmeal cookie. I also added in choc. chips and chopped dried cranberries. yummy!

I subsituted butter for the shortening other than that followed the directions exact and the cookies were a huge hit.  My daughter took some into school and one her classmates said that they were the best cookies ever.

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have found yet! It is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I do not add the cinnamon.  We like them better plain or with chocolate chips!  You must try this recipe it is perfect exactly as it is written! My brother loves my baking and he said that these were the best ones that I have ever made! Thanks for sharing!

Perfect texture - crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. I used oil (a bit more than 1/2 a cup) instead of shortening, threw in about 1/2 cup of raisins, and baked them as bars. My family loved them, particularly fresh from the over with cold milk.

Just made these cookies.  They are great.  As someone stated before the only change I made was cutting the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  I added 1 cup each of raisins, cocolate chips and coconut.  All I can say is the they were a wonderful combination of a cookie, candy bar and granola bar.  Very chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges.

Perfect oatmeal  cookie...slightly crisp on the outside and very chewy inside!! The only subsitutions I made was 1/4 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter, and I added a few handfuls of raisins. Cooked them on my Pampered Chef Stoneware Baking Sheets lined with parchment paper for 11 minutes at 350 degrees. I also thought the cinnamon would be too much but I added it anyway and also sprinkled the tops of the cookies with the cinnamon sugar "bear" mixture that you buy in the store. Can't wait for my husband to get home from work so he can try them..if there is any left! I got 3 dozen cookies, used heaping spoonfuls of dough and when they came out of the oven flattened them slightly, I didn't have a problem with them being flat. Very easy recipe to make.

Made cookies as stated and cooked for 13 minutes out of the 12-15 suggested. Cookies came out tasting good but too dry. Won't make this recipe again as I have others that are fluffier and softer.

This recipe was really easy and came out so good. I melted the butter first though, and only baked them for 10 minutes and that was perfect. Thanks Kristen, your cookies are awesome!

ok.. I am sorry to have to do this, but this was not to our taste! I was a little worried when I saw that you only used 1c. of flour. All I can say is ACK! These cookies stuck to the pan, even with greasing, were flat and had very little taste.. I actually threw out the rest of the dough! Welp, I guess I should just stick with what I know

yum!!! i was afraid it wouldn't make enough, but i added about a cup more oats, a cup of chocolate chunks and half a cup of raisins, and they're great! Oddly enough, I was also out of cinnamon and almost out of vanilla, so i used 4 tsps of pumpkin pie spice, the little vanilla extract i had (1/4 tsp) and about a tsp of almond extract. I decreased the salt too, to 1/2 tsp, but now i think that probably wasn't necessary.

This is a great recipe. I followed it to a T, and the cookies turned out great! I added raisins to half the recipe, and after being baked, it appeared that the cookies with the raisins held better shape. It's not a cakey cookie, but not totally crunchy either. The taste really is awesome.

Okay, I must admit these are awesome.  My husband claimed they are the best oatmeal cookies he's ever had (which is saying quite a lot since he comes from a family who is talented in the kitchen) and literally ate half the batch.  I loved them too -- they were just the right combo of crunchy/chewy.  yum.

Crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle, highly addictive! The second batch is still baking and the first is awesome, as the recipe claims. Not strongly spiced, lots of oatmeal, delicious. A KEEPER!

This was a really good cookie.  My girls just loved them.  I did change just a few things----I used butter instead of shortening and used half the amount of cinnamon that the recipe called for.  Overall I will probably use this as my basic oatmeal cookie recipe from now on.

The reason why I tried this recipe is because another reviewer stated it was like the recipe on the OLD oatmeal containers.  I was making this for a friend who said he didn't like oatmeal cookies anymore because all the recipes were for cake like cookies and cookies are suppose to be crisp. The shortening really does it.  I don't like oatmeal cookies myself but I am very happy to have found this recipe.  I think kids old enough to cook can easily make this drop cookie recipe, thus 5 stars.

I used this recipe and added craisins and white chocolate chips. I've done this before with another oatmeal cookie recipe, but the cookies turned out more like big soft cookie balls. yeck...

Absolutely delicious, especially with the raisins I added.  Kinda crispy/chewy....just the way I like 'em!  Even my husband, who is a self-proclaimed "chocolate chip cookie only" guy loved these.  I won't use another oatmeal cookie recipe from now on!

the flavor of this cookie was decent.  I did cut back on the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup.  I thought the amount of sugar to the amount of flour seemed too much.  There was more sugar than flour.  Its the texture that's off.  Too many oats, I think, the flavor of the oats was not the issue, just the amount of oats that effected the texture.  Was a good cookie, though.  I did not have any problems with the cookie turning out "flat" as other reviewers described.  Would like to try another recipe to compare this to.

This is by far the worst oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever used. I followed the recipe exactly. Cookies were super thin and would not come off the sheet at all, even after greasing it. Super disappointed that I wasted time and money on these cookies!!

This made a great simple oatmeal cookie that could be jazzed up however the mood strikes.  The only changes I made was to omit the white sugar and use 1 1/4 cups brown sugar and I used butter instead of shortening.  I added about 3/4 cup craisins and an equal amount of walnuts.  Made about 3 dozen yummy cookies.  Will definitely be making again.

I just love oatmeal cookies. These are fabulous and very moist. I followed the recipe but didn't have enough vanilla so I used a teeny bit of almond extract instead. I will be making these again.

These cookies are amazing!!  I used 1/2 cup shortening + 1/4 cup butter, and 1/2 tbsp cinnamon, and they turned out wonderfully.  Like others, mine were a little flat, but they're so delicious I don't care.  And they smell fantastic!  A truly perfect cookie.

Really good and easy. I needed a quick cookie for a carry in and these were wonderful. I used 1 stick of unsalted butter instead of shortening and I had no problems. The first batch was flat, so I just doubled the scoop size and added 1 minute to the oven timer. I got thicker cookies that were not burnt or too gooey.  Thanks for a great go to cookie!

AWESOME!  I read a couple reviews and made one sheet chewy and one sheet crunchy.  Both are amazing!  I mixed up the spices a bit though...  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp allspice.  I also added 1/2 cup flame raisins, 1/2 cup golden raisins, and 1/2 cup pecans.  AMAZING!

These cookies are great.  I doubled the recipe and although I normally use butter I used half margarine and half shortening.  I split the dough and added raisins to one and dried cranberries to the other.  I use a mini icecream scoop that equals to 1 tbsp to scoop them out and ended up with 94 cookies.  I will definitely make these again

Well, this may have been my fault, but the cookies turned out soooo FLAT!  To the point that they had spread out so much in some places that it left little holes.  Now, I used butter instead of shortening and my baking soda may need replacing...both of which I can see leading to flat cookies.  BUT, the taste was excellent!  So, I will try again using shortening and get new baking soda and hopefully they will rock!

These were tasty and satisfying. Next time I might decrease the amount of oats by 1/2 or 1 cup. The cookies didn't flatten out during baking and they came out of the oven like they were put in - as big drops. Maybe that's because too many oats made the dough hold together.

Best cookies I ever tried!!! My husband is not a sweets fan, but he gobbles them up in the middle of the night, and asks for more of them in the morning. I added craizins, chopped pecans, and english toffee bits to them - they're absolutely outstanding.

These cookies were great! I added about 3/4 cup of sliced carrot bits to the batter and the cookies came out sweet and soft. I also added a cinnamon cream cheese drizzle, which made the cookies explode with flavor.

Really Good!  Whenever I make them, they don't last for long. They are a perfect combination of chewy and crispy. I add chocolate chips. When kept in an airtight container at room temperature, the chocolate chips are soft and delicious.

These oatmeal cookies were very good.  I will be adding them to my recipe list.  The batter, once all mixed was very wet compared to most cookies I have made but it didn’t matter; the cookies turned out perfect.  I baked them for 13 minutes and followed the recipe to a T.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! I used butter instead of shortening and only used 1/2 cup because I like my cookies less on the crispy side. I added coconut, raisins and white chocolate chips. Didn't have any nuts, or I would have added them too... Awesome cookies. Quick and easy to make. This is one for the Christmas tins!

A hit at my house with all.  Added 1 cup raisens and cut the cinnamon back to 1tsp.  I don't like raisens so I never tried the cookies.  They all said they were a "keeper".
Thanks.

This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.

It's pretty much the same one that used to be on Quaker Oats boxes years ago before they changed the recipe to one that uses butter instead of shortening.

I'll leave out the cinnamon, but otherwise this is yummy.

I was looking for a cookie recipe with stuff around the house and this happened to foot the bill.  A super easy recipe; great tasting cookie.  I used  about 3/4 cup brown sugar (that was all I had) and doubled the cinnamon ( because I love it) and they came out tasting great.  It's a keeper.  Thanks Ms. Hathaway

Very crispy, crunchy cookies.  Gets better with age; not so great right out of the oven.  Added 1/3 cup chocolate chips.  Big hit with everyone, especially me!

These cookies are a hit; high praise as my husband is a cookie connoisseur. Because I cook as clean as possible and don't keep shortening on hand, I used organic avocado oil 1:1 in place of the shortening. I ran about 1/2 c short of rolled oats and made up the difference with flour. The recipe still performed spectacularly. I believe that's why they were a bit softer in the middle than described,  but who doesn't love crunchy on the outside and soft in the center. It was the perfect compromise. I've been "cleaning up" different oatmeal cookie recipes but this one will now be my go to. Five stars because the recipe was so forgiving of my changes.

I added raisins to my cookies and liked them very much. Crispy yet still chewy. I made mine a bit smaller and ended up with 40 cookies. I also cut back on the cinnamon. I love cinnamon but did not want it to overpower the cookies. I also use a very good quality cinnamon (bought it in Morocco where they ground it right in front of me) so you don’t need to add a lot to get great flavor.

Followed recipe as is. Is on the sweet side - so for me, I could cut back on the sugar. The hubs though loves them as-is. Did also try once with GF flour replacement and turned out great.

Excellent basic recipe. If you like to add raisins or craisins, try putting them in a pot with just barely enough water to cover them, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for ten minutes or so. Let them cool completely and use the raisin/craisin water for the water in the recipe.  This plumps up the raisins/craisins and adds more flavor to the cookie.

Wow best cookies ever, seriously!! You have to make these! I did make a few changes, and did use 1 cup of raisins. Change one/ I used a heaping tablespoon of molasses, and added two shakes of nutmeg, and I use one teaspoon of baking powder instead of the baking soda. The molasses makes all the difference, really very good cookies everyone LOVES them!

Chewy goodness!  I don't like crispy cookies so this recipe was perfect.  I may play around with the recipe a bit and try less cinnamon in the cookies and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top when they are on a cooling rack or recipe as is but with raisins.  They would also be good with a thin icing. However, as written, the recipe is easily one of the easiest, quickest and tastiest oatmeal cookie recipes I have found.

Wow!  I followed your recipe exactly, the cookies are delicious!
They also have a beautiful color and a perfect texture - crispy but with a hint of chewey. I needed a cinnamon oatmeal cookie because  my house of picky eaters refuse raisins and or chocolate chips. A great cookie - lives up to the name of Awesome! Thank you Kristen!

What a strange recipe. I followed it exactly, except I doubled it. The batter spread out into one big sheet that covered the whole sheet pan and came out really dark brown in color (though not really burned, just dark brown) and was sticky and spoonable. Not good.

I wanted a fairly crispy oatmeal cookie, but I didn't have any crisco.  I tried 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil, but they came out quite soft. Delicious, but not crisp.

I used 1/4 cup butter and half of shortening, decreased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon as suggested in reviews,  and added raisins, chopped pecans and carob chips. It has replaced the oatmeal cookie that I have  cherished for years.  Sorry Beth.

I made these as directed in the recipe,  just reduced cinnamon to 2 teaspoons.  Lovely crispy edge and bottom, chewy in the middle.  My daughter said "Mom, make them like that every time!"  I also made a second batch adding walnuts, raisins and some flax meal.  Worked fine, a bit thicker, but the same crispy edge and chewy middle.  A winner!

Absolutely delicious.  Flew off the plate.  Added only 1 cup of walnuts and glad to have done so because the nuts balanced the sweetness.  Made to all recipe specs.  Next time, which will be today, will leave out salt.  I'm not a salt fan so did not appreciate that taste when I bit in.  Others may love it.  Easy, everything always in the house.  Gotta' go now to bake some cookies!

Amazing! I used part oil part butter for the cookies as I was low on butter. I made half with butterscotch chips & half with raisins. All were great! They have a nice crispness to them without being hard or dry. They are tender also. Yum! Not too oaty for our family either.

I made these again with all butter, no oil and it wasn't as tender. Next time I'll go back to using  some oil.

Mine ended up being quite a bit darker than the one in the picture.  I too added a cup of raisins  and a generous handful of coconut.  Love the slightly crunchy and chewy texture.  Thank you for the recipe.  Next the big test of my nephews are coming to town and they and my husband are the final test.

I myself really liked these.  I did not alter the recipe at all. They were VERY thin and crispy, and it did say they would be, so can't fault that. However, probably will look for a more traditional recipe next time.  The taste was great, though.

I made the cookies exactly as the recipe stated - I use butter flavored shortening anytime a recipe calls for shortening and my family really loved it. Wonderfully cinnamony and lots of oats. Really enjoyed these cookies.

I did change this recipe so I can't truly comment on it.  I just wanted to keep record of the things I did change so I know for the next time I make them.and they were perfect.  I did 1 1/2 cups flour  and 2 1/2 cups of oats.  With 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp nutmeg.

I made these for my Dad for his birthday. They turned out great. The only change I made was that I used coconut oil in place of the shortening to make them more healthful. I will make these again for sure.

I am sitting at my table and eating the cookies. They are really good. I added in about half a cup of chocolate chips and they are extra soft. I added in 1 teaspoon of cinnamon because a tablespoon sounds too much. I can still taste the cinnamon. They are so yummy. Even my sister that does not like oatmeal is eating them. They taste super good hot when they just come out of their oven. I will make these again. If you want great cookies I recommend these. Also instead of using white sugar I used brown also. My sister thought that they would fail but I was like, if you don't try new things you will never experience yummy food.

I followed the version for making 20 cookies so I could use one stick of butter, eliminating the water entirely and using a whole egg. I added a half cup of toffee bits and a half cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. They have an incredible mouth feel, very satisfying.

This was a great recipe I just added a stick of butter because I love a buttery cookie.  I also didn't add as much cinnamon to it. I flattened the cookie and it cooked perfectly and crispy....just like I like them!!! Great recipe...

I stumbled onto this recipe after looking for another oatmeal cookie recipe on this site that I had tried before.  This was even better!  I substituted 3/4 of a cup of butter instead of shortening, and I used 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar and less white sugar then the recipe called for.  By accident, my brother added half a teaspoon of baking powder into the dough mixture.  At first I thought it would come out too puffy, but gave it a softness that was really good.  We'll definitely be using this recipe again.

Excellent.  Do keep them small, though, 3" diameter when finally baked and spread out.  If you don't, they will take forever to finally bake through and you'll never get anywhere near the 30 cookie yield listed.  I used a soup spoon to scoop it; if they come out too large then just use less batter the next go around.  Also, put the pan on a cooling rack for five minutes before pulling them!  They are mush until they set a bit.  I usually use parchment paper anyway.

Except for adding raisins and slightly less salt (3/4 teaspoon to compensate for salted butter) I pretty much followed the recipe.  These are light, slightly crispy outside and soft and chewy inside.  I like mine slightly burnt on the bottom, so I left them in a bit longer!  I will use this recipe from now on because it uses slightly less shortening and sugar.  I tasted the difference and I like it!

These were easy to make and delicious!  I used 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of an egg, because my child is allergic to eggs.

These are amazing. I used one teaspoon of cinnamon as other people suggested and I can still taste the cinnamon in the cookies. They're a bit soft but the edges are crunchy. Really tasty My daughter loves them and they're going in the recipe book of favourites.

Okay, so I had an interesting experience with these cookies but when it was all said and done I still give them 5 stars.
I used butter like a lot of other reviewers. I avoid using shortening whenever possible. I also added chocolate chips but I kept everything else the same. I even put in the cinnamon.
With the first dozen I had the same problem that some other reviewers had.  I left them in WAY longer than 15 minutes because they were nowhere near done... They just kept spreading out until they were lacy, flat and the bottoms were turning dark but the tips were uncooked.  Then when I finally took them out they wouldn't come off of the pan so I ended up with a bowl full of crumbly cookie pieces. Delicious crumbly cookie pieces, I might add!
For the other 18 cookies I turned the heat up to 375 and only put in one pan of 6 cookies in at a time instead of two pans.  After 15 minutes they were still holding their shape pretty well and baking nicely so I flattened them with a spatula and baked them for another 2 minutes (I like my cookies crunchy, not soft).  They came out perfectly and were not hard to get off of the pan.
I have no idea what exactly went wrong with the first batch but I'm pretty sure it was due to either my oven or user error.  It doesn't matter because they tasted delicious and we ate them all anyway!

Great cookies, I’m baking some now!  My favorite adaptation of this recipe is to use butter instead of shortening, add 1/2 bag of dark chocolate chips and some dried craisins or cherries.  I also cut the white sugar down to 1/4 cup.

This recipe is prefect as written.  The cookies really spread out when baking, so be sure to leave plenty of room between them on your first batch until you know what to expect.  Thanks for a great new addition to my recipe box!

Perfect oatmeal cookies - slightly crispy, slightly chewy! Followed recipe exactly except I used just 1 tsp cinnamon, but that is personal preference.

I made these today and read some of the reviews first. I prefer to use butter but find that sometimes it makes cookies flat. These turned out flat. I did like the flavour, both of oatmeal and Cinnamon. I will try again and review again.

Cookies are good...very sweet..crispy on edges and chewy in middle..I like that it has alot of oatmeal....because, um, its an oatmeal cookie!!  I think a tablespoon of cinnamon is alot....i reread the recipe at least 3 times to make sure i had the correct measurement for the cinnamon..it even made the batter brown....next time I will reduce the cinnamon by at least half, if not more....

I didn't know it was possible but this cookie has an aftertaste of the packaged oatmeal cookies which I'm not fond of. If you like that taste, this recipe is for you! Don't get me wrong, they're not horrible, in fact they are a little addicting but it's not my favorite recipe.

They're really good, we quite enjoyed them. I used pasteurized eggs because we don't use real eggs much anymore for cholesterol issues. They came out just fine using the "fake" eggs. Put butterscotch chips in them as they're for someone else but I'd have liked them best with raisins (or Raisinets, love love love those in oatmeal cookies). Thanks for sharing!

This is the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever found.!  I adjusted the cinnamon down to only 1 tsp for my personal taste.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies baked to perfection (crispy outside/chewy inside) with exactly 12 minutes in the oven!

Although I ended up tweaking this recipe, I LOVED IT! I changed shortening to 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp Coconut oil and added 1 tbsp flax seed, 2 tbsp chia seed and 1.5 cups milk chocolate chips. I baked for 13 minutes at 300 degrees in my ancient convection oven and they came out soft and chewy. They taste great and they're (slightly) healthier. Will definitely make again.... maybe next time I'll try 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup dried blueberries. yum! :)

Great recipe! I also tried the suggestion of flattening the cookies after putting rounded tablespoons in the oven for 8 minutes. Soft and Delicious! I put both chocolate chips and raisins in mine. Family loves them too.

Great cookies--wonderfully chewy!  Sounds like a lot of cinnamon, but it was the perfect amount for our tastes.  I doubled the recipe, used a medium scoop, and got 70 three-inch cookies.  I recommend lining your baking sheets with parchment paper anytime you make cookies--they come out perfectly brown on the bottom (and no need to grease pans).

Okay - I have been searching for an unbelievable oatmeal cookie and I have found it.  Crispy on the edges, soft and chewy.  I added 1 less tsp of cinnamon just because I didn't want it to be overpowering and I added coconut, pecans and craisins - everything else EXACTLY the same - WOW!!!

Fabulous basic cookie! Next time, I may try adding in some chocolate chips or dried cranberries, though they are completely tasty as written.

I made these later at night so I made them into bars to save time and they still came out great.  I used a little less cinnamon as I prefer oatmeal cookies not to be too "spicey".  These cookies are great, they have a really nice to chew to them. Thanks!

Best oatmeal cookie ever!  I tried making them with butter instead of shortening and they didn't come out good, shortening is definitely a key in this recipe.  Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside

Great recipe, I added craisins, halfed the cinnamon and used WW flour. My kids LOVED them!
You really do need to let them cool on the tray or they will fall apart. I would let them cool for at leat 10 minutes.

These have potential but are too crispy- they came out nice from the oven and then cooled and became hard.  I baked my second batch a shorter amount of time, but they still were too crispy.

I used butter - no shortening in the house - and the first batch of cookies was not flat.  The second batch, baked on a warm cookie sheet, did turn out a little flat.  Maybe the temperature had an effect.  I added some chocolate chunks and they were very good and chewy.  yum.

I have tried several oatmeal recipes over the years,and this one is what I consider,"perfect". I add walnuts to it, as my family loves them. But the recipe itself is right on the money when it comes to a great tasting cookie!!!!

meh... these have a nice flavor, but they turn out FLAT!  In the recipe's defense, it does describe the cookies as crispy. They do not turn out anything like the picture.  My dad liked them; he likes crispy cookies.

This is the first time that I made Oatmeal cookies from scratch. I usally buy a bag and make them that way. So that is why I gave it a four star. This recipe is great for a newbie and I had no prob with baking or making them. My husband who dose not like Oatmeal Rasian even went back for seconds. I made them for my neighbor who called my mom and raved about them..

I just made these and they have good flavor...I will admit I was a little worried about 1 tbl. cinnamon but I used it anyways and I'm glad I did. Also I used butter instead of shortening like one reviewer suggested. I also added about 1/4-1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Thanks

I used all butter and King Arthur organic whole wheat white flour.  I am a cinnamon lover, but I thought these were a bit heavy handed with the cinnamon, even though I cut back.  I added King Arthur extreme bittersweet chocolate chips and dried cranberries and, although they were good, I think I might have liked them better plain or with just pecans.

I am still searching for an oatmeal cookie that gets really crisp, but these are very good. Soft and chewy, but they don't spread out too much while baking. I added chocolate chips and chopped pecans, and they satisfied my sister's request. Definitely a keeper.

These are excellent!  I didn't use any chocolate chips and my kids loved them anyway (a first for oatmeal cookies!).  I did make them healthier by using organic shortening and white whole wheat flour.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper"... Thanks!

This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe that I have tried.  I add craisins, coconut, and white chocolate chips and they are amazing!  GREAT recipe!

These are great! Instead of just water, i used applesauce for more flavor, and they worked great! Also, i added cloves because i just love spicy oatmeal cookies. Mmmmm. great texture and flavor

Really delicious cookie. Not too sweet. I liked that about them. I made these again this year, and was not as crazy about them. This time I used butter. Maybe the shortening is the key?

If there were 10 STARS these cookies would get it. The only changes I made was I only had half cup brown sugar so I used full cup white sugar instead...other than that followed to a tee and these were FANTASTIC and MAKE AGAINS! What a hit. VERY Tasty!

Wow, these cookies were great!  I loved the combination of a crispy exterior with a chewy interior.  I made two batches, adding a cup of raisins to the first batch and adding a cup of mini-chocolate chips (but omitting the cinnamon) in the second batch.  These aren't the prettiest-looking cookies, but they taste better than any other oatmeal cookie I've had.

Great Recipe! Thanks for sharing. My husband who does not really like sweets liked this one. Healthy too with just one egg. We reduced the salt to 3/4 teaspoon and will probably reduce the white sugar too next time. Overall it's very good!

i thought these cookies were very good cookies (just a tad too cinnamon-y) but my boyfriend thought they were superb so we'll combine our opinions to give this recipe 4 1/2 stars. the only modifications i made were by using whole wheat flour & adding a cup of raisins to the mix. thanks kristen!

I was craving oatmeal cookies, and these hit the spot.  I wanted raisins, but my kids begged for chocolate chips to be put in the batter.  It still came out perfect.  I have added this to one of my favorite recipies!

These are amazing!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I made them for my daughter's first birthday party and everybody loved them.  It's hard to find a recipe that doesn't require raisins, nuts or chocolate chips.  These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten or baked.

My family loved these cookies with the coconut.  I used only brown sugar and added alittle more cinnamon for a nuttier taste.

I also don't think that this recipe is "Kristen's" as this is the recipe off the back of the Albertson's oatmeal that is in my cupboard.  However, this recipe really does bake up the tastiest oatmeal cookies!

margerine) and added raisins and they 
are delicious a real keeper!!

Good Job Kristen!!  My daughter and I made this one together, and we had a great time.  We recently moved to Holland, and the Dutch folks truly enjoyed the cookies!!  (Lekker!!)
