Having made them many times in my youth, cracklins are not fried pork skins.  They are the by product (solid pieces of skin and attached fat) remaining after boiling the lard out.  If you use real cracklins, you do not need to boil them before mixing into the cornbread batter.

This recipe turned out good however another method is to frie the cracklings in cast iron pan . Empty most of the grease then place cornbread batter over crackilings and bake . Turns out great .

I am glad I tried this.. it had an interesting texture and was fun to make. I personally prefer some flour in my cornbread so next time I'll probably add some.. the flavor was good
