FANTASTIC! I used stone ground cornmeal and regular whole wheat flour (not pastry). These took longer than 20 minutes. Used 1% dairy milk - didn't have soy, and did use maple syrup instead of agave. We had to make a second batch right away because we ate the first six muffins so fast!!! I served with Pumpkin Turkey Chili (used morningstar ground beef substitute for turkey) and topped all with reduced fat cheddar cheese. Heaven!!!

These were very good.  I hesitated for a minute on the five star rating because they are a little different from a standard corn muffin, but they still deserve 5 stars for their own taste.  They are a little sweeter than regular corn muffins but they are the best vegan corn muffins I've made.  They are moist and stay that way-other recipes have only been good the day I made them.  They also get points for the wheat flour.  So I say  try them!

Fabulous.  I decreased the amount of fat by using only 1 tbs oil, and adding that much more soymilk. next time I'll add more applesauce and omit the oil all together.  these muffins don't need it! Also, 1/4 c. agave is too much...so i cut in half and added more milk.

These were so tasty! I used almond milk in place of soy and grapeseed oil instead of canola, but followed the recipe exactly in everything else. It took about 25 minutes for baking. We will be baking these again. Thanks!

This was delicious and satisfied even my pickiest little eater. You'll definitely want to make sure you double this recipe. The only changes that I made was that I substituted maple syrup for Agave (didn't have enough Agave on hand) and I just used regular whole wheat flour instead of pastry flour. I also used Almond milk instead of soy (because I didn't have that on hand either). I soured up my almond milk with 1 T of apple cider vinegar (and then added enough almond milk to make 1 cup--since I doubled the recipe). Thank you for sharing this recipe. This one is definitely a keeper.

I made 2 batches of these last night. Everyone loved them. So much better than I expected. Definitely on the sweet side with the agave nectar. I used stone ground corn meal and whole wheat flour, reduced the oil to only 1 tbsp and added a couple extra tbsp applesauce. Made for a very healthy, moist muffin. Next time I'll omit the oil entirely, add flax, and more applesauce. And these are not your typical tasting "corn bread" muffins. They reminded me more of a sweet bran muffin. Would be perfect for breakfast with a drizzle of honey. The second batch I made with 50/50 agave/maple syrup. Wonderful and a bit less sweet. Definitely making these again soon.  Thanks for a wonderful, healthy recipe!

I tend to rate up on this site and I rarely give 5 star reviews.  This recipe however, is one of the few recipes on this site that truly deserves 5 stars.  It is low fat, low calorie, vegan, sugar free, and sweetener free.  As written this makes a delicious muffin.  The first time I made this I didn't read any reviews and made the muffins as is.  At he last minute I threw in some blueberries.  I didn't realize that because of the 1 tsp of salt this makes a more savory muffin.  They were still good, but the salt and the blueberries tasted a bit off.  The next time lowered the salt to a pinch, added some blueberries and lemon zest.  Next time I'm going to add some nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavour.  I'm not vegan so these would also be good with some added cheese, but it would defeat the health factor.  These muffins are great, because they can be made either savory or sweet.  Just make sure to decrease the salt if you want a more sweet muffin.

I doubled this recipe and cooked it in an 8x8.  It took twice as long to cook and was a little too sweet, but overall very good.

I cooked these at 350 for 21 mins & they were perfect! I also used whole wheat all purpose flour bc it's all I had. They are soooo delicious. Top them with Fig Butter from Trader Joes & they taste exactly like a Fig Newton!

I subbed pumpkin for the applesauce, brown sugar for the agave nectar (didn't have any) and added cranberries. An awesome way to make healthy, vegan holiday muffins!

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have applesauce on hand, so I used overripe mashed banana instead. I also substituted more mashed banana for the oil. They turned out fabulously. I especially loved how moist they were. Definitely a keeper, and one I will turn to to wow my friends.

I'm used to eating sweet cornbread, so this recipe worked well for me; it's not too sweet, but not bland either.  I used the mixture of unbleached flour and whole wheat flour (didn't have whole wheat pastry flour) and that still worked out fine.  Good with chili or just on its own.

I added 1/2 cup frozen blueberries (the small kind) and let me tell ya...they're rock your socks! They were a little sweet for me, so if you don't like them sweet, you might cut back on the agave. I'm going to try that next time by replacing some of it with either more applesauce or soy milk. Also, I think the oil could possibly be cut in half if you're looking for another way to make lighter. All in all a great recipe that could inspire other muffins in my future:)

We really liked the flavor of the agave in these.  The texture was very moist and soft. Six muffins don't last long, so definitely double the recipe!

These are YUMMY!  I had misplaced a cornbread recipe that I automatically substituted vegan ingredients for the dairy, and found this one.  I tripled the recipe (2 teen boys) and substituted maple syrup which I had on hand.  I think I will have to purchase agave syrup by the gallon now! agave syrup is an excellent honey substitute.

Just had to agree that these are really good!  Mine were a little crumbly, but that is probably because they were not cool enough - I know that papers peel off more easily if you let muffins cool.  I used 1/3 cup agave and unsweetened applesauce so they would not be too sweet.  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Perfect!  Will make them again and again.  They were very tender.

I have been making this for awhile now and this is my favorite corn muffin recipe.  I made them today and actually made the Baked Applesauce from this site and used it instead of store bought.  I didnt think this recipe could get any better but it did!!!

This recipe is okay, and the muffins certainly do come out moist.  But for me, there was too much salt, not enough flavor.  It might be better if I used vanilla soy, but I'm looking for something more corn, less muffin.

Great! I used this recipe as a base & substituted for what I had in pantry. I doubled the recipe for a batch of 12 muffins. I used half a cup of quinoa flour alongside the whole wheat ( next time I will use all quinoa for gluten-free version). I substituted the soy milk for coconut milk and added a can of corn. I also added about 1/4 cup of jarred  jalapeño slices. A lot of changes but they were goooood! I served them with lentil soup & the boyfriend  ate 4 of them!

My non-vegan husband loved these! I did change a couple things...I used egg replacer instead of applesauce because I didn't have any. I also used unflavored soy creamer because my "milk" was vanilla flavored. These turned out great, I will make these again. Thank you.

I love these cornbread muffins. They are the perfect sweet for a savory soup. I have a family of picky eaters and they all loved them. I used maple syrup instead of agave nectar becuse that's what I had and they turned out great! Thanks so much...this recipe is a keeper!

Delicious. I loved how moist they were. Honestly I was nervous when making them because the batter was so wet, but they turned out beautifully. Anything could be added to these, like herbs, shredded vegetables or chopped fruit to customize. I had to back for 25 min at 350 since I use stonewear to bake.

Made the recipe as written.  I found this was more like a bran muffin than a traditional cornbread muffin.  A little on the sweet side.  Not bad, just different. 

Trying to move more to a vegan diet.  I'll play around with this one next time.

I was looking for a cornbread muffin recipe using no eggs and came across this. I ended up doubling everything but used plain non fat yogurt for soy milk and honey for agave. It's what I had on hand. Baked at 350 for 23 minutes. Came out great!

These are WONDERFUL!!!  When my vegan daughter tried them the first she exclaimed, "They taste like I shouldn't be able to have them!"  Enough said.  Looking forward to experimenting with this great recipe as other reviewers have ie. pumpkin in place of the applesauce.  Sounds yummy!

Mine took a little longer than 15 to 20 minutes to cook because I made cornbread not muffins. I wasn't totally convinced as I'm new to veganism but when I had the first bite I said..."hmmmm, these are good!". So the reviews are right on! Great recipe!

Great recipe!  The first batch I even forgot the applesauce and they were still good, and not too dry.

These muffins are awesome!  I substituted pure maple syrup for the agave, and no sugar added apple sauce. They turned out great!  Highly recommended!

Very good and they rose beautifully! I used 1/4 cup rice flour and 1/4 cup bread flour. Also, I used maple syrup instead of agave and they are delicious! Next time I will make them into 8 muffins instead of 6 because they were too big. Thanks!

Great recipe. A little sweeter and less corn-ier than I expected for cornbread muffins, but it tasted delicious and they turned out fluffy and moist. The batter was a little watery (perhaps because I made the applesauce from scratch by blending apples, water, and lemon juice), so I baked them for 23 minutes.

I made these last week and they were great. My kids loved them too. I did make some modifications though: no oil, half the agave and plain almond milk instead of the soy.

Delicious!  Really moist, good flavor, not to sweet, just right!  I would definitely make these again because they are tasty and the ingredients I already had on hand.  I've tried recipes with pureed tofu which were really good, but I like this one because I don't always keep tofu in the fridge.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This cornbread muffin recipe was the PERFECT addition to my vegan bean chili!!  It is extremely moist and delicious. I substituted almond milk instead of soy and coconut oil instead of canola and they turned out beautifully moist. Thank you so very much for this "keeper"!

Wow! So I expected these to be good, but I didn't realize they were going to be REALLY good!! I doubled recipe, used fresh made almond milk instead of soy, kept the agave at just 1/4 c. and used about 3 tbsp of coconut oil, melted, instead of canola. I can definitely see me making this recipe often!

These are fantastic! I used almond milk and organic wheat flour. These are more "muffiny" than "cornbready" - it's the perfect mixture of both. I've eaten 2 and my black bean soup is not done yet. I highly recommend you double the recipe! Next time I will triple it for my leftover soup and snacking.

This is a great recipe, although if you are looking for a typical dry crumbly cornbread, this is not what you're looking for.  I doubled the recipe, used maple syrup instead of agave, and baked for 40ish minutes in an 8x8 pan.   Made a delicious, sweet, almost cake like cornbread which was awesome with a spicy vegan red beans and rice.  The leftovers were also wonderful the next morning with a little vegan cream cheese and fresh fruit for a great breakfast.  I will make this again and again.  This one is going into my "favorites" file.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were INCREDIBLE!  Taste WAY better than regular cornbread and MUCH more MOIST!  Only thing I had to  do differently was bake for an extra 5 min (25 min total) and they were perfect.  Thanks so much, this one's a keeper!

These were amazing!  I made for our lunch today as we were having black eyed peas for Meatless Monday.  

I used fresh ground blue cornmeal that is non-gmo; I cut back the agave nectar to an 1/8 c., as well as almond milk for soy and grapeseed oil for canola.

These is the best cornbread ever!! I cant eat it without mmmm'ing and awwww'ing! I used regular whole wheat flour insted of pastry flour. I replaced the oil with more applesauce and used honey instead of agave nectar. I froze the muffins so I can take one at a time for my lunch.

These muffins are so delicious. I did substitute maple syrup for agave because I was out. I doubled the recipe (except I only used 1/4 c maple syrup - didn't want them too sweet) I cooked them at 350 for 15 minutes because I had a turkey breast in. They came out perfect!

Yum!  My mom is a vegan and gluten free.  I've made these with spelt flour before too.  I had chunky applesauce and the bits of apple were heavenly.  I did half maple syrup and half agave which lended to a scrumptious flavor.  I also reduced the oil in half and baked the muffins at 425 degrees for 18 minutes and they were done to perfection.  Will make again for sure.

DELICIOUS.  Make a double batch - they'll go quickly!  We loved the taste so much we had these instead of dessert.  No spreads or jams necessary.  My husband loved packing them in his cooler he takes to work.  He ate 2 for breakfast with a piece of fruit.  For lunch he had 1 as a side, and for supper we had more to eat with chili.  It's so easy to make too - my almost-11 yr. old did it all on her own!  Cornbread doesn't get any better than this.  I challenge anyone out there who has an aversion to cornbread to give this a try.  You will be pleasantly surprised and will be saying, "I'll have cornbread, but ONLY if it's that Agave muffin recipe!"  ENJOY

Delish!  I had regular whole wheat flour and regular skim milk on hand so that's what I used.  I used half the agave nectar because I don't like them super sweet.  The applesauce made them fantastic.

Was a big hit.  I used whole grain fresh ground soft white wheat berry which is used for pastry flour and added 1/4 cup thawed frozen sweet corn and 2 pinches of cayenne pepper.   But the base would have been a hit with out all that.  I'll use it again and recommend it to friends.

These are good, but not much like corn bread. Closer to a bran muffin in my opinion. There is barely a sweetness to them. Mine were brown, not yellow at all. Overall they were good and I enjoyed snacking on them throughout the week.

These muffins are wonderful!  I can't get over how moist they are...and the only change I made was to decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp. for 12 muffins.  I will definitely be making these again.

AMAZING! I have multiple food intolerances, and these were something I was able to eat! Delicious! I didn't have any honey or maple syrup, so I mixed some sugar with some coconut milk and used that instead- came out great!

these are so good! used polenta instead of corn meal, canned peaches instead of applesauce cause these are as available in the uk. golden syrup, or next time treacle instead of agave and had to bake a bit longer. delicious!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe, and used maple syrup as others suggested (actually it was the fake kind of maple syrup, but it worked) and regular whole wheat flour.  It's a bit wheaty tasting for cornbread, but good in its own right.  Quick and easy--I'll definitely make it again!

Absolutely fabulous!  These were super moist and so easy to make.  The whole family loved them!  I did however make them with 1% milk because I don't like using soy milk.

I used 1/2 of the agave syrup called for as I like my cornbread a little more savory.  Even with the greased muffin tin they stuck a bit on the bottom.

Hit the spot!  I left out the oil and added a touch more applesauce and soy milk.  They were slightly bland until we added some Earth Balance- and that is what makes it five stars!  We doubled the recipe and made 12 regular sized muffins along with 10/12 minis.  I prefer recipes using Agave over sugar and will play around with this recipe from now on.  Thanks!

Will be one of a very few mainstay cornbread recipes for me.   It is pretty sweet but - but such a nice rich corn flavor and texture that I would hesitate to change a thing. Did need to bake close to 30 minutes - might be better to kick up my temp a little.

My family absolutely loved these.  I used stone ground 100% whole grain cornmeal (medium grind) which gave it a wonderful texture.  This recipe will be used often in our home.

Sorry, but mine are not vegan. Used evaporated milk/slightly diluted with water (still 1/2 cup). Then: Pumpkin puree (from can); Maple syrup; Regular white whole wheat flour (sifted, if that did anything). Everything else the same. Came out very moist. May have to bake a few extra minutes.

I made these muffins for a luncheon so I had to make 36 muffins. I was told they were really good. I used almond milk in place of the soymilk and I baked them at 350 degrees because the first batch was taking about 30 minutes to complete at 325.

Love these healthier corn muffins! I've made them many times and do a couple variations, which all work. I usually sub almond or cashew milk for soy milk, but have also made with regular milk for non-vegan version.  I've tried honey instead of agave and they turn out great! I always sub extra applesauce in place of oil. Not too sweet and great for vegans!

I really liked this recipe.  I substituted soy milk and canola oil for almond milk and coconut oil. I have a child with a dairy allergy who absolutely loves cornbread so when I showed her these she was beyond excited to have her very own cornbread. I will make these for her and the regular cornbread for the rest of the us because I do like the regular cornbread much better.  But for people with dietary restrictions, it's a really good option.

I am not vegan just out of eggs and wanted a cornbread recipe that would not use any. It was quite sweet with the applesauce and agave. I used regular milk and added some baking powder. I am GF so I used gluten free all purpose flour.

These are a favorite in our house - my son has HORRIBLE food allergies and these are the perfect sub from the tradition cornbread recipe. Sweet and moist, which = perfection. Only thing I did differently was use vanilla rice milk, because soy can be an irritant to him. Thanks!

Came out pretty good. A little too moist, but now I realize I baked it too hot (around 350), so the outside burnt before the inside. Used whole spelt and date syrup. I will make this recipe again! Might tweak the baking temps and times.

These are so easy to make and delicious. I drizzled honey over them and wow they were gone as soon as they cooled enough to eat. I did not have the applesauce so I just left it out and it did not seem to matter. Today I am going to try them with some pumpkin puree...tis the season!!

I just made this with a few adjustments. I doubled it due to my 12 count muffin pans, switched coconut milk for soy, olive oil for canola, used a rice based gluten free vegan flour mix and added 1 t xanthan gum. It took about 25-30 minutes until toothpick came out dry. Very Good!

I used 1 Tbsp. of maple syrup and 1 Tbsp of olive oil. I also added about 3/4 cup (I didn't measure) of fresh blueberries, because I was trying to duplicate a muffin I had recently. They're great!Plenty sweet (and I like my sweets) with the 1 Tbsp of syrup. Doubling the recipe is a good idea - I wish I had done that!! But they're so quick to make, I'll make another batch tomorrow.

Oh my... these are great! Just whipped up a batch to go with my vegan chili.  If you like sweet cornbread, you will like these.  I also made it with maple syrup instead of agave (that's what I have on hand). Thanks for the recipe!

These are good muffins!  Other reviewers are right; they don't taste exactly like cornbread (they have a hint of apple), but they're quite good.  

One thing, though:  I had to bake them about 5-7 minutes longer for them to be done.  I did substitute half the flour for ground flax, so that may have affected it.  I also used honey instead of agave.  

Eating them right now.  I suggest doubling it.  :)

These muffins are AWESOME!!! I did not have whole wheat pastry flour so I just used whole wheat flour and they turned out amazing!!! They were moist and delicious. I used a coarse cornmeal and found it to be so good. I like the larger cornmeal chunks. This recipe will definitely be made on a regular basis. Thanks for sharing smiithh.

These were excellent. I used maple syrup and almond milk instead. These are new my go-to cornbread.

Thanks!

Really, really good. I made 3 minor substitutions, but kept the ratios the same: apple butter for the apple sauce, regular whole wheat flour for the pastry flour, and maple syrup for the agave.

These muffins ARE sweet, but not at all too sweet. The only thing I would want to change in a future version would be to increase the ratio of cornmeal to flour; I'd have liked these to have a stronger cornmeal taste. Future spinoffs could also include orange zest & cloves for a more spice-cake profile.

The best vegan muffins I've ever had. I used homemade chunky applesauce and the chunks of apple were phenomenal.

These are great! Used almond milk instead of soy milk. Didn't use any oil at all. Just substituted a little more applesauce and everyone ate them and loved them (even the kids). Have never used the agave nectar before but will definitely be using it more.

Perfect amount of sweetness in these cornbread muffins! Dense and hearty, went nicely with the Black Bean and Salsa Soup from this site. Not sure I can go back to regular cornbread.

These are delicious!! I recently decided to become vegan and came across this recipe and gave it a try.  I couldn't find pastry flour so I used regular whole-wheat flour.  I suppose it just makes the muffins more dense, but I thought they were just fine.  The flavor is fantastic. I made two batches and brought them to a friend's house along with some Earth Balance buttery spread. Everyone liked them. My husband said they were better than regular cornbread and that I can make them anytime.  I believe I will!!

I love these muffins. like several other posters found that they requires 30 min to bake.  I have found after making these muffins about a dozen times that i double the recipe (to get 12 muffins) use maple syrup instead of agave and I add fresh blueberries. I also add a little extra baking soda to help them brown.

These are fantastic.. my new favorite cornbread. They are moist and hearty and taste even better with butter and honey. I will definitely make these again and add them to my "company" recipes. I ate these wish a tortilla & lime crusted tilapia and a salad, but they would be great with chili or roasted meats, or even gaspacho soup. And oh.. they do take much longer than 20 minutes to bake, more like 25 or 30.

Oh, my, goodness. I made these and they were HEAVENLY. I doubled the recipe and made it in an 8x8, and had to substitute pastry flour for regular whole wheat flour and agave for real maple syrup, so I'm not sure how changed it is from it's original form... But... Wow. Wonderful cornbread!

I doubled this recipe and I don't think I did anything wrong but I only came out with like 9 muffins instead of 12, maybe I just put too much batter in each tin. Oh well! I probably could have cooked them for a few minutes less because they were a tad dry but overall very delicious for vegan cornbread. Thanks!

I used Maple syrup, added more corn flour and baking soda plus a little baking powder. I cooked at 325 for 25-30min but will try 350 next time. I also made mini ones - about half the time. They will be perfect at Thanksgiving dinner where there are tons of sides!

Other than that I stuck to the recipe as written. I will  surely

I Loveeeeeee Cornbread!  When I found this "veganized" version I was ecstatic.  This recipe is  a keeper, for sure!
I made a few substitutions:  unsweetened almond milk; unsweetened apple sauce and maple syrup instead of agave nectar.  The end result was great, but it needed some additional sweetness - completely my doing, so next time, I'll add more maple syrup if I use the "unsweetened" versions of those ingredients. 
I also added a dash of  cinnamon, nutmeg and mixed essence - just because the caribbean girl in me, won't allow me to bake without them :)  I doubled the recipe and baked these for approximately 20 additional minutes.  Thanks for the receipe smithh (thumbs up)

These are great! I made a couple small changes:  I used regular whole wheat flour rather than pastry flour, and honey instead of agave.  I doubled the recipe and they turned out wonderful.  Definitely had to cook them more like 25 mins and they still came out very moist! I love the flavour but will probably cut back a little more on the sweetener next time and am looking forward to trying different variations of add-ins! Thanks!

I substituted almond milk for soy milk and it worked fine. I've never made a vegan cornbread (or one with whole wheat flour) before and this batch came out way better than expected! My go-to cornbread recipe going forward. I cooked the muffins for 18 minutes and cooled on a wire rack. I ate the first one still hot and was worried that it was undercooked because it was almost too moist, but by the time they cool down they're the perfect texture and sweetness. The flour I used was just regular whole wheat flour, not pastry flour.

Surprisingly good considering it doesn't have eggs, white flour, butter or honey. I didn't have applesauce, so I replaced that with plain organic yoghurt. I also substituted half of the wheat flour with rice flour. It was very moist and my family loved it.

These are great!! I have already made them again and made miny muffins with the recipe too, works just as well and cook only a few min less.  I also used maple syrup instead of Agave as that's what I had in my cupboard and they were delicious.  I would make them again. I doubled the recipe right from the start to get a dozen.

Loved this recipe! Had my fingers crossed as I was in search of a good vegan corn muffin recipe for my brother in law, who is vegan. I took the suggestion of others and used maple  syrup in lieu of the agave, and used half whole wheat flour and half white flour. The muffins were a hit around the table. I made a double batch but wish I had tripled or quadrupled the recipe (everyone would have eaten more muffins if I had had more in the basket)!

I cook for a vegetarian family and they love these muffins.  I always double the recipe because they disappear so quickly.  I use organic blue cornmeal and whole sprouted wheat flour in place of the pastry flour.  I also find using the 1/4 cup agave nectar makes it too sweet.  I use 1/8 cup of maple syrup instead. For health reasons I substitute coconut oil for the canola oil.  I also bake the muffins 5 extra minutes. It's such an easy recipe low in sugar and fat and goes great with vegetarian chili.

Wow, I love this recipe. It was my first vegan muffin. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of soy, and unsweet applesauce, so they weren't too sweet

EXCELLENT!  Not your traditional cornbread but so yummy that you won't notice the difference.  I made this recipe gluten-free by subbing the whole-wheat pastry flour with packaged gluten-free flour.  I also used rice milk (rather than soy milk) and homemade applesauce.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan.  My kids commented that a few apple chunks, some cinnamon, and a light glaze would turn this into an apple cake.  Delicious!

These have a much subtler corn flavor than regular corn muffins.  That said, they were delicious!  I used skim milk and about half the amount of agave syrup.  There was only enough batter for 4 regular sized muffins, so I recommend doubling the recipe.

Sorry, but we did not care for these muffins. I will not make again. There was a strange taste to them. I will stick to the traditional corn muffin recipe. I think that's what my family was expecting.

Amazing!! I didn't tell my husband (an avid "anti-health" nut) what these were made out of, and he scarfed down 3 of these in a row. I used white whole wheat flour and slightly less agave, and it came out just fine, not dense at all. I did have to bake the muffins in the top rack of the oven about 10 minutes longer, but otherwise was perfect. These taste much better room-temperature than warm, and would be delicious with cream cheese (or non-dairy version) and jam on top.

Amazing!!! Better than normal corn muffins, in my opinion. I didn't use salt, and these still turned out great. Next time, I'll reduce the sweetness a bit so I don't feel so guilty eating these. I love that these are moist without having a ton of oil!

I just made this recipe last night to go with my vegan black bean chili. It was delicious! My husband said that it was the best cornbread he has ever had. I did not have soy milk, so I substituted it with almond milk. Worked great as well. Instead of pastry flour I used equal parts of stone-ground whole wheat and unbleached cake flour. Worked marvelously! I had to increase my baking time to 20 minutes as well. Overall, easy and delicious!

These were better than I expected, I'll probably make them again! I followed the recipe as is, only changed out the agave nectar for maple syrup (that's what I had and that keeps it vegan!).

This is 5 star worthy! I did change it a bit by using gluten free flour and organic 2% milk and a can of corn in a doubled batch. They took about 30 minutes. They were moist and not even crumbly. The BEST Ever. I also used a tablespoon of stevia bulk in place of half of the agave.

YUM! I'm not vegan, but my brother has an egg allergy, so I've been experimenting with vegan recipes.  These are light and moist and sweet! They aren't greasy because there is no butter, and they rise wonderfully. My family couldn't believe there were no eggs-they are so fluffy! And they come out of the oven BEAUTIFULLY! The tops get perfectly round and they don't stick to the pan (even though mine's old and nasty). This recipe is definitely a keeper!

these came out too gummy and dense. toothpick came out clean but the texture was rubbery almost. also they barely rose at all in my muffin pan, they were like little gummy hockey pucks. followed recipe exactly, measure ingredients with a food scale, and i rarely have problems with recipes not coming out correctly. maybe i will try tweaking this and giving it another go, but as written i can not give it more than 1 star because i really "couldn't eat it."

My husband and I are not vegan but this recipe looked good so I made it with a pot of beans.  Delicious!  I don't like soy milk so used regular and all I couldn't find whole wheat pastry flour so used whole grain pastry flour.  Not sure there was any flavor or baking difference.  I poured the batter into 12 cups instead of six and baked them a shorter time.  These were just so moist and yummy!

Enjoyed this healthy recipe. I am not Vegan but wanted a healthy choice for cornbread. So this was exactly what I was looking for.
Everyone seemed to enjoy them. I doubled the ingredients to 12 muffins as 6 wasn't enough for all of us and even switching it to 12 it actually made about 16 as I didnt fill them all the way up. Next time I think I will fill them close to the top as they don't rise like normal muffins. They rose up a little bit.

This has become a staple recipe on our home! We all love it. The only change I made was to use unsweetened almond milk instead of soy milk. Thanks for such a fantastic vegan recipe!! Oh, and make sure to double the recipe because they won't last!

I'm not vegan, but I like to experiment with baking. I stumbled upon this recipe and thought I would give it a try. It is honestly better than any "real" cornbread I've ever had. The muffins were incredibly moist and full of taste! This just became a regular snack for me!

I added mango mashed instead of applesauce and honey as I did not have agave syrup. My son & I thought that it turned out quite delicious.

GREAT cornbread!  Everyone loved it!  Very moist.  It was a tad sweet for me, so I will use just a little bit less agave next time.

These were delicious!  I substituted coconut milk for soy milk and olive oil for the canola but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out wonderful.  One of the best cornbreads I've had and probably the healthiest!
