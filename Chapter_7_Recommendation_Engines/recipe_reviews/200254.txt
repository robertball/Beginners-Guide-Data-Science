this is surprisingly decent.  if you are vegan, you will think this is the bomb! if you are a regular meat/dairy eater like me, you'll say "hmmm, tastes alittle like soy".  not that bad though. i used the blender and the cake is very smooth & creamy.  i also made my own graham cracker crust (crackers/butter/sugar) and i did spread some thinned-out strawberry jam on top. i got a HUGE package of tofu from Costco and was looking for something to do with it.  it also makes a great pareve dessert for those that are kosher.

I've tried this. The trick is to Add REAL vanilla flavoring to the tofu the day before, the sugar, and lemon juice. Blend this together with food processor or super high powered blender. If your blender sucks you wont get a good consistency. Once blended, pop this in the fridge and let it set over night or the next 2 days so the Vanilla flavor can overpower the bean taste. If you like a little kick to your cheesecake, add some other flavoring (rum, coconut, strawberry, almond etc.) and let the tofu marinate in the chosen flavoring over night. Add the other ingredients after the marinating and then bake. Tastes JUST like cheesecake!

I used the extra firm tofu as suggested and no matter how much I used the blender, the consistency wasn't smooth at all and the flavour was awful, in fact it was disgusting.  Most disappointng!!!  I don't appreciate having my review altered.  What's the point in doing reviews if they can be changed.

This is a great recipe for starters, but mine was runny and did not really taste like "cheesecake." Remade it with following changes: added two large eggs and two tablespoons white flour, plus the grated rind of a lemon, and mixed in food processor.  THOSE results were very NY Cheese-cake-ish, and a great pareve desert with strawberries.

I followed recipe exactly, but it was not cooked for at least another 1/2 hour. It tasted nothing like cheesecake. We topped with fresh strawberries.  One daughter said it reminded her of rice pudding. Most adults just said it was "different" but no one got a cheesecake feel from it. Most said it didn't taste bad, it just wasn't what they were expecting.  I doubt I will try it again

This turned out really good.  My husband who is a serious cheesecake fan even liked this a lot.  I did add in a small amount of dairy free cream cheese.  But, not enough to really change the recipe much.  Also, for those who are not getting the tofu creamy enough, ensure that you are using Mori Nu Silken Firm Tofu.  You will know that you are using the right stuff because it will come out of the box very silky and smooth looking to begin with.  The other tofu's are not silky smooth even before blending.  This is really a good recipe.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. The consistency was excellent and it held up very well. I'm thinking that maybe those who didn't get a smooth consistency used the wrong type of tofu. My only gripe is that this is a little too sweet for me, and I have a sweet tooth... The next go round, I'll probably add more lemon juice and less sugar. :)

This was tastey and very satisfying...although it took significantly longer than 30 minutes to cook.  I added a blueberry topping, and it tasted great...a definite bonus to my evolving veganism!

First, if you are not vegan or vegetarian, let me warn you, this will NOT taste like a traditional cheesecake you are used to.  However, that being said, if you go into this, looking for an alternative cheesecake-like dessert, realizing that anything with tofu in it will NOT taste like cream cheese, then you should be fine.
I personally am not a vegan or vegetarian, however I do like to eat like one periodically to give my body a rest from animal products.  So when I took a class on vegan cooking at our local whole foods market, we were introduced to this recipe.  I like it!  It's got a consistency like cheesecake as long as you use a good quality tofu.  There are several different types of 'firm' tofus out there and getting a good quality, usually paying a bit more, at a whole foods or vegan grocer, you will have better results.  I tried this recipe once, with a tofu brand I was not familiar with from my local regular grocery store and I think they must have frozen the tofu prior to being on the shelf, which some grocers do, not knowing that it changes the consistency and the usability drastically.
To the other reviewer that couldn't get her tofu to blend properly, I would bet that her tofu was frozen at one time.
If you are wanting to surprise your vegan and/or vegetarian friends with a treat, I would recommend this.  They will enjoy it since they are accustomed to the flavors of tofu and would be very appreciative.  I made this for my step-daughter and she was in heaven!

I used the blender and it got very smooth.  I am not a vegan, so I added chocolate chips.  Not as thick as cheesecake, but ended up tasting like cookie dough.  I loved it!

WOW!!  I never thought a tofu cheesecake would taste so good.  I was wrong!  I'm so happy to have found this recipe as I have many vegan friends.

the husband and i are total dessert heads. in an effort to stave off the extra pounds, i try to only make vegan desserts with whole ingredients and without a lot of added sugar. i thought i would try this one to go with some fresh blueberry sauce i had leftover from breakfast, and it definitely exceeded our expectations. the first time i made it, i halved the sugar and doubled the lemon juice, then baked for 50 minutes, and it came out great. i will trade the density of real cheesecake for the healthfulness of organic non-gmo tofu and lack of guilt any day!!! i'm making this pie again with lime juice and lime zest instead of lemon to try and emulate the feel of a key lime pie. thanks for a good, SIMPLE vegan recipe.

I beat this for a long time and couldn't get the tofu to get creamy or smooth. The tofu taste was really strong and basically inedible. I know this can successfully be done but I think silken tofu may be the right form of tofu to use to get a smoother cheesecake.

I halved the recipe and baked it in 6 small premade graham cracker crusts. I only gave it 4 stars because it came out a bit too lemony, but I did halve the recipe so that could have been the cause. In all it tastes great! I topped with fresh strawberries and that hid the lemony taste. It's a very dense cheesecake. I will definitely try this again, but maybe try using lime instead of the lemon and topping with fresh blueberries.

The texture of this was unbelievable - so creamy, just like real cheesecake! The flavor, however, was not so great. Surprisingly, it had a VERY strong tofu flavor. :)  I didn't use lemon juice, so maybe that would have somehow disguised the flavor better, but since I was using chocolate graham crackers for the crust (they were all I had), I added cocoa powder rather than lemon to the cheesecake mixture and thought that would disguise the tofu flavor...but no. It was okay, but it needed serious doctoring up in order to taste more like dessert and less like tofu. I will have to try stronger flavors the next time I make this - perhaps using canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice? Maple syrup? But I will definitely make this again! Seriously, the texture is great. I also love the (relative) healthfulness of this concept. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe! It does not taste like cheese cake because it is NOT cheese cake. It is tofu cake and it is a DELICIOUS tofu cake! Would not mind a way to make it creamier. And wouldn't mind a way to infuse some more flavors into it. Not sure how I'd do that, but could be amazing with Kluah? 

I also had to bake it longer... Like about twice as long.but it was yummy!

Tasted great. The texture wasn't like cheesecake, though. Came out sort of like finer curd cottage cheese. Topped it with blackberries but I think another fruit would be better.

Based on previous reviews:  I cut the sugar to 3/4 c., tripled the amount of vanilla, added 2 eggs and 2 T tapioca flour. I got it smooth using a hand blender. It took a little over an hour to bake.  Pretty good, but needed strawberry topping to hide the slight tofu flavor.  My picky dairy-free son did like it, and he LOVES (and misses) real cheesecake, so thank you!

Great simple recipe that can easily be altered for your own taste preference. I used silken tofu and switched the vegetable oil for coconut oil. I added lime juice and zest and added dessicated coconut and vegan coconut spread,I also used an oaty base I baked for 25 min. So yummy!

I made this using 1 silk tofu & 1 extra firm tofu. I also used butter for oil. I added 1 egg & 1 cup coconut for a friend who loves coconut ;, too. For crust I used 1 c.crushed pretzels; 1/4 c.sugar; 1/4 c. butter & 1 c. coconut.  I placed the crust in a bundt pan pressed against the outer side & bottom. I poured the batter in and cooked from 30 min to an hour until well set. After cooling I released w/knife the crust from the pan and the set "custard" from the inner side. After turning the pan over a base plate I placed it in the frig to cool.  I cut 25 pieces.  Really, really good ;)

I didn't try this particular recipe, but I have had tofu cheesecake and liked it.   I just found out something about tofu from a Japanese friend and thought I'd pass it along, although many people may know it.  This recipe doesn't say to drain the tofu,  and for a recipe like tofu steak, for instance, you have to drain it very well.  Those who got a runny product may want to drain the tofu for a day or more in a cold place and then put a paper towel on top and press down with a heavy object to get the last of the liquid out.

I made it without any topping and used a gluten free graham cracker crust. My teenage girls begged me to make it again.  When I told them what it was made of they were surprised but asked  me to still make it.

This recipe is excellent! However the type of tofu that is needed to excute this properly is not listed other than "extra firm". You'll need silken extra firm tofu to achieve the "cheesecake" like texture. I substituted the sugar for whipped honey(2 1/2 tbsp) and used a vegan pudding powder mix that was cheesecake flavored (2 tbsp available in Whole Foods)

I added 1/4 cup of flour. After an hour it was still very soft so I left it for another hour at 250. The texture isn't consistent and it kinda separated a bit. It's a bit wet. Flavour is somewhat like cheesecake. I made a strawberry sauce for on top.

This isn't a perfect recipe, but it IS a very good base on which to experiment.

I used silken firm tofu (all I could find).  I also accidentally left out the oil, and I'm glad I did.  And after reading some of the reviews, I cut the sugar down to 3/4 C.  

The texture was great.  Not like a dense cheesecake, but it *is* like some lighter cheesecakes I have had.  I didn't love the flavor by itself, but we topped with a dollop of cherry pie filling and it was FANTASTIC!  Especially because I used a chocolate graham crust.  

This was a hit.  Next time, I'm going to play with irish cream type flavoring, or perhaps go strongly on vanilla and almond extract.

I was really impressed with how well this turned out, I really liked it and it was gone by the next day.   I think draining the tofu is a really important step.  I wrapped the block of tofu in paper towels and then wrapped that in cloth towels before placing a cutting board on top with weights on top of that.  I read it's advised to drain for 30 min or so but I did it for several hours, changing out the towels when they got soaked.  By the end, the block of tofu felt like a dense block of cheese.   I am definitely going to make this again and again.  Also, there was only firm and extra firm at the store and neither of them were Silken but the extra firm, after proper draining came out so smooth and creamy!

Love it!  It’s not cheesecake but it’s very good.  I added strawberry topping and fresh strawberries.  I had to bake almost 50 minutes.

I think it's a great base. What I mean by that is that while it's almost complete on its own, I feel like you can definitely add more to it to alter the flavor to your liking. (about to make this again tonight and planning to zest a lemon into the batter!)
I highly recommend using Speculoos Cookies instead of Graham Crackers for the crust. I just use the whole package of Trader Joe's Speculoos Cookies and 8 tablespoons of Earth Balance. That's it. Simplicity is key.

This is my first time trying this recipe.  I was using a hand mixer at first but quickly realized that I needed something better.  I popped it in my Ninja blender and it came out nice and creamy.   
 I added cocoa and a little mint as I blended too.  I am allergic to gluten so I started with a homemade, gluten free graham crust, then spread chocolate chips on the crust and poured in the tofu mix.  I had some dried cranberries that I sprinkled on top before trying (Christmas time).  Delicious together.  You could really add just about any topping.  Nice gluten free/dairy free alternative.

You must use silken or it will not  work. That is why lots of people got bad results.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Turned out great!  My vegan son in law couldn't believe it was tofu cheesecake!!

Fabulous! I loved it! The texture was perfect and I made a strawberry sauce to go with it and it was superb! By itself however I will not recommend especially if you are not a a big soy fan, but if you are you wont mind.

I used the extra firm tofu and the consistency was awful. I think this would work out great with silken tofu, as it breaks down more easily and has more of a cheesecake texture. It tastes ok, but not really like cheesecake. It's great as it's own dessert.

NOT a replacement for cheesecake, but it IS a healthy alternative.
I added 1-2 Cups fresh strawberries, to make strawberry cheesecake.  I brought it in to work for a potluck, as many co-workers are vegan.
The vegans loved it, and have asked for the recipe.

I just made this, I loved it!!! Only thing I did different was leave it in oven longer.. Altogether cooked it for an hour and 10 mins then I let it cool down added sugar free strawberry paste n strawberries n let it refrigerate over night. It did have more of a custard texture to it but it was delicious??

It was too sweet for me. My daughter tried some too and she usually eats everything, but rejected it after one small bite.

Pleasantly surprised... we're not vegan - just trying to make some healthier choices - made a warm berry coulis with just 3 tbsp of sugar for sweetening...yummy enough that even our 10 yr old enjoyed it.

Most definitely use silken tofu. It was creamy but not rich like cheesecake at all. I baked it for 1 hour. The taste was a bit too sweet for me. I needed the tartness of lots of strawberry topping to counteract the sweetness.

I made this a few days ago. It was wonderful! But because I'm gluten free I used a nut recipe for the crust. It was amazing!!!
