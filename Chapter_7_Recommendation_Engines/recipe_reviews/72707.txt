This is good for veggies, peppers, eggplant, mushrooms, squash, fish, shrimp, chicken, onion rings, and dill pickle chunks.  Similar to an old Bisquick recipe.  First, before you fry anything, make sure your oil has a high smoke point (peanut or canola) so it doesn't burn too quickly.  Second, heat your oil plenty hot, because if it is too cold, your food will be heavy and greasy.  A bit of batter should float and sizzle in there at the right temperature without burning up.  Third, wash and pat your food dry and dust it with some dry pancake mix before dredging it in the wet batter to make it stick well.  Fourth, use the best beer you can afford and two tablespoons of a salty seasoning like cajun or Old Bay for flavor.  Fifth, don't crowd your food, fry in multiple batches if necessary, and fry in hot oil until the food floats to the top and stays there.

I have been using a similar recipe for years and it is great for making onion rings too!  My recipe calls for a dash of hot sauce and a few sprinkles of Old Bay seasoning added to the container.  Very good.

I wouldn't call it quick; battering the fish can be a little time consuming. Won't deny that is indeed tasty though, and easy for the most part! Will definitely be making this again.

I used tilapia as I am not a trout fan/it was a hit at home. My version was a 5 for us....I gave the version "as is" a 4 because it is a bit bland and I did make some minor changes. I added 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 TB of lemon juice....I do the same thing to the pancake batter at home for pancakes because it makes it lighter/fluffier...just a personal preferance.....so since I make my pancakes that way I did the same with a pancake based recipe. The thing that was more of an issue is this batter is a great base but totally lacks seasoning. I added 1/4 tsp each of salt, pepper, paprika, garlic and Cajun seasoning. To the person that it came out oily: sounds like your oil was not hot enough.

For poor man...this is great. The cost of the fish is not so great. But where I'm at I didn't have acccess to fresh, but it was frozen. Plus my grocer did not have trout. SO I purchased an arrange for fish selections to try & see what worked & tasted best with what was offered.. I purchased Cod, Tilapia, Perch & Flounder filets. Each had done rather well but there were some drawbacks.. While they were all good with the batter. The longer the batter sits as your dipping and frying the less the batter tends to be nice and thick. The Cod was the 1st to dunk into the batter & it puffed and golden really well & was a favorite. Totally delish, but the batter in the beginning has a slight sweetness to. But with the rest of the fish, that disappeared. Note: did use buttermilk brand. The perch had the skin on & that made my fish curl in the frying process & batter wasn't thick but rather thin. The Tilapia, I cut down the center & fried. It was also a favorite, the batter on the Tilapia was really nice & stayed well coated. The Flounder was delish as well & did the same thing as the Perch. It thinned. But as I realize in the process. The reason is because Perch & Flounder are moister & holds more liquids there for the water was sweating out threw the batter making it thinner. But it still worked. Using the cod & tilapia was quite nice. This is a quick and easy recipe. Will make again. I used wheat beer, will try a malt one next time.

It doesn't get any easier than this! I used this recipe when I made fish for my wife and 75 yo mother. I got a thousand praises for it and thought I would pass some on to you! Plan on using this next time we camp. Thanks Psycho!

This was a really good and really quick batter.  I used it for frying onion rings and fresh veggies out of the garden.  I used Krusteaz pancake batter mix and it turned out really good.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 though, just because I've made better beer batters before, but for the ease of this recipe, it is definitely a keeper and I will definitely use it again.

Everyone in my family loved this batter.  I followed another reviewers suggestion of 2/3 cup water,  2/3 cup milk, and 1/8 cup baking powder.  Came out great.

The only reason I gave this two stars is for the choice of fish.  Don't use trout filets.  They're full of bones and too fishy tasting.  Use some type of white fish, like cod.

This was my first attempt at frying fish, and I thought it worked out well. I fried it in a deep fryer rather than in a pan so it wouldn't be as messy and I overcooked it a bit. Next time I'll pull it out of the fryer a bit earlier.
Still, it was good and really easy. I did add a bit of Old Bay and hot sauce to the batter for seasoning, which pepped it up a bit.

To the person who left a two star review, because trout is fishy and boney.........Fish does not taste fishy, nor smell fishy if it is fresh. Try buying your fish from somewhere that sells fresh products. A trout has the same bone pattern as a salmon, I catch salmon and trout all the time, if filleted properly and the pin bones are pulled out of the fillet, there should be no bones at all in it.  This recipe is great, for the simple fact it is easy. Any recipe that only takes 4-5 ingredients is great in my book! I'm also giving a 4 out of five because I have had some from scratch recipes that are a little bit better.

This turned out great. It was mostly user error however. Make sure your grease or oil is on a high temp before you put the fish in, otherwise the batter will get all clumpy, run off the sides of the fish and stick to the pan.  It should literally crackle if you toss some flour or water in the pan. It was a delicious recipe !

The batter itself is very tasty. But there wasn't enough oil to fry the fish and all the batter ended up getting stuck on the pan. Next time I will use a deep fryer.

I didn't like this recipe for a few reasons. First and foremost, make 100% sure that you are using white lake trout instead of the salmon-like ocean trout which will be too fatty. (I made the mistake.)This recipe also didn't work for me because the pancake batter was cooked perfectly when the inside of the fish was still raw. Some people would eat that, (tuna tartar) but I decided to bake it until it was cooked. Also, it soaked up a little too much oil for my taste, so I would suggest you use a thermometer to make sure your oil is at the perfect temperature, but if you're using lake trout, go ahead and give this easy recipe a try.

Added seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, mrs. Dash). Dried fish with paper towel & floured the pieces before putting them in the batter. Was a great hit with the kids & grown ups. I made a bunch so was able to make it with a dark & light beer. Equally good but the dark beer batter browned quicker.

Make sure your oil is hot enough if your fish is turning out soggy, first of all. Very important. This recipe is VERY easy - the people I served it to were very impressed. I used Leinekuegel's Summer Shandy which gave a wonderful lemon flavor to the dish. While it's not necessarily the most delicious breaded fish I've ever had, it's still darn tasty and much easier so I had to give it five stars. I'll be making this again soon, I'm sure.

I didnt use the pancake mix due to adding more carbs... marinate my speckled trout in can of beer & yellow mustard...  the key is to get your temp to 350 to fry... if not,it is oily &* soggy no matter what batter you use..

I made this for dinner last night and my husband loved it! I used Tilapia fillets...and served the fish with sweet potato fries. I made my own tartar sauce using mayo, pickle relish, lemon juice, and a pinch of sugar.

I think I made too much batter, so I sliced up an onion and made onion rings! I have to admit, the batter didn't coat as well as I would have liked, but it was definitely delicious! The whole meal came together perfectly!

Not bad at all! Mental note, the batter sticks better if the fish isn’t frozen. I was in a time crunch so it didn’t thaw completely before I cooked it but it still turned out good. Would make it again

Okay now this looked like my kind of recipe.  I came home from fishing with very nice fillets.  Ling cod.  Stopped at the store and got everything listed including a 6 pack of beer.  Put everything in the fridge and Drank 2 beers.  Ordered pizza.  
Day two. - whipped up the batter as directed, used two egg whites instead of one egg, used much less salty, salted and peppered  fish, placed in dry flour before dipping in batter, and then into the hot grape seed oil.  Perfect, absolutely perfect.
Wasabi mayo instead of tartar sauce.  Malt vinegar on a  few pieces.  Very nice.  Serve with IPA beer
Enjoy

Cooked some freash caught walleye in this batter 1 cup pancake mix to 1 cup beer was enough for a medium ziplock bag of fillets was super good even my wife eat it and she hates fish.
Just make sure your oil if very hot when you fry it.

I use self- rising flour. Pancake mix is a little to sweet for my taste. If you don't have the self- rising flour, add some yeast to some regular flour. Measure nothing. Go for batter consistency.

These were so good! We saw this in a recent AR magazine & had to try it during 'beer batter' night. Delicious! We used Bud Light Lime & it was a hit with everyone.

This recipe does not work AT ALL, tried two different skillets, dredging in dry first and not, etc. no matter what, I wound up with a big pile of mush. :(

AWFUL recipe and I will never use this again!  The "batter" didn't fry up well at all - crumbled and burned, and had a noxious taste (sweet and greasy).  From now on I'll make my own batter.  I totally ruined otherwise good cod.

I used this recipe when I went camping. It was very easy and tasteful, not to mention a nice texture. I would definitely make again.

This is an awesome camping recipe for fish and/or veggies.  I always add some seasoning (whatever I have on hand) to the pancake mix before I add the beer.  Then shake, shake, shake dip and fry!!  Yummy

(i made the pancakes as directed on the box because i was making them at home)

we tried this and it was a disaster. the coating stuck to the pan while cooking so only a couple of pieces looked edible. But also the pancake batter really soaks up the oil making everything taste heavy.  Definitely not a favorite.
