This was a lot of work, but oh so worth it! If you want less work, don't worry about making a cake, just makes your crepes, top with whip cream and chocolate sauce, and roll it!
The Salted Chocolate Orange Sauce stole the show! I put my extra in a jar and kept it in the fridge. Delicious when used to make cocoa and as a cake filling!

I only made the crepe part of this recipe and the crepes were great. I made two batches of crepes. The first batch I made the crepes right away. They were yummy but very airy. The second batch I let  the batter sit for 5 hours and the crepes were very smooth! So delicious!!!

Amazingly easy!  I simply added strawberries to top it off.  I think you could easily cut the sauce in half though...it really made a lot of sauce.

For the amount of work, it wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  A bit dry.
