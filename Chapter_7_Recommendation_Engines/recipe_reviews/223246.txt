This was my dinner tonight. I did not have fresh dill, I used one teaspoon dried dill weed. I also added a pinch of sea salt. I made no other changes. Not only was it delicious, it was low in calories and carbs which tickled me. This. Is. AWESOME. I know I will be making this recipe a lot this summer. NOTE: You know, this would make a GREAT base for tzakiki sauce, too.

Very nice light and refreshing salad! Plus it's a perfect way to use up fresh cucumbers from the garden! I added a little salt to the thinly sliced the cucumber and let that set for about twenty minutes to let the cucumbers produce their own water then drained. I also used white wine vinegar vs. lemon juice as it's a bit milder. I chilled it for a couple of hours and it was delicious! A very nice combination of flavors and a great summer side dish - thanks!

Cucumber salad just the way we like it - with fresh and light lemon juice rather than vinegar, and no sugar.  I also loved the addition of the very thinly sliced red onion which gave it just a little bit of a bite.

The original recipe for this called for 3 cucumbers. Because my grandparents had their own garden, they always used homegrown vegetables, which were grown without pesticides and picked before the deer and animals could get them. This means that they were smaller than the cucumbers you often find in the grocery store today. Because of this, you may need to increase the sour cream in this recipe, depending on how much cucumber you have. When I mnade this using 3 large cucumbers from the grocery store, I ended up putting a cup of sour cream. Adjust accordingly and also to your personal preferences. The best way to make this is to add what you like! More dill, less onion, greek yogurt... This is very versatile.

Delicious! I didn't have fresh dill or red onion, so i used 1 tsp dried dill and finely sliced green onion. Usually make this salad with vinegar and a bit of sugar...was out of vinegar, so tried this one using lemon and no sugar. Have to say, I like it better! Big hit with the family. Also, used a dash of seasoning salt instead of plain salt. Oh, and for slicing the cucumbers super thinly, I use the slicer side of my cheese grater. Fast and efficient!

Sometimes simple recipes are better, as I found with this one. Few ingredients required, all of which I had on hand. I used fresh dill and cucumbers from the local farmer's market. I made this about a half an hour before serving, which I think helped bring out the flavor of the dill and onion. I served this as a side with chicken grilled with greek seasoning and pita bread and loved it.

This was such a fabulous, light summer salad! The onion and dill taste great and complement the cucumber. I'll be making this again soon.

So yummy and very refreshing! It was very easy to make and a nice change from the typical summer salads (macaroni, pasta, potato.) 3 cucumbers made a lot, so next time I am going to use 2.

I thought this kind of tasted like a salad version of taziki. I made a 1/2 recipe and used seedless English cucumbers. I had to sub dry dill, because it was all I had. I did 3/4 tsp. dry for half the recipe. It seems to wilt the cucumbers kind of fast, with the lemon juice. However, although it wasn't a favorite salad of mine, I would consider mixing up the dressing part, again, just for dipping vegetables.

A perfectly refreshing summer salad! I HIGHLY suggest using low fat Daisy sour cream, to keep the dressing thick and creamy. It's the best brand I have found in low fat sour creams. I did use dried dill and let the salad sit for about a half an hour in the fridge before serving and it really brought out the flavor.

Here's the good and the bad.  What I like about this is the taste...it's good.  What I don't like about it is that the sour cream dressing is so liquid-y that it just doesn't coat the cukes well.  I used Publix house brand sour cream which tends to have more liquid than the brand names, so this may have contributed.  Next time (yes, I'm going to try again) if I use the Publix brand, I will let the sour cream drain for a while (like you do with yogurt) to see if that will thicken it.  It certainly is a nice cold side dish for summer and its heart healthy nutritional breakdown is fantastic.

I love this salad! My mom used to make this in the summer and I would eat a huge heaping helping of it. I had totally forgotten about it until browsing on here for recipes with cucumbers when I ran across it. I'm making it tonight for a side since I am grilling hamburgers and corn. Mmm...I cannot wait to dig into it!

Oh my gosh, this was such a great change in pace from all the mayonnaise filled salads that are typical for the summer. I made this for dinner to go along with kabobs, and it complemented the meat and veggie skewers perfectly.

I used 3/4 cup sour cream, 2 tsp dried dill and only 1tbsp lemon juice. Also didn't add the cucumber till ready to serve. Was a wonderful way to use up cucumbers from my garden!

Just made this for a gathering on a 100+ degree day.  It will be so refreshing. Used fresh cucumbers from my garden.  Delicious!  I did substitute 1/4 cup softened cream cheese and 1/4 cup sour cream.  Better than I had ever anticipated!  YUM!!!  Plan to make this as long as I have cucumbers this summer!

A friend from Latvia made this for me once. I love cucumbers but usually not cucumber salad. She said this is how her grandmother taught her to make it. It's really good. I like to use lots of sweet onions in mine.

Love this sooo much!  I didn't have any red onion, so just left it out. And I did add some garlic, because I love garlic. :)  Perfect way to use up some cukes out of the garden.

Both my husband and I loved this delicious salad.  I have been making cucumber salad for years, but this recipe is my favorite.  I also thinly sliced some radishes for flavor and color.  I made this to go with the Greek Chicken Pasta recipe from this site.

I had a lot of fresh dill from my garden and found this recipe.

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  I probably used 1/4 cup of fresh dill for one cucumber.

The only change I made was used white vinegar in place of lemon as I didn't have any on hand.  I also added garlic powder for a bit more flavor.  Very good will make again

Made as directed, too much lemon for me and became watery quick, even with Daisy brand. Just not my thing...

I was looking for a cucumber recipe that would be like one my mother used to make.  This one comes very close and I think is actually better.  The only changes I made was to substitute sliced scallions for the red onion and white pepper for the black pepper.  In light colored sauces, I just prefer the look of white pepper over black.  Thanks, Brandilynn7, for submitting this one!

Really like this recipe. It was light and refreshing. My only suggestion is to cut back on the lemon juice but this is just a personal preference.  The second time I made it I used lime juice instead and it was just as delicious. I will continue to make this alot. It's great in a sandwich, on salad and I even put it on a baked potato. Just fantastic!

Very nice cucumber salad that I have made many times. I sub dried dill because that's what I have. I'm sure fresh would be even better! Eat this up because it doesn't keep very well.

This was fantastic and easy.  I thought it would get watery from the cucumbers but it didn't and I did not have to worry about left overs because it was all gone

The taste is good, but the texture gets me. The lemon juice makes the sour cream kind of foamy. The effect stays even as leftovers. That's the only reason why I gave it 3 stars. Taste was yummy.

Sounded like a nice change to cucumber salad to try sour cream. However, that is all we could taste....was sour cream.
