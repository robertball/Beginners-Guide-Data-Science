I liked this a lot.  I didn't cook the filling as long as I was supposed to (it just seemed to be getting too cooked), but it ended being tender enough. I served it with vegetarian mulligatawny. Sweet and spicy - great mix.  Thanks!

Wow!  This is similar to one I love in a local Indian restaurant.  I was hesitant to try it as it only had one review, but, Wow! I cooked mine on my bread board and found that 8 minutes was perfect.  The ones I cooked for 10 minutes were a little overdone.  This is a great basic naan recipe to start with for stuffed naan.  Can't wait to try it with garlic.  This will be a favorite in my house.  Thank you for sharing.

Easy to make!  The herbs and spices are different, but they go together well!  I'll be making these again!

I modified this to make pershwari naan. I used half of the spices and used cali golden raisins, mac nuts and almonds, i used a mallet to hammer them into small bits and once in the pan i added four TB of honey, it makes it taste better. But this recipe was so amazing!!!

Fantastic recipe, very rich in taste! Will definitely make it again. The only issue i had was with the flaked coconut - couldn't taste it at all, it's a delicate taste which was lost in the sharpness of the rest of the spices. Probably because mine wasn't very fresh either, had opened the box before already. Do you have any ideas for making the coconut taste more potent?
