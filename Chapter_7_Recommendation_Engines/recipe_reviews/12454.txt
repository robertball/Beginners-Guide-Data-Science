I've made this pie a few times now, my friends and family love it!  They could've never guessed what was in it, it tastes a lot like pumpkin pie.  I do cut the sugar back to 1 1/2cup and its still plenty sweet.  I also add 1tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the mixture while its proccessing instead of the nutmeg.

WOW! I too have a household of zucchiniphobes! My family(& I) loved this recipe. I baked it a little longer as the knife never DID come out clean but took it out of the oven after 1.5 hrs to prevent the crust from burning. The pie set lovely as it cooled on the counter & though my family preferred to call it "Harvest Pie" rather that the "Z" word I am planning to make this again for Thanksgiving.. zucchini is very easy to grow & versatile in the kitchen. Bon Apetit!

This was very good.  I baked it for 1 hr and 10 minutes.  There was enough filling for 2 pies.  I don't know how you would fit this all in 1 9'' pie crust.  Also I only had 1 1/2c of condensed milk so I used 1/2 c of whole milk and didn't notice a differerence.  Thanks for another good zucchini recipe.

Awesome! I use fat-free evap. milk and cut back to 1-1/2 cups of sugar and it's still out of this world. I have a very very picky eater friend and he loved this! Even wanted more!

The zucchini pie was very good and easy to make. The ingredients were things that you have on hand and didn't need to go to the store. Tastes like a custard pie.

I'm not a big fan of zucchini but this was an awesome pie!!! The flavor was great. I ended of making 3 pies for my family & 2 for my neighbor. This is definately a pie that goes with any holiday meal or just if you're in the mood for something sweet.

I really don't understand the great reviews on this pie.  It is way too sweet, and like the other reviews I have read it does take longer than an hour to bake.  I don't think it resembles pumpkin pie at all!  this is a custard pie. I would not recommend this recipe, there are so many other great ways to use up that Zucchini without wasting all those other ingredients.

I would never guess this pie has zucchini in it by the taste. Great taste, smooth texture; I loved it!

My family first said, "It smells good but I wish you hadn't told me what was in it".  Afer tasting the pie they said "I have a new favorite pie".  I did reduce the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and used one 10 oz can of evaporated milk and added enough 2% milk to make 2 cups.  Absolutely wonderful seasoned with about 12 grates of a nutmeg and a teasp of cinnamon.  This recipe is a keeper.

My Dad and sister were like, "hmmmm......Zucchini pie, really?"  Of course, after the first bite they both LOVED it.  I only saved a one piece for this household, but will be making again tonight to try it myself!  I did think the pie looked like a custard pie, and smelled like a pumpkin pie. That may be due to adding 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  I also cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 C. per other reviews.   My sister said it's her favorite now, maybe even more liked than her all time fav. pumpkin pie!  I did have to cook this pie for about an hour and a half.  Needless to say, a keeper for sure.

I don't know what kind of magical volume-expanding pie crust you used, but my 9-inch pie crusts DO NOT hold 6+ cups of liquid.
