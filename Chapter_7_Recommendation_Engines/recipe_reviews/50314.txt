This was a really good recipe. I lightened it up a bit.  I used skim mik and 2% cheese, and I omitted the water (since the skim milk is thin to begin with) and added salt and pepper to the milk mixture.  I also used talapia and fresh spinach.  I sauteed the spinach first a bit, but I don't think I will bother next time. It came out great! Thanks!

I made this recipe for my family and it was DE-lish. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, only because that's what I had on hand. It turned out great. I will definitely make this again. Also, it was very easy to make. The family really enjoyed it!

Great recipe.  I used halibut fillets instead of steaks and fresh spinach as is.  This would work well with cheaper fish also. I had twice as much cheese sauce than was required so saved till the next day for Tuna Mornay.  I will never make cheese sauce any other way - I'm so grateful to have learned this method. I cut the cooking time by at least half.

Excellent.  I've never made cheese sauce this way before but it turns out OK and is much quicker than the roux method.

I made this for my family tonight and they really didn't enjoy it.  I think the cheese to spinach/fish ratio was too much, it would have probably been better if I had used the sauce sparingly since it was really rich.

Outstanding! I made this tonight and it was wonderful. It was a great way to get the kids to eat spinach. Make sure to drain the spinach well before you line the pan, otherwise it will water everything down.

This was good. It was easy to make and everyone who ate it really liked it. Personally, I found it a little bland, but that's easy enough to fix with seasonings.

Had problems with the white sauce so went back to tried and true method. Once it was all together the whole family thought it was good.

My husband said this is his favorite fish dish!  Thanks for the great recipe ... I used a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen, but otherwise followed exactly.

I made this following the directions but I substituted a Mexican cheese blend because it was what I had on hand. I had a lump of gooey cheese that would not melt so had to throw it away and start over. (Cleaning the pan was no easy feat!).  Started from scratch again following directions but this time using 100% cheddar (I had some expensive sandwich slices). Same exact result. A gooey mass that even challenged the garbage disposal. How I salvaged this was to extract as much flavor as I could from the cheese and then threw it away. I added 2 slices of American cheese and the flour/water.  Finally a cheese sauce. It was tasty but a waste of time and ingredients. Please just make a white sauce with the milk and flour then add the cheese. I think this would work.

Very good, my family really loved it.  I did not have the Spinach, so I used salad greens, a mix of greens and spinach.  I covered the bottom of the dish, with a layer, and I would double or triple the amount of spinach (fresh) next time.  Probably put some on top of the fish before I put the sauce on.

Great dish!  Made as advertised and it turned out fantastic!  Very rich in flavor.  Next time we could use less Halibut and still have plenty of food.  Will make it again!

So easy to make and tastes like high end resturant quality 
Like others I used fresh spinach. Will increase spinach next time (personal like)   Added onions, other than that followed recipe as written. 
Thank you for the fabulous recipe !

Delicious! I also used tilapia and fresh spinach. My diet doesn't let me eat cheddar, so I used a little more parmesan and added some dijon mustard and some spices. Perfection!

This is excellent and easy as is.  I've made it a couple of times now, and prefer to use fresh spinach (I just pack as much in as I can fit) and I generally use Tilapia instead of Halibut.  My entire family enjoys it.

My husband agrees with the other raters who said why ruin good fish. I don't really care for fish, so i thought the cheese would make it better. . . turns out the fish just made the cheese taste worse. I will not make this again.

This recipe was super easy and it tasted really good. I flavored the halibut with garlic and a dash of fish seasoning.  The only thing I found odd about this recipe was the flour and water.  The ratio is really close and was a little too thick;  so I tossed that and made a flour/cornstarch mix like you do for gravy and whisked it in and it seemed better.  I also agree that using fresh spinach turned out nicely. But really delicious and all in all a great dish.

This is a recipe that is a definite remake! It was exceptionally good and the combination of the spinach and fish is very pleasing.
