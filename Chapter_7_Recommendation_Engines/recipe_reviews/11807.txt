This was a really great recipe, but I suggest only using 1 (28 oz) can, 7 yields so much that you could feed 20 people! But I use this sauce now for spaghetti and such too, thank you! It's very easy and excellent :)

good recipe.  I too, cut down the quantity as it made too much.
I adjusted the preparation of the pasta by draining it while it was still quite al dente and then putting it in a hot non-stick frying pan with the amount of sauce that I wanted. I heated it through for about a minute and the pasta took on more of the flavour of the sauce. (grandma's trick)

Super easy with wonderful results. Cooked it for my family and they loved it. I added some olives though, for a tangier taste. All in all, a good recipie. Thank You, Holly! :0)

Simple, wonderful.  It's amazing that this happens with so few ingredients!  The long simmer really is essential to concentrate the tomato flavors; I simmered mine for five hours (just because it was more convenient) and honestly, I'd recommend at least four.  After three, I thought the tomatoes were still a little sharp.  My two biggest concerns going in were the oil and the crushed red pepper; I was afraid there'd be too much oil and too little chili.  Wrong on both counts.  I made the full recipe and will be happy to freeze it to use for another three meals.  Thanks!

Very good and very simple. I used the advice of another of only using 1 - 28oz can instead of 7 and it worked out awesome.

I, for one, am glad to have left over sauce to freeze for another time.  This is an excellent and a very quick, tasty sauce, tweaked or not. Recipes are guidelines, not something written in stone.

Soooo good; I added butter, garlic, onion, celery, red pepper, zucchini. Then oregano, salt, black pepper and fresh basil; tomato and tomato paste. Then the pasta for 2 minutes and served with Parmesan cheese. Yummy

I didn't use the same proportions as it suggested because i am only making for one. but it came out fantastic! I added some vegetarian meatballs. (the meatless meatball kind) I would make this sauce again for more than one pasta recipe.

As other raters suggested, I pared down the ingredients considerably. We still had leftovers, but since there are only two mouths to feed in my house, I didn't want to go overboard. The recipe is wonderful and full of flavor. To add a little protein, I will occasionally put a can of drained black beans in the sauce a few minutes before it's done cooking.

I’m not a vegan, but this had a decent taste. The quantities of ingredients are off. Were they guessed at??? I reduced the sauce to serve 2, and then increased the pasta quantity to serve 4. It’s okay, but I would only try it again with Italian sausage or meatballs.

I cut this recipe in half because and it turned out to be really tasty. It was a bit too spicy for our 2 young kids so next time I would either greatly reduce or eliminate the red pepper flakes. Other than that, no complaints. Very filling hearty meal.

The difference between 1 can and 7 is huge.  Did you adjust the other ingredients accordingly
