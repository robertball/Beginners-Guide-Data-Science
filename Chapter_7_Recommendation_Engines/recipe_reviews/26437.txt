Contrary to what another reviewer stated, this is NOT a healthy soup.  way too much sodium, any recipe with buillion cubes is NOT healthy.

Quite good but needs a bit of adjustment. I followed the recipe exactly and for us it was a bit too salty and I didn't add any extra salt. Also it's not the prettiest soup. My husband and I enjoyed it though I just need to work out how to reduce the salt content without losing the flavour. Thanks

I made this recipe as part of a soup and salad supper (served with Italian Bread from a Bread Machine). The soup itself is tasty, but (as pointed out by another reviewer) it's not that pretty. Although I did cook it for the recommended time, I didn't add the broccoli until the last half hour. I added a handful of frozen peas and carrots that needed using. If I make this again, I would cook the chicken separately (or just use leftover chicken) and throw it in near the end. Cooking the chicken from a raw state is part of what makes it "not so pretty" - the length of cooking time is the other. This soup could do with a much shorter cooking time.  I did add additional boullion for a little more flavor. I also used frozen mixed peppers because I had them on hand.

Delicious!  I was concerned the spices would be strong and I am happy to report I was wrong. I love garlic so I added an extra clove.  This is  great recipe to use up whatever veggies you have in your fridge or freezer. I used red instead of green peppers and added green zucchini that I sliced into round slices and cut each into quarters.  I also has an open can of chicken broth that I used in conjunction with the water and bouillon cubes. Will definitely be making this again!

I made this one afternoon and loved it! Instead of the chicken cubes I used chicken broth and then half the amount of water, thanks for a good recipe.

I'm glad I chose to ignore the negative reviews and try this recipe.  It was great.  Very tasty and simple to make.  I added some extra garlic and mixed frozen veggies instead of just corn.  Perfect for a cold, snowy day!
