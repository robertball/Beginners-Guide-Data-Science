Doctor it up!  I've made this recipe for over a year and passed it along by request.  It's a definite 5 star, especially for your time invested.  However, you MUST add seasoning.  This recipe gives you the base.  I would rate it 2-3 stars without additions.  My suggestions...substitute 1/2 broth with Cream of Chicken soup.  Rinse your black beans well!  Add cumin and chili powder...don't be shy.  It gives your soup depth.  Add cilantro and garlic powder, if available.  Grab a rotiserie chicken from your grocery.  I wouldn't expect a 5 star recipe to have canned chicken, would you?  Serve with chunked avocados, cheese, a squeeze of lime and whatever else your heart desires.  Good luck!

Two words best describe this soup:  "EXCELLENT and EASY"!  Several reviewers mentioned that soup was "too salty".  I figured out why.  DO NOT use "condensed" chicken broth; I made this mistake myself.  Recipe calls for "chicken broth", which means plain broth (Swanson and some other companies make it in a 14 1/2 ounce can).  I tried making it again using the correct broth; however, I found it (like other reviewers) to be too watery -- tortilla chips at the bottom of the bowl helped to soak it up though.  I made recipe again; however, this time I used only one 14 1/2 ounce can of chicken broth -and- two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup (99% fat free by Campbells--I DID NOT add water).  The soup tasted SUPERB this way!  I discovered that there was no need to add tortilla chips at the bottom of the bowl because soup was a bit creamy, but without being heavy tasting.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese on the top with a dollop of sour cream, and it looked great, too!  (Note:  "Rotel Diced Tomatoes w/Green Chili Peppers" is offered in varying degrees of spicyness.  I used the "milder" version which gave soup a tiny kick without giving a case of indigestion afterwards.)

This recipe is so quick, easy, and cheap...just open the cans and boil. I only spent about $10.00 on ingredients.  My company thought it was really good.  After reading the other reviews, here's what I came up with which was perfect:  I only used one can of chicken broth (not condensed or it will be too salty), I added 2 cans of condensed cream of chicken soup so it wasn't too watery as other reviewers suggested, used a milder version of tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel tomatoes with lime/cilantro work well).  Be sure to rinse the beans and make sure to season with garlic powder, salt, peper, chili powder, and cumin otherwise there won't be much flavor. Many reviewers suggested adding cilantro which I will try next time. Top with sour cream, cheddar cheese and some tortilla chips and it is perfect.  You really can't go wrong with this one.

Ok, I don't exactly follow this recipe but it gave me some great ideas.  I've cooked variations several times now - the ingredients depend on what I have on hand.

Here's a sample of what I've put in at different times - Carrots, dark and white chicken breasts I've browned in butter, allowed to cool, and shredded, canned diced green chile, green chile enchilada sauce, rice, green onions, yellow onion, canned corn, can of kidney beans, minced fresh garlic or garlic powder, red chile powder, the list goes on and on.  

It's quick to prepare - but tastes best when I put it in the slow cooker and let the flavors really infuse for about 6 hours but one time I made it quickly with rice, chicken, green chiles, and canned corn - and sent it with my husband when he was visiting his sick mom.  GET THIS!  She can't stop raving about it!!  She brags about my cooking to everyone now!! This is a miracle recipe!  

Don't worry if you don't have all the ingredients or want to add other stuff - just use what you have and people will love it!!

I have made this recipe so many times and always with rave reviews, which is saying a lot from my picky husband!  As well as others, I use one can of cream of chicken soup in place of the 2 cans of chicken broth and I don't drain the can of diced tomatoes and chiles so it is still "soupy", I also use a can of mexican corn, drained or frozen corn if I have it on hand instead.  I drain and rinse the black beans because I prefer them that way.  While the soup is simmering I heat the oven to 350 and use a pizza wheel to cut flour tortillas in small, thin strips, bake them for a few minutes until crispy and top the soup with those and a dollop of sour cream. This recipe will remain in my kitchen for years to come and there are so many things you can do to change it up.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this recipe twice so far.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was so boring I forgot that I made it until my husband reminded me while I was cooking it the second time.  He wasnt too excited to see me cooking it again.  So the second time I made lots of adjustments and it was AWESOME!! I used a 48oz box of chicken broth, added 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup.  I used a rotesserie chicken chopped up. I stuck with the same on corn, rinsed my black beans, and added the drained can of rotel. I added 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 2 tsp of chili powder.  It was spicy.. but it seemed to calm down after I added a dollop of sour cream, handful of cheese and some crushed up blue tortilla chips to each bowl.  This recipe must be adjusted to make it awesome.

I used one can of chicken broth and one can of condensed cream of chicken (with 1 can of water). It gave the soup a nice thick consistency. You may want to blend the broth and cream of chicken before adding the other ingredients. The soup's flavor was great, especially the next day. The undrained black beans contributed an unattractive greyish color but I personally love black beans and appreciated them here, as well as the corn (which I don't usually like in recipes). They both added a nice texture. Would have added cumin, etc. but my can of tomatoes + chiles happened to have plenty of seasoning already in it.

I'm glad I gave this recipe a shot. I changed it a little by cutting up a chicken breast in place of the chunk chicken, replacing one of the cans of chicken broth with cream of chicken soup, and adding 1 tsp. cumin. I also drained the beans and corn first to keep it from getting too watery. The result was surprisingly flavorful and filling. The best part was that I didn't need to make a trip to the store for the ingredients, and it took less than 20 minutes. My wife and I have added this to our list of favorites!

I've been using this recipe for about a year now and all my friends and relatives have started using this recipe too.  This soup is great when you're sick because its easy to make and clears you right up.  I use the Carribean-style black beans w/ lime and peppers, and Rotel Mild tomatoes with lime and cilantro.  These two cans make a huge difference.  Then I top with shredded cheese, sliced olives, chips, and cubed avacado. YUM! Thank you Terryn for a family staple in our house!

I have been making this for months, and I can't believe I'm just writing the review.  I use chicken sauteed in olive oil and onion and garlic or leftover chicken/turkey--I haven't actually used canned chicken yet.  Sometimes I add a pinch each of chili powder and cumin.  I garnish with sour cream (a must), avocado, fresh cilantro, a little lime juice,and the crumbly left-overs in the gigantic Costco bag of tortilla chips DH MUST buy every time.  I don't drain the cans.  My parents and sisters wre soooo impressed when I threw this together in minutes using leftover chicken while visiting for Easter.  MUST TRY!

4 Stars as written but 5 Stars with minor changes:  I used a rotissery chicken, the entire can of Rotel Diced Tomatoes with Lime & Cilantro, drained and rinsed black beans & a can of Cream of Chicken soup.  I also added a tsp of Emmeril's Essence.  The soup had body, flavor and a very nice "heat" factor.  Ladle over chips, top with cheese & sour cream and you'll have a killer one-dish meal on your hands that was super easy to prepare!  Yummo!

I love this.  It is SO easy on those busy days.
This year, for Christmas, I made boxes up for friends with all 6 cans and a note:  "Busy Day Blessing" with the recipe.  Thanks for the creative Christmas gift idea for all my busy friends!

Followed other tips and did 1 can broth, 1 can cream of chicken, turned out much richer and heartier this way.  Use fresh chicken(buy a pre-cooked rotisserie and shredding it taste so much better, fresher and gives more of a homemade taste.  And rinse the beans before adding or else it will turn the broth a dark, unappealing color.  Add fresh, chopped cilantro right before serving with some toasted tortilla strip (or can use crushed tortilla chips in a pinch).  I also used frozen corn the 3rd time and was better!  Good base, and with a few additions, turns out restaurant style soup.

Extremely easy and very tasty.  Everyone liked this soup.  My husband prefers thicker soup, so I followed the advice of other raters reviewers and used 1 can chicken broth and 1 can of cream soup (I used fiesta nacho cheese cream soup instead of chicken - yummy!).  I plan to try it with 2 cans of broth as well.

I have been using this recipe for a few years and have not said "THANK YOU!!!"   Like others, I have made some minor changes:  I use a store-bought rotisserie chicken, 1 can reduced fat cream of chicken and one can broth, 1/2 bag frozen corn, 1 can kidney beans and 1 can  black beans (well rinsed and boiled to get rid of the xs gas), chili ready or jalapeno tomatoes with juice,  1 can of green chiles, some white onions, 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and your choice of toppings...healthy as you make it...THANKS TERRYN for a truly great, easy, healthy, classic recipe!

This recipe is a great base to work with -- I don't think you can mess it up!  

Go with fresh chicken breast if you can and boil it in the broth as the first step.  I have also used store bought rotisserie chicken, even left over turkey.  You can also use bouillon when no broth on hand.  

My tips: 
1. Add any fresh veggies you have on hand such as carrots, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms and it will taste completely homemade. 
2. Any canned beans work but rinse them off first.
3.  To thicken the soup & give a nice flavor, put about 3 corn tortillas or a couple of hand fulls of corn chips in the food processor, then add the corn "flour" to the soup and simmer a few minutes..it will add a nice complexity and taste even BETTER the next day.

Add or leave out what you want to make this recipe low fat, low carb, vegetarian...it would even be great with left over seafood...mmm!  (To be fair, I must note that I'm prejudiced against can chicken.)

this is a great, easy soup but it needed a bit of dressing-up!  i followed others' suggestions and added a can of cream of chicken soup (in lieu of one can of broth), some cumin, garlic, Adobo seasoning, and black pepper.  Served it with shredded cheese, and warm, homemade cornbread---fantastic!!

Soooo good and easy!  I followed some of the other reviewers recommendations and with those modifications, it was great.  I used one can stock and one can cream of chicken soup.  Make sure the black beans are WELL rinsed.  I also used rotisserie chicken from the grocery store instead of the canned chicken.  I also added cumin, red pepper, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  Right before serving, I added some chopped cilantro.  Served with shredded cheese, tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream.  You really can't go wrong!

I'm nursing a girls night out "head trauma" today (those raspberry margaritas get me EVERY single time), so I was looking for something EASY.  I used perdue shortcuts southwest seasoned chicken pieces vs. the canned chicken, and added 2 tbsp. of chopped FRESH cilantro (ya can't beat it) and a minced clove of garlic.  It was soooo tasty.  I didn't have any diced tomatoes with green chiles, just "Rold Gold Mexican fiesta w/ cilantro & lime juice" (which I didn't drain when I added it) so I added a minced jalapeno pepper as it was still simmering (after I had eaten) and I'm looking forward to the spiced up version tomorrow.  Top it with shredded Montery Jack & crushed tortilla chips, mmmmmm- Thanks Terryn, I loved it!

I make a couple modifications--- substitute 1 of the cans of broth with cream of chicken, add a 2nd 10oz can of chunk chicken, substitute tomatos with a 16oz jar of medium salsa, and add half a packet of taco seasoning. Everyone who tastes this loves it and wants the recipe  :)

I've been making this recipe for awhile now and never changed a thing.. simply because it is soooo quick, easy and tasty the way it is. I admit, I would prefer it with fresh chicken and I will do that if we ever have any left over! But as far as the rest of the recipe, I kept it the way it was.. I use Rotel tomatoes w/ green chilies so I monitor the heat and I don't rinse or drain any of the cans. I think the juice from the black beans and corn adds to the flavor. The ingredients are things I buy and just keep on hand. When we feel the urge for this soup, there's no running to the store or waiting all day for the flavors to marry. I sometimes garnish the soup with avocados and sour cream and serve with tortilla chips/strips.  What's not to love about this?  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  BTW, we all know by reading the ingredients that this isn't supposed to be worthy of the Food Network, so don't even try to judge it in that category.  But if you want something tasty and quick.. this is for you.  TRY IT THE WAY IT READS FIRST.. I don't find the need to add the cream of chicken soup; I think it would alter the taste far too much.

Used suggestions found in other reviews: substituted 2 cans (undiluted) Cream of Chicken soup for one of the cans of broth; Rotel brand "Mexican Festival" diced tomatoes (with lime juice & cilantro); S&W brand "Caribbean" Black Beans (with peppers, chilis, onion & lime juice; and hand-shredded grocery store roasted chicken.  Garnished with sour cream, cubed avocado and chopped fresh cilantro.
It was "Oh My God!" good.  My 10 yr-old daughter had two bowls after having dinner at a friend's house (and then again for breakfast this morning!).  Her picky, picky, picky, 13 yr-old sister (who doesn't tolerate spices well) even had seconds - despite being sick with a fever!  
Astonishingly quick and easy.  I already bought supplies for two more batches to keep on hand.  I'm going to go reheat the rest of the leftovers right now, these are my kind of flavors!

This was a great recipe! Perfect! To make it truly authentic I fried corn tortilla strips in oil, and sprinkled with garlic and onion salt. Then I crumbled those at the bottom of the soup, and topped with shredded cheddar, soup and then a slice of lime. I used cream of chieck and then one can regular diced tomatoes and one with green chilies to kick it up a notch. Yummy, easy!!!

This is, hands down, one of our favorite, go-to recipes. We frequently use a rotisserie chicken and its broth instead of canned chicken.  As it simmers, we'll add Southwestern Chipotle seasoning.  The kids know when they come over and visit, we always have a big dutch kettle full of soup on the stove or in the refrigerator.  We've started using raw spinach in the bottom of the bowl, then ladling soup over the spinach.  It's really tasty and healthy. We serve this soup ALL of the time, especially during the cooler months.

Terrific base recipe... don't hold back if you are familiar with great base recipes...This one is a perfect diving board for very tasty soups.  I added a few other kinds of beans like a can of cannelli, and red kidney...and  a small amount of chili powder.  I also added about a tbs of sugar, this really brings out the flavor of the food!!!

My husband and I loved this soup, and he claimed it to be the best tortilla soup he's ever had! I used 4 chicken tenders, flavored them with some Famous Dave's seasoning for a little extra kick, baked and then shredded them. I followed the advise of others and used one can of chicken broth (not condensed) and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. I rinsed and drained the black beans well to avoid a gray looking soup. I also used the recommended Rotel tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro. I made my own tortilla strips to place on top. We still can't get over how good this was and I will be making it again soon!

This was super delicious, after i added some things. i kinda doubled the recipe. i used 1 can chicken broth to 3 cans cream of chicken soup, 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into chunks, 2 cans of corn, drained, 1 can of rotel w/ green chiles (Hot version) also drained,  i didnt have black beans so i used 1 can of Ranch Style Beans Drained, and rinsed, and I put in one can of Campbells Fiesta Nacho cheese, and one can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese. Added Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, Chili Powder, and Cumin, all to taste. (about 2 -3 tsp of each for me). I let it cook for 8 hours on low in the crock pot and all of the flavors blended amazingly. such an AMAZING recipe:) my father-in-law claims its the best bowl of soup he's ever ate. Thanks so much for sharing, i hope this review comes in useful.

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical until I tried it.  Even though it came from cans, it was delicious.  I made it for a PTA/Teacher dinner and 5 people asked me for the recipe.  P.S. - I added 3/4 tsp. of cumin as was suggested by another reviewer.

Need to put some spice in the soup.  As the recipe is, the soup was boring and hollow.  Good base for a soup though.

This was a very good recipe, my boyfriend and I made it together last night! We read other peoples reviews and decided to use a jar of restaurant style salsa and frozen corn instead of canned tomatoes and peppers and canned corn. It turned out wonderfully! It's very good but still not the best recipe I've ever tasted, I think next time I'm going to cook the chicken with red, yellow, and green bell peppers and throw that in for more flavor.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I'm so happy I read the reviews before I made it cause the original recipe did need a little tweaking.  Instead of using 2 cans of chicken broth, I used only one can and then a can of Cream of Chicken (along with only half a can of water). Make sure you drain and wash the black beans! The beans will make the soup watery and add an unattractive black color.  Also, I would definitely recommend adding cilantro!  It gives it that added bit of flavor.  You'll also need to add some salt, pepper, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper (adds a little heat).  I also added brown rice because the Mexican restaurant near my house makes it that way.  Cook the rice a little more than halfway then add to the soup.  The rice soaks up the broth and flavors nicely and adds good body to the soup!

I took every one else's advice, adding 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup, and about a teaspoon each of: cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper.  Was delicious!

I made this last night-simple & quick. I used fresh chicken tenders sauteed with onion & garlic & frozen corn instead of canned. I topped with Mexican cheese mixture, cilantro & sour cream. I served it with buttered corn tortillas rather than chips. I was going to add some avacado but the price was outrageous-it would be good though!
Thanks Terryn

Very easy, tastes good!  I made the recipe as written with the following additions! 1 tsp. cumin, one clove minced garlic, 1/8 tsp. chili powder, dry cilantro (fresh would be better, but didn't have it on hand).  I also cooked it in a slow cooker on low for 6 hours to allow all the flavors to blend!  And, I topped it with Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar since this is what the restaurants usually do.  Great easy recipe!!

This was too easy and very tasty!  I substituted 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup for 1 of the cans of broth.  I also added 1/4 tsp of ground cumin and 2 tblsp of chopped cilantro.  It was awesome!  I used the Ro-Tel tomatoes also, and that gave it a nice kick.  Even my 4 year old loved it!  Great for time-pressed or cold nights.

This recipe is so quick and easy. It's a very good basic recipe, but I think the best part is that you can add ingredients according to personal preference and make it even better. I've used leftover turkey, added some chili powder and cumin, stirred in some queso dip, used a variety of beans...my family always likes it.

I used stewed tomatoes and two small canned jalapenos instead of the tomatoes w/chilis and fresh chicken instead of canned.  I still felt that it needed something though, so I added some dried minced onions and a big teaspoon full of minced garlic.  I would definitely make this again after my minor tweaking.  It was super quick and easy!

QUICK, EASY, DELICIOUS!!! I've made it for years and my kiddos still ask for it.  I do have a few additional ingredients.  1 can Cream Style Corn, 1 chopped onion and 2-3-4 chopped garlic cloves (we love the garlic in it).  Usually I boil a package of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and shred them.  I like that better than canned chicken and it leaves me the broth to thin with.  What's really nice about this is you can make a thick hearty stew like soup, or a thinner soup.  Either way its delicious!!!

Oh my goodness this was SO good on this cold night!  I changed it only a little based on some reviews I read here...this is what I did:  First I combined the 2 cans of chicken broth with 1 can of cream of chicken soup - perfect consistency!  Rinsed the black beans, drained the corn and tomatoes and mixed those 3 together with some seasonings (fresh ground black pepper, garlic and cumin), then I added this mixture to the soup.  For the chicken I used about 1/2 a rotisserie chicken from the store (not a big fan of can chicken either) - pulled it apart into bite size pieces and added it to the soup.  Heated it through and dinner was done!  I served it over tortilla chips and topped with white cheese (shredded Queso Quesadilla cheese) and a small dollop of sour cream.  YUM!

Delicious recipe.  I did as some others and added a few more things.  I actually tripled the recipe for a super bowl party, and in addition to the extra broth, added 3 cans of 98% free cream of chicken soup.  One of the three cans of rotel was the cilantro and lime version.  I added a can of chunk tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce mostly to make it the color I was looking for.  Also added some taco seasoning and a few shots of hot sauce.  I made homemade tortilla strips as well.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Better than the soup I get at my favorite Mexican restaurant.

Reduce chicken broth to 1 (14.5 oz) can.  Add 1 can Cream of Chicken soup (reduced fat or fat free).
Drain tomoatoes and black beans (the color is much better if you do this and there is already plenty of liquid).  Use 1 package of Perdue Shortcuts Southwest seasoned chicken cut into bite size pieces.  Add 1 tsp. ground Cumin.  This is wonderful for a last minute dinner.

This was SO easy and SO good, tasted like it was from a restaurant! I added some diced avocado and shredded pepper jack cheese as garnish, yum! I also spiced it up just a little with cayenne pepper and a little bit of cumin. This is a keeper, my hubby couldn't believe I made it from "scratch" (of course I threw the cans away first!).

Made this soup tonight with better ingredients and it was delicious!!

My husband gave it 5 stars!  I used two large boneless chicken breast that I grilled on the stove to charr them. Then threw everything in the crock pot. Also used about a half of a dry package of Fahita  seasoning and that really kicked up the flavor. Used one 32oz carton of Swanson chicken broth. Did NOT add cream of chicken soup. Also added half an onion chopped, a crushed garlic clove, a shake or two of cumin, a can of mexi corn, black beans drained and rinsed, some chopped jalapeno and Roltel with lime and cilantro. Cooked 3 hours on high and then shredded the chicken.
Just wish I had made a double batch. Sooo good!! 
Toppings, tortilla chips, sour cream, shredded mexi cheese and avacado slices. YUM YUM

Made this but I was the only one in the fam that liked it.  Doesn't taste any better or worse than the canned Progresso chicken tortilla soup.  Don't kid yourselves they both taste like they came from a can but it doesn't bother me.  OK recipe, needs a LOT of additional spice.

Tried this recipe tonight. I used canned fiesta corn which I think was a good decision. Added the cream of chicken soup for half the broth and used a rotisserie chicken also spiced it up as others suggested. It was a hit in my house. The recipe as written only gets 3 out of 5 stars from me. I will be making it again for sure.

This tortilla soup recipe is much better if you add some minced white onion, minced garlic, chopped cilantro. Season the soup with chili powder, some garlic salt and a little seasoned salt to taste. You can thicken the soup by adding in a 1/4 cup cold water with a tablespoon wondra. Once it begins to boil remove the following ingredients from the pan and place into a separate frying pan with a little canola oil: cooked shredded chicken, onion, garlic, chopped cilantro, corn, black beans saute them together for about 5 minutes in medium heat in a little canola oil, sprinkle them with chili powder and garlic salt to add more flavor and color. Then when you are serving the soup into individual bowls, spoon in the broth first & then your sauted chicken, corn, black beans, onions, and cilantro on top. You will find this makes the soup amazing, especially if you add some crunchy corn tortilla strips, shredded mexican cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. Enjoy!

I haven't made this version but it's similar to a recipe that my WW leader gave us years ago.  Hers didn't have chicken (although I've added it myself on several occasions) and instead of black beans, she added a can of FF refried beans (the Zesty Salsa kind so it adds a little kick).  The refried beans make it thicker.  I'm sure they are both great and super healthy!!

Good, BUT . . . I agree with practically all the other reviewers: substitute one can of Cream of Chicken soup for one of the cans of (reduced-sodium) chicken broth. Also its much better if you boil & dice 2 chicken breasts; but if you're really in a time pinch, use TWO cans of chicken chunks.  I prefer TWO cans of diced tomatoes with zesty green chiles (UNdrained) and DON'T FORGET to rinse & drain the black beans!  I prefer to use a bag of frozen corn, rather than canned corn. And lastly, Spice it up, baby!  Add at least a teaspoon of cumin & a  tablespoon of chili powder and top it with some chopped fresh cilantro, sour cream & grated cheese!  Yum, than Terryn for a good starter-base recipe!

Too salty prepared as written. However, it is very easy to make changes that your blood pressure will appreciate. Cook chicken breast or thighs in water which you will use as a broth replacement. Use frozen corn. Use canned black or pinto beans, drained and rinsed well. Add two chopped Roma tomatoes and a few teaspoons of finely chopped poblano or anaheim green chile. The only sodium in this modified recipe will come from the canned beans and it will be reduced by about 50% by rinsing well. I add some sodium free taco seasoning that I buy from a bulk foods supplier. And a little fresh minced garlic and a wedge of lime will finish this nicely. It is very flavorful using these fresh ingredients. Happy heart health!

This is very tasty as is, I made it as written the first time.  This time, as per suggestions, I made it in the slow cooker with two chicken breasts. (1 hour on high, 2 on low, removed and shredded chicken then returned it and cooked for 2 hours more on low. Note to self: Added a tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of chili powder and a can of low sodium cream of chicken as per other suggestions and 2 Tbsp of goya cilantro base, which all together made it absolutely amazing!!  Be sure to use low sodium broth, 2 cans is equal to most of a carton.  Fat free sour cream works well with this.

Great idea! My version is slightly "doctored up" but didn't change things appreciably. I didn't have the tomatoes w/chilis, so I subbed in tomato salsa. Worked fine! Also I took others' suggestions and added a can of cream of chicken soup. I ladled the soup over brown rice - yum!!! Thanks for a great recipe that can be altered with the same tasty results!

I followed the advice of others and used the following: 1 can Rotel tomatoes with Lime & Cilantro, 1 can yellow corn, 1 can chicken broth, 2 cans condensed cream of chicken soup, 1 can (drained and rinsed) black beans, and 1 12.5 oz can chunk chicken.  Because I was short on time, I just threw it all in the crock pot and let it go.  I didn't add anything else to it.  We served it with toasted tortilla strips, cheddar cheese and a dollup of sour cream, as recommended by SPRING1ONU.  It was a hit with our family of 6.  I wish I had doubled it, because some wanted seconds, and it was all gone.  Also, if I have more time, I might use a rotisserie chicken the next time, but this recipe fit the bill perfectly for us, especially on a chilly, rainy evening.

Wow!  This soup is awesome with some added spices.  I have made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe and it definitely needed spice and was too watery.  Big time.  I made it a second time and it came out perfect with these changes.  Rinse the black beans well, one can cream of chicken soup, two cans swansons broth,  one can of rotel with green chiles.  I did not drain the can and it was spicy.  If you don't want the spice, definitely drain it.  I also added about 1T cummin and 1T chili powder.  I kid you not, the best tortilla soup I have ever had, and my family agrees.  Every single one of them.  My only request from my family is to double it!

I've been making this recipe for years,  however just recently perfected it.  I wanted to share it - I use rotiserrie chicken (the whole chicken), add 3 T lemon juice and about 3 T taco seasoning (like from an envelope or bulk in a bottle).  Generic black beans work but what is really good are the Kuner's different varieties of black beans.  Oh so good.

I'm stuck in my home due to mother nature and didn't have much to work with this evening.  I did have everything in my pantry for this soup except the canned chicken.  Sooo, I diced up some chicken tenders and sauteed them with red bell pepper.  After I drained the veggies, I added them to the pot along with some onion powder, garlic powder and salt.  Even after some seasonings..it still tasted like it was missing something.  I sprinkled some Romano cheese on top of my serving..(big mistake).  It made my bowl stink!!  Even hubby, who was sitting in the living room asked me "What's that smell"?   Eventually, after the stinky cheese melted, the soup tasted a little better.  Might make this again when my pantry is running on empty.

This was very good. I didn't have canned chicken so instead I put 3 frozen chicken breasts in a pot covered them with 6 cups water and let them cook. When they were done I took them out to cool and added all the rest of the ingredients (boullion instead of broth since I had some nice flavored water in the pot already), plus cumin, chili powder and I also cooked up some onion and garlic as had been suggested. I also added a can of kidney beans as well as the black beans. When the chicken was cooled my son and I shredded it together and put it into the pot. Just before I served the soup I cut a tortilla into 1/2 inch strips with a pizza cutter and put them in a pan with oil and cooked them quickly, took them out onto a paper towel and sprinkled them with garlic/herb seasoning. After I dished the soup into a bowl I took a few cooked tortilla strips and stood them up in the bowl of soup, leaning on each other (looked kind of like a tee-pee). Made for a nice presentation and they were yummy. I'm not much of a soup person (my husband is) but I must say that this was pretty tasty and I'll definitely make it again. Who'd have thought that homemade soup could be so easy?!?

OH YUMMMMMMM!!!!! Just left the dinner table.  This is one of the best soups I have ever eaten!!!!!  I used fresh chicken and added cilantro, cumin and a little cayenne pepper.  Also I roasted the can of corn in a smoking hot cast iron pan then added it to the soup.  It was so good that my 12 year old daughter wants to make it for her home-ec class. We served it with the tortilla chips, sour cream, black olives and mexican cheese blend and a side salad. 
Thanks Terryn  :)

This has got to be the easiest recipe on this site. It will only take you 15 minutes if you spend the first 10 looking for your can opener! I added some garlic powder, cumin, and the juice of one lime, and topped with shredded cheddar, crushed tortilla chips, and sour cream. So easy, so good, and so fast!

I have made this soup a number of times and my family and friends all LOVE it.  The only changes I made were instead of 2 can of chicken broth I used 1 can of broth and one can of cream of chicken soup (per recipe).  Since I was making a triple recipe, I did not have enough black beans, so I substituted a can of pinto beans.  Everyone loved the soup.  In fact it was so good, I brought some to work for my boss, who loves soup.  He asked me for the recipe!

This recipe has tremendous flavor.  I made a few modifications, so it takes more than 5 min prep time.  I used 32 oz of organic reduced sodium chicken broth + 1 can organic cream of chicken soup (both are gluten free), didn't drain my canned tomatoes and added 1 small can of diced chile peppers as my canned tomatoes were plain.  I seasoned with roasted garlic salt, black pepper, roasted cumin and cayenne to taste.  YUM!

Definitely good with the suggestions the others have said: cream of chicken soup, chili powder, cumin, garlic/garlic powder, fresh cilantro. Chopping some onions and peppers make it tasty also. If you are using plain diced tomatoes (instead of the ones with them already in it like Rotel), definitely throw in a can of chopped green chilies for extra flavor.

My whole family of seven loved this, from my 2 year old to my sixteen and year old, as well as my husband and I!  I changed it up a bit after I changed the serving size to 12.  I used two can of Basil and Garlic stewed tomatoes and one can of Rotel.  Then, added three cans of black beans, instead of two, and used 8 cups of broth, instead of four.   Garlic salt, minced onion and some Italian seasoning were also added.  
Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Loved this recipe...so easy!!  After reading reviews, I substitued 1 can of chicken broth with one can cream of chicken soup.  I also rinsed and drained the black beans before adding.  I also added about a clove of minced garlic.  It was delicious!!  I agree with previous reviewers idea to put ingredients in a basket as a gift..Great for new parents!

Great for making a meal for someone! Used precooked southwest chicken and subbed a can of chicken broth for cream of chicken. Also added some cumin and other spices people suggested. Great easy slow cooker recipe. Thanks!

Want to know what this soup is missing? At the last 5 minutes of warming up this soup, add one corn tortilla broken up into pieces, and continue simmering soup until hot. The corn tortilla will break up and give the soup an AUTHENTIC tortilla soup flavor. All the other ingredients are great (substitute the canned chicken for freshly poached and shredded chicken when you feel like cooking), plus whatever other stuff you like. A good foundation recipe for tortilla soup!

Yum! I used frozen Tyson diced chicken breast, frozen corn (a little too much. Oops!), rinsed the beans, added some cilantro, cumin, hot sauce, red and black pepper.  I used 1 can of chicken broth and one can of cream of chicken soup.  Served w/ tortilla chips and salsa. :)

I love it! I've used this recipe for many years now for those 'traffic was a nightmare and I don't want to cook and I'm starving as is everyone else getting home from work nights .... variations are endless, I can use anything and everything,and the base is delicious on its own. It's ready in record time What more could anyone ask for!?numerous ways to keep salt/fat down and numerous ways to make it rich for those special occasions.  This recipe is a win/win!! :)

I made this as a crockpot meal, and just left it on "low" for about 5 hours - everything thought it tasted great! Make sure and add plenty of seasoning, because it's extremely bland by itself - I added garlic salt, pepper, oregano and chili powder to mine!

This was great (and cheap, which is my favorite part). I cut up raw chicken tenderloins, put them in a crockpot, poured two tablespoons of melted butter over it, seasoned with cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder, set the crockpot on low and let it cook for about 5 and a half hours. Took the lid off, broke up the chicken pieces and poured the rest of the ingredients in, only I used a can of cream of chicken soup in place of one of the broth cans, and I rinsed the beans and corn together in a strainer. I also added more of the spices mentioned above. I used tortilla strips on top (that you can buy on the salad dressing aisle). Wonderful!

This is a super quick soup. As written it is a little bland but I add a little cumin and a few other spices, whatever sounds good to me that day, to help liven it up a bit. I usually buy a rotisserie chicken and use that instead of canned chicken. I love making this to have on hand for my weekly lunches along with a salad. I will make a batch and freeze the leftovers.

I just tried this recipe and it was great. I used some rotisserie chicken I had and used the hot rotel tomatoes and it was very tasty. I did not drain the tomatoes, the juice added the perfect amount of spice for my taste.

I've been making this for several years now. I cook seasoned chicken breasts in the broth and use 1 can cr of chicken soup. Rinse the black beans for a clearer soup. I also add Birdseye southwestern rice & use frozen super sweet corn. Today I actually made it in the oven since we're having a blizzard & I wanted the oven on.Just let it simmer at 250 degrees. I add extra ingredients all the time to make a HUGE batch of this soup. Everyone always loves it. Rotel Cilantro & Lime tomatoes work good in this recipes and you can make it as hot or mild as you like. I never drain the tomatoes. Definitely a recipe I use time after time. Have fun with it & add whatever you want!

This is a good basic recipe, but the great thing about this is that you can add any ingredients and seasonings you want. I'm a huge soup fan and make it quite often. I rarely follow a recipe.  To me how the chicken is seasoned is important, if you don't have a Rotisserie chicken, I'd cook in a skillet, in a little oil, with garlic/onion powder, then make sure it has a nice browned coloring. 
I add cumin, garlic powder, pepper, chili powder, a touch of cayenne or red pepper flakes if making for adults only. Try it with white beans - you will love it! I don't drain them, then they add to the thickness. I add a few tortilla strips to the soup itself at the very end, then have some out for people to add themselves. Top w/Monterey Jack cheese, a little sour cream, fresh avocado and it's a great meal!    Just taste as you're cooking and add what is needed.

Maybe it was the fact that I knew everything came from a can, or maybe it was that I added a can of cream of chicken soup, but I just wasn't thrilled with this soup.  Didn't like the cream soup suggestion- made it taste like that soup from a bag you sometimes get in a restaurant.  The best chicken tortilla soup is the Slow Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup from this website.  Just as easy when you put the uncooked chicken breasts in the slow cooker and shred later (just takes longer to cook)and tastes divine!!

This recipe uses great ingredients and is easy to make! Only problem I had is that I thought it used too much broth. Next time I will cut broth in half (or maybe more) and use 1 can tomato soup and fill in with 1 or 2 cups tomato juice depending on consistency.

My son gave this 5 stars and that doesn't happen very often.  This recipe is so simple and delicious, I will be making this again and again, but will use cooked cubed chicken breast.  So glad you shared this Terryn.

This recipe was not only easy, it was delicious!  I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of chicken broth to make it thicker and more flavorful (next time I may try using 2 cans of cream of chicken for added texture and flavor).  I also drained the corn, beans, tomatoes and chicken so the soup was not so watery and I added sliced red bell pepper.  I topped it off with a 3-cheese Mexican Blend, crushed Doritos, sliced olives and sour cream.  I will definitley make again!

This recipe is excellent and SO easy!  You can't go wrong with this!
I live in a region where Tex-Mex food is on every corner, and this satisfies my discriminating taste buds.
Here's are some serving ideas:
You MUST serve this with tortilla chips and shredded cheese- this is not an option!
It's good also with: avocado, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, bell peppers, garlic, cumin, cayenne, lime wedges ... the possibilities are endless!

Another thing I did to make sure I had enough food for everyone was to add a can of plain tomato sauce.

Okay I will admit that I was skeptical before I made this.  I wanted to make soup for supper and I saw the recipe.  I read all the reviews and was impressed, so I thought I would give it a try.  I did use chicken breast, which I seasoned.  Even when it was cooking I was sure that my family would not enjoy.  I couldn't of been more wrong.  My husband and daughter and I loved it. I felt bad that my son wasn't home for dinner he really missed out. I would of liked it with a little more kick and my husband agreed.  My daughter thought it was perfect the way it was.  I have already passed it along to my co-workers. Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this recipe as stated, more or less. I used low sodium chicken broth and added a dash of cumin.  I served it with fried tortilla chips, sliced avocados and fresh cilantro on top.  It was terrific!  My husband loved it!  So quick and easy.  Next time, I will experiment with grilled chicken, just for kicks.

This was very tasty and very easy.  I used fresh boneless chicken breast instead of canned and just sauted it with 1T of olive oil and a little garlic.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was delicious!  Family loved it.

The first day I would have given it 4 stars BUT by the 2-3 day, because we were taking it for lunches, the flavours had really melded together.  I couldn't find regular broth in cans so I just followed another reviewer and used a tetra pack of chicken broth, a deli roast chicken instead of canned and added the oregano, cumin and chili powder as suggested and through it all in my slow cooker with a bit of lime juice. I've just made my shopping list to get the ingredients to make it again.  Thank you Terryn for submitting a wonderful recipe that can be adapted so easily.

I loved this recipe! I did make adjustments as suggested in other reviews. I used a can of plain Swanson's chicken broth (not condensed) and one can of Cream of Chicken soup. I also added the Ro-tel that had lime and cilantro instead of the type that uses green chilies. I didn't have chicken on-hand and am a bit creeped out by canned chicken, so I substituted with a can of chickpeas. I drained and rinsed both the black beans and chickpeas. I added whole kernel corn, undrained, as suggested. I then added a bunch of cumin, garlic pepper, garlic powder -- basically, I just threw spices in. It really added a depth to the soup. Next time, I'll probably add some fresh onion. The possibilities are endless and it's really great to make a tasty meal that's on a budget and can be taken for lunches to the office for several days in a row.

I make this recipe every winter.  I first started making it from a Jenny-O recipe that used ground turkey (my favorite way.  It's fabulous.  I don't know why but this combination really tastes like everything was made from scratch. Instead of canned tomatoes, I use a jar of salsa for more depth of flavor. Topped with chips, cheese and avocado. Yum!

This was really good!  Like some other users, I made a few slight changes.  I sauteed off a medium onion and a tablespoon of garlic.  I cooked about 1 and 1/4 lb of thin sliced chicken breast in the oven, instead of canned.  I used about 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth, and I used chipotle seasoned tomatoes.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of cumin and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  Everyone loved it, I'll definitely make this again!  The whole shebang took about an hour.  Oh, and I also made some white rice on the side to add in!!  I plan on using leftover turkey the next time I make it....yum!

I make this often and have received many compliments.  On the first try I followed the recipe; it was too bland but easily adjusted with 1 tsp cumin and a bit more simmering. I love this soup because it is quick and easy with ingredients I always have on hand. I always add 1 tsp cumin and serve with shredded cheese and cilantro on top. I have also substituted frozen S&W Southwest Blend for the canned beans and canned corn; this mix contains some onion, pepper and chiles which provide more flavor.

This wasn't bad.... it was exceptionally easy to do! I added some cumin and spices to it to give it more flavor, but not much because I can't do spice. It seemed very watery and could have used some more stuff, but overall, I got the thumbs up from my family. Still wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad at all!

The beauty of this recipe is that you can put it together in five minutes or less, if you have a good can-opener!  However, my family won't eat it unless I freshen it up a bit.  You can do this while the bulk of the ingredients are already in the pot on the stove.  It takes very litte time to strip an ear or two of corn - and fresh does taste better than canned.  If you have some left-over chicken roasted or baked, or even poached, it will most certainly taste better than canned.  If you happen to have frozen your very own chicken stock or broth and are generous enought to use it, you'll be in gourmet territory.  Just substitute any or all of these fresh elements for the canned ones while the pot is already simmering.  If there's time, you could even flash-fry a cut-up skinless, boneless chicken breast and dump it in.  Whether or not you have made thse "improvements", do add some garlic squeezed in your garlic press, some lemon or lime juice if you have either of these fruits lying around (don't bother with the b ottled kind), and chop a handful of parsley or cilantro and /or scallions if available.  Spice it up with fresh chilis or a pinch or two of cayenne pepper if your crowd likes it. Now - you've got a soup no one could sneeze at, and you got there easily, knowing that you could do it all with cans if you wanted to!Thanks to Terryn for helping me con myself into cooking when I was really too tired!!

We loved the soup - I added chili powder, drained and rinsed the black beans and did not drain the diced tomatoes - also instead of 2 cans of broth, I used 1 can and 1 can cream of chicken soup. IT was delicious - update for future - added cayenne, Chili beans, pepper, 2 cans of chicken and rice soup(drained 1) and diced chilies YUM ohhh YUM !!!

I used the suggestions of others and it turned out amazing! I used 1 can chicken broth, 1 can cream of chicken soup and then added in a few dashes of garlic powder, chili powder, cumin and added in some chives. I served it with cheese and crumbled tortilla chips! My husband loved it!!!!! Will definitely make it again.

5 stars with all the additions others have suggested.  What I did (which worked out great) is: 2 cans chix broth, 1 can of cream of chix, 1 can black beans, 1 bag frozen corn, deli chicken cut up, 1/2 jar chipolte salsa, and rotel tomatoes can (not whole can as the kids aren't tomato fans).  Seasoned with chili powder and taco seasoning.

Amazing recipe!  With a few tweaks, the soup tasted just like the expensive version they make at a local restaurant!  I omitted the chile peppers, rinsed the black beans in a colander with cold water, and like other reviewers said, I added two regular cans of condensed cream of chicken soup.  The soup seemed bland, so I simply added a packet of taco seasoning mix!  It came out beautifully.  Try it!  I topped this with shredded cheddar and tortilla chips.

Could not be more simple.  This was my second time making this soup, the first time I drained but didn't rinse the beans and it turned the soup an ugly grey color...still delicious, just ugly.  This time I rinsed them really well.  I also made a cup of white rice and put that in the soup as well, it really helped thicken it without having to use a cream soup like other reviewers did.  As for seasoning, I added a splash of lemon juice, a lot of garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, pepper, and a dash of red pepper flakes.  I put mozzerella and a tortilla chip crumbled on top.

Really!?! 
I used a roast chicken v. canned, and a cream of chicken soup uncondensed v. one of the broths.
Put home made corn tortilla chips on the bottom of the bowls and then garnished with cheese.
Almost too easy; and terrific!  I will guiltily make this again and again... good enough for company!

This was simple and tasty. I used Rotel tomatoes, chiles with cilantro. I planned to use one can of cream of chicken soup but bought cream of mushroom on accident. My husband added red pepper to his. I simmered this in the crockpot for 3-4 hours on low.

I took a slightly modified version of this to a potluck at church tonight, and it was a big hit.  My husband and I really loved it, too. I loved how EASY it was to make!

I was uncertain about using canned chicken, so I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and bought a rotisserie chicken in Walmart's deli. 

To make a large pot, I put in 3 cans drained corn, 3 cans Rotel (2 regular, and 1 mild), and 3 cans rinsed & drained black beans. I added about half of a large chicken. I added 2 cans of Cream of Chicken, about 30 oz each, and 2 cartons of chicken broth, also about 30 oz each.

The only seasoning I added was some Cumin, and I just shook it in there, stirring and tasting 'til it was right (maybe 1 TBSP or so). 

It tasted wonderful. We served it over Mission Tortilla Strips (chips), with a sprinkling of grated cheddar cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. I will be making this recipe ALOT. Thanks to who shared it!

EXTREMELY simple, and very tasty!  The only negative thing is the color...just reminds me of dirty mop water.  Next time I will drain my black beans, maybe that'll make it look a little better.

This is a good starter recipe, but there is so much you can do with this - add onion, jalapenos, garlic, green chilies, corn tortillas....  Top with cheese, red onion, cilantro, sour cream....  The options are endless.  I've made this before and it's a good base recipe.

Great recipe for a cold night!  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and substituted 1 can of cream of chicken soup for 1 can of chicken broth (use Swanson's broth).  I also drained and rinsed the black beans and used a rotisserie chicken instead of can chicken.  I added a little chili pepper and garlic powder.  Topped it all with shredded cheddar cheese and tortilla chips --  delicious!

This is convenient, easy and uses up ingredients on hand.  But it has little flavor and tastes exactly like what it is: cans of stuff thrown together and doesn't really blend.  (And I'm not some food "snob" who thinks dinner can't come out of a can.  Or else I wouldn't have tried it.)

Yummy and Easy!  I used chicken breast instead of canned chicken and to spice it up some I followed other reviews and added 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 tbs cumin, 1/2 tbs. chilli powder, and cilantro.  My entire family raves about this soup!

I love how easy this is to make, and although it is very spicy, it still tastes great. But unless you want the soup to taste fake in a very-processed-canned-food-way, DO NOT add a can of cream of chicken soup.

I found this recipe on here over 5 years ago & have used it regularly ever since . I figured it was about time I reviewed it ! It's wonderful just as it is but I do add a spoonful or 2 of taco seasoning , use half broth & half cream of chicken & whatever form of Rotel tomatoes & chilis I have on hand (usually a combination of tomatoes & jalapenos & tomatoes with lime and cilantro). I buy white shredded chicken in 3lb. cans , use part of it & freeze the rest (getting @ least 3 meals /can ) Skip the chips & sour cream & you have a nutritious diet friendly hot lunch !

This is one of the best soup recipes EVER!  I have taken this to potlucks, church soup suppers and family dinners and every time I make it people ask for the recipe. I do make it with the cream of chicken soup as many other people suggested as it seemed too "watered down" with just the broth.  I also use frozen corn in place of the canned corn, boiled chicken breasts in place of canned chicken and I add chili powder and cumin to taste.  This soup is even better then next day after the flavors have really blended.

My kids and I have made this recipe over and over again. Fabulous topped with a dollop of sour cream and a few broken tortilla chips. Sometimes we add more beans, mixing and matching different kinds, but always rinsing them first. I make this just about every other week - it's quick, easy, inexpensive, and even the kids can make it.

I made this tonight for my family and doubled the recipe.  It was awesome, though I did alter it a bit.  I first sauteed half an onion in a little olive oil, then added 2 cans of chicken broth, and a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken.  I also added two cans of water, and some cumin and black pepper.  I then added the Rotel and frozen corn and black beans.  I didn't use canned chicken (yuck), but used shredded chicken from a rotisserie roast.  It came out marvelous and my family loved it with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

I have wanted to make a taco soup for awhile now. I used this recipe and kinda of combined it with another on this site that used taco seasoning...I also boiled a whole chicken, shredded it, strained the broth, and put the chicken back in the broth with the other ingredients. (I didn't want to use canned chicken). Seasoned everything with a pkg. of taco seasoning, a little salt, and black pepper. A bit more work than using can chicken, but we thought it was really good!

This is really good!  I, too, used 1 can chicken broth and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  I sauteed some chopped red onion w/ garlic in olive oil then added the broth.  I poached 6 chicken tenderloins and shredded them instead of canned chicken.  I did toss in some taco seasoning like many other reviewers recommended.  Served it over cooked white rice, and topped w/ shredded mexican blend cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and garnished w/ Tostitos Gold tortilla chips.  Wonderful!  I printed a copy of this recipe to keep in the camper, and will stock up on the canned goods for a quick and impressive camp-out dinner!

WOW, this is so good. I made some simple changes like others had suggested. I bought a rotisserie chicken at the store, and used that for the meat.  I used one can chicken broth, and one can cream of chicken soup. I added half a packet of taco seasoning. I added lime juice, basil, and cilantro, just because I love those flavors together. Smashed some chips and sprinkled cheese on it, and OH MY!!! It was soooo good. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!!!

This is a good recipe if you want to make something quick. I used 2 cans of condensed chicken with rice instead of chicken broth and only 1 can of water. Also, I added 1 package of taco seasoning, 1 package of ranch seasoning, and a can of kidney beans for more flavor! It was great over chips!

Fast, easy and dang tasty too! Made it according to recipe on the first try and it was great as is. TRY USING A STORE ROASTED ROTISSERIE CHICKEN in place of the canned chicken!  Second time I tossed in some fresh Cilantro...double yum.  Serve with a dallop of sour cream on top. YUM! Great for the busy working person. I've made this quite a few times, and keep it's ingredients in the cupboard for a fast meal.

I have had so much fun with this recipe! My version has changes it a bit. I do not drain the corn, but I do rinse & drain the black beans, I also add a can of undrained great northern beans. I like to use 1 can of Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla Soup instead of the 2 broth and my best results were using 5-6 chopped breaded Tysons Buffalo style chicken tenders (I have also using the meat from leftover buffalo wings)instead of the canned chicken. I bring all ingredients to a boil, cover and let stand until just warm. Then I blend partially with an immersable stick blender to thicken and improve texture. No one knows what's in it, but they are nuts for it!

This was a pretty good soup with some alterations, due to having kids..... I doubled the recipe, but used 1 can of broth, and 1 can cream of chicken w/ 1 can of water. I used 1 can regular corn and 1 can cream style corn. I used 1 can of Ro-Tel MILD tomatoes and 1 can regular tomatoes. I used 2 cans of black beans, but I did rinse them well prior to adding them (canned black beans if not rinsed will give any dish an ill looking color.). I used two cooked and cubed chicken breasts, seasoned with garlic powder and black pepper. I threw this all in my crockpot, cooked on low for about 6 hours. I served it with shredded cheese and dollops of sour cream.

This was so easy to make and very good - it definitely have replaced my original tortilla recipe. I like my tortilla soup a little more "tomatoey" so I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce along with cumin, garlic powder and chili pepper.  I don't like canned chicken so I used frozen cooked dice chicken breast instead.  Delicous!!!!

Fabulous. Who would have thought you could get gourmet flavor with canned items? I added an additional can of chopped green chiles, cumin, chopped onion and garlic. Topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese.

This was fabulous! Everyone enjoyed it so much that...we all took it the next day for lunch.  I did make a few changes though. Most of the soups such as this that I have had in the past have had a tomato base...more than just the diced tomato's so...I added about a half a cup of pureed tomato's after I added everything else and also about a tablespoon or so of sugar just to sweeten it up a bit. Oh...and I also...at the advice of others...used one less can of chicken stock and used a can of cream of chicken soup in place of it. I used chicken tenders that I cut up and sprinkled a touch of cayenne and chili power on before I cooked them. Can't say that I would ever use canned chicken. I also added additional cayenne and crushed red peppper flakes to it to give it an extra kick and it was just perfect! I will be making this one....again and again. Thank you for another winning recipe!

This recipe is beyond awesome, especially when taking everyone's suggestions into consideration. I used Rotel mild tomatoes with lime and cilantro; S&W's Caribbean style black beans with lime and peppers; substituted one can cream of chicken soup; and added one tsp. cumin. There is no easier soup recipe on the planet, and the taste can't be beat!

I made this soup for my sorority function tonight and it was a smash! Every one just raved about it! It was cheap, easy, and delicious! I sauteed cubed chicken in garlic instead of using the canned chicken; it was perfect! Thanks Terryn for a very tasty and simple meal!

MUY DELICIOSO!!  I would have given this 10 stars if I could have, for ease of preparation and overall yumminess.  I used the Rotel "Mexical Festival" tomatoes w/ chiles, and the only thing I did different was add 1 can cream of chicken soup in place of 1 of the cans of broth.  I may add some enchilada sauce to the mix next time, just for kicks.  Thank you SO much Terryn for sharing - definitely a keeper!!!

This is wonderful!  My seven-year-old daughter actually made the soup, with my help in adding cumin, fajita seasoning and garlic powder.  We substituted shrimp for half of the chicken, used fat-free cheese and low-fat tortilla chips--and one serving came to about 6 Weight Watcher points...and left me stuffed!

I normally steer away from recipes calling for  several canned items but ... THIS WAS SUPER.  Inspired by some of the other reviews, I substituted one of the cans of broth with Healthy Request cream of chicken soup, used extra hot Rotel tomatoes with chilies, a few black olives with jalapenos and chunked freshly cooked chicken breast.  I broke up some tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl and to the top, when serving, I added green onion, sour cream and a little cubed avocado.  Made some fresh cornbread on the side.  We loved it and will make it over and over again.  Warning: our version is very spicy.

This was fantastic.  VERY easy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe and still had NO leftovers.   I put mine over white rice and added a few jalepenos.  It's plenty spicy by itself, but I added a little more heat.  My family says to give this one 6 thumbs up!!

Very easy and delicious.  I added some onion and bell pepper flakes.  I also took the advice of other reviewers before me and used just one can of chicken broth and used one can of cream of chicken soup.  We served it over tortilla chips and topped with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and avocado.  It really turned out great.  Thank you for the great recipe.  I will definitely make again.

This soup was good. Not great, but good.  If I hadn't topped it off with cheese and tortilla chips it would not have even received a 4 star rating.  If you read most of these reviews, you will find that most of the people added a little something extra...you almost have to because the recipe as it is can only be considered a starting off point.  It definitely needs a little something extra.  That said, it was one of the quickest and easiest meals I have ever made.

This is definitely a 5 star rating.  It was so simple and yet delicious.  I julienned some leftover flour tortillas I has left from tacos last week and baked them in the oven until crisp and then used for a garnish with fat free sour cream and olives.  Perfection!

Delicious and easy. I followed the recipe one time and then the next time wanted something a little more thick and hearty and I added one more can of chicken and a can of crem of chicken soup.  I think it is better if you heat thoroughly by bringing to a boil and let it sit for a while or even eat it the next day. We put shredded cheese and crushed tortilla chips on top. ....Cathy

Super quick and ALL the kids liked it.  Used 1 can cream chicken soup and 1 cup chicken bouillon.  I'd consider adding chopped carrots and/or green pepper to hide more veggies for the kids next time.

Made this for the first time last night & everyone loved it! Used Tyson pre-cooked southwest style chicken strips instead of chicken chunk & a little Mrs. Dash southwest spice to the broth for more flavor. Incredibly quick & easy to make you'll feel a little guilty when it tastes so good!

I did use what other reviewers posted to add to this base recipe and it turned out delicious!  I was surprised by all the flavors.  This is what I did, I used a can of chicken broth, 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, I rinsed my black beans, I usually don't care for canned chicken but since I had some I used it, I added cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and cilantro.  As another reviewer posted I cut up two tortillas and baked at 350 for a few minutes.  I topped it with baked tortillas, cheese, sour cream, and chives.  Thank you all for the reviews and thanks for posting this recipe. Quick, easy, and delicious!

I love this recipe. It's simple and my son loves it. My co-workers loved this. I made this over Thanksgiving with leftover turkey, it was great. I used the reviews from the other raters and I highly recommend you take their suggestions. 1 can of cream of chicken, 1tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp of chili powder, and I use the rotisserie chicken you buy at Walmart for less than $5 and cut up 2 cups, perfectly seasoned, and already hot and ready. We are talking 10-15 min. tops and dinner or lunch is ready.

It was good but not great. I did one can broth plus one can cream of chicken. I think next time I'll try two cans cream of chicken. I drained the black beans and corn, and added cumin, garlic powder and chili powder. Next time I should add a lil lime juice and avocado slices cuz it needed a flavor boost.

Made it a few times and did make some spice adjustments and  added cream of chicken soup, but since its turkey leftover time, I subbed turkey and it was awesome. My turkey had been Weber Q'd with a little hickory. Too good!

I follow WW's SFT so I decided to thicken the soup with fat free refried beans instead of cream of chicken soup. Also added garlic, onion, chili powder, cumin, and green chilies. Might be my new winter soup!

Very good soup. We have been making for almost 10 years with a few variations. Switch out 1 can of broth for a can of refried black beans and add a cup of cheese to the soup. Makes a nice thick satisfying soup. Fresh or rotisserie chicken is good and frozen corn is good too. Not a pretty soup but always a hit.

Added two cans of cream of chicken soup, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp of garlic powder. For the chicken, I threw a couple of frozen breasts in the oven and then shredded them up. Used about 15 ounces of black bean and corn salsa instead of the tomatoes. Topped with a spoon of sour cream, sharp cheddar, and tortillas strips. This was so easy and delicious. Adding into my regular dinner rotation.

I did a few things to this already great recipe.  It is on my file as 8-can chicken tortilla soup.  I used 2 cans chicken broth, 2 cans condensed cream of chicken soup (not low fat), 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes and green chiles (mild), 1 can of drained corn, and 1 can of rinsed and drained black beans.  I grilled 2 chicken breasts seasoned with salt, pepper, seasoning salt, and a spicy steak seasoning mix, and shredded them into the soup. I seasoned soup with salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, ground cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and 2 envelopes sazon seasoning.  This really helps to give flavor and color. Thanks for a real keeper.

I had a can of chicken and didn't know what to do with it. We don't really like canned chicken in most things. But this did turn out really good. I admit I added a couple of extra cans of what I had - an extra can of diced tomatoes w/chiles, a can of cream of chicken soup - and I didn't drain the tomatoes because I typically only have buillon on hand, not canned broth, so I always have to add water to these recipes. ANYWAY. It was really surprisingly good. Spicier than I thought thanks to the tomatoes with chiles. I will make this again but I think the recipe doesn't provide enough liquid as written. Oh also I made this in a small slow cooker, just leaving it on for a few hours to let everything blend without having to worry about stirring. So it's really good if you have little time to prepare.

Amazing, it's hard to mess this recipe up as you can add cans of almost anything and it comes out good. I add just a little cumin and chili powder and shredded chicken breasts.It's really fast to make if your in a hurry. Just dump everything in a pot and waith until hot

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet (been making it since 2002)!   This is a great quick soup, I usually keep the ingredients on hand.  I cut up a chicken breast and put it in to cook before most of the other ingredients, and use rotel.  Perfect on a chilly day!

2015 update: Still 5 stars! I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I've been making this for several years now, probably more than 200 batches.  It is the absolutely best chicken soup recipe I have.  I ALWAYS make sure I have the ingredients for this on hand.  When I don't feel well, it is so easy to throw together.  Today, I changed it up a little...again. Used the 6 cans as listed, used hominy corn. Skipped the taco seasoning and added 4 cloves of garlic, sliced.  Great for fending off a cold.  Last time, I added sauteed onions, mushrooms and garlic, left out the Rotel and added 4 oz HOT jalapenos and 1 can Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes. I also substituted a can of whole white hominy for the whole corn.  Good thing I tasted before adding taco seasoning - it didn't need any after those jalapenos went in!  By the way, instead of using canned chicken, I make this with leftover turkey after the holidays. Now, back to your regularly scheduled program... 
I'll admit it - I keep canned chicken in my pantry for emergencies.  But this is the ONLY recipe I've ever found that makes canned chicken edible.  More than that, with spicy tomatoes and peppers, and a little homemade taco seasoning, it's pretty good. (Drain the chicken, definitely!) Please note that as written, this recipe is naturally gluten-free (WooHooooo!)  Next time, I plan to substitute refried beans for the black beans, for the flavor and the thickening effect.  I served it with tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded Cheddar, with oranges

I LOVED IT!! I added some Frank's hot sauce to it, because we wanted a little bit more of a kick.  I think I'll try adding cumin to it next time (as other reviewers suggested) or maybe cut up some jalepenos.  I added some baked tortilla strips to the soup.

I used canned chicken breast to save time. I also sautéed a small onion w/ garlic and a bit of olive oil in a large pot then added the rest of the ingredients. I added ground Cayenne, cumin and juice of a half of a lime.  Then, I simmered for about 30 minutes. I served with sour cream, chopped avocado and tortilla chips.

I can't believe it - but we absolutely loved this soup!  It was incredibly easy and so good.  I will say, that I could tell the soup was made from canned goods, it did just have that taste a little bit.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup in place of the broth as others reviewers suggested.  Will be making again when I'm in a jam.

I love this. Its a family favorite now...Since I didn't have the right tomatoes I used some Pace salsa, hot sauce, chili powder, pepper, and chili flakes also with my Italian diced ones. I think the Rotel Tomatoes would be perfect and I am gonna try that next time. lol

 

I boiled the chicken breast (do WAY more chicken, I just had the one chicken breast... I think three would be perfect) and then shredded it with a fork and opened all the cans and put them in my crock pot. I didn't add water to the cream of chicken soup. It really helps to clean out your pantry!! lol... It was awesome... Do some tortilla chips on the bottom of the bowl, put the soup on that, then top with cilantro, cheese and sour cream! Enjoy!! Let me know how it turns out for you!

This is a bland recipe. However if you have absolutely no cooking skill this is perfect for you. All you have to do is open some cans and put it in your crockpot. I agree with the other reviewers that this must be doctored up to be a good recipe.

As it reads I gave it 3 stars. I doubled the recipe to make 12 servings. It's a great starting point. After tasting and it was too bland I added about 4 cups of chicken stock made from boiling a roasted chicken. Then I added about 2 tablespoons of prepared taco seasoning. Simmered for 20 minutes and served with 2% shredded Mexican cheese and Fritos on top. Was much much more flavorful. We loved it and I have several more meals left of it ;)

An EXCELLENT soup!  My family LOVED it!  As other reviews have said, I did tweak it a bit.  Instead of 2 chicken broths, I did 1 cream of chicken soup and 1 chicken broth - both of them fat free.  I also shredded up some chicken I grilled instead of canned chicken.  Finally, I also added seasonings - cilantro, green onions, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and salt and pepper!  YUM!  Top it off with a dollop of light sour cream and some cheese along with some crunched up tortilla chips and you have a masterpiece!

You have to add more in then it says. It was ok. You at least need to add salt and pepper, and maybe some red pepper, cumin, and some chili powder

One word = DELISH!
For a heartier, thicker soup... you can also add one (1) 10oz. can of cream of chicken and 1/2 cup of prepared/cooked rice. Feel free to use any kind of rice you'd like (i.e. plain white rice, yellow rice or even chicken flavored Rice A Roni). The rice definitely adds great texture and makes the soup more filling! Sprinkled with some Mexican shredded cheese and garnished with a few blue corn tortilla chips... and you've got yourself one hearty Mexican inspired meal!

I cannot believe a recipe that has all canned goods could be absolutely delicious! According to other reviewers, I didn't want a watery soup, so I added a can of cream of chicken. With this additional can you need some extra spices. So, I used garlic powder and some cumin-and perfection! Best served on tortilla chips with some cheese on top.

I made some changes based on the reviews, and I'm giving it 5 stars because of the way it turned out.  I watch what I eat and only eat organic, so here is what I added to be specific.  First off, I wanted to use quality SHREDDED chicken, so it's easy when you can use the crock pot.  I used two organic and free-range breasts, and put them in the crock pot for 3.5 hours in one can of organic cream of chicken soup, 15 ounces of chicken broth (yes, organic), 1.5 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of garlic, 1 tsp. ground black pepper and 1/2 tsp kosher salt.  After the chicken fell apart (3.5 hours), I added the cans of veggies, and every can I added was of the organic variety.  Find whatever you can.  I also used organic cheese at the end as a garnish in addition to an organic lime to juice over the top.  In my bowl, I ate just the soup with no cheese or tortilla chips, but with my partner (who can't seem to gain weight no matter what he does) I added the cheese and crushed tortillas.  I figured this recipe out to be LESS than 200 calories per serving if you do not add cheese or tortilla chips and I didn't miss them at all.  It's a little spicy this way, but very authentic tasting!  In the future, I might put a dollop of sour cream on top of my partner's soup - he could use the fat, and I'm sure it would taste good, too.

Perfect as is, but after the first time I added a can of refried beans and a chipotle bouillon cube.  Now it tastes like the soup in local Mexican restaurants.

Loved this! Def. took the advice with the cream of chicken soup, but I might use only cream of chicken soup next time.  My fiance and I like thick soups, so maybe that will thicken it up. Great the way it is though! (with the adjustments) By the way, the cilantro was a great suggestion!

I have been making this soup for years.  I use a jar or two of corn and bean salsa instead of the cans of each. You can eliminate three cans right there.  :)  For more flavor I also add a packet of taco seasoning.  Awesome with tortilla or corn chips, a little sour cream and of course cheese!

Solid.  I used fresh boneless skinless chicken and cooked that down in the broth, and then shredded, before adding the other ingredients.  I also added a packet of taco seasoning.  It was pretty bland before that.   The kids complained that the Ro-tel tomatoes I added were too spicy.

I've made this soup for years,but my version calls for creamed corn and 1 can of "Ranch" style beans.
Also use half pkg of Taco seasoning mix.
It is sooo good.A family favorite during cold winter months.

I find this an excellent starting point for a recipe !  It's tasty and easy for a beginning cook...and SO easy to add a "little something" to make it your own!  I added some sauteed onions, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and a can of cheese soup...made it seven can soup...but it was great!  Any the family loved it too!

Not a gourmet masterpiece, but a quick way to pull something together out of pantry staples, plus it's easy enough for babysitters or older kids to do.

My husband is so sick of this because I make it every Sunday and I take it to work for lunch all week. Probably the Easiest & my FAVORITE recipe on this site! The only changes I make-I use real chicken breast, and I add a can of green chilies & Kidney beans.

This is by far one of the recipes from this site that I use the most.  I used BLSL chicken breasts in lieu of canned chicken and I throw it all in the crockpot.  I always double the recipe as it is very popular at my house.  Easy and delicious...two of my favorite traits in a recipe~!  Thank you so much for sharing Terryn!  My family thanks you too!

Love this soup it is so easy to make, I love to freeze it and re-heat later. I always add spices to mine and a can of jalapenos to give it a little kick. I like to add, chili powder, garlic powder, and some fresh ground black pepper.

I had high hopes, but this was too watery and bland, even with additional spices. At least I got rid of some of the cans in my pantry.

Yummy and easy. I had chicken fajita mix with precut onions and bell peppers but the family was in the mood for soup. I cooked up the chicken and vegetables, cut up the cooked chicken and added it all to the pot. I didn't have any beans and I didn't drain the tomatoes (mine were Italian). Delicious!

I've just made this soup for the second time now and it was wonderful!  I put everything into the crockpot first thing this morning when I got to work and then by lunch it was ready to be served for all of my coworkers.  Was nervous about the canned chicken vs. cooking my own, but it actually turned out really well.  My modifications:  substituted 1/2 of the chicken broth for reduced fat cream of chicken soup, added a packet of taco seasoning, and rinsed the black beans before adding.  Turned out perfect and was a great treat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Follow directions exactly.  Quick, easy and the entire family liked it.  My 9 yr old daughter loved it! We topped our soup with broken tostito gold, avocado slices and a little shredded mild cheddar.  Will make this all winter!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I both loved this recipe. It will definitely become a part of our regular menu. I made a few modifications: used baked chicken instead of canned, added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the broth. It was fabulous. I also took the suggestions that others added to top with tortilla chips and cheese. I would highly recommend this, especially for those looking for a quick and filling meal. When making this recipe the third time, I decided to add a can of fat free refried beans to thicken the soup, and it was perfect. It gave the soup a great texture.

Delicious!  I must be a wimp on the heat meter because this was spicy enough for me.  I did as others suggested (but doubled the recipe):  replaced 1/2 the chicken broth for cream of chicken soup; used a rotisserie chicken; and topped it off with sour cream, mexican cheese, and crushed tortilla chips.  Will definitely be added to my list of favorite soups.  Thanks!

Oh wow, I must have done something wrong because the soup was awful! It was way too watery and tasted bland. I tried to add some herbs (e.g., some parsley and a bit of cilantro) but it only made it worse. I don't think I will be doing this again.

Excellent soup.  As recommended by ohers, instead of using 2 cans of broth I used two cans of Campbells Select Mexican tortilla soup.  Also used half of a rotisserie chicken instead of the canned chicken.  Be sure to drain and rince the black beans before adding to avoid having your soup turn grey!  I served the soup using the Baked Dostito Chips trying to keep the fat grams down.  I served this to my sister inlaw who wanted the recipe.  She made a batch, took some to work and shared some with a co-worker who also loved it and asked for the recipe.  The co-worker went home and made it for her husband, who just loved it and asked fora second bowl.  Definately a keeper.  If you are thinking about making this recipe, don't hesitate - just do it!

I have made this several times and can't thank you enough for this FABULOUS recipe!  I use chicken breast, sub 1 can of low fat cream of chicken for 1 can of broth, use only 1/2 bag of frozen corn, add some finely chopped onions, a can of kidney beans in addition to the black (for color), 2 cans of chili-tomatoes with the juice and the 1/2 packet of taco seasoning...it's not only delicious, but also keeps it healthy! It's so tasty, that we actually skip the tortilla chips! Thanks again for a great recipe!!!

I make this soup all of the time...and everybody loves it.  I've modified it a little...1 can chicken (if I don't have time to boil chicken), 2 cans chicken broth, I puree the 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can black beans, 1 can corn, and I add one can of enchilada sauce. I also prefer to use jack cheese.

I wish I had more stars to give this recipe. I think it has saved me on more busy nights than I can count! My 12 year old daughter begs me to make this for her special birthday meal! And to think I expected her to turn her nose up when she saw it!!! Definitely use the cream of chicken soup. Top with cheese, sour cream, and salsa if you have them on hand.

This recipe wins the cake for easy...but not for being tasty.  It had the basics...but DEFINITELY needed much spicing up.  I ended up adding chili powder, garlic powder and salsa.  Once we added the tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded cheese on top...it was excellent. (I also used fresh chicken and frozen corn.)

WOW! Really loved this recipe. Since I have to watch my sodium intake I made a few minor changes. I used frozen corn, 3 cups of very low sodium chicken boullion(may use 4 next time), 1 can of no salted added dicced tomatoes, 1 small can of green chile peppers and added 1 tsp. of cilantro and 1/2 tsp of cumin, black pepper to taste.  Even my 14 year old daughter loved.  Definately a quick & easy meal. Delicious too!

My husband loved this and has already asked that I make it again soon.  I did substitute one can crm of chix soup for one of the cans of broth, and also about 1/2 pkg taco seasoning for flavor.  Used chopped chix breast instead of canned, drained the beans, and used Fritos for the chipss.  Yum!

This was good; I made the following adjustments: fresh chicken saute'd with taco seasoning and water (added to pot), saute'd onions with fresh garlic, low sodium black beans and a second can of pinto beans, 1/2 can green chili's, 1/2 can diced jalepenos, 1 can low sodium chicken broth, 1 can of water.  Also fried corn tortilla strips, and had olives, green onion and sour cream available as garnish, as suggested by other reviewers.  I will try fresh tomatoes in the future.  It was really good.

This recipe is great! It received many great reviews, even from my sister, who criticizes every thing I make. She even made a third request for me to make more tomorrow. Another thing that makes this recipe great is the fact that you can buy a lot of the ingredients at once, since all the products are canned, and make it in a jiffy any time you get the urge to have tortilla soup :)

We LOVED it.  This was quick, inexpensive, and delicious.  I also used ROTEL tomatoes, the cumin, and cilantro based on previous reviews.  I also boiled chicken, as I don't care for canned as much.  I also used one can of broth, one can of cream of chicken...this added great consistency.  However, I may add a little more liquid next time.  Topped w/ shredded mexican cheese, tortillas, and sour cream was the added bonus.  I will pass this one on for sure and make it again and again.  Oh, i also made lime margaritas for added flair!!

This has become one of our favorite soup recipes!  Tastes great & easy to make
when you're tired & "don't feel like cooking".  I substitute a can of cream of celery
soup for one of the chicken broths.  The best thing about this soup is that it uses
up all those crushed tortilla chips that are always at the bottom of the bag.

Delicious. Substituted one can of cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of chicken broth (used low sodium versions). Added a couple of dashes of cumin. Also, as previously suggested I used Rotel brand diced tomatoes w/green chiles and pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the deli. Finished off with lots of tortilla chip pieces, Kraft Mexican cheese and sour cream.

This received five stars in my family. I used 2 cans of broth but with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. Otherwise it would not have fed our family of three. I left out the beans as they are not big with us and used frozen corn which tasted fine. Also used a can of Rotel suggested by others which I think gave it plenty of kick. I did add some grated Mexican blend cheese on top and also tried it with a dollop of sour cream on top. Both were great and the sour cream even cuts the bite nicely.  The only other thing is next time I'll cut out the tortilla chips entirely. I don't think they're needed. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe.

I like this recipe a lot and I used many of the reviewer recommendations.  I added 1 large onion, browned separately; 2 chicken breast halves chopped and browned with 4 cloves of minced garlic, 2 teaspoons taco seasoning, and one teaspoon each of cumin and coriander seed, crushed.  Next time I make it I'm going to use creamed corn to thicken it somewhat and I'm going to mince a jalapeno and add it to the onion.  Thanks to the author of this recipe.

I almost didn't try this recipe because I like to make things from scratch. So here's what I used following the general guidelines of the original recipe:
1 can whole kernel corn, drained. 1 can of pinto beans since my husband doesn't like black beans. 2 cups of homemade (organic) chicken broth. Prebaked, diced chicken breasts which I had in my freezer. A can of Roitel diced tomatoes with chili peppers. 
Before serving I sprinkled a generous amount of Louisiana hot sauce on top, since my husband and I both like things spicy, plus some cheddar cheese. It was awsome! Best soup I ever made.
Thanks for the inspiration Terryn!

Indeed...coming from canned items in my pantry this was very tasty! This went well with our homemade toasted sub sandwiches! I used northern beans instead of black beans and added some chili powder and onion powder to taste. Next time, I will invest a little more time and grill/season some chicken. We garnished each bowl with a little sharp cheddar cheese.

Wow! was this ever good. Followed the recipe exactly, but added some basil, about a clove of minced garlic, and a teaspoon of red pepper flake and some black pepper.
Was extremely easy and fast to make.

What a great soup, and so easy to make!  I took the advise of others and used 1 can or chicken broth and 1 can or cream of chicken soup.  I did not add any additional water and it was plenty "soupy" for me.  It makes a ton and works well as leftovers too.  Yum!

Good and easy. I added some velveeta and salsa as was suggested. That was a great addition. I can't imagine this soup without some good cheesy flavor. I also added some red pepper and cayenne pepper. It was so quick to make. If I have more time the next time around I will saute and season some chicken to add instead of using canned. Bake some biscuits and you have a great meal!

This recipe, as others have said, is a great starter recipe. I would think that it would be a little blah without adding something extra. We added onion and a little taco seasoning mix, plus used fresh chicken (not canned). I served it with shredded cheddar cheese and tortilla chips and everyone, including my 16-month-old, liked it. This recipe is so easy and quick!  Definitely a keeper especially for that factor!

I followed the recipe and found it too bland. To spice it up, I added about 2 teaspoons of taco seasoning mix, some coriander, cumin, cayenne, and a dash of lemon juice. THEN it was awesome!

I gave it a 4 because I changed it a little.  As others have done, I used one can of Cream of Chicken soup.  I sautéed a small onion, minced garlic, salt and pepper, and, the canned chicken.  Then, I added the remaining ingredients, seasoning with more black pepper, red pepper & cumin.  Yummy!

No real depth of flavor. I added onion, cumin and real chicken. I had to put it all in a pot, season it properly and simmer for another hour the next day...but then we live in AZ and have high expectations in our tortilla soup!

OK as a base recipe but needs a LOT of spicing up; very bland as is.
I added a tsp. of ground cumin, 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  Also, drain and rinse the black beans.

Super easy, and we loved the flavor. We used veggie broth instead, and next time I would like to add more beans and corn so it's a bit more substantial.

Excellent!  I double the recipe for a family of 4 with some leftovers. I use 3 large cans of chicken and add 2T of cumin and 2T of chili powder.  Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, corn chips or crackers. Delicious!!

So easy and so delicious! This is probaly my most shared recipe. I love to make this for dinner when time is short. Probably the fastest, yummiest dinner for busy families. I followed the recipes as is, except I used 1 can Cream of Chicken and 1 can Chicken broth. I prefer it a little thicker. Serve with tortilla chips, and dinner ( or lunch) is ready in just a few minutes!

We made this recipe as written, except we did drain and rinse the black beans.  We mixed in some crunched up tortilla chips in our bowls and we sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese over the top for our kids.  My husband, 6 year old son, and I all loved it.  Our 3 and 1 year old daughters were a little turned off by the slight spicy taste though.  We will make it again.

I gave this an extra star because it's so easy.  Canned chicken doesn't excite me, so I replaced it with a second can of black beans.  I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning mix.  I also replace one can of chicken broth with 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup to make things thicker and creamier.  I don't use the tomatoes with chile peppers because I don't like hot food - I have no problem with it being bland without them.  Oh, always rinse your beans - it helps keep the bean "after effect" down to a minimum.

I've made this recipe many times since finding it, but I always use fresh chicken and cook/dice it. I do add a good amount of garlic and cumin and some "tamed" chopped jalapeno pepper slices for a bit of heat. I normally make a double batch because I love it so much and it's even better on day 2 or 3! Tortilla chips in the bowl and chips, sour cream and avocado on the top. Mmmm

Unbelievably easy and good. I followed the suggestions to use 1 can broth and 2 cans of cream of chicken as well as suggestions for rotisserie chicken, chili powder, garlic powder and pepper.  Only original change was I used about 1/2 cup heavy cream - awesome!

If you find this recipe too watery try to add a can of refried beans! It thickens it up just enough! Also, instead of using canned chicken I put 2 chicken breasts in my crock pot all day with some salsa. When I get home I add the rest of the ingredients! SO GOOD!

I really loved this soup,but the only recommendation I have is that you use a roasted chicken you can pick up at the market. I used low sodium chicken stock and didn't need to add salt. The chicken seasons the soul perfectly. So simple and so delicious. Top with a sprinkling of shredded cheese and some avocado chunks and you're good to go.

My 7 yo LOVES this soup and requests it regularly.  One thing I do change at times is to use frozen corn instead of canned, simply to cut down on salt.  When I do use the canned variety, I don't drain it.  I also use the larger cans of chicken (13 oz) that I typically can only find at Sam's.

Absolutely you have to doctor this recipe, but it is an amazing base recipe to make something your own and great.
I wanted to try and keep mine as natural as possible so I skipped the cream of soup tips.  I was lucky enough to find, at my local grocer, Swanson's Mexican Tortilla flavor infused broth and I think that is what helped my soup the most.  I still added lots of fresh garlic because I love garlic, but other then that I kept everything else the same.  I added the whole 32oz box of the broth and it wasn't to "soupy" for me.  Also I added red pepper flakes and then topped it with plain yogurt and blue tortilla chips to cool it down.  This has probably been one of my favorite things I've made and I've tried a lot off of this site.
So give it a try, make it your own and enjoy!
p.s. I simmered my for about an hour because I had the time.

I gave this recipe a 4 star instead of a 5 star due to changing it just a little. I didn't follow this to the 'T'. First I had to add some spice. I added, per my taste, chilli powder and oregano. It kicked it up a bit and gave it the little something I felt was missing. Also, I changed out the  15 ounce of can whole kernel corn to 15 ounces of MexiCorn. I also added some fat free sour cream, tortilla chips and green onions to the top of the soup. 
After the small changes I can say this soup will be on the table a few times during the month. The cost is very low and everyone in the family LOVED it. Double WIN!

I love easy and simple recipes, and that is why this one is great.  I did however tweak the recipe by following the review posted by SSCHULTE14.  Everything he/she said to add definitely kicked it up a notch!  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing SSCHULTE14!

This is a great BASE recipe for chicken tortilla soup!! I did this recipe in my crock pot with a few tweaks. I swapped canned chicken for fresh strips of chicken breast. B/c I didn't want to wait for raw chicken to cook in the crock pot, I cooked the chicken in a frying pan for 2 mins. on each side. Add partially cooked chicken to crock pot with 1 Cup of Chicken Broth and let cook on High for 1.5-2 hours. Shred chicken and add the drained corn, drained & RINSED black beans, diced tomatoes (not drained) & the rest of the can of chicken broth plus the second can from the original recipe. ADDITIONS: I added two cans of 10.5 oz condensed cream of chicken to add thickness. And for flavoring I added garlic powder, salt, pepper, and LOTS of chili powder. Top with a dollop of sour cream if you wish and some left over flour tortillas cut into strips and baked. I also garnished with a bit of shredded cheese.

Followed other reviews and doctored this up with a can of cream of chicken soup and cut the broth amount in half from original recipie, also rinsed the beans before adding, and used rotisserie chicken from the grocery store deli. This was a huge hit with my family! tastes really great with cumin cilantro chili powder and garlic as well. :)

This was not a favorite for us because of the canned chicken. Probably it would be much better with fresh cubed or pulled chicken.

I'm only giving it a 4* because I altered it as so many have - read the reviews and followed many suggestions: added the cr. of chick soup and used taco flavoring spice and added a can of mild chilies.
Then it was a 5* !  As for people who think that opening cans of food is not cooking, I say: "Any time I'm not eating in a restaurant and working to put together something in the kitchen, IT IS COOKING" !
This is a great little recipe to play with and have around for those days when you just need something w/o a big fuss ! 
Thanks to the originator - we did love it !

Made this as one of 3 soups for Wed. night Suppers @ church.  Took advice from previous review and added cream of chicken soup.  I tripled the recipe and used too much chicken broth, so had to add 5 cans of cream of chicken.  Got rave reviews.  Had enough left over for a Sat. work day @ the church building. Fire fighter who had not eaten it on Wed. ate it Sat. and told me on two different occasions how good it was.  That's saying something.  He's one of the fire house cooks.  Probably was better after setting for 2 days.

This is a good basic recipe to build upon either with chicken or vegetarian style.  The recipe as is definetly needs some kick from adding extra spices. Many other of the reviewers complained of too much salt as well.  To eliminate some of the salt content, I use canned beans and corn with no added salt and rinsed each well. I also simmered two bone chicken breasts with a 1/4 tsp salt and a few pepper corns, when done removed bones and shredded.  I then used the broth from the chicken breast in the soup and then added the veggies.  Instead of two cans of cream of chicken soup, recommended by others I used only about 1/4 cup of red enchilada sauce, to add some additional kick to the additional spices.  I too then followed the recipe by adding baked tortilla chips, homemade at the bottom of the bowel.

All I could tastes was salt!!  Oher than that it was bland.

 To reduce the sodium, rinse the canned vegetables or use frozen corn, low-sodium chicken broth or stock, rinse the canned beans, and use real cooked chicken instead.

I made this soup exactly to the recipe except that I added cooked frozen spinach instead of the corn (we didn't have any).  Even if we had corn, I would definitely add the spinach in again next time.  Even with mild tomatoes and chilis, it is still pretty spicy for us, so I served the kids' portions on top of rice and sprinkled cheese on top.  All three said they "love" it.  Rather than rice, I crushed tortilla chips on top of mine and that made it outstanding.

I got a similar recipe from Weight Watchers in 2001, and I've been making it since then, and it's always well received. I like it because it's all pantry items and makes a large batch, sometimes impromptu. I make it w/2 cans of chicken, a jar of salsa, a carton of low sodium chicken broth, a can of black beans (rinsed and drained), and a can of low fat refried beans. Delicious and easy, but a bit high in salt, and it's all in cans, so not optimum nutrition, but high marks for ease, expense, and quantity. I always keep a stash of these ingredients on hand if I unexpectedly need/want to feed extra people.

Quick and Delicious!  I took tips from others (using a rotisserie chicken instead of canned, adding garlic, cumin & chili powder), and instead of the Original Rotel, used the Mexican style which includes cilantro and lime.  My 3 kids (ages 3, 5 & 7) gobble it up with cheese, sour cream & tortilla scoops.  Muy Deliciosa!

This is a solid, fast and tasty soup recipe.  I enjoyed it as is and I tried it another time with a few revisions.  I did not have diced tomatos and chiles so I subsitituted a can of Campbells Tomato soup and a packet of taco seasoning.  I combined the soup, chicken broth and taco seasoning first, brought them to boil and then simmered for 5 minutes before adding the corn, chicken and black beans.  Nice flavor!

This recipe was great.  I had a chicken carcass in my crockpot and didn't know what to do with it.  This soup worked wonderfully.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and added a can of cream of chicken soup.  I also used what beans I had on hand and frozen corn.  Thanks so much.

This is a great base recipe. I recommend doctoring it up, a lot. Play with it and add different spices and things  to make it your own.  I also recommend slicing up some corn tortillas and frying them lightly in some drizzled olive oil, until they are crispy. Add these to the top with some shredded cheese and a sprinkle of cilantro. Nice!

We have been making this soup for years now. I always omit the canned chicken because of personal preferences, and use whatever "cream of..." can of soup that I have on hand but I think that cream of chicken or the cheddar cheese soups seem to work best! I've also thrown in leftover taco meat to help garnish before. It's hard to mess up this soup!!!

Fast easy yummy!  This is so easy and delicious.  First time I made this I used diced potatoes (canned) b/c I didn't have corn but it was just as good.  In fact, the ingredients are going on my grocery list right now.

add tortillas to thicken! this was SO easy, but did need a little doctoring. cumin, salt, pepper, and oregano to taste. I cut up two tortillas and added them in to the soup while it was boiling hot. this allowed the broth to thicken.

OMG...this was the most delicious soup!   I added my own chicken from a roasted chicken breast and added a couple tablespoons of pico de gallo and man-o-man it was tasty.
So glad I found this!!!!

I tried this with no chicken, my last can of cream of chicken soup, one can of chicken broth and all the juice from the can(s) of fire-roasted tomatoes, corn, cannellini beans, and no added seasonings, and it was great!! With the white beans, it was pretty..Next time I will make it with vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth and no cream of chicken soup!! We are now a no meat no dairy household, for heart reasons...

I took the advice from comments and used 1 can cream of chicken soup rinced beans and added the spices. However, I added a few other changes. Not having chicken I used some ground chicken I had by simply frying it up. I also added a can of hominey. Really good soup. It makes a lot though.

I don't like tomatoes or green chiles, so I skipped that can and added some chili power and few dashes of hot sauce to give it a little kick. Topped with cheese and crushed tortilla chips!

Made 2 times now and this is awesome!  Only thing I changed was used frozen corn and added garlic powder! My sis isn't too crazy about spicy things but she LOVES this!  Lower in calorie without adding cheese or chips!  Delicious as is!  Make a double batch or you'll be sorry you didn't!

Made this tonight....and it was SOOOOOO worth it!  YUMMY!!!!  I made a whole chicken last night so wanted to do something different with the "leftover" chicken.  I, like others, used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 2 cans of chicken broth.  The tomatoes I had didn't have chile peppers, so I chopped up some jalapeno's I had in the freezer.  I also added black olives, garlic, chili powder, cumin and also a dash of cayenne pepper!  This goes in the KEEPER pile!  My 13 year old is already asking if he can have this for lunch tomorrow.  That thermos I got him for school sure is paying for itself!!!

This has to be one of the fastest, best soup recipes I have ever made!  I did make some recommended changes:  1 can broth, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 T cumin and 1/2 T garlic powder.  I also use canned chicken from Costco.  It's so yummy and a family favorite!

Followed the suggestion from another review and used a can of cream of chicken instead of one of the cans of broth. I didn't have any cumin, although I will try it next time, but it didn't need anything in my opinion. I'm very picky when it comes to trying a new recipe, but I will be making this again as well as passing it on to others. Update: This has now become a weekly meal since the weather has turned cold. We love it. I use 1/2 of a rotisserie chicken instead of canned. Can't seem to do canned meat. Awesome!

To thicken, add a can of refried beans and top with shredded cheddar cheese. I have a big family so I double the chicken.

Excellent!  Like many other reviewers, I substituted one can of broth for a can of cream of chicken soup and used Mexicorn instead of regular corn.  I used Hot Rotel plus a bit of chili powder.  Served with tortilla chips, shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream with cornbread on the side.  Yum!

I gave this recipe 4 stars.  I made this soup with the addition of cream of chicken soup made from this site.  I also added about 1/4 cup of torn cilantro.  Served this with some Mexican cornbread.  Family all raved about it.  Will make this again.

I used what I had on hand which was fresh cooked chicken, a bag of corn, 2 cans of mild rotel, 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of chicken broth.  My friend is gluten intolerant, so as much as I wanted to add cream of chicken soup, I didn't.  I did add 2 teaspoons of cumin and 1/2 tsp of garlic salt.  Threw it all in the crockpot on low for about 3 hours.  This was excellent!  Not too much broth at all! My whole family and guest loved it!  Couldn't believe how simple and easy!   Definitely will become a staple!

Great recipe!  Was extremely easy to make.  Ready within minutes and very tasty.  I added cumin, garlic powder and some cayenne pepper in the mix.  Will be trying with cream of chicken like others have recommended next time.

great base but not enough flavor without adding the spices other reviewers have noted. I made strictly based on the recipe though very good, feel it is too bland without the added spices.

Good, not great, even with the suggestions made by other people (added creme of chicken for one can of broth and used my own broth for the other, 1 t cumin, 1/2 t oregano, some garlic and leftover chicken) but I like how fast it went together. 
Of course may improve dramatically over night.

This was simple and delish! I doubled the recipe, added  juice from 2 limes, a cup of chunky salsa, garlic, chili powder, cumin, a dash of red pepper, 2 cups of instant rice (not only to absorb excess liquid but to make more filling) and topped with sliced avacodos, jack cheese and thin tortita strips. This Texas family loves it. Perfect. Thanks for sharing! I also save any left over chicken breasts, shred and freeze for this very soup. Also freezes great for on the go lunches.

Like others, I liked the basic recipe and then modified. Used a can of cream of chicken instead of 2 cans of broth. BF likes it stew-like, not soup-y. Also rinsed the black beans well. We had leftover smoked chicken that made it so yummy! On top, we added sour cream and shredding Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese. It's a keeper and will be part of my rotation now.

This actually turned out really good!  I was surprised being that it's so easy!  I didn't have any tortilla chips, so I just ate it with some buttered toast, and it was delicious.

Five Star with modifications. I make this recipes at least once a month with the following important modifications: I use sausage (either Jimmy Dean-type crumbles or sliced links, which I fry before adding) in place of the chicken, or it's WAY too bland. I add oregano, chili powder and cumin, about teaspoon each. Top with tortilla chips, sour cream, avocado, grated cheese. Yummy.

This recipe was a great base...however it needed some punch. I used 1 can corn, 1 can black beans, 1 can navy beans, 1 can tomatoes and chilies (hot), 1/2 can diced tomatoes, 1 14 1/2 ounce can of chicken broth, 1 small can cream of chicken. This added a lot more character but the real kicker was the seasoning! instead of adding a bunch of random stuff, i used a Mccormic white chicken chili packet. just threw it in there, but to keep it from tasting chili like i added some jarred salsa and it freshened it right up. This is absolutely delicious! i served with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and fritos :)

With some extra seasoning this is one of my favorite recipes! I can make this and eat on it for a few days for lunches at work. I use one can of chicken broth and 1 chicken bouillon cube (adding about 3/4 c water). I prefer the petite cut tomatoes with jalapenos. Many times I'll add some diced onion. I always add red cayenne pepper and cumin for some extra flavor. Such a simple and excellent recipe. I'm sure I'll make it forever!

Quick, easy, delicious!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it does need a bit of seasoning to it to really make it delish.  I add a bit of cumin, chili powder and dried cilantro to finish it off. Yum!

I  thought it was very bland as is.  I love spicy foods, so was expecting more.  I had to liberally add spices suggested by other reviewers.  Once I did that, it was worth 4 stars!

As others have suggested this was a really great base. Turned out really yummy with green peppers and onions, rotisserie chicken, cumin, chili powder, thyme, salsa, lime zest and lime juice and garnished with tortilla chips, shredded cheese and a little sour cream.  Next time I'd like to try it with some cilantro as well!

This was very good. I thought I had all the ingrediants and then figured out I only had plain diced tomatoes and no black beans. I chopped up some fresh jalapenos and put rice in it instead and it turned out great. I also love to put fresh avacado and mozzeralla on top before serving. You can substitute anything I think in this and it would turn out great.

Great base!  I added lots of garlic salt (my favorite), cilantro, onion powder, oregano, a mix of pinto and white beans in addition to the black beans, paprika, a little cayenne pepper, and a can of prepared salsa.  Served over tortilla chips with cheese and sour cream, it was supreme!

We loved this! Easy and customizable. We used garbanzo beans, kidney beans, and black beans, as well as the corn. I only had diced tomatoes so to add spice I sprinkled the soup with Tony Chachere (which contains garlic, salt, red pepper) until the heat was to our liking. I also used 1 can of chicken broth and 1 can of condensed cream of chicken. Boiled a million (6-7) chicken breasts until done, and reserved some water for the soup bc the broth wasn't enough. Drained all other cans.

Amazing flavor, and extremely quick and easy to make.  I was a little skeptical about the recipe - I thought that I would be adding some adding some seasonings or extra ingredients to amp up the flavor.  But when I tasted the soup, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn't need to add a thing.  Fantstic flavor and color.  I did use fresh chicken, but otherwise remained true to the original recipe.

We went to two stores to get a rotisserie chicken, but both places were out, so I sucked it up and used canned chicken.  It was actually really good with the canned chicken.  This marks the first time I've ever been able to stomach canned chicken.  I actually couldn't stop eating this soup- it was so good.  All of the family loved it, too.  I actually used a quart of canned tomatoes and two cans of diced green chiles instead of the rotel, so that's about 4 times as much rotel as the recipe calls for.  I also drained the beans and corn.  For people who want to thicken this up, masa harina works very well as a thickener and the taste is perfect with this.  We topped with cheddar chese, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips, but it's really good plain too.

Excellent!!!  I prepared it exactly according to the recipe and my whole family, kids included, enjoyed this soup.  The best part is that it took next to no time to prepare.  Tortilla chips and shredded cheese on top is a must!

The family absolutely loved this recipe!! We will certainly be making this again. I somehow made it thicker than the recipe called for but it worked out just as good because we ate it with chips and added sour cream. Very yummy. Mmm

great recipe as is but I've always had trouble following directions :) I did drain my black beans and I used a 14 1/2 oz can of del monte diced fire roasted tomatoes with zesty jalapeno. I grilled 2 thin cut chicken breast filets on the Forman then shredded and added to soup instead of canned chicken, it's what I had on hand. Also added some smokey mesquite seasoning and some chili powder to the entire pot of soup. I like it a little hotter so I added a few drops of hot sauce to my bowl along with some sour cream and a few sweet chili tortilla chips. took some into my boss, I'm getting a raise. that's some good eatin!

Delicious! I took other reviewers advice and added cumin and chili powder, and that is what made this recipe! I tried it before adding the spices and it was a little bland. I also added some cooked rotini pasta, which worked out really well!

Went with two cans of cream soup as suggested.  Added cumin and chili powder as well.  This was terrific.  Toasted up tortilla strips and served with sour cream as well. I also used one boneless/skinless chicken breast instead of canned chicken.  Which I would consider if I had been to Costco recently as their brand rocks.  
Will definitely be making this again.

I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful and spicy the soup turned out. After reading the reviews regarding flavor, I tried a different cooking method. I dumped everything into the crock pot and cooked it on low for a couple of hours. It allowed the flavors to really soak in and develop. No extra spices were needed! I used the Rotel tomatoes with green chiles and lime, Trappey's Black Beans seasoned with olive oil, garlic, and onions and an extra can of chicken. Nothing was drained or rinsed. All of the flavors came out perfectly! Might add rice to it next time.

Very good and easy! I did however change it a bit. I also used cream of chicken and chicken broth as I prefer a creamier texture and used cooked chicken from the store. It was delicious!

Love this one! It's bone simple. I tend to go more the chili route. I replace the broth with a second can of tomatoes and substitute creamed corn for the drained kernels. I add 1/2 cup chili powder, 1 table spoon garlic salt and a few shakes of cayenne. Finished in less than 10 minutes and makes meals for days!

This was delicious and super easy.  I adjusted it a little to suit my tastes by adding a can of cream of chicken soup, a can of fiesta cheese soup, sauteed onions, oregano, garlic salt and cumin.  I served with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips.  Delicious!

Delicious! Add these seasonings: Cumin, Chili Powder, & Garlic to taste, as well as salt & pepper!  I tried this and took the advice from the review by SSCHULTE14 and used 1 can chicken broth & 1 can cream of chicken (instead of 2 cans of broth) and added the Cumin, Chili Powder & Garlic Powder seasoning - not being shy with the seasoning as SSCHULTE14 suggested!   Substitutions I made:  No Cilantro, so I used the Lime Juice and Cilantro flavored Rotel.   I used cooked chicken breast in place of canned chicken. Just boil or bake chicken and then shread with a fork.   MY HUSBAND ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS!!!!!!!  This is a FAVORITE recipe now, and I just discovered it a couple of weeks ago & have already made it 3 times!   You will want to DOUBLE this recipe!

This recipe is a great starter to awesome Chicken Tortilla soup, but it doesn't have any spice. This recipe is also very, very similar to Slow Cooker CHicken Tortilla soup from this site. That recipe actually comes out better because it has more ingredients to make it just a tad bit spicy. I'll admit that I don't make either on of these like the recipe. I make homemade green enchilada sauce and use home made chicken stock along with shredded chicken.

Super easy, super quick recipe. Great taste. I read the reviews and I used 2 cups of chicken broth, one can of condensed cream of chicken soup, fresh chicken boiled then shredded. I also added cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, a packet of Sazon seasoning for spice. Muy Beuno!

This was a great, quick soup, I used one cream of chicken and one chicken broth and drained one can of corn because we like our soup a little thicker.  I also added a can of green chilies and some cumin for extra flavor.

This was a wonderful start, but being from the south, we needed the extra spice. LOVED the additions from previous users, added cumin, garlic, onion, chili powder, and rinse the beans. Wonderful!

We used fresh cooked chicken and instead of 2 cans of chicken broth we used a can of cream of chicken soup with only one can of chicken broth.  We also added diced green chiles and the tomatoes we used had onions. Also, we added extra spice as others suggested.

I used leftover cooked chicken, a box of chicken stock, and I didn't drain my tomatoes.  This was a big hit with my husband, who immediately asked me to make it again soon.  Also, I am on Weight Watchers, and this recipe is VERY point friendly.

This was good.  I made it with the canned chicken and everyone loved it.  Next time I think I'll make it with rotisserie chicken.  I did drain the black beans though so that the soup wouldn't be grayish.

Delicious!!!  The whole family loved it! I used fresh, shredded chicken and homemade broth rather than canned, but all other ingredients were the same.  The seasoning in the broth, along with the chiles in the tomatoes, add just the right seasoning.  Will make this often!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe! The picky husband who thinks  he's too good to eat canned foods never turns down a bowl if this. Gets 5 stars not only for taste, but ease of preparation and versatility. Used fresh chicken with the skin, (didn't have canned today) boiled it down to make the broth, removed the fat and shredded it prior to adding other ingredients. Stirred in half a pack of taco mix left over from another recipe in place of canned broth. so it wouldn't turn out too salty. Can't go wrong with this one!

Very good! Very simple. I added 1 Tbsp of Adobo seasoning and 1 oz. of Powdered Ranch Dressing. I also cooked my own chicken. We will definitely make it again. Probably with cornbread next time

We make this soup about once per week now.  It's super easy and hits the spot.  I use one can of tomatoes with regular chiles and one can with habaneros.  It adds a ton more spice, if you like that sort of thing.  :)

Are you kidding me?  I can't believe how good this was from just using cans.  Well I'm hooked.    Like others suggested, I used one can of cream of chicken soup along with the chicken broth, and of course I added cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder.  Good stuff though.

This is a great jumping off point for a potentially delicious soup. To kick it up a notch, I use 1-2 cut up cooked chicken breasts seasoned to taste instead of canned chicken. I also add chopped peppers and onions (usually pan seared); I season to taste with pepper, chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic, cumin and fresh cilantro (usually I add this just before serving so it still has it's fresh, crisp taste).

I added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and half the amount of chicken broth to make it creamier. I also added some leftover rice as well. This was a hit with the entire family!!!

Very easy and wonderful flavor. I had some chicken breasts in the fridge that I used instead of canned chicken. I took many of the suggestions listed and subbed one can of broth for one of cream of chicken soup. I also used Rotel with lime and cilantro for the tomatoes. I added cumin, chili powder, garlic, pepper, and taco seasoning to spice it up a little. I threw everything into a crock pot and my fiance thought it was delicious!

Wow wow wow! This gets top the top rating for easy, affordable, and great taste. Some reviewers loved the flavor as-is and others thought it bland. I took the advice of one who used taco seasoning. I added about 1-1/2 tbs and the flavor was awesome. I had a leftover rotisserie chicken so I pulled the meat to use in the soup. Wouldn't change a thing!

This soup was easy and delicious! As a mom of a 2-yr-old who won't eat anything except mac n cheese, I was looking for something easy that she would eat.  She took one bite and said "good stuff." I made it exactly like the recipe said. Thank you for this wonderfully easy recipe!

Pretty good.  It's fairly bland so I added a few spices and cayenne pepper to try to "spice" it up.

This is a good base recipe. Like others have said, it's a bit bland so I add a pack of taco seasoning. For meat, I use ground or shredded chicken/turkey...or even ground beef (the latter with beef broth). This soup - and its variations - is a favorite in my household. Some peeps add shredded cheese and/or sour cream, but it's tasty even without.

It's okay soup.  Not bad - but not great either.  I did read reviews and added a can of cream of chicken soup to make the soup thicker.  I also used my immersion blender to make the soup creamier.  Will probably try some other chicken tortilla soup recipes on this site instead of making this again.

You can't get an easier recipe than this one.  I read a bunch of the reviews and incorporated alot of suggestions into my finished dish.  I used cooked chicken, not canned.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup to the soup ingredients to thicken up the soup.  Next, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and the juice of one lime were added to the soup.  Toppings included sliced avocado, a dollop of sour cream, and some crushed tortilla chips.   (Oh, and a splash of Sriracha Sauce for added "heat".)  I cooked this in a crockpot on LOW for 5 hours.  I'm giving it 4 star based on my "tweaks".  I'm thinking the soup would be bland if made just as written.

I followed the directions with the following changes. I cut the amount of broth in half, added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, sauteed and then cut up chicken breasts (instead of canned chicken, the first time I made it was with canned chicken and the chicken tasted bland) I didn't drain the corn, and I added some salsa (about 1/2 a cup), half a package of taco seasoning and cumin. AMAZING.

I was looking for something to cook and didn't want to go to the store. I found this, what I call, pantry soup! It was fantastic! The kids ate it, my husband loved it! It is now a family favorite that I cook every couple of weeks! Especially during the winter! Thanks!!!

It took me a while to get there, but this is definitely a Five Star. This is what I did after reading several reviews.  I threw everything in the crock pot making these changes: I used one frozen chicken breast, a can of rotell for the tomatoes and one can of reduced fat cream of chicken soup.  I cooked it on low for 4 hrs.  It was really really good, but to spicey for my little ones. So... I ended up doubling the recipe adding a can of regular tomatoes instead of the rotell.  It is so good!  I served it with crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheese.  Bonus-Now I have enough to freeze for another time!

The only change that I recommend is using chicken breasts, boiled with seasonings and then shredded (or use a rotisserie chicken from the store). Great basic soup, makes enough for several adults. The toppings really are what make this great. I serve mine with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled tortilla chips.

This is a great, fast, and easy recipe.  I do make some modifications, per my husband's and my tastes and other reviewer's suggestions:  1 large and 1 small can of chicken breast (who says canned chicken isn't any good?  I think it's great,) 1/2 can tomatoes with green chilis (since my husband isn't crazy about tomatoes), 1 can chicken broth and 2 cans cream of chicken soup.  The rest I leave the same.  I dump everything in a crock pot, adding some spices like garlic powder and chili powder, and let it go for a couple hours to let the flavors blend together.  It is delish!  I made it for some friends of ours for a weekend lunch and we barely had any left by the end of the afternoon.

I prepared the recipe as instructed, but found it to be quite bland.  To remedy this, I added a packet of low-sodium taco seasoning with some extra cracked pepper and WOW, what a difference!  It's perfect!  I did use the canned chicken, but thought it a little oddly-textured, so I'll probably use leftover chicken, shredded or cubed, next time.  Thank you!

Sooo easy and delicious. Did make a few changes to add flavor and consistency: Replaced one can of broth with a can of cream of chkn soup to thicken. Definitely needs chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and onion powder. Also- rinse black beans well to avoid weird grey color. Top soup with diced avocado, lots of shredded cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Next time will try using rotisserie chiken instead of canned to add more flavor.

Great! The five stars came from--everything was in my pantry already. It was a great soup that was quick when I was having a friend coming over and working late that day. Like others, I added 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of chili powder, one clove of garlic. I also did not rinse the black beans, but I thought it gave it a great taste. Serve with chips, sour cream and cheese.

Something very good came from these six cans. I really liked it with a spoon of sour cream added to it. Simple, quick, and good.

Not bad at all for a soup that takes only canned ingredients. I added some minced garlic and chile powder along with a pinch of ground cumin and a dash of salt. Yummy.

I modified this a bit since I like a bit of creaminess to my soups. From another review, I only used 1 can of chicken broth (reduced sodium) & I added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. I also added cumin, paprika, chili powder & garlic powder. I simmer it all on low for about an hour to really blend it all together. Made this way it was awesome! Best torilla soup (and the easiest) I've ever had. Everyone loves it. Thanks for the keeper!

11-9-2017 I needed to use up some cans from my pantry. I used only 1 can of chicken broth and added a can of cream of mushroom soup. This time I added some taco seasoning. Both the cream soup and the taco seasoning improved the taste.   10-9-2009 Didn't do anything for my family.  Not a fan of black beans.   Too thin.

I really wanted to like this one.  The only complaint that I have is that it is just too salty.  I don't usually cook with salt, however, I am not on a salt restricted diet.  It is a good recipe for some, however, if you don't care for salty food, you might better stay away from this recipe.

So easy, delicious, and easily modified to our tastes-- added cumin and oregano, rinsed the beans to cut down on the murkiness of the soup, used frozen corn instead of canned.  A great starting point!

I make a similar version of this by using my crockpot.  I put three or four skinless chickent breasts in first, then can of chicken broth, jar of medium salsa, can of corn (drained), can of black beans (drained)and can of fat free refried beans. Sprinkle in some chili powder, cayenne pepper and cumin.  Cook on low for 6 hours; pull chicken out and shredd and put back in for one more hour on low.  Hearty and healthy.  Freezes well too. Not six cans since I use fresh chicken, but close!

I've made this for along time and it's always a hit in our house. I usually use fresh chicken and cook it like taco meat with taco seasoning before I add it to the crock pot to simmer all day. The house smells great by dinner time. Oh and the grocery store regularly has the ingredients on sale so I always stock up and have it ready to go anytime.

This was fabulous!!!!  I used suggestions from previous reviewers and it turned out perfect!  I added the following to the recipe: 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 fresh tablespoon of cilantro, 1 heaping teaspoon of cumin and 1 heaping teaspoon of chili powder. This soup is SOOOOOOOO good!!!!  It's great with tortilla chips or regular flour tortillas.

This is a perfect soup for a large crowd! I had 25 people to feed and tripled the recipe. They ate it all and many asked for the recipe. As suggested I used rotisserie chicken, it was cheaper than chunk canned chicken for the amount I needed, and then spiced things up with chili, cumin and a bit of cilantro. I served with white tortilla chips, sour cream and grated cheddar cheese. It's a winner recipe!

I was told that this was the best soup that I had ever made by my husband! 1 can or chicken broth, 2 cans of Cream of Chicken, 1 can of tomatoes w/ chilies, 1 can Corn and one can of black beans. I started out by cooking up some onions and garlic in a little olive oil. Then added all the cans together in the pot. Added cayenne pepper, cumin, pepper, chili powder and paprika to taste. Simmer these together for about a 1/2 hour for more flavor. Finally, I had some left over spicy grilled chicken that I threw in while the soup was on a super low setting. Then, let the ingredients come together for another 15 minutes and then serve. This made the chicken super moist and totally not overcooked! Fantastic!

I usually do not review recipes but I loved how easy this was and how great it tasted.  I drained the corn, chicken (& rinsed), beans, and tomatoes.  I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can condensed cheese soup, and about 1/2 can chicken broth (for consistency).  I also added chili powder and cumin per suggestions. I poured everything into the crock pot and left in on low for a couple hours. Then chopped up green onions to mix into my portion and shredded cheddar on top.  Ate most with chips. So easy!

Great Recipe!  I have passed this on to many girlfriends who use it for gatherings at their house all the time.  I always keep the ingredients at our summer cabin for a quick meal too.  The only thing different I do is use a jar of Southwest salsa instead of a can on tomatoes it provides some of the additional seasoning others have suggested.

Super easy and tasty! But if my addition is correct, the calorie count is *WAY* overstated (unless it includes the chips and cheese) - which is actually a good thing.

This was super good!! I changed just a few things to suit our tastes. First, I poached 3 chicken breasts in chicken broth, minced garlic, salt and pepper; shredded and set aside. When I was ready to make the soup I sauteed 1 small onion and 2 tablespoons of minced garlic in the bottom of my pot. Threw in the chicken and the rest of the ingredients (I replaced one can of chicken broth with one can of cream of chicken soup), a handful of rice and 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning. Served with shredded cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips.

This soup is wonderful and so very easy! The only thing is my husband said next time to add more chicken broth because he likes to crumble cornbread up into his soup.  We added crushed up tortilla chips and cheese.  Next time will use pepperjack. That would give it a nice kick!

This is so easy, and tastes good, too!  I only had plain tomatoes, none with green chiles, so I improvised.  I used only one can of chicken broth and added about 1/2 cup medium taco sauce. I cooked my own chicken, using two cooked, shredded chicken breasts.  This will be added to my list of easy and quick dinners!

Fantastically easy & great recipe!  I did make a few changes which helped a lot: I used 1 can chicken broth and 1 cam reduced fat cr. of chicken soup, which gave a great consitency.  I also used the Rotel tomoatoes w/lime & cilantro, bought seasoned black beans but rinsed them and I cooked 2 chicken breasts in the soup for 1/2 hour and shredded them.  I also added cumin & garlic powder.  It really doesn't get any easier!  My husband's only complaint was that it was missing salt.  I didn't add it to the soup b/c of what other reviewers said about the chips making it salty.

this was SOOOO good. Make sure when making your shopping list you include cheese and torilla shells or chips. I just used listed ingrediants and had to go back to get the rest! Silly me! i was making it for servings for 1 so i didnt follow directions exactly and i ended up putiing to much tomatos with chili, so it was really spicy. the only thing i didnt like was that it doesnt look that good (the soup looked blackish)

I, too, adore this recipe...it is a perfect last-minute low-maintenence dinner as you can ALWAYS have everything on hand and ready to go.  Who doesn't keep frozen chicken breasts in their freezer?  After reading many reviews and tinkering with this recipe for a year or so, I think I have perfected my family's preference.  I use one shredded chicken breast in place of canned, Mexi-corn instead of regular, 1 can of chicken broth, 1 can of cream of chicken, and 1 can of Campbell's Select Chicken Tortilla Soup.  I also season a little with cilantro, cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder.  And I garnish with whatever we have at the moment, but our favorite is strips of tortilla shells, some shredded cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.  If we don't have tortillas, we probably at least have tortilla chips so we'll crush those up as a substitute.  YUM!!

Great recipe with a few modifications. I only used one 14.5 ounce can of chicken broth, and one can of condensed chicken soup (did not add water). Also, instead of canned chicken, I shredded some leftover rotisserie chicken. Also make sure to rinse the black beans really well or the soup will turn grey. To add some flavor, I added chopped jalapenos, cilantro, shredded cheese, then topped with sour cream. Hands down the easiest and one of the best tasting soups I've ever made!

We add a packet of taco seasoning and a can of red beans to this as well and it makes it pop even more. Can also add a jar of chipotle salsa to make it even better.

Economical and tasty! I took a few of the suggestions into account, and added about 1 tbsp of cumin, 2 tbsp of chopped cilantro, 1 tbsp of chili powder, and a tsp of garlic powder. Oh, make sure you rinse the beans really well so your soup doesn't turn gray! Instead of canned chicken, I used precut, precooked chicken (It was on sale for 79 cents for 10 oz due to the fact it had to be sold the next day). Also, I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup, and 1 can of broth, as opposed to the two cans of broth. I topped it all off with Mexican style shredded cheese. With these changes and additions, this soup is amazing! Even my stepmother raved and asked for the recipe. Thank you!

We really enjoy this recipe!  I use 3/4 of a rotisserie chicken instead of the canned.  We like more meat.  Also, I add a can of kidney beans.  Great leftovers!

This was pretty good, but you definitely need to season it to your liking. I added a healthy amount of cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder. I also cooked and shredded 2 chicken breasts instead of using canned (yuck). The only other thing I did was to drain the black beans, as I didn't want the soup to turn grey. I threw all of this in the slow cooker for about 6 hours... very easy and pretty good.

I made this recipe last night. All I can say is YUMMY! My picky kids, toddler and hubby LOVED it! 

I used the correct base ingredients except for canned chicken and canned corn (I'm not a canned veggie user). I did season and spice it up as the other reviews advised. I added some cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cilantro, black pepper, a little sea salt and a small dash of cayenne pepper. I also added a half a jar of thick and chunky salsa and an ounce of low-fat cream cheese and a small handful of Kraft cheddar crumbles just to thicken the sauce a bit. I also added extra beans. I had some pinto beans that I needed to use so I rinsed and dumped those in. 

I served it with low-fat sour cream, shredded cheddar and Tostino's Natural Organic corn tortilla chips. I suggest the organic chips. They have a wonderful flavor! The regular chips taste like salt and grease, not the organics! The corn flavor comes through and there is not salty, greasy taste. Use the organics with this soup! This recipe could also, very easily, be turned into a vegetarian soup or you could add some ground beef. The possiblilities are endless with this recipe! 

This is a keeper in my house and I will definately use this as a 'company' recipe. It's not expensive, tastes great and you can easily make a ton. Plus there's only one dish to wash!

I made this recipe exactly as written - I even found all the cans in the same sizes - we must shop at the same store. (The chicken broth was "99% fat free", but isn't this usually more or less the case?) This dish turned out to be pretty tasty - my first impression was a 4-star rating. I don't know if it was the reheating or what, but leftovers the next day weren't quite as good.
However, I think that the suggestions in the recipe introduction, about the tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese, are "musts"; they added a lot to the dish. I thought the "serve over tortilla chips" idea sounded a little strange, but it worked well - just don't use too many, or you'll have a bunch of corn mush at the bottom of the soup bowl.

Made this soup several times, definite keeper. Like some of the other reviews, I use chicken breast (2-3 depending on size) sprinkle with garlic powder & smoked paprika then cook in olive oil & shred when done. I also cut up a few potatoes and add to soup. Add smoked paprika for more flavor. Serve with cheese, tortilla chips and sour cream, you have yourself a great meal. :-)

I gave this four stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. My husband and I thought it was okay as is, but excellent with our changes. First, I substituted one can of chicken broth for cream of chicken soup, as many of the reviews suggested. Second, I added a medium-sized jar of mild salsa (or homemade if you have it) and that is what really brought the whole thing together. Third, we grill our own chicken or use leftovers from the night before. Fourth, chop up a zucchini and let it simmer until cooked through. The spiciness was definitely perfect and there was just enough of everything. Addition of the zucchini makes it super filling! This is a weekly staple at our house now. Thanks so much!

I'd give this recipe 4.5 stars because it is really easy, really fast.  With some tweaking, it is easily a 5 star recipe that the hubby actually LOVES (he actually requests this soup, and he NEVER requests anything else but heavy italian pasta dishes!).  If you can swing it, use leftover shredded chicken instead of the canned, although the canned is OK in a pinch (I use grilled chicken breasts with a bit of southwest grill seasoning). To make the soup a bit thicker, I used creamed corn instead of plain canned corn, and added 1 C. finely crushed white corn tortilla chips.  I skipped the taco seasoning that others have suggested and simply added 1/2 tsp. cumin.  Simmer the pot for 15 to 20 minutes and the corn chips act like flour to thicken the soup.  Serve topped with shredded cheddar or mexican blend cheese.  WOW!!  Hubby has already asked that I prepare a triple batch for him to share with the guys during deer season, instead of chili.  Thanks for the recipe - definitely a keeper and has been added to my monthly rotation!

This is a great starter recipe.  I was craving tortilla soup but did not feel like driving to a resturant to get it.  Instead of canned chicken [which has way too many perservatives], I purchase a whole baked chicked from the store and shredded it for the soup.  I also added some other spices. Very easy recipe.

I used leftover turkey instead of canned chicken.  This soup was easy but not very impressive.  Something was missing.  If I make it again, I will add masa for texture, onions, green peppers,avocado, sour cream and mont-jack cheese.  I buy a starter tortilla soup mix that is much better.  Sorry.

I made the following changes as suggested by others - Ranch-style beans (undrained) in place of black beans; used roasted chicken in place of the canned; I also added 1/2 can chopped green chili peppers, 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. chili powder and 1/2 tsp. cumin.  I also chopped up some avocados and served on top with the cheese.  It turned out excellent and even my picky teenager wanted seconds.  It sure makes for a quick and easy dinner.

Very good!!!  One of the best things about this recipe is how easy it is.  I used chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken, much, much better in my opinion.  Only thing I would change would be to add SPICE to this recipe to make it a little more flavorful & spicey.  Other than that, this recipe is great.

The only changes I made to the recipe were to add a packet of low-sodium taco seasoning and a can of drained and rinsed black-eye peas.  I also used the pouches of chicken, rather than canned.  I did drain and rinse the black beans.  This was really tasty and low-fat.  I'll make it again.

I was so happy to find this!  I add a package of taco seasonings, and it was just right.  I did follow the advice from others to be sure and drain and rinse the black beans before adding into the pot.  I served with sour cream, shredded cheddar, and tortilla chips on the side.  **If you don't want it very spicy, I'd start with half of a package of taco seasonings first.

This gets a five-star rating just because it's SO easy to make--not to mention it really is delicious!  I doubled all the ingredients except only used one can each of chicken broth and cream of chicken soup so it'd be thick & hearty.  Per other reviews, I added an entire pack of taco seasoning. I also served it with chopped cilantro, sour cream, tostido chips, and shredded cheese. YUM!!

This soup was really good!  I gave it 4 stars because I did use some of the extras suggested.  I used the chicken from a small whole chicken  (store roasted, added 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning and topped it off with shredded cheese, sour cream, a few pieces of chopped green onions and a couple tortilla chips.  Thanks so much for this recipe and to everyone for the suggestions.  Definitely add the sour cream, cheese and green onions, it really adds alot.  Thanks again!

Oh my, was this good!  I had my doubts because all of the ingredients were canned - but I was proved wrong.  I used 1 can of chicken broth & 1 can of cream of chicken soup like some other reviewers.  I also used the Rotel tomatoes with chiles, lime, and cilantro - as another reviewer did.  I added some chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and Franks Red Hot sauce as well.  This is a new family favorite!  Even my 5 and 6 year old gobbled every bit of it up!

Very tasty, my family loved it. I did make some changes. I added some minced onion and cumin to taste then added about a 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of instant brown rice which soaked up alot of the liquid so I added another can of chicken broth. It turned out wonderful! Next time I will take others advice and use a rotisserie chicken instead of canned chicken. I will definately make this again.

This is really good. I followed the crowd and used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of one of the cans of chicken broth.  Also added about 1/3 packet of taco seasoning for some kick. 
Dinner is in an hour--I have taken so many tastes out of the pot, I am not hungry anymore.  Really good and reallllly easy.

looks good, but where are the tortillas?
I would suggest cutting a flour tortilla in thin strips (with a pizza cutter) and toasting them until crisp.
Sprinkle on top of soup before serving.

Taste great, but not a pretty recipe. I give it 5-stars for taste, but gave it four hear for the color. The black beans in this recipe cause the broth to become a dark color. Don't let it fool you though... This recipe tastes great! My family really enjoyed this for dinner on a cold rainy night. We used "My Nana's" tortilla strips on top with a dollop of sour cream and some shredded Mexican style cheese. Yum! This recipe will be used again in our house!

This is excellent with sliced avocado, jack cheese and crushed tortilla chips on top. Be sure to rinse the beans! I used two diced poached chicken breasts in place of the canned stuff. I also added 1/4 tsp. chili powder and 1/2 tsp. cumin. This will go in our regular dinner rotation from now on.

Absolutely amazing.  I did use fresh chicken, as meat from a can creeps me out.  And I did add chili powder and half packet of taco seasoning.  Crushed chips, cheese and sour cream on top...my boyfriend yelled from the dining room as soon as he took his first bite "This is awesome!!"

I have been using this basic recipe for years.  It is a snap to make in the crock pot!  As you can see from all of the different suggestions in the reviews, you can modify it depending on your tastes and what you have on hand.  I think it is a must to rinse and drain black beans well otherwise you get the odd color mentioned in the reviews.  Sometimes I like to use pinto beans instead.  Whenever I have leftover grilled or roasted chicken, I cut it into bite sized pieces and freeze for later to use for this recipe.

My family and I enjoyed this version of tortilla soup.  My 5 year old daughter loved it too.  I would make it again, and I would recommend it as is.  Next time, I will use canned Chicken Breast instead of canned chicken that includes dark and white meat.  Or, I will go to Walmart to buy the cooked Rotessire chicken for less than $4 to shred into the soup.

I cannot tell you how many times I have made this in the past year.  It is a staple at my house.  So easy and so delicious.  Like several of the other reviewers, I also add a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, and use fresh chicken.  Pinto beans work great, too, in lieu of black beans.  We always have a "topping station"  so folks can help themselves to tortilla chips, cheese, sour cream, green onions and fresh cilantro.  Yum!

This was really good, especially with a little spicing up. I used a can of Fiesta corn instead of plain, and seasoned the soup with chili powder and a little garlic and onion salt. Next time I will probably use the hot rotel instead of regular...but there will definitely be a next time. Sour cream, shredded cheddar and crushed tortilla chips really make it great.
UPDATE: Changing this to a 5. Used low sodium ingredients, and only had to use a little chili powder to spice it up this time. Also, I like to take my hand mixer and run it through the soup to shred the canned chicken a little more. This is a great recipe, so simple and tasty.

To make this a vegetarian recipe, I substituted a can of cut green beans (sticking with the canned vegetable theme) for the chunk chicken and vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  I added 1 t cumin and a sprinkling of garlic powder, included the tortilla chip and cheese recommendation, and this turned out to be such a pleasing and easy recipe.

So easy and delicious!  Adding crumbled blue corn chips to the bowl before the soup and some grated cheese to the top make this a favorite with our family.  And best of all, my husband can cook it!  Thanks, Terry!

This was so easy and so good! We were craving tortilla soup, but needed a quick dinner, so I didn't want to tackle a longer ingredient list. I think the tomatoes with green chiles that we bought were pretty spicy, because the soup turned out spicier than I thought it would, and I didn't have to add any spice. I did add just a bit of corn starch to thicken it. We topped it with cheddar cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips, and even my 8 year old ate two bowls!

I had to review this again because I cooked it in the crockpot for 6 hours so that I could cook the chicken too - I used two boneless breasts.  It turned out great!  I threw in some cumin and chilli powder, and also some tiny pasta for the last 30 minutes.

We loved this!  I couldn't believe the canned chicken turned out so well in this soup.  I made just a few modifications- I sliced up some green onions for color and sauteed them for a few minutes in olive oil and garlic.  I also added fresh ground black pepper and some cumin. Then I added everything else and simmered.  I refrigerated it overnight to let the flavors blend, and served it the next night.  Instead of the tortilla chips, my husband cut some flour tortillas into stips, seasoned them, and baked on a cookie sheet until lightly browned.  Soup was delicious with the tortilla strips, sour cream and shredded cheddar. I'll try some pepper jack and a couple of dashes of Tobasco next time.  Thanks for a recipe that is so quick and easy for a busy working mom!

This soup was a huge hit with my DH and DS but not my 3 yr old DD (read picky eater). I left the beans out and added southwest chicken strips instead of canned. We crumbled chips on top then added sour cream, shredded cheese and chopped avocado. Served with quesadillas on the side this has became a new family favorite. We plan to make this often and share the recipe too!

I really liked this recipe.  Yes, fresh chicken would have been better but the canned did good in a pinch.  Hubby wasn't too impressed with the flavor.  He said it was bland.  Next time, I will use HOT Rotel instead of mild, I guess.  I should have rinsed the beans, but recipe doesn't even call for draining them.  

My additions to this recipe were; saffron rice,  fresh avacado (chopped with fresh lime juice), (just a touch of) fresh cilatro, fresh chopped green onions and shreaded Monterey Jack cheese.  I topped already dished out soup with the above for an attractive dish.

I'm not sure what happened with this recipe. It came out the color of dirty dishwater, which probably affected my opinion. I also accidentally bought the "extra hot" tomatoes with green chiles and this made it extremely spicy (and I like spicy foods). Otherwise, I liked the addition of corn, but thought the recipe needed more tomato flavor. Also, I highly recommend using freshly cooked chicken instead of canned.

Super quick and easy! My suggestions: Add 1 can cream of chicken soup (if you like it thicker, replace one of the cans of broth). Try Rotel's "Chili Fixins", it's diced tomatoes, chilis, and a chili powder seasoning. Also, instead of black beans, use a can of Del Monte Savory Sensations "Rio Grande Vegetables". It's Pinto beans, tomatoes, corn, green chilis in a spicy sauce. Served this over the chips with shredded cheddar cheese, fresh tomatoes, avacado, and sour cream. Yum. Yum.

Great and SIMPLE recipe!  How could you go wrong? :)  I'd definitely make this again, but next time I'd use fresh chicken breast instead of canned and add 1/2 to 1 more can of chicken broth.  After it was cooked, I found that there was not enough soup and it became more of a stew than a soup. Yummy!

It was good, but not great.  I found a recipe for taco soup that you cook in the crockpot that is much better than this.  Anyhow, I am not going to use canned chicken again.  I will use just good old regular cooked chicken breast.  I would also add a package of taco seasoning.  I added garlic this last go around, and I think I will add alot more next time, since we love garlic in this house.  Thanks for the recipe.  Happy Holidays.

Thought it was pretty good, some of the reviewers say to add cilantro, think I'll add just a little bit less.Not use to using cilantro.
Question: Has anybody tried it with beef bullion and hambuger or some kind of beef cut?

Yum!  Thanks for a tasty and easy recipe!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and only used one can of broth, which for me, after adding chips and cheese didn't leave enough liquid.  Next time I will use both cans of broth per the recipe.  My can measurements also were a little larger than stated in the recipe, so that might have something to do with it, but my family really enjoyed this recipe.

I used fresh chicken breasts diced  and sauteed because I've never used canned chicken and was skeptical. I added the other ingredients , along with taco seasoning as others suggested as used Mexican 4 cheese blend (Kraft) instead of cheddar.  This was sensational and so simple and fast.

I doubled this and took it to a pot-luck dinner.  Everyone was raving about how good it was, and there wasn't a drop left.  I made a couple of changes: I used frozen corn, only 1 can of the diced tomatoes w/green chile (the can I bought was pretty spicy!), and sauteed some chicken tenders.  I used frozen chicken tenders - did you know you could just saute them while they're frozen? :)  Then I diced them into bite sized pieces.  The broken-up tortilla chips are a must as a topping.  I threw all the ingredients into my slow cooker for a few hours to blend the flavors....Delicious!

I changed this recipe a little because I don't eat chicken so I used veg broth instead and left out the chicken. I only used one can of broth because I like my soup thick, and then I cooked a cup of rice in the other can of broth, I used jasmine. I added the rice to the soup after it was cooked and then heated it a little more. I put some cheddar cheese on top and had a wonderful soup for dinner. I took some the next day for lunch but all the rice had soaked up the rest of the broth, so I had beans and rice insead of soup but it was delicious, I personally liked it much more than the soup, but I'm not a huge soup fan. Try the rice, it makes for amazing leftovers. And monterey jack cheese would be better than cheddar.

I had my doubts, but was pleasantly surprised. I modified it a bit according to what I had in the house (frozen corn & black eyed peas & even some leftover cheese tortellini were thrown in, also one can of tomato soup & one of chicken broth instead of 2). My husband didn't look too confident when I put it on the table. But wow! It was really good. It's a flavorful change of pace from the ordinary.

I love food with a Mexican flavor but my husband does not!  I was very excited to try this because it sounded good and looked so easy.  Everyone loved it, my husband AND three picky little boys.  We ate all of it.  That rarely happens with a recipe.  The boys thought it was fun to smash tortilla chips into their bowl, or scoop it with a chip rather than a spoon.  We will eat this regularly.

My husband loved this soup. He said that he never has ate soup that tasted this good. He ate all of the leftovers the next day. The only change I made was that I used Tyson frozen (precooked) chicken strips (Southwest flavor) and I added a little shredded cheese while it was cooking to make it a bit thicker.

YUM!!!!!!!!!  This soup is the best!  It was easy and delicious.  I did use one can of cream of chicken in place of one can of broth, but next time I will use all three cans of broth with the cream of chicken because there was not enough liquid.  I also added the cumin and cilantro, and used Trader Joe's cuban style black beans,as well as their frozen sweet corn.  Topped it with lime tortilla chips and Mexican cotija cheese.  The whole family loved it, even my picky ten year old.  You have to try this recipe!!!!!

SOOOO EASY!!! this tasted great, i added some spice to make it hotter (we like spicy). If you have left over chix you could throw in it this soup, but it tasted great with the canned chix ( i had never used canned chix), i would never go to the trouble of cooking chix just for this, though, cause it was great. i will be keeping ingredients on hand to make this all the time. (it's great left over too!)

As written, I thought this was a little bit bland, so I spiced it up quite a bit to suit our tastes.  With the spices, it gets five stars!  I added: dried minced onion, red pepper, jalapeno seasoning, garlic pepper, cajun seasoning, and a lot of cilantro.  I also used one can of cream soup as other reviewers suggested.  This soup came out so good that I couldn't wait, and burned my tongue eating it before it cooled off!  ;)

This recipe couldn't have been any easier.  Instead of canned chicken I used chicken breasts and just cooked them in the chicken broth with some added cumin and cilantro.  Then I chopped up the chicken tossed it back in, threw in the rest of the ingredients (along with an extra can of chicken stock) and let it heat through.

This was very easy, but also very GOOD! I added some fresh cilantro and green onions and I used fresh cooked chicken breast instead of the canned. I made it for guests and they loved it!

This was very easy, tasty and hearty.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of the taste of the canned chicken, which could have just been a brand thing.  I will make this again using fresh chicken boiled and then cut up because it is very flavorful and satisfying.

....just the right soup this side of the border! The only thing I added in addition to the main ingredients were a can of peas. My family loves them. This recipe also went over well for a crowd of sports fans on a warm Arizona winter day!

After eating a heaping bowl garnished with avocado, cilantro, cheddar cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips, my husband announced, "That was great!  We have to have that again."  I added fresh cilantro and about a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin to boost the flavor a bit.  I didn't have Rotel, so substituted a can of diced tomatoes and a can of diced green chiles.  This was a very hearty and delicious meal in a bowl.  I know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow!

UPDATE:  I substituted one can of cream of chicken soup for one can of broth and this added some dimension to this soup.

This was very easy and very good, with a few variations. I would recommend low-sodium soup, because it was very salty. It also needed red pepper flakes for some spice because it was kind of bland. With some sour cream and crushed tortilla chips, it was delicious. I'll be making it again!

This is now my husband's favorite soup. He likes things spicy so I changed it a bit. I added a can of jalapenos, 1/2 tsp. cumin, and 1 tsp. cilantro. Top with cheese. This soup is so fast and easy. I make it all the time. Great!!!!!

Great & soooo easy to make. I used 3 fresh chicken breasts sliced into thin strips & cooked for a few minutes in a bit of olive oil with 1 clove of garlic. Then added the cans, along with 1 can of diced green chiles & 1 can of cream of ckn in place of 1 ckn broth. Sprinkled on some cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. of cumin, and a few dashes of hot sauce. Served with tortilla chips for dipping and shredded monterey jack cheese. Delicious.

SUPER CHEAP & EASY TO MAKE!  If you can use a can opener, you can make this!  Only thing I did differently was not use the chicken in a can.  I buy chicken breasts by the bag and I keep them in the freezer.  I defrosted 2 pieces in the microwave a litte and then I boiled them until they were cooked through...set aside and let cool.  After the soup was ready, I tore apart the chicken and added it to the soup.  I garnished the soup with crushed tortilla chips, montery jack cheese, a dolop of sour cream and sliced avacado!  It was SO good!!!!!!!  I will make it again and again!

While shopping for the beans and tomatoes, I noticed that you could buy them with various spices,  jalapeños and other chiles.  That's what I did and this soup was to die for! The next night, I added more jalapeño laced black beans and chicken and it was eagerly received.  It makes a great, complete dinner.

This is a delicious soup and it was SO easy to prepare! I followed the recipe but added cumin, garlic powder and some dried onion. The soup was very salty so I'll use low sodium broth next time. I made baked corn torilla chips to serve with the soup. Delicioso! A definite keeper.

I was very skeptical about this recipe.  I had all the ingredients in my cabinets so I went ahead and made it.  It is very tasty and extremely easy.  I did let it boil a bit to reduce the liquid a bit more.  This is definitely a keeper for those nights we need a quick delicious meal.

MMMM!!!!  This soup is delicious!  I didn't change any of the ingredients this time, but I think I will follow one of the other reviews and use 1 can broth and 1 can cream of chicken because it was pretty watery.  Still wonderful, though :-)

I'm the soup maker at our house and my wife said this is the best soup ever.  I took the advise of others and used 1 can broth and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  I only used about 3/4 can of water.  I had diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano so I added 3 small hot peppers.  The next time I'll use the Rotel tomatoes.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.  My wife wants this again next week.  What can I say...I'm the man of the hour!!!

WOW! This is the most DELICIOUS thing I have ever made. I used one 9-oz. package of frozen grilled chicken strips in place of the canned chicken, and added 1/8 cup each of fresh cilantro and green onions, with a pinch of garlic and taco seasoning to taste. It was VERY spicy when first cooked, but by the second day in the fridge the flavors had really blended together. A dollop of sour cream cools it down nicely. I can't wait to cook this again - it was SO easy, and really yummy!

I made this for some friends last night, and even though I doubled the recipe I had NO leftovers!  I took the advice of some other reviews and sauteed some onions before adding all the ingredients - I got nothing but compliments thanks to you Terryn! Add some fresh baked cornbread and you have a complete, hearty meal.I will definitely be making this again!

This is a working mothers recipe!  I'm able to run home after work throw it on the stove and get the family fed within an hour.  To spice it up a bit I added some chopped onion and cilantro....it gives it an authentic taste.  I suggest keeping the ingredients in the pantry at all times!

OMG amazing!  I used the extra hot Rotel tomatoes and it added a great kick (note: probably too hot for kids and wimpy adults)! I also added some garlic and dried onion and julienned carrots.  Yummy!  I have a new favorite soup! I can't believe this is so delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I followed someone else's suggestion about using a can of cream of chicken and only one can of chicken broth.  I did not add water though, since I prefer a thicker soup.  The green chiles in the tomatoes made the soup a touch spicy but overall, this is a very easy and good recipe.

This was such a fantastic and easy recipe! It doesn't get much simpler than opening up some cans and heating it all up - and it really tasted great.  I also added some cumin and chili powder and that really gave it a nice kick. Also broke up some tortillas on top.  We will definitely make this recipe again.

Not a recipe that thrilled anyone at my house but an interesting change from the norm. Very simple to make. Will maybe make again for a Mexican potluck sometime.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make some slight changes - I started with a little sauted onions, used fresh chicken, added a little salid pasta, kept the juice in the canned tomatoes, and added some chile to give it an add'l kick.

I prepared this tonight with some minor adjustments. I added cumim, chile powder, garlic powder and cilantro. It was pretty good, but not at all what I expected after reading the rave reviews. Can't decide whether or not I'll make it again, although this would come in handy in a pinch. Didn't have tortilla chips, but had some flour tortillas which I sprayed with Pam and baked until crisp..which worked out well.

I made this recipe but I improvised just a little as well.  I followed the suggestion of adding cumin, I also added some oregano, onion flakes, salt and pepper and som red pepper flakes.  It was wonderful.  I unfortunately made it a little too spicy for the child so we just put a little sour cream in his bowl to take away the spiciness.

This was sooooo good. My picky eater boyfriend loved it! He chowed down and I only have about one cup of it left! I added cumin and used fresh chicken breasts. This tastes just like the pricey chicken tortilla soup you get at trendy LA restaurants. Thank you for such a quick and easy delicious dinner!

I loved this soup!!! I did use fresh chicken breast. I cubed it and then seasoned it with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon of cumin. Then sauted it in very little olive oil until the pink was out and then just added the other ingredients. I topped it with the cheese and served with the tortilla chips. Thanks Terryn!

I've made alot of chicken tortilla soups before but this is by far the easiest.  I did use regular chicken breasts and added the cumin like the earlier reviews.  It was great and such a breeze to make!  Thank you!

Very easy and very good.  I used kidney beans because I didn't have any black beans on hand.  I also added spices as recommended by others.  A good, filling soup with no guilt.  My kids were less than thrilled though, but did eat it.  They're the mac and cheese type.

Great recipe! I have shared this with many friends usually doubling the recipe (Twelve Can Chicken Tortilla Soup!) The only thing I did different was use reduced sodium chicken broth.

Great starting point! I love hominy more than corn, so substituted that. I bought a grocery store rotisserie chicken, doubled the recipe, added 2tsp cumin, 1tsp chili powder, and 2 cloves of garlic. Quick last-minute delicious gluten- free meal!

I just wanted to comment on the salt content. As one person noted, the chicken broth is a big offender when it comes to sodium. However, ALL of the ingredients are big offenders. These are all canned foods, and canned foods use salt as part of the preservation process. Every one of them has far more salt than necessary. If you want to cut it down, try using frozen corn, low sodium chicken broth, and cooking your own beans and chicken. On the bright side, it'll taste better. On the bad side, it'll take longer. Note-Black beans dodo not need to be soaked like most other dried beans.

SUPER easy and good. I would suggest adding your prefferred seasoning to give a touch of additional flavor. I also used fresh chicken that I cut into cubes and browned in skillet.

I made this soup on  New Years' eve for many reason.  The temperature now is 6 degress in northern IL and I have a head/chest cold that is kicking my butt so wanted something quick. I started with a few chicken breast and cooked them in water to cover and added 2 chicken bouillon cubes and small diced onion.  I shredded the chicken when done and added the drained corn, rinsed beans and undrained tomatoes. I added enough chicken broth to the desired consistency and then added chili powder, cumin and garlic powder to taste.  Unfortunately, I lost my taste buds too but my husband liked it. This is a good base recipes. If you like a creamier soup, add the condensed cream of chicken soup.

I have made this soup twice. 5 star just the way the recipe says.  I did rinse my black beans.  Since I had left over rotisserie chicken, I added it plus a can of chicken too.  Turned out  great.  Since I only cook for one and this makes a big pot, I froze leftovers in single serving freezer bags.  This soup freezes well and tastes just as great frozen as unfrozen.

I would agree with other people who say that this soup was good and easy. I made the recipe as it was written except that I added some seasoning. I added 1 teaspoon cumin,2 teaspoons of chili powder, and 1 teaspoon of garlic. When I served it I added a spoonful of sour cream and some shredded Mexican cheese blend to each bowl.I do plan to make it again.

I'm giving this a 5-star rating for ease only because I haven't tried it, yet,  but I would like to ask all reviewers who change a recipe to please not just say, add some cumin, chili powder, or whatever spice you think makes it better.  This is frustrating for inexperienced cooks such as myself.  Please tell how much of the additional spice to use (1 Tbsp vs. 1 tsp makes a difference)  Please help us out and give exact measurements if you are going to add something.  Thank you.

I can't see why combining six store-bought cans of ingredients and heating it up is called cooking. Buying just two large cans of Campbell's soup and heating it up would be cheaper and, Hey! I got soup! Meh.

This is my favorite soup in the world but (like everybody else on this website) I make changes to it.  Rotel is too sharp for our tastes.  So we use three cans of diced tomatoes and one can of green chilies.  We also put in a can of red beans, not just black ones.  I also put in two cans of chicken, not just one, and use a sack of taco seasoning and three Tbs of dry ranch dressing mix.  Is it still your soup?  Probably not.   It has lots more cans and it's just scrumptious.

I give this recipe to new brides at bridal showers.  (Could give the ingredients too!)  I bake corn tortillas in the oven at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes; then crumble into soup.  You can make queso to go on extra crispy tortillas by melting velveta cheese slices and either salsa or a few spoonfuls of chopped rotel tomatoes; melted in the microwave.  I usually add a little milk too.  Easy; quick, and pretty healthy!

I make this all the time. I've shared this recipe too many times to count. I use low sodium chicken broth (1 large box) and add a tablespoon or two of chicken bouillon to add to the flavor. It's always a hit. Bonus is it's quick & inexpensive to make.

This is my go to when I feel like having Mexican, but don't feel like slaving in the kitchen. Easy. The family loves it. Not a lot of dishes or prep work. Can't go wrong!

I just made this for a quick dinner tonight and it was fast and easy and very tasty. I added some cooked macaroni just because I was in the mood for a little pasta. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It's definitely a "keeper" and we'll be having it again. Makes a filling, warming dinner for a cold winter meal.

I have been making this for years. It's a quick and healthy weeknight staple that everyone loves. I have NEVER made it with the chunk chicken suggested. It's easy enough to cook fresh/frozen chicken breast, and a lot cheaper.  I do add plenty of chile powder and cumin, and I always double the recipe (using three chicken breasts) so we have leftovers for another meal. Of course, it's even better the second time around.

Great recipe to use up canned chicken.  Like others, I added the cream of chicken soup as well as some spice (oregano, cumin & chili powder...as well as some fresh cumin).  I had somewhat low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised!  Topped with some cheese, sliced black olives & a dollop of sour cream!  Will make again with roasted chicken when I use up my lingering cans of canned chicken!!!

Delicious and so easy! I used the modifications other reviewers suggested: replace 1 can of broth with condensed cream of chicken soup; add 1/4 tsp garlic powder, cumin and chili powder; add 1/4 c fresh cilantro. Next time I will use mild Rotel instead of original - I liked the spice but it was too much for my kids.

I have been making this forever! My friends and family think it is something special. I use a can of cream of chicken soup and only one chicken broth. Something about canned chicken is weird so I just chop up some chicken breast and finish it with taco seasoning before mixing it together. Just add cheese and sour cream and it's a hit everytime!!

I give it three stars because as written it is a bit bland, but it serves as a good base recipe for your own version with whatever you like to taste. I've made this recipe many times in different ways depending on what I have on hand. Right now I have it cooking in the crockpot with frozen chicken tenderloins, 3.5 cups chicken broth made with three chicken bouillon and water, a packet of taco seasoning, one can sweet corn (drained and rinsed), one can black beans (also drained and rinsed), one can diced tomatoes and about 1/8 cup diced frozen jalapeno from this summer's garden. I'll remove and shred the chicken when done, in about three hours on high. Give it a try!

This is so simple and really good.    I use less chicken broth so it comes out more like a stew.  I serve sour cream with it.  Love it!

I thought this recipe was very bland and I followed it exactly as written.  Extremely easy, but you definitely have to add your own stuff to make it have flavor.  Shredded cheese helped.  My kids liked it served with Fritos.

Great base! I added spices as others had mentioned and some corn starch to thicken so it would still be gluten free. Next time I am thinking of adding sliced black olives and cheese.

As is it's okay... Just bland. But I added some cumin and garlic powder it was delish! A couple of the reviewers said they bought chicken instead of using the canned. I was Leary out the canned but it was good and added a nice saltiness to the soup.

I was looking for a recipe that would take advantage of leftover stewed chicken from taco night. I'm so glad I found this! Due to the amount of chicken I had I doubled the amount of corn, tomatoes, and stock (I use reduced sodium stock) and through in the black beans from said taco night. What I ended up with is a lovely tex-mex like stew, with a texture similar to Brunswick stew. Served with cornbread, this was a huge hit and helped me make my chicken go even farther.  I think this will be a permanent addition to the dinner lineup after taco night. :D

Good flavor in a short amount of time!   Great soup to whip together after a long day at work.  I only subbed fresh shredded chicken breast instead of the can of cubed chicken.  Topped with tortilla strips and cheddar cheese, and my husband loved it too.

Loved it. I replaced the black beans with rotini noodles, real chicken breasts diced up in place of the canned chicken and added a little paprika, chili powder and salt and pepper. This is by far the easiest and best tasting soup I have ever made.

Easy, easy, easy!  Add NO salt, but can spice it up a bit if you prefer.  Drain and rinse the black beans.  We've had 3 times and it is great.

This is a great and quick recipe, easy to throw together in a pinch and more often than not I have what I need in the pantry already.  Easy to modify too, if I don't have diced tomatoes with green chilies I just use regular (or fresh) diced tomatoes and throw in something else to heat it up a bit (green chilies, chopped up peppers, chili powder, etc.).  Very forgiving with quantity changes too and a lot of fun to play around with, I haven't made a bad version yet.  I personally don't mind the canned chicken, it's easy enough to make this a nice complex flavor that will mask the bland canned chicken flavor with ease.

This didn't have a great taste to it, rather bland but spicy if you get what I mean. It needs adjusting from the posted recipe because it just didn't have enough umpf. Great as a fast meal that you don't really want to taste but the leftovers were left in the fridge and just wasn't good enough to try again. I might adjust this next time or find a different recipe.

Everybody had to have this recipe the first time I made it. My secret ingredient is cinnamon! Instead of canned chicken, I boiled a couple of chicken breasts, sprinkling some cinnamon on the water. Tastes so good you might want to add a little more to the soup itself. I also added the suggested cumin and cream of chicken soup, and yes, definitely rinse those black beans!  Serve with tortilla chips.

WE loved it!! Used Taco seasoning since I did not have all the spices on hand and it worked well!! Some of us have non chilli pepper friendly tummies and so I omitted them and it was still very good.  We got corn chips for extra we did not put them in the soup but used them to scoop and they really added to it.  We will do this again...

This is 4.5 star worthy with the following alterations: sautee your own chicken cutlets in olive oil/garlic/lime juice, dice up and add to the pot with everything else in it.  Dash across the top the following: cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, Nature's seasoning.  Squeeze a few squirts of lime juice (plastic variety works fine). Serve with shredded cheddar, toritillas, and sliced Haas avocado.  Wah-lah.

This basic recipe is awesome!!! I was a little skeptical using chicken in a can so I got the best brand I could find to feel comfortable using it. I did use 2 additional cans of condensed cream of chicken. I accidently bought Busch's red beans for chili but I drained the sauce & used it still & they were far better than black beans! I also used half a bag of a frozen corn/greenbean/carrot melody. For seasoning I used: salt, cumin, ground garlic, Mexican oregano, & chili powder. Oh & I used the tireless with cilantro lime. Garnish with lots of cheese!

Excellent with the suggestions from other reviewers. I added cumin, chili powder, cilantro, and chopped garlic. I cut the chicken broth in half and used about a tablespoon of heavy whipping cream b/c I didn't have condensed soup. Also used frozen fire roasted corn instead of canned corn and used chicken tenders.

I've been making this for years.  I buy 2 cans of chicken tortilla soup in the Mexican section of the grocery store and proceed to kick it up several notches! I add a can of thoroughly rinsed and drained black beans. Instead of canned, I shred a store-bought rotisserie chicken, using about 1 1/2 cups of the meat, saving the rest for another recipe. Instead of the canned tomatoes w/ chilies, plus approx. 1 tsp of ground cumin and 1 jar of salsa (any 'heat'). This makes the soup pretty thick so I usually add 1-2 cans of chicken broth. Taste and adjust the seasonings. I then serve the soup over roughly broken lime-flavored tortilla chips, lite sour cream & Monterrey Jack - Colby Cheese blend or Mexican Cheese blend. Easy, so wonderfully filling & low in calories (especially if you don't use the tortilla chips). You have to give this a try!!

Great basic recipe that can be easily customized.  We add about half a package of taco seasoning to give it just the right amount of kick.  Be sure to rinse the canned beans to help cut down the sodium content.  We like our soups spicy and hearty, so we use regular "full strength" Rotel.  Rotisserie chicken or the John Soules pre-cooked chicken packets make a heartier version.  This recipe is so easy -- I highly recommend.

I made this according to directions, but opened a can of cream style corn instead of regular.  I had already added two cans of broth, so my soup was a bit thin.  Next time I may use the creamed corn with just one can of broth.  The soup was a bit bland, so I added around a teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder and a little onion and garlic powder.  My husband thought it was great and couldn't believe it was from 6 cans!  Next time I'll try to use a rotisserie chicken, but the canned was all I had on hand this time.  This is a great recipe to pull together from pantry ingredients on short notice!

I poach about four chicken thighs skin and debone it and just tear it apart. I use the broth from it instead of canned. I also add a can of white hominy, rinsed and drained. Also a small can of chopped green chili's I work with several Hispanic ladies and they love it when I bring this soup.

Quick,simple, Delicious,and filling! I did take the advice of the reviews and tweaked it a bit. This is what I did: I rinsed the black beans, I used a rotisserie chicken that I got at the market instead of canned chicken (meat in a can just didn't sound yummy to me), one can of chicken broth and two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup (I didn't add water) and I added a bit chili powder and a dash of garlic powder. We topped it off with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream, and dipped our tortilla chips in it. FABULOUS! especially when you're in a rush, I think it tool a total of 10 minutes! Will definitely be making this again.

Very quick (35 min total), delicious. I followed some other reviewers on here and replaced 1 can of broth with 1 can of cream of chicken soup. I also used 2 chicken breast halves cubed and cooked instead of the canned chicken. I added quite a bit of chili powder and cumin and served with avocado chunks with a bit a lemon juice and salt with chips. People were upset. Because there wasn't enough. Will double next time. I did hear it reheated was good too.

Because I didn't have the diced tomato's and I didn't want to open a 28oz can of beans, I had to make some alterations since I didn't want to go to the store. I also halfed the recipe, sort of. I used a 12oz jar of Mild salsa and only @3/4 cup of chicken broth since I like thick, chunky soups. Tasted good for a quick meal.

So very simple but so very good. I took some of other reviewers suggestions like 1 can of broth 1 can of cream of chicken. Next time I won't use a can of water to thin it out. I like it thicker. I also added 1/4 t of red chili flake, cayenne & paprika and 1/2 T of chili powder. Since this is the 2nd time I'm making it I decided to rinse off the black beans so the soup wouldn't have an an off putting color and hand shredded the chicken chunks so it would be more evenly distributed.

This soup is fantastic and very fast to make.I did make some
alterations thou...Pinto beans instead of Black,Twice the
amount of chicken,added more chopped Jalapenos,plus red pepper.
After the HOT soup is in the serving bowl,added a generous
amount of Jack cheese(which will melt somewhat)then some
broken up corn chips.Don't ever forget the Avocado on the
side or in the soup.

So, so, so good!  I added plenty of herbs and spices (garlic powder, chili powder, seasoned salt, fresh cilantro) because without these, I could see where the complaints of it being un-flavorful comes into play.  Will be making again and agin!

THis is SO easy and hearty-great. I can keep all the ingredients in my pantry and pull it out for a quick lunch.

I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of chicken stock, not condensed. I also put a dollup of sour cream at the bottom. YUM!

So easy, took 5 minutes to prepare and made 3 adult main-meal servings for lunch. You could probably inrease the soup without increasing the other ingrediants and make more servings.

I added cooked chicken, frozen corn rather than canned. Also I added salsa, instead of green chili's. Its easy to substitute on this recipe. It still was rated excellent by those who tried it out. Use nacho chips on the side, with jalapeno yogourt as a topping. It was great!

I loved this recipe!!  So quick and delicious with the same changes all the other reviews suggested.  I doubled the chicken to make it a little heartier.  Used two cans of condensed Cream of chicken along with one can of chicken broth.  Spiced it up with Cumin, Chilli Powder, White pepper, and black pepper.  Topped with Cheddar cheese, sour cream, fresh cilantro and fresh parsley.  This recipe is to die for!!

I did as a lot of people suggested. Added cream of chicken for half the broth, added cumin and chili pepper and powdered garlic, tore up a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and cooked it in the crock pot all day. DELICIOUS. So easy, so fast, so tasty. A total win!

The only thing I did different was cook my own chicken.  We loved it so I guess we aren't too adventurous.  I just really like that no one would guess you just opened some cans to make it.  This one is a keeper for me.

Got to say it's easy-peasy, but it tastes like 5 cans of vegetables with chicken. Added a dash of garlic powder, dried cilantro, cayenne pepper and cumin to the soup for an excellent flavor. Will remember it -- as long as I add a little spice to make it taste like something.

Loved it and so easy!  I made this in the crock pot.
the only things extra I added was cornstarch to thicken it up (could have been up to 3 tbs...didn't measure), an additional can of chicken and half a hot & spicy taco seasoning packet.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is the second time I made this recipe in one week. My youngest came home from college and had heard how much we all loved it-so I made it for him too. I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of chicken broth.I put it all in my crock pot, so everyone can help themselves all day.We LOVE it! And SO easy!

Even my kids ate this, thanks for the recipe!  I followed others suggestions and added a lot more seasonings like cumin, chili powder and crushed garlic.  First I brought 4 C of chicken broth to boil, threw in a whole chicken breast to cook and took it out just before it was done instead of using  canned chicken.  After that the rest of the ingredients were added.  Pulled the chicken apart, added it back in and got out the hand blender  till I got the "thicker" consistency I wanted.  Only had one key lime so I cut it in half, squeezed it and threw it into the soup to really get the lime flavour.  Will definitely make this again!

So simple and delicious.  Added the cheese when served and put some chips on the side.  We like things spicy, so just added a little more heat.

Driving home last night was our first cold spell and I thought about how good a hot soup would be for the office today.  I grabbed an oven roasted chicken and the ingredients for this.  Everyone raved about how good it was and wanted the recipe.  After reading the reviews I took away one of the cans of broth and added a can of condensed cream of chicken and added no water.  I drained and rinsed the black beans, drained the corn and otherwise made it per the directions.  I did add cumin, a little onion powder and garlic salt, along with fresh cracked pepper, salt along with chipotle pepper and some cayenne pepper.  It kicked like a mule!  I was even surprised at how good it turned out.  Topped it off with some extra sharp cheddar, sour cream and popped a cluster of tostitos hint of lime chips around the bowls.  This is some really good eatin!

Made this for dinner last night. I forgot to drain the tomatoes and it was still very delicious! When I make it the next time, I'll probably for get again.  I boiled my own chicken breast and shredded it. I'm not a fan of can chicken.

Easy comfort food and fast!  You can add almost anything to the basic recipe including left over veggies, but here are the basics.  Use real chicken, not canned.  Either rotisserie or just bake a couple of boneless chicken breasts rubbed with a little olive oil, salt and pepper for about 20 minutes.  Rinse the black beans well.  Use 1 can broth and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  Add 1 tsp each of cumin and chili powder (or more to taste).

This soup is delish!!!!  Like others before me-I did a little substituting but not much!  Subbed one can of broth for one can of cream of chicken, used a roasted chicken from the grocery store (HEB).  I added fresh chopped cilantro, chili powder, garlic powder and a little salt.  Served in a bowl with sliced avocado and a dollop of sour cream on top...didn't need any tortilla chips.  Absolutely fabulous and we got two meals from it!  I highly highly recommend!

If you are looking for an easy to put together, fast, and adaptable recipe- this one fits the bill... I tried this recipe last night.  Based on the other reviews I doctored it up. I was being lazy and since I am slightly opposed to canned chicken; I used a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket in lieu of.  I also used a little extra chicken broth and drained and rinsed the beans and corn, and drained the diced tomotoes- I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, and spiced it up with some chipotle chili powder- if you don't like spicy I would recommend some fresh cilantro. Let this simmer for an hour or so, and then served it with some shredded extra sharp cheddar, a dab of sour cream, and some blue corn tortilla chips.

I've made this twice so far - once exact & once fiddled with. Fiddled with I added a can of green enchilada sauce which was really good. It added a bit of heat and made the broth a little thicker. Also, excellent when diced red pepper, a bit of frozen spinach and a touch of taco seasoning added.

My daughter makes this soup all the time and it is one of my favorite things ever to eat. Normally I would not like as much broth, but it works out perfectly once you put it over the tortilla chips. In fact, she now uses one 32-oz box of chicken broth which is more than the recipe calls for and it is still wondrful. Just allows us to use more torilla chips. Yum.

I've also made this soup for years but mine has a few more cans of goodies. I add a can of refried beans, can of green enchilada sauce, 505 medium green chile sauce, cup or so of Pace picante sauce and throw in a cup or so of grated sharp cheddar cheese. Mmmmm.  Just a tip about the salty- ness. Use low salt broth....much better

This was awesome!!!!I took the advice of one of the reviewers and used a rotisserie chicken, 1 can cream of chicken soup, fresh cilantro, and cumin; and served it with cheese and avocado.  I threw in fresh chopped garlic, onion, and a smidge of cayenne pepper.  This will now be a regular fall/winter Sunday afternoon football cooking and eating experience.

I found this recipe last year and made it several times since! It's so good and could not be easier!! I serve it nice big bowls and sit out sour cream, tortilla chips, and shredded cheddar. This way, each person can choose their own toppings. Did I mention I LOVE this soup??

This was good. I read the reviews and added a can of cream of chicken, cumin, chili powder and some garlic. Was simple and good. Will make again. I froze the leftovers so hopefully it will be just as good the next time around.

Amazing, easy and fast meal on work nights... I add LOTS of cumin and chili powder to amp it up a bit.  I also use the cans of chicken from Costco not drained - (2), and use chicken stock instead of water.  Add plain greek yogurt and avocados on top and you're set!

I thought this was excellent, I made slight alterations.  I added a can of condensed cream of chicken soup, as well as roasted chicken, not canned.  I also added some taco seasoning, with these slight tweaks I thought it was a wonderful tasty soup.  I topped with tortilla chips, and shredded cheese..so delish, and quick & easy..It doesn't get any better.

I took other reviewers suggestions and used rotisserie chicken instead of canned, black beans instead of kidney (drained - my personal preference) and added one teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder. My husband made some fresh pico from our garden and we topped it off with that. Thanks for sharing!

This was very yummy.  I cooked some chicken and used 4 cups of the broth.  I also sliced up 3 tortillas and added them at the end.  Very easy and very good.

As is it would be like 3-4 stars, but I followed previous suggestions and with these changes it would be 5 stars. I used grilled chicken breast, added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp red pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, some ground pepper, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 chicken broth container, and topped with cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips and it was amazing this way!

You can't get much easier.  Well worth your while (and probably 4 stars) with freshly cooked chicken.

Made this soup for my book club group....this isn't a well known soup in Atlantic Canada so the ladies' didn't know what to expect...they LOVED it!!!
I did take advice from the comments....substituted 1 can of broth with low fat cream of chicken - rinsed the black beans real well - used rotisserie chicken instead of canned - added cumin, chili powder and garlic powder.
I can't say that it was much better than the original since I haven't made the original yet....but this version was delicious and soooo quick and easy.
Thank you for the fabulous recipe and all the valuable comments/advice !!!

I'm giving this 3 stars for ease. Not terrible, but it can definitely be improved by not using canned chicken.  I will probably not make again.

Good way to use up canned chicken, or for that leftover broth thats in your fridge! I drained and rinsed the beans, and sauteed an onion first before adding everything together. 

Also, by suggestion of other reviewers, I used cream of chicken to thicken it up but cornstarch would work too.

So easy and yummy with a little hot sauce.

Excellent recipe.  I used grilled chicken instead of canned chicken and I added only 1 can of chicken broth and a can of cream of chicken soup.  I also added a little bit of chili powder and cayenne pepper.  I will make this soup again in the near future.

This was a quick easy meal to make and pretty tasty. As a personal preference I would cook my own chicken instead of using canned. I also served it with a Mexican Corn Bread recipe which was a perfect side dish.

I'd rate this a 5 for easiness, speed, and ability to customize.  I don't like the taste of canned chicken so I use fresh shredded chicken, and my family doesn't like heat so don't add chiles or jalapenos but add in seasoning instead.  Overall, it's becoming a weeknight go-to.

This soup came out great AFTER modifications. It needs seasoning. I used chicken bouillon, chili powder, Mediterranean spices & onion powder. After ladling the key ingredient was grated sharp cheddar. It was sooo good and healthy. I also used a rotisserie chicken and cream style corn for one of the two cans I used (doubled recipe). It came together in 10 mins. It was great simmering on low all Sunday afternoon as the family was in an out eating at all different times. Will definitely be making this often because it was so easy, healthy, & delicious.

This is perfect. As a college student on a limited budget, I'm often in search of hearty meals for a cheap price--and this fits the bill. However, as a warning, I didn't quite follow the recipe. I like soups thick and creamy (and the local grocery store was out of chicken broth), so I used two cans cream of chicken. I'm also more fond of kidney beans than black, so I used those, rinsed. But I think what made it perfect was the chilies in the tomatoes. It gave it the perfect kick. I love it. Hearty and tasty. I have lunch for the week. Bought some cantaloupe and tortillas to have with it. Seriously, perfect college food when you have a kitchen. I'm excited.

Used leftover turkey breast from fresh half breast I roasted instead of canned chicken. Worked out nicely.

Made just as the directions say, just added a dash of red pepper flakes and some garlic powder.  So yummy with some shredded cheddar, some crushed tortilla chips and a dab of sour cream!  Making some right now to freeze for lunches.  This is like the third or fourth time I've used this recipe.  Will make for many years to come!

This is so freaking good, I make it all the time!  I followed other suggestions and added garlic powder, cumin and chili powder and replaced one can of chicken broth with one can of low sodium cream of chicken soup.  I've made it with canned chicken and it is still pretty darn good, I'd say 4.5 stars,  but if you have time to pick up a rotisserrie chicken from the store, do it!  That definitely makes it a 5 star recipe.

Very easy and pretty good.  My only comment is that the black beans need to be rinsed before adding it to the soup.  I will try the other suggestion about adding a cup of cooked white rice also.

This was super simple and ready in 15 minutes!  I used frozen fire-roasted corn (Trader Joes) instead of canned and topped it with sour cream and diced avocados.

This is excellent. I modified it slightly (out of necessity) into a slow-cooker recipe. I had on hand 1 can each, chili and black beans, 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies, 1 can corn, and 1 can mild enchilada sauce (red). I added the Cumin and Chili powder as suggested and the two cups water and 2 chicken boullion cubes. I popped in some chicken breasts (3 cut up) and slow cooked 1 hr. on high, and 6-7 on low. Served with lime tortilla chips--YUM!!!  Rave reviews from everyone!

EXCELLENT soup with the additions everyone else here has mentioned. I added black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder (yes i love the spicy kick), cumin, rotisserie chicken (instead of canned), lots of cilantro, a dash of adobo. I also agree with substituting 1/2 of the chicken broth with cream of chicken soup to thicken up the consistency. I haven't had tortilla soup this amazing since I went to an authentic restaurant in El Salvador 4 years ago. GREATTTT easy recipe.

Love this soup!  I substituted 1 can of cheese soup for one of the chicken broth cans and it makes it WONDERFUL!  Tastes just like the chicken tortilla soup we can get at a restaurant here in Pa...Max & Erma's.  I use regular store-bought tortilla chips crumbled on top as well.  I prefer a creamy soup so the cheese soup substitution was just perfect!  Definitely will make again and again!

I followed the suggestion of substituting one can of cream of chicken for the chicken broth. The rotisserie chicken instead of the canned chicken is definitely the way to go. My husband is not a soup eater and he LOVED IT! Served with sour cream and tortillla chips to raves!! It's 5-star with the changes!!

I made this in a slow cooker with frozen chicken breast and a packet of taco seasoning. After six hours I pulled the chicken out to shred it and put it back in the slow cooker until we were ready to eat. Awesome recipe!

Just as it sez a "delicious and easy" soup.  I threw it together in no time.  I used a small can of green chilies with a can of diced tomatoes as I didn't have the combo can.  Be sure and rinse the black beans to maintain a good color to the soup.  Great to use up the last of the rotisserie chicken rather than the expensive small can of chicken.

I followed many of the suggestions in the other reviews and was THRILLED with the result!  I have been obsessed with Moe's Southwest Grille's Chicken Tortilla soup and now can make my own comparable version! 

I used 32 oz (UNCONDENSED) chicken broth, 1 can each of Cream of Chicken and 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken soup (do not add water), 1 small chopped yellow onion, Green Giant Mexicorn  to take advantage of the red and green peppers (drained), 1 can of organic black beans (drained and rinsed very, very well), 1 can diced tomatoes with mild green chiles (not drained, just dump on in), and the canned chicken breast in water.  Added salt, pepper, chili powder and garlic power to taste. Threw all in one big pot and simmered over medium heat until it looked done.  I am going to be making this ALL THE TIME! Thank you for the suggestions and great original base recipe!

This was a great base to a recipe - I changed it only slightly.  I used frozen corn only because I don't like canned, I used 3 small chicken breasts (raw and cubed) because I had them to use up, and then added some cilantro and cumin, s&p for more flavor.  I also used, per other suggestions, 1 can chix broth and 1 can cream of chix.  It was really good allowed to simmer in the crockpot!

I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the best soup ever! It's hearty, zesty, and oh-so-easy to make! 

I made the following adjustments to the recipe: I substituted one of the cans of broth for a 10.5oz can of cream of chicken to keep it from being watery. I also added 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp creole seasoning, and a big handful of freshly chopped cilantro leaves. I also garnished the finished soup with tortilla strips and Mexican blend shredded cheese. 

This recipe is so tasty and quick to make that I will be making it two nights in a row! I would recommend it to everyone.

This was good, but I am still trying to figure out what I could have done to thicken up the liquid.  It just tasted a bit watery.
As another reviewer stated, I would substitute a store-bought or home-roasted chicken for canned.

This is such a great recipe!  Super simple and I had everything on hand already to make it.  I did change a few things.  I added a little bit more chicken than after all the simmered and heated all the way through, I added 3/4 cup rice and cooked for another 20 minutes.  The rice made it thicker and it was very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I add garlic, cumin, cilantro spices to taste. I also like to top with cheese and sour cream. I eat it with tortilla chips. The boyfriend likes a little kick, the tomatoes with the green chilis hot version is just enough. It freezes well. I don't care for canned chicken so I will cook chicken breast or chicken tenders. I suppose you could even buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it if you felt so inclined.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I did do some tweaking of ingredients as did all the other reviewers. I added all as stated except shredded chicken breasts that I cooked in the soup and removed half way through to shred and placed back in the soup. The additions I added were chopped onions, chopped garlic, cumin, chili powder, a can of green chili enchilada sauce, a can of cream of chicken soup, and a cup of rice. This soup was very thick and delicious! I used a Crockpot over several hours which made this even easier!

This was so stinkin' easy! It took me literally 5 minutes to throw together and it was so delicious. I made one addition and added a can of pinto beans. I also used low sodium broth and no added salt corn & beans. I will make this again. Next time I might add cumin or other seasonings.

I can not believe how good this soup is!  It is awesome!  I added a little bit of crushed red pepper because I like a little heat.  I served it with tortilla chips, sour cream, avocado slices, and a squirt of lime.  Yum!

Add cilantro!!!! It adds an entirely new dimension and really enhances the southwestern flavor. It couldn't be any easier to make. Rinse the black beans, add cilantro, try variations... a great recipe and much appreciated.

It is getting close to the end of soup season here in FL and I needed to use up some canned soup in my pantry...this recipe was a great idea. Here's what I did. I cooked two chicken breast in my pressure cooker which always gives a nice broth. Then I added a can of chicken progresso soup, can of cream of chicken (the soups I needed to get rid of), can of black beans undrained, can of diced tomatoes/w chiles, cut up a green bell pepper and jalapeno. Didn't have corn but sure that would have been great in there also. It was spicy and delicious...thanks for the recipe...none left today.

I rate this 5 stars but only using other's suggestions. I added spices such as cumin, onion powder, pepper, and cayanne pepper for some much needed heat. I also added minced garlic. In place of canned chicken I shredded store bought roasted chicken (easy & it makes a BIG difference).

Use 1 can chicken broth and 2 cans cream of chicken for creamy soup. It was delicious! My boyfriend and roommate LOVED it! They wanted me to make it again the following week. 

Top with some shredded cheddar and tortilla chips... YUM!

A simple foundation to work from to make an excellent soup.  Instead of using canned chicken, I boiled two small boneless skinless chicken breasts and shredded them.  I sauteed half an onion in the pot before adding all the other ingredients.  As per other reviews I substituted one can of chicken broth for a can of condensed cream of chicken soup.  I also added 1 tsp ground cumin and 1/2 tsp ground chipotle pepper to give it a little spice/heat.  Served with tortilla chips and some grated cheddar.  It was a big hit with the boyfriend.

As a note, I forgot to rinse the black beans before adding them, and it definitely gives the soup a kind of brownish-gray color which looks slightly unappetizing but doesn't affect the taste.  If serving to company or don't want grayish soup, I'd recommend rinsing the beans!

This gets five stars because it is so quick and easy but delicious all at the same time.  Used only one can of broth and added one can of cream of chicken soup but followed the recipe otherwise.  I used Rotel for the diced tomatos and was actually surprised at how good this was!

I also added a few items to give this recipe a kick. I added sazon-a can't live with out little packet of magic from goya! I also added garlic, cumin and a little onion. I did use fresh chicken instead of the canned chicken.  On the advice of another i also rinsed the black beans to make the color look great!  I really enjoy this soup!

I doubled this recipe and served it at a gathering recently.  I used a whole rotisserie chicken instead of canned chicken.  I also added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce and seasoned with cumin, garlic powder, dried Mexican oregano, cilantro and epazote.  I served the soup with Mexican rice, tortilla chips, lemon wedges and sliced avocado.  It was delicious and everyone loved it.  Several people asked for the recipe.  Thank you!

Followed the recipe as written but served with a dollop of sour cream, some shredded mexican cheese and tortilla strips. Great, quick, cheap and easy. Will definately make again but will most likely sub the canned chicken for rotisserie chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful and super easy! We used Rotel tomatoes and chiles and that really made the dish. Because we're not too fond of black beans, we used pinto beans instead and it was awesome! Next time we'll add some rice to it as well!

I loved this recipe... but also made small adjustments. Instead of the chicken broth I used one can of cream of chicken soup with one large rectangle of  Maggi's (or Knorr) chicken buillon with 2 cups of water. Mixed that well together first then added the remaider ingredients. Also, for the tomatoes I used a can of mild Rotel and I rinsed the black beans before mixing them in, so that they would not give the soup a greyish appearance. My husband and kids loved it. It was just right in the spice department for us and my husband added hot sauce to his. We all added shredded Mexican Cheese blend and some of us chose to add a dollop of sour cream. The best part of this recipe? You can always have htose cans in your pantry and meal is ready in 15 minutes!

Super easy and delicious!!  we top it with mixed mexican cheese and sour cream and dip with french bread!  Add a bunch of random seasonings/spices to taste to give it an extra kick! (cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic salt, lowrys seasoning, etc.)

Loved it! Especially how easy it was! I used original Rotelle for the right amount of heat, and didn't have to add any other spices. 2 cans of cream of chicken and one can of broth made it just the right texture.

This recipe is bland... if you spice it up with cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and garlic powder it really helps out a lot. I also used one can of chicken broth, and one can of cream of chicken soup. I would also use fresh chicken instead of canned chicken. I also had to add a little water to thicken it up.

GREAT RECEIPE.  ONE SUGGSTION THAT MAKES THIS SOUP EVEN BETTER IS DON'T USE THE CANNED CHICKEN - DOESN'T TASTE THE BEST . PICK UP A ROASTED CHICKEN FROM THE MARKET AND PUT THAT IN INSTEAD.  SERVE OVER TORTILLA CHIPS AND TOP WITH SOUR CREAM AND SHREDDED CHEESE.  THANKS FOR A FANTASTIC RECEIPE

I give this five stars for it's simplicity, and four stars for taste. I liked the taste a lot, but it could use a few more ingredients to make it better. Next time we will put in some onion and cilantro. Thanks so much for a nice, easy dinner!

This gets 4 stars just for the ease of it. As far as taste goes, pretty good considering it came from only cans. Of course fresh is best but I like to sub a can of hominy for the corn. It really gives it a more "authentic" flavor. Add some cumin and chili powder and you've got a 5 star winner.

Way too salty, not enough spice - make sure you drain (and for beans, rinse) everything.  I swapped one can chicken broth for 2 cans cream of chicken, added 1% milk, and added tons of chile powder, garlic powder, and cumin.  Pretty good with some touch-ups; very easy, cheap, quick and tasty.

This recipe is a fantastic base.  I made it according to directions the first time with sides of cheese, tortilla chips, and avocado on the table.  I’ve since made this recipe multiple times and true to form have doctored it up many different ways.  I make my own stock weekly and this is a great way to reduce the sodium in this soup.  I like to roast a chicken on Sunday and the leftover dark meat is great to throw in the pot.  (The carcass gets used for stock the next week.)  I usually throw in some combination of cumin, Tabasco, cilantro, garlic, and maybe a few bits of onion if it’s left over from something else.  This is a great recipe to always have the ingredients on hand and customize it to whomever you’re cooking for.  Just always remember the avocado and tortilla chips!  Thank you for an amazing base recipe.  The boyfriend always gives it a double thumbs up, and is always disappointed when he orders this at restaurants.  He always says “It’s not as good as yours.”

This was surprisingly delicious.  I followed some of the other reviewers recommendations and added one can cream of chicken, one box of chicken broth, half a packet of taco seasoning, some cumin and a pinch of cayenne.  I poached my chicken breasts in water with some taco seasoning.  Served with grated mozzarella and a dollop of sour cream.  Extra good second day.

I am giving this 5 stars for ease of preparation and kid appeal!  We used a few chicken breasts that were precooked, and substituted original Rotel tomatoes for extra flavor.  This was on the table in 10 minutes and with chips and salsa on the side to round out the meal it was a real hit!

Simple and super easy. The taste is very good, not outstanding but might try again when in a rush and the budget is low. Adding some tortilla chips on top just before serving adds so much to it as well.

Fantastically easy! instead of 2 cans chicken broth, used 1 can Swanson low sodium, 1 can cream of chicken + 1 can water. Drained the corn, drained and rinsed the beans, only partially drained the can of Rot ell's chilies and tomatoes (i love their flavor and spice!). Canned chicken made it totally no fuss, but i'd prefer using "real" chicken.

granted, this is an okay soup, but it's not chicken tortilla soup... there are no tortillas called for in the recipes, so basically it's six can chicken soup.. and it needs a lot more flavor

I made this one night when I thought I was getting sick. My boyfriend LOVED it!  Last week he brought up again how much he enjoyed it.  I squirted limes into each bowl and added chopped cilantro as well.  I also used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can broth like others suggested.  I added cumin and chili pepper to taste.

This is so easy and simple. I bought low sodium whenever possible for this recipe just because all the canned ingrediants are so high in sodium. Besides that, It's a great recipe. Youll actually find yourself making your own changes the second or third time you make it.

Without adding chili powder and cumin it is very bland. MAYBE,MAYBE I'll try it again with real chicken, but I doubt it.

My family LOVES this, I did make a couple of tweeks: used rotisserie chicken as someone suggested & chicken stock instead of broth. Also added garlic powder, chili powder, bay leaf, cumin. Put dolloup of sour cream and mexican shredded cheese to serve and have crumbled up nacho chips available for topping (great use for bottom of the bag brocken chips). My son loves this so much this is what he requested for his bday dinner :-).

This is a fantastic throw together soup. I have made soups of other variations in the past with pre packaged ingredients.  This soup is great as is but I added an eyeball (TS)of cumin, chili powder, 1 bay leaf and a palm full of fresh chopped oregano.    Thanks for this great recipe!!!

This was great!  I used the other reviewers input too about 1 can broth and 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  The looks on my family's faces (teenage boys) was priceless.  They didn't even want to try it, but I pulled out the Tostitos and then there was nothing left.

Very good recipe, thanks for sharing! The only 2 things I did differently were 1 I used a store bought whole chicken and shreded it and 2 I used one can of chicken broth and one can of cream of chicken like other reviewers suggested. Very good, nice kick to it, going to be making this again very soon!

This was a decent start to a good recipe.  It just needs some extra seasoning but it was very easy.  I used a rotissiere chicken which added good flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was such a good change of pace for us. I had every item available at home, no quick run to the store. I used 1/2 can cream of chk with 1/2 can broth. I added frozen corn, chunky salsa, HOT sauce, chili powder. I added crushed up torilla chips with guac, sour cream and cheese on top. This was awesome and soooo easy!

Husband gave the thumbs up and says save this recipe! Based on other reviews, I used 1 can chicken broth + 1 can water and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. Also added, salt, pepper,garlic salt, and cumin to taste and threw in almost any bean we had in the house. We practically scooped it up with tortilla chips. Kind of like a warm salsa. A hearty and filling meal.

Agree it's great doctored!  Easy to make, so try it. Use 2 cans cream of chicken, cumin, garlic powder and chili powder. I also rinsed the black beans. Added cilantro, a little cheese and avocado. It would be great with sour cream. Yummy!!

This is an excellent base as noted by other reviewers...I used 2 cans of chicken broth (1 with low sodium), 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of rotel, 1 can of red gold "chili ready" diced tomatoes, a can of rinsed and drained black beans, a bag of frozen corn and a can of chunk white chicken. I seasoned with California style garlic salt, adobo seasoning, and fresh ground pepper. We toasted a couple of loaves of sweet italian bread seasoned with the California garlic salt and olive oil spray and dipped it since I didn't have tortillas, chips, or crackers on hand. Very easy and very delish:) Even my 3 picky children loved it!! It really does need "tweaked" to fit your family but that's the easy part since you know your tastes!

Fantastic!  I added some oregano and cumin; used frozen corn instead of canned; Great Northern Beans (all I had on hand) instead of Black Beans; and used the meat from a whole chicken (with which I was making stock) instead of canned chicken.  It was delicious!   My husband (who ordinarily doesn't like soup) couldn't get enough.  He's been telling everyone about this amazing chicken tortilla soup that I made! One suggestion, chop fresh cilantro and green onion to sprinkle on top of each bowl of soup.  Yum!

I just made this recipe for the first time. I did as others suggested, and changed a few things. I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, boiled and shredded, 1 tsp chili powder, sprinkled with garlic salt, 1 tsp cumin, 2 cans of reduced fat condensed cream of chicken soup (in place of 1 of the chicken broth cans), 1 can of chicken broth, 1 cup of water and left everything else the same. I dumped it all into the crock pot for a few hours. I added shredded cheese and baked flour tortillas on 350 for a few minutes, cut them up and added them as well. Great recipe and easy too. Thank you=) This one's going in my favorites=)

I made it exactly as written it was so easy and cheap, cost me $15 to make a double batch. I made it again and added a 16 oz. can cream of chicken soup and used a can of black beans and a can of white beans. It was excellent both ways. Really good served with corn bread.

My family loves this recipe.  Even my two year old likes to help me cook this one.  He taste everything as it is going in the pot.  All three of my young kids gobble this one up.  The best thing is that I keep the ingredients stocked in my pantry so on nights when we need something quick for dinner this is my "go to" recipe.

I added the following ingredients: 2 cans of cream of chicken, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp chili powder, and cilantro to give the soup more flavor. Also, I served rice, then the soup, and topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream in a big bowl and lunch is served!

Simple and delicious.  Defineately use one can of cream of chicken.  After my son was born we ate this soup at least once a week.  It was a real lifesaver.  My best friend is about to have a baby and I plan on giving her the recipe and the stuff to make it when I visit.

If you're looking for a quick, satisfying soup, this is fantastic.  Easy to prepare, and most of it I had in the pantry already.  My kids are generally pretty picky, and they gobbled this up!

Wonderful and easy soup.  After reading several reviews the only change I made was to omit one can of broth and replace it with one can cream of chicken soup.

I love this recipe.  I used both cans of chicken stock.  I didn't have any black beans but I did have a can of chili beans.  I added the can without draining it.  The gravy added to the flavor and helped thicken the soup.  I didn't have the tomatoes with green chilies so I added a plain can of tomatoes and then added a can of chopped green chilies.  I also sauteed carrots, celery, onions and bell peppers before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I'll make this again and again!

I just got done making this recipe at my parents' house, and I must say that it got quite the reception.  I did note a few user suggestions and made a few of my own, though.  For one I substituted a can of condensed cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of broth.  Also, I added cumin, dried cilantro, and about 4 canned chipotle chiles (chopped) and some adobo sauce that they were packed with, it added a nice smokey flavor and a real good punch to the dish.  I also used the canned corn that had some green/red chiles in it.  I did drain the black beans, and I didnt completely drain the juice from the stewed tomatoes.  Definitely will make this cheap, easy dish again.

This is a great recipe, however, add-ins are a must!  Can't get any better than this for a weeknight dinner -cheap fast and easy! I also subbed cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of broth as well as a jar of fire-roasted salsa instead of the canned tomatoes.  I used canned chicken because I had some on hand that needed to be used, but will definitely be using fresh next time.  I added about a c. frozen diced onion, 1/4 c. finely chopped cilantro, 1.5 T. lime juice, 2 oz can diced green chiles, 3 cloves finely chopped garlic, and seasoned to taste with chili powder and cumin.  Turned out great...my picky hubby said he would have eaten 5 bowls if he could've :)
Thanks Terryn!

Wow!  So easy!  I was skeptical becuase of its simplicity, but I did make a few tweaks.  I didn't have any cream of chicken and all the reviews raved about adding it, so I melted 2Tbsp butter with 2 Tbsp flour and 1 cup of milk.  I added that to a chicken breast boiled in water with celery, onion and thyme (about 45 mins).  Added a can of corn, rinsed black beans and diced tomates.  Once I threw in cumin and some chili powder, it was perfect!

Great starter recipie. For mine, I use 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of chicken broth, 1 frozen chicken breast, 1 can of whole kernel corn drained, 1 can of black beans drained and rinsed, 1 can of Rotel drained, 1 tablespoon of chili powder, and 1 teaspoon of Cumin. Put all ingredients in a crock pot on low, give it a stir and 8 hours later.. delicious soup. I serve it with tortilla chips, sour cream, and shredded cheddar cheese. There are NEVER any left overs!

I personally thought this was really bland.  I even added a bit of taco seasoning & cumin for flavor.. Don't think I'll be making this one again..

Wonderful. Followed the recipe but took others' advice to 1) rinse the beans  2) add cumin and chili powder - I would say at least 1 tbsp each and 3) substitute 1 can of cream of chicken soup (I used Healthy Request) for half of the broth. Added a little cheese and sour cream on top and served with tortilla chips. Yum.

Sauteed about 1/2 c of onion in pot before adding ingredients.  Left out the corn, added 1 can of cream of chicken soup, drained the black beans and Rotel tomatoes.  Included 1 packet of taco seasoning mix.  Topped with crunched tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream.  Voila!  Very good.  Made it with canned chicken breast this (first) time, and it works fine.  Can see how real chicken would enhance it even more, but if you don't have that available then canned chicken works just fine.  Will definitely be making this again.

EVERYONE LOVED THIS.  I OMITTED THE CANNED CHIX, BUT DID ADD A CAN OF CREAM OF CHIX SOUP TO CUT DOWN ON THE SPICE FOR MY SON.  WE CRUMBLED 1 DORITO IN EACH CUP AND IT WAS SURPRISINGLY GREAT!  DEFINITELY A KEEPER FOR US.  I DID ADD GARLIC PWDR., CUMIN AND CHILI POWDER TOO.

Scrumptious and EASY.  Modifications were simple, thanks to an easy recipe and the great suggestions of other reviewers.  I used 1/2 of a roasted chicked purchased at the grocery store, 2 cans of the regular Rotel chopped tomatoes and chilis, 1 can of cream of chicken soup along with cilantro, cumin, and garlic.  After sampling the soup I determined the regular Rotel added too much of a bite and toned it done a tad by adding another can of chicken broth and a can of potatoes (chopped).
Served with tortilla chips and topped with sour cream brought the spice down a tad more, making it easier on hubbies palate.  Personally, I love the spice but others may want to go with the MILD Rotel.

This was a good base recipe, so I gave it 4 stars, but with the additions I made, it was 5! I diced up an onion and cooked it a few minutes with some garlic, and then added the rest of the ingredients (minus the chicken, as I didn't have any). I added some frozen corn, cumin, chili powder, and threw in about 1/2 cup rice and then covered and simmered about 15 minutes (until the rice was cooked). I just served it up, and put a big spoonful of sour cream on top, which made it creamy and smooth (and cooled it down a bit). I just had my second bowl! I followed others reviews and rinsed the black beans first too. This went great with my cheese tortilla! thanks for the recipe, I'll def make this again soon.

Super easy and full of flavor!  I used the suggestion of substituting one can of broth with cream of chicken soup.  I also sprinkled a four-cheese Mexican blend and crushed tortilla chips on top.  The leftovers froze well too.

This recipe is so great and so easy!!The only change I made was I substituted a can of broth with a can of cream of chicken soup.  I served the soup with cheddar cheese, sour cream, sliced jalepeno, and crushed tortilla chips on top.  I can't believe this was so good with no added seasoning and only 6 cans of ingredients.  Try this one, but make sure you add some toppings.  Oh, I also drained and rinsed my black beans before I added them to the soup.

Recipe as written is quick but not flavorful enough.  I add 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp Chili Powder, and 1/2 tsp cumin to the soup while cooking. This adds great flavor and heat to the soup. I also like to add extra broth. I serve with cilantro leaves, green onions, sour cream and tortilla chips. Good base for a very fast and tasty soup.

I will make this again--very easy and good.  I used rotisserie chicken from the store and pinto beans instead of black beans.  I made the recipe as-is, but then added 1 can of cream of chicken soup, just to thicken it up.  Served with tortilla chips and cheese and hot sauce.  The pot was empty and the picky teenagers in the house even liked it!!

It is absolutely outrageous how good this is to have been so simple! Keep these ingredients on hand in your pantry for a last minute meal. I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I used Rotel's tomatoes with green chilies *extra hot. And WOW was it spicy! Also I added the chips in the bottom of the bowl instead of on top as others have suggested. I liked it that way since they got soft and thickened the soup. DELICIOUS!

This was so delicious and easy to make!  I made a couple of changed based on past reviews.  First, I replaced one can of the broth with cream of chicken soup, then I substituted the black beans with white cannellini beans.  I also boiled and shredded some chicken instead of using the canned.  At the end, I mixed in a little cornstarch with water to thicken it up.  It was really good!  My 3 year old son ate 2 bowls of it and the next day, went to the refridgerator and pulled out the bowl of leftovers and asked me to make it for him for his lunch.  I served shredded cheese and crushed tortilla chips on top.  I'll be making this one a lot!  Thanks for sharing!

LOVED this recipe. Made some changes like some of the viewers suggested and it was great. I have made it twice in the last 5 days, great both times. My sister came over to sample it because they think I'm the best cook in the family :) She loved it and wanted the recipe and my husband and I never agree that we like the same thing but he really liked this soup. This recipe will go in my Best Recipes file. Simple and quick and easy. Thanks!

What A great dish!! We just finished this for dinner. YUM!! I made cilantro cream to go on top, along with the sour cream. Double yum!! Thanks for a simple yet satisfying meal!! UPDATE:: I make this quite a bit now. You can alter the ingredients you add to the pot. I always use leftover chicken from a whole chicken I roasted the day before.I also sometimes use a different variety of bean or a combination.

First time I've ever had Tortilla Soup, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was really good. I also followed the suggestions of one reviewer to add the cans of cream of chicken, no water, and it was really good that way. I doubled it (which was very easy) and now have lots of good leftovers. I think next time I make it I won't bother putting in any chicken though. There wasn't enough that I really noticed, and I think it'd be a great meatless meal. Already has protein from the beans anyway. Thanks!

Excellent! I did make a few changes. I used grilled chicken breasts which I had left over and I also put a whole chopped onion in the soup. I thought this gave it a more homemade taste. I also added about a teaspoon of cumin which added a warm flavor. My husband raved over this and I will definately make it again. It is easy and affordable.

I made this for a small dinner party last night, and it was a HUGE hit!  I didn't have canned chicken, so I quickly pan-fried a couple of chicken breasts in salt and pepper, then shredded them.  Everyone loved it, and I will DEFINITELY be making it over and over again.  Thank you!

This is a fantastic recipe. I use it regularly for school functions, etc. I use refried beans instead of black beans, that seems to add a nice flavor, aside from the fact that no one in my family would eat it with black beans in it ... fussy. I've shared this soup with many people and always receive compliments and requests for the recipe!!

Really great and easy! I used this recipe as my base but used a lot of other reviews by adding a can of cream of chicken, some fresh peppers and onions, cumin, lime juice and taco seasoning. Took it to a pot luck and it was a hit!

I really love this recipe.  It has become a soup staple at my house.  I do substitue one can of chicken broth w/cream of chicken as others have suggested.  I also cut up carrots and celery, add a dash of cumin, garlic, and chili powder.  Gives it a little kick.  Also, it is true that it doesn't make a lot of liquid, however by day 2 or 3, i scoop it out and place it on tortilla chips for a taco salad.  YUMMY!!!

Good, healthy, easy! I did add the 2 T. taco seasoning. Not a lot of broth- so if you want more, add more.

Boiled and chopped chicken breasts instead of canned chicken, included cream of chicken and chopped up some onions.  Also, added onion and garlic powder.  Everytime I make this it's a hit!

This soup is delicious and so easy to make!  I substituted one can of chicken broth with cream of chicken soup and used mexican style Rotel for just the right amount of spicy.  Add a dallop of light sour cream on top and MMM so good!  Try the 'Hint of Lime' Tostitos at the bottom of your bowl for a nice little unexpected kick of added flavor!

4 stars as is, 5 with  a lot of add in's.  I used a rotisseri chicken, I added one can of cream of chicken soup, to thicken it, I added cumin and garlic and pepper for flavor, plus about 2 tbs of taco seasoning.  My husband thought that some cooked rice in it would have been a nice addition.  I put it all in the slow cooker and let it go for a good part of the day, it was wonderful and also VERY good reheated.  have to serve it with cheese and tortilla strips on top!

So quick and easy.  Also easy to modify to your own tastes.  I like less corn and milder tomatoes. (Mexican style stewed tomatoes are what I usually use.)  And I also cut back a little bit on the broth and add some cream of chicken soup to make it creamier.  Do rinse the black beans as others have suggested.  And serve with tortilla strips and cheese!

This was awesome, it was fast,delicious and even better the next day. I read some reviews and altered it just a bit.

What I did was put the diced chicken ( I would recommend one more can of chicken) in the pot first, I turned on the burner and seasoned it with garlic salt and a dash of crushed red pepper, then I added all of the ingredients eliminating about half the Swansons chicken, adding two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup and a splash of Franks Red Hot sauce, some corn chips at the bottom of a bowl, topped with soup, a dollop of sour cream,finished off with mexican blend shredded cheese and voila a yummy dinner! This is definately a keeper!

Definitely add a packet of taco seasoning... Also, I used a can of cream of chicken to replace some broth and added a little cream cheese to make it creamier. Def. do the chips, cheese and sour cream on top...makes a big difference!!!

I made this for my mom and husband last nite and boy, was it a hit! We made it exactly as stated besides adding a litle taco seasoning to the soup right before we served. We served it with cheddar and sour cream on top. My husband rated it a 10 and my mom wants a copy of the recipe!!! I'll DEFINITELY make this again.

I was very dissapointed in this recipe.  It came out very watery and very bland.  I tasted it a couple of times while it was cooking, and ended up throwing out the entire pot of soup.

This is so easy, I can't believe how fresh it tastes and it all came from cans. I did add a little extra broth and some cumin and garlic powder. Be sure to drain and rinse the beans before you add them. I served it with some fresh cilantro and sour cream.

I did add some onion powder and taco seasoning b/c without it I was afraid it'd be too bland.  I also used a whole can of green chilies (and juice) and a can of plain tomatoes.  That gave it a little more bite.  We loved it.

YUMMY!  I only had pinto beans, so used those instead (rinsed and drained) and subbed a can of lowfat cream of chicken for one can of broth.  Served with cheese, sour cream and chips. It's so fast! Definitely try this, I'll be making it again and again.

I make a recipe very similar to this.  I use diced chicken breasts.  I also add tons of veggies like potatoes, carrots, cabbage and green beans. I use a whole pkg of taco seasoning and add a can of green chilis.  I use chicken broth rather than cream of chicken soup as other reviewers suggested.  Good and hearty meal.

Great base recipe, but totally awesome if you make the following additions: 1 10oz can fat free cream of chicken condensed soup, seasonings to your own taste preference - chopped fresh cilanto, cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder.  Served with crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheese, chopped green onions and a dollop of sour cream and it was fabulous!!

UNBELIEVABLY GOOD, and incredibly versatile: with minor additions you could have a rustic stew, spicy Latino fare, an herbed garden soup or a distictive Eastern European taste.  For the first time around I altered only to make more soup for our big crew.  Doubled the chicken broth, doubled the tomatoes, one can each of kidney and pinto beans, plus a handful of uncooked white rice.  Simmered until the rice was done.  No leftovers.  I might suggest running the tinned tomatoes through a blender, as I found the beans/rice/chicken made the texture of the tomatoes seem off by comparison.  This recipe is now in our permanent rotation.

Very good:) This soup has so many possibilities! I did not drain my black beans...and yes they will turn your soup gray so i reccomend doing this. I used diced canned tomatoes in mine then added a can of green chilies. Also...i added fresh garlic and 1 tsp of cumin. I did not add a packet of taco seasoning...like some others did...for fear it would taste like my taco soup recipe:)

Without a doubt the greatest, easiest soup I have ever made.  To spice it up a bit instead of the black beans I added Mexican Chili beans.  got rave reviews.

My husband, who rarely cooks has made this soup twice using pheasant from a hunting trip instead of chicken.  He was able to throw it all together and enjoy and great meal in no time.  He couldn't say enough about how good and easy it was.  Would recommend rinsing the black beans before adding.

Excellent and sooooo easy!  I made some changes as others previously suggested I only did one can chicken broth and 2 cans condensed cream of chicken soup.  I could have put some cumin in it.  I used hint of lime flavored tortilla chips and garnished with mexican cheese a dollop of sourcream and diced avocado!  Fast and inexpensive a college girls dream!

This is the best Tortilla Soup recipe that I have ever had.  It is so delicious and best of all,  it is simple.  I also tried adding some white rice to my soup, that was also good. Next time I'm going to try draining some of the juices and placing in a warm flour torilla.

Had to agree with a previous reviewer that this soup had an odd color...almost gray.  I carefully drained the black beans hoping to avoid the unappetizing color but I expected more of a chickeny, healthy yellow color.  Used Rotel tomotoes with chilis as they add a nice kick.  I think the canned chicken resulted in an unusual smell.  Would definitely not use canned meat again.  I prepared this for a soup and salad buffet on Christmas Day.  The Shrimp Bisque (The Soup Mix Gourmet) went over big but the Chicken Tortilla barely got a nod.  Won't make it again.....wish I could have given a better review.

Wow!  I also substituted one can of cream of chicken soup for 1 of the cans of chicken broth, put a bit more than 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and used the "hot" rotel for the diced tomatoes and green chiles and I LOVE this!  Yum!  Quick and easy for sure.

This soup was unbelievable!  I cannot tell you how great this was for how EASY it was!  I did follow other recommendations and used cream of chicken soup instead of one of the chicken broths and kept adding taco seasoning and tasting and adding more as needed.  I served with shredded cheese on top and tortilla chips as "crackers" on the side or crunched up in the soup.  My husband could not believe how good it was and was skeptical at first.  I think this would even be a good pot luck recipe.  I definitely will be making this again and putting it into our dinner menu rotation.

I absolutely loved this...and it couldn't have been easier!!!  I used two cans of chicken broth and two cans of cream of chicken (basically just so I would have more leftovers).  I added a packet of taco seasoning and some garlic powder and it was yummy!  Dumped it all in a pot and let it simmer while I went and worked out for an hour...and had a delicious dinner when I got home!  Topped with low fat sour cream and a little cheese.  Perfect week night meal!

This is a really easy recipe. I don't know if it was the salt and pepper I added or the green chile peppers but it was too spicy for the kids(8 and 3).

Delicious and so easy!  Add a little bit of spices (I used chili powder, cumin, garlic & onion powder), top with tortilla chips and sour cream!!! Mmmm.  The sour cream adds so much, don't go without it.  Of course, it would be even better with "real chicken."

I gave this four stars for the simplicity of it, but honestly, I found it a bit bland and needed to add more spices to make it tastier.

This is great for a quick soup.  Just keep all the ingredients on hand and you can make a fast, but delicious soup.  Let is simmer a little longer than called for and you swear it is homemade.  I have already shared the recipe with friends and family.

Very easy and tasty!  Want to make it easier?  Use the leftovers from Joyce's Pepperocini Beef (another allrecipe recipe) as a substitute for the chicken broth, chunk chicken and chile peppers.  So easy, my hubby handled it easily while home with our kids while I was out!

Delicious! I needed something quick and easy for lunch, and I had all the ingredients on hand except for the tomatoes. I just made half of the recipe, but I substitued 5 ounces of chunky salsa for the tomatoes, and added extra chicken broth. I also added some taco seasoning, garlic salt and onion salt for extra flavor. In addition to the cheese and torilla chips, I also topped mine with slice black olives and a little sour cream. Simple and yummy!

Great and simple. I didn't drain the tomatoes b/c I thought that gave it more flavor. I also used 1 can of cream of chicken and one of broth, this gave it some creaminess. Add some spices, tortillas and avocado and it's almost authentic.

This recipe is fabulous! My mother, who is an amazing from scratch cook, requested this for her birthday dinner.  I added to things to the recipe.  First I sauteed some mixed frozen celery, onion, and red pepper in just a little bit of veg. oil.  Then I added everything plus half a pack of taco seasoning.  A quick and easy way to add some spice, plus it thickened it so it was heartier.  We topped it off with reduced fat cheese and low fat sour cream with the soup on light tortilla chips.  Delicious and still healthy!

Yummy!  As others have said, could use a little more spices.  I made the Southwest Chicken one night then used the leftovers as a base for this a couple of nights later.  Very good.

This was a really great recipe. I only made one change and that was to make it a little thicker. I crushed up tortilla chips and poured some of the broth from the soup over it and then put it in the microwave for 2 minutes, and then simply added it back to the soup. It turned out great!

Eating as we speak-FANTASTIC! Not to mention simple, fragrant, filling...I doubled the corn, beans, and tomatoes with chilis but left the broth and chicken amounts the same. I also used Tyson fajita strips frozen chicken breast instead of the canned chicken. There a tortilla chips on the bottom, soup on top, and TONS of cheese and sour cream covering the whole thing and it is delicious.

This is so yummy!  The first time i made it, i forgot the tortilla chips, so we just ate it with crackers.  I wasn't sure if it was that good, but the next time, i served it over tortilla strips and it mad all the difference.  My husband nearly made himself sick, he ate so much.  Even my 16-month-old ate it.  This is going to be one of our regulars.

My family gives this a thumbs up. A little bland for my hubby, so he kicked his up a little, but so so so easy!

I rate this five stars even though, if made strictly according to the recipe, the soup is very bland.  Howevever, like many others, I added garlic, cumin, chili powder and pepper, and that made all the difference.   Once "spiced up", this soup is quite tasty, and quick and easy to make. All of my requirements are met!

This soup is excellent.  I floated the broken corn chips on top and sprinkled grated cheddar cheese over that.  Very yummy.  If I make it again I might add a little rice to the soup.

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now, ever since I found it on this site. It's really surprisingly great for being so simple. 

Like others here, I've made a few adjustments. Personally instead of canned chicken, I either use fresh chicken (or fajita seasoned raw chicken) and cook it before I start, or I get southwestern flavored chicken pieces already cooked from the fresh or frozen meat section. 

I use regular canned diced tomatoes without the green chile peppers so I use a few seasonings to give it an extra bite : cumin, cayenne pepper, and onion powder more liberally, then just a dash of black pepper.

Excellent recipe!  Very simple and easy to make.  It was  a tad bland for our taste on it's own, so I added cummin, chili powder, garlic salt, and pepper.  Also used fresh chicken and drained/rinsed all but the rotel (the rotel juice adds more spice!) - thanks so much for the recipe... will definitely do it again!!

WOW!  This is a great soup!  My family loves it.  It is great how it is, although my family likes it with a little spice.  I use seasoned black beans, drained a little but not rinsed, tomatoes with mild green chiles not drained, and instead of caned chicken I buy Tyson's Southwestern Seasoned Chicken Strips found in the freezer section.  I cut the chicken into cubes.  I also add chile powder, oragano, cumin and the juice of one lime.  We top our soup with tortilla chips, cheese and cubed avacado.  This soup is so good the second day I double the recipe.

I was looking for an easy recipe for leftover baked chicken. This recipe was EASY and taste GREAT. I used leftover baked chicken breasts (3)and seasoned the soup with garlic powder, chili powder and cumin to my liking. I also drained the can of corn, tomatoes w/green chile peppers and rinse the beans, I used canned red beans and served the soup with "Golden Sweet Cornbread" from this site. Excellent and easy meal. Yum.

So good it is addicting.  The perfect spice-level which is hard to do.  We also added garlic because we are garlic fanatics.  Make a double batch because it is also great leftover.

This was a great, easy-to-make recipe. I added a can of Rold Gold (?) hot tomato sauce. It only comes in a small can as far as I know. Small but it packs quite a punch. Really ups the spiciness factor. Very good!

If you make this recipe be sure to RINSE the black beans or your soup will not look appealing.  There was a serious lack of flavor.  I added tons of seasonings to make it edible.

Excellent recipe! I didn't like the idea of canned chicken, so I used a package of pre-cooked "southwest" flavored chicken. I used 1 can of garlic flavored chicken broth, and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. It was so nice to have excellent meal that took litterally 5 minutes to make. Definately a keeper!

This was easy and GOOD. I was surprised how quickly all the flavors came together. I served this with cheese quesadillas on the side and put out shredded cheddar and sour cream to garnish the soup. Very good with the sour cream. TIPS: I wish I'd crumbled the chunk chicken a little more. Also, this would be even better with leftover chicken. I rinsed my black beans and had no problem with cloudiness.

We love this recipe!!  I doubled the recipe. I used pre-cooked fajita chicken. I took the advice of others and used half broth, half cream of chicken.  I also used black-eyed peas (it was New Years day). I was prepared to add seasonings but it did not need any! We stirred a spoonful of sour cream into our bowl (yummy).  We did NOT ladle it on tortillas.  Instead we had cheese quesadillas on the side.

Great easy recipe.  

Be sure to buy the tortilla chips that the intro says to serve it over.  These are not listed in the recipe itself.

I saw this recipe and thought that it just had to be too good to be true - was I ever wrong! Terryn is right - it tastes just like you made it from scratch. This is definitely going to be a regular at our house.

This soup was incredibly easy, as well as delicious.  I was a little apprehensive about a soup that seemed so simple.  I will definitely be making this again and again!!

I was a little leary to start off with, not sure how this would taste, but in the end it was delicious. It's super easy to throw together at the end of a long day, but makes you feel like you're eating a home cooked meal. I added some chicken and topped with shredded jack cheese and sliced avacado. My picky roommate liked it so much I thought she was going to lick the bowl clean. Will be making this again and again!

My husband and I both thought this was pretty good.  My 10 year old son hated it.  He soesn't like beans.  I especially like how easy it was to prepare.  I didn't use canned chicken, instead I cooked 2 large chicken breasts in chicken broth in my crock pot and shredded it into the soup.  I also drained and rinsed the beans.  Placed crushed tortilla chips in each bowl, ladeled the soup on top, topped with a dollop of sour cream and shredded Jack cheese and served with sourdough rolls.  Like I said my husband and I thought it was pretty tasty but my son gave it a thumbs-down.

I meant to write a review for this recipe a couple of weeks ago, but I forgot to! We used this recipe on our recent camping trip just a few weeks ago and it was great! We had a large group of fellow campers, so we increased the amount several times. Kids and grownups alike loved this and everybody went for seconds. There were a couple of additions we made to it that I think made it even better. Firstly, we added more chicken. It needed it. Secondly, we brought along some chopped cilantro, ground cumin and ground chili powder. We added medium amounts of these and it was really awesome! We served it along with corn chips, sour cream and grated cheese. This is definately something that would be great to make at home as well. Thanks so much, Terry!

Tastiest soup to ever pour together!  Used two cans cream cx soup, 1 can broth, toms with green chillie's , only drained my black beans, added cumin, red pepper flakes, and cajun seasoning, and WOW is the end result.  Never so impressed with seven CANS of ingrediants in all my days in the kitchen.  Thanks to those who posted such great tips!!

Couldn't be simpler and it is delicious.  Thought it was weird putting it over tortilla chips, but that was perfect.  As others suggested I didn't drain the corn or the tomatoes and used one can of chicken broth instead of two.  Used leftover chicken, but will try with whatever meat I have leftover.

This is the ultimate in easy meals!  It tastes much better than the amount of effort you have to put forth...not a company dish, but certainly great for a family meal.  Must use cheese and Fritos or else it's too watery.  I'll make this many times again!!!!!

Kind of bland.  I added the can of cream of chicken soup and substituted mexi-corn and chopped tomatoes with chili peppers.  Also, tastes better topped with corn chips rather than tortilla chips.  Okay and fast, though.

This is good even when you are just 'camping' in the back yard.  I changed the corn to be the Mexi-corn mix and the 'veg-all' mix for some variations and it was great.  Grilled Cheese (taco cheese) sandwiches are a great accompianment

I was disappointed after reading all of the great reviews. I thought it lacked flavor even though I added cumin. I boiled chicken breasts instead of using canned chicken. It was very quick and easy to put together, though.

We thought this soup was really good, especially considering how easy it was to make!  I used the original Rotel diced tomatoes, and it was definitely spicy!!  I might try something a little milder next time just for personal taste preferences, but I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Excellent! I substituted one can cream of chicken soup for one can chicken broth and used leftover cooked chicken breasts. 

I served it with cheese and tortilla strips on top.  Everyone raved about it!

This is an incredibly easy and delicious soup.  I topped each bowl with crushed tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and a dallop of sour cream.  Next time I'll try adding cilantro.  Yum!

This was so EASY!  I would recomend this recipe to anyone who likes a southwestern flair in their food!  I have given this recipe to 10 family members so far-they all loved it!  I have made this  several times since discovering it, slightly changing it depending on how spicy I was feeling that day!  This one is truly a keeper!

Excellent soup and so easy.  It's incredible.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup in place of 1 can of the broth.  I topped off individual servings with shredded cheddar cheese and had plenty of tortilla chips for dunking. It turned out great.

Great recipe! I added a can of chopped green chiles, about a teaspoon of cumin, and I used fat free chicken broth.  I didn't tell my husband that this was a low-fat dish and was good for him, but he loved it!

I used grilled fresh chicken and added it to the soup - tasted great!  A nice flavor with a tiny kick at the end.  I also topped with some cheddar cheese.  Made great leftovers.  EASY EASY EASY to put together.  This one's a keeper.

This recipe was different and great!  I used rotisserie chicken that had been leftover from the evening before and canned crunchy corn with chiles added.  I, also, added a pinch of cumin and garnished with chopped, green onions.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I cook for husband and pretty-much-grown-up sons and we all really liked it - thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this soup! I "dressed it up" to suit our love of Tex-Mex spicyness. I substituted Green Giant Mexicorn for the plain corn, Rotel Mexican Festival tomatoes for the tomatoes w/green chiles and S&W Regional Recipes Santa Fe Beans for the black beans. I serve it w/shredded pepper jack cheese and crushed tortilla chips on top. They can't get enough of it fixed this way!

This is a great soup starter recipe. I haven't tried it with the cream soup, but I have added about 3-4 cups of tomato juice and everyone really enjoys it. I ususally use fresh chicken and sautee it in garlic. It is even better the next day when all the flavors have come together! I pplan to experiment with other spices and ingredients.

Yum, Yum.  Fast and easy!  Sour cream and some avocado slices on top make it even better!  Try some jalapeno slices for some intense heat!

This was a very good, quick soup.  I had all of the ingredients in my pantry and whipped it up in no time.  My husband preferred it without the chips and added cheddar cheese on top.  I did accidentally forget to drain the corn and the rotel, but it was still delicious.  I will remember next time though.

I Love this soup.  I followed the advice of those before me and used one can of cream of chicken and just one can of broth.  I also used the frozen chopped up fajita flavored chicken, instead of canned.  I threw in some Velveeta to make it creamier, and a little cheesy.  I also added salsa to this soup.  Really good stuff.  Angela

Like other reviewers, I added only 1 can of chicken broth and then 1 can of cream of chicken soup with one can of water.  The canned tomatoes I used weren't really seasoned so I added a powdered garlic, granulated onion, and about 1-2 tsp of taco seasoning.  I also topped with cheese and sour cream.  It was SOO GOOD!!! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Good, easy throw-together-in-minutes soup.  I used diced tomatoes with jalepeno for an added kick.  Also added cumin & chili powder.  Next time might add rice.

Couldn't be easier to make. I sauteed some onion and garlic and added it. Poured over the tortilla chips and with the cheese on top, it's delicious! Next time I'll add some avocado slices. :)

This was a super easy recipe that offered a good base to an eventually terrific Chicken Tortilla soup. Reading the recipe, I got the feeling it was going to be bland. So I added some diced sweet onions and one seasoned chicken beasts (shredded). I then setup various toppings and ingredients for my family to create their own flavorful bowl (I put shredded white queso, sour cream, fresh cilantro, jalapenos and a dash of Zataran's Cajun seasoning on mine).

I make it all the time for food days at work. It is so easy and everyone loves it. 
I don't use canned chicken.  I either use rotisserie chicken or Tyson oven baked pulled chicken (found in frozen foods section).
I also add a packet of taco seasoning. 
I also serve with tortilla chips, cheese, sour cream, and avocados for people to use as toppings.

I use the recipe as is except I take the chicken and heat it up in the bottom of the pot first.  I have taken this recipe and made it 6 times bigger and have taken to church for soup suppers and get asked the recipe every time I take it.

Pretty much everyone  giving  5 stars has made changes. Some that entirely change the recipe as written. As written, it’s ok. Not fantastic, but in a pinch of ‘I gotta feed the kids and don’t have the time Or energy’ it’s ok. Canned chicken, though.... was not a fan (and yes, I purposely bought it just for this recipe because you never know....). While I love suggestions and different ways to make a recipe better or tailor to preferences, I also would like to see reviews that prepared the recipe as is. Otherwise, you are rating your own recipe which defeats the purpose. On that note, it is a halfway decent base for you to work off of and create your very own recipe.

I gave it 2 stars because nobody liked it as is. The next time, I made several changes taken from the reviews and added one of my own, so it's no longer the same recipe. But, my family loves the changes. So what I did was buy rotisserie chicken, strip it down and put meat aside. Boiled the carcass in 4 c water for an hour or so, letting water cook down some. Strained the water into  Dutch oven, added 2 cans cream of chicken and a can of green chopped chilis and a can of creamed corn in addition to recipe. Garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, cumin, 2 pinches cinnamon and 2 pinches of sugar. Lastly added the chicken, shredded up and heated it all to comfortable eating temp. Served with cheddar & cotillo cheeses, tortilla strips and sliced Mexican green onions and some avocado cubes. My son added hot sauce to his bowl. Creamy without being too thick or too soupy. Boiling step can be replaced with canned broth, of course and recipe is still easy peasy; just a bit "eh" (for us) as written.

It was delicious and fast but I added a jar of salsa to it the second time I made it and it really improved the flavor. I also added a can of cream style corn and a regular can because I opened the cream by mistake and all it did was make the soup a little thicker, I liked it better

This is a staple in my family with four growing teenagers!! I quadruple the recipe and usually put it in the crockpot on low  before I leave for the day. I have used frozen, canned and fresh chicken breast in it, sometimes I add onion. We add sour cream, fritos and shredded cheese to the top of our bowls. Love love love it!!

Great starting recipe, i always use baked chicken, more is better &  a large can of creamed chicken soup and half of broth, if you like your soup spicy i have always used one packet Mccormicks Chipotle Taco Seasoning, it has chipoltle chili pepper, smoked paprika, oregano, black pepper, salt & garlic, no other spices needed, taste wonderful. My boyfriend loves it & request i make it frequently in wintertime.

I've made this recipe several times, but with some additions. I don't use canned chicken (why? gross), instead I boil boneless beasts until JUST done, and cube. Used large cream of chicken soup, with the can filled about halfway with water, just to get some water and the soup that won't come out with a spoon into the crock pot. I don't add any broth.  I add chili powder, a little cilantro, salt, pepper, minced garlic, minced died onion, chipotle chili powder,   and adobo seasoning.  My family loves it!  My husband takes the leftovers to work and they request I make it a few times every winter !

Oh gosh....  I never in my life thought I would like this but it seemed very simple and easy so I tried it.  
It was amazing.  Now I've been eating it over all the other soups I made.  It's so delicious and easy to make.  I already got more chicken to make it again.  It will be a staple in my home.

I added a can of Ranch Pintos  with jalapenos not drained.  I did not drain anything but the two cans of corn.  I added three chopped jalapenos.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with onion.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, black pepper and a small amount of salt.  My husband id Mexican and loves it!  First time I made this and this is the first time my husband has raved about anything I have made Mexican.

One of our stand by recipes! To enhance , consider topping with avocado slices, Mexican style cheese, crunched up tortilla chips and even substitute  a roasted chicken  from the deli for canned. It’s a great meal.

I have made this twice now.  The changes I made were to add one can of cream of chicken soup.  Because the can I had was only 10 oz, I also added 20 oz of chicken broth.  This didn't cause the recipe to have too much liquid.  I also chopped up a Rotisserie chicken both times too.  When you have very little time to prepare a meal, this recipe is perfect.  You can start heating all of your ingredients on the stove while you are adding the chicken and it's done in no time.  We never have left overs with this one.

Made this last night for dinner.  It was really good and hubby even commented on it. I did not follow the recipe exactly, but did stick close to it. I did not have canned chicken, used raw chicken breast; did not have canned tomatoes and green chilies together, instead used 1-14.5 ounce can of petite diced tomatoes and 1-4 ounce can of chopped green chilies. Also, since there seemed to be not many seasonings, I added 1-1/2 tablespoons homemade taco seasoning mix from this site. I will definitely make it again. I try to follow a WW diet plan and a "0 points" soup is a big plus.

This was quite good. The best part was how quick and easy it was. I had it on the table in 30 minutes. The only  minor changes I made were that I sautéed 1/2 chopped onion in the pot with cooking spray, added minced garlic, drained the beans and added a bit of salsa and a generous squeeze of lime. I’m on Weight Watchers and this soup is zero smart points. It was tasty, filling, and satisfying. Will definitely make again!

I liked this soup, it was easy and fast, but I used homemade chicken stock and added cumin, chili powder, garlic and onion powder, salt, black pepper and a little oregano to pump up the flavors.

I added the extra seasonings as other reviewers mentioned and it was really good.  I added a can of cream of chicken soup and then mixed in some sour cream  just before serving to make a creamier version and it was really good.

Fast and easy. I did like some of the other reviewers did I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, I didn’t have any cream of chicken soup. I also added a packet of chicken taco seasoning and extra cumin and garlic powder. It was delicious on a cold winter evening.

After reading other reviews, I did make a number of changes to the original recipe. I used a can of Cream of Chicken condensed soup, and one can of low sodium chicken broth. I added a small can of mild green chilies, cumin and chili powder. I served it over rice instead of using tortilla's.  I really do appreciate the recipe posted, and all the added suggestions. This is very much worth adding to a regular rotation.

Super quick and easy.  I love that I can keep all the ingredients for this in the cupboard for a night when there's not a lot of time to cook.  We added sour cream to the cheese garnish.  This tasted good, but made the broth a very strange gray color...  For the first time I've eaten gray soup, I have to say I'm a fan.  Cut back on the broth and it's more like chicken nacho soup -- my kids like that better.

Great concept, but it needs some help in the spice department.  I added a can of cream of chicken soup and used rotisserie chicken instead of canned.  I suggest adding a generous combination of cumin, garlic, salt, chile powder, and whatever else sounds good to you.  I also added a dollop of sour cream and grated cheese to the serving bowl.  It was very good after the additions!  Crushed tortilla chips would have been good, too, but I didn't have any.

This one's a keeper at my house. I substituted ranch style beans for the black beans, added some garlic and onion powder and pepper. It was great! Best thing about it was that I didn't have to go to the store for anything.

I made mine in a pot instead of the slow cooker. Cooked the chicken thighs with olive oil and a bit of chicken broth until tender enough to shred. Then added all the ingredients plus a can of drained and rinsed black beans. I will definitely make this again.

It was so quick, however, I used pulled chicken breast, fresh cilantro, and cream of chicken soup. I also added cumin, garlic, and other spices. Topped with cheese, avocado, squeeze of lime juice, and tortilla strips... and just like that fiesta magic!

First of all I would give it five stars for as easy as it was, and it is delicious. Took everyone else’s advice and added cream of chicken soup cumin, chili powder I also added minced garlic rather than garlic powder and some cute pasta noodles. I used a can of Rotel. Since I added the noodles I added the second can of chicken broth and I used two cans of cream of chicken soup. I didn’t have regular roasted chicken on hand so I did use the can chicken and it was every bit as good. Pretty positive this will be a big hit and anyone else who tries. Will definitely be making this again cold day.

Doesn't get any easier.  Canned Diced Tomatoes and Chopped Green Chilies (RO-TEL works really well here) really give it a nice kick.  Can add chopped jalapenos, too!

I made this exactly as listed the first time. For as easy as it is, this is a great recipe.  4 stars exactly as listed.  Top with crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheese to make it even better.  The second time I added a can of hominy and half a pack of taco seasoning mix and used shredded rotisserie chicken and it was 5 stars!  Seriously it doesn’t get easier than this and it is very good.  This is excellent for fall camping trips.  Nothing to refrigerate.  Bring cans and a can opener and a pot to put over the fire and you are set!!!

I have made a version of this for years that is super delicious and I carry it everywhere we have a pot luck.  A few changes to make - instead of canned corn use a small bag of frozen corn and instead of Rotel use a dip size jar of your favorite chunky salsa.  Add regular size can of unsalted refried beans as your "thickening" and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  Put in crock pot until corn is thawed and warmed through (on high for an hour is what I do).  Serve with tortilla scoops and sprinkle grated cheese on top.

Augmented with a lot of fresh veggies, peppers/onions/ garlic and some spices but overall a great start to a great soup.

Super easy. It can be made as is it easily fancied up. I added Goya seasoning and a lot of cilantro and let the crock pot do the rest. As a graveyard shift worker with two teens it’s recipes like this that help me feed my girls while asleep. They crunched up tortilla chips on top and added some Monterey Jack. I ate some at work for the next two nights. Tasty little dish.

I have made this two times but so long in between that I forgot how bland it turned out.  Added garlic and cumin.  The cheese and sour cream make it lots better, especially with Dorito chips.

Close - but way too bland. I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and, along with the ingredients in this recipe, added a can of regular Rotel, a pkg of taco seasoning,  a can of diced tomatoes, 2 more cans of black beans and some diced green chilies. Served with shredded cheese, sour cream and chips it is so easy and super yummy!

So easy!  I did substitute one can of cream of chicken in place of one of the chicken broth cans and added garlic, cumin, paprika and some cayenne pepper.  I simmered for about 2 hours and got a nice, thick consistency.  Delicious!

I made it according to the instructions except I only used one half of the beans (tender digestive systems here)  and one half of the tomatoes.  I bought the tomatoes with chilies in a medium hot strength and they were pretty strong! The way I made it still had great flavor and was a hit!  The tortilla chips on top added a nice touch and were really good in the soup.

As you'd expect from something made entirely of canned goods, this was just "okay." It could have used more seasoning- the green chilies didn't add much heat, and none of the other ingredients had any kind of seasoning in them. I also think that, although the recipe wasn't largely hurt by being made from canned foods, the chicken did fall a little flat because it wasn't as fresh. But it does get points for being easy to make, quick, and cheap.

I will definitely make this again, but would definitely recommend adding spices as mentioned by others. I tasted it before  adding  and it was very bland, but it's a good base and so easy! Very comforting on a cold night.

I’ve made this several times per the recipe with only minor adjustments.  I don’t completely drain the tomatoes and green chilies and I use chicken base to make my chicken broth.  Great soup for a quick lunch.  In fact I’m making some today for a relative who just had surgery.

This was a winner but the first thing you learn by reading the other reviews is that this recipe forms the base and from there you need to get creative.  I substituted the condensed cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of chicken broth, like others have.  For the other can, I used about 20 oz. of broth.  I seasoned the soup with a teaspoon of chili seasoning that I made from another Allrecipes recipe.  You will find that one listed under Chili Seasoning Mix II.  Lastly, I topped each bowl of soup with tortilla strips when I served them.

Way way too bland - no flavor! No seasonings listed in recipe. The combination is good but needs taco seasoning added at least or Mexican Style Tomatoes or something! No where to be found: Tortillas!  To make again I would add taco seasoning and serve with tortilla strips on top at least to legitimize the title. It is a fast & ez dish though. Just flavorless.

We make this but add a can of cheddar soup, onions, and lime juice. People beg us to make this. We also shred the can chicken and add spices. It is one of our favorite go to recipes. You can even take a tortilla cut it into strips with a pizza cutter and drop it into oil for a few seconds and make crispies to go into the soup.

Use Rotel with cilantro; half a rotisserie chicken; 1 cup frozen corn; add 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, cumin & garlic power.   Add a tablespoon of lime juice at the end and top with tortilla chips.

Absolutely delicious! Following the advice of many reviewers, I used rotisserie chicken rather than canned, swapped one can of chicken broth with cream of chicken, and amply seasoned the soup with chili powder, cumin and black pepper. For a great finishing touch, add some lime juice! That really gives it a kick. This is hard to beat for ease, cost and flavor.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers.  I used hot rotel, one can cream of chicken soup, added 1 tsp garlic, 1 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp chili powder, and added 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar.  Served with grilled tortillas.  It was the best soup I've ever made.

We really enjoyed this soup; however, for our tastes I did add a pinch of cumin and a pinch of cinnamon asxwdll as 1 tsp of cocoa . These are ingredients are ones I always use in my chili recipe. The cocoa adds some richness to the soup. Will definitely  make this again.

This was a quick and easy soup. If you leave out the chicken and are loose about the chicken broth, it can be a vegetarian dish.

Next time I am adding some sauted bell pepper, onion, and celery to add more vitamins and bulk to it. It was very good.

This was easy and great.  I think that it will be even better reheated. ( It reminds me of Girl Scout Soup. Cans of soup but no creamed.  I always brought a can of beef onion.)  I may try a few changes but will wait to do it each time I make this.  Thanks

I doubled the recipe so I used a box of low sodium chicken stock and two cans of Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup.  To the mix I added one tsp. chili powder, one tsp. garlic powder, 1-1/2 tsps paprika, 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp cilantro.  Instead of canned chicken I bought a rotisserie chicken, removed the bones and put the whole thing in the pot. The black beans, whole kernel corn and Ro-Tel tomatoes were drained and rinsed before adding to the soup.  I let the soup simmer on the stove for awhile stirring occasionally.  When served I had shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream and plain tortilla chips to put in the soup.  It was delicious!!  My husband loved it.  Next time I might try it with some avocado added.  Easy AND great tasting.

Delicious.  However I made a few changes.  I used plain diced tomatoes and added a packet of chicken taco seasoning for flavor.  I added a can of red kidney beans for variety, and rinsed both the red and black beans before adding them to the mix.  Minor changes, but I think they made it much better.

Easy base but to bland for us.  Added some spices and extra can of corn.  Served with fresh chopped onions which some guests said that did the trick.

Yes, I made a few changes and it was fantastic.  Turned into a very hearty meal. Instead of canned corn, use frozen (I believe it was a 10oz bag).  Use can of diced tomatoes (I used the kind without chile peppers), but then I added 3/4 of a regular jar of mild Picante salsa.  Use 2 cans of chunk chicken instead of 1 (Kirkland/COSTCO brand works really well!).  Be sure to rinse the can of black beans.   Add garlic to taste.  Garnish top with shredded cheese and avocado when serving.  Serve tortilla chips on the side.  **Try to purchase as many low-sodium items as possible to be health-conscious!

This was simple and my kids,  while didn't find visually appealing,  ate and enjoyed.  I did swap the second can of broth for condensed can of chicken.  I also drained and rinsed the black beans, and added 2 tablespoons of cornmeal at the end.

I love soup and if it is easy to make, it is a real bonus! This was sooo easy. However, I admit I made a few changes as suggested by others. I pan seared thin sliced chicken breasts in butter and olive oil and cut them up. I added cumin and chili powder to my taste (about 1 tsp cumin and 1 TBSP of chili powder. I happened to have Rotel with cilantro and lime and used that. Maybe the can chicken works, but I thought fresh chicken might be better. Rotisserie chicken would also make it easier. This will become a go-to soup for me!

Loved the soup.  So did all I served this to.  Made adjustments as others suggested in the reviews.  BUT ... This is what I always do.  I find a recipe that looks good, print it, read the reviews and make notes on the printed copy.  Then make it.  Thanks for the Recipe.

Had to make so many changes so no rating I give is fair.  Started the soup without checking my pantry[big mistake for a very seasoned cook] but don't laugh...I had to use canned chili con carne for the beans as well as spice changes and stewed tomatoes that were available.  Crazy yeah!  but was delish with use of rotsserie chicken, canned corn and tortilla strips. Shows what can be done in a pinch!!!

Recipe needs seasonings of choice. Sautéed a finely chopped onion and two Cloves of  garlic. Added  a drained can  of diced tomatoes and two tablespoons  of tomato paste; simmered  until thick.  Added 14 ounces of chicken stock and one can(no water) of cream of chicken soup. Added cooked rotisserie chicken . Simmered to blend flavors.  Added corn and a can of pinto beans instead of black beans.  Heated through for about 10 minutes. Garnishes that were used individually: smoked paprika, smoked salt, ground pepper, pepper flakes and tortilla chips. We skipped the cheese to cut down on dairy.

Great but I did modify  a lot.  I used grilled chicken breast.
Used one can fire roasted tomatoes and a can of green chilies.
One chopped fresh jalapeno and
Very generously used cumin and chili powder.
Served with avocado and cilantro.
Will be using this recipe always.  Quick and super good

I've made this several times with some differences that go with my families preferences . I add cumin and chili powder and use kidney beans instead black beans. Also, I add a can of cream of chicken soup to make it creamier. Before I add the chicken, I sautee some onions and garlic with the chicken to give the chicken some flavor.  I top the bowls off with a dollop of sour cream, tortilla chip pieces, and shredded cheese.  In the winter I also serve this with corn muffins.  My family loves soup night! So easy and perfect for a busy week night  meal.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes!  I make this often with only a couple of minor changes.  I substitute a can of cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of chicken broth, and I drain and wash the black beans.  It's so easy to make when you need to throw something together in a snap!

Good starting recipe, but as others have said, you need to mess with it. 

First, use low sodium versions of everything here, if possible. There'll be plenty of salt in it. DO NOT substitute cream of chicken soup. Rather, stir in a cup of shredded monterey jack cheese when the soup is hot. Definitely add a good shake or two of garlic powder, at least a tsp. of cumin, and top with some cilantro. Chile powder is up to you, or some Chipotle Tabasco is a good add for some spice. Provide cut like wedges for squeezing when serving.

Trader Joe's gives out an identical version of this recipe with a notable exception-- a jar of one of their salsas instead of simple tomatoes.

I use tomatillo salsa and fresh grilled chicken. I also use super sharp cheese diced in small cubes. Garnish with chips, fresh snipped green onion and avocado slices, and it's quite good.

I have made a very similar version of this soup for years now and each time I swear it tastes better.  It's an easy, quick and cheap family meal.  However, I use a jar of salsa instead of the Rotel and it just seems to add a little extra flavor.  I have used both canned and fresh chicken and I like the fresh chicken better, but that is a personal preference.  When using fresh I do not add any chicken broth as I just use what I boiled the chicken in.  Add some sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips and OH MY it's a great meal.

As is, it's good. I give it 5 stars after adding an extra can of chicken and also added some cumin and chili powder. Fantastic and soooo easy! UPDATE:  this time I followed the additions from the most popular review and it was even better than the first time! I used 2 cans of chicken again.

Followed a lot of other suggestions and it was amazing. Here is a summary of my changes. Used rotisserie chicken (1 leg and half breast with no skin). Subbed one can of cream of chicken soup. Used seasoned black beans, rinsed. Added chili powder, cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes. When served, I added a little shredded low fat Mexican blend cheese and santa fe tortilla strips (salad topper). Great meal on the first cool night headed into fall.

After adopting many of the suggestions in previou reviews I cooked 2 medium chicken breast in the chicken broth. Once cooked I strained and reserved the broth into a glass 4 c. measuring cup. After sauteing onion and garlic for about 3 minutes I stiirred in  cumin, chili powder briefly. I added the broth, canned black beans, sliced black olives, the tomato/chlies, corn,  juice from half of a lime and chopped cilantro. After simmering for about 10 minutes I added the cooked chicken, coarsley shredded. Simmer another 5 minutes.  Garnishes of sour cream, avacado,
cilantro and lime to choose from in addition to  cheese quesadillas on the side. Thanks to everyone for the original recipe and suggestions!

I call this Taco Soup and make  with 2 cans of Black Beans, 2 cans of  chopped tomatoes and chilis, and 2 cans of whole kernel corn.  I also add cumin, chili, garlic powder and red pepper flakes. I don't add chicken broth. The only thing I drain is the cans of corn.

This was flavorless.  The basic ingredients are needed but add a little lime juice, chili powder, cilantro, mexican oregano, and salt, THEN you have a great canned almost-homemade chicken tortilla soup.

I love that its a good base for whatever direction one wants to go.  I only had one can of broth so i used a can of chicken rice then added more cooked rice. I also used a jar of salsa to get more of a tomato base and to add more seasoning since Im not much of a cook and  don't have a lot of spices on hand.  (Why do you think im looking for recipes from cans?!)  Im already thinking of next batch..going italian with italian seasoned tomatoes a can of minestrone some cooked pasta and......

This soup comes together so quckly with things I nearly always have in the pantry.  Here is what I do differently:  I start by sautéeing onion and garlic in oil or bacon grease, then add the ingredients to the pot.  I add a can of kidney beans in addition to the black beans, add about two tablespoons of tomato paste (I use the kind in the tube), ground oregano, ground chipotle pepper, ground cumin, salt, pepper and a bay leaf.  I fry tortilla strips while it's simmering and then garnish with the chips and a dollop of sour cream.  Sometimes I get fancy and add cilantro and diced red onion for garnish.

I will make this again!  I wanted a recipe for chicken soup using canned chicken as I had a can of Kirkland chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Trader Joe's Cuban Style Black Beans, which are spicy and I added a generous shake of red pepper flakes.  I think it is delicious!

love this soup! I prefer using one can of cream of chicken soup with one can of broth, and of course roasted or rotisserie chicken instead of canned. Add a dash of chili powder to make it a little more interesting :)

Yes I will make again! I made it because I needed something quick for this cold windy night. It was easy and quick, and very tasty as well! I don't like too much heat so I didn't use the green chilis in the tomatoes. I used a brand of diced tomatoes that said chili ready. Then served with baked corn tortilla strips and sour cream. Delicious!

Delicious! I added my own twist to this soup; 
1 box chicken broth,  1 can cream of chicken soup.  I used a rotisserie chicken. I also added a ranch packet and taco seasoning packet,  garlic and onion powder and chili powder.  I also added a chicken bullion cube and a small can of tomato sauce. This soup was delicious!

I substituted 1/2 broth with Cream of Chicken soup. I added cumin and chili powder and garlic powder. I didn't use can chicken. I used meat from a roast chicken. Just before serving, I squeezed lime and hot sauce on top, then topped it with avocado mixed with sour cream.

Great for a quick meal after homeschooling all day.  Added about 2 T. more of canned chopped green chilis and one more can of chicken..  Added garlic salt to my homemade chicken broth.  Quick.  Kids liked to dip the chips in the soup.

My family's favorite and so easy! I substituted canned chicken for precooked chicken fajita strips. I also added a chopped onion and garlic. Depending on the audience I'll add some jalapeños. Top with avocado and sour cream! You really can't make it wrong... Fabulous recipe!

Made it vegan and it was delicious.   Replace chicken broth with vegetable broth or stock.  Add beans & vegetables.  Replace chicken with mushrooms & avocado, but do not add directly to the broth.  Lightly sauté thick sliced baby bella mushrooms and place several in the bottom of individual soup bowls.  Add several slices of avocado.  Ladle warmed soup into bowl.  Enjoy this variation OR make as written in the original recipe.  We thoroughly enjoy both!

I double this recipe and exchange the canned chicken for a 22 oz frozen bag of diced chicken chunks, I add some diced onion, fresh minced garlic, ground cumin and salt to taste.  I also garnish with fresh avocado, cilantro, shredded cheese, sour cream and serve along side a cheese quesadilla.

I doubled the recipe so I had leftovers. First taste, it needed help for sure, added in SSCHULTE14's suggestions of Red Chili Pepper, garlic, cumin, cilantro. Then i added in some black pepper and onion. Cooked it for a long while to flavor everything in and boil out the excess water and to soften the onion and break the cilantro down after adding them in so late to the cooking process.

I love the base of this recipe. But I made a lot of changes. I double everything. I use boiled chicken, shredded. I rinse my black beans. I add Rotel. I don't use chicken broth.
So just chicken, corn, black beans, rotel, green chili's, and green enchilada sauce (big cans) and top with sour cream and those tortilla straps in the salad topping aisle.
My 4 year old eats 2 or more bowls.

I did add extra spices.  I have also made this using shredded beef and rice that was left over from making burritos.  Delicious.

This is a great base recipe. However, I roast my own boneless/skinless chicken breast in olive oil and Weber's Kickin Chicken spice. The Kickin chicken adds an extra punch of flavor. I also add some fresh cilantro. Topping make this soup a lot of fun too and gives layers of taste and texture! I add tortilla strips, chopped green onions, & a pinch of shredded cheddar.

I love this recipe and am always asked for the recipe, as others have done I use one or two cans of cream of chicken with one can of chicken broth.  I have also used a can of creamed corn in a pinch when I didn't have cream of chicken soup.

This recipe turned out great in a slow cooker! I doubled the recipe and replaced one can of broth with a can of cream of chicken soup. Then I added all of the ingredients (minus the canned tomatoes) plus a diced red bell pepper, diced red onion, minced jalapeño, chile powder, fresh chopped cilantro, juice from one lime, and raw chicken breasts. I let it cook on low for about 5 hours and then took the chicken breasts out and shredded them. I returned it to the crock pot, added the tomatoes, and it was a huge hit! A perfect amount of spice.

Made as written and not that impressed.  Thought it was bland and lacking something.  Would use as a base to expand upon .  Will try again but add an onion and other stuff .

I love this recipe!  I like to add a little additional cumin andchili power & smoke paprika to add some additional flavor.  Try adding a splash of lime juice too - and don't forget to garnish with cilantro.

I was a little concerned about this recipe  because of all of the canned ingredients however I decided to go ahead and try it.  I followed the instructions. . I however drained the black beans,  and added a little lime juice and added a few sprigs of cilantro. .
This was so quick and easy, I could hardly believe it.  I absolutely love it  
My family thought it was fantastic 
This is going to be a regular dish in my home. 
Advice.. we only have 4 in our home  and I have a decent amount of leftovers. . 
This is a positive thing in my home...

This recipe was a good start but I'm glad I read everyone's reviews. I added what others suggested plus since I had extra velveeta cheese I added that too. Not a lot to take a way the soup taste. Great suggestion on adding avocados. Next time I'm getting sour cream. Honestly this recipe you can just add what ever you wanted as long as you season to taste and the cream of chicken helps.

Mine turned out great, made some adjustments to the recipe for sure but in the end it was great, quick, and easy. 
I used 2 cans of rotel, or diced tomatoes, added another can of beans, I believe they were pinto beans, added salt, pepper, lots of lime juice, cumin, and several other spices. Used 1 can of chicken broth, and instead of canned chicken I chopped up 1.5 lbs of chicken and cooked it on the stove top in a pan, added real garlic, salt, pepper, etc to this chicken. Put it all together and it was great!

I followed the recipe but used leftover shredded chicken, frozen corn, plain diced tomatoes and added some medium salsa because that's what I had on hand. I topped each bowl with crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheese. My husband and I love it!

I finally made something my husband adores!  He's a better cook so I don't cook often, but he loved this one,  with changes.  My changes:  I used creamed corn and cream of chicken,  along with chicken stock.  I don't know why people added their own spices when you can just add a taco seasoning packet.  That's all it needs.  The chilies in the Rotel gave it enough spice for me,  but some folks who don't like spice will want to use the Rotel without chilies.

So I LOVE this, but with some changes. I use left over roasted chicken- canned is just gross. But really, as a base recipe, there is a lot you can do with this to bring out the flavours you like.

I am only giving it 4 stars because I did make some changes.  Based on the reviews of others, I used 1 can broth and 1 can soup, which gave it a really nice consistency.  I also added some fresh cilantro, minced garlic,cumin, chili powder, chipotle powder, cayenne pepper and lime juice.  I didn't measure any of them, just did it to taste.  I also added brown rice to it.  I let the soup cook on low on the stove for quite a few hours and then added the rice in about 30 minutes before eating.  I didn't have any tortilla chips, but I wish I did, the salty crunch would have made it perfect.  So, as a *BASE* recipe, I do give this a 5, but because I had to make so many changes, I could only give it a 4.

***ETA - I used fresh, shredded chicken instead of canned, and I ended up adding another can of broth because the rice sucked up so much moisture.

I added cilantro, cumin, fresh garlic, and a little chipotle chili powder.  It lacked depth and I didn't have any cream of chicken soup so I made a roux and added that.  I took 5 Tb. butter and melted it.  To the melted butter I added 5 Tb flour and stirred it well.  I then added 1 can of green enchilada sauce to the roux and stirred until blended and thicken.  I added the blended roux to the soup and it's marvelous!

This recipe is so good, and could not be simpler!  As others have said, you need to add seasoning.  I add seasoning salt, garlic powder, cumin, and chili powder.  I also top with cilantro, sliced avocado, and crushed tortilla chips.

Amazing! Super fast! Followed the suggestions of the previous reviewers by subbing one can of cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of broth, and added garlic powder, cumin, chili pepper. Had this with garlic baguette. Delicious and a lifesaver recipe when you're short on time.

I use 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can chicken broth for a little bit thicker soup.  You must add garlic powder and cumin for it to have some flavor.  Make it at work frequently and it's a favorite of every ones.

As others have said, this soup needs some doctoring.  I have been making my version of this soup for about 15 years.  Once doctored it is a fantastic 5 stars!  I replace one of the cans of broth with condensed cream of chicken soup.  I add about 2/3'rds of a packet of taco seasoning (more or less to your taste) and use rotisserie chicken in replacement for the canned chicken.  I also replace the canned corn with a can of mexicorn.  I don't drain anything.  I empty the entire can into the pot, add as much shredded rotisserie chicken as I desire, and heat it through.  I serve it over thick, crunchy tortilla chips (such as Mission brand chips), then top with grated cheese, a dollop of sour cream and sliced black olives and/or avocado, if desired.  Awesome!  If I double the recipe for a larger group, I replace one of the cans of black beans with dark red kidney beans.  I keep all of the canned ingredients and chips as staples in my pantry.  I also keep sour cream in the fridge and a shredded rotisserie chicken in a Zip lock bag in my freezer.  I can throw together an amazing meal that tastes like I cooked all day in just 20 minutes!

It certainly doesn't get any easier than this!  I added a packet of Goya seasoning and it was perfect for the whole family. Not too spicy for the kids. My husband and I added tortilla chips, cheddar cheese, and sour cream into our bowls upon serving. It was just right.

Good recipe but did need the chips to thicken the meal.  I tried again using fresh chicken breast browned with garlic and onion first. Rather than canned corn and black beans I found a frozen fiesta mix of corn, black beans and some peppers. I cut the seasonings out and used half a pack of taco seasoning (seemed logical with the tortilla chips) instead. . I also added a can of small white beans mashing half for a thickener.  Was great with or without chips. This recipe actually became the base for my mexican chicken chili.

I didn't believe something this easy could be this tasty too!  I followed the other reviewers' comments and added a dash of cumin, a dash of chili powder, and a healthy dash of garlic salt.  I used the canned chicken, which wasn't bad, I think I might try rotisserie next time.  DH loved it.  the kids ate it, lol.  I had "mexican blend" shredded cheese for the top.  It was a perfect meal for tonight when it was unseasonably cool and I had had a rough day.

5 stars for taste and ease! And the recipe is so flexible, you can really make it however you want. I added some extra flavor as others suggested - about 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp cumin and 1 1/2 tsp chili powder. Squeezed in lime juice at the finish and topped it with some diced avocado and shredded cheese. Yum! I loved how when we served it over the chips they get all mushy and impart a tortilla flavor to the whole soup.

It's a little spicy.  I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken and added that in place of the canned chicken. The tortilla chips are a must!  Cheese and sour cream and it's delicious.

This was a quick and easy recipe, as promised. Like others, I made changes. I drained the corn, beans and tomatoes. Couldn't get the tomatoes with green chiles, so substituted with green peppers and onions added. I added about ½ tbs of cumin and garlic powder and 1 heaping tbs of chili powder. A little salt and pepper as well. I chopped up some jarred jalapeños, but next time I might make sure I don't put in quite as many, or don't put the seeds in -- the family thought it was a bit too spicy. I didn't have any cream of chicken soup, so didn't add it. Didn't add any cheese. Cut up some flat bread with a pizza wheel, as suggested, making tortilla "sticks."  I fried some diced chicken in garlic butter and added it to the soup. Simmered on low for too short a time, but we were hungry! Anyway, my daughter ate it up and the DH had seconds. A winner for us! Thanks for the recipe!

It's awesome although I changed the can chicken to rotisserie chicken. Only one box broth with one large can cream chicken and small can of fiesta soup. Add some cilantro, cumin , garlic , chili powder. Topped with Texas toast tortilla strips . And sour cream.  My kids devoured it!

Great soup. The family loved it. I doubled the recipe making enough for leftovers. Instead of using canned chicken, I used three boneless chicken breast, BBQ them before putting into the pan with other ingredients. Added a tsp of chili pepper and salt.

This was a great easy soup recipe. I took advice of others and used 1 can broth and 2 cans cream of chicken soup.  Also added 1/2 tsp of oregano and cumin.  Used frozen precooked diced chicken and frozen corn.  Yum! This made 3 adult servings.

This was really good. I took the advice of another user and used a cooked chicken that I had de-boned as well as a can of condensed chicken broth. Next time I'll boil the entire chicken so that it falls off and makes it own broth. I also added cumin and chili powder. It was really yummy!

We love this soup! Except for the chicken broth, I had everything in the pantry already! I added lots of chili powder, garlic powder, all seasonings mix and used a can of creamed corn. It was great! Next time I'm using diced cooked chicken and minced garlic. Maybe I'll try adding a bit of half-and-half, too!

I make a similar recipe but use a grocery store rotisserie chicken & a big jar of picante sauce.  Like others have mentioned it needs some cumin & red pepper flakes to spice it up & my kids like it best with a jar of queso cheese dip added.  We garish it with a dollop of sour cream & some tortilla chips crushed on top of each bowl.

This recipe is ok, but I like to  add diced tomatoes instead of rotel and add 1pkg of taco seasoning. I serve it with cheese on top and  tortillas on the side for dipping. Yum!

I add another pantry staple to the soup, a pkg. or two of dry ranch dressing mix since I can't do wheat. Makes it creamier and adds to the flavor.

Loved it! Sounds too easy to be true, has just the right amount of kick. I use leftover rotisserie chicken instead of canned chicken.

3 stars as is, 4 with doctoring.  Cumin, Chili Powder, Garlic and Onion Powder, S&P. I let mine simmer for about an hour covered.  Top with sour cream and cheddar.  Very good considering how quick and easy it is.

Yes, as other reviewers said- doctor it up. I used one can of low sodium broth, one can lower sodium cream of broccoli soup and one can mild red enchilada sauce (add more broth or water to get desired consistency). If ya have time add some sautéed onions and grated carrots. So many different vege's you could add depending on growing season.

This is a good basic recipe to add on to or adjust. I usually use a rotisserie chicken and fresh tomatoes, but stick with the canned black beans, corn, and chilies- Or leave out the chilies completely. I then add more seasonings like a previous reviewer said to do- cumin, chili powder, a little cayenne, salt, pepper, etc. Top it with tortilla chips, cheese, and sour cream. It's a simple and quick recipe for week nights.

This recipe has two great things going for it: it's quick and easy. Based on the suggestions of previous reviewers, I used two cans of cream of chicken soup and one soup can of chicken broth. I also used mexican corn, drained the black beans and used crushed garlic. My husband came home from a long day at work and this soup was on simmer on the stove and he was so happy! He took the little bit we had leftover for lunch. Great, great recipe!

Granted, as written the soup lacks some things, hence my 4-star rating. 

This is what I did... rinsed the beans but added the Rotel and the corn including the water from the cans.  I also added 1 chicken breast half, 1 TBS of chili powder and 1 tsp of cumin along with 1/2 C of minced onion, 3 cloves of minced garlic (onion and garlic were sautéed before adding, 1 TBS chopped cilantro and 1 tsp of Mexican oregano.   After the cooking time of 15 or so minutes I shredded the chicken and returned to the pot.  I garnished with tortillas, cheese, and fresh cilantro.  Not watery, just good.  Also if you desire some creaminess add a dollop of sour cream to your bowl.  A 300% improvement for 5 minutes more of prep time... well worth it.

Again like others have said its a good base or a quick good soup I know its all canned but its better than the canned version of the same soup. I do agree to make tweaks I used 32 oz of broth, frozen corn, and added garlic and cilantro then a dollop of sour cream and cheese and jalapeno kettle chips. I used great value brand canned chicken the applewood smoked flavor. I agree if I have time in the future to use cooked chicken.

I thought this tasted okay. It was kind of on the thin side though. I don't care for tomatoes with peppers in them, so I just added a can of plain diced. To flavor it I added about 2 tsp of taco seasoning and a good pinch of garlic powder. I can't imagine the rotel style tomatoes making this much thicker. It would be best with topping, tortilla strips, cheese, avacadoes, etc., to give it more bulk.

YES!!! Thanks Terryn for a great recipe.  Like others, I tweaked to our taste.  Exchanged one can of broth for a can of fat free cream of chicken soup. Exchanged black beans for pinto beans - thats what I had on hand. Started with diced onions, celery, and green bell pepper sauteed til soft in EVOO (about a cup total of the mirepoix).  Had two huge cooked chicken breasts in fridge, so diced those. Thanks to others, I topped with monterey jack cheese, sour cream, and avocado. Also had limes - we love those - And made some Mexican corn bread.
Quick, Easy and oh so creamy good. Look forward to a bowl (only one leftover!) for lunch tomorrow. Thanks again, Terryn.

This was great! I used a roasted, store-bought chicken, which I shredded, added some chopped green onions, a handful of fresh cilantro, and chili powder and ground cumin to taste. I served it with Monterey Jack cheese and tortilla strips (tossed in cooking spray) baked in the oven until crispy. Even my picky non-vegetable-eating daughter liked it! Thanks for this great, easy recipe and for the suggestions from other users!

I made some substitutions to this recipe. I used dark red kidney beans, diced tomatoes without the chilies, and I also picked up a rotisserie chicken (based on the advice of another reviewer). I added a can of corn and two cans of chicken broth. This soup is quick and easy to make, a perfect weeknight supper.

Great base to start with.  Like others to reduce the salt I use rotisserie chicken, frozen corn, rinse my beans and add some more spice.  Instead of adding a can of condensed soup I simply add some cream. Canned soup has lots of sodium, so this is one more thing to keep that down. Sometimes I'll throw in some extras like olives or green chilis. I know this is a lot of changes, but I never follow a recipe verbatim.  Make it your own!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I'm planning to make this soup for about 200 people next week, so the fact that everything comes from a can makes increasing the serving amount super easy. I tested out the recipe and found that the only thing I added to give it some extra flavor was a packet of taco seasoning. Fast, simple, and awesome flavor. It's also super cheap. I'm a college student, so I bought the generic version of every ingredient and my friends said it was awesome :) I think next time I'll serve it with cilantro rice in the bottom of the bowl for an added starch.

Most delicious tortilla soup I've ever had and it's SO simple! This is a must try. Added cilantro, red pepper, green onion, and tomato that I had in the fridge. Topped mine off by mixing a spoon of sour cream into my bowl and adding a pile of tortilla chips that I just crushed into my soup as I went along. Will definitely be making this again and again. Lifelong recipe!!

Fantastic recipe!  I doctored this a bit...I combined the listed ingredients, along with with extra roasted chicken breast (leftover from fried chicken), a jar of roasted red peppers (chopped), some chopped jalepenos from a jar,sauteed minced onion, and one can of cream of chicken soup in place of one can of broth.  I did rinse the beans to keep from discoloring the broth.  I also added some chili powder, cumin, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I combined the ingredients the night before in a saucepan but did not heat...simply put in the fridge for the flavors to marry.  Heated the next day for about 30 minutes.  Garnished with fresh avocado and toasted corn tortilla slivers.  Thanks!!

It's a good base recipe but I like more kick and dimensions of flavor so I replaced the canned chicken with 2 chicken breast that I cooked in the crockpot on high with a fajita seasoning and chicken broth (about 1 cup) to keep it from burning.  Then I shredded the chicken when it was done (about 1-2 hours depending on if you use whole breasts or chop them up a bit first.  The whole are easier to shred).  I then added all the other ingredients to the same crockpot and let it cook for another hour or so.  I like to use seasoned black beans and corn with peppers if I have them on hand in place of the plain ones.  Then I top it with fresh cilantro and toasted tortilla strips I baked up in the oven, and a little cheddar.

Yes!  EZ and delish!  I love it and so does everyone who tastes it.  I have gone thru pots(and many cans)of this soup and still they clamor for more!  I'm so happy it's so inexpensive to make repeatedly.

I poured the soup over tortilla strips which helped the taste of the soup. Needed some salt / seasoning. But super easy!

Wow! Talk about easy! I was out of corn, so I used hominy, and it was just as delicious! I added some spices to give it a little more flavor.  Will definitely make this again!

I love how easy and cheap this recipe is.  Even better my husband loved it more than a different version I make of this soup.  I did use a rotissere chicken and add a few tablespoons of taco seasoning and used cilantro & lime rotel tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a simple, easy, tasty soup recipe, which requires little time or effort. Still, it offers a sophisticated, wonderful taste, which doesn't really need any embellishment. I have several other similar allrecipe recipes in my recipe box, but this one is--by far--the easiest to prepare.

I gave this a 4 because I think it would have been ok as written but I followed other suggestions and added chili powder and it made it way too spicey.  The diced tomatoes with green chile peppers probably would have been enough heat.

This was the easiest soup I ever made, and as others posted it was a base it did need a few things, first I don’t care for canned veggies, so I used frozen corn, peas and a few black beans I happen to have in the freezer. I shopped at Costco and bought the rotisserie chicken and shredded some of the meat to use in the soup. It was perfect… I also seasoned it with cumin, seasoned pepper and salt.  You can use any veggies you like in this soup there’s no wrong way of doing it. I topped it with corn tortilla strips, shredded cheese and avocado. 
It was fast and easy… Thanks for sharing……..

I think this a great recipe especially since it was quick and easy!  I used leftover rotisserie chicken from the store and used half chicken broth, half cream of chicken.  I also spiced it up with cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  My 4 year old (who is very picky) is eating it with no complaints, so I consider that a success!  :)

Recipe was very good.  Very similar to a chicken taco.  I used one can cream of chicken, on can chicen stock, and made a cup of chicken stock from bullion.  I boiled one 1/3 cup onion in the bullion before adding it to the recipe.  I cut the chili powder in half since my wife does not like foods too spicy.  I would have loved the 2 tsp.  I added 1/3 cup sour cream to the recipe to add a little flavor and thickening.  Also I boiled a couple breasts and shredded them instead of using the canned chicken.  Will try adding a little red pepper and minced garlic next time, and probably the extra tsp of chili powder.  The whole family thought it was great.

Yummy, fast, and nothing is easier.  I did substitute a can of cream of chicken for one of the broths, and used mild tomatoes with chilis as my little ones like the milder flavor.

this was an AWESOME recipe, so easy and quick to make!! a good variation was to add one cup of brown rice (and simmer for 20-30 min) which made it very filling and more like a chili with a spoonfully of sour cream. definately recommend it for a health meal that tastes anything but... mmm... i would have added a photo but me and my falmily ate it all before we could :D

So easy and good.  I don't usually review unless I've made the recipe as written but since I only changed one ingredient, I'll go ahead.  We do not like black beans in my house, but I had dark red kidney beans so I used that.  I am going to make this again, trying it with the cream of chicken soup.  Also, the next time I buy a rotisserie chicken I'll be using the leftovers for this soup.  Thanks for a keeper!

Notice this has over a thousand reviews.  I make it constantly.  I always add chopped garlic and cilantro.  I have tried various chicken instead of the can, but best are supermarket cooked chicken or chicken breast cut up.  Whole raw chicken is not worth the trouble. I love it and you do not need additional seasoning other than the garlic and the cilantro unless you like to add a little hot sauce.  You can at the end add grated cheddar cheese on top and a teaspoon of sour cream in each bowl.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this. Of course I doctored it up. First I sauteed about 2 cups of chopped onions and green peppers in olive oil, added a teaspoon and a half of ground cumin, cooked that a bit, then added the chicken broth, canned tomatoes, the drained corn, 2 cans of drained and rinsed black beans, the chicken (2 large breasts), AND, to give it a rich and creamy broth, I melted in 8 ounces of cream cheese. Perfecto! Served with tortilla chips. YUM!

This my all-time favorite website exactly because of recipes like this!  EASY and fast, and my kids (fussy teenagers!) really liked it!  I threw it together after work on a chilly day and it was perfect.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, but used a slotted spoon when serving in order to drain all the juice. I added black olives (my family loves them) but otherwise no changes.  Next time I plan to add the cream soup instead of one of the broths in order to thicken it up, but it was outstanding.  Will definitely make it again and again!

I had tortilla soup in Mexico and have been looking for a recipe that tasted just like it.I made just slight modifications only because i wanted to match it.  I put the tomato and chiles in a blender because I wanted more of a tomato base. I also added a half of a package of taco seasoning. To serve, I topped soup with  mexican cheese, a dollop of sour cream and tortilla strips. Amazing!

We really enjoyed this.  I followed many of the suggestions for
spicing it up to our liking and it's very good, and even better the
next day. It also freezes well. My favorite kind of recipe.
Thanks everybody.

Since my husband has been working late lately I was looking for something that I could eat for dinner and lunch for a few days. This was great. I did doctor it up some by adding some Chili powder, other spices and Tabasco because I enjoy spicy food. I dished out over tortilla chips and shredded cheese and ate off it for two days. Will be making again. Thank you for sharing.

Not a bad through together in a pinch and don't want to do a lot of slaving over the stove recipe. My husband and I liked it, while it was just a tad on the powerful spicy side for our children, however I used up some cooked chicken verses the can and just measured out the amount stated in the recipe to match. Can see making it again.

I really enjoyed this. I made it essentially the same as posted, but followed several others' recommended changes:
* Sub 1 can cream of chicken for 1 can of the broth (I used CoC w/Herbs).
* Rinse black beans very well.
* Don't drain can of chicken (I used a large can because I like a lot of meat, but you can use large or small).
* Don't drain can of Rotel tomatoes.
* Serve with fresh avocado chunks and sour cream.
* Season w/ cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, cilantro, and pepper.
* Bring to low boil, then simmer for 60 min.  Enjoy!!

Three stars as written. The second time I made this, I used rotisserie chicken, and added a packet of hot taco seasoning, some cilantro, onions, and a couple of Tablespoons of lemon juice. With those changes/additions, this is a five star recipe, and is really every bit as simple. The lemon juice put this over the top, I think. Yum!

Six Can Chicken Tortilla Soup Haiku: "Fool-proof recipe. Yea, yea, I added stuff too. (Or it'd be too bland.)" Can't argue w/ the ease of just opening 6 cans, but as w/ many of the reviews, I had to liven this up w/ some seasoning. But first off, I'm not a snob about canned chicken - the Kirkland chicken from Costco is outstanding, so I used everything the recipe called for. (Altho, my corn was the Mexi-type w/ bits of colored bell pepper in it.) I sauteed garlic, onion, and celery in a little butter and tossed that in the crockpot, along w/ cumin and oregano. Served w/ cheese, broken up tortilla chips, and cilantro - this soup completely wow'ed the friends I'd had over to dinner, who couldn't believe how easy it was to make.

I used chicken breasts instead of canned chicken, added a can of jalapeno peppers instead of canned tomatoes and added a dollop of sour cream,chopped green onions and parsley on top of the soup just before serving.  I also sauteed one whole chopped onion,3 cloves of garlic and chopped red pepper and then cooked the chopped chicken in the drippings - we really liked it and I will continue to use this recipe and kick it up another notch next time.

This is a great Base to your soup. I followed the reviews and used one can cream of chicken soup one can broth. I added green onions, carrots (I just had a lot in the fridge), crushed red peppers, black pepper, and about 2 tbs of garlic powder and onion powder. I also used fresh turkey instead of canned chicken, I had alot of that left over from Thanksgiving. The soup was a big hit. I was looking forward to having leftovers to bring to work for lunch... it didn't last that long at my house. I had people peeking in my crock pot looking for more! Experiment and make this recipe your own! Fantastic, I'm making it again next week!

Loved it!  Instant hit with my family!  I did take the advice of many of the reviewers and substituted a can of cream of chicken for one of the cans of chicken broth.  I also used some leftover baked chicken instead of chunk chicken, and I put the whole thing in the slow cooker (no rush for a change!).  I love how easy this recipe is and how quick it can be done if I put it in a saucepan.  I had everything already in my pantry too, so no ingredients to buy.  I'll have to double the recipe next time, because my three boys ate it all up in one go!

Recipe was delicious.  I followed the suggestions of several posters by adding 2 cans of Cream of Chicken Condensed soup.  I also added 1/2 packet of Chili spices, finely chopped onions, garlic powder, and a can of Kidney beans.   Paired it with some cornbread!  Great dinner!

I doubled up on the Rotel and I added one cooked chopped up chicken breast along with the canned chicken. For a real treat, have side cold additions of cut up radishes, avacado slices, flat leaf parsely and cilantro. NOW WERE TALKING 6 STAR

I used cheddar cheese soup (Campbell's) instead of cream of chicken, as one other reviewer mentioned, and it came out great! I think the cream of chicken would have made it too... chickeny?... if that makes any sense. I also used one chicken breast, shredded, added a full carton (32 oz) of chicken broth, and then just thickened the soup up at the end with a little cornstarch and water. It definitely needed cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder to jazz it up. Very yummy.

I made this soup today...very tasty!  I took advise from other reviews and used one can of fat free cream of chicken soup and one can of chicken broth.  I also used a can of mexican corn.  In addition...I added some cumin, cilantro, garlic powder & about 1/2 C of my favorite spicy salsa to give it a kick.  It's a great easy recipe and very tasty!!!  Can't wait for my family to try it!

Really easy soup.  I changed the recipe slightly.  I used on can of chicken broth and one can of cream of chicken.  Husband lke spicy and think soup.  More like a stoup.  I used Rotelle tomatoes and I cut up a rotissier chicken.  I only used half there was too much chicken.  It was very easy to throw together.  I served this soup with  a purchased artisan Jalepeno cheese bread and a salad.  Quick good meal.

I like to add a medium sized can of tomato sauce to make it taste richer. Enchilada sauce is good too. I have also put taco sauce (the smooth kind, no salsa) in place of some of the spices.  Of couse Tabasco is good too!

Super fast soup!   I added a can of cream of chicken to the soup to thicken it up.   I also sprinkled some cumin and chili powder on top.   I garnished with sour cream, shredded cheese, and Tostitos.  It took longer to open all the can than it did to cook this!

I did what the others suggested, bought a rotisserie chicken, added 2 cans of cream of chicken and 2 cans of chicken broth. Upped the spices,and let it sit simmering on the stove for about 30 minutes.  Put lime juice on top with shredded cheese, tortilla chips and chunks of avocado.  Yummy and perfect for these cold nights! I'll definitely be making this again...

I used suggested reviews to "doctor" it up. Added cream of chicken soup in place of a can of broth, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder and cumin. We used sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese on soup and it was GOOD. I will be making this soup again.

Excellent!!! I did follow the advice of others that have used this recipe. I used kernel corn (no salt added) because that's all I had on hand, 1 can of Chicken broth, 1 can of Cream of Chicken and a can of vegetable broth instead of water and a can of Rotel. I did wash and drain the beans too. I also added some crushed hot peppers to spice it up for my husband.  He said "This is a keeper, it's EXCELLENT!" Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!!!

Love this recipe - I made it for my toddlers and hubby.  I added the cream of chicken soup on top of the original recipe and also a can of plain diced tomatoes to satisfy my kids tastes ( they can't do too much spice yet).  In our bowls, my husband and I added Tabasco which make it great.  Definitely a new staple in our house

Great recipe to use ingredients you have on hand.  I had some of the ingredients however I used leftover chicken breast, prepared black beans I had on hand and plain canned tomatoes.  I added about a 1/2 cup of salsa and a teaspoon of chili powder to add some "kick"  Seemed as though I had too much broth, so cooked some rice and added it.  As with most soups, the flavor was much better the second day.  I'll be making this again, with the changes I used.

I had a lot of pulled pork left over from a party so decided to use it instead of the chicken. I followed another rater's comments but made it by the instructions first.  It was good but not great. I used fresh medium salsa instead of canned tomatoes and frozen corn.  I then added 1tsp. each of chilli powder and cumin which was a big improvement.  I then added 2 more cups of broth and the cream of chicken soup.  It watered down the flavour too much so I had to add another 1/2 tsp. each of the spices, more salsa and meat.  It was very good, but I think next time I'll substitute plain yogurt or low fat sour cream a half cup at a time to taste instead of the soup to cut fat and calories.  Very good in the end and great starting recipe.

Yumm last minute addition of cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder added liberally plus tortilla strips and shredded cheddar, plus chicken from deli section ( I don't think canned would even be worth trying) and this is a quick, easy favorite that will be repeated though the year!

This was pretty good and quick.  We shredded fresh chicken breasts and then made a rue in the pot where we cooked the chicken to thicken up the soup. Then added the soup in the same pot.  I also added about 1T of apple cider vinegar and 2T(ish) of lime juice to give the soup some zest.  We topped with cheddar cheese and fresh avocado.  Delicious!

This recipe is great. I recommend seasoning with onion powder and pepper. I also recommend cilantro and lime juice and omit the tomatoes and replace with chunks of avocado. Also I put a little flour in and let it simmer for 10 minutes to thicken .  Perfect and delicious!!!! I highly recommend this recipe :)

Delicious. Agree with the cream of chicken soup and one can of chicken broth (low sodium). My other option is to add a tablespoon of taco seasoning and served with shredded cheese. Yum.

I used low sodium versions of the broth, beans and tomatoes, frozen corn, and leftover chicken breast (I have to limit my sodium) - but shouldn't there be tortilla mentioned somewhere? Love the soup!

Uh, I really did finish school but I only count FIVE canned ingredients -- didn't anyone else catch that? This recipe needs seasoning big time -- it's really bland without adding anything to it like chili seasoning, cumin, maybe some garlic salt. and drain the black beans -- I think undrained it really dilutes an already bland soup.

I get that this is supposed to be easy (hence the canned chicken), but I wouldn't eat canned chicken so I used real chicken.  In any case, a fantastic and easy soup (even with REAL chicken)!  Definitely requires spicing up though i.e. cumin, chili powder, hot pepper etc.

So, I usually try the recipe as it is written before I make changes, but this time, I took in the reviews and made the following changes.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and filled one can again with chicken broth (not condensed). I rinced the black beans.  I added spices to taste (garlic, cumin, chili powder, pepper).  I wish I had changed out the can chicken for real chicken, but the soup tasted great.  I also broke up the nachos on top of the cheese instead of putting them on the bottom of the bowl.  I did not like them all mushy from the soup.  This was a super easy soup to make and the whole family enjoyed it.

I really like the base for this soup.  I have made this several times now and keep playing with the flavors. I will vary the flavor by using different beans, the different seasonings in the Rotel, and the different corns. I also use left over roasted chicken instead of canned. Helps give a better flavor.  My hubby also likes to add Velveta.

I love this soup!  As a super busy working mom, it's a great meal for the weekday.  I usually make a double batch so I can have leftovers for lunch.  I also like to add shredded cheese on top & fry my own corn chips to eat it with.

This is a keeper! Love one-pot meals. I took the advise of another reviewer and used a rotisserie chicken and substituted on can of broth with one can of fat-free cream of chicken and added cilantro. Sour cream and avocado slices on the side.

This recipe is quick and easy and while it's not my favourite soup, I keep it on the rotation because everyone will eat it.  I use rotisserie chicken and frozen corn.  I also add fresh garlic, cayenne pepper, and one can of cream of chicken soup in addition to one of broth.  It's not fancy, but it'll do!

I used a carton of low sodium chicken broth, two cans of healthy request cream of chicken, two cans of southwest corn, one can of fire roasted Tex Mex style diced tomatoes and all the meat pulled off a rotisserie chicken. I think next time I'll put two cans of the tomatoes.

This was absolutely delicious. Don't assume that the canned chicken decreases the quality. We've had lots of different kinds of tortilla soup before and this was definitely the tastiest and the easiest. The only change I made was to add some chili powder. I used "original" flavor Rotel tomatoes and chiles but some people thought it was too hot so I switched to "mild."

this versions does not have as much as I put in mine. I make 6 can tortilla soup by adding hominy also. I also add a packet of taco seasoning and a packet of ranch after the ingredients starts to boil. Yummy. I have made this for years and years. It is so easy.

This was made today for our church's Lunch Bunch. We had to find something quick and easy that several of us could make in large quantity. This fit the bill. I thought at first it would be a little thin or watery, but once you add the cheese and crack some chips into it, it is great! Very easy to add things to make it to your taste.

1/1/2012 I tried it just as the recipe called for- it's okay. I then added a can of condensed chicken soup- still okay. Looked better. Regular chicken would probably improve it, but I wanted to try it as the recipe calls for.
2/17/18
Made it with boiled chicken and the added cream of chicken soup. 3* regular and 4* with fresh chicken and cc soup.

Excellent cheap, quick and easy dinner, this is a favorite with my family! We skipped the canned chicken and used cooked chicken breast, then added fresh chopped cilantro at the end. Its really good with those scoops tortilla chips too!

stumbled on this recipe and absolutely fell in love!!! i've tried all the variations too (adding cream of chicken, adding sour cream, cheese, etc...) no matter what, it ALWAYS turns out great! i add chili powder and a little cayenne pepper, top it with some tortilla crisps and basically end up eating the entire thing myself. LOVE IT.

Great basic recipe. I added some leftover brown rice and my own favorite seasonings and my family ate it up. I know it's a hit when there aren't any leftovers!

I didn't read the reviews until after I got home from the grocery store with all my supplies.  I think the soup is ok, but DO NOT USE CANNED CHICKEN.  I was disappointed with the results but will try it again with left over chicken or rotisserie chicken.

I took mixed readers reviews and changed the following: added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup on 1 14oz can of the chicken broth. I also rinsed the beans and added cumin powder; I didn't add the chili powder until my kids had their servings. For the chicken, i boiled 3 whole boneless, skinless chicken breast in a separate pan of water until done, then peeled meat right off and added it to the soup. (Cook the chicken first).  I followed all other ingredients exactly.  I placed cut up tortilla chips on top of each bowl of soup, along with shredded cheddar cheese. Delicious recipe!

This soup is SO GOOD and SO EASY! Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I used shredded rotisserie chicken and added one can of condensed cream of chicken soup. Also added a sprinkle of garlic salt and paprika. Rinsed the black beans before adding in as well (apparently, without rinsing the beans, the soup can look "muddy"). I didn't even bother with toppings like sour cream, avocado, etc., although I'm sure it would be great with those additions as well. Delish!

This was really good for two reasons. 1. I needed a fast meal and this really delivered. It took maybe 15 minutes total. 2. If you keep a stocked pantry you are always going to have most of these ingredients on hand. (I always have chicken stock!)

I doctored this up with chipotle hot sauce and for toppings we used diced avocado, tortilla chips, and shredded monterrey jack. Really made it feel homemade.

Rated this a 1 at first... very bland. Added a can of cream of chicken soup, some white rice & a package of taco seasoning, which greatly improved flavor & consistency. Not sure if I'll make this again.

Made a couple modifications per some other people's recommendation and don't regret it in the slightest! I cut one of the cans of broth and added 2 cans cream of chicken as well as I added cumin. I served it with a modified version of the avocado salad.

Made a change. Didn't drain liquid from tomatoes and peppers for a spicier taste. Will cut the taste of the black beans by not using all of juice in can.
Good reciepe which  I make again.

This is soooo good and so simple to make. Everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it and asks for the recipe! The only thing I changed was I did one can of chicken broth and 2 cans of cream of chicken, I didnt drain the corn or tomatoes either, just dumped them in!

Easy to make, great taste and you can vary the degree of "hotness." 
Suggest using chicken broth versus chicken stock.  The broth is hearty, thicker and enhances the flavor, while the stock is thinner and tends to water down the flavor.

My family loved it.  I used chicken bouillon with water plus one can cream of chicken soup.  I added cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, and onion powder.  It needs some spices but it super easy to tweak to your tastes.  This will be in our regular rotation.

I thought this soup was amazing!  I did tweak a couple things from reading the reviews... I doubled the amount of broth( I made mine from chicken bouillon, 32oz water to 4tsp bouillon), used 2 cans of cream of chicken, added zucchini, and a fresh tomato along with the canned diced... I used 3 big chicken breasts and boiled them in salted water... shredded when cooled and added to the pot... was an amazing, chunky chicken soup that my family loved... made homemade fried tortilla strips and topped with cilantro, squeeze of lime, and avocado!  Will be making this many more times!!!

This recipe was a great success! I used rotisserie chicken from last night - shredded and it was super yummy. I also used one can of cream of chic and one can of chic broth. I  also added some fresh pico de gallo while simmering. Spiced it up with cilantro, garlic salt, and chili powder. Not too spicy for my 4 year old!

So I made this with modifications and took it to my daughters school for a soup contest and took second place!! I think it would have taken 1st but I make it a little spicy and not everyone is into that. My husband loves it!! And the longer you can let it cook (slow cooker 6hrs) the better it is.

This soup was fantastic! I also added cream of chicken to the soup and a dash of garlic salt. I didn't have whole kernal regular corn but did have whole kernal sweet corn and it worked just fine. I can't wait to make this again!

Crunched up some blue tortilla chips and some grated cheese on top and we couldn't get enough!  Make sure you use the diced tomatoes with the green chilies for the best flavor.  Let simmer as long as possible because it only gets better!

Very good for its simplicity. I don't do canned chicken, so used 1/2 chicken. It needed more than 2 cans broth; the stock from the chicken (2 c) was sufficient. Also don't drain the Rotel. Just shake some ground coriander & cumin into the soup. Serve topped with broken tortilla chips, shredded cheese, & chopped cilantro.

I made the adjustments others had suggested of adding 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  I also cooked a thin chicken breast in water, cut it up and added to the soup instead of canned chicken.  I also added some cumin and garlic powder.  At the very end, I added some fresh cilantro and fresh lime juice.  We liked it.  Will make it again.

I've been using the recipe for years!  We make it to go along with tacos.  I don't use beans, however, as it wasn't part of the recipe I used, I also use medium salsa instead of the tomatoes and chili's.  I find that it has better spice.  I add a little lime juice and some garlic powder, too.  And I typically use frozen corn instead of canned because it's more convenient for me.  We serve it with shredded cheddar on top and crumbled up tortilla chips.  It's a hit with the adults and the kids and makes enough for leftovers, too.

This soup is really good, especially with adding alot of spices like SShulte14 said and also adding a can of cream of chicken soup. I forgot to add the black beans (which i love) and the soup was actually fantastic without the blk beans!

After seeing all of the 5 star ratings, my expectations were high for this recipe. I loved how simple the recipe was, but this soup was very bland. The only way I varied from the recipe was that I cooked it in a slow cooker. I seriously doubt I will make this again.

Would give it 5 stars if I didn't have to add anything, but since I took advice from other reviewers, I also saute some onion and a clove of minced garlic, replace a can of chicken broth with can of cream of chicken, and season with cumin and chili powder and maybe a little cilantro. Every time I get rave reviews from everyone I make it for, and because it's so easy to remember, I pass it on to spread the love. It's definitely a go to recipe for me, topped with some cheese and tortilla chips, SOOO very good!

Adults liked though 1 not crazy about chile pepper but children not crazy about it and picked at it.  I only added 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  Couple of adults added little salt and pepper.  Plan to make it again but might try to add a little more flavor to it.

So easy! I made this with fresh chicken instead of canned. I would suggest using slightly less broth depending on your taste; my roommates prefer their soup less brothey. Overall, wonderful meal!

I gave it only 4 stars because it does need to be doctored up a little to not be bland.  I used cumin and chili powder.  Definitely needs to be served over tortilla chips with cheddar cheese.  The cheddar cheese really gives it flavor.  It was a very easy, tasty soup though for a night full of kids activities.

This is a wonderfully easy recipe that was a HIT with my family and friends!!  I followed some suggestions from reviews for tweaking it (substitute ingredients, additional garnishes, adjusted measurements, etc.), but the basis of the recipe is so simple, you just can't go wrong!  Best suggestion/ alteration - use a ready-to-serve rotisserie chicken instead of canned chunk chicken.

**Great and easy!  We used this recipe for a nice romantic night.  **I used two whole chicken breasts and grilled them a bit before cutting them up and tossing them in.  We had more fresh ingredients at the time than canned so we emptied the can of beans and used the empty can to measure out what we needed.  **I boiled a leftover rotisserie chicken carcass with some garlic and onions and used the stock for this recipe (the rotisserie ones you get from the store makes excellent stock and is a good use to the bones!)    **We used fresh tomatoes and two chopped serrano chillies.  I also added in 4-5 cloves of garlic and almost a half of a brown onion thinly sliced.  We also defrosted some frozen corn and tossed that in.    We let the whole thing simmer for a while until the ingredients melded together and seasoned to taste.    Also we did not have tortilla chips so we took some corn tortilla and cut it into strips and chunks and browned until crunchy with a bit of olive oil. Will make this very easy dish again!

Very good easy recipe although I cooked my chicken with some seasoning, chicken broth, and lime in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 so that I could shred it and I think that made a lovely addition to the soup.

This recipe was AWESOME for the working parent especially.  My mother even liked it and she likes hardly anything!  I read all the other reviews and used a lot of the suggestions.  I used diced tomatoes with oregano and basil and bought green chili's separate.  I added the two cans of cream of chicken, green onions, cumin, pepper and fresh garlic.  I topped each bowl with a teaspoon of sour cream, avocado and crumbled tortilla chips.  It really was fast, easy and had a great flavor.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband!  I too made some changes, but not many.   I felt 2 cans of broth made it too watered down, so left it to one.  To thicken it up even MORE, I added a 1/2 packet of Spanish rice (Knorr I think) and covered it a bit to cook the rice through.  This gave it awesome taste!  Also can throw in a dash of cumin and chili powder.  Throw this version over crushed tortilla chips and top with grated cheese and sour cream.  YUMMY!

Yay!  Something easy and healthy to add to my repertoire.  I made a double batch using all the helpful hints from previous reviewers - rotisserie chicken, Rotel Tomatoes with Lime Juice and Cilantro (kinda spicy-yum), half broth/half cream of chicken soup with can of water, 1 tsp Cumin (could use 2 tsp), frozen corn (instead of canned).  I used one can black beans and one can black eyed-peas (tasty). You could use pinto or kidney beans too.  It turned out delish.  No other spices or seasoning needed.  For my double batch I added 1/4 cup of rice.  It thickened up nicely by the time it was done.  My family loved it. It was very filling and satisfying.

Oh my goodness! This was absolutely delicious! And sooo easy! I followed the reviews of others and used one can cream of chicken and one can of chicken broth and it came out nice and thick. I like to use kidney beans instead just because I'm not a fan of black beans and I also use the rotel diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro so that it's not quite as spicy. I top with sour cream and mix in crunched up tortilla chips. Yummm, thank you!

I followed directions as well as the instructions of others by putting in a ton of seasoning. I didn't put in the rotisserie chicken because our city closes down early but it was amazing even without it. Totally impressed with the simplicity.

loved this recipe, it provided a really good base, added cumin, garlic powder, chili powder and cilantro.  I love how easy it is to just through everything into the pot.

This was a great base recipe! I used regular (non-condensed) chicken broth, replaced one can of broth with cream of chicken soup, browned and cubed regular chicken. Added cumin and spicy curry powder. I also pureed about 2-3 cups of the soup and then let it reduce just a hair so it wasn't super watery. I topped it with fine cubed avocado, and shredded pepper cheese. Great base recipe, and very flexible.

A very good base recipe....definitely needs spices and seasonings.  I added Salsa, taco seasoning, chili powder, and garlic powder.  I also changed the 2 cans of broth to 1 can of broth and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  After making it I had some left over wild rice in the refrigerator and added that to it.  It helped thicken it more.

I followed suggestions- adding cumin, garlic powder, chili powder and used 1/2 cream of chicken instead of 2 cans of broth and adding my own grilled chicken. It took less than 20 minutes! My husband loved it and I will deffinitely make it again. I think I might add a can of plain diced tomatoes next time too.

This is a great start. I use a rotisserie chicken and pull the meat adding it at the end. I also use a variety of different seasonings including sometimes and not always; cumin, garlic and/or onion powder, chili powder, or red pepper flakes, or Mrs. Dashes Southwest Chipotle blend.. also like to shred pepperjack cheese on individual bowls

I hesitate to give this 4 stars because it is blah as written.  When serving I add Pico de gallo (roma tomatoes, green onions, cilantro) mix pico with a ripe avocado.  Top with tortilla strips and this is a ***** star recipe.

So easy and good.  I made several changes after reading the reviews and everyone in my family loved it.  Changes made: used mexican corn, replaced one can broth with one can lo-fat, lo-sodium cream of chicken and used lo-sodium beans.  I also bought a rotisserie chicken and used that instead of canned chicken.  I will definitely be adding this to my monthly menu rotation!

LOVE this soup!  It was so easy and really delicious!  I made a few small tweaks just because I had a few different items on hand.  Used rotisserie chicken (way better than canned), added small can of green chili's and used a can of tomatoes with green pepper/onions mixed in.  I also took others advice and used a can of cream of chicken soup.  Plus I added cumin, chili powder, and red pepper for some great flavor!   Loved that I had all that I needed to make this easy, easy recipe.  Try it...you won't be disappointed.

DELICIOUS! I took the advice of the others and eliminated 1 can of chicken broth and used 1 can of cream of chicken soup instead. It would have been far too watery without it. My daughter is a VERY picky eater. She kept telling me how good my recipe was. The next day, she asked me to put this recipe on my menu again for next week. AMAZING!

This came together in 5 minutes and was perfect for our weeknight dinner. I agree with the reviewer who said this is a good base. I added a few of my own spices to suit my tastes. That's a beautiful thing about this recipe. You can add what you want, in the quantities you want, or not add anything at all. It was very good and easy.

love this. very easy compared to other tortilla soup recipes. seasoning is a must, though. definately cook your own chicken or use a rotisserie. i also like to add some cooked brown rice to add even more texture.

This was great!!  Even my picky husband thought it was just awesome!  He loved all the flavor.  The only thing I did different was substituded one can of chicken broth for one can of cream of chicken soup.   Be sure to drain and rinse well the black beans.  I will make this again and again!!!!

Awesome easy soup with a lot of zest! I decreased one can of broth simply because we like heartier soup and added a small dollop of sour cream in the bowls as I served it! By far, one of the best and easiest recipes on here!

I tried this recipe using other cooks' suggestions of using the condensed cream of chicken soup, and that made it too thick. Next time I will try it with just the ingredients listed.

Did what others suggested and swapped a can of cream chicken soup for one can of broth, used left over chicken from our "Roast chicken with rosemary" recipe on here, and doctored it up with chili powder and cumin.  Easy and delicious.

This was so VERY easy! I too, made adjustments, and add garlic powder, dried onion, cumin and chili powder. This is my husband's favorite recipe to date with these additions! Trying on my mother in law tonight, so that will be the TRUE test! :) Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a 5 min meal.  So quick & easy, yet soo good!  This soup was loved by everyone including 3 yr olds.  Will definitely make again.  Substituted 1 can cream of chicken + 1 can water, used only 1 can chicken broth.  Added cheese, tortilla chips & a lil chili powder & garlic.  4 stars because we did alter the recipe as suggested by other users.

I'm giving this 5 stars because 6 cans of ingredients and tastes good..... it's a no brainer for a quick soup.  I will definitely make it again per the directions and will possibly make some changes or not.

Very tasty - we did swap one can of broth for one can of low fat cream of chicken soup, to us it had a better, thicker texture. Also we have made it once with a shredded store-bought chicken and also with canned and it was very good both ways.  I top with sliced onion, avocado, cheese and FF sour cream - excellet and SUPER easy recipe! Thank you!

For me this is a 5 star recipe because it was super easy, but turned out quite really good.  I did take advice of others by using one can broth and two cans of cream of chicken soup.  I added a little cumin and chili seasoning and served over chips with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.

With the weather getting chilly, and my husband coming down with a cold, I decided to make a tortilla soup. I like this recipe because I favor a clear, thin broth as opposed to the versions with enchilada sauce or cream.  This soup was so yummy after my "alterations" - I used frozen chicken breasts that I boiled with some diced onion in the chicken stock and then shredded. I used three cans of stock instead of two. I always rinse my black beans (which wasn't noted on the recipe). The soup was a bit bland, so I added a hefty amount of taco seasoning - but you could just add chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.  I topped with cilantro and a dash of lime. Wonderful!

I made this in my crock pot, cooking for about 4 hours...was very easy to throw together...I used raw chicken breasts cut into thin strips, and then shredded them with a fork after they turned tender...I did take advice from other reviews and added cumin and chile powder as it cooked...I served with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese on top...served this for supper and had very little leftovers from my husband and two teenagers...will make again and probably double the quantities.

This was my first tortilla soup and I followed all the other reviews and added cumin, garlic power, chili powder and I didn't use canned chicken.  Added avocados at the end with some sour cream and it was delicious!

Im always looking for ways to make canned chicken eatable, this recipe totally worked. I added one of those little cans of chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, and that pepped it up quite a bit! Also put some assorted spices in, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder. Very tasty for a few minutes work.

Followed directions and recipe amounts as listed.  I did put the chips on top of the soup instead of in the bottom of the bowl.  Very good and could not be easier.  I made half the recipe and used the left-over half can of tomatoes and green chili's to make queso.

The taste was fantastic! I did add a couple of chopped fresh jalapenos for a little heat, I also served it with tortillas chips (to make it a little more hardy) and a little sour cream.  Yummy!

FANTASTIC! I broiled two boneless chicken breasts, used Del Monte Zesty Chili Style diced tomatoes (I was out of RoTel), used 1 can chicken broth and 1 can cream of chicken, added black olives, cumin, garlic powder, chili powder and green chilis, omitted the corn since I didn't have it on-hand. Threw it in the crockpot for several hours and served it with cornbread. My husband and I both went nutso over it! Great recipe and so easy to throw together! Will be a staple in our home!

This was really good!  Like many others, I changed a few things.  Used one can of rotel and the broth and used hominy instead of corn because I can digest it better! Cooked my own chicken breast cause do not like canned chicken. Added cumin and chili powder and garlic salt.  It was DELICIOUS!!!

great basic starting place.  i throw cumin in, and substitute hominy for the corn.  cut tortillas into matchsticks and fry them in olive oil to make a crunchy topping, along with shredded cheese, sour cream, and avocado.  Yum!  My 7 yr old loved it.

I've been making something almost identical to this for years.  I always keep the ingredients in my pantry for a quick, last-minute meal.  The slight difference of my recipe is that I don't use any chicken broth (for liquid, we don't drain the other cans), we use salsa instead of diced tomatoes, and we add a can of refried beans.  The refried beans help thicken the soup and make it taste rich. We love this soup!  And I'm making it right now as I type!!

It's cold and wet out. I'm home alone and didn't want to work hard for dinner, but still wanted something good - this was it! It was perfect, delicious and easy. If I don't end up eating all the leftovers myself for lunch tomorrow my family can have it for dinner.

This is so good and easy!  I used 2 chicken breast cooked/shredded instead of canned chicken. Other than that just added in onion, garlic, cumin & chili powder.  I love that the base is broth, it has less WW points than a cream soup. DELICIOUS!

I love this soup. So easy to prepare and tastes great. Like the other reviews said, it does allow you to play around with the ingredients. I omit the can of corn and instead use a can of hominy. It gives the soup a definate tortilla taste.

Really great recipe - I'm giving it five stars b/c it's so easy, otherwise I'd give it four.  I did add cumin, cilantro, and garlic powder.  I used fresh corn (all I had) and it gave it a nice crunch.  Also used vegetable stock b/c it's what I had on hand and did add one can of cream of chicken soup.  Very good!

AMAZING! Simple and delicious! I used 1 tbsp chili powder and garlic and pepper to taste. My boyfriend loved it and it had a kick but not too much for our 6 year old. Served with broken tortilla chips on top and cheese quesadillas to accompany. This is now a staple in our home! Thank you!!

This recipe was so easy and cheap too! I drained the beans like others had suggested and also used two cans of cream of chicken soup and one can of chicekn broth. I also cooked a cup of rice and added that to the soup which soaked up a lot of the liquid. I think next time I'll try two cans of chicken broth if I add the rice again. All in all, great recipe and will definitely make this again!!

This soup is fantastic.  I did cut down on the sodium by using chicken breast and low sodium chicken broth.  Also I added about a half of a package of low sodium taco seasoning.  I served it with cheese, crushed tortilla chips and sour cream.  My family and neighbors loved this.

This is really good for s super fast meal. I did use cream of chix soup instead of broth though (2 cans-1 low fat). had shredded cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips for those who wanted them on top. Next time, I may add a can of green chilis or jalepenos for an added kick. All my kids liked it. :)

Ok so I'm updating my first review. I was not impressed with this soup originally, thought it was just OK. However, I left it to simmer on the stove for about 30 minutes and it was MUCH better. My husband, who doesn't like soup and doesn't care for Mexican food, LOVED IT. I used leftover roasted chicken and Ro-Tel lime and cilantro diced tomatoes with green chilies. This soup was VERY EASY and very healthy.  Will be making this again.

This was very good and extremely easy. We will be having this often! I did as some suggested and used one 14 1/2 ounce can of chicken broth and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup ( no water added). I also rinsed the black beans. I served it with some homemade bread for a wonderful meal. This is a definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe!!

Super easy, everyone loves it. I like to add several spoonfuls of salsa con queso (nacho cheese dip in the jar), it gives it a kick and a nice color.

This recipe is great.  I make it at least once per week.  I did make some slight modifications.  Instead of chicken broth, I used 1 can of cream of chicken or cream of celery condensed soup and I rinse the beans and corn to reduce salt content.  I add approximately 24oz of water.  I like to serve this with sweet cornbread.

This is one of the best ideas I've come across in awhile! I usually make chicken tortilla soup from scratch, making my own broth and everything from the whole chicken, but this was JUST as good and in 1/4 of the time! Of course I made changes...I sauteed some onions in olive oil for a few minutes in the bottom of my pot. The oil really helps bring out the flavor of the spices. I used a can of chicken broth, can of water, and a can of Cream of Chicken as recommended by others. I was liberal with the Comino and Chili Powder. I also added a cup of rice to the mix at the end to soak up the extra water. Added in some cilantro to each bowl and shredded some Monterrey Jack cheese in while hot. DELICIOUS!

This is good for what it is advertised as--an easy and good recipe, so my 4 star reflects that.  Also, I'd describe this as a good base soup, and I added a lot of extra seasonings to taste, including: 3 to 4 Tbsp Cumin (could have added more); 2 to 3 Tbsp Cayenne Pepper Sauce; some garlic powder/salt.

Wasn't tastey. I give it two stars because it didn't cost much and it was easy. The canned chicken is what made it taste so bad. It should have been made with chicken breast baked with seasoning and shredded when cooked.

I used the chicken, onions, and peppers left-over from fajitas to spice this up a bit. I also added cumen, garlic powder and fresh cilantro.

My boyfriend ate it all!  I was nervous about serving it over chips, as I hate mushy food, but it was awesome.  First time we ever cooked it and it was gone.  Added chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and sea salt.  YUM!

Loved it!  Easy and very flavorful.  The only change I made was to the chicken. I boiled i package of chicken thighs in chicken broth and a packet of chicken taco seasoning for ninety minutes, then shredded the chicken. I added the remaining ingredients to the chicken broth along with the shredded chicken and brought to a boil. I also added some diced jalapenos for a kick! Served over the tortilla chips with Sour cream and a pinch of cilantro.  Huge Hit!  This is my new favorite

I took the suggestions of others and doctored this up a bit with a few spices, (chili powder, cumin, garlic powder), onion and used grilled chicken. We put cheese on top, but I think next time we will try adding a dollop of sour cream as well.  It was very good, even the picky 4 year old ate it up.  Thanks for a great starting base!

This recipe is great.  I did knock down one star because I much prefer the taste of the "slow cooker chicken taco soup" recipe (from this website) but this version is so much easier to make.  The results are pretty tasty, too!

It doesn't get any easier than this!  I added a teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder to pump up the flavor a bit.  This is also a low-cal recipe (unless you serve it over broken up corn chips like I did and added a sprinkling of cheese on top).  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good, but instead of using chunk of chicken in the can I cut up boneless chicken breast. I also added a tsp of Chili powder and a tsp of Cumin. Very good! Will definitely make again.

So easy and soooo good!  Like others, I made some changes:  Used grilled chicken breast, drained/rinsed the beans, added choppped jalapenos, added a can of cream of chicken soup, added 1 sliced zucchini, and spiced up with cumin, cayenne, etc.  It still took less than 15 minutes to prep.  Served with avocado, cheese and chips - YUM!!!!

Good base recipe. I made it my own by adding a can of kidney beans along with the can of black beans just for extra flavor. Make sure you drain everything and rinse the beans well. Instead of the tomatoes with green chiles, I used a can of diced tomatoes and a separate 7 oz. can of the diced green chiles. Like other reviewers had suggested, I added some ground cumin, chili powder, black pepper and garlic salt to taste. I also used two fresh chicken breasts that I diced and cooked first. Canned chicken just did not sound appealing to me. Then I shredded some pepperjack cheese on top. Yum yum!

I gave this 5 stars for both ease and taste. If you need a quick, tasteful dinner, this is it. I threw in some chili flakes just because we like our food extra spicy! I also made a southwest salad to go with it, and they  went very well together.

This has become a cold weather staple at our house.  So good and good for you!  When the soup begins to simmer, I add 1/2 cup of rice -- it is wonderful!

What a smart recipe!  I didn't feel like cooking much last night but I wanted tortilla soup/pozole for a warm dinner. So I did this recipe more or less, one can broth, one can cream of chicken, corn black beans, stewed tomatoes, cumin, chili powder and a can of mote/hominy!  It came out really good and was ready in 15 mins.  I served with fried tortillas and dollop of sour cream.  Que rico!

Very good and VERY easy. Followed other reviewers and used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 broth; would've been way too runny otherwise. Added a little cumin and chili powder. Put shredded mexi-cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and fritos on top. Will be making again. Husband loved it!

I made this recipe and it was pretty good.  I rinsed and added black beans.  I also added garlic salt and about 1/4 cup of salsa.  I put the tortillas on top and also added shredded cheddar.

Wonderful! I tried to cheat and use rotisserie chicken but deli was out so I cooked 3 breasts in skillet with favorite seasonings then added to rest of soup. It was a huge hit in my house and we are not big soup eaters

This was really good, but I used real chicken cut up and the actual ingredient list and instructions don't say, but you need to put cheese and tortilla chips crunched up on top or it isn't the same. Also I used frozen corn instead of can. Great quick recipe that you can make your own with spices.

This is sooo easy and good its crazy!  You'll almost always have the ingredients in your pantry.  I did substitute one can of broth for cream of chicken, but I like this kind of soup creamy.  Thanks for the great recipe - a keeper!

I used bits of a whole roast chicken instead on canned chicken, added 2 frozen cubes of cilantro, a little tomato juice, powdered garlic, and cumin.  Turned out really well!

I got a similar recipe to this in an email a long time ago, and came across this when trying to find it again. I omitted the chicken chunks (not a big fan of the meat) and substituted the tomatoes with chiles with Salsa and it's fabulous.  I think the salsa adds a lot more flavor than the can of tomatoes.

This has become a family favorite.  I've shared the recipe with many.  I just pulled the recipe out again... for this week's card party.  It's great a great main dish for a crowd, especially when every one brings something to go along with the soup.  We've also taken this camping and it's wonderful in a Dutch Oven in the great outdoors.  Thanks so much for the great recipe. L.

Everything easy and yummy gets 5 stars from me.  It has to be served with tortilla chips crumpled over the top and cheese, sour cream and avocado if possible.  So wonderful.

this recipe rox! my family didnt say a word thru dinner- which is a first, I assure you- their mouths were full! We didnt have chicken, so I just skipped that step- we're mostly vegitarian anyway, so no big deal. the only thing I did different was I sauteedred onions and garlic and added some crushed red peppers and cumin. and quadrupled the recipe- big family n all. it worked out wonderfully, and it was just as good day 2.

Add a packet of Taco Seasoning!  I also replaced one can of broth with one can of cream of chicken soup and used pre-cooked, diced, frozen chicken instead of canned.  Even my 4 year old LOVES this soup!  Easy and so good!  Thanks so much!

Unbelievable easy, and delicious. Use this recipe as a base for your own version. I added one avocado, some cilanro, a lime and a few shakes of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. Great recipe to learn how to make tortilla soup!

I love this recipe!  I make it all the time.  I would suggest adding a can of refried beans to make the soup thicker, and using Ro-Tel to spice it up.  Thanks for the post.

I love this recipe! It's one of my favorite standbys. I use one of the large cans of regular chicken broth and one can of condensed cream of chicken soup. I add those first and mix them up well before adding the other ingredients, or else I get globs of the cream of chicken that won't dissolve. This seems to give me the right ratio of soup to solids and adds a little bit of creamy taste without being too heavy. I also add a little garlic powder, onion salt, and some dried parsley flakes. One tip: be sure to rinse the black beans well or they will turn the whole thing a disgusting blue/gray color! (It still tastes good, though.) I skip the tortilla chips and serve with cornbread muffins.

Delicious! I gave it 4 stars insted of 5, because I made of few changes. I rinsed the black beans, used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can chicken broth. I sauted some onion & garlic in the pot then added ingredients, also added some finely chopped baby spinach to sneak some extra vegetables into our diet. Very good and easy. Will definetly make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Very good!  However, I prefer a creamier tortilla soup so I put in a can of cream of celery soup and also took other's advice and added some spice to it.  It's a very tastey, very budget friendly soup.

I don't care for canned corn so I use frozen corn in this recipe and it works great.  The one draw back to this soup is the appearance.  It is a black murky soup but it tastes good and the people that I have served it to liked it.

This was delicious!!!  I did saute the chicken in butter with some onion and minced garlic.  I added a little bit if cumin, chili powder, and garlic salt and then added the rest of the ingredients.  I only used one can of broth and used one can of cream of chicken.  I topped it off with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and crushed tortilla chips!  DELICIOUS!!!!!

Very good!  I followed the advice of others and sauteed half an onion and garlic before pouring in the cans.  I also did one can of chicken broth and one can of cream of chicken.  Added dashes of cumin, cayenne pepper and onion powder.  So good but best of all SO easy!

Unfortunately due to the spiciness of this one, I was the only one that really liked it tonight. I am rating it 5 stars because I loved it and I am sure that the next time I make it I am using plain Jane diced tomatoes for the rest of the family. 
I boiled a whole chicken to make the broth with half an onion and 4 garlic cloves diced. Then I had my daughter help me take the meat off the bone and had my other daughter add the ingredients. We also used fresh cilantro and chili powder and cream of chicken soup like others had suggested. Served over tortilla chips, terrific recipe and easily adaptable!

Excellent - it doesn't get much easier than this!
I opted to bake chicken instead of using canned, but that's the only tweak I made. I forwarded on to my step son who's in college - perfect meal for him & his roommates - healthy & simple!

What a great basic recipe for a quick and easy soup. I have made this several times using both canned and home cooked chicken. Always comes out perfect. I also add cumin and cayenne. To increase vegie consumption in the family I also add chopped onion, carrots and zucchini. Oh, I also use 3 cans of drained and rinsed beans. YUM!!!

I hate to cook so this is my kind of recipe - super easy.  I added a can of cream of chicken soup, and a bit of flour to thicken it up.  I also added cumin to season it.  Great recipe.

This recipe is one of the rare times when canned ingredients make a delicious, "can't tell it's not from scratch" dish.  Your guests will be asking for the recipe and you'll hate to tell them how incredibly simple it is!  The recipe is a great base, but I made a few changes.  I reduced the chicken broth to 16 oz. and added one can of Campbell's Southwest style pepper jack soup.  I also used a store bought roasted chicken instead of canned chicken.  Although I drained the black beans, the soup still had an unappealing grayish cast, so I added about 8 oz. tomato sauce.  This changed the color of the soup to a creamy red which was more appealing.  Serve with tortilla chips, shredded cheese, avocado, salsa and sour cream on the side so your guests can add to their liking.

Good base recipe. I looked at alot of the reviews. I agree that you need one can of broth and one can cream of chicken. And I never use can chicken. I cooked tenderloins with fajita seasoning. Added garlic,onion,chili powder,paprika,cumin to taste. Topped with avocado,mexican cheesse blend,tortilla chips and sour cream. Easy one dish for a busy family.

I would give this 10 stars if possible. Easy and so yummy!  I used canned corn with green peppers in it and had pinto beans on hand. Rotel tomatoes(lime juice and green chilis) added a hot zip to it!  Ingredients are a staple in my pantry so I am sure we will make often!

This was very good.  I added some ingredients for fear of it being "bland"...Velveeta and some leftover cream of chicken soup I had in the fridge to make it a little creamier.  Be sure and rinse the black beans (it affects the color of the soup).  I also added some Southwest seasoning to the chicken (I cooked chicken breasts. I did NOT use canned) as well as a wee bit to the soup too.  I also added garlic and onion powder and Hasa Marina (corn flour) to give it more of a "Tortilla" taste.  Shredded cheese and chips on the top is a MUST.  I even put a dallop of sour cream on the top too.  I have a copycat recipe for Chili's Chicken Enchilada soup and I like it better, but this one was very fast and easy.  I would make it again.  It was a hit!  Thanks for posting :)

I used one can of Campbell's chicken broth, one can water, and one can of cream of chicken soup in place of the one can of chicken broth. My husband is extremely picky. He commented that it looked awful. He tried it with tortilla chips and shredded cheese. He ate THREE bowls. It was delicious! I have given the recipe out to several people, because it was SO QUICK, EASY, AND DELICIOUS!

This was great!!  I was a little sceptical after reading a few of the reviews, but I followed the instructions all but the black beans.  I used dark red kidney beans instead.  It was delicious.  A little spicy for my taste, but my husband will love it I'm sure.  Thanks!

I was desperate for a meal the other day and figured this couldn't be so bad... and it wasn't. But definitely not deserving of the rave reviews it's received.

Unless you have all these items in your pantry, save the money you would have spent on cans, and splurge on real chicken, real tomatoes and real chiles.

I was really impressed at how easy and tasty this was!  I'm not a fan of canned chicken, but it's not bad in a pinch.  I've used cooked shredded leftover chicken.  Initially I couldn't find the tomatoes called for, so I dumped in a jar of salsa.  Fabulous!!!  And with the addition of the tortilla chips and cheese-one word-YUM!!!  Thank you so much for this easy and yummy recipe!

I love this recipe but only WITH some of the previous reviewers' suggestions. 
1: Chunk chicken sounds UNnatural. I buy flat chicken strips and fry on the stve with a bit of butter or oil. Then I chop into small bits and add.
2. DRAIN thhe black beans and strain them under water!
3. Get creative! Add spices and other ingredients and really make this your own. My husband loves this soup!

I followed the recipe for the most part. I added some shakes of cumin and crushed red pepper to make it spicier. I think I will add cream of mushroom next time that sounds good.

This soup is really easy!!!! And with just a few changes it was perfect for my family. I did not subtract anything, I just added 1/2 a diced onion, 1 can condensed cream of chicken soup, 1 tablespoon cumin, some salt and pepper. I finished the soup in less than 20 minutes! I think next time I will add more chicken and beans, to make it more like a chili.

This is excellent! We also switched out 1 can of broth for cream of chicken soup and added some cumin and chili powder (to taste). We ate it with french bread. The place we usually have this soup at serves it in a bread bowl and this came very close in flavor to theirs.

This recipe is easy, fast & delicious. I made mine a 7 can soup by including a can of chipotle sauce to kick up the heat. I served it with Chili-Cheese Corn Muffins (from this site) to make a complete meal.

I love this recipe!!  I also made a few modifications: I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup & 1 can of the chicken broth, I also used pinto beans instead of black beans & I added about 2-3 tablespoons of salsa along with some extra spices.  This is a quick & fantastic recipe.

Very low calorie and quite nice. I tasted it. Spice it how you want... spices carry negligable calories.

This recipe is good.  I didn't drain the Rotel tomatoes so it was a little spicy.  I also should have rinsed the black beans because I used a can of fat free cream of chicken like others suggested, but the liquid from the black beans made the soup a funky color.  I will definitely try this one again.

So easy and delicious. Just use whatever you have on hand. I usually simmer some diced onion and serrano pepper in the bottom of the stock pot before adding the rest of the ingredients. Adds a little flavor boost. So satisfying. Of course, cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla strips for toppings are a must.

The mission group at my church made this recipe for a Lenten soup supper fundraiser. We added one can of fiesta cheddar cheese soup and used mixed tortilla chips crumbled on top.  We feed about 170 people with approximately 6 batches.  It was a hit, although, a bit spicy for some of our older members.

Doug would have liked it with more "kick" and creamy, but I loved it just the way it was.  I doubled the recipe, and used only 4 cans of chicken broth so it would fit in the crock pot.

My husband absolutely loved it.  I was okay with it.  Definitely a great base to start out with and then add your own ingredients too.  Will use again but probably for camping or something.

This is just like the recipe my step mom gave me except for 2 differences.  Instead of black beans we used Ranch Style Beans (sauce included) and a package of dry Hidden Valley Ranch mix.  I know it sounds weird but it tasted great!  We tried it and then were a bit confused when we heard what the ingredients are!

This is my favorite, easy soup recipe. You can customize it to suit your own tastes. I added fresh cilantro and a packet of taco seasoning. For toppings, try shredded cheddar & sour cream. Also, I baked tortillas and cut them into strips. Its a nice change from bagged tortilla chips.

Wow!  I'm giving this a five for two reasons.  It's Easy!  It's Fast! I threw this together in a pinch.  I followed the recipe, and added two shakes of chili powder into it.  Tasty with  a bit of heat! What a great recipe!

Sure, it's easy.. but my husband thought just buying it in single can would of tasted better.  I didn't like the canned chicken.  Plus way too much sodium.

I used a fresh roasted chicken as others have suggested and also subbed one can of cream of chix soup instead of two of the broth.  This soup went over wonderfully with my guests - definitely need the cheese and sour cream to top it off!  Thanks!

INCREDIBLY....SALTY!

That was my first and most overwhelming impression.  I made it as directed except I put in 3/4 of a package of taco seasoning.  

I like a lot of salt and I could hardly eat it.  Next time I'll just add my own cumin and other spices.

This was so quick and easy and very tasty!  Like other reviewers, I substituted a can of cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of broth, which thickened it up nicely.  I didn't have taco seasoning, like others suggested adding, so I used chicken fajita seasoning and it was delicious.  I didn't have any black beans, so I omitted them, but the soup was still very good.  Thank you for the wonderful idea for something very quick and easy that tastes great!

I also added one package of taco seasoning.  I made a couple of other adjustments: I didn't drain the tomato/chili juice and I added about half a can of cream of chicken soup for some body.  I strongly suggest adding cheese, chips, and sour cream as toppings!  I think it really makes it.  The husband loved it.

I felt this came out pretty bland when prepared as described here.  I had to add a lot of spices for it to have real flavor.  I added cumin, red pepper flakes, chili powder, salt and pepper and I still wasn't crazy about how it turned out.  If I were to make it again, I'd add onion and a chili pepper to give it more kick.  Felt it was very watery, even though I drained the beans, corn, chicken, and diced tomatoes.  Mine didn't look as nice as the one in the picture here either!

I too tweeked it a little, but the "outline" was perfect!  It turned out great!
We always add cheese, tortilla chips & sour cream (fat, fat & more fat) to make it even tastier!

Love this soup! I have made chicken tortilla soup from scratch and this is better.  I used extra broth and added a can of drained sliced carrots and a can of refried beans- makes the soup a bit more thick and hearty.

This is a pretty tasty soup and a very handy recipe to have for a quick dinner.  I have made it a couple of times and use fresh chicken tenders instead of canned chicken, but I'm sure it's yummy with canned chicken as well.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Great soup and so easy to make- made a couple of changes for personal preference. Used two cans cream of chicken soup (as others suggested)and 1 can chicken broth. Omitted the black beans and used ro*tel spicy cilantro and lime. Added pinch of cumin, chili powder and garlic powder. Also used a precooked chicken from grocery store. Made the night before and took to pot luck-reheated well in crock pot. Nice creamy soup!

I simmered chicken breasts in the crockpot in chicken broth all day, then shredded the chicken instead of using the canned stuff.  I couldn't imagine making a "tortilla" soup without "mexicanizing" it up a bit so I added some taco seasoning to the pot.  Turned out fabulous and was eaten up quick by all.

Wow-- this was so good. It was easy and inexpensive also. I used 1 can of broth, and 1 can cream of chicken soup and half a packet of taco seasoning. The whole family liked this one. We will be using this a lot in the fall when we need a really quick and hot meal.

Based on previous reviews, I added a can of cream of chicken soup and cut the broth to one and a half cans. I used half of a rotisserie chicken instead of canned chicken. This recipe is SO DELICIOUS! I've already shared it with three other people who love it, too.

Disappointing. I am very sorry to say that this just did not satisfy my tastebuds. If you drain and rinse your black beans well, it will not turn your soup gray. It was nice and colorful. I also added a little cilantro per other reviews. It is very fast to make, however. I just did not enjoy this recipe. Sorry.

This was a very easy and very good soup.  I used a cooked chicken (that I shredded) from the local food store.  I used small white beans and added shredded chedder cheese on top.  This made enough for two dinners.

Followed the advice with tomato paste, cilantro, taco seasoning and sour cream. Added green onions. Sliced up some flour tortillas into strips and fried it in olive oil. Instead of canned chicken used Louis Rich's italian seasoned grilled chicken strips. Served with lime-seasoned Tortilla chips. Yum!

Excellent.  I used a can of white beans plus a can of chile beans, no black beans, and I  added about a cup of elbow macaroni and brought the soup to a boil for a minute, then let it simmer about 10 more. I also added a package of taco seasoning.  A real filling, tasty meal.  Thanks!

Quick and delicious!  I substitute one can of the chicken broth with cream of chicken soup, and I use salsa rather than diced tomatoes.  Substitute white cannellini beans since other readers commented that black beans made the soup gray.  I will definitely make this soup again and again and again.

OK, for a just out of the cupboard meal. I thought the taste was very bland.

It was great! I will definitely make it again and play with the items that I toss in. I used the canned chicken but in the future I will cook chicken breasts to use (the canned chicken is a little fatty).  I also left out one can of broth to make it thicker and more like a stew.  I topped with some light sour cream and it was delish and quick!

Very good.  If you don't want your soup to be purple from the black beans I recommend rinsing them before putting them in the soup.  I added garlic powder and onion salt to taste.  I used cooked chicken breast meat instead of the canned.  Was great with chedder and tortilla chips.  Fairly healthy as well.

I loved this recipe. It was so easy. I altered it a bit by not adding the beans (not a bean lover) and adding cooked chicken breasts that I cut up and browned with onions. It is great and I will prepare it again and again. Thanks

This soup was excellent.  I added half a packet of ranch seasoning and some taco seasoning, which gave it a little kick.  Served it with corn bread. Yummy!

This soup is AWESOME!!!  You can't find an easier recipe and it tastes great!  One thing to add:  make sure you add tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese to your shopping list because those 2 ingredients don't go in automatically.

Well I took the advice of others and used chicken and rice soup and chicken breasts.  My husband who is not a soup guy, loved this and so did I.  We would prefer it to be a little hotter so next time I think I will add a small can of green chilies.

Took others suggestion and changed one chicken broth to cream of chicken soup.I didn't have diced tomatoes with green chile peppers so I just used diced tomatoes and added some salsa to it. Added some parsley and it tasted great! It's a must serve with cheese and tortilla chips:)

I guess I expected more of this recipe from the 5-star rating given by so many people. It was a disappointment. Had an odd color (I think due to the black beans) and a more watery texture from the tortilla soups I'm used to. I suppose being all from canned goods, it's OK. It's certainly easy enough. But it doesn't hold a candle to some of the homemade recipes.

I wasn't sure how good the soup would be, I mean six cans and you have chicken tortilla? But I must say it was pretty tasty. Based on previous reviewers I used 1 can chicken broth and 1 can cream of chicken soup. I also added in cooked white rice and cooked it in a crock pot for 6 hours. I sliced up avacado and seasoned it with lime juice. Then crumbled tortillas chips over it. Very good! Don't let the brownish color scare you though, it is just from the black beans, which I suggest draining if it will bother you. Overall, I will make again when I am in a pinch for a quick and tasty meal. Thanks!

Every time I make this recipe, my husband loves it - no matter how I make it, no matter what the ingredients! Thank you Terryn for sharing! Today's substitutions included: lentils for black beans, 4 oz tomato sauce and hot sauce to taste for the diced tomatoes/chiles. To make this low sodium I used no salt added corn, lentils, and tomato sauce. The stock/broth was also low sodium.

Great recipe!  I make a few changes.  Instead of 2 cans of chicken broth, I use one chicken broth and one condensed tomato soup.  I also add 1/3 to 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning.  Sometimes I add minced onion and/or garlic powder.  This soup also freezes well.

I loved this soup and so did my friends!  I used real chicken breast meat since the canned stuff is too gross for me.  I also added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and a little bit of cilantro.  It is great.  Next time I may omit the cilantro since a few people don't like it.

Very, very good for a such an easy soup!  I added lots of fresh cilantro, cumin, and chili powder.  Also, rinse the chicken and black beans well before adding to the soup.  The first time I made it, I just dumped it all in and the soup was an ugly brownish gray color.  But the taste was still great.  I use frozen or fresh corn because I don't really like canned corn.  I was very pleasantly suprised to find that canned chicken isn't too bad (I've never used it before), although I still prefer to poach a chicken breast and cube the meat instead.  I'll probably keep these ingredients on hand all the time now!

It doesn't get any easier than this recipe... and soooo good!  I added 2 cups of colby jack cheese, 1 extra can of chicken broth, 2 cups (cooked) brown rice, 4 tablespoons fresh ground pepper, and a 1 oz bunch of fresh chopped cilantro.  Makes plenty for leftovers.

I loved this, so simple! I added cumin and chili powder. I also added some uncle Ben's. But I didn't add enough liquid. Next time more broth/water for the amount of rice. I think it should only need about 1/2 cup of the rice.

This was fantastic! I doubled the recipe and had a lot of leftovers which did NOT go to waste. I too added some extra spices (cumin, garlic, taco seasoning mix) to taste and it was great and so fast. Served with corn bread. Big hit! I may add Cilantro next time.

This was FABULOUS - could not have been faster, easier or tastier.  I also used leftover chicken breast which shredded and topped it with colby/jack cheese, and cubed avocado.  This would be so easy to adjust to individual tastes too - add a dash of cayenne pepper sauce, some cumin and chili powder for a kick or creamed corn for a creamier consistency - but as is it is great too - what a find, thank you!!

I substituted two chicken breasts chopped instead of the can chicken.  I seasoned chicken with talk of seasoning.  I used frozen corn instead of can.  I also use one can of creamed chicken soup and one can chicken broth instead of two broth chicken.

what a joy this was! i doubled the recipe and subbed one can of corn for creamed corn and also one can of chicken stock was replaced with cream of chicken soup (with one can of water). i added a can of diced green chili's and some frozen veggies. topped with cheese and sour cream. also, i fried up some strips of corn tortillas in a little olive oil until crispy and golden and put them in the bottom of a soup mug and topped with the soup.
this really is absolutely delicious! i did spice with a little cumin and dried basil and chili powder. thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night and I have to say it was really tasty and quick to make.  I did look at how some people tweaked the recipe in the reviews to add some flavor, and so I tried a bit of my own.  First I sauteed some chopped onions and minced garlic before adding the canned ingredients.  I rinsed the beans thoroughly like many suggested.  I added a little bit of dried oregano and some chili powder and a little bit of mild salsa.  I also used chiken stock instead of broth. I baked some tortillas in the oven and broke them up into pieces to put at the bottom of the bowls.  Yum.

FABULOUS! I have a family of six and my husband and I both work. I need dinners to be fast and easy!! This was GREAT!! The kids loved it, and I will make this often. I doubled the recipe. I used frozen corn instead of canned. I also added some taco seasoning, chili pepper, cumin, two extra cans of beans, and a can of cream of chicken soup. I used corn starch to make it a bit thicker. We garnished with sour cream and cheese. Very easy, fast, and tasty!!

Delicious + quick and easy to make!  One highly-recommended substitution: use chopped chicken breast in place of the canned chicken.

This is a favorite among my picky daughters.  It is requested through out the year by them. I do not add anything extra to the recipe as they are not a fan of spicy foods.  It is a favorite of mine because it tastes good and it is quick and easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good,considering everything came from a can. But for our taste i had to add more spices like cumin powder, salt, chilli powder, taco seasoning and garlic powder.Added a spoonful of sour cream and tortillas and cheese...quite filling.

I thought this was okay, my sisters liked it though, although they said it tasted great when you first take a bite, but the excitement dies off as you continue eating it.  I agree with past reviews, it was bland. I had to add cumin and top it off with sour cream, hot sauce, and cilantro to help it.  I suggest to put the tortilla chips after you spoon the soup in the bowls, because it got soggy really quick and we had to keep adding more chips.  As easy as it was, I doubt I'd make it again.

Make sure to drain and rinse black beans, otherwise, the soup is gray and not as aesthetically appealing.. although, still no doubt excellent in taste.

This was pretty bland as it was.  I took the advice of others and added garlic, chili powder, cumin, and pepper.  It was still pretty bland, so I added about 1/2 cup of salsa to it as well.  That definitely gave it a southwest taste, and it turned out okay.  It was quick and easy, though.

This was awesome for being so easy.  To cut back on sodium, I rinsed and drained the beans; used no salt can of corn and low sodium chicken broth. Also added some cumin. I also fried strips of corn tortilla instead of store bought tortilla chips.  I did use the precooked southwest chicken like others have suggested.  Topped with lite sourcream, avocado and cheese.  Filling by itself.

This is super-easy and tastes great but needs a kick!  Try using Rotel tomatoes and green chilis with medium heat. That'll do the trick.

Especially considering how easy this is, this was really good.  Lots of flavor.  Even my husband who claims to "hate" beans had seconds.  I used boullion cubes rather than broth (3 cubes, 3 1/2 cups water), and added a half jar of jalepenos (we like spicy!).  Also, per other reviews, added chopped garlic and a dash of each cumin, chili powder, pepper, and garlic powder.  Already decided this will be a regular stand-by meal!

Very good as well as quick and easy.  For my second bowl I put the tortilla chips on top and I liked it better that way since the chips stayed crispier longer.  Maybe a little dollop of sour cream on top would be nice too.

Very good. I substituted chicken for canned chicken and I replaced one can chicken broth with one can cream of mushroom.

This recipe could not be easier. The only thing that I did differently was to blend the ingredients prior to adding my own cooked chicken, just delicious.

This was really great.  Quick & easy too.  I only had a few minutes before out of town family arrived for lunch.  I used boneless chicken strips and browned them in the pot before adding the cans. Then I substituted a can of cream of chicken soup for one of the cans of broth. Also used the mild tomatoes with green chilies.  It was spicer than I expected.  No need to add any seasoning.  Everyone ate it--even my VERY picky father-in-law.

Excellant!  I love to cook soups and this was by far the simplest and tastiest.  I did not change a thing.  (except I did not have diced tomatoes w/ green chilis so I added a can of green chilis...it was wonderful)  My partner is a firefighter and is going to make this at the firehouse!

Excellent!  We loved it!  I added fresh chopped cilantro and a few dashes of ground cumin and chili powder.  It was fabulous with crushed tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream on top.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'm keeping this one very close!

This soup was very good and easy. I think I will try navy beans instead of black beens next time. Even after rinsing beans, the soup had a grey color that was not appealing.

Fabulous!  It was loved by all!  I had to double the recipe for my big family and used a can of black beans with a can of pintos.  I added cumin and cilantro as recommended by others.  A definite keeper!

Easy and delicious!  I suggest using those new Doritos "gold" tortilla chips.  They are thicker and tastier and perfect with this soup!

Amazing that something so simple can be so good!  I used a couple of chicken breasts, cooked and chopped, as well as fresh tomatoes from my garden with a small can of green chilies.  I also added a little bit of cumin and chili powder to spice it up a bit.  Great recipe that is destined to become a mainstay at our house.

This was pretty good but I think it needs a little more of a kick-some chili powder, cumin &/or cayenne, to one's taste.  I added some slivered cooked chicken instead of the canned chicken.

My husband and I just loved this!  It was so easy and delicious, especially on these cold days.  I added extra sharp cheddar cheese and crushed Doritos.  I also used diced tomatoes with jalepenos rather than chilles.

I loved this!  I only used one can of chicken broth, and instead included the juices/water from the canned chicken, corn, and tomatoes.  I also added about a cup of kidney beans, some fresh ground pepper, and a few dashes of roasted garlic hot sauce.  I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious! A soup that pleased 3 of 4 family members.  This was quick, too. I threw it in the crockpot on high for 1.5 hours while we were gone. Added a small amount of oregano and cilantro. A big thumbs up!

We loved it! I added tortilla chips and cheddar cheese to the bowls first...then poured the hot soup ontop. It was LOVED and will be fixed regularly! Perhaps a few sprigs of cilantro and strips of avocado will be added next time! Yum!

My husband loved this soup.  I used frozen corn instead of canned.  I also followed the suggestion of other reviewers and substitued 1 can of cream of chicken for part of the chicken broth and added some cumin.  I don't know if I would add the creamed soup again, or just stir a little sour cream into the soup for those who think the chilies are too warm.  Regardless, the recipe is a quick meal of things already in my cupboard.

I thought this soup was just average but my husband liked it a lot.  Perhaps that is because I rinsed the black beans and drained the can of chicken to save a little on salt.  It did, however, taste better the second day.

I really enjoyed it.  I dropped strips of flour tortillas in the soup.  It was great.  I may add more broth next time, I ran out before I ran out of the other ingredients.
