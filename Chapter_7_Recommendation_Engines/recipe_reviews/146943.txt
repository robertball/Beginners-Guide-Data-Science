Absolutely fantastic! Did once without cilantro (at the request of my mother) and then again later when she wasn't visiting. Personally, I think the cilantro really adds some zip to the whole thing - don't leave it out if you have the choice! Still, even without the cilantro, this is a GREAT recipe. Lots of zing and heat. Edit: If you're having trouble forming a patty with this recipe - An easy trick is to use two forks so that you don't over-handle the meat. Overlap pieces together, start small and work your way up, keeping the patty even throughout. Don't smash anything down! You might want to add a cup of oatmeal or breadcrumbs if you're really having a hard time of it.

We have made this burger several times already... it is so delicious!  It's also a fun one to experiment with, adding new and unique ingredients.  A word of caution if you experiment though.... my husband and I did find is that if you add too many 'wet' ingredients, the burgers won't stick together and become difficult to grill.  Perhaps the addition of breadcrumbs or instant rice might combat this.  Otherwise, this burger gets our stamp of approval!  It is PACKED with flavor!

These burgers were absolutely delicious, so flavorful. Served them at a BBQ and everyone ate them up. Loved the horseradish mayo, a real bonus.

Good taste, but it was pretty hard to get them to stick together. If you squeeze the patties out inside paper towels before putting them on the grill, that helps.

Loved this burger!I never leave comments for recipes,but this was so good I just had to!I used sour cream instead of yogurt and I can defintly see why some people used breadcrumbs to help hold it together.I didn't but I dont see how they could do anything but help,I used a george foreman grill so no flipping was needed so that probably helped keep it together.So yummy defintly a must try!

I would definitely make these again. 
I didnt grill them since I dont have a grill on hand, but I imagine they are just as good grilled as they were when i made them on the griddle.
I had many compliments

These were just ok. I was so excited after all the great reviews but they were very mushy. The only change I made was to substitute sour cream for the yogurt like others had done. The flavor was good but just too mushy. Sorry!

This is a good burger.  I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly until it was time to mix the seasoned yogurt in with the meat.  I realized that if I mixed the entire amount I would have a soup that would not hold together on the grill.  So I mixed what seemed to make sense and had about half the yogurt mixture left when I was done.  Next time I might try the suggestion of mixing in some oatmeal to help them hold together.  Anyway, everyone liked them at the party, even though my husband thought some may not.  Even the well done burgers were juicy and full of flavor.  I will use this recipe again.

Good burger. I suggest using less cayenne & pepper... a wee bit spicy. Topped with bacon.

Used 1/2 c. sr. cream (vs. 3/4 c. yogurt).  Was still crumbly and too spicy for my liking.

I used half the red pepper and people still thought it was spicy. I thought it was the perfect amount of heat. Burgers tended to fall apart so I added bread crumbs.

Burger was ok.  My husband thought the buger would have been better without the cilantro, just seemed out of place. I thought the burger was maybe too salty, just didn't taste right.

Don't get me wrong...these burgers are good...but WAY too many ingredients for the outcome!  You can pretty much only taste the onions, garlic, and hot sauce....so the rest is sort of a waste.  All in all they just sort of tasted like a spicy version of the burgers I usually make.

If you are looking for a quick fix, this is not your recipe. But if you want to make deluxe-burgers, go for it! I have done these burgers several times now and only get compliments. Only thing I recommend changing as other reviewers said is adding 1 cup of oats to be able to handle the meat easier. Also if you have kids, I would recommend cutting the black & cayenne pepper by half. Thank you for sharing this excellent recipe!

I keep finding myself coming back to this recipe when making hamburgers.  The one ingredient I consistently don't have on hand, however, is horseradish... yet the burgers are still delicious.  When short on other ingredients, I have made substitutions with success.  For instance, sour cream is an acceptable sub for yogurt, 1 tsp dried subs for 1Tb fresh parsley, and chipotle powder -or you can grind dried chipotles - with a splash of vinager works if you don't have chipotle hot sauce.  I didn't have low-sodium soy sauce; so I used regular and cut back on the salt.  As long as you keep close to the essential flavors of the recipe's ingredients, it's a real winner.  And although I normally DO put bleu cheese on hamburgers, I think these are better without it.  Hubby and I hate to overpower these burgers' flavor.

Great burger! I used olive oil to saute the onions and garlic. I put a small amount of BBQ sauce and may on the bun with a fresh avocado and enjoyed bliss!! It turned out quite juicy as well. I will be making lots of these.
I too went shopping for most of the ingredients and it was well worth it.

I've made these burgers several times, and they always turn out great.  Occasionally I don't have yoghurt in the fridge so I have used sour cream or creme fraiche, and they work just as well.  Plus it's near impossible to find chipotle sauce in the UK so I just use fresh chillies. Fab recipe!

I have to say it was "fun" to make.  I like the idea of sauted onions, sourcream/yogurt with horse radish, and all the seasonings...but something in there needs a tweak.  I had to add bread crumbs too so it would hold together.

Edit: My husband loved it, so I gave this a second try.  I still had to add the bread crumbs. Half the cayenne makes the point.  And I guess this recipe will be a keeper.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe although it had a nice spicy bite to it. I followed the recipe exactly and although it has good reviews I found it was more interesting than delicious to my food critics. The burgers held their juice well but the flavor mixture was a bit off. I am giving it 3 stars because my 6yrs old loved it- but he will eat just about anything.

Amazing!  Divided ingredients between a pound of beef and a pound of turkey.  Both were incredible.  Family absolutely loves it.  Definite keeper.  Doesn't even really need condiments or cheese.  I just used arugala, avocado, and tomatoes on whole wheat buns.

This turned out well, however, the texture of the cooked burger was a bit soft for me. Probably because of the amount of yogurt called for.  The only change I made was to omit the cayenne and hot sauce (we're wimps) and I added about 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke.  The flavor was really good.  Not sure I'd go to the trouble again.

This was a great recipe. It was tasty and all the ingredients enhanced the flavor of the beef but did not dominate it. I also added a chili pepper to the mixture for a bit of extra kick.

Wow, awesome burger. I actually did not grill it though. I seared  each patty for 45 seconds on each side in a iron frying pan and then I did a convectional bake in the oven at 450F for 15 minutes. I added smoked gouda on top of each patty for the last three minutes.

The burgers fell apart on the grill but the taste was fine.  The leftovers I will remake into sloppy joes and serve on toast.

Spicy, yes; but not all that delicious.  'Not bad for sure, just not amazing.  I halved the spices since kids might try.  With half, still a nibble of heat (not really flavor, but heat).  'Not a lasting heat, like jalapenos.  I'd think recipe as is would produce a more than mild, almost medium, heat; a good bite (yes, bite).  :)

Definitely the best home made burger I have ever had! After my hubby was diagnosed with high blood pressure I've had a heck of a time trying to find good recipes to replace our old salt laden faves. I took out the salt and the soy sauce and used tobasco said instead of the hot sauce. Used a whole wheat bun and Swiss cheese. The spice is what will keep us coming back to this gorgeous recipe. However I would greatly recommend cutting they cayenne, pepper and horseradish in half or quarters if you are feeding that to the youngings. He's the burger connoisseur, so I am incredibly pleased to have found something he'll enjoy instead of just put up with. Thank you !!!

I needed to cut the liquid ingredients by 1/2 to get them to hold together.  Taste was very good.

verry flavour packed burger with a little kick. didn't have mustard, cilantro or chipoltle. I substituted parsley for the cilantro and added a pinch more cayanne and a pinch of dried chilies to make  up for no chipoltle. they were delicious and pretty easy too.

Was a whole lot of herbs and spices going on in this burger, a little too much for me. But my family really enjoyed it.

I wasn't a fan of these burgers. I felt that the mix of seasonings and sauces just didn't blend well together. They kind of overpowered the burger. I gave this recipe 3 stars only because my husband liked it but I won't be making these again.
