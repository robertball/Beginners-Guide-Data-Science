These cookies are a good way to use up extra tahini.  They are good but they didn't leave me dying for more.  I increased the orange juice to 4 tbsp because the cookies were so crumbly these just fell apart.

Hey, just a footnote: the ingredients should read "multigrain HOT cereal"; like oatmeal, only multigrain.  Enjoy, I hope!

I was looking for a recipe using almond paste and meal in drop cookie form and made these with a few changes based on what I had and what my family likes BUT they came out really well. I gave four stars because the cereal was confusing. First of all, I didn't have tahini so I used peanut butter. I don't use eggs so I used egg replacer. A bit extra almond paste (7 oz tube total) seemed to make up the extra stickiness. I don't generally have orange juice around the house so I used cider. I hadn't heard the bit about using a multigrain cereal so I did use a flake. Luckily it was a very robust whole grain flake so it was fine. Next time is try oats but otherwise I'm incredibly pleased. They came out slightly crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle. They didn't spread too much (though I did use cold butter, let stand mixer do the work, and I refrigerated dough afterwards. MOST IMPORTANTLY they have that almond paste texture which I LOVE. I will try again next time I have extra tahini.

Great recipe -- I made it with whole wheat flour and it turned out great!
