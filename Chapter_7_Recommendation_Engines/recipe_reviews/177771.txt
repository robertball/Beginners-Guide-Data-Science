I make the same "Super Moist Pork Chops" with a few changes. 1. brown the chops (2 min on each side) Mix the Mushroom soup with 1/3 to 1/2 milk, I add either a can of mushrooms or saty 1/2 lb.( my favorite). Place the chops into a backing dish (spray with olive oil (any will do). Bake for 20-30 minutes at 325-350. WATCH, don't let the chops get dry. Many times I will add a little water, beer or white wine.ENJOY  KG

It was fast and easy and only required a few ingredients, however, the pork chops needed additional seasoning, were not all that moist and were not tender.  Will use this recipe again in the future if needed in a pinch.

I make these all the time. But I do Dr. them up. I'll brown the chops as written, then I'll add chopped onions and simmer till tender then add either a chicken boullion cube or beef, and instesd of water I'll use a chicken or beef broth. Yum!

I've been using this recipe for years. The chops  are too dry/chewy if overcooked either from overheating or cooking too long. Recommend liquefying soup and water prior to adding to pork chops as it will reduce cooking time.

These were pretty good.  It was super fast and simple.  Will try making in the crockpot next time because the pork chops are much more moist that way.

Adding the water didn't seem to help and just kinda made it look...gross.  Either add less water than it wants you to, or just the soup is good enough.  However, I did use "cream of mushroom" soup and it may have changed some of that.  But WOW was it good with the soup I used!

Got a "10" rating from my kids!! I made this for the first time, last night, and my 6 year old gave it a 10 !! That almost never happenes! The whole family enjoyed it, including two 9 year olds, and 21 year old, and my husband.  I took some of the suggestions from the other reviews, like brown the chops and then bake covered for 30 min (actually I did 40 minutes) at 350, and used cream of mushroom soup because I couldnt find the golden at our Walmart. I'm saving this one to my "favorites".  Oh, and btw, I used 1/2 inch chops...I thought that would be nice to know in the recipe.

This is a good base recipe. Make sure when you go to add the soup and milk/cream that you drain the oil from the pan well. Just like others, I like to season and brown my meat beforehand. Be careful though, this can be a very rich dish so potatoes or noodles underneath will be helpful.

We thought it was wonderful,  I added a slice of onion on top of each posr chop before adding the soup.  I put the lid back on and let simmer on med-low for about 20 minutes.  You didn't even need a knife, they were fork tender.  I will cook these again and again!

I thought it was ok but my family said it was a bit salty.  Seems like it is missing "something"
