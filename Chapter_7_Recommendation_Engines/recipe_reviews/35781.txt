I have been making this recipe for about 4 years now and consider it the best version of wedding soup I have ever tasted. I make a double batch of meatballs from ground sirloin, then bake them at 350 for about 12-15 minutes to get rid of the grease. I then freeze half of them for another day. Definitely use the fresh basil and onion in the meatballs, and the lemon zest in the soup. They are what set this recipe apart from the usual salty wedding soups. It also helps to use homemade or organic chicken broth.

This is good but I tried it the 2nd time with just pork meatballs and it is much tastier.
Chicken and pork mixed is also tastier than the ground beef.

Wow! I have never rated a recipe before, but I randomly came across this one and thought the ingredients sounded good. While it was cooking, my husband turned up his nose, and questioned where I got the idea from. When I served it, he coldn't stop raving, and not a drop was left. It is luscious, delectable and definitely one our new comfort foods! Don't hesitate, make it today. I would have given it six stars if it had been an option! (PS I used the spinach instead of the escarole, and we served it with a generous splash of lemon juice on each bowl)

This is a light soup that is perfect with deli sandwiches for a quick and easy summer meal. I used ground turkey in place of ground beef and added the juice of half a lemon to the pot. As others suggested, I made the meatballs as small as possible and used spinach. Even my fussy teen-aged daughter loved it. This is a great soup to serve when you want to impress someone--it looks like a lot more work would have gone into preparing it, but it's really simple and easy to make.

I have been making Italian wedding soup for years  and everyone loves it, yes it is so easy to make, but the whole idea of flavoring the chicken broth is to cook the meatballs directly in the broth, being as tiny as they are they cook very quickly. I use lemon pepper if I don't have lomon it helps brighten up the taste.

Wonderful soup - the lemon zest is mandatory! I used all the fresh herbs as recommended, plus  added more chopped green onions into the soup itself. Used fresh Italian sausage for great flavor; no escarole available so had to use spinach; added 1 med cubed red potato  (skin on) + 1/2 cup shredded carrots, then since it was a touch salty (may replace some broth with water next time), I added 1/2 cup milk and my family raved about it and a couple asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe, however, I changed it slightly by using half lean pork meat and half lean ground beef and the flavour was immensly better.

DELICIOUS!  Fresh herbs are a must to give this such flavor.  My meatballs were 1/2" and I baked them at 350 for 10 minutes to release the grease.  I like this recipe for the ease of making it in such a short time.  The only thing missing was those toasted cheddar bread cubes.  Will make again!

This soup was excellent!  I've never had Italian Wedding Soup anywhere but Atlanta Bread Co., so I was excited to see this recipe.  It was extremely easy to make - the only time consuming part being rolling the meatballs.  As per other's suggestions, I also recommend making the meatballs as small as you can roll them and have them stay together.  This recipe served 4 without ANY left-overs, so adjust accordingly.

Delicious! I was looking for something to make using ground beef because I was sick of hamburgers. What a great recipe! Used canned chicken broth so don't add any salt. Next time, I think I will add some garlic. I cannot imagine not having garlic in an Italian dish so I will include that as well. Added fresh ground black pepper too. When serving, I added shredded parmesan cheese as well as a generous squeezing of fresh lemon juice. This was very simple to prepare and looked like something very hard to prepare.

Really wonderful.  My husband had three bowls!  But I should say, inspired by some of the other tips, I did play with the recipe quite a bit.  I have a hard time serving any freshmade soup that hasn't simmered at least a couple of hours.    To start, I made the meatballs exactly as directed.  And they were wonderful.  After I'd rolled the meatballs into marble sized portions and put them back in the refrigerator to chill, I sauteed 2 chopped carrots, 1 chopped zucchini, and half an onion in a lemon/olive oil til all were soft and fragrant.  Only then did I add four cans of chicken broth, one can of beef broth, a healthy teaspoon of italian seasoning, and finally chucked in the meatballs.  I let it come to a boil, (waiting for the meatballs to rise to the top, the "done" signal) and then turned down to low to simmer for about 2 hours.  About 20 minutes before service, I cooked the pasta al dente separately.  About five minutes before service, I added the pasta into the simmering broth, as well as the lemon zest and chopped spinach.  The spinach didn't wilt overmuch that way, and retained its bright green color.    I served this with a loaf of hot bread out of the oven, a baby greens salad with strawberries, red onion and pecans, and a bottle of sauvignon blanc.  A genuine hit!  Thanks for the great idea!

amazing soup!  The meatballs are perfect and the lemon is a must!  I doubled the broth and put 1 1/2 times orzo in the soup.  Thicken the soup with a couple dashes of parmesan cheese at the finish.. A+++++

Fast & impressive!  The lemon added a nice dimension to the soup.  I will recommend only two things...add caraway to your meatballs (the secret ingrediant in italian sausage) and secondly, add a little onion and garlic to your broth. Oh...and use acini de pepe noodles instead of orzo, you wouldn't think it but, it makes a big difference!

The original recipe is a very nice base, but I found it just slightly bland so I made some additions. First of all, I made a double-batch because I had a whole pound of beef to use. I also used spinach for the escarole, and used a whole 9oz package instead of just 4 cups; I added it whole rather than slicing it. I added 1/2 tsp of granulated garlic to the meatball mixture. I also made some additions to the broth: I first lightly sauteed 1/2 a white onion, thinly sliced, and 4 cloves of minced garlic in 1/4 cup white wine and 1/2 tbsp olive oil, and added 1/2 tsp dried parsley, 1/2 tsp dried basil, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 2 bay leaves to the broth itself. The smell of the herbs and the lemon is just beautiful on the stove. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is wonderful. I recommend everyone trying it once. Due to ingredients I had on hand, I made a few changes: used dried basil and dried parsley instead of fresh; and used dried onions instead of green onions. If you do this you will need to scale down the quantity of those ingredients. This soup has awesome flavor and is very, very easy to prepare. I recommend scaling the recipe up, it says 6 servings, but my boyfriend and I ate all of it in one sitting.

I felt this had to be "doctored-up" quite a bit. Maybe my store bought canned broth wasn't as flavorful as some. ?? I am not sure. The ground beef and parmesan, etc. was not as good as wedding soups that I have made with Italian sausage. And, the broth flavor was just chicken broth, with no depth of any other flavor. I added chopped carrots, chicken boullion, lots of fresh black pepper, the juice of the lemon I zested, a cup of cream and then liked it much better but probably won't make again.

I modified this quite a bit to accommodate food allergies (beef, pork, wheat, egg, onion, milk):  Meatballs made from Jennie-O sweet Italian turkey sausage links (unbound, rolled without adding crumbs/eggs into small balls), extra torn baby spinach, brown rice instead of pasta, added pinto beans (didn’t have white cannelloni beans, as suggested by other recipes)., no cheese, dried Italian spice blend in lieu of fresh herbs.  It turned out great – the hit of the pot luck dinner!

Beautiful, healthy soup. Super easy. I substituted ingredients on hand: spinach instead of escarole; cooked, chopped sausage and turkey instead of meatballs. Because I wasn't making meatballs, I added chopped fresh basil and parsley as well. Took another reviewer's suggestion and topped each bowl with a teaspoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice, also.

This is great!  I love how the broth soaks up the flavor from the meatballs as they cook!    I wanted something between italian wedding soup, a traditional pasta dish and stew so I changed it a bit to suit my mood,  so here is my version.  2 cups of water quart of canned tomatoes enough bouillon for the 5 3/4 cups of broth -  Start boiling immediately so liquids have time to reduce. Make your meatballs to suit yourself. And drop 'em in as suggested in the original recipe. -  I added extra noodles, about 1 cup (used broken up linguine cause I didn't have orzo) -  I also added a few cloves of garlic and extra spinach, cause I love garlic... And spinach!  ; )

We've made this several times, and love it!  I make it with ground turkey, as I don't like ground beef, and seasoned the meatballs with additional salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  love this, it's a keeper!

Excellent soup.  Love the "punch" from the lemon jest.  I used ground chicken; otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  A winner!

This was very good.  I've made it twice now and it's quick and easy.  I leave out the lemon zest but do use lemon juice.  I also added some parmesan cheese to the pot instead of sprinkling it on afterwards.

Great recipe!
I added the juice of 1/2 lemon, which really complimented the soup.

This was delicious- the lemon adds a really nice dimension to it. I made it low sodium/vegetarian using l.s. veggie broth and packaged veggie 'meatballs'. I also subbed spinach for the escarole and a can of l.s. white kidney beans for the orzo (I was out). Topped each serving with a squirt of lemon juice and sliced green onions on top and fresh garlic bread on the side. Hubby really enjoyed it and suggested I make it for the family holiday gathering. Thanks DPATEL!

it's ok.  I liked the lemon zest- it's a very unique flavor.   What I didn't like was the soup was way too greasy.  I used extra lean ground beef. Not sure what happened.

This soup turned out delicious! Instead of hamburger I used Italian chicken sausage and the meatballs were wonderful. The only time consuming step was forming the meatballs but I doubled the recipe so that makes sense. I wasn't sure how to grate fresh basil so I tried, gave up and then minced it. Very good for a chilly day. I served it with a loaf of crusty italian bread which was perfect.

The only thing I changed was I used half of a lemon rind and it was perfect. I think a whole one would have been too much. The only bad thing is it doesn't make enough...we finished the whole pot! My kids never ask for seconds. In fact, I have to make another batch tonight because my older daughter wants it for lunch tomorrow.

This has become a staple in our home from dinner parties to everyday eating.  The only thing I change is I substitute 1/2 of the ground beef with italian sausage.  Excellent!

I loved this!  I made a few changes, but it was great. I am a vegetarian so I used one bag of Quorn "meatballs" instead of making my own.  I also used a vegetable stock instead of chicken.  The stock is very low sodium (45mg), so I added a little salt and pepper as well.  Lastly, I don't really like lemon so I only used half, and it was actually a great addition. I put the green onion right in the broth, since I wasn't making my own meatballs.  This soup was light and had tons of flavor without the salt.  Will definitely be making this again.

Holy Cow this was delicious and amazingly easy to make! The only complaint I have is that, as written, it does not have enough liquid in it and would not feed 6 people as written. I used 12 cups of chicken stock, doubled the meatball ingredients,kale (can be interchanged with escarole as far as my tastes are concerned), and orzo. With the doubling I had enough for about 8 servings--perfect.

Yummy, yummy, yummy...I love soup in my tummy!  I made the meatballs with a mixture of Italian sausage and ground beef and baked them in the oven for 10 minutes.  I hunted high and low, and thankfully I found acini de pepe pasta for a more authentic wedding soup! Topped it with fresh shaved Parmesan Reggiano curls.  Leftovers were even better the next day.  The fresh lemon and herbs make this soup!

AWESOME! I DID BROIL THE MEAT BALLS. I ALSO BUY ROTISSORIE CHICKEN A LOT FROM B.J'S. I ALWAYS KEEP THE JUICES AND USE FOR COOKING.(COOL FIRST TO REMOVE MOST OF THE FAT). I ADDED SOME SOME OF THESE JUICES AND THIS MADE FOR A VERY RICH TASTING SOUP.

Hubby loved this version of soup.  It tastes so fresh, I add just a touch of lemon juice with the zest and I use spinach in place of the escarole.  Be sure to add the parsley or green onions for color.  I also make the meatball tiny, about the size of a grape.

This recipe is one of my all time favorites...The only change is that I use Vegetable broth instead of Chicken broth and I chop the basil quite fine...Sliced Mushrooms can also be added to the broth.

Wonderful recipe.  I substituted 1 Tbsp lemon juice for the zest.  I also thinly sliced one peeled potato to put in and added a package of 3 cheese tortellini.  I did not have any fresh spices so used half the amount in dried basil and parsley.  We will have this one again. Even better the next day, but had to add some water to make it soup again.

Good soup and easy.  Lemon zest is a great addition.  The store wasn't carrying escarole or any good substitute, so i tried spinach one time (good) and kale another (not as good).  If you use spinach don't let it cook for long.

Excellent and light...I used 8c of fat free reduced sodium chicken broth and also made my meatballs out of extra lean ground chicken, used fresh baby spinach and also added a shredded carrot. Loved the scallions and lemon flavor in this soup. I did add the orzo after I cooked it as not to make the soup starchy. Will make again. Thanks!

Five stars for being quick, simple and delicious. I always make extra meatballs and store them (pre-baked) in the freezer. I dropped them at the same time as the orzo and it was all ready at the same time. My only alterations were to use veggie broth and add a 14 oz. can of cannellini beans. I baked some fresh croutons and passed them with the soup. Yummy!

I made this recipe to a 't' with the exception of swapping out basil for lovage and thyme (what I had in my garden) and using slightly less chicken stock. I had to add a lot more liquid to the stock and ended up with a plain broth and relatively tasty meatballs. If I made this again I would have to add herbs and possibly veggies (carrots, potatoes, celery). Thank you for sharing this recipe, I'm sorry I didn't like it more!

This is not your ordinary Italian Wedding Soup recipe; the addition of lemon zest makes this extraordinary.  Reminds me a bit of a soup made in Greece using meatballs and orzo and lemon.  The only addition I recommend is cannelini beans.  I cook them up in the pressure cooker and add, but you could easily drain and add the canned variety.  Gives added taste and health bonus.  Enjoy!

I made my own meatballs with half ground turkey and half lean ground beef and my own seasonings including lots of minced garlic.  I then followed soup recipe to a "T".  The lemon zest really perks up the flavors.  I did put a pinch of red pepper flake it to bring a little heat to the broth.  We love any soup with fresh greens.

Make a double batch to use a full pound of ground beef, if you feed a big family or a crowd. The leftovers are even better than the first day!

EXCELLENT!  I used the small frozen Costo Meatballs and they worked absolutely perfect.  Make sure you don't leave out the lemon zest as this is really what makes this soup unique.  LOVE IT.

Awesome! Thanks!

Just for interest sake, we found out (accidentally), that if you double the pasta and let it sit for while, it will turn into a caserole! It seems better as a soup. ^_^

Tasty! I didn't have lean beef so I boiled my meatballs in a separate pot of water for about two minutes, drained them, then added them to the broth. That removed a lot of grease that I'm glad didn't end up in my soup. I also added a little fresh oregano and some fennel seeds to the meatballs. This recipe is a keeper.

This soup was excellent!  I used the ground turkey method that some others suggested.  The lemon zest was right on the money, also used the juice in the soup.  So easy also, will make again & again!

This soup is simple and superb.  Definitely the fresh herbs allow the meatballs to come alive, and the meatballs should be made no bigger than 1/2 inch across.  The fresh lemon zest is what allows this soup to sparkle.  I will make this again and again!

This recipe gets rave reviews whenever it is served. Use beef, turkey, or your own mixture for the meatballs, it doesn't matter.  The soup is terrific and the lemon zest adds a touch not found in most soups.

This is way better than the canned stuff!  I made my meatballs with ground turkey and added extra parm. cheese to them.  I also didn't have any spinach, so used kale instead, which made it very yummy!

This is not only an exceptionally tasty soup, but it is also a very forgiving recipe.  I only wrote down the ingredients, and just threw it together.  I realized after that the onions should've been in the meatballs instead of the broth - same w/parmesean ( I thought that was only on top).  It still tasted great!!  I used acini de pepe instead of orzo, and I added garlic to meatballs and broth.  I also added carrots to for a more vibrant color, and left out basil as I didn't have any. I found extra water was needed to accomodate what the pasta soaked up. The whole family loved this soup, and it was fast and easy to make.  Will make it a regular.

I used spinach and turkey and fresh herbs.  It was very easy to make and very good, but my friend has a better recipe.  The next day, it got really bitter and did not taste as good.

Excellent and easy recipe. My  husband likes it so well I have made it at least once a week for the last month so I felt compelled to comment.  I substituted spinache and used ground turkey and it was excellent.

This was a very refreshing soup.  The lemon zest was perfect and the meatballs were wonderful.  Make them small, so you get one in each spoonful of broth.  Thank you, for this recipe I will be making it often!

I added 2 cups of water to the broth to tone it down and boiled the meatballs a little longer to pick up their flavour instead.  It turned out great!  Will definitely make again!

This was amazing!  A few notes I would like to share:
for the meatballs (1/2 turkey, 1/2 pork), I added salt, pepper, oregano and garlic powder.  
Broth - I used homemade chicken stock to begin with.  Before I poured the broth into the stockpot I sauteed a bit of diced onion (frozen, about 1/4 bag), garlic, finely diced carrots (in the food processor), salt and pepper in olive oil and white wine.   I then added the stock and began to prepare the soup.  I also added some fresh chopped parsley along with the spinach (instead of escarole, which I couldn't find).  I used more than 2 cups of spinach.  Instead of zesting a lemon, I used the juice from half of lemon in the soup.  I also used acini di pepe.  Finally, I added parmesan cheese to the soup.  Delicious!

This is the best soup ever!  I add lemon juice and use Minor's chicken base for the stock.  My son calls this the meatball soup and asks for it all the time.

Came across this recipe last minute on my way to the grocery store. Let me just say this is delicious. Doubled the recipe for the meatballs because I have a very hungry 6'5" boyfriend and wanted something more filling. I also added a bit more orzo. It became more of a stew then a soup. Also didn't have any fresh herbs so I used all dried and also used fresh spinach instead. Will make this again soon. This is a must try!!!!!!!!

This is a very easy and tasty recipe.  I changed the basil to fresh cilantro.  I also used half a cup of fresh parmesan instead of the dry kind.  Also, the first time I made it, the ozro soaked up the majority of the broth, so the second time I used 7 cups of broths.

We enjoyed this! My husband and I really liked the addition of the lemon zest. I did add some carrots and celery, just to bulk it up a bit (just sweated them in a little EVOO for about five minutes before adding the broth). Tasty soup, served with some crusty baguettes.

I have been counting calories and love soup so when I stumbled upon this I was so excited to try it! I was leary about the lemon zest, but to my surprise I loved it and feel it gives it a nice "clean" taste appeal! It was SO GOOD I made it twice in 2 wks! :) I think the meatballs are excellent and used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I added 1lb of meat to make 24 meatballs and chopped a little more spinach...bc why not right? Then added cut up carrots for extra color, and another couple cups of broth (just to accommodate my "extras") and those are the only adjustments I made purely on my own taste. Seriously excellent and I will no doubt be craving this soup quite often!

Made Spanakopita, Greek spinach pie, the other day and was out of fresh spinach so I used sliced fresh mushrooms in it's place and served with spinach pie on the side. The dishes actually went well together. The soup was tasty, very easy and pretty quick to make.

Being that I had between 3/4 and 1 lb ground beef I increased the broth to 8 cups and added an extra egg, an extra TBLS of bread crumbs, 3 green onions instead of 2, a heaping TBLS of parmesan/romano cheese and a full cup of orzo. I also didn't have the fresh basil or Italian flat parsley, so I used about 2 TBLS regular fresh parsley and 1 TBLS dried basil. Tried to stick to the recipe as close as I could with what was on hand, and being a mushroom lover thought they were wonderful in the soup.  

Next time I will probably tweak the broth a bit, even though it was very good with plain chicken broth from a can/box, I like the taste and benefits of cooking with fresh foods and usually include garlic, onion, celery and sometimes carrots to my chicken broth. It will increase the cooking time a bit, but think it would give the broth greater depth of flavor. Also some salt and pepper although perhaps unnecessary are always appreciated by my palate. I left it out during preparation to see if it would be missed, but added some to my bowl, my boyfriend did not.  Again, the soup was quite good without these changes and preparation was simple and quick.

GREAT starter recipe!  I used spinach instead of escarole, doubled everything except the broth (oops, more like stew), added celery and all fresh herbs, switched breadcrumbs for stale cracker crumbles, and then realized I didn't have orzo.  So I used rice instead!  I do think I'd add shedded chicken when I make this again.  Yum!

This was fantastic, and SO easy. We actually had Italian seasoned chicken meatballs with asiago in the freezer from Costco and we just used those instead. Thanks for the recipe!!

This one gets 4 stars with my alterations based on other reviews. We really loved the final result! Some people baked their meatballs before adding to the broth, however I agree that the juices from the meat cooking in the broth really adds to the flavor of the overall soup - besides, it's extra lean so the fat content is greatly reduced.  My meatballs were 1/2" round, and it made about 40. Changes made were: Add 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to the meatball mix; before adding broth to the pot, saute 1 chopped leek, 2 chopped ribs of celery, 1 chopped zucchini, and 2 chopped carrots in butter/oil; after the veggies have softened, add a couple minced cloves of garlic, cooking until fragrant, then add 8 cups of broth; when the soup is almost done, add 2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning and salt & pepper to taste; stack a small pile of baby spinach leaves and chop into thin strips, place strips in the bottom of each bowl and ladle the soup over (this will prevent the spinach from wilting too much in the overall batch).

The meatballs are excellent with the fresh basil but after the soup was finished, even with the wonderful addition of the lemon zest, I felt the flavor was somewhat flat.  I do use a low sodium chicken broth, so perhaps that made a difference.   After spiking  the soup with a bit of Penzey’s chicken soup base and adding some cooked carrots for both flavor and presentation, the end result was a soup we really enjoyed.  It was even better the day after it was made.

This is really, really good and easy to make.  Definately use the fresh basil, parsley and lemon as described.  Great as leftovers in lunches.

Absolutely delicious, not to mention easy to make. I used Canned Spinach, Ground Turkey and dried herbs and it still was fantastic. The hubby had two bowls. Will definately make this one again!

I love this soup, and this is by far my most favorite recipe on this site. Imake it at least once a month. After making it so many times, I usually tweak it a bit each time (extra orzo, garlic, celery, extra salt, etc.), but this is a great recipe!

Easy and flavorful.  I used spinach instead of the other.  A nice change from chicken noodle on a cold winter day.

I added pepper & lemon juice to this and I think it really helped.  I used bouillon instead of chicken broth and I think that was a BAD idea!  I'll try again with chicken broth.

Wow this was really great.  I was able to find ground italian sausage near the store prepared meats and used that instead of ground beef. formed small meatballs and baked until brown in the oven so that they do not come out gray as some other users suggested.  I also found and used acini de pepe instead of orzo as other users suggested and spinach instead of escarole.  Next time I may use 6 cans of chicken broth (I used 33% less sodium broth) instead of 4.  That way I will have more broth to noodles and it will also cut the lemon flavor just a little bit.  I also added two chopped green onions, a teaspoon of ground pepper, a teaspoon of chopped basil, and about 1/4 c of matchstick carrots at the beginning of the boiling process.  This was really great.  I couldn't stop eating it!!!

This was really tasty, I did use homemade chicken broth and fresh basil... yummy! I also used acini di pepe, if you plan on using this pasta I suggest using less than what the recipe calls for. I only had canned spinach on hand and it was still fabulous!

Totally enjoyed this.  I did not have seasoned breadcrumbs so I had to add my own seasonings to it.  I think I could have added more maybe garlic.  The lemon is a nice touch.  I used the spinach option.  It was very good and quick and easy to make.

I was really hoping to like this and was let down.  Too salty!!  Maybe I should have done half the chicken broth and water and then seasoned to taste.  Chicken broth is just so salty by itself.  Don't know it I'd try again.

very good.  I did substitute spinach and I omitted the lemon zest (because I didn't have any).  I did add a few splashes of lemon juice as well as some Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic and Onion Onion as it was boiling.  It turned out a bit salty, but very yummy.

This was absolutely yummy!  I wish I had made a double batch.....oh well, can make more tomorrow.  I followed the recipe exactly as shown.  As everyone said, the lemon zest and fresh herbs are what makes this so awesome.  Thank you very much for the recipe!!  Will be making it often.

I've never had Italian Wedding Soup before so have nothing to compare it to.  It turned out to be a nice lite soup for a warmer than expected day.  I made it exactly as written, omitting the green onions and using spinach.  A squeeze of lemon juice in the bowl after serving really brightened it up.  Next time I'll increase the spinach and orzo. I think I will also brown the meatballs first; they looked pretty anemic!

Loved this soup. The only change I made was to add 2 litres of chicken broth (8 cups) and made more meatballs. Excellent. Nest time i will make this using ground veal so the meatballs could be even more tender.

This is delicious.  I used acini de pepe instead of orzo as others recommended and it was good.  fresh parm is a must, as someone suggested.  And as other reviewers say, the noodles do double in size and soak up all of the broth, so I will put in fewer noodles next time.  It's not hard to make more broth, but why do it twice, right?  Great recipe!  My husband doesn't usually get as excited about soup as I do, and he liked this a lot.

This is probably the best soup I have ever had. I also used spinach instead of escarole. I made the meatballs with ground baby lamb, and the flavour was fantastic.
The lemon rind is a wonderful touch. I also used a cup of shredded carrots. I have used  orzo and thought it was good.Next time I will try to find acini de pepe in our little supermarket.
Thank you Deena for this wonderful recipe that I will put in our rotating recipe list for sure.

Tonight was my second time making this soup, and I did a couple of things differently than I did before.  I followed the suggestions of other chefs to use hot Italian sausage instead of beef, but left out the Parmesan cheese.

I browned the meatballs (on two sides) in the same pot that I made the soup in, but before I added the chicken stock, I poured off all of the fat that had cooked out of the meatballs, but leaving the little brown bits and such in the bottom of the pot.

I also used 8 cups (2, 32 oz boxes) of chicken stock.  In bringing the stock to boil I also added a generous pinch of kosher salt (roughly 2 teaspoons).  This amount of stock helped to cut the over powering lemony taste.

Like others, I used spinach because I couldn't find escarole anywhere (I haven't a clue what it looks like).

These minor alterations caused for the soup to have a lot more flavor then previously!!!  But you be the judge.

Good quick soup.  I chose ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I substituted spinach for escarole, 3 tbsp of bottled lemon juice for lemon zest, and white onion for green - just because it's what I had on hand.  I'd make this again.  Subtle lemon flavor makes the difference.

I love this recipe!  I will never buy canned italian wedding soup again.  This recipe is too easy to make and sooo delicious!  I used ground pork for the meatballs, as another reviewer suggested.  Also, I used acini de pepe pasta instead of orzo. I used spinach because my grocery store didn't have escarole. I thought this recipe was just fantastic.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe but used dried lemon peel and cooked the meatballs in the oven before so they had a better texture.

This recipe was excellent and I have already been told that I will have to make it again! I used lemon-pepper like someone suggested and it was just enough spice.

I have made this recipe for 5 years now and it is great.  However, as the picture shows there are carrots (not included in the recipe).  No matter, I put in my own for the color contrast to the spinach.  Delicious and a keeper. It is more time consuming than the recipe suggests.  The meatballs do take time and the rest is easy.

I've never had this before so I have nothing to compare this with.  I used l/2 pork and l/2 beef for the meatballs and substituted Swiss Chard for the escarole since I had tons of it on hand.  We enjoyed it - I will probably try a few different recipes for a comparison.  Thanks submitter.

I couldn't believe how easy this was!  The only changes I made were meatloaf mix for the ground beef and I added freshly ground pepper and minced garlic to the meatballs and the broth.

I used canned broth (low fat/low sodium), but I might try a better stock next time.

I use chicken stock instead of chicken broth-usually organic. Also I chop up the string carrots from the grocery store and add chopped garlic. Instead of making the meatballs I use the mini kids meatballs in the frozen section of Wegmans - easy and delicious and they are already seasoned.

This is a thin soup with very good flavor. I would recommend not putting all the pasta in so that there is enough broth for every bite. The meatballs are a great addition! :)

The lemon zest and juice really brighten the flavor of this soup!  Very versatile recipe, but made it according to recipe, using beef/veal/pork mixture instead of all beef.  Also used dried, instead of fresh, herbs.  Wonderfully balanced flavor; this one will be added to my repertoire. Fresh lemon is key!

I buy the little meatballs at my grocery store and I use shredded chicken in the soup. The chicken is very good in it and buying the meatballs saves me a lot of time.

In my 15 year old's words," The meatballs are 10 out of 10.  I like the broth from the canned stuff better."  The meatballs were excellent! I did use ground turkey, rather than beef. Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I found the broth to be flat.  It was missing something. The lemon was a nice touch.  I will absolutely make this again.  I will however add some Italian flavors to the broth.  All in all, a very good recipe.

Very good soup.  I loved the meatballs.  I had some fresh oregano from my sister's garden and used that instead of fresh basil.  Do not leave out the lemon zest.  Another small change was that I used spinach instead of escarole because this is what I had in the fridge.  Sometimes I add zucchini, sometimes I use tortellini instead of orzo - so it's not really Italian wedding soup anymore, but still very good.

Meatballs were great, but the actual stock itself was fairly bland. Do yourself a favor and add sautéed garlic and onion and some Italian seasoning while cooking, and at the end squeeze half of that zested lemon

This soup was so easy to make and tasted delicious! I added 1 cup of shredded carrots, 1/2 cup of yellow onion and a few mushrooms because I was trying to use them up before they went bad. I really liked the added flavors the extra veggies brought to the soup. I didn't have a lemon to zest so I used 2 tbsp of lemon juice instead.

I made this soup yesterday and the flavor was amazing. I did not use lemon zest because I was out of lemons. I also substituted spinach for the escarole. I didn't really care for the orzo as the soup I'm used to eating has pearl pasta. Next time I will use the pearl pasta. my family devoured this soup. I will be making this again and am saving this recipe!

I made this with pork sausage - as that's what I had in the house. I did find the lemon juice quite zippy and I probably wouldn't use more than a drop or two per bowl. Also, I needed to use more breadcrumbs ... Maybe that's just me. I used maybe double the breadcrumbs or more.  But really yummy!

So good!  This is one of my favorite soup recipes.  I make it with a splash of lemon juice and abc noodles plus extra broth as needed.  Rolling the meatballs in flour also makes them a little easier to handle and thickens the soup a little.

I was looking for a new healthy meal and found this. The only thing I altered was replacing the ground beef with ground turkey breast. I also didn't have a whole lemon the second time around so I just used a couple teaspoons of lemon juice and it worked just as well. It's now my new favorite and leftovers last me all week for lunch! Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was a very good soup, I was surprised how light and flavorful it was.  The fresh lemon zest really made it outstanding.  I think it is important to take the time to roll the meatballs really tiny to make the soup easy to eat.  I also omitted the pasta and largely increased the amount of spinach to keep the calories down.  This was filling, and kept in the refrigerator really well.  I didn't give this 5 stars because I didn't think it was "craveable".  I made it a couple of weeks ago and by the time the pot was empty I was done with it, and I haven't wanted it since.

This soup was very good!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I don't remake things too often (I either get sick of it or the recipes isn't that good). This recipe is a keeper and I'm making it again tonight!

I don't know how to zest without a zester, so I just served a lemon wedge with each bowl. Overall, a nice recipe! Using fresh herbs was definately the way to make these meatballs. I used the advice of another reviewer and cooked the meatballs in the oven first to drain fat. Next time I'll make extra to freeze! It only got four stars because of the prep it takes to do fresh herbs and roll meatballs. I also have to grind my own breadcrumbs, so it took quite a while.

This was good, but it certainly needs lots more broth and for my liking needs more pasta. I may cut back a little on meatballs next time as well. I did use fresh basil which is necessary. The only spinach I had was frozen and it worked great. I would also highly recommend to use sausage instead of hamburger. I used 1/2 Bob Evans Italian and 1/2 regular.  Wonderful tasting meat!! I will definately make this again, but w/ these changes.

This was fabulous, reminded me of my Italian routes! I couldn't find the traditional pasta, so I used orzo. Will make this again and again.

Absolutely awesome.  Such a nice "fresh" taste - must have been the lemon rind that made the difference.  It is a perfect soup as an appetizer because its "light" feeling, but also it can be used as a meal because of the meatballs. Thanks for sharing!

I would rate this a five but I felt it lacked in flavor a bit.  Once I added additional basil and seasoning, I thought it was really good.  I will definitely make it again.

I doubled this recipe, but only used the original amount of lemon zest.  We love lemons in our house, but this still had MUCH to much lemon flavor.  Everything else in the soup was tasty, we just thought the amount of lemon flavor was odd.

I just got done making this. This soup is beyond delicous! I even had 2 bowls since it was so good. The best part is, I had most of the ingredients on hand. I only had to buy spinache, I used the baby variety. I used dried herbs, a dash of basil & parsley. Used a splash of bottled lemon juice rather than lemon zest. And I used 3- 14oz cans of beef broth which came out to 5 C & 3/4 C vegetable broth that I had lying around. I loved this soup so much! I'm not a fan of canned soup. I like to make my own soups so I can control what is in them & this was so easy to make. This was a very quick & easy to make soup. I highly recommend this recipe.

Very very good soup!  The only thing I changed was that I cooked the meatballs for 10 minutes in the oven first as a reviewer suggested.  I also had a really big lemon so I didn't add all the zest, good choice I think if I did it would be too lemony for me and my family's tastes.  The only other thing I did was I didn't have any green onions for the meatballs so I used a little bit of fresh chive instead.  Great tasting, easy recipe.  I would definitely reccomend it.

I honestly thought this was mediocre at best.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor of it...nothing like Italian Wedding soup I've had and I didn't think the meatball flavor was very good.  I'll keep searching.

My family loved it. The fresh basil and lemon are wonderful and fragrant. The only change i made was i didn't have the extra lean ground beef so I boiled the meatballs is water first then drained and added to the chicken broth. Fantastic will make again and again!

This is goood soup. Will be having leftovers today. I made it with ground turkey and a bag of frozen spinach, thawed.  The 16 oz of spinach I used was way too much -- but still very good. I threw in some sliced carrot and mushrooms just because.  I also added a squeeze of lemon juice to each bowl. Thanks for an easy, yummy, healthy soup!

I thought this was great, but it needed some additions for my boyfriend and I... Added extra broth, dried oregano, red pepper, about 1 TBSP of soy sauce and a WHOLE bag of sliced baby spinach to the soup.  We also used pork for the meatballs.  It was VERY yummy and I thank you very much!

Quick, easy and deelish!  I used ground chicken for a healthier version and i forgot to add the lemon :(  Made this for a late lunch/early dinner served with some sandwiches.  Went over pretty well!

I looked for an Orzo recipe because I've had a bag for a while, and I'm so glad I picked this one!  I made this exactly as it says except I added 2c of broth because we like lots of liquid.  I also had to unfreeze a pound of hamburger to make it, which was fine with me because the kids love the meatballs!  This soup was awesome!  My 3yo had 3 bowls!
