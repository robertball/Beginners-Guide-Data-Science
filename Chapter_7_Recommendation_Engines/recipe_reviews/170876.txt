We tried this recipe tonight, and it was quite good. I did a couple of things differently though:  I used a 1 1/2 pound tenderloin, and for the vinegar I used half balsamic and half white (I was out of cider vinegar). I didn't want the pork to dry out, so I covered it for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Next time I would slice the tenderloin and mix it in with the apples and sauce - that would warm it up a bit and coat the pork as well, since much of the sauce cooks away.   As a side note, the apple sauce would be amazing on top of vanilla ice cream or french toast! It is absolutely wonderful!

This recipe was excellent and very easy to make.  I used pork chops because they were on sale that week.  You can use any cut of pork and simply adjust the cooking time accordingly (use a meat thermometer if you aren't sure).  Use whatever white wine you have around...I didn't have the one named, but it still turned out great.  The apple sauce was really great.  I will make this recipe again.

This was so good!!!! I took the suggestion and cut up the tenderloin into medallions at the end and cooked them in the apple mixture. I also doubled everything so there would be plenty of sauce - I highly recommend. I served with rice pilaf. A great meal.

Very nice flavor! I loved the smell that wafted through though house as I mixed together the apples, cinnamon and nutmeg. My only recommendation would be to brown both sides of the pork, making sure not to overcook..otherwise the meat will dry out. Set aside as directed and prepare the apple mixture. Then while apple mixure is simmering add the pork back into the pan, cover and cook for a few minutes on each side. Love, love, love the tender apples..mmmm.. so good!

This recipe was awesome!  I only changed a few things.  I doubled the apples because my family loves apples.  I knew that part would go over big.  I cooked it in my dutch oven instead of a skillet so I knew I had room for the extra apples.  I also put the meat back into the apples (not cut into medallions) and put the pot on low until my husband got home from work -- probably an extra 45 mins or so.  The meat was tender and juicy and cooked perfectly.  The apples were awesome.  I used 2 Ida Reds we will definitely have this again!  Even my 17 year old daughter who pretty much hates meant loved this.

Wow! I followed the recipe as written, with only two changes. Used a white wine that I had on hand and a small pork roast I had in the freezer. You can use whatever cut of pork you like as long as you adjust the cooking time accordingly. I recommend doubling the sauce as you'll want to slather your chops with it, or maybe keep some to top vanilla ice cream. Definite keeper!

I tried this tonight and after reading many reviews, also changed a couple of things.  I seared the loin in the olive oil, but also caramelized onions with it.  I placed it into the crock pot and once the wine/apple sauce was thoroughly simmered, I poured all of it into the crock pot with the loin and let it cook on low for 3 hours.  The loin was moist and the sauce was delicious!  Thank you, the family loved it and we'll be making this one again.

Loved this recipe did agree it was a bit sweet as written.  So instead of a Riesling I used a Moscato, used agave instead of brown sugar and added a pinch of cloves to the fresh apples red delicious apples.  I also doubled the sauce and glad I did as my family loved it.

Yes,it's easy and it is good,but,trust me,the optimum time for pork tenderloin is 20 minutes,not a second more. Oh yeh,after browning,cook it in the oven,not the pan, 180degrees for that 20 minutes. Just MHO.

FABULOUS!!!!!  You will love it!!!   Even my picky eater (son) liked it!  I ended up doubling the sauce ingredients.  I combined them with the apples and after 5 minutes the liquid cooked down, so I added the same amount again and cooked for 5 more minutes.  Then I added the cornstarch.  I cooked the pork exactly as instructed and it was delicious....very moist and tender!!!!!!

I made this for my family on January 1st, 2010 - this is what I did:  I cooked my pork tenderloin in the crock pot, and the apples seperately in a pan. I doubled the recipe and used Fuji apples.  This was AWESOME!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it is a definate make again.

I really liked this recipe and so did everyone else in my family.  My 5yr old gobbled it up and my 4yr old didn't hate it (and that's not easy to accomplish).  I used a sauvignon blanc instead of the riesling(just my preference of wine) and I also doubled the sauce, which was a good idea.  I didn't care much for the flavor the apple cider vinegar gave to the sauce/apples.  Next time I will either use the  sweeter riesling to counter act the strong cider vinegar taste or omit all together.
Also, while the pork was cooking I added just a tad bit of water and covered it (this keeps it tender)  Covered again when I added pork back to sauce and simmered on low for another 10-15 min.  Turned out very flavorful and juicy.

Excellent pork tenderloin dish. Only change I made was to drop the wine (subbing with more stock), and adding a splash of spiced rum, WOW is all I have to say. Hubs raved, that's a feat unto itself.  :)

Made the recipe as written (other than to cut the meat into medallions toward the end) and meh, it was ok. Though I am a big fan of sour foods, cinnamon and especially nutmeg, I didn't care for flavor the vinegar added and it seemed like there were too much spices, I didn't like the way the spices changed the texture of the sauce once it reduced a little. IF I ever decide to make again, I will omit the vinegar and reduce the spices. Also, those saying to slice into medallions? I don't recommend because it's too easy to overcook and toughen the meat. Won't do that again. :(

This was by far the best pork tenderloin recipe I have tried in years and it was excellent.  I didn't change a thing and my husband said it is definitely a keeper, so into My Recipe box it goes. Definitely deserves a 5 star!

This recipe was fantastic. My husband was sceptical but even he said it was awesome. I made it exactly like it is written except i added some sauted sweet onion to the apple sauce and instead of thickening it with cornstarch i just reduced the mixture by cooking it longer and the flavors were really intense and the pork itself was very juicy and tender.  Really very good.

This was absolutely scrumptious!  I only had one apple in the house, so I used it and added 3/4 cup applesauce and used ordinary red cooking wine in place of the reisling.  Even the pickiest eater in my house gave this a big thumbs up!

I  used cut-up chicken which I sauteed,and put in my crock pot.  Then ,  I sauteed mushrooms in the pan that the chicken was in and added that to my crock pot.    Also I cooked chopped rutabaga and added that to the crock pot.  I substituted coconut sugar for the packed brown.  After cooking the wine and other ingredients in the pan that the chicken was in, I added 3 sliced gala apples and stirred it well before adding everything in the pan to the crockpot.  I cooked it for about 5 hrs.   I made this for about 10 people.   

Must have been good, nothing was left!

easy and quick with a small tenderloin - i rarely actually follow a recipe without adding or changing something, but this time i did.  (i might have forgotten the apple cider vinegar, i took it out, but don't remember measuring it out). came out delicious - great sauce with the apples!

This is a very simple recipe and my whole family enjoyed it!  I did not have Riesling wine, so I substituted with a Sauvignon Blanc.  I also cooked the pork while the apples were cooking and it came out delicious!  I served with couscous and steamed zucchini.  Will definitely make this again!

This was really good.  I seared the pork tenderloin on both sides and baked in a roasting pan covered in the oven at 425 for 20 min and let it rest while I prepared the apples and sauce.  For the sauce, I used 1 cup apple cider and 1 cup chicken broth.  Cooked the apples till soft and added the sauce and apples on top of my tenderloin.

Wish there were 10 stars to give it!!  This was so scrumptious!!!  I followed the recipe with only one super slight change, I used 3 apples and didn't peel them.  I live in Washington State and we have awesome apples and wine. I used Honeycrisp apples, and a dry Chateau Ste. Michelle Reisling.

OMG!! It was have heavenly!! Oh yes, I did what someone else mentioned and sliced the tenderloin and put it into the apple mixture for a few minutes before removing from the heat.

Thank you for this recipe, highly recommend and will make again & again!!

Wonderful recipe! I took the advice of some others and doubled the sauce, as well as used half balsamic vinegar along with the apple cider vinegar. I did need to use a bit more cornstarch as the sauce was on the thin side. Also, I used Chardonnay instead of Riesling simply because that was what I had and was opened.  I was able to shave 5 mins. off the pork cooking time by simply putting a lid over the skillet. The most tender pork hubs and I have ever tasted. You can easily cut it with a fork. What a perfect autumn recipe, and definitely company worthy! Next time I think I will try adding some thinly sliced onions along with the apples and letting it all simmer together. P.S. Responding to another recent reviewer.... The 2 T. water is mixed with the cornstarch and added at the end. I found that I needed to use a bit more cornstarch-to-water ratio to get it to thicken up.

My husband and I didn't really care for this dish.  I think the Riesling wasn't a good combination with the apples.  If I made this again, I'd probably use a different wine.

A delicious dish. I would definitely make it again. I don't know why you have to slice the tenderloin in half, however, and it wasn't clear whether in half, meant split (butterflied) or 2 pieces. I think if your pan is large enough, you can omit this step.

This was very good but I would have liked it a little sweeter.  I did slice the Pork Tenderloin and put it in the sauce and then served it.  My Apple Cider Vinegar is a little old and I was wondering if that was the reason it was not sweet enough or the apples could have been sweeter.  I used the Figi apples.

Loved this recipe although I did change a few things. I seasoned the pork and browned on the stove as the recipe stated but I finished cooking it in the slow cooker with some apple cider. I was afraid it would come out dry cooking it according to the recipe. I saved the drippings from the pan to use in the sauce. I didn't want to lose all the bits of flavor from browning the pork. Other than that, the only other change I made was I omitted the vinegar and replaced it with apple cider. My family loved it! Everyone had seconds! I will definitely make this again and again!!!

Excellent!  Lots of flavor and the pork was tender!  Great way to use up some apples and leftover wine.  I used fresh nutmeg, the flavor is very bright!  Other than that I didn't change a thing!  I served with a side of sauteed kale.

Quite good! To prevent the loin from drying out I cooked it with a little wine and rosemary (sherry wine, as I didn't have riesling) and when it got to about 145F I covered in plastic wrap and let it rest in a dish near the oven vent which was on. It was perfectly tender, cooked, and moist. Also, the boyfriend loves applesauce with pork so I knew he'd like this but I went one step further and blended the sauce. Good applesauce to serve with meats.

Overall: This was a great recipe and it will definitely make it into my normal round-up of weeknight meals.    Pros:   Very Tender Meat, Great Flavorful Sauce, Easy  Cons:  Sauce could be thicker, my sauce didn't thicken too much, but did have great flavor.

The sauce was quite tasty but I should have doubled the recipe. The pork was rather bland, I will mix the sauce in sooner next time so the meat absorbs the flavours.

I prepared this recipe for dinner last night and thought it was fantastic. I followed the recipe as written, even setting the timer for suggested cooking times. My kitchen had a terrific aroma. When I prepare it again, I will definitely double the sauce and apples.

This was way good.  I followed it exactly and I was so impressed with the taste.  The pork needed a little more cooking.  I had a thermometer in the tenderloin and it registered 145, but when I cut it, half was a little pink and so microwave did the rest.  It's in my cookbook and will definitely make again!

Instead of using a reisling (which I did not have on hand) I used a medium dry sherry for the wine and the result was delicious.  This is really easy to make and the vinegar makes the sauce a bit sweet and sour so not too cloying.  Would definitely make it again and for guests.

I mixed this recipe with another that roasted the tenderloin in the oven (Apple Balsamic Glazed Pork Tenderloin). I used this recipe for the apples. One work - D. E. L. I. C. I. O. U. S

Very tasty! I made a few changes. I had some fancy Cranberry-Pear balsamic vinegar, so used that. I added 1/2 tsp chicken base (a paste) instead of chicken broth, and didn’t need to put in any more liquid. Out of sheer laziness, I cored & sliced the apples, leaving the skins on.

My family loved this!  Changes I made: doubled the sauce mixture, used apple juice instead  of wine, and after searing in skillet, placed in the crock-pot for 3 hours  on low.  Removed the tenderloin to a plate, added the cornstarch mixture to thicken, then sliced and placed meat back in the sauce to keep warm.  Definitely will make again, but will only cook in crock-pot on low for an hour, after searing.

Very good, will make again for sure, loved the sauce! I browned the tenderloin first then cooked in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes as others here have suggested.

Good recipe. Instead of cutting the tenderloin in half and cooking it entirely on the stovetop, I just seared it on all sides in the pan then threw it onto a baking sheet with some potatoes to roast in the oven @400F for 30 minutes. I made the sauce according to the recipe but took the apple slices out before adding the cornstarch as it would've been difficult to stir.  I plated the apple slices alternating with the pork medallions and topped with the thickened sauce.

Took the advice of others and cut the tenderloin into medallions and returned to sauce.  Recipe was ok but felt it lacked flavor.

Only thing I did different was add carmelized onions as suggested by someone else.  And doubled the sauce.  My family loved it.

This was a great recipe after I finished making some apple jelly. I found it too sweet (I usually never find things too sweet!) so next time I'll reduce the amount of jelly.

Did it according to recipe on website. Very disappointed that  the recipe in the  "Kitchen-view" mode is different. Second All Recipes  recipe that I've used recently where that is the case.  Should be a pretty easy software coding fix.

Just tried this tonight.  It was "ok".  Would need to tweak quite a bit to try again.  Needed to cook pork longer than recipe called for and sauce was too thin. Needed to add more corn starch.  Apples were great and overall dish was good but don't know what went wrong.  followed exact recipe with 2 small pork tenderloins.

It was great and the apple sauce pears very well with desserts especially ice cream, add cinnamon to your sauce and it would be great and also I never knew what to do with the 2 Tbs. water.

The pork was cooked right - it was really moist and just pink at the center.  The sauce was blah and not nearly thick enough.  I love pork with apples - this just wasn't it.  Bland.

I tried this recipe tonight and was very impressed. The flavours were delicious and the tenderloin just right.  I didn't change anything as I like to follow a recipe as is for the first time, then alter if I need to.

Delicious! Because I can never seem to make a recipe as written some alterations were made: am not a fan of nutmeg so used allspice, didn't have Riesling so used Chardonnay. On advice from other reviewers I increased apples to 3, added 1/4 c more wine & broth, reduced vinegar a little and added a little extra cinnamon. Once the apples were mostly cooked and sauce thickened I added 2 packets Splenda to offset the vinegar. I did slice the meat into medallions, put in a baking dish and poured the apples over the meat. Covered with foil and put in the oven at 275 degrees for 45 mins. Didn't intend for it to bake that long but delays happen! The meat was very tender. We all loved it!
(I wouldn't omit the vinegar because it adds depth. Next time will try balsamic.)

I'm eating this as I type.  Very nice.  I've been looking for different recipes for pork tenderloin and had a bag of apples, so this fit the bill.  Easy to prepare, great sauce.  Washing it down with a home brew and sopping the juices with fresh baked bread.

This was an okay recipe. I had to change a few things (that might be the reason it wasn't as good as I hoped). I had only pork chops on hand and no wine. I also tried to double the sauce, but it came out not as thick. I did enjoy the sauce though. I'm not a big fan of cinnamon apples, but the nutmeg and vinegar helped to cut that flavour. If I had a tenderloin, I might give this another try.

Outstanding! It first I thought the Apple cider vinegar was going to be weird but it turned out really good. I made it with boneless pork chops and added the chops to the apple mixture at the end and simmered together for about 5 minutes. Great recipe

This was awesome!  I didn't want that much spice or sweet, so I just put "some" brown sugar and nutmeg, to taste.  It went so well with the pork.  I used flour instead of cornstarch and it worked just fine. Definitely going to make this again!

I changed a few things, I didn't have any wine so after browning and cooking the pork, I deglazed the pan with the chicken stock, then added the rest the ingredients.  Didn't have any cornstarch so I added a bit more brown sugar and let it reduce.  Cut up the pork and mixed it in the pan w/ the apples and sauce..  Yum!
One thing, the time it said to cook the pork was too long, after browning for 5 mins/side, reduce heat and cook an additional 10 mins (not 20) turning once.  Once you tent it under foil it will continue to cook anyway
