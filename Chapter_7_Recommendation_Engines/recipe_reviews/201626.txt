The lime completely overpowered all the other flavors--it was like drinking hot lime juice. We tried to cut the lime flavor with a little bit of sugar, but that didn't work at all. I am pretty dissapointed--we both love lime and were exicted about trying this recipe. Maybe cut the lime to a tablespoon or so and leave out the lime halves while cooking? It] might work, but I am sorry to say that we don't think this is worth trying again, even with some modifications.

I LOVED this!! Definitely a nice change from the usual. I did cut WAY down on the oil though - used more like 2 tbsp instead of a half cup, and because I'm a garlic head I added 3 cloves minced garlic to the original saute. It really worked well over fish and rice too!

I only used the juice of one lime and did not add the lime halves to the pan fearing it would over power the sauce and I was right. All that oil isn't necessary either. This is an awesome pasta sauce served over zoodles (zucchini noodles) for a healthy meal. This will go into my TNT folder.
