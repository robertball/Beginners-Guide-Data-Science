Here is the EASIEST tip for filling the cupcakes.  Take an APPLE CORER and use that to pull a cylindrical plug of cake out of each cupcake (once they've cooled).  Save the plugs on the side while you pipe filling into each hole you've created.  "Plug" up each hole using the plugs/caps you had removed with the apple corer.  Simple and fast!

I thought this was a great idea, but not the greatest recipe.  The chocolate cupcakes weren't the tastiest -- I'd use a different recipe for that part next time.  The cream filling was great, so I wound up using a double batch of filling for one batch of cupcakes.  I didn't like the idea of pushing it in from the bottom (sounded way too messy for me).  So I used a knife and cut a cone shape out of the top, spooned the filling in, and replaced the top.  (Just be sure to wait until the cupcakes have cooled, or the cream filling just melts!)  Then I frosted them using the great chocolate frosting recipe mentioned in another review, and you can't tell they're anything but chocolate cupcakes until you bite into them.  My boyfriend says these are now his FAVORITE dessert!

Great dessert for our Father's Day barbeque!  The cupcake portion of the recipe is so easy to make and tastes so much better than boxed mixes.  It doesn't take any longer to make than the boxed mixes either, so try it.  As for the reviewers that thought it was too much work to put the filling inside, it's actually very little work and quite a bit of fun.  All you need is a pastry bag and tip.  Each cupcake takes about 10 seconds to fill.  I made my cupcakes in the pan without wrappers, filled them after they were cool, then arranged a dozen or so to a platter and drizzled them with chocolate ganache.  They looked surprisingly elegant for cupcakes.  Everyone loved them and ate seconds and thirds.  I can't wait to try the same cupcake recipe with different fillings.  UPDATE:  I have made these cupcakes dozens of times since my first review because they are always requested.  I like to ice them with Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  I have also filled them with chocolate cream cheese frosting, nutella, and whipped peanut butter frosting.  I like to fill them from the top and then spoon the glaze on.  After the glaze is set, I pipe a small flower in the center of each cupcake with whatever filling I used.

This is a super recipe!  I usually always mess up new recipes, but this turned out perfect, it was easy, and everyone at work loved it.  I used an incredible chocolate frosting receipe I found on this same site:  1/4 cup margarine, melted; 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder; 1/3 cup milk; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar.  In a large bowl, beat margarine and cocoa together until combined. Add milk and vanilla; beat until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until desired consistency is achieved. Adjust with more milk or confectioners' sugar if necessary.

Five stars for a great filling! I needed a cocoa filling to fill cupcakes for my son's birthday so I just changed 2 ingredients in this cream filling recipe and it turned out great!  I used all butter (didn't have shortening) and I replaced 1/4 cup of the confectioner's sugar with unsweetened cocoa powder.  I also filled my cupcakes from the top since I was going to frost them.  By the way, I used a triple chocolate fudge cake mix for the cupcake and a vanilla buttercream for the frosting (my son's favorite).  The cream filling recipe with the changes I made generously filled 24 cupcakes.  Everyone loved the finished cupcakes - kids and adults!

These are so delicious and they turned out wonderful! I left out the shortening in the filling and they still tasted magnificent! I think these are the best cupcakes I have ever made and I will definately make them again. It took some time for me to fill all of the cupcakes, but it was worth it because they taste great. They remind me of Hostess cupcakes, only better. They are probably good with chocolate chips in the batter as well...maybe I'll try it!

This recipe was OK. Here's what I did to simplify it-
 cupcake dough=Pilsbury cake mix(choc.)
 filling=Betty C. whip-cream frosting
 Frosting= Betty C. choc. frosting
THIS MAKES IT SOOOOOOO EASY!!!!!!!!!

Loved this recipe.  Had been looking for a filled cupcake recipe for a long time and now I have a winner!  The cupcake turned out perfect.  Used the frosting suggested by OCEAN011 and decorated with leftover filling.  UPDATE:  Have made these several times since I first reviewed them and experimented with different fillings, just made the filling by adding a Tbsp or 2 of cheesecake pudding mix (dry) to the original recipe and whipping it...OMG...that is good...really thinned it out so had to add more powdered sugar.  Also I have been just piping the filling into the top of the cupcake with a piping bag and small tip...that way you can leave the liner on and the hole at the top is covered with frosting.

Just to be clear, I'm not reviewing the cake part of the recipe, just the filling and the idea of a technique for applying it inside. The cake you use doesn't matter. The filling and technique will work with any cupcake recipe. The filling is light and sweet. Instead of milk, I used coffee creamer and the texture and flavor were just perfect. As for putting the filling into the cupcakes, I went from the top instead of breaking the bottom paper, (which makes for an unholy mess on your serving plate.) I was going to frost them anyway, so it didn't matter that a dot of white filling showed through the top. I used a pastry bag with a #22 tube. Buried the tube all the way to the coupler into the cupcake. I squeezed until the cake started to expand, then eased off the pressure as I withdrew it. Worked very well, and it's infinitely easier and faster than cutting the core, removing it, filling and replacing the core. No need for any such gyrations. If you have cake decorating equipment, I recommend this time-saving technique.

Oh. Wow. These are absolutely great. The kids love 'em. Their classmates love 'em. The husband loves 'em. The dentist even loves 'em. Easy to make, foolproof, a hit. I usually only want the filling in this type of dessert but the cake is chocolatey and delicious. We enjoyed every crumb.

This recipe was pretty good, not great.  I doubled the recipe to make 72 cupcakes, but the recipe only yielded 48 cupcakes.  Also, make sure to fill the holders at least 2/3 full, not 1/2 like the recipe says. In order to fill the cupcakes with the filling well, I removed some of the cake part.

Great concept!  I make a version of these 4 every gathering we attend & they are always gone first.  Who wants a hostess cupcake when you can have a confection that tastes like it just came from a Confectionery in Paris?
If you want a REALLY chocolaty cupcake, simply buy a dark chocolate fudge cake mix (yes, you can use a mix, the food police will not arrest you! simple & good) and make according 2 the package EXCEPT replace the water w/ strong coffee.  Trust me, you won't taste coffee (which I hate & refuse 2 drink) but you will taste deep, dark chocolate- sigh-.  *****  THEN, which sounds easier: cutting a hole in every cake and filling, then replacing the top, or simply filling the pastry bag and piping it in?  Who wants 2 waste all that delicious cake?!  Just pipe starting w/ the tip close 2 the middle, not the bottom. ***THEN, forget a shortening based filling.  If you want over-the-top gourmet  flavor that make people beg for more, make a vanilla bean Italian Meringue Butter Cream frosting.  Google it, & don't use any recipe that calls for shortening- yuck.  TRUE IMBC frosting has no shortening.  Pipe those cakes half full of THAT, then make a chocolate ganache & while liquid & warm, fill a wilt*n squeeze bottle (used for making chocolates) & squeeze ganache all over the tops of the cupcakes.  So easy to do!  Oh and do yourself a really big favor- stop using regular vanilla and start using S*noma Syrup's Vanilla Bean Crush- it will take your desserts to new heights!  :)

I forgot the baking soda, so I am only going to review the cream filling. It tasted more like icing then cream filling to me. But it was good for an icing.

Holy cow, these are delish, grandkids were all over them.  No frosting, all butter in filling, filled from top so a little "button" sticks out.  These would please even a snotty French pastry chef.  I know...I am one!  :)

I had to change my original review of these cupcakes.  At first, I thought they were way too sweet when I tasted them right after making them, and I was worried that my guests wouldn't like them either.  That night I left a so-so review on here.  HOWEVER...when I tasted them the next day they were delicious! The cream didn't taste as sweet.  It's almost like the flavors had to settle in or something.   It's amazing how sitting overnight helped it.  So of course I felt bad about the initial review and had to come back and change it to excellent.  All of my guests loved these!  They will definitely be made again.   A word of advice about the batter...make sure you fill the cups almost full, as the batter didn't rise very high like cake mixes do  (I did follow the recipe perfectly).  If you want nice, plump, rounded tops, then fill the cups almost full.

Contrary to other reviews, I loved the cake part of this recipe.  It was moist and traditional tasting and held the filling (which is to die for) very well.  I used the chocolate frosting recipe another cook posted for the tops: 1/4 cup butter, melted; 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder; 1/3 cup milk; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar.  Then decorated with the white filling.  If you're like me, you'll want a little extra of that, so I recommend adding a half (less than doubling) to that portion of the recipe.

Very good! Used a Wilton "Bismarck" tip to fill the cupcakes, which made it easy-peasy. Whipped up a batch of Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site (cut corn syrup down to 2 teaspoons so it wasn't too runny) and put that on the cupcakes once they were cooled. Used the remaining filling to decorate the tops once the glaze had hardened. Very easy, cute, and tasty.

I made a version of these cupcakes the other day, and they were AMAZING!!  My kids loved them!  I only used the filling from this recipe (YUM)and Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate cake.  It worked beautifully - it's moist & fudgy.... Then I slathered Satiny Chocolate Glaze (recipe from this site) all over the tops and decorated with squiggles made from the leftover filling. DEEEE-LISH!!!!

These were awesome! I cut the recipe in half cause I did not want too many cupcakes and it worked out perfectly. The cakes baked up nicely, remained very soft and moist the day after as well and the filling is so delicious! I followed other reviewers advice and piped the filling from the top and then I frosted some with Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting (found on this site) and left some plain. The ones with the frosting seemed to be much more preferred and I will definitely make these again! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These cupcakes were AMAZING! I made exactly as written. I filled my decorating tube with the filling mixture & used the longest thinnest attachment - I then pushed it in the too of the cupcake slightly denting in the top- squeezed for a few seconds and squeezed while slowly pulling out  stopping just before it reached the surface of the cupcake. I frosted the top and they turned out looking so professional like Hostess made them on an assembly line! And did they taste wonderful! Thank U!

These are the best cupcakes I've ever made.  I've made them for lots of parties, and they get gobbled up by the ADULTS before the kids even get a chance to eat them.  While making each stage of the recipe, I was not impressed.  The cupcake batter was okay, the filling was average.  But HOLY COW when it is all put together, it is the most perfect cupcake ever.  The chocolate cake is moist and not overbearingly chocolate, the filling is just perfect.  And this frosting recipe (see below) is the perfect complement.  If you haven't tried this recipe, you will be pleasantly surprised.  I used another reviewer's frosting recipe of 1/4 cup butter, melted; 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder; 1/3 cup milk; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; 3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar.  I found it is best to keep these refrigerated until you serve them.  There will be NO leftovers!    when you put them all together, this is a taste explosion.

I LOVE how these turned out!  The reviews made me a little leary of using this recipe for chocolate cake so I used my old stand-by: "One bowl chocolate cake III."  I got a little more than 2 dozen cupcakes out of it.  I used a paring knife to carve out a little circle from the top of the cupcake, then used a piping bag to squeeze the filling inside, then popped the top of the cupcake back on.  I used "Satiny chocolate glaze" for a ganache-like icing, then used the piping bag to pipe circles over the top.  I haven't had a hostess cupcake since I was a kid but these were adorable and tasted even better than I remembered!!

I only followed the cream recipe and used boxed cake mix.  This was the first time I ever filled cupcakes.  I thought the cream tasted delicious inside and outside of the cupcake.  It was just the right amount of texture and sweetness.  I filled the cupcake from the top and not the bottom because that just made more sense to me.  It was hard for me to judge how much cream was filling up inside but I just tried to fill every one the same and one batch filled 18 cupcakes.  I would definately make this again.

Use the Satiny Chocolate glaze (on this website) on top....it's perfect for these!! Like chocolate genache (sp?) but way easier!

I skipped the cake recipe all together and used the recipe for black magic cake and then used the filling! I have to say that the two combined are amazing!!! I also made a dark chocolate ganache on top but to be honest, it didnt really need it.... amazing! I think if the recipe for were black magic cake and the filling, it would be a 6 star rating!! Thank you!

Okay, these are pretty amazing!  I made them according to the recipe, except for adding a little more cocoa to the cupcake batter and baking them at 360 degrees instead of 375.  They made a few more than 24 cupcakes (I filled them about 2/3rd's full).  I used all butter, instead of half butter and half shortening in the filling.  I also found I needed to make another half-recipe of it in order to fill all 24 cupcakes, so you might want to make more to begin with.  Also, I waited until they were completely cool before I filled them.  I used a Wilton tip 230 (the Bismark tip) and filled them just until I could see the cupcake start to "swell" a bit.  I used the cake recipe as is instead of substituting a box mix because I wanted to try the recipe as given (except for the substitutions mentioned).  I'm really glad I did.  The flavors complimented each other beautifully.  I did use the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe provided elsewhere on this site and totally recommend it.  I used Ghiradelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate and it turned out great...chocolate-y, but not too sweet.  Perfect combination of flavors.  A definite repeat!!

I'm only rating the cream filling recipe as I used a boxed cake mix for the cupcakes. The filling was super easy to make and use. Alone it's quite sweet but once I filled the cupcakes and let them sit, it blended so nicely. For the chocolate topping I used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site. What a great pairing! I've shared these cupcakes with 2 people already and both have said that these are far better than the original hostess chocolate cupcakes. Sounds like a keeper then!

I am actually only reviewing the cream filling. I made a boxed Devils Food cake, put the cream filling in through the top & frosted with Satiny Choc. Glaze from this site. Sooooo good. Taste just like Hostess cupcakes & easy to frost with the glaze. Just dip the tops!! Only change will be to use a larger tip when filling with cream.

who can resist cupcakes filled with icing? not me. This is a great recipe, just make sure you pipe in enough icing, I was a bit scared of the process, so mine were skimpy...Don't make the same mistake.

I only made the cream filling from this recipe, but it is 5 stars all the way!  It is the best cream filling I have found for cupcakes.  I have found it is better to inject the filling from the top of the cupcake as I use paper liners for my cupcakes.  The frosting will cover up the injection hole.  I used a pastry bag fitted with a frosting tip, insert directly into the top of the cupcake and squeeze gently to fill, and stop when you see the cupcake "expand".

These was a real hit at my husband's office, where I took them for his birthday celebration. I piped it from the top, as suggested by other reviewers, and frosted with a simple cocoa, powdered sugar, butter & milk frosting. The cake was good by itself, but the cream filling is what makes it exceptional. This is a BIG winner in my book!

Awesome! I made these for a 4th of July picnic, and they were gone in ten minutes. The tray didn't even make it to the buffet table before four of them were gone! I used a devils food cake mix for speed, and iced with the Condensed Milk Chocolate Frosting from this site. The were messy & sticky, but obviously delicious. I can't speak from experience, because I didn't get one! I also had a little filling left, and used it to make the squiggly decoration on top, to look like the famous store bought cupcakes. I might try with a dfferent icing next time, to be less messy. But everyone was impressed. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These cupcakes were delicious! To put the filling in the cupcake I took an apple corer and took out the middle of the cupcake. I then put the top part of the cupcake that I took out back on the top in the hole. I used the chocolate icing that another commenter had posted, which was delicious! Thanks for the awesome recipe :)

Great recipe! ..and easy. I hate when people make all kinds of changes, but I HAD to make one. Any time I make filled cup cakes, I always fill right from the top and then frost over the hole. It's definitely more appealing visually, and that way there is no risk of filling coming out the bottom/sides of your cups. Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Very good but VERY sweet!  I may have used too much as I ran out after about 14 or so cupcakes.   Delicous flavor.  Next time might try pudding though as it won't be quite as sweet

I am reviewing the cake only, as I did not fill my cupcakes. I wanted a cake recipe and chose this one over others in AR because it contained eggs. In short, I'll never make boxed cupcakes again. This was just as easy, after all you have to mix other ingredients into the box varieties so this was almost exactly the same, IMHO. But they tasted so much better. Real cake, real chocolate flavor. Real ingredients. One note, they really rose so next time I'll fill my cups just a little over half full.

I only made a half batch which should have yielded 18, but I only got 12 cupcakes and I didn't over fill them, a couple domed a little, but I like my cupcakes that way.  The batter was very liquidy, so I was a bit nervous, but they baked up very nice.  The filling was the perfect amount for the 12 cupcakes I got out of a half batch.  I did not fill them from the bottom, I filled from the top with my decorator tip used for filling cupcakes.  Turned out great.  I also used the Chocolate Frosting I recipe from this site to top them off.  I think I'll be making these for my cousin's rehearsal dinner.

These were terrific. As I was making the recipe, it was very similar to a family recipe that my Aunt gave me. Instead of just putting in 1cup of water, I put in 1cup of strong black coffee (cooled). The flavor is great and I think they are going to be wonderful. Thanks for sharing! I don't have a piping bag, so I used a zip-lock and cut off the corner. Also, I used a small knife to cut the circle and then used the vegetable peeler to scoop out the circle. It worked great.

We all loved these; they were so fun to make and looked like they were difficult!  I glazed them with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" and that was the perfect topper.  Then I used leftover filling to pipe a squiggly line on top.  I used all butter in the filling.  I got 30 cupcakes out of this recipe.

My seven year old daughter made this all by herself and won a blue ribbon at the Monterey County Fair for her age group. I must admit a 7 year old weilding a pastry bag was a little messy but these cupcakes were delish.  They don't even need icing, we just piped a little dab of extra cream filling onto the top of each cupcake.

These came out great. EASY cake recipe and the icing did indeed work better piped in from the top.  I glazed the top of the cupcakes with a dark chocolate ganache and piped on the little white squiggles like the store brand has (for fun). The kids loved em!

I made this recipe the first time and I liked it... but it needed more of a chocolatey flavor. So, when I decided to make it a second time I used 3/4C of Dark Chocolate cocoa powder and also added about 1/4 - 1/2 C of melted semi sweet chocolate chips and it was a lot better! I would recommend this recipe with the alterations anytime!

I can only rate the cream filling.  I used 1/2 c butter instead of butter and shortening. Added 2 tsp vanilla.   I only had heavy cream that I whipped by itself, then folded it into the creamed butter and conf. sugar until the cream had the consistency I liked I cut a plug out of  top of each cupcake.  (1" x 1/2 " roughly)  filled a sealable plastic bag with the cream and cut a corner off of it crammed as much of the filling that would fit in each cupcake Trimmed the bottom of the plug and put it back in and then frosted the cupcake.  People said this was better that a Hostess cupcake.  The only thing missing was the white design on top.  It was incredibly tasty!

I have to confess I didn't make the cupcake part - just the filling (which, by the way, was exactly what I wanted).  Fantastic !  Made 1/2 recipe which was enough to fill 12 cupcakes.

Cream was delicious and easy but the chocolate didn't come out so moist.

I made these and I didn't care for the way they tasted. Not that they aren't good, but i was a little disappointed.

Nice, moist cupcake- and very easy to make.  I made these with my 3 year old grandson (he had a blast filling them).  I halved the recipe for 18 cupcakes, but kept the amounts the same for the filling.  After filling the cupcakes, I added some cocoa powder to the remaining filling and used it to frost the cupcakes.  Very good, thanks for the recipe.

These are fantastic.  Although you might be tempted to use a different filing recipe, I would stick with the one provided.  It suits the cupcakes perfectly.

Used this filling recipe for my red velvet cupcakes and it was great.  Filled a zip lock sandwich bag, cut off the corner tip and it made for a perfect pastry bag.  Thanks for sharing Grace.

I've made alot of cupcakes, but I wasn't pleased with the results of this one at all. I made it just as written...wanted to try that first. Not much flavor at all to the cupcake itself..and the filling was just ok. Should've stuck with the traditional Hershey's chocolate cake recipe. Sorry.

The cake part of this recipe is okay, but did not come out as dark as I would hope. Perhaps I would use a box or a different recipe next time. It looked more like a gingerbread color. Flavor was ok. The filling was great. I used an apple corer and plugged up the holes when I was done. You should test how much to fill with one cake, because I under filled on some. I used a hard glaze recipe I found on this site, and used the filling to make the swirls on top. I would do this again, but with different cake.

The cream in this recipe is really good. I was actually told I was too cheap with the cream, I think its b/c I kept "tasting" it...guess I "tested" it too much in the process =) oops.

These were very easy to make. I didn't think the chocolate cake was very chocolately and the filling was a little greasy tasting. I frosted them with the chocolate satin frosting from this site. That was what really put them to a 5. They were delicious. We enjoyed them cold from the fridge. It was hard to determine how much filling to put in. I over-filled half and under-filled the other half. I guess it just takes practice. I would expect to waste a few experimenting with the filling, fill, cut in half and see how much went it.

Yummy! Aside from using half-n-half and milk instead of water and milk, I followed the cake recipe and enjoyed it. I had leftover homemade whipped cream to use for the middles (which is why I chose this recipe, to use it up), since it was basically the same thing I thought we'd be good...and yes! Indeed. I was chatting with a friend while filling these so I wasn't paying attn to how much cream went in... wish I would've gotten the filling farther into the cupcakes, as I filled mine from the top (who wants a whole in the bottom). Then dipped the tops in chocolate ganache, which hid the holes perfectly. They were a hit!

I didn't think the extra effort put forth to make these cupcakes from scratch made any difference in the way they tasted. I would use a boxed mix next time. The creamy center reminded me of the frosting that the grocery store bakery puts on their decorated cakes - you know the one made mostly of shortening. But everyone seemed to like the filling and they ate them all up, so apparently I was the only one not too crazy about them! I filled them from the top after using a paring knife to "core" them. The top frosting covered it great.

This was a great recipe! I cut the recipe in half, so I was able to get 13 cupcakes. I added a little bit more cocoa powder. I frosted by whipping up some ganache and double dipped them for a smooth hostess like finish. TIP: you can use an apple corer to hollow out the middle of the cupcake.

Note: I'm only rating the filling, as I used a different recipe for the cupcake.  I found the filling to be waaayyy too sweet. It's basically just icing piped into the cupcake. I had expected something a little lighter and creamier in flavor with a whipped texture. The sweetness is just completely overwhelming.

I made these for Halloween. I colored the cream filling orange, used chocolate butter cream frosting on the top and decorated them with candy corn. They looked very nice and the cake was moist and delicious. We all loved them.
 I am going to make them for Christmas and try ground peppermint candy in the filling and sprinkled on the top.

Followed recipe exactly except I filled the cupcakes from the top and then frosted with Hard Chocolate Glaze from AR.  Unlike some of the other reviewers who didn't like the cupcake part of this recipe, I thought the cake was delicious - very moist and chocolatey, thanks to my using a decent quality cocoa.  The filling is good - although more of a "butter"cream than cream (I think part of me was expecting a whipped cream type of filling - this is basically whipped frosting), and I filled the cupcakes from the top as I knew I wanted  to glaze them.  I've never filled cupcakes like this before, so wasn't sure how much filling was getting in - but I found that if the cupcake "puffed" up a bit, and when I removed the piping tube a bit of filling would squeeze out of the cupcake, it was filled with the right amount.  Just brushed off the excess with a knife before icing and they came out great!

HOLY MOLY,these are good, i cant believe i waited so long to do this recipe.  The filling inside is delicous, but make sure you dont do it in a warm kitchen because the filling will get a little runny.  I dusted the tops with powdered sugar to cover the little whole I made with my piping bag.  They were soo gooood

These were so yummy and easy to make.  I did fill them from the top as well.  I also added some chocolate chips for extra chocolate and made sure I didn't over bake.  They had enough flavor and were very moist.  I will continue making these - no more boxed mixes!

These cupcakes came out awesome.  I made these and brought them into the office.  I also squeezed the filling into the top of the cupcake.  It seemed like it made more sense to do it that way.  Other than that, I did everything the way the recipe called for.  The cupcake itself  wasn't overly sweet, which a lot of people like and you don't really need it any sweeter than it was because there is filling in the middle.  I wouldn't use a box cake mix for this.  Stick to the recipe itself.

Great cupcakes.  The only thing I would do different next time is figure out how to get more filling inside.  I also filled them from the top and covered the filling hole with chocolate frosting. I loved how tall and round the cupcakes themselves baked up.  We really enjoyed this recipe.

Everyone liked these at the party -- they were convinced I BOUGHT them.  I used box mix for the cupcakes themselves and the frosting suggested by OCEAN011.  I piped the filling in from the top, too, and that worked really well.  To make them look "fancy" I piped the frosting on the top in a circular pattern.  I thought they were a bit messy to eat, but the kids really liked them.

I made these cupcakes dairy and egg free.  They came out so delicous that I'll be making these cupcakes everytime my children have a party.  Everyone could not believe they were made with out dairy or eggs.  The frosting I used was chocolate cream frosting (using dairy free   margarine).  YUMMY!!!!

I also tried this recipe as a sheet cake and filled them.  I am going to take the advise and fill them from the top.

Made this for my son's 10th birthday.  These are amazing!  I made them exactly as the recipe states and they turned out wonderfully!  I used a chocolate glaze recipe from this site for the frosting and they taste a lot like Hostess cupcakes.  I read a lot of the reviews beforehand about the cake not being the best, but I found it to be very tasty.

I followed the suggestion of a previous review, and used an apple corer to remove a plug from the top of my cupcakes; not only did this work perfectly, instead of making frosting for the top, I had a little star of filling peep out the top to finish them. The kids ate the plugs! 
I've given this recipe 4 stars, simply because it isn't as chocolatey or rich in texture as I'd expected. It's very good, don't get me wrong, I would just increase the cocoa from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup or more next time I make them. Normally I make a vegan chocolate cupcake recipe that uses avocado, and I find it has a more dense, chocolatey texture and flavour than these.

Please note that my rating and review is for the "cream filling" only. I used it to pipe into my own chocolate cupcakes, and it was divine. Smooth, creamy, and not overly sweet.

I agree with others that the cake is not very tasty--I wouldn't use the cake portion of the recipe again.  Didn't have any problem filling with cupcakes with a Bismarck decorating tip.  Followed others' advice and filled from the top.  Like the idea overall.

These make wonderful cupcakes! They are my favorite!!! However, with the filling, I had to stir it about every 5-10 minutes, so the oil didnt go to the bottom. But, they are the best I have ever had!!!

Easy to make and delicious to eat. I recommend adding a few extra tbls of cocoa powder to the cupcake batter. Also double the filling and use half to fill cupcakes and mix in cocoa powder with the other 1/2 to frost the tops. You may need to add a bit of extra vanilla and milk after adding cocoa powder to the frosting.

The cupcake part of this recipe is easy and delicious. I have used it even when I need a basic chocolate cupcake without the cream filling. The cream filling is good as well, but I find it's too thick to fill the cupcakes as directed so I cut a section out of the center and fill that way. A chocolate glaze (I like 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' from this site) is the best way to top them, as they always seem to disappear fast that way. If frosted, they are almost too sweet and aren't as popular. Great recipe and one I keep going back to. Thanks!

The chocolate cupcakes were perfect, but the filling did not go into the cupcake properly. I ended up just putting it on top. I will try again and do what another reviewer said and just apple core a hole, fill the space with cream then put the top back on.

Fantastic recipe.  The cupcakes turned out just right.  They had a consistency very similar to Hostess cupcakes, but with no nasty chemical aftertaste!  Everyone loved them.

These were DELICIOUS!!! I used soy milk to keep it non-dairy. I used 1/2 C margarine instead of the butter/shortening, and I used OCEAN011's frosting recipe, which I will definitely be using again even for other recipes. (I only used 3 cups, not 3, 1/2 of the confectioners sugar, and I ended up adding a bit more soy milk too). AWESOME recipe! Thanks Grace W.!

Kids loved these, but I felt that they needed a little more chocolate flavor, so I would up the cocoa next time.  I filled these from the top (I couldn't get the tip through the paper liner) and then covered with satiny chocolate glaze.  Then I finished them by piping more of the filling on the top.  These went over great at the party that my kids took them to.

These are amazing.  I have made them a few times already and they turn out great each time.  I just use a cake decorating bag and the filling tip and pipe the icing in with that and it works great.

Cake had good flavor and constistancy, nice rise in the oven. I must have filled them less than half, as I had 48 cupcakes, which was fine.  The filling was ok. Used a spritz maker to fill the cakes, but was not satisified with the end product. Don't think I'll do the filling again, but definitely will do the cake again

The filling is spot-on!  I will use the recipe for that again.  I'm not entirely crazy about the cupcake though my family did like them.  The flavor wasn't chocolate enough to my taste I guess.  These are good, not "knock your socks off" excellent.  Thank you for sharing.

These were OK. I think you need a really good but not too sweet icing to top them off. I will try again though by experimenting.

I love this recipe. I just made it with whole wheat flour and splenda. Also didn't use oil I used shortening. Also added a little more water to thin it cause it was thick. They came out great. The filling I used a sugar free pudding. I will use this one from now on. Thanks

Great recipe, except for tearing up the bottom of cupcake to fill with cream. Yes, I used my apple corer to remove the center so I could fill with cream then replace plug on top. I also used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe from this site to ice them. I fav cupcake recipe for sure.

I didnt like the chocolate cupcake. I've made filled cupcakes before but not this way. I prefer to take a paring knife and cut a cone shaped core into the cupcake. Take the cone that was cut out, Cut off the pointy end so its a flat disk. Fill the crater in the cupcake with whatever you want. Put the flat disk on top of the cupcake and then ice it.. it allows for a lot more filling in the cupcake.

These are my new favorite cupcake, like many others I filled them from the top. I frosted them with a chocolate frosting and used the left over filling to do a white design on the top. They look great and more importantly they taste good. Thanks for the recipe:-)

How can someone rate a recipe if they've not followed it at all?!?!  Using a boxed cake mix and packaged icing for the filling and frosting - how is that accurately making the recipe at all???  This recipe; as written; is devine.  Wonderful; wonderful cream filling; works great as acing itself; even; or for using for filling pretty much any sort of cake/doughnut; etc. etc; very veratile recipe.  The cupcake itself is a moist; rich; chocolate cake - someone compared them to hostess cakes - I'm initially from the USA; and while we don't have hostess cakes here; it is exactly as I remember them; only the filling is a bit better.  The cupcakes are nearly foolproof; the filling is easy as; and trully; though it takes a bit of time to fill them; there are ways of making it easier; and trust me; it is well worth making this recipe.  I piped the filling through the top and then iced the tops - covering the hole filling the cakes left.  And you can use whatver icing you want!!  Wonderful overall; well loved by family and neighbors; definitely a keeper!

The cream filling in this is to die for. I doubled it after reading some reviews but I had a ton left over. Of course, I used a mechanical pastry bag to fill the cupcakes and not as much filling went in as I had hoped, as I later found out, so doubling the filling is probably a good idea. Next time I'll definitely try to get more in. I also used the frosting recipe that another reviewer posted, and used left over cream filling to make the squiggly line. I really enjoyed the actual cake part of it as well, so I'm not sure why other reviewers didn't like it so much. I would definitely use the cream filling for other cupcakes as well. Very very yummy!

This recipe is outstanding!  I adjusted the recipe to make 12 instead of 36 cupcakes.  I used milk chocolate frosting, so yummy!  I also used a vegetable peeler to cut a tiny plug out of the top to fill with the cream.  It was much easier than going through the bottom.

WOW. These might be the best cupcakes I have had! They cupcakes are mosit and very chocolatly. I only have a couple suggestions. For the cupcakes, they stick to the muffin cups after they are done baking. I sprayed them lightly with pam before placing in the batter. For the icing, instead of using a pastry bag, i would suggest using a knife, or an apple corer to take out the middle of the cupcake. Then using your hands, you can make the whole bigger by making the cupcake more compact. Then using a small knife, or the end of a spoon, fill in the cupcake with the filling. Place the cupcake you took out back on top of the cupcake. Then frost the cupcakes as you normally would being careful of the loose cupcake. I would also suggest using only a small amount of icing. These cupcakes are VERY sweet. My boyfriend absolutly LOVES these, and always asks me to make them! Thanks for the recipe!

these taste great but take some time to put together.  i used a different chocolate cake recipe (one from the hershey's website) which makes fudgey cupcakes.  once baked and cooled i ended up scooping out some of the cake in the center and adding the cream.  i then covered the cream center with chocolate frosting. YUM!

A few people have said that these are average taste wise, but I think with the sweet filling and icing (if you choose to ice them), it is better to have a basic chocolate cupcake rather than an overly sweet one. Personally, I would prefer a slightly less sweet filling, maybe a cream filling similar to cream puffs or eclairs instead, but I made them this way because I didn't have the makings for anything else.  I iced with creamy chocolate frosting from this website and all together, they are great! As for filling, I definitely found that cutting a cone out of the top and scraping some of the insides out made for the best filling to cupcake ratio.  When I piped in from the top, my bag burst on me, and they weren't very full this way anyway. Cutting the tops takes slightly more time, but it's worth the effort!

Fantastic!  I made a couple of changes though I suppose it would still be great without the changes.  I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa for the cupcakes and added about 2 tbsp of cheesecake pudding (dry mix) to the cream filling as NEgirl did.  I also used a pastry bag and a #7 tip to pipe the cream filling in from the top, very easy.  For the icing I used the Chocolate Ganache Icing from this site and used Frangelico in the icing instead of Brandy.  These are the  best cupcakes!

These were good, but not great.  I didn't think the cake part was the best.  I may just try a box mix next time and use the cream filling in that.

This filling was great.  I wasn't sure how long to beat it for until it got light and fluffy enough, but 3-4 minutes seemed to be enough.  I did use another cake recipe from this site (boxed chocolate cake mix with pudding mix, etc.) I thought at first the filling would be too sweet, but mixed into the cupcakes, it was perfect.  I also filled from the top - I liked the little dot of filling that showed up on top of the cupcake so you know it was filled with something.  Thanks for the recipe!

I, too, used devil's food cake instead of making it from scratch.  But if you do this, you will have leftover filling because this recipe makes 36 cupcakes and the cake mix makes 24.  But I filled the cupcakes from the top and used the leftover filling and a flower tip to cover up the holes on the tops!  They turned out very good and disappeared quickly!

Wow, there are delicious. The cupcakes dont really have a chocolate kick to them, but they are still very good and moist. The filling was also delicious and it did work a lot better filling it from the top, but i would suggest making a small starter hole there first. I also used the chocolate frosting recipe from another review(i give it 5 stars). i will definately be making this again!!! THANKS GRACE!

The filling was a little too sweet for my taste. But the cupcake itself was moist and had a good flavor. I have made them a couple of times and used different brands of unsweetened cocoa powder. Better quality cocoa powder equals better chocolate flavor. I rotated the pan halfway through baking.

Everyone loves these!  Ever since I found this site, all my friends and family think I'm a master baker.  This recipe is one of the best.  The cupcakes are very moist and the cream filling is perfect.

For something different I made some of the cupcakes in ice cream cones, like another recipe on here, and piped the filling in and iced with buttercream icing.  Then I made faces on the top with chocolate chips and sprinkles.  Kids and adults all love them.

Thanks

These turned out great!  This was the first time I made a cream filled cupcake and I was surprised how easy it was.  The cream filling really helped lighten the CHOCOLATE taste of the chocolate cupcake and chocolate icing.

I made this as a cake rather than cupcakes for my fiance's bachelor party (cause it's a ho-ho cake, and this would be the only 'ho' at the party?...). Anyhoo, it was messy! I don't recommend this in a cake form at all. Not that it diminished flavor. Those boys polished off the cake in no time flat I guess, and it was suggested that I make this again for someone else, but I might have to stick with the cupcake version next time.
On a side note, I did add vanilla to the white filling portion as suggested, and I think that helped the overall cake be a little sweeter. But that's just a guess as I was trying each layer individually rather than combined.

If you use a small decorator tip and fill it with filling and push the tip on the top of the cupcake down about 3/4 the way (without touching the bottom of the cupcake) and press slightly and squeeze and bring the pastry bag and tip straight up you can fill the inside of the cupcake and not have to punch a hole in the bottom of the cupcake liner.  Just ease off the pressure of the pastry bag as you draw the tip close to the top of the cupcake.  You will have a hole in the top of the cupcake but no one will see that once you cover it with icing.

I thought it was really great! I didn't have a pastry bag, so I had to improvise, but that was only a minor obstacle. the only bad thing to say about this recipe is my dad didn't think it had enough chocolate in it, so I would recommend adding a tad bit more. Other than that it was a quick and easy recipe that I enjoyed baking!

A family favorite. I mean, why WOULDN'T you stuff cream into a cupcake???  I often cheat and used box cake mix (dark chocolate or dark fudge) and canned frosting (also dark chocolate). I make the cream filling from this recipe and use it to fill the cupcakes and also pipe white squiggles across the top. Delicious!  It's easy to tint the cream filling too (orange for Halloween, green for St. Pat's, etc). Oh! And I also use a pastry bag with a tip to pipe the cream in through the TOP. When you frost over it with chocolate, you can't tell the cupcake's been stuffed.  Seems a much better idea than piping through the bottom. The cream could leak out and make a mess.

I loved this recipe! I followed it exactlly, I was a little scared at first when the mix looked watered down. As soon as the cupcakes came out the oven they where just right. They are very moist. I didn't use the filling, i used my own recipe for a peanut butter frosting.

I made these as an alternative to traditional Thanksgiving dessert and they were an absolute hit!  I did increase the cocoa a little to make them a little more chocolatey.  And instead of coming in thru the bottom of the cakes, I inserted the cream from the top, before layering with icing.  Wish I had put in more cream filling, but will definitely make again and again.

Made this morning.  A bit disappointed.  The cupcakes weren't very chocolatey but the filling was nice.  Next time, I think I will add more cocoa.  Texture is very soft and moist though.

I only made the filling to put in some other cupcakes I had made.  It had a very strong taste/smell of shortening.  Ruined the cupcake for me.

I just made the filling. Per the advise of previous reviews, I used a different cupcake recipe. This cream filling is absolutely delicious and so easy to make. Its creamy and fluffy and wonderful!

Based on the reviews, and the fact I had some on hand, I used a boxed cake mix, so this review doesn't reflect the cake recipe. I really liked the idea and they did taste pretty good, but I wasn't really impressed with the end product. The filling left a strange, oily coating in our mouth after we ate them.

Very easy, very delicious! The only thing I have to add is the cream filling inside got a little hard after being in the fridge but a little heating up did the trick.

I got rave reviews for the filling - though I used my own go-to chocolate cake recipe for the cupcake.  Made chocolate ganache frosting to top it off.

The cupcakes themselves are all right. Not great but not bad. The filling turned out awful, and the cupcakes are too dense for filling. The only way this would work (that I can see) is by coring the cupcake and then filling it, but I'd use a different recipe for the filling. I won't bother making this recipe again.

I only used the filling and just used a boxed devils food mix.  Filling was delicious.  I doubled the recipe for 24 cupcakes and had a lot leftover.  Probably one batch would have been enough.

These cupcakes were awesome. I didn't have any vanilla but I'm sure it would have been better if I did. I did wut another reviewer suggested about coring the cupcake and pouring in the filling and plugging it back up. Everyone loved it; even the grown ups!

Yummy cupcakes.  I used a devils food cake mix box and sub'd the oil for applesauce.  I also used the BC chocolate frosting in the can but made the cream filling as directed.  Very tasty.  Will make again!

Made these for my girls sleepover party and they were a hit!  ***** I made these again.  This time I added 1/4 cup cocoa powder and I used some leftover perked coffee in place of the water.  AWESOME!  It really amped up the flavor.  I also added *about* 1/4 cup cocoa powder to the filling mixture at my kids request.  They loved it.  I filled them through the top and then dipped in the Chocolaty satin glaze recipe from this site.  Truly a delicious cupcake!

Awesome cupcakes!!!  The turned out beautifully.  Brought them to work and everyone raved about them.  Followed the recipe to a to a T with the exception of the filling...used all butter.  I also decreased the oven temp to 350 (which I do with most of my baking)and they baked for 15 minutes.  Will be making these again for sure.  Might even try to change things around a little.  Maybe I'll try a peanut butter filling.  Yum-O!

my cupcake was more like a fudgecake.  They were gummy and light in color.  They didn't look anything like the picture. I too followed the directions to a T...my batter was very liquid like.  I thought it was weird looking when I was pouring them into the muffin pan.

These are great!  I followed the recipe to a T, the only exception being I used 1/2C butter for the filling instead of half butter, half shortening.  The lightly sweet cupcake paired with the super sweet cream is delicious.  I am so glad I was not swayed by some other reviewers' opinions of the cake as dry or not chocolatey enough; it was perfect for this application-  so much better than a store bought mix, plus it makes more!  I was surprised by how easy and fun it was to fill the cupcakes with the pastry bag.  I went in from the top and covered the hole with a chocolate glaze.  Can't wait to watch how fast they go at the bake sale tomorrow!

These were very tasty.  To me it seems like a lot of work to fill all the cupcakes, then frost them...and not sure if it is all that much better than a cake mix...but everyone raved about the special surprise inside!

YUM YUM YUMMY! I used real salted butter in place of the shortening and made the recipe as otherwise stated. They are fantastic. I'd been looking for a really good cupcake recipe and I love this. Very moist, good flavor. I like the filling because it is a little salty and balances the sweet flavor.

I am rating the filling only, and it was delicious!  I made it exactly as specified.  Very simple and easy to make with ingredients I already had on hand.  I was originally looking for something more like a pastry cream, but didn't have whole milk on hand, or a lot of time.  This was a perfect find!  I made devil's food cake cupcakes from Betty Crocker and piped this filling right in through the top using a pastry bag and small tip.  Frosted over the top with chocolate frosting and it was terrific!  Will definitely be keeping the filling recipe!  Thanks!

Makes like 36 cupcakes which is good to know, if you need alot. Used Satiny chocolate glaze from this site. You don't need alot of glaze on top of cup cake, over all would make again especially if I needed dessert for alot of people.

I just got done making these cupcakes and they are perfect! The actual cupcake is moist and delicious and the cream filling is great too! I filled my cupcakes from the top and just frosted over the hole with some chocolate frosting. They take a little longer than regular cupcakes but they are worth it!

These were awesome and so easy to make.  I used the cupcake recipe and it was great.  Added sprinkles and extra filling to the top for a kiddie cupcake. Much better than hostess! Will definitely make over and over again!

Brillant recipe!  The only change I made was to use "Special Dark" unsweetened cocoa.  It really added a nice punch to the flavor.

People were impressed by these because of the cream filling.  I thought that the cake part of it needed more flavor.  I also filled them from the top and then frosted them using a recipe someone suggested.  I definitely thought the frosting made them better.  Very fun!

Like others, I cheated and used a box cake mix for the cupcakes.  I really enjoyed the filling.  It has a nice consistancy and sweetness for my taste.  Thanks!

As per other reviewers, I did not use the actual cake recipe.  I made devils food cupcakes and filled with the cream, they were to die for.  All the kids loved them, as well as the adults.  I think I over filled them because I didn't have enough to fill all 24 cupcakes.  It was still awesome, can't wait to make again!

These were not hard at all they require a little work but not hard.  The previous reviewers were correct the cake part is not that sweet enough.  I added about a 1/2 cup more sugar but that didn't make much diffrence.  I think the next time I make this I will add chocolet chips.  I made the fosting off the back of the coco box and It was good.  I also piped the cream in on the top.  We will make these again.

What a great recipe...easy to make, had ingredients on hand and very tasty. I did insert the tip through the top of the cupcake and was happy to see that the cream filled up nooks and crannies in the cake. I've even used the cream recipe in a couple of cakes now....always a pleasant surprise when the cake is cut!
I highly recommend this one and will be making it again and again.

I used a cake mix instead, piped the filling through the top and covered with the chocolate icing so many had recommended. These were so good! Very quick and easy too.

I agree to fill from top instead of breaking thru the paper. These are wonderful! I made them for my son's birthday treats for school. My husband ate the rest- about three a day until they were gone! Everyone really liked them.

Topped them with a chocolate ganache.  My family could NOT stop eating these cupcakes!  Personally, I didn't care for the cake, but the filling was incredible.  I may try something different for the batter next time.  Overall a good recipe.

Very good- I used 1/3 cup coffee in the water and evaporated milk for more richness. The cupcakes were moist and flavorful this way. Cutting out a cylinder in the center of each cake, filling, and replacing the top worked well. Topped with pink vanilla and chcocolate buttercream and Valentine's sprinkles for a pretty presentation ;)

These are stupendous! To the people who said the cake was just ok or that they use a box mix you are crazy, the cake is perfect and delicious and so much better than all the chemicals and garbage in a mix and it took very little effort to make them. This will be my go to recipe for chocolate cupcakes! They rose up nice and high and were perfectly moist and tender. I had a bad batch of filling (old shortening? Used up a small piece that may have been in the cupboard awhile) but the consistency was perfect and filling the cupcakes is simple if you poke through the tops with a pastry bag and tip.  I used the same frosting recipe as other reviewers mentioned and even wrote it down on the printed recipe so I don't forget what goes so well on these.  Terrific recipe and thank you for sharing!

OK, well after reading the other reviews, I decided to change up the recipe a bit and this is what I did: Add a heaping Tbsp of instant coffee to the milk (don't worry, you won't taste the coffee), and stir until dissolved before you add to the dry ingredients.  Instead of a whole cup of water, only add 1/4 cup water and then add 3/4 to 1 cup of SOUR CREAM.  You might have to add a splash or two more of the water to get a good batter consistency.  This made a really moist, decadent cake.  I baked them at 350 for 23 minutes becasue of the sour cream additional ingredient.  I had to fill the cups pretty high as it is a bit dense and doesn't rise a whole lot.  I made a German Buttercream for the filling - NO CRISCO!  Then I dipped them in a chocolate ganache and used more buttercream to do a curly doodle on top.  They ended up looking just like the Hostess cupcakes but taste WAY better. They also came away from the paper wrapper FLAWLESSLY.  EVERYONE WAS RAVING!!  My kids went nuts.  I will be making these again!!!

The cupcake part was better than I expected (after reading reviews). The "satiny chocolate glaze" was a perfect topping. Next time I will do all butter for the filling, and omit the shortening. While good, I admittedly am a butter-snob and I could taste the shortening (which I didn't like too much). Overall, this was a big hit at my son's 10-year-old birthday party.

I did not care for this recipe.The cupcakes fell into crumbles inside the paper when people picked them up. In the filling all I could taste was the shortening and butter even though I added an extra amount of vanilla.

These were fun to make for our 4th of July BBQ. The filling was great but I didn't pump enough into each cupcake, next time I'll do better and make them look like the pic above. Can't wait to make again!

This was a great recipe! The cupcakes were amazing! Though make sure you use a full size muffin tin opposed to a mini muffin tin. I ended up with about 48  cupcakes. :) The filling was pretty good though I think I'll use a different one next time.

These were very good and very simple to make! I made them for dessert and used Wilton's chocolate butter cream icing with them. The ONLY problem I had with them is when I was making the cream filling the consistency was more of a liquid than a cream. I added more confectioners sugar which solved it. Everyone who ate these loved it. I will make these again and highly recommend making these.

I saved this 4 years ago and finally tried the recipe now that Hostess is temporarily out of business. I wanted it to taste like one of theirs and while it was good, it was an average chocolate cupcake (not the dark chocolate they have) with a passable white icing. I used the chocolate glaze elsewhere in this site and it was excellent.

I made these for Halloween and frosted them to look like mummies (as directed on this site).  I used basic buttercream frosting and piped long strips of white across to resemble bandages.  Then tinted some frosting yellow for the eyes and some red for the pupils.  Very sinister!  But best of all was the taste...so good and moist!  I didn't change anything in the recipe (which is rare for me) and they were great.  I will definitely make these again.  This is a good basic chocolate cupcake with or without the cream filling.  They were not dense as some reviewers reported...maybe they didn't sift the flour?  I always do for my baked goods.  Or maybe they didn't mix it long enough?  Mixing it longer produces a lighter cupcake.  To fill, I simply carved out a divot with a knife, spooned the filling in and trimmed the divot to cap the cupcake...it was perfect!

I made these for the adults attending my son's 6th birthday party over the weekend. They were a huge hit. I made them as directed with no changes, and they were just wonderful. I frosted with a chocolate buttercream and it was perfect. Will definitely be making these again.

I have grandsons who love my Red Velvet Cake (made with a Duncan Hines Golden mix!), so I used red velvet cake and filled with Cream Cheese Frosting.  Yummy!
More fun to eat than with a fork!  I will also be using the Chocolate
Cream Filled Cupcake recipe as written.

Another suggestion if you don't have a piping bag--I put 1/3 of the batter in the cupcake mold and then drop a dollop of marshmellow cream in the center--then top the rest of the mix to cover--when cooked the top of the cupcake with have a dull look but when you cut inside the cream is there

The filling separated shortly after mixing and turned into a liquid mess even though I added extra powdered sugar. The cupcakes themselves turned out okay, but nothing great

They turned out amazing! I took them to my youth group and everyone loved them! The only thing I did different was to fill them, I cut a slit in the top to about half way down and then stuck the tip into it. It was so fast and easy and the icing covered the cut very well. Over all it was a great recipe and I'm definitely going to make it again!

I only used this recipe for the cream fillings for my Oreo cupcakes! 
The frosting was yummy! it wasn't too sweet and was a nice cream filling recipe. 
I cut a hole from the top of the cupcake and filled with a piping bag :)

These cupcakes are great. Not too sweet, with a nice texture and flavor. My daughter likes them plain. The filling, however is extremely sweet, but a lot of people really like (no...love) it that way. I choose to fill through the top of the cupcake so I can frost over the hole created. I usually use the recipe for frosting that is on the Hershey's cocoa powder can. I do believe I will start using a ganache, though, to cut down on the extreme sweetness. I prefer them a bit chilled. These are usually a hit and really seem to impress a lot of people. I have been making them for years and think that my ability to tolerate sweetness at this level has diminished. The older I get the more I apreciate the depth of flavor in desserts rather than just the sweetness, but if you have a real sweet tooth these will probably totally satisfy:) I may try making a ganache and dipping the tops of the cakes in it rather than using the frosting in order to cut the sweetness.

I only made the filling: I was expecting it to be a lttle 'thicker'. It tasted good and I used it in my own cake recipie and won 2nd place at my church picnic.  Also, used a small melon baller to take out cake from the top.

These are pretty simple to make and very moist, the chocolate taste is a mild one and they do taste homemade. The 1st time i made these i thought the filling with added frosting was too sweet. The second time i made these i did a chocolate glaze and a cherry is was perfect!!

My girls made these without help, and they turned out great. Best cupcakes I've had in a long time! To save time, we used the Whipped chocolate icing we bought at the grocery store. When putting in the filling, don't be shy about putting too much in. I think we should have put in more because it seemed to disappear. Super yummy recipe!

I followed the recipe to the tee and the cupcakes turned out "ok".  The kids are my biggest critics and they weren't raving about the cupcakes BUT they did LOVE the filling and asked if there was any filling left.  I didn't have a pastry bag, so I used a spoon and hollowed out small portion in the middle of each cupcake.  Overall, ok recipe for the cupcakes and yummy for the filling!

This recipe is soo good!!! I always make cupcakes and take them to work with me and everyone said that these are the best cupcake i've ever made. Easiest way to fill them is to get a piping bag and the tip for filling, it takes like 3 seconds to fill them. Will definatley make these again!!!

I made these for my family on Labor day and they really liked them, the filling is great, and I think it would be a great "base" as well to add other flavorings too for other fillings.  I used a chocolate cake mix due to time and added a hint of almond flavoring, very tasty!

These cakes were awesome and way better than the ones from the box!  The cake was moist and the cream filling was so yummy!  I used milk chocolate frosting and my family raved about them.  We'll definitely be making these again soon!

Delicious!!  These cupcakes are absolutely wonderful and are a huge hit anytime I make them.  I used the frosting recipe mentioned in another review, and also cored out part of the cupcake from the top & filled that way.  Wouldn't change a single thing - these are wonderful!!

Love the concept, but suggest some improvements to make it a 5 star. The first time I baked these I followed the recipe and used the satiny chocolate glaze.  The result looked nice but was bland.  I used mid-grade organic cocoa in the cake and a popular brand of chocolate chips for the glaze. The second time I changed the cake recipe to Dark Chocolate Cake II, used the same cocoa and filling, but then changed the frosting to Chocolate Ganache made with a upgraded 60% Cocoa bittersweet baking bar - and the combo was great!  I tried the ganache both in the shiny, dense form and whipped a little; both were excellent. Two tips are 1) You need to get enough frosting inside; I tried filling from below and also the cone method but the best result was to cut a cone from the top, then hollow out the space below into a cylinder, fill with cream, and then cut the bottom off the cone before replacing it 2) Be generous with the chocolate ganache. The ganache is bittersweet so apply accents with a sweeter decorator frosting on top.  Yum!

Great idea. The cupcake recipe isn't *amazing,* but it's pretty good. I added peppermint extract and red food coloring to the cream and filled them through the top. They were a big hit.

I made 2 dozen of these and the family loved them. They all said they tasted better than the store bought brand name creamy cupcakes. One word of advice, if you like cream filling consider upping the recipe. Maybe even doubling it

I had every intention of following this entire recipe, but in the end, I had to use my "go-to" chocolate cake recipe because I know it's perfect.  I followed the recipe for the cream filling exactly, though, and I LOVE it. It's light, creamy, fluffy, and has a wonderful taste. I read some reviews that said it was too thin, or runny, but this wasn't the case for me. It was the perfect consistency. I do need to master the art of filling the cupcakes, though, there wasn't nearly as much cream in them as I wanted.  This is a keeper for me.

Try piping the filling through the top of the cupcakes.  You avoid the hole in the liner and people are so surprised!  Love this recipe!!!

I halved the recipe, & I think my muffin tin must be jumbo sized, I got 12 cupcakes halving the recipe. I must say, the filling is AWESOME. The cake part is probably a 3 or a 4--it tastes good, but it isn't the "most chocolatey" or "most tender" or "most" anything of recipes I've tried. It's just a good sturdy cake part. The filling is outstanding. I frosted mine with "Buttercream Frosting" from this site, which is pretty much the same recipe as the filling for these cupcakes. I'm sure I'll get roped into making these again :-) Thanks for the recipe!

alrighty, first  things first, just used the filling rec.. Choc. might have been more suitable but any box cake mix will work... Great recipe... 1St tip WAIT till they cool COMPLETELY before adding filling. If you don't you'll make the mistake like I did and the cupcake will SOAK up your filling. I LOADED my cupcakes with filling, but the naxt day when you took a bite there was BARLEY any filling there. LET COOL and LOAD IT UP! Second, If your frosting, pipe right through the top and just frost over..  I didn't have a piping bag so... I took a plastic straw and cut it about 1 inch long, Took a large freezer bag and poked the straw through the corner, kinda loose so at the bag tip I scotched taped it tight,  add frosting and squeeze. Worked PERFECT. Easy to work with different options with this recipe.

I am only giving 4 stars as I didn't make the cake or frosting, just the filling. I split the cupcakes from the top, put all the filling in a plastic ziplock with the corner cut out and piped the filling in. Next time I will try the apple corer, as I think I could control the amount each was filled better. I will try all the recipe the next time and rerate. The filling is wonderful, btw, well worth making.

I really wish I knew what I did wrong here. I followed the recipe to a T, and mine were light, light brown with no chocolate flavor and hard as a brick. Not good. I am thinking it HAS to be operator error since it has so many GOOD reviews. Just wish I knew. Not sure I will try again tho. Mine were bad enough my kids wouldn't even eat them. If I try again, I will re-rate them.

Really delicious cupcakes! I had no trouble filling them. I used a tip with a large hole, and filled from the top. Used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site to top them. They looked beautiful. The cupcake is not too sweet or rich, so it's perfect with the filling. I've made these several times, this is now one of my go-to cupcake recipes! So much more special than a plain cupcake.

I'm not a very good cook, so I expected the recipe to turn out so-so b/c of my abilities.  I was so surprised when this turned out great.  My 10 and 7 yr old helped.  I love the cake recipe itself and will use it to make any chocolate cupcakes from now on.  Also, stuffing the cupcakes was easy with a syringe (unsure about my spelling).  Thanks for the recipe and new found confidence in my cooking, LOL.

I used the recipe without filling the cupcake....Bad idea. The cake is a little on the bland side and not so rich and I think that's what makes it work with the cream filling. I did make some cupcakes with the filling that what sooooo good. So 3 stars without the filling. 4 stars with! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made these last month and I used the frosting submitted by another reviewer, and they were perfect! The cupcakes were nice and moist and friends said they were better than the regular Hostess Cupcakes! I found that using a plastic syringe to insert the frosting from the top of the cupcake is much easier than filling it from the bottom. I poked a hole in the top of the cupcake, filled it with icing using the syringe, and then frosted the cupcake.  Great recipe!

This is a very good filling, I used all butter, and cream instead of milk, because if your going to eat a cupcake, why not make it as decadent as you possibly can. Delicious! It was great in my brightly colored Tie Dye cupcakes for Easter (the frosting was lime green).

As a concept, these were awesome, and came out really beautiful. However, the cake part, as other reviewers also agreed, was a bit dry, not that great. The filling was great thought. One batch made 24 minis, and 16 medium cupcakes, and I put the very last of the batter(amount of one cupcake)Into an ice cream cone to see how it turns out. Puffed up beautifully, and was awesome after filling! I poked the tops with the piping bag using the star tip, and pushed it to the bottom, and filled them. Very easy no mess no fuss. After filling, I made a chocolate ganache and dipped the tops into it, which covered the hole and they were gorgeous and glossy on top! I love the idea of them, So I will make again with anoter cake recipe, and I will aso make the ice cream cone ones, as they were gorgeous and great with the filling inside them! Thanks for the idea, love it!

What a GREAT recipe!  It was such a pleasant surprise to everyone that tried one.  We have soy allergies in the family and this was a real treat! My husband is not a big sweets person.  He was concerned about it being a sugar rush.  The cake was a good balance with the filling. I frosted it with a homemade chocolate frosting as others have done.  It added a nice touch and it was better than any store bought version.  My kids loved them.

After reading many of the reviews, I chose the Devils Food Cupcakes from Betty Crocker, the filling from this receipe, and the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site - unbelievable combination! Cupcakes were a huge hit! My husband followed the recipes and just made them again and they were just as amazing as the first time! I used the handle end of a wooden spoon to make the hole and swirled it around a bit, then piped in the filling with a small ziploc with a tiny corner cut off - worked perfectly!!

Excellent!  I cheated a bit by using a boxed cupcake mix and store bought icing, but I used this recipe for the filling and I was amazed at how easy and delicious it was.  Now that I know how to do this, I'll make these cupcakes everytime!

These are very good cupcakes.  The cupcakes came out perfect with no changes to the recipe.  The filling was also very good with no changes to the recipe.  Need to experiment with another frosting because it wasn't the best that I got from this website.

So Good! So Easy.  I used 1/4 tsp peppermint extract instead of the vanilla. Perfect for those who like Chocolate & Mint together. Very moist. I got 48 domed cupcakes.  Frosted them with, Creamy Chocolate Frosting, from this site. 5-stars and more!

These were great!  The filling is delicious!!  I used a cake mix for the cake and piped the filling in from the top.  I do need to work on my filling technique a bit . . . think I used too small of a tip.  I didn't remove any cake to fill them, just stuck the tip in and squeezed the filling in.  Worked great, will work even better with a larger tip next time (this time I used a 10-worked pretty good but I like the filling so much that I wanted more in each cake).  Used chocolate frosting and decorated the tops with leftover filling.  Thanks!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted the flour for cake flour. Turned out a bit more dense which was nice. My boyfriend was happy that it wasn't overpoweringly chocolaty as well. The tops did come out as little peaks rather than a rounded mound so I'm not sure if that was the cake flour or something else. I topped them with a mint buttercream frosting I found on this site (If you use it I suggest only 1/2 a tsp of peppermint extract)

Easy recipe. Tasted pretty good. I also left out the shortening and substituted butter. Everyone enjoyed the little surprise treat inside!

Only rating the cream - I added 2 tblspn of cheesecake pudding dry mix and also a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Whipped the mixture for a good 7 minutes and it was perfect texture. Filled the cupcakes very easily with a piping bag. Made the ganache chocolate frosting for the top. Then did my "Fauxtess" white piping on the top. Everyone loved the dessert at our dinner party!!

These were a hit.  Frosting the tops with chocolate frosting is a must, as well as filling the cupcakes from the top instead of the bottom.

I am only rating the filling, used boxed devil's food cake mix.  The filling was delicious!  I iced the cupcakes with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting recipe from this site.  They've been getting rave reviews from everyone!

I used boxed cake mix to make the cupcakes and then made the filling based on the recipe. The filling was very easy to make.Frosted them with a can of frosting. They were yummy! Everyone that tried them liked them. I would definitely recommend trying these especially if you have a sweet tooth.

Taste wise, these were average, but too cute when decorated!  I had a hard time knowing when I had filled them with enough cream, so I had to randomly open some to check them.  But that's my own lack of experience, not the recipe.

I made these according to the recipe and they were a HUGE hit!  Once cooled, I simply put the tip of the pastry bag in the top of the cup cake and squeezed until the top puffed up a little bit.  Then I put icing on them.  Everyone loved them and the cream filling was perfect inside.  No need to cut a hole in the cup cake at all.

These were very delicious, they turned moist and tasted MUCH better than any cake box cupcake! I made the frosting just like the filling but added cocoa powder to it until I thought it was chocolatey enough.

This was quite yummy...the cake could have been a little better.  It just seemed to be missing something, but I can't put my finger on it.  The filling was delish...and I took the suggestion of filling from the top.  Worked great and then I just topped with store bought frosting.  Next time I'll make my own, but it was fine in a pinch.  They disappeared fast!

Very good! I scaled it down to just 6 cupcakes so I could cook a small batch in my toaster oven. I think you could also use marshmellow fluff as the cream filling and it would be very good!

The cupcake itself tastes great. For some reason my filling melted into the cupcake so when you bit into it, it's just gooey. Some of my friends found that weird.

I went the easy route and used a Devil's food cake mix for the cupcakes. After filling the cakes I spread a very thin layer of Chocolate frosting on top and then topped them off with some sliced strawberries.  The strawberries were just tart enough to offset the sweet cream in the middle.  They looked pretty and everybody raved at how delicious they were.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making again for sure.

I hardly ever bake from scratch but this was easy and straight forward so I decided to give it a try.  I used another recipe on the site for chocolate buttercream frosting and I omitted the creamy filling.  Moist, delicious, a new family favorite.  I ate way too many myself though!!  Will definitely make again.

My daughter picked these out out some time ago and I've just got round to making them. I filled the cases a little more than a third full and they rose well. Like most reviewers I went in from the top when filling these. We decided not to frost as we thought it might be a bit too much so we just added a chocolate button on the top to hide the hole. Everybody loved these including my husband who never tries cookies or cakes but he was intrigued by the filling so had a taste. My 14 year old and I had fun with this recipe. A big thankyou.

In reading other reviews and seeing the cake part itself wasn't very sweet-I cheated and used devils food cake recipe instead-but the filling was great..I used heavy cream and milk for the liquid for a richer taste.  I used more than 3tbsp to make it a bit more smooth.  These tasted better than a hostess cupcake!

Addictive!  I have eaten 4 in 4 hours!  One thing I did with the last batch that was helpful, was to spray the paper liners with a little nonstick spray so that they would not stick so much and come out more whole.

I "borrowed" the cream filling recipe and just used a regular cake mix, but they were absolutely delicious.  I used the chocolate frosting recipe recommended which was also great.  Maybe I used too much filling in mine, but one recipe only made enough for 12 cupcakes so I would definitely recommend doubling recipe if making more than that.

i put chocolate frosting on it from Chocolate Frosting I by Tianne(as suggested) and they were good, i don't think that they would have been as good without the frosting as they weren't very chocolatey (and not quite as moist as i would want). i filled the cupcake holder 3/4 way full as well and they didn't make as much as the recipe said either (but filling halfway would have made very small cupcakes). 
not my favorite though.

Excellent filling! Also just easier to fill from the top when you also plan to frost the cupcakes.

This is as close as you can probably get to the hostess cupcake.  The filling really makes it.  I have tried different chocolate icing but haven't found one that I really like.  If anyone has a good chocolate icing that is like the hostess cupcakes please share.  Thanks for this fun and great tasting recipe.

No changes, however, is there cupcake pans with insert or centre tube to pour batter around and then the hole would be there for filing.  Find it messy use pastry bag.  Valentine cupcakes were very good and were devoured by all my family.

I made these cupcakes yesterday and they taste good and the cream tastes good as well however, when I baked the cupcakes and pulled them out they completely sunk. They looked like they had hardly any batter in them, so I scraped all of the cupcakes into a bowl and made one cake ball instead. I am not sure how this happened considering no one else seems to have had this issue. I would be interested in trying them again if I can figure out how to not make them sink and basically evaporate.

These cupcakes are wonderful. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and reduced the oil by 1/2 cup they still had an amazing flavor! Although a couple of my cupcakes overflowed, that was my fault for putting too much batter in, I most definitely will come back to this recipe.

I doubled the icing recipe....The icing recipe was very sweet. For those who like less sweet, add more fats and less sugar. Other than they were easy to make. My family loved it and it was pretty good practice for my culinary class on Monday.  I recommend putting lemon juice in the icing....lemon and chocolate, absolutely complement each other.

I made these and the were great. To fill the centers I cored out a hole in the "top" of the cupcake with an apple corer, and filled using a pastry bag with med tip.  You can place a slice of the cored part back over the hole. When you frost them you don't see the hole on top anyway. Works out great. >^..^

These cupcakes were moist, flavorful, and best of all, easy. They don't fall apart, which makes eating them particularly enjoyable. The filling is perfectly fantastic, nothing more to add about that. I topped them with butter cream frosting (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/7638/butter-cream-frosting-i/), which was the perfect combination. While they can keep for a good while, all 36 of mine were gone in two days. This is an amazing recipe.

Out of this world!  These cupcakes baked up so nice and tall, moist, and tasty!  Everybody loved them--my son even helped to fill them with cream!  Super awesome and special for a unique treat!  Thanks.  I used the Chocolate Glaze 1 from this website for the icing and I used my own buttercream.

I ONLY used the cupcake batter part of this recipe. It taste just right for a homemade hostess cupcake. For the Cream Filling I used the recipe "the best frosting I've ever had" from another website. Then I used melted chocolate chips with some coconut oil to dip the tops in. Came out perfect and everyone loved them.

The cupcakes were delicious, most like a brownie,was not sure when i made the batter it was very watery, but turned out delicious. The filling was watery as well had to add regular icing to the batter to make it thicker. Overall they were a great hit and would make them again with modifications to the filling...

It was a delicious cupcake recipe. They did have a bread-like texture, but that was my fault for over mixing. They didn't rise much at all, so they were about 1 inch thick. So I put the filling on the top. The filling was like a doughnut glaze. I also loved the subtle chocolate taste. It was delicious! My whole family loved them! 

P.S. The first few that came out of the oven had a bread-like texture, but now they have a nice cupcake texture. These are GREAT!!!

TIPS: I reduced the salt to 1/2 Teaspoon of Salt, because I thought it was way to much. I also used canola oil instead of vegetable, because canola oil has almost no taste.

This makes an amazing cupcake filling!  I did not  try the chocolate cupcakes but I made the filling for my vanilla cupcakes this week.  Fantastic!  Held up well and as a few others have said, was even better after sitting for a day.  I died my filling pink for a little girls' party and they loved it!

These were okay, but my kids would much rather have the Hostess brand cupcakes.  The cream in this tasted a little greasy.

1 cup flour, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/3 cup melted coconut oil, 1 egg and 1/3 of the salt and soda make for perfect 12 cupcakes.

These cupcakes were a hit!  However, the amount of cream filling in the cupcakes was inconsistent.  Some had too little, others had too much! Any suggestions on how to fill each cupcake with the right amount of cream?

This turned out pretty good. I had fun trying this recipe out. The chocolate cupcake was a bit bland on its own and the filling was very sweet on its own BUT they seem to complement each other very well when put together. I used a vanilla frosting for the top, but I think it was a bit too much for the cupcake. Next time I want to try a thin layer of chocolate frosting on top. Overall, great recipe and plan on trying it again :)

I thought these were a great idea, but just okay in taste. the cupcakes are a little to dense which makes it hard to pipe enough filling into center. i wound up coring the center out and filling that way. i used the hard chocolate glaze from this site which worked great. they were super cute, so i will try again with another cake recipe and maybe change the filling to a more pudding like filling.

Very tasty, pretty easy and creative. I agree with other people that you need to squeeze the pastry bag slowly and evenly to get a good amount of filling in. Everyone kept asking how I got the filling in the middle, I thought it was more amusing to keep them in the dark.

I made these cupcakes the other night after watching a cupcake cooking contest and they turned out wonderful and fulfilled my craving.  My boys loved them too.  I used the chocolate frosting recipe that was suggested by another reviewer and wow, AWESOME!  Will be making these again.

OMG!!! Took these to work and more than half of my coworkers said these are the best cupcakes they had ever eaten!  When adding the milk to the cream filling, I would add little at a time, being aware of the consistency of the cream.

This recipe was ok.  The cupcakes were moist (they should be with that much oil) but not very flavorful.  Maybe next time I would add some more cocoa.  I did NOT like the filling.  It was just frosting - nothing special.  I would rather have something fluffier / lighter.  I will probably make these again (with adjustments) and try to find a different filling recipe.  All in all it wasn't terrible - just not my favorite.  Addendum:  Made these again (a couple years later) minus the filling.  I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups of evaporated cane sugar and used mostly wheat pastry flour.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and increased the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup.  I really like these!  They were a light and airy cupcake.

I made these today for my son's 2nd birthday.  This has to be one of the best cupcakes I've had.  It was super easy, even though the thought of filled cupcakes is intimidating.  I thought the cake itself was moist and delicious, even better than a boxed cake.  I did fill the cupcakes through the top and covered the hole with Chocolate Frosting I from AR.  I would highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

We love this recipe! My whole family loves these cupcakes, they are requested for all special occasions (I'll be making them again today for my husband's birthday). Friends who have had them say they're filled with awesome. After the first batch, I thought they were a little too oily, so I reduce the amount of oil, and substitute applesauce (1/2 cup of oil, 1/2 cup applesauce). We've also added coffee syrup or chocolate syrup to the filling for a different flavor. We top these with the satiny chocolate glaze. They taste just like Hostess filled cupcakes! Enjoy!

The cupcake and the frosting tasted great, but it was more work than what it was worth.  I could not tell how much cream I was piping into the top of the cupcake.  Like others, I piped through the top and then frosted them.  I doubt I would make this again.  Cute though.

I was wary at first because the cake part didn't seem sweet enough and the filling was way to sweet.  I did the recipe as is, and am glad.  They turned out delicious!  The two balanced each other out perfectly.  I did cut a "core" from each cup cake and filled with a pastry bag from the top.  I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe on this website for the frosting, just dunk the cupcakes in for a smooth surface.  I used white chocolate chips and the glaze recipe for the decorative top.  My boyfriend took them into work and they devoured them!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these with my kids. They were easy and fun to make and surprisingly chocolatey for the small amount of cocoa powder. No special ingredients to go out and buy either. I just iced them instead of filling because I was feeling lazy. Yum!

These were so good. I put food coloring in the cream to make it pink for my daughter's 1st birthday party and everyone LOVED them. They were gone in no time! Yum! I didn't even put icing on them.

These are amazing and very easy to make. I will be making these again. The only critique I have is the cake part of the cupcakes were somewhat crunchy around the edges. I will absolutely make again, with a different cake recipe.  Amazing!

Good idea...but the cupcake part is not at all tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out not very chocolatey nor very moist. I used my own favorite recipe for frosting and i'm dissapointed i used it to frost these cupcakes. Should have just made the ones from the box.

I would like this better if the cake was more chocolate-y. The filling was delish. I've never filled cupcakes before, but these were easy. I inserted the tube at the top and the hole was covered by chocolate frosting. Thanks!

These cupcakes were really good, especially the filling. I liked the cake part but next time I will probably just make cupcakes from a mix. I used the Texas Chocolate frosting from this site on top. I used cake flour instead of regular in the recipe and it was fine. I also ended up cutting a cone shaped hole out of the top with a knife, putting the filling in there and then frosting over the top, to get a little more filling inside, since that's the best part. I can see why this recipe is a crowd-pleaser!

This rating is in the middle because the filling was fantastic...a 5, but the cupcake mix was not so great... probably like a 1 or 2. I will make again for special occasions since they take so long to make, but will use a different cake recipe or mix the next time around. Frosted with fudge icing wich turned out really well. Kids loved to help make these!

These are well worth the time! The cupcakes are moist even without the cream filling and beyond fabulous with it. I halved the recipe and frosted them using the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site. They were gobbled up quickly. Yum! I look forward to trying these with white cake and strawberry filling.

Excellent just as written.  I loved everything about these cupcakes.  The texture was just dense enough to provide a good contrast to the filling.  I used Ghirardelli cocoa for just the right amount of chocolate flavor:  not too sweet.  The batter will seem to be very runny but bakes up perfectly.  The filling also seemed to be a bit stiff, but is perfect inside the cupcake.  I also filled the cupcakes from the top, however I used a medium pastry tip and filled until I saw the top of the cupcake rise...it couldn't have been easier!  I topped them off with the "Hard Chocolate Glaze" also on AR...perfect! Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.  I'll never make a plain old boring cupcake again!

After reading all the other reviews, I thought this would be tasty and easy to make. The cake batter recipe was ok, but very dense. I think that was the problem when it came to filling them.The filling just sat in the little hole I carved out. I think next time I will try just a boxed mix, and fill them from the top as other people had suggested. The filling was wonderful. It was very creamy and sweet. I did not get far enough to ice them, I was too frustrated that they were not working out well.

These were good.  I loved the filling idea.  The cake wasn't my favorite chocolate cake recipe though it is good.  The filling was good.  I made with the saintly chocolate glaze from this site.  Next time I will use the filling and the glaze recipes and try a different cake.  I filled them from the top since you can't see the hole once you frost them.

These cupcakes were very good. Not too sweet and very moist.  They were practically falling apart. I used a pointy wine coint screw to put holes in the middle and just filled from the top. For the icing, I used nutella mixed with mix. These came out great!

The cream filling is great but the cupcake itself is NOT. It has a very dense almost muffin-like consistency - not a good thing.
I made these for a small party and did not even bring them.
They do look cute though!

Made the cream filling part of this recipe twice this weekend and it was fantastic each time.  The first was in some mini red velvet cupcakes for the 4th and the second was in a store bought chocolate cupcake mix for a birthday.  Both times they got rave reviews.  Makes a nice surprise in an otherwise simple dessert.  Since I iced them, I just squirted it in the top, rather than through the liner like the recipe suggested.

Easy recipe to make/follow, even for my 3-year-old to help!  Halved, it yielded 15 cupcakes.  I substituted pumpkin butter for 1/2 the oil, and used 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour with 1 c regular all-purpose.  These came out SOOOOO yummy, and such a hit for my hubby's birthday dinner (his request was cupcakes!).

I only made the Cream filling but it was Fantastic, I was hesitant to use shortening but glad that it came out so good! I also added Mint extract ( about 1 1/2 TSP) to half of the filling and mixed it until it was nice and smooth. I filled it from the top as well as frosted the filling on top and used it as icing. It gave it the  flavour of a chocoalte mint cupcake and it tasted great.

I thought these were really good, the cake part was great. The filling is a basic buttercream frosting. I doubled the recipe and used it to fill and frost. I'd make again but I think I'd use a diff. frosting just for contrast.

I used a boxed cake mix and used the ingredients for the filling. It was way too sweet and I love sweet stuff! I would cut the powdered sugar to 1 cup or add some cream crease to cut down on the sweetness. Plus it was thin and I put them in the fridge to firm up the filling. I will not use the filling again. Will keep looking.

Both my boyfriend and I think these were pretty tasty. Only problem was that cake batter was not quit sweet enough and the filling was a little too sweet. Next time I might fool around a little bit to get a happy medium.

I printed this out a long time ago and just got around to making it; they were definitely worth the effort. I piped the cream through the top and then frosted them with chocolate frosting. My kids loved them, too.

These cupcakes rose up very well, but I found that they weren't very flavorful without the cream. The cake part was very bland and I followed the directions perfectly. Luckily I used the cream filling with the Waldorf Astoria Cake Frosting from here, which helped. I found filling the cupcakes to be very easy when using a freezer bag with cake decorating tips and filling them from the top. I don't think I will use the cake recipe again, but I will use the filling again.

These cupcakes are very good. I did as another reviewer and piped a little dab on the top of the cupcake where I squirted in the filling. I also used 1/2 cup shortening by mistake, but they still tasted wonderful.

This recipe is great.  Those chocolate cupcakes are fantastic and rise to double!  I found it hard to fill the cupcakes though, so I cut through with a knife first, but that doesn't change the fact that it is excellent.  The cake is nice and moist.  With the first batch, I even forgot to put the eggs in (oops!) and it turned out anyway!  Although it is better with the egg and looks more glossy.  The cream filling is so perfect!  Thank you so much!
