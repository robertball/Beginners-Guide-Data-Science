This was an easy delicious recipe.  I did not take the time and "cut up" the chicken parts, instead I just floured and browned them 5 minutes on each side - - added 5 minutes to the cooking time and followed the recipe.  I served this with a salad and garlic cheese bread - - it was a "HIT".  Definitely Quick and Easy to Prepare!

Gotta kick it up! I used healthier olive oil. While the chicken is in the oil, mince a fresh garlic clove and throw it in. Then, once the sauce is added, hit it with at least five dashes of Tabasco! Now we're talkin'...

Very good and so easy! I will make again. The sauce gave the chicken a nice flavor and chicken stayed moist. Great to make when you do not have much time to fuss.

I would give this recipe a 4.5 because I thought it was very good.  My husband liked it, but it was not one of his favorites.

Good, for a quickie type dinner. I cut chicken breasts into large chunks, floured, then browned them in olive oil. Took chicken out of skillet, then sauteed onions and peppers, before adding an Italian sauce and extra garlic powder and oregano.  Brought sauce to boil, then put chicken back in and added 5 minutes to cook time. Served over spaghetti noodles. Not bad.

Fast and easy. I used the Prego sauce I had on hand. Will definitely add this to my rotation of chicken dishes! Thanks!

The family liked it.  I used saut√©d mushrooms & Newman's Own sauce & cut up chicken.  Cooked up quickly.  Kept on warm until family was ready to eat (stirring occasionally).  Put on plates on top of the pasta then sprinkled w/ cheese.
