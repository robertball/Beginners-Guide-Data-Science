The original receipe is not healthy with 27 grams of fat. I substitute applesauce for the oil and use 2 eggs and 4 egg whites instead of 4 eggs. Top with the melted butter and parmesan cheese (real not the dried up kind in the little canister). Reduces the fat quite a lot. For added nutrition, try using half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.

I keep a supply of these pancakes, some made with zucchini and some made with carrot, in my freezer for a quick, healthy snack for my 1-year old. I use whole wheat flour and skip the butter. Instead, I spread a thin layer of unsweetened applesauce on top, and she gobbles them up. I do add more spices...a good amount of cinnamon, nutmet, and sometimes cloves or allspice.

Zucchini pancakes are the best! My mom used to make them when we were kids. It was a great way to get us to eat vegetables, and it was cheap since the main ingredient grew bountifully in the garden.

The other reviewers missed the boat on the toppings, however. You have to put a little butter and some Parmesan cheese on top of these pancakes. And, we always had them for dinner... not breakfast.

Add 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese to mixture.  Also, I use 1 cup of Bisquick instead of flour.  It is really yummy!

These pancakes were amazing!  Even the kids loved them.  They were easy to make and tasted great.  I added a bit of cinnamon and topped them with syrup for breakfast.  They were a hit with my family and I will definitely make them again.

I LOVE this recipe for my kids!!! I have done it with shredded carrots for 'orange' pancakes and have also used the shredded brocolli you can get in the produce section (Mann's I think) and my 3 year-old and 1 year-old eat their veggies. They're very simple to whip up and you get to be inventive SuperMOM!

I thought these were edible, Hubs didn't care for them at all and didn't eat them. I was prepared for them being different from traditional "potato pancake" type zucchini pancakes but not to this extent.  Too much flour, too much baking powder and no seasoning made these poofy and flavorless.  (There was something about them that reminded me of egg fu yung, so I tried soy sauce on them and it really wasn't bad!)

Very, very good. I added a handful of blueberries and the kids were so busy objecting to the blueberries, that they didn't even notice the hiding zucchini (who's weird kids are these anyways, who doesn't like blueberries? ;) I added maybe a tablespoon of cinnamon, tasted like blueberry zucchini bread! I made a simple sugar and blueberry syrup to spread on top, so good. The kids just put normal pancake syrup and ate them up. My husband said these were "BUENISIMO!" (literally), even after I giggled and told him we were having vegetables for breakfast ;) This recipe is a keeper, great way to use up the bounty of zucchini since there are only so many times you want to eat zucchini bread (and I love me some zucchini bread). Thank you!

I'm adding my comment for my own reference because I need to remember how I modified this recipe because it was outstanding! I made this recipe for my husband for lunch, I brought it to the office and he said there was no way he was going to eat it all. He had one bite, declared them to be incredibly good, and said he was definitely eating every single one! The only reason why this is getting four stars instead of five because I never actually made the original recipe, so I can't speak to how good it is! I used applesauce instead of oil, Cut out 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and I added feta cheese, minced peppers, chopped green onions, cumin, and a little bit of pizza seasoning. I served them with sliced avocado, sour cream, and a garnish of cilantro.

The recipe used some of my zucchini, yet the recipe is bland.  I added some cinnamon and vanilla to make it better.  My picky 3-year-old ate zucchini without knowing it!

I love zucchini  And I am the queen of substitution:  3 eggs 1 1/2 cup of zucchini 2/4 cup of all purpose flour (this was all i had on hand) 1/4 cup of hungry jack mix 1/2 teaspoon of sugar 1 tablespoon of oil  This was so good with and without syrup; we even tried this with applesauce and it was great. We will most definitely have again. Brenda

tasted good!!! I did make a few changes. I added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 wheat flour, apple sauce instead of the oil and a little extra zucchini. I also added raisins for extra flavor. GOOD LUCK!!

My family and I thought that this recipe was just ok. It tasted a bit bland. They were pretty good if you put syrup and butter on them. 
It's a good way to use up zucchini.

I had all the ingredients on hand and a craving for zucchini pancakes so I tried this recipe out.  Very different from what I was craving, but they are good.  My husband loves them, what I was looking for was a less pancake, more zucchini type patty, which is what we are both used to.  He said he prefers this version however.  Very fluffy, delicate taste, and not heavy.  I will make this again since he liked it so much.  Kids would not touch.

Perfect recipe! I added some red pepper, onions, tomatoes, and cajun seasoning. I let them brown more on the griddle for the crispiness.Turned out  very fluffy and crunchy at the same time.

Yum! I made a single serving of these and they were so good for dinner. I ommited the sugar and tasted just right for evening food. They were soft and moist like real pancakes but with a homemade charm and used up my Mom's giant zucchini from her garden! Will definitley make again. Thanks.

These pancakes are heavenly and addictive, when I follow the recipe exactly (don't be tempted to use boxed pancake mix like I did once - blek.)  They're especially good with Chinese food.

They weren't quite what I expected.  But still good.  I guess my biggest problem is what to serve with them or put on them.  I put parmesan cheese on them.  It didn't quite hit the spot.  I'll have to keep experimenting.

I had extra shredded zucchini from making bread and didn't want to toss it.  I made these pancakes and they are awesome.  My husband loved them too!  Thanks for posting.  It's great and deserving of five stars.

Not sure how to rate these since i've never had zucchini pancakes before.  The recipe was pretty easy but I thought they were kind of 'eggy' tasty and a little too mushy.

Update - I added a bunch of parmesan cheese and some minced onion to the rest of the batter and i thought it was a lot better.

This was a good recipe, we had it for breakfast and added cinnamon to the batter as someone else had suggested.  Although my kids were a bit worried about the green, they ate well and we will do this again.

This was surprisingly good!! I omitted the oil, and had a little more zucchini, so I ended up adding more flour. I used whole oat flour, and spiced it up with cinnamon. I will be keeping this recipe for sure!!

These were just kind of gross. They tasted like an omelet with zucchini in it, not a pancake. Too much egg flavour. Edible but I won't be keeping this recipe.

Loved them!  I used cinnamon applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 wheat flour, replaced 2 eggs with egg whites. Smidge of splenda instead of sugar.  Left out the melted butter. What a great pancake, liked it better than bisquick pancakes and got a vegetable in for breakfast!

Consistency of pancakes, but made savory and healthy w/ zucchs and eggbeaters.  Threw in some shredded cheddar cheese before putting 'em on the griddle.  Topped w/ butter - breakfast for dinner!  Tried it also w/ parmesan cheese but that overpowered the taste of anything else.  Will keep recipe

This recipe is delicious.  I put the zucchini in my food processor along with some vidalia onion.  I also made half the recipe as I only had two eggs.  They cook great on a skillet.  Topped with melted butter and fresh romano cheese on top.  This is sure to please.

These were great. I used a few less eggs as well as 2 Tblsp of sugar. I added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and put blueberries on top. These were a hit! Will make again.

This is an amazing twist to pancakes.  If you are like us, we have zucchinis coming out our noses, so this is a fantastic way to eat it up.   Kids love it.   5 stars for sure.

Bravo William! These 5 stars don't do you justice.
As a rookie gardener, I have been blessed with much zucchini and was searching for a pancake recipe.  These are out of this world!  It can be used as a savory or sweet pancake by adjusting the sugar and salt.  This a great all-round pancake recipe!  (I might try them using blueberries...!)

This was perfect.  I was looking for a recipe that is more dessert like-great with powdered sugar or syrup.  It does have an egg-crepe like taste instead of traditional pancakes, but I loved it.

These are delicious! When my kids saw the the green flecks in them they weren't sure if they would like them but they licked the plates clean! I poured syrup over them and sprinkled a little powder sugar on the top to make them more appealing but they went over great! My 4 year old grabbed one and ate it plain. Next time I make them I will add some chocolate chips to the batter and serve them with powder sugar for a special treat for the kids... Will definitely make again!

I was looking for a recipe to get my picky three year old to eat his veggies. This was it! I have to admit I changed it a little but I am rating the texture,ease, and adaptability.  I did add some cinnamon and a little bit more sugar. Also I added some chocolate chips. And this last time, a little more flour because I didn't take the extra water out of the grated zucchini. I think it helps to squeeze out some of the water from the zucchini after grating it in the food processor. I can make a batch and freeze them for easy quick and healthy breakfasts for him. They turn out so fluffy and yummy! Thanks for the great recipe.

If I could give this recipe more stars I would!!!!  The best zucchini recipe I found this season.  
I changed just slightly and only because I have extremely picky eaters. First, I peeled and pureed zucchini (my husband could not even tell) added 1Tbs sugar and used whole wheat pastry flour. Then, I allowed the batter to rest for about 10 minutes to let the baking powder activate.
I can't believe how light and fluffy they were--from the photo they looked kind of dense but wow!!! thanks for such a great healthy recipe.  My children secretly thank you,too.

I prefer my recipe which has more zucchini and less flour. This truly is a pancake, just like the recipe says. Don't fix it thinking you are going to get anything else but that.

The batter is light and cake-y, you would not know the zucchini was there except for the light green flecks. My 16 month old baby ate it up. Quite good.

The oil is wrong--ingredient list says olive oil, but the correct veg oil is in the directions.  Yummy!  I used a dash of sugar, not whole tsp., but tasted nicely sweet thanks to the zucchini!  Definitely will make again!

These are amazing. I have not made zucchini pancakes since I made them for my son when he was a baby- 16 years ago. I forgot how tasty these are. I used applesauce instead of oil and added cinnamon, and nutmeg. Served with a side of applesauce, yummy.

Great recipe!  To make it more pleasing to my kids, I peeled the zucchini before grating it, subbed  applesauce for the oil, omitted the butter, and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter.  Huge hit with this mom and her kids!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  :-)

I have not had these myself but my 1yr old son devours them.  I have found that this is the only way I can successfully get him to eat vegetables.  Only changes I made were using only three eggs, substituting whole wheat flour for white, and adding a little cinnamon.

Delicious!!  My whole family enjoyed it...The first batch was perfect, had to turn down the heat on the second batch and it still burned a little.  That was more the fault of my stove - it's electric which I can't stand!!!  I have lots of zucchini in my garden, so this recipe will get used A LOT!!  YUM!!!!

I used at least 0.5 more zucchini than the recipe called for, so I ended up eye-balling the amount of flower. It turned out great, nonetheless. The only thing I will change next time is reduce baking poweder by half - you could really taste it with the amount called for. Also, as an alternative to butter, I brushed some sunflower oil on each panckake as I piled them up on the plate.

These pancakes are almost the best. I would like to add more flavoring like pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon. I would probably do half white and half whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of oil as was suggested earlier. The first time I used Bisquick, since I was camping and it worked well.  Definitely a must try.

Yumm!  Yumm!  The Zucchini Pancake addiction has run through my family.  This recipe is very forgiving.  If you like a little less fluff if your pancake cut the baking soda by 1/2.  I prefer these pancakes plain.  My husband prefers butter.  We skip the parmasean. Thank you William.

I tried these yesterday and thought them to be good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  We did not use the butter topping, rather ate them plain, as a side dish with a protein.

The only change I made was that I did not rub cooked pancakes with melted butter and I used canola oil instead of olive oil.  My husband is Italian and loves to fry zucchini flowers and he thought these were a good substitute.  I served these as a side dish at a BBQ, room temperature.  As for being bland, they taste just like regular pancakes, with zucchini added.  Had lots of compliments and was asked for recipe.

I made the 1st pancake and then added Parmesan to the batter to compare. Both were great, the cheese just made it more savory. I love Parmesan, but I think the pancakes were slightly better without it.  Since someone mentioned lack of flavor, I added fresh rosemary and chives, since I have those in my yard. These pancakes are perfectly fluffy. I did drain some of the water out of the zucchini just to make sure they weren't wet. This is a great recipe and it's easy to make. I think cooked onions would be good in it.

Perfect pancakes! They were delicious with butter, didn't prefer syrup, and did kind of like them with sour cream. I would make these as a side for dinner. I did notice that the 1/4 cup melted butter was not mentioned in the Directions. I added half to the batter and a little in the pan, serving the remainder  on the pancakes.

Great recipe that produces a fluffier style zucchini pancake. You can take the base ingredients and add your own spices and flavors. I decided to add grated  onion , crushed red plus both onion and garlic powder for added flavor. Hubby and I both agreed they would be a great substitute for biscuits when making biscuits and gravy!

It didn't say whether to drain liquid from zucchini, but don't drain.   It's not a sweet pancake and is more like a blini in

Basically a pancake with zucchini in it. Delicious served with honey. Not great if you are diabetic. Cook on a medium griddle so insides are done and outside are crisp -- about 2 - 3 minutes per side.

Made them in a pan instead of a grill and replaced the butter topping with grated cheese. The pancakes are very fluffy, but need a little more seasoning for my taste. Still a great and easy recipe :)

I split the batch- I left half of it the original way (minus the melted butter at the end), and the other half I doctored up with some cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, and a teaspoon of vanilla. We liked both versions,  ate them for breakfast with syrup. I call them "Monster Pancakes" for my 2 boys (they'll eat just about anything green if I label it as Monster first).

Have made these a few times now. Always use more zucchini than recipe suggests. Just made them using coconut oil instead of olive oil. Always serve with butter and maple syrup when pancakes are warm. But eat the leftovers plain. What  a great recipe!

I modified this recipe. I used applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, and I added some pumpkin pie spice.  I topped it with applesauce and cottage cheese and ate it as waffles for breakfast. My 10 month old son loved it too!

This is a decent recipe, nothing special--they taste just like pancakes with zucchini in it.  

If you want to make it more interesting you could easily make it savory (add onions, chives, green onion, other herbs) and serve it with salsa (that's what I ended up doing), or add something like cinnamon and serve it with syrup/fruit sauce.

Salty. Tasted like an omelet in my opinion. Neither my husband or I liked this recipe.

The pancakes were light but did not have great flavour, next time I will add either 2 tbsp finely chopped green onion or 2 tbsp finely chopped cilantro for some oomph to the flavour.  We also served them with green tomato chilli on the side, a tomato fruit salsa would also work well.

We loved this recipe and would give it 5 stars with the following tweaks: We are a gluten free family so I substituted gluten free flour blend for regular flour, decreased the oil to 2 TBSP, used 1-2 TBSP brown sugar instead of the white, added 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and fresh blueberries. For a more savory pancake use 1/2-3/4 cup chopped ham or bacon and 3/4 cup cheddar cheese. These measurements are approximate and can be changed for your preference. We serve both with a small amount of real maple syrup. Yum!

Awesome!! Added 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning, garlic powder, chopped onions and I can't wait until I pair them with my BBQ chicken & corn for dinner.  Next time I might try adding some TBs of green onion cream cheese!

Mine turned out salty, maybe I did something wrong. It was ok. I would make again to get rid of too much zucchini from my garden but would not go out and buy zucchini for the recipe.

My friend and I went out to a Turkish restaurant and we had zucchini pancakes for the first time.  I decided to try my hand at them tonight and used this recipe, but left out the sugar, and added about 1/2 of a good sized onion, grated, and a teaspoon or so of dill weed.  I mixed a couple cloves of minced garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon or so of dill weed to a half a cup of plain Greek yogurt (Fage is my favorite) for a dip.  They were delicious!! I'll definitely be making them again.

make it exactly as written but if you changed to:
3 tea. baking powder, 1 TABLESPOON sugar, and 1 tea. vanilla, and cinnamon, 
and coconut oil or applesauce instead of olive oil (and make it thinking it is a breakfast-style pancake, not a savory one) I think EVERYONE would rate this a 5 star!

Unsure how they would taste, I made these for dinner tonight.  Since some people said they tasted eggy, I actually left two out for a doubled batch.  I also omitted the sugar.  Following the suggestions of previous reviewers, we tried them with Parmesan cheese.  We also tried them with syrup.  Both were good.  My favorite was Parmesan and sausage.  One family member said they were best plain; another said they were no good plain.  :)

Easy, Quick, and Yummy !! (if you add a little more salt...)
I also used olive instead of vegetable oil, and added some shredded shallots and garlic

meh. Kinda bland, although the pancake was very fluffy. Like someone else said, more like a pancake than a latke. If I was to try this again I might use just egg white, whip them up, and make zucchini waffles instead of pancakes.

A wonderful alternative to cheese laden zuke dinner pancakes.  Fluff up nicely with an unexpected delicacy from a zuke dish: part omelet, part pancake.  Increased sugar to 1/4c. to make suitable for breakfast pancakes.  Kids loved 'em.  And...last but not least...a plausible way to use up extra zukes!

I added some cinnamon, a tsp of vanilla, changed the olive oil to veg oil, and blueberries.  20 month old ate it up.  Winning!

This is an easy way to feed zucchini to people who dislike it. These pancakes turn out tender and fluffy. This recipe however needs some improvements. There are too many eggs, so that is what you taste the most. And there is too much baking powder.

I was pleasantly surprised to find how good these pancakes are!  This recipe is low carb compared to standard breakfast pancakes and so much more healthy (I left the extra butter out)!  I baked them in my waffle iron and served them with fresh strawberries. Since fresh fruit is plentiful in the summer-time, next time I will serve them with multiple choice of other pureed fresh fruit and perhaps a dollop of whipped topping.  I will definitely keep this recipe!

Substituted 'white whole wheat' flour for the all-purpose flour, didn't use the melted butter.  Pretty good.

This recipe passed the preschooler test - my picky 3yo is wolfing down his pancakes as I type this. It's also delicious to adults, and I used whole wheat flour instead of white to make it a little bit healthier.

I just wish I hadn't only made a half batch!

Yummy! I used applesauce instead of oil, and added cinnamen and nutmeg to the mix. I topped mine with margarine and the kids added syrup. Everyone loved them, including my husband who doesn't care for zucchini. This is a definate keeper!
