This recipe was very easy and quick to make. I used the Buioni vodka sauce instead, and it turned out great! The artichokes add a really dynamic flavor and texture.

I loved this combination of ingredients. Didn't have Buitoni (sorry Buitoni!) but used regular cheese/spinach raviolis and prepared one of those pesto mix packets.  The artichoke, black olives and sun dried tomatoes go so well together.  Mixed in some fresh parm and grated some over the top. SO good!

Too salty and "canned" tasting. I added some diced tomatoes and served with Parmesan cheese. Maybe it would be better with fettuccine instead of a stuffed pasta?
