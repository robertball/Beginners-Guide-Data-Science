I don't know how the other guys handle the dough in this recipes, but I choose it anyway, despite the bad reviews because of the low fat content. Couple of tips for this recipes: 
1)Do not "overub-in" the butter.  Yes! please use butter for the flavour, instead of the margarine.
2)Make sure everything is extremely cold.
3)Do not knead the dough for more than 8-10 times, even when there are crumbs left behind, just pat them onto the dough when you shape it out on the cookie sheet.
4)Instead of cream of tartar and baking soda, add 2 tsps of baking powder.
I made many many scones before, but never ever cut any of them into circles as suggested in recipes.  Instead roll the dough out into a 6" circle and scour the circle into 6 triangles is my favourite method.

This is the only scone recipe you need!  These turn out perfect every time and they're not loaded with fat like some scones.  I make these with butter instead of margarine and I usually use 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2 (1/8 cup).  Good additions are 1 tablespoon of orange zest and dried cranberries or 1/2 cup frozen blueberries.

Finally!  The perfect scone recipe.  And easy.  Forget the creme recipes & stuff.  I substituted butter and baked at 450 for 12-15 minutes and added a tad more sugar.  Also- roll out thick because mine did not rise.  And I've added stuff in, like cranberries and orange, etc.  It's great- you'll love it.

These were quick and easy to make.  I had planned to add some blueberries, but when I saw the dough was pretty dense I was afraid they would get all broken up if I tried to mix them in.  I also decided to cut the scones into triangles.  I wasn't sure how much the scones would spread as they baked, and since they hardly spread at all, my triangles were too small.  BUT, they tasted great in spite of all this and I would definitely make them again.

Very good!  I made these for my Scottish friends and they loved them.  I added mini-chocolate chips to one batch and raspberry jam to another.  They took a little longer to bake than the recipe ways, but that could be my oven.

Very Delicious! I made first batch straight off of the recipe and it was perfect: light and airy scone, not heavy like others. Second time I made it I made 4 large scone: 1 plain, 1 with dried cranberries and almond slices, 1 with chocolate chips, and 1 with berry jam (a little wet, I added more flour) swirled in.

Thanks Angela! Very easy to make and a great basic scone.  I made mine with half whole wheat and butter. I think these are lighter than those at Tea & Sympathy, and therefore better for my diet. Of course those at T&S are a wonderful treat now and then!

Great recipe!  I'm half English and my grandmother used to make these all the time. If you want these to rise and be sure to use self-rising flour vs. all-purpose (still add the same amounts of cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt).  I used light butter instead of margarine.  If you want to make things easier, freeze the butter and then grate it with a cheese grater into the flour mixture.  Always use half and half.  You don't have to knead the dough very much and if you're not good at it, just spoon the mixture onto the parchment paper.  They'll bake up just like biscuits.

These were absolutely delicious! Very easy to make, too. I tried sprinkling some cinnamon and sugar on top before I baked them, and that came out quite well.

This recipe is exactly the same as one published by a cook at Buckingham Palace as the one used for the royal family.  I grew up in England in the 1950s, and that's the one we always used. Nobody would have dreamed of using butter - it was still rationed at the time, but I do use it now.  Although these scones seem bland and not very interesting to Americans, English people like them a lot, and they take very well to clotted cream and strawberry jam, for the traditional "cream tea" advertised in the windows of cottages in England.  They don't heat up well, so it's good to make just enough for one tea-time.  Have the butter very cold and cut it into tiny, tiny cubes (pea size or less) with two sharp knives.  Pour in the liquid all at once - the exact quantity is a matter of experience with your kind of flour, it should be just enough to bind the dough together.  You don't ever knead it: you sort of pat it together to encourage it to bind.  Then you pat it out thickly on your lightly floured board and cut the scones out with a two inch circle cutter or small glass dipped in flour.  Personally I bake them at 450 for about 10 minutes. I never had triangular scones in England.  This must b e a Scottish or Irish habit or something!
I was delighted to find thee old friends on allrecipes.  Thank you very much.

These are great!  I think I'll probably double the recipe next time since they went so fast.  I improvised a little by mixing strawberry jam in half the dough and chocolate chips in the the other... they came out great, and they're tastiest right out of the oven!

I tried these because there was less butter and plain milk, rather than the ones my mother taught me, with twice the butter, sour cream and lots more sugar.  However, these were very dry, tasteless and flat.  So very dissappointing.  I am surprised at the positive reviews.

I'm English and these scones are perfect! Didn't change a thing except you do need to add a little more more milk.  You definitely do not need to add more sugar as some reviewers suggested.  In the UK I would eat these with clotted cream and jam but clotted cream is difficult to get in the US so I serve them with real butter or heavy cream whipped until it's really thick and strawberry jam. Delicious!!

Really nice plain scones. I used butter and skim milk.  Dough was a bit dry so added a couple tablespoons more milk... so the baking soda would take off (like a Irish soda bread consistency). Work very fast or you'll loose some of the lightness.  Baked on parchment over the drip rack on my roasting pan which created even heat all around.  Tripled in height after about 12 minutes.  Jam & buttered this morning, but will serve with soup tonight.

They were very easy to make, even for a thirteen year old like myself. However I used butter instead of margarine like the recipe calls for. I have never had a scone before but what I made was good. I plan to suprise my parents with them when they come home.

I like this recipe very much.  My husband is from overseas and says it's pretty darn good.  I add currants to this recipe, not raisins, they are to big and to sweet.  This is great recipe.

Very nice! Light, fluffy, a hint of sweetness. I think people are crazy for saying you should double the sugar or add vanilla - these are scones, not cookies!

These are perfect, just like my mum makes and she was born in England! Made them with black currants.  It is hard to find a true scone in the US...the things they call scones are overly sweet baking powder biscuts.

Awesome and delicious! I've never tasted the scones from "Tea and Sympathy", but I'm sure that these beat them by a long mile. They are soft, fluffy, and have the best flavor! Try them, and I'm sure you'll be delighted!

I substituted four teaspoons of baking powder instead of baking soda, 3/4 teaspoon of salt instead of a pinch, 1/3 cup of white sugar instead of an 1/8, and 3/4 cup of cream instead of milk. I also added two tablespoons of shortening and one egg to mixture. I did not add the cream of tartar. I served them halved with strawberry jam and whipped cream. My version: 5 stars, this version: 3.

Bravo Angela! these were pretty amazing.
I´m a Londoner living in Spain, It´s not particularly easy to find scones in sunny spain, so I was over the moon to have found this recipe. Have made them twice, they kept well in an air tight container and tasted simply delicious. Got it all to be a keeper. Thanks for this great recipe.

These were pretty good--the first batch was a little bland, so I added some blueberries, spices, and buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Note: They don't spread, they just puff up, so keep that in mind when you're cutting/shaping them.  Also, better to underbak them than to overbake them.

Truly a great scone recipe, but PLEASE... replace the margarine with butter.  I think this really must be an error on the submitters part, because it is virtually impossible to make a true scone out of margarine.  My UK cousins would just say "EW" at the thought.  However, if you replace with butter and don't over-knead the dough, you should be fine.  Any crumbs that are left in the bowl, just pat on the scone.  Also, not sure where cutting them out with a bisquit cutter came from, but I generally do it the British/Scottish way and make a large 6" circle and score it in 'pie' pieces.  That is the only way I have ever seen them when I've been in the British Isles.  Granted, there are the 'factory' scones that are in shapes, but ... just sayin'...

So not my favorite. They were an odd texture and had a funny after taste that I attribute to the cream of tartar. I'll not even try this recipe again.

Wow, what a light, airy scone.  Bakes up beautifully and have a wonderful texture. I took the advice of someone else here, and used 3T sugar instead of two and the hint of sweetness (along with a little sprinkled on the milk-washed top) was a perfect accompaniment to my cup of coffee. :) I made my scones triangle, and ended up getting 8 "normal size" (not like Starbuck's gigantic things) scones.  I also added some withering fresh blueberries from my fridge, and they cooked beautifully in the dough.  Just folded them in last minute.  Because my oven runs a little hot, I cooked these at 400 degrees for 12 minutes and they turned out perfect.  There is no need for any other scone recipe.  I'm going to try mini choc chips/chopped pecans next!

Having spent the last 12 yrs. in England, I found these scones very authentic in tast & texture. The brits often like to add currents. The traditional shape is a large circle (not triangles), serve with jam,thick whipped cream & a cup of strong, milky tea and you'll experience a true "English afternoon tea"! I brought them to my son's 3rd grade class for his heritage project, the kids loved them w/the jam & thick cream!! Thanks.

This is the best recipe for easy scones! My scones always turned out like rock cakes that didn't rise, not now. I used 2tsp cream of tartar,1tsp baking soda and 1/2cup of milk. I also used "Splenda" low cal sweetner instead of sugar to make it diabetic friendly. Don't over mix and lightly knead (5 times)Position high in the oven and the cooking time is 15 minutes for perfect scones.I also added sultanas to one batch by pressing them into the dough before i cut them into rounds. Delicious!!!

This was a great recipe, and really easy to prepare.  My husband who has been to the UK several times claimed that they tasted authentic.  The only thing I did differently was instead of cutting out the rounds I separated the dough in half and shaped each half into a large circle - 3/4 inch thick.  Then cut them like a pie into six slices each and baked them that way.  They looked more like the typical scone and baked perfectly.  Again, great recipe - thanks!

After a failed first attempt (Uk users be aware that baking soda is NOT baking powder but Bicarbonate Of Soda ) we tried again. This time the results were fantastic and having just tried one with butter and jam i am amazed at the lightness of these excellently easy to create scones. My thanks to the author

Super quick and easy with ingredients I had in stock on a snow day!  Mixed it up in a food processor, followed other recommendations to add 3 TB sugar.  I kneaded in dried cherries and white chocolate chips at the end, and patted it out into a 12 inch circle, then cut into wedges and baked as directed.  They rose a little but didn't really spread out.  Perfect, light texture!

This recipe is foolproof, easy and the scones turned out beautifully.  My husband is English and woke up wanted English scones so I whipped up a batch and he gave them his (very picky) seal of approval.  I used butter rather than margarine and we served them with butter and strawberry jam.  Yum!

This is a fast and easy recipe that I use all the time.  Serve the scones with a nice jam, otherwise they will be too plain.  This recipe even works well with canola oil instead of butter, no milk glaze, and sometimes I roll cinnamon or raisins into the dough, and that works well too.  I love it how these scones are plain, and not at all like the fatty, sugary, and overloaded scones I see in many coffee shops.

I loved this recipe.  As everyone else does, made a few modifications.  Added 1/4 c. sugar.  Sometimes add cranberries & orange zest, other times add mini choc chips.  Didn't roll out - divided into 12 sections and rolled each into a ball.  Slightly flattened to 3/4" and baked.  Drizzled with glaze.  My kids LOVE these!

It's really good! I personally like plain scones. I did have to use about 1/2 C more milk for a soft dough and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also used butter.  Just in general whenever a recipe calls for shortening I use butter.  I've also made lemon and blueberry scones with this recipe. I add the zest of one lemon and 2 C fresh blueberries. It's a great base for different kind of scones.

Just like the scones from that coffee place on every street corner but not so dry! I used a little more sugar in the dough, patted it into a circle about 3/4 inch thick right on the parchment paper, scored the circle into 8 wedges (cut almost all the way through), brushed generously with milk and sprinkled with white sugar. Took about 12 minutes in my oven to get the nice light light golden around the outside. Transferred the whole circle to a wire rack, cooled a bit then "broke" the wedges out for a beautiful scone that tastes really good with jam. My 3 1/2 year old son loves them!

I made these scones for my British grandmother for Christmas breakfast and she RAVED!  The rest of my family enjoyed them with clotted cream and jam (from Tea and Sympathy) and they were perfect...not heavy and dense like some scones I've had, but light, tender, soft, and delicious.  Thanks from my grandmother (who said she never could make a good scone, and now can with your recipe) and me.

I have to laugh a bit at the reviews complaining that the lack of milk and butter in this recipe make these scones "too dry."  Well... that's a genuine British scone: dry. You eat them with tea.  This recipe is really perfect nearly-as-is (USE BUTTER, NOT MARGARINE). The texture is nice and light, with a perfect crumb.  Just keep an eye on them in the oven or they really will be too dry.  My own oven can be unpredictable being a gas oven, so while I time them per the recipe I still keep an eye on the color to be a nice light golden.

I've never made scones before, and I'm not that great at baking. I followed the recipe almost exactly- I forgot to brush the scones with milk, and I needed a little more than 1/2 a cup of milk in the dough- and these came out wonderfully light and tender on the inside! They take so little time to do. Great recipe and lots of potential for add-ins. Perfect!

Absolutely perfect. Light, slightly sweet, and the perfect size and texture. I followed the recipe with the exception of the Cream of Tartar, which I did not have available. Simply wonderful scones.

These scones are really good. I was surprised because they use less butter than the scone recipe I normally use, but they were quite good anyway. 
Note: I found I had to use a tiny bit more milk than the amount given.

These are a little dry, even for scones.  Definitely want to be served warm and softened in tea.  But they rise beautifully in the oven and have a lovely texture.

Please use butter rather than margarine!  Cutting back on sugar as previously suggested is best unless you have a real sweet tooth!

Okay, I would've given it a 3, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt because I modified. I was looking for a basic scone recipe I could add coconut and chocolate chips to, and chose this one based on sweetness and reviews.  I added 1/2 cup of sweetened shredded coconut and 1/3 cup choc chips, used 3 tsp baking powder rather than baking soda/cream of tartar (three because I was subbing in whole wheat white flour and it's just a bit heavier plus with the coconut I wanted to make sure of a good rise... it seemed to be the right amount as they rose as much as any scone I've made.) I also used a couple of pinches of sea salt rather than one pinch. Of course I used butter, and I also used some half and half to increase the wetness factor for the coconut.  The scones are "okay." They're kind of dry and boring, but okay.   I've used other recipes in the past with much better success. There's one that just takes cream from my Beard on bread book I think.  I couldn't find that book this morning and was in a hurry so I chose this recipe from the site because it wasn't very sweet and when you're adding sweetened coconut and chocolate chips you don't want your dough very sweet.  Like some others I had to add more than a half cup of milk to make a dough even though I had already added a bit of half and half to compensate for the coconut sucking up some of the liquid.   Anyway, moist on the inside but the outside was too dry; I didn't brush with milk but I've never had to before...

I just made a batch of these scones and they're fantastic! mmm yum! :) The only thing I'd note is that the dough was pretty dry so I had to add an extra half cup of water in order to make it malleable. Also added raisins and an egg wash instead of the milk glaze. Delicious!

Great authentic recipe!  I usually stir in craisins or golden raisins but this recipe is is good enough on its own.

I made it with butter since I didn't have margarine (plus since I'll eat these over 6 meals I figured that less than a slice of butter worth of fat per meal would be fine).  The only suggestion I would make is to bake a little longer than suggested--mine could have used another 2 minutes since they were a little too soft and doughy in the center.  Otherwise these were wonderfully yummy and I was impressed by how quick they were to make and how low in fat they were compared to my better homes and gardens cookbook recipe!

This is the recipe I have been looking for for years! They look great and taste great. I used butter. I had to add almost a cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup to make a soft dough. Oh, and I used a baking stone instead of parchment.

These are awesome.  The only thing I did different was replace the margarine with butter and increased the sugar to 1/4 cup.  My husband is a scone addict and would always buy them at Starbucks.  Now he won't even give those ones a second glance.

I've been living in England for a little while now, and I decided it was time to learn to make these. This recipe is perfect! They taste just like what I've been getting over here. I added some frozen blueberries to mine. It was a little messier and I had to work fast, but they really are tasty. It also helps to use chilled butter, cut it into cubes, and use your hands to mix it in.
 Thanks for this recipe!

Great recipe. I did not roll the dough out. Inside I rolled the dough into balls with my hands and placed on the cookie sheet. The scones turned out great.

I made these exactly as written, except with butter instead of margarine, and they were delicious. No need to add sugar, no need for clotted cream or jam -they were delicious "as is."  A great economical snack for the kids. Make sure you sift the dry ingredients and don't handle the dough any more than absolutely necessary. And eat them warm.

These scones turned out great! I made them for a tea party and everyone loved them. I sprinkled a little sugar on top when they came out of the oven to give them a little sparkle. If you're looking for a good basic scone, this is the recipe!

What a disappointment!  This are bland and boring. The cooking time of 10 minutes needed to be doubled and I had to add more liquid. I used butter for the flavor-but there was none. This recipe is aptly named...basic to say the least.

Delicious, and SO easy to make.  I used soy milk instead of regular milk and they still turned out oh-so-fluffy and good.  I cut them into tringles though, which worked better and they turned out quite pretty.  :)  I threw everything in a mixer, which worked well, and topped it with lemon curd.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a super easy breakfast recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

These scones were small, flat, and without much flavor. I live in the UK and go out for tea and scones often. These tasted more like Bisquick biscuits. They are nothing compared to a real British scone. I doubt they compare to something in NYC either.

These scones are light and fluffy. However, I made the following changes as other reviewers recommended- I used a half and half of cream and milk, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder instead of cream-of-tartar and baking soda, split the batter into four parts and made many different fillings/toppings. I made-- rainbow sprinkles with caramel buttercream, peanut bu

These are so good and so easy! I miss scones now I live in NY and this recipe makes absolutely delicious scones! The only issue is that this recipe only makes 6 scones, not 12, or maybe I'm just making them too big?? My American husband loves these too. I eat them with my own homemade strawberry jam and I'm still trying to locate a good way to make clotted cream.

So easy and so good!  I substituted King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour and still got light, fluffy scones.  I also upped the sugar but WOULD NOT do so again - I like a less-sweet scone.  I also added chopped cranberries and apricots for that little "surprise" of sweet.  Will become a standard in my repertoire!

These were just ok.  But I don't know if this would be a fair review or not because this is on my change.  I used soy milk instead of regular milk.  Other recipes I've made such substitutions have been fine, so not sure if it made a difference here.

I'm sorry, but these scones were quite terrible. I followed exactly at 10 minutes and they came out raw. There's just too much flour and not enough butter and sugar. I ended up throwing away the entire batch. I just don't understand the rave reviews....

maybe I did something wrong, but these were more like crunchy biscuits than scones. I think next time I am going to not flatten them out and try to make the biscuit thicker and not not cook very long.

I Loved making these!!! They were SO easy and yummy that I make them often!! I like to make my cookies and muffins smaller, so for these scones I cut them out using a little medicine cup. They turned out really cute. I also split a batch I made and put butterscotch chip in half, and chocolate chips in the other!! Talk about good!!

My 9 year old daughter and I made these.  So easy. I used 1/2 stick frozen butter (instead of margarine) and grated it on a large hole cheese grater. I didn't have to do a thing but gently mix the butter and flour mixture together with my fingers.  Added 1/4 c sugar because we like them a little sweeter.  Sprinkled them with sugar after brushing the milk on top.  I cut them into larger wedges  so we had to bake them for about 12 minutes (turning 1/2 way through).  Next time I think I will add a little lemon zest to brighten them up a bit.  Thanks.

I cut these into the triangle shapes I'm used to for scones, and these turned out yummy.  A little too simple for my taste, but still very good.

I am sorry, but these scones were a real disappointment. I was making these for my boyfriend's birthday breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly, baking for ten minutes at 220 C, and they came out completely raw. I also agree with the other reviewers who said the recipe didn't call for enough sugar. I live in London and am used to scones that are not too sweet, but these were bland and salty.

Good. I am very inexperienced with Scones but these were fairly easy. I did add a little bit more milk. I rolled out my dough too thin so I cut some in strips, put chopped walnuts between & covered with another strip. Next time I will add blueberries.

I had a little accident with the milk, adding a bit too much so that the dough was too wet and gooey to roll out. Instead, I dropped 1/4 cupfuls onto the baking sheet. And it STILL came out tasting wonderful! Slightly crispy on the outside and light, airy, and moist on the inside! A recipe that can stand a few mistakes and still turn out is definitely a keeper! :)

I agree with MSFLISS on the "scones, not cookies" bit.  I made the recipe as stated, except for using butter instead of margarine and thought they were perfect.  Just a hint of sweetness, and light and airy and delish.

This recipe is fabulous!  I've never been able to make decent biscuits, but these scones just popped right up like nobody's business.  I think I put in a bit of extra sugar because I didn't have a 1/8 c measure and had to eyeball it.  The scones came out perfect--not too sweet and not too bland.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use a bigger cookie cutter, I think they would be better if they were about 4" in diameter.

It is very good the way it is, but I have found that by adding a half cup of rasins and sprinkling a pinch of sugar over them before baking makes them delightful.

These were great!  Light, fluffy, just slightly sweet.  I added a bit more milk than the recipe said because I like the dough to be soft and sticky (they tend to turn out better that way).  I can't wait to try some variations - orange and cranberry, currants, etc.

The perfect companion to a cup of tea! Very easy. I made them exactly as directed, and they turned out perfectly. I almost added more milk, as the dough looked very dry, but after kneading it for a moment, it was just right.

I don't have a lot of experience making scones but this recipe is easy to follow and it turns out fantastic. It is way better than the one other recipe I've tried. It's easy to add in other ingredients to make them different flavors. I'm so glad I found this recipe!

I made a slightly denser, whole wheat, bran and real butter version (see custom versions). This recipe as-is is really good but i would encourage cutting in the shortening as for pie crust, and using butter. Coconut oil is a good vegan substitute for butter.  Also standard recipe took my oven 15 minutes.

Wonderful!  I followed other reviewers' advice ans used half white flour, half wheat, subbed baking powder for the soda and cream of tartar, subbed butter for margarine, and flattened the entire dough into a 1/2" thick circle before cutting into wedges.  Baked perfectly and reheated well.  I might try letting the dough rest a few minutes before baking next time.

Really good scones, and really easy to make. We followed the suggestion to add an extra tablespoon of sugar, but I think it still needs some more sweetness.

These came out fantastic! I changed the recipe a bit. Used organic whole wheat bread flour and butter. Also added currents until it looked like enough. They rose more than my last scone adventure and are fluffier inside too! Will use this recipe from now on...

This recipe is a keeper for me!  After years of attempting to make scones and failing miserably because they didn't rise or were too dry and bland, I've finally found a great British scone recipe!  Being from England, I was always striving to find that perfect scone texture, moisture, and rising factor.  Now I need to look no more!  I added some sultana raisins to the mix and had to bake them a couple of minutes longer than stated on the recipe probably due to the high altitude where I live. I added milk chocolate chips for the batch I made for the kids and they loved them.  I like to plonk on some strawberry jam and cream and they are simply divine.  Even my hubby is amazed that I've finally made some scones that rise and don't resemble cookies in appearance!  I must confess I've just finished gobbling one up for my breakfast!  Thanks for the recipe Angela!!

I used butter (of course!) and a little vanilla. I shredded the butter on and barely kneaded it adding an extra TBSP of milk or so. I patted the dough into a round and cut it into 8 wedges. I have to say I was very pleased. I probably won't use another scone recipe.

This recipe was SO easy and fast.  I didnt have any cream of tartar so I substituted baking powder for the tartar and baking soda per someone else's suggestion.  I would add a little more sugar, perhaps some raw sugar on top before baking?  These were lovely fresh out of the oven on this snowy day with a cup of tea!  Enjoy!

Super simple,quick and versitile. I added 1tsp.ground cinnamin and a small handful of raisens. Its also nice to sprinkle cinnamin sugar or sift confectioners sugar on top. I plan to experiment with different ingriedients.

Everyone loved them and I will need to double the recipe. They didn't last the day in our home.

Made these today to go with lemon curd off this site.  Very tasty scones!  I am rating 4 just because I had to add another 1/4 cup milk just to get the dough to come together, but other than that this was very good and I didn't change other ingredients.  Shaped into round and scored to bake, so it took longer to cook, but my fault and not recipe.  These rose beautifully and had a really great texture.  Will definitely make again!

These scones were delicious! We cooked them a little bit longer to get a nice golden brown color, but overall the recipe worked very well. Especially with Crab Apple Jelly! :]

I added cinnamon and raisins and these were quite good.  They are not very sweet, but very tasty.  I would suggest making them larger than 2" rounds.

I've never had an actual English scone, but these turned out great for me! I made them plain to serve underneath a homemade strawberry topping! I did add 1/8 teaspoon ea. of vanilla and cinnamon, for my own touch. I cut them about 3" diameter and smooshed a slight bowl in the middle to hold some of the strawberries.  Pretty danged good :)

This recipe was great! The only change that I made was adding more milk (about 1/2 cup), adding about 1 cup of dried cranberries and the zest from one medium/large size orange. The dough was a little too sticky because of too much milk so sprayed my palms with non-stick spray, rolled the dough into rounds, and flatted them on the baking sheet. 10 minutes was perfect! I will definitely make these again! Also, I served with butter and strawberry jam which made them deeelish!

I love this recipe, but I throw caution to the wind & use real butter.  :)  They are so fast to make.  Even though there are recipes specifically for the addition of berries & such, I just add dried cranberries to this recipes towards the end.  They taste best when they are still warm.  I have added them to many tea parties over the years.

These were really delicious -- not too sweet, like most scones I've tried.  I added 2/3 cups of coarsely chopped walnuts and a tsp. of orange zest (about one orange).  I also swapped out the extra two tablespoons of milk for orange juice.  The scones were so good, and came out just like they were supposed to.

Amazing basic scone recipe!  I added about 1/2 a cup more sugar and some lemon zest for wonderful blueberry scones.  I used this recipe again, following it exactly for ham and cheese scones.  This is the best foundation for any scone you can imagine!  Thanks so much, I will use it again and again!

I made this recipe last night, no need to say they were all gone by lunch the next day. Delicious and seems very versatile. For this first time I added 1/8 tsp. cinnamon, a pinch of nutmed, a little bit of vanilla, half a cup of raisins. I pressed the dough into a big circle between 1/2 and 3/4 inches thick and cut it in triangles that I subdivided in smaller bites. It required more cooking than the recipe mentionned ; about 15 minutes in my oven.

I will definitely make more for friends and family on the next occasion!

These were the best scones I have had since I live in England over 10 years ago!  To all those "scone" lovers out there these are about the closest you can get to a real English Scone without flying to England to have one.  Thank you for the great recipe!

My husband loves these scones, and he is a tough critic.  I've made them several times with perfect results each time, and I tried a small variation on these today which worked out wondefully!  I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the dry ingredients, and used 1/4 C. of brown sugar in place of the white sugar.  Made a lovely caramel colored scone, which tastes divine.

Very tasty, Very easy and Very quick! I used a tad more sugar and needed a bit more milk and they were perfect. I put them in mini muffin tins instead of cutting them out. they fluffed up very nicely! (do not over knead the dough or it will be tough and flat). My little girls loved them for their tea party.

Now THIS is a good British scone! It is simple and delicious, just the right scone to have with the traditional clotted cream and strawberry jam. I also use this very recipe for strawberry shortcake by splitting the warm scones and layering them with sliced strawberries that have been macerated in sugar and heavy cream that has been whipped with a little sugar and vanilla extract -- delicious.

These were easy and fun to make, and came out very well. I added a little more milk than the recipe said to. I cut 2" diameter circles, and made 35 altogether. They were delicious with honey on them.

PEFECT recipe to go with homemade lemon curd and homemade whipped cream. Not to heavy, not too sweet.  I did double the recipe and I added pecans to one and dried cranberries to the other. I was a hit at our "ladies tea". My boys begged me to make more so they could have some.

This is THE best scone recipe I have ever tried. It's so simple and moist, for me they didn't come out dry at all (though a little crumbly, but in a good way). I first tried them in school, because my cooking teacher picked this recipe out for us to try. We didn't really know what "cream of tartar" was and if we have that here in Sweden, so I've always skipped it and the scones have been perfect every single time anyway! Thanks so much for this recipe, it's the best!

I make these scones frequently, and they go quickly in our house! They are delicious, and not dissimilar to scones we pick up regularly when back in the UK. I actually prefer cutting them into triangles, but my husband still likes the rounded biscuit shape, so we do them both ways.

I tried this.  Mmmmm....  My sister-in-law is from England.  These are as close to hers as I can get.  Soo good.  The recipe said to use 1/2 cup milk to get a soft dough.  No way that was happening.  I had to add about 1/4 to 1/3 cup more milk, but it was still delicious.  I made these 2 nights ago and am getting ready to make them again. Change the recipe? Why mess with perfection?  (Did you noticed that I like this one?)

I also didn't have Cream of Tarter on hand so used baking powder.  Used my pastry blender to work in the butter (don't use margarine) and it worked just fine.  Definitely a keeper.

I have been baking scones for many, many years, but finding this recipe was wonderful.  Best scones I ever made.  I did not have cream of tartar so I substituted one teaspoon of baking powder instead of the soda and cream of tartar.  Super yummy.

This is makes a delicious and flaky scone! 

I stumbled upon this recipe while trying to find one for blueberry scones with no heavy cream. This recipe served as the perfect base for improvisation. I replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour (fiber!), added an additional tablespoon of sugar, replaced the milk with almond milk (lactose intolerant) and added a heaping 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries. I had to double the baking time since I may have made my scones a little large, but the end result was delicious, flaky, slightly sweet blueberry scones! Add a bit of Earth Balance buttery spread on top and you've got breakfast.

Made exactly as written except with butter rather than margarine. Really not good. Flavorless. Where's the egg? It's needed for lightness. No sweetness -  I know scones should not be too sweet so you can put your clotted cream and jam on, but these were awful leaden weights we ended up throwing out to the birds.

This was my first time baking from 'scratch' and it came out better than i expected! only thing i did differently was use 'craisins' and sprinkled sugar over the top before i put it in the oven. one mistake i made was leaving a bit of flour on the bottom before i put it in which kind-of gave it a slight powdery taste. besides that, really easy, fun and tastes great! THANKS!

I threw this all in my kitchen aid at the same time, mixed it, kinda rolled it out and cut them. They are AWESOME! I brushed them with butter and milk at the end! AWESOME!

Very good, basic scone recipe. I won't use baking paper again though---all my gorgeous scones were completely stuck! Next time I'll butter the sheet instead. We ate these "Devonshire style", with freshly whipped cream & strawberry jam. Delicious!

This was a very good basic recipe to play with.I made them very thick and cooked 12 minutes. Light layered texture. Followed to a T this time and had with a stew. Next time will do with some white chocolate and cranberries for a simple dessert.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it many times now.  I used cream with a little milk and they turned out very yummy.  They are not sweet at all.  I've made lemon curd to go with them and it was a hit.  I've also added dry cranberries and fresh blueberries.  Delish!!

These were okay. I think that with some tweaking, they could be better. I would make them again, but next time I would make a double recipe, roll the dough a little thicker, and use a bigger cutter to yield larger scones. I would also add a little more sugar.

We loved these, but I did add some ingredients to make them a little more "fun".  I halved the batch and made one with chocolate chips.  To the other one, I added cinnamon, nutmeg, white chocolate chips and finely crushed walnuts.  My daughters and husband liked them and called them "breakfast cookies".

Wow these were great! I used the exact ingredients and they came out perfect. One thing i would suggest is to use a slightly bigger cutter like a 2 and a half inch instead of a 2 since they were quite small. Its a good recipe so i'll be making these again.

These were great! I didn't have any cream of tartar, so I substituted triple the amount lemon juice to give the recipe enough acid and worked out fine. Absolutely delicious, and such an easy recipe... especially if you opt to skip the rolling out and just shape little pucks by hand ;-)

Yummy!  This is my first time making scones.  I doubled the batch and substituted half of the flour with whole wheat graham flour.  A little coffee shop that I love makes these with diced dried apricots and white chocolate chips.  I made half of them with the diced apricots, but didn't have any white chocolate.  These are superb and don't need any extra sugar.  They are not supposed to be like cookies.  The other half I added frozen raspberries.  This made the dough a little harder to work with because it made it a little more moist, but these also turned out wonderful!  Also, I didn't have any parchment paper, but used a silicone baking mat that I have.  Thank you so much for this great recipe!  This is a keeper!

This was a very easy, very tasty recipe.  I actually used a cookie cutter and made cute little shapes of my scones and people loved them. I added lemon zest about a 1/2 cup more sugar so they were slightly sweeter.

Needed more sugar, maybe double.  Otherwise, quite bland.  Or add raisins and currants.  I only added 1/4 cup currants, but it still wasnt sweet. And maybe I'll add Vanilla next time, as suggested.

I changed the milk to make these vegan.  I also doubled the sugar and added vanilla following other suggestions here.  They are just fabulous!!!  My whole family just devoured a double batch and are asking for more NOW!!  Recommend highly, you won't be disappointed.  We also used cookie cutters and made shapes which turned out well.

This was a great recipe for a scone.  They are wonderful!  To make mine sweeter, i used 1/4 cup sugar and added vanilla extract. You can use anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 of a teaspoon of the vanilla.  I also mixed some vanilla with the milk to brush on top of it before baking and sprinkled sugar on top to give it a nice golden brown finish.

Great traditional scone recipe!  I added 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/8 to give it more sweetness.  I only got 9 out of the recipe instead of 12, but overall it's fantastic!  I tried it with cream and homemade lemon curd and they were divine!  Light and fluffy - thanks for the recipe!  I will be serving them at our church Mother's Day tea.

These are alright, but true British scones are sweeter and fluffier. I halved the recipe, and ended up with 5 rather small, thin scones. I will probably make these again but will add more sugar, and will aim to make 10 thick scones using the stated recipe.

These were fabulous!  Loved them, loved them!  Crispy on the outside and so very soft and fluffy on the inside.  I am a sweet tooth but I count calories, so I substituted the sugar for 1 cup of Splenda and used Country Crock with Yogart spread.  I didn't have cream of tartar, so used 4 teaspons of baking powder in place of that and the baking soda.  I also added some frozen blueberries.  They were really wonderful!  And barely a 100 calories each!

This was a fair recipe. It was very easy to make, because I did not roll out the scones and cut them, instead I dropped them into a mini-muffin pan. They tasted alright, but a bit  bland, and heavy. If I ever make these again I will use more sugar.

Very good, much like an original English scone. I rolled the dough out a bit too thin so my scones were not very thick.  I will try rolling the dough next time to about 3/4 inch.

I was looking for an easy scone to serve with supper.  These were delish, but required a bit more milk than the recipe called for.  The kids loved them, and ate up ate extras for a bedtime lunch.  I will definitely make these again!!

I'm reviewing how these little jewels turned out, and not the recipe itself, because I made some changes.  I found that 1/2 of milk was not enough.  So,  after adding at least 1 cup of milk (versus the 1/2 cup) I added about 1/2 cup of vanilla greek yogurt.  That was probably too much because the dough was somewhat  wet.  But, with a little of flour, it was perfect.  I also used salted butter, not margarine.  And, I also added 1 tsp vanilla, some apricots, walnuts and chocolate chips.  I really really loved these and will love them with coffee in the mornings to get the metabolism going.  This one is a keeper, in my opinion. 

 I know I know...why didn't you try the original recipe instead of making changes right away?  Because I didn't like how dry the mixture was and I wanted to make sure these were a little sweeter and had more texture.

They came out light, tasty, great recipe. I cut a piece of frozen butter to make that 1/4 cup and ran it over a box grater, (makes nice even bits a butter through the flour). Please use some good butter in this recipe; makes a difference.

Really simple and easy recipe. Just the right texture and sweetness. I tweaked the recipe a little by using butter instead of margarine and adding frozen blueberries to the dough. The recipe yielded about 8 med/small-sized scones. Baking time was about 16 minutes, not 10. Highly recommend!!!

Came out very nice, I rolled them a bit too thin but they still cut in half for cream and jam. I did have some issues getting it to create a ball and feel like I used more milk than recommended but overall I was very happy with the results.

This is the perfect recipe for your first venture into British scones. You will make your own adjustments but here are my own tips gained after twice using the recipe and turning out perfect scones the second time.
1) I read several comments that instead of 1/2 cup milk use 1 cup. I found 3/4 cups to be adequate.
2) Because there is milk in the dough, skip the end part that suggests brushing the top with milk. The high 220C or  425F heat called for will brown the tops quickly so no need to brush with milk. When finished, I brush the tops with butter for a golden look.
3. I happened to have only self-raising flour this morning and used 2 cups of this with the baking soda required and it is much better than all purpose flour! Try it!
4. With the high heat, it really takes less than 10 minutes so don't leave them too long and look in after 5 minutes.
5. The first time I did this, I used less than the sugar required and no salt and it tasted like cardboard. So I followed the  required 2 tablespoons (1/8th cup) of sugar and added a bit more and added the salt sprinkled all over the flour. Much improved!
6) I don't know what the cream of tartar does but it does give perfect scones!

Loved it! Light and nice-not sweet, just right for me. I didn't have cream of tartar so I used only baking powder. Will try it again with cream of tartar and baking soda to see how it goes.

Absolutely PERFECT.  Not like the Starbucks version of thispastry....covered in glaze and topped with obscene amounts of sugar! Add some dried fruit for the perfect breakfast pastry.  These were enormously popular with my coworkers.  They lasted no more than 5 minutes total.

I made these with a gluten free all purpose cup for cup replacement flour, unsweetened almond milk, and vegan butter substitute. I replaced the white sugar with turbinado sugar because I like the crunch. I was out of baking soda, so I omitted the cream of tartar and just used 3 tsp of baking powder. They still turned out AMAZING.

Great recipe!  I added the juice and zest of one orange, reserving a little of the juice to add on top before cooking and sprinkling with sugar. I also added about a half cup of dried cranberries. They were amazing.

This recipe is perfect. Every other recipe I looked up was a lemonade or lemon-lime soda scone and I just wanted a basic traditional scone. This recipe is great, I followed it exactly, but only used margarine due to a shortage in butter.. hey, i needed butter on top more than in the bread. I will definitely try butter next time. Butter will be purely for personal preference, as using margarine still produced a superb basic scone. My husband loved it. My English father-in-law will be proud.

This was a good scones recipe for when you do not have sour cream or heavy cream in the house. I used 2 tsp of baking powder instead of the cream of tarter and baking soda and substituted butter for the margarine. Next time I'd try adding orange zest, cranberries, chocolate chips, or frozen blueberries.

This is a great version of the british scone. It is meant to be round and not triangular like a previous reviewer suggested. I agree that you could substitute baking powder for cream of tartar.

I made this vegan by using 2.5 teaspoons of baking powder instead of tarter and baking soda. I also did 1/2 wheat flour and used almond milk instead of milk and veg  shortening instead of butter. It was super tasty! a great low sugar breakfast treat!

These scones were pretty good - not a dry scone. My kids sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them before baking which added some flavor.

This is a wonderfully yummy recipe.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and doubled the sugar and added 1/4 tsp. vanilla....I can't wait to try some of the other variations suggested!!!

I have made this scone many times and every time, I get compliments, even my six year old niece loves it.  I use the same recipe using extra old cheddar sometimes and it is a nice mix in flavour with the strong cheese and sugar. yum.

so delicious. they taste so good, i can't believe they're as healthy as they are.

if you are a poor college student and do not have parchment paper, just grease and flour a cookie sheet. they didn't stick at all. and if you want to add chocolate chips or blueberries, try mixing them in before you add the milk.

I just bakes these, and they turned out wonderful. I did not add anything, like berries, fruit, spices or chocolate; they are great as is; but you certainly can with this basic recipe. Thank you very much, this is exactly what I was looking for.

This recipe is great.  I make it with a bit of vanilla stirred in and turbinado sugar sprinkled on the top.  Especially good with clotted cream!
