My Family loved it.  Probably not the healthiest breakfast, but perfect for a special day.  I made mine with home made baking powder biscuits.  I didn't bother to cut them up into biscuit shapes, I just pulled the dough apart into rough clumps about 1/2 the size of my fist before I put them into the sugar and cinnamon mix.

Have made this a couple of times now for dessert. First time I made the day before. Taste was good but were flat (didn't rise). Second time I made the night of and MUCH better! As my Dad said - "these little suckers are quite addicting"!

This makes an appetizing coffee cake that is perfect with your morning coffee.  Because my apples were small, I ended up using three, and chopped them in  ½” pieces.  I baked it in a round ceramic dish that was buttered to keep the round shape.  Take extra care in removing the cake from the pan as mine was prone to fall apart.

This is so easy. All it needs is some vanilla ice cream on the side and your off to the races.

Definitely will make again!  I followed the recipe and the cinnamon sugar I had left in the ziplock bag, I poured onto the biscuits before the butter sauce.  Tasted great.

This was really quick and easy. I wasn't exact with the ingredients but close - made it a few hours ago and it is almost gone so I believe it's a keeper. Would be great in the mornings with coffee. Will surely make these No Fry Apple Fritters again. Thanks You Born To Cook.

I made 2 of these for breakfast this morning. Because we're trying to limit sugar, I used only half the amount called for and used 3 apples from our tree for the two "cakes" and they still turned out great! I also reduced the butter by 1/3 and I forgot to add the vanilla extract. I'm sure it would've enhanced the recipe, but they came out fine without it. Next time I won't forget to add it! Thanks for this great dish. It was wonderful with scrambled eggs. My mom, kids & grandkids all loved it!!!!!

My husband loved these. He usually buys apple fritters from Dunkin Donuts, but he liked these so much, he ate them instead! I don't usually make things that he likes, so I'm really excited that this recipe was easy to do and he really liked it.

I used a can of Grands, three apples, and left out the pecans, but otherwise followed the recipe. I was a little disappointed that the biscuits didn't rise even a little bit, so I wound up with a pile of cinnamon sugar coated biscuits with apples, but it DID taste good! Not remotely anything resembling any apple fritter I've ever heard of, but it was enjoyed just the same.
