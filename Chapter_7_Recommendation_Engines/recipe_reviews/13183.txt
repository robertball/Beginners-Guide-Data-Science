As a retired test kitchen chef, I am bound to dabble.  So after reading all the reviews, I set to work to make a lower fat version and still maintain taste.  I had researched the Top Secret version and felt I could even drop fat content on that one too.

1.  I used hot italian turkey sausage.  Yes it came in links, but I squeezed out the meat and cooked it.  Then roll in paper towels to get out any remaining fat.  

2.  Bacon and Onion should be cooked separately, then blended in at the last minute to meld flavors.
3. I dropped the water content, got rid of the cream and used entirely fat free half and half from the dairy section. Brilliant stuff and works well in this recipe.  Smooth, rich, not too thin consistency

4.  Some brave souls prefer to add pepper at this point, but I say "to taste"

5.  I prefer the texture of Youkon Gold potatoes, but any young new potato with the skins on is great.  If you like earthy, you can use russets.  I have never been a fan of dirt so I stick with thin skins.

So play, enjoy!  And don't forget the Romano!

Excellent recipe. I have made this so many times here is what I have changed:

Cook the bacon separately from the onions to avoid burning. Use six chicken bullion cubes. Use 1/2 cup of cream. Increase the water to 1 1/2 quarts. Use 1/2 pound of mild ground italian sausage and 1/2 pound of spicy ground sausage instead of the sausage links.

This is a fantastic recipe...and it's even tastier and easier made in a crock-pot! Thought I would share with you haw I did it.  I baked 4 Italian Sausages in the oven until the were done.  Meanwhile, I cooked the bacon pieces and removed them from the skillet along with most of the grease.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in the remaining Tbs or so of bacon fat.  I also added one carrot, diced.  I added the sauteed vegetables along with the diced potatoes to a 3 and 1/2 quart crock-pot and covered with two cans of chicken broth and one can of beef broth, some of which I used to deglaze the skillet.  When the sausages were done, I sliced them and added them to the pot.  I let the pot simmer on low for about 6 hours.  When we got home, I turned the pot to high and added the chopped kale and cooked bacon and let them cook for about 15 minutes while I made some garlic bread.  When we were ready to serve, I poured a Tbs or so of cream into each bowl and ladled in the soup.  Fantastic and so easy!

When I make this soup I have my hubby in mind. He loves the Zuppa Toscana soup at a popular italian restaurant..(yeah..I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about).  I like to use the "hot" italian sausage and fresh spinach instead of kale. I cut my bacon with scissors and fry it by itself. Then I use the bacon grease to saute the onions. There have been occasions when I didn't have any cream on hand, and so I used either half and half or whole milk with a little butter. I also have replaced half of the water called for with chicken broth..and it's great. Thanks Nancy.

I make this soup often, & my children LOVE it!  I use ground Italian sausage (so that there is no need to deal with the casing), and I just brown it along with some cayenne pepper (for a kick) and then drain it. I also drain all but 1 tbsp. of the bacon grease and add a pinch of crushed red pepper.  I used to frequent Olive Garden to get this soup, but it is just so much better homemade, not to mention fresher (you know how sometimes you get that bad waiter/waitress that gives you a bowl of kale)! YUM!!  Thanks Nancy!

I love this soup!  I make it every year upon request from the family.  I would suggest cooking the bacon first, remove, then cook chopped onions in bacon grease.  Otherwise, onions burn before bacon is cooked.  Great recipe!!

Okay, I had to rate this recipe again just to say that I had to give the recipe to my son-in-law who went nuts over this soup after I sent home with him and my daughter.  Any time I offer a frozen container he is thrilled.  I do find I like the texture better after the soup is cooled and then reheated.  Also, I always use the entire bunch of kale and mild italian sausage which I think is wonderful.  Family or entertaining this is fabulous!

DELISH!  I was so excited to try this soup and it exceeded all my expectations!  It is a wonderful copy of the restaurant soup, which is one of my all time faves!  I omitted the sausage, since i'm not a sausage fan and increased the bacon.  I also used spinach instead of kale since for some odd reason my grocery store doesn't carry kale, but it didn't really change the taste at all.  I highly recommend this soup, it was wonderful!

This soup is greatly enjoyed by everyone in the family.  Baking the sausage was a great effort-saver.  I used half and half instead of cream.
And I doubled the recipe except for the bacon and it was GREAT!

Great recipe!!  The only thing I do differently is I fry the bacon in the pot first, THEN add the onion to the grease after I remove the bacon.  (If I fry the onion and bacon together, the onion starts to burn before the bacon is cooked.)

WOW! I don't know how this is even legal!!!!! I love it! I used 1 hot italian and one mild italian link, LOTS OF KALE, russets, more broth than called for, and more heavy cream than called for. Lots of garlic salt too, because I'm a garlic salt fanatic. Now I don't have to go to a certain restaurant and spend $40 dollars just for this soup! I can finally order salad with my meal again cause I'll always have this on hand at home!!!

Excellent everytime I make it! Very forgiving. I always use Italian sausage since it adds some spice. I use red potatoes with the skin left on. I do not drain the bacon fat - there is so much flavor there. I use a little extra garlic. Kale is definately the green of choice. It adds the RIGHT flavor. Cabbage or spinach just don't cut it. I use Swansons chicken broth instead of chicken base, it seems to be a little less salty. Add black pepper at the end to taste! MMmmmmm MMmmmmm - Thanks Nancy for the recipe!!

Followed the recipe, BUT using low-fat ingredients.  I used turkey bacon, turkey sausage crumbles, half-and-half.  Seriously, it is just as good.  We had this the other night at a friend's house, and you can't really tell the difference in the one that I made tonight.  Absolutely loved it and we can now have it more often since we can make it healthier.

This is so funny, because I got this recipe from a friend years ago.  It's like exactly the same!  She must have gotten it off here.  hehehe  
In any case this gets rave reviews from everyone I've ever served it to.
Recommendations ... cut the stem out of the kale, otherwise it's like bark (since the Kale steams for only 5 minutes), very unpleasent.  BUT if you REALLY want to keep it, cut the stem up nice and small, leaving the leaves till later, and add them to the soup RIGHT at the beginning with the water, and it'll cook!  Blend right in; you won't even notice!
You can use actual chicken soup stalk.  If you do, just measure the same amount as you would water, and don't bother with the bullion.
I personally like to add 1/2 a cup of cream ... it's not really an absolutly limited item.  You can add more if you REALLY want to.
OH .. it freezes well!  :)

I worked at Olive Garden for over 4 years so I know their Zuppa Toscana inside and out.  This is the closest recipe I've found.  I made this last night and it turned out great.  I used hot italian sausage instead of smoked.  I rememved it from its casing and cooked it on the stove, ground up.  Thats how the soup is at the OG. I also used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of chick soup base because thats what i had on hand.  If you add just a pinch or two of red pepper flakes you have yourself the exact soup from The Olive Garden, in my opion. Try it, you wont know the difference!!

Just like Olive Garden... I used 5 links of Johnsonville mild Italian sausage, casings removed, browned & drained of grease.  4 large russet potatoes skins on sliced into half circles.  1 large diced onion.  1 jar of Hormel "real" bacon bits.  2 tbs minced garlic, 6 cups of kale, 32 oz box of chicken broth, 3/4 - 1 cup of fat free half & half & water to desired consistency/taste.  Added salt, cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes for that zip!  This fed a family of 6 with garlic bread on the side.  To make it a little thicker I took a potato masher and mashed up some of the potatoes.  This is a new family favorite.

Excellent!  Used hot italian sausage and added lots of red pepper flakes.  I like spicy!  Used chicken broth instead of stock and water and used fresh baby spinach instead of kale.  I have never had this soup at OG so I can't compare, but I am going to order it the next time I go to see if mine is better :) Very hearty soup full of flavor.  Will definitely make again.  A keeper for sure!!

The flavor of this soup was wonderful, and pretty close to TOG's soup, but I did make a few changes to the recipe that I think helped & made it a little closer to the restaurant's recipe:  I used chicken broth instead of soup base (also upped the broth by 1 1/2 cups and used 1/2 cup whipping cream instead of 1/3) and used a spicier italian sausage (browned in a skillet) instead of baking smoked sausage in the oven.  I also felt the quantity of sausage was a little much in relation to the other ingredients so I only used about 10 oz. instead of 16.

I fixed it according to directions. I found it to be sort of bland. It was easy to doctor though. I added salt to taste, Italian seasoning, diced tomatoes and cannellini beans. Then let it simmer in the crock pot most of the day.

This was a great outline for a recipe. I wanted to make it more authentic and lower in calories. I used turkey Italian sausage and half and half instead of heavy cream. It was perfect and tasted almost exactly like Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana! My whole family enjoyed it, and it had only 241 calories per serving rather than 380 as listed!

Oh MY! This is my favorite soup when our office goes out for lunch at that over-priced italian restaurant. I always go with the "soup, salad, and breadsticks"  just to enjoy this soup. I made this recipe last week and will make it again, and again, and again! I think this actually had a better flavor than the restaurant version. I had also never cooked with Kale before, but as much as my 4-year old loved it, I will add more next time. This goes into my permanant recipe file!

I don't usually rate recipes on here, but I have now made this so many times -- to rave reviews and empty bowls -- that I felt it was only fair to rate it (and rate it well!).  This dish is easy to make, delicious to eat, and is a staple in my house.  I make it exactly as suggested. Love it!

Mmmmm.  Had lots of kale from our summer CSA to use up and this was a hit.  The kale shrinks quite a bit so it's a great way to use it, but do tear small so that it's not such a mess to get into your mouth.  Big hit with my husband.

My husband loved this recipe. I added about 8 ounces of drained kidney beans to make it more hearty. I thought the soup was a little salty. I bought the chicken soup base just for this recipe but next time I will make it with canned broth. The suggestion to add red pepper flakes is a great kick. I will make this again. I would have rated 4.5 if I could have.

This soup is great comfort food for cold winters!  It's very close to the Olive Garden's recipe.  I use spicy Italian sausage to give it kick and skip the bacon.  If you're looking for a skinnier version; leave out the bacon, add more kale and use half & half instead of cream.  Makes me crave the cool seasons so I can make it again!

My family weren't fans, but it had good flavor. I don't discourage people from trying it. I just think that it didn't meet my family's taste.

This is a good recipe, very similar to the one from a very well known restaurant. I did however change just a few things. I have always used hot sausage in my zuppa toscana and I think it adds that much more flavor. I always make a large pot of this so potatoe wise I use about three pounds. The longer you cook it the more the potatoes fall apart of course. So, when I make this its normally on the stove for about 3 hours. More potatoes are a definite. The heavy cream is a personal preference as well, I tend to add a little more, so its extra creamy. Overall its a good recipe. My husband loves this so will of course continue making it.

Closest thing to the restaurant's version! Very good! I doubled the broth, onion, bacon & garlic. 1 lb. sausage is plenty and you get twice the soup!!! My 2 year old ate it all, but the kale, cuz it's green. Definately make it again! Also: Add pepper. DO NOT ADD ANY SALT! Very salty.

This recipe was the bomb!!!!  It was the best...I even agree with one other rater that said it is better than the one from OG.  The Kale is much fresher than the one at OG.  You can actually notice that it's Kale rather than spinish.  I did add more potatoes and add more chicken broth.  The flavor with the bacon and italian sausage was great. I love it.  My bf loved it too...we finished the whole pot that night.  Mmmmmmmmm!!!!  Can't wait to make it again.

Great recipe, Here is what I have changed, I substitute bulk Italian sausage, 1/2 mild, 1/2 hot, for the links. I cover the bottom of my frying pan in wine, then saute the sausage, onion, and garlic together. I also use evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream. I also used yellow potatoes. Everyone seems to love this soup.

This is VERY EASY to make.  This recipe is much better than The Restaurant's version.  I used to go to The Restaurant just to get this soup.  Now that I make it at home, I don't even bother ordering it there (this version is creamier and more substantial).  I don't recommend making this soup when you've worked particularly hard on a main dish.  Everyone will stuff themselves on the soup!

This recipe is outstanding!  The only thing that I changed was the amount of sausage.  I used only half the amount called for.  A whole pound was too much.  I usually double the recipe, except the sausage, because my family loves it so much.  Thanks, Nancy.

This was very good after I made some adjustments after reading others reviews. I used some hot, as well as some smoked turkey sausage that is made locally here where I live - its the best! I first cooked the sausage, removed from the casing, in a skillet w/ 2 strips of cut up bacon, and drained it well, as opposed to baking it. I also used baby spinach inplace of kale, and half n half in place of cream. I then microwaved about 6 slices of bacon and crumbled and set aside. After soup was ladled, I topped it w/ grated Asiago cheese and the crumbled bacon. Everyone here loved it - we all thought that the HOT sausage was perfect to give it some kick.

This is my all time favorite soup! I've been making it for a couple of years now. It was a hit with my best friend and her husband. I always use more cream than called for, but thats just me! I'll be making it again to take to work in a few days. Don't hesitate to make it, you'll love it.

I loved this soup. I followed exactly, except sub homemade chicken broth for soup base and water. I have so much Kale in the garden this will be a staple during cooler times.

We used smoked sausage similar looking to Keilbasa... I think that's not what the recipe calls for, but the kids liked it. I might try it with Italian sausage later. Also, I didn't have chicken soup base, so I just added the amounts of water and chicken base that it called for and did half chicken broth and half water. I think it gave it much more flavor. We didn't add any salt until the very end (and added a little bit of the bacon grease).  I cooked the bacon on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil in the oven... it gets crispier that way... and cooked the onions (used red onions) with a bit of olive oil on the stove with the garlic, just a low simmer to tender them b/4 adding them to the soup. We had also made homemade artisan bread and had it to dip in the broth, it went together fabulously!! Wonderful meal!

Really great recipe. I adapted slightly as we are vegetarian. Use vegetable broth, no bacon and use lightly sauteed tofurky kielbasa sausage. Delicious!

Great recipe, both my hubby and I marked it as a keeper. I used hot italian sausage crumbled and browned on the stove, 2 T. sodium free chicken soup base with 6 cups of water, 8 small red potatoes - chunked w/ the skin on, baby spinach, and double the cream. I thought I had drained the sausage well, but not well enough, the soup was kind of greasy, next time I will probably rinse with hot water as well. I am going to cook the onion and garlic in the bacon fat, but leave the bacon out of the soup, since it was soggy and didn't add to the overall flavor. I also thought it was very thin, so next time I plan on thickening with a roux and using evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.

Rave reviews all around! This is what worked for me:  16oz spicy sausage; 1 large potato & about 7 fingerling potatoes; 1 onion; 6 slices bacon cooked separately n crumbled; 2 1/2 teasp minced garlic; 1 bunch kale (washed n torn w/out stems); 2 cups chicken stock (the one i had was low sodium); 3 cups water (w/ room for adjusting); 3/4 cup half; 1/2 cup lactaid milk (for the lactose intolerant-i found that since lactaid has the enzyme that breaks down lactose, when added to a recipe that calls for creams, cheeses, etc., it makes it easier on people that are mildly lactose intolerant); 1 teaspn salt,pepper,& red pepper flakes (all to taste); and 2 or 3 slices of pepper jack cheese =); shredded parmesan for serving.  ~~bake sausage @ 300 for about 25 min; cook onions in about 1 tblspn butter; add garlic and cook an additional minute; add chicken stock, water, potatoes & simmer for 15 min; add crumbled bacon, sausage, kale, 1/2&1/2, milk, salt, pepper, red pepper & simmer additional 5-10 min; add pepper jack and heat through; serve with shredded parmesan; stuff face; pass out from food coma ^_~   have with bread sticks (just like O.G.) for a great lunch.

This is a quick and easy soup to make. It was my first time making it and i was thrilled to find it turned out exactly like the restaurant soup. The only changes i made was to use hot sausage links instead of the smoked ones. I took off the casings from the links and crumbled the meat into a frying pan. I added crushed red pepper flakes as well for extra flavor and spice. I also used real bacon bits from a can and added them when the onions were already getting soft. It really saved time and work. Instead of the chicken base i used 10 cups of water and 6 bouillon cubes. The result was great! I will defineatly make this again.

Great soup..However after making it a few times I have learned a couple things.  Adding some dried crushed red pepper flakes gives it more of a kick similar to olive garden's.  Secondly to keep the broth that nice white color, after cooking bacon and sausage rinse them off well with water to drain off oils/fats which create a funky orange color in your broth.

Completely amazing, this soup! I used lean turkey sausage and fat free half-and half, adding a little corn starch for thickening. I cooked the kale longer because it was a bit tough, and made more of the broth/soup without adding extra sausage or bacon. It was absolutely marvelous! I want to eat it every day!

Very yummy on such a cold and rainy day. I used pre-cooked smoked sausage like Hillshire Farm or Eckrich, cut them as directed, but browned in soup pan, removed cooked sausage, then browned the onion and garlic in the same pan. I used baby spinach and baby kale from a bagged salad and milk (it's what I had on hand). In the interest of sodium, I only used 3 tsp of the chicken bullion and only a bit of left over cooked bacon I had. Came out wonderfully! Thank you for a great soup recipe!

Instead of using smoked sausage I decided to substitute Johnsonville Italian sausage. To cut down on the fat I baked my bacon in the oven and drained it on paper towels and just used a little bit of the grease to saute my onions. This turned out good but next time I make it I will leave out the soup base and water altogether and just use a low sodium chicken broth. I'm sure smoked sausage would be good in here too but I prefer the Italian sausage in this type of soup.

I like the Super-Delicious Zuppa Toscana recipe because it calls for red pepper flakes and crumbled mild Italian sausage. But they are so alike both are wonderful!

Excellent! I did find that like several people mentioned that you should cook the bacon seperately.  I also used more cale and potatoes than the recipe called for.  I also didnt know to take the casing off of the sausage (will do that next time) It was kind of a lot of work but very much worth the end result!

I made a big pot of this soup the other night & it turned out great!  I added fresh mushrooms & used baby red potatoes to add additional color to the green kale.  Served it with crusty french bread.

tasty and hearty.  I felt the meat to veggie ratio was way too heavy, though, so I tripled the portion of kale.  I also used Italian sausage (removed the casing) instead of smoked sausage

As others suggested, I cooked bacon separately from onions (I cooked onions in the bacon grease)

Amazing. Never had the soup in the popular resturant.  I baked the bacon (that's the way I prefer to make bacon) and sauteed the onion with the sausage. (I used ground pork sausage rather than the links.  I used chard, thought I had kale. Thought it tasted fine with the chard, but have only tried this once.  Definetly going to make this one a lot!!!

This just might be my favorite soup ever! I often make it with low-sodium chicken broth instead of the base, and simply add milk instead of the cream, but this recipe is so good you wouldn't know the difference!  It took a little tweaking to get it just how it is in the restaurant, but when I asked a waitress, she gave me a juicy tip: add some flavorful dry wine to the soup to give it that extra umph.  If you have any doubts about this recipe at all- don't, just make sure you cook all the "bitter" out of your kale and you're good to go!

Made the soup today and it was great. Fried the bacon first and then use about tbsp of the bacon fat to fried the onion. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and add a tbsp of half & half cream to each bowl before ladeling in the soup (vs adding it to the soup) as not everyone was eating at the same time. Also add more chicken broth near the end as a lot of the liquid evaporated during the simmering (could be due to the high heat). The family loved it. I did find it a bit salty so will probably add more water instead of chicken broth next time. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my favorite OG soup and now to have it at home is great!  I made a huge batch and used canned chicken broth (5 cans), 2 bunches of kale no stems, and left over turkey bacon. Now to see if the the picky eaters will enjoy it, I sampled it and yummm!!!

Wow! I was looking for a recipe for kale that I thought my hubby might try. This is it. Used turkey smoked sausage and fat free half & half but otherwise kept the recipe the same. The hardest part was only having one bowl!

I used 4 oz of Italian sausage that I had browned ahead of time, instead of 16 oz of smoked sausage.  I also sauteed the onion without the bacon fat.  (I used precooked bacon slices that I zapped in the microwave and just added at the end.)  I did this to lighten the fat content a little.  It was still great!  My kids enjoyed it, too!

Good soup. I used sweet Italian sausage for this and did not have any heavy cream so I used about half tablespoon of butter when cooking the onion and bacon then added a can of evaporated milk at the end, to replace the cream. I also added black pepper, white pepper, and a bit of oregano. The thing that made this soup a warm spicy treat that spreads warmth through your body but doesn't burn your mouth was some nice Hungarian paprika, get the good stuff and it will give this soup a wonderful mellow savory heat.

My Husband loves the OG Zuppa Toscana, so I decided to make this for him. He loved it and says he actually thinks it is better than the OG! We multiply the servings by 6 and make a huge pot to divide to freeze! Great to make for friends and new mommas! Make a fresh loaf of bread and you have a wonderful meal!

I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. There are a couple changes I've had in other Tuscan style soups that I think yield a better product than this one. #1-Hot or Mild Italian Sausage (as opposed to smoked sausage which is not the same thing). #2 - Crushed red pepper to add heat & fennel seed to add that fennel flavor. Red pepper and fennel are prominent flavors in Italian sausage and I missed them here. With that said though, as a *smoked sausage and potato soup* rather than a *zuppa toscana* this is great! Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is incredible. I made a few minor changes:  1. used mild Italian turkey sausage that I removed the casings, crumbled and cooked on the stove. 2. cooked the bacon and onions separately 3. used fresh spinach with the stems removed instead of kale b/c the grocery store was out of kale 4. used half and half instead of cream  Wonderful and will definitely be making again.

I loved it! This is my favorite soup at Olive Garden and the thought of making it at home with my husband's homemade Italian sausage was over the top! I didn't think it would taste the same but it did.  I like to thicken the broth a bit with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch in cold water, then add to the soup.  YUM...... Not quite as good leftover though.  Best on the first day!

My family loves this soup!  I have made it several times and just realized I never rated it.  I like changing it up with regular or spicy Italian sausage.  I always tend to overcook the potatoes or maybe I slice them to thin but it still tastes delicious!

this recipe was awesome.  I think that it tastes better then the original verison of the soup.  I also read the reviews which I also do before starting a recipe on this site(its so helpful) ans did the turkey hot sausage.  Just delightful!!!  Although its my husbands favorite soup at olive garden so we'll see when he gets home if it ranks better...

Used both kielbalsa and italian sausage. Had to add more broth and heavy cream. Also added a small amount of garlic salt, red pepper flakes, and seasoned salt. Served with bruscetta. Needs time for the potatoes to get softer. My husband said it tasted just like the restaurant version. Excellent!

This is sooooo delicious. I love the Zuppa Toscana at Olive Garden, and think that this was equally good, if not better.

I strayed from the recipe a teeny bit. I cooked the bacon, sausage, and onions at same time in frying pan. (In the future I'll do the onions separately, as they seemed to cook quite a bit faster than the two meats.) I used Jimmy Dean ground sausage, about 3/4 lb. I chopped up the bacon before cooking it.

Next time I will consider using 4 cups chicken broth in lieu of the chicken soup base and quart (4 cups) of water. I had never heard of chicken soup base before, and wasn't sure what the impact would be of the substitution, so I stuck with the recipe this time around.

Next time I'll add fresh mushrooms, too. No additional seasoning was necessary. The soup was absolutely fantastic.

Great!  I made a few changes.  I cut up the bacon then fried it, I hate frying then crumbling bacon (so messy!).  I also added more cream.  I didn't have soup base, so I used bouillon.  I found I had to cook the kale longer than 4 minutes.  Excellent leftovers for lunch!

This was very tasty!  My rating isn't very fair because I did have to alter the recipe a little to accommodate dietary restrictions (no pork).  I used 1 pound soy sausage and omitted the bacon.  I sauteed the onion and then added the garlic... I doubled the broth (as we like a lot of soup) and cooked the potatoes until tender.  Added the "soysauge", kale, and cream and simmered for 10 minutes.  Seasoned with freshly ground black pepper, salt and a dash of chili powder.  It was delicious - even more so the next day (soups almost always taste better the next day).

I make this several times a month - especially during the cold months. I make mine with these small changes: I put bratwurst in mine; omit water - using only chicken broth, 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream; and spinach instead of kale and use 5 -6 potatoes instead of 2 - makes it chunkier.  I also throw mine over a bed of lettuce to boost up the veggies I consume in a day. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  Can not wait till hubby comes home from war - he will love it but I will throw it in a bread bowl for him.

I used lean italian seasoned ground turkey instead of the sausage.  I also used a little less cream and turkey bacon to cut down on the fat and calories a little.  Great recipe.  Will definately have to make again!

This is a dead ringer. I used to work for a certain nameless restaurant that served a soup just like this, and this recipe is spot on to it. This is my favorite soup served at that nameless restaurant so I had to try this recipe. This was a huge hit and so easy to make. I made a few changes...first, I didn't bake sausage links I just bought ground Italian sausage and browned it with the onions, two, I cooked the bacon seperate so I wouldn't have to pick it out of the onions as the recipe suggests, three, I added a whole can of chicken stock, four, I added more cream, five, I added a pinch of thyme and basil (not in the nameless restaurants soup...but I like those flavors so I added it to mine). Really great soup that I will for sure make again.

I prefer brothy soups over creamy soups, so I made the following changes: made about 1.5 times the amount of liquid, substituting half of the water with chicken broth, and used light cream instead of heavy cream. This makes a very tasty soup.

Excellent!  Thanks to Quality Cook Nurse Ellen for the wonderful recommendation. I used sweet Italian sausage and spinach in place of the kale.  I can't wait to try the leftovers today, I have a feeling this is going to be even after the flavors have melded a little more.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I love this recipe!! Some changes: I usually omit the bacon and use half & half instead of heavy cream. I also use the "hot" style italian sausage, and usually add a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes to the soup (we like it hot!) 

I have made this so often, and though it's probably not the healthiest thing we could eat, it sure is good.

Thank you for sharing. :)

This is really good, though I'm on a diet so I changed it to make it healthier.  First I bought Jennie-O turkey italian sausage and boiled it in chicken broth (boils out the fat and keeps flavor in), then I used the precooked hormel bacon crumbles, I used 4 cans of chicken broth an no water, and lastly I used Land-o-lakes fat free half & half instead of cream.  I think it's still really good even with all the changes and it's not greasy or anything this way.

LOVED this soup.  I had been wanting to make this for a long time and finally did.  Every time I go to the OG for dinner or lunch I get this soup.  I have to agree with some of you others out here that the homemade version is as good or better.  I used a combo of Johnsonville regular italian and spicy sausage.  I took them out of the casings and browned them in a pan with garlic.  I also used chicken broth from the box and two whole bunches of kale which I would do again.  I won't however use as much sausage next time as every bite had an enormous amount of sausage and it became just to much.  That's my only complaint about this soup and it's a self imposed one so I learned from it.  It was probably more than 16oz. I used 7 total fat links. Husband totally went nuts over this!! Loved the kale and just kept adding a handful at a time until it wilted enough to put more in.  Will most definately make this again.

I used sweet Italian sausage, increased the water by about 1 pint, and put 1/2 cup (instead of 1/3) cream, and added about 2T crushed red pepper.  Good stuff right there.  Cut the stems out of the kale.

What a great soup recipe Nancy and I thank you for submitting it! I read another similar recipe that called for Italian sausage and of course, this one called for smoked. I didn't want to use either, so I went with Chorizo. I'm so glad I made this choice because it added just the right amount of heat without it overpowering the dish. I don't do bouillon or soup bases, so I used fat free, low sodium chicken broth instead. I enjoy letting my soups simmer for at least an hour (makesthe house smell so homey and good) as I feel it brings out the flavors of the ingredients. The kale turned out tender and perfectly done. Loved this soup and so did my gang!

I followed the recipe as written the first time I attempted it. I did not care for the flavor from the smoked sausage links at all (reason for my low rating). I used bulk ground italian sausage for my second attempt and the flavor was much better, and closer to the restaurant version. I now make a version that is a cross between this recipe and another recipe from this site (the "Super-Delicious Zuppa Toscana" recipe) using half mild Italian sausage and half spicy Italian sausage.

Good soup.  I've never had the soup at Olive Garden, so can not compare.  I will make again but, will not add the cream and sausage unitl after the kale is done.  The sausage cooked too long and lost some of it's flavor.  Also, I used hot Itialian turkey sausage.

Delicious!  Thanks to everyone for the great tips to make this recipe even better. I doubled this recipe so that I would have plenty of leftovers to freeze.  I used 1 16oz zesty hot bulk sausage and 1 16oz regular bulk sausage (the restaurante uses the crumbled also).  I cooked the onion and garlic (extra garlic) seperate from the bacon.  I did use about 2 Tbsp of the bacon grease to cook the onion and garlic.  I rinsed the sausage and bacon after cooking to prevent the greasiness other reviewers talked about.  I used chicken broth and water instead of base. I also used red potatoes and added extra.  I did mean to add red pepper flakes when cooking the sausage but forgot.  I added it at the end to the soup and it was still perfect.  The red pepper is key to making this taste like the restaurant version. Delicious!!

This was wonderful.  I didn't change a thing this time (other than a handful of fresh italian parsley), but I'm sure there are lots of variations that would be good.  A keeper.

This recipe is good!  However, word to the wise, it does take a long while to prepare (cutting the sausage, crumbling the bacon etc).  I used half & half rather than cream (fat-free!)  I also used Spicy Italian Sausage- this adds a very spicy bite (do it if you like bite, don't if you don't like spicy spicy!)  I also added chopped carrots.  This added more color.  Finally, I used fresh spinach rather than Kale (couldn't find Kale at the store).  All in all, this soup tastes very authentic!

Great stuff, we have made this 4 or 5 times.  A couple notes, try different sausages (like mild italian or kielbasa) to vary the flavor.  Also the prep time takes a while, if having for lunch it is easier to prepare all the ingredients the night before and put in zip-loc bags and then the soups only takes 25-30 mins....

Wonderful recipe - better than the restaurant's version.  More ingredients and fresher taste!

I used bulk italian sausage instead of the links, easier to work with and didn't have to use the oven.  Drain very well, though, or the sausage will add more fat to the soup!  This and a salad are a wonderful meal!

Very good.  I've been looking for a recipe to duplicate what we get at the popular Italian restaurant -- not exactly what I expected, but close.  I used italian sausages as suggested in an earlier review -- next time I will probably cut back a little on the meat (that was a lot)and I will lightly grease the pan before I bake the sausages as they stuck to the pan a bit.  

Thanks for a great recipe, Nancy.

Quite possibly the best soup I have ever made! I have gone to eat at Olive Garden just for a bowl of this soup, and now I've got the secret!! It was very easy, and DELICIOUS. I froze it and it looked really chunky when I defrosted it, but when I reheated it, it got "soupy" again. Hooray! Now, if we could just replicate their breadsticks...

I made this soup for one course of a dinner party.. Everyone loved it! It is a great soup -  the sausage gives it great flavor and the kale makes it pretty.  I agree with the previous review don't hesitate to use this recipe with your family or guests..it will be a huge hit!!

This soup is stupendous!!!  It turned out great the first time I made it.  I'm not a big fan of Kale, so I substituted cabbage instead.....Way Better!!!  I also used hot Italian sausage. Yummy!!!

I think some of the info in the recipe is too vague.  For instance, 2 potatoes.  Well, if you want your potatoes to turn to mush and fall apart....follow that.  BUT, all soups need a LOW STARCH potatoes.....not a russet, not an Idaho, but more like a fingerling, or better yet, the tiny red ones and new ‘baby’ or young potatoes.  All of these choices are low starch either by design or by the fact they were harvested before all the starch developed.  They hold up firm and solid while sitting in a big pot of soup...even if it sits in the fridge a couple of days.  Also, some people say the recipe is too salty, but have used the suggested smoked sausage, which is like kielbasa....very salty.  Better choice is a good, ground Italian sausage which is packaged like hamburger.  They come in a variety of  strengths as far as heat....mild,  spicey, extra hot...  I went with the mild and this turned out incredible.  Also, BOUILLON CUBES ARE AWFUL !! If you don’t have a good homemade chicken stock, the next best thing is “Better Than Bouillion”.   It’s in the soup aisle, somewhere next to those awful bouillon cubes.  It comes in a jar and should be refrigerated once open.  It comes in Chicken, Turkey, Beef and Vegetable.  ALSO, use Baby Kale or Baby Spinach to keep bitterness away!

I Quadrupled this recipe for a Baby Shower I was hosting and this got Rave Reviews!!! I will be making this over and over now! Since I had sooo much bacon to cook I cooked it all in the oven and did the onions and garlic by themselves on the stove. Then combined everything in a very large pot. So so delicious!!!!

I'll definitely make it again. The only changes I made were more potatoes to make it more chunky and I used spicy italian sausage for a little kick. Oh and I'm sure if you used chicken stock instead of chicken soup base it would be just as good or better.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  After making this recipe I would change a few things.  As one person suggested...yes, cook the bacon and onion separately.  The bacon doesn't crisp up when cooking with the onion.  Cook the bacon and use the drippings to cook the onion in.  I used 2 1/2 quarts of water and 1/2 cup of cream.  I used 3 small russet potatoes but I would have added one or two more.  I used 3 chicken sausages from Sprouts.  It was delicious!!!

Was good but had too much meat in it.
Went well with a french loaf of bread (and lots of hot sauce)!

This was so good. Tasted like Olive Garden's but better. I added red pepper flakes, shallots instead of onion, and a ground beef and sausage mix. Also added one can of white beans  and some fresh parsley.  Top with fresh Parmesan and served with Crusty Italian bread. Delicious!

I'm obsessed with this soup!! It's my all time favorite and this recipe tastes exactly like the real deal! Plus, I like making it myself rather than getting it at a restaurant because you know the ingredients are fresh and you can make it your own. I like to try it with a different type of sausage every time I make it.

I will give this recipe 4 stars for using it the way it's written. I was so happy to find a great base recipe so that I could adjust it to my liking. I haven't made it in a while and forgotten a few of my changes. (Double the recipe, leftovers are great) try using low sodium chicken broth or stock, that will help a lot, and I always forget it's heavy cream or whipping cream and I always buy half and half. Still tastes great. I have a great photo but the website doesn't like its size ;)

It turned out great!  I altered the recipe and substituted 3/4 cup milk with 1/4 cup butter instead of using heavy whipping cream. I also used ground jimmy dean sausage and omitted the bacon.

A definite 5 Stars for this recipe!!  Made to recipe except for using 2 C. Water and 2 C. f/f 1/2 & 1/2.  All I had on hand was the bulk mild Italian Sausage so I used that too.  Anyhow, it all came together into one delicious tasting soup.  Thanks Nancy!  I'll be using your recipe often with the winter months coming up!

The recipe is good, but I needed to add more spice for flavor, Fresh Rosemary, Thyme, Oregano, and Paprika made a big difference, I also lengthened the cook time to about 1 1/2 hrs. Of course this was just personal preference.

I loved this recipe! The only things I did differently was use mild Italian sausage instead of smoked sausage, and I poured off a little of the bacon drippings to add some of the drippings from the sausage. I also reduced the onion slightly and added some shallot. I accidentally almost cartelized the onion/shallot/garlic mixture, but it was still great. I personally would use a little less chicken base next time, as it was slightly too salty for my taste.

Awesome!  I made this vegetarian by eliminating the bacon/sausage and adding more kale/onions.  Also used 2 1/2 cans (14 oz) veggie broth instead of water/soup base.  Also included crushed red pepper as recommended by other users.  Very delicious, hearty soup.

Made minor tweaks, but this was the best thing I have ever made!!! Cooked sweet Sausage minus casing with fennel and red pepper to give it the kick OG has....fantastic. Also used turkey sausage, turkey bacon, fat free half & half, and double the kale. Wish I had a mandolin to slice the potatoes, but cubed was ok too. Thanks so much for posting this one!!

this is very close to the real thing!  I make it all the time with a couple of changes.  First of all, I hardly ever use more than one pot when I make a soup, and this one is no exception. I also like to squeeze the meat out the sausage links...it cooks so much faster. I use turkey sausage, so I have to add a small amount of olive oil to the pot when I do this. Remove the sausage from the pot then I cook my bacon, turkey bacon, which I have already cut into small pieces. then add the onion to the pot, cook till tender, then  the garlic.  Then I add everything except the kale and  heavy cream. When the potatoes are about half done, I add the kale, and let that cook till it is just tender.  Then I had half and half and a few shakes of some red pepper flakes.  Simmer till it's all heated though.  Love this!

I used fully cooked turkey Andouille sausage so I was able to skip the first step of cooking the sausage.  I used homemade chicken stock fortified with a tsp. of Penzey’s chicken soup base instead of water and soup base for a very rich broth.  Never having had the soup at the famous Italian restaurant I do not know how this recipe compares, but we were somewhat underwhelmed by this soup.  It was good, just not “knock your socks off, can’t wait to make it again” good.

I whipped this up in little or no time tonight and my family LOVED it!  We're all taking leftovers of it in our lunches tomorrow.  I used turkey smoked sausage and fat-free half & half to cut down on the fat grams.  I used the entire bunch of kale - probably twice or more what the recipe called for because our family has decided we LOVE kale!  Who knew?

This is a great recipe. The soup is requested at least once a month. As soon as friends and family hear it is on the stove I have a house full. I use hot italin sausage for a little kick and I cut ip raw and cook it in the soup pot to keep more of the flavor. I cook the bacon seperate til it's a little crispy because it will soften in the soup. I also use 2 qts low sodium chicken stock insted of water but, still using the chicken base. I found using boullion maes it salty.

Serve this with raw sliced apples or cheese and crusty bread for a meal!  I made a few changes that to me, didn't diminish the flavor at all.
I used 6 small red potatoes and did not peel them.
No bacon.  Cook onions and garlic in olive oil.  
No heavy cream.  Use half and half.
I used a little extra garlic.
I used Whole Foods Italian pork sausage.  If you like spicy, a hotter sausage would be good.
Be sure not to overcook after adding the kale.  It still had a little al dente to it!  Terrific!

I prepared this using hot italian sausage instead of smoked sausage.  I really like it, and it is the best use of kale I have found to date.  After making it a few times now, I think I will increase the potato a bit and cube them instead of slice them next time.  My potatoes were 3-4" yukon golds, so they may be smaller than the ones used by the author.  In my opinion, the cream is optional.  This is a good soup with or without the cream.

This was a winner! I had a friend give me a couple bunches of kale and I didn't know a thing about what one does with it. Now I know. One makes Zuppa Toscana for a meal with friends and basks in the glow of their praises for the evening. I did not have the sausage called for so I uses polish sausage and it was wonderful. I didn't measure the kale, just doubled the entire recipe  for enough liquid to cook all my kale. I also shredded my potatoes in a thick hashbrown/like cut beause I have a Salad master machine that does that for me in a jiffy and I didn't even have to peel the potatoes. I used 4-5 fresh garlic cloves instead of the powder....I think that's all the modifying I did. A keeper for sure....and I love the name.....makes me feel like I'm morphing into a bonified "foodie". ;D

I made this with ground turkey sausage because it is what I had on hand (for my typical sausage and kale dinner)  I wouldn't change a thing, this recipe was flavorful and rich but not  heavy at all. Everyone loved it, even my daughter who doesn't like kale.

My three, four and a half, and six year old all gave this a big thumbs up.  They didn't *love* the kale, but then again, they don't really *love* anything green, and they ate it without complaining.  My husband and I were definitely pleased.  It's a keeper!

Great recipe definitely on par with Olive Gardens Zuppa Toscana. The only thing I do differently for this recipe is use Hot Italian sausage and Sprinkle a Parmesan Romano cheese Mix on top.

I loved this soup!!   I made it with fat free cream and thinned it down with a bit of milk as I like "brothy" soups.  I read alot of the previous reviews and took those into account before I made my soup.

Yum. We make this often. I always use low-sodium canned chicken broth. I also fresh spinach as we do not have access to fresh kale. I use smoked turkey sausages in this usually and dice it up with the skins left on. Now I don't have to go to OG to get this. Taste just like it.

The teenager & I liked it, hubby LOVED it! I used Jenni-o Italian turkey sausage instead of the smoked sausage. The 3 of us ate the whole thing, no leftovers. I wanted to try it tomorrow since others said it was better the next day. I'll make it again.

Very easy recipe and my husband loved the creamy, rich soup.  I served Garlic bread for dunking.  Be sure to cook the bacon first rather than with the onions.  Next time, I might try removing a few of the potatoes and pureeing them to add back to make the broth a little thicker.

Tastes great!  Well worth the effort and time to make.  Next time I make it I think I'll try spinach instead of kale, and hot Italian sausage instead of regular, just to mix it up a little.

Flavor wasn't too bad. I thought it was a little salty and needed some red pepper flakes as suggestived by others. My hubby LOVED this though. I used spinach instead of kale.  I would make again but use less bacon and less spinach as this had a lot of bacon flavor.

I have LOVED that restaurant soup for years! This soup is even BETTER!!!!! I have made it just as the recipe here is written and it has gotten raves from friends. I prefer to add more Kale and Italian sausage. it's better the next day and keeps nicely over four days in the fridge. I will make this again and again!!!!!

This recipe is amazing!  I substituted hot Italian sausage and it tasted just like the restaurant version.  For those that like a spicy flavor, consider adding red pepper flakes for added spice.

Thought that this was as close to the real thing as I have tasted!  The only thing I would have done different would be (when doubling or tripling as I did) to cut back on the sausage.  I was a little sauasage heavy.  I would have also added a potato or 2 more.  Mine was a tad thin.  Other than that, super!!

Love it so simple and yummy!! Hubby loves it, even the kale! (He's an anti-veggie eater.) I use mild italian sausage links and split them open, cook and crumble in the pan. I use black pepper in this soup too. Instead of water and soup base I use 2c. water and 2c. prepared chicken broth. I end up adding additional kale. Sooo delish!!!

I love this soup! Have made it several times. I see that a lot of reviewers seem to have equated "smoked sausage" with regular sausage. It isn't the same. Smoked sausage is like kielbasa. So I have made this often with turkey smoked sausage to cut down the fat content a little. I also have used regular milk instead of cream (and have used cream as well) and you don't notice too much difference in taste. The only complaint my family has had is that it is too salty (without adding additional salt). Since I don't ever have chicken stock base, I usually use chicken broth. It could be that this has more sodium than the stock base? I intend to try it next time with low sodium chicken broth. But I could eat this soup for every meal it is so delicious! Really tastes like a restaurant soup!

LOVED IT! This is one of my favorite soups,it tastes EXACTLY like Olive Garden's....I used Chicken broth instead of the base stuff, much easier. And 1 lb. ground pork sausage, much easier. At first I was worried it wouldn't have enough taste as it calls for no spice, but I was so wrong, it is packed with flavor!! I already bought more ingredients to make it again tomorrow! :o) P.S. This needs much more liquid than it calls for, and more potatoes, I felt I had doubled it and it still wasn't enough for 5-6 people. BUT GREAT!

This turned out really good and was actually a very fast and easy meal. Even using turkey Italian sausage and half and half instead of heavy cream, it was still plenty rich. I used fresh spinach from our garden instead of kale and it was fine as long as it is shredded well.

this came out fantastic -  i cooked the sausage in the oven on a broiler pan and let a lot of the grease drain off...   cooked in the crock pot and added the kale in the last 30 min and the cream just before serving...  brought it to work and everyone loved it.  not for the calorie conscious though:    served with parmesean cheese and crusty italian bread.

I love this soup.  I usually add hot pepper flakes to the sausage while cooking.  Also if you are low carbing, substitute cauliflower for the potatoes and it's just as good.

This soup was very flavorful.  I wasn't sure my husband was going to like it because of the kale.   He said he really enjoyed it.  The only change I would make would be to thicken it with a little cornstarch or flour.

Increased the recipe slightly to make up for the larger can of chicken broth I had by adding 5 and a half russet potatoes.  Also added a sprinkling of crushed red pepper, which gave it the necessary spice level.  Very yum.

I make this soup (or some rendition of it) every Thursday night. It's a GREAT "base" recipe in that it's quite versatile. For instance, my husband likes the "bitter" greens (kale, escarole, collards, etc.) better than I do so whenever they're on sale I stock up; otherwise, I use Spinach (my preference). I sometimes leave out the sausage (but always include the bacon). I often substitute either (dried) Cannellini (white pinto) beans or Great Northerns for the potatoes. I usually cook the "greens" in my slow cooker/crockpot on Wednesday night (all night on low; when using beans, I toss those in too) and I "flavor" the pot with the onion, garlic and "stock" (sometimes homemade, sometimes bouillon) the recipe calls for. Approximately 1/2 hour before serving, I sautee the meats in just a little butter and, when cooked, I incorporate them (and their "grease") into the soup and then "warm it". Some of the time, I add some sort of dairy (heavy cream, 1/2-and-1/2, milk, evaporated milk) but a lot of the time I don't. And (trust me) it's just as good without it. I ALWAYS add CHEESE -- sometimes Parmesan, sometimes Provolone, sometimes Cheddar, American or Swiss. Salt, pepper (black, white and cayenne) are staples on our table. Who wants, adds; who doesn't want, doesn't add. In brief, this is a SIMPLE, DELICIOUS, NUTRITIOUS and ECONOMICAL meal -- even when you "improvise".

I wanted to try this in the restaurant but my family and I do not eat pork. I used beef smoked sausage, finely diced and omitted the bacon. This had a really good flavor. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it was not as thick as I thought it should be. I will make this again.

Phenominal. I've made this recipe for a number of years and I swear it gets better every time. I occasionally switch up the type of sausage I use and mix it up that way. I made this for a christmas soup one year and my mother is positively addicted.  If I dont make it for her atleast once per year she gets upset with me.  It is very much like a famous "...garden" restaurant's recipe, but I much prefer this version.  A hint for those who have households that have mixed hot/mild tastes - use a little ground red pepper flakes in the ones who like it hot's bowl and nix those from the mild version.

I used turkey kielbasa instead of smoked sausage, and I browned it before adding it to the soup to enhance the flavor and color.  I cooked the kale in the bacon drippings with some of the onion and the garlic, and simmered it with the potatoes rather than waiting until the last 4 minutes to add it.  I also used about 1 cup of cream (got a bit carried away with that, but it still tasted great!).

WOW!!  Incredible flavor!  I've never had the OG version, but those that I've served it to that have say it is "spot on"!  Used bulk italian sausage and omitted bacon (don't like chewy, soggy bacon in soup)-husband says his new fave!!  Can't wait to make again!

I followed OMAHA's crock pot recipe on this one and it is incredible!  It tastes EXACTLY like your favorite soup at that famous italian restaurant we're all looking for.  The only thing I did differently was add a little water to tone down the saltiness but other than that it was great!  The advice to add the cream in the bowl and pour the soup on top was perfect, that way you don't have to worry about it curdling in the crock pot.

I recently made this soup, and my husband and I loved it!  I did make a few changes.  I used browned bulk sweet Italian sausage (couldn't find spicy, but I just added some red pepper flakes) and sauted the onion in the bacon grease.  I used chicken broth, and cooked all of it except the bacon and cream for about 6 hours on low in the slow cooker.  The kale held up really well even after hours of cooking, and it all cooked down a bit.  Then, right before serving, I added a little 2% milk and some crumbled bacon to each bowl.  It was still creamy enough (and healthier), and the bacon was still crispy.  Awesome recipe!

This was a great soup!  I only gave it 4 stars as I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I used bulk Italian sausage and made everything on the stovetop.  I omitted the bacon and used chicken stock instead of the soup base.  I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy whipping cream.  Husband loves the soup at OG and gave this one high marks for its similarity!

This was excellent, just like the restaurant's. The only changes I made were to use pre-cooked microwave bacon (MUCH easier) and half-and-half instead of cream.  Will make often!

I like many others love the famous Italian restaurant soup very similar to this one! This recipe is fabulous! I took others advice and used 1/2 sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 hot Italian sausage. I used 64 oz of chicken stock and no water. I used 1/2 cup of heavy cream. The soup was a little on the runny side, so I mashed up several slices of the cooked potatos and also added a tiny bit of corn starch mixed with water. Finally I added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg and fresh ground black pepper. I topped each bowl off with freshly grated parmesan cheese..very very good!!!

My family liked this as stated but next time I will use sweet italian sausage cooked and crumbled. I used escarole instead of kale, added 1/2 cup white cooking wine, 1/2 cup fresh parmesean cheese, oregano, parsley, and cooked for 3 hours. I also added cornstarch as a thickener for a better consistency.

My hubby & I loved this!!! The only thing I would probably change is to end up with less meat--even my husband thought it was meat-heavy. But I would not want to sacrifice the flavor of the base by getting rid of any of it, so I guess I wouldn't change anything.

Won a Blue Ribbon at my church for this soup.  People were raving and my kids love it too!!  This is one of my favorite recipes to date.  I made this following the recipe closely which I almost never do; it is fabulous!  Saute onions and bacon separately and then add garlic.  I dice and cook potatoes through and add with cream, turkey sausage and kale.  Add as much Kale as you like to look or taste... Kale is one of the most nutritious foods on Earth and you will love it in this soup.  One key step is to bring up to a rolling boil after adding in last ingredients, softens the Kale; fabulous then next day!!  I guarantee you will love it!!

This was very tasty. There is a LOT of sausage in this recipe.  The only complaint that I have is that the broth is kind of runny...that might have been because we used half-and-half instead of the heavy whipping cream.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this less fattening by using smoked turkey sausage and turkey bacon and 1/2 cup of half and half instead of 1/3 cup heavy cream.  I also made it more kid friendly by not putting the spinach in the soup and having it as a salad instead.  They loved this and asked for seconds.

Delicious! I used ground italian sausage and little red potatoes (about 8). I steamed them in the microwave first for about 6 min., to make them easier to cut up. I also used a little more garlic, used 1 can of ckn broth (all I had), and then used 6 cups of water and about 5 tbl spoons of instant bouillion. I also used 2 bunches of kale and removed the stems, used real bacon bits, and about 2 tbl spoons of crushed red pepper. I also used about 1 cup of cream.

This is the first review I've ever made for anything. Thats how good this was! I tripled the recipe before ever knowing what it would taste like because of all the reviews....and I was not dissapointed! My family absolutely loved it! And my brother made me promise to make it for when we visit. The only thing I changed was the sausage, I used hot italian sausage and cooked out of casing on the stove.
This was so much better then the OG's and that is my favorite soup when I eat there.

Great soup! Very easy to make too, start to finish took less than half an hour. I used hot italian sausage, red onion and spinach (what I had on hand) instead of smoked sausage, regular onion and kale, and it turned out superb! In addition, I used pre-cooked bacon which saved even more time. Even though I made it today for tomorrow night's dinner, I snuck myself a little bowl. By the way, 1 Quart water is equal to 4 C.

We just joined an organic farm coop and kale was in our box this week.  What to do with kale???  I found this recipe and it really is good.  I made it exactly as the recipe asked and loved it.  Even my kids ate it. Next time I would use less sausage or add more broth/cream, because I like a little more broth.  Other than that....fantabulous!

I love this recipie. I omitted the onion and chicken base, and used 3/4 cup cream, it was fantastic! The ultimate comfort food, very simliar to a "popular italian restuarant" I think everyone knows what that is. I would give this recipie more stars if I could, thanks!!

I thought tasted very CLOSE to the restaurant's zuppa toscana.  M husband LOVED it and my mom raved about it too.  I will drain the grease from the bacon next time and I might add more cream.  Yummy...I don't even get any left-overs! :-(

This really reminded me of a soup I had once at an italian restaurant.  It was easy to prepare (my smoked sausage was pre-cooked, but I warmed it up before putting it in the soup).  I think it would be perfect on a cold night, with a loaf of crusty bread and a salad.  Mine came out just a tad too salty, but I think it was my fault...I used chicken bouillon, next time I will use actual broth instead, because I think the smoked sausage gives the soup a lot of salty taste, too.  I may try this in the crockpot this fall, just so it's ready when I get home from work.  Great recipe!!

This soup is wonderful. My family and i love it very much. I love to make it mostly in the autumn and winter time because it just warms you right up! For a kick, use spicy italian sausage instead of plain smoked, and add some red pepper flakes. it's great with breadsticks, or even rice :) I also like to add the Kale last to keep it a vibrant green. :)

The best with modifications! I love the restaurant's soup...this is very close & maybe even better! I used Cajon-style andouille sausage and spinach because that is what I had. I also halved the recipe because I was cooking for two. I fried up three pieces of bacon, kept all the grease,sauteed 4 small sliced red potatos (with skin) in the grease then put them off to the side. Then I sauteed  2 sliced sausages, removed, then the onions until almost white and then 4 cloves of minced garlic. While  cooking the onions, I put the potatoes, sausage and 1 14.5 oz. can of  chicken broth to simmer on the stove. I would say I simmered them for about 20 minutes  adding the onions & garlic once they were sauteed. Then I added almost 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, 1/4 skim milk, one piece of bacon crumbled, a handful of fresh spinach, and some fresh ground mixed pepper. VERY good, the sausage made it extra spicy, some may like it blander; I enjoyed the kick :)

Perfect (except just a bit too salty for my taste)!  I made this soup for a "SOUPer Bowl" party/contest and it won out of 6 different soups.  I used half hot italian sausage and half sweet italian sausage and cooked it in a skillet instead of the oven.  I think used a tad less onion.  I patted the bacon and sausage with a paper towel to soak up some of the excess grease before adding it to the soup.  That cut down on the orange grease that ends up floating on top which another reviewer mentioned. Next time I think I'll reduced the soup base just a bit to decrease the saltiness.

This is a thicker and heartier version of the Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana, but it's still excellent.  Instead of smoked sausage, I used mild Italian sausage.  And I left out the onions.  Turned out fantastic.  Will be making this again and again!

I have made this soup dozens of times and have experimented with variations each time.  Someone once told me to use dry ranch dressing mix instead of the cream to cut down on a lot of the calories.  It sounds bizarre but had very little taste difference and might even be preferred!  I add two packages to the soup as a substitute for the cream.  If I want it a little thicker, I just make a cornstarch/water thickening and slowly add that to it as well.  

Another variation is to use califlower instead of potatoes if you are on a low-carb diet.  I prefer potatoes but friends have said that they actually like the califlower better!  

The last tip is to use real bacon pieces.  Not the dried kind but the moist "real" bacon kind that is sold right next to it in the salad stuff isle.  Cuts down on ALOT of fat, messy hands and time.  I throw in an entire bottle of the stuff.  

I also can never get my hands on kale.  I substitute spinach...do you think cabbage is better?  I had never thought of using that.  I use the spinach that is sold in bags next to the bagged salad.

I made this last night because I wanted to make something special and warm since we had an unexpected snow (Yes, in late April). My fiance is the pickiest of picky eaters, yet he loves the Olive Garden Soup, and this - he ate almost the whole pot! I also made a lasagna which never got touched because he filled up on soup. For mine, I did make two small changes in that I used crumbled bulk sausage instead of links, and I used straight chicken broth instead of the soup base, and it still turned out divine. Very hearty, and perfect. I was told it is the best soup I've ever made. Thank you, Nancy!

My fiancee, dad, mom, friends, and I loe this soup. You cannot go wrong serving it- unless your guest is on a diet! I made some minor changes though. I used spicy italian sausage. I also used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of chicken substitute along with the 1 quart of water.

This soup is *perfect* for a snowy day!  The only things I did differently were to cook the onion, bacon, sausage and garlic together to make it easier and I didn't bother taking out the bacon.  Plus we live overseas and didn't have kale so I substituted cabbage.  This was devine!  Living in Saudi Arabia though I sure missed the SNOW to go with it!

Absolutely Wonderful!!! Both my husband and I love this soup at the Olive Garden.  This recipe tastes exactly like it if you add crushed red pepper while cooking the sausage.  I like it a bit soupier so I used 3 cans of chicken broth plus 1 qt of water and 2 boullions cubes. Also used more heavy whipping cream.  Gotta go, my next batch is almost ready.

Very tasty! For the sausage, I use Italian.  Also, this can be made fairly low carb if you use chunks of cauliflower instead of potato.

Another big hit!  This recipe was really simple to make.  I didn't know if I'd care for it, as I've never tried the 'restaurant' version of this, but it was fantastic.  I did use bulk Italian sausage instead of what the recipe called for, and I added more potatoes..and although the kale was really good in this recipe, I would even give fresh spinach a try!  Overall a great soup recipe!

Thanks Nancy for this fantastic recipe! I made it for my guests this Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews.  I sauteed my onions and garlic in olive oil since my Italian sausage was very lean.  I also used half hot and half sweet sausage.  I prepared the soup the day before and on Thanksgiving day I justed heated it and added the cream. This is definitely a clone of the "real thing"!Thanks, again!

This soup was excellent. This is my favorite soup from the Olive Garden and it tasted just like it.  I modified the recipe by using 4 potatos, Bob Evans Italian Sausage (used about 3/4 pound and is was still a little much), 3 slices of bacon and 1/2 cup of cream.  Like other posters, I would recommend doubling the potatos and using about 1/2 of the meat.

This soup has the same taste as the one at "Olive Garden".  I used Italian turkey sausage.  My first time using Kale...it really adds to the soups flavour - so don't substitute.  mmm...

delicious!! i made it for my parents who always get this soup at the restaurant and they said that this was even better! the onions got done before the bacon though..but it was fixed by removing the bacon to another pan to continue frying and continuing with the rest of the dish in the other pan. i also used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream instead of 1/3 and used italian sausage instead of smoked.  didn't use as much sausage. i'd say half the amount that was called for. fantastic.

Outstanding!! I love this soup at Olive Garden.
I used red potatoes, unpeeled and 1/2 cream. Next 
time I will use less sausage and cook the 
bacon before I add the onions. Cook the onions in the bacon drippings, otherwise the onions almost burn before the bacon is done. My husband said this could be the best dish he's ever eaten.

This is my all-time favorite soup!  I too made a few adjustments to the recipe:
1)ground italian sausage, cooked in a pan, drained and patted dry with paper towel
2)cooked the bacon seperately, drained and patted dry.  
3)used Superior Touch "Better than Bullion" soup base, it's made with real chicken meat and seems to be less salty than bullion

This recipe really is great. I use ground italian sausage (Jimmy Dean) and add a little more cream.  I've also used baby spinach instead of kale with excellent results.  Even people who don't normally like spinach, love this soup.  A real comfort food in the winter.

My family calls it happy soup. It's one of my favorite things to eat! I use ground turkey sausage (hot) and WAY more heavy whipping cream and kale than the recipe calls for, goya chicken bouillon packs and red pepper flakes to spice it up. If you use the pork sausage or bacon no matter what it tends to come out a little greasy. This soup is the definition of comfort food and (if there's any left) ALWAYS tastes better the next day!

I would cook the bacon separately and make it really crispy, I didn't like cooking in a pan with onions, I could make it crispy enough.

This is nothing like the restaurant version at all.  This was a greasy disaster when I tried it.  They (OG) do not use smoked sausage, they use hot Italian sausage, there are 4 more steps that are missing from the recipe & the video, that take place with this recipe in the restaurant.  How do I know you ask??  My best friend is a Chef at OG and taught me how to make it. 
I'll be posting my own recipe soon - this recipe has been shortcutted to the point of misery.  Chicken bouillon cubes - OMG, nasty!

Really good and easy to make! I used a combined amount of Hot Italian sausage crumbled and spicy andouille sausage (cut into thin slices) and it was great with the kick. Next time I will use just the hot Italian sausage (i prefer the crumbled sausage texture).

Everyone enjoyed the soup! I used spinach instead of kale and mild Italian sausage. The 3 year old thought it was too spicy, something to consider if you're making this for kids.

Yes changes made, no bacon and instead of links ground sausage was used. We loved it and will make it  over and over again. Tastes just like the famous restaurant.

It is great, and pretty easy to make.  Mine turned out a bit weird for a couple reasons, both are my fault though.  I used italian sausage (ground) instead of linked smoked sausage.  The italian sausage gave it too strong of an italian herbs flavor.  Secondly, because I'm an idiot, I had no idea what heavy whipping cream was.  So I got whipping cream, which I think is the same thing (?).  But because it didn't say heavy, I was worried it wouldn't be creamy enough, so I added like a whole STICK AND A HALF of melted butter.  The soup turned out yellow and really buttery.  I'm still rating as a 5 because of me being an idiot and I really think this is a great recipe if you follow it exactly.  It did turn out better the next day when reheated.  The kale softens a bit more.

This recipe needs help.  First of all you must use italian sausage.  Brown it like Hamburger. Second, use chicken broth instead of stock base and at least 6 cups.  Increase the cream to 1/2 to 3/4 cup. 2 large russet potatoes. I used 4 large redskins.  Give the kale longer to wilt unless you like it crunchy.  Lastly black pepper to taste.

I always substitute fresh spinach for the kale. I also add about 6 oz. of Velveeta cheese, and a good handful of shredded Parmesan cheese before serving. And don't forget butter garlic Italian bread as a side. Yummy...

Very delicious soup. I made one change  I added Italian Sausage and I didn’t skimp on it; instead of sausage links. It was great like Olive Garden.

Followed the recipe down to the ingredients except I added chopped ham bits instead of bacon as my foodies prefer to eat lighter on the fat scale. And I used a Sicilian sausage from Trader Joes.

We LOVE this recipe! I make it every couple months. 

I do make a couple adjustments, though.
1. 1 tube Jimmy Dean sausage (instead of smoked sausage links)
2. Bake the bacon
3. Brown the sausage in the pot. When sausage is about half done, add the chopped onion. 
4. Proceed as directed.

I also keep homemade frozen chicken stock by the quart, so I use that instead of soup base. I tend to add more water and more cream than the recipe calls for.  Basically, I follow the measurements, then add a little more of each until it looks right to me.  (typically about 3 more cups water and just a little extra cream.)

This is a family favorite for us and I've made many times. I've switched up the style of sausage (kids like kielbasa best), and the style of potatoes (only 2 out of 5 liked sweet potatoes), sometimes bacon sometimes not, spinach is better than bitter kale, fat free half n half works great to make it creamy. I don't follow all the complicated steps (it just takes too long!) but simplify.

My husband adores this soup at Olive Garden and he thought this was better!  I used ground, mild Italian sausage and browned it in a skillet.  It was so meaty I added 2 more cups of broth. Excellent recipe!  I will make it many many re times.

Excellent just the way it is! I made it differently the next and will change and tweak again. I only had Wegmans mild sausage with casings removed and browned then onions in large dutch oven. Added  1T-2T Italian seasonings, 2qts low sodium chicken stock,2 knoor chicken base pods, 1 bag frozen Idaho diced cut potatoes to save time and rest of ingredients. Tomorrow will add thinly sliced small red potatoes and more chicken stock to thin the broth. No matter how you make it, exactly as the recipe or change it up a bit...it's so delicious! Hubby loves it too!! Thank you!

I followed the suggestions of others and fried the bacon by itself, drained the grease then sautéed  the onion and garlic in the pan.  In a large pot, I browned spicy hot Italian sausage, removed it from the pot and drained the grease.  I added the chicken base/water to the pot with quartered potatoes and cooked for 20 minutes until the potatoes were tender then added all the other ingredients and cooked for an additional 10 minutes.  Delish!

We subbed cauliflower for the potatoes, then used a touch of corn starch to thicken slightly. No one could tell! We used regular ground turkey sausage and also added thyme and some red pepper flakes to our taste.

I really liked this recipe. I cubed the potatoes instead of slicing. I think there was way too much sausage in it. Next time I will used ground sausage instead and reduce the amount.

Absolutely a keeper!  I only substituted spicy turkey sausage for the smokies and used half and half instead of the heavy cream.
Served with asiago baguette bread. It was a meal in itself.
Will make again and again.

I have tried a variety of Tuscan style soups but i think this is our favorite.  I enjoy the kale because it still has some texture to it after its been cooked.  I've made it a couple of times now, and have made some modifications.  I used a can of coconut milk in place of heavy cream, as we're dairy free.  I also used homemade chicken stock rather than water and used plain ground pork with 1 Tbsp of homemade Italian sausage seasoning instead of smoked sausage links.

A tasty recipe & easy to change/enhance to  your liking. I used chicken broth instead of H20, 4 cloves garlic, 4 cups kale,  unpeeled sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes, & added 1 1/2 cups H20 b/c of increased qty of vegies.

Exactly what I was craving.  I used Italian sausage, as I don't like smoked sausage.  I buy precooked bacon, so saved a little fat there, and I used chicken stock for a richer flavored broth.  Otherwise, sans the salt (already in the stock I used), I used the same proportions as the recipe.  Was delicious with garlic bread and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes on a rainy northwest evening!  Only gave it 4 stars because recipes I review only get 5 if I make it exactly as written AND it's delicious.

This is an awesome recipe, but I've made it so much I don't even use the recipe anymore.  It's hard to mess this one up and my kids LOVE this.  I use mild Italian sausage packaged like hamburger, instead of links.  It makes it much easier to brown and I can cook everything only dirtying one pot.  Also, I add black pepper to taste and I use half and half instead of heavy cream--you can't even tell the difference.  I sometimes use the water as directed, but just as often will use chicken broth only.  And I stuff handfuls of kale in the pot to make the soup good and hardy.  Definitely a house favorite!

I used hot sausage  which gave it a bit spicier.  I thought the kale would cook up quicker than it did.  We thought it would taste more like Olive Garden's but it didn't.  Also thought there was alot of fat in the recipe with the bacon and the sausage.  I might try it again but substitute turkey sausage & bacon and maybe 2% milk for the heavy creme.  I might also try spinach instead of the kale.

This recipe was really easy and so good! It tastes just like the one at Oive Garden. The only thing I did differently was sauté the onions separate from the bacon (bacon first, then the onions in the bacon grease). Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was amazing!!

I chose to make this 'copycat' soup as it is my husband's favorite at the restaurant that makes it.  The recipe looked good but I tend to tweak soups for our own personal tastes.  I used our own hot Italian sausages that dear hubby made.  (Only four as hubby was liberal with the chile peppers!).  Just removed the casings and cooked in some of the bacon fat with the onions, veggies and then garlic.  Used more onion and garlic and I also added some celery, carrots, and an extra potato for extra veggies, flavour and color.  I added a generous couple of teaspoons of Italian seasoning and parsley flakes.  I used 6 cups of broth and at least a 1/2 cup of coffee cream.  I also added extra chicken boulion to taste.  I added the chopped kale towards the end and then the cream.  This soup smelled heavenly as it simmered and had everyone drooling by the time supper was served.  The soup met everyone's expectations and tasted great!!!

I love smoked sausage but I think this recipe has too much smoked sausage. A little black pepper added is nice. I used whole milk instead of cream to lighten it up a bit. I also used red potatoes and left their skins on. It's filling on a cold day. I am giving it five stars because I didn't follow directions to a T.

I've made this soup many, many times and it has always been a huge success!  So much so that at one dinner gathering, our guests had bowl after bowl, not wanting to even start on the main course!

I'm so glad to have this recipe beings that it is my husband's favorite soup and now I can make it more healthy at home.  I used chicken hot Italian sausage without nitrites,  no bacon, and milk instead of cream.  I also added some fennel seed.  This soup was so good, we both just kept eating and eating it!

I made this soup today and it was awesome! This is a keeper. I used frozen spinach and added 1 chopped zucchini because that was what I had. I did not add cream yet. But I will definitely try the cream in the next bowl. NOTE: If you add zucchini, add it in at the end so that it doesn't get mushy like mine did.

I use Turnip leaves from my garden instead of Kale. It still tastes very delicious. The first time I made this soup I didn't include any meat. The second time I put in the bacon (I'm not a fan of sausage) and what a difference. Man, I'm in love with this soup! So simple to make and half the ingredients are in my garden :)

This tasted just like a famous Italian restaurant's soup. It was super yummy. I followed reviewer  "RogueOnion8" 's suggestions except I used 1 lb regular  mild Italian sausage. I will use half spicy, half mild (2 lbs from market) as he suggested next time if I double the recipe  - I don't like my food too meaty but if you do it wouldn't hurt to increase the amount of sausage without doubling the recipe. I added a little but more kale than the recipe called for because I added extra water per RogueOnion8's advice and it looked like it needed more substance.

This recipe was great.  I didn't change the ingredients at all.  The only thing I did differently was cook the bacon and onion in the oven.  I turned the oven up to 400F and put the bacon and chopped onion on a foil-lined cookie sheet and baked it for 15-20 minutes. I hate cooking bacon in a pan; the oven is way less work. :)  This soup was fantastic!

I like it a little more hearty, so i added more potatoes.  Added more whipping cream to get the white color in soup. Also when I brown the sausage i leave it on paper towel to soak up more grease(if I don't, we get more orange color to the soup and leftovers will have thin layer of grease on top).
Used Chicken stock instead of the cubes.  Kale is a must, i dont much care for kale but it adds to the soup.  Whole family loves it, gave the recipe to several other family members and friends!

Don't go by the star rating on this review!! The written directions and the video directions are different. Video tells you to cook bacon and drain on a paper towel and then cook the onions in the bacon drippings. You can also use Spinach if you don't like Kale.

Delish! I omit the bacon and it tastes just like the soup at Olive Garden, I don't think they put bacon in theirs. I also do not use chicken stock just use plain water there is enough flavor in the sausage and no need for extra sodium.

Instead of regular bacon I used turkey bacon and instead of the link sausages I used one roll of all natural pork sausage. This soup was amazing. My family said it tasted better than olive gardens. Add a dash of Italian seasoning and  basil seasoning and your good to go. I Also topped it off with Parmesan cheese before serving.

This is a go-to in our family.  I make it almost weekly in the fall/winter.  I substitute ground sausage for the smoked because we like the flavor more.  I also use whole milk instead of cream because we always have it on hand. The soup is still nice and creamy.  A great way to get your kids to enjoy kale!

The flavor is exactly like Olive Garden's soup of the same name.  HOWEVER: chicken base is super salty and 2 tablespoons are waaaay too much. (how about 2 teaspoons?) Otherwise, it's a good interpretation of this famous soup.

I have made this recipe several times and, like many others on here, have made a few revisions.  I use 1 lb of ground italian sausage in lieu of the links.  I start out by cooking the bacon (I buy the thick kind from the butcher) in the oven for about 15 minutes at 400 because it lets it crisp up rather nicely.  At the same time, I cook the sausage stove-top.  I reserve the sausage and saute the onions and garlic in the sausage grease.  Then, I add the potatoes (I usually use 5 or 6 smaller red potatoes and do not skin them), chicken broth, and 6 cups of water (1.5 quarts).  I also add a little black pepper.  After about 10 minutes, I add the sausage and the bacon back into the soup which allows for more of the flavor in the broth.  I still add the kale and cream and simmer for about four minutes.  With a couple of revisions, this wonderful soup is made even better and has become a staple in our house!

I made a lighter version of this soup by cooking onions in olive oil and cooking bacon separately crisp and drained. I used a little smoke flavor to sub for the bacon dripping. I also used low fat half and half. Delish

Used smoked turkey sausage, so I cooked it per the instructions by boiling it for 10-12 min. and let it cool before cutting. It was still just spicy enough to taste nearly as close at the restaurant version. 
Found the recipe to be quite easy to prepare. Will likely make this one again.

Great recipe, thank you for sharing.  Left out the bacon (only bc we had just had it for breakfast).  Made it a day ahead, to let flavors meld... but didn't add greens until just before serving.  Perfect with a ham and rolls on Christmas Day.

Oh my gosh, wonderful!  I did make a couple of small changes, but only because I didn't have all of the right ingredients.  I used turkey Italian sausage in place of the smoked sausage, and fat-free half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I cooked the bacon separately, poured off most of the bacon fat, and sauteed the onions in that fat.  I cooked the sausage in with the onions.  My husband and I loved this!!

Excellent soup. Wife and kids loved it. Kids really liked it which was surprising since they are kinda picky. I would agree with some of the other reviews, if I did it again I would cook the bacon seperate and drain the grease as it could be a little rich for some people.

This soup turned out amazing!  My husband and kids loved it too! What a great way to get greens into your family! I used Hot Chicken sausage instead of regular - just a preference.  At the end, I tasted the soup - amazing flavor - and decided that it didn't need the cream.  Probably great both ways!

I made it today and burned my onions because I put them in with the bacon like the recipe said, next time I think I will cook them separate. Still delicious though.

I enjoyed this recipe... And, I chose to make a PALEO version.  No need to reduce fat for paleo... ;)
I cooked the bacon first, and then cooked the onion in the rendered fat.  Instead of cream,  I used coconut milk, and instead of potatoes, I used sweet potatoes!  I also doubled the Kale... packed 4 cups! Touch of red pepper flakes, and some Trocomare ... YUM!!!!

I prefer using Italian sausage in place of both meats in the recipe. I cook and brown the Italian sausage. Remove to drain most of the fat. Then cook onions and garlic per recipe. If needed I add a bit of olive oil to the onions while they are cooking.  Then make the recipe as per directions.  Sometimes I will add crushed red peppers for those that like a bit of spice to the soup.

I make this soup with regularity and my family loves it...for those who enjoy having a little zip in this soup, try adding some Italian Seasonings and chili flakes to take it up a notch.

Probably the best soup I've ever had. I used already cooked Ekrich smoked sausage which I split and put in the broiler for about 7 minutes to crisp. Also used way more broth than called for, swanson's.

I make this all the time. For my own personal preference, I only use one small link of Italian sausage because I don't like Italian sausage, but the soup is simply not the same without it. I use very little kale, too. Even my kids love this soup!

It was delicious, but mine turned out way spicy! Must have been the type of Italian sausage I chose (which said mild, but I guess it wasn't), so I'm not faulting the recipe for it. I subbed chard for kale since that's what I had on hand. Hubby and I liked it, kids did not, so 4 stars based on adult rating (I think kids would like it better if the spice level was lower, again, my fault, so worth another try).

Soup was very good, but a lot of meat!  I ended up doubling the soup recipe, except for the sausage (stayed with 16oz) and I tripled the kale amount.  Next time I will omit the bacon.  Was very tasty, def a keeper!!

We have had this soup in many forms. We have used breakfast sausage in a pinch, with or without bacon, spinach in place of kale (the kale holds up better), added pasta in addition to or instead of the potatoes. We actually prefer it without the heavy cream. Thanks for the delicious recipe! :o)

This soup is great! I also added 1.5 qrts of water (instead of 1), 1 pound of "spicy Italian ground sausage" (instead of smoked sausage), + 2 zucchinis, spinach (instead of kale), + 1 cup of mushrooms. 

Really great soup!

My apologies to Nancy. I made this into a vegetable dish. I tripled the amount of kale, only 2 sausages, a dash of chicken broth and splash of half n half. Cooked it down. Very nice, thank you!

One of our favorite soup recipes.  I've used spinach and kale, it works well with both.  We smoke our own hot sausage and this is a perfect way to use it.

This is fantastic! Since my husband doesn't eat pork I used 6 strips of lox in place of the bacon. I also used baby spinach instead of Kale since that is what I had on hand. I used Anduye sausage and I was afraid it might be too spicy, but the cream cut the spice and it was perfect!

Doubled the recipe for my large family.  Follwed the directions, except used cooked ground pork sausage instead of smoked sausage. EVERYONE raved about it including the 3 kids who were a bit nervous at the appearance (the green kale).  This will definitely go on our favorites list!

My favorite soup! It looked like there is not enough liquid, so added about 2 cups more of water and little more 1/2 and 1/2. I used Hot Italian Sausages and it came out Hot, but I like it.

This recipe is the best! I make it so much I don't even need the recipe anymore. I did make a few changes: I don't usually add any bacon and I cook the sausage and onions with about 2 cloves of minced garlic to give it an extra kick. I think that the sausage you choose can make or break this soup. I use New York style hot Italian sausage rolls-it gives the soup the best flavor and makes it taste just like the restaurants. Excellent soup, everyone who tries it loves it!

I made this because my husband likes this soup at the Olive Garden.  Unfortunately I think the Olive Garden's soup is much better.

We used bulk elk sausage - but other than that left the recipe as is. It was amazing! I had a hard time not hoarding the leftovers throughout the week - one the most enjoyable soups I made this winter.

This was really good. Next time I would like to try Polska Kielbasa because the Smoked Sausage I used was really salty. Also, my kidlet's potato plant died outside after a freeze. After digging it up, we had about 6 mini potatoes to equal out the 2 potatoes needed for the recipe. She was quite proud.

This is incredible. The changes I made were to use fat free half and half instead of the cream, hot italian sausage, and I threw in an extra cup of kale. I used chicken bullion cubes, which I think I would use less of next time as the bacon & sausage make this quite salty enough. I had lots of leftovers, and it was just lovely as a dinner on a late night at work. Thank you so much!

This recipe is awesome. The substitutes I made were trying to have a little less calories but not changing the taste.  I used hot turkey sausage for smoked sausage because in the resturant they use hot italian sausage. Can't even tell the difference between turkey sausage and italian sausage I also used chicken broth instead of water and soup base.  It tasted so like the resturant soup.  Next time I am going to substitute fat free half & half for the cream.

THIS IS A GOOD RECIPE, I DID MODIFY IT,  I USED GROUND ITALIAN SASUAGE INSTEAD OF SMOKED SASUAGE, I ALSO USED RED POTATOES AND LEFT THE SKIN ON. THIS SOUP TASTE JUST LIKE THAT AT OLIVE GARDEN. GREAT SOUP

This was fantastic!  I will definitely add this to my repertoire. I did use my soup base, but was a little salty when I tasted it. I was out of chicken stock which I will probably use next time.I just added a little extra water and cream. I did fry the bacon first and pull it out before I sauteed the onions and garlic.  I have to admit I was a bad girl and added a tablespoon of butter.  I could eat this every day!

Just made this tonight and loved it! I used the crock pot, set it on high for 3 hours with everything except the cream, kale and bacon, I stirred those in about 5 minutes before serving. I did add about a half tsp each of crushed red pepper and ground white pepper. Zuppa Toscana is our favorite soup at O.G. and after tasting this my husband and I couldn't get over how close in taste this was! Thank you for the recipe. Next time I might try a spicy Italian sausage to give it a little more kick.

This is very good, but it didn't remind me too much of Zuppa Toscana at Olive Garden, maybe because I used sweet sausage.  And if you want 6 servings, double the water and cream.  I only got 3 servings.

This recipe was really tasty even though I've never tried the olive garden version. I did what was easy for me which meant changes. I used a can of evaporated milk, 1/3 cup of 1% milk, and 1 qt water for the liquid. I used ~6 cups baby kale and 6 small red potatoes. Instead of chicken stock, I ran out, I used 1 Tbsp chicken broth powder. Oh and I only used 3 sausage links to cut down the fat and left out the bacon. We had optional bacon bits for the table. Will definitely make again.

Outstanding. This Zuppa Toscana is better then the Zuppa Toscana you get at the restaurant.  The kids did not care for it all that much, but all the adults loved it. Definitely a keeper. No adjustments needed.

This is insanely delicious...and so easy. We used regular ground pork sausage and I added a healthy amount of basil, but otherwise followed it to a 't'. The trick to the kale, for us, is to tear it up into small pieces, but it adds a great flavor and consistency to the soup. SO good! Definitely on our weekly menu now, thanks for sharing it!

Almost like the real thing! BE CAREFUL WITH THE SALT.  Here are the changes I made . . .  1. Browned 1 lb Italian ground turkey 2. Cooked the bacon and set aside. Drained the pan of almost all of the bacon fat and then cooked the onions and garlic in that. I don't know if I would even use the bacon in the soup. I suspect that is what made it SOOOOO salty. You need to still cook the onions in the browned bits though. 3. Used 4 bouillion cubes and 6 cups of water. 4. Fat free half and half instead of cream. 5. Yukon potatoes are the best! They have the best flavor with the skins included. 6. NO EXTRA SALT. SERIOUSLY. I think the bacon might have made it too salty.

The recipe was fabulous. Everybody loved it including my picky children who won't touch soup. I used a crock pot so my cooking times differed, but it was really easy and yummy. The bacon seemed a bit soggy so I'll either leave it out next time or sprinkle it on after serving.

Great recipe.  I does taste just like Olive gardens version.  I omitted the potatoes and replaced with shrimp to make it a low carb.

Very tasty!  We were out of potatoes, so I used orzo instead (adding an extra cup of liquid to compensate for the way orzo absorbs water).  I also used ground turkey sausage, half-and-half, and some chopped frozen collards - I think any dark green will probably work.  I've never had the restaurant version, but we'll have this again!

This is a great recipe. Being calorie councious I have made a few changes. I skip the chicken stock and substitute it with water. I use 1/2 lb mild italian sausage and 1 lb hot italian sausage. I also substitute the heavy cream with milk.

Fantastic recipe!  I used smoked sausage that I cut into rings and put in the oven.  Next time I will put the bacon in the oven as well as it took so long to crisp with the onions.  I used a carton of chicken stock and added in red pepper flakes per the suggestions here.  I used three potatoes and fat free half and half instead of whipping cream.  We've never had the original, but all I can say is that this was gone quickly.  Two large servings for my husband and son so if you have a big family, double the recipe!

Fantastic! Tastes just like the 'real deal'. I used Italian sausage that comes in the plastic roll like breakfast sausage to make it more like the restaurant version. My chicken base cubes were more on the salty side, but nothing some water or stock couldn't fix. Thank you so much for posting this!!! This was the first 'like' recipe that turned out perfect!!! I'm a happy girl!

I made this using all of the suggestions mentioned in the first review of this recipe.  Using ground sausage, adding more water, and using 6 bullion cubes.  It turned out incredibly salty!  We couldn't even eat it.  My husband and I decided not to eat the left-overs.

AMAZING!!  So close to the recipe.  I could not find kale, but next time will look harder.  My DH said if it had the kale it would have been dead on!  It was great.  Next time I'll add an extra potato, but that is just preference.  YUMMY!

I'm so happy I learned how to make my favorite soup from Olive Garden. Please take my advise this tastes just like Olive Garden soup. The only thing I did different was cook the bacon in the oven for 10 to 15 mins on 400 degrees and I got shredded hot italian sausage (shredded like beef) so there was no need for the red pepper flakes and I cooked the sausage until brown and added the onions to the sausage. But Perfecto. Thank you so much

I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO GET AHOLD OF THIS RECIPE, I ORDER IT AT OLIVE GARDEN EVERY CHANCE I GET, IT TASTE GREAT! I DO THINK I WILL CUT DOWN ON THE KALE NEXT TIME, MY HUSBAND LIKED IT ALOT BUT THOUGHT IT HAD TO MUCH "FOLAGE" IN IT. HE IS NOT A BIG SOUP FAN, BUT SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS AGAIN.

Better than the Restaurant! Made the low fat version by omitting the bacon (using olive oil to saute onion) and using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream.  Also used about 6 boulion cubes!

I do not know a single person who doesn't love this soup. The taste is about as close as you can get to the restaurants. I always try to lighten things up so I used turkey bacon and sausage and fat free half and half and then added a slurry. Whatever you use, its worth your time. Great recipe!

Great!!!  I used chicken broth instead of water and spicy Italian sausage it was hearty and spicy. I followed others recommendations and cooked the bacon first, then the onions and garlic. Wonderful, I will be making this again.

Delicious.  I skipped the bacon b/c we were out and used 1 c. rice milk plus 3 T Earth Balance instead of the cream (we don't use dairy).  It was yummy.

I loved this soup! The only change I made was to use vegan sausage and bacon, other than that I left the recipe alone. And it was delicious! I say, just try it once and you'll love it!

I love this soup!  It's very quick and easy to make.  I have used bagged spinach leaves instead of kale a few times and couldn't tell the difference. Even my picky eaters enjoy this.

I like to pan cook the sausage instead of bake. I also just get the hot sausage instead of adding crushed red peppers (although I have been known to sprinkle in some more). The picture attached looks like it has way to much kale. I do not use as much. Also, two-three pieces of bacon suffice. Otherwise, this is one of my favorite soups to make at home and to eat at you know where. If only I could make those bread sticks!

It's didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it wasn't a bad recipe.  Next time I will increase the cream to 1/2 cup, remove all steams, and add salt & pepper to taste.

I was so thrilled to find my absolute favorite soup on the internet!!  However, I made a quick change.  Instead of using 12 slices of bacon, I used 10 1/8" slices of Boar's Head Pancetta.  I fried this up and cooked with the onions.  Oh, my goodness, it was absolutely delicious and my family can't wait until I make it again.

Just wish I could make Chicken Marsala like Carraba's does and would truly feel like a gourmet.

EXCELLENT!! Just tasted this soup a few weeks ago and had to see if it was on allrecipes--sure enough.  I did some of the changes others did because they worked for me or I already had the product.  Such as - chicken broth - 1/2&1/2 - Spicy Italian sausage. I shared with family that never had it before  - and they also loved it!! Thanks!! UPDATE: I just made the zuppa with a twist and it turned out fab! I used ground turkey and added the seasonings for Italian Sausage into it while frying. Also I used turkey bacon - and finally skim milk with a couple tbs. of cornstarch instead of the cream. It tasted marvelous!! I suppose you could tell the difference if you put them side by side - but it is quite a bit less fattening.  Also - I do the "Eat Right 4 Your Blood Type" so I was able to make this work for me and my husband and not give up my favorite soup. Oh ya - I double this soup and freeze it in cottage cheese or lg. yogurt containers - just enough for two people.

I love this recipe; simple and delicious.    I like to use ground italian sausage and just brown it in the pot with the bacon and onions- fewer dishes to clean up.  Leaving the sausage in for the entire cooking time seems to let the flavors blend a little better, too.  Goes great with sourdough bread. Yum!

A wonderful soup!!!  I always get recipe requests when I make it.  I use 16 oz. of ground sausage (Hot Italian when I make it for my husband and Sweet Italian when I make it for others who can't stand the heat) and brown that first.  I skim the fat, save for a tablspoon and I cook the onion in that.  I omit the bacon because it gets way soggy sitting in the broth. I also add a few scant teaspoons of dried basil, parsley, and oregano.  Maybe a shake or two of pepper. And I use chicken broth from a can instead of the "base."  Enjoy the soup!!! Make sure to chop the kale into small bits.....no one likes to find large leaves in her soup!

Very good!  I used ground spicy sausage.  I would recommend putting the onions after removing the bacon instead of at the same time.  I put them in the same time and my onions were done way before the bacon was.  Otherwise, great soup!

Excellent recipe! I took the advice of using ground sausage half mild and half hot. And also used a little more cream than suggested. It turned out perfect! I made this for my work cook-off and I won with this soup! Everyone loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

Good, but not great.  I only made it one time and pureed the soup because I looking for a certain texture.  Not sure I'll make it again, though.

We love this soup!  It is very much like one at Olive Garden.  I serve this for dinner with cinammon toast for a warm, comforting meal.

Very good!  We used veggie bacon cooked in the microwave, and both times we made it, it turned out really well.  We also substituted in light cocunut milk instead of heavy cream this last time, and it was delicious!  I also added some sliced mushrooms towards the end each time and added in bite-sized pieces of cooked chicken the first time as well.

I did everything wrong and it was still terrific -- even better the next day.  I didn't have Italian sausage so I used loose Andouille -- worked great, slightly on the spicy side.  I was distracted and misread the recipe.  I cooked all the meat and onions together, added garlic, then the organic chicken broth, potatoes, kale & cream. I don't think there is any way to mess this up unless it would be not making enough for lots of leftovers! Yummy!

Oh my God!!  This is the best soup ever!!!  I doubled the recipe and am so glad I did.  Even my four year old loved this!  I took another reviewers advice and (with doubling) used 1 c. heavy cream, 12 boulion cubes, and 3 qts of water.   Used ground italian sausage and it was excellent.   Just excellent!!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

This soup is so good on a cold winter day. I used Hot Italian Sausage instead of the polish sausage and I liked that much better. I browned it in the pot and then continued with the rest of the recipe. It was even better the next day.

This soup is pretty simple. At 'the popular Italian restaurant,' (hereafter TPIR) where I work, it's also clearly the favorite.

I'd recommend getting ground italian sausage instead of the links if you're imitating TPIR. Most home chicken stocks are going to have a lighter feel than the TPIR stock base, too, so address that as you feel necessary.

Finally, if you're a TPIR completist, there's the cheese - find a low-moisture romano in a block and grate it. Mosts guests seem to think the cheese in the graters is parmesan, but it's not.

Alright, back to the pasta mines for me ...

As is, I would give this recipe 3 stars, because there is too much sausage and way too little broth. But thanks to this recipe, I've been playing with it and have gotten a great version that we love. So 4 stars it is.

So good! I doubled it for a family of 3/4. Plus, so I could have some for lunch the next day. I also served with focaccia and dipped it into my soup. You can also substitute chard or other greens for the kale if your grocer is like mine and didn't have any. A good short cut is to buy the bacon already cooked so that you only have to nuke it and crumble.

absolutely wonderful!  Only things I changed were to use spinach inplace of kale, ground itallian sausage and used chicken broth insted of water and chicken base.  Just as good as the restaurant!

I made this before I read many of the reviews and it looks like most people made this with Italian sausage instead of the smoked sausage that it calls for in the recipe. I think I will try that next time. Overall, the recipe was tasty, but I used smoked turkey sausage, which had a mild kielbasa flavor and it got a little lost in the soup. I would have liked something with a little more zip. 
This was my first time cooking kale and I was pleasantly surprised at the nice texture and flavor -- since it is so healthy, I thought for sure it would taste bad!

Rich and wonderful!!! I omited the bacon and used itallian sausage (don't like soggy bacon).  I cooked the onion and sausage in a tablespoon or so of bacon drippings for flavor, adding the garlic at the last minute.  Followed the recipe as directed from that point on. So quick and easy to make...definately a keeper!

Everything great. I added Broccoli, and used an entire can of chicken stock (as substitute for same amount of water). This recipe has a nice broth to ingredient ratio. Well done, and thank you.

This is a really tasty recipe, but super salty!  Next time I'll add only one tablespoon of chicken paste.  I used red potatoes and tons of black pepper as well as a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  Oh, and I used spicy Italian turkey sausage.

Delicious! I didn't like the bacon bits in the soup since they got soggy. I used spicy italian sausage (casings removed)instead of sausage and used 3 medium potatoes. Simmer for an extra 10 minutes to make sure all flavors blend in well.

My husband orders this soup all the time at a well known place.  He thought it was better!!! I did add more potato and I steamed the kale in the microwave for 3 1/2 minutes before I added it to the soup. This is definately a keeper.

This recipe turned out so good! I served it with french bread, topped with herbed olive oil & baked in the oven, with salad on the side. Great dinner!

I made this for my Mom and daughter, who both love the restaurant soup.  They loved it and I thought it was o.k.  Next time I make it I will use chicken broth instead of the soup base, because I thought it was too salty.  Overall though it was right on.

This was a truly authentic taste of Tuscany soup!  I used hot turkey sausage, and added fresh garlic, sliced carrots, white beans, chopped broccoli rabe and the greens instead of kale, and some grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  We could not get enough of this soup on a rainy, cold, winter night!

The soup was yummy!  I added a few more potatoes and used two different kind, red and purple potatoes.  It was a fantastic soup.  Very much like TOG's Zuppa Toscana.  Would definately make this soup again.

This was really yummy! Next time I will use half the sausage--there was just way too much--and maybe half the bacon too. I think I'll also add more kale. I added a few crushed red pepper flakes for some kick because I used mild Italian sausage.

Great recipe.  I added red pepper flakes, salt (though that probably depends on the soup base you use) and also used fat free half and half instead of the cream to lighten it up a bit, homemade Italian sausage instead of the smoked sausage, and it turned out wonderfully.

Yum!  This soup was terrific.  Used a half cup of heavy cream, and crumbled sweet italian sausage with some red pepper flakes.  Also, drained the bacon and kept only ~1tsp of grease to cook the onions.  This soup is incredibly good!

This soup was fabulous. It does taste similar to the soup served at the "well known" restaurant! The only thing I changed was after baking, I removed the casings and crumbled the sausge, which is how the soup is served at the restaurant. I also omit the kale, just for personal preference.

When I go to OG, this is just about the only thing that I'll eat there. So, I'd say that I know this soup better than any other! This soup resembled the Zuppa Toscana from OG in some ways, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it tasted *just* like it. If I try this again, I'll substitute the smoked sausage with ground italian. It also seemed to be missing something else... I like the suggestion someone else made of adding some crushed red peper. Maybe that'll do it.

This recipe makes a delicious, hearty and very pretty soup.  The next time I make it, however, I will cook the bacon first and remove the bacon grease, keeping just a tablespoon to use in cooking the onions, just to cut down a bit on the fat content.  I liked the addition of kale -- a good way to get some healthy greens into your kids!

This recipe is so amazing.  It is a little time consuming with all the chopping (I hate to chop ingredients, so that is just me), but it is so worth it.  I make a double batch and freeze it in individual bowls.  I just heat it up when I am ready for a hot bowl of good soup.

Terrific recipe! Very flavorful. I used Italian sausage (half hot-half sweet), half and half instead of heavy cream, and added 4 cups kale instead of 2 because we really like greens. Using imported grated romano cheese at the end is awesome. Definitely going to make it again soon.

I love this soup.  It's so easy to make, and it results in a hearty, flavourful dinner.  I took the sausage out of it's casing, and fried it up with the diced bacon.  I think it saved a lot of time in the prep work.  I also only added light cream rather than whipping cream, and it was still delicious.

Awesome....  This is a must try.  I did use four cans of chicken broth instead of the water and chicken base, and I added a bit more cream.  Just like the restaurant's.  Make sure there is enough for seconds (and maybe thirds.)  FIVE BIG STARS

This soup has a great flavor-very savory.  Next time I will only use half as much bacon and sausage; thought it was too greasy and a bit too salty.  Also, I will use sweet, bulk Italian sausage, crumble and brown it in a separate pan and drain it very well before I add it to rest of soup--sliced sausage too big for soup.

This is the best soup ever.  My husband's co-workers will attest to it.  My four year old son loved it.

I thought this soup was amazing!  It is so close to the "famous" version.  As some people said, I fried the bacon alone and then cooked the onions in the bacon grease.  I also used hot itallian sausage as the soup does have a little spice to it when you get it at the restaurant and I believe they use itallian sausage in theirs.  The only things I will do differently next time is add less sausage and more potatos and kale.  The potatos really soak up all the flavor.  I did add a little more water, cream and chicken stock to mine because I like more broth and the soup seemed more chunky than it usually is and it did not disturb the flavor of the soup at all.  If you love the restaurant soup you should really give this recipe a try.

Was real close to the famous one.  My family loves it but there is still somthing missing, cant put my finger on it.  Maybe the watery-ness of the broth?  But I still gave it 4 stars cause it was good!!

Excellent!! Ever since I had this at the restaurant I've been wanting to create it at home!! This is so-o good. I made this for my family this week and they went crazy over it. I doubled the recipe to the exception of the meat.I used Italian sausage as that *IS* what the restaurant uses. (I used a pound and a half but I think it probably could have turned out great with even just a pound}.If I were to do anything at all to it, I may try adding more Kale & potatoes{as we loved it!!}. But since I haven't tried that as such I'm not sure if it would compromise the overall taste of the soup or not. To viewers looking, try this soup {using Italian sausage for meat}. You'll LOVE it!!

This recipe was delicious.  What made it so great was that so many of you hve tweaked the recipe.  I followed  the advice/changes that you all have made.  I was worried that  I had made to much and that it would end up being tossed out.  To my surprise it was so enjoyed there wasn't a drop left.

This tastes very similar to the zuppa toscana at the Olive Garden.
