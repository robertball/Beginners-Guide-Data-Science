Loved it!! This was so quick and easy to make, my husband couldn't believe I was serving it for lunch. It's very flavorful--I did use 3 T curry powder instead of just 2, and I used 1 c packed fresh spinach instead of frozen. I served it with rice. I will definitely make this again!

Super flavorful! Creamy, delicious, hearty. I had fire roasted canned tomatoes and they were perfect. Served it with pita chips. Could also go with rice or naan.  Will make again.
