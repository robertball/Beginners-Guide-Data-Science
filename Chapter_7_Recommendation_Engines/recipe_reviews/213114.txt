Pizza eggs! You know, I've been making these ever since I heard about it from my favorite show, Weeds. One of my most favorite breakfasts since then and my kids especially go nuts over this. My husband likes his with leftover meat lovers, my kids like theirs with leftover pepperoni but me? I like it with leftover veggie pizza. I don't add italian seasoning to mine but it's all a matter of taste and what you prefer. Really yummy treat for the morning. NOTE: I do not take the toppings off my pizza. I just cut up the whole piece and warm it in the pan with a little butter before adding the eggs. If you do this, you might find that one piece will be plenty.

OMG - who knew pizza and eggs could make such a wonderful combination! This was so good and what a great way to use up leftover pizza - besides the obvious of just eating cold or reheating it and eating it. I omitted the oil as I never cook my eggs in oil, but other than that I didn't change a thing. We had leftover sausage and pepperoni pizza and boy was this an unexpected treat. You could easily but this inside a tortilla for a really awesome breakfast wrap! This recipe is a definite keeper!

1st time I heard of this was on the tv show weeds. Love it and gives me something to do with the left over pizza cause the crust gets to nasty on the 2nd day to eat. I sometimes add a little extra pizza sauce into the eggs too.

We never have left over pizza in my house for very long as we are pizza fanatics, it usually doesn't survive until morning as someone gets up in the night and eats.  But I make homemade pizza often so I usually have a lot of pizza toppings, I just threw in some of my homemade sauce, some cheese, some turkey pepperoni and onions, green peppers, black olives and mushrooms...to taste...was delicious, doesn't really require looking at a recipe though, but this is something I will make a lot in the future.

This was good, and a great way to use up leftover pizza. I used red pepper flakes instead of black pepper, didn't use the salt, and added a bit of garlic powder. I agree that you probably don't need the Italian seasoning like the other reviewer said. Served with a side of green habanero sauce and mmmmmm, I'm in heaven. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I saved a piece of pizza just to make this recipe. I cut the entire slice up into small pieces (except the hard crust) and because of the size of my slice I made the recipe using 2 eggs and used my judgment on the rest of the ingredients and didn't have to make a side of toast. It is really good! Thanks Stephanie.

DELICIOUS!  I used the toppings from a leftover Super Supreme pizza and the eggs were SO delicious!  I didn't use any milk or oil though.  They turned out perfect!  I used 6 eggs and the toppings from half of a large pizza.  Perfect quantities!

I love cold pizza for breakfast and I love eggs - just never thought of cooking the two together.  I read with interest about this recipe on "thebuzz".  I had leftover Tuscany Chicken Pizza and decided to give it a try.  The dish had a lot of flavor and I ate it with fresh tomato slices.  It was interesting - I still love the two ingredients, but enjoy them best individually.  Thanks smurrile for sharing your creative recipe.

Don't toss the crusts. Heat in oven or toaster oven until crunchy. Perfect "toast" for this dish!

What a great way to use up last night's pizza! The only things I did differently were that I didn't throw away the naked crusts. I toasted them in my toaster oven and served them on the side. Probably should have sprinkled them with Parmesan first...next time.  Also, I didn't use any extra spices, salt or pepper. I served with crushed red pepper flakes and salsa on the side.  Also, we used a "supreme" pizza with tons of toppings. Wish there were leftovers!

Wish I had known about this recipe back in my Army days haha! This was tasty! I did substitute a little half and half for milk (I was out) but it got the job done.

I made it and it was good. My son wouldn't try it though because he didn't like how it looked. I didn't scrape the pizza. I cut 3 slices of pizza into small pieces and removed the crust. I used 3 T of milk and added some bacon bits and mozzarella cheese. I used 6 eggs and followed the rest of the directions.

My boyfriend broke one of his crowns while eating leftover pizza.  It pretty much ruined his day.  Enter pizza eggs.   Soft enough for someone with a busted tooth, and he was able to vanquish the pizza that broke his crown.  Thank you pizza eggs!

Such a simple idea, and awesome use of leftovers! Think about it, what would you eat on a pizza that you wouldn't want in an omelette? Cheese? Meats? Veggies? It's quick and delicious!
