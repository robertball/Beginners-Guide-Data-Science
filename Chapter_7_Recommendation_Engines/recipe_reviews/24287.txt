I served this at my job's Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! I've never seen a cheeseball disappear before - but this one did. Very easy to make and a scrumptious appetizer for any special occasion.

This was an interesting idea.  We loved the addition of pickle juice.  However, as described we found the recipe too salty.  We added another brick of cream cheese and it was better.  I think the Italian dressing mix was just too salty for us.

Just like the description says...just a cheese ball.  I like my cheese balls with a little more flavor.  Recommend Cheddar and Bacon Log and Dried Beef Ball both on this site.

This recipe is great!! I made it by the recipe the first time and everyone loved it, however, like I always do I tweaked it to my liking, I used Zesty pickle juice instead and added that more zip. Thanks for the recipe...everytime I make it I have to give the recipe away.

Very simple, nothing fancy, but tastes good.
