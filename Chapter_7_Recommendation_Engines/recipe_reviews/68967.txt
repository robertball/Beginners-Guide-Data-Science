This turned out pretty well for me and it was quick! I would recommend doubling the amount of italian seasoning for more flavor. I also added in one small tomato and 2 tablespoons red wine and it tasted wonderful.

This is the perfect sidedish for any meal. My husband wanted to try a different recipe we had never had. So, I wasn't sure how to cook eggplant....But this recipe was so easy and it came out perfect. I will make it more often....NOW that I know what to do. Loved it....

This was a wonderful eggplant dish, and it was very easy to make.  Mine turned out a bit dry, so next time I will try adding tomato as another reviewer suggested.  All in all it was a great recipe... thanks!

Like the other reviews suggested I added extra Italian seasoning, and instead of just a small tomato, I used a can of Italian style diced tomatoes - little more than a small tomato (with some juice too) so each helping would have tomato. No need to be exact on measuring the onion - 2 tbsp is a little less than a half of a small onion (I used the whole half). It was very tasty, and my husband really liked it - and he doesn't like eggplant.

I didn't have sharp chedder cheese for this,so i substituted fresh mozzerella cheese. Added a can of diced tomatoes, as others suggested, because i thought it looked dry as well. I also followed the others, regarding the amt of italian seasoning, which i put in an extra one teaspoon. It tasted great, and we will be having leftovers from yesterday. Definitely will make again, and may make it for a potluck as well!

Although not terribly bad, this recipe is
quite dry. I think it could be salvaged if some wet ingredients were added (perhaps tomatoe sauce or some chicken broth).

I made quite a few changes and with everything I changed it turned into more a dressing than an eggplant casserole.  So I wasn't sure that I should even review it.  But I think this is a great base recipe and that is something I'm always looking for.  I added two cups of French bread cubed, 1/2 c. chicken stock, 2 green onions chopped, 1 celery stalk minced, more garlic for taste and a fistful of chopped parsley along with doubling the Italian seasoning.  I really loved this and the eggplant reminded me of my Maw Maw's oyster dressing. So I will definitely be making this again with the addition of chopped oysters.

Fixed this; it's very good. Leftovers? Cut into square, put each into a plastic bag, and froze. Still good later!

We love the taste, but it tends to turn out a little dry.  I add a little water (maybe 1/4 cup) when I'm mixing it up so it doesn't dry out in the oven.

I've never had eggplant let alone cooked it.  Hubby's first remark when I brought eggplant home..."That stuff is gross".  In regards to this recipe I took others' advice and added tomatoes, doubled seasoning...but, I added chicken (boiled and shredded)...YUM!!!!  Hubby said i could cook this again :-)

Followed other suggestions with minor changes...Added small diced tomatoes with juice, used whole grain bread chunks, and sprinkled parmesian cheese on top.  Blew us away!

I didn't really like this recipe. I followed the directions exactly using stove top stuffing. I found the taste of the stuffing overpowered the taste of the eggplant. Also the leftovers didn't reheat well in the microwave.

I have never cooked eggplant before, so I went looking for a recipe, my family is big on cheese when it is a recipe. I have made my own adjustments to this recipe. I used italian breadcrumbs instead of a instant stuffing mix. I also used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic,I cooked the eggplant in a large pot using half a stick of real butter and a little bit of olive oil and it is moist. I ccoked off my ground meat and added it to the mixture, I also put fresh shrimp in the mixture, then I seasoned it to taste and put it in a casserole dish and added the cheese. I would suggest that if it is too dry for you add a little bit of broth to the recipe while it is cooking

Didn't care much for this recipe.  It needed a lot of doctoring to be decent and it still wasn't very flavorful.  I won't make this again.  I much prefer an eggplant parmesan recipe over noodles.

Was looking for a recipe that didn't include tomatoes.  This was really good, but I did modify it quite a bit.  I used regular bread that I allowed to dry and I used fresh herbs.  I added another egg and extra cheese.  I also used 3 Japanese eggplant rather than one Aubergine.   If I make this again, I will cut back the bread to just a wee bit of bread crumbs and rather than micro the eggplant I will roast it.    Decent all around flavor.

I love this recipe!  I added about two cups of chopped baby portabellos to it and extra cheese. I also used old bread and my own seasoning mix.  I did not find the recipe dry as others did.

Pretty tasty. I didn't have a whole eggplant so I used half a large eggplant, and a bag of spinach, cooked and mixed with 1 tsp crushed garlic. Be sure to add the raw egg BEFORE adding the warm spinach! Also I precooked the stuffing earlier and let it cool.   Instead of cheddar cheese I mixed in 1/2 cup cottage cheese, and topped it with Mozarella. I don't know if this lightened up the fat content much but it tasted good.  It made a rich-textured comfort food type casserole. There was none of that tartness often associated with eggplant.

this was a good recipe. my family injoyed it. Taking others comment it was too dry, I choose to cange a few things. 1st, added mushrooms ( high water retention) and 1/4 cup milk. With this in mind the recipe came out moist and was very tasty.  we plan to keep enjoying this one. We choose 5 med to large fresh mushrooms. We also added some color bell peppers for accent.

I hate eggplant.  I have tried several recipes and hated them all.  One would think I wouldn't buy eggplant if I don't like it.  I must keep introducing foods to the kids!  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to read any reviews.  My Eggplant was huge and I made this in a 7x11 dish.  I used 2 eggs, extra spices.  I didn't have the stuffing so I just chopped some bread melted some butter and tossed it with some spices and let it cook in the oven while the egg plant was in the microwave.  it was really good.  I think it was the cheese that made it good, it wasn't dry at all using the bread and extra egg.

I thought this was really good.  The only thing I changed was to add some tomato and I added a little hot sauce to the egg mixture.  Also, allow time for the bread to soak everything up before adding it.

I didn't have any stuffing, but I did have some dried bread I was saving to make breadcrumbs.  I chopped that up and used it in place of the stuffing.  I also added more italian seasoning and some canned, diced tomatoes (about 1/4 of a big can).  It turned very nice.  I would make it again.

I added red wine, extra shredded cheese, extra italian seasoning, graded parm, LOTS of garlic (I'm Italian Love garlic!!) and just played with the amount.  Everyone has a different taste, but i do agree it would have been dry if I didn't add the wine ( I put a good splash in ). Every egg plant is a different size so you have to adjust accordingly or you will get over/under powered on the taste.

I made this as a way to try and disguise eggplant for my 2 young boys. If you do make this recipe, I suggest "sweating" the eggplant first (cover in salt for approx. 20 mins, then rinse). All in all I didn't find it to be terrible (but I'm not a picky eater). I don't think I will make this again as it did not go over well w/the boys and I really didn't find it too appealing either.

I followed the recipe exactly and did not care for it.  My husband seemed to like it.  The flavors of the stuffing mix competed with the Italian seasoning.

This dish was disgusting.  I followed the recipe to a tee- didn't read the reviews before where I saw that most modified it extensively.  This was a waste of a good eggplant.  I am still pissed.  I would give it 0 stars b/c it was not edible, but it won't let me rate 0.

I read some of the reviews and decided to add a Tbs. of olive oil after softening in the microwave. I also added a Tbs. of red wine for additional flavor. When I told my husband what it was, he was not so thrilled, but was very  surprised that he liked it as much as he did. It was very good. I think next time I will use another method than the microwae to soften the eggplant.

The was fabulous! I didnt have italian seasoning, so I used Chipolte spices. It was great because eggplant is pretty bland. Very easy to make also

As is, the recipe is too bland, hence 3 stars.  So I add 1/2 cup of crumbled feta or even goat cheese. I like to use a whole grain or whole wheat stuffing. I have also added things like roasted red pepper, chopped roma tomato and/or sundried tomato. Then top it with fontina or mozarella instead of the cheddar. I realize this completely changes the recipe but I loved it this way.

SO delicious!  My husband LOVES this.  I seasoned the eggplant with 3 tbs of italian seasoning before heating it in the microwave.  I also used Mexican cheese mix instead of just cheddar.

This dish has so much going for it.  As is, it is great! With some of the alterations,suggested by others, it is great!  What I liked most is the fact that I can make it ahead of time, pull it out and bake it while relaxing with a glass of wine with my guests.  I love recipes that freeze well and this one does.  It is moist and tender and easy to change up according to personal taste.  (I do always, add more seasonings as I grow older, to perk up tired taste-buds.)

GREAT! My toddler loves it! I add a little more liquid and I even toss in some spinach! Great recipe and full of flavor.  I have made it several times and each time I try a different cheese (whatever we have at the time). Still turns out great!

We loved this recipe! I didn't have any stuffing mix (we live in Japan) but I used about a cup of bread crumbs and added a little extra Italian seasoning and it turned out great!

I followed the tips of some of the other reviews and I loved what came of it! First, I doubled the recipe by dicing a tatume squash in with the eggplant then doubling all the other ingredients and splitting it among two dishes, freezing one. I only used one tsp of Italian seasoning per casserole, but I did add about a cup of homemade spaghetti sauce in lieu of the diced tomatoes other people recommended. I also used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella that I really enjoyed. The casserole turned out great, not too wet or dry, very very flavorful! We had this as the main course with a side of spaghetti in herbed butter and we didn't miss the meat at all!

It didn't have much flavor and had a boring texture.  I sauteed the onions & garlic and added it to the eggplant.  I used 1/3 C onions and 2 eggs.  I won't make this again.

I don't think i will be trying this again. I didn't add onions (not a fan) but added tomatoes and it was still pretty dry. I also doubled the italian seasoning but just didn't have much of a taste. Oh well.

As the past reviews noted I added stewed tomatoes to the receipe.  Also, I would add more Italian seasoning & cheese (a little too bland for my taste).  But otherwise, I would make this again for vegetarians at a dinner.  I made it an hour before I cooked it and it made dinner so much easier!

Loved it, however, need to use a LARGE eggplant.  Also, used multigrain toast rather than stuffing mix - worked great.

I made this dish on a whim.  It was incredibly easy to prepare and tasted much better than I was expecting.  I added 1/4 cup Parmesean cheese though the meal would have been excellent without.  Note - you can really taste the stuffing and the eggplant is not mealy or overpowering (for people that aren't huge fans).  I even added some tomato sauce the 2nd day and spooned into a sub roll for a great sandwich at lunch.

This recipe had a little too much eggplant, and was short on seasoning. I thought it was bitter.

It was too dry. I added some range free chicken broth to it and it really helped it. One egg wasn't enough and you don't say how large of an eggplant to use. On the other side, this would be a great dish to add to a Thanksgiving feast with turkey!

I made this a few times. I switched out the stuffing mix with panko bread crumbs cause it was way too salty plus it gives it a nice crunch. I also put olive oil in the casserole dish helps with the dryness.

Had good taste, but too dry. I used a box of stove top stuffing with herbs. The onions didn't cook through, will cook them with the eggplant next time and add a can of crushed tomatoes or a can of cream of chicken soup...something to help it along. Overall it was really easy, but need something added to give it some liquid.

I added a very small amount of chicken broth which gave it the moisture I like.  It was delicious!  I usually make eggplant Parmesan, however this was much healthier. I will make it again.

really good. I was tired and just wanted to throw something together quick. Stuffing mix is a good idea. I added some leftover black olive and leftover feta and most of a can of diced tomatoes. I will make again because i love eggplant and never know how to make it. Thanks!!

I too added a tomato and red wine - nice flavor.  Also cut down to about 1 cup of cheese. With a garden full of eggplant, I will definitely make this again.
