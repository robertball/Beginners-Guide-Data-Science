This cake is a wonderful cake for Halloween parties.  The chocolate buttermilk milk cake is very moist, dense and delicious.  The spider web design was a great hit and everyone wanted the recipe.

Great Halloween-appropriate idea!  Although the recipe never mentioned exactly how to create the web itself, it's not unlike other cake designs requiring a little "raking" through the icing with a small sharp object, i.e., knife, kabob spear, toothpick, etc.  Fun tip!  Make into cupcakes for Halloween parties so every child gets their own spider (made of icing, candy, or plastic toy).  Also, you can make white or orange-colored vanilla icing for the cupcakes, with purple-colored vanilla icing for the web, for those who don't care for chocolate.  Also, if you have time and a small enough group, just pipe on the concentric circles & let the little ones get involved by raking the "spiderweb" (with a toothpick) themselves!  But presenting them already finished does get the "wow" effect.  Have fun! :)

I was in a hurry, and just stole the spider web idea.  Worked great with a betty crocker cake and frosting.  Used white Dec-a-cake for the web!  Came out great and was a sure hit!  Will definitly make again (maybe even using the real recipe!!)

Texture is like a mix - too fluffy to be a good layer cake.  Taste is okay.  Not memorable.  I didn't make the frosting.  For an exceptionally good chocolate cake - & big - as in high - try Chocolate Sheet cake (Kim) or Old-Fashioned Chocolate cake.  Kim's is slightly better because butter or margarine is added, but the other one is a very close second.  You really can't taste the addition of cinnamon, which I normally wouldn't like.  It adds flavor without adding spice.  Good trick!  :D  Try it!

This is a GREAT tasting Halloween cake, however I found it fairly difficult to make.  If I made this cake again, I would double the icing recipe since I ran out of icing before I was finished with the cake!  Also, be sure to have the white chocolate ready immediately after icing and add the spider web rings fast, because the white chocolate hardens quickly making the designing difficult.
