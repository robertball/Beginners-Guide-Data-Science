Had my in-laws over for dinner and everyone loved 'em! I have typically browned my ribs on the stove and then put them in the slow-cooker in barbeque sauce. This version allowed more of the meaty taste to come through and was overwhelmed by the BBQ sauce. A very nice finish on the grill. This recipe is a keeper!

Wow! So easy to make and tasted yummy! Only change I made was I put foil down on grill and poked a few holes so the ribs could "bathe" in the BBQ sauce. My husband who is extremely picky LOVED this! The meat was super tender. What I loved was while the ribs were in the stove for 90 minutes I was able to prepare my side dishes. Love love love it!

They were tender, falling apart tender. That is not how I like my ribs, personal choice. I like my ribs, baby back, spare, etc. to be a little chewy and have a meatier taste.

My family loved these ribs! I reduced the salt to 1/2 tablespoon (next time I may add the full amount but it just seemed to be a lot) and added some garlic. The sauce boiled down to a thick and super tasty sauce. My picky eaters ate every bite!

This came out wonderful. I made this for a group of friends on a Sunday and the meat fell of the bone. I made it according to the recipe but added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and replaced the vinegar with lemon juice. Will definitely impress family and friends at the barbecue

This was fantastic, made exactly as recipe stated.  Everything was fantastic for this cut of meat.  I chopped up the leftovers for sandwiches.

These ribs are so good! They use minimal ingredients and have maximum flavour! After the pot, I rested the ribs on a baking tray and salted them a little, then placed them on the bbq. These will be made again since the BBQ season just started!

Keep in mind that some labeled Country Style Ribs are very meaty, bone-in and lean.  Lean ribs should be covered with foil for the first 2 hours so they don't dry out.  I trusted this recipe and by the time they were tender (190°F) they were dried out and barely edible.  I should have known better.  Don't you make the same mistake.

Ribs didn't have much flavor.  Putting them on grille just dried them out.  Sauce was thin and runny and  not suitable for basting meat on grille or serving as a side for those who wanted more flavor.  Disappointed.

The ribs were tasty but, even with simmering in the sauce, they tended to dry out on the BBQ.  Made it just as the recipe directed except added minced garlic to the sauce.

I made no changes to this boiling sauce except used smoked paprika instead of plaine paprika.  The ribs came out great, loved the flavor and oh so moist.

These were delicious. I added a little fresh garlic & thinly sliced onion into the sauce. Did not need to cook 90 minutes as recipe calls for. My family devoured them. Thanks for recipe.

Very good recipe, especially when you don't have time to marinate overnight. Meat was tender and had a good flavor. Points for ingredients one would probably have on hand. I did leave out the chili powder, but might use next time to give it a zing.
