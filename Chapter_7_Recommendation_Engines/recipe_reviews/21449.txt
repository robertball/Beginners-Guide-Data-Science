I added a thick layer of spinach under the haddock,lightly drizzled it first with basil oil, then placed the haddock with the vegetables and drizzled all with basil oil and lemon juice.  I increased the portions according to whom it was being served. I submitted this recipe originally and have updated it with the addition of the spinach. You can still use olive oil, but the basil or any flavored oil, and the addition of the spinach gives it a bit more interest and flavor. This is a no mess to clean up dinner.   Enjoy!

Very colorful and beautiful presentation.  I'm not very good at cooking fish, but this time I was able to turn out a fish dish that was very flavorful and delicious. I did make a few small changes.  I used a bigger piece of fish than the recipe calls for, went just a little heavier on the spices,added garlic salt, and drizzled a little bit of butter on my haddock.  And, while the recipe does not specify what kind of onion to use, I used a red onion with excellent results.  Also, I did not use capers, but instead added artichoke hearts and fresh garlic in addition to the recommended ingredients.  Lastly, I took the suggestion found in another review to place the fish on a good-sized bed of fresh spinach drizzled in olive oil before cooking, and I would also recommend this to anyone trying this recipe.  Looking forward to making this again!

This was the best.  We are eagar to have it again.But.. we will use six ounces of fish.  The portion was very, very, small.  It left a wonderful taste in your mouth. I may even try it with boneless chicken breast. 5 stars for sure, in fact 10 stars.

I don't care for fish "en papillote" so I cooked the peppers, onions and tomatoes separately on the stove top while I roasted the fish (I used cod loins) separately at 400 degrees for 20 minutes (my filets were on the thick side).  This was just ok; it neither excited nor offended the palate.

I'm not a fan of foil pouch cooking, so I put this in individual oval baking dishes and covered them tightly with foil.  I used larger pieces of halibut instead of the haddock, and used a combination of red, yellow, orange and green peppers.  Omitted the romas because I didn't have any.  And instead of lemon juice I used some white wine and I cut the oil in half.  Mine were perfectly cooked in 25 minutes.

I LOVE this dish. Used it the first time I cooked for a man I'm in love with, and he had nothing but nice things to say about it. Beautifully colorful, and very tasty. My grocer didn't have fresh cod, so I made this with Talapia. I added a bit of zucchini, cause I had it sitting around. Instead of the foil packets, I put 2-3 servings in a small lidded casserole and baked the whole thing together. Delicious, juicy and oh-so-pretty. I'll use this any time I want something simple and yummy to impress company with!!!

I made this  and it was  great - tremendous . I am a guy and like a more manly dish , so I used thick cod filets - about 6 oz each.  I  rinsed the capers to make them a bit more mild based on some previous experience.  I used the suggestion about using a bed of spinach and the basil oil - that  was a major addition as we like spinach. My wrapped foil packages  were very large and I put them on the grill - a guy thing - outside at medium heat for 30-35 minutes .    Easy assembly and easy  cleanup and no  odor in the kitchen .  Great taste and fish was beautifully moist .  I will do this again  to showoff  for guests. Girlfriend thinks I'm a genius  !!!

My wife is a fish eater and somewhat picky. This most definitely met her standards. I had roasted tomatoes and peppers at hand and I think this improved the flavor. The simplicity of preparation and the ease with which this is adaptable to however many individual servings make it a five star recipe in my opinion.

DELICIOUS!!!  Incredibly flavorful and colorful.  The fish just flaked and melted in our mouths.  I will reduce the amount of olive oil and lemon juice next time, though so as not to have the juices run into my other food.

This recipe was awesome! Even my 13 month old son ate a serving. I listened to another reviewer and put the fish and vegetables of a bed of spinach, which was delicious.

i used this as a base for what to make with the swai we got on sale (yay for Lent).. i used the veggies we had in the fridge (tomato, red bell pepper, yellow squash, mexican squash, green onion) and followed the advice about laying it on a bed of spinach.. i seasoned the fish with lemon pepper and kosher salt and i didn't follow the portions for everything else as i was adding and subtracting certain ingredients.. i'm not a huge fan of steaming fish but this tasted like something i'd come up with on a whim.. i think i would have liked it more if it was made on the stovetop somehow.. this is more of a 3.5 star dish for me, but bf loved it so it gets a 4.. ty for the recipe

this was a great recipe! I also added fresh spinach topped with EVOO on the bottom. The only things I adjusted were that I used Scallions instead of regular onion and used small sweet peppers instead of bell. Really kicked up the flavor. I also am not a fan of cooking with foil so I used parchment paper. My husband who is not a fish lover really enjoyed this. Took away the overly fishy taste that he usually dislikes about Haddock.

I think the only reason I didn't like this one so much was because I am not a huge fan of milder fish in general. I had never had haddock before and this looked like a good recipe to try. My mom enjoyed it, though. I think I may make it again using a different fish.

This was super easy, tasty, and healthy!  A touch of crushed red pepper added a nice little heat to the recipe.

Super yum.  Don't forget the capers like I did. Haha.  It was still excellent.  Lots of chopping. Easy clean up.

This is a family favorite at my house.  This is very healthy as well as delicious.  Like another reviewer, I place a bed of fresh spinach under the fish.  I also did not want the lemon juice to react with the foil, so I place  some parchment paper under the ingredients and then place onto the foil. This works well with tilapia, I just cut the cooking time to about 15 minutes.  Just adjust to your liking.  Serve with some garlic & olive oil couscous and you have a quick meal.

I have made this several times and it has been great each time. I do follow the recommendation of another reviewer and place it on a bed of fresh spinach sprinkled with a little salt. I have made it with trout, salmon, and mahi mahi. I have made it with pre-seasoned fish from Costco and left out the olive oil. Make sure to not over cook or the spinach gets overcooked. This recipe is in our regular rotation of food. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I thought this dish was a great idea but the flavor was blah. The foil steaming method of cooking makes everything watery. Curious if a little wine added in there might perk things up? I like the idea of this recipe but not the bland taste. I found myself adding a lot of salt because of the blandness.

This was great and oh so flavorful- my boyfriend and I both had seconds and my 17-month-old son ate a whole fillet himself.  Next time I might get larger fillets because the ratio of vegetables to fish was a little off.  Other than that an A+ recipe.

Delicious and moist - skipped the tomatoes and added sliced baby portabella mushrooms.  Also, didn't have fresh parsley but added some dried Italian seasoning and served it over brown rice.

This was really great! Easy to make. We did it on the bbq and it worked just fine. I followed the modification with spinach and basil olive oil (just add dried basil to olive oil and leave overnight if you don't want to buy it). I thought it might be bland, so I added garlic and extra black pepper and it didn't need it at all. Next time I won't add any extra. Oh yeah, I didn't add capers (don't like 'em). Lot's of flavour, very healthy, two thumbs way up from my husband and me!

I made this recipe as written with the exception of four larger fish pieces instead of 6 small ones.  It was fantastic and I don't care much for fish. This is a keeper for my family.

This was quite yummy.  The magazine recommended lining the foil with parchment which was a great suggestion.

Steams the fish more than anything else so if this is what you are looking to do it is a good recipe.  I added red and green peppers as well.

We tried this based on the good reviews but were very disappointed. There are too many competing flavors in this dish and something in dish produces a strange flavor. The fish itself was fine, but there was an underlying flavor that did not fit at all. We will not make this recipe again nor would we recommend it.

This fish was delicious.  I did add the spinach which was great.  I would omit the onion or cut it back.  It competes with the fish and capers.  It was a good dinner but I probably not make it again.

first off let me say my rating has nothing to do with taste , it tasted fine however it was pretty bland . The tomatoes got soggy and the capers well tasted like salt only. The fish was cooked to perfection and as for beauty of presentation it was indeed pretty and colorful. I say to all you want to try go ahead just dont prepare yourself as I did for an explosion of flavours or you like me will wonder how to rate this recipe !

This was delicious! I didn’t have capers so I replaced with garlic. I also had a ton of the topping veggies leftover so I puréed them into a sauce to go on top! The fish doesn’t need it though. It’s delicious as is!

My husband loved this! I used cod because that’s what was readily available at the grocery store. I added a thick layer of fresh spinach on the bottom as one reviewer suggested.  Sublime!

Second time I've made it. Yummy just as it is. I did have some turnip greens that needed using up so I put those under the fish. Nice addition.  The fillets I used were 4 slightly larger fish portions.

I made a half sized portion using slightly steamed spinach (squeezed dry) as a base in a 7x11 casserole.     I added some spring vegetables (asparagus, snap peas, and leeks) in addition to those mentioned in the recipe.  Delicious and light. Perfect for a warm day.

This was an easy, healthy dinner! I love how colorful it is. I made haddock. Didn't have onions, so I substituted mushrooms and had rice pilaf on the side. Will definitely make it again and try different variations.

This recipe was a hit with my husband, and that's saying a lot. I've been trying to get him to eat fish that's not breaded, and this fit the bill. I did put it on a bed of spinach as one review suggested, other that that, I followed the recipe as written. I liked the foil wrap. It allows the tastes to blend without any one taste overpowering. It's also great for easy cleanup. This is definitely a keeper.

This was an excellent surprise! Very healthy, moist and tender and bursting with flavor.  I did not have capers so used minced olives that gave just the right tang.

I took the suggestions from reviewers and put the fish on a bed of spinach drizzled with the oil.  We grilled it and it made for a delicious meal and super easy clean up. Definitely will make it again!

These little pockets were soo delish.  I change it up a bit, first I put a layer of spinach down, then I added a handful of Lays tomato/basil potato chips, then I drizzled a small amount of oil and red wine dressing, then I added the fish (I used Halibut) Then I sliced two fresno and one jalapeño peppers as well as asparagus then drizzled more red wine and oil dressing and some melted butter, topped it all with some capers.  It was spicy and delish!  The chips cooked and softened down to their original texture and gave terrific flavor to all the veggies and fish.  Thanks for the idea, I can never seem to leave a recipe alone without tweaking it to my taste but I think I'm not alone, as you all most likely do too.

Didn't have spinach so I made a bed of fresh parsely. Also added fresh garlic. Didn't have peppers so I tried smoked paprika and without but the best was when I put canned roasted red peppers on the fillets

This is now my number 1 recipe for haddock! The first time I made it I had to keep from eating it all myself and save a little for my husband.. :) it's a great combination of flavors.

This dish was good but was in need of a bit more flavor, make sure you season the fish well and I suggest you use bigger portions of haddock then recommended. It was colorful and very easy to make served with a veggie and potato. I will make this dish again making sure I use a bit more salt and maybe add some garlic powder and bigger portions of haddock.

It was a good recipe.  I want to try this again on the bbq with other fresh herbs.
