the most decadent and tasty cupcakes I ever made.  I followed the cake directions exactly but I made some changes to the frosting.  I used 1/2 butter 1/2 cream cheese, only 1/4 cup powdered sugar and lots of honey until I got the taste I was hoping for.  I added the milk and cinnamon as written.  Absolutely wonderful!

An extremely sweet cupcake, more reminiscent of a coffee cake than sopapillas.  Pronounced honey flavor in the frosting.  Used turbinado sugar in the dusting.  Instead of lemon extract simply soaked lemon zest in vanilla extract.

Ok,  my 15 yo daughter made these tonight for her Spanish class.  
She finds this recipe and I have all the ingredients.   She asks to do a trial batch which is a great idea I know but our idea of cleaning up the kitchen is like oil to vinegar.   
Wow!   Excellent recipe.   We have devoured as much as we could.   
Thanks!

These cupcakes are amazing! I've made them several times. The only thing I did  differently was add more cinnamon both to the cake mix and to the frosting, added a little bit, like a quarter of a teaspoon, more lemon extract, and I just squeezed the honey into the frosting mix, didn't measure out three tablespoons. It was probably a bit more than that, but it was glorious!

These were pretty tasty!  Be careful not to overfill - 2/3 may be a little much.  Mine overflowed and unfortunately, did not puff up, so they were pretty ugly by the time I got them out of the pan - each one a little broken.  

Unfortunately, I forgot to grab confectioner's sugar at the store and was in a hurry, so I had to do something drastically different with the frosting.  Googled "cream cheese frosting using honey" and found a simple solution on Martha Stewart's website.  It was only 8 oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup of honey.  Turned out quite lovely - wasn't too sweet.  I put it in a ziploc bag with an icing tip after making it and put it in the fridge to firm it back up a little bit.  Dusted each cupcake with a little additional cinammon sugar after frosting.

These cupcakes were light and fluffy and they were just the right amount of sweet, with the cream cheese giving them a little bit of tang.  

I'll definitely make them again!

These turned out great. I did change a few things, I used a classic vanilla cake mix and followed the directions on the box (I had already made it thinking I was going to make just a vanilla cake). I did add the cinnamon and all that too. 

I read the reviews for the frosting and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the frosting as well as 1/2 tbsp of milk to the original recipe. They turned out great! My kids were my taste testers.

I made these yesterday for Cinco de Mayo.   I added 2 Tbsps of cinnamon to the cake batter (because I didn't read the instructions all the way) but otherwise no change.  I really liked it with the extra cinnamon.   I read several reviews that said the frosting was too sweet, so I made my own with 1 cube butter and 4 oz of cream cheese.  I never measure the sugar and milk when I'm making frosting.    I also put honey and cinnamon in the frosting since it was in the original recipe.   My family loves these cupcakes.  In fact, I'm going to grab one now to go with my coffee.

Made these for my sons fiesta birthday party tonight and they are amazing. The recipe is extremely easy and the end result will not disappoint. I will say the video skipped the step of cinnamon and sugar topping which I found interesting. Please see my pics below

Followed the recipe EXACTLY and whereas the cake is REALLY GOOD the frosting is still too runny after using an entire bag of confectioners. Super sweet, which I love also, but maybe a bit TOO sweet.

The cupcakes came out ok, but the frosting was AWFUL! Way too sweet, and I followed the recipe exactly. I had to add lots of peanut butter to it just to cut the sweetness, and even then I almost just threw it out. A decent base recipe, but needs tweaking

I've had these cupcakes saved to my favorites for so long!  I am SO angry I did not make them before.  They are delicious.  I added about 1/4 tsp more cinnamon to the frosting.  I also left off the honey drizzle (I have to transport them and thought it might be too messy/sticky).

Otherwise no changes.  Recipe made exactly 18 cupcakes and the icing amount was pretty much perfect for piping.  Thank you!

The cupcake itself was really sweet but it was a really soft consistency, really not a bad cake. However the frosting turned out really crystallized, perhaps I made it wrong but the butter and the sugar created an unbearably sweet frosting.

Amazing!!! It was fluffy and delicious. The only thing I did differently was I nixed the frosting and used a little drizzle of on top instead. The cake was so good it didn't even need the frosting and the cake with honey was just luke sopapilla!

Based on other's reviews, I doubled the cinnamon in both the batter and the icing. My husband loved these. I thought they were OK, maybe only 3* worthy on the day I made them as the cupcake was a little dry and the icing overly sweet, however now that it's day 2 I have found the cupcake is a much better texture. I think if the original recipe had more cinnamon and if the icing wasn't so sweet, this would be 5* worthy. Will make again, but use a cream cheese based frosting with more cream cheese and less sugar to cut the sweetness.

Quite good. I had to leave out the lemon extract since I didn't have any.  Very tasty and if you are craving a cake or a snickerdoodle, this is a good substitute.

I thought the icing had to much honey. I will not make again.

First time to submit a review. These cupcakes are amazing. I took them to a family dinner and they were sampled before the dinner : ). My family prefers pie over cake and these disappeared!

Very easy and Wonderful!  Could not believe how the frosting pulled together those wonderful flavors and combined so well with the cupcake to make these a hit in our home.

This review for frosting only. 

I used this frosting on plain yellow cupcakes to add a little flavor. It is a close second to my favorite cream cheese icing! Very sweet and has a strong honey flavor. I added a little extra cinnamon since I wasn't using cinnamon in the cupcakes. Makes me want to try the Sopapilla cupcakes!
