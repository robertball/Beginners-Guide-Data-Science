Three stars as written, calling for balsamic vinegar, four stars leaving it out. Pasta primavera implies that fresh, spring vegetables are used--it doesn't really matter, specifically, what they are. I used what I had in the fridge--grape tomatoes, zucchini, red bell pepper, carrots and mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms with sliced shallots and fresh minced garlic in olive oil, then stirred in the roasted vegetables and pasta (I used linguine). Couldn't help myself, I had to add extra butter!  The fresh basil and parsley, as well as a good Italian seasoning blend, really contribute a lot to this dish. Perfect with our roast chicken dinner.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was the perfect recipe for a recent dinner party where one of the guests was on a vegan fast. I substituted margarine for butter and served the cheese on the side. 

I would recommend adding more vegetables - I added about 1 cup of broccoli and 1 yellow pepper. I also added a lot more basil (approximately 1 cup of chopped basil leaves). 

Great recipe to get you in the mood for spring and summer. Thanks!

This was extraordinarily good! I didn't have zucchini or asparagus so I just used more yellow squash, and didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of diced-then-drained which I added last to the sauteed onion and garlic to warm them up. To the veggies I added a dash of red pepper flakes which I always do.
This is, without a doubt, one of the tastiest dishes I've ever eaten. Yummy.

YUM! This is awesome. I was looking for a relatively healthy main dish and found this recipe. Who knew it would also taste so good! I forgot to top it with cheese at the end, and I didn't miss it. I didn't have zucchini or green beans so I doubled the squash and asparagus. I used Gemelli pasta--the little spirals and they worked great. For a recipe with so many ingredients, it ended up being really easy. The lemon and balsalmic flavors really made this dish perfect. Even great as leftovers! Great date meal, especially for vegetarians (my boyfriend's only complaint was no protein). I will definitely make this again, and bring it to my next pot luck!

Just delicious!! I used 3 yellow crookneck,2 pale green patti pan, 3 zucchini,1 eggplant, a whole pint of grape tomatoes, red pepper flakes and reduced the olive oil to 1 tablespoon when roasting the veggies. I cooked the carrot , which I had preshredded stuff, with the onion and garlic on the stovetop. I left out the butter and used vegetable stock to saute the onion mixture. I served this with whole wheat pasta and used freshly grated Romano cheese. Wonderful, light and tasty! This is going into permanent dinner rotation.

Excellent!  Very versatile.  You could pretty much add any kind of veggies you want.  A little of this  a little of that.  I didn't bother measuring anything.  Will be making again.

This is a great easy dinner option at our house.  We make it quite frequently.  It also helps clean out the fridge of various veggies that need to be used.

This was very easy to make although I did use the vegetables that I had on hand. I used broccoli, cauliflower and bell peppers and topped it with cilantro and roasted it. I really like cilantro and it goes great with anything. I had to roast the veggies for about 20 mins because it took longer for the cauliflower. I also only had linguine on hand but I followed the instructions for penne and it was still great. The balsamic vinegar added a touch of sweetness to the pasta and it was amazing! I will definitely be making this again.

I really enjoyed this.  As with others, I used what was in the kitchen.  In fact, I thawed some frozen veggies, squeezed out excess water then roasted as directed.  I also used whole wheat pasta instead of linguine.  I found that I needed to use extra olive oil, though.  Maybe it was b/c of using the different pasta.  Great recipe!  My 4.5 year old even ate it!

Is there a rating for a dish that had to be tossed.  DH and DS (who normally will eat anything) flatly refused to eat this. I am so disappointed.

I added a few ingredients to make it a bigger batch.  I added pea pods, spinach, brocolli and mushrooms.  I separated it in several containers and used it at different meals.  I took it to work and had it for lunch, added a little feta and ate it cold. Delish!  I heated it up and added chicken, and on a different night had it as a side with grilled fish.  A great healthy base that can be made into several meals.  I love anything that can be made in bulk to have on hand when you don't feel like cooking.  Will definitely be making again!

Surprisingly good!  I'm cooking for my Vegan father in law this week and I have to addmit that we both loved this.  Just as good cold as it is hot.  I also left out the balsamic vinegar but will try it the next time just to be sure.

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made it for my family a couple times now and everyone has about three servings each. The balsamic vinegar gives it a different but tangy twist. Don't worry about cooking the pasta ahead because it will get reheated when it's mixed into the pan with the balsamic dressing. I wouldn't change a thing!

Great dish! Had no butter left, was baking all weekend...still came out great (and healthier!). Added some parboiled-then-roasted broccoli and left out the balsamic, nice lemony flavor without overpowering. I will make this again!

This tasted really good. I left out the butter & Romano cheese, and added cooked garbanzo beans. It was a wonderful vegan main course. We plan to make it often.

I just made this dish for me and my husband who is a meat lover. The dish is very filling with all the fresh vegetables, he didn't even notice that meat is missing on tonight's supper.

Searching for a light, bright, flavorful dish? You have found it! Delicious! Nice mix of lemon & basil flavors. Used all fresh veges, doubled the green beans (these were thin & looked to be French) because I couldn't find asparagus. Used 1 Tbs instead of 2 of balsamic vinegar & added more lemon juice. Veges roasted faster than the suggested time so check early. The Romano cheese was the perfect topping. Use at least a 12" skillet, it makes a lot.

I loved this one! It is so refreshing to eat a dish with fresh vegetables. I had never had pasta primavera with a creme-like sauce and now, I don't think I will again. I'm holding on to this wonderful recipe although I might tone down the lemon juice a bit for next time, as my husband was puckering just a tad. :-D

I give three stars as written. Even though it was flavorful, I found it to be much too dry. I modified by adding 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup white wine to the onions and garlic, bring to a boil for about 2 minutes, then adding the lemon zest, vinegar and herbs, along with 2 tablespoons of butter. This made a nice sauce for the pasta.

I left out the green beans and the fresh herbs (because I didn't have them), and put the garlic in with the veggies because hubby can't eat onions.  Love the recipe, especially roasting the veggies in the oven.  Found a white balsamic vinegar at Trader Joe's that kept the color of the veggies.

By far, one of THE BEST recipes I've ever made. My husband always asks me for this dish! We use whatever veggies we happen to have, and it never comes out exactly the same way twice. You can even add chicken for protein, if desired. Also, pretty much any pasta will work. For added benefit, use whole wheat or whole grain. We also sometimes throw in flax seeds and sliced almonds for another nutritional boost! Look for low-fat feta cheese and balsamic vinaigrette if you need to watch fat and/or sodium counts. No matter the changes, this is one terrific dish!

I didn't have the squash, tomatoes or zucchini and I subbed frozen peas for the green beans but it was still very good. I threw in some leftover feta cheese as well. Double the sauce portion. Yum!

Very flexible recipe- I made so many substitutions that I'm not sure I should really review this- but it tasted great and was easy.  (I added a ton of cheese and left out half the veggies, I didn't have them).

Added shrimp and a tiny pinch of dried cayenne peppers and loved it. It's the dead of winter so I used basil I froze last summer in ice cube trays filled with olive oil. A taste of freshness on a cold winter night.

This was EXCELLENT. I couldn't find yellow squash, so I used sweet potatoes, which were actually really good in this! The lemon zest and balsamic vinegar combine to create a light but citrusy-sweet flavor. This will be regular in our family's menu rotation!

Excellent way to use those fresh summer veggies.  Too bad it heats up the kitchen so much on those hot summer days roasting those veggies!  Changes:  no asparagus, 2 extra cloves garlic, no lemon zest, added some browned sausage, and used 1/2 the pasta because it makes sooo much and I wanted it healthier and veggie heavy.

Fantastic! A really great recipe to use fresh summer produce from the farmer's market. I used mushrooms in place of the red pepper, and used quartered baby carrots. I also used double the green beans, and asparagus and added extra cheese. Came out perfect! Tastes even better the next day.

Wonderful meal full of fresh summer vegetables!  I roasted the onions and garlic with the other vegetables to save on clean-up.  I also added some leftover fresh mozzarella and chickpeas for a little more protein.  Beautiful presentation and tons of flavor!

I enjoyed this meal for a quick and healthy dinner on a weeknight, my family wasn't much a fan of it because it has no meat, but anything made with fresh vegies is a win in my book.

I thought this was very plain and didn't have much flavor. I didn't have asparagus so I used additional zucchini. Everything else was the same. In an effort to give it some more flavor and make it tolerable (because it made A LOT), I added a can of small white beans, a can of diced tomatoes, and Italian-style dried seasoning. A little better, but I won't be making this again.

Next time will try without balsamic and maybe extra squirt of lemon juice at table. Saved a little pasta water and added in when tossing together for extra moisture.

This was really good, thanks!

I used slightly different vegetables based on what I had on hand and whole wheat pasta.

The balsamic/zesty flavor mixed with the grilled taste of roasted veggies was perfect. Don't leave out the lemon zest; it really adds to the flavor. But I did skip the cheese as hubby doesn't care for it.

This was delicious, and super simple to make!  I had rotini on hand so I used that, parmesean cheeese instead of romano and then added one chicken breast - which I diced into small bites - and threw it in with the garlic, butter, and olive oil at the end.  It gave the chicken an amazing infused flavor.  I think next time I'll add a second chicken breast, because I didn't realize how much this recipe actually makes.  I didn't have fresh green beans, so I just upped the asparagus.  Next time I might also slice the grape tomatoes in half before roasting and up the balsamic to 4 tablespoons (love balsamic!).  This is a fantastic, easy recipe that even I couldn't screw up with substitutions!  Great way to get lots of veggies into your diet :)

Loved this healthy dish.  I used whole wheat penne and because my husband won't eat a veggie-only dinner, I sauteed Cajun Chicken Sausage in some dry sherry along with the onions and garlic.  I also used fresh Parmesan/Reggiano and added it to the pasta as well as on top.  Delish!

Love this!  It's great for using up veggies or a light summery meal.  I look forward to Farmer's Market season so I can enjoy the great flavors that come out in this pasta.  I've made different variations with different veggies, depending on what I have on hand and it is always delish and super easy!

Five stars! The flavor in this dish is amazing. I did not use pasta, instead I topped jasmine rice with the finished veggies. I only used 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar. Left out the yellow squash and used one whole red bell pepper. Used one bunch of cherry tomatoes cut in half. Delicious with some fresh grated parmesan cheese on top.

Love this recipe! I have made it several times using different vegetables. My favorite combination is yellow squash, zucchini and tomatoes. I added cauliflower and liked it as well. This dish is so fresh tasting. It has become one of my favorite pasta dishes.

Not bad. Since I already had quite a few of the veggies called for handy, I decided to give this a try. While I enjoyed this, my husband didn't. Having said this, I do think this would have been MUCH better without the balsamic (and I even used a good quality one). The balsamic added a sweetness that just doesn't belong, IMHO. It also turned my pasta an ugly brownish color, so much so that my hubs asked if it was the whole grain variety.... Other than cutting back on the balsamic (or omitting altogether), my only other suggestion is to sub crumbled feta or goat cheese for grated Romano. Either would add an awesome flavor punch and pair beautifully with the bounty of earthy roasted veggies. All in all, this was good, but not exactly what I was expecting or hoping for. If for nothing else, I at least got a few day's worth of veggies in my diet. :) Thanks Amanda!

This is delicious!!!  I didn't change much, except I left out the green beans and instead added some broccoli and cauliflower due to personal taste, and based on some other suggestions, I cut back on the balsamic vinegar to two Tbsp.--I figured I could add more to taste if needed because I always taste before I plate anyway.  I did splash just a little more olive oil into it at the end since I thought it was just a touch dry.  And I kept everything else exactly as written.  It was absolutely delicious!!!  I cannot wait to make this again.  Four teenage girls and my 8 year old wiped out the bowl (yes I got to have some!) and would have had more had there been more to be had!  Make this dish, you will not regret it!!  I did saute 1/2 lb shrimp in olive oil and about 1/2 tsp of the italian seasoning and added it, but it was only on top--had no bearing on the taste of the dish with or without it (but it was a nice addition!)  Oh--one more note--it's 85 degrees out and despite some other suggestions I still chose to make the veggies in the oven for two reasons--I figured it was easier to be at oven and stove rather than running back and forth, and also I do feel that roasted veggies taste different than grilled and also stay firmer longer (I didn't want soggy veggies).  I really loved the taste of the roasting in this dish.

SO GOOD!!!!  I did only 2 tbs of balsamic cause that's all I had, but I think it was enough.  I had to use cherry tomatoes instead of grape and I'm not a fan of Romano so I did Parmesan instead.  This is a great way to get tons of veggies!  Thanks!

I feel like I did something wrong, because I definitely would NOT rate this 5 stars and it has already gotten such great ratings.  It just was not my cup of tea.  It was very vinegary and the pasta was actually purple - not very pretty looking.  It was a LOT of prep to end up being disappointed, so I probably wouldn't make again.  My husband and son did seem to enjoy though.  We're having again tonight since it made so much.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was a big disappointment.  I think that maybe if the seasonings had been added to the veggies as they were roasting it would have tasted better. Not sure.  It was just disappointing.

I can't stay away from this recipe. I finally saved time and dirty dishes by adding the onions and garlic directly to the rest of the vegetables and roast together. I toss everything together in the same large bowl at the end. I've only made it with beans once and decided I prefer it without them.

The key to roasted veges vs. steamed is to give them plenty of space on the baking dishes. I use quite a lot of baking dishes, but the flavor is much better than when crowded (and takes less time). I use the rind of a whole small lemon, but I don't bother with the juice, which doesn't really make it to the oven anyway. The balsamic is key to the flavor.

Great recipe! Love the veggies and fresh taste. No meat needed, but you could always add some grilled chicken or shrimp, if you wanted to.

Fresh, healthy and easy to make.  My family and I are trying to cut back on fats and this recipe was perfect.  I loved it as it, but you could easily change the veggies for a different taste. Thank you for offering this healthy alternative.

I made this primavera for my sister when she came to town. Delicious! I used yellow squash, peppers, green beans, asparagus and mushrooms, quartered. Not only was it very tasty and light, but it looked pretty. I served it with a spinach, feta, red onion salad with raspberry vinaigrette. Looking forward to making the dinner again.

Delicious!  A great way to use my CSA share veggies this week!  I didn't have any asparagus, but had plenty of summer squash, peppers, carrots, green beans, and tomatoes. I served over whole wheat angel hair pasta. Perfect! The fresh herbs, balsamic vinegar, and lemon juice added the perfect fresh flavor. This was great cold the next day for lunch, too. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I read the majority of the reviews and was impressed with how much everyone enjoyed this recipe.  I like trying recipes with vegetables and pasta with little or no sauce.  I must say, this recipe does not disappoint.  I doubled the amount of vegetables and kept the  pasta the same and it was super.  I made this once with and once without the balsamic vinegar and both versions were superb with no negative comments from those who enjoyed the meal.  I plan on taking this to church tonight to feed the music committee and another batch to feed incoming college students.

I am not a balsamic fan, but this was great.  I used vegan margerine to meet the vegan diet needs in our house.  For the meaty eaters, I used the same seasonings this recipe calls for as a rub for chicken breasts and pan-seared those in EVOO.  Cut the chicken up and serve mixed with the primavera for a heavier, more protein rich version.  I did increase the spices, and sub'd broccoli for the tomato (based on what I had on hand).  This was great, thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a great way to use the veggies in my garden & CSA box so I omitted the green beans & asparagus and doubled the other veggies.  I also added extra garlic, onions, salt, & balsamic because we love those flavors.  Fantastic recipe! Will make again.

This was wonderful and light for Easter brunch.  I would reduce the cook time on the veggies a little because they were pretty limp, but the flavors made up for anything lacking in texture.

If you are used to cutting ingredients to make healthy meals, this may work. However, there is little flavor in this dish.

This dish is ok, flavor is flat.  Grated parm and some seasoning helped a bit.  Will use again as a starting point, but definitely will add additional herbs or spices.

This was fairly good, but it was lacking flavor to us.  It was light which is good, but maybe a little too light.  I would make it again, but i'd try to flavor it up a little more.

Everyone liked this - even my 6 year olds. I added shrimp to it and put some feta on the adults' dishes. We loved it. Alot of prep work but all the ingredients are pretty much always on hand so it's convenient. Yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe.  Easy to make with a beautiful presentation.  I skipped the lemon rind and the lemon juice because I didn't have them, and I substituted cilantro for parsley (didn't have parsley either). I know cilantro isn't typical Italian but it turned out great.  I imagine you could pretty much use whatever you have in the house and this recipe would work.

Wow!  This is a basic blueprint for a very flexible recipe.  I use whatever vegetables I have on hand or are in season - I especially love broccoli and sweet onions.  I also sprinkle with a few toasted pine nuts to send this over the top.  Very family friendly vegetarian dish, as well.

This was great! Because my boyfriend won't go for anything w/out meat (much to my dismay),I added 2 mild italian sausages and a small chicken breast. It was fabulous! Contrary to what a few other reviewers said, I thought the prep was not bad at all. Sure, it took a little time, but not too much. It's an easy recipe.

I LOVED this recipe. I didn't have asparagus or green beans, so I just omitted it and upped the other veggies.  I like that this recipe lends itself easily to that flexibility. Sooo good. I'm not a big fan of cream sauces, which tend to be so heavy. I added a little bit more vinegar than called for (because I looooove balsalmic vinegar). Quick, easy, healthy, filling, and DELICIOUS... Could you want any more from any recipe??

This was just okay.  I liked all the veggies in it but for some reason It didn't satisfy my tastebuds like I thought it would.  I actually thought that it tasted better the next day after it had sat in the fridge overnight.  I liked it as a chilled pasta dish better.

I thought this was pretty good. I made the recipe exactly as directed.A downfall would be that it was time consuming to chop all the veggies. It was also expensive to buy all the ingredients since I do not have a garden.  My kids tried but did not like. My husband and I liked the flavor but will probably not make again.

This recipe came out GREAT! I doubled it for 12 people and I added some chicken to it. I also replaced half of the tomatoes with broccoli because one of my guests love broccoli. Very simple to make and the flavors blended very well together.

This will  become a staple in my house!  I did have a few variations as I was using items in my pantry.  My veggies were red, yellow and green peppers and zucchini. 
In the sauté pan I added mushrooms with the onion and garlic. 
Instead of balsamic vinegar I used white cooking wine.  Then I squeezed in some fresh lemon juice. I also added a ladle of pasta water and a packet of chicken bouillon powder.  
Then I tossed in the penne and roasted veggies.
Topped each plate of pasta with shredded parmesan cheese.
Delicious!

Very good and so easy and versatile!  I had a bunch of green beans, squash and tomatoes from the garden so I just used that.  I also added some shrimp that I just roasted together with the veggies.  Very good as written but next time I might put, instead of the balsamic vinegar, 1/2c white wine and a bit more lemon juice for the sauce.

I was a little light on the oil and used balsamic to taste. I also made sure the vegetables were seasoned well. My family ate this instead of my grandmas old fashioned Italian food including my grandma. Also whole wheat penne makes a great healthy addition the balsamic takes away from its bland flavor. The vegetables definitely need more than 15 minutes, cook them until they are fork tender and carrots usually take the longest. Preparing the green beans and asparagus in a different sheet will make it easier (I also made 12 servings). Top with Romano before serving and you have a delicious hearty dish. Bravo to who came up with such a simple recipe.

Very Good.  Followed recipe expect used less olive oil and no butter or cheese.  I also omitted the balsamic (personal preference).  Still delicious. I'm always looking for a good vegetarian dish and this is perfect.  Thanks for recipe.

Wonderful! Loved the veggies! Used quinoa pasta so that this dish was gluten free! Great flavor with the lemon on the roasted veggies...balsamic vinegar was a great addition but you have to like how balsamic tastes! If you are not a fan of the balsamic, make without and use it on the side for those who like it.

This was so good for a Meatless Monday night that my DH requested it again the following night! Since then, I've made this several times with perfect results each time. I use different spices when roasting the veggies (our favorite combo is onion, zucchini, grape tomatoes, and a green and orange bell pepper), but literally any veggie will be well-suited for this recipe, which is quick, easy, and healthy! Sometimes I toss some pesto in the angel hair, sometimes I don't.  Either way, I love a good dose of parmesan cheese on top of mine! I serve this with garlic bread, which is our family's favorite side dish with pasta.

Fresh lemon, basil, and parsley make this dish delicious and easy to make! It's healthy, tasty, and something that can be easily modified to fit what ever you have handy in terms of vegetables. I'd make this for company or just for an easy weeknight dinner again. 
Modifications I want to try: adding some sliced kalamata olives and adding some cannellini beans!

This is very, very tasty and filling.  We're dieting, so we wanted something that was low fat and yet satisfied our craving for pasta.  As others have said, all the effort is in the prep work of cutting up the veggies, but once you do that, it's a breeze.  We added a spinach salad and we were happy, happy! The only thing we omitted was the cherry tomatoes, since I didn't have any.

This was just OK. I went the extra step and grilled the veggies in a grill basket instead of baking. That was the best part. Definitely don't skip the balsamic. Used lemon thyme in addition to the zest. Would make my own version again, but not this one as written.

Plenty of leftovers. Used 16 oz of noodles and it stretched this meal really well. Wouldn't mind trying some Shrimp tossed in with this one. Could change up the veggies too. Wasn't a fan of zesting the lemon but it was worth it for the flavor!

This is a great idea for a meatless meal that is filling. I did add a bit more of each veggie like the whole red pepper instead of half. I also forgot the balsamic vinegar and it was still great with just the lemon, olive oil, butter, and fresh herbs. All of the work is in chopping the veggies. Chop them all first, get them in the oven, and then start the pasta. While it's all cooking saute' the onions and garlic. It will all be ready to toss together that way.

absolutely love this! it takes a minute to chop everything up, but overall it's such a simple recipe, and it tastes amazing.. even better the next day.. the asparagus was the best part, I used more than than it called for, and didn't regret it.

This recipe is a tasty, healthy way to use up veggies in the your fridge.  Anything works.  I didn't have lemon, basil or parsley and it still tasted great.  Roasting the veggies is the way to go.

This was so unbelievably delicious! The only substitution I made was leeks instead of onions. We're freaks for leeks! Anyway, the balsamic vinegar was delicious and really made the dish come alive. Thoroughly enjoyed this and will be adding to our regularly served dishes.

Delicious!!!!  I took one bite and said out loud "oh my God!"  I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I just used Adobe.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It is outstanding!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!  This was one of the best recipes I have used.  My entire family loved it. Only change was instead of Penne pasta I used my new fave Campanelle and used lime instead of lemon.  I will make this again and againf or sure!

Wow! Both my teenage son and I loved it! The roasted vegetables were fabulous coupled with the balsamic vinegar and other ingredients-just great. So versatile too as any veggie/pasta combination could be used. Yummmm! Thanks for sharing-this will definitely become a regular in our household.

I didn't have yellow squash, but I did add chopped mushrooms.

Mom wanted pasta primavera for her birthday dinner.  I never made it before, so I found this recipe.  Made exactly as directed, except added broccoli, and omitted the vinegar.  Everyone loved it, and every last bite was devoured, no leftovers.

Like most other reviewers I've made this a few times using the veggies I prefer and have on hand rather than following the exact recipe and really enjoyed it. I used whole wheat penne everytime as well to make it even more healthy. I do recommend using a higher-end balsamic for this one though since the time I used store-bought it just wasn't as good.

This is so good and you can really just add what veggies you have on hand. I used yellow squash, zucchini, roma tomatos, and orange bell pepper. I roasted one tomato and put another one in last. I added chicken as we like a meat in every meal if we can. So So good...and I would say you could probally leave out the noodles if you had enough vegtables if your going really healthy. Going on my monthly rotation!

My kids and I really enjoyed this recipe. It takes quite a bit of prep work but it was tasty and is a vegetarian dish. I cooked exactly as written

Leave out the Vinegar!  It tasted like a pizza in pasta form.  I used Yellow Squash from a can, fresh asparagus, green beans, red and yellow bell pepper, 1 onion, an entire bundle of garlic!  and used I can't believe it's not butter.  For the Pasta I used Al Dente's brand of vegetable fettuccine.  Will def make again, maybe with broccoli

Don't worry if you don't have the required veggies; any veggies will do.  I used pattypan squash, zucchini, yellow squash, and 1 regular tomato.  This is a quick, easy, and tasty dish.
----------------------
UPDATED:  I often use this recipe now to just make roasted veggies - they are delicious on their own and quicker than the full pasta dish.  :)

This was really good. Next time I will use more veggies and double the "sauce" portion. I also realized after the fact that I used a 16oz pasta when it calls for 12oz, so I'd double the sauce for 16oz of pasta.

Loved it!  I added extra grated cheese, but it was fantastic.  I got my picky children to eat it by allowing them to pick out some of their veggies and adding marinara.

This was such a wonderful dish!!! I didn't add all the butter or olive oil and it turned out great!  i probably only added 2 tsp. of butter and 1-2 Tablespoons of evoo.  This is going to be great this summer with all the yummy fresh veggies!  I think I'll try eggplant next time.  Oh i also grilled chicken and sliced it thin and put in while i was rewarming up the pasta and served with multi-grain french bread.  Super yummy thank you!!!

Excellent, light primavera!  We made a few modifications (rarely do we make a recipe exactly as stated). We used grilled veggies (onion, zucchini, aparagus, red peppers, portobello caps) rather than heating up the house to roast them.  Since the grill was on we threw on some chicken breast that had marinated a few minutes in some olive oil, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. Easy and delicious!

I loved this recipe because it was super simple and with pasta primavera you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand. I used onions, squash, zucchini, tomatoes, and baby carrots (should cook these a little longer than the other veggies if you use them whole). Through in some whole wheat pasta and you are good to go! Yum!

Outstanding flavor with awesome nutrition! Grape tomatoes really roast up soooo sweet. Used a bit more oil & cheese. All four of us loved this, including one non veggie eater. Cut your veggies as specified, the cut makes them cook up & roast just right. Primavera means spring in the Romance languages, and this dish lives up to that. Served with Ginger glazed Mahi Mahi, wowed everyone.

Made this tonight and I think it's one of the best recipes I've found on this site. Substituted broccoli for the asparagus, since we don't like asparagus...and the broccoli has a GREAT flavor when roasted. I also added a bit more balsamic vinegar than it said (an extra tablespoon), but I love balsamic, so it was great! Other than that I stuck to the recipe for the most part. I did stir the veggies a little in the pan after about 15 mins, and roasted them for about 10 more to get them to the doneness I liked, but that timing could vary depending on your oven. Overall, GREAT recipe. I'll be making this over and over again.

This was delicious! I used less pasta (half package) and more veggies.  I didn't have asparagus or grape tomatoes, so I chopped up a regular tomato and used that.  I also roasted the onion with the veggies and threw in some halved mushrooms that needed to be used up.  Loved it! Will make this one again and again!

We loved this dish.  I took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the balsamic vinegar.  One can add/subtract vegetables based on taste - we used broccoli instead of green beans.  Really liked it!

This dish was just okay for me and my family which was disappointing b/c so many fresh vegetables were used.  The italian seasonings, balsamic vinegar and lemon zest were a bit overpowering and seemed to compete with each other.  Next time I will use roast the vegetables with salt and pepper only; use fresh lemon juice instead of the zest and I will reduce the balsamic in half.  Having said that this is a very healthy dish.  The roasted vegetables were very good.  Will attempt again.

I made this exactly as stated, though I did need to cook the vegetables for 30 minutes for them to be tender.  We thought it was good if not a little bland.  I appreciate how healthy it is and really liked the lemon and balsamic vinegar flavors combined with the veggies, but it just needed a little something extra to really make it sing.  As I was heating up the leftovers the following day, I saw that I had some low fat feta cheese sitting in the fridge looking lonely.  Viola!  Instant improvement.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the pasta was pretty good.  I would probably cut down on the olive oil next time, since it was a little greasy.  The aroma of the roasted vegetables was great, though!

If you're looking for some meat to add to this recipe, add shrimp.  I usually make something like this with red wine, sugar, vingar and italian seasonings to cook the shrimp in and then add the onions and garlic while the other veggies are roasting.  I did not try it with basalmic vingar but am guessing it would be equally as tasty! 

Also do try with mushrooms and red pepper flakes added, definitely added some awesome flavor.

This was good and healthy, but the flavor is somewhat lacking. I will definitely use this process again for a healthier pasta dish, but I will be changing up the ingredients for the sauce.

I liked this recipe; my husband, a little less so - because he doesn't care for pasta.  It took me a while to make, and, to tell the truth, I was expecting the flavor to have more pizzaz.  I made the recipe as written except for the following: I used 16 oz. of pasta (because that's the box size I had), 1/2 an onion (because 1/4 of an onion sounded like too little), no parsley (because I had no fresh parsley), 1 large coarsely chopped tomato (because I had no grape tomatoes), and Parmesan cheese (because I had no Romano cheese).  The part of this recipe I liked the best was roasting the vegetables in the oven.  What a great way to prepare summer veggies - even apart from this recipe!

Loved the fact that it could easily be gluten-free and dairy-free.  We left out the parmesan and added back in some of the cooking water.  Yum even without the cheese!  I used the fresh and frozen veggies I had available.  Chopping the zucchini, carrot, and squash took literally minutes with the shredding blade of my food processor.  They looked julienned.  I added frozen green beans and broccoli and used dried herbs because that's what I had tonight.  I even left out the onion and substituted garlic powder, because we're a few days away from our big grocery run.  Still very, very good!

Very good recipe.  I used what I had on hand: frozen hericots vert, frozen peas, frozen corn, a half a red pepper, half a yellow pepper and a whole pint of tomatos. I finished the dish off with about a tablespoon of butter because it needed a bit of fat.  Otherwise, it was delish.  Also was great cold as a pasta salad when I added some crumbled feta.  This is a definate "keeper" recipe.

Very tasty!  I added mushrooms and didn't add the carrots and tomatoes.  There was so much flavor and the smell while the vegetables were roasting was to die for.

This has become one of our family favorites!  I have also used leeks, mushrooms, broccoli, when I have them on hand. Chopped spinach can be added to the pan right before the chopped basil for some extra nutrients. The butter can be omitted for an even lighter taste. Wonderful dish!  Remember to pass the salt, pepper and cheese.

I was searching for a vegggie/pasta recipe for my vegetarian daughter when I stumbled on this one.  So good - we all enjoyed it. WONDERFUL flavor and even better the next day.  A no guilt, satisfying and healthy recipe. I made no adjustments to the recipe.  It didn't require any.

This was a great recipe.  I roasted cauliflower, broccoli, carrots and onions in the oven with lots of olive oil.  It was quick and delicious and I will be making this again!  You really can use any veggies you have on hand!

This was so delicious. The flavor was just awesome and it was really easy. I don't think it even took an hour to make. I added broccoli with the roasted veggies and sauteed some mushrooms along with the garlic and onion. You could just about use any veggies you wanted with this. I think next time I'll make less pasta, as it seemed to absorb most of the vinegar, or try tossing the vinegar with the veggies before adding to the pasta. I give it 18 stars. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used all the fresh veggies from our garden in this and it was fantastic.  Doesn't matter if you don't have all the ones listed, I only used 4 or 5 different ones and I used different peppers and it was still a bit hit.  Deinitely saving this one!

Added chicken (which I marinated in some spices and balsamic vinegar) and switched up the veggies according to what I had on hand.   It was good....however I found it better after it sat awhile in the fridge and was tossed with some parmesan cheese.  I only wish I had a garden so I could make this one cheaply and on a regular basis.  Thanks!!

This is fantastic. The flavor is just right. I only made small changes due to what veggies I have and it is always great. I also cook this just a little longer to make sure the veggies are roasted and not wet.

My dad makes something similar, but it includes chicken.  I will def add chicken next time.  And more garlic, and more season in general.  Needs a lot more salt, and I'm not a 'salt' person.  It was very good. I will make it again, with a few changes.  It is very beautiful too.  And enough to feed an army!  haha

A really great way to use up any type of veggie you may have. Instead of the pepper, asparagus, and green beans, I opted for broccoli, cauliflower and fresh, sliced mushrooms. I also used a pretty campanelle pasta instead of the penne. I used 4 cloves of garlic, and I sprinkled extra garlic powder at the end. This makes a great side dish to accompany just about any meat or fish.

WOW, this was an awesome dish!  I made it 3 times in a week for guests!  Kids were delighted to eat the veggies!  I used pesto instead/in addition to the chopped basil.  Instead of tomatoes (I don't care for them cooked), sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms in balsamic vinegar. The pre-fab matchstick carrots are a great short-cut. Added hot italian sausage, cooked with the onion and garlic.  Tossed in pine nuts, sprinkled with extra lemon juice and balsamic before serving, finished with grated romano.  YUM!

This recipe was great!  I made the following changes: omitted pasta, aluminum foil, Romano cheese, lemon zest and butter; substituted diced Japanese eggplant for the asparagus; used 4 teaspoons of olive oil to roast vegetables instead of 2 tablespoons (which is 6 teaspoons); and a whole green pepper instead of 1/2 a red pepper.  I think next time I'll just put the onion and garlic in the mixture and toss in the parsley and basil after roasting.  I used a metal 9x13" pan because I mixed the vegetables and seasonings in the pan before and after roasting.  I liked this recipe because the cooking time is less than some other baked vegetable recipes.  There was a lot of chopping and cutting, but well worth it.  Thanks.

Loved this!  I used all veggies listed in the recipe and added broccoli and a yellow and orange pepper as well (had a tri-color pack)... I simplified by condensing the steps, I added the basil, parsley, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and balsamic to the veggies before roasting them.  I used whole wheat pasta because that's what I had on hand and once drained, tossed it with the olive oil and Parmesan cheese (that's what I had rather than Romano as listed in the recipe) and then tossed with the roasted veggies as soon as they came out of the oven rather than adding the step of cooking the onions, garlic, etc separately.  Just cooked pasta tossed with cheese, oil and all those beautifully roasted veggies and served... absolutely delicious and filling and even better as leftovers!  Will be making again and again!  Thank you! Oh and definitely recommend using whole wheat pasta, it added a hearty, earthy, nuttiness that you don't get with regular pasta.

I used packaged Broccoli slaw (without purple cabbage, just broccoli & carrots matchstick  pieces), in place of yellow squash & zucchini to avoid liquid & soft veggies, omitted the Basalmic vinegar & increased the onion to a whole versus half & added more garlic & left out the butter & it was delicious! A big hit for my vegetarians who added fresh grated Parmesean cheese and my vegans without the cheese! I made it again for lunch the next day because everyone asked for it again. I ate it for lunch at work & was delicious. New favorite & so easy. One more thing I uses Quinoa Rotelle pasta for my diabetic. Served with chicken Italian sausage on the side for my carnivores. Met all our special diet needs. Once veggies are cut it takes no time to make .

Made this for 24 people yesterday. It's easy to make ahead and was DELICIOUS! Only used half the recommended Balsamic Vinegar. Also added some roasted chicken for the carnivores. People were coming back for thirds!

I enjoy a dish that doesn't require to many dishes and this was pretty good. This was delicious and my husband raved over it! The balsamic vinegar is very different and I thinknif you don't like it just use all lemon juice and it will give an even fresher taste.

I followed the recipe with just an assortment of vegetables I knew my friends would like and it was perfect. I wanted a side dish for my husband's beer-can chicken and smoked ribs that would be filling, but not overpowering since his meat was the star of our party. This was a perfect side giving both fresh vegetables and pasta in one dish. You could easily add some chicken (or tofu if you want to keep it vegetarian) and have a one-pot meal.

Great recipes that can use most veggies you have on hand. Be sure you use veggies that you would enjoy eating normally.   We have made this for several years now and we have some tricks that make this outstanding. 
Use fresh ingredients or you are really missing out!! If you don't have fresh ingredients, make it another night when you do. Get a real, fresh lemon.  We grow basil and oregano. One year we even had grown cherry tomatoes that were vine ripe to use.
Be sure to roast the vegetables to bring out the flavors. In the summertime I roast them on the upper rack of the grill.
If you like Feta cheese, use that instead of or in addition to Romano.
A balsamic reduction is much better than vinegar because of its sweetness. Just let everyone add there own cheese and balsamic, especially if you are serving to children.  
If you are trying to make this a one dish meal, add black beans for vegetarians or ham for meat eaters; otherwise, serve this with some grilled fish.
Enjoy!

I varied the veggies a bit due to the season (not asparagus season) but otherwise followed the recipe. We all loved it. My husband had the veggies the next day over brown rice.

The first few times we made this dish we always felt it was missing a little something but we loved all the fresh roasted veggies and no cream.  This last time we added just a touch more balsamic and a generous tablespoon of dijon mustard mixed in with it and it was dynamite!

Great ingredients.  Made it for a group of women for dinner.  Served with crusty bread and green leafy salad.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

Yummy! I cooked about a pound of chicken on the stove over medium high heat with the garlic, and added two heaping handfuls of chopped spinach once the chicken was cooked. The balsamic vinegar was just right for our family, and even the little one enjoyed it.

I wish I had the really liked it star... I did not expect the balsamic vinegar. It added a nice touch. I think I will reduce it to 2 T next time. I did not have asparagus so I used broccoli. I did not roast the vegetables because I did not read the instructions correctly... Still very good and I will make it again.

I made this tonight and it was a hit with me and the kids.  I used broccoli instead of asparagus because kids love broccoli (and not asparagus). I didn't have lemon, so I used orange juice.  It's a versatile and forgiving dish that I'll make again and again!

My family raved over the dish, but I didn't make it 100% by recipe. I made my substitutions some because I forgot and others by  choice, but it was a hit with my family.  Local store did not have asparagus, so I put in more green beans: forgot the carrots, peppers, and cheese; choose to leave out balsamic vinegar.

I was so impressed - this dish came out way better than I expected. I thought the buttered onions were odd for a pasta dish, but I think that and the balsamic gave the otherwise dry and bland pasta a wonderfully sweet taste. The veggies could be changed up to suit your taste or whatever's in the fridge, I omitted green beans and used waaaaay more asparagus. All in all, I'm extremely happy with how it turned out A+.

me, bf, and bf's daughter really enjoyed this after having at it with the salt shaker.. probably used a little more asparagus than called for and not as much cheese.. other than that we stuck with the recipe.. idk if the extra cheese was supposed to make up for the small amount of salt.. but either way we all thought this was light, healthy, and very filling.. ty for the recipe

If I could give more than five stars I would. Went to Farmers market bought the best veggies I could find. Were vegetarian and this dish was a smash hit. Followed recipe to a t. now my family begs for it.

I used angel hair pasta and ommitted and deleted various vegetables as I saw fit. Used sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms,  yellow/orange peppers as well as shrimp because my  husband has to have MEAT. Also added worchestheshire sauce.  Great dish.

This dish is absolutely the best! The lemon zest, parsley and basil are so aromatic together. The roasted vegetables turned out perfect. This is company fare! It is versatile in that you can change up the veggies with whatever is in season.

This is a wonderful option for people who are lactose intolerant and can't have cream.  My toddlers are very picky eaters, but they eat this with no fuss.  I do halve the amount of balsamic vinegar for them, though, and just use whatever veggies we have on hand at the time.

Really really good! I reduced the fat/oil (really only needs 1tbsp for roasting and a tsp or tbsp of butter for frying the onions. I think there is enough liquid in the veggies and lemon juice to compensate). Also added chicken and broccoli instead of green beans. I just fried the chicken with the onions. Keeper, for sure. Loved it! I really loved the lemon flavours. i would also NOT recommend skipping the vinegar as it gives the dish dimension. The prep takes a long time, though. I prepped it over the weekend and put it seperate baggies so when I came home from work I could throw it in the oven/pot/pan and then it was only 20 minutes. I absolutely will make this again!

I've made this recipe a few times now, and the thing I like most about it is that you can pretty much throw in any vegetable you have on hand. It's a great seasonal, healthy dish. I sometimes mix in a bit of hot sauce or chili flakes to spice it up.

My first time making it could been more organized and the kitchen being messy did  not help so it took longer than i wanted it to.  But everybody loved it.  Great recipe seems somewhat low cal and high in nutrition.

This was awesome. We loved the flavor that the roasting of the vegetables gave to the dish. I wondered at first how adding balsamic vinegar would taste, but loved the mild zest it gave. I added brussel sprouts (quartered) instead of the green beans, and used linguini instead of penne.

This was awesomely delicious!  We will definitely make it again.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but agree with other reviewers that it lends itself to endless variation with the variety of vegetables that could be used.  Note that I did need to roast the veggies for 40 minutes rather than the 15 that the recipe specified.  I also needed to add an additional tablespoon of olive oil when I put it all together at the end.

I completely changed this recipe, but absolutely must rave about how delicious it is! I didn't use pasta but instead roasted fingerling potatoes. I also reduced the balsamic so the sweetness wasn't too overpowering. Then I added marinated chicken breast to make a complete meal, which I had marinated with Newman's Own Herb & Garlic marinade for a day. Delicious and so simple!

Great September, fresh garden produce recipe!  (Funny that asparagus was in this, as it is a spring vegetable.) 
Changes: more tomatoes, 8 oz whole wheat rotini, broccoli (instead of asparagus), fresh herbs, 3 oz. canadian bacon.  This fed 8 at my house.

This was a fantastic recipe. I made two changes: I did not include the balsamic vinegar and I added greek olives at the end. This recipe does involve a decent amount of preparation but it's well worth it. It had great flavor and it wasn't too heavy and rich like most pasta dishes. Next time I will add more vegetables

I didn't have all the ingredients but needed a quick and simply penne meal. I put the oil, onions, garlic, lemon, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, basil, and parsley in the pan and cooked the onions until transparent, then tossed this into the penne, and topped it with romano. Only had the green beans on hand and served those and some baked focaccia on the side. YUM! Can't wait to try it with all the other veggies some time.

I am a pasta lover but often struggle to find recipes that do not revolve around dairy products (my partner is lactose). My partner is not fond of veggies but he will eat whatever I put in this dish. I have made this recipe twice with a side of "Chicken and Red Wine Sauce" also on this website.

This was the perfect light meal that came together easy and relatively quick.  I tossed orange pepper, squash, zuchinni, grape tomatoes, asparagus and whole cloves of garlic in oil and sprinkled with fresh ground telecherry pepper and salt.  Roasted on baking sheet with non-stick tin foil for 15 minutes.  While that was baking I sauteed shallot and garlic in oil and butter along with some chicken sausage.  Lightly buttered penne and sprinkled with romano.  Skipped the  balsamic vinegar and lemon but did use lots of fresh basil and parsley.  I will definitely be making again soon.  Great summertime meal that you can vary with fresh veggies of the season.

Delicious pasta primavera, perfect for enjoying spring vegetables.  I ran out of balsamic vinegar so I left it out and I thought it was still really tasty.  Next time I make this I'll be sure to try it with that as well.  The recipe seems like its asking for a lot but it is well worth the effort of getting all those veggies.  Thanks for sharing!

Mmm, this is delicious!!  The changes I made were minor.  I added an extra squash, zucchini, carrot and some mushrooms and still felt that there was plenty of pasta (bowtie).  I also added sausage and definitely recommend it.  It really adds to the flovor and ability to fill you up!  I was out of lemon juice and will definitely use it next time.  My husband went back for thirds (partly because it does take a lot to fill you up, but he loved it) and took it for lunch today.  We will absolutely be having this again soon!

This was awesome.  The veggies I had on hand were:      Zucchini, carrots, eggplant, and a bell pepper. I roasted them foe 25 min. And then added them to the onion and garlic sauté.  I also added mushrooms with the garlic and onions and then put in a can of drained petite garlic and olive oil tomatoes.  Then seasoned with salt and garlic powder.  So yummy!

My boyfriend and I made this for dinner tonight and it was great! Took under an hour and made it almost exactly as written. We added a little more pepper and didnt have any green beens so used a whole bunch of asparagus. He loved it too! Had it with red wine and french bread.

Super yummy and healthy dish. My husband loved it, and it's difficult to get him to eat meatless meals. I substituted whole wheat rotini for the penne. Will probably become a regular dish in our house!

I can't believe anyone would not like this recipe!  They had to have made it wrong.  It was so yummy!  I didnt use onions cause my daughter doesnt like them, I think it would be better with them.  I would add an extra carrot for the extra sweetness... although the onion might take care of that.  I didnt have asparagus (wish I did) used mushrooms instead.   Two thumbs up!

Delicious! My husband went back for more. I used more veggies to ensure I had leftovers, but even so was able to use less pasta. Previous reviewers are correct; you can really use any combination of veggies.

So delicious! I made this just for myself and used up what vegetables I had (broccoli, bell pepper, tomato, carrots, zucchini, onion/garlic) and still used 1 tablespoon of Country Crock (60 calories).  I also used spaghetti and lots of garlic (3 cloves) and pepper! I used a couple of fresh basil leaves to top it off, along with a couple dashes of lemon juice.  I didn't use balsamic, and since one review suggested leaving it out (but I still wanted it), I improvised with a touch of Newman's Own Light Balsamic Vinaigrette and stirred it in with the vegetables before roasting.  I used one tablespoon of olive oil in all and only used it for roasting.  Very, very delicious and a great way to eat up all of your vegetables! It looked soooo good on my plate and I ate it so fast!

I don't always care for balsamic so I left it out.  The roasted veggies were nice and crisp; better than they would have been sauteed.  Delicous!

I found this recipe to be 4 stars as is. I love vegetables but my husband is less of a veggie lover than I am and he would prefer it with a sauce so we went heavy on the cheese topping.
*UPDATE* We made this again without the lemon zest/parsley/basil/vinegar mixture and used Alfredo sauce instead. Five Stars! I know this defeats the purpose of the "No-Cream" part but we love the recipe up to that point.

This is a great recipe. I had to make a few adjustments since I did not have squash, zucchini, green beans or asparagus on hand, I substituted cauliflower and broccoli. I had to roast the vegetables about 5-7 minutes longer than called for because of the cauliflower. Also, I am a huge garlic lover, so I also roasted five or six garlic cloves with the vegetables. I must admit, I was a bit scared at first when I added the balsamic vinegar - i thought it would end up being too tart. However, I was very happy with the end result. The leftovers make a great cold dish for lunch the next day!

Excellent! However, I don't see the need to fire up your oven when you could just sautee the vegies in the olive oil and butter that you already have going on the stovetop. I love roasted vegies, but the moisture in the tomatoes stop the browning process in the oven -- you need dry heat for that. Toasted pine nuts would be a nice addition to this at the end.

Delicious! I made the recipe as is but I added mushrooms. The lemon zest and juice added a nice zing to the pasta. Very fresh tasting. Next time I will leave out the tomatoes and add whole roasted garlic cloves.

The great things about this dish are that it's very healthy (especially if you use whole wheat pasta) and that you can use almost any veggies you want. I used red, yellow and green bell pepper, purple onion, zucchini, carrots and green beans. The problem for me was that it didn't have quite enough flavour. Next time I will add more italian seasoning to the veggies and add more and balsamic vinegar basil at the end.

WOW!  Awesome ...YUM!  I made this as a side dish with Famous Butter Chicken.  It was fantastic!  I used less balsamic, mainly because my son is a little bit picky and also it turns the noodles a weird color.  Everyone loved it...even the picky one cleaned his plate. If you use carrots, put them in first, then after 5 or 10 minutes, add the rest of the veggies.  My veggies took longer to roast, but I used a TON of veggies. It was even fabulous the next day for lunch! I used the hard parmesan on top (way better than the powdery stuff). YUM!

This dish is wonderful!  I added a few more veggies..mushrooms, broccoli...i also scaled the recipe in half.  Be careful not to overcook the veggies if you scale it down...i did....but it was still delicious.  I recommed turning the heat down on the oven to 375.

I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Was simple to prepare, loaded with great vegetables that are readily available all summer long and tasted great. I'm a vegetarian, but would serve this to meat-eating guests without reservation.

I think this pasta was amazing! I added a little more lemon juice, lemon zest and grape tomatoes. I also skipped the parsley because I did not have any in the fridge. With the addition of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, this pasta is perfect!!! My husband loved it as well. :)

Yummy.  Trying to expand my palate.  I liked it.  Tart.  I used quinoa instead of pasta.  I also didn't use the cheese because of an allergy BUT could see why it would be good to have it.  I liked the quinoa and it changes the carbs to a grain.  I can see that we will make this again.

Loved this dish!  It was a bit too strong of a balsamic vinegar taste, so in the future I'll adjust it with maybe a bit less and a bit of oil instead, or adding a bit of sugar.  But I loved how fresh tasting it was.  I will definitely be using this as a staple, especially in the summer :)

Much better than i expected. Will make again soon.  Not an asparagus fan so I left that out.  I decreased the balamic vinegar to 1 Tbsp. since other reviewers thought it was a little overpowering.  I added 1 cup of canned diced tomatoes w/ italian seasoning and a handful of fresh baby spinach at end for more flavor and color.  A very simple meal but filling.

Complex, yet subtle! My wife and I loved this exotic tasting dish. Would be great for potluck dinner, cookout, too. Use whatever veggies you have. I used fresh, in-season tomatoes, bathed with the dressing/seasoning mixture but added toward end to the pasta/balsamic mixture for heating. The wine recommendation of Sauvignon Blanc was exellent!

This is a wonderful dish!  I used a whole eggplant, cubed, a pound of asparagus, and 2 yellow squash.  I cooked 2 chicken breasts, cubed, in the pan with the garlic (didn't have onion), and the dish was very healthy but hearty.

I made a few changes I won't enumerate here; the point is, roasting the veggies makes this a really special dish! I loved the balsamic vinegar but my husband hated it, so next time I will probably serve it on the side.

Super fresh and healthy dish.  We enjoyed it; I'm giving it 3 stars only because vegetarian isn't really my thing.  But if I need a veggie dish to serve to company, this is the ticket.

I used zucchini, red bell pepper, and tomato, since that's what I had on hand. I only used 1 teaspoon lemon zest, because I thought 2 would be too much, and 1 teaspoon was just right. The flavor is very tasty, like nothing I've ever had - the lemon shines through and is mellowed by the cheese. My veggies didn't roast very well, especially the zucchini - it's so difficult to not overcook them. I'll definitely make this again.

We really loved this dish!  We used more of the veggies we love and less of the veggies we just like.  Also, I switched up the leftovers with crumbled Feta Cheese and Kalamata Olives. Tasted great will make it again soon.

I've been making this recipe for almost a year now and I love it. I add some diced chicken and increase the amount of the vinegar mixture. In the summer, when everything is in season, I make big batches of the veggies and lemon, vinegar, oil, seasonings and cheese and freeze them in quart size freezer bags.  Then when it's cold outside I heat it up on the stove and add pasta.  Sooo good.

Great recipe! I used fettucini noodles and left out the cheese for a great vegan dish. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Superb! Add and subtract veggies you like. I added marinated artichokes and left out zucchini and squash. But I also added grilled chicken and toasted pine nuts! Delicious! Tons left for tomorrow, can't wait!

This was really tasty - I loved the fact that the veggies were roasted in the oven.  I did not have fresh herbs on hand so I used only dried.  I am sure the fresh basil would have given it a different flavor.  I was very satsified for a easy healhy meal in just 30 minutes.

This was OK in my book. I think I may have left the veggies in the oven too long. They turned out a bit mushy.

Good.  I didn't have any asparagus, so I used extra green beans and tomato.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  It's a lot of work though, and I'm not sure I'll make it regularly.

I really liked this. My husband thinks it's better when served warm. (We made a batch and took it to a friend's house the next day, so it had been in the fridge overnight.)

I make this for my 12-year-old picky eater.  He loves pasta and veggies, but hates sauces.  He asks for this all the time -- he really likes the roasted vegetables -- and I just make it with whatever I have on hand.  Works out every time!

I am a college student that is trying to eat healthy, so this recipe was perfect.  However, make sure you have a fan on in the kitchen when you take the roasted veggies out of the oven, because the burnt lemon sauce set off our fire alarm.  
I rated it a four instead of five because it was labor heavy and took a lot of different bowls and pans, which meant a lot of dishes.

This get five stars for health and piling on the veggies, but only four for flavor. I found it a bit dry and boring.

Delicious!  My husband liked it too!  I decreased the vinegar just a little, because we are not vinegar people, and I doubled the tomato.  Next time I will try mushrooms and add a little more cheese.  LOVE IT!

This was a great meal and is good served as a hot pasta dish or cold pasta dish.  We used angel hair pasta instead, because that's what we had on hand.  I also used a bit more squash.  Great & everyone loved it!

This recipe is delicious. It takes a bit of chopping, but it is more than worth the time. This is one of my favorite things to cook for dinner in the summer.

Yummy!  I pretty much followed the recipe.  Except (and don't we all do this?).  I used more veggies than called for, the same kinds, just more of them.  I also added about 2 T of pinenuts just because that sounded good, and I wanted the extra protein.  I used whole wheat pasta for extra fiber.  
The primavera was quite yummy.  Even m 3 year old ate quite a bit, though he picked and chose.  He really liked the tomatoes.  I almost left them out since they aren't something I normally buy, but they were so sweet and yummy, I'm glad I didn't.

I love this recipe. I followed it as written except I used more veggies, which I tend to do since I dont measure them. It was so light and delicious hot or cold. I think it can be used to serve to company or you could make it to bring to someone's house as a main dish or side dish. This recipe is added to the rotation for the rest of the spring/summer!
oh 1 think I didnt like was the green beans, I would leave them out next time and add some broccoli and maybe some cubed eggplant too.

Delicious and so healthy.  I added a cup of cheddar (American) or tasty (if you live in Australia) cheese to the recipe and threw in parm instead of romano because of what I had on hand.  It was absolutely beautiful.

I thought it was yummy! My husband even said it was "above average" which is high praise for him for anything with vegetables in it. I used about half the lemon zest and used a random assortment of vegetables I had on hand and it came out great.

Didn't follow this recipe exactly but it still turned out great. I find that you can substitute all kinds of veggies in--I used eggplant and squash with mushrooms. Also added sun-dried tomatoes, which brought in a great flavor. Easy and tasty!

This is a great recipe. I would omit or cut down the lemon zest the next time I make it but apart from that is was perfect. Nice and light dish for the summer. This dish looks great too if you serve it family style.

I roasted the veggies on the grill and that helped keep my house cool.  I also added "Dried Tomoato and Garlic Pesto" mix from Tastefully Simple Inc.  It was really good and perfect for company.

A fair amount of prep work required with the veggies and lots of dishes left when I was done making this dish, but it was delicious.  Beautiful presentation...looked like it was prepared by an italian chef!  I was hot and sweaty when I was done making it in my summer kitchen, oven at 450 F and pasta boiling!  Hubby raved so it was worth it.

Very yummy. My boyfriend and I loved it. I have some solutions if you think it's lacking in flavor. You can either add extra cheese to your plate or use less noodles. I accidently left out about half the noodles and it was super flavorful. Then when I was serving, my boyfriend noticed the extra noodles and we added it.

This is definitely my kind of recipe! I've made this many times and, depending on the hurry I'm in, I've used whatever veggies I have on hand, substituted missing ingredients, or not measured very carefully, and yet it always turns out delicious! As a busy working mom this healthy, durable but delicious recipe also is my go to for meal prep, family picnics and potlucks, or when we're feeding a lot of guests for any reason!

This is a new favorite summer dish for me. I made it once  as the recipe called for, and then the second time changed it slightly based on the first experience. I'd recommend using a whole pint of cherry tomatoes and adding 1/2 a container of feta cheese instead of the Romano cheese.

I used the whole wheat pasta and vegetables from my garden, so there was more zucchini, and some Japanese eggplant. I used four cloves of garlic (cause that's how we roll), and extra lemon juice. As a vegan, I used nutritional yeast instead of parmesan. It was fantastic, and a great way t use lots of garden basil, tomatoes, and zucchini! Thanks!

Fantastic!  Didn't have Italian seasoning so my wife used oregano, parsley & lemon pepper.  One of the best pastas I've had in a long time.  Thank you!

I had a variety of summer veggies to use up and this recipe was perfect for that purpose.  On hand I had baby bella mushrooms, green beans, red peppers, zucchini, and yellow squash, but any combination would work, I think.  For my husband I added some frozen cubed chicken to the oil, butter, onion and garlic skillet, increasing the oil and butter a little of each.  Everything else was the same.  I definitely will make this again.  Using whole wheat pasta and olive oil increases the healthiness of the recipe as well.

Used on-hand veggies. Purple carrots roasted up dark red and made an appealing presentation with broccoli & a yellow pepper. Threw in some leftover cherry tomatoes when sauteeing the garlic. Saved a bit of the pasta water to thicken the sauce. Left out balsamic b/c I'm not a fan

I skipped the balsamic vinegar like another reviewer suggested. The lemon juice is totally enough, I think. It was really good! Will make again and again.

I love this recipe! The balsamic vinegar and lemon flavors really set it apart from other vegetable/pasta dishes! Recently  tweaked it to fit better into my weight-loss program by using cooking spray to roast vegetables, one tablespoon each of butter and olive oil to saute onions, and only  one cup of penne pasta for the whole recipe (instead of 12 ounces). Perfect!!

I really liked the addition of  the roasted veggies in the oven, but there was just too much basil and parsley! It was herby and not in a good way.  I think maybe half those ingredients with a full box of pasta and all the other ingredients and it should be good -- but 1/3 CUP of each is too too much!

Next time I make it, I'm definitely tweaking that part.

We love veggies, so this dish was right up our alley.  It was very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but used whole grain pasta.  I'll definitely make this dish again.  I wish that folks wouldn't rate their 'own' recipe, but rate the 'original' recipe, ....then mention how they think it might be improved, .... since I also like to read how others 'improved' the dish.

Thank you for the great recipe!  I doubled the veggies (and, thus, all seasonings) and added some left over roasted chicken breasts.  Delicious, full meal in (mainly) one very large pan.  As to the person who suggested skipping the vinegar, I can't imagine that the dish would be even half as good without it.

This was really tasty. It is not a traditional primavera but I love roasted veggies and the combination of lemon and balsamic was nice. I have a lot of veggies from the garden and it was a great way to use a lot of them.

Pretty good, though a lot of effort. Made a nice amount and had a fancy flavor. Did not have fresh basil or parsley so that prolly dampened the expected flavor unfortunately.

I used whole wheat pasta to increase the fiber and protein.  I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I made my own.  Lastly, I increased the total amount of vegetables.  Passed it on to other family members so they could make it.

This is a outstanding dish, i changed it a little 
I used fresh corn cut off the  cob. Saturated corn and onions and added it. 
Added a bit more butter lol, oh and added chicken 
Loved it we could have it twice a week.

I followed this this recipe to the T.  My husband really enjoyed the recipe, but I did not. It was just so bla.  I will make it again as it is an excellent recipe for his health needs, but I will have to dump a lot of grated parmesan cheese on it to eat this again.  3 stars for middle of the road.

Absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I had a great time making this together. Left out the asparagus because I was very expensive at the time but I can imagine it would have been good. Also don't be afraid to be generous with the cheese!

This is amazing. I followed the recipe, but added some fresh corn to the veggies, used 5 tbls of balsamic and used fresh grated Romano on top. Four people ate this - two (including myself) thought it was to die for. The third person thought it was okay but didn't like all the veggies and the fourth person thought it was meh but he's a big meat and potatoes kind of guy.

Delicious!  I've made it three times now, I think.  I don't always use exactly the vegetables listed, and I substitute dried herbs if I don't have fresh, but otherwise I follow the recipe quite closely. My family enjoys it very much.

Missed out the red pepper because we didn't have any but the result was yummy anyway. I will definitely make this again. I think next time though I may add some toasted pine nuts. Thanks for the recipe !!!

More prep time than I thought, but worth it. Had to use dried basil instead of fresh. Will definitely be making it again!

Delish!  Made it per the recipe, plus mushrooms.  Will definitely make it again.  I thought the sauce was just perfect with the balsamic and lemon juice. It made 4 servings for us.

I'd give the original recipe 3 stars as a base for ease and versatility, 4 stars with my changes. I Used white wine instead of balsamic vinegar, cooked the noodles in chicken broth and used sat, pepper and dried Italian herb blend generously. I was also heavy handed with the fresh lemon juice and Romano cheese on top. Definitely a keeper.

Very light and very tasty! Love the healthiness of all the roasted veggies, and the lack of any real sauce, but so tasty with the balsamic vinegar. I used only 2 tablespoons, and would do so again next time.

We really liked this. It was different from regular pasta primavera, but the balsamic vinegar gave it a nice sweetness. My biggest complaint is that the recipe calls for too much pasta. A high pasta-to-vegetable ratio works well when using a sauce that's thick and/or creamy, but in this dish, we thought the vegetables should be highlighted more. It's a matter of taste, of course, but I think it would be better with 1/2-1/3 of the pasta the recipe called for while leaving everything else the same.

This is a keeper!  I am a very fussy consumer of these recipes, and this one is spot on.  I had no grape tomatoes or lemon zest or fresh basil/parsley (used dried), halved the recipe since it was just for myself and husband,  and added some very tender chicken slices (grilled chicken tenderloins) because this was to be our entire meal.   And we thought the mix of flavorings were terrific.  Oh - and I had some sweet onion to use up, so used that instead of the yellow onion.  Otherwise did as directed.  YUM!

Excellent way to use up veggies.  I didn't have fresh basil or parsley but it was still very delicious.  We roasted the veggies, tossed the pasta with the olive oil "sauce" and cooked some shrimp.  Everyone served their own plates so that, for some, nothing touched and for the rest of us it was all mixed. Everyone loved it!

I did not make this exactly as written because I was determined not to run to the store. I used the veggies I had on hand, which included broccoli, cauliflower,  and carrots. Also, I didn't have fresh parsley or basil, so I substituted the appropriate amount of dried. I might have gone a little light on the zest. Everything else was as written.
The flavors were surprising and really nice. The lemon is very noticible, so if you don't care for it much, either reduce both juice and zest, or omit the zest altogether.  I found myself liking it more with each bite, actually. I really enjoy balsamic vinegar, and complex combinations of flavors, so I thought it was yummy.
My husband is too polite and grateful to say so, but I suspect he didn't care for it quite as much. He likes very simple recipes, doesn't like onions very much, and doesn't get as excited about vegetables as I do. But he ate it! 
I would make this again.

I have an allergy to dairy so this was a nice option with a few adjustments.  I used soy butter substitute (note to those making it for Vegans--margarine does have dairy in it) and of course had to leave off the cheese on mine but overall very good.  Lots of ingredients though so it took me a little longer to prepare than I expected.

This dish is excellent! I didn't have zucchini so I added mushrooms and broccoli. I also added half a tsp more of lemon juice as well as a tsp of crushed red pepper. It added the perfect amount of spice!

Aside from leaving out the vinegar, basil, and parsley (I didn't have any), I left the recipe as-is. This pasta was rich and so flavorful. We loved it and it will definitely become a regular.

Really liked this recipe as is, only change I made was to use about half the amount of penne.  And, although I used the cheese, the recipe really doesn't even need it.  Tangy flavor with the balsamic and lemon zest- excited for the leftovers!

Great way to use up garden veggies. Didn't have squash, added more carrots, artichoke hearts, garlic salt, red pepper flakes and salt. Increased all liquids (oil, vinegar, juice) and used a lot more basil. Used garlic oil instead of olive.

Added broccoli, left out yellow squash & asparagus - working with what my CSA share gives me! - and the Romano (potluck may have Vegans).  It is absolutely delicious, easy to make and tastes like it took forever.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

The roasted vegetables were delicious and I had everything on hand but asparagus. It was a nice suggested mix, especially the roasted grape tomatoes-- yum! Wasn't keen on the balsamic. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and made a little sauce with white wine and a little extra butter (added with the onion and garlic.) Was 5 stars for me then.

Great dish.  I used to eat pasta primavera every year at a little restaurant in temagami Ontario called buffy's nook while on vacation fishing up there.  This was as good as I remember that being and helped me use up veggies from the garden.

This is a very good and delicious recipe that is quick and easy to make. I used red lentil penne pasta as a gluten-free and healthier alternative.  I halved the veggie portions (except for the pepper and onion) and also julienned them rather than chopped them to mimic the shape of the pasta.  With this tweak the portion of veggies to pasta was perfect.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it was just okay.  Normally I love balsamic vinegar in things, but in this case I didn't really care for it. Might try this again without the vinegar. The family ate it out of obligation, but none of them particularly liked it.

Wow, this was great!  I followed the recipe but only roasted asparagus, squash and carrots. I didn't have fresh parsley or basil so I used a smaller amount of the dried herbs.  My family absolutely loved this!  I'll be making this again!

This was a great veggie pasta dish. Left out the onion--(didn't have any) so I doubled the garlic.  Also, added a can of cannellini beans to give it some protein.  This would be great served with a roast chicken or a store-bought rotisserie chicken, or just about anything on the grill!

Fabulous recipe!  You can use any vegetable you like or what you've got in your fridge.   I didn't stray from the recipe one bit, and I had rave reviews from my family (one of which does not like pasta at all!).  Will be making this many times!  Thanks so much for this keeper!!

Not really my favorite flavor profile, but it was edible.  Makes a huge batch!  I turned the leftovers into a baked dish and smothered it in a homemade red sauce and mozzarella, it was like a nice vegetable lasagna.

This is fantastic. I will announce right off the bat that I did not 'measure' a single thing in this recipe...was feeding only two tonight so went with what felt right :) The green beans and zukes at my grocery store looked awful so I omitted them. My red pepper was already roasted and in a jar, so I added it to the pan right before the pasta so as not to make mush out of it. Wanted to make nothing else so I put some bacon in the oven after the veggies came out, chopped and added to the concoction once done. Scrumptious, we both loved it, thanks for a fabulous combo of ingredients!

This recipe is excellent and relatively easy to put together (just a lot of chopping).  I love that you can honestly modify the vegetables and get creative with it. My husband absolutely LOVES it and requests it almost every week!  I grill some simple seasoned chicken breast and either chop it up and mix it in, or just serve it on the side--if your family absolutely needs some meat.  But otherwise, this can stand on its own!

Great vegetable dish! I threw in a variety of vegetables and cooked in rosemary, thyme, oregano, and basil instead of Italian seasoning. After the vegetables were done cooking I used a packaged fresh "pasta herbs" and tossed them in with fresh lemon zest and the pasta.

I made this on Monday night and it was absolutely fabulous!  My husband complained that he could simply not walk past the leftovers, without having another portion!  I increased most of the ingredients, mainly because the quantities were a bit more as bought, and I did not want to waste anything.  I will be making this again and again, and I think my children and grandchildren, who are crazy about pasta, will also love this!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is 10 points for those of you on Weight Watchers.  It was quite good.  I used one T less oil when sauté ing the onions/garlic and also less Romano cheese.  Next time I would add more veggies to roast and toss with the pasta- but otherwise would not change a thing.   This is a great left- over dish, too.

This recipe was great! I used what vegetables I had in my fridge (mushrooms, broccoli, pepper, asparagus and tomatoes) and it turned out fantastic. The only thing I would change is a bit more lemon- with the amount of zest and lemon juice listed, it had a very slight hint of lemon that I would love to have more of. Definitely use fresh herbs - the dried stuff just won't cut it!

This was wonderful!  I read the reviews, and so left the balsamic vinegar out, and we added grilled chicken cut into bite size pieces --that was the only change for me.  I balsamic vinegar available, and my husband added at little to his, and it made it more zesty. Warm, beautiful, aromatic, -- this is definitely going to be made again!

Great, quick and delicious way to use up a ton of veggies. Very filling! My husband and 4-year-old enjoyed it. We used zucchini, red bell pepper, green/yellow beans, mushrooms, carrot, and onion as the roasted veggies. Seasoned with dried basil/parsley and decreased balsamic in sauce to 2Tbsp.

I left out the balsamic vinegar and didn't use butter or cheese to make it vegan. We used rice pasta (to make it gluten free) - fusili. As for vegetables, we used what we had on hand - zucchini and grape tomatoes from the garden, carrots, peppers, onions, and garlic. Nice healthy and light meal.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I was looking for something that was healthier, no-cream, lots of veggies.  This worked well.  I used some different vegetables.  I think the balsamic made it very interesting as well as the lemon zest.  I will definitely serve this again and again and will try it with a variety of vegetable.

This is a very good pasta recipe. It was light and had good flavor. I didn't change anything on the recipe except I used gluten free pasta from Tinkyada, which held up well when it was sautéed. Next time I might throw in some grilled chicken for a little protein.

This was an easy recipe to follow with great results. I did not have fresh basil and had to use dried. It was delicious but I can just imagaine how much better it would have been with fresh basil. I did not toss in the Romano cheese before serving. Each diner grated it fresh at the table. Yum!

This is a very tasty dish.  Easy to make.  I added two large jalapeno peppers sans the seeds and it just added a subtle spice.  Also, the local store did not have Romano cheese so I substituted parmesan.  Really going to enjoy the leftovers.

Love this recipe, can omit the salt (due to salt sensitivity) and enjoy loads of veggies.
