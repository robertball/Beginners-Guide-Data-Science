This recipe was great, but I put it together a little differently.  First I blended the frozen limade, rum, and mint together to make a base.  Then we let people add ice a club soda to their own cups to taste.  I found that a cup filled with ice and 2/3 base plus 1/3 soda was a good ratio.

This was a great recipe for a party.  It was easy and was great for a large crowd.  I made the mint limeaid mixture ahead and chilled it.  Then just poured over ice and topped with club soda and the lime.  Much better than making individual drinks.  Thanks will use this again.

I made this for a group of 12 women and had quite a bit leftover.  The recipe almost filled my punchbowl!  It is easy and quick, but didn't give me the same thrill I get with a "real" Mojito.  If I make this again, I will cut back on the water a little bit.  I suggest adding the water 2 cups at a time and tasting it to see where you like it.  By the time I added all the water, you could barely taste the rum.

These are simple enough that you could take the ingredients on a picnic or over to a friend's house for dinner and assemble them there. Note: even just a few pulses from a food processer will really pulverize the mint, resulting in a thick minty puree floating to the tops of the glasses. Very easy to solve -- just serve with straws.  These were easy to make and a big hit at the party.

Made these mojitos last weekend at our reception, and they were a  hit. Even my wine lovers loved the mojitos.
