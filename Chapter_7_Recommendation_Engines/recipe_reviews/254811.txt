It is an awesome recipe. I would highly recommend for holiday parties. 
For all those victims out there; maybe you should have spent more time with your crack head kid instead of being so easily offended by a receipe name. Get over yourself.

I already left my real review. This review is simply to try to offset the ridiculous people giving it a bad review because of the name. Get the heck out of here! Who does that?! Boycott the site and get lost if you’re that offended by something so stupid. These are just potatoes that are good you keep going back for. Addictive. Like......crack.

I've made this three times each time I've added something different. The first time I added chopped green onions to give it color and a different dimension. The second time I pre sautéed thinly sliced baby bella mushrooms along with the chopped green onions. And my last pass to the two previously added ingredients I crumbled some Ritz crackers sautéed those in butter and sprinkled on top of the cheese...and needless to say I get asked to make that every week for dinner in my home of only 4 people and there is never leftovers, they love it do much. I love this recipe because you can do all sorts of things with it. Though I will say it is better to use hidden valley ranch packs then store brand or McCormick's because the others tend to be to salty. (Or just use less)
My next adventure is to make a healthier version using reduced fat bacon (lol, right) fat free sour cream, halve olive oil and a pat of butter for the Ritz cracker topping using Reduced fat or lower sodium crackers. And reduced fat cheese. Oh snd oven sautéed mushrooms using butter flavored Pam. I wonder if my family will notice the difference!

Made as written using the cubed hashbrowns and these were really good. I thought the ranch might overpower but it didn't whatsoever. There is just the right amount of bacon so that you taste the smokiness in each bite yet it isn't overpowering either. I didn't see the footnotes until after I made this but I agree with the recipe submitter and will use shredded hashbrowns next time. I think ham would also work well in this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

If your kid is is on crack I feel for you. I was smoking that stuff in the 80s. The reason I am long ago free of it is because my dad never stopped making his sons work. We picked weeds and we sold fast food. We carried fright and we wore a Tux.  Baby your kids and good luck. Teach them to get a job. Yes I did crack in the 80s. In my 20s. I out grew it. Because I had a work ethic . My dad wasted no time teaching his sons how to work If you don't then you too are weak. Stop bitching and grab your kid by the throat. Make he or she stop. 

As for the recipe add the cream of chicken and wow. Excellent. Five Stars.

I was mentally prepared to love it and become an addict.  But honestly, it didn't quite make it for me.   Something is missing and I can't quite put my finger on it.  This much fat, carbs, and calories demands a bigger payoff on the palate.  


On the other hand, it's ridiculously easy to make.  Perfect for taking to a potluck.  If I make it again, I will scour the other reviews to see what others did to address that mysterious missing "something."


Update:  I haven't tried it yet, but it occurred to me that the "missing" element here may be the cream of chicken or mushroom soup that is included in other similar recipes.  The mixture seemed too dry going into the over, as was the finished result.  I'll try adding low-sodium (already enough salt here I think) soup next time.  But then we're already talking about a different recipe aren't we?

We loved this! I read from other reviews that it turned out dry. Not sure if that was really the case, but I added a can of cream of chicken soup to make sure it was extra creamy. It turned out amazing. I also cooked my bacon in the oven, which saved a little mess. I will be making this often! Thanks for posting the recipe!

I made this for our church fellowship meal, and It was almost gone before I got my plate! Everyone loved it, it was delicious! Will definitely make again. I made as written except I melted 1/4 cup of butter in bottom of my pan, only because of other reviews stating it was dry. Mine was not dry at all, also due to time crunch I used a 3oz container of hormel real bacon pieces. Turned out wonderful!! Next time will use real bacon. Thanks for the recipe!!

Pretty delicious.  I added sauted onions and heeded all the folks who said it was dry, so I added about a cup of milk and it came out tasty.

The recipe sounds very good and it received very good reviews.  But it was just so-so and I would seriously doubt Id make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this exactly to the recipe, and felt they were too dry.  The taste was ok, but my husband added ketchup to his, which you shouldn't have to. However, we used the leftovers and fried them with an egg on top, that was really good. But if you want a delicious creamy potato, I would stick to the tried and true cheesy potatoes with cream of chicken or celery soup, sour cream, and skip the ranch.

THANKS FOR ALL THE POSITIVE FEED BACK, IT HELPS WHEN YOUR'RE TRYING SOMETHING NEW....HAVE A BLESSED AND SAFE HOLIDAY SEASON!

This dish is ok, I added a half cup of mayonnaise, another half cup of cheese mixed in with the potatoes, two teaspoons of garlic powder and a couple tablespoons of dried onion for extra seasoning. I also added two beaten eggs to the potato mixture before baking. 

The name on this recipe is offensive, I call it cheesy potato bake when asked. Beyond being insensitive, it's incredibly trashy. I'm shocked your editors haven't changed it.

I made it  the first time as written, and we liked it but thought it a bit dry. The second time we were in a hurry and didn't have time to cook bacon, but did add some green onions to try to make up for the lack of bacon. We also precooked the potatoes in the microwave so it wouldn't have to bake as long. That worked out well, and I'll probably do that in the future every time. I also added some extra sour cream and cheese, and everyone liked it better.

We found the sour cream and ranch dressing too overpowering. Next time I will try with increased cheese and less of the sour cream combo. Leftovers made a nice farmer's breakfast the next morning.

My husband and I have both made this recipe. I am the queen of no time and quickness, so I modified the ingredients a bit to suit my taste. To each his own!. I substituted bacon pieces from a bag and added 2 tablespoons of bacon grease, for authenticity. I added salt, white pepper and Tony Chachere's original Creole seasoning for kick and last I used sharp, white cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Now this pan of Crack Potatoes didn't even last till the next day! My 83 year old mother, a hard palate -nut -to -crack had 2 helpings!

For the person who criticized the comments regarding naming these potatoes after crack, you should get over yourself.  Some of us are trying to make this a kinder and better world.  You are obviously not one of them.  Drug addiction and overdose are epidemic in this country.  For you to criticize a parent who has lost a child to this is disgusting and says a lot about your own lack of character.

I have made this twice for holiday dinners, and it was great both times.  I never thought to use frozen potatoes for a loaded potato recipe, but it is a real time saver.  First time I made it I followed directions exactly, except half way through baking it seemed dry so I added some heavy cream (about a cup) and they were perfect.  The second time, I needed to free up oven space for other items so I used a crock pot.  Cooked 2 hours on high then 2 hours on low, and they also turned out great.  Both times I was serving a large group so I doubled the recipe, hoping to have leftovers, but people devoured them!

This instantly became a household favourite. I use really good sour cream, the stuff in the yellow container? I think it’s called “Western” It’s a couple bucks more then regular sour cream but sooo worth it, it’s super creamy and gives the dish a creamy richness. I’m lazy so I used ready made bacon (gasp!!) and it turns out AMAZING every time. As in no leftovers because they devour it and ask for more. Highly highly recommend!

Yum! I used cubed hash browns. I was worried about the dish being dry after reading some reviews so I added a dash of milk in recipe, put the majority of the cheese into the mixture and cut up a half stick of unsalted butter and placed on top of mixture before covering with foil. I sprinkled the rest of the cheese on top along with extra. Perfection!

This tasted ok but did come out dry.  I did forget to put the tinfoil on for the first 10 minutes of cooking but still, it was way dryer than that would have made it.  Maybe I should have added more sourcream? My family did not like it at all.

I will begin by saying.--this recipe HAS POTENTIAL--hence the 4 stars. While the flavor was good, it was missing that "something" that makes you go "that was so worth the 5 lbs I gained eating this".... 
I made this as an alternative to the typical mashed potatoes for Christmas Dinner. I like to try something new on my table every year and this side was the chosen one. Unfortunately, this dish was kind of like the distant Aunt that wore tie-dye to the all white party. It was liked and appreciated, but it just does not fit into a side category for me. With that being said, I think with a few tweaks this would make a killer casserole or brunch item. 

TIPS: I agree with the majority on this --the mixture was dry. I anticipated that this would happen and automatically began altering the recipe in my head just in case.  Buttermilk--1/4 cup. It gave it a bit more twang and body. It increased the creamy texture. Texture fixed, flavor still meh.. so in went some  chives and 1/2 cup of Holy Trinity . 
I will make this again--as an entree. I will use the base, the  additions noted above and add Cajun seasonings, mushrooms and smoked sausage. It will be aces.

I used small red potatoes leaving skin on, microwaved them until done. Sprayed a casserole dish, placed potatoes side by side covering the entire bottom of the casserole dish, sliced an X in center of each then smashed them with a big spoon. Then added a pat of butter to each potato, sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar cheese or your favorite cheese that goes well with potatoes. Then sprinkled pieces of crispy fried bacon on top. Baked at 375 for about 20-30minutes until cheese is melted. Removed from oven, sprinkled chopped chives on top. Each serving was about two potatoes then sour cream was spooned on top on the plate. Very easy and yummy with the potato skin crispy but the mix of sweetish red potato, butter, cheese and bacon was delicious! My new special occasion or everyday dish! Loved it!

These were delicious!  Read other comments. Can’t imagine how they could have been dry. I sauteeded a small onion and added it to the mix. I’m going to be serving it again and again over the holidays.

I used 2 cartons of "Golden Grill Russet Hashbrown Pototoes" and bottled ranch dressing and Mexican cheese, because that is what I had on hand, but it was great.  My husband said he diffinently would like for me to make it again.

Pretty good. I admit to tweeking per other reviews. Added sautéed onions, garlic and onion powder, and a little milk. Husband loved them. Went well with our ham steaks. I also halved recipe for the two of us and still made a bunch.

Huge hit. I was asked for the recipe. Instead of sour cream and ranch mix, I used a canola ranch dressing (food allergy accommodation). I also sprinkled crumbled bacon on top. I will make again, repeatedly.

I would not make it again. I followed the recipe exactly and it was much too dry. I have another recipe that is much better and will rely on that one for my next dinner party.

I cut the recipe in half and I think it could still be 8 servings, so yes, it feeds a lot! I only added some green onions to the mix and kept the bacon as a topping to accommodate all the eaters. I also used less cheese on top just because. Everyone loved it and I can see taking it to a work or family gathering because it is simple to make and well affordable for feeding the masses! Thank you for sharing

Very good recipe, the family loved it.  Super simple.  I added more bacon (because it's bacon!).  I thought it needed a little more kick so next time I'll add garlic powder, maybe something a little spicy, or maybe just add 2 packages of the dry ranch mix instead of 1.

After coming home from the grocery store I realized that I forgot the Ranch Dressing mix. After reading some reviews about dryness I decided not to go back & get it. I used Ranch Dressing instead to moisten it and I did have to add a little milk to cut the thickness. The dressing flavor was really subtle. I halved the recipe. There are only two in our house now. I had one small scoop. My husband, who isn't a big eater,  liked it so much he ate all the rest.

Very simple recipe. Just finished putting it together. Will bake in the morning to take to our church pot luck luncheon. I was a bit lazy though. I used Oscar Mayer Real Bacon recipe pieces. It's a 2.8 oz. bag.  Will out again after our luncheon.

Glad I only made 1/2 of this recipe.  We did not like the ranch dressing mix in these potatoes.  Much better potato casserole recipes on this site and any other site you want to look at.

Added half a cup of green onions. Outstanding recipe. Took it to the inlaws for Thanksgiving and they wouldn't let me take the one serving left home with me. Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly how it said and it is fantastic.  My wife says it's fabulous.  Great flavor combination.  For me, I am a spicy kind of person, so I think I would add a tablespoon of sriracha in the mix, sometimes.  Thanks for the recipe and we'll keep it for many more meals to come.

I would try using simply potatoe southwestern hashbrowns x 1 pkage and regular hashbrowns x 1 pkage.  This would add some great spice to it which is what I think is missing from this recipe.   It needs a little "heat"

I made it 2X once following the recipe and with O'Brien potatoes instead of the hash browns and O'Brien potatoes added exactly what was missing to make this over the top!  I also added black cracked pepper.   Hash browns I give it a 3...O'Briens I give it a 5

These were a great recipe for a BBQ I had. They were a bit drier than I prefer. I made some alterations as I doubled the recipe. I added 2 packages of bacon, sautéed some garlic and onions in butter and lastly added a bit more cheese than called for. It is possible that I caused them to be drier by adding the extra stuff. So I am giving it 5 stars assuming it was my fault. Will add more sour cream next time to go along with my changes.

Amazingly delicious!!! I used a 1/2 cup of olive oil, drizzled on the top then generously along the edges to make it extra crispy, yum!! Did that when I took off the foil.

I used cubed potatoes out of the freezer and it was barely warm after 45 minutes.  I increased temp to 425 and cooked it another thirty.  I added some can milk and most of a can of cream of chicken soup because it looked so dry.

I've only made these once. The ranch dressing was way too overpowering. If I do make them again I will only add 1/4 of the ranch mix.

Made this for Fathers Day brunch.  Huge hit.  The only minor change I made was to add a splash of 1/2 and 1/2.  Milk would also work.  So much better than those cream based soup recipes!!

Ranch seasoning adds a ton of flavor. Great result for very little effort. I didn’t read the thawed part or saving cheese for the top. I had to bake it an additional 30 mins uncovered to cook the hashbrowns from frozen. The idea of this recipe lends itself to so many variations that I cannot wait to try!

I used the advice of other reviewers and added the cream of chicken soup.  I also doubled the bacon, because there's no such thing as too much bacon, right?  It was really good.  Everyone loved it, and I have a request to make it for Easter brunch.  I will definitely make this again.

My rating is based on the ease of preparing this dish.  I cannot fairly rate the flavor/texture as I went off of some of the other reviews and added a can of cream of chicken soup.  This resulted in a mound of oatmeal basically.  One big pan of gluey potatoes.  I'll report back if I try it again without the soup.

It’s just OK, nothing to brag about. It wasn’t gross but I won’t bring it to a pot luck again. Less than half of the pan was eaten at the potluck, I brought home leftovers and ended up throwing away 1/4 of the pan.

It was very good. Read other reviews that it was a little dry so i poured a 1/4 cup of milk over the finished recipe before putting in oven.  Turned out moist.   I halved the recipe because  only three of us.  Added a little extrt cheese on top to.  Will likely make again.

If I was going to do these again, I’d put in a bit less of the ranch. Otherwise it was great! Everyone ate it all.

Good but not worth the fat, sodium and calories. Have to also agree that the name turns me off. The first time I saw a recipe called "crack" something I thought it was a bit funny, now its overdone. I can see how some people don't think its funny.

I made this tonight and as others have reported it came out dry. I added about a 1/4 cup of chopped green onion. Delicious and great flavor but sadly dry. I'll definitely make again just with some chicken broth or condensed cheddar soup, maybe a dash of milk... something. Thanks for the recipe!

I so wanted to love this, but I just didn't. I followed the recipe and although it was super easy it was just missing something in flavor and creaminess. This is a great base to start but I think I will be tweaking it in the future. It is so easy to make that I will make it again but with a few modifications to pump up the flavor and creaminess.

I was so disappointed. I have to wonder if the reviewers that gave this recipe 5 stars have ever tried other cheesy potato casseroles.  I made this for my grand children and family and they picked at it but no one went back for seconds. My husband wondered why I tried something new. My usual cheesy potato casserole is soooo much better. No where near addictive for my family.

Very tasty. Next time I may leave it bake a few more minutes to get the potatoes softer, but that just comes down to preference. I added more cheese. Can't have to much cheese.

Didn't really care for it...To salty for me from the ranch dressing mix. Every time I try a "through it together recipe" I regret it.
Can't go wrong with a baked potato with all the goodies on top.

Excellent potatoes, I don't care what you call them! Will add a little more sour cream next time. At first I thought they were a little dry, but the leftovers were creamier the next day. My guests loved them and even my husband that doesn't like "hash brown casserole" commented on how good the potatoes were.

I guess it was "really" good because by the time I got down the line it was  gone so I scraped out the dish just to get a taste.  I made it for a church social and will be making it again but probably two!

I’ve made differing variations of this for a few years. I’ve used both shredded and cubed hash browns. They are equally good. I’ve used the Ranch flavoring, and none. The family favorite is 
sharp cheddar, bacon, green onions and red peppers. I then use a can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with one half cup cream. Pour that all over the casserole. Then top it with cheese then a little Stove Top Stuffing mix (chicken). Right out of the canister.

Very good! I made it in a crock pot for a pot luck. Added a can of cream of chicken and a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and that was it. Really very good and super easy took about 3 hours on low heat.

Very rich and tasty recipe.  I’ve made it numerous times and it’s a crowd pleaser.  I do prefer to add a half an onion, ground pepper, and 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  Overall, great recipe!

Made it for my husband and I exactly as written, but halved it. We loved it. Then made it again for a potluck, was a hit!! Think I might add green onions next time. Thanks for the recipe. So easy!

Tasty but not exceptional.  I'm thinking covering the top with scrambled eggs after it cooks might make it a good brunch item.

It was the texture of thick paste. If I were to make it again I’m not putting that much sour cream in. It’s sour to the taste. And cutting the amount of cheese. And I’m a big fan of both of them.

These potatoes were very simple and easy to make. The taste was disappointing.  Based on the reviews, I thought they would be flavorful and a recipe I would love and use again and again. I found them mediocre at best and would not make them again.

It was absolutely delicious, but I think next time I might add a bit of onion to it.  It was a big hit with my husband as-is, so that's a big plus in my book!!

So. So. Disappointing. Cooking the sour cream and the cheese kills their flavor a bit. This was underwhelming for an ingredient list that sounded so good. It needed salt and pepper and something else... onions, maybe?

I make this but add a can of cream of mushroom soup. Use Cambells not a store brand. It does make a difference.  We also leave out the ranch dressing because I usually make ranch chicken to go with this.  Yum

My family didn’t love it, so I won’t be making again. It was dry and needed something to make it creamier.

My family has been making this casserole for forever!  But with adding a can of mushroom soup and diced ham.  Yum!

I love this! I've made this twice now. I add hamburger and French fried onions to the mix. I also crush French fried onions and put them on top with the cheese. It's definitely a hit in my home!!

They were amazing!! Even my husband said "yum" and he's not a ranch fan!! Only 4 stars because I added a can of cream of chicken soup (I had an old recipe that called for it and I like it in there) and I substituted the sour cream for plain Greek yogurt.

I read reviews and added 2/3 cup of milk since I wanted them to be on the moist side and it came out perfect. We even had it for breakfast with spam and eggs! So good!

I made this yesterday for a potluck and it turned out great. The only adjustments I made was to add a little chopped sweet onion and increase the cheese just a bit.

I made this for a neighborhood potluck and there was a lot left over.  It sounded so good but it turned out very dry.  I re-read the reviews and will try it one more time using others suggestions.

I made this for my family and they loved it. I did add 1/2 stick of melted butter. I also forgot to defrost the potatoes, but made no difference. Would definitely make this again for  a pot luck, or dinner party.

The ranch was not overwhelming after cooking.  Tried it with cauliflower first, then with fresh potatoes.  Added some chopped onion, used cream of cheddar soup instead of cheese and light sour cream to drastically reduce fat content, and it still tasted great, though a bit over salty---probably used too many bacon bits (real)  @ 2.5 oz.  Also added some egg white for cohesion as I didn't use cheese, which increased uncovered cooking time by ten minutes.  Tasted great, super easy, and will definitely make it again.  Considering adding ground beef for full meal casserole- should be an improvement on tater tot casserole made with cream of mushroom soup.
