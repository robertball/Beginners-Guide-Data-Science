Delicious! I couldn't resist adding some red onion, but that was my only change. The dressing is fantastic (I made it earlier in the day and put it in a jar, so I could shake it every so often to dissolve the brown sugar). Great flavor combo and easy to make with ingredients I usually have on hand. Nice and refreshing, this is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Super yummy! I did add almonds as well. I think it needs a bit of salt and pepper to the dressing, which I did not add. Will try again this summer!

Easy recipe.  I kept mostly to the original but as Hubby is not a fan of feta cheese, I substituted shaved Asiago.
Light and tasty salad.

The only change I made to the recipe was to decrease the sugar in the dressing.  I took it to a July 4th party and it looked pretty in the glass bowl and was very tasty.

I was getting bored with my daily salad for lunch, and decided to give this a try.  Excellent is an understatement.  This salad is so simple, and so delicious!  I followed the directions exactly, and can't think of a thing to improve on it.  I love it.
