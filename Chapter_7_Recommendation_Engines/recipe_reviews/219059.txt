Very good though I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. Thanks so much for sharing.

Having lived in Georgia for over four years now, I haven't been able to find a baked beans recipe I was happy with. My family loves the dark colored baked beans at BBQ restaurants down here, but I have been unable to find a similar recipe.. until today. I had a 28 ounce can of Bush's Boston flavored beans, so I adjusted the seasoning since the beans already had some flavoring in it. I didn't have any mesquite seasoning, so we just went without it and I didn't have any dried mustard, so I just put a squirt of regular yellow mustard. These beans are yummy! The BBQ sauce (I used Sweet Baby Ray's) made the beans a darker color and gave it a really good flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe Aleasa. I printed it and will definitely be making them again.  :)

You can use any unseasoned pork and beans such as Van Camps etc.

Followed this recipe one time about 5 years ago for a covered dish dinner at my office. From that point on I have never again been given the option to bring what I wanted but insisted that I bring the beans regardless to the occasion. These beans ROCK !!!!!

Super delicious baked beans!  I only used 2 T molasses hence the 1 star ding.
You can find Bush's at Costco in Canada as well.  Thanks for posting a fabulous side aleasa!

Delicious beans. I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar because Bush's are so sweet anyway.  Really easy to make and the oven doesn't have to be on for an hour.  I thought the meat might be too much, but these were scarfed up at a 4th of July picnic, and there were plenty of burgers. ;-}.

Somehow this recipe just seemed a bit off to me.  Normally, I can sort of tell what something will taste like before, but I'd never mixed ingredients in this way.  Lucky I did though, because they turned out really well.  I took another users advice and used pork and beans and they still turned out good.  I'll be saving this one.  Don't be like me and assume the BBQ sauce will be overpowering.  It was a very mild after taste.

I guess I’m too used to my baked beans, so this was  way too sweet for me as written.  I also did not like the ground beef texture here, but I did really like the mesquite smokiness and the cayenne.  I also prefer using dried beans to start with, much less gloopy with no extra sugar or weird stuff.  I’ll definitely use the mesquite and cayenne in my next batch of bbq beans, so thanks for the great idea.

This is a great recipe to make for summer grilling sides. Mesquite seasoning can be found in grill seasoning packets, usually around a dollar. The recipe does not call for the whole packet so it would be easy to double this recipe. I followed the recipe but decided to throw in another can of beans. Still tasted delicious and didn’t mess up the flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

Every time I make these beans, they get rave reviews.

The only modification I make is that I flatten out the hamburger meat to about 1/4 thick on a piece of foil, rub on the bbq seasoning, and transfer to a wire rack that I use for smoking jerky. I smoke the hamburger for a couple hours before crumbling up it up and continuing the recipe as needed.

I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty for 4. I used my favorite BBQ sauce (Corkys) and it turned out great.  If you like  BBQ baked beans, you will like this.

After the first time that I made this recipe, I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup and I prefer B&M baked beans. This is a crowd pleaser!

Didnt follow to the letter, added a bit more mustard powder and a little less molasses and brown sugar. But fabulous! So much so, my guests were fighting over the leftovers. Good sign!

My fiance was crazy about it and said we definitely have to make this again.  I'd never tried baked beans made with ground beef before this, and I really like the flavor it gives it.  Great recipe and easy to make.

Pure awesomeness!!  I only used 1/8 of brown sugar to prevent too much sweetness, since Bush's BB is already sweetened with brown sugar. These have amazing flavor. Definitely a keeper!

Very good recipe, it was a hit with everyone who ate it! I used bacon instead of beef though. The BBQ sauce was a good brand and had some kick to it, I then added the optional red cheyenne to a little more spice. These were ever better the next day once they sat over night in the refrigderator.

My husband and I just tried this recipe for supper and it's delicious! Thanks for sharing! Although next time, because I have a super sweet tooth, I think I'll try doubling the amount of molasses and brown sugar (this was the reason for the 4-star rating). However, the recipe itself was great!

Had a get together at the house last night and decided to try these beans. They were amazing! I doubled the recipe to accommodate the amount of  people I was feeding (about 25) and they disappeared. Everyone kept asking how I made them, it was my secret. The only thing I changed was that I used my own brisket rub in place of the mesquite seasoning. They turned out phenomenal!

Pretty good.  I will use this recipe until another I like better comes along.  Made as written except for cutting back a bit on the molasses and brown sugar.  It was plenty sweet.

I made these and everyone asked for the recipe and requested I make them again. Hubby said it was a keeper!  Loved the smokey flavor with the ground meat. Best baked bean recipe we've had in a long time!  Won't be looking for a new one anytime soon!  Thanks Aleasa!!! :)

I reduced the sugar as well.  Any canned deep browned baked beans will do. Also substituted the "real" bacon bits from Hormel or Costco instead of the burger because I was short of time and always have a bag on hand.  Served at a block party and everyone was asking who brought those fabulous beans!
