I liked it.  Since I only had 1/4 cup lentils, I added 1/4 cup pearl barley and 1/2 cup bulgur.  I think I'll always make it this way.  I do think it needs a little more garlic.

We all enjoyed this,  even my 8 year old ate it no questions asked.  It wasn't very visually appealing so I sprinkled some parm on the top of our bowl and it looked a lot better.

Great flavor. Used yellow lentils, so it turned into more of a stew than a casserole. Substitutes tomato sauce for chopped tomatoes, which worked well.
