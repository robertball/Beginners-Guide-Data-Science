I recently hosted a salad bar buffet. Everyone loved this salad! I sub'd radishes for the green pepper and used 1/3 of an envelope of ranch dressing in the mayo. After 12 hours in the fridge this salad became extremely crunchy and flavorful. Perhaps the moisture from the frozen peas drips down through the rest of the layers to make it so.This salad also eliminated the need for 14 different bottles of dressing on the table.You get a lovely green salad taste with a very light and flavorful dressing that melds all the veggie flavors together.Kraft Foods does it again!

Hubby and I were nervous about a salad that was just topped with Mayo.  But I made it early in the day for a dinner party and put it in the refrigerator.  I forgot to buy celery, so that was left out, and we love egg in salad, so we added that.  Used red peppers instead of green, cuz that's what I had.  We were pleasantly surprised at dinner to discover this is an AWESOME salad.  It is SO good.  Doesn't even taste like you're eating salad, it's so good.  Oh yeah...also used that new ready to serve bacon sliced up, and i did NOT thaw the peas.  Yum, Yum, Yum.  Sounds like a lot of changes I guess...but that just means this is a flexible recipe, and who doesn't like that?

This is my favorite recipe but I have always added  cucumbers, chopped water chestnuts, and have used red onion instead of green onions.  I layer the salad vegetables, add 3T of sugar to the  1 cup of mayonnaise and add the mayonnaise mixture.  I then add the bacon, cheese and sliced hard boiled egg.  LOVE this salad!  The mayo mixture "seeps down to coat it all!

Great Salad, teens love it. I did change it a bit.I sprinkled the 1st layer with sugar, added a layer of sliced hard boil eggs ( 6 eggs adds a little protein!), standing some of the slices on their edge next to bowl.It looks nice, skipped  the celery and green peppers, but added 1 1/2 cups of Jarlsburg cheese over the thawed and drained peas and bacon then sealed with the salad dressing. I always use Miricle Whip. I decorated the top with cheese and shallots

Excellent recipe!  I used this as one of my side dishes for Thanksgiving...it was a HIT.  The flavors blend in nicely with each other, and it looks beautiful in a 'pedestal' glass dish.  I actually made the mistake of adding minced onion to the mayonnaise instead of using the green onions, but it was still very delicious all the same.  I will certainly use this recipe again!!!

This salad was a BIG hit at a brunch I made. It was gobbled up. I did add parmesan to the mayo and added red pepper for some colour. Will surely make this again. Thanks.

I can't cook and everytime I try it is "OK".  My boyfriend's mother, on the other hand, is the "greatest cook ever".  He said this tastes just like his mom's and could we have it at least once a week.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  You have made me a star!!!

I found this recipe to be very quick and easy.  I do not like green peppers and substituded with brocoli instead and it was very yummy!  I plan on taking this to many picnics in the future.

This was a terrific salad.  I made it for a family get together and everyone loved it.  My dad said he could eat it everyday.  I took a suggestion from another reader and added sugar to the mayo and used a little less.  It was very good.  Will make again.  It could even be a great salad for the holidays.

Great recipe!  I used turkey bacon and light mayonnaise to lighten up the calories. (I really believe that in recipes like this, you can substitute turkey for bacon, light mayo for regular, etc.) Just a few things that can help.....then you can have more!

This is a great salad - I usually mix the mayo with a couple tablespoons sugar first.  I also add diced eggs & tomatoes to the layers.  This is good for potlucks but doesn't keep well - only about one day max.  So don't make prepare too far in advance!

This salad is great!! I put the bacon on top with the cheese instead of on top of the lettuce. I think it adds more visual appeal to the salad. I also add about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar to the mayo before I put on the salad. Substitued thin sliced red onion instead of the green onions. Will also add 1 can of water chestnuts on top of the lettuce. Every time you make this salad it is a BIG hit!!

I brought this salad to a party and it was devoured!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The only change I made was to add brown sugar, cumin, garlic powder, cinnamon and tumeric to the mayo before adding it to the salad.

Your recipe is not as good as "Our" South African version. You need hard boiled egss, a variety of peppers, feta cheese and if possible, sprouts as well. The idea is to have seven layers and to scrunch through them. DO NOT TOSS. Do not thaw peas.  Shred the lettuce or salad greens and then they will not go brown. Salad lasts for days.

I took this salad to a family gathering and it was the first to go!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of Fox Point seasoning (from Penzeys Spices which is a blend of salt, shallots, chives, garlic, onion, and green peppercorns)to the mayo.  It gave the salad a litte "kick"!

Delicious recipe, however VERY high in fat (over 58 g per serving, based on 6 servings, almost 90% of the recommended allowance for a whole day!!!) and high in calories as well (over 554 just for the mayo, cheese and bacon alone, not counting the other ingredients). OK, If you are not counting calories.
That is why I am rating it lower than 5 stars.

Love this salad.  I changed it around somewhat, but that is one of great things about this recipe, you can adapt it to any taste. I eliminated the green pepper layer, and added a layer of toasted slivered almonds, also added a layer of cooked cubed chicken and topped the salad with a ring of diced, seeded Roma tomatoes.  Looked great and tasted fantasic.  Just added some French Bread and a glass of white wine and we had a great supper.  Perfect for a hot summer day!

I don't eat this myself, but I do enjoy making it.  I make it every Thanksgiving for my dad, who loves seven-layer salad.  My mom says she just can't seem to make it right.  I'm very patient (she is not), so this is an easy dish for me.  It takes patience to get the layers just right.  I use a tall glass dish so you can see all the layers through the glass. Makes a colorful sight at the dinner table.

Long-time family favorite!  I usually sub cucumbers for the celery and red pepper for the green and I add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the mayo before spreading over the top.  Great way to get veggies in your diet!!
