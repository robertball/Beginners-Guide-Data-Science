Made as written and this was pretty good. My husband found the mint to be a bit overwhelming and I found the same to be true with the basil. So on that note I would use less of each next time but keep the cilantro the same. Typically cilantro tends to overpower but not in this combo. I served this hot and it was still a perfect summertime meal. Thanks for sharing!

I’m really not sure how to rate this recipe. Overall it tasted good but the smell when I added the fish sauce was soooo nasty and it just permeated throughout the house. And even when eating it you could still smell the fishy smell. Just for reference I like anchovies which is what fish sauce is mostly made out of so I can’t explain why I found it so foul smelling. I did use slightly less fish sauce then the recipe called for and if I make it again I will use about half the amount and see if that makes a difference.  So I gave the recipe 4 stars because it did taste good (very flavorful) but I just don’t know if I could make it again. If I add the experience of the smell it’s more like a 2 star.

Great tasting recipe that was easy to do and my guests raved about it! I will say though that as much as we like spicy, I opted to add only one heaping teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of 3 tablespoons as the recipe calls for. I also replaced the fish sauce with the same amount of melted peanut butter.

Not authentic (sorrynotsorry, I lived in Thailand for 5 years) BUT quite easy and quick.  Didn't have peanuts, so dropped back 5 and punted with peanut butter.  Cut back on the lime and fish sauce a wee bit.  Added a bit more mint b/c I think it freshens the dish.  Again, overall, good and easy.  Served it with kow neow - sticky rice - the way it's meant to be!  But if you're low carb, it certainly will work with lettuce!

Delicious way to use ground chicken! We stuffed it in pitas topping with bleu cheese and sautéed onions and mushrooms. The sweet/tangy flavor from the lime juice was great.
