I love this granola! It's delicious. I didn't have the spelt flour so I used ww pastry. Only had sugar free pancake syrup so I used that for the maple syrup. Turned out perfect, thanks!

I totally appreciate a recipe that can cut fat yet doesn't sacrifice much, if anything. This recipe fits that bill. There is a subtle difference between this and one that uses more oil and boils a syrup first, but it's not a 'step down' kind of difference. This one won't 'chunk up' because of that and seems a little drier, but has so much flavor! I was skeptical that the applesauce would produce a crisp granola, but it worked! Very crisp. Must be the flour that helps it along. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 ground flax to make up for the spelt flour I didn't have. I also left out the maple syrup I didn't have and this was plenty sweet. I added in almonds for the pecans, and dried blueberries for the apricots(topped with a few fresh for the photo). Fyi, this makes about 4 cups. Thank you so much for the recipe. It will be made often in this kitchen.

This recipe has great potential, but something was missing. I made it with the spelt flour, cut the amount of brown sugar in half, subbed raisins for apricots and almonds for half of the pecans. I also used molassas instead of some of the maple syrup. It was tasty, but needed something else. I added a little salt and will use less flour next time, as well as add some vanilla. Thanks for a good base recipe!

It was SO GOOD.

I didn't have apricots, spelt, or flax, so I substituted dried cranberries, whole wheat flour, and wheat germ. Except I completely screwed up and put in 1/2 cup of wheat germ instead of just three tablespoons. But it turned out incredible! The biggest problem I had in the past with making granola was that I couldn't get any of the clusters to hold together, but this one clustered up absolutely beautifully. I'm thrilled. And can't stop eating it!

Great recipe, a favorite at our house. I generally cut the sugar in half, especially since I always quadruple the recipe for our large family.

This granola is great and very simple to make!  Our almost three-year-old daughter and I had fun working on this together.  I made three substitutions: Instead of spelt flour: used whole wheat flour, instead of Canola oil: used EVOO, and instead of maple syrup: used molasses.  Also, we added 2 tsp of vanilla and 3 Tbs of wheat germ.  Delish and nutrish!

This was excellent. I added dried cranberries to the mix and substituted slivered almonds for the pecans. I used about half the sugar. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was delicious. I think next time I make it I will substitute honey for the syrup (just a preference) and add different seeds and nuts. A terrific base recipe for light and healthy granola!!

I didn't have any applesauce, so I used a 1/4 c (total) of canola oil- and I'm pretty sure that's why it didn't come out as sweet as I would have expected. It also burned slightly, but that was my oven's fault. :) I will try again with the applesauce, but as it was it was just okay.

Love that I can make granola low fat!!!  This was a great, easy recipe that would be wonderful with a variety of dried fuits and/or nuts.  I chose to use dried cranberries and the tartness was a nice compliment to the sweet granola.  I really enjoyed using this in my yogurt and berry parfaits.

Awesome recipe! Very easy to personalize and swap out other dried fruits like prunes and cranberries. I use white wheat flour instead of spelt and typically double or triple the recipe so it lasts longer because it's so yummy with yogurt in the mornings!

this is a very tasty base to granola.  definitely will use this again,  I subbed flax seed and whole wheat flour for spelt flour and molasses for maple syrup.  I also added two drops of maple flavor. 
don't stress about the apple sauce making it too moist,  this turned out perfect.  thank you!

This was disappointing. I loved the concept of low-fat granola, but it didn't deliver. The flour made it dry, and it was lacking flavor. If you do make it, add a splash of vanilla and a handful of craisins.

My family didn't like this as much as other granola recipes I've made. It was lacking in the flavor department.

This is a good recipe. If you don't have spelt flour, use whole wheat flour.  It clumps nicely and tastes great.  What more can we ask for?

This is the best granola recipe I've ever tried. I subbed some chia seeds for part of the flax, used only 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and used dried cranberries and raisins instead of the apricots. I also added a little bit of salt and some vanilla extract. I love that it actually clumps up and gets nice and crunchy just like regular granola. Yummy!

My new go-to granola recipe!  Super easy, no need to cook anything on the stovetop.  I used ww flour, and swapped out the fruit and nuts called for for sliced almonds and blueberry craisins.  Ready to make another batch today!
