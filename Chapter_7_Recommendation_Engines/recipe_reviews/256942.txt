Will make again. My only complaint was that I didn't think it had enough kick. I did simmer it an hour or two longer due to having to make it ahead.  I will try again timing it better or adding more spice. Thanks for the ideas.

I substituted the tomato sauce with 3 vine tomatoes quartered, 2lbs chuck, 3/4 of a 6oz can tomato paste, 7 5-6 in Chinese eggplants and 1 1/2 tsp saffron.  I also used chef John's recipe for tzaziki sauce and omitted the dill.  It came out AWESOME.  My whole family loved it.
