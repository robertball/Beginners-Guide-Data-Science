I made this last night for dinner because it's fall in Seattle and I had some green tomato's from off the vine.  I  used corn meal with bread crumbs and flour first then pan fried to make sure they were crispy. Then layered all and baked. Used more parm cheese than told on top and served over thin spaghetti with chicken on the side and it was AWESOME !!  I will be doing this more often whenever I can. Thanks Bertholf .

I am picky about my green tomatoes so I did make one change. I fried them in a bit of oil instead of baking. I've never had any luck baking them in the past. Plus, I wanted that extra crunch. This turned out really good and much better than eggplant! The tang of the green tomatoes goes perfectly in this. Definitely a keeper! Be sure to use a sauce you are familiar with and like.

This is a great way to use green tomatoes. I used medium size tomatoes in a slightly larger pan and still had some left over, which I used to make fried green tomatoes. So the baking time was longer. I also prebaked them for a little bit longer. Otherwise I followed the instructions as given. It was delicious, and I will definitely make it again.

I cut the recipe in half so it served 4-5 people. Served it over angel hair pasta that I had added garlic, butter and parmesan tossed together

This was perfect, I had so many green tomatoes that came out of my garden when I cleared it.  This used almost all of them and loved the way this tasted!

Added hamburger meat to sauce and sprinkled in some sauteed mushrooms.  Also used fresh basil on top . Great recipe. Will make again. Love the fried green tomatoes.
