A nice idea, but this cookie was so sweet it hurt my mouth.  The recipe instructions do not indicate what to do with the 2 cups of sugar, so I blended them with the butter, added the flour, then added the vanilla bean/walnut mixture.  I will probably make these again, but cut the sugar in half or maybe try substituting some of it with powdered sugar.  Also if your vanilla beans are small, you might want to add two for more vanilla flavor.

Why 2x sugar?  It sounds similar to my mother's recipe, but we never chopped up the vanilla bean into the sugar.  She dipped the cookies into vanilla sugar made with a vanilla bean stored for at least a week in sugar.
