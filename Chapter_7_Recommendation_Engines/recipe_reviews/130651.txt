I'm a Lithuanian and tried to make Kugelis myself following this recipe. There were few things I have done differently to make it as closet to what I have eaten in my home country. First of all in Lithuania we do not use Russet potatoes. I actually hardy ever use this sort of potatoes at all - too dry. My favourites are, and this what I used in this recipe, "Yukon yellow". You most definitely have to use the smallest grader available. It has to be a "mash" out of row potatoes. Take a cheese cloth and squeeze out juice. Leave juice stand for a while for starch to build on the bottom. You will have to remove juice and put the starch back into potato mash. I used 5 pound of potatoes and 6 eggs. However after I fried onions and bacon, I  only added about 1/3 into the potatoes mash and did not use any additional butter. Fat from bacon is more then enough for this dish. Also I did only use about 1/4 cup of evaporated milk. Just a note, next time I will use regular milk or cream. Can not remember even seeing evaporated milk in the stores in Lithuania, only the sugary type. Bake for a hour. Serve with sour cream and the left over bacon and onions mix. Gero apetito!!!

I made sure to drain-out the water from the shredded potatoes.  The kugelis came out delicious -- good enough for my Lithuanian father-in-law to comment how great it is!

Everyone in my family has made this many times and I have been eating and making all the variations for 30 years now.  Some things to note are that you need to finely shred the potatoes (like mashed raw, not like cheese); use salted butter at your own risk, but add salt and pepper to the mix to taste; use nice cheap fatty bacon, stick it in the freezer for a bit to make it easy to dice raw; coming from my Lithuanian family, a bit more bacon never hurt (I use and extra 1/2 lb); and, finally, serve with real sour cream (not light or fat free, this is a Lithuanian recipe!). All in all, this is a recipe you have to perfect on your own, but is well worth the trouble!

This is a family tradition (yes, Lithuanian!) However we use chopped bacon & diced ham. We just chop everything up in the food processor, shred the potato, transfer all into a large bowl, add eggs & evaporated milk, transfer to a baking dish (coated with Pam for easy clean-up!) and bake at 350 for about an hour. The flavor is AMAZING!!! We also serve with a dollop of sour cream. Just as a note - you can freeze leftover ham (from holidays) and leftover bacon and thaw them out when you're ready to make the Kugeli! :)  No need to have anything pre-cooked except the bacon, just to get rid of the excess grease.  I disagree with the review who said the potatoes have to be thinly shredded - we just use a standard shred, my grandmother used to use an old fashioned grater and it comes out PERFECT!!! :)  Enjoy!!!!

I hate rating this recipe so low.  I made this tonight exactly as listed, and although the dish came out of the oven looking beautiful, it was very bland.  I realized after the fact that there was no salt or pepper in the recipe, and even though I added salt on my plate, and tried it with a dollop of sour cream, it still wasn't enough.  I'll try to salvage the leftovers with some cheese, but I don't imagine I can do much more.  Sorry.

Time consuming but worth the effort. I liked that you did not have to squeeze the juice out of the potatoes. We made this for an ethnic day at my childs school, every one enjoyed this dish.

Major flaw: where's the salt? You'll need about 1 T per kg, less if your bacon is on the salty side. I grate one raw onion in with the potatoes, and use extra bacon or other smoked meats (try smoked chicken thighs!). I always strain the potato mush and pour off the liquid, retaining the starch, but you don't have to. Absolutely delicious!

I also used Yukon Gold potatoes, they didn't seem to brown after peeling. I halved the recipe but only used 4 slices of thick cut bacon for 2 lbs of potatoes, this was sufficient but bacon lovers could use more. I only used 2 T. of butter but think it would work without it. I don't know how anyone got 5lbs of potatoes in a 9x13 dish, my 2 pounds filled mine to the top and I only used 3 eggs and 6 oz of evaporated milk. Unless you have a very large family I think my version would work well for most. Excellent recipe no need to squeeze the potatoes, make it easy on yourself. Also don't forget to add SALT!

I am Lithuanian, both my grandparents came from Lithuania and my grandmother would make this for every Thanksgiving and Christmas since I was a little girl. It was something I very much looked forward too, but every time I asked for the recipe she said she didn't have one and did a little something different every time. Now that she is almost 90, I wanted to make this for her for Christmas. I don't really follow recipes to the exact (that's just how I cook) so I probably used more bacon and more butter than the recipe called for, but it was excellent and everyone loved it!!!! The only thing I noticed different from my grandmothers version is I used a food processor to shred the potatoes and that gave them a different consistency in the finished product than when she would hand shred them (to a mush like consistency). Also, I did make sure to squeeze out the excess water as many other's have suggested.

Thanks Marinka.p my great grand-mother was Lithuanian and passed this Kugelis recipe down to us. Although, I am the last in the family to still use it, the others think it is unhealthy. But she did live to a good age of 89. With my recipe, Yukon Gold (I think yellow is the same thing. Although, I shredded the 5lbs of potatoes, then in a large bowl mixed in the 2 large white onions (diced), bacon, and milk. I didn't see the use of adding butter with the bacon. One thing I was taught differently was to save the bacon grease and about 1/2 though the  baking, pour 1/2 of the grease over the dish and the other 1/2 about 3/4 into the cooking time. (1/2 hour and 45 minute marks). I served with Kielbasa with Peppers and Onions slow cooked in oil and side of sour cream. The other 1/2 of me is Irish and we love potatoes, so it is a great dish to introduce to your Irish friends as well.

I use a similar recipe from my Lith. Mother-in-law and it's wonderful.   Got the best compliment today when she ate it, said "I thought my Mother came back and cooked it for me!"
My Mother-in-law just turned 100 years old on the 13th!!
I use 1 large  sweet onion chopped, and add it to the bacon when about half done.   I only let it get brown just a little, you don't want it crispy.   Then add all other ingredients with 3 t. salt or
salt blend and 2t. blk. pepper.   
I put 2 T. of butter in baking pan in the oven to melt and brown a bit (be careful it gets brown quickly) and then quickly pour the potatoes in the hot sizzling pan.   It helps with browning.   I also bake at 450* for 15 min. and then 60 min. at 350*.  Perfect every time......an oh so delicious!!!!

Wonderful recipe.  To simplify, I used defrosted pre-shredded frozen potatoes (hash brown kind).  Saves a huge amount of time!  I followed recipe exactly but did add salt and white pepper.  I make Kugelis every holiday season (I'm part Lithuanian).  This was easy and delicious. I'll be making it again, for sure.

As someone who is of Lithuanian background, and even living in Lithuania, the first question is should the bacon be cold or hot smoked?

Actually, it would be much better, and authentic, to use what is called "salt pork" in the US... hardly any "meat"in it at all.

Also, most American-Lithuanians I knew in the US use a "safety grater", which looks like a metal tennis racket to grate the potatoes... the flaky shreds add a depth that simply shredding will never accomplice. Sadly, here in Lithuania, most people who make this regularly use a machine to grind the potatoes down... this absolutely sucks, as it makes this strange, almost rubbery loaf.

Depending on how long you cook it, and how you want it too look, you can always use regular milk.

Some "traditional" recipes call for burying a pig's ear or a piece of chicken in the loaf before you cook it, but then again, what's so traditionally Lithuanian about potatoes, which didn't even show up in Lithuania until the later 17th Century?

And why call it "Kugelis", when people in Lithuania, up until the early 20th C. called it "Babka"? Thanks, Jablonskis...

Great recipe BUT as others have posted it needs some seasoning.  I added a teaspoon salt.  I also drained some water off (not all) and added 1/2 cup flour.  That is how my Lithuanian grandmother made it.  Also if you don't have evaporated milk you can use 2percent milk.  Most people would never know the difference.

I made this last christmas and didn't think it was going to go over well.  It did and I was being asked for the recipe all night.  I wish I didn't keep forgetting to drain the potatoes but comes out fine anyway.  I typically add spices like Ginger, Cumin, Celery salt and Chile pepper.  It's great to be Lituanian and not afraid to eat heart stopping foods like this.....once a year at least.

I halved this recipe used egg beaters and a 5.5 oz box of Morning Star veggie bacon and diced 6% fat ham with 1/4 C olive oil instead of butter. I grated the potatoes in my culinary mixer food processor grater. No left overs from it.

My husband is Lithuanian and got it into his head, he wanted to make this for Christmas.  Of course I made it, used the food processor to shred the potatoes.  I did cut the recipe in half, made sure to add salt and pepper.  His mother always added shredded cheddar cheese on the top

If you use regular milk I recommend to scald it first to avoid a white presence in the final product.

I have been searching for a recipe to replicate one my Mother-In-Law made some time ago, unfortunately this wasn't it. Need a stronger bacon presence, next time I would halve the potatoes, leave out the butter and reduce the milk

My bacon wasn't fatty enough so I did use the butter. I tried putting skin on chicken breasts on the top , but that didn't  work out to well.
I cheated and used my nutribullet to grind the potatoes! I like that consistency better than shredded.
It honestly tasted just like our potatoes pancakes!
Delicious!

I made this for a work luncheon last night for today and it went over awesome.  I followed the recipe mostly, but did change some things from reading the reviews.  I used 6 oz of heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk and I did not use butter.  I also squeezed the liquid out of the potatoes.  I peeled the potatoes, ran them through a food processor to shred them.  I had a big bowl with a cheese cloth draped over it and put the shredded potatoes in the cloth.  I squeezed the liquid out of the potatoes and put them back in the food processor (you may need to split in parts to fit in the food processor).  I let the liquid in the bowl set for a bit to let the starch sink to the bottom.  I then sucked the liquid out (at least most of it) and all that was left was the starch in the bottom.  I put the starch back in the potatoes and blended the shredded potatoes until they almost look like they are mashed (kind of looks like apple sauce if you use yukon gold, which I did).  I then mixed all the ingredients together and put some kosher salt in it and a lot of pepper (highly suggest pepper and lots of it because it will be bland).  This is kind of a rambling of what I did, but it was fun to make too.  Have fun.

Potatoes must be grated to get the texture of authentic kugelis - add salt and 3 or 4 eggs is plenty!

Food processor setting for grinding works great to make this the right consistency. Thanks for the recipe!
