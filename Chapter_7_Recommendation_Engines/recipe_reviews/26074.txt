All my kids favorites; pasta, chicken and peppers. I made my own fajita seasoning so I could control the salt and left out the cilantro.

It looked pretty, but I didn't care for the flavor.  I think it was the fajita seasoning, I might try it with taco seasoning.

Something was a little off in the balance between the amount of pasta and peppers and chicken.  I would make double the pasta for this one.  And be prepared for your whole house to smell like spices for at least a day or two!!

It was great, and no problem.  It was a little on the spicy side, next time I would have to use mild taco sauce!!

Delicious!  Even my chicken-hating husband liked it!  I think I'll skip the pasta and serve the mixture in tortillas, though...pasta cooked according to package directions was way too mushy for my taste.  Also will be trying it with beef fajita meat and shrimp!!

I GIVE THIS RECIPE THREE STARS BECAUSE I DIDNT THINK IT WAS TERRIBLE BUT I DIDNT THINK IT WAS GREAT. WHEN I WANT A SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO DO WITH PASTA I MAY MAKE THIS AGAIN. I ADDED FAT FREE SOUR CREAM RIGHT AT THE END BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE SAUCE WAS A LITTLE RUNNY.

Instead of using the thick and smooth taco sauce, 
I subsitute enchilada sauce.  The children love it
with the enchildada sauce.  It isn't gives it a mild flavor. 
I like it both ways.

It was fairly easy to make but next time I will cut back on the green chiles.  It was a little too spicy.

This was an instant hit at my house.  I have a 2-1/2 year old and he loved it!!  The only thing I would suggest is doubling the sauce portion.  It was very flavorful when I was cooking it, but once I poured it over the vermacelli, the flavor was diluted too much.  I also added sour cream at the table.

I'm always looking for recipes with pasta! This one is easy to prepare after a long day at work and combines familiar flavors with a Mexican twist. My son asked when we could have again for dinner!
