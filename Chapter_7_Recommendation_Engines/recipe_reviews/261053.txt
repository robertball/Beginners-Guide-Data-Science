This is wonderful! Our new favorite. I ended up using about 1.5 cups of milk because it was a little thick, and used pepper jack cheese in place of Monterey Jack. I also added quite a bit of cayenne pepper because my husband is a big fan of spicy! Very delicious!

This recipe taste GREAT!  I  have made it as is written several times.  I took off the charred skin as recommended the first couple of times and then forgot and left it on once.  Honestly great either way.

Good homemade flavor.  We used 1 1/2 cups  milk.  I did double up the smoked parika and added about 1/4 tsp cumin also .  The dip is still warm and just made it.  I think the flavors will be better tomorrow.  This would not be remarkable served right now, but I bet when flavors develop it will be something to make again.

This queso is fantastic! Only thing I changed was I used two chocolate poblano peppers and two roasted chocolate habanero peppers as that's what I had fresh from my garden. There isn't a specification on milk, so I only added enough to think it to be chip worthy. Delicious! After being refrigerated, the flavors intensified. I ended up reheating on the stove on low heat with added milk. Friends also raved - recipe sent! Thank you for this new staple!
