If you grew up in the 70's everyone had this recipe in the fridge waiting to be baked! 
I scaled the recipe to 27 servings which yielded 32 muffins with my #50 scoop, that baked in 22 minutes.
I did crush the bran flakes with my rolling pin in the bag to make them break down faster.
I changed the leavening to 4 tsps baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda since I was baking the whole batch right away.
I used white whole wheat flour for the all purpose.
I added 1 large orange juiced and zested and a scant 2 cups of chopped dates to the batter.
My batter was still quite loose so I added an additional 1/4 cup flour and 2 cups bran flakes.
They are so delicious! Great snacks for March Break and lunches, thanks!

This Recipe needs some corrections.... #1 When do you add the Bran that has soaked up the water (I added it after mixing in the flour &buttermilk) and #2. The Bran FLAKES need to be run through a Food Processor in order to be mixed into the batter until smooth... I did that knowing no amount of stirring would break down the flakes to a smooth consistency ... it worked by processing them.
