I made this without a pressure cooker, the taste is spot-on!  I used both regular raisins and golden raisins.  Also soaked my basmati overnight and reduced cook time. Thank you so much for sharing one of my favorite Afghani dishes!

I made this with my instant pot.  I did the broth on high for 20mins and finally the rice on high for 9 mins
Turned out perfect!!
