EXCELLENT! This was a HUGE hit -- there were zero leftovers.  I made the turkey exactly as stated, except I made them into smaller "patties" rather than "burgers."  They were incredibly tasty and added lots of zing to a boring old turkey burger.  I made the cucumber/lime/cumin salad and served it on the side.  Instead of pitas, I used Indian "chipatis" (or parathas), which is a yummy, flat Indian bread -- sort of like a tortilla but softer, fluffier and more tasty in my opinion -- got them frozen from the Indian grocery store and heated them up on a skillet.  Everyone was cleaning their plates and complimenting the dish.  The biggest compliment came from my brother in law, who grew up in Kenya around lots of real Indians who make real Indian food.  This recipe is a keeper.

As the recipe is written, it's delicious.  It's very forgiving if you add a little more of this or less of that.  The most recent time I made it, I used half a bag of fresh spinach chopped up, diced two cloves of garlic (didn't cook them first), and formed the meat into small meatballs.  I served it over cous cous with sumac sprinkled on top and cucumber yougurt sauce on the side.  It's my favorite meal.

What a funky burger - healthy too. Even my picky kids liked this. I didn't have chutney so I smeared the pita with hummus. We also tossed in a few pickles with the cucumbers. Great dish!

This was really good! I am Indian so I doubled the spices and added a ton of jalape√±o and this tasted just great. We didn't eat it with chutney and pita bread, but just regular buns and it was absolutely delicious.

I used pita pocket bread and hunted down the chutney, which is hard to find in my town.  The cumin/cucumber/chutney flavors are awesome together!  Will definitely make this again.

This was very good.  The spice mix was extremely subtle and blends very well with spinach, and it was no exception in this dish. And the spinach kept the turkey very moist.  I didn't spoon the turkey mixture between two pita 
halves... I just put it in the pita pocket.  After tasting, I decided to add a dollop of fat free yogurt with mint leaves.  This heightened this dish to Low-Cal-Indian-Extraordinaire!

we did not even use all of the ingredients and this recipe was amazing-we did not do the lime chutney cucumber, cloves or jalapeno and i am sure it is even better with all of those added in!

These were entirely too tasty; I'm at risk of making a habit out of them.  Hubby and I enjoyed these burgers thoroughly.  I will try to make this recipe true to the letter next time, just for kicks. Had to make a couple of modifications due to lack of ingredients:  subbed 2 Thai chilis for the jalapeno and subbed homemade habanero jelly for the chutney, adding mint and cilantro to it to approximate the flavor of mint chutney.  Oh, and I had a brain toot, thinking the recipe called for a couple of tsp plain yogurt -- must have confused it with another.  Therefore, the mixture couldn't support the entire 10 oz of spinach; it was just too wet.  Know what, though?  I think the addition of yogurt and the reduced amount of spinach worked out really well... a fortuitous mistake.  LOL  Thank you sooooooo much for sharing this recipe!  It has earned a place in my KEEPERS folder.

These were amazing. I used ground chicken instead, and a little more spinach than called for. Instead of the spices that it called for, I used some Garam Masala instead. I didn't have chutney, but thought that the cucumber topping with a little mayo added was perfect. My hubby was super skeptical when he put these on the grill, but ended up loving them too. (Oh, and we just used hamburger buns since I didn't have any pitas)

Wonderful taste combinations.  We couldn't find chutney, so used jam, and used a tortilla shell instead of pita bread. This made a delicious meal!

Really solid recipe. I was a bit worried that everything would stick together on the grill, but they did and I made small patties. Rather than the lime and cucumbers, I made a cool cucumber-tomato raita. I did use the chutney but used naan halves for buns. Fantastic!

this was an awesome blend of spices. I didnt have the clover and I doubled everything but the ginger...I used a mango-ginger chutney and Tzatziki from Trader Joes and it was perfect! Thank you for sharing this one! Its now my favorite burger.

I thought these were fantastic and a nice change from the usual turkey burger.  I didn't like the mango chutney so made tziki and that went really well.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The Indian Turkey burgers were outstanding.  The spices, garlic and spinach enhanced the normally bland turkey meat.  This is a great way to enjoy a healthy burger and get plenty of nutrition to boot.  I haven't tried the shrimp burger yet, but am anxious to do so.  I'm thinking of having them as hors d'oeuvers for a party.  Joan Gordon

I love this recipe!  I have made so many variations of it as well as sticking to the original.  My favorite so far has been with ground lamb and cardomam replacing the coriander.  It tastes best on folded flat brad (Kangaroo is my preference).  It's a lot like pita, but not so dry and definitely tastes closer to naan.  My husband hated the mango chutney, so I made my own "tzaziki" type sauce with greek yogurt, lime and cilantro that he loved with it.  I liked both sauces on it.  Definitely a winner!

This was WONDERFUL!!!  I made it with fresh spinach and ground ginger (1 tsp) and even my picky BF cleaned the plate.  I also cooked in the oven at 350 for 20mins and the burgers were perfect.  The Major Grey Chutany and the cucumber salad really set this off.  This gets a permanent place in the cooking rotation!!!

These turned out great.  Instead of buying all of the  spices separately (because I didn't have several of them on hand), I just bought Garam Masala and used 1.5 teaspoons in the burgers and the flavor was great.  I also used only 1 Tbls of ginger because I used a micro-plane and you get a LOT of ginger in one Tbsp when you do that.

Whenever I make these, I always get raves and requests for the recipe. I use those thin style buns instead of pita.

This was amazing!  I did change a couple things out of necessity but I think it would have been brilliant the right way too.  I didn't have jalapeno or coriander.  I added extra cumin instead.  I also didn't have the chutney.  I made a mango salsa with cucumbers, onions, cilantro, and lime juice.  I stuffed the burgers with the salsa rather than just topping it.  So delicious!  I will be making this again. Thanks!

the turkey burgers were awesome!  The cucumbers and chutney were the perfect finish.  We were disappointed in the pitas, ended up like a crisp cracker.  Will try using tortillas and rolling them next time

These tasted great.  But, as with my turkey meatloaf, they fell apart.  I just grilled them in a pan on the stove.  The blend of spices smelled and tasted wonderful.  We at the cucumber stuff on the side (w/o lime).  I had never used coriander - due to it being related to cilantro (which I HATE!).  But decided to try it in this dish - I will be using it again, nothing at all like cilantro.  For those who aren't sure about mincing the ginger - use a garlic press.

These are wonderful!  I love Indian cuisine and gave these a shot not quite knowing how the flavors would meld with the spinach and turkey.  The other reviewers are right, these are great!  I followed the recipe nearly exactly except I used 2 tsp of vindaloo blend (Penzy's) instead of the cumin, coriander, cloves, and cinnamon and added another 1/2 tsp salt.  The Vindaloo blend contains the same spices plus a few other yummy ones and add to the jalepeno bite a bit.  I love the cucumbers on top with the chutney and some lettuce.  The ginger flavor is super.  I put mine on an Arnold Select Multi Grain Thin instead of pita bread.  Fantastic!!

Outstanding!  Do not omit anything...the flavors are wonderful together.  I found the Major Gray's Chutney at the local Krogers (in Ketchup section).  However, there where a few Indian Mango Chutney in the international section, if Major Gray's was not available.   I sliced the cukes with my potato peeler making them  paper thin--which helped with assembling the burgers.  Served with Sweet Potato Fries.

These had a quite nice flavour but were a too dry and the texture was a bit hard and crumbly - I'll try cooking them less next time.  Served them on whole wheat bread with pineapple chutney.

Very yummy. I made 5 burgers out of the batch instead of 4 and they were just the right size for me. I was out of cloves and used dried ginger but pretty much followed the rest of the recipe. Well I used homemade mango chutney and an english cucumber too. I also stuffed everything inside the pita pocket and added a bit of baby lettuce to boot. Spicy brown mustard to the pita bread was my main change I guess.

Very good.  My 2 and 4 year olds both ate as much as I did!  We omitted the ginger, dh is not a fan of ginger, and did not have any chutney, also ate on regular hamburger buns.  Just happened to be what we had on hand, and it was really tasty.  We'll do this one again!

If you want a burger loaded with flavor you've got to try this! I didn't have frozen spinach on hand so I chopped some fresh and made my own chutney. My 2 and 8 yr olds didn't care for them, but my husband and I absolutely loved them. Thanks.

There were so many big flavor packed into these burgers that I was so surprise to find that there were completely overwhelmed by the chutney.

The clove and cinnamon was a little bit much for me (admittedly we only made the burgers and used them as such on buns), but this is a great recipe that will become a common choice for us with some minor tweaks.

This recipe was delicious! I accidentally combined the lime juice and cucumbers with the chutney. That worked just fine actually. I could probably reduce the amount of chutney. Also I made 7 smaller patties rather than four large ones.

I made these last night for my family and they're fantastic!  The add of frozen shopped spinach adds a little moisture to the generally dry ground turkey.  The flavor and small was terrific.  Major Grey's Mango Chutney and Fage 0% Greek yogurt smeared on the burger, yummy!  The whole family loved them.  I used just one (1) pound of turkey and all of the ingredients above, flavors were not subtle.

Loved this! Didn't have the coriander, so used a little extra cumin. Made cucumbers earlier in the day- turned out fantastic. Tried to find chutney and ended up with Delhi Chaat (date and tamarind)... I figured it would be as sweet as a mango chutney, and was not disappointed. Will make often!

Best turkey burger I've ever had! I pressed some fresh garlic instead of toasting the whole cloves to save some time. I also used Garam Masala paste instead of the dry ingredients because I had some around. Everything else I followed as written. Savory, spicy, sweet...delicious!

I was so excited to try these after trying the Thai Shrimp Burgers and LOVING them but these were pretty disappointing. The concept is good but the flavors didn't meld enough for me. I just wasn't crazy about it. I can't figure out why they were rated so high. I can see where they would be delicious made with lamb but the turkey was just not right for them. I think even ground chicken would have been better. I think I'll stick with the Thai Shrimp Burger and if you haven't tried those, you definitely should!

I loved, my husband said it was okay.  If I do these again, I would halve the amount of spinach.  The cucumbers on top make the burgers.

YUM! I really enjoyed this recipe. Although I made a yogurt cucumber sauce rather than using the sliced cucumbers and chutney. I had some coriander seeds that I put in my mill and ground them... what a fabulous flavor freshly ground coriander has! I had no idea! I, too, microplaned my ginger rather than mincing it. I *may* cut back on the spices next time, but I truly enjoyed this departure from my normal fare.

I can't believe how delicious this was! Every ingredient complimented each other quite well. I did not mince the ginger though; I used my microplane zester (I wasn't really sure how to go about mincing it since I'd never used fresh ginger before.) Definitely use FRESH ginger-it smells incredible!

This was absolutely fantastic. I was skeptical about using Turkey meat because I thought that it would become very dry; on the contrary! This was so delicious and moist, a real keeper. I omitted the chutney because I couldn't find it and made a mint cucumber raita to put on top of it. I also used naan bread heated on the bbq as my buns. It was the hit of the BBQ party for sure!

Delicious.  I suggest adding a bit more cumin.  I discovered that Major Grey chutney is a variety of chutney and not a brand.  Only thing I changed was smearing plain yogurt on the pita and cooking the patty on a Foreman Grill.

Really good!  A real change from traditional burgers.  The spices were a taste explosion in my mouth!  I made it with Indian Spiced potato salad.  Had to do them on the stove, but next time (when it's warmer here in PA)  I'll do them on the grill.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe to the letter, but doubled the amounts. I cooked one patty to test for seasoning and my family loved it. The next day I formed the remainder into patties to grill for a party. Still good, but some of the flavors had mellowed too much. Next time I will not prepare the mixture in advance.
Highly recommended!

Excellent. Tasty and moist, and the flavors work well together. I did think it was a wee bit too gingery, but my boyfriend didn't notice. Will also add fresh cilantro next time. Great recipe.

Major hit with my large family!  I was shocked taht the kids liked it!  I followed a reviewers advice and just made the burgers (baked and broiled in my oven) then I put them into pitas with chumus and tehina and cut up sour pickles.  It was delicious.  My husband loved it.

This recipe was really very tasty!!! You must, must, must have the chutney.

I had already chopped garlic on hand so that was my only substitution. Was great.

Definitely making again AND sending to friends and family.

Made these last night and love them.  The cucumber mixture I thought would not go over well, but my husband loved everything about the burgers.  We used flatbread instead of pitas.  I crumbled up the left over burger and made him an omelet this morning!

I did not like this recipe at all. I found it plain.

We didn't go crazy over these. Admittedly, Husband just simply prefers regular hamburgers, but I didn't like the texture of the turkey burgers in this at all. I am going to give them another try but use ground beef and ground lamb. Everything else was pretty good.
