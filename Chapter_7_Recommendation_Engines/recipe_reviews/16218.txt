Had so looked forward to making this.....  Unfortunately it was A LOT of work for little return on a meal that tasted very similar to my stew.  I had to let the "gravy" reduce down an additional 3 hours for a total of 5 hours of simmering to get the desired result and thickness.  However the flavor of the gravy was absolutely wonderful.  Probably will not make this again based on the time factor involved.

Oh, wow, was this good! Until tonight I had never had beef short ribs and I'll tell you, good old fashioned home cooking just doesn't get any better than this. A superb blend of ingredients that created the perfect dish. But when I make this again, I'll do it a day in advance and simply reheat it the next day, especially if I make this for guests. All the prep and clean-up will have been taken care of. Also, nine cups of liquid takes a long time to reduce--much longer than 2 hours. Even at 2-1/2 hours I still had to thicken it up with a bit of cornstarch. Finally, no matter how lean the ribs are, there is still a lot of rendered fat. Making these the day before will allow me to refrigerate them overnight and then remove all the solidified fat. The extra work involved and the long cooking time, however, is SO worth the effort. The ribs are full of beefy flavor and fork tender. The gravy just can't be beat--intensely rich, brown and full-flavored. I served this over polenta and it brought me right back to Grandma's house in my childhood. Mom came for dinner and she happily took what little leftovers there were home!

This was excellent!! I accidently gave this review to the wrong recipe. Oops! Well this is the one. I made this lastnight for my family and they loved it!! This is so easy even if you are not a regular cook you can do this and wow whomever you are cooking it for. We felt like we were eating at a 5 star restaraunt lastnight. I used a semi-sweet semi-dry red wine in this to have a happy medium in the sweetness level. This was the first time ever for me trying to make short ribs and I am not sorry that I did!! MM MM....good! Hats off to the creator of this meal. To thicken the sauce at the end I used a bit of cornstarch instead of flour. Was worried that it would have that raw flour taste in the background. The cornstarch was perfect. Please do try this over buttery mashed potatoes it gives it that added heaven not to mention it makes it that much more filling. Don't pass this one up try it you will not be sorry.

This recipe is amazing, my second time! My husband said I became possessed by a NY chef. I did follow another review and use top of the line meat from Gelsons so there was less fat. I didn't think the fat was an issue at all. The broth barely had any fat floating at the top. I altered the recipe for 3 servings, and added more veggies 1 hr in. I made the mistake of cutting veggies too small and they just disappeared after 2 hrs of cooking. My son who doesn't like veggies loved the carrots and even the celery! The flavors are amazing. the key is to cook until the sauce thickens (without a lid) so that there isn't "so much liquid" as other reviewers noted. You could probably 1/2 the broth portion if you were using less meat, basically have enough broth to cover over and cook the meat for 2 hrs and that should be enough.

I followed all instructions until it was time to simmer for 2 hours.  Instead I poured everything into a slow cooker for 4 hours on low. This may be too much work for some, but I enjoy my slow cooker.  Came out great.

I cooked this in the crockpot and I added a packet of dry onion soup mix to it for extra flavor.  Was excellent, everyone loved it and would make again.

My family loves this recipe!  I made it once with short ribs, but switched to making it with pre-cut stew meat.  The sauce is delicious--a cross between pot roast flavor and beef burgandy.  I chop my veggies up very small so they melt into the sauce, then I add some bigger chunks of carrots, onions, and celery to stew with the meat.  I serve it in bowls of mashed potatoes.  A huge hit every time!

BEST EVER SHORT RIBS:
I MADE THESE LAST NIGHT AND MY HUSBAND DID NOT STOP TELLING HOW GOOD DINNER WAS UNTIL BEDTIME.
WE ARE HAVING THE LEFT OVERS TONIGHT. IT IS WELL
WORTH THE TIME TO FIX THIS RECEIPE. I THICKEND THE
SAUCE JUST A BIT AFTER THE RIBS WERE READY TO SERVE. WE TOO HAD THEM OVER MASHED POTATOS ALONG
WITH A SALAD.

This was an amazing dish for the amount of effort you put into it! I added a lot more carrots and cut them into a larger chunks. I used the full amount of minced garlic called for in the recipe thou I was only serving two people with 2.5 lbs of beef short ribs. I used enough beef broth to cover the ribs while simmering, uncovered. The ribs were ready in 3 hours time. About 2 1/2 hours into the cooking, I noticed there was still a lot of beef broth, so I thickened it up with cornstarch. The beef ribs were so soft it FELL off the bone as I was trying to eat it! The beef was fork tender, juicy, and soft. The ribs were full of beefy flavor - wonderfully delicious. The gravy was so rich and tasty! I served this over rice and "green beans with hazelnuts and lemon", also from this website. I was asked to make this AGAIN. The extra work involved is worth the effort for a truly satisfying and delicious meal!

Very good. The only change I made was to add a 4 oz can of tomato paste and a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce. Then in the end I thickened it a little by mixing in 3 teaspoons of cornstarch disolved in water. It gave the sauce a slightly tomato gravy taste that went well with the mashed potatoes that I also served with it at Michele's suggestion. It all went over very well. Thanks!

Years ago I made beef short ribs for the first and last time (I thought) – way too fatty and greasy.  But recently we were at a friend’s house for dinner and she served short ribs.  I silently cringed, but they were wonderful!  So, I thought I needed to try again.  I bought boneless short ribs, as she had used, and selected this recipe.  Admittedly, I changed the process quite a bit, but still came out with a wonderfully rich tasting dish.  I browned my ribs and removed them from the skillet.  I skipped sautéing the carrots and celery and proceeded directly to sautéing the garlic for a minute and then deglazing with the red wine.  I added the stock, browned short ribs, bay leaf and thyme and cooked uncovered over a low simmer for about 90 minutes.  Because I thought my liquid was reducing too much, I covered my pan for another 30 minutes.  I wanted my vegetables to be crisp tender and maintain their color, so I continued to cook covered, adding the carrots for another 40 minutes, the celery for the last 30 minutes and the onion for the last 20 minutes.  The carrots and celery were perfect; 20 minutes for the onion was 5-10 minutes too long.  I did thicken my sauce with just a bit of cornstarch and water.  These were wonderful ribs in a deep, rich sauce with vegetables that hadn’t turned to mush.  Served over rice and we enjoyed this very much!!  Now, I’ll do short ribs again!!!

Good recipe. I did use less liquid and had to thicken the sauce with corn starch. My mom is a home EC.teacher so she taught me to improvise. I had no wine so I used cranberry juice.I minced all the veggies so my kids wouldn't complain but I could still get the good flavor. It was mouthwatering.I served with scalloped potatoes and it was yummy but the gravy on mashed potatoes has got to be the best. We had left over gravy so I froze it and threw some store bought meatballs in it to simmer for a few hours. My best meatballs EVER.

This was very tasty.  I would cook it longer next time as I prefer the meat to fall apart without a knife.  Maybe an extra hour.  Tasted great over egg noodles with garlic toast!

I made the recipe as it's stated except that after I browned the meat and cooked the carrots and onion a bit, I put everything in the slow cooker and let it cook on high for 5 hours.  I added a few tablespoons of cornstarch near the end to thicken the gravy up a bit.  The flavor of this was very good!

Very flavorful recipe for short ribs. Followed the recipe as given with only one change: used half of the beef broth (1 box/32 oz./4 cups). Simmered this covered and then uncovered the last 45 minutes or so. Sauce turned out great - didn't need to thicken it, although if you like a thick gravy you may want to do so. Served with mashed potatoes. If you are worried about too much fat, check your short ribs. The butcher hand trimmed mine, so they were OK. A grocery store might not do that, so you'll have to trim some (not all) of the fat. Perfect comfort food for a cool, fall day!!

Wow.  The flavor of these ribs and the gravy was sooo good! Even my picky 4 year old who cried when I made him taste them hummed merrily while he finished everything on his plate. I made the recipe exactly as directed but added additional carrots which I am glad of because of how delicious they were.  I used boneless short ribs and trimmed off the fat as much as possible. Not something to help you lose weight, but I didn't think my gravy turned out too greasy. I'll make this again next time I buy short ribs.

This was my first venture with short ribs and it was incredible.  The flavor is sooo good and it is perfect on top of mashed potatoes.  The perfect Sunday night dinner when you don't have much to do.  Though it takes a while, most of it is just sitting and trying to hold yourself back from attacking the pot when it really starts to simmer and the aroma fills the house.  Try to buy boneless shortribs if you can - less fat to deal with later.

Made just as directed and these are very good.  I agree it would be best to make them ahead of time so the excess fat can easily be removed.

Hubby says "KEEPER!" Tweaked it a little: 6 cups of liquid (4 cups of water with 3 beef bullion cubes, 1 can beef broth, 2 packets of Swanson Beef "Flavor Boost"), 1 envelope Lipton onion soup mix, no parsley. After 2 hours, removed beef and strained veggies from stock, reduced stock to half and added flour slurry (1/3 cup cold water and 3 Tbsp flour, shaken together) and added to boiling stock to thicken. Added veggies and beef back to pot and served over mashed potatoes.

I did not change a thing. The short ribs came out tasting a lot like my roasts do except it was just so moist! I just couldn't get over how much flavor was packed in and it was not dry at all! I really liked that. It was worth all the work. Thanks for submitting this!

Excellent! My house smells so wonderful simmering this rich flavorful broth uncovered. Cooked for 2 and 1/2 hours and beef was so tender and delicious. I used about 6 cups of broth instead of 8 and didn't have enough beef broth so used 2 cups of chicken broth. Still amazing. Served over mashed potatoes and my husband will NOT stay away from the leftovers! A new family favorite.

Very good recipe.  My entire family loved it.  My only change was that I didn't need to use as much liquid.  I ended up using about 5-6 cups of stock, along with the wine.  An added bonus:  the house smells GREAT while it cooks!

This is the first time I have made short ribs and what a great recipe.  I didn't have beef stock, so used boullion cubes.  Also used roasted garlic.  Excellent meal, even my picky husband loved it!

wow, this is great... I chopped the veges small, they melted in with the sauce. I did have to thicken the sauce. I used only 1/2 the broth. I also cooked in a slow cooker. melt in your mouth goodness.

Wonderful my family really loved it I followed the recipe but instead of using 4 lbs of ribs I used 6 since the recipe called for so much liquid. I also added 1 packet of onion soup mix for flavor.

The best short ribs we have ever had!  I did cut the stock down to 4c.,covered and  baked in the oven till tender. I then just poured the sauce over some rice (this is the way my mother in law used to do it so my husband says) and served with the ribs- my family couldn't stop raving- thanks for the recipe!!!

This is very good, the only different thing I did, was used one whole bunch of fresh thyme (tied with kitchen string) and 1 large bay leaf ( cause bay is strong to me) I used 4 bone in ribs and the rest were boneless/fatless beef ribs...turned out great, even my pickest of pickest nephew ate seconds!!! So thank you!!

Delicious and easy recipe. My family loved it and as the other reviews said, serving with mashed potatoes was great. The gravy does need to be thickened with a little cornstarch and water after meat is removed. You can reserve some of the liquid after cooking (but before thickening) and freeze it for future gravy base. It is very good. I would recommend cooking an extra hour as meat would be a little more tender. I would also put less thyme. Even decreasing by 1/3 of the thyme would be good. Make sure to trim fat before cooking as it makes it easier than trying to remove it after.

This beef was so tender, my children had no problems eating it.  It was absolutely delicious, even stone cold!  I didn't have red wine on hand, so I deglazed with extra broth.  I cut the amount of broth down, as other reviewers suggested, then thickened it with cornstarch and served it as stew the next day.  I refrigerated it overnight and then removed the solid fat from the surface.

This was very tasty, but a bit on the greasy side.  Would trim off more fat next time.  I didn't have celery, but used celery salt and added more onion.  It worked well.

Great flavor from this combo
My change is: brown ribs as is then sauté a mire paux( the celery, onion, & carrot finely chopped) add the garlic for last 5 minutes or so of this step. Add the broth and spice Etc. to crock pot and crock on low 4-5 hours or high for two whenever meat is falling off bone though not disintegrating.
Remove meat put broth in frig. Next day defat broth, put in pot on stove and cook veges (bite sized chunks) by themselves until tender and perfect. Add meat in last 10 minutes of vege cook to proper temp. Remove bay and serve
Don't forget season s&p to taste at all stages

This didn't come out well.... After doing the browning of the ribs & sauteeing the veggies, I threw everything in a crockpot. After putting in the 1 cup of wine, I could only fit in 4 cups of broth. I let it all cook on low for around 8 hours. Tried straining the broth out & making a sauce with it using a roux, on the stovetop in a small pan. We weren't thrilled with this, granted I did change it a little but who has 2 hours to sit around while dinner cooks & that is in addition to prep & clean up time. I wouldn't make this again, it was too much work for something mediocre.

Well, I wish I would have read reviews before making this. My poor husband had to eat leftovers because this was not ready in time. I will follow the advise of others and put in crockpot for the day. We have not tried this yet. I stuck it in the fridge before bed time. I will try this recipe again however.

Very good as is, although I thought there was too much liquid.  Second time around I changed it to my tastes...substituted 4 slices of bacon, chopped, for the olive oil and crisped that up before searing the short ribs (6 lbs trimmed instead of 4 lbs) in the bacon grease.  Strained the excess grease then continued with the recipe as is.  After returning short ribs to pot also added 6 potatoes, quartered; 6 carrots peeled and quartered; 6 stalks celery, peeled and quartered, to make a hearty one pot meal for 6.

Since it was a rainy, gloomy, chilly, and downright nasty day, I decided to have some "comfort food."  Short ribs are just that!  I followed this recipe pretty closely, and I have to agree with some other reviewers that this did not have enough "zip" for me, and I even added spices due to the number of folks who said that!  However, that was the only negative in this whole recipe; I used 1 cup red wine, and 1 qt beef stock, just enough to cover the short ribs.  Covered the first hour, no lid the second, the ribs were done to perfection in EXACTLY two hours, a pleasant surprise.  I thickened the broth with a roux that I had made earlier in the week, and kept in the fridge for just such a need.  Served over mashed potatoes, this tasted rich and indulgent.  I will strain the remaining broth, dilute, and add noodles for tomorrow's dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with the short ribs.  If you make it with a "better quality of meat" you will be making runny beef stew. If the fat is a big problem for you, let the dish sit overnight in the fridge and then skim the fat off the next day.  I do agree with other reviewers, there was way too much liquid.  I would only add four cups of broth, not eight. Served the dish over Trader Joe's Garlic Mashed Potatoes.   All-in-all, something I made once and enjoyed, but will probably never make again.

As others, I cut the amount of beef broth in half, and cooked this in my slow-cooker.  Very flavorful!  I don't normally like a bunch of veggies cooked with the meat, but these added to the flavor of the sauce.  It did need to be thickened at the end, though.

The sauce areoung the meat was to die for!  I did not pick the best cut of meat and this spoiled it for the family.  There was a lot of grissle and fat and it took away from the meal.  Pick a good cut of meat..and you will love it! It make a ridiculous amount of sauce though.  I cook have had half the amount and it would have still been smothered!

Made it in the slow cooker. Used half the broth. Quintessential comfort food! Served over egg noodles for casual diner with company. 
LOVE these delicious and EASY recipes!!  

I keep selling my cookbooks at garage sales, don't use them since I found Allrecipes.

I made this for my Sunday Dinner rather than grilling short ribs like I usually do. I must say I will definitely make this again! I follow the recipe to the teeth except I thicken my gravy with a little flour and water mix. I served them with black eye peas and yellow rice.My huband loved it. Will have the leftovers with mashed potatoes like the other reviewers. Try it I know you will love it too!

After having "melt in your mouth" beef short ribs at a restaurant, I thought I'd try making some for my family.  I can't fault the recipe, but I was so bummed that after all of the effort and time spent, there was not much flavor to what little meat I could get from the ribs.  (I think I bought quality meat - from a local specialty market). Mine was mostly fat or fatty meat.  The aroma coming from the stovetop was wonderful, but unfortunately, the meal was not.  I might try this same recipe with a pot roast and put in my slow cooker.

All I can say is AWESOME~I had family in from out of town when I attempted this recipe and it was a hit. Not a drop left over. This will now be my go-to recipe. I've also used a pot roast cut into big chunks and slow cooked all day, following the same ingredients. That was yummy too.

My boyfriend really liked this.  I still prefer the Korean style short ribs (sliced thin), but these were tasty and tender.  I used chicken stock instead of beef stock, and I thought the flouring and frying of the ribs was a nice touch.  Served over brown rice cooked in chicken broth.

I used cranberry juice instead of the red wine, and since I didn't have fresh parsley, I added 2 tablespoons dried parsley 30 minutes before serving.  Other then that, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out superb!  It was a wonderful meal to prepare on a chilly autumn evening, and it smelled sooooo good while it simmered away!  My husband raved on and on about it, and I completely agreed and took my bows! Certainly will be putting this recipe into rotation!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was not impressed with this.  Part of it may have been the cut of meet, but the sauce just did not have enough flavor to cover the greese of the meet cut.  This is not something I would try again.

I cut this recipe in half. I used 3 lbs country style beef ribs, 1 heaping cup of each of the vegies and added 8 oz tomato sauce as recommended by others. I also did have to thicken the sauce. It turned out like beef stew but lacked the needed vegetables at the end. I wish I had left my baby carrots whole and added more, not chopped my clery and onions so small, and added potatoes and a couple handfuls of peas and beans during the last hour. The meat was very tender and tasty. Next time I'm craving the perfect pot of stew I will use this recipe as a base.

Can NEVER have too much garlic and onions so doubled or more the amount of those.  Made some Yukon Gold garlic mashed potatoes and Dad, his friends and I LOVED the gravy!  The meat was so tender and rich;  couldn't get them out of the pot to thicken the gray without them falling right off the bone!

This was a lovely recipe. Half of the beef broth I used was unsalted as my wife has a low salt diet. And we seasoned with Kosher salt instead of normal salt. That brought the salt content way down and tolerable for her. I still had to add a bit in later for myself. I found that it was too much liquid for the amount of ribs and was fairly watery so I thickened it up with some corn starch as other reviewers suggested. The ribs were ender but not fall-off-the-bone which is how I prefer them. All in all, it was pretty good and I suspect it'll be even better after a day or two.

This is the best meal of braised short ribs I have ever made or tasted, anywhere.  I cut down the amount of beef broth so it just covered the ribs in the Dutch Oven.  I cook, covered in the oven for 2 hrs at 300 degrees.  All else the same as written.

The key to this recipe is to make sure you brown the ribs to a dark crusty surface on all sides.  This will increase the browning time a couple minutes on each side.

We didn't even need a knife.  It separated from the bones with just a fork into bite size pieces.

All I can say is double WOW!

After braising meat, then onions & vegetables all went into crock pot.  Added turmeric & tarragon to herbs.  Added chopped portabella mushrooms 30 minutes before completion.  Used Cabernet wine. Served over boiled potatoes.  Ready in 4 hours. It was wonderful

I've never had or made short ribs before. We loved it! I made it exactly as stated up to the 2 hour mark but there was a lot of sauce and no sign of thickening. The meat was beautifully tender but still on the bone (which I wanted), so I removed the meat and turned up the heat. I had it on a strong steady simmer for another hour and decided to thicken with flour. It turned out GLORIOUS! The sauce was a rich and shiny brown.... I added the meat and let it warm through. My husband was blown away.  Don't cut the broth back..... the sauce is the best part! The more the better!!! I rated 4 based on recipe as written. It does take a while and the tweaks make a huge difference but so worth it! I highly recommend trying!!!

I have never made them this way-pepper ribs totally covering-sear and seal the meat in oil in fry pan-all sides-take and put in covered pot for the oven-put one packet of knorrs onion mix  in pot and add water before adding short ribs-put another packet over the ribs and drizzle water over to wet-fill with water to just cover ribs-bone side up-ribs should be the thick ones-have butcher cut as they can leave them in long strips-cook at 320 F for 3 hours-add carrots (fresh greens on-remove greens and add) and potatoes about 1.5 hours-add other spices or veggies if desired-try it-very easy-Don

Holy cow,  I'm a short rib convert.  Michele,  thank you for this amazing recipe.  I never buy short ribs because I always thought it was a lot of money to spend on a chunk of bone and fat.  After ten years of listening to how much my guy loved his mother's short ribs, I decided to give it a try when I saw some particularly meaty ribs in the store.

**Some folks have complained about the time and mess involved with this, not so. If you have the patience to read to the bottom,  I'll explain how I only used one pot and a measuring cup to make this easy,  cutting the cleanup down to nothing. 

I halved the recipe because there are just two of us,  but that was a mistake.   I should have doubled the recipe and locked him out of the house.   Just a couple of changes...   I trimmed some of the excess fat, used vegetable stock because that's what I always have on hand and added extra garlic.   I also cooked this in the oven instead of on the stove.   After two hours in a 350 oven these ribs were unbelievable.   

I couldn't waste all of those delicious juices so I took the meat out of the pot, added a can of broth and put in some mixed baby potatoes, mushrooms and carrots.   That went back to the oven for another 30 minutes and I may have passed the time eating one tiny rib and gnawing on the bone. 

The next step was to remove the veggies and pour the broth in a grease separator before I poured it back in the pot and thickened it for gravey.  I would have posted a picture,  but tha

This only gets four stars from me, but that's because the cut of beef - short ribs - is just not for me. Too messy and too fatty.  However, the flavor of the gravy and the flavor of the beef were outstanding. So, it would have been five stars with a different cut of beef. I will definitely make again. Like some other posters, I followed this recipe exactly up until it came time to cook. Then, I just threw it in the crockpot and forgot about it for about five hours. I didn't find the prep too difficult either. Very easy to follow directions. Thanks for sharing!

The dish came out delicious! Next time I won't chop the carrots as much. I used baby carrots and I should have just cut them in half. A rough chop on the onions is good enough too. I followed the recipe exactly. At the end, I removed the beef short ribs from the pot and  I strained the remaining veggies from the liquid and set the veggies aside. I poured the liquid in my OXO Fat Separater and drew off at least a cup and a half of pure fat. I would suggest getting one if you don't want to take a lot of time trying to skim off all the fat. Most of it is hard to skim out. I tried but it was so mixed into the liquid I got out my fat separator. I was amazed how much fat I drew off. After removing the fat, I put the liquid and veggies back in the pot and added corn starch to thicken some and brought up to a healthy simmer and put the beef ribs back in the pot. I let it cook about five minutes more and then it was all done. We all really enjoyed this recipe.

This is the first time I have cooked braised short ribs. This recipe is simple and delicious! I served the ribs over mashed potatoes and the dining was lovely. Based on personal preference I left out the thyme. I did not have to struggle with my five year-old daughter to eat her ribs because she loved the flavor! Thanks for posting the recipe.

Midway through putting this together, I realized I didn't have any red wine, so I omitted it.  Still was very very good.  I also transferred to a slow cooker so it was ready when I got home today.  I served with mashed potatoes, and a gravy made from the juices from the slow cooker.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

I changed one thing: I used 5 cups of stock—4 beef, 1 chicken—and I simmered at med-low heat to reduce the liquid within the two hours allotted.

Next time, I'll do two things differently: (1) I'll cut the beef stock with an even greater ratio of chicken stock to background the unfortunate bouillon-cube flavor that I can't not notice in even the higher quality store-bought beef stocks;* and (2) I'll use 6 cups of stock, but I'll leave 3.5 hours for simmering to allow for a low-heat braising, and thus even more tender beef.

Still, I very much like this recipe.

* One of these days, I start making my own stocks.

Very good recipe.  Only made slight alterations.  Used half bone-in, half boneless short ribs, bone-in for flavor, boneless for more meat (the bone-in at my grocery store had virtually no meat).  Used fresh thyme (5-6 six sprigs, about 3 tbsp) because I had it for another recipe. Used half of the amt of broth because that is all my pan would hold.  After braising for 2 hours, put meat and broth separate in the fridge.  Next day, defatted broth, pureed vegetables in broth, cut meat off the bone, into chunks.  Heated both together and simmered for 30 minutes...with the pureed vegetables, I didn't need to thicken it.  Yummy!

This was my first try at short ribs, and they were TREMENDOUS!  Only changes I will make in the future is low sodium broth, or no salt when I first prepare the ribs.  The smell as I walked back into the house was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.

I love, love, love these. I pretty much cook exactly as stated. It's a great dinner to start cooking in the crockpot in the morning before you leave for work and then come up to a great smelling house. Yummy, perfect. Add carrots, celery, potatoes. Whatever you want.

While the meat was cooked perfectly, my family and I found the sauce very bland. My go to recipe for short ribs has always been Braised Hoisin Beer Short Ribs by Dave Lieberman. I think I am spoiled from that recipe. This wasn't for us.

Delicious short ribs! This was my first time making them and I stuck to the recipe given. Next time, I would use less liquid and also plan on them taking longer to cook than stated. I never got a thick gravy so I would change that up a little too. They came out very tender and flavorful. I made a beef and barley soup with the leftover broth. Thank you, I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing.My husband & I loved it.The only things I change were no carrots(didn't have any) and I used a store brand container of beef broth,which didn't have a rich enough flavor to suit me.I added a packet of Swanson Beef Flavor Boost to the pot and that did the trick.I cooked them a little longer than called for,till meat was falling off the bones.I thickened the gravy with a little cornstarch & water,and served with mashed potatoes & vegetable.There was gravy left,so I froze it for another meal.Will be making this again for sure.

Very good flavor, though I guess I didn't expect the vegetables to have completely disintegrated by the time it was done cooking, so the ribs didn't seem so much "smothered" as they were just in a whole lot of gravy. I cut down on the liquid even because it seemed like so much, cooked it an extra hour, and added a small bit of cornstarch with cold water, and it was a nice, thick gravy after the 3 hrs or so I cooked it down. Not sure about the reviewer who said this was way too much prep work for the result -- really didn't seem like any more work than your average home cooked comfort meal! Cooking from scratch takes love and time. :)

This is very tasty, the sauce never thickened but Im sure with a little cornstarch or flour water that could be fixed.  I cooked it for 3 hours because we like it very tender.  I omitted celery because I didnt have any on hand.  I will try this again sometime with celery.  You were right, it is very yummy on top of mashed potatoes.

I omitted the celery as I don't like it but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It didn't thicken up to a gravy texture but that's ok. I could've just added cornstarch. It tastes even better the next day!

Fabulous recipe!!  I followed the recipe reasonably closely (I rarely actually measure for dishes like this), and it came out wonderfully flavorful.  I will be using the same recipe again next week for a pot roast.  This is as good as it gets for wintertime comfort food.

Made this for a lazy Sunday dinner tonight, and am so glad I did.  It was wonderful.  I used 2 lb. boneless short ribs (just cooking for two) and let them simmer for about 2.5 hours.  Meat was so tender and the whole dish was incredibly flavorful.  I used unsalted beef broth so I could control the salt to taste.  Generously seasoned the meat prior to dredging in flour to ensure a nice crust on the meat when searing.  This was a very simple dish to make, I'll rely on it going forward for comfort meals and even for company.  I really didn't change anything other than to add some hot red pepper flakes in the olive oil when searing to give it a little heat, and also I didn't have any parsley so I left out that ingredient.  Didn't miss it.

I, too, decided to put these in the crockpot, after getting everything ready on the stove.  They cooked all day and the house smelled so good!  I spooned out some of the broth (which did not thicken) and thickened it on the stove with a cornstarch and water mixture.  I did not have canned beef broth, so used boullion cubes to make about five cups of broth.  My husband really liked it and is glad we have leftovers for another night.  I made mashed potatoes, biscuits and green beans to go with it.  Will definitely make this one again!

I mistakenly bought boneless beef short ribs from Costco (meant to buy flap meat, and was distracted by an old friend). Instead of taking it back, I made this recipe on a damp, rainy day for my hubby who works outdoors. Well....let me tell you, the compliments went on and on!! Just like some of the other reviewers, my husband could not stop telling me how delicious this dish was. I served it on a bed of garlic yukon mash, with a layer of sauteed spinach and mushrooms, topped it off with the smothered beef, and a star was born!! Like previous reviewers suggested I reduced the amount of beef stock and I used fresh thyme because I happened to have some on hand. I also pureed some of the veggies so my kids wouldn't notice and it made the gravy even more tasty!! Thanks for a keeper of a recipe!!

I have made this recipes twice and plan on making it many more times.  The flavors are fantastic and the gravy it makes is wonderful.  The meat becomes so tender.  This recipe takes an inexpensive type of meat and turns it into a delicacy.

These are wonderful. I just made them for dinner and my husband couldn't stop eating it. He said that he would serve this in his restaraunt. (He doesn't actually have one, but he always talks about the restaraunt he would love to own and what would be on his imaginary menu). He kept asking me about the recipe and what was in it because he said there's something in it that he really like. He was sopping up drippings with crusty bread. The only things I changed were adding a splash of Worchstershire (sp?) to the veggies and I didn't have celery so I omitted that. This was a winner.

For now I am going to give this a four star because it wasn't what I expected. Maybe I added too much wine, I used Cabernet sauvigon wine and it may be to powerful for this dish, because it the gravy tasted like beef burgandy. It wasn't bad once I accepted the taste. I really wanted something that was gonna be like roast beef so that I could eat it over rice. But I think I will pair this with egg noodles. But it wasnt bad, my suggestion would be to be careful with how much wine you use

After searing the ribs on all sides I transferred to the slow cooker and cooked all day per this recipe.  The ribs fell off the bone but the flavor was not pleasing to us, thyme and beef just did not marry well for our taste.

These were good.  There was definitely too much liquid in it, but I just thickened it up for the gravy.  The main thing I didn't like was the amount of thyme.  I think it was way too overpowering.  1 t. would have been enough.

I made this dish last evening - FANTASTIC!  My husband (who is an excellent cook) commented on how good and tender it was.  The wonderful aroma throughout the house made us all hungry on this stormy night.  Only used 5-cups beef broth and used cornstarch instead of flour for thickening, then served with mashed potatoes. YUMMY! I highly recommend this recipe!

This was ok. It just wasn't spectacular. I made it in a slow cooker, so I omitted one box of broth and there was still a ton of liquid. I served it over noodles. No other changes. Good, just not great and I will be looking for other short rib recipes.

This is great! I have passed this recipe out so many times. I have only made changes by accident! I have cut back a bit on the broth, the first time just because I didn't have enough. Just covering the meat works. I have put it in the oven in a roaster, covered for an hour, remove cover and cook about another hour to an hour and a half. I have gotten boneless beef short ribs from Costco and they just fall a part they get so tender. I have added quartered potatoes and they are so good. My 4 kids ask for this almost once a week!

We thought this recipe was very good.  It's wonderful comfort food on a cold dreary day.  I left out the wine, added potatoes and more carrots for a complete meal, also ditched the bay leafs,,,that is not one of our favorite herbs.  Be Creative!! Will do again. Karen

I agree with others in that you should use less broth or just plan on using a thickening agent. My family loved this dish. I removed the meat than blended the veggies to make a great gravy for the mashed potatoes.

I put these in the crockpot. They tasted like miniature individual pot roasts. They were good, but I was looking for something that has a little more zip to it.

Absolutely scrumptious! The grocery only had one carton of beef stock, so I substituted Campbells French Onion soup (made from beef stock) and that worked out okay. Used baby carrots instead of chopped, that was good too. It was fun to make and it did make the house smell heavenly. A definite keeper in my cookbook! Thanks Michele!

The flavor was great, but I only simmered them for an hour and a half, maybe they would have been a little more tender if I left them the full 2 hours.....  will try this again though...

Excellent recipe with a unique flavor! Do try this, it's a keeper.  Next time I will try beef chuck roast or maybe lamb; short ribs are just too fat.  The house smelled wonderful, and our two dogs arm wrestled my husband to get some of it!  Thank you very much, Michele.

This was a great recipe.  Very tasty and easy to make.  I scaled it down to 2 servings and added a can of diced tomatoes and only one can broth.  I might have added to much oil, so I had to thicken it up with some cornstarch, but I believe that was my own fault.  This is a great recipe and I will make it again.  Everyone loved it.

Good flavours, but as other reviewers have pointed out there is FAR too much liquid.  I used less than half and the ribs were still floating in it like soup.  Decided to cook it slowly in the oven instead of stove top.

I usually make this in the oven but tried this recipes. So seasoned and tender. The beef broth saved me making gravy with flour and hit water. I also loved the consistency of the gravy as well. A must try.

Restaurant quality recipe! Excellent flavors. What a great way to break in my new Dutch oven! I didn’t change a thing except that I took other reviewers advice and let it cook an extra hour (with the lid off) to let sauce reduce.

Easy peasy and absolutely scrumptious! Great recipe!
I added a splash of worchestershire sauce but that's the only change I made.
I've made this recipe twice already and will make it again in the future.

I really liked this recipe! I did have to make changes and the two top reviewers helped with that. I followed the recipe exactly for the stove top part. But after that I put it all in a crockpot and used 6 cups of broth instead of 8. I cooked it all day long and it was superb! I served it with mashed potatoes which was just the right thing to do with all that wonderful broth. The next couple of days I removed the solidified fat each time. It was sublime!

OH MY GOODNESS  This is one of those recipes..... so very very good  It makes you look good. This is delicious and then some. Just smelling it as it cooked made my husband - a picky meat and potatoes guy - come inside every couple  hours to check when supper was to be served. It is so easy and with  just a few ingredients - another AR case of simple is better.  Thanks for making me look so good. Supper was on time and so delicious.

Great recipe - I made it as is but added a little more flour to make the gravy thicker - tasted amazing!!!  This is my new go-to recipe for short ribs.

This is a great receipt.  I made short ribs for the first time using this receipt and they turned out great.  I substituted half a cup of grape juice and half a cup of red wine vinegar for the wine.  They are tender and very favorable.  I used the broth to make gravy.  My teenage boys loved this dinner!

Excellent!  Used Dutch oven on stove top. Diced onions and celery small. Left carrots in larger sticks. Used boneless short ribs. Could try London broil. Decreased thyme to 3/4T. Go even lighter on thyme next time. Used 2 cans Swanson beef broth And 3 cubes beef bouillon plus 2C water. 2C red wine. Simmered on stove top 4+ hours to reduce liquid and thicken. Served with egg noodles.

Believe the hype! So good! I used boneless ribs and I also only used 1 carton (32 oz) of beef stock. I didn't have thyme so I didn't add that. Used a Cabernet Sauvignon (I've never cooked with wine before) which was a good choice. I cooked it covered for  2 1/2 hours on low and the sauce reduced by about half. The carrots though! Just as much of a star as the ribs are, such great taste. Not quite fork tender but it was getting late and my whole house smelled amazing, couldn't resist. They were tender enough, no knives needed. WILL MAKE AGAIN FOR SURE!

These short ribs and the broth had wonderful flavor. I made it as directed except I didn't have any beef stock, so I just used water and I only used two cups. When the short ribs were done, I thickened the broth with flour before serving. We absolutely didn't miss the stock. The flavor was great! My husband commented on how good it was multiple times.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I used half again as much garlic.  It was GREAT!!  I prepared the short ribs with red potatoes, green beans and carrots. I served it over a bed of garlic, buttered egg noodles, with home made sourdough garlic bread and a glass of the same red wine I used in the sauce.    My husband is a happy man tonight.

So delicious!!!!  I only used 4 cups of beef stock and 1 cup of red wine. It was a lot of  liquid. After an hour of simmering I removed the lid and continued to simmer to allow some of the liquid to evaporate.

This is an awesome recipe that can be made in the slow cooker, stove top or oven. Cut the beef broth in half as the gravy never did thicken. Excellent flavour.

I made it with half boneless short ribs and half stew meat, and the short ribs were much tastier. The liquid did not reduce enough in two hours, so I couldn't make gravy out of it. Next time I'll make this on the weekend and cook it longer.

This recipe is amazing.  Hint: After browning the ribs put them in a pressure cooker with a little beef stock/broth for approx. 25-30 mins.  They will get real tender quickly.  Then put them in the prepared gravy and simmer for a while.  If the gravy need help to thicken.  Take a little butter and a little flour and mix together into a paste and add to gravy.  It will thicken right up.

Taste was good. It ended up more of a stew with large pieces of meat. Less juice and more of a gravy would have better

I followed the recipe bit it took longer than 2 hours for the meat to fall off the bone since my short ribs were different sizes. Some were big and some were small. That's just the way they were packaged. So I removed the small one and the carrots onions and celery and let the large ones cook longer. I also added cornstarch to the  sauce because mine was to thin. I will use the extra sauce with noodles and make beef stroganoff.  My boyfriend said it had amazing flavor.

This recipe was labor intensive and took longer to simmer than instructions indicated.  After using (and buying) short ribs, they are not inexpensive and are very fatty, I would find another substitute. All that being said it was a very rich and tasty recipe, however it will not be a "go to" recipe for me

UN......FREAKIN'.........BELIEVABLE!!!  Beef short ribs were on sale at Publix and I've never used them before in cooking so I searched Allrecipes.com for something useful and came across this gem of a recipe.  During the last 45 minutes of the 2 hour simmering  time, I added flour.  Doesn't get ANY simpler than that.  For those who want specifics, I removed two cups worth of the broth from the Dutch oven I was using then whisked in a cup of flour (whisking always seems to blend flour with liquids much better for me) into the two cups of broth (you can use less flour if you prefer your gravies not as thick).  Once mixed completely, I added the broth/flour mixture back to the gravy in the Dutch Oven and stirred continuously.  Adding it with 45 minutes left ensured the flavors had time to meld so there was no overly floured taste.  Other than thickening it this way, I changed NOTHING.  That thyme gave it a different piquancy than I'm accustomed to from my gravies but it WORKED......and worked WELL!!!

Good way to make Short Ribs. This recipe really makes them as tender as they can possibly be.  It is just not exciting enough for me to make it again--takes too long.

This recipe is fantastic! The only changes I made was to use cilantro instead of parsley. Even the wife loves it and it will become a regular in our household.

This dish is delicious.  I made one small change though. Instead of using thyme, I used a sprig of fresh rosemary  about 10" long and bit more (twice) garlic than was called for and used corn starch to thicken the gravy after removing the cooked ribs. I will definitely be making this again

Made this  exactly as directed. I used whole baby carrots and Cabernet Souvignon for the wine. The flavor was outrageously great. Everyone loved it. I will definitely be making it again.  Thank you for this recipe!

Everyone loved!  Served it over mashed potatoes first night and broad egg noodles when having it as left overs. Meat took 4 hours to cook on the stove top. Added veggies last 30-35 minutes, otherwise they would have been mushy. Added about 1 less cup of stock, a little more wine and flour. But basically the same recipe just tweaked for my taste.

This was a delightful recipe to make and a very tasty way to make short ribs. I have never made them before but I have seen them cooked on the cooking shows and wanted to try them myself. This was an easy recipe and considering I did not want to make a large quantity, I just cut the recipe in half. I used all the ingredients that it called for in half measures and if you follow the recipe, it will turn out delicious and the meat tender fall off the bone. I cooked the ribs for an hour or so with the lid on the pot then took the lid off to let the gravy thicken which it did in the time stated.

I did not make any changes and glad I did not. 
It was fall off the bone yummy. 
Did cut it in half for 2 people and still plenty of leftovers
I let it simmer slow for about 4 hours on stove-top  (went about my business out side the house for most of that time)  and then served over noodles. 
Added a salad and that was a very satisfying dinner for 2

Soooo yummy! All I heard for 2 hours from my husband was if it was ready yet, it made the house smell so good! even my 3year old liked it!  Added extra short ribs for left overs or so I thought. Huge hit at our house will definitely be making this again. Also thickened up some of the sauce for over mashed potatoes. Only change for next time will be to not chop my onions so fine,oops.

One of the best recipes Allrecipes has shared!!  I followed the recipe exactly but did take the advise of several reviewers and cut the beef stock to 6 cups instead of 8.  It still made quite a bit of sauce and will probably cut it again the next time I make it and  there will be a next time for sure!  Really enjoyed this meal!!!!

I used texas style beef ribs, which are the same size as short ribs except they are leaner and boneless. I also added 2 tablespoons tomato puree. The ribs were very tender and gravy was rich with an excellent consistency. Paired very well with the mashed potatoes and a 2010 Cabernet

OMG these are the best I have ever made.  I followed the recipe & it was delish.  Do use a merlot wine.  Added some cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken the sauce. Served with mashed  potatoes and green beans.  Yummy!

Delish!  I didn't add the celery or carrots (sounded too much like stew).  I  used 6 cups of beef broth instead of 8 and cooked for 3 hours until the ribs were super tender.  I served it with browned mushrooms and baby red potatoes.  The husband said it's my greatest culinary accomplishment!  Definitely worth the time and effort.

I love recipes they give me ideas.  I took this recipe and made a few changes.  Onions I thinly sliced instead of diced.  Personal preference.  I added a couple sprigs of fresh Rosemary.  I also served it over wheat pasta - I like the nutty flavor with the beef.

I give it a 4.5 rating. Close but not perfect. Bottom line, the short ribs were very tender and tasty. Some notes.
I would reduce the broth by 2 cups. You only need just enough to cover the meat. If it looks like too much liquid uncover towards the end to allow it to reduce. The only other change I would make is to add a small can of Italian stewed/chopped tomatoes to liven up the taste.
Lastly, to PHEASMONET, you probably didn't like the taste because you used beer, not in the ingredient list, instead of red wine. Not even close. Make that change and try again...I'm sure you will like it. Also, for the greasy fans, just skim before serving. You can also put the sauce in a separator...works awesomely. Bon Apetit, Chef Cosmo

I made this a week ago and it turned out great. I added mushrooms and used a sweet red wine. There is a German variation on this, where you add vinegar, flour, and sauerkraut. It is amazing and still Kosher!

I haven't made this yet, but it sounds very good. I make short ribs two other ways, so looking forward to trying this one which is different. A suggestion.....I always make mine in a pressure cooker and it really cuts down the cooking time and they just fall apart. I also would recommend reducing the sauce with some cornstarch and a little water.

MMM MMM GOOD!  Had a recipe years ago for short ribs, and we loved it.  Lost the recipe, and everything I tried wasn't quite right.  THIS IS IT.  I do add a good portion of larger pieces of carrots, because we love carrots cooked with beef.  So well worth the effort for a delicious meal.  Only problem now is the ridiculously high price of short ribs in our area.

Made the recipe as directed and it was soooooo delicious! served over white rice and it was lick the bowl good! I tend to steer away from short ribs because they can be difficult to eat but this was so fork tender it was hard not to enjoy it. The sea salt I used to season the ribs before searing was a little heavy handed on my behalf. Otherwise it was tasty balance of flavor a that didn't bore me.

FANTASTIC. Well worth the mess at beginning. Greasy splatter stove  from searing ribs. After that easy to make. I will make for company the day before and just heat up. So rich and flavoufulll.  I did not do the flouring of ribs before searing.
I floured at end to thicken, I think that's all that's necessary. I 
did 1/2. Beef broth and red wine. I think what ever combo you
have available would be fine. There is a definite  advantage to making the day before. Refrigerate for a night and you can easily remove grease from top before reheating.ILoveIt.

This was okay.  I didn't think it was that special and like the other reviewers it has too much liquid.  The next time, if I make it again, I will adjust the amount of liquid.

I followed the recipe but added a large shallot, shitake and cermine mushrooms and two cans of chopped Italian tomato's 
.  This recipe came out fabulously.  It has now been added to our families list of favorites.  I cooked this in a Dutch oven but think it would have turned out great in a crock pot.  

This is a wonderful dish that is very accepting of personal additions.  I could see adding parsnips in addition to the carrots.  The chopped tomato's disappeared into the sauce making it incredibly rich and savory.

it was very good! I am unable to use wine, so I used organic concord juice and added a tablespoon of vinegar to that. I also seasoned the flour with garlic powder and paprika. I let it simmer for 3.5 hours and added some corn starch to thicken the gravy a bit. I served over mashed potatoes and it was a hit. It served 6 adults with plenty of leftovers. it was a hit! thanks for the recipe!

Wow is right! I didn't have enough Beef Broth so I used one can of Beef Broth and one can of Progresso French Onion Soup because i had it on hand. I used all other ingredients as specified. I browned all and then used a Corelle glass Dutch oven that I lighted greased with vegetable Oil. Then I placed all ingredients in it and baked in the oven on 325 for exactly  2 hours. I turned the oven off and left it in there for 30 minutes . Took it out and the meat just fell off the bone! I placed it in another clean Corelle dish and put it in the refridge. Next morning I skimmed off fat. Last night I put it in the oven to warm up 300 degrees for 15-20 minutes. OMG was this amazing! Thanks Michelle. The sauce was so good I will use it for other recipes.  The nice thing too because I greased the baking Corelle dutch oven it was a speedy clean up! No Fuss No Muss!  Many said this was a lot of work. I thought is went quickly!

This is a great recipe!  The combination of flavors is superb.  We both loved it.  I was out of red wine so I just used a little extra stock.  It was the first time I'd cooked short ribs but we'll be having them often now that I found this recipe.

I love this recipe. I'm not comfortable in the kitchen and you would never know it after tasting this! So good. So easy. And I learned some cooking fundamentals. I always water down stock and never add more salt - otherwise I halved the recipe and cooked accordingly.

Delicious and fairly easy (although not quick so must plan ahead).  I made some changes just because of what I did/did not have on hand in the kitchen, and still turned out great.  No flour so did not dredge, but did add about 2 teaspoons cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.  Had fresh tomatoes on hand that I needed to use, so I cut into chunks and threw in.  Delicious, and skins just melted into the sauce.  Used chicken instead of beef stock.  Only used 6 cups stock and 1 cup wine, and I think the amount of liquid left at the end was perfect.  I did simmer UNCOVERED so that may have helped with the too much liquid issue others experienced.  Added a sprig of rosemary.  Did not have any celery and it was not a problem.  I added cabbage wedges the last 20 minutes just so we could have more veggies.  Left the wedges whole and them extracted them whole from the sauce and served separately on the plate from the short ribs to prevent this from being more like a beef stew.  Worked well.  I think this recipe is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of adaptations and still be very tasty.  No need to add too much salt because reducing the broth down will ensure plenty of saltiness.  Served on top of short grain white rice.  Will absolutely make again.

Loved this recipe!!! My  husband said it was one of the best things I have ever cooked. He doesn't like gravies or sauces,but this recipes changed his mind. I had never made short ribs before, I bought them by mistake, and looked up a recipe on Allrecipes and the rest is history.Wonderful blend of flavors.. a winner in our house.

I made this as my first dish in my new gifted cast iron pot. The changes I made were: 1 bottle of Cab Sauvignon, 2 1/2 cups beef broth, tied several sprigs of rosemary & thyme together, along with 2 bay leaves. Simmered on stove (broken oven) for 2 1/2 hrs. Served with garlic mashed potatoes & salad with blue cheese dressing. Excellent!

I made this recipe tonight with a couple of changes. I only used 4 cups of broth. 8 was way too much to put in a dutch oven which is what I used to cook the dinner in. I also extended the cooking time to almost 3 hours. The result was the meat was extremely tender and the meal quite tasty. It need a bit more salt and pepper but that is an easy fix and a matter for individual taste. I would make it again, it was tastier then just putting it in a crock pot as I have done in the past.

I'm giving it a 4 because if I broke it down, I'd give the ribs themselves a 3- they didn't come out as fall-off-the-bone tender as I'd have liked. But the sauce, oh the sauce, OH MY, the sauce----- freakin' AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Definitely a 5+ star sauce!

I should have read the reviews before committing the time to this. It was way too greasy. To be fair, I think I got some bad cuts of meat. I may try it again but would trim the ribs, use less olive oil and probably less stock.

Trying this recipe now, as a base for some short ribs & other ingredients that I have. I've altered it somewhat using parsnips instead of celery, added red rice & mushrooms too. Instead of thyme & bay leaves, I've used sage & a bit of curry. I did NOT use any flour at all. And oh, I added another cup of red wine. We'll see how it goes because I'm an hour away from having it for the first time! (That's why I'm not rating it 5 stars yet.)

Sure, it was fine, but there was way too much juice and veggie left over. It needed to be used, somehow. And directions to trim the meat would have been helpful.

I just made this last night for my boyfriend and he raved about it all throughout dinner and afterwards. I'll probably use this recipe again but with some modifications. First, this takes a LOT of prep time with cutting up all of the veggies and garlic. Second, the sauce didn't really thicken in the time allotted in the recipe but I fixed that by using the mixture in making a gravy, which turned out phenomenal. I'd also probably use less beef stock next time as it was just way too much liquid. I'll also try adding some dry onion soup to the mixture next time as some people suggested for just a bit more kick to the flavor. I will say that the meat turned out super juicy and tender so I was very happy about that. All in all, I'd definitely try this recipe again and make it my own!

I needed to make this recipe gluten free, so I browned the ribs without dredging them in flour.  I then didn't have any wine, so I used 1/2 cup cranberry juice.  I needed to leave the house and so needed to use the oven instead of the stovetop, so I reduced the beef stock to 2 1/2 cups and after browning the ribs and sauteing the vegetables and spices, I covered it and popped it into a low oven (325 degrees) for 2 1/2 hours - deducing the heat to 300 degrees after the first 45 minutes.

Being that I reduced the stock, I also reduced the   bay and garlic by half and reduced the thyme to about 1/2 teaspoon.  The end result was delicious.  I thought I would thicken the sauce with cornstarch (G. free) but there was no need.  

Next time I will add the carrots about an hour into the cooking time or when I reduce the oven temp.  They were a little too soft.

So, I made the recipe as written.  My kids, however, hate anything that even has the look of vegetables.  After reading the other reviews about the thickness/cooktime of this recipe, I decided to try something different.  After cooking for about 3 1/2 hours, I removed the meat and took my immersion blender and beat everything together.  This made a thicker "gravy" full of vegetables that my kids can't see.  Then I returned the meat to the gravy.  It is fabulous!!!   I told them it is going to be a mashed potato bowl like KFC!!!

This recipe was OK. The stock quantity definitely needs to be cut in half. It can also help to add some corn starch.

Delicious!  Everyone enjoyed this dish served over white rice.  The ribs and its aromatic and flavorful sauce/gravy was the perfect compliment to the simplicity of the white rice.  Like others, I thickened my gravy w/ a little cornstarch & beef broth (rather than water).  Perhaps the best part was the aroma in the house as it simmered for all those hours!

Wasn't a fan of this.  The beer was overpowering and the gravy wasn't thick at all.  The meat was tender but the overall flavor just didn't cut it.

The flavor of this dish is great, very earthy; however, I don't like this cut of meat.  Thanks.

I followed the recipe to the "T" and found it to be just yummy!!  I always find short ribs to be very fatty so I skimmed off the fat as they were cooking on the stove and that helped with the greasiness.  It left an amazing gravy after cooking for 3 hours.  Paired with mashed potatoes and rolls finished off the meal!

With just a little tweaking this became a 5 star dish. I seasoned a mixture of short ribs and stew meat little heavier to suit our personal taste, browned the meat on the stove top and transfered to a crockpot. I also used just 3 cups of broth and thickened my gravy with one cup of a flour water slurry. Served it with rice, cabbage and insalada caprese. My family raved.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I did make a few changes, I decreased the amount of stock and I since I didn't have beef stock, I used chicken. I had purchased a cut of beef I had never heard of, it was something like a country style boneless beef rib?? It was inexpensive so I assumed it was going to be a tough meat. We were all pleasantly surprised when the it came out very tender and moist.  Also, I was making this on a busy Sunday, so I followed some of the other suggestions and put everything into the slow cooker (6 hrs on high). It turned out great. I liked the fact that it was not based a can of soup or an instant soup mix. (Not that I don't make those too.) It made a really nice sauce as well.

Great recipe!  I followed others' advice increasing the simmer time to 3 hours and reducing the amount of beef broth.  Excellent over mashed potatoes!

i loved this---but i love fatty recipes. (everyone else hated the amount of fat in the meat.)---it had great aroma and was very rich. used half the liquid and still ended up with a ton of gravy (which i am saving for a base next time i need beef gravy)

Delicious!  I did not have bay leaves so I had to make do without them and I also added a bit more garlic and some crushed red peppers.  Perfect over garlic mashed potatoes!  This is a great recipe when you are having over company...for the most part, it cooks itself while you are cleaning the house!

I can't believe that I had never eaten or cooked short ribs until a few weeks ago.  I saw a recipe for short ribs Asian Style and we were blown away with it.  I decided to try making traditional short ribs and chose this recipe.  Again - another 5 star receipe.  I served it over mashed potatoes.  What a hit!  Thank you submitter.

Didn't care for this recipe. Too much fat and way to much liquid. the flavors were ok. Maybe it needs a better cut of meat.

I did use beef short ribs and I think because of the fat it made this really greasy and did not do it justice. The sauce is really delicious but I did add some cornstarch to thicken it up a little. Next time I will definetly use a better cut of meat. Otherwise very good!
