Really liked this.. it makes a TON of soup so I tossed half in the freezer.  I used greek yogurt and a bit of stock instead of milk... and turkey peppered bacon.  Really guilt free!

I'm not a review writer.  Have never written one before.  But this darned soup turned out just fine and I followed the recipe as written.  I was surprised.  It just didn't sound right, but I kept thinking it just might work.  My concern was probably due to the fact that while I like turnips I don't use them much in my cooking. 

An immersion blender have made it go faster and saved on clean up.  Also, I used one of those super fast countertop blenders and the mixture was blended completely.  No lumps.  The picture shows the soup with a little more texture than what I made.  I wonder if the little lumps would have made a more distinct turnip flavor.  I put three pounds of turnips in that soup and wouldn't have guessed "turnips" if I had been asked. 

I served it to two others and didn't correct them when they assumed that it was some different variety of potato.  They each had a second bowl and one is taking it for his lunch tomorrow.  

I learned something today.   Thanks for the recipe.
