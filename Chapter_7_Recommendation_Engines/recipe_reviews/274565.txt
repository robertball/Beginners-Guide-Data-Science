This was great!  I made this in a 3 quart baking dish.  I also used the entire 2 lb bag of tater tots and left out the 1/4 cup of olive oil.

Huge hit with the family. I only slightly modified the ingredients... a little shake here and there, and served it up in a giant cast iron pan. It was consumed before I could get the camera out. Would love to prep this one and take it along camping, heated over an open fire, and tented to toast the top tots. Great recipe. Thanks for the creation.

OMG Delicious. The tater tots turn this from regular chicken pot pie into something special. I only had about two cups of stock and no cream, so I substituted a 15 oz can of creamed corn. I used frozen peas and carrots because I was too lazy to dive fresh carrots. This warmed me up through and through on a freezing cold night and warmed my heart when husband said, “We have to start eating this all the time.” After his second serving! Yummo!

Really good, and a great meal for a crowd. Leftovers were a little soggy, but we ate every last bite!

I've made this recipe last month. I've loved the twist with the tater tots, though when I broiled them for the crust, some ended up hard to eat.  But I loved how it all came together in the end. I might make it again someday.

This will definitely become a favorite.  We will probably cut the thyme back a little though.

The only alteration I made from the original recipe was that I used the Ore-Ida Extra Crispy tater tots, it was fantastic!
