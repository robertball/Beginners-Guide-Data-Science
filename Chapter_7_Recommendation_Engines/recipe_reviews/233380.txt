This recipe is great; I'm glad I overcame my doubts about how these ingredients would go together.

This recipe is awesome, I too was concerned about the ingredients, but I loved it!  I made it as a side to salmon and it was a perfect complement.  I didn't have bacon bits on hand, but I did have bacon, so I cooked two slices of bacon (which ended up to be about 1/4 cup of bacon, then I cooked the onion in the bacon grease; it was a huge hit!  Definitely will be making this regularly.

Loved it. I used sriracha as my hot sauce and it worked great.

I usually just eat Brussels sprouts with olive oil after roasting and wanted to add some flare and possibly steam so they wouldn't take so long. I always get intrigued when a recipe calls for sour cream as I always want to use it but have no idea what it really goes with besides tacos.  This was great. And I didn't use a pound so just eyeballed spoonfuls and it was awesome.  Will make again.

We're always looking for new sprout recipes, so we decided to give this a try.  Sour cream is a staple in our house, not only for topping things but using as an added ingredient to many dishes as we are very fond of it. The flavors just did not blend well together in this dish.

This was okay, but I think I would have preferred it without the sour cream.
