So easy and so good!  I did change a few things, like using heavy cream in place of milk (3/4 c.) since I had some I needed to get rid of.  Honestly, if I was in a bind, and had neither, I thought the soup would have been fine  without any dairy or extra liquid added (based on both flavor and thickness of the soup).  Depends on your own personal tastes.  I also added an extra carrot, used an eyeballed amount of fresh grated nutmeg, skipped the sherry altogether and added 2-3 tbsp. of parsley to the soup instead of using it as a garnish.  I added it at the same time as the cauliflower.  Finally, I followed others advice and held back a bit of the veggies to add back to the puree. I was so pleased with the versatility of this recipe, that I think I will be using it for a very long time to come.

[Edit: I wrote this review in 2008 and it's now 2014. I'm still making this soup with a few other alterations. I don't bother blending or pureeing this soup at all anymore. I find that I like having a more rustic feel, with bits and chunks from using a potato masher (just mashing until I get a consistency I like). I still skip the dairy completely and I never used the sherry (you just don't really need either of those ingredients, especially the way I make it). I still add the parsley into the soup (nice handful finely chopped, no measuring needed) and also add a medium sized sweet potato (sliced thinly for faster cooking). The sweetness pairs well with the fresh grated nutmeg I use.]

This was a very satisfying and yummy soup.  Simple to make and easy to modify.  I cut back a bit on the cauliflower and added some broccoli, also added some grated sharp cheddar,parmesan and some cream cheese.  Also, very important not to puree the entire soup, leave a couple cups of the vegys whole.  Thanx Vivien.

This soup is an awesome addition to a cold winters day! I added lots of shredded cheddar before serving with french garlic bread.
I also added a few very small florets of cauliflower and simmered at the end for extra added texture. This is a keeper!

I made this for my husband who loves cauliflower and he raved about it! I added a half moon size of amish swiss cheese when the soup was done and just let it melt in. It wasn't a strong cheese flavor but really enhanced this soup! I HIGHLY recommend trying it this way!! ENJOY!

This is a fantastic soup! I pureed all but one cup of the veggies and mixed those back in at the end. I topped mine off with a little shredded Monteray Jack cheese. My 2 year old liked it a lot too. This recipe is a keeper, quick to make and very satifying.

Delicious and very gourmet soup recipe.  It takes a bit of time to cut up the vegetables but is well worth the effort.  I would not exceed the 1/8 tsp of nutmeg as it almost overpowers the natural vegetable taste.  Also, use very fine black pepper to avoid a gritty taste.  Recipe is very yummy!!

This was a delicious soup!  I'm looking forward to making it a second time for guests!  The sherry complemented the recipe and the potatoes was a great way to cut down on the fat!

We really liked this soup.  I added just a little seasoning to give it a little spice.  The sherry was a good idea also.

This recipe needed some tweaking.  There is so little fat in this recipe (which is awesome!!) that is does fall a bit short on flavor as written.  Things I did differently:  1) Roasted my cauliflower 1st with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic in a 400 degree oven, which gave it more depth...mmmm!  2) Left the skin on my potatoes, which is easier and healthy for you.  3) Added broccoli and celery that needed to be used up (and it pumped up the flavor).  4)  left some of the veggies chunky for texture, and didn't puree the entire batch, like other did.  5) Added more garlic than the recipe called for. 6) I even added thyme and a bay leaf.  7) Served with shredded cheddar on top.    After the modifications, it was yummy and satisfying.  I should mention that I had no sherry or nutmeg, which could be another reason it needed the modifications.

This soup was a huge hit.  I followed the recipe to a T.  The first time I didn't have Sherry, so I used vanilla instead.  It was perfect.  I love that there's no cream, and I used low-fat milk - this is a LOW FAT soup.    We served this soup as part of a 9 course tasting menu in a cosmo glass... and garnished with vegetable sticks and some sour cream.  The soup is also great with parmesan to garnish.  The only thing I left out was the parsley - we tried it and I don't think it's needed - and it's something my kids don't like so easy to skip it.

Great ingredients.  Nice, thick soup.  Unfortunately, there's just no incredible flavor.  Topped each of my servings with lots of shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese plus Paprika and it was pretty good.

at first I wasn't overly fond of this soup...but the more I ate it the more I liked it!  I did everything exactly as it is written except i think I used 3 carrots instead of two. I used skim milk and homemade chicken broth.  I am making it again today. And it freezes and thaws really well. I use 1pt ball canning jars and store it in the freezer.

This soup tastes good.  I did use hazelnut liqueur instead of sherry.  I also just used a potato masher instead of a blender which left the soup a bit more chunky.  When the soup was boiling at the end, I added about 1 T corn starch mixed in about 2 T cold water to the soup and let it come to a boil again.  It thickened the soup a bit.  I'll make it again.

This soup was surprisingly yummy!  I just happened to have a whole head of cauliflower and wanted  a soup recipe, so this worked great.  But the head so large, I had to double the milk (I used skim).  I also did not have chicken broth, so I used 3 bouillon cubes and doubled the spices but skipped the sherry!  I guess I really customized it, but it came out delicious anyhow!  Tastes better than it looks!  :-)

Made this last night and brought some to work today for my lunch. Yum! I let the potatoes and carrots simmer twice as long as called for (40 minutes) to make sure they were tender when I used the immersion blender. I also reserved about 1-2 cups of veggies before blending. I highly recommend eating this with big, crunchy croutons. My husband thinks it tastes more like a gravy so, why not! we plan on serving the rest of this over grilled chicken breasts for dinner tomorrow night.

This makes a delicious, low-fat but creamy soup.  I forgot to add the sherry, so I assume it's even better with the sherry added.  The addition of potatoes gives it a nice texture, although it did remind me a bit of vichysoisse (although we love vichysoisse, so that's not a problem).  I may try roasting the cauliflower next time to increase the cauliflower flavor.  We'll definitely be having this soup again!

This was very good. Only by mistake did I make a few changes...all of the vegetables sauteed fine, but in another pot I had the broth simmering and I added everything plus all spices including nutmeg.  Once all of the vegetables had simmered I let them cool overnight in the pot. (i wake up early!) After they had cooled I pureed with my immersion blender, added milk and stored in the refrigerator for the week. Very good.  Did not use parsley, had none that was fresh.

I found this to be very bland even with an extra clove of garlic. I won't be making this again but will try more sherry and nutmeg in the leftovers. Seems a lot of the people rating this so high added cheese so maybe that would make it better.

Great soup, I made it twice, I didn't add sherry because I didn't have any. The fist time followed directions and it was great. The second time I make soup I added spinach. After I blended, I split soup in half and added a a cup of evaporated milk to half. My husband likes cream soup and I like low fat. Both were great.

Another winner in my quest for good soups for someone on a pureed diet.  This tastes really good, but I'm afraid the 2 potatoes infringes a bit too much on the cauliflower flavor.  Almost tastes like potato soup.  A good potato soup, but that's not what I was looking for.  After a partial blend with the stick blender, I took out half for those that like a chunkier soup, then blended the rest until completely pureed.  BOTH were very tasty.  Next time I may try it with just 1 potato (and there will be a next time).  Cheese would work with this too.  Might even try a little swiss.

Delicious!  I left out the sherry because it was so good without it I couldn't imagine it improving it any and was afraid it would distract.  My son, who would never eat a bowl of cauliflower, carrots and potatoes, gobbled this up - great way to get those veggies in.  Thanks for a delicious and healthy recipe.

This is one of my husbands (and my) favorite soups! I don't add the sherry (because I don't have it) and I add about a cup of grated cheddar cheese at the end. Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.

This soup has great flavor!  I was a little nervous about the dry sherry but you don't taste it at all!  I only pureed about 2/3 of the mixture so it would be a little chunky which is my preference!  I did add an extra carrot and I had small potatoes so I used several which may have made it a little thicker...but again...I like it that way!  This is a definite keeper!!

This soup was marvelous. Cauliflower soup is my grandma's favorite and she practically licked her bowl. I love that there's no cream- although I did add just a touch (it was Christmas, after all). Added the carrots last and puréed them just a tad less so that there'd be a bit more color variation.

I didn't have any sherry so I left it out.  Even without it this was absolutely the best cauliflower soup I have ever made.

SO easy and delicious!  I did not make any changes to the original recipe; but the thought of adding a little cheese on top is a great idea.  The soup heats up great and tastes just as amazing the next day :-)

Made this soup as a first course for a gathering and it was awesome. Everyone there asked me for the recipe. The only thing I changed was subbing veggie stock for the chicken so it would be vegetarian friendly. Only complaint was that there wasn't enough (will have to double recipe next time). Great with a garnish of rustic croutons and parm cheese.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made a low carb version by skipping the potatoes, carrots and sherry. I then replaced cream instead of milk, added 1/2 C shredded sharp cheddar and 1 tsp of crushed red pepper - yummy!!! (had to even cut off my kids from eating the whole pot!) Thanks, Vivien!

Easy and straightforward recipe! I substituted vegetable broth to make a vegetarian version. Good taste, can be a little thick, but a little extra water or milk will help thin it to taste. If you want to go the extra mile, strain it to make it very smooth.

Selected this because of its relative simplicity.  Somewhat bland; my wife and I simply were not impressed with this, made per ingredients and directions.  I ended up with 1/2 tsp nutmeg, adding some dashes of ground red pepper and two more T dry sherry. but, even then concluded that my quest for a simple cauliflower soup will march on.

This is a good, mild flavored soup. Serve with shredded cheese on the side for those who prefer the more common cheese cauliflower soup and oyster crackers or saltines. I think the soup is at it's best with some vegetable chucks left in the puree.

The was an exceptional recipie, thank you.  I made it without Sherry or substitution, used skim milk, and left out the salt thinking there was enough in the broth.  It was filling and with the nutmeg took a dessert craving away.

Made this recipe the way it was written and used my immersion blender. Instead of using milk, I used fat free evaporated milk (1 can) and 1 tbls Marsala Wine, because that's what I had on hand. Don't love parsley, so I used 1 tblsp. of dry tarragon. It was perfect. Thanks for this recipe.

Very delicious and simple to make. I also substituted heavy cream for the milk. As tempting as it is to not bother picking up fresh parsley, the garnish really adds a nice fresh flavour to the soup.

Really LOVED this one!!  I kept some cauliflower pieces whole and added at the end for texture as other reviewers suggested.  I also added just a dash of dried oregano for a little color and flavor.  Definite keeper - thank you!!

Excellent soup! I held back a cup of the vegetables before pureeing to add back for serving, and added less salt and nutmeg.  Also, I  omitted the dry sherry (not on hand) and parsley (allergy).  I got a huge pot of soup, and a very satisfied family!  Next time, I may hold back more veggies, as hubby likes a chunkier soup.  Easily thinned by adding more milk, if necessary.  I will definitely be making this again!

Surprisingly great flavor, yet very mild at the same time. An immersion blender (boat motor) is a must! Between that and the soft texture of the potatoes and cauliflower, the soup has a great velvety texture!

I'm giving this recipe four stars primarily because I changed a lot of things, and I don't think it's fair to rate a recipe lower than that unless you stay true to it.  That said, all of my changes were either suggested in the intro to the recipe itself (adding more/different veggies), or out of necessity.  The soup we ended up with was good, not spectacular, but I thought there were some problems with the recipe itself.  The biggest one is that there didn't seem to be enough liquid.  That could be because I had a mutant head of cauliflower (I only used half, but did add a cup or so of broccoli florets and a little leftover frozen spinach), or because my idea of a "large" potato or onion is bigger than Vivien's.  Either way, I had to add an extra two cups of water, and the still veggies weren't close to covered.  Also, maybe she was using salted stock -- mine was unsalted -- but I had to add far, far more salt than 1 tsp; could have been the extra water, but I still don't think one tsp would do it for all of those veg.  The nutmeg and pepper disappeared until I added more.  All of that being said, this was a decent base recipe, and will be useful for making cream of leftover veggie soup, but I'll probably keep my eye out for another in the meantime.  Thanks, anyway!

This is a really good soup that was very easy to make.  It's just the right thickness without the addition of flour.  I did omit the sherry (as i didn't have any) and also left out the parsley but other than that, doesn't really need a thing! One little side note, i added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese at the very end, and it made it sooooo yummy!

This soup is very easy to make. Everyone loved it, my mom who is 71 and my youngest daughter, 2.5 years old. There is no need to extra salt pepper or anything. I didn't use canned chicken broth. I made about 3 1/2 cups water with 1/3 cup chicken base. Absolutely perfect.

Wonderful recipe--easy, delicious.  I like that it uses potatoes to thicken it.  My family wanted seconds, and I will definitely put this on my make-again list.

Delicious - set aside some of the veggies before pureeing, skipped the sherry, used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, and added the non-pureed veggies back in before serving.  It is a keeper!

This was so easy and so good. I did make minor changes to suit personal taste. I added celery and added extra carrots (trying to pack in the veggies) and therefore added a bit more chicken broth. I also added about a half cup of cream (just because I like it extra creamy. Not necessary. I tasted it before and it was fine.) Finally I added cayenne pepper to taste - which added an extra kick to the flavor, in my opinion.

I thought this soup had too much carrot.  It seemed odd that it was called cauliflower soup when it was orange and had such a strong carrot flavor.  Maybe my carrots were just too big.  Besides that, it was pretty good, and it was filling and nutritious.  I saved some chunks before I pureed and I liked it better chunky.  I probably won't make it again because I think I'd enjoy roasted veggies more than this soup, but maybe I'd try without the carrot if I had an occasion that called for a pureed vegetable soup like this.

Awesome soup.
I made it with chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and added some curry powder.
Mmmmmmm
Will definitely make it again.

This is really good.  The reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is that the first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly -- the onion was way too much and overpowered the soup.  I made it a second time with very little onion and thought it was delicious.

This was a great BASIC cream soup. I found that I didnt need the milk as it was already pretty thick. I also added baby spinach into the blender and when I put the soup back on the stove to simmer, added the salt and pepper along with curry, indian masala, tumeric and garlic oil I made myself. Delish!

Geez, this is good!!!Did not use sherry, did not have any, used a hand blender, and left small bits of veggies, added celery, cause I had it. You can leave the salt out, broth has enough, but do use the nutmeg. Add more or less milk depending on taste. Really great soup, next day even better.

Tried this recipe for the first time and we loved the soup.  It was easy to make but prepping the vegetables takes the most time.  I used only 3 cloves of garlic and substituted 1 cup of 18% cream for the milk.  I thought that the cream would add more flavour than the skim milk I had on hand.  The only comment is that the soup tastes more of potato than cauliflower.  But overall, this recipe is a keeper!

I did not puree, so there was sherry, nutmeg and milk.  I took a potato masher and mashed it down a little and it was delicious like that.  With the left overs, tomorrow I'll put it through the blender and add the milk.  I don't know what sherry or nutmeg is so it won't be added.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Dang this is some good soup!  I followed all the instructions with the following modifications: 7 cloves of garlic, 1 large sweet potato/yam instead of russet potatoes.  I added a yellow squash at the same time I added the potatoes and and carrots.  I used vegetable broth and cream instead of milk.   I also used himalayan pink salt, cracked pepper and cinnamon.  I only pureed about 1/2 of the vegetables and left the the other half whole.  So so so good!  Had two bowls :)  Can't wait for the flavors to marinate and have some more tomorrow!  Great Recipe!

Very flavorful and light. This recipe is a good replication of my favrotie soup at a local Italian restaurant. I used a little less nutmeg (a pinch).

I altered just a bit by adding 1 more carrot, 3 celery, a little more pepper, NO milk, NO sherry or NO nutmeg - but I did add and eye-ball of rosemary!  Yum, definitely easy and a keeper - plus a good share! Thank you

Absolutely outstanding...the best cream soup I have tried. The flavor is full, and it can be enjoyed on its own just as much as it can with cheese. I did try a few times with parsley added with the califlower as one reviewer noted, and enjoy it a bit more that way.

This soup was amazing. My boyfriend and I have each made it. He made it strictly by the recipie and it came out great. When I made it I added 1/4 cup cream cheese and a 1/4 cup shredded chedder cheese. It was really smooth and creamy. I will be making this again soon! Great way to use up some extra veggies in your fridge.

I have just made this soup.  It was very simple and tastes great.  The only difference I made was roasting the cauliflower before hand as someone else had mentioned.  I will definitely make it again.

Really good soup! I had to add more salt to make it to our taste.  You can always add salt but you just can't take it away. I told my kids it was potato soup and they ate it up. One of the kids gave it 5 stars and the other gave it 4. I told them afterward what it was. This is a great way to hide veggies that may be hard to get kids to eat.

This was very yummy untill I put the nutmeg in.  It was too strong for me.  Very good other wise.  I will just have to scale back the nutmeg a bit for my tasting.   I love the uses of cauliflower.  My favorite is alfredo sauce, use blended cauliflower instead of dairy products.  I did not add the milk cause I thought it would be just as creamy with out it.

I thought this was a great recipe! I have never made a cauliflower soup before and was surprised at how flavorful and creamy this came out. I did make a couple small changes. I omitted the carrots and used two stocks of celery instead. I also added some grated jack cheese right at the end. All in all wonderful recipe. I will make this again.

This is the best basic cauliflower soup recipe I've ever tried! I did tweak it to my taste, but it was great the first time I tried. Not, next time I'll do this instead. It also made me realize that this is the base for a Irish potato soup that one of my local taverns serves. Just use potato instead of cauli and lots more butter!

For people just learning to cook, I thought this recipe was great.  It was easy, reasonably fast, and not terribly labor intensive.  Perhaps if you're really advanced, you'll bristle, but for the rest of us, bon appetite!

Really good - I didn't even use chicken broth...just bullion cubes.

Yummy!  Even my two-year-old was scraping his bowl.  It was just that good.  We followed the recipe exactly, but we added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar at the end.

I, too, loved this soup. Didn't have sherry so I used a half bottle of flat beer (left over from another recipe). I doubled the recipe (I cook for our chiropractic patients on Monday nights) and used Better Than Bouillon instead of chicken stock. Our patients LOVED it! Definite keeper!

I used 2 sweet potatos, baby carrots, and my cauliflower was gigantic so I used twice the milk, sherry, nutmeg, etc. This was really great for a lazy Sunday night paired with a spinach salad with feta, dried cranberries, sliced almonds, and balsamic vinagrette. Delicious, easy, and will definitely make again.

Simply awesome :)  Update:  I have made this soup several times now and each time it's great.  I always use cauliflower, carrots and potatoes, plus whatever other veggies I have on-hand.  Broccoli, celery, mushrooms, sweet potato.  Delish.  And always so soo creamy!  YUM!

This was pretty good. I pureed it coarsely with an immersion blender rather than trying to get it completely smooth. I liked it. Hubby said it was a nice 'soup base' and would like to have it again with lots of variations--like curry or cheesy or whatever. So we will do this one again and maybe alter it for variety.

This was just ok.  I think that I prefer a roux-based soup rather than potatoes because I think the texture of the potatoes is not as smoothe.  Just personal taste, I guess.  This soup was also really bland.  My kids kept putting more salt and pepper into it hoping that it would be better.  My in-laws didn't ask for leftovers to take home as they usually do.  Maybe some cayenne pepper or something might perk it up.  Next time, I think I will try a roux-based cauliflower soup and see how it is.

I think this was just okay.  I didn't add the sour cream or cheese so when I warm it up for the next meal I'll add it then hopefully will like it more.  The nutmeg is a bit overwhelming.  This made a lot of soup.

While not the most appealing soup to look at, it tastes amazing! Lots of flavor. I skipped the sherry and used vegetable broth, along with adding cheese and celery to this soup and it was perfection. Will be making this again.

I made this with a gigantic farmer's market cauliflower and it turned out great.  It would be nice on a cold winter night.  I didn't have time to puree right after it cooked, so I left it in the fridge in the pot until the next evening.  Pureed well.

This soup is awesome! I've made it 3 times so far, and it was perfect every time. Sometimes I substitute the milk for heavy cream, just to add to the taste, and add a 2 teaspoons of curry. But even following the recipe it's great.

This was even better the next day!  I made a couple of minor changes and it was excellent.  I omitted the sherry (I didn't have any) and added a dash or two of crushed red pepper.

I added 4 more cloves of garlic (on account that I looooove garlic) and an extra couple of carrots. I also left out the sherry (didn't have any in stock). But this soup turned out AMAZING!! 
Thanks Vivien for sharing this recipe.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made it exactly as written and really enjoyed it.  I picked it because I was looking for something to do with a head of cauliflower and really liked that this had very little added fat. Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe;  it was really easy yet hearty. I added 1/2 lb lean ground turkey, skipped the sherry and nutmeg and added 1/2 cup extra sharp cheddar cheese. I'll definitely make this again.

Used white pepper instead of black for a spicier flavor, doubled the amount of sherry for a smoother flavor and omitted the parsley for garnish because I didn't have any!  Very good.

Absolutely amazing and simple!!
This was my second time preparing this soup...instead of diced potatoes, I had some leftover mashed potatoes from the evening before...worked out beautifully.
I also substituted broccoli for the cauliflower.  When serving I topped the soup with grated cheddar and a few dashes of cayenne pepper...Oooo La La

Great tasting recipe ~ not too thick and not too thin.......I used sweet vermouth in place of the dry sherry and I also used canned milk.   I would make this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing it.

Nice, flavorful cream soup.  I had cooked some cauliflower earlier in the week and mashed it with some garlic and fat free cream cheese, so I cooked the other veggies in the chicken broth, and the the last half hour added the mashed cauliflower with the milk, and also some grated cheese.  Served with a little crisp bacon pieces and more cheese on top.

Wonderful bellywarming fare on a chilly winter night.  The prep was easy and flavors were lovely.  I used leftover roasted carrots and potatoes, and made my own chicken stock from a roasted chicken earlier today.  When you serve the soup, try it with a small splash of heavy cream on top; this adds an incredible dimension of flavor and mouthfeel.

This is a great soup base, and I'll use it with other vegetable combinations as well.  Thanks!

I found this soup very thick. I had a huge cauliflower so I used half of it and the carrots were large maybe thats why but I had to add a lot more broth and milk than called for. The carrots make this soup a pale orange color so it does not look like cauliflower soup. The other vegetables also change the taste not exactly a cauliflower soup really more of a vegetable soup really.  I thought it was okay but nothing spectacular.  I make a lot of soups and this is not one of my best

Great soup! We all loved it, including my 2.5 year old. Personally, I would cut down on the garlic, but my husband liked it as it was. I just used water and a bit of instant vegetable soup powder instead of the broth, and marsala instead of the sherry.

WOW!  I LOVED this soup!  I used a bag of frozen cauliflower cuts and didn't even use a blender-just a potato masher in the pot.  I did end up adding about 1.5 cups water and a little more seasoning at the end as it was too thick.  I will definitely be making this again-  Thanks!

This is a good cauliflower soup and enjoyed by everyone in our household. HOWEVER, if you are looking for the pure white, creamy cauliflower soup typically served in restaurants, this is not the recipe for you.

I used a huge head of cauliflower so I add to the ingredients.  Extra carrots, extra potato, extra chicken stock.  It was a huge hit  among my family.

Great soup! I boiled the Cauliflower right in the broth before adding the whole thing to the veggies- I also mixed about 1/3 cup of sharp cheddar straight into the soup- very good twist! The ladies and I loved it!

I've made this soup several times now because I love cauliflower.  The only modification I make is to add a heaping tablespoon of curry powder because on its own, it's just a bit bland for me.  Thanks so much for this easy recipe!

This soup is really delicious! I did as others did and set some of the veggies aside, then added them to the pureed portion. We like some whole pieces in the soup for texture. I served it with garlic bread, yum!

This is a wonderful soup. The first meal I ate it as it came from the recipe. For leftovers I added 2 tsp sweet curry powder (from Penzey's). Leftover bowl 1 was garnished with sauted diced fresh mushrooms and sunflower seeds. Leftover 2 I added a few golden raisins to the soup and garnished with hemp oil and sunflower seeds (Hemp oil has a nutty flavor. Both leftovers were good. I will make this again and may tweak it again. A good base soup.

A great way to mask some cauliflower into something more edible and get rid of my CSA veggies! I didn’t have sherry so used red wine vinegar. For one of the potatoes I used turnips instead, to get rid of them. Added in some garlic scapes, too. The soup was tasty, but won’t be a knock-your-socks-off hit at a party or anything.

After sauteing the carrots, onions, celery, and potatoes, I cooked them in chicken broth.  After they became tender, I pureed them.  I cooked the cauliflower separately, then put the cauliflower in the soup.  It was very good.

I basically followed the recipe with the exception of the canned chicken broth. I always make my own. I either have it already in the fridge or in the freezer. I  added four plus cups of broth so it was not as thick.

I made a few changes to the recipe -- I omitted carrots, because I like my carrots better raw than cooked, and I did not want my cauliflower soup to come out orange!  I liked this recipe's idea of using potatoes to thicken the soup, but I had 2 servings worth (2/3 cup dry) of 4 cheese instant mashed potatoes that needed to get used up, so that went in together with the one quart of broth, in place of the 2 potatoes the recipe calls for.  I used 6 oz of 2% milk, plus 2 oz half and half, in place of the 1 cup milk -- which now that I've eaten the soup I don't think was needed; it would have been creamy enough with one cup of 2% milk and no half and half.  Instead of black pepper and nutmeg, I used the idea of tarragon, thyme and white pepper from a different cauliflower soup recipe on this site (Cream of Cauliflower soup I).  And finally, I omitted the parsley and simply topped each bowl of finished soup with a few grinds of fresh black pepper, for its color as well as flavor.  I put shredded swiss cheese into each bowl, and let the hot soup soften the cheese. Delicious!

I am vegan. I absolutely LOVE THIS SOUP AND SO DOES MY ENTIRE FAMILY! I love coming home from church on sundays and making this soup! It takes about an hour if you take your sweet time as I do and it’s delicious. I don’t use all the (vegan) butter it calls for at the beginning, I add all the veggies, veggie broth paste, a tiny bit of almond milk at the end if I feel like it’s needed, and omit the sherry and garnish. With homemade bread boy this fills the belly and is very very healthy!! (Without the animal fats) I usually have two huge bowls haha. Thanks for sharing :)

This soup was pretty good though I felt it was a little light on seasoning. It tasted better the next day once the flavors had a chance to set.

My family loved this! I kept everything almost as written, except for not using chicken broth (did not have it on hand), -I used only water and seasoned it a bit more with salt and "Treviño" seasoning which is a general seasoning made of lots of dried herbs-, used only 1/2 cup milk and omitted the dry sherry completely.  Did not have fresh parsley so I used dry parsley and turned out wonderful!  Perfect for the coming cold days, thanks for sharing!

Yum! The day turned cold, so I decided not to grill steaks and steam cauliflower. This soup was easy to prepare and perfectly delicious. I added the fresh parsley (along with a little fresh rosemary & oregano) when I added the cauliflower. Served topped with cheddar cheese and bacon bits and a side of crusty bread. Husband and I enjoyed this simple meal while watching Game 6 of the World Series. Go, Astros)

Curry powder adds some oomph. Reserve about 1-2 c veggies before blending. Before serving, sprinkle with sharp cheddar. Excellent over grilled chicken.

Really enjoyed this soup! The key is to make sure you cook the garlic onions and potatoes long enough to give it the depth of flavour it needs. I added alittle cream to this thick soup the first day and served with toasted baguette rubbed with a little more garlic. The second day I thinned it with some stock and served with grilled cheese for lunch. Yummy!

This soup was easy to make and turned out great, hubby loved it! I myself thought it needed a bit extra flavour, even though I added the nutmeg, I also added dried mustard powder. I did not have sherry or parsley to add. I used 10% cream and pureed most of it, only leaving some chopped vegetables. Makes a very large pot full.

This is a really tasty soup...comes together quickly, too.  I used one good sized head of cauliflower and together with the other veggies, it made quite a lot of soup.  I used Vegetable stock, that I had on hand - turned out great!  And good for you too!

Followed recipe, used 1% milk, as that is what we had-added more ground pepper to it and touch more salt.  Adding mix of grated cheddar and havarti with jalepnio gave nice kick to soup and helped to thicken it. Used emmersion blender to mix half of soup and added back balance of whole vegies.  Very nice flavour.  Next time I will try what one reader suggested, adding a sweet potato!

This is AMAZING! I followed it as close to the recipe as possible. I didn't have carrots or sherry, but it was still delicious! 
I have tried a few cauliflower soup recipes but lost my usual one. This has now become my hands-down favorite recipe for cauliflower soup. I just have to make sure I never lose this recipe.

Wonderful recipe !  Used margarine instead of butter, 2% milk and Mrs. Dash Salt-free original seasoning blend.  Added dry parsley with rest of seasoning. Had no sherry so just left it out.  
Great taste !   This is a keeper for sure!  Thank you!

This is definitely a base recipe and I am rating/reviewing it as such. I made some adjustments: a whole bulb of garlic (yup, that's how I roll) instead of 4 cloves, veg broth instead of chicken, and no sherry as a preference; but I think I will use it next time. I must have mammoth carrots because my soup looks really orange compared to the pictures others have uploaded. The soup has a nice texture. Overall a good versatile base on which to create your own fantastic version.

This was a quick and easy soup to make in a short time! As most I added my twist to it. Before I blended the veggies I took some pieces of cauliflower out and added them back in with some sharp cheddar cheese and a touch of cream after it was pureed. It was awesome! One of those soups that makes you feel good on a cold winters day......it's home.

The soup was great until I added the pepper. I followed the recipe exactly and the kids said it was too hot to eat. I will make it again without the pepper because I have a lot of soup to eat by myself before I can make it again.

Incredible recipe. My son had two big bowls and wants all the leftovers to himself. I was generous with the garlic (6 large cloves) and skipped the sherry and parsley. I added 2 bay leaves to the oil before adding the onions and garlic and kept everything else the same. Garnished with parmesan flakes. This is a keeper!

Freezing day here, so decided to make this soup. I was not disappointed, soup hit the spot! I decided to not purée the soup totally, leaving some of the vegetables intact. Served with a fresh baguette, yummy!! Will definitely make this  again!

Nothing special. It needed more flavor. Not sure I care for the texture either.

I love a good cream of cauliflower soup! And this recipe is fast and easy. Also very delicious!  I didn't purée it as much as they say to do, I rather having a few pieces of veggies.

This is a good, soup.  I did one cup of onion (I hat recipes that don't tell you how much).  No sherry did not feel like buying it.  I may try the sherry next time.  I used half the salt ( less salt is important to me).  Small cauliflower, and used red potatoes with skin on.  No carrots (maybe next time).  Loved it and will make it again.  I did not give it a five because I changed it.

I used a tetra pack of chicken broth and a can of evaporated milk instead of cream. It was very good.

Delicious soup and very filling. I followed the recipe almost exactly except for adding a parsnip just to use it up and I did need to add a little more chicken stock. I also tossed in a pinch of red pepper flakes for some kick. I also removed some of the veggies before blending and added them back at the end. I'm making it again today and I'll try adding some spicy sausage. Love this recipe!!

This has too much garlic, which I say even though we like garlic.  I increased the chicken broth to 4 cans instead of 2 cans, and likewise increased the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp instead of 1/8 tsp.  Even with these changes the garlic is very strong flavor.  Since I planned to puree the soup anyway, I used the food processor to do all the chopping.  This sped up the prep time and makes the puree process quicker also.  (I used an immersion blender for this.)  I will definitely make this again, cutting down on the garlic.

Pretty good basic soup. The carrots seemed to take over the colour (very orange) and I definitely feel that it needs some shredded cheese before serving. I did as another reviewer suggested and held back some of the veggies before blending and then added them back.  This was a nice tip!

This was a great hide-the-veggie recipe!  We have trouble finding ways to use cauliflower, and this soup had a very subtle cauliflower flavor, so it was just what we were looking for.

Though I made some slight revisions, I really enjoyed this soup and so did 2 out of 3 of my teenage sons! First off, I doubled the recipe {note previous mention of three teenage boys}. My youngest loves leftover soup for breakfast and I like it for lunch the next day so I always make A LOT! I made the recipe vegan by substituting Earth Balance, organic vegetable broth and non dairy milk. I left out only the dry sherry because I didn't have any and I added about 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper with the nutmeg because some reviews mentioned the soup was a little bland. I also only pureed about half the batch because we like some chunks in our soup. Even though my kids won't touch raw cauliflower with a ten foot pole they loved it in this soup! It was even better the next day and I plan to make it again, but next time I'll skip the puree step all together. Great recipe!

This is a delicious soup! Perfect for even the main course. I omitted the garlic, sherry, and nutmeg  but added shredded cheddar cheese as a topping while serving. Also I used a handful of baby carrots instead of the two large carrots. This recipe is very easy to follow or get creative!

This was great! I didn't have chicken broth, so just used water + a little salt. Didn't have carrots, so omitted them. Added more milk and seasonings than it called for plus a little sour cream at the end. Topped with parmesean. Yum!

Great recipe. I kept out at least 2 cups of steamed veg's to add in last. Also added more parsley, and a bit more mutneg for flavour. Over all, was a hit here, and will be making again.

I started to make rice for dinner and then changed my mind to soup so I just added the rice after it was all done. It tasted awesome and gave it some texture. Lots of flavor. I will definitely be making it again.

amazing! I changed a bunch of things though: added the stems of some broccoli heads, put 1/4 tsp nutmeg (not 1/8), used baby carrots instead of regular carrots, used 2 cloves fresh minced garlic, did not add salt, and instead of chicken broth I used one chicken bouillon square.  At the end I added sharp cheddar cheese to taste.  Don't worry too much about chopping  up the veggies, just throw them in and let them boil/soften.  Before I blended the soup, I took out some of the cauli florets so that they could add a bit of texture to the soup.I didn't have sherry, but I thought it still tasted very good! def'ly will make again.

Very good.  Used pkg. of frozen cauliflower as I did not have fresh available.  Instead of milk, added a bit of half and half and topped with a bit of cheese before serving.  Thanks for  a good recipe and will definitely make again.  To make it very decadent (fatteninging) - might add bacon bits next time.

So good and easy! I am vegetarian so I used 2 vegetable bullion cubes in 30 ounces of boiling water instead of the chicken broth. It turned out wonderful- light and low calorie!

Mmm! What a great recipe for a chilly night. Like most people I omitted the sherry. After pureeing the soup was slightly bland (I used low sodium vegetable broth in place of the chicken) so I ended up adding quite a bit of salt. I added hefty amounts of shredded parmesan and cheddar and used 1/2 C half and half and 1/2 C milk to make it nice and thick. Also, didn't puree all the way so we had a good texture. Great base recipe!

This soup was awesome. I added heavy cream instead of milk and cut back on the potatoes. Overall very good recipe.

Good, light and smooth soup.  Could use a perk up in flavor. Maybe a bit of grated parmesan on top or a splash of vinegar stirred in just before serving.

Very good, healthy soup.  I added about 1-1.5 cups of broccoli florets to mine as well... and as many other reviewers, I reserved about 1/3 of the veggies and added them in after the rest of the soup/vegetables were pureed. There was a lack of flavor, so I added more salt, pepper and sherry and also added 3 wedges of low-fat laughing cow cheese and melted it in... cream cheese would be good too.  I sprinkled a little fresh parmesan over the individual servings, which was a great addition... and a little goes a long way.

I roasted the vegies for more flavor(425 for 30 minutes or so  with olive oil ,salt and pepper). Like otheres used vegt broth. pureed a bunch of parsley with soup. Added 1/3 cup half and half. for vegans would be fine without any dairy.

Excellent. Only change I made was a bit more salt (1.5 teaspoon instead of 1) and after letting it simmer, I put in some pieces of cauliflower so there would be some bigger chunks.

I left out the onions and used onion powder instead.  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken to keep it vegetarian tonight.  May make again.  My two year old did spit out his candy for more bites of my soup though so that's always a plus!

I love soups and this is one I will add to my go-to list. I only used 2 cloves of garlic (I didn't want an overpowering garlic taste), and I also only used 2/3 cup of milk. Next time I may use cream instead as I felt like it could have been just a tad bit creamier. I found my emulsion blender really came in handy so that I did not have to transfer batches over to the food processor, and also like some of the previous posters mentioned, I left out a cup of the veggies so as to add a bit to the texture in the end. I topped it with monterey jack shredded cheese instead of the parsley. Very good, and will make again.

I'm not a fan of cauliflower, but it was SO cheap I couldn't resist! I went on my quest to find an alternative cooking method and found this soup recipe.  It was new and different for me, and as it turns out, a great choice. I made it following the recipe as close as possible. My changes (based on what I had availabe) were using water and better than bouillion stuff; also, 4 skinny old carrots that lurked in the bottom of the vegetable drawer, nonfat milk, about 10 tiny white potates scrubbed and skins left on, and only 1 teaspoon of sherry (I've done sherry in soup before and thought it overwhelmed it, so opted for just a HINT of it in this soup).  This soup is a very tasty use for cauliflower.  I really like it.

This recipe is simple and very tasty. I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 Half and Half (simply to use up the Half and Half) and omitted the sherry because I didn't have any. It is quite tasty. I think some shredded cheddar cheese on top will be fantastic.

it tasted good, but it kind of looked like baby food. next time i won't even puree it and just keep it as chunky potato/veggie soup. Cauliflower was expensive when I went to the store, so I used broccoli instead. Added some parm cheese on the top. Also- this made WAY more than 6 servings.

Most people probably don't actually measure out ingredients like pepper because they know how much they like...well I'm not that good at cooking yet so I measured it out and used the amount in the recipe.  Unfortunately it was WAY too much for my taste.  I was able to tone it down a bit by adding milk when reheating but even still, it was all I could taste.  I'm giving the recipe 4 stars because aside from that one little thing I know it's a great recipe that I'll make again (just less pepper of course).

Very tasty soup. I used fat free half and half instead of milk. Also, it makes all the difference to reserve some of the veggies instead of pureeing the whole thing.

Awesome and EASY!  I didn't have any sherry.  I used frozen cauliflower (2 bags) but fresh potatoes and carrots. I made the equivilent of 1.5x the recipe to serve 9.  I also added 3 slices of lite swiss cheese and used evaporated skim milk. The cheese and evap milk added protein and reduced fat and carbs.

This soup was extremely disappointing. I thought the carrots completely overpowered the flavor. I omitted the brandy. The end product was very bland despite adding cayenne, crushed red pepper and doubling up on the garlic.  Needless to say I will never make this again.

This was wonderful.   I added a stock of lemon grass while cooking and removed it before blending.  The lemongrass gave it a nice Thai-punch.  I also left some chunks of cauliflower for texture. It is going to be one of our favorites!  Thank you.

Just not for me, I'm afraid.  Cream of Cauliflower soup should be cheesy and not as thick as this turned out.  Just a matter of individual taste.

I made this soup with an Orange Cauliflower which gave it a great light orange color. The overall flavor and texture was so yummy that my husband and I fought over who got to eat the left overs. It tasted like an unhealthy cheesy soup but it's very healthy. A++

This is not bad at all, I added 4 slices of chopped bacon and cooked with the onions and garlic. This added a great smoky taste to the soup. I'd cut this recipe in half if your feeding few, as the soup is very filling.

I loved this soup. Will be making this soup often. I omitted the carrots, as I didn't have any. You gotta try this one. Thanks for the great recipe, Vivian

I wish I would have listened to the reviews about leaving some of the chunks of vegetables in the soup!! I pureed the whole thing with my immersion blender, and the texture wasn't the best in my opinion. My husband loved it, though, and I did love the flavor. I will make it again and only puree a little bit next time!

Great recipe!  The only changes I made were omitting the sherry (didnt have any), and I added 2 tsp grated fresh ginger while simmering.  When I served it, I topped it with some finely shredded swiss cheese.  It got rave reviews from my hubby and guests.

Exactly what I was looking for, had some cauliflower and carrots to use up.  I think the spices need to be adjust a bit (add more pepper), overall good healthy soup.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe. I had an usually large head of cauliflower so I had to adjust the broth and seasonings but I wouldn't make any changes.  Like the fact that it is relatively low calorie/fat. I will definitely try this with other vegetables. Thanks for the recipe.

This was easy to make and pretty tasty. I tried my new immersion blender (instead of using a normal blender)- it worked beautifully on the soup and was easier to clean up. The only bad thing about the soup was that it made the kitchen stink for two days.. Not so sure how that happened!

This soup is great and simple too. I sauteed the onion, garlic and grated carrot for a few minutes then, added the broth, cauli and 2 small diced potatoes and covered. Simmered on low as I prepared dinner. Added skim milk and a small slice of valvetta. Used my stick blender. I didn't use the sherry. Just the ingredients I mentioned plus salt and pepper. Excellent soup.

This is a delicious and simple soup. I'm usually too lazy to get out the blender, so I just mash everything in the pot with a potato masher. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a very nice soup, especially served garnished with some crumpled bacon. Perhaps because I used two huge carrots, when I pureed it with my immersion blender, it became a very strange orangey color.  The next time I make it, I will remove most of the carrot before blending, and add the chunks of carrot back in at the end. All in all, a very satisfying winter soup.

I tweaked this just a bit.  I used fat free half & half instead of milk, I threw in a couple slices of boiled ham, and I added some water as it seemed too thick without it.  It came out very tasty!

I made this with a cauliflower I grew in my garden, it is a variety called "Cheddar" It grows a light orange color. Sprinkled the top of the soup with a bit of white cheddar cheese fro contrast, right before serving. Beautiful and yummy!
