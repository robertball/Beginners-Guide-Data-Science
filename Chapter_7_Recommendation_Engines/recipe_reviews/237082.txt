You can not saute the shrimp until done and then cook the vegetables!  This leaves the shrimp way over-cooked. Remove the shrimp or better still does the aromatics and vegetables first, deglaze with some white wine, shrimp stock, chicken stock and then add the shrimp to cook for a couple of minutes.

I have made this recipe several times with the following changes.  I omit carrot and edamame (too much like peas and carrot - ugh). I follow steps 1-3 except I use only about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I then remove the shrimp.  In the same pan, I sauté the bell peppers (generally red and green) and 1/2 cup of sliced green onions, adding the halved cherry tomatoes for the last minute or so. To this mixture I add the shrimp, pasta, salt, pepper , parsley, lemon zest, and maybe another tablespoon of lemon juice. Cook until thoroughly heated and serve.  Sprinkle with the shredded Parmesan cheese.

Loved it!  Recipe revisions: Removed the shrimp after cooking and set it aside.  Added it back in with the pasta.   Used peas instead of edamame and added mushrooms.  Also added a  1/4 cup of white wine w vegetables. Used angel hair pasta instead of bow tie.  Very flavorful!!

This last minute dish came out perfect!!! I used olive oil and 2 tbsp of butter. Let it melt, minced 3 fresh garlic cloves then added raw shrimp, lemon juice and red pepper. Once the shrimp were done I added red and green pepper and onion, let it simmer on low. Then added the noodles, snap peas and broccoli. It’s DELICIOUS

We enjoyed this dish very much. I plan to make this dish once a week as the family is trying to eat healthier this year. This meal will help and was very tasty.
