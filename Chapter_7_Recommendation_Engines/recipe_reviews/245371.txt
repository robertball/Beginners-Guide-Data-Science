As with any recipe, in order to rate it, you should make it AS IS!! To rate a recipe that's been changed by the rating party (rate-ee) is, unfair to say the least. Then you are not rating the original recipe. In a way, you are rating your own recipe. What is the point of that?? There are many fabulous recipes on Allrecipes.com. This is one of them.
That being said, I made it as is. Candy of any kind, scares me. Candy thermometer, huh? Soft ball stage, What? I do NOT own a thermometer except for the human and pet kind. 
This recipe is so easy. I like it very much because it doesn't require a candy thermometer. It's also very good. This would be a great kids first time cooking recipe. I just made it and it came out perfect. It is full of minty, sweet white chocolate goodness. I did not nor will not change a thing except to double it next time. Thank you for sharing and the great recipe.

I decided to give this a try because I absolutely love Hershey's Candy Cane flavored kisses. This recipe is almost exactly like them at a much cheaper price! I am going to make more for Christmas gifts! Thanks for the recipe.

When microwaving the chips, we checked and stirred after each 30 second interval, total of 90 seconds. We did 1 & 1/2 recipe because we had that amount of ingredients. The ratio of peppermint extract was good. Didn't use the food coloring, just a lot of peppermint candy.  Great, quick recipe !
