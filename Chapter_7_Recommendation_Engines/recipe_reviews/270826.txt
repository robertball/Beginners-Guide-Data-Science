My hubby made them and I really liked them. He thought they did not have enough flavor. I loved the subtle pecan flavor and the strawberries were great. The banana was subtle. We wrapped them in wax paper and taped them. Trying to reduce use of zip locks.

Sadly, way too much sugar, but a good idea that should be modified.

Just put it in the freezer.  Licked the spoon and it was sweet.  I did not use all the sugar and if I make again I will reduce even more.  Will update when I actually eat it.
