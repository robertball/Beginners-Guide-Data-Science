You know I always look through all the reviews of any recipe I try here but have never written one, however, this cheesecake is so good I've decided to break my silence.  I found this recipe about a year ago and my friends and family honestly cannot get enough of it.  I make very few minor changes - I cut down the cream cheese from 3 packages to 2, increase the amount of gram crackers to 2 cups and add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the crust.  I use low fat everything and no one can tell the difference.  Lastly, I would also suggest baking this in a water bath, I've always done so and have never had a problem with the cheesecake cracking (though I am also very careful not to over mix).  So that's it, that's my review!  I would absolutely, positively, 100% recommend trying this recipe... you won't be disappointed

This cheesecake was amazing!  I took it to a birthday party the first time I ever baked it and it was a smash hit.  It serves 8, there were only 6 of us there and the cheesecake was all gone in less than 3 minutes.  I only added 2 packages of cream cheese and I added some vanilla.  The taste and texture were perfect and better than any restaurant I have ever had!

Thanks to this recipe, I became as the " cheesecake expert " in my little town.  Everyone DEMANDS for this cheesecake, everytime we have dinner, a potluck or a party!  It's so easy to make ( after the 2nd or 3rd time ), because you tend to get used to the steps that are necessary to make it just like a cheesecake that is bought at gourmet bakeries.  This cheesecake is extremely beautiful and it has a very smooth, wonderful texture.  I have always sworn by the water bath method though, when making cheesecakes, bc it gives it that smooth, creamy texture, without browning the top.  The best way to achieve this is put very hot water into a metal bowl, then place the spring pan carefully ( while wrapped in foil at the sides ) in the metal bowl.  I bake it at the required temperature for only 30 mins and leave it overnight in the oven, to set.  In the morning, I see the sides of the cheesecake separating from the spring pan, so it's easier and prettier to spring out.  I also learned that overbeating the cheesecake creates cracks.  DO NOT OVERBEAT!  You can avoid this by making sure that the cream cheese is at room temperature.  Also, once you put the eggs in, you can forego the electric mixer and mix by hand for a few seconds, so bubbles won't appear.  You will end up with a very smooth finish and a creamy cheesecake!

Very good recipe and it was quite easy to make!!!!  I actually omitted the butter and the sugar because I had bought 2 graham cracker pie shells and divided the recipe between the two.  I put the 1 T of water into my pot that I used to boil the strawberries (so the bottom would not burn)and it turned out GREAT!  The family enjoyed it and I am headed to the store to pick up more ingredients to do a few more for some friends.
Thank you so much!

It was beautiful! And very tasty! I made it for a gathering at home and everyone loved it! My hubby is a huge fan of cheesecake and is very picky as well and he loved it!!! My brother in law too! (He asked which bakery did I buy it from ;p) I'm so impressed. This is my 1st cheesecake and it came out so good. I followed the recipe except I cut down the cream cheese to 2 packages, added vanilla in both cheese mixture and base. Used unsweetened strawberries and added sugar myself so that I have a control of the sweetness (I don't want it to be too sweet). The lemon juice was great! I added some in the strawberry mixture and of course the cheese mixture too. I can't say enough good things about this recipe! If you're a cheesecake lover, don't miss it!!! Highly recommended ;)

This was fantastic!  It wasn't too rich, and the strawberry flavor was just right.  I made this for a Valentine's Day dessert and dropped a little sauce in circles around the edges and then ran a toothpick through them to make them look like hearts.  I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was very easy and tasted great. I didn't have time to chill for the full recommended amount of time. It was only in the fridge for about 4 hrs. and it was a tad bit soft in the middle but everyone liked it that way and it really wasn't a big deal.

This is the FIRST cheesecake I ever made and it was such a hit that in the last week, I have made four already, because people keep on asking for them!  However, I made a few changes and followed some very careful steps, so as not to have a ` faulty ` cheesecake...and the steps and tips I read on here, worked fantastically well!  a) I only put it for 140 degrees, but for a longer time of 55 minutes.  This seems to have made it perfect and not brown it on the top whatsover.  b)  I also cooked it with the water bath method and it was amazing.  No cracks, no bubbled on top and the patterns stayed on well.  c)  I added a vanilla extract, lessened the amount of lemon juice, added a bit more condensed milk and used 1 3/4 of the Philadelphia cream cheese brand.  This made a very rich, creamy cheesecake!

I used this recipe to make my first cheesecake ever and it turned out EXCELLENT! I read many reviews before attempting such a feat. Just to contribute, I followed the recipe EXACTLY, with the exception of adding about a tsp vanilla extract to the cream cheese base (before mixing in eggs), like other reviewers have done. I put a glass plate of water on the bottom shelf of the oven just to keep the heat in there moist. I had no cracking problems. I also feel like the recipe has you make a lot more sauce than you need, but that's just personal preference. By having some in the middle and on top of the cheesecake, it was sufficient strawberry taste, in my opinion. This was GREAT and I can't wait to make more, maybe changing things up with another berry flavor :)

1.  A bit too creamy for my liking - and I actually make cheesecakes a lot.  I think this has something to do with the sweetened condensed milk.

2.  The cheesecake itself lacks in strawberry flavor, though it smells great when pulling it out of the oven.  Without the extra strawberry sauce, it would be disappointing.  But the sauce shouldn't be what makes a cheesecake.  It should serve only to complement the cheesecake.  

3.  As a tip, just nuke the strawberries with the cornstarch, then blend it or food processor it.  No need to boil on the stove, saves energy and preserves more nutrients this way.  Also, you don't need sweetened strawberries.  I think it would have been sickly.

4.  Although I didn't try it, I suspect fat free sweetened condensed milk would have been just as good.  

5.  I'm not 100% convinced about the baking time.  It appeared to set fine though it was a tad more jiggly than I usually like (and I let it sit an additional hour or two after the baking time with the oven off), but usually recipes call for that amount of time at 325 degrees (50-60 mins) or 350 degrees (approx 40 mins), and those recipes don't have the added moisture from lemon juice and sweetened condensed milk.

My suggestion would be to make Chantal's New York Cheesecake and use the strawberry sauce from this recipe.  Also add more sauce to the cheesecake itself.  Ironically, I haven't made Chantal's cheesecake before, but if I try a strawberry cheesecake again, this is what I would do.

It was delicious! The only problem I found is that it tastes a little bit  like lemon pie, i guess it is because of the lemon juice next time I'll add less of it and a little bit more sugar to the crust but other than that it's realllllllllllllly good!!!

This recipe was a total hit! Instead of making one large cheesecake I made a few individual ones (by putting them in cupcake tins) and took them to work. My co-workers love cheesecake, but they all proclaimed that this was THE BEST cheesecake they've ever had.

Halfway through I ran out of strawberry glaze though, so I used some frozen mixed berries (raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry mix) and that turned out quite well also (some of my co-workers like the mixed berries better!).

This cheesecake was easy and delicious! 

Make sure you read the instructions and make it at least a day before you need it! I wish whoever wrote the recipe had put it in a numbered list instead of one long paragraph; it's hard to follow. Anyway, great easy recipe. Everyone loved it.

This was a great recipe.  The crust was amazing (although I ended up doubling the crust to hold all the cheesecake).  I usually have problems with my cheesecakes cracking, but this one didn't, and I cooked as directed.  Cook time was spot on.  The only change I made was I couldn't find sweetened strawberries, so I made it with unsweetened and added about two tablespoons of sugar.  The cheesecake was not very sweet, but I actually was glad, it was much lighter.  I also used both reduced fat cream cheese and non-fat condensed milk, and everything still came out great!

Very good!  I didn't use the sweetened strawberries, I used frozen, whole strawberries, about 10 large strawberries, added 1/3 cup sugar, and pureed in the blender.  This amount was plenty, and it seems to me that 2 (10 oz) packages of frozen strawberries would be more than what is needed for this recipe.  It has a very nice "fresh" strawberry taste, and is restaurant quality.   the finished product is visually appealing and tastes great.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made and I was so impressed with how well it turned out. I am a fanatic about cheesecake and this was as good as any I have ever had. I accidentally bought unsweetened strawberries so I added some sugar with them and it turned out great. I was sad to see the last piece go!

Perfect Cheesecake! Better than store bought. I put a dish of water in the oven on the rack below the cheesecake while cooking, which helped it to not crack. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again.

Wow, great recipe. The only changes I did were: added vanilla to the batter and added strawberries to the strawberry sauce to top the cake; I also found that 1 bad of frozen strawberries was enough for both.

This tastes OK, but it doesn't seem to have the right texture that a real cheesecake is supposed to have. It has a rubbery-like feel to it or something.

I've made both this and Chantal's cheesecake, and I prefer Chantal's over this recipe. However, the presentation is very pretty with all the strawberry swirls. As another review stated, I would make Chantal's cheesecake and use the strawberry sauce from this recipe next time.

I had baked this cake for a birthday. This is the first cheesecake I have baked. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. 

I made the following changes:
1. I used just two packages of cream cheese.
2. I used fresh strawberries. I think I used the whole standard 12 oz pack that you generally get. One could use more strawberries if they want more fruity taste.
I actually forgot to put sugar while making the strawberry sauce. It was good anyways. 
3. I followed the water bath method too. Meny reviewers have suggested that. A friend of mine who bakes very well also suggested that. There were no cracks in my cake.
4. I think I added some vanilla in the crumbs too.

Some suggestions:
Do not forget to grease the pan. I did not grease the pan so the lower layer of crumbs was stuck too the pan and it was difficult to cut the cake. Take care that the lower layer also comes out clean.

Overall, this is a very pretty and tasty cake. It is a little time consuming and one has to be careful too. Reading the reviews helped a lot! Loads of thanks to the one who uploaded the recipe !! Cheers !

My very first cheesecake and the prettiest cake I've ever baked. I only had half the strawberries and I could only find whole strawberries, unsweetened so I added 1/2 cup of sugar to the strawberry sauce and it was not overly sweet (there was still so much sauce that I had to freeze half of it). I used the water bath method, you'll find a video on this site showing you how to do this. It's quite simple and there were no cracks in my cake. I'll make this again on the next special occasion.

I loved this cheesecake. I did make a few modifications out of necessity. I made mine blueberries and I put a bit of lemon zest in as well. I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk so I mix 1 c. milk (warmed), 2/3 c. sugar, 2 tsp. cornstarch and 3 tbl. butter as a substitute. The cheesecake came out beautifully and was oh so creamy. It was wonderful. Thank you for sharing the recipe because I now have it in my file of favorites.

This is the best tasting cheesecake I've ever made! I made a few attempts using other recipes found on this website, however this recipe proved to be the best of all the ones I tried.  I only made a few modifications.  I used 2 cups  of Peak Freans cookie crumbs instead of graham cracker crumbs, and omitted the sugar (because the cookies were sweet enough), and 1/4 cup margarine instead of butter for the crust.  For a 9 inch springform pan, I reduced the cream cheese to 1 and a half (8 ounce) packages, and used low-fat cream cheese (you can't even taste the difference!). I also used 2 large eggs instead of 3 (to keep the cheesecake from tasting "egg-y", and added a bit of vanilla.  I served it after chilling overnight with the strawberry sauce as in the recipe and sliced fresh strawberries from the local Farmer's Market.  Not only does this cake look fabulous but it tastes even better! Will definitely make this recipe again!

This cheesecake was so delicious!  The only part I changed was I added some sugar (to taste) to the blended strawberries. Otherwise, it came out great!

I baked this cheesecake twice... This is a wonderful recipe! This time I cut the preparation time in half by buying an already made crust and using the nectar from the can of strawberry filling. The only reason I gave it a four star oppose to a five is because the direction says 45 minutes for cook time, but it spent over an hour in the oven. I think this happened because I used the spreadable cream cheese instead of the block. 

I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is trying to impress the dinner table with a fine dessert. WARNING:: MUST BAKE A DAY BEFORE

this was the best cheesecake I have ever made! It was so soft and creamy, it was a big hit after Easter dinner.  I boiled my berries first and then put them in a blender.  I added a bit of vanilla and an extra 1/4 cup of lemon juice to the filling.  I also used only 6 ounces of condensed milk and slightly more butter.  I would bake this again

I used a home-made shortbread base for this cheesecake, as well as a pound of fresh strawberries for the swirl, but otherwise followed directions.  Very good cheesecake, and beating the creamcheese with the condensed milk gives the mixture a surprising amount of volume...

Rave reviews from boyfriend, friends, etc. this is delicious and pretty easy to make. I am pretty sure I added more strawberry to swirl into the cake than it called for, and I used fresh strawberries and added a little bit of sugar. The fresh strawberry taste was to die for.

Totally delicious! I must have overwhipped it cuz it cracked, or else leaving it in the oven after 50 minutes with the oven off for an hour, like another reviewer said, was too much. Either way, I made hearts out of the drops and it looks as pretty as it is delicious, no one minds the cracks. The ONLY thing I would change, my crust stuck to the bottom of my springform pan, if I had even though about it I would have cut a circle of parchment paper for the bottom so this didn't happen. Next I'm going to make this a subbing raspberries for the strawberries. :D

Also, didn't use sweetened strawberries, just regular no sugar and added about a brimming 1/4 cup full of sugar to get the sweetness we like.

This was amazing! I had one pre ready graham cracker crust and I knew from experience that 3 packages was too much so I reduced to 2 ( the premade store crusts pans ARE smaller then your regular glassware at home. So you made need 3 depending on size) Since I reduced the cream cheese I did not use the whole can of milk. I approximate about 3/4 w/o measuring. Only thing I would do different is too only puree the strawberry that will be worked into the cheesecake and leave the rest with whole pieces of sweet strawberry. RAVE reviews !!

If I could I give this 6 stars.  This is the BEST recipe I have found on this site thus far.  Easy to make, hard not to eat.  I have people begging me for my cheesecake now.  Have used both frozen and fresh berries.  When using fresh, add a tbs of sugar.  Also made it with blueberries...still divine.

Really good and really easy, but when you taste it without the added strawberry sauce, the strawberry that was added to the actual cake really doesn't come through. It really needs the added sauce for the strawberry flavor. I used fresh strawberries and added a little sugar and water to the cornstarch. I overcooked mine by about 10 minutes,  because I went outside and didn't hear the timer and it still came out nice and creamy. I think the condensed milk really helps make it goof proof.

This cheesecake was a hit at the house!  I used a 16 oz can of frozen sweetened strawberries instead of the recommended 20 oz and stil had plenty left over for topping.  I also added about 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe and made a little more crust to fit the springform pan.  I baked the cheesecake a little over 50 minutes and it turned out perfect!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

My first attempt at cheesecake..ever!!  Was fantastic!!  I used fat free creme cheese and condensed milk, I thought is was just as good if not better than any full fat cheesecake.  It was a hit with my family and our friends. I will definitely make this again.

I have tried SEVERAL different cheesecakes and my husband is literally a cheesecake "conessuer" and all I can say is this exact recipe is the ABSOLUTE best one ever!! Anyone who has eaten it has gone crazy over the delisiousness of it and I'm not exaggerating! It is so highly requested by my family and friends is is famous among anyone who has tried it! I must reiterate how awesome this particular one is and it is actually quite simple when it comes to the amount of ingredients and not complicated at all to make! I've noticed one thing that's important in having it come out the very best it can and that is to make sure you get the cream cheese beaten REALLY REALLY well so it becomes very creamy, and almost fluffy.... Letting it get to room temperature before beginning is a great idea. Also I found a great optional thing to add to it is some lemon zest throughout that I add just before the eggs, & one thing I do to this recipe for my own personal taste, is I actually leave out the strawberry part because that's the only thing that I believe takes away from the best it can be!

Ok, so this was my first cheesecake, the family circled the kitchen like vultures waiting for it to be finished.  My only problem was the crust was too oily, I am not sure what went wrong, but the filling is tasty and the fruit sauce was really good.  The only thing I did different was to put it in a water bath because of fear of the dreaded cracking.  Generally, I would make again with some tweeks

This was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. It was the perfect mixture of sweet and creamy. I followed the recipe exactly. We ended up with a ton of strawberry extra sauce, so next time i will just make enough to put in the cheesecake since we didnt really need any on top.

This cheesecake was amazing. It's so rich and decadent that it makes lots of servings. It was pretty simple to make and the strawberry swirls were beatiful. This would be amazing with other sweetened fruit flavors. I give it a A++++

Easy and delicious! 
Used 2 packages of cream cheese, added 1/4 tea spoon vanilla extract to the cheese mixture (both suggested by other reviewers). It turned out great and everybody loved it!

This was an awesome and easy cheesecake recipe. The only thing I decided to use fresh strawberries and should have added some sugar to them.

This is quite possibly the best and most flexible berry cheese cake recipe ever. I have made this for birthday parties and office potlucks and it is always the first thing eaten.  I like to switch out the strawberries for blackberries when they are in season, I do add a about a quarter cup more sugar to the sauce though as blackberries tend to be a little bit more tart. I have started running my berry mix through a fine strainer to separate out all the seeds because man, blackberries and strawberries seem to be mostly seeds. I also like to mix it up when it comes to the gram cracker crust, using chocolate or cinnamon gram crackers have worked very well. Five stars only because i can't give it 10.

Rating this recipe with 5 stars while taking the suggestions to only add 2(8 oz.) pkgs of cream cheese & 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Made this for my son's 16th birthday!

Very, very good.  Made it a day ahead of time, following recipe exactly, except for the addition of a little cinnamon to the graham cracker crumbs.  I baked it in a water bath and was careful not to overmix.  There was not problem with cracking.  I did have extra strawberry sauce left over, so I think you could safely cut back to 16 oz of strawberries.

I made these in a 9x13 pan instead and cut them into bars.  WHAT A HIT!  I'm now making this by request for the third time.  I've started adding melted semisweet chocolate chips on top of the crust, under the cream cheese filling.  Adds a wonderful, luxurious, extra-indulgent dimension to this awesome dessert.  Just melt about 8 oz chocolate with a TBS or so of veg oil or butter and spread on top of crust before pouring in filling.  However, as the recipe is written it is perfect.  I have sense started cutting out some steps to save time.  I just puree berries in my blender with a bit of sugar for the sauce, no need for the cornstarch or to do all that cooking and what not.  Plus I've been leaving the sugar out of the crust as it's really not needed.  But some may prefer it.  Still, an AMAZING and fail-safe recipe that will get rave reviews from everyone who tries it!! Thanks for sharing this with the world!

I really liked this recipe. Following others' advice I only used 2 packages of cream cheese instead of 3, and it tasted great, although I guess it did make it smaller (shorter). I also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen ones (the reason I made this - I bought strawberries on sale) and I used one pound of fresh strawberries and didn't add any sugar to that. I figured that the cheesecake will be sweet enough (especially with the one less block of cream cheese). Baked in water bath, left in oven for additional hour etc. made sure it didn't crack. The four stars is because I don't find it particularly special - but definitely a solidly delicious recipe. All my friends loved it and it was gone very quickly!

Big hit at easter dinner this year!!  I read alot of the reviews for this recipe and like MANY others I cut the cream cheese down to 2 blocks instead of 3.  I also added a bit of vanilla.  Also, with the strawberry sauce that was put aside for serving, I added a bit of simple syrup to it...first to thin it out a bit and secondly to sweeten it since the frozen strawberries I used were unsweetened.  To add a little something special since it was a holiday I added a chocolate dipped strawberry to each slice....people raved about taste and appearance saying it looked like a proffessional bakery had done it.  Will DEFINATELY make again.

I was nervous to make my 1st cheesecake but this was wonderful and surprisingly simple.  I only used 2 packs of cream cheese and mixed with a wood spoon so as not to overmix.  I baked it in a water bath with foil wrapped around the pan (so no water seeped in).  After it was done baking i turned the oven off and left it in there for about 2 hours then cooled at room temp and then fridge overnight.  This came out picture perfect, no cracks and the texture was dreamy.  definitely a great recipe to try even for a novice!

Using this recipe restored confidence in my cheesecake-making abilities! Modifications: I used two ready-made crusts instead of a springform pan. Like other reviewers, I cut down the cream cheese to two packages. I substituted blueberries for strawberries and it turned out well. I also added vanilla extract.

This Cheesecake is Soooooo Good, I couldn't believe I made it.  It tastes like a high end, NY Bakery style.  I used 2 pkgs of cream cheese instead of the 3.  I doubled the recipe (I only picked up 4 bars) and omitted the Strawberries because I'm not crazy about them.  No cracks in the ones I've made.  I did take the advice of others and when it was just about done, I just turned the oven off (didn't open it) and left it there for about two hours + to cool.  I ended up letting the mixer run for a while too when the kids were acting up so I'm sure it got over beaten.  I did have everything at room temperature when I put it together.  Hope that helps!

My first cheesecake.  It tasted great but definitely wasn't the best looking thing I've ever created.  I tried not to overmix the ingredients as others said this caused cracks... but I definitely had a cracked out cheesecake.

This is only my 3rd cheesecake ever made. It was super easy and AMAZING tasting. My 14 year old son even gavd me a hug and kiss for another Piece! For those new to baking cheesecakes- this recipe is easy to follow, but make sure you bake in hot water bath (not mentioned in recipe). Cheesecake was moist and sweetness was perfectly balanced. Enjoy!

I made this cheesecake for the first time today and it turned out wonderful!!!  The only thing I would do differently is to leave the ring on overnight, I took it off too soon and it cracked.  We enjoyed every bite of it anyway!!  I will be making it again!

Just had a slice of this and I must say...BRAVO to me!  hahaha  Considering this is the very first time I made a cheesecake, this was very easy...and tastes pretty darn good!  However, the next time I make this I will change a few things: 1. Skip the lemon juice.  I prefer it less tart...but it was still GOOD! 2. Press the graham cracker crust a little more as it started to crumble after I served it on the plate. 3. Not use as much strawberry.  I didn't even need the strawberry sauce to serve with it.  What I had in the cheesecake was enough.  I also took a reviewer's advice and baked it in a water bath.  NO CRACKS AT ALL!!! BEAUTIFUL!!!!  Great recipe!

I made the 9" cheesecake and felt there was plenty of strawberry sauce so whipped up another 8" cheesecake while the first was in the oven.  I baked the 8" cheesecake for closer to an hour, maybe a little longer.  I also did a water bath.  No cracks and these taste wonderful!

This cheesecake is SO good, and it was pretty easy to make!  It is the first one I've ever made, and it came out perfect!

Although the cheesecake turned out delicious, it wouldn't have without my changing the recipe. The oven temperature was either too low, or the bake time was much too short. I ended up baking the cake for four times as long as the recipe called for. I plan to make this again to see if something went wrong the first time. Otherwise, it was a very good cake.

Fantastic, Amazing and Beautiful! I was a little intimidated but this was pretty simple. I did cheat a little and bought a pre-made graham crust but I followed the rest exactly. It really was stunning to look at and tasted better than store bought. I highly recommend this one. It was great for Turkey Day. I would give 10 stars if I could.

This was way more simple than I thought it would be...  I followed the recipe exactly, however baked it a little differently following recipes and tips from other cheesecake websites. The way I baked it was: Baked it in a water bath for closer to the 50+ minutes. Turned off oven, opened door, and let it sit for about an hour... Took it out and let it rest for a few more hours then put it in the fridge over night. There was no cracking and it was an instant hit with the fiance and her family. Already planning to bake another for Thanksgiving.

Great recipe! I used 2cups of cracker crumbs as we always like thick crusts, subbed low fat yoghurt in place with condense milk and added 1 cup of sugar. I put batter in water bath and my cake turned out wonderfully smooth without cracking. Perfect balance of sweetness from sugar with a tinge of sourness from lemon juice and strawberry! Received raves from whoever I served, my boss even volunteered to sponsor 2KG of cheese for my next cheese cake upon tasting while other co-workers fought over the last piece of cake brought, just imagine… Will make again definitely!!

This was a good recipe.  I did omit the lemon juice and instead used grated lemon zest.  Worked well.  Also, instead of the condensed milk, I used heavy whipping cream.  It made for a cheescake that was less sweet, and had a light texture.  The baking was on the money, except, my cake fell in the middle a little after it settled, but it was wonderful.  The strawberry sauce was on point.

I used 2 blocks of cream cheese as others suggested. It tasted OK, not outstanding, and there were craters along the strawberry marble. I think I may have inserted the knife too deep when creating the swirls. 20 oz is way too much strawberry for this recipe. I would recommend cutting it down to perhaps 12 or 16 oz.

This is a good strawberry swirl cheesecake, but I would reccomend using more strawberry. I actually reserved about 1c, and found that I was wanting more. The cheesecake part was good too..as with all of my cheesecakes, I did a water bath, and it came out very smooth and creamy.

This was my first time making a cheesecake from scratch as i foolishly believed that one couldn't be made without having a spring form pan!! lol well now that I have done the research and found out that this is indeed not the case I started looking for a recipe, and stumbled on this one. I'm so happy I did. This is an excellent recipe. Easy to follow and has a terrific flavor, I think I may have under mixed it a bit before adding eggs, but even so it was fantastic. The only change I would make is half the strawberry sauce next time as I have way too much, if you find that you have the same issue I suggest making smoothies lol no point wasting all the strawberry goodness!! LOL thanks so much for sharing!!

I really loved it and it was a hit with the family! It wasn't too sweet and it was completely eaten up by the end of the night. The only thing was that the crust was a little chewy. I would add either less butter or more crackers. I substituted the lemon juice with lime juice because they were cheaper and it was still awesome. Also Instead of just strawberries I used 8 oz of frozen strawberries and 12oz of Publix's frozen berries. After I boiled I put the sauce through a strainer so that it was extra smooth. Overall great recipe; now too be made at every holiday at home!

The texture of this cheese cake was not right to me.  It tasted rubbery.  As suggested by other reviewers I used low fat ingredients.  Maybe it was that  but this is not one of my familys favorites.

My hubby and I didn't care for this cheesecake. We won't make it again. We didn't like the canned milk flavor. We prefer the recipe for Basic Cheesecake, on this site, that uses heavy cream and sour cream (I used light Daisy sour cream.) Sorry, Luverene.

To lighten a great recipe, use 16 oz. Skim ricotta and 8oz. lite or fat free cream cheese.  Also use one egg and two egg whites. This healthier version should rate five stars.

It tasted alright but it tasted too much like philadelphia cheese. My husband thought it was too thick or dense. I used the water bath method so i wouldnt get any cracks. It worked but the curst did not cook at all. It was just like the way it was when I made the crust. Next time ill add more graham crackers and less butter. Ill also use 2 pkgs of cream cheese instead of 3 as well.

My 12 yr old requested a "real" (as in not instant lol)strawberry cheesecake for his birthday instead of a traditional cake. After searching through different recipes we decided on this one. So, glad we did. It was easier than I thought it would be and DELICIOUS! I'll definitely be making more of these.  :D

This is the first time I have made this cheesecake  I took this to my friends for a dinner, they are caters. I got rave reviews from everybody. I followed other people suggestions. I only used two big eggs to avoid an eggy flavour. I also did the water bath method others had suggested and only cooked for 30 minutes and then turned the oven off. I left the cheese cake in until the morning. The sides came away. Perfecto!
I am in New Zealand and used Malt biscuits crushed 2 cups and a little more butter to make it bind.
I also used  a peach and passionfruit (drained seeds) puree YUM! The slight crack was when I was transfering the cheesecake to the plate. User error. This is definately on my to do list again. If you want to impress do this.

Awesome! Next time I make this, I will put more strawberry puree into the cake and save a little less for the topping. I like to have a little taste of strawberry in every bite.

This is indeed one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made, and I've made a lot of them.  I rarely use graham cracker crust and didn't on this either.  I like to use Vanilla Wafers and sliced almonds for my cheesecake crust (depending on the flavor).  I also used fresh strawberries to make the sauce and omitted the condensed milk...I think that would have been too sweet.  However, I melted some white chocolate and poured that in the batter.  I baked in a water bath and got no cracking at all.  It came out beautifully and my friends were in heaven!!!  I made chocolate covered strawberries for decoration and wow!!!  i will surely make this one again.

The cheesecake is wonderful, but you definitely do not need to make extra sauce for serving with the cheesecake.  It's fine all on it's own.   For that reason, 1 container of strawberries is more than enough. When I make again, I will only prepare enough sauce for the 1/3 of a cup needed for the cheesecake itself.   The cheesecake does not need any more sauce than that.

This will be my go-to cheesecake recipe!  I made it in a heart-shape for valentines day, and my husband said it was the best cheesecake he's ever had (and he's had a lot of cheesecakes)

I did make some changes as recommended by other reviewers -- cinnamon in the crust (a must), vanilla with the cream cheese, a little less lemon juice (I couldn't taste it at all), and 2 packs instead of 3 of cream cheese.  I microwaved the cream cheese a bit before beating it so I wouldn't need to overbeat it (I had no issues with cracking)
The only thing was when I beat all of the ingredients together, it was SUPER runny, which concerned me.  I cooked for 45 minutes but it wasn't even close to being done, so I keep cooking it longer and checking.  I think I ended up cooking it for an additional 35-40 minutes (and I turned up the temp to 330F)
I tested it by inserting a toothpick and when it was still a little sticky in the centre (and the sides were puffing up and pulling away from the sides of pan), I stopped cooking (but still wasn't sure if it would turn out).

It did turn out, fantastically.  The perfect density, not too rich, full of flavour. The key is letting it cool in the fridge.
I prefer it without the extra strawberry sauce, but that part is tasty (would be delicious on vanilla ice cream!)

Made this as a special treat as my husband had a craving for cheesecake. It turned out fantastic. I made changes as recommended by other reviewers: 2 tsp of cinnamon to the base, used digestive biscuits since I'm in Australia and can't get graham crackers, added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cheesecake filling, 2 packages of cream cheese instead of 3, used frozen raspberries instead of strawberries and added 2 Tbs of sugar, a tad less lemon juice than the recipe (juice of 1 small lemon), 140 degrees for 55 minutes in a water bath.

No cracks with a slight golden brown hue. Tasted amazing after being refrigerated for a few hours and served with the raspberry sauce. Yum!

This recipe got rave reviews at my New Year's party. I made the recipe just how it was written except I had unsweetened frozen strawberries and add 2TBSP sugar to them.  You need a little time to make it due to the chilling time, but well worth planning ahead.

the strawberry sauce ruined the consistency of the cheesecake. :( The end result was wet and soft, not the firm texture you expect from cheesecake. Followed the recipe exactly, very disappointed.

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made.  Living in EU I had no access to graham crackers so I used Digestive biscuits.  I also did not have access to strawberries.  I made the rest exactly as written.  I used cherry thick syrup.  I had an 8inch pan.  It was a delicious cheesecake.  I did have a bit cracking but when I added the syrup on top you could not see it.  I will be making it again.  Mine was a really high cheesecake due to the smaller pan.  Next time I will double the crust.  I am making it for my Christmas party.  I will try it with a water bath.  Make this cheesecake you wont regret it, super yummy.

Absolutely the best cheesecake recipe I have found. I added a few personal touches to it like 1/2 a cup of sour cream, 1 cup of sugar, and 1Tb of vanilla extract  and its so rich and tasty.

i made this recipe in home economics. I love to bake, and have been excelling at it. I found this recipe fairly simple. I did not think it would take me so much time to complete the cake but it was well worth the wait. i plan to make it again soon.

This was awesome! I was surprised at how easy it was to make the strawberry glaze!! A favorite from now own! My husband ate the whole cheesecake in two hours flat! I used this recipe to make two regular sized cheesecake instead of the tall cheesecake.

Fist time ever I attempted to make a cheesecake: a great success! Everyone loved it! Although I feel using condensed milk somehow makes it a recipe for 'newbies', the results isn't a 'newbie' cheesecake at all! Rich and creamy and delicious.

Absolutely delicious. All we had was a 9.5 in springform pan, but that worked fine. This recipe has you make a *lot* of strawberry sauce that nobody ended up using. If I were to make it again, I'd half the sauce and put more into the marbling.

5 stars for this recipe! I had never made a cheesecake before and was feeling particularly adventurous one night so I decided to give this recipe a try. SO glad I did. Super simple and super delicious, a perfect combination! 
--Changes I made: I only used 2 packages of cream cheese, and I added about a tablespoon of vanilla. 
--Key lesson learned: THE most important thing about making cheesecake is to ensure your cream cheese is softened so your batter isn't lumpy. 
--Things to note: I mixed everything by hand (who needs those fancy mixers?! psh!) and baked the cake in one of those disposable tin pie pans from the grocery. I used a water bath to make sure the top didn't crack.
--Fun additions: I added my own twist to later batches, like chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, coconut flakes, anything really! One thing I love doing is making these into cheesecake cupcakes (same recipe exactly, just put the graham crust in greased cupcake trays and pour over the batter).
Can you say dee-lish?!

My first cheesecake ever and it turned out great/was a huge hit! I followed the recipe EXACTLY and I wouldn't change a thing (except maybe a thicker crust because that's my favorite part ;)). This made a beautiful and delicious cheesecake that received many compliments (even from my super picky father). Thank you!

If you get cracking, try cooking in a Bain Marie(waterbath)-try a hotel pan, or put an 8 inch cake pan in the bottom of your oven 3/4 filled with water. It will keep your cheesecake moist and prevent cracking!!!!

Love it!  Used light cream cheese, and since I had a jar of unused strawberry topping, used that instead of the strawberries.  Will definitely make this again!

This is surprisingly easier than I thought it would be.
I doubleed the strawberry amount and put half of them sliced on top (toss in icing sugar) looks great and taste awesome. I recomment a 1/4 less cream cheese, maybe less sugar in the base mix over all easy and great :)

This recipe is amazing!  The taste and texture are unrivaled.  It turned out so pretty with the way I swirled the strawberry sauce.  Today, I'm making it with strawberries AND bananas.  

I do recommend baking it in a water bath to prevent cracking.

What an absolutely wonderful recipe!  I followed all of the directions as stated, except that I took the 1/4 cup of lemon juice down to 1 Tb. as some reviewers mentioned that it was a bit too lemon-flavored (I personally thought the flavor was perfect as I did it, and feel that I wouldn't have liked it as much with more lemon.).  I also did the same process with blueberries as the recipe said to do for the strawberries (blending with the corn starch, boiling , etc...though I did add a bit of blueberry jam to the mixture for a little more sweetness, since the frozen blueberries I had didn't have any added sugar), and did a layer of blueberries in the middle.  It was basically, crust, cheesecake, blueberry swirled layer, cheesecake, strawberry swirled layer on top.  It was absolutely perfect for 4th of July (I called it "Red, White and Blueberry Cheesecake"), and was a hit with everyone who tasted it.  I do feel, however, that even without the blueberry layer, that this would still be a 5-star recipe.  Also, with baking, I didn't completely do a water bath (though I do recommend them, even though this recipe doesn't mention it); I just put a loaf pan filled halfway with water in the over with the cheesecake, and when it was done, I just left it in the oven for an hour to completely cool before even opening the oven door.  No cracks at all!!!  It turned out so beautifully! :)  I even froze it before serving (setting it out to defrost 5-6 hours before serving), and it was great!!

Super easy and delicious recipe. I would not make as much strawberry sauce next time and would a little sugar to the sauce. I also like a thick graham cracker crust so would double the amount.

This was AMAZING! I made extra sauce and put the majority of it between the two layers of cheesecake. When I cut into it, the sauce just ran and it was perfection. My boyfriend loved it so much that when we went to bed that night, he actually had a dream about it- he had gone downstairs in the middle of the night and cut a piece that was 3 times the size of the one he'd had when we ate it for dessert. He said he's never had a dream of food! I had to check it that next morning after he told me about to see if it was a dream or if he'd really done it!

I made this for a family that my daughter was visiting. They raved and raved. I did add sugar to the  strawberries. They were way too tart eventhough it said they were sweetened. I was out of regular graham crackers so used chocolate ones. My daughter said it was better than the cheesecake factory. Now thats a compliment!

I have made this cheesecake numerous times and my family LOVES it.  I use splenda instead of sugar and top with splenda sweetened stawberries for my diabetic grandfather.  It has become his favorite dessert, and he requests it for all holidays.

Pretty good. I used the ruby-red strawberry sauce found on allrecipes.com. I also added cinnamon in to the crumbs for the crust, but I think I prefer the crust to be plain graham crackers. Also, the cheesecake is lemony, which isn't bad, but I prefer plain NY style cheesecake.

Soooo good!!!  I made this for my 11 yo granddaughter's 11th B/D as she wanted a cheesecake B/D cake.  She loved it!  It looked almost exactly like the picture.  She thought I bought it.  Not a crumb leftover.

This recipe is actually amazing. I put only four stars at first, but if you let it sit in the fridge overnight it gets so dense and super yummy. One of the best cheesecakes I've ever had!

Delicious! This is the first time I've ever made cheesecake! I used low fat cream cheese, and unsweetend strawberries-to control the amount of sugar-. One reviewer recommended increasing the cracker crumbs to 2 cups, that's too much!! It was a lot, so stick to the original 1 1/4 cups! I added 1tsp of vanilla extract to the crust mix and another to the cheesecake mix!  And you only need 2 packages of cheese. YUM :)

Oh. My. Gosh.
I have never made cheesecake from scratch in my life, But let me tell you.. This came out as good, if not better, than store bought or from a bakery. It's smooth, creamy, just the right amount of sweet, and perfect. I can't get enough of it! It was gone in 2 days. Amaaaazing! Thanks so much.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. I loved how the strawberries complimented so well with the lemon juice in this cheesecake. However, personal taste issue: I would have omitted 1/2 of the lemon juice because this was a pretty lemony cheesecake. Other than that it is awesome!

I've made this twice now--once as written, and once with adaptations.  With the first one, the layer of strawberry sauce that is layered between cream cheese kind of made the layers slide off each other after the cheesecake was cut, it definitely made a break between the cream cheese layers.  Strawberry sauce was awesome, but I couldn't find 10 oz packages of frozen strawberries.  Used a 24 oz container with a heaping T of cornstarch.  Second time, I wanted a blueberry cheesecake instead. I used a 12 oz bag of frozen blueberries and processed with 1T cornstarch and 1/2 C sugar, cooked the same as the strawberry sauce.  I skipped the sauce layer between the cream cheese layers, poured all the cheesecake batter in at once, and just put some dots of blueberry sauce on the top and swirled into hearts.  Saved the rest of the blueberry sauce for topping later.  
I would NEVER decrease the amount of cream cheese in this--any good cheesecake has AT LEAST 24 oz of cream cheese, and even at that, this is the shortest cheesecake I have ever made.  Other recipes I use call for 32 oz. of cream cheese.  Don't skimp, makes you look cheap!  :)

This cheesecake was EXCELLENT!  It was easy to make, it looked beautiful and it melted in our mouths.  I made it for my mother-in-law's 80th Birthday Party. It was a huge hit.  She adores blueberries, so I made it as a Blueberry Cheesecake instead!  Other than the berry swap, I didn't change a thing. Yum!

Used ingredients as described except used Neufchâtel cheese and it came out perfect. It was so good and all got eaten. I started it before I went to bed and set the timer on 47 mind just turned the oven off and didn't open it up and went to sleep woke up in the morning and it was perfect and ready for the fridge :)

Spectacular cheesecake, especially in the presentation.  It is just beautiful with the red swirls.  And it is creamy and delicious.  Only change I made was to make a gluten free crust using crushed Rice Chex - otherwise, my cheesecake-loving husband would not be able to eat.  This one barely lasted a day in this house!

This is a very creamy cheesecake, probably because of the sweetened condensed milk.  I'll probably start using this recipe as a base for other cheesecakes because the texture is so nice.  I had two store bought graham cracker crusts, so just divided it between the two crusts which was the perfect amount.  I had trouble getting the strawberry mixture to thicken up like I wanted, so instead of swirling it in the cheesecake, I mixed the topping with some strawberry jam and put it on top after they were chilled.  I baked them for 40 minutes at 300 degrees and then left them in the oven with the door cracked for another 30-45 minutes (forgot the water bath but there were no cracks).  Delicious!

5 stars isn't enough for this recipe. Almost all the desserts I make that require a biscuit base or have a filling that needs to set fail but this recipe is fantastic!! It's so simple and comes out perfect. I look forward to trying it with different berries next time.

I used this recipe for my families 4th of July get together and everybody loved it.  I had to reduce the amount of ingredients because I used a basic pie crust from the supermarket and I also made a blueberry version of it.  Both the blueberry and strawberry cheesecakes were beloved by my family....My favorite was the blueberry.

I won't make this recipe for a very long time!  This was sooooooooo good, my husband and I finished off the entire cheesecake in about three days!!!  Excellent, easy and oh my lord delicious! I didn't change a thinkg.  Okay, so maybe I will make it sooner than planned...just need to throw in some areobic excercise to counter the caloric intake.

This cheesecake is delicious and easy!  The first time, I made it with fresh strawberries, and the sauce didn't seem very sweet.  The second time, I used plain frozen strawberries with a little sugar added, and it was much better.  The third time, I used plain frozen blueberries, and although I realized while trying to process them that they really needed thawed first, they were also very good with a little sugar added.

I make a lot of delicious desserts, but this one was nothing like I expected. My husband and I love cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly. It had no flavor at all and was very bland. It definitely needed sugar or some other sweetener in the filling.

This was an amazing recipe. I made it yesterday for my One Year Anniversary with my boyfriend and he love love loved it!!! I did make some changes. I used 2 boxes of cream cheese and used a 8 3/4 foil pan (the ones that the pies come in) I also added a table spoon of vanilla extract in the mix. I used the strawberry sauce to spell out "I love you" It turned out amazing!! thanks

I made this for Mother's Day and it's excellent! I had to cook about 10 or 15 minutes longer, and the texture was perfect. Next time I make it, I will double the strawberry sauce, and use more than the 1/3 cup reserved used in the cheesecake, mine was a little pale. The strawberry sauce really adds punch to the cake, so don't skip it. I also topped with whipped cream, and everyone loved it!

This was an easy cheesecake to make and it came out tasting really good.  They don't have graham crackers here in Australia so I crushed up Oreos instead and omitted the sugar and it worked really well.  Also, my oven doesn't have specific temperature settings(!) so I just guessed and ended up forgetting it in there for twenty extra minutes and it still came out great!  The top cracked a little bit along the lines where I swirled the sauce with a knife, but I think that is more due to my lack of cheesecake knowledge than anything else, and we didn't care anyway.  Great easy and tasty cheesecake recipe!  Would definitely make again.

This turned out very good. I did add a tsp. of vanilla to the cream mixture. Also, sieved the strawberries after running through the processor (don't like the seeds in my cheesecake). Only needed one bag of strawberries. I made two 9 in. pies and baked for about 35 mins on 300. One for me and one to give. Soooooo yummy!

This cheesecake tasted very very good. Everyone said so. The only thing I wasn't really pleased with was how it loooked. The strawberry on the top sunk into the cake and it looked like it cracked all over even though it didn't. Maybe I just didn't boil it long enough to get it thick enough. But it was still good and I will definitely be making this again.

Beautiful, very tasty (and very rich) cheese cake. I made it for my mom's birthday and she thought it was the best cake she ever tasted. My kids loved it too. Very easy to make, and looks more complicated than it really is. Best of all - because it is so rich and creamy, even the most gluttonous of you won't be able to eat more than one piece, so your calorie crime is minimized in a way...

This is delicious and oh-so-easy to make!  It was very rich, so next time I will use only 2 packages of cream cheese (as others have suggested).  I think this would be good with any type of frozen fruit combo.  I used cinnamon graham crackers in the crust, and I cooked the crust for about 10 minutes before pouring in the cheese mixture (rather than refrigerating)...this made the crust a little crispier and so yummy!  I got rounds and rounds of compliments from our dinner guests.  This is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful!!!! I did add changes not because I thought I needed to but b/c I did not have all ingredients. I had 1/2 of the strawberries so I added pinapples and mixed it in the blender and I did not have condensed milk but I used reg. milk and added powder sugar to it...I will make it regular the next time but this tasted great I can only imagine how it is going to taste next time...Thank you so much for your recipe.

I tried this recipe for the first time about a month ago and it turned out perfectly!! I only used 2 packages of creme cheese though because from habit, I don't like things too rich, but all the other ingredients were the same

It was my first time making a cheesecake and the recipe was so easy to follow! The 1/4 cup of lemon juice really gives the cheesecake great taste. It's there but it doesn't overcome you.

I made it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it and so did all his friends and I make it al least once every 4 weeks just because people request it so much.

The best part about this cheesecake is the crust. Some cheesecakes are so rich and thick that you can barely taste the crust but this is perfect, not too much creme cheese and jsut the right about of crust!

A tasty cheesecake, though I found it quite rich.  I will cut down on the cream cheese next time.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake and it turned out fantastic, rich and creamy.  I did change the crust to one made with vanilla wafer crumbs and added one tsp vanilla to the cheesecake just for personal taste.  Thanks for the recipe Luverene Dove.

Best cheesecake ever!!! I followed the directions exactly, however I had to increase cooking time from 45 minutes at 300 degrees, middle of cheesecake had not set and looked a little questionable. So I had to increase time by additional 15 minutes and then another 10, for a total of 25 more minutes, thats why I only gave 4 stars.

The filling definitely didn't fit into one baking dish.  I still had quit a bit of filling left.  Also, I think it turned out well but it's a bit lemony - I think I would cut the amount of lemon by about half for this cheesecake.  I added 2 cups of graham crackers to the crust - YUM - I also added a bit of vanilla to the cheesecake mix itself.  The strawberries turned out awesome and it looked nice but the lemon was too strong - this is the first recipe that I've seen that has even called for it.  Also, it takes substantially longer to bake than the specified 45 minutes at least on 300.  I baked it for about an hour on 300 and then increased the heat to 350 and baked for about another ten minutes.

Overall I think I'd made it again but with modifications to the lemon.

I made cupcakes instead. Takes a LONG time. Also, I don't think they sell graham cracker crumbs? Not sure, anyway, it's terribly hard to make crumbs out of graham crackers, although I suppose you could buy pre-made crusts. Good, but not mind-blowing. Also, strawberry drizzle is more like strawberry jam consistency. You should top with whipped cream and freshly cut strawberries.

The only change I made was using 2 c graham crackers and 1/2 c. butter in the crust.  Every person who was at dinner had the exact same remark "This is the best cheesecake I have ever had"

WOW!  The first cheese cake I made was a complete disaster (about a year ago) and I was so nervous to try this especially because I was making it for company (my sister's birthday dessert... she loves cheesecake).  My mistake with my last cheese cake was that I used a pie pan, instead of a spring form pan. USE A SPRING FORM PAN!  It conducts heat differently and makes such a difference (and is MUCH easier to cut/serve) I used 1/2 less cream cheese and it was amazing.  I had some fresh strawberries that I had to freeze a few weeks ago and I used those.  I added a little sugar since they were not sweetened.  It tasted great in the cheese cake but when I tried to make the dripping sauce for on top, it was a little tart, I probably could have just added some more sugar.  But instead we devoured the cheesecake without any additional toppings.  So, since the Fiance ate "the last slice" (about 1/5 of the cheese cake) looks like I'm making this again!  What I would love to do is freeze some of it for when I get in the mood for Just a slice!  I googled it and apparently cheese cake freezes well!  We will see.  GREAT recipe.  TY so much for it!

Very tasty cheesecake! I have made several cheesecakes before, but this is my first using strawberries. After reading several reviews, I increased the amount of graham crumbs to 2 cups, but my crust kept on breaking and crumbling apart even after adding more butter. Next time I would only use about 1 1/2 cups. I also only used 2 packages cream cheese, but for me it didn't have enough creamy cheese flavor. I would use a little bit less sweetened condensed milk, since it was a tad too sweet for me with the strawberry sauce. I baked it at 275 degrees farenheit in a water bath for about an hour, turned off the heat, and left the cake in the oven for another hour. No cracks, perfect texture and display. I used fresh strawberries and it was no problem! Would definately make this again with a few changes.

Did it with 2 blocks of cheese as per reviews.  Was pretty tasty but found the crust way too crumbly and the cake itself to be a bit runny.

The top decoration is beautiful, but I must have done something wrong with the middle strawberry layer.  It made the slices split in half, with the top sliding off the bottom half.  If I make it again I'll just use the puree for the decoration on top and sauce to serve on the side.

Very good! I had fresh strawberries so I added 1/3c of sugar and 1 t of vanilla to make the sauce. I was able to make two cheesecakes with the amount of filling this recipe calls for.

sooo good!! my first cheesecake :)  i'll probably do something different with the crust next time..it didnt stick to the cake.  someone had mentioned they add melted chocolate in between.  that sounds amazing and like it may keep it together.  i also used a bag of mixed berries plus lots of blackberries.  i havent used the extra sauce for garnish and probably won't, but it will make a good jam for other things.  the overnight waiting was torturous!!! i dreamed about it several times thru the night.  oh and i also only used 2 packages of cream cheese and lime instead of lemon because its what i had.  OHHH one more thing.  so it didn't "crack,"  i filled a lasagna dish with water and placed it on the bottom rack.  it came out soo perfect and delicious!!

This turned out great! It tasted just like store-bought cheesecake, maybe even better! I couldn't get the sauce to the right consistency to be able to make a swirl pattern on the top :( but instead I decorated the top with almonds! (Which went perfectly with the pink tint). Mine didn't crack at all because of the waterbath. Overall, a great recipe!

I bake this today for my hubby birthday, now still cooling outside and need to put in the fridge later. This is my first time of baking cheesecake. I'm nervous yet very happy to see no crack. I only use 2 package of cream cheese and reduce the milk to 11 oz to cut down the sweetness. I only use 1 tbsp of lemon juice too. I got lumpy batter so i sieve it before bake. Bake for exactly 40 mins without water bath. Thanks for the great recipe.

Holy moly, AWESOME recipe!!!  Nothing needs to be added or altered whatsoever.  But I did use this base for mini cheesecakes (it made about 36, if you don't count all the raw batter I couldn't stop eating lol)...  I didn't have time to do the yummy strawberry sauce swirl so used canned pie filling to top them off with.  Can't wait to bring them to the gathering tomorrow.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

Super yummy!!  Like others, I made a few minor changes.  Instead of cream chese, I used Neufchatel and low-fat graham crackers, reduced the amount of lemon juice to 1 large TBSP, and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I wasn't able to find my springform pan, so I used a rectangular baking dish and made cheesecake bars.  It cooked perfectly without cracks!  The best part?  No one knew it was reduced fat!  Definetly a keeper :-)

so easy and mine did not crack but I used a water bath. I also ran out of lemon juice and subbed 1/2 lime juice so it kind of had a keylime quality to it.  Added a tblspn of vanilla too and only used 2 blocks of cream cheese per suggestions.

I made this cheesecake for my boyfriend, and he even admitted it was better than his mother's! I did reduce the amount of cream cheese to two, and added the vanilla. It was perfect!

This was very good!  I made it for Christmas and everyone seemed to enjoy quite a lot!  I did what most said to on cutting to 2 packages of cream cheese, and felt it was a little "short", so next time I will either double the entire recipe OR use the 3 packages of cream cheese.  I usually follow recipe to a tee, but since so many had recommended, I did, taste was perfect, but wish it would have been higher!  Will make again for sure!

I used strawberry ice cream topping for the bottom layer of strawberry and the frozen strawberry mixture for the top layer...just beautiful! The other thing I did, because this was for a Holiday event, was I sprayed the inside of the cheesecake pan on the sides with Pam, and then sprinkled green sugar and rolled to coat the sides of the pan before I put the cheesecake into it.  EXCELLENT! Beautiful Red and Green Cheesecake!

WOW! This was fabulous! I don't have a springform pan, so I gambled and used a standard glass pie dish. It turned out fantastic and was a hit at my Christmas dinner. Other than the baking dish, I followed the directions as written. The strawberry drizzle added so much to the cheesecake, too. I elected not to thin it and we just spooned it over the top of each serving. I have never made a cheesecake before, but I will be making this again anytime there is a need for a special dessert. I've never tasted any better cheesecake than this one. Yummmmmm! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Next time I will add fresh strawberries to the top. Don't pass this recipe up!

FLAWLESS. 5 stars doesn't do it justice. Only one thing. make sure you have a deep enough pan to cook this in. i didn't and ended up having to waste a lil bit of it. I cried a lil.

First time I ever tried cheesecake & this turned out perfectly!  I've made this several times since & it's always great.  I have substituted 1 of the cream cheeses with the 1/3 less fat version & you can't notice any difference.  Best tips for no cracking - bake with a pan of water on the other shelf to keep the oven humid, also follow the recipe & only just beat in the eggs.

Out of the many cheescake recipes I've tried, this one tops them all.  I follow the instructions  exactly and it turns out perfectly every time.  It does not look done when it comes out of the oven, but if you let it cool as instructed the texture is perfect when it's time to serve this delicious dessert!

Had to make a few changes for what I had on hand - instead of cornstarch in the strawberries, I just substituted a tablespoon of flour, and completely omitted the lemon juice.  Also, all that Kroger had in their freezer case was strawberries in a sweetened syrup (with Splenda) so I had to make do.  It came out looking a little Freddy's face from nightmare on Elm St., but once covered in left over strawberry sauce and whipped cream, no one knew but me!  Served at Thanksgiving Dinner and was VERY delicious!!!  Next time I will try my best to follow recipe exactly.

I usually don't leave reviews but I couldn't help it this time. This was awesome. I followed everything except I used two Tbsp of flour since I didn't have constarch. My coworkers couldn't get enough. Most cheesecakes are way too sweet but this was perfect. This is definately a keeper

Everyone seemed to like it, but I've made/had better. It needed 1T of vanilla extract and I could kick myself for not adding it. It was very pretty though and everyone thought I had bought it at a bakery.

Made this with no adjustments except rasberry instead of strawberry. Added a few blueberries on top to give it a patriotic red,white and blue for the 4th of july independence day barbeque we went to. YUM! Cooked in a water bath adding about 25 minutes until internal temp was 160F, no cracking or shrinkage, only problem was water leaked into the foil (and then the SF pan) making the crust a little soggy (but still delicious).

Very good recipe; I made the following modifications... I used a 8" springform pan, juice of one lemon (it was all I had), added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and used some leftover strawberry sauce that I had made the week earlier; it had some large strawberries so I scooped them out and used them in my first layer saving the smooth sauce to swirl on top.  I baked the first 20 minutes at 325 then lowered to 300 as to asure it would set up nicely!

SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!! I followed the recipes exactly except I accidentally purchased a package of raspberries instead of two packages of strawberries. I mixed the two and it came out devine. I made this for a coworkers Birthday and every piece and crumb was consumed. It is a definite keeper!!!

Excellent Cheesecake!  I did make one modification and that was to use frozen blueberries in place of the strawberries. I've made many different cheesecakes and this was ranked in my top two.  Great consistency and flavor.

Excellent - the best cheesecake I've ever made.  Directions on other recipes I've made say to bake the graham cracker crust.  This was so much better and easier.  The sauce is outstanding.  When I have a lot of guests, this will be my first choice of desserts.  I did the water bath as recommended, but it still cracked in places where I used a knife to swirl the sauce.  I just put more sauce over the top and no one knew the difference.

Easy!  I cut out half the work by using my strawberry freezer jam for the strawberry sauce and it was perfect.

I made this for my husband on his birthday.  He LOVED it!  I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and added vanilla as another had suggested. This was also the first time I tried a water bath for my cheesecake so it wouldn't have any cracks in the top.  It came out perfectly!  I did leave it in the oven to cool and to make sure it was done.  I also melted some chocolate chips to decorate the top of the cake along with more fresh strawberries.  It looked great and tasted even better.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent cheesecake! i made this for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved it. I didn't use the lemon juice, but substituted lemon extract and vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of each, and it worked well. Also, I beat the eggs separately, until they were frothy, then added them to the cream cheese mixture. I baked the cheesecake in a water bath, making sure to wrap the the bottom of the spring form pan in aluminum foil so the water wouldn't seep through.  I made the strawberry sauce but didn't mix it in, just served it spooned over the cheesecake slices.

Having never made cheesecake before I was a bit nervous but it turned out awesome! I didn't use the strawberry sauce in the cheesecake - just drizzled it on top before serving. I also did as others suggested and baked for 40 mins then turned off the oven and opened the door for another 10. I've made it twice now and it turned out perfect both times. Definitely a keeper!

Man...i am an avid baker, but have never made cheesecake before, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It did not disappoint. I made it for christmas and everybody loved it.  I got compliments left and right, asking for the recipe and how I made it so tasty.  If you're skeptical, don't be.  Give this recipe a try and i'm sure you will love it! Besure not to overmix and also bake @300 degrees for 40 minutes, shut off the oven and open the door slightly, continue to let it bake/cool for 10 minutes, then take it out and follow the recipe directions!! enjoy!

I made this for my husbands birthday house party. Everyone thought it was store bought and wanted to know where I got it. When I told them I made it they all wanted the recipe and now want me to bring it to family gatherings. This makes you look like a FINE cook!! If I could give it 10 stars I would. The only change I made was 2 pkgs of cream cheese instead of 3. First cheesecake I've ever made and truly divine!

I made this recipe twice and couldn't get it to turn out right. Using these baking directions, it had the consistency of pudding. It was tolerable the next time around, but I still threw most of it away.

AMAZING AMAZING cheesecake recipe!! I've made this 5 times now and it always turns out wonderfully! I will never look for another strawberry cheesecake recipe ever again! I always have enough leftover strawberry sauce to make 2 cheesecakes with since I don't serve it with the strawberry sauce like recommended in the directions.

This was a very easy to make cheesecake with great texture/flavor. DH especially loved adding the strawberry sauce and was sure to remind everyone to add some sauce. The swirls give it a nice touch and the strawberry flavor is not overly sweet and overpowering. Will definitely make again!

I was a little skittish about making this cheesecake, since the only ones I had made before were from the box. When I did make it, it was much easier than I thought it would be. To cooks who have not made a homemade cheesecake before: don't expect it to come out like the ones that you have to buy. The outside of it will be stiff and shiny, not smooth and fluffy like the ones out of the box. Oh, I made this cake in a 11 in springform pan which came out to 16 servings. By the time everyone was done, there were only 4 slices left over. Big hit! I will definitely make this one again.

This is wonderful!  It was my first attempt at a strawberry cheesecake; I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect!  I brought it to a quilt gathering to celebrate a friend's birthday, and I came home with an empty plate.  This is definitely a keeper!!

WOW.... THIS IS AMAZING!!!  Instead of making the strawberry sauce and swirling it into the cake, I just topped the cake with canned cherry pie filling. It was DEVINE!  Best cheesecake I have ever made or tried. Better than the cheesecake at the local bakery!  It is very, very rich. This recipe can serve about 15 people.  YUM!! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

WOW! Probably one of the best cheesecake I ever made and it looks gorgeous! The only things I did different was to add about 1 tsp of vanilla in the cheese mix, I sprayed the pan with canola oil so it wouldn't stick and I cooked the cake covered with foil over a cookie sheet filled with water. The cake didn't really looked cooked after the recommended time so I left it in the oven (after turning it off) for about 30 minutes to let it kool. It still didn't look ready after that, but I still took it out and it turned out great! I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and everyone couldn't get over how beautiful it looked. It's delicious too!

Was told this recipe is of restaurant/bakery quality! Did not have strawberries on hand, had a bag of unsweetend raspberries. Threw that into the food processor with a tablespoon of honey. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla in the batter.. Delicious!

this was the best best (did i mention best?!) cheesecake!  followed everything as directed and it turned out absolutely delish.. one thing i added was just a little sugar to the strawberry sauce reserved for using on finished cheesecake because i like it sweet.. I got compliments on it and it got ate up.. you can really tell the difference between store bought and this recipe.. so much better..

What a LOVELY and EASY cake this was to make. I did add a tsp of vanilla to the batter and reduced the amount of lemon juice to just 1 tbsp. It was a hit with my family and i will be making this again 100%.

I made this for my husband, and he loved it. I found it waaay too rich, but that's just me (I'm not a huge cheesecake fan). I was nervous after removing the sides of the pan--the cake seemed spongy and not set even though I baked it for over an hour. But surprise, surprise, after chilling for only 4 hours, the cake was set and the texture light and fluffy (but rich). I thought maybe I messed up because of the low-fat cheese I used, but now I'm just confused by what happened. In any case, good cake. BTW I'd advise that the full amount of lemon be used--it is such a nice combo with strawberry.

This is the best basic cheesecake recipe I have ever tried. I used oreos instead of graham crumbs and it was delicious. As with all cheesecakes, I baked it in a water bath, covered with aluminum foil.

This was delicious and looked great!  I loved the strawberries in the middle; made for a very unique cheesecake.  

CHANGES: 2C graham cracker crumbs, cut lemon juice in half, 2 packages cream cheese.  I did bake it in a water bath and no cracks!

I was afraid of the swirl coming out bad so I just halved strawberries and spread them out on top of it then just served the remaining sauce on top of each slice of cake.  Looked great!

My husband (who isn't a baker, chef, or cook of any sort) made this cheesecake for me for my birthday. It took him about 3 hours but it turned out great. We didn't have a spring-form pan so he ended up making it in a pyrex glass dish and then had a lot leftover so he ended up making another one in a metal pie pan and both turned out great. He had to cook the one in the pyrex dish a lot longer than the recipe called for (like 30 mins) and we don't know why but we just kept checking it over and over until it was done. The cake was definitely better 2 and 3 days after we made it and the strawberry sauce was amazing! It was beautiful and very tasty! We'll be making this again!

This is delicious and very rich.  I made it for a friend's birthday and she (and her family!) loved it.  I added about a teaspoon of lemon juice and a couple tablespoons of water to the strawberry sauce.  The lemon really enhanced the flavor!  Will make again whenever I get the chance!

This cheesecake was excellent.  The only thing I did differently was use vanilla wafer crumbs for the crust.  I made it for my daughter's birthday and she was so happy with the way it turned out.  The whole family couldn't stop talking about it.  Thanks so much.

I've never tasted a better cheesecake than the one I made with this recipe. I made it once for a party about a year ago, and people still mention it. The lemon juice gives it a really nice (but subtle) taste.

My brother asked if I bought this at a bakery!  We make this every year as my daughters birthday cake and it's amazing. We use 2 Tbs lemon juice and 1 Tbs vanilla instead of 1/4 cup lemon juice. Also only 2 blocks of cream cheese.

This was the best and creamiest cheesecake I've ever made however it is missing one vital ingredient: SUGAR!!!  Because of that, I ended up making 2 cheesecakes. However, I didn't make or use the strawberry mixture.  I just made a plain cheesecake and added strawberries on top so maybe the strawberry mixture adds the extra sugar that was needed?  At any rate, for those who are not using the strawberry mixture, add 1 cup of sugar and a tsp of vanilla extract. I will make this again using blueberries the next time!

I have never ever made cheesecake before and decided to try for Thanksgiving. I read all the reviews of this recipe and  decided to follow this advice: add vanilla to the cheesecake base and increase ingredients to make more graham crust. This cheesecake not only looked very very pretty (even with a few small cracks) but it tasted AMAZING. I will make this again and again :)

Very delicious. My familyloves the crust on the pie so I used a regular pie dish and crust all around the filling. Very good, I will definitely make again.

I made this cheesecake for Valentines Day this year. This is the first time I've ever baked a cake from scratch and it turned out very well! It cracked a little bit but I did some research and know how to prevent that next time. So yummy- and quite easy!

I made this cheescake once when I didn't have any lemons so I used lime juice instead, when I made the recipe the second time with lemon juice I preferred the lime! I used maybe a couple ml less than 3/4 of a cup and it turned out great.I love this cheescake, it always turns out great.

Wish I could give this more stars as they are VERY well Deserved.  I am not a cheesecake Fan Myself, but this has made that change.  I only tasted it as I had some left over on my finger when I was serving the second to the last piece. I wondered if that is what I was missing the whole time...  EVERY one Raved about it.  It was awesome. I love to bake, just one more recipe to pass down to my kids.  THANK YOU!

This was my very first attempt at making a cheesecake and it came out PERFECT!! I was so excited! I baked it in the water bath, which I think prevented cracks and from falling.  I used the strawberry sauce like the recipe said to do, but to me it was a little strange after if baked.  The sauce sunk, or disappeard or something and left holes in the cheesecake.  It was still delicious, but I don't think I would use the sauce again.  I made another one just plain with chocolate cracker crust and it was perfect, again!

This was delicious. My baking pan was the wrong size and the wrong kind.  I overcooked it and the cake cracked all over yet somehow it was still awesome. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and I felt it was a little too much. Next time I'll do a half if any.  I used the frozen sweetened strawberries and the sauce was great.  I'm definitely going to make this one again soon.

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake. I used the base recipe and omitted the strawberries just because I wanted to keep it simple for my first try. I can't believe how rich and thick this was, it was delicious! I'm going to try it with the strawberry sauce next time.

My boyfriend's daughter wanted a strawberry cheesecake for her 11th birthday, so I found this recipe. His entire family thought it was delicious and his daughter declared that it should become a family tradition to make it for every birthday. Needless to say, this is a great cheesecake recipe, I didn't change a thing (other than I didn't use quite so much of the strawberry sauce in the middle and on top. It was fairly easy to make as well. Thank you!

This was the first cheesecake I made.  It turned out great and was a great mother's day gift.  The only thing I might do differently next time is omit the layer of strawberry in the middle, it made the cheesecake weird in the middle.  I did not get a chance to cool it overnight, but it set well after only 4 hours.  I used a 10 inch springform pan as opposed to a 9 inch and it still turned out nice.  Make sure to follow the bake time to the "t".  I overcooked and did get cracking in the areas I swirled the strawberry.  Overall a delicious cheesecake and will make it again.

I made a double batch and did half as a regular cheesecake and half as cheesecake cupcakes.  I brought both in to the guys at work and they could not say enough good things about both!   I used fresh strawberries and added sugar to sweeten, instead of frozen.  I added vanilla to the crust and to the batter.  I also added pecan crumbs to the crust.   Its a great recipe and my colleagues can't wait to see what I bring in next!

Everyone loved the cheesecake!  My father who is obsessed with cheesecakes, said the basic cheesecake was extra creamy and delicious!  I couldn't find the frozen strawberries at my grocery store, so I used fresh instead.

I made this for Easter, and wow! My husband does not really like sweets, but he loved this cheesecake! It is creamy, not too thick or too fluffy, bot too sweet, but absolutely perfect. I also used low fat cream cheese and condensed milk, and you could not tell. So good!

The best cheesecake recipe ever!  It didn't last long.  I used 2 cups of graham wafer crumbs, but otherwise followed all directions.  I will definitely make this cheesecake again - for my son's wedding rehearsal dinner.

I did it without the strawberries and it was the best I've ever made.  Then I made it with the strawberries and it was yummy too.  I'll be using this one from now on.

WOW!!!  This was my first ever attempt at making a cheesecake, so I followed the recipe exact.  This has to be the best cheesecake I've ever had, it's so light and airy with great flavor.  Thanks for posting such an easy to-do recipe.

I made this cheese cake without the strawberries inside.  Instead I use sweetened berries over the cake.  I like the fact that it isn't too sweet since I'm Swedish and not used to deserts that are too sweet.  It turned out perfectly and was sooo creamy and delicious.

I live in Bombay , India and have been looking for a cheesecake recipe for years...tried this and it was perfect. Cream cheese is frightfully expensive here but this was worth it!

This cheesecake is fantastic! I make it for Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving every year and it is my husbands favourite. I cheat a little and buy 2 graham cracker pie shells and this mixture makes 2 perfect cheesecakes. To get a flawless result and zero cracking cook for 40 minutes, turn off the oven, open the oven door a few inches and leave in the oven a further 10 minutes. I have made it this way a dozen times and its perfect every time. Everyone raves about this cheesecake, I am currently making 4 right  now!! Wonderful Holiday treat. Thanks for the recipe it is now a family favourite!!
