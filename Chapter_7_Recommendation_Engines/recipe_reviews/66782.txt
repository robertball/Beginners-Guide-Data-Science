This was my first attempt at salsa, and it came out great! I boiled the tomatoes whole so the skin peeled right off.

Since I had a million green tomatoes and peppers still in the garden and it is going to frost this week, guess what I made today? This is really good. I didn't have any lime juice on hand so I used 2 tsp of apple cider vinegar. I did add about 2 tsp of minced garlic too.

Wow, boiling the tomatoes and jalapenos really brings out the flavor! I can't believe how good this tastes. I didn't have a tomato on hand (which is a rarity!) so I used a small can of stewed tomatoes. It still came out great.

This salsa was really good however I couldn't give it 5 stars because it REALLY needed 1 clove garlic & 1 tsp cumin. I also felt like 1/2 cup of cilantro was WAY too much & that's saying alot since I love cilantro. 1/4 cup would have been plenty.

I used tomatillos and green tomatoes and no red tomatoes, to keep it all green. If you use red tomatoes also, it will look more brown...not too pretty.

This is very good. I did substitute the Lime juice with Lemon juice and Apple Cider Vinegar because I didn't have any Lime juice on hand. I also added a few cloves of garlic.

Alright I just tasted this after it cooled in the fridge and it's amazing. I'm eating some with bite size tortilla chips and it's sooooo good. Had to add another star. Thanks OLESEA.

Needed some salsa verde for a recipe I was making and this one fit the bill perfectly. Used tomatillos but included the onion.

I skipped the onions and tomato, used 1 lb. of tomatillos, and didn't cook anything, just threw in the blender. Was delicious!

Very easy, very good.  I had no fresh jalapenos so I just used canned jalapenos and skipped boiling them, although I still boiled the tomatoes.  This makes a lot of salsa, so if you aren't sure you may want to try this, you could probably halve the recipe.  This was really good in the White Chili I recipe on here instead of the green chilis.  Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVE green salsa and this is much better than any store-brand.  I added just a pinch of sugar.

Very good. I used 4 green tomatoes instead of 3 b/c they were really small. Great salsa though.

This recipe was very simple to make and turned out a great product.  Thanks for sharing it!  With a few changes, as noted by other reviewers, it is a five star recipe.  I used 1 lb of green tomatoes, which is easier to measure accurately.  I did not use the red tomato as I wanted the salsa to remain green.  As others recommended, I added garlic (2 large or 3 medium cloves)and 1 tsp of cumin.  For an extra spicy version, I added 4 chipotle peppers.  These changes made an already good recipe absolutely stellar.

Just finished making it, it's so good I can't stop eating it. It's so easy to 
make, this will be a staple in our house all summer long. I'm thinking about dinner dishes to make using it, but it's so good with just chips, I may not have any left to cook with!!!  GREAT RECIPE! Thanks for sharing!!!

I used all of the ingredients (minus the red tomato and I added garlic and white vinegar) but in fairly different proportions because I quadrupled the recipe and just started tweaking the ingredient amounts to our tastes as I went.  The result is decently good salsa.  Not as tasty really as really good tomato salsa and definitely not as good as regular salsa verde (which is my favorite), but still perfectly fine and WAY better than the majority of jarred salsas on the market.  I gave away quite a bit of salsa to friends and plan to make another big batch to use up the last of my green tomatoes and then freeze it in containers.  Great use for green tomatoes!

I took this into work and I had one guy grow peppers in his backyard just to make it!!!  It must be good!!!  Seriously - it is!  It is easy to either turn up the heat or turn it down but it is a great base recipe to start with - Thanks for sharing!!!

I made this today using the last of the summer's tomatoes.  No jalapenos in my garden so I used Anaheims instead and I thought it turned out great. Also added some cumin as another review suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I added cumin, which I highly recommend! The family enjoyed this, it was a GREAT way to use up the green tomatoes, and I made extra batches and froze them for later!

This is really great! Nice to find a green salsa recipe that didn't call for tomatillos. I followed the recipe as written. I used my leftover cilantro stems since it was all going in the food processor anyway. I can't wait to make enchiladas with it. I will make this to freeze every year from now on.

I had the ingredients on-hand, so decided to make this, skeptical that it wouldn't be near as tasty as my long, drawn-out version of salsa verde I make using tomatillos.  Turned out on par and a lot less costly.  I dropped two cloves garlic in the boiling water two minutes before tomatoes & peppers were done.  Added 1 tsp cumin.  Used lemon juice as it was what I had.  Now I know what to do with all those green tomatoes!

Very good and easy.  Next time I will add garlic, as recommended by some.  It is not the real thing (like you get in a Mexican restaurant) but darn close.

Very good, however, it needed garlic just add one clove of minced garlic to recipe.  This takes this salsa over the edge!

The green tomatoes should be tomatillos. Never mix green and red. Add only half the amount of onion add 4 more tomatillos pablano pepper and 4 serranos. 1 teaspoon of cumin blsck pepper to taste. The tomatillos should be broiled boiling them takes away flavor same with sll peppers. The onion needs cooked so when all ingredients are blended boil on med. Heat for 1 hour to infuse all flavors together make sure you add a teaspoon of oil to it.I am mexican so ive eaten many salsas and made many as well.

I didn't seed either of the jalapenos the first batch I made and woo-hoo was it hot!  I made a 2nd batch with only 1 jalapeno, seeded and blended them, and it probably could have been a little hotter.  I did add garlic and cumen, cut back on the lime juice and cilantro.  GOT RAVE REVIEWS FOR THIS SALSA!!!!  Will definitely make again!

Fantastic idea for all those green tomatoes in the fall!  I roasted the tomatoes and peppers instead of boiling them.  This recipe was a huge hit.  Used it for a sauce with tamales.

Very easy to make and a great way to use up those stubborn end of season tomatoes that just won't turn.  Tastes very similar to salsa verde made with tomatillos.

I followed the recipe.  It was so spicy I couldn't eat it.  So, I added three more green tomatoes.  Still, WAY too spicy.  I can handle some heat, but this was like tasting fire.  Next time I'll start with just 1/2 a pepper and add to taste.

I used all ingredients as specified and it did not taste good.  I made salsa verde before and that was truly delicious. I think the tomatillos is what you need and green tomatoes are just not good for salsa verde.

Super easy! First time ever making salsa and everyone devoured it at the football party. will be making it soon. Not sure if it's worth refrigerating afterwards. A lot of liquid settled on top, so I tossed it. Only reason that I'm giving 4 stars. But it was yummy right after!

Really enjoyed this - bright and versatile.  Served with chips or chicken , this  puts those lingering green tomatoes to good use.  I added a pinch of chili powder since my jalapeno wasn't very spicy.

This was my first attempt at a green salsa verde. We have a lot of green tomatoes from our garden and I wanted to treat them as tomatillos. This was perfect!! I added 1 clove of garlic. I did not have fresh cilantro and that would have bumped up the flavors in my salsa but even with using dried cilantro the flavor was excellent and extremely easy to make. Plus I'm thrilled my green tomatoes were not wasted.

The salsa turned out really well. It has a lot of flavor and the consistency was great.  I added 1 clove of garlic and  1 tsp. of sugar.  The recipe did not state if the tomatoes should be peeled after boiling but other reviewer mentioned peeling them.  I did go ahead and do that.

I added a couple cloves of garlic for a taste. Ends up full of flavor. It is a great way to use up the green tomatoes left on your plant at the end of the season.

This is a great starter recipe for making Salsa Verde, and since I've gotten quite a few green tomatoes from the garden this is a good, convenient recipe. I wouldn't recommend eating raw green tomatoes since they can cause GI distress. I have roasted the jalapenos, onions and tomatoes before puree-ing, added garlic and cumin as well, but the recipe is good as-is.

I do not understand how people can give the recipe 5 stars and say I did not use your ingredients or recipe but here is my recipe and it was great.  I used your recipe. I have green tomatoes and cannot buy tomatillas where I live.  This was good but did not perfect yet.

Delish! I'm not a big spicy person so I quartered the jalapeno (in my defense it was a giant pepper) and it still had a tasty kick. I did add garlic and cumin as others suggested, and used part lime, part lemon, and part apple cider vinegar

I used two kinds of green Italian heirloom tomatoes (no red tomatoes), 2 garlic cloves, himalayan sea salt and small amount of pineapple juice with the lime juice.   I may consider adding some cornstarch to thicken up the verde.

My husband made this salsa to take to a football party today. In addition to the listed ingredients, he threw in a little fresh basil, used 1/2 lemon juice b/c we didn't have enough lime juice, and put in a little vinegar as some reviews suggested. The vinegar made it too strong/sour so he added 1/2 t. sugar. Then it was perfect! He got several compliments on it.
