I have never made stuffing from scratch before in my life. This recipe was so easy and soooooo good. I'm not a stuffing eatter, but I got nothing but compliments and an empty dish by the time Thanksgiving dinner was over. I will definately be making my stuffing myself from now on. Thanks for the recipe

Ours turned out too dry - could be our fault. The recipe didn't call for it, but I think it should have been covered (we cooked ours outside the bird). I'll try it that way next time and see if it remedies the dryness.

I used challah bread because I forgot to buy the bread for this, plus I added dried cranberries and toasted walnuts to this for Christmas 2001.  It was really, really easy and tasted great. I plan on using this same recipe with different variations for next year.

I cooked the onions first. Almost to a carmelized affect, then added a tablespoon of sugar and 3 tablespoons of butter in with the onions in the pan. On the side I tore off fresh bread into cube or smaller size and poured chicken broth on it. You want the bread completely covered but not drenched. Then mix the bread in the pan and cook on medium keep turning every few 5 mintues letting the mix get a little golden brown. Again I added some more butter, about 2-3 tablespoons and some salt and pepper. Afterwards add to the bird or cook in the oven. I found in the bird the stuffing was moist alone it was more dry. So you may want to add a bit more broth before cooking in oven if you are doing it out of bird. Which is the way I preferred it. P.S. Use sweet onions for this dish. I actually didn't try the egg substitute.

This was a very simple recipe to follow! I toasted bread before cutting, I used vegetable broth instead of Chicken, 2 onions, a pinch of cayenne, and real egg.  Used it in a broccoli casserole dish and turned out amazing.

Pretty Good. I added mushrooms & it was kind of gluppy so I broke up the glup pieces half-way through cooking. I think my bread crumbs weren't fresh enough also. Not really the recipe's fault.

I reduced the whole wheat bread to 3 cups and added 3 cups of corn toasting bread.  I also added chopped chestnuts, which I roasted (1 lb unshelled) before adding to the mixture.  While everyone enjoyed the chestnuts and cornbread, there were complaints that the onions overpowered the dish.  Next time, I'll only add one sweet onion and carmelize in butter.

1 tablespoon of paprika?Maybe other reviewers only added a teaspoon, I did a double take and then eventually trusted the recipe which was a big mistake.  I made it outside of a turkey and it came out really really soggy as well.  Given other reviewers remarks there may be some subtleties in getting the right volume of liquid in the final product.  The soggy paprika bread-soup that resulted was comically bad.

I use this basic recipe but use poultry seasoning, and also add 2 celery stalks chopped fine, as well as a small onion chopped fine.  Ads great flavor and all are healthy.  I omit the egg...still works well and holds together if too dry try additional 1/4 cup o chicken broth.

Very bland. I even added smoked almonds, onion powder, garlic powder and sundry other things to pump it up and it was still a flop. It was also kind of mushy. Healthy, yes. Delicious, not so much. Sorry...

When I do dressing I make a 9x13 pan full of coucornbread  No sugar add poultry seasoning, sage, celery, onion,etc.  and cook it in the cornbread with jumbo  eggs  and milk.  cook in 375 degree oven until done then I use  2 large packets seasoned dressing mix crumble the cornbread in with seasoned mix enough broth to make it juicy add salt and pepper.  Bake until done.   It won't take as long because veggies are cooked some.   I also add 6 or 8 raw eggs into  mixture this will give texture ane hold it together.  I use diluted broth from turkey and add chicken broth as needed.   I taste it to see what else it needs.  I use the roate rpan I cook the bird in.cook till ia knifr inserted in crnter comed ouy clern.  Abut 2 hours.

I needed a stuffing mix to use in 'Bruschetta Chicken Bake' another AR recipe and didn't want to use the boxed version.  This recipe came together very quickly and was a great sub for the boxed brand.  I like celery in my stuffing, so that is the only change that I made.  I would make this quick and basic stuffing to use with that recipe again or to stuff a chicken or turkey.

This recipe is so simple, and the possibilities are endless! I have yet to stuff it in my turkey, but had to try it now and leave a review. It's delicious! I increased the recipe for 16 servings. I used a loaf of jalapeno-cheddar bread and a little bit of challah bread instead of whole-grain. To the paprika, salt and pepper I added sage, parsley and rosemary. With the onions I also cooked mushrooms, green pepper, red pepper, yellow pepper, leeks and garlic. I only had a cup of broth, so for the remainder I combined chicken soup base and water as necessary. The end flavour is a wonderful seasoned vegetables stuffing, with a "kick" from the jalapenos. YUMMY!

This was one of the simplest stuffing I've prepared. I used the breads I wanted to finish up, whole wheat, rye and some white rolls. I added apples and walnuts to it. It came out wonderful and i will use the recipe again.

I cooked celery and onions in butter till they were soft.   Then add them to the bread crumbs.  Added a little more chicken broth for more moist stuffing.  Good basic recipe.

I made the sage/herb version.  The broth amount was way too much and it took almost double the time for the dressing to firm up since it was so soupy.  And, three onions was way too much. I used one med-large one. Other than those two things, I was pleased with the finish product and the taste was very good.

Way too much onion and paprika, other than that it was alright. Personally the next time I make I will only use 1 onion, 1 teaspoon paprika and possibly add celery.

Seemed to be missing something for me... Not very flavorful
