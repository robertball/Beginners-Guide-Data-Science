Friends and family loved it so much, they insisted that I serve 2 trifles using this recipe so there would be enough to go around for second helpings! I added a layer of raspberry pie filling and sprinkled slivered almonds on the top along with the almond chocolate bar shavings. It's a WINNER!

I already made this and it was delish.  I am going to make it next week but like when I made it before I was confused if you mix the cream cheese with the pudding.  I did mix the cream cheese and pudding.

I had trouble creaming the cream cheese, the pudding mix and milk.  I had little pieces of cream cheese that showed  up in the dark chocolate mixture.  Next time I make it, I will slowly add the milk to get a creamy texture.  Even with this minor problem, it  tasted great.

Pretty, Easy & Delicious!  I did modify it slightly by adding a layer of  Red Raspberry pie filling.  And instead of almond bark I used Heath Toffee bits.  So Good!!

Made it with 2 of the small pudding boxes.  White chocolate pudding, and used Heath bar crumbles on top.  Amazing!
