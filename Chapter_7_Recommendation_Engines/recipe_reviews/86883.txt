I'm glad I didn't waste a whole bunch of asparagus on this recipe. I used maybe 10 or 12 lengths, chopped them as instructed, and followed the directions. The crumbs would NOT stick to the asparagus, even after being dipped in the egg. I tried shaking excess egg off, even THAT didn't help. I came away with greasy asparagus and greasy, fried cracker crumbs. I'll stick with grilled or pan-fried asparagus with butter, but thanks anyway. :)

I only tried it with a couple of stalks just in case, and the others are right, this isn't worth the time and is a great waste of fresh asparagus

This was a great recipe!  The kids loved it.  I added some parmesan cheese to the crackers and that came out good too.

My suggestion would be to forget the egg and crackers.  Instead use a tempura batter and it turns out great.  I have used it this way at parties and it is a favorite (also use other veggies, meat, etc. with an electric skillet in the middle of the table). and everyone gets what they want.

I thought this recipe was great. I used the crackers and some italian bread crumbs and some parmesan cheese. I also used egg beaters instead of the egg. The kids didn't complain and my husband took thirds.

MY mom Hates asparagus but when it's cooked this way she loved it. The next day we all ate it re-heated, still fantastic.

I used eggbeater & a little milk then dredged stalk pieces in italian bread crumbs mixed w/equal amount of flour so crumbs would adhere when frying. Came out pretty good...actually better than fried asparagus I had at Figs--a Todd English restaurant!

Such a great recipe and so simple! I used bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers and it worked great! I made about 10 and my roommate and I just devoured them! Had to make more!

Other than the fact that I have never been very successful at frying things...  This was delicious!!  I usually like to roast my asparagus with some simple seasoning, but tonight I was in the mood for something different.  I am glad that I tried this easy recipe, and will definitely make it again, trying other coatings and adding seasonings depending on the meal and my mood!

I didn't have any eggs so i just mixed some half and half and oil on a plate to cover the asparagus. I used bread crumbs and flower mixed together to coat them and then fried them. Turned out pretty good.
