Hawaiian Sausage Skillet Haiku: "Husband adored this. Too much sweet and goopy sauce, I couldn't eat mine." Made this as directed only using a frozen bag of tri-color bell pepper strips, and starting to brown the sausage b4 adding the veggies so it'd get a little more brown and crispy, the way we like it. The sauce was just sooooo glossy and thick and syrupy sweet. My husband loved it, me, not so much. I'd have to change the ingredient ratio around in order for me to eat it again in the future, and possibly add a veggie like broccoli to make it more of a stir-fry meal.

Here's the 411;
Mix your peppers up, colors look good
1/3 C brown sugar? More like 2 Tbls was plenty 
2 Tbls cornstarch? No, just 1 Tbls does the job
Added the garlic right after the pineapple, it needs to cook a little.
I cut the  soy in half too, then added a pinch of S&P.
Great!

Made this last night in instant pot.  Added tsp sesame oil, tsp grated fresh ginger, 1 TBS Dijon mustard, and I doubled the sauce recipe.  Served over rice.  Wonderful keeper.

I've been making something identical for years. I always use a ripened pepper (red, yellow or orange) because we like the taste better, also I double the amount of sauce because over rice we like a lot of sauce or gravy for whatever dish and the sauce for this dish has that nice sweet and sour taste that helps make it real comfort food. We also have snow peas in ours.  Be hungry when you make this and don't plan on getting more then 2 servings because there is no stopping going back for seconds.

My husband loves it, but I thought it was a bit too sweet. So I added a chopped jalapeno pepper to the dish and reduced the brown sugar by half.  Still sweet, but the added heat from the jalapeno cuts it a bit.  Serve it over jasmine rice and it's delicious.

We have an onion allergy in our home, so I just left them out and it was still a big hit! I used fresh pineapple and bell peppers and I cut a bit of the brown sugar to decrease the sweet.

I thought this recipe was great.  I used good quality ingredients and followed the recipe.  Sauce amount was perfect for us.  My husband liked it and I shared it with my 92 year old mother who enjoyed it as well.  I will be making this again.

I liked this recipe but, it was very sweet. The sauce was really thick. I think next time I will use less brown sugar and less corn starch. I will attempt this one again though.

This recipe was incredible!! I am not fond of sweet and sour stuff, but this was like sweet and sour sausage on steroids! This was really sweet and delicious. I really liked it and I will make it again and again! I reduced the cornstarch by 1 T. I also sprinkled with salt. I sautéd the sausage, then sautéd the onions, then I sautéd the peppers. I took out the previous ingredients before sautéing the next. Amazing!!  Great recipe!!

We were having a pot luck at work and the theme was a Luau - so I made this dish - with one deviation - because it was a Hawaiian Luau I had to incorporate some Spam!  So I put half sausage and half Spam - and it tasted really good.  Not a Spam fan but with this dish it worked out really well with the sausage.

I made this tonight with polish sausage and canned pineapple. I think the amount of sweetness was perfect. I was a little short on corn starch unfortunately so my sauce was a tiny bit thin but I would make this again for sure. I served it over easy brown rice

I did not make any changes as those  were the ingredients I had on hand. I thought it was awesome if you enjoy a little sweetness to your dish. If I make it again I will probably use red, orange, and or yellow peppers too, for a little more color. I also might try to spice it up with some Tiger Sauce.

I used a homemade venison/beef sausage but followed directions to the letter. EXCELLENT flavor, texture and  it plated  up attractively. Will be making this many more times in the future as my husband, myself and my nephews all loved it!

My family really liked this recipe. This is a ridiculously quick and easy meal, the rice we served this over took twice as long as it took to put this together. Perfect weeknight meal. The only thing we would change is the sweetness. I loved how sweet this was ( I like sweet sauces). My family not as much. I think we could cut down the brown sugar to 1/4c, and that would work. If you like some spice add some red chili flakes to the sauce.
