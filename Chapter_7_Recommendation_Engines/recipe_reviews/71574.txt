First I lost the Olive oil because it doesn't do a darn thing for the recipe outside of creating a fat base to cook in.  I did the onion, garlic and my addition of mushrooms in the vegetable broth.  I also used 10 ounces Frozen Spinach because I forgot to buy it. I also used Mori Nu Firm.  The base before the addition of the spinach would be great alone.  Wonderful flavor.  The Tofu/Spinach addition changed it enough that since we don't use salt, I added Mrs. Dash Tomato, onion and herb seasoning to taste [which means a LOT in our case.]  To assist the mushrooms in providing the deeper tone that meat would provide, I added a tiny bit of Hickory Liquid Smoke.  It was thick and it cooked very fast however I have a stove with cast iron burners so this will make a BIG difference.  It took an hour to cook totally for me.  It did need additions of Vegetable Broth but since I always keep a large supply on hand this was not a problem.  Simply add as needed.  I pureed at the end.  Then added more broth as needed to desired consistancy and heated, served. I never made a cream soup where I didn't have to adjust at the end for desired thickness.  It's common sense. Oh I also used regular potatoes.  They worked fine.

Great, easy recipe for vegetarian split pea.  I'm not a big tofu fan, though -- so I substituted 1 ripe avocado for the tofu -- I processed the avocado with the spinach and added that instead.  It was great.

Hearty and delicious!  We added extra red potatoes and needed to cook the soup longer than two hours to ensure that the peas and potatoes were done.  

This soup is a keeper for vegetarians and meat eaters alike!

I made this last week and I would have to say it is 3 1/2 to 4 stars.  I made it the night before for a weeknight supper. My kids (ages 6 and 4) complained about it at first (I think because of the color) but they ate most of their big bowls on Thursday and they each had a small cup on Saturday as well.  I think the flavored improved as it sat in the fridge. When I was a kid my mom made the most amazing pea soup with leftover ham bones and chunks of ham.  I've been a vegetarian for many years now and I miss the full, hearty flavor of that pea soup.  I've made pea soups in the past with different herbs, such as thyme and oregano and I never really thought they did the trick. I had my doubts about the basil, but it works quite well.  My husband thought it was a very good soup. I will say the tofu does add a bit of a grainy appearance to the whole thing and might cut the pea taste just a little.  I don't know if I prefer it over straight-up pea soup, but I would imagine the nutritional content of this soup can't be beat.  I must confess I used a very good quality cold-pressed olive oil in greater quantities than called for in the recipe!  I'm pretty sure I'll be making this again.

Very very good soup! I'm not a vegetarian and really don't care for tofu, so I took another reviewer's advice and used an avocado to give it the requisite creaminess. I also used extra virgin olive oil and perhaps two extra garlic cloves, and it came out wonderfully.  For non-vegetarians, throwing some chopped ham chunks into the cooking liquid will give it a fantastic smoky flavor.  Good stuff...thanks for posting this recipe!

This is a very good recipe.  I added 1 cup of diced rutabaga and increased the broth from 4 cups to 6.  I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh (lack of availability) and skipped the blender bit.  Instead, I diced very firm tofu and just added it with the spinach and cooked a bit longer.  The blender bit gives it a strange kind of green color that's not so appetizing!

When I think of pea soup I think of swampy coloured grey mush that has been boiled to oblivion.  This soup is completely opposite to that.  It's a lovely colour of green, so it somehow transforms pea soup from a cold winter soup, to a light spring soup.  I love how fresh it tastes.  I can't taste to tofu or soy in the least.  I know that this defeats the purpose of a vegan soup, but I garnished it with a little bit of goat cheese and it was delightful.

felt the need to review this recipe in particular ... amazing nutritional value which is exactly what i'm looking for right now .. the colour was kind of scary and it was a bit bland, but adding half a jar of spicy salsa made all the difference. 4 stars for the recipe as is , 5 with salsa ..

Absolutely delicious! I tend to read recipes to get a general idea of what I need, then work on a whim with few measurements and whatever substitutions intrigue me. I used frozen green peas instead of dry split peas just cuz I like them better, and I used purple potatoes instead of red because I had just read an article about them before finding this recipe. :) They added a very nice pop of color, as did the carrots. I wish I had a yellow vegetable to throw in and then it would have been visually perfect! haha I also did half spinach, half kale in the tofu mixture for an even greater variety of nutrients, and I pureed some of the peas with the tofu. Definitely gonna make this again - probably right after I run out of this batch!

This was a great vegitarian recipe! Even my finicky 3 year old loved it-after being forced to taste it. I ended cooking it a little longer and mashed the peas and potatoes with a potato masher before serving it to give it a creamier texture. I will definitely make this again!

Really delicious and so healthy!  I'm loving this for lunch at work and feeling great about the amount of sodium compared with most soups.  You can add a little smoked paprika or hot sauce if you want to "kick it up" a little bit more, too. Who knew that tofu and spinach blended is so good!  Thanks!

All I had was lentils to work with so used those. I had to cut back on the cooking time, maybe 45 minutes tops. I have never made a more delicious lentil soup. My kids had seconds after having it for lunch and dinner on the same day! Even lentil soup with ham or other meats havent come close to how good this is. BTW it is better the next day or even after about 10 hours or so. Try it!

I didn't have split peas, so I used lentils. I also used firm tofu instead of soft, and didn't have basil but added chili powder. It was delicious! Works really well with lentils, too.

I used half the tofu and added a whole avocado, extra spinach, and a handful of alfalfa sprouts (why not?) to the blender mixture.  I think it toned down the crazy color.  It was super yummy and healthy.

very hearty and easy to make.  I did not cook it for the whole two hours...it was done in about 1.  I also added whole spinach leaves as well as the chopped for a different texture.  Good for cold days!

I made this the first time when I thought I had split peas in the pantry, but they were actually lentils.  I went ahead and used them and added a large can of crushed tomatoes and oregano. It was delicious!  I later made it with split peas, but I think I like the lentils better.

I used firm tofu and frozen chopped spinach because I had it on hand. I also added a cup of frozen corn. I used a stick blender to mix up the tofu and spinach right in the soup. What a nice change from traditional pea soup. Can't beat the added protein from the tofu.

Yummy!  I only had firm tofu on hand and it worked very well.  I added some smoked paprika at the end to give it the smokiness that I thought it was missing.  If you like spicy food, you could also add ground chipotle peppers.

Amazing soup - took less time to cook. Didn't blend the spinach and tofu together since I didn't want a creamy texture. Basil is perfect touch. Resulted in a very hearty soup and with banging flavour. Perfect for any day.

I love this recipe!  I always substitute the tofu for an avocado as suggested by another reviewer.  I also add celery to the potato/carrot mixture and I add mushrooms to the onion/garlic mixture.  Though I was worried about the *very* green look, the five little kids I served loved it, as did their meat-loving 'no weird stuff in my food' father.

I was really looking forward to making this soup, but it just didn't seem right. I followed the recipe as is and I  had to add a cup of water because it was so thick...even after that it still was very thick..I don't know...it wasn't for me..sorry!

Great recipe. I added chopped broccoli and smart bacon.  I didn’t add any seasoning beyond some ground pepper (but I love split pea soup). I ended up pureeing the entire mixture for that smooth consistency.  Thanks!

I think this recipe is delightful! I love the bright green color, the texture, the nutrition, and the flavor is pleasant. The only thing I changed is I had to use chicken broth and I started with 6 cups of water instead of 4 as another reviewer suggested. I'm serving it with fresh, hot, homemade Indian flatbread flavored with turmeric. Wonderful meal on a chilly spring evening. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE... The 2nd time I made it  didn't have soft tofu so I used firm and added just a bit of unsweetened soy milk to make it creamy. SUPER!!!

colour was perfect for the day. I did add more broth but this was probably needed because I used too many peas
I will certainly make again.   often!!! 
 many thanks for the recipe

The doggone thing just looks healthy, that is was attracted me to this dish.  Followed the instructions exactly (except I went to two grocery stores and could only find firm tofu and not soft) and it came out with good flavor but very bland, if that makes any sense.  I put in two tablespoons of chicken flavored bouillon and it perked it right up!

Absolutely stellar.  The color scared me, so I used frozen spinach (and frozen tofu).  The blend of flavors is outstanding.  And, best of all, it's EASY!!

Wonderful taste!  I think that next time, I will just add the onion to the soup base instead of frying it.  It may only be a few calories cut, but the good, rich flavor will still be there! I left out the salt, thinking that is a personal preference.The color of this soup is truly a green delight!

Absolutely delicious.  The spinach adds a beautiful deep green, as well as the extra vitamin punch, and I love how creamy the tofu makes it.  Remember that the potatoes soak up the salt and the soup may need re-salting the day after.
