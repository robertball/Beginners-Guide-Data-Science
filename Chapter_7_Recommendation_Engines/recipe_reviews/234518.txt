It's a great recipe, though I agree too salty. Use half the amount of salt though, and the seasoning is perfect. 

I don't use the oven, just a dehydrator. And a jerky gun. Great gadget to get if you want to start making your own jerky!

We tried this with ground venison. EXTREMELY salty! I think I'd use just half the amount of salt! The flavor was good though, other than the saltiness. And our meat dried much faster than the recipe states. It was only about an hour and a half until it was completely dry. Some parts even got a little crispy. I think I'd lower the oven temp and roll it thicker next time. Maybe add a little sugar too. I thought it needed a little sweetness.

I loved this.  I doubled the ground beef and did everything else as directed.  It was browned and cooked after two hours or so, but I cooked it the remaining 3 hours to get it dried and it is great.

**Made 3lbs instead of 1lb.  
-Substituted salt for 1/4 cup soy sauce.
-2 tsp black pepper

Used a mixer and mixed it up real well first.
Jerky cannon to get strips.
Dehydrator for 6.5 hours on Jerky temp setting (145-160F).

I've tried a few recipes for jerky so far, with meat ranging from high quality strips, to this.  I'm really surprised how good this is for using cheaper meat.  I'm definitely saving this, and coming back to improve it to my taste over time.  (Perhaps less garlic/onion, and a bit more spice.)

Thanks for posting it. :)

I have really enjoyed this jerky and think it is perfect. My kids like it too. I took other's recommendations and only used 1 teaspoon of salt per pound and that has worked well. I have deviated just slightly. 

First I included in the 1 Tsp. salt some "Curing Salt No. 1" that I bought on the internet. It is intended to help the meat last longer and since I have been eating the jerky within a couple weeks I probably don't need it. However I do store it at room temp in my desk at work to snack on so I will continue adding it.

Second I have been smoke cooking the jerky in my smoker for four or five hours until it reaches the right dryness. Not hard and crunchy but having just a little moisture left. This is also probably not necessary as I have prepared ground jerky in the oven before using purchased mixes and they were good without the addition of smoke cooking.

Third I am using ground venison.

I recommend the addition of 1 pinch cayenne pepper per pound. I left it out on my first batch and my impression was that it needed more pepper. So I added the recommended 1 pinch and it was perfect. By the way I have a measuring spoon set that includes "1 pinch" and have used that.

I tried rolling it out between two sheets of wax paper. It works fine but I have gone back to squeezing it out of a jerky gun. I have tried both flat strips and round. My kids like the round jerky the best and it seems to load up the tray better. I think they like round from eating purchased round jerky.

Made this using grass fed ground beef and it is very good.  If you use kosher salt the amount listed on the recipe is perfect.

Like others, I decreased salt by 1/2.  I also added 1 tsp smoked paprika...which created a nice flavor as if I had smoked them, instead of baked.  I don't own a jerky gun, so I double ground the meat and loaded it into a 1 gallon ziplock bag.  I cut a corner and squeezed it out into round-ish sticks.  Other than a bit of hand cramps, it worked well.  I also used the "dehydrate" setting on my oven...which cooked at 135 degrees F while keeping the convection fans on.  Worked out great....was ready in about 5 hours.

Absolutely  the best substitute for any prepackaged jerky mix.  Great flavor and adjustable to your personal likes.  I doubled the recipe and had wonderful results.
The next batch I make I'm going to double again and drop out a little of the salt and see what happens.

The salt content was over powering.  I'm not really liking the ginger either...

Great Recipe! This was my first time using ground meat and it took me a couple of slices to get used to the texture differences.  I used my dehydrator and I let it dry a little longer than stated.  I still got this weird droplets on the jerky but I think it is because of the ground meat.  I will ABSOLUTELY use this recipe again.

Very bland flavor glad I only made a pound to test. The flavor was nothing to be desired.

I made this using my oven and following the recipe exactly. For me there wasn't enough flavor so when I did the second round I made sure to add extra seasoning on top before cooking it. It's and ok recipe but I think I'll stick with liquid marinades because it seems to add a better flavor. The texture of ground beef is a little odd for me as well. I didn't use a gun I used a rolling pin making them into circles. Maybe I'd try a gun next time to see if that changes the texture but I'm thinking it won't.

I really liked it! I only did 1 teaspoon of salt though.  I used grass fed beef and it was frozen so I had to defrost it first and it was so fine already I could just mash in the seasonings and roll it out. I then sprinkled salt on the top of the meat. Thank you for the recipe!
