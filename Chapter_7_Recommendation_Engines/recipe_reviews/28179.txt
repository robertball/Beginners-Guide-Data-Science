This is an excellent recipe and it really does taste like chicken that you would find in an Asian restaurant.  I couldn't find regular potato starch but I did find potato pancake mix and it worked beautifully.  This is the only way I'll make fried chicken from now on.  Thanks Amy!

This chicken is absolutely excellent! A thin, crispy, tasty batter covering tender morsels of chicken. I served this chicken with basmati rice and steamed carrots. I check the local supermarked for rice flour and potato starch and found they had rice flour but no potato starch. Then I came across a gluten free all-purpose mix in the same store. The mix listed rice flour, tapioco starch and potato starch as the first three ingredients and thus I decided to give it a try. It worked perfectly. Definitely give this recipe a try. You won't regret it.

Excellent!  Japanese chicken just like in the restaurants.  I made mine with wings and my 3-year-old son loved it so much he ate 7 pieces.

This was delicious and very easy to make.....the whole family enjoyed it, even Little Miss Picky.  If you don't have a deep-fry thermometer, put a wooden utensil into the oil and touch the bottom of the pot.  If bubbles rise from there, the oil is hot enough.  If A LOT of bubbles rise, it's too hot, turn it down a little!  I put paper towels in a pasta plate and kept it in the oven at 170 till all of the chicken was fried.  Even the chicken I cooked first was still in good shape when it came time to eat!

Wonderful flavor!  Instead of potato starch, I used instant potato flakes, and also used regular flour instead of rice flour.  I even omitted the chicken granules.  Still turned out excellent.  Will be making this often.

This chicken has a really good flavor.  I used regular flour and corn starch.  It was really yummy and quick to make.

This is an easy to prepare/cook dish that tastes great. I cooked the 8 serve for 2 of us (fairly large eaters who had not had lunch) and use cornflour(corn starch) instead of potato starch but I did use the rice flour and it turned out perfect. Next time I will be serving it as sticky rice with the chicken on top and a small bowl of some sort of honey sauce to the side. A small garnish of coriander  on the rice and chicken would not go astray either. But it was great.

this is a great fried chicken recipe.  i usually chop more garlic & i agree with one of the reviewers: chop it garlic & ginger really small.  i also just used regular flour & cornstarch & it turned out great.  sometimes, if i've time, i prepare everything & marinate it overnight.  to make it super crispy, oil has to be very hot before you dump chicken pieces in.  it's very flavorful.  really enjoy making it.

I was very pleased with the results. The chicken was delicious! I used a bit more garlic than the recipe suggested which turned out very well. Easy recipe, definitely worth the time and effort.

i'm from Hawaii and this dish is very common. it's called "mochiko chicken" as mochiko is the brand of rice flour/mochi flour that we have here. it costs less than a dollar a box. try adding some oyster sauce to the mix too. delicious!

Great!  I make big batches of it, and freeze them for my daughter, so she can have her favorite chicken anytime!  It still is crispy after freezing!

We have made this with the rice flour/potato starch and then with regular flower/corn starch and did not notice a difference. It never got really crispy as we would have liked it, but it was still pretty tasty.  Letting it marinate overnight gives it better flavor.  We might add a few more items to give it more flavor - maybe some (bear with this spelling now) terriki sauce in the mix.  Not a bad job however.

Very good- I was surprised at how much flavor it had after just 30 minutes of marinating.  I'll be making this often!  Thanks for submitting it!

This is pretty close to the karaage chicken I had in Japan. I made this last Thursday, and today (Monday) my daughter has requested it for dinner tonight. 
I did not have on hand the rice flour or potato starch, so I had to substitute with regular flour and cornstarch. I can only imagine how much more delicious this dish would be if I had the original ingredients!
Definitely will be a repeat dish for my family!

Great recipe! If you can't find potato starch, use potato flakes and grind to a "flour" like consistency in a food processor. Mix with the corn starch. I make a big batch and keep on hand for next time. Also, to keep from biting into large pieces of garlic or ginger, grate them. Hope these tips help!

This reminded me of when I was a little girl a chinese place in the mall sold little chicken drumsticks that tasted just like this, a couple owed the resturant and it closed after the husband murdered his wife. I didn't think the batter was going to cover but it cooked up very nicely. It was not as crispy as I would have liked it but I used a very hot deep fryer, maybe next time I will pan fry them to be crispy. Very tasty, my children ate them up.

This is a regular dish of mine now for three years now. For better results, I double the amount of flour and starch (it's worth going out of your way for the correct flour), at least triple the amount of soy sauce and sometime substitute the grated ginger with powdered. Using light peanut oil makes a difference too.

Didn't have sweet potato starch (just Katakuriko potato starch) to do Taiwanese popcorn chicken and already had the meat marinating with 2 teaspoons of 5 spice powder so I thought I'd do something with this recipe.  I used Mochiko sweet rice flour, added 1 tablespoon rice wine, used brown instead of white sugar, had no sesame oil on hand and added 1 tablespoon tapioca starch after my first batch seemed flat.  I used white pepper instead of regular and had to add quite a bit more rice flour.  This recipe is so versatile - if you eye it, you can't go wrong.  Thank you!

This was certainly good, just nothing spectacular. I did not have potato or rice items so used flour and corn starch. Tasty and the kids enjoyed it.

I didn't like this at all.  I thought the chicken was dry and didn't have as much flavor as I wanted.  But, I made this dish for a get together and my friends loved it.  I was disappointed though, so I don't plan on making it again.

What a disappointment.  After all the rave reviews I thought it would be really good.  The chicken was tasteless and the chicken wasn't juicy or dry.  I marinated the chicken overnight.  I wouldn't bother making this again, but for those who want to try it, you might wasnt to double the soy sauce (and sugar to balance out the soy sauce) for more flavor.

Very good.  I was pleasantly suprised at how well this fried chicken turned out considering that I rarely "fry" anything.  I had the opportunity to let this marinate all day.  The flavor was nice and the batter was very light. My husband didn't act to impressed when he first took a bite, but ended up eating more than any of us and finished off the left-overs. Needless to say I was very pleased with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Try using panko instead of going to the trouble of finding the rice flour and potato starch.  Lots of big chain supermarkets carry panko in the Asian food section.  This tastes great as a breading for fish, too, and those you can broil in the oven.  Good stuff!

Couldn't stop eating them. I made them with wings and they reminded me of these ginger flavored wings I used to buy from Chinatown in san Francisco.

Great recipe! Very easy to make.  I used red pepper to give it just a little more spice and I also used corn starch and regular flour.  It came out great and the whole family LOVED it!!!

The chicken was very flavorful and smelled good while cooking. I didn't know what to serve it with though; I think next time I will either use chicken wings to make it, or cut the chicken into smaller pieces(1/2" - 3/4") and serve it as popcorn chicken. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a favorite.  I make it at least a few times a month.  The potato starch and rice flour really help it be as crispy as I like, though I am currently in a place where I don't have access to rice flour, so I can testify that it's fine either way.  Be sure to chop your garlic and ginger really fine.  I don't think it's as good with big chunks of ginger hanging around.  This is great on top of any kind of rice.  I love it because it doesn't take an eternity to marinate!

This was a very good recipe.  I didn't use eggs and I didn't have any fresh ginger so I just used ground ginger and cornstarch it came out wonderful.  Tasted just like the chicken I used to get in Japan.

Excellent! Make sure your chicken pieces are about the same size before frying, it'll cut out the guess work to see if they are done or not. Great for kids as is, or add a sauce for dipping or to put over rice. Yummy!

I've made this a few times and everyone raves about it. A couple tips to try, instead of adding the chopped ginger, grate it and use the liquid from it, some people don't like biting into ginger. Also after you cook the pieces for a min or so, remove the chicken and let rest on a rack for 1-2 mins, that allows the residual heat from the oil to go through the chicken, and allows the oil to come back up to temp. then re add the chicken for 2nd time, cook for a couple mins then remove again, and let rest, re add for third and last time and cook for a min or so.  You'll find it makes for a much more crispy chicken. Learned that while I was visiting Tokyo last year.

Totally awesome.  I had to order the potato starch and the rice flour off the internet (no asian markets around here!)  I also used ground ginger instead of fresh grated.  The chicken tasted JUST like that from a good restaurant.  I served it with a brown sauce from this wensite, it was SOOO good, and I will make it for company, it was easy too.

I recommend marinating slightly longer. I used the leftover marinade to make a buttery gravy. To a half-stick of butter, I added 4-5 spoons of the marinade, melted these together over low heat, then added a tablespoon of flour to thicken the sauce. It was yummy with the chicken. The grated ginger in it made the gravy light and fresh.

Amazing! The chicken turned out tender and delicious.
I did however make some changes. Instead of sesame oil I used extra virgin olive oil,  potato starch was substituted with sharp or hard flour (I'm not sure how it's called in english) and I used all-purpose flour instead of rice flour. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the tip and it turned out great. I'm definitely making this again.

This was really good!  Couldn't find potatoe starch so used instant potatoes, really great flavor and easy to make.  I used boneless chicken thighs just because I prefer dark meat.  Will make again!

I deboned chicken thighs and cut them into 2 to 3" squares, as my family is not real big on white meat.  I deep fried them at 325 degrees and was glad I did: they turned a beautiful golden brown and tasted so good...tender like I remember the little restaurants in Japan made and so very crunchy.  Got to love it!

Turned out well.  Substituted corn starch for potato starch & all-purpose flour for rice flour.
