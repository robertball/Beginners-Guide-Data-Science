I don't know what the others were talking about.  This was a great recipe.  I used honey mustard instead of dijon and honey teriyaki barbecue sauce instead of plain teriyaki sauce.  But I also used only 4 oz of mustard on 6 whole chicken breasts and I think that helped the mustard not overpower.  The chicken came out so juicy.  I lightly greased the bottom of the pan and my "sauce" didn't burn at all.  And I used real bacon crumbled up to lessen the salt content.  This was perfect with pesto rice. This was an overall great dish!

I LOVE this recipe! It is so simple, great for dinner in a pinch. I used Kikkoman Terriyaki sauce and did not think it was overly salty. I prefer to wrap the chicken with the bacon- I think it comes out better that way! GREAT recipe, very tasty, have used several times... and will continue to! :) Thanks!

I am a man who rarely cooks - yet I was able to make this dish with ease and it turned out great.  My wife and I love it and have it once a week.

We've even made it for casual dinner parties with great results.

I follow the recipe to the letter, except I substitute "Dijonaise" (dijon mustard with mayo) for the mustard.  After trying it both ways, I find that the Dijonaise creates jucier results.

As to the bacon, I start with fresh bacon and microwave it crispy and then crumble/chop to make the bits.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I used T.Marzetti's Dijon Honey Mustard dressing instead of the dijon/teriyaki.  It tasted wonderful!  The kids (5,5, and 3) loved it, too.  Also, you guys who didn't like the bacon bits probably used those fake ones, right?  Try Hormel Real Bacon Bits in the jar.  They are like little bacon pieces instead of red ceramic (haha).  You'll love it!

I love all of these ingredients, so I was very excited about this recipe.  I thought that 30 minutes at 400 was a little strange so I did the more standard 350 for one hour.  The chicken turned out moist and perfectly cooked, but the whole thing was VERY salty.  I even used real bacon as was suggested, and sweeter terriyaki sauce.  I like strong flavors, but this was just too much.

I cut down on the cheese and mustard a bit. It was very easy, but it was too salty for my taste.

Really delicious!  I didn't know if the dijon/teriyaki pairing would work; but it really did.  It might have helped that I didn't use processed bacon bits but instead fried up three strips of bacon for the three chicken breasts I was using, and chopped it up in the magic bullet.  The processed bits are way more expensive and don't taste nearly as good as fresh bacon.  This recipe is great because you don't need to measure, just slop it all on and it will taste great.

This was OK, however the chicken was somewhat dry and the amount of dijon mustard suggested seemed a little much for my boyfriend and I, so the second time I made it I used less mustard and it came out better.  May also depend on the strength of the dijon mustard.  Good recipie if you like a strong tasting spicy sauce.

Very easy and good!  I chose a teriyaki sauce with the lowest sodium content I could find due to the reviews saying it was salty.  I also mixed the dijon mustard and teriyaki sauce together with a small whisk before pouring over chicken.  Delicous and added to my recipe box- will definitely be making again.

I was pretty excited about this but unfortunately it may just not be for me.  I did not like this chicken at all, but my boyfriend did (although he might have been saying that 'cause I can be a wee bit sensitive about my cooking).  Just because I didn't like that does not mean its bad, try away everyone, what's the harm.

I wanted a new recipe to take to a potluck dinner, and tried this one. I made it for my family and we really liked it.  But when I made 
it for the dinner my husband was upset that it
was gone before we got to it.  I've shared it with friends and it was a hit there.  I read the reviews and made these changes for my version: Honey Mustard, Honey Teriyaki Barbeque Sauce, real bacon pieces and shredded Italian cheeses
(the version I used had 4 chesses blended). Thanks, it was fast and tastey.

This was great!  My husband was a little skeptical of the Parmesan, but he really enjoyed it.  My sister was skeptical of the bacon, but wouldn't have been the same w/o it.  I did sub honey dijon salad dressing for dijon mustard (I used Kraft brand) and the results were outstanding!  Thanks for sharing Aimee...your husband was right!  TIP:  The lefovers are amazing on a salad...perfect! // Addition: I made this again...left out the bacon and used soy/worcestershire combo instead of teriyaki...and used twice the amount.  Still used salad dressing.  It was even better!  The sauce is great spooned over potatoes!  I also used boneless, skinless thighs, which my husband likes better.  His favorite chicken recipe, now.

I made this recipe for my dad, and he thought it was great. I used a teriyaki bbq sauce instead of straight teriyaki. Served it with some rice, and he now requests it at least once a week.

I added about 3 oz of dijon mustard and 1 oz of honey mustard, mixed up well and then added 1/2 cup of Teriyaki sauce to the mustard mix.  Once all mixed well, I poured it on 6 chicken breast halves.  Then I put some grated parm cheese on it and 1/4 cup bacon bits and about 1/3 cup reduced fat mozzarella cheese.  I baked it for 30 minutes exactly at 400.  IT WAS PERFECT!!!

My husband was a little suspicious of this when I put it in front of him, but the more he ate, the more he liked it.  I've made it three times since and I would recommend highly.  Doesn't get much easier than this recipe.

OH- as the mixture had a tendency to stick to my dish, I'd spray a little non-stick spray beforehand!

I tried this even though i read so many bad reviews.  I wish i hadn't!  If anything, I'd suggest using low-sodium terriyake and less dijon...and marinate the chicken in that first.  I used one of the suggestions to wrap in bacon instead of using bits...but use real bacon bits instead of wrapping in bacon slices...is easier to cut and eat.

Excellent.  Tastes refined and sophisticated.  You MUST use Dijon mustard to get the right taste (the white wine in dijon seems to be a big part of the flavor), and use low-salt terriyaki and low-salt bacon otherwise you are just asking for the "too salty" experience.  I feel the parmesan is optional in this recipe.

I didn't measure the quantities and just smeared the chicken with mustard, poured over some sweet teriyaki and then sprinkled bacon bits and cheese.  It was very easy and tasted quit good will definitely make again.  Though the cheese I used was not fresh and not sure it added much.  Next time may skip it.

This is an excellent quick recipe.  I followed it with the change of using honey mustard instead because that is what I had on hand.  I also used an apricot terriyaki glaze i found at the store.  It turned out very good.  I only cooked it for 25 min and it may have only needed 20.  Overall it was excellent and I will definetely be making it again.  Prep time is so minimal and my husband even loved it which is sometimes hard to do!  Thanks Aimee!

I use Jack Daniel's Honey Dijon for this, and thicker marinade style Teryiaki.  My famiy loves it, and it's so easy to make!  Tastes great w/some simple parmesan noodles.

5 Stars for such a quick and tasty dish!  I also used real crumbled bacon, and since I had a lot of mushrooms, I sauteed them and threw them in on top of the bacon and sprinkled the Parmesan over all.  Turned out great.

I liked the taste quite well, but it was a bit too salty.  I used bacon bits and will try regular bacon next time to see if that makes a difference.

My husband and I just finished this chicken for dinner.  It was delicious.  It came out very moist and had a great mix of flavors.  I essentially wanted to lick the bottom of the baking dish, but it was too hot.  I might go back to it now though since it has cooled down.  One note, I usually salt and pepper chicken before cooking it, but this recipe definitely did not need that with the teriyaki sauce and the Parmesan cheese.  Glad I didn't automatically do that like I usually do.

So I used this recipe as a base for my own creation...
instead of dijon, I used honey mustard
instead of teriyaki sauce, I used BBQ sauce
instead of parmesan cheese, I used cheddar cheese
instead of the bacon bits, I used the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing with bacon and onion flavor (delish! but high in cals/ fat, so I didn't use too much)

So easy though, just put the chicken in the baking dish, cover each piece with honey mustard and spread over the chicken with spoon or brush. Then zig-zag drizzle each of the BBQ sauce and Ranch over the pieces of chicken, then sprinkle cheddar cheese on top. Cook at 400 degrees for about 30-50 min depending on the size and type of chicken breasts (we prefer on the bone/ with ribs because it keeps the meat juicy, about 45 min to cook) Made with rice and veggies and our family LOVED it! SOO YUMMY!

Fantastic recipe! I used Teriyaki Marinade which is a lot thicker and I coated the bottom of the chicken with the mustard and Parmesan also.

We've been making this for a while now and really enjoy it.  As is, it's a little heavy on the mustard.  I've found that 1 TBS of Dijon per breast is the perfect amount.  I use a thick honey/teriyaki 30-minute marinade in place of regular teriyaki sauce.  You can find it in the BBQ sauce section at the store.  I add a little more teriyaki sauce to the dish as a personal preference.  I combine the cheese and bacon before sprinkling on.  Bake at 375, 45 mins.  To keep the cheese from burning and the chicken moist, I cover the dish with foil and remove about halfway through.  Then I use the juices to baste over the top a couple times before it's done.  Comes out perfect.

I don't care what anyone says, this is a great recipe. It's the easiest thing in the world to throw together, especially since I only cook for two. I never have bacon bits at home so I wrap the breasts in bacon. I tried it with pork chops once and it did not taste very good, but it's perfect for chicken!

This chicken is fantastic!  It is so easy, and so tasty.  My husband loves this recipe.  It has become a staple in our house.  I have tried it using the cheap grated parm you get at the grocery store and also with real shredded parm, and have found that the grated parm works better.

This is the best chicken I've ever had in my entire life.  I think the recipe calls for a little more mustard than a lot of people would like, although I was fine with it and so was my family.  I've been asked to make it again, and I will.

Very good and very easy/quick!  I make this about once a week for my family and its become a favorite!  I pound out the chicken first and take off 5 min. of baking.  Makes them a little more juicy.

I figured I'd love this since I love mustard, and I did, although I didn't think there was enough mustard flavor--but I just barely coated the chicken, so that could be why.  Bf even tried it (he hates mustard) and said the mustard taste was there but bearable.  I'll add more mustard next time, and make him different chicken again (he got regular breaded chicken breasts instead).  I used real bacon bits--the kind that come in a bag, not in the spice container--and real parmesan, so just sprinkled a bit.  I really like this and the cooking method and time was spot on, even though I was a tad concerned.  Worked really well and I served with roasted red potatoes and salad.  Great meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good and I would make it again.  I used enough mustard to lightly cover both sides of the chicken. I omitted the bacon. It was delicious.

This dish was delicious!  Fussy husband enjoyed it.  What makes it the best is that it is so easy to make.  I tried the 1/2 mayo & 1/2 mustard variation but thought it would have been better with all mustard and probably still would not have been too salty.  Will try marinating the chicken next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My kids loved this! I was out of Dijon so substituted honey mustard.  It turned out great!  It was moist, flavorful and had the right blend of flavors to please even the pickiest of eaters!

This was an easy and surpisingly tasty dish. I didn't think I'd like the combo, but I used other rating suggestions and used 1/4 cup teryaki BBQ and 1/4 cup honey mustard & real bacon bits. My boyfriend loved it too, and he's not one to rave about a dinner. Thanks, Aimee!

Fantastic! I didn't have parm on hand, but I felt safe skipping it after reading some of the reviews.  This was really easy and delicious.  I generally followed the recipe, using Dijon mustard, teriyaki sauce, and bacon bits (I nuked some bacon then crumbled it), but I only made eyeball measurements.  My husband really liked this too, and he's not easily impressed.  I'll definitely be making this again.

A simple recipe to use when you are short on time and have left-over bacon! Chicken was very moist. I melted approx. 2 Tablespoons of butter in a glass baking dish (in the oven while it was preheating) and then added the chicken. I also put all of the liquid ingredients with the chicken into a ziplock bag to evenly mix everything together. Not bad!

I tried this and loved it. As others have said, I chose to use honey mustard instead of dijon and covered both sides of the chicken with it. Also used real bacon bits. Use more teriyaki sauce than what is called for and it will give you enough sauce to put on top of the chicken and on the mashed potatoes I served it with. I'll definitely make this often.

So, made this last night and kids and I LOVED it, DF is NOT a fan of mustard, especially not dijon, so he ate it, but will not like it again. But I still have to give this 4 stars for ease, taste and its different and NEW! I served it with cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed veggies, even my SUPER pick 4yo ate it!

We tried this and loved it - we have since made it for family members when entertaining :)

I find the mustard can be a bit strong (especially if using English mustard as we did) but my hubby loves that! We just changed the amount of mustard on each breast depending on personal taste. Great with potatoes and veg or on top of pasta :)

I've made this recipe several times.  It is great exactly as is, but also with real bacon, or mozerrella cheese substituted.  I'd suggest using a nice thick teriyaki sauce, and make sure to use a smallish pan to help prevent the sauce from burning as it cooks.  Yummy!  4 1/2 stars!

The bacon burned a bit when cooking, but otherwise it was pretty good!  Make sure not to use too much mustard.

My boyfriend and I just loved this recipe.  I am a terrible cook and it turned out great.  It was even better the next day. But make sure you don't use hot dijon mustard I think I was too spicy with the teriyaki sauce.  Oh and I really don't think the bacon bits helped but make it saltier and I don't care for that, but my boyfriend who doesn't like teriyaki or my cooking loved it.  This Recipe passed the Test!

This has a slightly unusual taste but is WONDERFUL! I made it last night and my husband and I both loved it. I used real bacon and had to make homemade teriyaki sauce because I didn't have any on hand (I used soy sauce, garlic, mustard, and ginger).  Definitely a keeper!

This is OK but not my favorite.  Teryaki sauce and cheese with bacon bits is a weird combo.

I thought it was pretty good! My fiance on the other hand... did not like it at all, but he doesn't like mustard apparently.

We liked this one.  I think it'd be great in the cooler months of the year since it has a comfort food feeling to it with the dense cheese and bacon.  The taste was good.    I'd recommend putting the cheese down first and then the bacon bits on top because it sticks better.  This recipe will certainly be on our regular rotation over the winter and fall.

Really a very tasty, interesting dish. The only hassles were the fact that the time noted in the recipe at that temperature resulted in chicken breasts that were not done - add another 15 min. As well, the cheese came out hard as rock. Might suggest putting it (the cheese) on during last 5-10 min. Otherwise a great dish.

If I make it again, I will use less mustard and will mix the teriyaki sauce with the mustard.   Very moist chicken, though.

This recipe was incredible.  The combination of teriyaki and dijon doesn't particularly sound good, but it was amazing.  My girlfriend and I were impressed, thanks...

This is delicious--the chicken comes out so moist!  I sprayed my dish with PAM, but the sauce still stuck to the bottom--next time I will line the bottom of my dish with foil.

Normally, I do not cook.  EVER.  But I decided to surprise my girlfriend with dinner, and this appeared to be a simple way to test my cooking skills.  I am so glad I found this recipe!!!  Neither one of us likes mustard, so I left the mustard out of the recipe, but it still tasted delicious.  I marinated the chicken for two hours in the teriyaki sauce before cooking it.  My girlfriend was very surprised, and has raved about the chicken for three days now.  To anyone looking for a fast, simple meal that tastes wonderful, this is it!!!

I scaled this recipe down for two and found it wonderfully delicous and easy to make.  I used the called amount of dijon, but used a honey dijon instead with a splash more of teriyaki sauce for a sweet flavor!

I made these for my husband and myself and I think I used too much mustard because the flavor was overwhelming.  The chicken was tender and I will try this again but I'll be careful about the amounts.  All of these ingredients have strong flavor.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The dijon gave it a wonderful flavor.  Try low sodium teriyaki sauce to cut down on the salty flavor.

I made a few modifications by using honey mustard and 2 tsp of dijon mustard. I did not have teriyaki sauce so I used worchester. My kids love parmesan, so I served the chicken with extra cheese on the side and they liked it too. Great recipe.

Very very easy to make and really quite tasty.  Interesting combo. of flavors. Next time i would put less mustard-a little strong for me.
Also, the chicken was still pink after only 30 min.-i baked it for 40.

This was a hit at my house! The recipe itself wasn't very descriptive and I covered the entire chicken with Dijon mustard... Definitely will only coat the top next time. Also on my stove, 30 minutes made it a little drier (which was fine to me) and my fiancé requested I cook it a little less next time. That aside it was great!!! I even had leftovers for lunch today!

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I followed it as is and it was perfect.  The next time I made it, I used Wasabi mustard instead of Dijon mustard, and my husband liked it even better.  I now double this recipe and for the rest of the week we have the chicken sliced over salads for lunch.

So. Tasty. 

I really didn't think something that simple would taste so good! Oh... and I used real bacon crumbled in it. May have been the game changer. Still.. amazing. Can't wait to eat the left overs.

This was quote, "Total homerun" with the family. I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I used the sauce I have for homemade stir fry. Big trick: take time to make the bacon bits from bacon. Big chunks of yumminess. I cooked only 20 minutes in 400 degrees in my electric stove. Cooked perfectly after letting it rest. I'll be making this again.

Made it straight from the recipe without changes.  It was fantastic!  My roommate and I devoured them all.  It has the tangy flavor you expect and the other toppings just compliments the chicken perfectly.  This is certainly going to be making some repeat appearances, likely with some Italian seasoned rice .

While this recipe was super easy and quick to make, it was just lacking a little something. I liked the topping, but I agree with some of the others who said it tasted a little bit bland on the inside. I will make this again, but will take others advise and marinate it first.

I made this, according to the recipe and I ended up making sandwiches. My husband and my two kids hated it.  We don't usually use much salt... so this was overwhelmingly salty to us.  Altho.... it smells AMAZING when its cooking... the end result was not so good.  Might try it again one day and cut the recipe in half.

Wonderful!  So moist!  I am very sensitive to dry chicken, and so this is one of my very favorite chicken recipes.  Everyone who tries it asks me for the recipe!

Very good recipe. I used Honey Dijon Mustard along with the Teriyaki. I slightly cooked the bacon strips in the microwave to render some of the salt and fat. Then wrapped the Breasts with the bacon while it was still pliable. Came out very good and the bacon was not overcooked in a 400 degree oven. I also put the cheese on the chicken before I applied the bacon. Very tasty and juicy. Served it with steamed Collard Greens. My lady loved it!

Made exactly as stated. It was ok but I did find it a bit salty. Super easy though so I'm sad that it wasn't an instant new favorite as I probably wouldn't make it again.

I halved the mustard and the teriyaki sauce so it wasn't too tangy for the kids.  I think next time I will use honey mustard.  I used real bacon pieces also.  A foil lined pan is a must.

This was soo good. My MIL made it tonight and she wrapped the chicken breasts in bacon instead of using the bacon bits but, it was so yummy. I will be making this in the near future!  Thanks Aimee!

We loved this chicken.  I didn't add the bacon bits because I was out.  It was super quick and easy to make and it had a lot of flavor.  Even my pickiest eater loved it.  We'll definitely make it again!

This was great!! My husband absolutely loved it.  He said how great it was at least 3 times while he was eating it.  I did us 2 ounces of Dijon mustard plus 2 ounces of Honey mustard.  I blended the mustards and the teriyaki sauce before putting it over the chicken.  Add the cheese only at the last 10 minutes of cooking.  So moist and what a different but great taste.  Thanks for a new way to fix chicken!!!

I didn't have any bacon, so I left it out, and I don't think the recipe suffered too much. Used whole grain mustard. A little mayo mixed it would probably have been a nice touch.

This was easy and quick. It got mixed reviews at the table...but I really liked it. I also added cheddar cheese to the top. The sauce kind of slid off the top...next time I will probably marinate the chicken ahead of time.

Great chicken recipe! My husband is so burned out on chicken right now, but he said dinner tonight was very good. 
I pounded out the chicken to 1/2" thickness and doused them with a honey mustard/dijon mixture. I also added sharp cheddar cheese on top with the parm. 
Great recipe!

The ingredients sounded a little odd, but this was delicious! I used the Teriyaki Sauce recipe by Kevin from this website instead of store bought. I just used a little cornstarch and water to thicken it. I think that maybe commercial teriyaki sauce may have been the problem for the people who said the dish was too salty. Mine was just right for me. Next time I am going to try using chicken thighs and cooking them in the crock pot! Thanks for sharing.

This was great. I am trying to do Weight Watchers again and am always looking for new ways to fix chicken. I did not follow the recipe amounts, instead I measured per piece of chicken (to be able to figure the points easier). I used 1 tsp. mustard, 1 Tbsp. teriyaki sauce, 1 slice precooked bacon and 2 tsp. cheese on each piece. The result was very mild but flavorful and 1 piece was just 6 points on Weight Watchers.

This chicken is very tender and tasty. I was out of bacon bits, so I used low fat bacon that I had on hand, and was still great. The bacon actually tenderized the chicken and it was very moist. Besides that, I followed the recipe exactly. I will be making this again-very easy.

This was a big hit for most of my family.  My preteen son didn't care much for it, but everyone else (including my picky 7 year old) loved it!!  VERY fast to prepare (simple and I already had all of the ingredients!!!!) AND not a lot of clean up (place on foil covered pan before baking)

My husband and I love to try new recipes, and I like all the ingredients very much...but it was the worst meal I think I've ever made.  It tasted exactly like a hot dog.  With lots of mustard on it.  My husband said the same thing.   So, if you don't mind that, this recipe is for you.  But don't make it if chicken is what you want for dinner!

My whole family loved this recipe. Quick and Easy.
Use foil wrap or the sauce will stick. I also added some honey to cut down the strong mustard taste and added some mozzerella cheese too. There were no leftovers.

I marinated the chicken in the mustard and teriyaki for about 3 hours before baking.  Used one of the best sauces on the market (Very Yeri Teriyaki), and it was, without a doubt, the SALTIEST tasting chicken I have ever had!  The clean up was a pain, too.  Next time I'm using foil, because that baking dish is going to have to sit overnight!  I guess we'll see what my husband says about it when he tries it tonight, maybe it'll taste better as leftovers.  I won't be making this again.  Nice idea, though!

I thought that this chicken whas great. It is so easy. The only thing that I changed was real bacon bits and I added shredded Cheddar cheese with the parmesean cheese. I love to make at the end of the week then on the weekend for lunch I make sandwitches out of the chicken with hoggie bread. My family loves it!

It was really salty and the flavor overpowered the chicken.  I cooked it at the recommended temperature and time and the while the sauce was burnt on the bottom of the pan, the chicken was still a little raw in the middle.

Actually tasted even better reheated the next day. Came out really great, but I just did not tasted the Teriyaki at all.  A lot of reviewers stated that the saltiness of the Teriyaki was overpowering.  I am actually considering marinading the breasts for a bit next time. I cooked Turkey bacon beforehand and chopped it up.

The coating on this chicken is fabulous! It can tast a little salty or overwhelming on a filet, however. I now use it on chicken breasts as they are thicker.

This was a fine recipe!!! The only thing i did different, since I love teriyaki sauce, was that i used 1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup. But like i said it is only because thats my preference. Fine recipe Aimee!!!

Very quick and simple.  I topped with grated cheddar for the last 5 min. of baking.  Thanks Aimee!

This one is fantastic! My husband NEVER compliments a dish except to say "It's okay".
This one he actually said "mmm,very good,babe"!
I used Honey mustard instead of Dijon and increased by a 1/4 the teriyaki sauce which i mixed with a bit of teriyaki glaze. I LOVE it!

I was glad to find this recipe.  I had an hour to think of something for dinner and be ready to serve it and this was it!  It couldn't have been easier.  I thought it sounded like it could be dry so I poured about 1/4 cup of melted butter over the top before baking and baked at 350/45 min.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  Thank you, Aimee.

It wasn't bad!  My husband liked it, and I thought it was ok.  I'll probably make it again - just not every week!  Was VERY easy!  
I didn't use as much mustard or teryaki sauce - thought it would be too much.  I thought there was too much grated cheese...but that can be easily fixed to suit personal tastes!

I loved this recipe! Everyone in my family loved it! I only used 6T of dijon mustard, and I used 5 strips of real bacon cooked in the microwave and then added it before baking. I also used a block of parmesan cheese, and grated it myself. YUMMY! I am making this again tonight!

This was really good!  I was a little hesitant when I saw the ingredients.... but it was just fine.  I'll definitely make this again when I am short on time.  I also tried it using frozen chicken breast filets since you don't need to thaw them first.

Great Recipe, very tasty!  I used the teriyake sauce from the 'Baked Teriyaki Chicken' recipe
on this site(which is awesome), I used Honey Mustard instead of Dijon and I made fresh bacon instead of canned bacon bits. 
Sooo, I guess it was modified quite a bit, but it was delicious.  
My family(wife and daughter) loved it, this will be a regular menu item at our house.

I love this recipe!  I've been making it for years, and I think the combination of flavors is wonderful.  It also works with shredded parmesan.  Oh, and I'd recommend using a thin teriyaki sauce as opposed to the thicker ones, which tend to caramelize.

This was really yummy. I had to do some substituting for what I had on hand. I mixed up some spicy brown mustard with mayo, then added a teryaki glaze. Mixed all that up, smothered the chicken in it, topped it with fresh bacon crumbles and some mozzarella! It's definitely a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was so easy and delicious!  I followed recommendations from others and added a little mayo to the Dijon. Used center cut bacon cut into bits and shaved Parmesan. . This was very juicy too. Reserve sauce in bottom of dish for spooning over chicken and fresh steamed broccoli on the side. Great week night dish or dish for company!

I just tried this recipe for my wife and I. We really didn't like it. I followed the recipe and it was very easy to do but the taste is just not that good. VERY parmesaney and salty.

This is not to say that others won't like it but just not for us.

Aimee...loved the bold flavors and ease of this recipe! I had an afterthought once it was in the over that the addition of garlic would have enhanced the recipe but after tasting it, garlic was not necessary. I too baked it for less time and at 350 degrees as I used boneless, skinless and wanted to maintain the juiciness of it. I will make this many times.  Thanks for sharing this!

I was skeptical, but my family raved over this tonight!  I did make a few alterations because of what I had on hand...i used 1/2 the mustard called for, then added the same amount in mayo.  Added about 1 tbs brown sugar and a dash of honey...all to cut the strong mustard taste and salt. Mixed all together with the teriyaki and poured over chicken breasts I had cut into strips (to cook quicker and more coverage of the sauce). 350 for about  25 minutes.  Shredded mozzarella and broiled to brown.  They loved it over rice and by itself.

One of the best quick meals I've had in a long time.   I made 2 large bone in chicken breasts which I seasoned for about 30min before cooking.  I replaced the Dijon with 2ounces French's classic yellow mustard, 2 tablespoons mayo and several dashes of hot sauce.  I used Yoshida's original sweet & savory sauce in place of the teriyaki.  It came out amazing!!!  I can't wait to make it again.

Perfect recipe for busy weeknights when you don't have the time or patience to spend forever in the kitchen!  My kids loved it!  The only modification I made was to use 3 oz of Dijon mustard & sprinkle a little garlic powder on top before baking.  I will definitely make this one again!

Made this again tonight. Had to cook at 425 because of another item. I used low sodium teriyaki and real bacon and I added honey to the dijon. My son (a 23 year old and sometime picky eater) said it was the best meal he has had.

Blahhh! I did exactly as recipe required. Dijon, added kokoman teriyaki sause, topped with fresh bacon bits and parmesean. Honestly, the chicken was bland, and outside of tasting bacon...not much else to it.I think chicken needs to be marinated.....it was boring.

such an easy recipe. It's foolproof and delicious. My husband and son loved it and it will be added to my recipe box of great finds. I used turkey bacon I diced and cooked and it was great. No other changes and no extra work is needed which is great when you are busy.

VERY GOOD. My boyfirend and his children really enjoyed it! I didn't follow the amount of ingredients it suggested, I used quite a bit more bacon and not enough teriyaki sauce, but lessoned learned. SO EASY,  will make again!

update: this recipe is one of those recipes you will make again and again, and again!

I thought the cooking time was low so I cooked for 40 minutes. should not have done that, it made it a little dry. I really liked it.  the mustard gave it a nice tang.

This was really good. I marinated the chicken breasts for a few hours in the mustard and teriyaki sauce before baking, and the chicken was very tender. We don't really like parmesan so used mozzarella instead, which was delicious!

My favorite chicken recipe. Although I do modify it slightly by wrapping each chicken breast in thick-sliced bacon.

I love this quick, easy recipe and so does my husband! I usually just put a bit of teriyaki and dijon on the breasts, then swirl together. Then, I add bacon bits and parmesan and bake! Always tasty and delicious- thanks for this great go-to recipe!

This was wonderful. I did omit the teriyaki sauce as it would have been way to salty. I used real bacon that I cooked and crumbled for a much more rich flavor to the dish and it came out great. I would omit the bacon bits and cook the bacon yourself. Otherwise this was great. My husband and I loved it and this will go into my recipe vault for many more dinners to come.

Great recipe! I used a package of chicken thighs and shredded parm instead of grated. I had been afraid that the mustard and teriyaki sauce together would be too salty and overpowering but they weren't-- the flavor was great! I did not have any problems with the sauce sticking to the pan, like some reviews have mentioned. You could use foil to line the pan if you wanted to be extra careful. I served this with rice, and the extra sauce from the chicken flavored the rice nicely. This was really easy and I will definitely make again.

This was very yummy and easy to make. it was a bit salty; I think that could be solved by using a little less teriyaki. I'll try that next time. Thanks for quick and easy recipe, bf loved it.

I made this recipe with the exact ingrediants and it was absolutely delicious. My husband's family came over and they thought it was great. The chicken was juicy and not salty at all. I did use Honey Dijon mustard instead of regular dijon mustard and thought it was fabulous.

This was really good.  I used real bacon instead of bacon bits also.  Next time I will try to line the pan with foil or something, to make clean-up easier.  Maybe more cheese too. Maybe another kind of grated cheese.

I needed something fast to whip up and this did the trick! The only amendments I had to the recipe were that I didn't use Djion mustard, I used Southwestern Spicy mustard. This was really easy and really good.

I don't usually like chicken as my main dish, but this one is so tender and delicious.  I substituted regular mustard for the Dijon, and Worcestershire for the teriyaki, then wrapped the chicken breasts in bacon slices instead of the bits, but it was still fabulous!  It was super easy, enjoyed by all, and I will definitely make it again!

This was okay. It was really salty. I'll try this again and add some sugar to the teriyaki sauce. The bacon bits added to the saltiness, so I'll cut back on those too. Other than that, it was an okay dish.

WOW!!!  So easy and so tasty!  I was a little skeptical, I even panicked since I made it for 4 lbs. of chicken...  Then I thought I put way too much parmesan cheese.  But it was perfect!  I used about 1/2 Dijon mustard and 1/2 Dijonnaise.  After I washed the chicken, I put it in a bowl with the dijon mixture to coat.  Then I put in a pan and topped with the Teriyaki sauce, and crumbled 6 strips of bacon over it, then COVERED with Parmesan cheese (NOT sprinkled, covered!)  I cooked it at 400 for 45 mins.  Served with stuffing.  I had no idea how much gravy/liquid it would produce (it was alot!)... so that went over the stuffing.  YUMMY!  We will definitely have it again and again; next time I will probably combine the Dijon and Teriyaki and have the chicken marinate a bit.  Thanks, Aimee!!

This is the we're on a diet and taking to many hours in college; so no more cream sauces and nothing too labor intensive recipe. Tastes good, not great, but so easy. Oh, another great thing I don't even bother measuring for this. I put however much I want of each thing and it comes out good. I put lots of mustard on mine and just a little on my boyfriend's every time.

Made the 1/2 mustard, 1/2 mayo version, with bits of ham, since we had no bacon.  Serve with something green - the color is pretty bland.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly b/c other reviews said it was really mustardy.  So I did half mayo half mustard and mixed all the items in a seperate bowl.  I put the chicken over wild rice, poured the sauce over all and then baked it.  I would recommend making more sauce than recipe calls for so it soaks into more of the rice.  Hope this helps

Cooked some bacon and just crumbled it into bits. Over-marinated it otherwise would had been probably really good. Suggestion don’t marinate more than say 3 hours otherwise its too salty. So all in all this was cook’s error (mine in particular) that made this meal not as good as I’m sure it could be. Will definitely try again – without the marinating for too long! :o)

I LOVE mustard so this was just awesome to me.  very easy and yummy!!  only difference is i cooked real bacon and just broke it up on top.  You have to be a mustard fan for this, but even if you arent, i think just mixing the mustard with a little mayo will help make the mustard not as strong but as for me...the spicier the better! i will be making this again..soon@

This was very quick and came out good. I used honey dijon mustard and took other review's advice and mixed it with the teriyaki before coating the chicken. I used thin-sliced breasts. After cooking for 25 minutes (covered), I added the bacon and cheddar cheese and cooked (uncovered) for about 5 more minutes. I added chopped green onions for som zip to it. I'll make this again and will definitely make extra sauce for dipping. Thank you for the recipe!

MUST HAVE!!!  My husband and I LOVED this dish...It was excellent, and I mixed 2 ounces mayo with 2 ounces dijon mustard, it was so good. I also severed twice baked potatoes with it, and let me tell you, one of the best meals I make, is this one.

This recipe is great.  I use honey mustard instead of dijon and I use just a little teriyaki sauce.  I also top it off with different kinds of shredded cheese: Mexican, Taco, etc.  The bacon bits really bring out a good flavor, too.

WOW! What a nice change from blah chicken.After reading the reviews, I mixed the teriyaki and mustard together rather than adding them separately. I was also nervous about the mustard being overpowering, so I used 4oz of dijion mustard for 6 chicken breasts, and probably close to 1/2 cup of reduced sodium teriyaki sauce.I would not recomend a normal sodium content teriyaki- the dish was a bit salty (but not too bad) with the reduced sodium teriyaki. I used fresh parmesan and real bacon. The chicken was super moist and delicious- the flavors blended perfectly. My husband and 7 year old all but licked their plates clean!

I made this recipe last night and my husband LOVED it!!  We were tired of the same old chicken so I tried this.  I added mushrooms to it and I had to cook mine much longer.  Maybe my chicken breasts were bigger?  But, the chicken was very moist and even my 18 month old liked it!!

When I first took this out of the oven, I thought that it was going to be my favorite dish. BUT after a few bites, I realized that the many different flavors are SO overwhelming that I could hardly finish a serving. The chicken was very moist, and it certainly was fast and easy. But I don't think it needed bacon. Next time I will make it with lots of mustard and maybe a little teriaki only. OR substitue a pasta sauce with the bacon and cheese... but not everything together.

I love it! I use honey dijon mustard instead of just dijon and I use mozzarella cheese along with parmesan cheese. It's wonderful.

This is a great, quick way to prepare chicken.  I've made it several times and usually marinate it before I put it in the oven.  Teriyaki sauce/marinade works great, which helps to keep the chicken moist and flavorful while it bakes.  I also added italian blended shredded cheese and real bacon to the chicken to give it a little extra flavor.  Yum!

Fairly good recipe.  I wrapped the chicken in bacon rather than use bacon bits.  Would use a different cheese next time. (I'll keep you posted!!)

My family loves this recipe. It is now my husband's favorite dish and he asks me to make it all the time. It's so easy and really good. Don't be scared off by the dijon mustard. I'm not a big fan of mustard, especially dijon mustard, but I love this dish.

I used chicken thighs instead of the breasts.  The meat was flavorful and tender.  We happened to have a guest over that night who now asks when I am cooking that chicken again.

My FAVORITE kind of recipe!  Quick and easy!  It tasted GREAT!  A blend I wouldn't have come up with on my own but loved it.  I used turkey instead of chicken (I usually do) so I cooked it about 5 minutes longer.  I served steamed veggies (with roasted garlic) and angel hair pasta on the side.  The whole thing took no time to prepare.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone in a hurry that doesn't want the same old thing.....

This was good but I would definitely cut the mustard down the next time - it was so tangy I could barely eat it.  My husband agreed it was too tangy, too, but still liked it.  We'll try it again.

This is the best chicken ever!  It could not be easier to make from ingredients always on hand.  Be sure not to use very thick chicken breasts or it will take longer to cook.  My picky children can't get enough of this!

This recipe was GREAT!! I omitted the teriyaki and used good honey mustard.  Baked a little too long, but was still very very good.  Great the next day reheated.  Will definitely make this one again and again!!

This is my husband's favorite chicken dish.  We used Dijon mustard, real bacon bits, and a parm cheese that had bigger chunks in it.  He raves about it. This will satisfy anybody that loves mustard.

This has fast become a family favorite!  The mustard, teriyaki and parmesan cheese create a tasty coating on the chicken.  I've tried it with and without the bacon, and we prefer it without--everything else makes it quite yummy!

I wasn't sure about the combination of ingredients, but decided to try it anyway.  My husband liked it - I did not.  The flavor of the mustard was a bit too strong for my tastes.  My daughter who will eat any chicken also didn't like this one.

This is a very different chicken recipe!  We love it.  Chicken breasts get pretty boring so we love something new!  I have tried to give this recipe to all of my friends but none are sold until I invite them over and make it for them and then they say it's the best chicken ever!

I'm sorry, but this was NOT tasty at all. I kind of thought the mix sounded strange and I should have stuck with my first instinct not to make it. My husband who has NEVER disliked any meal that I have made (or at leastnever told me about it) made an awful face after the first bite and we threw the rest away.

This receipe was great.  I skipped the bacon because all of the other reviews said it was better with real bacon and I wanted this dish to be something quick and I didn't have time to fry up some bacon.  But I loved it and it tasted just as good the next day.  My daughter wasn't overly thrilled with it but she did eat it and she is pretty picky.  The combination sounded quite odd but tasted great together.  I will definitely make this one again!!!

I followed the advice of others and used real bacon and less mustard. I sliced the chicken breasts in half and spread mustard on both sides.  Came out delicious and addicting !!  One son liked the other didn't.

I am sorry to say that this chicken was not good. My husband took 2 bites and asked me if we had any leftovers he could eat instead. He also said it was one of the worst things he has ever tasted, and this is coming from a man who will eat just about anything. Needless to say, I will never make this again.

I thought this chicken was pretty good, but not great. I would make it again with fresh bacon instead of bacon bits, and less mustard.  It was pretty salty.

Delicious!!! I made this last night and my husband continued to compliment me on how good it was. It was also very easy to make. I used a combination of both honey & dijon mustard, and just drizzled over the chicken breast. Also, I baked for the 30 minutes without the cheese, then added cheese afterwards at a lower temperature for about 15 minutes!!!! Will definitely make again!!! and Again!!

This was so quick.  I thought the chicken cooked just the right amount of time!  I think I put a little too much dijon mustard but it was just extra tangy.  I used a glass baking dish and nothing stuck to the bottom!  The chicken was very tasty throughout.  Will definately try this one again.

I didn't have any parmesan cheese and had to use jack cheese, but it was so good!  The chicken cooked just the right amount of time.

Very easy and  yummy. Ran out of time before we had to 
leave for movie so I stuck the prepped dish in the fridge to marinate
 for a couple hours and cooked it when we got back. 
Very juicy and tasty; ate it for breakfast with white rice.

This is a family favorite in our house. The only suggestion I would say is use low sodium teriyaki sauce and low sodium bacon.  But if you in a rush bacon bits are fine too.  We have also substituted the Dijon mustard with honey mustard and it was equally good.  Love how quick it is to make a good meal on the table.  Have made it for multiple guests and they love it!

Not only does this tastes great, but it is so easy! This one makes it into our rotation pretty regularly.  I wait until 5 minutes before the chicken is done and then add the cheese and bacon. Also I grate the cheese with the large grate (instead of Parmesan style) and it seems to work better.

My husband is hard to please and I get tired of the same old recipes (50 years). So I have been branching out on Allrecipes and trying new things. This was a huge success! I made it as stated and we loved it. I  made it in the morning and covered and refrigerated it until we were ready to bake it in the evening. Turned out great. I might have used a bit less mustard,  but it was great! Thanks  Aimee!

This recipe is easy and delicious! It's been in my recipe box for years. My sister asked for the recipe and I came on here to get it for her (I memorized along time ago). I had to leave a review after seeing some other negative reviews. My kids are 4 and 2 and they love it as much as my husband and I do!

This was so quick and simple to make that I kept checking the recipe to make sure that I was not missing a step or any ingredients.

One thing that I did change was that I added seasoning salt to the plain side of the chicken to ensure that it would be flavorful.

I was very pleased with this recipe and will definitely will be making this again.

Very good. Didn't measure anything and just put on the amounts I thought I would like (a sprinkle here, a dash there). My husband and I both cleaned our plates. Had it with corn and salad. Husband suggested that it would taste good in a kaiser roll! Will definitely make again.

WOW! I am a picky eater and this was GREAT! The only thing I did different was use the Hellman's Dijonaise instead of just Dijon mustard. I brushed it on the chicken, both sides lightly. Poured the teriyaki over, sprinkled the bacon and cheese and cooked. Even my 11 year old loved it!

I used skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs with this. I thought it was delicious. The mix of flavors was great and the chicken was incredibly moist. I think the chicken skin may temper the saltiness a bit. I think using high quality parmesan cheese is also important for cutting salt. I used 1/4 4c real grated parmesan and 1/4c Kraft. I also used Trader Joe's Soyaki, Hormel Real Bacon. I sprinkled the cheese over the chicken first which I also think it helped keep the saltiness of bacon from overpowering the dish. The bacon bits just added a nice crunch on top. I didn't measure the mustard so but I think I used more like 2 ounces than 4. Fantastic.

This recipe is great! Made exactly as is, but used chicken tenderloins so reduced the temp to 350 for 30 minutes. My husband said this one is definitely a keeper! Might try the honey mustard next time

Made this last night with everything as specified (but I used honey teriyaki) and my husband and I were very happy with it. I got home, threw it all in a dish and baked. It couldn't be easier! It also requires little measuring - just equal parts mustard and teriyaki, sprinkle on bacon and cheese. I had 5 breasts and they all fit perfectly in a pie dish, which I highly recommend as that created very little waste of extra sauces and all of the chicken was smothered and cooked evenly and everything came out juicy. This will be another go-to recipe on nights when we are limited on time and resources. Thanks!

I did not like this recipe at all.  It tasted far too salty.  I would not make this again or even attempt any sort of substitutions.

This was a quick dinner for my 2 young children. I cut the recipe in half as i only had 2 pieces of chicken. Also i used honey mustard instead of Dijon, and soy sauce in place of teriyaki. Baked for 20 minutes and it smelled wonderful. Chicken was moist but the cheeses slid right off as it seemed the mustard wasnt "cooked". My children asked for more macaroni instead of more chicken as they normally would have asked for chicken. My husband and i also tried a bite and both did not like it at all. Will probably not ake this again.

I mixed the mustard and teriyaki first in a bowl and dipped each piece in the mixture. I also used thin sliced chicken to give each piece a better sauce/chicken ratio. I make fresh bacon and break up over the chicken with fresh grated parmesan cheese. Have made this many times and love it! Thanks!

Instant classic at our house!  Super fast and kids and adults loved it.  We did use real bacon instead of the bits and laid it on top of the chicken.  Also broiled for 5 minutes at the end to make it nice and crispy.

So surprisingly good.  I used the bacon bits like the recipe called for and it was delicious.  I would probably use a lite soy sauce next time because it was a little salty, but really yummy all the same.

This is great I had to improvise for what I had but still turned out great! I used the 4 bnless sknless chicken breasts and instead of Dijon Mustard I used 4 oz of Honey Mustard and since I also didn't have teriyaki sauce I used lite soy sauce but only like about a 1/3 cup of it! It probably doesn't sound good to most people but it turned out great!  I didnt use bacon bits or any cheese. my kids liked it too! although it took about 40 minutes to cook instead of 30! I also used an idea from another review I but some vegetable oil in the bottom of the pan! It was great! YUM!

Great for a quick fix on a busy day! My entire fam loved this meal. I used Ken's Honey Teriyaki and used the real pieces of bacon. I also used Ramano cheese instead of Parm. I did use more then the suggested amount of Mustard & Sauce as well. These were delish!!! I will be making this dish again for sure!

Added some bread crumbs. It was pretty salty. But it was easy and the flavor was good overall. I would recommend lining your baking pan with foil. After soaking for 2 days and 2 cycles in the dishwasher I threw out the pan.

I made this dish with turkey bacon and slightly less teriyaki sauce than called for to reduce sodium. It turned out wonderfully! Next time, I may try marinating the chicken in the Dijon mustard/teriyaki sauce mixture. I loved the mixture as it was something I had never tried before.

This is my new favorite way to cook chicken!  So flavorful...yum!  It's become my "go to" meal when I have left over bacon to use up.  My only change is to use cheddar instead of Parmesan.  Thanks for sharing Aimee!

Delicious!  I didn't have the teriyaki on hand but I really don't think it was missed.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for this quick and tasty recipe.

Loved the flavors. Only problem I had, was my chicken was overcooked and chewy. I'll try with the skinless chicken thighs next time.

I gave this one 5 stars because it's great in every category.  It's quick, easy, one-pan recipe, easy clean up and the taste is to die for.  I didn't think it was too salty and the dijon and teriyaki go together better than I could have imagined!  My chicken was perfectly tender and I had no issues with sauce burning or other problems.

This was tasty, however I used way less mustard than the recipe called for - I just coated each breast in a thin layer. Next time I'll bake in a smaller pan so the sauce doesnt collect on the bottom and burn at the hot temperature in the oven, I think in a smaller dish this wouldn't happen.

Fantabulous! Easy, tasty... oh yea, quick, too. Ended up altering it a bit, I had no teriyaki so subbed soy sauce with a dash of balsamic, and used grated parmesan, romano, asagio mix for cheese topping. yUMm!

Good, but next time I will use a gentler cheese (I'm thinking Mozzarella). It was too much with the parm and mustard, this is a great idea, just needs a little comfort feeling to it. Thanks. UPDATE: cooked this on chicken tighs without cheese or bacon, (cajun instead of dijon mustard) and it was the best chicken I've had in a very long time!

After reading the reviews I decided to use low-sodium bacon and made my own bacon bits.  It worked out very well.  It was quite tasty and moist.

My family is usually not big on chicken, but this one received rave reviews from all 4 of my guys! I'm always happy when I find a recipe that can please two 5 year olds, a 10 year old, and a 32 year old. I had to use grated cheese because it was all I had on hand, and I do think that fresh would have been better. I also used thin sliced chicken which turned out to be a great choice. Excellent!

My husband loved this and he is so picky.  He actually asked me to make it again and he doesn't like chicken.  I changed the recipe a little b/c I didn't have teryaki sauce. I used italian dressing instead and it came out great.  I did everything else by the recipe.  Very easy.  Thanks.

Wondeful! I've made this a LOT and really like it the way it's written, but also with variations. Sometimes, time permitting, I marinate the breasts overnight in teriyaki mixed with brown sugar, then coat with the mustard, top with mozzarella and bacon bits and bake. Another good variation is to coat with mustard, wrap with bacon strips, pour on teriyaki, top with cheese then bake. Any way you assemble it, it's great! Even my chicken-hating husband likes this one, so I don't have to make seperate meals like usual when I want chicken! Thanks so much for a "keeper" recipe!

I made this last night - it was wonderful ! I used the dijonnaise as recommended and I would recommend it to others too. The chicken had a lot of flavor and it was very moist. I used a little more teriyaki and cheese than the recipe called for and I added a little colby blend cheese - this will be a household regular!

This recipe is very easy, forgiving, and tasty!  The ingredients are staples in my fridge, which makes this a part of our normal dinner rotation. I made this recipe without measuring anything. I salt and peppered the chicken, then rubbed a dollop of Dijon mustard on each breast.  I poured some soy sauce over the top, probably about 1/4 cup on three breasts.  rumbled up some pre-cooked Oscar Meyer bacon, and added the fresh grated Parmesan.  It was so fast and simple, and came out terrific.

This was pretty good. I liked the mustard teriyaki combination. I wrapped the bacon around the chicken instead of frying it for on top. If I make it again I will crumble it on top. The bacon was kind of soggy. Otherwise a good way to dress up plain chicken.

So easy, and I always have the ingredients on hand! The whole family loved this. I didn't use the whole 4 oz of mustard, just brushed a light coating over each piece. Didn't measure the teriyaki, just drizzled Yoshidas over each piece. Snipped bits of the pre-cooked bacon on top and baked as directed. Put the Parmesan on last 10 minutes. Used thighs and breasts.Really good flavor - I might use more mustard next time, will definitely make again!

This recipe was sooo simple and delicious!  We didn't have teriyaki sauce at home so we used Yoshida Sauce instead.  We added just a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese to cut back on the saltiness that the other reviewers mentioned.  We also omitted the bacon bits.  It was DELICIOUS with the Dijon mustard and Yoshida sauce!  We'll definitely make this dish again and again.

The chicken came out nice and moist, but the flavor of the mustard overwhelmed everything else and I'm not a huge fan of that kind of mustard. If I make it again I would really cut down on the amount of mustard used.

This was great. I used tenders instead and it worked fine. I think next time I wont use quite as much mustard or terayaki. Didnt have any bacon bits so we cooked some up and crumbled them.. I think the bacon was actually the saltiest part and probably not needed. I served it with some rice pilaf and it was perfect.

I don't know that there is an easier dish to make. I have recently become a stay at home mom of 2 & have been trying SEVERAL new recipes & this is the first recipe that said it would take 5 minutes & it really did. I poured 1/2 cup of Dijon Mustard & 1/2 cup of Mayo in a glass measuring cup, stirred together then poured that over my chicken.  I also pierced my chicken with a sharp knife to allow the sauce to seep. I didn't measure my teriyaki sauce, I just drizzled it over the top of the chicken so it was not too salty. Between the taste & simplicity this will definately be made in our house again. Thanks a million, Aimee!

Excellent!!!  I made this for my husband and one of his friends and they both were praising me.  I used half mustard and half Miracle Whip at others suggestion and thought it was perfect.  It was not salty in the slightest.  I used Lawry's Teriyaki sauce, Miracle Whip, Grey Pupon, Hormel Bacon bits (the real kind), and freshly grated Kraft Parm cheese (added 10 minutes before it was done baking).  If you think it's salty, try those brands.  The chicken breasts I used were kind of thick so I think next time I will put some of the sauce on the bottom of the breasts also to add some flavor.  5 HUGE stars.  THANK YOU AIMEE!

Very good!  i took the adivce of some other reviews and used 1/2 dijon mustard and 1/2 miracle whip.  It turned out great!  Although I can see how it would be a little too mustard-y if I hadn't used half mayo.  The mixture of the mayo, mustard, and teriyaki, mixed with the bacon bits (I used real bacon bits, not those crunchy kind) was fabulous.  And SO easy!!

Very nice and delicious, i made this for my self and used one breast. I did not need 1 ounce of dijon or all that sauce and parm to cover the breast nicely, however. This taste just incredible such a simple recipie but the taste is quality.

I made this tonight, and though I followed other's comments and did it half mayo, half mustard, it was still too mustardy for me. However, I think I used too much of the mix for the amount of chicken I used, and were I to just use less it wouldn't be so strong. But I do love the bacon/parmesan combo and think I'll try it again with honey mustard and less teriyaki so it's not too sweet.

I was really dissapointed with this one. I think I may have put too much butter in the pan initially to coat the chicken which created a not so tasty flavor for some reason. I just thought it was too much salty/creamy flavor. I wouldn't make this again.

This was, interesting.  I wouldn't make it again, but it was really easy.  I think it was the flavor of the teriyaki sauce and mustard that didn't go together very well to me.

This was delicious!  The only change I made was that I used turkey bacon and a reduced sodium teriyaki sauce.  It was great and my family loved it.  I will definatly add this one to my list of frequently made meals.  Thanks for sharing it with us Aimee.

Good, but would be much better if you only used 1/2 - 2/3 the Dijon recommended. It tasted a bit strong.

Boy, this dish was simple and excellent. I sprinkled just a pinch of red pepper flakes on it, and it must have baked into it, because it was surprisingly spicy. I would recommend this dish to anyone who has forty minutes to fire it up. The flavors blend to perfection.

I tried this the other night for 2 picky kids and a picky boyfriend. I only made one piece for each because I didnt want left overs if it was bad. Surprisingly, the random mix of ingredients went well together and everyone was asking if there was more! It was pretty good. I mixed the honey dijon and the teriyaki sauce together also. Chicken was VERY moist and not too salty like some other reviews.

Quick and Easy and very tasty. We substituted a 'Honey' Dijon Marindade and it made it that much better.

I made this tonight for my family, as well. I took everyone's advice and used a low sodium marinade. I only had 3 chicken breast so I mixed 1/2 cup of marinade with 1/4 cup dijon throughly then coated the chicken. I also used crisp fresh bacon instead of bacon bits and freshly grated parmasan. I layered the chicken as directed, but wrapped each individual breast in its own piece of foil to keep the parmasan from overcooking. Combined with some buttered rice and steamed veggies - it made a wonderful (out of the oridinary) supper. Thanks for the recipe Aimee.

I used Teriyaki sauce/marinade (thicker) and Grey Poupon Country Style Dijon mustard.  I agree with others, it is a bit salty.  Tip: to keep fresh parmasean.  I have a parmasean cheese grater that I place a chunk of cheese into the "wheel" to grate the cheese right on top of the dish.  In order to save from having to clean it every time, I store the whole thing in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.  That way, all I have to do is pull out the plastic bag, grater and cheese, and use on my dish, return to bag and refrigerator.  When the chunk stored in the grater runs out, usually by the 10th meal, I then wash it out and return to refrigerator with a new chunk of high quality parmesean.  Saves alot of clean up time and prep time.

Loved it, I followed the recipe except I wrapped in foil and did not turn over.  It took me about 40-50 minutes to cook but the meat was so tender and juicy.  The juices of the chicken  left it then returned the parmesan gives a nice salty taste against the bacon.  Best ever!! It's like i am a restaurant chef ;)

Good! Fast and easy. I would make it again but probably try it with real bacon and fresh grated parmesan cheese but this would make it longer to prepare.

I've been making this for a few years now... It is a family favorite--so much so that we've named it "Josh's" chicken, after our 3rd boy because he loves it so much! (I just have to be careful not to over-do it on the dijon mustard)

I didn't like it at all.  It was really salty and the bottom of the chicken had the teriyaki flavor while the top had the mustard flavor.  My husband liked it.  I thought it was just too weird and salty.  Maybe combine the mustard and t. sauce?

Great, quick recipe!  I left out bacon bits (didn't have them) and it was great.  Husband and son loved it and neither one are big "mustard" fans.  This is a keeper!

The combination of flavors was tasty, but we all agreed that it was extremely salty!  I would definitely use less sauce next time and try to use low sodium teriyaki sauce where available (it's not available here in DK).

I decided to try this because it was quick and easy with simple ingredients. I have a newborn baby at home and I barely have time to prepare meals.  This one seemed easy enough, so we tried it.  My husband and I were both really surprised at how good it was.  I didn't use bacon bits - not necessary.  The ingredients seem like a strange combination, but this really is good.

I thought this tasted great, maybe too much mustard though.  I used diced ham instead of the bacon, because I didn't have it, turned out good.  Mine took a little longer to cook, maybe breasts were larger?

I went traditional the first time, and now just cover both sides with mustard then teriyaki sauce.  It's a great hit with the family, and extended.  Friends who aren't "chicken" lovers, love it because it doesn't taste like the ordinary chicken we've gotten use to.

This was hard for me to rate.  I liked this alot and would have rated this a 5 star but half of my family didn't like it and wouldn't eat it.  I follwed the recipe and it reheated well for lunch the next day.  If this recipe sounds good to you I would suggest giving it a try.

This was pretty good. I eyeballed the ingredients and probably ended up using more of the tarragon and cheese than what was called for, and less of the terryaki. I also added some colby jack cheese. Tasted very good, especially considering how easy it was to make!

I have mixed emotions on this recipe:  5 Stars for how easy it was to make and for having five simple ingredients.  3 Stars for taste.  My darling husband absolutely loved the sauce, while I was just kind of ho hum about it.  I couldn't taste the mustard at all and I used a lot of it.  It was a touch too salty for my taste with all the teriyaki, bacon and parmesan cheese.  But my husband thought the sauce was sweet.  So I'll compromise and give it a 4 star review.

I was a bit apprehensive in trying this recipe after reading some of the reviews, but I decided to give it a go. I changed the dijon mustard for honey mustard and used the teriyaki marinade sauce as it is a little thicker. I also used fresh bacon bits and included a little sprinkle of mozzarella cheese on top with the parmesan. My family loved it. I served it with a tossed salad and jacket potato's with sour cream. Yummy!

I love this recipe!! I make it all the time for my family and it is really easy to make. Even makes a great appetizer if you cut the chiken into strips, add your dijon and teriyaki sause, wrap a piece of bacon around it and sprinkle with cheese. It cuts the cooking time down to like 15-20 minutes.

This recipe was not only quick but delicious.  I made a few substitutions.  I did not use as much terryaki sauce.  I just splashed it over the chicken. I used regular bacon but removed it before I ate it. (I just used it for extra flavor).  Instead of parmesan I used mozzerella. I loved this recipe and will continue to use it.

This was the first meal I ever cooked by myself and I'm glad it turned out so well.  The flavors work well together and it was bursting with juiciness and flavor.  I had a hard time finding a respectable side for it so I made some asian noondles and that went along great with it.

Excellent tasting chicken recipe that draws on French and Asian flavors.  At first, I thought this combination might not make for that tasty of a dish.  But the review was overwhelmingly positive.  The chicken's tenderness balances with the salty content of the baconbits, teriaki, and so forth.  This is now one of our staple dishes.  Thank you!  It was a hit!  Both members of the family gave it a perfect 10.

I didn't measure the ingredients and probably used a little less bacon bits and cheese than what it called for.  I thought this was a fantastic combination of ingredients, my husband and son gave it 4 stars.
Easy and delicious!

Pretty good.  I didn't think it was too salty, as some of the others did.  The ingredients go well together.  It came out very moist and tender.  And it was very easy and fast to prepare, which is always a plus!

Yes-it is strange but very good.  I have been making this for a while and I dont find it too salty.  I make it as-is and love it.  No alteration needed.

After reading the reviews, I was skeptical.  I was planning to use 1/2 honey, 1/2 dijon as suggested, but only had about half of 1/4c of Dijon, so I just added extra honey.  We really enjoyed it!  I simply could not believe how little prep work this took.  We wouldn't say it was the best chicken EVER, but it will certainly be added to the rotation!!

After reading many reviews about the saltiness of the dish, I decided to change things around a bit.  First, I seared the chicken in 2 tbs olive oil for 1 min per side.  I made a mustard mixture consisting of 2 tbs mayo and 2 tbs dijon mustard, which I spread over the chicken after placing them in a baking dish.  I then sprinkled the bacon bits and parm cheese over it and baked as per the original recipie.  I think this will cut down on the saltiness quite a bit, my family did not find it too salty at all.  A good idea for a recipie, but with the bacon bits, parm cheese AND teriaki sauce, it's just way too many salty foods combined.

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  Used a bit too much Dijon, won't make that mistake again.  Will make this dish again, and it was wonderful as leftovers on a salad.

Aimee, loved it. quick, easy and delicious. made it for my girlfriend who is the real cook and she thought it quite tasty as well. to all the nay-sayers, perhaps they used an inappropriate mustard, which i could imagine turning this dish awkward.

We did not like this recipe.  It was WAY too salty.  Even my husband who doesn't mind a lot of salt thought it was terrible.  I took one bite and couldn't eat any more.  After scraping all the toppings off we were able to at least save the chicken, but when my husband can't even choke it down, it has to be bad.

I feel i am being generous when i give this 2 stars because as it turned out my hubby and i were the only ones in the dinner party we had that absolutely had to have PB&J for dinner instead. I just didnt care for it. But to be fair it could have been something i did although i dont think so. I always read the ratingsand at least for me, my hubby said the mustard smell alone turned him off...but the guests said it was "really good" but i honestly think they were being nice as they didnt have (or ask for) seconds (and they are all BIG eaters). BUT OH WELL thats the chance you take when you try something new...BTW it took like 3 times longer to cook (i used thighs that were completely thawed)however it was fast to prepare as it said but i started cooking at 6pm and was still waiting at almost 10pm. My 4 yr old who loves chicken wouldnt even eat it the next day for lunch the leftovers went in the trash!:(

My fiance said the more he ate this, the more he liked it, and asked that I make this again.  I could take it or leave it, but have to say this was really worth a try!  If there is one thing I've learned from this site, it's that we all have our own individual tastes, and reviews should not be taken too much to heart.  I used bone-in thighs, as that's what I had thawed, and adjusted cooking time accordingly. Also, fried real bacon and crumbled.  It is a very easy dish to make, and it will probably be made again for him.  Thanks for sharing!

We really liked the flavor of this one, but I think I might omit the mustard or use just a TINY bit and add some honey next time.  Overall, an interesting mix of flavors that was actually pretty good!

This was great! Also wonderful for those that are watching carbs (only 6.6 carbs per serving). I think I might have used too many bacon bits though because the bacon was a little overpowering but the family loved it. Another quicky variation is just the chicken, bacon bits and a jar of the reduced fat alfredo sauce (Ragu brand)and parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. That's quite yummy too!

This chicken was fantastic!  I also cut down on the dijon mustard and added extra bacon bits. I loved how quick it was, it made for a perfect workday supper.  While it was baking I could make a salad and fix a vegetable and supper was ready!  I'm glad I tried this one!

Tried this one for the first time tonight.  Loved how quick and easy it was.  It literally took me a few minutes to get it in my oven.  Only thing I would change next time is to cut down on the mustard, as others have mentioned.

Not bad!! My husband really liked it. I thought it was pretty good too. But do like so many other people suggested... cut back a bit on the mustard so it doesnt over-power the dish. I lightly greased the bottom of the dish so the sauce wouldnt burn or stick to it.

I've made this recipe twice before and decided to have it tonight (along with Fabulous Spinach Salad a la allrecipes.com).  I love the tangy flavor of the sauce combined with the saltiness of the bacon and cheese.  Like others, I used real bacon which I fried crisp then chopped into bits.  This is a delicious meal that is simple to make and easy on the budget.
UPDATE:  I made this again tonight.  I used a couple slices of pepper bacon to kick it up a bit.  I was shocked to find out I had NO teriyaki sauce but had a balsamic vinaigrette in the fridge, so I used that instead.  It was a complete WIN!  I love this recipe!

This was really easy to make, which is always a bonus for me.  I think next time I'll marinate the chicken in the sauce to make it taste stronger.  The chicken was nice and juicy too.  I'll definitely make this again!

I decided to try this recipe but came home only to find I had sukiyai sauce, honey mustard, and no bacon bits.  I thought I was doomed!  I took a chance, used the honey mustard and the sukiyaki sauce.  It turned out great!  The honey made the chicken a little bit sweeter.  I can only imagine how yummy this would have been if I had the right ingredients.  I also removed the chicken skin.  I'd definitely make it again.

extremely salt!  dont use bacon bits!  use regular cooked bacon.  i uses the grainy dijon mustard (grey poupon) and kikoman teriyaki sauce/marinade.  next time i will use cooked bacon.  my picky son ate it though.  it's very ez and fast.  i used tenderloins instead of breasts and they were done perfectly in 30 minutes.

Although this recipe was extremely easy to make, I found it too salty for my taste.  Instead of cooking the bacon I used already prepared real bacon bits that you can find in the grocery store.  This cut down on the cooking time tremendously.  My husband did like this dish and I will try it again but this time I might try reduced salt/sodium bacon.

Both my adult kids and I agree it was great and a real keeper!! We are going to try it with honey mustard. We agree it's a bit salty but that's the teriyaki and what it is. Thanks for the recipe.

Thanks for this recipe.  I have improvised on it for months, it's easy and I never get any complaints no matter what the sauce/cheese combo is.  The chicken is always perfectly cooked.

Yum!  I'm new to cooking, so I love how easy this is to make.  I also used honey teriyaki barbeque sauce instead of the much thinner plain teriyaki, and that I like even better.

I thought this recipe was really TASTEY! I found some Garlic teryaiki (sp?) sauce. EXTREMELY GOOD! Left off the honey mustard (the kind i bought was too spicy) It would be sooooo much better if the chicken was cut into strips or small peices to marinate in the sauce.

I had this last night and for even more flavor I poked small holes in the chicken breasts and also made a few tiny slits so that the sauce could drain down into it. After that I wrapped bacon around it like another reviewer spoke about and then added the mustard. I then let it marinate in the fridge for 5-6 hours and the flavor from taking the time to marinate it and also the soaking of the sauce was excellent!

Great recipe!  I topped ours with a few sliced, sauteed mushrooms after it was done baking.  YUMMY!  My teenager loved it but my picky 10 year old turned his nose up to it (he doesn't like mustard) and my husband raved over it.  Think I'll try a different cheese for a little different flavor.  Thanks for a great quick option to dinner!

The family loved this recipe.  I used real bacon bits and a mixture of shredded Parmesan 
and Mozzarella cheese.  The way the cheese melted w/the bacon on top it looked like I was
cooking all day!

This recipe has been a lifesaver.  I made this dish for the pickiest eaters I have ever known, and they loved it... they even went back for seconds and demanded the recipe!

This tasted horrible.  I didn't put any bacon on it, but I can't imagine that would've helped.

I left my husband to do the cooking tonight, and HE found this recipe.  He thought it was great, and easy.  I thought it was a too salty for my taste, but it was very moist and tender.  My hubby switched the mustard for what we had in the house, honey mustard!  The sauce part was so tasty.  We will definitly make it again.

Yuck.  I will not be making this again.  This dish was so salty I could hardly stand it.  My husband ate it.  He didn't think it was bad as I did.  We will not be trying it a second time.

I switched from the too, too strong Dijon mustard to a deli mustard and everyone agreed it was a much better dish.

What a great recipe! I was a little nervous but all the different flavors but,everyone loved it, including a four and six year old. The only thing I did different was fry my own bacon, I'm not a fan of bacon bits. But, the chicken was juicy and so flavorful. This is now a regular, thanks!

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. For some reason, the chicken was not cooked thoroughly. It took quite a bit longer than I had planned for. Also,the taste was too much to deal with.

this was very easy and quick to fix. i did use the bacon bits and my husband said it was
a bit salty. i really didnt think that would come from him since he's not very picky.
my 5 1/2 yr old son loved it and ate a whole chicken breast, my 3 1/2 yr old 
daughter didnt like it much, i thought it was very moist and tender and didnt mind
it too much, my husband did eat it but we did end up throwing out the small 
leftover piece. all in all a very good try and i'll likely try it again with a few modifications! thanks!

Delicious! I made this recipe a little more complicated by using fresh bacon instead of bacon bits (I don't like them) but it was worth it! I also didn't measure the mustard and used a bit too much. My husband and 3 year old liked it. My compliments to Aimee and thanks for sharing this recipe. By the way, does anyone know how to submit a recipe?

Right away, I knew I would like the flavor combinations. I did alter a few things, like I marinated in teriyake sauce overnight and I did not put too much mustard on and I mixed parmesan with mozzarella. I baked at lower temperature for a little longer. Will make this again.

Bleck!  I will definitely NOT make this recipe again.  Neither my husband or I enjoyed this chicken.  The ingredients just do not compliment each other at all.  Also, it was very very salty.  We had to throw the last chicken breast out because noone wanted to eat it.

This recipe is GREAT!  We had dinner guests last night, I searched for a quick and easy recipe, this one sounded pretty good so I tried it. I used real bacon bits and Mozzarella cheese (spread during the last 10 minutes of cook time). Everyone loved it.  I will make it again.

This is excellent!!  I would have never thought of putting these ingredients together but it was very tasty.  I didn't measure the mustard and teriyaki sauce--just spread it on and I used mozarella cheese like a lot of the other reviewers suggested (added it about 20 minutes into the baking time).  And remember to spray your baking dish with Pam before making.  Hubby and teens loved it, too!!

Very good! Used boneless, skinless chicken thigh's to be more econimical for weekday dinners. Kids loved it!!! Read reviews prior to making.  Thinly brushed on Dijon, used fresh bacon and sprayed pan with cooking spray to avoid sticking.  Served with basmanti rice and stir fried vegetables.  Will definately make again!

This was soooooo good.  I saw it and knew I would love it.  It's so easy, really fast to make and on top of it, low in fat.  Great if you want to eat late but don't want to put on the late night pounds.

This was a scrumptious tasty recipe!  We will make it again and again!  I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this, unless they didn't like teriyaki.  Now teriyaki does have a strong ginger flavor to it, so if you don't like ginger, I wouldn't guggest this recipe.  My husband and I followed other reviewers advice and used real bacon.  I bet that would be much better than bacon bits.  We used turkey bacon, and that was good.

Ok, so I'm a college student.  So I've never attempted to really *cook* a meal before (frozen and rice-a-roni type stuff don't count).  Well, I gotta say, this reciped was extremely easy, quick, and delicious!  And difficult to screw up.  Trust me, I would have found a way to screw it up if I could.

Excellent dish! Hubby really loved it.  Said it almost had a pinapple taste to it at first.  Things I did different: I brushed the mustard onto both sides, I used Kikkomans terriaki glaze, used real bacon bits(5 slices) and used shredded mozerella cheese.

This recipe was ok, a nice blend of flavors.  The teriyaki sauce just burned in the bottom of the pan.  I think next time I would marinate it in the teriyaki for at least half an hour to get the flavor soaked in.  Husband liked it.

My husband and 3 year old LOVED this. I'm not big on mustard, so maybe next time I will use a little less. It was excellent though, my husband would have given it 5 stars!

I used too much mustard, so it had a strong Dijon taste. But I definitely see the potential for the recipe and will try it again...with less mustard, maybe 1/2 TBS per breast. At the end I added a bit of brown sugar to offset the mustard and it helped.

Really tasty!  The ingredients were very different but the chicken came out moist and delicious.  My youngest even ate a whole chicken breast (she usually just eats 1/2 of one).  I used prepared honey-mustard which she loves anyway.

My kids did not like this recipe at all. My daughter thinks it was tasted to much like bacon. I would suggest not using so much of the bacon bits.

The adults in my family really enjoyed it.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. I love it because its so easy to prepare,(I'm the only one in my family who cares about ease of preparation), and we all love the flavor. when I was reading it for the first time, I was a little unsure about whether or not to try it, the combination of ingredients seemed unusual. But, I decided to take that walk on the wild side, & I am very happy I did. I would like to compliment the creator of this recipe. It is very tasty, and has quickly become a family favorite. I have passed it on to friends & co workers as well, & I haven't heard a single complaint. Thank you, Val.

This was so good!!  Even as a leftover I actually think it tasted better.  My husband couldn't get enough and it was so easy to make.  I actually used fried bacon which I thought made the receipe taste very yummy. :)

This had a very strong taste to it that was a little off-putting.  I might ease up on the teriayki sauce next time - also the sauce burned in the pan.

The flavor of the chicken was great, my daughter who will not eat anything loved it.  It was so easy to fix, this will be a favorite in our home for a long time to come.

This was pretty good!  I used bacon chips instead of  bacon bits and cooked it on my pellet grill instead of the oven so it had a different look to it. Still had a great taste!

I went a little wild with this one. I used Creole mustard instead of Dijon. I used Yoshida's sauce instead of teriyaki. I used twice as many bacon bits and cheese (shredded, not grated) as it called for. I also cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking. So, yeah, a loose interpretation of the recipe, but I liked it!

The ingredient list was a little unusual but we really liked this. I used boneless, skinless thighs, and honey mustard, and kept the rest of the ingredients the same as called for. I found the cooking time to be right on resulting in juicy, flavourful chicken.

Everything worked except the teriyaki sauce made it very salty.  Will make again without teriyaki and substitute mayo for the mustard.

I pretty much followed the recipe w/out measuring anything. i did slather the bottom of the pan with some country dijon then added the breasts and slathered them. Poured over the teriyaki and sprinkled a good bit of parmesan. Cooked it just as instructed and it was delicious! Very moist. Will definitely be making it again. Super quick and easy.

Way too much teriyaki could of used 1/8 cup or less, very strong taste. Other than that it was fine, will make again.

This is a great, easy recipe. I love the cheese/bacon/mustard combo! My two boys, ages 6 and 10, who can be very picky ate it up too! I marinated my chicken first, with lime, garlic, vinegar/oil overnight. I find if I don't marinate, the chicken is never as good. I also used partially cooked bacon strips, vs the bacon bits. I broiled on low for a few minutes before serving so the bacon was crispy, along with the cheese, and it was yummy! It can be very salty, so choose your teriyaki sauce wisely!

This is a great family dish! I pounded out the chic, marinated it in the teriyaki w/ dash of tabasco, and black pepper about 20-30 min. Smothered  a mustard mayo combo, then topped it with sliced pre-cooked bacon about 30 min at 350. Then topped it with cheddar and baked it a bit more. Works great!

I made this for my wife and we both really liked the way it turned out. The store was out of Dijon mustard so I used Honey Dijon instead. To make it more spicy, I added some Sriracha sauce and mixed it with the Teriyaki sauce. I will definitely make this from time to time.

Well my husband loved it.  I thought is was ok. I tasted too much mustard.  I used honey mustard as someone else had suggested to cut out the mustard taste a bit.  I think I'll try it again since my husband enjoyed it so much but try different mustard options.

very quick and easy recipe.  It was good, but a little too much Dijon flavor for our liking.  Will make again, just use a little less Dijon next time

I love this dish!  We use honey mustard instead of dijon and we use the three cheese type of parmesan cheese, the other thing is I used turkey bacon, it is a great resipe and very easy!  I do add about a tablespoon of water just in case it sticks, but I also use a glass dish :)

Good! Used low sodium teriyaki and low sodium bacon. Would have been too salty otherwise.

This was simple and delicious! I did as a few others suggested: I combined half dijon mustard with half mayonnaise as opposed to just plain dijon. I used the packaged bacon crumbles and I also baked it at 350 for 1 hour. I will make this often!

This is now a staple meal at our house.  While the ingredient combination looked weird to me, the outcome is terrific.  Incredibly moist chicken, and so very easy to make.

This recipe was average - definitely don't be afraid to slather the chicken with the dijon, you'll lose quite a bit of the taste in the cooking.

I made this recipe tonight and my family absolutely loved it. I cut the mustard in half as my kids (11,9,and 6) aren't big on it. I also cut the bacon bits down a bit.

This was awesome. My husband and I loved it. We weren't sure of the combination of sauces but it turned out great. We used what we had so we used provolone cheese and didn't put the bacon bits on it.

My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I didn't have dijon so I mixed mayo and mustard with some white vinegar. I cooked it at 350 because I had a cauliflower casserole going at the same time. It was in almost 50 minutes and that was probably 5-10 minutes too long.

Quick and easy with great flavor! The Dijon was a little strong for my kids so I might mix with a little sour cream to cut the bite of the Dijon.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe since my husband's not a huge dijon mustard fan, but I made it last night for dinner anyway because I was short on time. It was amazing! We both LOVED it! I'm a little jealous because he took the leftovers to work for lunch today... I will definitely be making this again!

Love this recipe! I'm a beginner cook and this is the second time I made it. I actually seasoned my chicken with Lawrys, Pepper, & a little MSG before proceeding. My 12 year old niece stood over me as I prepared the chicken and scrunched her nose at very ingredient. When it was finished I had to beg her to try it and when she did a smile immedietly covered her face. I had won her over (just as I knew I would LOL)

This was interesting...I followed the recipe exactly, except I just glazed the chicken with the Dijon, as to not get too much mustard flavor.  I didn't think it was salty, and it was decently tasting.  However, the sauce did stick to the bottom of the pan.  I baked this for thirty minutes and it was cooked at the end of the time.  I used reduced fat Parmesan and turkey bacon bits, served with mac & cheese.  I will likely make this again.

I thought this sounded like it would be a good recipe, but no one in our family liked it at all.  It did turn out very moist and juicy though. The recipe may have worked better with way less dijon, as it really overpowered the flavors.

This was really good! I'm a novice cook, and can mess things up pretty easily.  I even accidentally had four WHOLE chicken breasts instead of halves.  I just doubled the ingredients and cook it for almost twice as long.  I also removed the bacon bits to cut some calories.  It was great! Though be careful it not overdoing the mustard.  I should have used the doubled amount of 8 oz, but did the whole bottle of 12 oz.  It was really strong, though definitely tasty.

This was pretty good. The sweet taste plus the salty taste was good, but I think next time I will leave out the mustard. I used real bacon instead of bacon bits. I made it with mashed red potatos and green beans.

Easy, very tasty, and the smell is beautiful. I didn't have teriaki sauce, used soy sauce instead, and didn't have bacon bits either, so I used bits of raw, frozen bacon. Still came out great. I cooke it ahead of time because I knew I wouldn't have time to cook lunch the following day, so it marinated in its own juice overnight, and I'm guessing it made it even tastier. I will definitely make it again, maybe even using the original ingredients next time.

This was an absolute hit with the entire family. All of my kids, (10 to 3) loved this. I didn`t have to beg them to finish their dinner for once. I`m sure glad I found this recipe.

This was so quick to make and very yummy...my 2 year old inhaled it!  I used Newman's Own Honey Mustard instead of Djion, sprinkled powdered parmesean on it instead of grated, and melted cheddar cheese over the top when it was done!  Melts in your mouth!

My husband and I really enjoyed this chicken dish! Thinking that the Dijon mustard might have a little too much "tang," I added 1 1/2 tsp of brown sugar and it was delicious!! Neither of us found it too salty at all. I served it with broccoli and white rice and will definetly be making it again. Thanks Aimee!

The ingredients seemed like a weird combination, but this was surprisingly good and easy!  I made it with hot teriyaki for a kick.

The combination of teriyaky, mustard, parmesean and bacon seemed a little odd, and I don't even like mustard, but I was pleasantly surprised that this recipe tasted really good.

I thought this was ok... 

the ingredients didn't really work well together imo... the mustard was too powerful, the teriyaki sauce was nonexistent, and the cheese just fell off the top in a big crispy pile. Kinda like eating a mustard hot dog without the hot dog...

Per other reviews about the saltiness, I used dijonaise and omitted the teriyaki all together.  With these adjustments I loved it.  Will make it often.

Good, quick, easy recipe. Used less mustard than called for. Just enough to lightly cover the chicken breasts. Definitely will make again!

Way too salty, and this is coming from someone who loves salty things to snack on!  Also the grated parmesean just seemed have a funky texture to me.  I think it would have been better with the shredded or about a 3rd of what was asked for. I suppose a bit of time under a broiler to firm it up a bit may help as well.  I think it has potential just needs work.

We loved this recipe! The flavors blended together well and it is so easy to throw together. I'd never used teriyaki sauce before but my DH and 4 yr old both loved it! I will be making this again and again. Thanks!

I was looking for something different to try chicken breasts and came across this recipe.  At first I was skeptical with the list of ingredients, but after reading all of the great comments I thought I’d give it a try – I’m glad I did.  The only thing you really need to measure is the teriyaki, but the rest is really to taste.  Enough mustard to coat, as much or little bacon as you like and a sprinkle of cheese!  Don’t add salt to the chicken; the teriyaki and parm have plenty.  Thanks for the quick and tasty recipe!

I thought the combination of ingredients was unusal enough that I had to try it!  It was very easy and very good. Have some crusty bread on hand to 'sop' up the sauce.

This recipe kept the chicken moist, however next time I will use honey mustard instead of dijon, it could use a hint of sweet to balance out the saltiness.

Got a rave review from the DH on this one...he usually only nods or says it's "alright", and tonight he said he really liked this! I did substitute a few things - honey dijon for the plan dijon, and colby cheddar for the parmesan. It was very flavorful. I will definitely make it again, quick and easy!

This was easy, but didn't appeal to my son or myself. Spreading the mustard as directed made it way too mustardy for both of us. May have been better to mix everything together and poured over the chicken before baking to blend flavors more. Chicken was very moist though!

This was a great and easy meal.  I was skeptical because I don't like teriyaki or Dijon mustard, but the combination of the two was great!  I used bone in chicken breast and removed the skin, since it was all I had. This one will go into our dinner circulation.

Delicious.  Will use less teriyaki next time, as I threw most of it away.  Also, would put cheese on in the last 5 minutes only.  Will be making this one again.

The title says it all!  I used this recipe at the beach this year when we were vacationing with family and friends.  Each couple (or family) was responsible for cooking dinner one night during the vacation.  This recipe was so inexpensive to make and took such little time to prepare.  Everyone loved it and said it was the best dinner of the week!

I love this chicken!! It is easily my favorite "quick chicken" recipe. I usually do up a bunch of bacon on the weekend and it becomes a quick chicken dish for the middle of the week. My sister tried it and loves it too.

My family loved this recipe. I did not have any bacon bits so I cut up some Canadian bacon and sprinkled that on top.  The bacon was nice and crispy and the chicken was so flavorful-And best of all quick and easy! I served it with some corn on the cob and rice pilaf.

I made this tonight, and it was delicious! Very skeptical at first because I don't like mustard, so I used a honey Dijon mustard, and skipped the bacon bits for fear that it might be too salty. Made with Balsamic roasted red potatoes on this site and was great!

Wonderful recipe. I didn't have much in the kitchen so this is perfect. I threw in some red potatoes with the chicken and made sure they were coated. A nice addition I must say. Thank you very much for a great meal!

The only thing I can say about this recipe was the chicken was moist. Way to salty even after making adjustments to the recipe. Taking the advice of the other reviewers I used a sweeter mustard and a low salt teriaki, and no bacon. I will not be making this again.

i love this recipe! it is too easy. i usually mix all the ingredients together in a bowl, dice the chicken and mix it all together rather than layering everything. i feel that the chicken gets coated better this way.

This was so quick and easy. I will make this again. My son has already asked for it again, and I just made it last week. I hope when I am having to come up with origianl ideas from just what I have around the house that my recipe will be as great as this...

SUPER easy to make and my wife and daughter LOVE it. I substitute bacon pieces (the ones that can be found by the bacon bits in the grocery store) and they make it even easier. I change up the mustard each time, too just to give it a different taste each time.

I cut the mustard in half and still was too mustardy and the cheese got too done. Hubby said this is not one to make again. I gave it two stars because the chicken was moist.

I would rate this as okay.  Made according to the original recipe.  Used freshly shredded parmesan and bacon pieces which gave the topping a nice texture.  Also used low sodium teriyaki sauce based on other users comments about it being very salty.  It was okay, but I don't know if I'll make it again.  It was super easy, but the flavor wasn't as great as I'd hoped. I liked it a letter better than my husband did.

A very good chicken dish.  Everyone loved it.  I may also add that I found it needed an extra 5 minutes of cook time.  I'd say 35 minutes cook time is ideal for this recipe.

I did not enjoy this very much, but in all fairness, I did not follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have any bacon.  I like mustard...quite a bit usually, but this was just too much for my liking.  I gave it 3 stars because eating it with ranch dressing or barbeque sauce greatly helped the flavor and because I didn't follow the recipe exactly (I would have given it a 2 otherwise).

Very tasty. I did pour a little extra triyaki sauce on the chicken after it was cooked, because it appeared a little dry.

This is truly the tasiest - fast and most simple chicken I have ever made. Only variation I have made to the recipe are -- I use spicy brown mustard and no bacon bits. So good!!!!

This recipe is awesome!  I've made it several times and it's always wonderful and been a big hit with my family.  I did use real bacon (instead of bacon bits).

When I first saw the ingredients, I thought 'wow, that's different'.  And boy is it ever good.  Don't be scared to try this.  When my husband first tasted it, he thought there was too much of a mustard taste, but after the second taste, he said don't change a thing.

This recipe was very easy, however, I really didn't like it.  The bacon bits, which I am a great fan of, just didn't go well with chicken, mustard and terriaki.  This taste repeated on me all night and it wasn't very pleasant.  My husband said it was okay.  When asked to give it a rating from 1 to 10, he gave it a 5!  I was shocked, because he is not a picky eater.  My kids didn't touch it.  I will not make it again.

I thought this recipe was good.  The chicken was very tender and the flavor was great!  But, my picky-eater daughter didn't enjoy it, so I probably won't be making this dish again.  I guess we can't please everyone!

After reading many of the reviews, I decided I would not use as much mustard or teriyaki sauce, but next time, I will use a bit more. I agree w/another review that it's an individual taste thing-I love dijon mustard & the taste is superb! I also bought fresh bacon bits from Hormel...this might make a difference in the taste (or saltiness) of all the ingredients. I am also going to try using grated parmesan with asiago & rosatto to help add some flavor.  Otherwise - what a great, fast dish! My boyfriend loved it & he doesn't like Dijon mustard! Thanks Aimee!

Very easy and an unusual falvor.  Not my favorite marinade for chicken, but it is an interesting change.  The kids liked the chicken once we scaped all of the "stuff" off, since it was very moist and flavorful.

This was very good! Had great flavors.  I especially like how easy it was to make.  I'm not a good cook and when I find dishes that make it seem like I know how to cook, it inspires me to keep trying.   My 6-year-old daughter had some instead of cereal. (ha, ha, ha)  I will definitely make this again! Thank you very much!

I marinated the chicken in the mustard and teriyaki glaze while thawing it and I used real bacon. I really thought this was going to be gross, but it wasn't. All three of my kids ate it!

Yummy, I cooked this for my boyfriend last night and his eyes lit up.  I didn't use bacon bits and instead cooked chicken thighs and drums for 40 mins which made it more moist and cheeper too!

I don't have any bacon bits, so I wrapped my chicken in bacon slices and cooked it that way. Pretty yummy, and definitely easy. I suggest low-sodium teryaki sauce to cut down a bit on the salt, as there is a lot in this recipe. I also usually use low-sodium bacon in my cooking--you can't make bacon healthy, but it's a start.

The chicken came out perfectly cooked, but we really didn't like the taste that much.  Though this could have been b/c I used teriaki grill mates instead of regular teriaki and didn't use bacon bits.  It was good, but I don't think I'll make it again.

My husband and I loved this.  I gave it only 4 stars because it was very, very salty.  I would use a low sodium teriyaki sauce if you can find it.  I'll definitely make this again.

It was so easy and all though I was hesitant at first with the ingredients, the taste really blended well.  I serve it with buttered egg noodles and a veggie.

I used 3 slices of real bacon & added some mozzarella cheese as well. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly as written. It was fantastic! My kids ate it up as well & this one will definitely be a keeper for being so fast & easy.

This has to be the best chicken I have ever made that took so little effort.  It was moist, tender and the flavor is awesome.  I would serve this to company.  It got rave reviews from the whole family.  The only change I made, I used Yoshida's Gourmet Teriyaki Sauce (a thick sweet sauce) instead of the thin soy type.  I went light on the bacon bits as suggested by other reviews and it wasn't salty at all.  It just seemed too easy to be soooo good.  The kids asked if we could have it again tomorrow night, and they are picky eaters.  I served it with rice-a-roni and broccoli.  Quick, easy, yum.  Thanks Aimee

Liked it a lot. Didn't have any bacon bits, but still tasted great. My husband thought it was a little bit too salty, which is due to the teriyaki sauce. I thought it was tasty that way. From now on I will keep the neccessary ingredients in the house. It is very quick and easy.

This is really very good.  People are complaining that it's too salty, but I didn't find that at all.  I used regular dijon and teriyaki "baste and glaze" (this is thicker than regular teriyaki sauce).  It came out great!

Oh my goodness!!!!!....This recipe has to be the best tasting chicken recipe I've had in years. My company just loved it. It comes out so juicy and has a unique taste to it. Serve the remainder of the juice in the pan over white rice.

My family and I didn't care for the way it turned out.  It was way too salty, due to the combination of teriyaki sauce, bacon bits and parmesan cheese.  This recipe won't be a keeper in my recipe file.

You would think that these ingredients are an odd combination but they cook up great.  It was very tasty!  This is a keeper!

I didn't like this at ALL.  DH liked it but not me.  I like all those ingredients separately, but I'm not sure about combining them.  It might have been good without the bacon, but I don't think I'll try it again.
