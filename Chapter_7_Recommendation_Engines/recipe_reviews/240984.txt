Good soup! I made a few changes and this one is a keeper. I used chicken broth instead of the water, doubled the garlic powder and nutmeg, added some ground cinnamon and topped it with some heavy cream. Good easy to make soup.

I added some extra garlic and Himalayan pink sea salt to boost the flavor but overall we loved this recipe. We tend to enjoy soups with a vegetable broth base and would make this again. I decided to leave the vegetables chunky instead of pureeing them. We served this with crusty french bread for dinner.

This recipe is alright, but I did spice it up with 2 tbsp of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp coriander, and a pinch of both allspice and cloves. I didn't use any salt because the boullion was more than sufficient -- it kind of overpowered the rest of the flavors, honestly. The texture is on point, the veggie content is awesome, but the soup needs a little bit of TLC.

I didn't put this in the crockpot but just cooked it on the stove.  I used chicken broth instead of water and boullion cubes.  I did add about 1/2 cup of half and half at the end to smooth it out a bit.  I probably won't make this again

I followed the recipe exactly and It was ok.  I swirled in sour cream for garnish when serving, and that helped somewhat.  It would be a great soup if you are trying to watch your calories.  If you are looking for something with more flavor and depth, you may try another recipe.

Used 8 cups vegetable broth instead of bouillon cube and water.  Topped with sour cream drizzle before serving.
