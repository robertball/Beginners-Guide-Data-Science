I have to admit I thought this was not going to be something I would like. I thought it would be way too sweet for me but my kids would eat it. It was GREAT! Simple, quick and cheap. When it was done the meat was falling off the bone and the falvor was excellent. My wife and I put just a hint of tobasco on our portions to "mature" the flavor just a little and I returned to the computer to add it to my recipe box. Thanks.

This is an excellent beginning.  To spice it up a bit I added ginger (2 tsp) and curry powder (2 tsp).  I used brown sugar instead of the white, and will probably use honey next time.

I must admit that I am somewhat of a reckless cook, as I did not mix the ingredients in the order listed. :)

Just made this dish the other night...it was wonderful.  However, I used the sauce as a marinade and basting for chicken on the grill.  It was wonderful...the chicken had flavor and was really moist.  Try this alternative!!!

I can't make this enough.  My family eats it and fast. Even when I make extra, it goes to school and to work with everyone.  The sauce is beyond discription and when you serve it on rice, it is amazing.  To any of you who have not tried this, it is somewhat like sweet n sour chicken but BETTER!!!

This is a fast meal that tastes like you slaved over it.  I am always looking for different chicken recipies as we love chicken.  I used chicken breasts, and used an earlier suggestion to simmer for 1/2 hour.  Turned out perfect.  Would make again!

This was AWESOME!!!  I even shared it with my neighbor.  I thought it was going to be sweet but it wasn't.  Next time I'm adding an onion and some garlic.  (It's the Italian in me - gotta have garlic).  I use boneless breast cut into pieces and it turned out fabulous.  Why fuss with bones?  I also served it over brown rice and poured the extra sauce over it all.  FANTASTIC!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was quick and easy to make and within about an hour supper was ready to be served.  I think that I would add a little extra spice to give it a little more kick the next time that I make it, and I will make it again.

This is really a great, simple recipe.  I like to review recipe's as is and will give it five stars, but for personal preference I now finely dice about half of a jalapeno pepper and add a few sliced mushrooms.  Tremendous!

Very good!  We both liked this a lot!  We did make a few revisions.  Instead of simmering the chicken on the stove top or in a crockpot we used it as a marinade and basting sauce for grilled boneless, skinless, chicken breasts.  Brown sugar instead of white.  One cup water seemed entirely too much!  We cut that back to 1/4 cup.  Also added was one tablespoon of finely minced onion, and a heaping 1/4 teaspoon each of mustard powder and freshly ground pepper.  Marinated the chicken for about an hour before grilling and basting.

This was a very easy and very tasty recipe.  I replaced sugar with Splenda and added tabasco sauce.  It only took an hour from beginning to start with very little prep.  I also doubled the sauce recipe.

There wasn't an instruction to cut the whole chicken into pieces, but obviously one must or the chicken will not all contact the sauce in the pot.  The only thing I changed was cider vinegar instead of white. I left the rest as is. We decided it was fairly tasty, but could use a little something. Not exactly sure what. Maybe onions and garlic, maybe other veggies, maybe less sugar.  I served it with a saute of various vegetables, and the kids ate it up. My daughter particularly enjoyed the sauce. My husband liked that the meat was loosening from the bones. I used a rather larger bird than called for, and the breast ended up slightly dry without the sauce. But with the sauce it was fine.  We decided to keep the recipe and try to find out what's missing (for us).

I made this tonight and it was terrific!  Slight modifications based on others' reviews.....  I used drumsticks and thighs and took all the skin/fat off.  I used Demerara sugar instead of white, added ginger and a diced onion to the sauce.  The chicken fell off the bones and the sauce was just right.  Everyone had seconds!

I made this recipe this weekend when I learned I'd be having unexpected overnight guests.   The night before I cut up a whole chicken and put it in a simple brine (water, apple cider, a little brown sugar and cracked peppercorns).  I made the sauce in advanced and planned on grilling the chicken.  It rained, so after draining the brine off the chicken, I let the chicken marinate in this sauce for about 1 hour.  I set aside about 1 cup of the sauce.   I baked the chicken at 350 for about 1 hour and at the very end, brushed the remaining sauce on the chicken.   My GUESTS LOVED IT!  And I couldn't believe it, a couple of my neighbors could smell it baking and they knocked on my door to tell me how good it smelled (I live in the suburbs).  This is great, great, GREAT!  Only thing different I did was to add a few pieces of pineapple (smashed) to the sauce as I found them in the bottom of a leftover bowl of fruit!  I'm sure it wasn't necessary - but I did it.   Thank you CCLady for sharing!!!

I'm making this for the second time as I type. I'm using homemade chipotle ketchup and I'm thrown the trinity (green pepper, onion and celery) and a habanero pepper in with the chicken. Oh, I also added some fresh thyme. It smells delicious!

Made this for dinner last night.  After reading a few reviews regarding more flavour, I decided to saute 1/2 c each of celery/onion with 2 cloves of garlic in the bottom of the pot first.  I then added the cut up chicken pieces on top and simmered for about 5-6 minutes, browning chicken a bit.  I then added the sauce mixture over the chicken with a few whole celery tops (with leaves) and 2 bay leaves.  Simmered for about 1 hour with the lid on. Took out bay leaves/celery tops and served over rice.  It was fantastic, great sauce and my family loved it.  Will definately be making again, and again.

My husband and kids devoured this.  They ate everything down to the bones.  I sauteed some frozen onion and bell pepper in olive oil before making the sauce.  When I make this again I will take the skin off the chicken as there was just a little too much fat for my liking. I will also add a little red pepper for heat.

Tried this recipe based on the positive reviews, even though after looking at the ingredients, wasn't particularly inspired to try it.  Finally prepared this dish and it was very, very good, a nice surprise.  It's tangy and different than any other chicken dish I've had.

I used honey instead of white sugar and cooked the chicken and sauce in the slow cooker (didn't boil the sauce beforehand, since it boils in the slow cooker). The sauce was thin, and it was a little bit too tangy for out taste. We liked it well enough, but I most likely wouldn't make this again.

I love this recipe as a quick, easy way to use chicken.  It's very tangy and has a sharp flavor, but that's kind of obvious due to the vinegar and mustard.  Personally, I love that, but it's not for everyone.  We prefer to use cut-up chicken breasts for this, just because I like white meat, but either way, it's a handy recipe to have!

I made this for a party awhile back. I first tried it out myself the day before and saved the sauce to marinade the chicken pieces the next day. It turned out even  better the second time and received rave reviews. I would recommend doing this, but the recipe as is comes out great.

This was great.  I searched the net for an hour to find it again because I did not put it in my favorites.  Definetly a keeper.  I used chicken wings and chicken breast strips I also added cayenne pepper to it and everbody in my family loved it (even my picky 8 yr old who is now 16) which is saying alot.  None of us have the same tastes, so it is nice when I find a recipe that we all love and ask for.

This was sooooo good.  I made a few variations, only because it was what I had in my fridge.  I used boneless chicken breasts and honey mustard, red wine vinegar, and Heinz Hot Ketchup.  The Hot Ketchup made the dish really spicy!  My husband and I love chicken and I am always looking for new ways to prepare it and this is definitely a keeper!

Easy to throw together and pretty good. I didn't know what to expect from this dish, but it's kind of like a sweet and sour sauce with mustard in it.

It was good.  I think that the ketchup made it a little too strong.  I think next time I will try less ketchup and maybe add some curry powder to it. My family did eat it and they liked it but said not to add to much sauce to the rice cause it's a little to strong.

This recipe is a keeper, my picky husband enjoyed.  I did use previous suggestions, cut vinegar down to 2 tbsp, used brown sugar instead of white.  I used boneless chicken breast and simmered 30 minutes, adding 1 tbsp cornstarch/water last 10 minutes of cooking to thicken.

This is unbelievably simple, yet so delicious!  The only change I would make next time, and there will be one, is to only use about 1/4 C. of vinegar as it was just a little too tart for us.  Served with Puerto Rican Steamed Rice, also from this site...excellent dinner.

This was really good.  I skinned and cut as much fat off my chicken before cooking to cut down on grease.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.

pretty good, too much vinegar for my family's tastes but I can adjust that.  I boiled the ingredients and then put it in the crock pot with chicken breasts for about 3 hours on low.  it worked great, the breasts were done just right.  my husband thinks it would be a good mixture to par-boil ribs in for BBQ.

This is a great recipe! Easy to make and tastes wonderful! I used 1 lb boneless chicken breasts instead of a 3 lb chicken and served it over rice with all of the extra sauce. Tastes a little like a sweet bbq sauce. Will be making this again!

A great beginning!  
I tasted it after it had simmered for a little while "as is"...while I love tangy/sour I found that it needed a little more sweet.  I added a little brown sugar and some honey.  Another addition to the sauce was garlic, onion powder, pepper and some condensed chicken stock.  No measures just added to taste.  I opted to transfer everything to a baking casserole and added sliced red onions and red bell peppers.  
I will be making this again for sure, and each time I will likely make a few changes for the flavor that suits me that day.  The possibilities are endless.
Thank you for posting this, even my picky eater 4 year old liked it!

Very tasty and easier than I expected!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and simmered them for about 35 minutes, then placed/poured over rice.  I didn't think it was a great combination with the rice, but I bet it would be awesome with mashed potatoes!

I made this for dinner last night.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar because it seemed like a better idea, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.

It's very good - *I* would like it either a little sweeter or a little spicier - maybe taking the suggestion of adding some ginger.  So I would give it 4.5 stars.

My husband, on the other hand, LOVED this! ! !  I asked him how many stars he would give from one-five, and he said, "SIX!"  I think we will try what some other reviews said and use this sauce on pork!  Can you imagine how good it would be in a slow cooker?  Talk about fall off the bones!

Thanks for a great recipe!

This was awsome. A great sweet and sour chicken. I did add several changes like adding veggies and some pineapples and pineapple juice. I also used brown and white sugar and hot sauce. My family loved this, though it was a bit sweet.(forgot to cut back sugar when adding 1/2 c pineapple juice silly me.) I will make this agian and not use as much sugar next time. I added the following with the chicken to make a sort of chinese meal:
small onion, half a large green pepper, 2 stalks of celery, 1/4 bag of baby carrots cut in 4ths,frozen peas and 1/2 a can of 24oz pineapple in juice. I made some rice and poured the whole thing on the rice for dinner. My alterations didn't change the sauce though, just made it a more well rounded meal. I love this recipe very simple to make and delicious. Thanks

Fabulous! This is my new favorite chicken recipe! The sauce is delicious -- I served it with rice. Even my picky 15-year-old son loved it. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and water at the end to give it a more gravy-like consistency.

This was quite possibly the best chicken stew dish that I have ever made.  The wife and I ate all 3 pounds of the cut up chicken (more on my end).  I followed the recipe except I sauteed down some fresh garlic and did not put nearly as much sugar as I do not care for sweet dishes.  Served over hungarian dumplings.  Thanks for posting.

My husband and I both love this recipe.  It's extremely easy and tastes great.  I make this with rice and vegetables for an easy weekday meal.

This was very good.  I took the advice of one review to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch and found that helped alot.  Definitely will make this again

This was a great recipe that everyone in the family (mom, dad, 4 kids!!) LOVED.  We love how easy it is and that it uses ingredients we already have in the pantry!

This was a great hit at my table!  I kept dunking my finger in the pot while it simmered just to taste the sauce.  My boyfriend said "make sure you give this recipe a good rating on that website!"  I used the left over sauce when making homemade burgers.  I just mixed it in with groud beef and onions.  It was great!  Thank you so much.

I made this last night with bone in legs and thigs and it was very good. I used brown sugar instead of white and it wasn't as sweet. Also added hot sauce to zing it up a bit. The best part is that this morning I defatted the sauce and deboned the chicken and will serve this as "chicken sloppy joe's" over hamburger buns.  This is a simple recipe that gives you two for one and I have given it to my college age friends as it is very inexpensive and easy.

Excellent!  I used 3 lbs. of skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  After it was cooked, I took the chicken and cut it into large chunks and some shreds, returned it to the sauce and served it over plain white rice.  I can't wait to try the leftovers--probably will try them over mashed potatoes.  Very easy and tasty--will make it again...maybe in the crockpot next time.

My kids loved this recipe when I made it last night.  They made comments while I was putting it together about how gross the ingredients were together.  They changed their tune once they tried it!  Definitely going to make this again.  Only change I will make is to decrease the amount of vinegar and add red pepper flakes.

Delicious!! My picky son's first words were, "Wow Mom! This is great!" I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which cut the cooking time down. Also ran out of white vinegar, so substituted cider vinegar. Worked fine. Really good, breasts were juicy and tender. Going to adapt this recipe for my slow cooker!

I thought I was going to have this fantastic chicken according to the reviews but I was very disappointed. It was not that great and I had to add more spice to give it somekind of kick. With the kick the hubby loved it. Definitely needed the tobasco that I added. I will make again.

This recipe was awesome! My kids are picky and they even loved it. I made a few changes which were - added garlic, onions, cubed up my chicken and I added some cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. We then put it over rice. It was sooo good!

whoever posted this recipe... you are GREAT!  My family and I love this recipe.  I tried it about 4 or 5 years ago and lost it accidentally.  I couldn't remember the name of it but I searched for it for ages as it was so delicious.  Now that I've found it again it is part of our regular meals.  THANK YOU!!!!!!

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  The sauce was very watery,  and the breast portion of the chicken very dry.  We did eat it,  but will not make it again for sure.  There are much better things you can do with a chicken.  Sorry!!

I liked this recipe.  It was very easy to make.  I used chicken quarters because I had a package in the freezer, but I think I would like it with boneless skinless breast the next time.  I would also add some sliced onions and serve with egg noodles.  I made the sauce in a fry pan and added the chicken put the lid on and forgot about it.  It doesn't get any easier than that. Oh I also thickened up the sauce with some corn starch and it worked great. Thanks for sharing.

Took a chance and made this tonight for supper. I was a little skeptical as all I smelled while it was cooking was the mustard but there was no mustardy taste when we ate it. Made boiled potatoes and hubby put the "gravy" on them and said it was really good. Will be making this again!

This was great! I used skinless boneless chicken breasts. The chicken came out tender and full of flavor. Very easy meal, just add some rice and veggies on the side and you are set. I didn't think it would be this good!

I didn't think it tasted like bbq; I added a hot asian chile sauce and it tastes kind of like a spicy sweet-n-sour. I followed the recipe amounts exactly, and used brown sugar instead of white. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, because it was the cheaper alternative to breasts and it came out great. Served over rice with garlic green beans. It's a good dish to have in rotation; it's not spectacular, but it's a nice change for middle of the week dinner.

I had put a chicken in the slow cooker just  on its own and wanted a sauce to put over it when it was done.  I made up a batch of this sauce, and it was pretty watery so I cooked it down, reduced it by half and it was WONDERFUL!  I was weary of the ingredients at first but it all combined together into something exceptionally tasty.  I'll definitely make this again!!!

I did not really care for this recipe too much.  If I try this again I will add less vinegar for sure and maybe some curry as someone else suggested.

This was the first time I've ever tried to cook a whole cut-up chicken with bones and I'm not young and I love to cook. We eat chicken several times a week, but I have always just stuck with breasts, usually boneless.  Well, whole chicken was on sale so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  And boy was I pleased with the outcome. I followed this recipe to a T and it came out perfectly.  All the different size pieces were cooked perfectly and evenly and the chicken was super moist.  I found the sauce pleasantly mild as I was expecting an overpowering ketchup taste.  I will definitely make this again.  My kids weren't sure what was going on when I served chicken legs with their dinner since they've never seen me try to cook them before.  I served this with simple white rice that I cooked in chicken broth and topped with a little parmesan cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.  This one is a keeper.

This chicken is tender and covered in a sweet, thick sauce.  It is like barbecued chicken made anytime on the stove.  Honey can be substituted for sugar as it is a healthier option and nicely compliments the recipe's other ingredients.  Be careful to keep your eye on the sauce so that it doesn't burn because the sugars tend to caramelize.  Served with corn, salad, and rice, potatoes, or biscuits, it's a dish that adults and kids alike will thoroughly enjoy.

I liked the recipe for once in a while; however, I will definitely cut down on the amount of sugar called for... eventhough I had used less sugar than called for.  It was too sweet for my taste.

This was the first "whole chicken" recipe that I tried, and it was excellent! Very easy to make, and it smells so good while it's cooking. Both my husband and I enjoyed it!

This was so... awesome! I've never made a meal like this with all the ingredients so easy & on hand.We thought it needed to be thickened so next time I'll use a little cornstarch other than that won't change a thing! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!! Very good - made enough for two times and froze the second half.  Only change that I did was to thicken a bit with arrowroot powder and water.  Thank you.

This reminds me a little of low country barbecue, the tangy kind eaten in coastal South Carolina. This is going in my favorite recipes book- it's fast and easy, and the ingredients blend well to make a rich sauce that's perfect for serving with rice or just over the chicken itself. Thanks Marsha!

Great Recipe! I used boneless, skinless chicken and "kicked it up a knotch" by adding red pepper flakes and a dash of habanero sauce. If you like the sauce to be a little thicker just add a mixture of corn starch and water. I did and it turned out great. The whole family loved it. Will make again I'm sure! Thanks, Greg

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it a few times.  I love the flavor of the sauce.  I've made it w/ mashed potatoes or rice.  Even if you aren't going to use the sauce to eat, it flavors the chicken so well it's worth making it.

This chicken is sooo easy and so delicious. I did not change a thing. I like one step recipes when i am in a hurry and it helped that this is a recipe where i didnt need to brown the chicken first. My kids love it, my husband loves it and so did i. The chicken was moist and tender and very flavourful.

This recipe was really good. I varied it by salt and peppering the chicken. Then seared the chicken before adding it to the sauce. I also added frozen sugar snap peas during the last few minutes of cooking. I also served it over steamed rice.

I'm Bou's other daughter, and another family variation of this gem is to omit the water, and use it to baste/glaze chicken, burgers, fish or whatever.  Still delicious and easy!

17/02/16 - Wonderful! Really loved this dish. Used chicken thighs, which I browned in a skillet first, and cooked in slow cooker for 8hrs. Added carrots, celery and capsicum. May reduce sugar slightly as is quite sweet. Super easy and super tasty! The sauce is amazing!

I made this dish, but substituted boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the whole bird. Literally no fat and fewer calories, too. Also had the bonus of not having to carve a chicken which can amount to a lot of waste. The mild piquant sauce and moist chicken make this a hit!

Been using this one for years now. Always puts a smile on people's faces. Also excellent with pork ribs. Just simmer low and slow. The longer it simmers, the more tender and flavorful it gets. Great for starting in the slow cooker in the morning so it's ready for after work.

Cooked a four drumsticks along with four large boneless skinless breasts.  The drumsticks were definitely much better.  Next time I'm only going to go with bone-in chicken.

Last night I did two different chicken dishes for my husband and I to try, this one, which was great, I did add hot sauce to it, we just loved the flavor.  We also did "Honey Baked Chicken II"  it was also good, but this was better.

This was good. I'll make it every now and then for a change. I'm always looking for new chicken dishes as we more chicken and vegetable dishes than anything else.

This is a good recipe. I use it as it is. Try using the leftover sauce to simmer hot links in after you take 'em off the grill. Awesome!!

I made this meal last night and I put it over white rice. It was wonderful. While cooking the mustard smell was overwhelming, but it came out great. I took someones tip of adding ginger and I also added some chili powder for more of a kick. My husband liked it but thought I should use a little less mustard next time.

Incredibly quick to throw together. Maybe 10 minutes tops and then that was it. I left it simmering and did chores. It wasn't terrific lip smacking dandy tasting but it wasn't terrible at all either. The first four are for the taste, I added the fifth because it was so easy to make (I had everything already)

This is a great tasting recipe! What is also nice about it is that these are ingredients that are always kept in the refrigerator and pantry. I used cut up chicken tenders and put it over rice. I'll probably double the sauce next time, that is the best part!! Thanks for this recipe!

This was delicious and simple to make.  I added half a small diced onion just before the sauce mixture came to a boil.  I also threw in a small can (drained) of pineapple chunks and about 3/4 cup of frozen peas.  A bit of cornstarch to thicken at the end and I had a fabulous sweet and sour chicken dish!  Everyone cleaned their plates. Awesome recipe!

Oh my goodness, I made this chicken and the aroma was great and the flavor just wonderful.  My husband walked through the door and couldn't stop talking about how it smelled as it cooked and he practically inhaled it.  Thanks for this not only great, but simple recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I omitted the sugar completely as my husband is not fond of sweet sauces on meat. The chicken was still fantastic. I have to admit I did not add the ingredients in order; I followed the advice of several others and doubled the sauce but I used it to marinate the chicken over night and then cooked it in the oven @ 375 for 90 minutes. I made oriental rice (from a box) as a side and the sauce was great with it. I also added some of the sauce to a cup for dipping my chicken - it was very tasty! I will definitely be making this again. I love this website!

This sauce was excellent but I did change it a little bit...I did not add the water so it was much thicker and I added a little bit of hot sauce.

I liked the taste of the sauce and so did my friend. We had made a little of this to taste during dinner time, which was burgers, and thought it tasted pretty good. My friend tried the sauce on her burger and said it tasted good. I tried it too later. This sauce is great on burgers also. Try it some time!

LOVE this recipe! However, I modify it by using chicken breasts and then cook in the slow cooker on low 6-8 hours or on high about 4 hours. Approximately 30 minutes or so before you are ready to eat, pull the chicken breasts out, shred them and return to the slow cooker for the remaining cook time. Serve on a bun. Makes a fabulous pulled chicken sandwich!!

Delicious!! I used brown sugar instead of white. I added cornstarch & water mixture toward the end to make it thicker - it is a pretty thin sauce. I doubled the sauce ingredients as I had more chicken than the recipe called for. There was alot of sauce left over & chicken for a 2nd meal. I then used the extra sauce with pasta & mixed in frozen chopped spinach to serve with the chicken again. Wonderful both times.

I did not care for this and neither did the kids (teenagers who would eat cold hamburgers). My husband thought it was fabulous. If we make it again, he'll be eating it alone. I'll take the kids for pizza. While the chicken was very tender I just thought the taste was awful. Ketchup and mustard chicken in grease water. It just didn't sit well in the tummy. I recommend skinless chicken; otherwise you get a nasty fatty mess when you refrigerate leftovers. I think it would have tasted MUCH better without the skins.

Wow, we like Bou's chicken!  I used bone-in chicken breasts.  I let them simmer a little longer than recipe called for and they were a tad dry. I can only imagine the greatness of this recipe if I pay attention next time!  I took the skins off the chicken and trimmed all the fat off before simmering. I used brown sugar in place of white, I thought it would go with these flavors better. I think I will make this often.

This is a good recipe if you like barbeque type chicken. The sauce was thin, so I thickened it as suggested.  It took longer than 45 min to cook with lid ajar. I wish the family had liked it better b/c it was simple and easy to prepare.

This was so easy!  I was very surprised that such simple ingredients could create such a tangy, flavorful dish.  The sauce was a little bit watery though, and I think I'll take others' advice and add some cornstarch next time to thicken it up.

I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken for this recipe and I cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes.  It was pretty good-the sauce was like a BBQ sauce that I served over rice.

Who would have thought that mixing those ingredients would taste like that! It's a very versatile sauce that can be altered to taste any way you like. Perfect!

I followed this recipe exactly as shown. I simmered it well over an hour (because of distractions at home) and it didn't compromise the taste!  It was so simple and inexpensive and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I paired it with garlic mashed potatoes and it was a huge hit!  Cheers to Bou and Marsha!!

Way too greasy!  Could only eat the sauce after degreasing.  Maybe if you skinned the chicken it would be OK, but the flavor was less than average.  Won't make again.

I have made this recipe at least 5 times now for various crowds and it is always a huge hit.  I do cut the vinegar to about 2 tsp., but that's just my preference.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I really liked this. I was disappointed to find out that my husband and 7 year old daughter did not like. My husband said it was to sweet and the sauce was to thin. Well since I'm the only one that liked this I won't be making again.

I have made this several times, and it amazes me that it is good everytime.  It seems like a weird combination of ingredients, but it is very good.  Great to have on a cold night with rice.  Thanks

I accidentally used only 1/4 cup of ketchup instead of 1 cup. It came out great. Nice and tangy, kind of like Adobo, mmmm. One of the few things everyone liked: me, husband, and picky 9 and 7 year olds.

On top of that, the ingredients are easily on hand, it's easy to make, what could be better?

I didn't realize my 1/4 cup mistake until I came back to submit my review, so here's to "Bou Bous" and Bou herself!

Loved it. Reminded me of Adobo. Leftover sauce can be used in place of BBQ sauce.

Chicken had a very good flavor, but the meat was dry.  I would make it again though.  I served it as a bbq chicken with potatoes and veggies.

Very easy to prepare.  The only reason I didn't rate it a five is it is just a little to sweet for my families taste.  I thought it was delicious.  Be sure to serve with white rice.

I made some changes (Teriyaki i/o Soy), baked i/o boiled, and it was a real hit!  The kids loved it!  (And so did my husband.)
