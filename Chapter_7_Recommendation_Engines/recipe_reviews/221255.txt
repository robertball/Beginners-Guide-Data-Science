Super simple and really good.  My daughter (who is known to be picky) raved about it!  Definitely a keeper for a quick spread you can make out of pantry staples.

The dip was alright. I found it to be really thick and salty. I added probably another 1/4 cup of sour cream to thin it down some.It was still very thick. It isn't  a good consistency for dipping veggies. I also started out with only 1 tsp. of garlic powder and found I could add a little more before it got too strong, so it was about 1 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.

I thought it was very good....but it had way too much garlic in it. It did not go over real well at the party I took it to. I think everyone liked it but thought the same and so very little of it was eaten. I didn't want to throw it away because I had most of it left over so the next day I did something I thought was brilliant. I made a fantastic potato soup and added all the dip to it and talk about a fantastic flavor? It was the best potato soup I've ever made.  If I ever make this dip again........it will be with much less garlic powder.

I made this but used Greek yogurt and fresh crushed garlic and fresh dill which really made this taste great! It was a huge hit at 4th of July party.

Amazing!!!  Stayed true to the recipe, and also made it with jarred red pepper, chopped up fine.  Delicious either way.  I love it spread on toast and topped with bruschetta.

I used some tomato & basil feta instead of plain, and it was amazing! We dipped various colours of sweet peppers in this, but it was also good on crackers or spread on toast. Definitely one I'll keep in my file for last minute appetizers since I always have everything on-hand it requires.

Excellent! I love that I can quickly whip this up with ingredients I have on hand all the time. I can serve this to guests with bread and crackers or make it for myself and use it as a base for a variety of sandwiches. I've made it twice: once as directed and once with greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Both methods are delicious. Thanks for sharing!
