Live overseas and needed to make a 12x18x1 sheet cake but could only find one box mix.  I used steps 1-4 to make a bigger cake and it turned out perfectly delicious. Frosted and made a perfect birthday cake even without the tres leches!  Will try the rest of the recipie next time I'm in the states and can get all the ingredients!

My maid of honor and I spent a week baking up and freezing thirteen of these cakes. It turned out DELICIOUS and saved me over eight hundred dollars on wedding funds. All of the wedding cakes we sampled were somewhat dry and not nearly as tasty as they were pretty... This on the other hand, still gets me compliments when I run into friends. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

I'm making this cake again for the 10th time today.  It is by far the best tres leches recipe that I have come across.  I first made it when I was looking for a cake for my daughter's birthday.  Having grown up on these I went in search for one.  Needless to say the bakeries are charging an arm and a leg so I decided to try one myself.  This recipe produces a cake that is perfect to decorate unlike traditional tres leches that are soggy and cant support layers or decorations. The filling is super simple to whip up and delicious.  I've been covering it with a stabilized whipped cream frosting and then decorating.  It has been a hit everytime.

Excellent cake! I followed to the "T" except for the filling/frosting. I made in a 9x13 pan. Did not need filling, so used mousse for frosting. I found 2 cups whipping cream with 1 pkg instant pudding to be way too thick and did not provide an ample amount to frost 9x13, so used total of 4 cups whipping cream to 1 pkg instant French vanilla pudding. Got many compliments on the frosting, not too sweet since cake is sweet enough as is. Also the ratio of whipping cream made for a more "milk" flavor frosting that complimented the cake beautifully! Everyone thought frosting with buttercream would be way too sweet for this cake.

i made this cake for my secretary's birthday and it was a big hit at work! Adding extra ingredients to the cake mix does produce more batter and my layers baked over and dripped into the oven. I should have known better but went ahead with the directions as they were written. I used two 9 inch cake pans and would only fill them half full next time. I cut around the edges with a bread knife to remove the "muffin top" appearance and all was fine! I frosted mine with buttercream icing and that kept the mousse filling from oozing out. It was very helpful to freeze the layers a little for easier assembly. Bottom line is that this was a delicious cake!

Wow. I don't think I will make anything but this recipe for  vanilla cake again. Didn't care for the pudding mixed with cream for filling It tasted to packaged/chemical  for me. Will use a basic whipped cream for filling/frosting next time.

This was a huge hit at the baby shower I just threw. It solves the ultimate problem with tres leches cakes being too soggy to decorate. I used a little bit of almond extract in my buttercream frosting and it gave the cake a nice almond flavor twist.

If you can't find 18.25 ounce boxed cake mix add 1/3 cup additional cake mix to the recipe.

Some people don't like "soggy" cake, but it was a hit at my daughter's birthday party. I made this with the white chocolate  mousse frosting and used it as a filling as well. It is a little messy to make, but the key to success is to freeze the cakes in order to prevent the cake from "leaking".

I made this cake for my son's second birthday party this past weekend.  Everyone raved about it and one guest told me it was the best cake he's ever had.  My husband said it was the only time he's ever seen an entire cake eaten at a party.  I made the cake exactly as written except I substituted almond extract for the coconut extract.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and iced it with a whipped cream icing by adding the box of vanilla pudding mix to 4 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream along with about 3-4 tablespoons of powdered sugar.  4 cups of whipping cream would be plenty to fill and ice a two layer cake.  The extra half cup gave me extra for piping.  Delicious with fresh berries.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

It was ok. I didn't care too much for the taste of the cake. I think the texture of this cake recipe is really good for cake of filling. Also I didn't care for the vanilla pudding in the topping.

Made this cake for my Bunco group that I hosted on Cinco De Mayo. I made it in a 13 x 9 cake pan and used all the tres leche mixture except for 1 cup. Next time I will add less sweetened condensed milk because that flavor stood out and over powered the cake.  I also used one of the reviewer's ideas and frosted it with 4 cups heavy whipping cream with 1 box French vanilla pudding. The cake is so sweet that this frosting complimented it well. Here is what I did:  I sprayed my cake pan with oil/flour spray. After the cake was done baking, I let it cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack before turning out on a prepared cake board. I put strips of wax paper underneath the edges to catch the milk. I then poked holes all over it and gradually poured the mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until most the mixture was used. I refrigerated it for 4 hours and frosted it with the whip cream mixture that was also in the refrigerator for 4 hours. I followed the directions except changed my ratio for the frosting. Leftovers tasted the same the next day!  All the other cakes have to be thrown away because they are too soggy.
