Hmmm, I don't really understand this smoothie. It tasted like peanut butter and yogurt mainly, but had an odd tart finish. I am guessing, from the 3 strawberries? I am not sure. I followed the recipe exactly, only using a frozen banana because my blender can handle it. Frozen bananas, also just make smoothies more creamy. I also had to sub the pinch of nutmeg for a pinch of pumpkin pie spice, not being able to locate my nutmeg. If you like the taste of yogurt and peanut butter, this may be of interest. However, I would try it first without and then with the strawberries. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin either. It is a healthy addition though. I got 2 large to 3 small servings, instead of the 4, if counting calories.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't care for the combination of peanut butter, strawberries, and pumpkin.
