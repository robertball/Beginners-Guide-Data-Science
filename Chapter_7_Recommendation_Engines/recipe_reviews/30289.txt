very tasty! Iused about 1/2 the garlic and that I thought was plenty. I also doubled the amount of mint. Be careful not to over cooked the beans> I think 6 to 7 mins. is long enough. I also used this as a cold bean salad. Which was delicious but make sure to cool beans befor adding ingred. Thanks!

The beans and mint are nice together, but there is far too much oil and garlic in the recipe.  I would cut the garlic in half and use less oil, this way the salad is less slimy.

You do taste the garlic in this recipe, but both my husband and I enjoyed the taste very much, and would rate this recipe very good.  If I made any modifications, I'd increase the Mint leaves.

Very nice.  TIP: Those folks who find the garlic too strong; try poaching the cloves in the water with the beans.  It will  mellow the acidity, but you won't lose the health benefits of garlic.  If you have a recipe with oil, try poaching in the oil (VERY low heat, please).  the garlic should not color; this will make the garlic nutty and sweet. It only takes 1-2 tsp.  This tip is from ATK's garlic mashed potato recipe. DELISH!

This is a good, different green bean salad. I really liked the contrasting flavors of the vinegar dressing and the mint. After reading other reviews, I decided to saute the garlic and onion. I used all four cloves, and it wasn't overpowering at all. I also just lightly blanched the beans and didn't use the sugar. Nice recipe!

This was good, but not great.  I took other reviewer's suggestions and cut the garlic down to 2 cloves, and added more mint.  Upon tasting, I added extra vinegar.  I think green onions instead of regular onion would have been better.  It was nice for a change, but not sure I'll make again.

This was a very good recipe.  I did decrease the amount of garlic, but added raisins which went wonderfully with the rest of the ingredients.

Tasty.  I cut down on the oil per some other reviewers' suggestion and quadrupled the mint.  I would make this again.

This has such a fresh/sweet flavor.  I love it.  I didn't notice the garlic being too strong, but it didn't sit around too long either.

My grandma made this for years, and now I make it too.  Poaching the garlic makes it better, and the point of using the olive oil is to marinate the salad, which is why we always served it chilled after it sat in the icebox for two hours.  We also substituted flat leaf parsley for the dried mustard, and sometimes wine vinegar for the cider vinegar.  Otherwise it is her recipe.   Mangia!

I'm not a salad fan, so dishes like this aren't my favorite. But I made it for a big party. No one wanted to try it. So I brought it over to my aunts' and pretty much made them try it. It's interesting. Good. Not wow. The mint was really interesting. It was still savory but added a green taste, fresh, but not like mint gum.
