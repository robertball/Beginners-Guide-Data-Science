I made these when I went to visit my brother's family for Easter. I made rolled them 2 days before we left and deep fried them for about 2 minutes just before serving them. They were awesome! I found it VERY difficult to roll them like the instructions said so I spread the filling on thick and rolled them up like you would deli meat for a tray which turned out much better. I used toothpicks to keep their shape. I served them with whipped cream and they were amazing!

Used eggroll wrappers and these were phenomenal! Guess they'd be eggrolls then but still excellent.

Very tasty! Like pumpkin pie and churros had a baby--that's how my husband described it anyway. I used fresh sweet potatoes and boiled until soft and pureed it with the cinnamon since I didn't happen to have any canned on hand. I also had some bananas pretty close to being overly ripe so when making the chimichangas I went ahead and added a couple slices of banana before wrapping. I know the recipe says to place the sweet potato mixture in the center along the straight edge but that seemed to make them too fat to seal so I spread it in a line parallel to the cut edge and they came out much prettier. Will probably make again.

Deelishness! We healthified it by cutting marshmallow quantity and using maple syrup instead of powdered sugar. So really it was just microwaved potatoes a few marshmallows maple syrup cinnamon & a splash of vanilla heated rolled in whole wheat tortillas lightly grilled & served with a dollop of frozen yogurt. Frugal hubby's ultimate compliment "I would pay for that." it's a keeper! Thx!

I made these for a dinner party and everyone who ate one had this look of complete shock at how good they were. This is a keeper! I used both flour and corn tortillas (not together).
