I made it for a wedding shower, and everyone loved it. I also added bacon into the mixture. If you turn the tomatoes stem down and cut off the bottoms then scooping out the mixture, they won't roll around on your plate.

I always like to follow a recipe as written and make any alterations to the recipe, if it was worth a second try, after tasting it once.  That said, I made this recipe when I needed to bring something to a cookout and I found tomatoes on sale.  I followed the recipe exactly as written BUT I left out the shrimp.  (some people are allergic to shellfish and I didn't want to have to post warnings about my contribution to the table especially when the ingredients are not obvious) It was a hit.  They were tasty, refreshing little morsels to pop in your mouth.  Next time I will try it with a little finely chopped onion or scallions and of course, shrimp.
Nice recipe, DeltaQueen 50.
To the reviewer below.  I cleaned the tomatoes and made the cheese filling the night before.  Next day, construction was a breeze.  You have the right idea about the greens for a "bed to nest" the tomatoes on.  Next time try to julienne or finely shred a few lettuce/romaine/cabbage leaves to make a "fluffier bed" for them to nest upon

Just average for us.  Hubs and I were both disappointed that we could barely taste the shrimp.  If I make these again, I would "up" the amount of shrimp big time!

Fabulous & easy!  I took other's advice and added some Old Bay.  It was PHENOMENAL...  the tomatoes weren't hard at all (I prepped everything the night before & assembled the next day) and my extra went GREAT on ritz crackers!  I'll probably forego the tomatoes next time & just do the crackers w/ dip.  It was GREAT!  I put all the dip into a large ziploc bag to sit in the fridge overnight.  The next day, I arranged my tomatoes, snipped the corner off the bag & piped as normal.  Easy clean up! ;)  Thanks, Delta Queen!

What a great way to use up leftover shrimp! I took what was left from Christmas Eve out of the freezer and whipped up this pretty little appetizer for our dinner party last night. I did, however, add garlic and onion powder and a bit of cayenne. Thanks so much!

These are terrific.  I made them the night before and had a hard time trying to restrain myself from eating just one more.  Each time I messed one up, I said, YES!!!  

Seriously - I left out the salt/pepper and instead added 1 Tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning and it was fantastic!!  Im sure you could use some Creole seasoning as well, but the Old Bay really tied the flavors together and made it salty enough so that no extra salt was needed.  I highly recommend it!

Good Luck.

Very good and very easy...plus, it can be made ahead of time.  I used the small bay-type shrimp since it was going thru the food processor.  It was a hit with the group I made it for.  Thanks.

When I taste-tested this filling before stuffing the tomatoes, I wasn't terribly impressed, but when I tasted the tomato with the filling it just worked perfectly. This was a great way to use up the gazillion cherry tomatoes from our garden! I added a teaspoon of prepared pesto into the mixture and they became addictive! It took more than 2 pints of tomatoes to use up the mixture. Maybe my tomatoes were small. Thanks for the recipe, DeltaQueen!

Had an abundance of cherry tomatoes in my garden. This recipe was worth the work of cleaning out these little fellas. I am allergic to shrimp but not crab so I used canned crab meat instead. Delicious! Took them to a family gathering and they were gone in minutes! Even my grandchildren loved them. They are still asking when I will make them again.

We really like this recipe.  After tasting the shrimp mixture I added 1 teaspoon more horseradish and a little garlic powder, next time am going to add some chopped green onion.  I cut my prep time in half by allowing hubby in the kitchen!  I am so fortunate he is always willing to help with anything he gets to eat!

These were great! I added another tsp of horse radish and a pinch of red pepper and they were fantastic. Had quite a bit of filling left over and had it on crackers - really good!

This was very tasty - I added some tobasco sauce, too.  I used the mixture to stuff mushroom caps, and reserved a nice, fat looking shrimp to top each one (to make sure that all of my guests knew there were shrimp in them).  They were very popular.  Use the freshest shrimp you can find, to avoid fishiness.

I made this recipe just as directed. It was very bland and you could not taste the shrimp. I suggest doubleing the hoursradish and instead of puting the shrimp in the food processor I will chop the shrimp by hand into small pieces and fold them into the mixture before stuffing the tomatoes... I would also suggest more seasonings for taste... They were pretty though, just bland...

Made this for a family dinner and they sure didn't last long. The stuffing is great and it is all thanks to the horseradish. It was good in the tomatoes but would be equally good as a stand alone dip.

These were very good!  Hollowing out the tomatoes was the most difficult part, only because I was ill-equipped -  a grapefruit spoon would have done wonders.  Instead I used a paring knife to loosen the insides, then a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon for scooping.  I used canned baby shrimp for this and added parsley and chives into the mix, which I piped into the hollowed out tomatoes.  Had a little trouble getting then to "stay still", so if serving to guests I would nest them something - shredded lettuce, maybe even cooked couscous - as they tend to wobble.

Delicious!  I made these tonight on a trial run before a big baby shower and they are wonderful.  I used the larger cherry (not grape) tomatoes and I had just enough filling for two pints.  I boiled my shrimp beforehand with some Zatarain's Shrimp and Crab Boil.  To the filling mixture I added garlic powder, minced onion, and cayenne pepper.  This combination is perfect and makes a savory little treat that I am sure will be a hit.  Very easy to prepare if you have the Pampered Chef Cook's Corer and Easy Accent Decorator.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

These were wonderful little morsels!  It was very easy to make.  I added fresh garlic, and a little tabasco sauce.  Sprinkled with Lawry's.  I tried putting a spring of cilantro on one and that was tasty fresh, too.  It was really easy to fill them with The Pampered Chef's Easy Accent Decorator that I sell.  Also used the Cook's Corer to dig out the pulp.  Makes alot if the tomatoes are smaller.  Great recipe!

This was a tasty recipie. As did many other reviewers, I added 1 tsp. old bay seasoning. It was wonderful, however I couldn't taste the shrimp very well. Since I prefera  slightly more seafood-ie taste, next time I will add a bit more shrimp!

YUM-O...  The tomatoes weren't a big hit, but I did serve the shrimp spread separately with crackers, and Oh My!! It was DELICIOUS.  Everyone loved it.
Like others have commented, I also used Old Bay seasoning instead of S&P.

I made these for my daughter's birthday party last week. These are a little fiddly but well worth the effort. I garnished with snipped chives instead of parsley and made double the recipe which made a lot more than stated. this was good as I was feeding 90 people. A definite hit and I had 2 phone calls asking me for the recipe the following day. Many Thanks.

These were great, used them for a summer barbeque.  I didn't use any seafood because of allergies, but considered using canned crabmeat.  Instead of parsley on top I used chopped chives.  Emptying the tomatoes was easy because I used a melon baller.  A little timely, but well worth it!

The only problem I had with this recipe is the tediousness and time it took to make. Otherwise they were fantastic. I had a LOT of shrimp filling left over, so if you feel up to it, buy 3 pints of tomatoes. OR do what I did and serve it as a dip with crackers. I added more lemon juice than required as well as seeded and diced a jalapeño and put one little square of it on top of each tomato to give it a little kick. Everyone loved them.

I made this for a New Year's Eve party.  It was delicious!  My only problem was that the grocery store was out of cherry tomatoes and the only thing they had were the much smaller grape tomatoes., which would have been very tedious to scoop out and fill.  So I improvised a little.  I bought bite-sized phyllo shells (frozen foods section) and filled them, then topped each one with half a grape tomato.  It worked out well.

It's a deceptively simple recipe, but the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes paired with the creaminess of the shrimp filling works really well.  I loved these, and I normally don't like tomatoes.  It is a winner!  Next time I might scale back the mayo because I'm not a fan.  I also saw another reviewer that added bacon... mmm that sounds like a good version too.

Very, Very Bland.  Too much work for the results.  Tried to spice it up with spices.  Sorry, with such good reviews I thought I would like it.

I liked the filling but not with the tomatoes.  Better with good quality sesame crackers.

I think it needs a little more horseradish. It was very good but not enouhg kick to it. time-consuming though.

These were a delicious and a wonderful appetizer for mother's day dinner. I used a freezer bag with the tip cut off the corner to pump these into the tomatoes. Also, I used fresh shrimp and cooked in a little bit of chicken broth and seasoned salt before throwing into the food processor. It didn't have a fishy taste like some explained. It was spectacular!

I made this for a holiday potluck, and it went quickly. I had crab on hand so I used that in place of the shrimp. I added a little extra horseradish and lemon juice for extra flavor. At the suggestion of others, I used Old Bay seasoning in place of salt. Coring the tomatoes was very time consuming, but the dish was worth the effort!

Unfortuately when I went to make this recipe, every grocery store in a 5 mile radius was out of cherry tomatoes.  I was really looking forward to this so I still made the filling (I also added 1 tablespoon Old Bay) and served it with sour dough bread.  It was a hit at the BBQ I took it to.  I'll definately make it again.  Yum.

I just love these! And they always disappear quickly when I make them for potluck staff meetings. If for home, no shrimp as hubby desn't eat most seafood, but that makes them better when I do have them.

Tasty recipe!!  Very fiddly if you don't buy the best shrimp.  You'll end up de-veining them for hours!!!  Buy the best shrimp you can that are already deveined and you'll love this recipe!

It's hard to scoop out the insides of the cherry tomato.  But the stuffing was delicious.

Exactly how do you scoop out pulp from cherry tomatoes aside from being very careful. Is there a special way?   If I could figure that one out, that would be great!  Recipe sounds yummy.

The first time I made this, it was a little bland but we enjoyed it. As another reviewer said, we could barely taste the shrimp. Instead of increasing the amount of shrimp, the second time, I added some Old Bay seasoning. It kicked up the flavor and the salt in the Old Bay brought out the flavor in the shrimp. I've made it many times since then, adding scallions, substituting crab for the shrimp and always using the Old Bay. I'm from the northeast, so I use a lot of Old Bay, but add it according to you flavor preference. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this some time ago and thought it was a little labor intensive regarding cleaning out the tomatoes, but worth it.  Quite good.  My main problem was presentation.  They kept rolling around.  I diced up a bunch of lettuce to nest them in however I was hoping there would be other suggestions posted by now.  Any ideas?

Looked great, but didn't taste that good.  They tasted "fishy," maybe because I used the smallest (cheapest) shrimp from the seafood counter at the grocery store.  Will try again using better shrimp.
