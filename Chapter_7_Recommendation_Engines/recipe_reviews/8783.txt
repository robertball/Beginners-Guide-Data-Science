5 stars for tasting GREAT without alot of ingredients!!!!!  I followed the recipe as is.  I did turn the broiler on for an extra few minutes to crisp the bacon to our preferences.... Thank you
07/10/05 Review 2 - Stil 5 Stars!
I have made this so many times and have found the best way to make this by following the recipe exactly as is.  Too much flavor is lost if you cook the bacon beforehand.  I always turn on the broiler to brown the bacon during the last few minutes and turn it over to brown the other side, too.

I precook my bacon so it is crispy and just top chicken with it, pour soup over, then milk and bake.  So easy and can make with different soups for totally different flavors.  So far I have used celery soup, mushroom, potato, and nacho cheese.  Didn't care for it with the nacho cheese soup though.  Season chicken first with pepper, garlic, poultry seasoning, whatever you like.  I'd check the soup first to see if it's salty before adding any salt!  Don't forget the bacon is pretty salty too.   This is the first recipe I ever made from this site back in June, 2005 and my husband LOVES it, second to Burrito Pie.

When I asked my husband if I should make this one again, he gave me a look like he thought I was crazy and then emphatically said yes... for sure.  This was easy easy to make.  I used Turkey bacon instead of pork, and went with a cream of broccoli soup.  I actually put 2 bacon strips around each piece of chicken, and pounded the chicken flat first.  Beating up a piece of poultry is a great way to get some of my workday stress out.  

I will definately make this dish again.

This dish was average.  It was certainly easy to prepare.  I used low fat; low sodium soup and didn't bother with leaving the bacon on to brown.  There are better dishes out there.

Never thought I would give a "canned soup" recipe a five-star rating but this was deserving of it. We loved this. I pounded the chicken breasts and seasoned them with black pepper, garlic powder and rotisserie chicken seasoning. Only used two chicken breasts but kept the other amounts the same except I used two slices of bacon per breast (maple flavored). Served over white rice. I think using other seasonings is something that you have to do because it would be dull otherwise. Very simple to prepare.

This recipe was fantastic. My husband and kids went on and on about how good it was. I followed others suggestions about cooking the bacon first. I cooked it until it just started to get crisp. I removed the bacon and sauted some chopped onions in the bacon fat. I layed some larger pieces of bacon across the chicken and mixed smaller pieces and the onion in with the soup mixture. I also used more milk than what the recipe called for, but its really a matter of preference on how thick you want your gravy. YUMMY!!!

I pre cooked the bacon and I used cream of chicken with herbs canned soup instead of celery (had it on hand already).  It turned out very well.  You do have to season the meat otherwise it is very bland (per the advice of another reviewer).  Thanks will be making again.

We LOVED this!  I couldn't believe the regular taste of celery soup was changed so much by the flavour of the bacon!  Excellent recipe.  The only thing I would do differently is cut the chicken breasts in half (lengthwise) next time, as mine were quite thick and would have taken on more of the flavour of the sauce if thinner.  My boyfriend also requested more bacon, so I may wrap each chicken 'half' in bacon next time.

Simple ingredients. Fabulous taste! I cut 2 chicken cutlets into strips, sprinkled them with pepper and garlic powder, poured the sauce as given in the recipe over all, then laid the bacon strips on top. After 30 minutes, I uncovered the dish and turned the heat up to 400. Served it over angel hair pasta. Yum!

This is one of the best chicken recipies I have ever made.  The first time I made it, I didn't make enough!! My husband wanted seconds!  The second time I made it, I add something.  After the chicken had finished baking, I put a thin slice of cream cheese on top of each piece of chicken and stuck it under the broiler until brown and bubbley...even better!!!

We loved this easy chicken dish! My sister couldn't believe how great this little recipe was. I doubled this recipe, added an onion, precooked my bacon a wee bit, and seasoned my chicken with a little garlic salt and pepper. The chicken was so moist!
Yummy! Yummy!
Will make it again! Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good chicken recipe.  We are watching our fat intake so I made it with 98% fat free soup and my husband still raved about it. This is definitely a "keeper".

I used cream of mushroom soup and it made everything taste like a hot dog. I only had the mushroom soup on hand. It was not very good. I think that if I made it with the cream soup on the recipe it would have turned out better. kind of disappointed.

Pretty good! I used the Fully Cooked bacon and seasoned the chicken breast with ground garlic and black pepper. I forgot to cover the pan with foil for the 1st 15min and it still turned out well. I served it over brown rice with green beans.

Great recipe! I did do a few things different. 1) I added salt, pepper, and a garlic and herb seasoning mix to the chicken. 2) I baked the chicken for 20 minutes (at 375) and then pan cooked it the rest of the way. That way the chicken browned and the bacon crisped up a little bit. I baked it first, so that the bacon would actually stick to the chicken. This was a great dish, with a lot of flavor! I will make this again.

Okay, okay, okay I used ham instead of bacon.  I didn't see it would make that much difference - especially after tasting.  It looked pretty discusting, but the flavor wasn't as bad as it looked.  :l  :/  One of those obvious "pour soup over the chicken" type dinners.

Excellent.  It's what I'm always looking for.  Different flavor, quick and easy.  Be SURE to cook the bacon almost all the way done BEFORE you put it on the chicken unless you like it soggy.

I thought this was a great recipe but I did cook and drain the bacon before throwing everything together. I just layed it over the chicken in the dish and it worked out fine. I also added minced green onions, thyme and rosemary and I served it with mashed potatos and buttered corn. The gravy was excellant. I'll make it again for a quick satisfying meal

My husband and I liked it, but definitely cook the bacon first or at least partially. I used 2 pieces per breast. Also added cheddar cheese when I removed the foil for the last 15 minutes.

This gets 4 stars because of how easy it is to make. I have tried pre-frying the bacon and turning the broiler on for the last 10 minutes or so to brown it and I have to say I prefer the taste of the original recipe. Too much bacon flavour is lost by pre-frying it. A lot of taste for not a lot of work.

I made this without the celery soup. Instead, I used cream of mushroom and used pre-cooked bacon and crumbled it on top. It tasted pretty good and was easy for a weekday meal.

I changed this recipe quite a bit by taking ideas from other reviews and also using my own. I put the chicken in the pan then covered it with lots of pre cooked bacon. Then fried onions in butter, once they were clear I added 2 cans mushroom soup to the pan. When it was mixed together and creamy I poured over the chicken and bacon. To top it off I sliced fresh mushrooms on top. This was really delicious.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!!  I opted to sautee the bacon wrapped chicken with a light spray of canola in a pan.  Then, proceeded with the recipe.  My family loved it over brown rice.

Did I follow the same recipe as everyone else?  People are raving about this dish and I thought it was "okay" at absolute best.  I browned the bacon a little like everyone recommended.  If you do this, render as much fat as you can because the way you put it in the oven is the way it will come out.  I used frozen veggies with it like another user, which I do NOT recommend unless you LOVE canned veggies because that's what they come out like: overcooked, mushy, and tasteless.  Now, the recipe itself sounded good and simple.  I just was not impressed at all, and I don't think I'm picky.  It didn't have much flavor, even with a very flavorful bacon that I love.  And adding only 1/4c. milk to the condensed milk led to a very thick, heavy sauce that I did not find pleasing at all.  Sorry,  I would not make this again at all.

I was a little worried about trying this meal, as my husband is very fussy...He LOVED it!! I read the reviews first, and decided to season the chicken and brown the bacon first. I used a Thai Herb mix, some garlic and cracked black pepper, I also pounded the meat. I didn't 'cook' the bacon first, just heated it in the frypan really. I added corn and celery before putting the Cream of Celery soup mix on top, and I left it in the oven for an extra 15 mins on top of the 50 (35mins covered, 30 mins uncovered all up). I served this on a bed of mashed potato with green beans on the side. Yum!

My husband and I loved this receipe. One suggestion: cook the bacon some before you wrap it around the chicken.  I wanted to eat the bacon with the chicken, but it did not quite cook all the way.  The chicken sure was tender and had an excellent taste though.

This recipe quickly became a family favorite. I loved how quick and easy it was, and the entire family (including 4 picky little ones) loved the taste. I used half a slice of bacon for each piece of chicken, and added more cream of celery soup to make more gravy. We served ours over rice and absolutely loved it...having it again tonight!

This recipe is very good!  I had to give it 5 starts since it's so quick and simple to fix.  I like it with cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup as well.  I have tried adding  a little fresh garlic and some sliced (canned) mushrooms and that turned out good as well.  If you have larger breasts you may want to use extra bacon.  We like this over rice, even my 1 and 2 year old liked it!!  I will definitely make this again.

I took others advice and browned bacon a little beforehand. I added a bag of frozen vegetables (broccoli, red peppers, mushrooms, and onions) and used cream of mushroom soup. Served over rice. My family loved it. Chicken was very moist.We will make again and try different soups and vegetables.

Great recipe.  The chicken was very tender (no knives required!) and it's a good idea to pre-cook the bacon before wrapping the chicken.  I also topped the chicken with sauteed mushrooms and onions before pouring on the soup and cooking.  My family loved this dish...including my VERY picky 3 year old.

This was pretty good stuff. But I honestly didn't see the point of the bacon. Despite seeing where one person thought it was overpowering, I could hardly taste it.  (And that's even given that bacon has a pretty strong flavor and is salty.) So I just thought it was a waste for all the fat. Cooking the bacon first would just add prep time to an otherwise super-duper easy & quick recipe.

Very good and super simple to make.  I made a couple of modifications.
1) Used Creame of Asparagus condensed soup
2) Used 150 ml of milk to keep the sauce a little thicker
3) Used 3 strips of Turkey Bacon for each piece of Chicken

Served with Vermacheli noodles

Great and easy!  This is the variation I did for what I had on-hand.  Cream of Onion soup and real bacon bits (instead of bacon).  Sprinkled bacon on chicken before topping with soup.  Also, added some pepper, minced garlic, and a little minced onion.  Was very pleased with results!

This is a hard one to rate for me.  We all liked it but it wasn't wonderful.  I gave it 4 stars because it's really easy and the chicken is really tender.  The flavor is good as well but it just seems like there is something missing.

I pre-cooked the bacon half way but after 45 minutes in the oven it was still chewy.  I'd highly recommend cooking the bacon all the way.  Chicken did stay moist.  Not enough sauce to put on our rice.

I made this in the crockpot when I forgot to take something out of the freezer and had no clue what to make. Threw the frozen chicken breasts in and poured the soup over it. I don't like using milk in the crockpot except for at the end and I just left it out. I used bacon crumbles instead and threw those in there with a can of water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes. I didn't eat it immediately and took mine to work for later...it smelled awful but the chicken was incredibly tender and it was actually very good. Will make this again every once in awhile.

This is a great recipe! Kris, you're a genius! I've made it twice, the first time I didn't grill the bacon, and the second time I did. It was good both times but better the second time when I grilled the bacon first. As well as making it nice and crispy, it seems to release more of the lovely bacon flavour into the gravy. YUM!!!!

Definitely cook the bacon a bit beforehand, but be sure not to overcook because it needs to be soft for wrapping the chicken. Easy recipe, good taste.  Thanks, Kris.

This was pretty good -- esp for how easy it was!  I took some of the other reviewer's suggestions and lightly cooked the bacon first.  My dish didn't turn out greasy at all, and the bacon was nice and crisp at the end!
I don't know if I will use the cream of celery soup again.  I think the taste would go better with cream of mushroom or cream of chicken, but it was still very good.  I will definitely make this again -- especially on nights when time is tight!  :-)

This is a  easy recipe. I chopped and fried bacon removed most of the drippings, then stirred in soup(cream of chicken) and milk plus some herbs. Poured over chicken and baked 30-40 minutes. It is thick you might want to add a little more milk.

I love bacon and chicken so I thought this recipe would be great..  but it was so greasy it was awful!  I'm sorry to be so negative about it It sounded delicious, but it wasn't at all..  maybe if you fry the bacon first and the put it on the chicken?  I was very disappointed with this recipe.

This recipe was okay. I will make it again as a quick fix it meal. Also another can of cream of celery would have helped alot as it didn't have enough gravy.

Not bad. Too much fat came out of the bacon and chicken breast though, which makes the sauce too greasy and not pleasant to look at. Chicken taste ok.

My whole family loved this recipe, even my man who hates bacon (he did give his bacon to me to eat but admitted it left a nice flavor). I turned my oven on broil for the last few minutes to make the bacon crispy but instead I burned it. Still gave the recipe 5 stars and I plan on trying again and again until I get it right because the recipe is GREAT!

This recipe received thumbs-up from the men in my home.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of celery, added some rosemary and used maple flavored bacon.  The bacon was a bit thick, however, so if you like crunchy bacon I'd recommend using thin sliced.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful with a hint of bacon flavor.  Delicious.  We'll definitely make again.

This was so yummy!  Not only that it is so easy.  Someone suggested frying bacon first but I think not because I think the juices from the bacon mix with the chicken and the soup and makes it yum yum.  My husband and mother loved this and so did I.  This tastes so gourmet and the thing is its so simple.  I was looking for a recipe with chicken that was gourmet like but didnt call for twenty ingredients.  This was definitely the chosen winner.  I might use more soup and bacon in soup next time to have more gravy for potatoes cuz it is so good.

I am a hopeless cook and yet I made this recipe twice for guests and they loved it.  I found that cream of leek and potato soup works very well and makes a divine sauce.  Also, after you wrap the bacon around the chicken, if you fry the pieces before you place them in the oven the bacon will be brown and crispy.  I loved this recipe.  Truly yummy!

Excellent as is or try it in a slow cooker -- simply place chicken in crock, pour other ingredients in, add bacon and stir.  Cook on low for 8 - 10 hours.  Fantastic!  I serve the "gravy" over cooked egg noodles.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. My bacon was not brown after the 15 minutes uncovered, so I turned my oven to broil at 450 and cooked another 10 minutes until the bacon browned.  The sauce was delicious served over mashed potatoes.  Hubby and 2 picky teenagers cleaned their plates!

The bacon wrapped around the chicken adds a nice flavor and the soup dose make a nice gravy to go over potatoes.  Putting this recipe together was very fast and easy!

I actually broil the bacon-wrapped chicken before baking the whole mixture, turning it once, to make sure that the bacon is crispy, and not soggy, when it's done.  Other than that, this is a great recipe.

My family and I enjoyed this. I did add about a half a tablespoon of garlic and cut the chicken into bite size pieces. I did this in a skillet and added a good bit of pepper to the chicken while cooking. I also used a 3 ounce bag of OM real bacon and two cans of cream of chicken soup and no milk. I cooked on the stove for about 20 minutes. Quick and easy dinner.

I liked this chicken a lot. I just wish I would of read the reviews about cooking the bacon first. I also didn't use cream of celery soup; I used cream of chicken since it is a chicken recipe and it was really good.

My family loved this! I think it might be a little better if you half cook the bacon first, but otherwise it was great.  I paired it with potatoes and used the gravy - so delicious!

Super easy and delicious recipe.  My girlfriend kept asking me how I did it.  AND it's low calorie and low carb.  I will definitely make this one again.

I made exactly as was written - it was edible, yes.  This basically steamed the chicken.  The "gravy" was very watered down.  Bacon didn't crisp at all even after uncovering and turning the oven up.  Not much flavor.  Was so excited to try it, but didn't even eat 1/2.

This was a very tasty dish.  I did pre-cook my bacon, but apparently not enough as it was still pretty chewy.  Next time, I think I will completely cook the bacon and put it on top.

Another simple yet tasty recipe!!  No big wows from it, but it tasted good and we liked it.  I used Campbell's Southwestern Pepper Jack Cheese soup on my chicken, then when removing the foil the last 15 minutes, I sprinkled Colby Jack Cheese on top.  I overcooked my bacon a little when precooking, so instead of wrapping it around the chicken, I just place it right on top.  I will be making this one again and again, trying different soups for a different flavor each time.

Great chicken! I used cream of chicken with herbs soup. Pre-cooked the bacon to wrap the chicken and added a couple of uncooked bacon and laid them across for extra flavor.

Easy and my family raved over it!! Just the right amount of gravy for the chicken and potatoes. I even used canned milk, and could not taste the difference. The gravy went perfect over the mashed potatoes as suggested and this is in my now in my recipe box!

Even my picky eaters loved this one! Lo Carb and great taste. Only thing I would change is to not use Cream of Celery soup and I'm going to try to brown the bacon a little bit before I wrap the chicken and bake.

My family loved this recipe.  A friend popped over and loved it so much she ate her serving and what was left of mine and left with the recipe....I did make a few changes based on reviews and my family's preferences.I sprinkled chicken with sage and oregano and crushed fresh garlic into the soup, cooked bacon and just laid it on top of chicken before  pouring soup mixture over it.....served with shredded cheese.....My daughter will hardley eat anything unless she sees cheese, and it was great this way......A great base recipe with tons of potential variations....Thank you

I did not enjoy this recipe very much. The soup did manage to keep the chicken very moist, but the flavor of the chicken was very bland. I would definitely recommend browning the bacon beforehand, as mine turned out limp and flavorless.

I gave this four stars because my husband and son liked it so much.  I personally would give it three stars. If I make it again, I would definitely brown the bacon a bit beforehand.  It was very easy and something I will probably make again.

This recipe is quick, simple & very yummy. The only change that I made to the dish was to take it out of the sauce & broil it for the last 10 minutes (about 5 minutes on each side) to crisp up the bacon. I noticed toward the end that the bacon was indeed cooking but was pretty soggy. I am all set with soggy bacon. The dish is great!
