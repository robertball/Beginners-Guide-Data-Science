Excellent, I used leftover chicken and it was great.

This turned out wonderful and looked so amazing on the table.  This dish has amazing table presentation.  Hubby thought that I spent a lot of time on this dish.  SHHH! What he doesn't know won't hurt him.  Will definatly make again.  I did use dried basil instead of fresh.  It was the only thing I had on hand.  Thanks for the post.

Discovered this recipe when looking for hot items for a Christmas buffet. I ended up making about a million of these during the Holiday season they were so popular. I flattened the chicken pieces cut each on in 3 strips and make bite sized bundles. I alternated using fresh basil and fresh sage leaves and when I was in TX I even used jalapeno. If I didn't have proscuitto available I used bacon. I provided all kinds of dipping sauces from basil cream to honey mustard but most people preferred them plain. Hot or cold.

I thought this was a great recipe. The flavors were tremendous. Served with the grilled portabello recipe also from this site, garlic parmesan bread and a nice mixed spring green salad with walnuts, pear, bacon and balsamic dressing. The flavors were outstanding. My husband really doesn't care for chicken breasts and didn't attack it like I did but still enjoyed the meal.

Really good! I used dried basil instead of fresh -- added about 1/4 teaspoon to each bundle. The only adjustment I'll make next time is to skip browning the chicken in my pan because the prosciutto stuck a little.

The chicken / proscuitto bundles themselves are wonderful - the sauce could use a little work.  I almost think a combination of Cream of mushroom soup, garlic, and sour cream would be better.  Good to experiment with!

I loooove this recipe! You can also put the prosciutto inside, if the breasts are large enough. Be careful to have the deli slice the prosciutto thinly--if it's too thick, the dish can be very salty. I use fresh mozzarella too.

My hubby said it is one of the best chicken he has ever had.  Definitely a keeper.  I used dry basil and just sprinkled some on the cheese.

This is a definite keeper!  My family requests this all the time!  The trick is to use fresh mozzarella and fresh basil and good quality Prosciutto (got mine at Costco and also at Trader Joe's).  Do sautee the bundles until crispy and brown, and then bake foir 15 mins, as directed.  You will not be dissappointed!

This recipe is excellent.  We've replaced the prosciutto with either bacon or a deli ham (the prosciutto can get expensive around here), and it's still good.  Basil's not my favorite, so it's usually left out.  Easy to make, and tastes yummy.

Great recipe. Really easy to put together and looks fantastic. I would make some kind of sauce to spoon on top next time - just a personal preference.

I messed up and used BAY leaves- don't do that!  I also realized I don't like prosciutto and it's VERY expensive.  It was okay though.
