Very good recipe. The grits was very creamy with just a hint of garlic....just right to me. If you like a stronger garlic flavor, you will want to increase the amount. Being from the South, however, and having cooked grits many times, I can tell you that the grits will be less lumpy if you put them into the water before you bring it to a boil.

I know that there are Velveeta haters out there but, honestly folks, it works well in this recipe.  I used the "light" version, it melted quickly, and gave these grits a mellow, cheesy taste.  The garlic flavor is subtle and was just right.  The grits were really runny at 25 minutes, so I baked an additional 15 minutes.  I made this to serve with a dinner entree, so I didn't want grits that needed to be spooned out of the dish...that's OK for breakfast but not what I wanted for a dinner side dish.  The consistency at 40 minutes was perfect:  firm, but still very moist and creamy.

I, like reviewer Joni, made Garlic Cheese Grits for years using the Kraft Garlic Cheese Roll.  Kraft discontinued making the garlic cheese roll and I went into mourning.  This recipe is very similar, very good.  The only changes I made were using two eggs instead of one, and using 1/4 tsp. garlic powder instead of the chopped garlic.
Hint 1:  To make smooth grits, as opposed to lumpy grits, when the water comes to a boil, slowly add grits while continuously stirring with a whisk.  
don;t forget to add the salt.  Whisk until grits come to a boil, then turn temp to low until grits are thickened and cooked, stirring frequently.  I place a lid loosely over the grits, because when the grits start to thicken the mixture can "pop up" and burn your arm.   
Hint 2:  It is important to temper the egg(s) before adding to the hot grits, or there will be scrambled egg pieces in the grits.  To temper egg(s), whisk egg(s) in a small bowl thoroughly.  Pour some of the grit mixture, about 1/2 cup, into another small bowl or measuring cup.  While whisking eggs, slowly pour the grit mixture until all is incorporated.  Then, add this mixture to the grits.
Lastly, I do prefer the processed cheese product for this recipe. (I know.)

My family has used a recipe just like this for the several years. It has become a standard at every holiday meal. We all love it, including my preschoolers.

Excellent, fast, easy side dish! I made bbq tilapia tonight and had this as my side dish. I am not a lover of processed cheese and like to keep calories low,  so I used taco flavored shredded cheese (1/2 cup tops). I only used 2 T butter and I sauteed the garlic in it and added it to the cooked grits. I mixed in the rest and baked. Even my picky husband loved it!

Delicious. With some minor personal changes (used less garlic so it would not overpower the children)...these came out very good.  My son loved it and requested I make grits like this all the time. Thanx.

Great recipe!  I would say to cook them longer than the recipe recommends, 25-30 mins.  Also, grits won't necessarily be "firm;" just make sure they're not too watery.

This recipe was an excellent addition to our Supper Club night.  It complemented everything that the other couples brought.  The recipe was so easy, and the end product was excellent!  I would not recommend any changes.

Excellent! Used two cloves of garlic, and it was VERY garlicky. I might add another egg next time, because we were hoping it would be a little fluffier.  It was perfect (to us) the next day, however. Definite keeper!

This is so much better if REAL cheese is used.   ugh that processed stuff.   A nice sharp cheddar is the way to go.   Yummy recipe.

We loved it!  I have used the same cheese garlic grit recipe for years and years, but Kraft quit making the garlic cheese I used for it, so I had to get a new recipe.  Everyone thought this was better than the one I had been using.  Glad to have changed!

Great tasty recipe!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I did end up cooking it a good bit longer than the stated amount for it to set up.

I made this *really* close to the original recipe, using 6 c of water and 1.5 c grits, and then using approx the amount of cheese it asked for in whatever cheeses I had on hand. I used garlic, and also chili-garlic sauce which gave it a tiny kick without making it spicy. I then baked it to perfection with a little browning on top. Too much delicious!

I've never really eaten grits before, I've certainly never cooked them before, but these grits are delicious. My sweetie said he's eaten grits in five different southern states and these were the best grits he's ever eaten in his life. They sure were good.

5 stars for flavor, but I'm only giving it 4 because mine didn't get "firm" until it had cooled to room temp. But if you don't care that they're runny, this stuff is delicious!

Baking time was 50 minutes, plus 10 minutes under the broiler.  I love regular grits but had never tried them baked/as a casserole.  I thought they were just okay but hubby liked them (he doesn't like regular grits).

Our family loved this recipe.  I cut the salt back to a heaping 1/4 teaspoon.  The garlic and cheese added enough flavor that we couldn't tell the any salt was missing.

This is an excellent receipe. It's the timing that is off. I've made it twice. The first time I thought I did something wrong. The second time I kept track of the time and the tem. In a conventional oven at 350 degrees, it took 60 minutes to puff and brown. 

Maybe the member who offered the receipe has a convection oven, I don't know. And maybe I should turn up the oven to 400 degrees. Hummm. What to do. Very tasty
