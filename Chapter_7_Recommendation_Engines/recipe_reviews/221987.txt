I made this for Christmas and everyone absolutely loved it! The asiago cheese is a great additional flavor. I did toast the croissants before topping with everything else, then again as directed. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Very easy and Delicious! The Asiago cheese worked perfectly along with the Asparagus!  We will definitely make this special recipe again!

I modified it a little, (Used European Brand center cut pork shoulder bacon) turned out amazing. My wife said it was the best Eggs Benedict she had ever had!

Your  P shouldn’t smell like asparagus on Valentine’s Day, sorry!   Sounds like a great spring/summer time recipe though.

Sounds great as written.  I had the croissants, no ham, no asiago, so...subs were..smoked salmon and more  heavy on the holandaise. Was yum, will try as written on next round
   Not all of us get ''asparagus pee''.  Funny thing !!  As a nurse the doc's used to laugh at all the chart reports of foul urine after a favorite dish was served similar to this recipe, to the patients.

I have not made this yet...However, trying to watch sodium intake, I looked and Boy I'm going to have to make major adjustments to this.....Sure wish you would feature Low/lower sodium content items!  Sounds great otherwise!!
