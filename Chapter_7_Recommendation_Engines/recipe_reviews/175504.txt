Here is what needs done to make these cookies fantastic!  Change the butter to 1/4 cup and add 1/2 cup Crisco.  Reduce the craisins to 4 oz. and change the white chocolate chips to 1 cup.  My students make these for our vocational food service class to sell and we can't keep them in the display case!  Everyone loves them!

Very tasty, however I did alter the recipe slightly after reading other reviews.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of butter because I was worried they would be dry. Turned out awesome!

I found this recipe very good.. just make sure to use butter..I used margarine and it didnt turn out nice at all. Butter made all the difference I also added 1/2 white choc chips and 1/2 dark chocolate chips.. couldnt keep these cookies in the tin.

I made this cookie for a Christmas party and it was a total hit... My husband even liked them and he isn't a cookie lover. I used walnuts instead of the white chocolate and they were sooo good. I will definitely make them again. I think this has now become my most favorite cookie... Thank you Ocean Spray

These are my husband's  favorite.  He thought they were to sweet, at first, so I omitted the white chocolate chips and put in peacans.  Wonderful with the cranberries.  They are now his absolute favorite cookie!

These are pretty good.  I frost them with a little bit of OJ mixed with confectioner's sugar. They are a little bit dry though....

These were awful! They need more of something; much too dry and crumbly. My kids would not touch them and they're boys - they eat anything! We won't use this recipe again.

Love these cookies!  They're always a hit.  I have changed the brown sugar to the Splenda brown sugar with perfect results.  Sprinkle with a bit of powdered sugar if you like a festive look.

I agree with several other reviewers the cookies was just too dry. Will attempt again with sukggestions of adding more butter and possibly adding some spices. The idea was good, but the cookies not so good.

These cookies are AWESOME. I have been making my kids lunchbox snacks from scratch, because they are both cheaper and tastier that way. These cookies are chewy, moist, and the flavors meld perfectly together-better than any bag of cookies I could have bought at the supermarket! The kids love them, and I will be making them again.

Tried these for the first time this year and I changed out the white chocolate and added no salt macadamia nuts cut in half in place of. They were so good...they were ridiculous...lol. You wouldn't expect such a fabulous taste from a cookie w cranberries. A definite cookie addition for every Christmas!  My entire family gobbled them up!!  Thank you Ocean Spray!!

This is a delicious cookie! It's not too sweet, just right with the white chocolate. I made two slight changes, I used fresh cranberries instead of dried and cut them in half and I added 1/2 stick more butter.

These were so good! The only change I made was to do 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup shortening. I make that switch in all cookie recipes. They were chunky and chewy. I love dired cranberries and white chocolate, so this was perfect!

To DRY. I will make them again but I think I'll add more butter & use a little less flour. I used Lindt white chocolate bars smashed up which were very good.

If the cookies were as good as the dough they would be a 6! But, the cookies were dry and lacked something. If I would try to make this again, I would use what the other feedback suggested.

I did not like these cookies at all.  I went right by the recipe and they were blah.  Not sweet enough and way too many cranberry's.  They did not spread out at all....just sat on the baking sheet in clumps and they had no taste hardly at all.  I would not recommend this recipe.  You will be wasting your time and $.

These were not what I was looking for.  I was hoping they would be a chewier cookie.  Thought they were a too bland also, needed a little something else.  Still searching for the perfect oatmeal/white choc/cranberry cookie.

The first time I made these I thought they were great. Then, over a year later I made them again and they were just so-so. I can't say exactly what I did differently; I used margerine (maybe I used butter the first time). It is also possible that I used whole wheat flour the first time. The second time, other than margerine, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a bit bland and disappointing.

I followed the recipe exactly and double checked because I thought that seemed like a lot of flour compared to butter.  They were dry and flavorless. I like the idea and will look for a similar recipe but won't make these again.

These turned out very well.  I added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground cloves to mine as I like oatmeal cookies to be like spice cookies.  Will definitely make again.

I have been making these cookies for years (found the recipe on the Ocean Spray website) and I think they are the BEST cookies ever! I love the tartness of the Craisins along with the white chocolate. So good!

Yum! Only two changes I made was add 1 tsp. of vanilla and I ground the oatmeal in my blender for a finer consistancy. (It's really just a family preferance, nothing wrong with the recipe as is.) 375* was too hot for these in my oven, the first batch burned. I tried the second set at 350* for ten minutes and that was perfect. I should have went with my gut and did that at first. Yummy cookie! NOTE: I bet this would be great with dried blueberries!

These are delicious!  I took the advice of many others and added extra butter.  They baked up beautifully.

I'm surprised at some of the poor reviews this recipe received. I followed it exactly except that I did substitute some wheat flour for the regular flour. I thought they turned out great!

These are really good!  Not too bad for you (well better than most cookies!) and they fill you up.  I just used 2 sticks of butter as the others mentioned and rounded everything off to 3/4 cup instead of 2/3's (what was that all about? I've never seen a recipe like that!) and they were great.

I have made these a number of times and they are always a hit.  After reading other reviews would also add I always use butter and I think that does help with moistness otherwise make exactly as the recipe is written.  I use a melon baller for measuring out the cookies and get close to 4 dozen cookies.  I have added chopped walnuts (about 1/3 cup) and is a nice addition.  I think coconut would be good as well.

Wow, either people really enjoyed these or thought they were terrrible!   My family really enjoyed them.
They are not an overly sweet cookie but a terrific balance.  I read alot of the reviews and decided to follow recipie exactly with the exception of just using a full cup of butter & I didnt experience any of the "dryness" others reported and they also came out looking just like the photo!  I couldnt have been happier.  Oh yeah I MIGHT have also been a little heavy handed when pouring in the white chocolate chips lol......yummy

I like gooey, chewy cookies that are crisp on the edges. These were just hard and dry! I substituted butter flavored shortening for the better and reduced the number of chips as one person suggested. Still pretty bad!

DRY- not hard but dry - like chewing sawdust - I cut back on the flour and added a ton of extra butter (not all at once)  as I altered the butter I would bake 2 or 3 to see what they would come out like - Never ever got a cookie that was good IMO - the hubby thought they were pretty good but dry also - I finally got a decent cookie when I flattened the cookie  - I did like the flavors just could get the right texture/consistency - gonna try the oatmeal cookie recipe on the oats carton and add cran & white choc chips n nuts next time
EDIT:  I would really love for someone to explain to me the why the reviews are so one side or the other - Did those of us who got a dry cookie do something wrong? I rally want this recipe to work because the flavors were good

Made these to go along with the pumpkin pie and apple pie for Thanksgiving dessert. Everyone loved them. The cookies baked up puffy and had a cake-like consistency. The craisins and white chocolate are a good combination. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are delicious and easy to make. If you don't want them to be too sweet don't put any white chocolate and a little more craisins that my favorite way to make them.

I thought this was a great recipe although I added a little more brown sugar to the butter for a sweeter taste. I did not have nearly the yield I expected with each batch I baked.
They were a hit at the office Christmas party---I thought I was going to be taking them home at the end of the day---but none were left!
Next time I make them I think I will try adding some walnuts and I might try adding the soda to the blended fluffy butter and sugar mixture to see if my results change instead of adding it to the dry ingredients.

These cookies are great! I didn't change the recipe at all and they were moist and delicious every time I've made them. The one thing I do differently with all of my cookie doughs is to form the dough into two long, skinny logs using plastic wrap. I then wrap the logs in aluminum foil and freeze. To bake, I unwrap the dough and slice into discs. That way, I always have cookie dough on hand and the cookies are uniformly round, much prettier than dropping from spoons. The cookies tend to need some additional baking time after freezing but they are never crumbly or dry. I love these cookies because it combines two of my favorite things - oats and cranberries!

Okay, like a lot of others I too changed this recipe. I didn't really measure things though, just kept mixing in until it looked about right. I added extra butter-probably between 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup total, I added a "dab" more oatmeal, instead of the Ocean Spray Craisins I used a 6 oz pkg of mixed dried berries (cranberries, golden raisins and cherries), an extra 1/4 cup or so of dried cranberries and dried cherries, and about a 1/2 cup of flaked coconut. I increased the white choc chips to 2/3 of a 12oz bag. I think this would also be good with a little finely chopped pecans for those that like nuts. It is really awesome....my hubby loves these. He took some to work and now I keep getting request for more.

I made these according to the recipe since that was what I was going to rate. They were terrible!! Although I love cranberries and white chocolate, these were dry and didn't have much taste. Even my teenage son wouldn't eat them.

I made 4 changes to this recipe. I didn't have white chocolate and used semi-sweet chips, added 1 tsp. of vanilla, refridgerated the dough till it was hard, and decreased the temperature. When cooking at 375, the cookies started to burn on top while the inside was still very soft. I decreased it to 365, which I normally cook my cookies, and they baked better for me. As for the taste, it was good but do agree with the others that they were a little on the dry side.

The first time I made these as written (except was adding craisins from a jumbo bag, so I just added the amount that looked right without measuring).  They turned out rather bland, not sweet enough, almost salty.
I just made them again, increasing the sugar by 50% and adding grated orange peel and a few tablespoons of orange juice, plus more craisins than last time.  They were better, but almost too sweet.  However they were still too floury/cakey, so next time I'll try adding more butter.
The idea of the recipe is good, it just needs a bit of tinkering to make it truly great.

I found these to be very good!  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract to the batter.  I used the white chocolate morsels because that's all I had, but I think next time I will use the white chocolate chunks for a little more flavor.

Good cookies.  Needs vanilla, more oats and some baking powder to help give some lift.

I accidentally only used 1/2 cup butter.  I omitted salt, used a little less craisins, a little more white choc chips and thought they were not bad.  I love dark choc much more than white, so that likely played a role in my preference

Based on comments, I thought i'd go back to tried and true recipes for a guideline. Think about Toll House cookies or the Quaker Oats cookie recipe, and go by those ratios and amounts. Also, add vanilla to this! It needs a tsp. of vanilla. So I also used 2 sticks of butter, equal amounts of brown sugar and white sugar (I think 2/3 c. of each is plenty), 3c of oats, and left everything else the same in this recipe except I decided to use most of the bag of chips. These were never meant to be low fat anyway, so why not make them turn out great!? These were great with the changes.

I added a little extra brown sugar (which they needed) and added ground flax meal to make up for the dryness that others commented on. Also added cinnamon, vanilla, and semi sweet chocolate chips. They were good after my additions!

I've been making this recipe for years - ever since I got it off the back of the dried cranberry package.  I add 1/3 c. butter to be 1 c. total and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I always get tons of compliments on these.

As written this is not very flavorful and dry. The ratios of butter to dry ingredients are off. I changed it to increase the butter, plumped the cranberries in orange juice and added that mixture once cooled to the wet ingredients so as not to cook the eggs. I also added a tablespoon of freshly grated orange zest. Those cookies turned out great but that is not this recipe. I also used quick cooking oats too - blends much better.

For something that looks so yummy, I could not be more disappointed.  These cookies have no flavor at all.  I'll go back to my regular oatmeal cookie batter and try adding the craisins instead of raisins.  They need something.  Vanilla?  Cinnamon?

These are great-but if you don't add just a little extra butter and a little extra sugar, they will dry out quickly. I found them to actually taste better after they sat for a day. At first they came out very dry. The next day they seemed moist. Strange, but what can I say?

I loved this, but I did motify to make it a little healthier.  The first thing I did, was to use butter flavored crisco instead of butter.  The other thing I did was to substitute 1/2 cup of flour with a 1/2 cup of milled flax seed.  Also, I only used 2-cubes of white chocolate.  All I did was cut the cubes up into shavings.  They are a HUGE HIT with all of my kids and my husband.  Yummy!

I did not care for these cookies. I gave them 4 stars cause the reason I didn't like them was cause they tasted like butter really bad and I used 1 cup of butter like others suggested so I didn't want to bring down the rating of the recipe since I didn't follow it exactly. My husband ate these and he told me he liked them but I don't know if he was just being nice or if he actually did like them. I want to make these again cause I love cranberries and white chocolate together but I will use the amount of butter it says and hopefully they won't be so bad then. With 1 cup of butter these cookies are only 2 stars and I almost always give everything I try 5 stars. Do not add extra butter unless you like to eat butter cookies.

I would not recommend this recipe. Something isn't right with ingredients in that the cookies taste way too bland, are crumbly and a little dry, even cooking them less time than recommended. This recipe needs alot more sweet, alot more moist and be careful if you plan to bake them at 375 as they will burn on the bottom easily before you think they are done.

I was not impressed.  It didn't have the same texture as a true oatmeal cookie.  Perhaps too much flour or too many spins with the kitchenaid?  I'm guessing you mix just enough to get the ingredients wet, but the instructions make no mention of this.  I added extra butter per the other reviewer's suggestions due to the dry nature of the cookies, but thought the cookie tasted too much like butter.  I'll keep searching for the perfect white chocolate oatmeal cranberry recipe because this isn't it.

Well, this recipe is tasty, but as stated in some of the other reviews, the mixture is VERY dry.  It will come out the same shape you make it before baking, so if you make it into a ball, you'll get a "ball" cookie.  So, just put lumps of the mixture on the baking sheet and you'll get about what is in the picture.  I love Craisins, but I agree there are too many.  The cookie is basically craisins with a little oatmeal cookie around them.  Personally, I would say add more butter and take away some flour.  I've definately had better.

Tasty, not-too-sweet cookie.  I took the advice of others and increased the butter to just under a cup.  I also reduced the cranberries by half (3 oz.), and substituted the other 3 oz with chopped walnuts.  Yum!

I liked how the cookies weren't too sweet and used less butter compared to other recipes. I ground the oatmeal into coarse powder and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract. 

Cookies were already browning in 8 minutes so I lowered the temp to 350 for 11 minutes instead and thought they turned out better. Will still look for a different recipe though.

This is pretty good.  The cookies are kind of "mealy" since there's a LOT of sugar in them, but the oatmeal takes a lot of that out.  They were a big hit with friends and family and make excellent Christmas presents!
