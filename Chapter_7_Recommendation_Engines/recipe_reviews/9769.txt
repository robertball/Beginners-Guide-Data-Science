This was a soft, delicious cookie.  Made a few changes; pressed the moisture out of the shredded zucchini with paper towels, added just a tad more flour and oats.  Cookies remained high and very tender.  Will definitely make again.

these cookies were kind of hard to get off the sheet, might want to grease it really well...also was pretty flat and fell apart. i substituted chocolate chips for the nuts, and left everything else the same. flavor was really good, just need to figure out how to keep it together!

This is a good soft cookie, I added a couple of tbls more of oatmeal, because the texture was too soft. I did not flatten them as the recipe suggested, it baked up very nice, I did bake for a couple of minutes more for a golden color. My husband liked them, so thats good.

This is a unique way to use extra zucchini.  I made these to take camping and they were very good.  I am keeping this one!

Sorry, but I didn't care for this one.  These cookies had little to no flavor - something was missing.  Also, the cookies came out completely flat and had to be scraped off the cookie sheet.

These cookies are awesome!  Very moist and incredibly healthy so you can feel good about feeding them to your family.  I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  I have now harvested 125 zucchini from my little garden this year and will give this recipe out with my squash (that is if people don't run when they see me coming with my bag full of zucc's) hee hee

These were easy to make and turned out good but there was something missing. The taste was bland, using raisins, nuts and zuchinni, I thought there would be more flavor.  Next time I will add more spice; perhaps coconut or lemon,  I think experimenting with these could produce a really great cookie.

Very moist.  I followed the directions with the exception of substituting lemon essence for the vanilla and I added two tablespoons of flax seed.  Very moist and I do like them, but I would add a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg just to jazz them up a bit.  I will be keeping this recipe - great way to use up zucchini and have cookies with lots of healthy ingredients.

Pretty good. I follow the recipe except added some unsweetened grated coconut (I wanted to use it up).  Maybe next time I will not add the coconut.  The texture was more cakey than cookie like. I will make a get but with changes.

These cookies had little flavor.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening and I was glad I did because the only thing I really tasted was a bit of honey and a little butter.  I even tried adding some spices after I baked 2 sheets and realized they were nearly flavorless.  I didn't think the spices did much either.  I don't plan to make these cookies again.

This was not a great recipe. My family did not like it. It took a lot longer to cook then recipe called for ..at least 20 min. The cookie was flat and spongy and rather tasteless. We added choc. chunks and it kind of saved it, but I would not make this one again.

Baked according to directions not diverting from the original.  Needed a bit more salt.  Personally, I think I would prefer a recipe that used sugar instead of honey.

Used Agave instead of honey. Used chocolate chips instead of nuts. Used gluten free flour.  Halved the amounts. Turned out  well and tasted good.

Way too wet to bake as a cookie...this is more like a cake batter. Very disappointing but this recipe is missing something...like more flour! I even drained the zucchini for 1 hour to reduce liquid and batter was still really wet. I added flour to make the batter thicker but the cookies taste doughy. What a bummer!
