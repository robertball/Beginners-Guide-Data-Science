This was the best Potato and Cauliflower Cassorole ever!  I did add a couple of tweaks - first, I was out of cauliflower so I substituted broccoli.  And I only had potato flakes so instead I used some onion.  And rather than use a casserole dish I cooked on top of the stove in a fry pan!!! Wait - just kidding, kinda making fun of a couple other reviews of this recipe!  I made this exactly as is (except I honestly never actually measure ingredients) and it came out GREAT.

I have to say, my 16 year old was so mad when I told him that it was cauliflower..."MOM, I HATE CAULIFLOWER!" Then he tasted it, (making an ugly face the whole time) and tasted it again, and then again...when it was all said and done, he probably ate at least 1/3 of the casserole...too funny!  It was really good. I will make this again and again. Oh yeah, I boiled the potatoes and steamed the cauliflower at the same time (over the potatoes in a basket).

Excellent recipe, I didn't have heavy cream, so I used milk.  Also, I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used 1/2 cup velveta and 1/2 cup romano and it turned out wonderful. Thank you for another way to serve old favorites.

I make this casserole all the time! Although I use milk instead of cream for the bechamel sauce, it tastes truly delicious -a real comfort food! I add a grating of nutmeg and dry bread crumbs on top in addition to the cheese, and pass it under the broiler for a few minutes for a little crispiness... My husband adores it.

This is one of the best potato casseroles I've tried.  I have not changed anything but this weekend when I make it for another potluck, I will add precooked chicken. Thank you so much.  I've made this three times in three weeks for different occassions.  I get more compliments on this dish.

Good base recipe.  I also added dry mustard and nutmeg.  Substituted milk for the cream and also used 2 cups of sharp cheddar instead of swiss.  Came out great.

The recipe "as is" is too bland for me. I omitted swiss cheese. I used parmesan in the flour/cream mixture, as well as adding fresh garlic and rosemary. I used cheddar cheese on top. It is delicious!

My family really loved this recipe. I used frozen cauliflower, three potatoes and fat free half and half to cut down on the fat. Delish and thanks!

Good idea...you just need to modify it to your tastes.  I doubled the white sauce and added powders and spices for flavor.  Always looking for a different way for cauliflower and this was great.  As a vegetarian, I appreciate finding simple and tasty combinations on vegetables to make a more filling meal.

This was so good, it's 2 days after I made it the 1st time and I am making it again. We do not eat all that much cauliflower, it's just this recipe.
The only changes I made were, I used an orange colored cauliflower they had at the market (which added nice color to the dish), I added more milk when the sauce looked too thick and I used a little more swiss.
Not only was it excellent, it was Christmas / Thanksgiving, most important dinner company you ever had excellent!!

Was looking for something different but yet hearty and good - this was it.  I was surprised at how tasty this recipe was - the combination sounded a bit odd - but it was excellent!  Many requests from kids/husb to fix again.  
(I used half cream and the other half milk - prolly would be just fine with all milk too.)

This is just a basic Mornay sauce over vegetables.  Simple and good as a side dish.  There isn't any need to add anything else (not even salt), but if you wanted to kick up the flavours a bit, I would suggest adding a tsp of dijon mustard (or even yellow mustard) to kick up the cheese).  1/2 tsp of ground sage would also intensify the flavours.

Pretty good, but not nearly as tasty as Broccoli and Cauliflower Casserole submitted by Bridget on this site. We'd rather have the nutrition of broc too! I used some extra-sharp Cheddar as well as Swiss. Thanks!

This came out really well.  The only change I made was to use white cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  Served it with pork steak. Next time I may just cube the steak and mix it into the casserole.

This was really tasty and quite filling but I think to make it more flavourful you should consider a few adjustments. What I did: sprinkled bread crumbs, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and rosemary on top and broiled for 2 min at the end to give it a crispy crust. Also, I used milk, not cream, and added about a 1/4 c. coconut milk to the sauce to increase the creaminess. Delicious!

This is a good recipe, but a little bland as is. I used milk instead of heavy cream, and added a little more for moisture. I think next time I will add nutmeg for flavor. Overall a good side dish though.

I tried this to use a head of cauliflower that I bought at the farmer's market, but I think there are better uses for my cauliflower.  It was just OK.  It needed something else, more flavor.  I guess you could modify it somehow, but I'm not impressed enough to give it another shot.

Great dish!  I used blue cheese instead of swiss and my husband and I loved it!  I suggest trying this with blue cheese if you are a blue cheese fan - there is a lot of flavor! Thanks for the recipe :)

The combination of potato and cauliflower is good for both vegetables. Cauliflower is not my favorite veg, and I am always looking for an interesting way to serve it. I have fixed this recipe a number of times now, and adjust it to what I have on hand. I generally have about equal amounts of potato and cauliflower, and I use milk to make the white sauce rather than cream. I think the cheese adds enough richness to the sauce, and the cream just adds extra calories. I live in Japan, and Swiss cheese is just too expensive to use for this type of recipe, so I use the more affordable cheddar.  This side dish is quite rich, so I generally serve with a main dish that is not overly sauced - grilled meat or fish - and a green salad. I am also careful not to make too much - the leftovers tend to hang around too long. Thank you very much for a great way to fix cauliflower!

I used sliced onions instead of potatoes & didn't even pre-cook the cauliflower. Very good, liked crumbs on top, and very versitile.

Pretty good, but could use a little oomph. The Swiss I bought to make the casserole was halfway gone by the time I got around to making this dish, so I used Swiss in the casserole and Italian blend on top.  Also sprinkled with bread crumbs and broiled for a minute or two at the end of the baking time.  I did have to use more liquid for the sauce; very thick.  This calls for 3-3-1 butter-flour-milk and I usually at least start with 1-1-1.  Next time:  use half potatoes and half cauliflower; add onions and celery; maybe mushrooms.  This is a good base recipe for a veggie casserole and offers good instructions.  Oh, and I managed to use one pan plus my steamer (plus the casserole dish, of course).  Not that I'm lazy or anything...but honestly, this uses a lot of pans!

This was a great hit with my family and in fact there wasn't a drop left.  I didn't have cream so I used milk with a couple of spoons of sour cream to thicken.  I took the suggestions of a couple of reviewers and added a bit of nutmeg, and used panko bread crumbs for crunch.  My family likes just a little spice to our dishes so I also added a few drops of hot pepper sauce.   The best cauliflower I've had in a long time.  I will make this dish again.

I wanted to make a "au gratin" verus casserole so I thinly sliced my potatoes and boiled them with the cauliflower for 5 minutes.  I used half and half+milk, but ended up needing 1/2 c more milk b/c the cheese makes it *too thick*. Recommend: 2 T butter/flour, milk and not cream, sprinkle 1/2 of the cheese over potatoes/cauliflower and then pour white sauce over all.  Top with remaining cheese, bread crumbs, and drizzle olive oil over all.

This was very good- however not very good for you.  I made some substitutions- 1% milk instead of heavy cream, cut the butter down by half, used reduced fat shredded taco cheese (all I had in the fridge- added some color and tasted great).  Will make again:)

I love this recipe! I use a strong swiss like appenzeller or gruyere. I have also added broccoli--yummy!

What a great recipe. Nice change from my standard cheese potatoes. I made this for Easter the first time last year, everyone raved, I made a couple additions, to the bechamel I added dry mustard, and a pinch of nutmeg. For the cheese Gruyere, has a sharpe nutty flavor. Red potatoes with skins on or baby reds. I make enough for a 13x9 pan . Dont have to worry
 about leftovers pan is always clean. thank you

This was OK.  Luckily I tasted the sauce before adding it to the vegetables.  It was bland, so I added two tablespoons of dijon mustard which helped.  Don't know if I'll make again.

Ultimate comfort food on a cold fall day.  Added one more potato and a bit more pepper to taste.  Family loved it -- and they are not great vegetable eaters.  Was kind of like macaroni and cheese with the cauliflower and potatoes playing the macaroni role.  As such, I think it would be pretty tasty with bits of ham mixed in.  Will try that next time as this is surely a keeper' And really really easy to make' Thanks, Primarygr'

Yes, I had to substitute Velveeta cheese for the Swiss cheese. I’ve made it several times and it is always a winner for Thanksgiving.

Very heavy.  Used milk instead of cream, 4 potatoes and 1/2 head cauliflower with cheddar cheese.  Good but rich and too much quantity for 3.

I liked the cheese/cream sauce as a base but I thought it was too bland. I even added some marjoram and old bay but I guess it wasn't enough. I used russet potatoes and found I needed about four to balance the whole head of cauliflower. Also it a lil took longer to steam/boil potatos but that was ok. My fiance really liked this dish so I might try again but I would really like to find a good spice blend.
Also I wanted to point out that I found heavy cream could be substituted with 3/4c milk and 1/4c butter, which is what I ended up using with freshly shredded swiss cheese.

Definitely needs something.  I think the calories with the buter/cream/cheese is a waste because it is so bland I even added parm cheese and red pepper flakes and still bland.  I will stick with my cauliflower, oliveoil, parm cheese, and bread crumbs tossed in a bad then melt cheddar cheese at the end... easier and no cream

Great recipe.  Our whole family loves it.  My 3 year old can't get enough of it and it's a great dish for my 1 year old too!  I'm about to make it for my mother right now.

I made this dish to accompany the Carmelized Chicken recipie. Read all the reviews prior to starting, and decided that I needed to add a little onion, garlic, and parm cheese. While the dish looked beautiful, I agree with one of the reviewers that it is not seasoned enough. Taste is just okay. Great if you need a starch fix, but lacks the wow factor. It needs something, but I'm just not sure what. It was very easy to make, so I would love to find that much needed ingredient. BF suggested bacon, but I would love to keep it a vegetarian-friendly dish, as my son does not eat pork.

This was so delicious and filling. I substituted milk for the heavy cream and added seasonings (rosemary, garlic, and parsley). Broiled with a bit of breadcrumbs at the end. I will definitely make this again!

This was great.  I used frozen cauliflower and red skin potatoes.  Simplified everything.  Just fixed the sauce in my cast iron, added the veggies and cheese and baked for 30 min.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I plan to use this again.

This is a good basic recipe.  It was a fine dish, and I enjoyed it.  DH found it bland.  It's not something I would serve to guests.

I made some modifications based on what I had available, and on the other reviews.  I used unpeeled red potatoes, medium cheddar instead of swiss, and had no cream, so I used milk.  It didn't suffer at all for the milk.  The cheddar flavor was nice, but I felt it still needed something.  Next time, I will try this with fresh bacon crumbles and feta mixed in.  It was a nice variation on cauliflower, and my daughter ate the cauliflower here.

This was okay.  Probably not make it again.  My swiss was rather mild. Maybe if my cheese had a stronger flavor I might have enjoyed it more.
