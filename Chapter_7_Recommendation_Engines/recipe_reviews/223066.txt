If my photo of this bread looks a little on the flat side, it's because I halved the recipe using the loaf pan size called for.  We really enjoyed this bread with our morning coffee today!  I love the little bit of sweetness provided by the topping, and I especially appreciate that it's not a crumbly topping that falls off the bread like it does on so many muffins.  I will make this again very soon but with the full size!  We loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE:  I made a double batch yesterday, this time using the whole recipe.  Be careful if you tend, like me, to get carried away with how many nuts and how many blueberries you put in!  While it turned out delicious, I am now busy cleaning out my oven for what overflowed!  I should have used my better sense and noted that when it was going past the 3/4 mark on my pans, I should have changed to a bigger size.  But it still is delicious.

This is definitely the best banana bread I've ever made. Easy to make, and everyone that has tried it, loved it as well.  I followed the recipe except for the nuts. Thanks for a great recipe!

Tasty, a great idea to use applesauce instead of oil too. I also omitted the nuts, halved the sugar, and used a gluten-free all purpose flour. These turned out to be delicious and quick to disappear!

1.24.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223066/blueberry-banana-nut-bread/ ... Good.  I subbed plain yogurt & sour cream for the Greek yogurt & applesauce; regular flour, same measurement.  The brown sugar & butter topping is a nice addition.  It doesn't fall off like usual toppings that have flour.  'Only issue I might have is that if it doesn't get eaten soon, it will be moldy.  It's very moist with all those berries.  I baked it 15 minutes longer.  'Thinking I might try subbing with some cranberries next time.  The brown sugar topping was fine day one & two, but just added more sugar after that & less would be fine.  I'll do without next time.

It's blueberry season here in Michigan and I wanted a recipe to use some of the large, flavorful berries I recently picked.  I had a banana that was overly ripe so this recipe was perfect.  This bread is moist and flavorful made exactly like the recipe is written.  Because my blueberries were so large, I had strong blueberry flavor throughout.  I would make this again, whenever I have blueberries that need to be used up.

The loaf came out ok but it tasted more like a banana bread rather than a blueberry bread. I thought the addition of the bananas would have enhanced the flavor but instead they it over. I am not sure how to counter the effect. Maybe next time I will try cutting down the bananas and by the same amount I cut the bananas I will add that much more apple sauce to keep the moisture content.  The crumb topping was EXCELENT!

This is a yummy bread recipe.  I made one minor change and that was using blueberry yogurt instead of the plain Greek Yogurt. I did find that I needed to cook the bread an additional 15 minutes.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thank you for submitting.

I love this recipe. It’s cake rather than bread to us. I made one main substitution, I used 2/3c of old-fashioned rolled oats instead of 1/2c steel-cut. I used steel cut the first time and didn’t like the consistency (my teeth hated biting down on the hard oat). I used more just because it was all I had and no reason to toss such a small amount of oats. I also used all purpose flour in the same amount as the cake flour (because this non-baker doesn’t have cake flour on hand). Finally, I added a handful of chopped pecans to the brown sugar crumble on top. Also, just because I had them and I love toasted pecans. Delicious, and I keep this as a favorite. Thanks to the creator!

This is great recipe for using up soft bananas and summer's abundant blueberries. I used gluten-free flour, 1/2 organic brown sugar and one half stevia. I also added dash of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinammon.  After it cooled down, I put it in a plastic bag on the counter. Hubby and I went out for the day. When I came home, it was gone! Love it when family members eat healthy with no prompting!

I have made this twice. It is a one stop breakfast. The nuts add a nice crunch. It is important to get the wet items right; the time i used too much applesauce and blueberries it was more of a pudding. Still tasty!

06.30.17 ~ A lot of ingredients, but a nice bread.  I didn't have cake flour, so I used King Arthur's® AP flour and I thought it worked fine.  This has steel cut oats in it and I've never tried that in a bread.  It worked.  I liked that the recipe used applesauce and Greek yogurt rather than oil.  I baked it in mini (6 x 3 1/2) bread pans and got six loaves.  Enough to share with many people.  I have many fresh-frozen blueberries in the freezer, so I know I will be making this one again.  I did use frozen berries right from the freezer without thawing for this recipe.  I thought the texture of the bread was fine with the frozen berries.  We really enjoyed this toasted.  My DH added butter to his.

It took a bit of work to make, but it was delicious!  I used 2 bananas, blueberry yogurt, and a cut up apple which I boiled a bit to make it soft, then chopped.  We served it with whipped cream or ice cream warm as a dessert.  Wonderful!
