I found this when searching for recipes using chick peas (had leftovers from a batch cooked in crockpot).  Sounded interesting so gave it a try.  Glad I did!  I'll make it again.  I did increase the spices quite a bit after tasting finished dish...didn't measure, just "palmed it".  Have to admit that the aroma while cooking had me wondering if I'd made a mistake...the combination of spices smelled kinda strange to me, did again when opening leftovers, but I do like the flavor.  It's one of those flavors that I found growing on me more with each bite.  Increasing the spices considerably didn't drastically change the flavor as much as I thought it would...even though I could feel the beginning of heat in my mouth.  Sent leftovers with daughter for school lunch today...waiting to see what she thinks.  I used raisins and think that, like others, they add a definite depth to the flavor that's important (and I usually don't care for raisins much).  Didn't have any pine nuts so couldn't add those, but will definitely next time...and there will be a next time.  Thanks for the recipe!!  I've been looking to increase our use of quinoa.  UPDATE  I changed the rating to a 5.  My daughter really likes this for her school lunch.  I've made it a few more times and have added pine nuts...they do add another layer of flavor/texture that we like.  This is going into our regular rotation making sure to cook for leftovers.

5 STARS ALL THE WAY!  This was absolutely delish.  I am very impressed.  We will definitely add this to our regular rotation!  I didn't have garbanzo beans, so I used spicy black beans.  I doubled the spices and used half to season 3 chicken breasts then grilled them on the Foreman grill.  Sliced and served chicken on top.  The raisins add a burst of sweetness with the spiciness, and it's so YUM!!  What a meal.

This was amazing and I would highly recommend it.  All the flavors come together very well.  I highly recommend including the raisins.  I added some cayenne to spice it up a bit, and topped it with parsley (cilantro would be good too).  Make a big batch and eat all week.

I realized halfway into the recipe that I didn't have broth, so I used water and it worked just fine. I also didn't have garbanzo beans and used pinto beans instead. I think you could use any mild canned beans in a pinch.

Delicious!  Quinoa (pronounced keen-wa) is a whole grain and one of the most nutritious.  This is a great way to serve it.  I loved all the textures and flavors - I agree with another reviewer that the raisins should definitely be in it.  I don't think you need to add the additional salt - there is enough salt in it from the chicken stock. Definitely will make again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is now my husband's favorite meal.  I've used dried cherries instead of raisins, and they work well too.

Very good.  I made this for a vegan friend of mine (so used water instead of broth).  I made the following substitutions and it turned out well: - used Craisins instead of raisins - used pecans instead of pine nuts - didn't have curry powder, so increased the cumin Overall, it was flavorful and yummy.  We'll probably make it again.  Also: my 11 month old baby liked it too.

I was looking for a dish that used quinoa, and this satisfies my desire for both high fiber and high protein. This tasty dish relies on the spices added for the great flavor, so it's low in calories. I ended up using pinto beans instead, and it still tasted great. It didn't take me anywhere near 45 minutes either. Great recipe.

This was one of the N*R "runner-ups", so I decided to try it.  It was pretty good - the pine nuts and raisins make it, in my opinion - they add extra levels of flavor and texture.  I'm not a big curry powder fan, so next time I will switch the quantities of curry powder and cumin, and maybe add some coriander or other spices.  Overall a tasty dish!  Had this with some steamed spinach for a light but satisfying supper. N*R

Loved this "salad"! I made it for a gathering of women and many of them really liked it and even asked for the recipe. I ate it both warm and cold and both were good. I agree with the many folks who said don't forget the raisins. I didn't soak mine ahead of time because the extra broth did the job. I suggest waiting to just before serving to toss the pine nuts in so that they don't get mushy. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm sorry it took me so long to make this. I had all the ingredients in my pantry, super easy and a great alternative to rice as a side dish. I'll make this again for sure!

I made this dish today with Veggie Stock instead of Chicken Stock and 1/4 cup of mixed raisins, 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts instead of pine nuts and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it was really really tasty. I still have 3 servings left for the next couple days since it makes 4 servings.  I highly recommend this dish!

This might be the only one-star rating I've left. Possibly, it's because we don't like quinoa, although this is the only time I've tried it so it's hard to tell. The flavors did not marry well, and all we could taste was curry.

Very good!  I used dried cranberries, and since the pine nuts are something close to $30/lb, I opted to use walnuts (that I oven-toasted at 350 degrees for 10 minutes).  I doubled the cinnamon, cumin and garlic amounts.  I first ate it warm and thought it was good.  Then, ate some a few hours later after it had been in the fridge and thought it tasted even better!

My husband said this was the first time in his life garbanzo beans had tasted good!  Quick, easy, nutritious, fairly inexpensive with delicious aroma--definitely deserves a second making.

This is very very good. I made as is with the exception of the pine nuts. The garbonzo beans were still firm, so there's the crunch I needed. The flavors are very good. I hope to make this again.

Tasty!  I doubled all of the spices as recommended (I used a combo of regular and hot curry powder to add a little extra spice), and used a medium onion an entire 14.5oz can of chicken broth.

MMM this is delicious!! I left out the raisins and chickpeas and it didn't seem to make too much of a difference as some of the other reviews suggested. I used veggie broth instead of chicken it tasted fantastic! If you live in an apartment, this recipe will make the whole building smell of curry!!!!!

Mmmmmm, this was so good.  I made the following changes: used homemade veggie broth instead of chicken broth,  2 tsp curry powder, and golden raisins.  Also, I only added about 2/3 can of chick peas, as I thought it was too much.  This was plenty filling for our main dish (we had it with a salad).  It will definitely be added to our rotation!

Love this recipe - I doubled the spices, as I normally do - used it as a main dish.  Definitely a keeper - I might try using a olive oil/white wine vinegar mix for a little more moisture next time - very hearty and filling with a good opportunity to add extras, like shredded carrots or peas.

This was alright. I didn't put the raisins in; maybe that would have made it better. But it wasn't as flavorful as the name implies.  Still, a good, basic dish :)

Great! I've always loved quinoa and always looking for new recipes. Even my husband, who claims he "dislikes" quinoa, smelled this cooking and just couldn't resist. He loved it! I substituted chopped almonds for the pine nuts (we're broke!) and added another diced clove of garlic at the end, as we are garlic-fiends.  I think next time, I will cut down on or omit altogether the salt, as it was quite salty.

Absolutely Delicious. Best Quinoa Ever, and we eat quinoa once a week.  I doubled the spices, and added a little cayenne.  Instead of Raisins I used chopped dates which I soaked in hot water, then used the sweet water as a base for a vegetable bouillon instead of chicken broth. I really can't say enough good things about this recipe. If you are wanting to introduce quinoa to someone, this is the dish that will win them over.

This was so much better than I thought it would be. I have never eaten quinoa before and this was a wonderful introduction to it. I followed the recipe exactly. You definitely do need the raisins. We ate it hot last night and I ate it cold for breakfast this morning. Perfect!

It turned out really good for the first time! I doubled the curry and cumin,halved the cinnamon and added crushed red pepper flakes to make it spicy. I also added some of the sweet water I soaked the raisins in, because it didn't seem to have enough liquid towards the end of cooking. I will definitely make it again. Thank you for posting it!

This was out-of-this-world amazing!  I didn't change a thing, except for substituting veggie broth.  If possible, it tasted even better the next day as leftovers.

This was really good- I added kidney beans and chopped cilantro as suggested by others. I actually made a second batch for left overs tomorrow.

A great basic recipe.  Don't hesitate to add other veggies (I love peas in curry!) and a lean chicken breast cubed.  So simple.  I now make extras for leftovers, and everyone at work is jealous :)

This is edible, but it's not something I want to make again. I added the raisins since everyone seemed to like them in this dish, but I don't know that they added anything, and the spices seemed to be off-clashing instead of coming together to make something enjoyable.

Delicious, fixed just as the recipe shows! We ate it immediately as a lunch, but I can see that it would be great as a cold salad or served as a side dish.

This is a very good side dish.  I was excited to make this because it has so many of my favourite ingredients.  Quinoa, curry, chick peas.  I love quinoa and how versatile it is.  The flavours are good together.  Don't pass up the raisins.  I was going to, but at the last minute threw them in too.  There isn't a lot, so they just add a little bit of sweetness to every few bites.  Will definately make this again.

Yum! The flavors and textures in this dish are really well balanced. The only substitute I made was toasted almonds instead of pine nuts. I'm really excited to have this for lunches this week. The extra bonus is that my house smells delicious.

Yum! This was my first foray into quinoa and I had to force myself to not eat the whole pot. I used red quinoa, and subbed veggie broth for the chicken stock, doubled the garlic and subbed Craisins for the raisins. SO good! Fresh from the pot, it was light yet satisfying and great for a winter night. Plus the house smelled delicious while it was simmering. Thank you!

one of my fav quinoa recipes. raisins add a sweetness. daughter liked beans, raisins, and pine nuts... a little too spicy for her though. next time i'll leave out the pepper and see if she likes it better. i also used white beans instead of garbanzo. i only used 1/4 c pine nuts and it was enough.

I love the idea of this recipe, and I was super excited to try it, but it just didn't hit the 'this is yuuuummmmy' spot.  Curries and Indian flavors are among my favorites to make; this recipe just wasn't quite there.

I varied this by using millet instead of quinoa, and omitted the oil.  Instead of using stock, I just used water.  This has great taste!  I'll make it again using  quinoa or other grains (the first time I made this, I used red quinoa).  Great recipe!

I’ve heard of quinoa, yet have never had it before.  You can find quinoa in the international food isle of your grocery store.  I thought this was a wonderful alternative to rice or pasta for a change. Come to find out it not only tastes great but it great for you!

BF went crazy for this and requested it for later this week. I had measured and mixed my spices and when the store was out of quinoa, I had to use only the 1/2 cup I had onhand. I will probably increase the spices next time as they were right on, but not increase on the salt. Raisins and pine nuts are key! Fantastic and healthy dish and the flavor only gets better with time.

Made double the amount of quinoa, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Didn't use pine nuts since I didn't have them, but definitely used the raisins. The spices turned out to be quite enough even without doubling the entire recipe. Tasted great, hot. Made me crave something cool and yogurt-y to follow, but this was quite filling in itself. Can't wait to surprise my mom with it.

Really delicious. I thought the full can of chick peas might be too many, but it wasn't at all. I also added carrots and used veggie stock to make a vegetarian meal of it. I only added half the salt and probably won't add any next time, as I didn't find it needed it. I now make this all the time and usually add sunflower seeds instead of expensive pine nuts.

Really delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only minor tweaks I will do next time is to hold off on the 1/2 tsp of salt until I taste test it at the end and maybe try with vegetable stock just so its 100% vegetarian.  It was a little on the salty side, but not overbearing for me.  My husband, a meat and potatoes guy who has never had quinoa, loved it!  I served it as a weeknight dinner entree.  Thanks for sharing!!

I am always looking for new ways to prepare quinoa.   I swapped out pine nuts for pecans and garbanzos for northern beans.  I enjoy this dish as a healthy afternoon snack.  I do prefer it heated as it brings out more flavors.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I love quinoa, so was happy to stumble across this recipe!  Very tasty, really nice combination of flavours, although I decided to skip the garbanzos, despite how much I love them!  They just don't seem to pair well in this dish.  Raisins and pine nuts on the other hand are a must, they really complete it!  Nice and quick to throw together and went really well with Crumb Coated Chicken Thighs from this site!
**UPDATE 2/22/10 - made this again tonight, not even realizing I had made it already!  Not sure what I was thinking the first time as I put the garbanzos in...FANTASTIC!  I re-neg on my original comment...they do pair very well and I loved it!

An easy way to rinse quinoa for me is to put a coffee filter in a strainer and you can rinse a half to a full cup at a time. L.D.

Wow is this good! This was my first time making quinoa and I love it! Will definitely make again. I did not add the beans, nuts, or raisins as my family does not care for them. Still awesome!

Delicious! The raisins add such a nice sweetness. And the garbanzos add a nice crunch. A fantastic mix of texture and flavor. We try to eat about 80% plant-based, so quinoa is a staple in our household. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I found it a bit spicy for my tastes, but then again I'm a wimp when it comes to heat. Next time I'll reduce the spices just a little (and possibly reduce the cinnamon a little extra). Otherwise great flavour! The husband loved it. I wasn't able to use pine nuts - a little out of the budget right now. Thanks for a recipe that wasn't boring like all the other quinoa recipes out there!

My favorite recipe ever! I use almonds (the poor man's pine nut) and dried cranberries, which I like better than the raisins. It's such an easy and quick recipe, and a great way to get your protein in! Doubles nicely.  I always make extra and eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Cooking some now! Yummmm :)

Excellent! Would be great as a side dish, but loved it as the main dish with a side salad. I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts, because they were less expensive, and really really enjoyed it. This meal is complex in flavor but hearty, very easy to make, and comforting. Also, it is just loaded with nutrients. We made it lower fat by opting out of the oil and using broth to saute the onions in. Also, I'm a vegan and made it full vegan by using Imagine no-chicken broth (a really awesome ingredient found at Whole Foods), but also think it would work with just water. Highly recommended, will definitely make it again!!

This is now my favorite quinoa recipe.  The spices are awesome.  With or without garbanzo and pine nuts, it makes a great side dish.  My husband loves it, so it is a new staple.

I liked this recipe so much that I am going to make a batch to take as lunches for the next week. We used water instead of chicken stock and it was still amazing; the pine nuts give the quinoa a nice crunch.

This is a great quick recipe for a healthy side dish. It can also be eaten as a main dish with some vegetables on the side for a balanced healthy meal since it contains plenty of protein and carbs. I didn't have chicken stock so substituted vegetable broth and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Worked out wonderfully!

This recipe was good and simple. I didn't have raisins so I used about 3/4 cup of pineapple tidbits, added a few minutes before turning off the heat. I also poured in some of the juice because the quinoa needed more liquid to cook completely. I decided to leave out the chick peas. I used a vegetarian "chicken" broth. The dish had a nice balance of salty, sweet and spicy.

This is not only dleicious but one of the most versatile dishes ever! I also add raisens in, gives it a sweet and savory flavor. You may add in any meat you like or fish, any veggies (leftovers work too if not too heavily seasoned).  I keep this made all the time, my family loves it, great for leftovers, flavors just keep getting better. Thank you so much for sharing.

This was great. I only used 3/4 tsp curry and 1/8 tsp black pepper.  I could still taste the spice, but it wasn't overpowering for my kids.  I skipped soaking the raisans and just added them in with the broth.   My 4 year old even ate it!

Loved this Quinoa recipe. I don't like raisins and used dried cherries instead and it was still very delicious! I love cooked onions and may have added a little more than the recipe called for and added a dribble more broth. Next time Ill still add the extra onions but keep to the recipe for the broth amount I had leftovers the next day for lunch and it was just as good the second time around. I will definitely make this again.

I really like this recipe.  I don't eat curry very often, so it was nice (although, I did add a little less).  I will also try it without the curry, I'm sure it will be good as well.

this was easy and delicious.  i might omit the chickpeas for better focus on the flavors that really work.   or turn it into a main dish instead of a side by keeping the chick peas and adding chopped chicken.  but it is a great basic and i agree with other reviewers that the raisins are really good.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I gave it 5 stars because the spices with the quinoa worked so well! I didn't have pine nuts or raisins or garbanzo beans...so i didn't get a real feel for the recipe. But i followed the spices and realized you can add pretty much anything to this!  At the end instead of the three ingredients suggested...i added kidney beans, spinach and some broccoli.  It turned out wonderful! This is a very versatile recipe...I will definitely make it again!  Oh, and it couldn't have been any easier!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good! I bought a huge bag of quinoa at Costco and was looking for recipes to use it in.  This didn't fall short! I had to make a couple changes due to what I had on hand.  I used great northern beans instead of garbanzo and used craisins instead of raisins. I didn't have pine nuts, so left them out, but will be sure to use them next time.  So flavorful!  I love the Quinoa and Black Beans on this site, but now I have another recipe that I will make again and again!

I'm glad that I tried this out this recipe, even though the salt content killed it for me. I even used low-sodium chicken broth. Didn't have pine nuts, but imagine it would be wonderful addition. Adding the bloated raisins and chickpeas were a must! Next time, I'll try it with half the salt and maybe some lemon juice.

Quinoa is such a wonderful grain, I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it.  This recipe is interesting.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I love the combination of spicy and sweet flavors.  The pine nuts were wonderful.  The only change I would make is to use less garbanzo beans (or just eliminate them altogether) since there were too many and they got in the way of the other wonderful ingredients.  That's just my personal preference because I'm not the biggest fan of beans.

Very good. I used red quinoa, it may need to be cooked for longer than 20 minutes. Also, I would cut down on the salt.  I substituted peanuts and craisins for the pine nuts and raisins. It was good.

Delectable! I would definitely make the raisins mandatory. They added just the right amount of sweetness. Next time, I'll use half the amount of salt, though.

This was delightfully delicious!! The flavor is prominent but not overpowering which creates a really tasty dish. I made some minor changes (substituted bullion, craisins and toasted slivered almonds and cut down the curry by 1/2tsp) but otherwise stayed true to the overall recipe. I served this as a salad so I also added a chopped orange pepper. Also, as others have stated, the raisins (or in my case craisins) are essential in giving this dish the pop of sweetness it needs so do not omit them. If you do, it changes the entire taste of this dish. Instead of plumping my craisins separately, I tossed them into the pot of cooking quinoa for the last few minutes. my hubby, who does not "do" anything remotely exotic really enjoyed this dish too! Will be making again :-)

Good and healthy.  As a side dish, this makes about six servings.  You must like Mediterranean and Indian food to like this dish.

Only one crucial change.... HALF the amount of salt. Delicious, easy, smells wonderful while cooking. I used toasted walnuts because I can't eat pinenuts. This is a keeper.

Very delicious and healthy, sure to be a new fave! I made a few substitutions, though: pecans for pine nuts, vegetable stock for chicken stock (had to make it vegan!), omitted the raisins and added chopped red and orange peppers and carrots, and used leftover black beans rather than garbanzos.

Delicious recipe but I did modify mine.  I added chicken, red pepper, cliantro and I did craisins instead of raisins. My boyfriend and I loved it and it is great as an entree when you add meat.

Absolutely love this! I chose to make it into a main dish by stuffing it into pitas with cubed cucumber and homemade hummus. I left out the garbanzo beans since they are already in the hummus. I will definitely do this again!

I love quinoa and this recipe might very well be my all time favorite. I've made it many times and tried all kinds of tweaks to this or that.  It always comes out good.  Even though we are all spice lovers in my family, I think the spice combo in the original recipe is best. The only change I regularly make is to use slivered almonds in place of pine nuts. They are much less expensive and, after toasting, the deep nutty flavor is the perfect foil the sweetness of raisins, savory spices, and slight bitter of quinoa.  A little extra garlic never hurts either. Enjoy!

This was excellent!  I sauteed the onion and garlic and toasted the pine nuts in a skillet, then dumped the whole mess (minus the raisins) in the rice cooker.  Push the button, wait for dinner!  I stirred the raisins in at the end, as directed.  Even though none of us are big raisin fans, they were excellent in this mix.

Meh. All the great reviews had me excited because I really enjoy quinoa, but honestly it didn't do much for me. I followed the recipe with two exceptions: (1) I used red quinoa instead of white and (2) I didn't use any pine nuts. These seem like minor enough things that they shouldn't affect the flavor too much. I love salt, but this was a little too salty for me. The raisins were the only redeeming quality--I'd probably use more if I made this again. Maybe the quality of the curry makes a difference.

5 stars because nearly everyone in my family ate this healthy, meat-free dish without complaint.  I  liked it a lot.  The quinoa took longer to cook than I thought it would but the longer cook time seemed to take away some of the bitter flavor I find in quinoa.  I am new to cooking with quinoa although I have eaten it cooked by other people.  No pine nuts in the house, and I almost left out the raisins, but the other reviews persuaded me to use them.  It was a nice balance of flavors. Eaten by kids ages 12-17.  Healthy, truly kid-friendly food is key for me.  If the kids won't eat it, I don't want to make it.  I will definitely make this again.

Really liked this.  Made changes to use what I had on hand.  I didn't have raisins so used Craisins and used black beans instead of garbanzo beans.  Today I added shaved parmesan to the left overs and have enjoyed the flavor it added.

Yummy! This is a great way to eat quinoa . I just scaled it down for one serving so I could sample it for myself before making for anyone else. I really love how simple it is. Left out the chicken stock, cooked the quinoa separately and added it to the onions, garlic and spices and also added in some sweetcorn . The rasins make this dish what it is , nice contrast of sweet , salty and mild spice .

This dish is one of our family favorites!! It is so delicious yet so good for you. I normally add a tablespoon of curry as we like a stronger flavor. I also add toasted walnuts as they are cheaper than pine nuts.

We did not care for this recipe. The ONLY saving grace for it was the pine nuts and raisins. Followed the recipe to the letter. I have already tossed my printed copy, and will be deleting it from my recipe box online. Sorry...it sounded interesting with flavors I love.

Fantastic.  Added grilled chicken seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt on top and doubled spices using 1 tsp hot curry powder and 2 tsp regular.  Used half the salt called for.  Even picky son raved about it.

I really enjoyed this dish. I've made this twice now once with low sodium chicken stock and pine nuts and once with vegetable stock for a vegetarian friend and slivered almonds. If pinenuts are too expensive or you don't have them the almonds are just as good. I didn't add the extra salt either time as its salty enough for me. I liked the sweetness of the raisins as well. Both times I added some chopped coriander/cilantro at the end. Tastes just as good if not better the next day.

A great side dish.  Nice to try something different.  I toasted the nuts then quickly processed them to more evenly distribute through the grains.  Used vegetable broth in place of chicken.  Delicious!

Ooo this was delicious....all the spices blended in perfectly! I do belive it could have used some lemon, which I added in later (it added a little bit of the togetherness) Also, I used butterbeans in a can which was what I had at the moment and it turned out great! Thank you soo much for the recipe!

I love this recipe and have made it a number of times since first discovering it.  Instead of soaking the raisins in water and adding them in at the end, I simmer them with the quinoa and chicken stock so they absorb the liquid and become more tender (I have also done this with the garbanzo beans).  I have also made this without the chicken stock, subbing in the liquid from the canned garbanzo beans and adding water until it reaches 1.5 cups (usually have to add about .5 cups of water).

I really enjoy this. Omitted the pine nuts & raisins, I didn't have any, but added toasted almonds to the top and it was delicious. Also used water in place of chicken stock and it was still excellent. Will definitely be making this one again. (:

Very good tasting. Some of the better tasting quinoa recipes out there. I omitted pine nuts (didn't have them) and raisins as hubby doesn't like raisins in his food. Will be a regular quinoa recipe for us for sure.

This quinoa dish is delicious! It's quick, easy and great to pair with a moroccan spiced shrimp or lamb! I use a pre-made moroccan spice to make it even quicker! You can add apricots, raisins, dates or other dried fruit and I always add a little sauteed kale or spinach so my kids get veggies in. It's a very versatile recipe!

Very good recipe! I did have to double the spices, but that's a personal preference thing and I like things very spicy. I'm a vegetarian and I ran out of veggie stock so I used water instead and it turned out just fine; I bet its even better with the veggie stock.  I didn't use the pine nuts b/c they are too expensive for me right now.  The raisins really do a great job counteracting the spiciness of the quinoa, and the garbanzo beans just round out the whole dish.  It's a great, healthy option for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very delicious! I did a few moderations: I added 1/2 cup shredded carrots and sauteed with the onions. I also added about 3/4 cup finely chopped spinach during the last 10 minutes. I garnished with almonds instead of pine nuts, since I didn't have them on hand. Will definitely make again!

This was delish! I cut down the pine nuts to 1/4 c to save myself some calories but I did find them an excellent addition to the dish. That said, I found this very salty for some reason so I think in the future I won't add that 1/2 t of salt it asks for. Will be making again!

This was amazing! I just started introducing Quinoa to my family and my hubby likes it more than couscous! I did rinse my Quinoa well before cooking, since it is so small, I used cheesecloth in my strainer to keep it from escaping from the holes.  I added sliced celery with the onions and garlic. Due to a family allergy, I did not add the beans,  and used toasted cashews in leiu of pinenuts and raisins.

Sorry, not an enormous hit with us!  Followed the recipe as written, but it came out mushy, and with a flavor we weren't crazy about.  Since this is the third quinoa recipe I've tried without success, I'm starting to entertain the possibility that the guilty flavor is, in fact, quinoa, but for the time being, I'm betting on the cinnamon.  15-month-old happily ate the chickpeas, though.  Thanks anyway!

I absolutely love this quinoa dish!  I have made it several times and its perfect every time.  The first time I made it I didnt have raisins but the other reviews said not to omit so i added dried cranberries instead for that sweet/salty contrast and WOW was it good!  I make it with cranberries every time now.  I also leave the pine nuts out to cut out the fat.

Mmmarvelous, hot or cold!  (I used garbonzo beans I'd cooked myself.  I prepare a large batch, season, and freeze them in plastic containers.)  Also, once the quinoa had cooled,  I added chopped tomatoes and snipped parsley, and it was even better.  Thanks for sharing!  UPDATE:  This has become my regular potluck recipe.  I adapt it according to what I have on hand.  I will sometimes use black beans or French lentils instead of garbanzo beans, and I often toast cashews, walnuts or sunflower  seeds instead of the pine nuts.  I also like to serve it over salad greens with a bit of olive oil.  So delicious!

This is an excellent recipe! I changed it up a bit and used red quinoa, almonds slivers instead of pine nuts and left out the raisins.  It was delicious.  I served it as a side dish to cheese & broccoli stuffed chicken breasts and steamed broccoli. However, with all the protein in the quinoa and chick peas, and its full flavor, it can definitely stand as a main dish as well.

I am trying to prepare healthy food for my wife and me and had been looking for good non-meat source of protein.   I did up the quantity of fruit by adding an equal amount of dried cranberries and the sweetness blended well with the spices.  The pinenuts were a wonderful accent with their roasted nut flavor.  This is definately a keeper.

Very tasty and delicious!  I did not have chickpeas or pine nuts so I used 1 1/2 cups toasted shelled walnuts and added another 1/2 teaspoon curry powder.  I also used sea salt instead of regular salt and I probably could have cut that down to 1/4 teaspoon with all my alterations.  It was not overwhelmingly spicy, in fact it was almost subtle because of the sweetness provided by the raisins.

This was actually better than I thought it would be - and it's pretty healthy.  I only used the cumin, no curry.  I used dried cranberries because I didn't have raisins.  I also didn't have pine nuts so used pecans which I toasted.  Surprisingly good recipe!

I am going to use fewer garbanzo beans next time and possibly more raisins and pine nuts.

A great way to use a very healthy grain. We bought a 4 pound bag of Quinoa at Costco for a good price so I was looking for recipes. I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts. Next time I will add more raisins. Very nice!

I made this for dinner tonight and just have to say how great it was!  I followed the recipe exactly (including the raisins), but substituted toasted slivered almonds for the pine nuts.  I served it with sweet apple chicken sausages and warm pita bread and hummus.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks!******2/19/13*UPDATE: I'm still loving this recipe, but like it best with dried cranberries (I never soak them) and coarsely chopped whole, raw almonds that I toast first in a dry pan.  Excellent flavors!

Really excellent! I wished I had read the other reviews first because I also found this a bit salty. Next time I'll use half the salt or less. Otherwise, it was perfect as is. I agree with the other reviewers, pine nuts and raisons are essential

I thought this was delicious but unfortunately the kids wouldn't eat it!  Very easy to make, I followed the recipe to a T and also added cilantro which went really well with the other flavors.  Grilled some big portabellas, threw some leftover chicken on the plate and dinner was done in 30 minutes.  This seems like it would also be a great dinner party side dish - especially for vegetarians.

5 Stars for flavour, ease and wholesomeness. Healthy ingredients makes this an excellent side dish for everyday dimners or parties. I didnt have raining so i used chopped dried mango pieces. I forgot the cinnamon but the sweetness was already there and although i love cinnamon i dont think it was critical..plus you can add it after anyway. Great resi

I tripled the garlic. It's really good! Delicious. I gave half to a friend, who texted me rave reviews twice! And I kept half for me and my boyfriend, who also loved it and snarfed down most of it. :)

Awesome. I didn't have pine nuts so roasted some sunflower  seeds and used craisins instead of raisins. The red color and sweetness add even more flavor. I love it warm but cold is good too.

Wonderful! Took other reviewers' advice and was a little heavier handed with the spices, and also used sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts since they were less expensive. Seems like most any nut would work. Great flavor and balance between warmth from the spice and sweet from the raisins.

Great meal!  I  doubled the recipe for a main dish for my family of 5. I added pieced chicken thighs that I had pan fried at the end to sit in the mix for a bit.  I used only one serving of beans because I had the chicken  and didn't want to overwhelm the dish.  The flavors are great and we will make it again!

Yum. I substituted a mix of almonds and walnuts for the pine nuts- the grocer didn’t have pine nuts yesterday. Also added more of all spices, as I like my food spicy. This was great. Made a double batch and before adding the nuts, beans and raisins, used the base plus hot Italian sausage to stuff peppers.  So good. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is almost identical to one my personal trainer got from a newspaper a few years ago and recently passed on to me.  The difference is that hers also includes 1/2 cup dried unsweetened cranberries and does not include curry powder.  I had a hard time finding dried unsweetened cranberries but am glad I waited until I did to make the salad as they add another level of flavour.   As a warm salad it was meh and even just ok once it cooled.  The next day, however, after the flavours had melded together, I found I quite enjoyed it.   I omitted the onion due to an allergy and upped the garlic slightly.  This is not the type of food my husband likes so he didn't try it and as the only one who would eat it, I will likely make it again, but not often.

I made it exactly as written the first time and it was so yummy!  It was requested the following week and that's when I tweeked alittle - used some frijoles that I had just made and added cilantro - OMG! just as good.  I throw it in my salads, eat it by itself, warm, cold - its good every way.  Will be one of my go to receipes!

This smelled amazing during the cooking stage and tasted great. My whole family loved this recipe. It made it to the "Please make this again" list at our house.

Excellent! Super easy to make. I added some extra stuff: goat cheese, beets, and green onions. Everyone in the family liked it. The only change I'll make next time is that I will double the recipe.

Loved it. It's suggestive of Biryani, but with quinoa instead of rice. I omitted the pine nuts and chopped pecans instead, and added a pinch of turmeric and garam masala. Quite nice. I should also add that your experience with the curry powder you choose will be different--as "curry" powder is essentially a unique combination of different spices, and each person or each company that produces such mixed powders, will have a slightly different composition (think of seasoned salt, with its common core ingredients, but special variations). I tried this recipe once with Sun Brand Madras Curry powder (coriander seeds, turmeric, chili, salt, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, cinnamon, cloves, anise and mustard), and once with Rani Brand Hot Curry Powder (Coriander, turmeric, Cumin, Mustard, Fenugreek, Black Pepper, Garlic, Fennel, Poppy Seeds, chili and dried curry leaves). I also did it a third time, using my own hand-mixed curry powder (turmeric, red chili powder, garlic, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cinnamon), plus fresh chopped cilantro. So, you can see how greatly the result would be affected by your choice in curry powder mix, or hand mix.

Yum!  I had my doubts about this one since the ingredients are a little out of my normal routine.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this.  Definitely a keeper.

I was pleasantly surprised with how all the flavors came together.  Most pleasing was the blend of curry and cinnamon.

I will note that  I used walnuts instead of pine nuts and regular raisins because that was what I had on hand.  I used madras curry powder, and it was delicious!  Heats up well, too.

Super yum! I made it as-is (had some leftover quinoa I needed to use up) and will definitely be making it again.  I'm thinking this would be good with lentils instead of quinoa as well.

This recipe was delicious! I increased the spices mentioned and also added paprika, turmeric and parsley to it for more dimension. I didn't add the pine nuts or raisins however next time I would try the pine nuts for fun (smooshy cooked raisins gross me out) but it doesn't need them at all.  Popped this in my favourites section to use again and again I the future. Great recipe!

This has become our, go-to dish to bring when doing a potluck or just want to help a hostess out.  we've skipped the pine nuts a few times (allergies) and it is definitely better with them, though great with or without.  My daughter who was just over 1, loved it when we first made it.

I try to make recipes as written first but when the family is hungry, you gotta go with whatcha got. Had no pine nuts (not subbed). No garbanzo beans; used black beans instead. It was GREAT! I could make this for dinner again tomorrow (and maybe I'll have all the ingredients).

What a wonderful dish. I substituted kaniwa for the quinoa since apparently they cook pretty much the same (and even sound the same). Turned out really well.  This is now something that we are going to eat often! Also we threw in some avocado on the side and that just added to the magic.

Substituted almonds (toasted and then pulsed in blender) for pine nuts. Substituted dried dates (cut into raisin sizes then soaked in water to remove excess sweetness. I drank the water it soaked in so I didn't feel wasteful). And I doubled all measurements for the spices. Amazing and easy with plenty of leftovers!

Absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe to the letter--only exception was that instead of raisins, I had a packet of dried cherries, cranberries and blueberries which I substituted. I soaked these in hot water as the recipe says. Spices were perfect. Guaranteed, this will become a regular dish in our house.

Really great recipe!  I don't really even like quinoa, I'm just trying to add healthful sides to our meals.  Contrary to other reviews my picky husband said he could do without the raisins. 
Cinderella you are an artist to mix all of those spices & come up with something edible, let alone great!  Thank you for taking the time!

This is an excellent base recipe and leaves so many options open for adaptation.  My only specific change from what is written is to leave out the cinnamon.  Personally not a fan of cinnamon with curry.  My adaptions, first double the recipe.  Shredded a couple of carrots into the onion and garlic saute.  Left out the cinnamon.  Use one can of chickpeas and roughly the equivalent of regular peas - saute/toast them in a pan together before adding.  Used almonds instead of pine nuts.  Definitely include the raisins.  LOTS of flavor.

Loved it! I subbed black beans for the chick peas, and added some fresh parsley and a cup of fresh mushrooms (just because I had some). I left out the raisins. Turned out great and will definitely make this again.

Delicious. I cooked it without salt (im having sodium problems) and really liked it. Especially with steaks on the side

I will be making this again with some changes. The spices are nice, they could be slightly increased. I felt there wasn't enough quinoa compared to mix-ins (especially chickpeas) so next time I will double the quinoa and broth and increase the spices as well. I used less salt and reduced sodium broth.

Absolutely delicious spice blend and flavors! I decided not to add the garbanzo beans, and it was still delicious.  It stores well and is great cold as well as hot.

this was absolutely delightful.. and i'm not much of a fan of quinoa.. bf really enjoyed this as well.. always using what i have on hand.. i used dried cherries for the raisins, almonds for the pine nuts and garlic powder for fresh and left the garbanzo beans out.. ty so much for the recipe.. maybe i actually enjoy quinoa when it's prepared with flavor!

I did a version of this recipe and it turned out great.  I didn't have any cumin, so I substituted paprika and I substituted dried cranberries, for the raisins.  I also toasted raw almonds, instead of the pine nuts at 350 for about 10 minutes. Explosion of flavors!! It was more delish then I ever expected.  Thanks.

This recipe has the potential to be really good, but it is a little sloppily put together.  The amount of broth is way too much for the cooking time.  It definitely needs to be reduced or the cooking time extended.  The flavors blend well, in my opinion.  Definitely omitted the raisins for personal taste issue.  I used a mix of pine nuts and cashews for the nuts, which worked well.  Also upped the garlic content after reading reviews about overwhelming curry flavor. Will try again with reduced stock.

Not bad but make sure you wash the quinoa really good or it can ruin the taste of the meal. I added more raisins cus they are good! I make this as a side with some chicken.

This was very good, however I would have preferred a smaller, softer bean. The chickpea was so much different in texture than the quinoa, it detracted from rather than enhancing the dish

I liked this recipe, but I felt that the quinoa didn't gain much from using the chicken stock.  I will use water next time.

It might've been the fact that I used red quinoa.

REALLY good!  Just now moving to a plant-based diet, and this was a hit with me, my husband, and kids.  I used red quinoa for what it is worth, and I needed a little more cooking time than what is here.  Leftovers were even better than the original.  I will probably play with different kinds of curry until I find my fav for this dish.

This recipe was excellent!  The flavors complement each other so well.  The sweetness of the raisins is an essential component of this this recipe.  If you don't like raisins, consider using another dried fruit such as currants, cherries, or cranberries.

We liked this a lot! Unfortunately, I burnt the pine-nuts and my husband won't eat raisins so we made it without those.  It did 'need something'. I had raw sliced almonds - tossing those in was a great addition. Next time, we want to try the pine nuts, and maybe some peas or diced apples or carrots.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I sorted through the reviews and likewise made modifications.  I doubled the spices except the salt.  I also substituted the pine nuts with toasted almond slices and the raisins with dried crandberries.  My husband had the idea to serve with a lettuce wrap.

Made this for my vegetarian daughter and son-in-law so used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth; did not add cumin; had no pine nuts so tried to toast some sunflower seeds, ended up burning them so left those out too! But everyone liked it, including the non-vegetarians. I will make this again...easy, quick, healthy and filling!

I don't like raisins so hesitated to add them but I always like to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it and then add or subtract ingredients then. I'm so glad I left the raisins in because it really makes this dish. It gives it a nice sweetness which compliments the spices. This is now one of my favorite dishes.

This is a great way to enjoy quinoa! Very easy to prepare. I used vegetable stock to make it vegan, and it still came out great! I doubled the recipe because I knew it was going to be good!

This is delicious. I didn't add salt because the chicken stock had enough salt and omitted the nuts to reduce calories. I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving.

Absolutely loved this recipe as is. We had it with chicken that I had seasoned with the same spices as the quinoa mix except I used garlic powder for minced garlic. Then for lunch the next day I put it in a bed of rocket, swiss chard and kale. Really great both days. This will be a staple.

I made the exact recipe with two changes; I used half the salt and added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, which gave it a little kick. My husband and I loved this recipe and will add it to our rotation. The kids did not appreciate the spice, however, so we will leave that out next time. Be sure to toast the pine nuts and soak the raisins. It was so good!

Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome!  I made this for the first time for a work potluck and it was a huge hit.  The only change I made was to substitute Trader Joe's Harvest Grain blend for the plain quinoa - it was perfect!

We had company coming with some dietary challenge,tried this dish and it was an great hit! Second time around used more curry and white raisins. Everyone loved it. This is as good or better cold as it is hot. This is a "repeat" dish on our table.

I discovered this about a month ago because I was searching for a new quinoa recipe utilizing ingredients i already had in my pantry.... I have made it 4 times already.  It's great for lunch or a side dish for dinner and people love it at pot lucks!  The raisins and pine nuts are critical and in my opinion the chickpeas are optional.

This was a fantastic side dish with grilled salmon.  My family doesn't care for garbanzo beans so I substituted a cup of frozen peas and added them at the same time as the quinoa.  The only  other thing I might change next time would be to reduce the raisens to 1/4 cup.  1/2 cup made the dish a little too sweet.  Otherwise, delish!

I wanted a different recipe for quinoa, since I usually make it with black beans and Italian sausage (another recipes on AR). I'm glad I found this! It had great flavor. I didn't have raisins, so I used Craisins, and almonds for pine nuts. I was sort of nervous about the cinnamon, but it seemed to add depth and tie everything together.  Thanks!

Very surprising, the ingredients go well together and the seasoning is subtle. Refreshing, healthy nice dish.
I added more liquid during cooking, felt the need.

The mix of spices in this dish was yummy! I was looking to make something quick with what I had on hand, and this did the trick! It accepts substitutions well. I used white beans, dried cranberries, and toasted sunflower seeds instead of chickpeas, raisins, and pine nuts. I thought it was a bit salty, so I think I will use less or no salt next time. (The chicken broth is already salty)

I really like this dish and made it vegan with the substitution of vege broth. I've been experimenting with Indian seasonings this year and notice a difference in curry seasoning. Mine was spicy so I didn't add any extra. If you are new to quinoa it is very nutritious but be sure to rinse it well or it may taste dirty (IMHO). For me the raisins balance the curry with a sweetness that is needed. I'm glad I left them in. I'm serving this dish to a vegan friend tonight with Gardein chicken-like cutlets but the dish looks hearty enough to serve in bowls with pita bread.

This recipe is very good, except I found it entirely too salty.  Next time, I'm going to cut the salt out completely.  I think the chicken stock has enough salt for the entire dish.  Otherwise, really enjoyed the flavors!

This recipe is delicious. I want to double check the nutritional information of the ingredients used because the amount listed on allrecipes for fat and calories seems a bit high. I did use low fat chicken broth, that may make a difference. I sent a friend to get the pine nuts and they were $29 a pound so we substituted roasted, salted sunflower seeds and they went well with the recipe. I used currents instead of raisins as that is just what I happened to have in the cupboard. I had allrecipes calculate for six servings and two of us ate most of the quinoa (with only salad on the side) and left enough for me for lunch the next day.

DELICIOUS! So easy and so good. I was looking for a quick, simple recipe that was filling and packed with protein. Found it with this one! Great as a main dish or a side dish. Very easy to make, had all the ingredients I needed in my cupboard (except the pine nuts, which I just omitted to save myself a trip to the store). I highly recommend this recipe. Very, very good.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on here. It's incredibly easy to make and has wonderful flavor. I add a bit of chili powder and extra cumin. Excellent recipe.

I enjoyed this - my first time cooking quinao outside of using it in bread.  It was an easy recipe and I followed it completely.  I will probably make this again.

I really liked this.  I had enough to take as leftovers for lunch for a few days and didn't get tired of it.  I did go a bit heavy on the cumin and curry.

Really yummy, goes well as meal or side dish with chicken.  I loved how easy it was to prepare and how good all the flavors and textures came together.  Will definitely be making this again.

I'm experimenting with quinoa again after trying it and not liking it about 10 years ago.  I love Indian flavors and thought this was delicious.  The raisins are essential in my opinion.  Thanks for the great recipe!

What a great recipe!  Even my husband, who doesn't like curry, said this recipe was a keeper!  PS- I added a diced red bell pepper and used canelli beans since we don't like garbanzo beans.  Wonderful!  Can't wait to make it again!

I doubled the garlic and added 1/4 cup golden raisins and 1/4 cup dried cranberries (it was all I had). It was delicious - I'll definitely make it again.

This is delicious!!! I made everything according to recipe, but since i'm not a big fan of raisins i substituted them for dried cranberries, and it turned out wonderful. Even my rather-picky fiance gobbled it down in no time!! For next time i might use a tad less chick peas and pine nuts though, as they make this dish somewhat calorie-dense. As a main dish i probably had two servings of this, and that's already 880 Calories!!

Wow!  This is absolutely delicious! I used toasted walnuts in place of the pine nuts.  Very easy to make too.  A keeper for sure!  I'm looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

This is the most amazing dish!  It will now be something I eat on a WEEKLY basis and I'm so glad to have found it because sides can become SO boring.  I followed other suggestions and substituted craisins and toasted walnuts and it was glorious!!  Try it now, you won't be disappointed.

This was a very yummy way to eat quinoa and garbanzo beans.  Both are so good for you.  With a side of green peas, this made a wonderful meal. Hubby and both kids (1 year and 3 year old) loved it too.  Will definitely make again.  Oh, and we didn't find this too salty at all.  Since different brands can be so drastically different, it's probably a good idea to check to sodium content of your broth and then adjust how much salt you add accordingly.

This was very good and basically the way I was expecting it to taste by the picture and reading the recipe.  I did add about 1/2 Tbsp. of honey and omitted the pine nuts (I didn't have any), but I can't wait to try it with them!

I followed the recipe and it was good.  A nice change that easy to make.  Very Indian-like.
