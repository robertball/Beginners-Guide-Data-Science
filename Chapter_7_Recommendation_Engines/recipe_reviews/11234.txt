A good concept that needs refinement. I doubled the recipe and still it yielded barely the equivalent of a single can of Bordens. No mention was made of stirring during cooking. This is not only a good idea, it is down right critical. Plus, no mention is made of the initial cooking temperature. Keep it down a bit, stir constantly, and you should have good results. The flavor is just like Bordens. I mixed it with the can of Bordens I had on hand and it worked great.

PERFECT SUBSTITUTE!  I was out of the normal canned sweetened condensed milk and used this recipe instead.  It worked out wonderfully! I don't have a double broiler, so I filled a larger sauce pan 1/3 full of water; and took a slightly smaller saucepan and put it inside the larger one.  In the smaller pan I sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray and put the ingredients in.  I cooked in on medium heat - stirring often - for about 10-15 minutes.  I didn't have ANY problems with this recipe whatsoever.  It was an identical substitute.  Thanks so much for sharing!

One reviewer said this burned while cooking and, even though I stirred it constantly while it cooked, it definitely burned for me too. I made a second batch in the microwave oven and timed and watched it very carefully so it wouldn't boil over. I zapped for 1 min., stirred zapped for 30 seconds, twice, stirred, then continued to zap until it boiled almost to the rim for 15 seconds. I did this for 5 times, stirring after each. Finally, I put it into my Bullet and blended it for about 50 seconds till it was totally smooth and exactly like the canned version. I'll make it this way from now on - it tastes like what I always bought before but is much cheaper to make. It actually takes less time to make it this way, too!

Wow!  I can't believe that making sweetened condensed milk is so easy!  I am so happy to have found this recipe.  This is just like the real thing -- and so easy to make with handy ingredients.  No more of those little cans for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a quick save for me.  I was making Cheese Cake (my own recipe) and realized after everything else was added in that I only had 1 can of condensed milk.  It did burn a little so next time I will probably turn down the heat and put in in a double broiler.  It made the cheese cake richer and worked out great.  Thanks Jeannie for the quick and easy recipe.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

First, I tried this with splenda thanks to HotGrandma, who threw down the gantlet. this did not work, the result was grainy and would not smooth out. I then tried it with regular sugar. It was still grainy even tho I combined the dry milk and water before I heated it up. I accidentally burned it a bit. I sorta salvaged it by running it throw a sieve. I will use it for oatmeal next week. sorry, could not make this work out for me :(

Thank you for the recipe.  My hubby is a diabetic and I am constantly searching for recipes I can convert using a non sugar sub.,  There are many recipes out there but you have to find how to convert the components like condensed milk so that you can make it for a diabetic to eat.  Thank you for providing this.

I made this sweetened condensed milk tonight when I was craving a cinnamon latte, and really didn't want to make that trip to Starbucks. This worked out great! Very easy and a lot less expensive than buying the can. I'm not sure if I will ever buy a can of it again because of how quick this recipe for it is, it would be silly not to make it instead. I didn't have the problem of this burning like some others, but I just made sure I stirred it constantly until it was thickened. Oh, and my latte turned out fabulous! Thanks for the recipe, Jeannie!

In Germany: Nestlé make condensed sweetened milk in tubes and cans under the brand "Milchmädchen".  Kaufhof/Hertie/Walmart should stock it. I've never seen powdered milk here except on an army base.

Great recipe for (almost) fat free sweetened condensed milk!  It made a little more than 14 oz for me because I didn't stir it for the full 20 minutes.  Even though I whisked it constantly, it still got a little burnt on the bottom.  Next time I'll stir more vigorously and turn the heat down!  Condensed milk costs $3.59 here, so this is definitely a money saver!

I am rating this based on my first attempt.  The second is on the stove right now.

If you make this recipe, you need to use a double boiler.  If the milk and sugar are exposed to direct heat, they WILL burn/caramelize onto the bottom of your pan, no matter how constantly you stir.  If you don't have a double boiler, you can improvise one: lay a (metal!) cooling rack along the inside of a large frying pan; it should be able to lie flat on the bottom.  Fill the frying pan about 2/3 - 3/4 full with hot water from the tap (hot makes boiling go quicker).  Put your saucepan on top of the cooling rack; an inch or so should be submerged in the water.  Make sure that when the saucepan goes in the water it doesn't displace so much that the water will splash out once it boils!  Now turn on the heat and once your water boils, the saucepan's contents will be exposed to only the temperature of boiling water (not direct heat), which is the point of a double boiler.

This worked well in place of the canned I didn't have and saved me a trip out in the rain. I used a double boiler to prevent the burning issues, but was never able to bring the mix to a boil. It still cooked down and turned out fine. Learned hard way that canned milk is not 14 fluuid ounces and used too much of this in the recipe I was making.

This recipe is also easy to adapt for people who are diabetic.  Just substitute 3/4 of Splenda for the sugar.

This recipe isn't too bad.  It's hard to find sweetened condensed milk here in Germany, so I decided to make my own.  I have made this several times on low heat and it has always turned dark brown, but so far it has worked in recipes that I've tried it in.  I initially liked this recipe due to the simplicity of the ingredients, but it takes way too long to cook on stove top.  I think next time I will try one of the non-cooking recipes on this site.

Flavor isn't very good.  Tastes like dry milk, not regular sweetened condensed milk.

Yes, the directions are lacking.  But the finished product is great.  If you don't know, constant stirring is a must.  I also wouldn't let it full on boil; the stirring should help eliminate this.

I needed 7oz so I used 1/2 C Powdered Milk, 1/4 C Water (mixed together) then added to a double broiler along with 1/2 C Sugar (used Whey Low b/c my husband is a diabetic). Continued to stir for 15 min. Made great Sweetened Condensed Milk.

I made this for the first time today.  It turned out great.  Then I made some flavored coffer creamer.  O, me O my! Good stuff!  I only use 1 to 2 teaspoon in my coffee to my taste.

This recipe makes an excellent substitute for the canned stuff.  I didn't use a double boiler but I used a good solid saucepan, kept the heat med-low and whisked constantly for the 20 minutes and it was great.  No burning or sticking. It was so easy, and relatively quick with ingredients I always have on hand. Thank you to the poster.

Since I can burn fire I read the reviews and went with the double boiler. This is a great substitute for the canned version.

I did this and it works GREAT but you have to keep it on LOW and let it cook...I did some in the microwave with just 1 cup of regular evaporated milk too (instead of the powdered milk)which is MUCH EASIER !! I cooked it in a LARGE bowl for 15 minutes on 50% power, stirring it every 5 minutes.  Be careful when you stir it tho cos it bubbles up.
