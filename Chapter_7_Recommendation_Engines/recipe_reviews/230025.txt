Eggs are the missing ingredient. I doubled the recipe and had to add six eggs. I used two tbsp of vanilla extract and got a nice flavor.

I added two eggs per the other reviewers. The dough was too dry without them. I had the dough all mixed then found I had no vanilla extract. I used two tsp of lemon extract instead. They were very tasty!

I didn't have any baking soda, so I added two per teaspoons of baking powder per a conversion formula I found online (baking soda is more powerful than powder, so 1/4 of soda is equivalent to a teaspoon of powder). Like everyone else, when I had mixed everything together, it was very crumbly and not very dough-like for cookies. So I added two eggs, and brought the dough together quite nicely. For the people that didn't like the taste -- these are meant to be subtly sweet and to be eaten with tea, not by themselves. My family really enjoyed them (hubby and ten month old daughter). I will most likely be making these again, just adding the two eggs automatically after creaming the butter and sugar.

Did not think of the eggs when I tried this so added 1/2 cup of milk. This was enough to make dough which I rolled into a log and sliced 1/4 inch thick. Result was a nice sugar cookie. Cook time was about 12 min's.

I made this recipe as written. It turned out good, but I kept thinking something is missing. Next time I will put in the eggs.

I added 3 eggs and powder sugar, taste was acceptable, but I donâ€™t know if I would make again.
