IF you BAKE the potatoes before peeling them instead of boiling them, the mixture is a bit drier and sticks together better. Also, I tried rolling them in nuts(pecans) and in a mixture of nuts and a crushed FROSTED cereal, a little sweeter crunch with the frosted cereal topping.

This was the 2nd Thanksgiving that I've made this exact recipe. I had to add crushed cornflakes TO THE potato mixture, and that helped firm it up a bit. I never thought of chilling it for awhile. I love this recipe, and so do my picky inlaws!!!

YUM! This recipe is really good! Making the potatoes into balls was a little challenging as mentioned, but after chilling it in the fridge for a while, it was workable. The only problem I had was that the marshmellows kind of disappeared from the inside. I made these ahead and froze them and then had to cook them longer, so maybe that's why. The marshmellow flavor was still there though and they were GREAT!!

These tasted wonderful, but I also absolutely could not make balls out of the mixture.  I had blobs, and trying to roll it around in the corn flake crumbs was impossible too, I kinda put the crumbs on the blobs.  And it seemed to work out.  But what I will do next time, and it should be noted for others as well, is stick the mixture in the fridge for a while so it can be made into balls.  Other than the difficulty shaping and rolling, these were great!

I don't know if it is just me, but I could not shape these into balls to save my life. I ended up just making regular sweet potatoes with this mixture. They were good, but I was disappointed that I couldn't make the balls.

Something wrong with this recipe. I had over 3 individual cups over flowing of sweet potato chunks when I made this recipe. So granted should have been over 4 cups worth. After adding everything per instructions. This recipe was extremely wet and un-pliable to form any sort of ball. I had to cook off another 3-4 cups of sweet potato just to get it thick enough to form, using leftover large orange Halloween marshmallows for the regular large ones in this recipe. Mine also didn't stay in the oven 10-12 minutes and they were exploding and almost flat before plating. Taste-wise, they were okay. Would I attempt this recipe again. I'm sorry to say no. This recipe needs a binder to hold shape.

This is just like my Grandmother used to make.  A word of caution: Take a few minutes off the baking time so the marshmallow in the middle doesn't evaporate. Otherwise its wonderful!

THESE ARE A HIT...I HAD TO CHANGE THEM UP A BIT THOUGH.  INSTEAD OF CORNFLAKES I USED GRAHAM CRACKERS, COCONUT, AND CASHEWS.  THEN WHEN THE BALLS GAVE ME TROUBLES I PUT THEM INTO FOIL MUFFIN CUPS.  MAKE SURE YOU SPRAY THEM FIRST.  YOU CAN MAKE THEM UP AHEAD OF TIME AND FREEZE TOO!

I liked the flavor of this, but the ball of potato look did not go over well in this house.  The corn flakes were a nice touch for the first serving but these do NOT reheat well at all.

The flavor of all the ingredients together was pretty good, but I must have done something wrong in the execution - they did not turn out well at all.  Maybe to me the wording was ambiguous, but I rolled the potato mixture around the marshmallows and then rolled them in cornflakes.  When they baked, the marshmallows melted and I was left with flat sticky chewy lumps.  They tasted alright, but looked hideous and were hard to eat.

I make these every year for Thanksgiving and love them.  Much better than the traditional sweet potato casserole my mom makes.  However, I don't add the brown sugar to my potatoes, I think the they are sweet enough without it.

I wish there was a way to keep the corn flakes crunchy. Other than that we loved it! I used the mini-marshmellows though and just stuck them in randomly on top.

These were super yummy!!  I peeled, cubed and boiled my sweet potatoes until they were tender, then drained them.  Mashed them with butter and a little milk.  Also mixed in a little bit of brown sugar.  Chilled the bowl overnight, then scooped them with scooper into balls and rolled them into graham cracker crumbs.  I put the "balls" into a disposable aluminum pan that was well sprayed with pan spray.  Right before baking them, I combined a couple tbsp. of hot water with some brown sugar to make a thick slurry/glaze and drizzled it on top of the balls.  Baked them around 30 min.  So freaking good!

My grandfather was a cook back in the 50's and this was a traditional staple he would make for Thanksgiving meals.  

Tip: Try the jumbo marshmallows, chill very well before molding.  I have tried a variation over the years and a crowd favorite are frosted corn flakes over reg. corn flakes.  Also, using graham cracker crumbs, coconut and pecans/nuts give them a little twist but still yummy.  I would put these in the oven right before serving as they are so nice and the marshmallow is all melty :)
