This is the first time using this recipe. I liked the idea of using eggnog  with the milk for added flavor. I just used 'Darigold' Eggnog, it is a family favorite. However, as I was cooking it just after I added the large tapioca pearls, I tasted it. Just eggnog and milk was a bit bland. I felt it needed some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.. So I added about 1-2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Even though it says to turn to low and simmer, I noticed that the milk base was sticking to the bottom of my pan. So I did stir it every 5-10 minutes to avoid scorching. After I tempered the eggs (for me it only took about 1/2 C of the hot mixture added small amounts at a time), I cooked for 15 minutes, then tasted. It really was not sweet enough. I added 1/4 C of sugar. Much better! It did set up to be nice and thick. I put plastic wrap just over the top of the pudding mixture (not over the pan) and let it cool, that way it does not get that thick crust on top as it cools. Yummy served with homemade whip cream and a pinch of cinnamon on top. Thanks for the recipe- I will be making it again!!

A bit to laborious in directions. Next time I would just follow the directions on my tapioca box using eggnog since the directions are so much simpler. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the directions on the box of Minute tapioca to make this recipe easier, just using eggnog in place of half of the milk and adding some cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  VERY good!  I think it was best warm.

I replaced milk and eggnog with vanilla almond milk and added 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar. Very good but not too rich or sweet.
