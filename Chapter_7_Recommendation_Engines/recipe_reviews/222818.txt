Instead of grilling I floured and pan seared the fish (medium flame) with a little butter.  Browned both sides, lowered the flame, covered it, when almost cooked I poured 1 tbls of sauce and covered again. Fish remained seared and not soggy. I roasted flaked coconut w a pinch of raw sugar in a little butter then added the cilantro/green onion topping.  To serve: pour some sauce on the plate; place the fish on top of sauce, top with the roasted coconut topping. Served with a side of white rice and black beans. AMAZING!

No mention in recipe as to what to do with the cilantro and green onion.  I used as garnish when serving.  With all of these flavorful ingredients, I thought this recipe would be power-packed with flavor.  Not the case.  Unfortunately, I found it a bit bland.  Sorry, only 3*'s from me.

very good - I baked it, just a little Olive Oil in bottom of glass pan, lay the fillets in and lightly salted them - poured the sauce over the top, covered with foil and baked 25 minutes...it was amazing!!

I would say this was a 3.5-4 recipe; pretty good but nothing amazing. It definitely needed some salt and no skimping on the ginger--needs all of it for the right flavor. I think the lemongrass & thai basil other reviewers used would've really made this even more delicious. We all liked it enough to make it again but will probably keep playing with it. Other big change I did, to make it easier was to just cook the fish in the coconut sauce. It was very moist & flavorful & made this dish even easier to make.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I've made it for my family several times and they love it. My guess on some of the "it's bland" comments is that they didn't use the fish sauce. Good fish sauce makes this wonderful.

I used less ginger and added just a little more garlic.  My husband went crazy for the sauce. I wish I had taken a photo but we devoured it all and fast!  I used it with fresh-caught Mahi Mahi from our boat trip the day before.  It was amazing. I broiled the Mahi first with a sprinkle of gluten-free panko crumbs over the filets.  Yum!

Pretty good! I cooked it with chicken breast which made for a nice, light dinner. I added a bit of chili powder to the sauce to give it an extra zing and it really helped. Does not yield as much sauce as shown.

My mom loved the sauce for this dish. I did the whole recipe by the letter and  I found that adding the extra cilantro and green onions at the end was a bit too strong. Also, the sauce needed more salt. My mother added some before trying. All in all, a good recipe.

Yes I pan saut√©ed the fish- tasted sauce and seemed bland - added a dash of Srarcha sauce and close to two tablespoons brown sugar - much much better- would be a great base for a Thai soup!

Fish was good, but the sauce was surprisingly bland. Would not recommend this one.

Made this for the people I nanny for and they both loved it! Will def make it again. He actually doesn't like coconut milk but said it was great before he knew what was in it. *I used half hoisin sauce/half soy sauce because I didn't have fish sauce.

I added one crushed lemongrass stalk to the sauce and thai basil as a garnish. My toddler and DH both devoured it. I needed a bit more lime, but I also didn't measure it well.

Great flavor in the coconut sauce. I followed directions nearly all the way, but also threw in some of the sauce  with the fish during the end of the cooking time. It kept the meat nice and moist. A super easy and delicious main dish.
