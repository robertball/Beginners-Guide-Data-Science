I was skeptical about the guacamole seasoning mix but given all the 5 star reviews I decided to risk it.  Boy am I glad I did!  This was great!  I had an 8 oz package of the smoked salmon and just kept adding it in until I ended up using the entire package. I also use more onion - a bunch of scallions chopped - both whites and greens.  I couldn't find McCormick's so went with another brand of seasoning.   We ate it immediately because after the first taste we couldn't stop.  Of course, refrigerating and waiting to let the flavors come together made it even better the next day.   This is something I've made again and again! Since the first time I made this I've gone back to it and served it piped into fresh sugar snap pea pods - great contrast and crunch.  I've served it at dinner parties and for a large appetizer party I 'catered' and it was one of the first to go. The Best way to eat this is on green apple slices - wonderful flavor contrast! Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.

Very representative of Seattle! I used Steelhead Trout I smoked myself. This was delicious and hearty. I'll use this for game day for sure.

Absolutely delicious!  It's been sitting in the fridge all day for the flavors to blend, but I did have a taste this morning and it was definitely 5 stars already! The smoked salmon (not the same as lox) that I bought was a little bit difficult to flake, so I just threw all the ingredients into my food processor and it made things so easy! Next time I will try it with lox-style smoked salmon. I imagine it'll be just as tasty!

I couldn't find the white cheddar cheese. I had the orange, but I don't really think it needs it.  We liked it without it.  We had it on celery, apples with a sprinkle of cinnamon, salami and our favorite "Mary's Gone Crackers".

Took this appetizer to a wine club party and got rave reviews. We were drinking Willamette Pinot Noirs and the smoked salmon was the perfect complement to that lovely wine.
I made my own guacamole seasoning with ingredients I had at home .

I desperately wanted to love this recipe. I made it exactly according to instructions. It was overwhelmingly salty! Smoked salmon is salty, white cheddar is salty and the guacamole dip powder is salty. I’m a saltaholic and even I can’t handle it. Any cracker I would use adds salt. The flavor is there, so if they made low sodium guacamole mix it would be good.

Followed the recipe as directed. When I tasted it, it was ok, but after refrigerating overnight, the flavor seemed to bloom. It really was good and it received many compliments.

First, I was unsure of the use of  guacamole  dip mix but it was amazing and had the right amount of seasoning. I had a smaller package of smoked salmon so I adjusted it accordingly. I chilled mine a couple of hours but the leftovers were chilled overnight and the flavor was even better.

I also added a whole bunch of green onions and increased the salmon to 6 ounces, as that was the size of the package I had.  This dip has wonderful flavor and is my go to salmon dip recipe.

My only additions were a tablespoon of fresh dill and some lemon zest.  Turned out great!

A big hit at family gathering, even with person who doesn't usually eat salmon.  Used 1/2 of guacamole packet and it seemed perfect!  Definitely a recipe to make again.

I made this using Trader Joe's smoked salmon. I added extra salmon, lemon zest and capers to taste, then served on toasted baguette.  I used only 1/2 the package of McCormick's seasoning blend. I bet this would be good heated too!

My goodness, this is a tasty dip!  I made this as directed, and I suggest adding a bit more salmon, if you have it.  The flavor came through for me, but I would love more.  Very good with celery for a dipper!

This is a new favorite! Absolutely loved this recipe. We used fresh lemon juice and handmade mayonnaise to spruce it up. We also chose not to mix in the salmon and instead place the salmon on top of the mix and cracker. Delicious, and will be serving at all parties in the near future :)

This was really, really good. I only used half the packet of guacamole mix so now I have some for the next time I make it - haha. 
I used orange cheddar because I misread the recipe before grocery shopping but it worked out fine. I wasn't sure why the cheese needed to be divided so I just tossed everything in together. Definitely better as it sits but that wasn't a surprise. 
Serve with something to cut the richness - I used pita chips. Husband loved it which is always a win!
