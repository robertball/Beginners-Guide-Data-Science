My son's girlfriend is vegetarian and I'll often look to see what quick things I can make for dinner when she comes to visit. I came across this recipe, and since I love italian, I thought, sure!! Sorry, Ragu, but I typically use a different brand of jar sauce, so I believe that is the only alteration I made, except for doubling the recipe!! Delish !! Sprinkled on lots of mozzarella too !!

I found this when I was looking for something really quick and easy to make one night.  It was really good, easy and more hearty than plain baked penne.  I will keep this for those 'on the run' days.

I don't know how this got such great ratings. It's jarred pasta sauce with frozen veggies. It's edible but much more appropriate as a side dish. But I don't think I would even serve it as that.

I normally don't review, but this was amazing.  I did add a couple things.  I used the same amount of parmesan and mozz. cheese in the mixture.  I used Ragu's Chopped Tomato, Olive Oil, and Garlic Sauce, 3/4 box of mini farfelle (16 oz), a can of chili ready diced tomatoes-I drained some of the juice before adding it (you could also use italian diced tomatoes), the frozen Italian vegetables, and added some italian seasoning and paprika to the sauce mix before adding the veggies and pasta.  I also added more than a cup of cheese to the top, but I also love cheese.  Yummy!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because of taste and how easy it is to make.  I made this for my neighbor and found it to be easy to make yet it looks like you spent a lot of time on it!  I highly recommend shredding your own mozzarella cheese, it gives it a creamier and fresh taste.  I also added a few spices that I had on hand, garlic powder, Mrs. Dash herbs, sea salt, pepper, and a little oregano.  The best part of this recipe is the veggies, they turn out surprisingly crunchy and flavorful.  I would recommend you add a little extra pasta sauce because it cooks off and you end up with dry pasta on the top of the casserole.  Add enough sauce to  cover the top of the casserole, it will cook down to just the right level when it's done.

I am giving this 4 stars because it tasted great for being so incredibly easy. I followed the recipe except I used 1/2 cup less mozzarella (so, 1 & 1/2 instead of 2) and I used a different sauce (Classico Tomato Basil). I don't know if I was just hungry or what but I ate a ton of it. Very satisfying meal, but I wish I could lighten it up without losing flavor. Other than the cheese reduction, I'm not sure how it could be lightened.

This gets a five for being so easy. I tossed in veggies I had on hand, such as frozen green beans and bell pepper slices. I added some garlic salt and Italian seasoning to suit our tastes and I had it cooked and eaten in under 30 minutes. Oh, I didn't bake it, just made it all in one pot, then topped it with parmesan and mozzarella when I plated it. Yum!

Good basic recipe. Made a few changes for family tastes, and used some fresh veggies, and it came out delicious!

Yes, this is very good. I think the secret is to use your personal favorite spaghetti sauce. I could not find Italian-style veggies either, so I just picked out my favorite kind with green beens, brocolli, red peppers, etc. I did not use measuring cups, just eye-balled the ingredients. 4 stars for ease, cheap ingredients and of course taste!

This was surprisingly good for such a quick and easy to make dish. I follwed the recipe exactly, and everyone liked it. I think next time I might substitute some Asiago cheese for some of the mozzarella and add some minced garlic or garlic powder to make it more flavourful. Thanks!

Very easy to make. The vegetables were a bit too crunchy for me even though they were defrosted. I would add a bit more flavoring e.g. garlic or salt and I cooked the pasta very al dente so it wouldn't get too soft in the casserole. My husband really liked it and I will probably make it again. It was very good but not outstanding.

Super quick, super easy! We thought this was really good - I followed the recipe mostly except that I cut down the cheese I used because I didn't quite have 2 cups of mozzarella.  I used whole wheat pasta also to make it more healthy.  My 18 month old daughter liked it and my hubby said he really liked the added texture and flavor the veggies added. It seems like it will warm up well too, but I guess I'll find out for sure tomorrow!

Easy and delicious.  Standard fare at my home for over a month because it was so simple to prepare.

A good recipe, I suspect it would have been better with fresh vegetables though.

I love this recipe.  I have already made it twice and will be making it any more times.  I was unable to find Italian-system veggies, so I used corn, peas, green beans, and carrots.   It was wonderful.  I also did not put in the parmesan cheese the second time, I could not tell the difference.  Very cheap good meal.  Thanks!

I followed the recipes 'as is' and it was delicious.  The vegetables and pasta make it a filling meal even without any meat.  It was quick, easy and yummy!

I did it with the suggested substitute of Cheddar cheese.  I used whole wheat penne.  It turned out awesome!  Everyone in the family enjoyed it, including a 4 and a 7 year old.  I plan that this recipe, and variations of it, will be incorporated into our regular home cooked meal schedule.
