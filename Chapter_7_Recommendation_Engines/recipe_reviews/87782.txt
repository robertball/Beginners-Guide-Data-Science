My family and I loved this recipe. The chicken was moist and flavourful. I motified the recipe only a little to suit what I had on hand: I used hamburger buns; My grill pan is not thatlarge so I placed the chicken on a pan with a spoon of salsa and cheese on top,then I put it in a warm oven while I toasted the buns. I also marinated the chicken in the salsa mixture before grilling.
