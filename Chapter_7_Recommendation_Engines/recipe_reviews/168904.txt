This recipe is awesome.  Very similar to the one I cook except I use fat port (fatback) instead of bacon.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this and it tastes very good. It is relatively simple but it is not " traditional" nor " Maritime" nor a Hodge Podge.
Garlic, onions, bacon are not ingredients of  a traditional hodge podge.
But a good meal which I'm sure your grandmother prepared very often in late July and August.

I made this without the bacon(because I didnt have any really) Added parsnips and turnip as well. Used milk instead of cream, again didnt have any but had a hankering for hodgepodge. Wonderful & hearty. Defo more delish day 2 & 3.

This recipe is excellent! It will take you right back to your Gramma's kitchen!!  Takes awhile to prepare but worth it.
