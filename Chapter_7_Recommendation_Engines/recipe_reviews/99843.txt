Pretty good! I added some onion, green pepper, and more seasonings as ground turkey can be bland without the extra umppppph!

Made this recipe with 1/2 turkey and 1/2 ground beef to add a little moisture, in addition I added a 1/4 cup of diced onion.  To whoever said this meal in "dry and uninteresting," add your own spin on it.

This turned out really great, esp. since it was my first attempt at a meatloaf.  I used different seasonings IE. garlic, dried onion, teriyaki sauce.  I also, put mushrooms in the middle and then put the cheese on top of that.

Personally, I am not a fan of much of anything in "loaf" form, but my kids and husband couldn't stop raving about it! Anything that gets that kind of reaction gets 5 stars in my book!

Easy to make with on-hand ingredients.  I spiced it up with some garlic and onion powder, sazon from Goya, and Spike rather than salt.  Nice change of pace!

I think that this is a FABULOUS recipe.  You can do anything with it...add ingredients...or nothing, follow the recipe exactly, and it's still great.  My boyfriend requests it at least once per week.  Thanks!

I just made this, and I am hoping it turns out well. I am a vegan. It is for a friend who had a baby. I used to eat poultry, and I always enjoyed turkey loaf. I have a fav recipe on allrecipes, but didn't have the ingrediants on hand. I think this will be good. My modifications were skipping the cooking spray (we just shouldn't eat things in aerosol cans), was sadly out of parsley, skipped adobo seasoning, added garlic powder, dried minced onions, only had 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, so I made up the rest with wheat germ, and I put 3/4 cup of cheddar inside. On the top I put Trader Joes barbecue sauce. AGain, I think it will be good.

I used this last night - as the first time EVER making any type of meatloaf. I added diced onions and used parcley and garlic seasoning. I could not find Adobo seasoning. I thought it turned out really well. I plan on making it again! 
I also HATE tomato sause so this was a really good alturnative for me.

A quick & easy but flavorful mess of love! I did not have cheddar cheese though, so I used an Italian six cheese blend and it still came out great! Will be making this again with cheddar cheese as I think it would go better with the typical meatloaf topping of ketchup/BBQ sauce/both. Only things I changed where adding a whole tablespoon of adobo seasoning as well as basil with garlic breadcrumbs because I am a garlicaholic. I was also able to serve 5 so thank you for this nice spin on meatloaf recipe!

This was great and at an hour not dry at all.  I used this as a base recipe.  What I did differently is I added one tsp olive oil to the meat mixture, used seasoned bread crumbs, instead of the adobo seasoning I used a tsp of onion powder, 1.5 tsp of garlic powder, two dashes paprika, and a dash of ground mustard. I also mixed in 1/4 cup of cheese into the meat mixture.  In the filling I added broccoli florets to the cheese and it was amazing.

We are a No dairy, No egg, No gluten family so I used this as a base and modified according to our needs.  It came out AMAZING! I made a homemade BBQ sauce (mustard based) for the top.  Make sure you have extra bbq sauce to serve with meatloaf!

Absolutely wonderful !!   Only one minor addition--worchester sauce--my husband and I love it so added 2 T. Kept everything else exactly as written.   This was moist and cheesy.  It is a keeper.

This was really good - the whole family liked it! I have an herb garden so I substituted some different herbs for the seasoning. Definite make again.

Very good. It seemed very dry as I mixed the ingredients so I added some leftover spaghetti sauce. I made the loaf in the center of a very large glass baking dish and halfway through cooking time added some potatoes, carrots, and cauliflower around the loaf. I still had some spaghetti sauce left so I added some brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard and topped the loaf with that for a glaze instead of the optional cheddar cheese.

I followed the recipe except that I added half an onion, some minced garlic and used a monty jack/cheddar mix cheese. I used 2 pounds of meat, 1 was turkey, the other was beef. Also do not have a full size bread pan, instead I use one that bakes 4 small loaves. Because of this, I cook for a little shorter time. I have added a picture.

Because I have been a vegetarian for most of my adult life, I hadn't had much experience with meat. But since my hubby is a big meat lover I decided to spread my cooking horizons. I used ground chicken (it was cheaper that day), omitted parsley and adobo (I have Polish seasoning which is almost like it but has no MSG and no Sodium), added 1/2 tsp oregano,1 tsp basil, 3/4 bunch of green onions finely chopped, and 1/2 small can of Organic Tomato Paste. I also used 1 cup of Panko Seasoned bread crumb. My daughter and hubby loved it. I cooked it in NuWave oven for 35 minutes (for those of you who want to bake things quicker and cheaper, NuWave Oven is the way to go). I'm going to make this recipe again since it was such a hit.
I wasn't sure what to serve it with so I just sauteed some Broccoli. Low fat dinner that tastes delicious.

This was delicious. I've made one alternation--instead of adobo seasoning, I've used Creole seasoning and it tastes so good. Although it was tricky to top the meatloaf with the cheese, I've done it after it cooked in a regular circular pan, since I had no loaf pans.  Yum! I would love to make this again.

Mushy and bland. Weird texture. I really don't think cheddar cheese and ground turkey go together.

I used pepper jack cheese in the center and on top, just personal preference, and my boyfriend and I both thought it was delicious!  A little different texture than traditional beef meatloaf but yummy!
