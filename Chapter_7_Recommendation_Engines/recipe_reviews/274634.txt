Turned out great. Typically we do not test new recipes on company....they loved this chicken.

The dipping sauce (strangely enough) has a flavor profile similar to a vinaigrette.

Made this twice so far since the video aired, my new go to chicken thigh recipe!

I use the full 2 tbsp of black peppercorns, it adds a nice punch. Definitely will look into other Laotian recipes now!

Excellent recipe. We followed it precisely. I have a problem with people not giving five stars to a recipe yet saying they changed it. You need to give the original recipe a chance.

I didn't make any change other than marinating it overnight so I could have it ready to put on the grill after work.  I thought it was good without the sauce, but then tried the sauce and it was amazing.  Definitely, one that we will make again.  The sauce would also be good for fresh and fried spring rolls.

And yet another 5-star dish from Chef John. His recipes never disappoint. This was absolutely delicious and the dipping sauce,  just divine. I marinated the chicken overnight. Followed the recipe to the letter. Will definitely make this again....and again...and again. Thank you!

I just finished making this dish as a birthday present to myself. If I were to make it again, I would slice the thighs thinly to cook better, using a frying pan, or use chicken breasts instead and do the same. The thighs looked nice in the package but when I pulled them out, I had a nasty job of trying to remove most of the fat which on a kilo of chicken weighed in at one gram. Chef John put the lid down on his BBQ and so finally I covered the pan because they were taking far too long to cook. I would use the full two tablespoons of pepper because I wimped out, put only one and when they made their appearance, I wished there were more. I'll try it again with said provisos. The dipping sauce was  hein. Less vinegar more chili sauce and cayenne! I have yet to perfect it before serving to guests.

This turned out great!!!
I followed the recipe exactly and smoked it on low heat (+/- 90c) for a couple of hours with apple wood, and served on a bed of rice.  
A fantastic outcome
