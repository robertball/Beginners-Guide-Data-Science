I used my instant pot for the chicken, it shredded easily and then mixed it with some Bullseye Bold BBQ sauce. It turned out great.

I swapped the chicken breasts for boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I found it more flavorful!

3.8.17  I recently bought a bunch of chicken thighs for 99¢/lb, so I used them instead of the chicken breasts (we like the thighs better anyway).    I think to a large extent the success of this recipe is dependent upon the Carolina-style BBQ sauce that you use, and I’m fortunate, because I have a recipe for a  good one.  Very happy with the way this turned out, and although I didn’t use mini sweet rolls, I did use small hamburger buns.

Wasn't bad, but the 3 hours on HIGH in the slow cooker gave me undercooked chicken.  You may need to grill and/or let the slow cooker go longer to get the full cook (I had this timed out perfectly, so I had to use the microwave - obviously, don't do that if you can avoid it).

I used pruscetta instead of pepperoni. It was gone before I could take a picture of it!

It was easy as pie!! It was a hit with my family and we just used hamburger buns! The coleslaw tastes better if you make it when you start slow cooker rather than waiting until it's done.??

A bit more work than I had anticipated, but my family loved it. It was amazing on the sweet potato rolls as well!
