Great start for a recipe! I added garlic and corn and onions, and it was amazing!

This tasted good but it was runny and hard to eat.  It didn't go over very well at a party.

I think this is a fantastic dip!  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I only added half the taco seasoning because I didn't want that to be the main flavor.  Next time I wont blend it as much so as to leave it 'chunky' for dipping.  I'm making it again for Christmas and I expect it to be a big hit.

I made this yesterday. It was great. I think the next time I make it I will put some jalapeno peppers in it for a little extra kick.
