This stuff is great, a perfect topper for a chocolate bundt cake! As another reviewer mentioned, an extra tablespoon of butter made it even better. But the best thing about this is that no cooking is required! (Because it's not cooked, by the way, real vanilla extract is better than imitation in this recipe--not so chemical-tasting.) For those of you who found it a bit stiff, it may be that the butter wasn't quite soft enough. A few seconds on low in the microwave should fix that.

With the addition of another tablespoon of butter, it came out perfect.  I used it to glaze a bundt cake.

This gave me a good start.
I used only 1 cup of confectioners sugar, and I mixed over low heat until smooth. I didn't bother with the vanilla, or with the sifting.

(Varitions try adding a little Kahlua instead of milk).

Perfect topping for a bundt cake. Easy and quick. The only change I made was to melt the butter - I tend to forget to take it out of the fridge in time to wait for it to soften. Will use this frequently.

This was an ok recipe but not what you would call a glaze...i had to add more milk and heat like 10 seconds in microwave in order to get to a drizzle consitency but other than that it was ok..not bad..

Pretty tasty, but I had to add WAY more milk for it to be drizzle-able! The said recipe made it a thick frosting...I had to look over the recipe a few times to make sure I was doing it right, but I was. So, my advice is MORE MILK!

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. It was the only recipe I found that contained ingredients I already had in the house. I whipped it together in 5 minutes and it came out great!  Thanks!

an extra tablespoon of butter like everyone else said and this worked lovely!  I only used half the recipe, if you would like it to cover the entire cake, a whole batch will work very nicely

This glaze is really surprisingly good! I hate conf.sugar icing for the most part..b/c they all taste like wet, flavored conf.sugar..yuck. But found myself in a pinch and needed a topping for a choc bunt cake. I used 3 lg. T of cocoa pwd. and 2 T. butter and a little more than 4 T. milk (just to the consistency you want) and 1/2 t. van. And  if this glaze didn't taste just like melted milk chocolate! ...and a plus: it looks great on a dark cake. Thanks for this recipe.

Good recipe, with small changes I will definitely use it again.  I too added an extra tablespoon of butter (as recommended by other reviewers).  In order to make this more of a glaze (rather than an icing) it required at least one more tbsp of liquid.  I chose to make the glaze primarily with Kahlua which tasted soooo good!  I used approximately 4tbsp Kahlua and 1tbsp of milk to make it drizzle-able.

I frequently use a combination of the ingredients in this recipe for the frosting I typically make.  I adapted them to make a dairy free frosting by using a dairy free Smart Balance spread (instead of butter) and vanilla flavored soy milk.  I ended up using less soy milk than the recipe called for.

This was delicious!  I melted the butter almost completely to provide smoother mixing and also used 2Tbsp butter to give it more creaminess, 4 Tbsp Kahlua and 1 1/2Tbsp milk for the right taste/texture.  I also added a pinch of salt (no more than 1/4tsp).  HEATING the milk first will help with blending and create a very smooth glaze.  I would have cut this recipe in HALF to drizzle a bundt like in the pic. I had enough frosting to coat the entire cake. (like that's a bad thing??)

Came out too tan, not dark chocolate colored like I expected.  followed recipe as instructed. Tastes like powdered sugar only and too runny.

might use again in a pinch (all ingredients are pretty much guaranteed to have on hand).  tasted...fake...ended up adding 1 oz of unsweetened baker's chocolate, that made it a bit better.  also used more butter as suggested by quite a few others.  and I zapped it in the microwave to get everything smooth and well blended and more drizzly...I was feeling lazy and was looking for something easy..I should've just used my regular recipe that is a bit more involved because by the time I was done tweaking this recipe, it took just as long!

Good - halved it, microwaved for a few seconds to pouring consistency, and added a few dashes of cinnamon.  Poured over a bundt cake.  Easy and does the job....added an extra T. of butter per other reviews.

this was a very good recipe. I made a few adjustments (based off of previous reviews). I only used 3/4 cup of the confectioners sugar, and added about 1 1/2 tbsp of butter. kept the milk as the suggested amount along with the vanilla flavoring. I could not have asked for a better chocolate glaze- quick, easy, tasted great! I used this to top a chocolate chip bundt cake- it was a hit!

I used this as the base for a very nice dark chocolate kahlua glaze.  I increased the cocoa powder (to taste)  and did 1 tbsp Kahlua.  Mixed the cocoa powder, kahlua, melted butter and milk and stirred in a double boiler (bowl in a pot) until smooth and then added to powdered sugar.  Delightful!

Very good. I used an extra tbsp. of butter and an extra tbsp. of milk to get the right consistancy. Excellent taste, smooth and satiny. A keeper.

This glaze is just right for bundt cake! You can make it without the cocoa powder and it's a very yummy vanilla glaze.

I did use an extra tablespoon of butter, and heated it up in the microwave so it would actually drizzle. I thought it was too sweet, and added an extra tablespoon of cocoa.

I followed the recipe to a tee and I got an out of this world Chocolate FROSTING, not glaze. I put in on a bundt cake and it looks and tastes marvelous. But beware- it is not a glaze. It is spreadable but not drizzleable.

Wow! I love this glaze! So easy and yummy! I added a little bit more cocoa to make it more chocolately and it worked great. Also added extra butter like others mentioned to do. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I was looking for a simple chocolate glaze for four small bundt cakes I had made.   I used a little extra milk to get the drizzling consistency I wanted.  It worked out very well.

This worked wonderfully for me! I needed a glaze for Banana Bread Cookies, (also on this site), and I didn't want to mess with melting chocolate so this was perfect. I love the flavor but wanted it a bit more intense so I added 1 more tablespoon of cocoa powder. That did the trick! Thanks so much! :o)

Too much confectioner's sugar.  Maybe less of that and more cocoa would have helped.

I used this on a Dark Chocolate Bunt Cake I had made for my mom for her birthday. It worked really well. I did have to add a bit more milk to get the consistency I wanted, plus I followed other reviews tip to use more butter.

This recipe is definitely easy and tastes yummy, but it makes so much! I glazed a bundt cake and had too much glaze. I guess that's better than not enough! Next time I will 1/2 the recipe. BTW: I added 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1/2 tablespoon milk to get the glaze to the consistency I wanted.

The flavor of this glaze was really good.  However, this was more like a frosting rather than a glaze.  The color was really lite and did not look anything like the pic.  I added some store bought chooclate fudge to make it darker.

This was a easy, tasty glaze that I used with a chocolate bundt cake.     I was a little worried when I was stirring the milk into the dry ingredients as it was very dry.  Once all the milk was added it was a pefect consistency.

Turned out this is not what I was looking for, I wanted a glaze not a frosting.  I added extra butter, milk and cocoa.  I was wanting a glaze for a bundt cake that did not call for chocolate chips because I do not have any. It tastes good though so I will give it four stars.  This is best with a dark cocoa.

lytha is right that the chocolate flavour isn't really there so u need to add more cocoa and sugar.  but besides that, i thought it turned out ok.  i used applesauce instead of butter to make it healthier, and it still ok but i don't know how chocolate lovers would feel about that.  anyway, i used this glaze to cover a chocolate banana cake and it suited it well.

Great tasting and low fat!  Directions were a little unclear... I cooked over double boiler until smooth and runny.  I used it over an angel food cake (no fat) and it wasn't too heavy.  Dried hard and not dull!

This is a good and easy glaze. I did make some changes like a lot of other people I used more butter but I doubled the cocoa powder. I mixed every thing up and heated it in the microwave for 15 seconds at a time. Doing that helps the sugar desovle so it not so gritty.

It wasn't enough chocolate flavor for me so I had to add about another tablespoon of cocoa as well as a little more butter. After mixing it I put it in the microwave for 25 seconds,just enough for it to pour and run down the sides,it quickly set up and taste great!

Very tasty, but without the addition of extra milk, it is also very thick.
I sat the bowl in warm water to melt the butter, sifted the sugar and cocoa, but it never got smooth. A little heat may help with that, or even more milk.
Easy and tasty enough to be a versatile "go to" chocolate glaze!

Substitute coffee for the milk and cook over low heat stirring constantly until it starts to simmer. Yum!

Very good, easy, simple, even though I had to add some more milk it was very good. Thanks 

P.S I also added about maybe 3-4 Tablespoons of corn syrup to make it dry nice and shiny and beautiful.
