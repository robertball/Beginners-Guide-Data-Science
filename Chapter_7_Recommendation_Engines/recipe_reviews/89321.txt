This recipe was an instant family hit and is now a favourite.

In the last 20 minutes I top it with diced tomatoes, fresh basil and feta cheese.

The only other thing I would strongly recomend is to brown the chicken beforehand so that it doesn't look so pale on the plate.

Very very easy and good! I drizzled a little bit of balsamic vinegar on top before baking then added some mozzarella during the last 15 minutes of baking. Turned out very juicy.

We loved this flavorful and healthy dish.  I used fresh basil, but got lazy and used dried minced garlic.  It was very moist and tender.  Unlike others, we had no desire to add the extra calories and fat of a cheese topping.  Next time, I might sprinkle a little extra salt, basil, and parsley on top of the tomato slices.  This is definitely going to be a regular at our house!

This recipe is SOO good! I put a ton of minced garlic and covered the chicken with as many slices of romano tomatos as I could (love em!) and left out the red pepper flakes ...I placed it on wild rice and topped with shredded parmasan cheese and it was AMAZING!  My husband couldn't believe how clean the kitchen was when I was done! Very easy, very good ...we were very impressed!

This recipe was so quick and easy and delicious! I made a few slight changes. I marinated the chicken in the seasonings along with a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 1/2 c of chicken boullion - then baked as noted. One last change - as also suggested - I topped tomatos with thinly sliced mozzarella cheese. Just heavenly!

This is very tasty, but nothing fancy. I used 1 lb of boneless chicken tenders figuring that was a good estimate for 4 breasts. I did use jarred, minced garlic instead of fresh - I spread about 1/4-1/2 tsp on each breast.  Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used half a can of diced tomatoes with most of the juice drained. Otherwise I made the recipe as stated with spice amounts and cooking method. Make sure to not overcook the chicken after you uncover it, otherwise it will be too dry. Ours turned out moist and yummy! My poor daughter did get a bite with a bunch of red pepper - oops! My husband and I loved the spice, though. The liberal seasoning is the key to this recipe to keep it from being bland. Next time I make this, I may marinate the chicken in a little Italian dressing first. Definitely a keeper!

We enjoyed this recipe, although I used fresh herbs in place of the dried ones, which I think were a lot more flavorful. I used tablespoons of fresh in place of teaspoons of dried herbs. We're also not huge tomato people, so I used a little bit of diced tomatoes and some diced onions on top of the chicken. I might use some chicken broth in the pan next time for a little sauce to pour over rice or pasta. Overall, this was a nice recipe.

Super easy and really tasty! I like to use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and I also squeeze fresh lemon onto the chicken after it's done baking. The lemon really adds a lot! This recipe is definitely going into my dinner rotation!

Chicken with Garlic, Basil & Parsley Haiku: "Kind of a 'meh' dish. Odd, because it smelled SO good. Needs more ... I dunno." I followed the recipe exactly (mincing garlic instead of slicing) and while the chicken was extra-juicy and tender, the flavor just didn't do it for me, or well, the lack of more flavor. Yes, it's super-easy, and definitely a healthy dish (maybe I should've taken all the reviewers' suggestion of topping w/ mozzarella, thereby decreasing the healthy factor?), but wow, chicken that isn't browned 1st just looks so pale and wiggly on a plate. If I made this recipe again, I would definitely brown the chicken first and maybe mix fresh herbs instead of dried w/ olive oil and brush it on while it bakes. Still, for the ease of preparation, it wasn't terrible, just sorta "yawn."

This recipe was great! Both my husband and I enjoyed this very much.  I prepared it mostly as written, except that I rubbed the chicken with the herb mixture and allowed it to sit for about a half hour before cooking.  It came out very juicy and flavorful.

I took advice from some of the "most helpful" reviewers:  I mixed about 3/4 cup chicken broth and 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, the spices and garlic all together then MARINATED the chicken in this mix for a couple hours before baking.  In the last 20 min of baking I added chopped tomato, red onion, feta, fresh basil, a squirt of fresh lemon juice right before serving.  The chicken was SO JUICY and delicious!  My hubby who isn't a huge chicken fan had THIRDS!!  Thanks so much to the original poster and all the helpful reviewers too!

Very good!  I left off the pepper flakes because I was feeding young children.  I also drizzled with balsamic vinegar, and just before pulling it out of the oven I turned it off and sprinkled feta cheese over top then let it sit in the oven for a couple of minutes to melt.  My daughter said " this is so much better than plain chicken".

Works better if you take the chicken breast and flatten them, season them as a rub then grill instead of baking...more flavor generates throughout the meat!

I have to give this five stars because my picky-picky eater hubby and daughter SCARFED this down.  I did things a little different in preparing it though.  I used Fiesta Party Dip mix instead of red peppers and instead of baking it, I sauteed in a frying pan.  I put a Tbsp of butter in the pan, dropped in about a rounded tsp of minced garlic and half of the herb/salt mix.  Spread it around in the pan and then layed my cut up chicken breast in the pan, covered and cooked for five minutes.  Sprinkled the rest of the herb mix on top, flipped the chicken in the pan to brown the other side then transferred to a baking sheet.  I then broiled the herbed chicken breast with shredded mozzerella/asiago cheese on top.  Also instead of slice tomato, I put about a cup full of canned crushed tomatoes in the pan that I sauteed the chicken in and let that cook to get warm and slightly thickened and served a dollop of this tomato sauce on top of each piece of chicken.  I served this over penne rosa and it was a big hit/definite keeper!

Use fresh herbs instead of dried and definitely top with feta cheese at the end. INCREDIBLE FLAVOR and super easy to make. I only had 2 chicken breasts so cook for 25 minutes only or you'll have slightly overdone chicken.

The chicken comes out very juicy! I think the recipe could ease up on the amount of basil and parsley required.. 2 teaspoons (instead of 3) would be enough. Also, if you don't like spicy food, don't use red pepper flakes (maybe a little black pepper would suffice). I'll be making this again and tweaking until it's perfect (for me :P).

This was so boring and very bland, but it is palatable if you shred the chicken breast, put it on split focaccia for a sandwich, add roasted red pepper strips, mozzarella cheese, and loads of garlic mayonnaise.  Otherwise, you're wasting your chicken breasts because the flavors do not get into the meat, and you might as well eat your chicken tastelessly boiled.

It was good. Next time, I wouldn't do so much parsley. And I added the tomatoes at the last 15 minutes.

Was a total hit with my family!  As other reviews have stated I marinated the chicken for about 1 hour to get more flavor.  I then put a can of diced tomatoes and sliced up a medium zucchini to top it off.  I had to cook about 10 minutes longer and basted the top of zucchini with the juices the last 20 minutes.  Will totally make again and again!

i used a little advice from everyone's post and it came out delicious. I marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegar and chicken bouilli. After a few hours, I used fresh parsley and fresh basil on bottom of baking pan. I browned the chicken before baking. I think that the crushed red pepper put a kick in the dish that was needed and I drizzzled balsamic on before baking. I topped with tomatoes and baked 25 min. During the last 15 minutes I topped with feta cheese and it came out great. My boyfriend said it looked professional and he loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and easy! I used fresh chopped basil and parsley from my garden, and garlic salt since I was out of fresh garlic. Sprinkled a little parmesan on top of the tomato and gave it a few minutes under the broiler before it was done. My husband also loved it! Comforting home cooked Italian flavors. Low fat, too.

Really enjoyed this.  I used fresh basil and tomatoes from my garden.  Next time I will mince the garlic, it was really strong sliced.  

I love that it's so quick and easy.  I can see why people think it's a little bland; I may add some cheese on top next time.  I cooked it 15 minutes covered and 10 uncovered.  It was really juicy and good with the fresh tomatoes.

Updated:  added Mozzarella when uncovering and that was really good.

Quick and easy meal, and very tasty.
I modded it a little, and used tomato sauce on top, instead of the slices.

YUM YUM YUM! I just eyed the spices and i sliced the garlic and covered the chicken breasts with the slices. our family loves garlic! but it wasnt too garlicy where it would be a meal to get rid of a vampire! just sliced the tomato and put it on top. very very good! and when it was on the plates i drizzled it with lemon for myself. it was sooooooooo good. everyone else copied me with the lemon. it was even fought over for lunch leftovers!

Very nice dish and super easy.  I also sliced up a medium onion and layered on top of the tomatoes.
Thanks for the recipe.

This was quite an easy recipe. I changed it up a bit and topped it with sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese.  I more than sprinkled the spices as well. I gave the breasts a good covering so if you go that route, increase the measurements of the spices.

The chicken was virtually flavorless.  I couldn't recommend this recipe unless you like really dull flavors.

So good and so simple!  I did add a slice of Provolone cheese and a drizzle of olive oil after uncovering and it turned out perfect!  Tender and juicy!

This was really good.  I did follow the advice of some of the others and browned the breasts a little before baking.  I also added a little fresh mozzarella on top towards the end as well as a drizzle of balsamic.  It looked good enough to be in a fancy restaurant.

This was good, took reviewers advice and added balsamic vinegar, tomatoes and feta cheese the last 15 min. I think it would've been a bit too dry without the balsamic vinegar and feta cheese.

Delicious, Light and Healthy.  I felt like it could use a little something to keep it from drying out and give it a bit more punch, So I added a little balsamic vinegar and coated the chicken lightly with it prior to seasoning it and I also put it under the broiler for the last 5 minutes. Served with brown rice and fresh vegetables for a health dinner.

This was really good! I made it for my family and everyone really enjoyed it! Be careful though, if you're not into spicy foods, use less crushed red pepper. All in all, a great, low-cal, flavorful recipe!

This was amazing!  My finace told me that it was the best thing I have cooked to date. It was extremly moist and packed with favor.  I added a little more garlic, and made sure I removed it from the oven the minute it was done.  I have been told to make it again, and will make it for my in-laws next month!

Great, easy recipe, and easily modifiable. I like to use FRESH Basil at the base and atop the chicken. I also use plenty of garlic. Additionally, I use Balsamic vinaigrette or even the new Trader Joe's Balsamic glaze (yum).  Use ROMA tomatoes a plenty, and add the Feta last 15 minutes. You can also add Artichoke hearts on top. Great with side of rice. I don't use much parsley...

I had chicken marinating from the night before in oil, lime, s & p when I came across this recipe. I decided to butterfly the chicken and add the seasoning. It was amazing! I think it would have been great anyway but I feel the lime marinade made the flavors POP. This is on my "save" list!

Okay, so I used this mostly as a base, because I had chicken, fresh basil, and fresh parsley I needed to use up.  I roughly chopped up the basil + parsley, and tossed it in my mini food processor along with a glug of oil and the 4 cloves of thinly sliced garlic, and pulsed until everything was uniformly.  In the bottom of my 9x13, I added salted and pepper, sliced onion, and 1/3 of the herb mixture; then I laid down the frozen chicken breasts, topping those with the herb mix, more sliced onions, some salt and pepper, and grape tomatoes (some sliced in half, some just thrown in there).  Baked for 30 minutes covered, and 20 minutes uncovered. De.licious.

Very good! 

I had to substitute tomatoes sauce for the tomatoes which is the only reason why I didnt give it a 5 star rating. When I try it again, (which I will because the basil parsely garlic combo is fantastic) I will rate it again and hopefully it'll give me the full affect I crave.

Five stars for a quick and easy hands off dinner.  I'm no cook and didn't mess this up with variation.  Spread minced garlic on the breasts and had pico de gallo and feta cheese that needed to be used up quick.  Topped with pico and during last 15 mins added feta.  The spices were tasty and can tell next time that when I make as directed, it can better appreciate their flavor.

I used fresh basil and italian parsley because I had them on hand.  I also squeezed half a lemon over the chicken before seasoning.  The chicken came out nice, but needed fifteen extra minutes cooking time probably due to the extra bulk of the herbs.  I used lots.

Delicious! I cook for a very picky family and everyone enjoyed this dish. Warning, when I removed the cover I drained some of the cooking fluid because it just seemed to be too much... Don't do that!! It will dry out the chicken!

I made this tonight and hubby and I loved it. I left out the red pepper flakes as I didn't want to make it hot. I also sprikled some shredded mozzirella cheese over the top in the last 3 minutes. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the red pepper flakes. W/O them it's 5 stars. I also used a can of diced tomatoes as I didn't have any fresh tomatoes.

I followed the directions to a T until the last 15 mins. I added a splash of red wine vinegar. I served it over brown rice w asparagus. My 5yr old who is VERY picky ate everything on her plate. My hubby is not a rice fan so i made egg noodles and he too cleaned his plate. This is now part of our meal rotation.

This turned out moist & juicy.  I added a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar before adding the spices on top.  Also, didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I piled canned, diced tomatoes on top - loved it!

I used fillets rather than breast halves (not sure how many...used enough of them to completey cover the 9x13-inch pan), so I'm sure that's the problem, but the chicken tasted a little too much like dried herbs.  I think I will continue to use fillets, but decrease the parsley and basil to 2 tsp each.  The crushed red pepper was perfect (not spicy at all!) and was a wonderful addition...something I would have never thought of!  Per other reviewers suggestions, I added the juice from half of a lemon and 8 oz. feta cheese during the last few minutes of cooking.  Not only was the meal really pretty, but it was ridiculously easy to make, and I loved the fact that it was so juicy without using any oil or butter!!  I will definitely make this again!  :)

In fairness, I need to mention that I'm rating this recipe without red pepper flakes, which I love.  I left the hot stuff out because my mother-in-law doesn't care for spicy hot.  I look forward to trying the recipe again with the red pepper flakes.  The other modification I used was using a can of diced tomatoes rather than fresh.  For a combination of delicious and healthy, this one is hard to beat.  I love it.  I served it with Stir Fried Asparagus, which is one of the best vegetable dishes I've ever had (and available at the allrecipes website).  What a great meal this was!

I just made this and it's delicious.  I didn't put any tomatoes on it this time but I will next time.  I added a little black pepper (I like spicy food), marinated the chicken and seasoned it with a little Adobo, and topped it shredded mozzarella cheese.  Make some angel hair (or any other) pasta with alfredo sauce and you're good to go.  Nice and healthy with veggies on the side too.

I made a few changes to this recipe. Firstly I marinated the chicken for 4-5 hours (parseley, basil, crushed peppers, garlic, salt, olive oil). I put down a bed of onion rings on which i placed the marinated chicken. I also topped with diced tomatoes as suggested by someone else on this forum. Turned out great. Next time, I will use fresh basil on the chicken.

It had a nice flavor, and was very moist. It was good, but not really great. It needed MORE flavor.

Delicious, easy, and with so few ingredients.  I was worried the cooking process would dry out the chicken some, but the tomatoes were more than enough to keep it delicious.  And its very fresh and good for you as well.  Will definitely make again.

We liked this recipe quite a bit. It was a bit dry but very tasty anyhow. I pounded the chicken flat since my family doesn't like them thick so I think maybe that's why mine turned out dry. Next time I will cut down the time & see how it goes. Will definitely be making this again! :))

This had GREAT flavor! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is b/c it ended up being really tough.. ? Anywho, I only cooked 3 smallish chicken breasts so I used 1/2 tbsp of each spice and took the lazy route and used minced garlic from Spice World instead of slicing fresh. I let the chicken breasts marinate in Zesty ITalian dressing for about 2 hours, then browned the outside just a little in a skillet before adding it to the baking dish. I then added the spices and a little more dressing and the tomato. It baked for 15 at 350 covered, then added some low fat mozz cheese and baked uncovered for about 10. I'm really not sure why it ended up tough, but we ate it and enjoyed it anyways! Made pasta mix as a side and used the juices from the pan as a sauce, along with garlic powder and parm cheese.

I thought this recipe was awesome - and S-I-M-P-L-E.  The only thing I changed was to drizzle the chicken with balsamic vinaigrette like someone else suggested and to use fresh basil because I adore it.

I paired it with roasted red potatoes and a salad - DELISH.

Absolutely fantastic. I served it on a bed of baby spinach leaves, making a delicious, refreshing, and guilt-free meal. Also squeezed a tiny bit of fresh lemon juice on top after baking. I will be making this VERY often! The only thing I will do from now on will be to use garlic powder, because while I *love* fresh garlic, I don't love biting into big slices of it. Thank you!

This was amazing. I just cooked it a few days ago and my husband is already asking for it again! I substituted olive oil for cooking spray, and also brushed the chicken with it before adding herbs. I used roma tomatoes and added shredded mozzarella the last 15 min as suggested. I didn't have red pepper flakes so added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper instead. I minced the garlic instead of sliced, and served it over basmati rice with shredded Parmesan mixed in. DELICIOUS. The next day my son and I finished the leftovers; I chopped up the chicken in small pieces and served it stir-fry style with the rice- just as tasty. This will be a regular at my house from now on!

Excellent recipie, especially considering how easy it is to make.  I followed some of the other suggestions and added Basil/Tomato Feta Cheese and Basalmic Vinegar to it and it was wonderful.  I used minced garlic instead of the garlic slices also.  My family thought the pepper was a bit much, so next time I will cook it without the crushed pepper, but it was excellent.

I liked this recipe - healthy, delicious yet simple. I used large chicken thighs as opposed to breasts because they are more succulent. I also slipped a little cheese under the skin to give it some extra bite. Very nice!

Well, it's in the oven. This is definitely a springboard recipe. I only had split chicken breast w/skin and bone. So because of longer cooking time, I used plain canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I did drained them tho'(using the reserved juice in cooking my spanish rice).  I coated the breasts in olive oil and then spread minced garlic (from a jar) over it. Then coated with sea salt, parsley, and a little oregano (ran out of basil plus I thought it would work better with the rice). Also, I added a personal fav of celery seed (not salt!). I sprinkled parsley and oregano on the bottom of the pan and placed the herb coated chicked into it. 

I put the drained canned tomatoes into a small bowl. I added fresh cracked pepper, a little more minced garlic, then drizzled a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar over it and mixed well. I mounded the tomatoe mix onto the breasts. Covered and put in the oven. 

It's been 30 min and I just checked and the juices are clear. I topped with sharp cheddar cheese (all I had) and uncovered. I will check in another 8-10 min.

It's done. I let it rest while I finished up the rice. 

The chicken and tomatoes are flavorful and juicy. Will definitely try again probably using a monterrey or mozz for the cheese. 

Thanks!

As far as ease, I would rate this a 5.  Also, I'd say it is quite healthy since it doensn't use oil, butter, etc.  I ultimately gave it a 4 for taste.  This was very good, but not quite a "5."  Definetly worth the time though, for an easy, yummy meal.

Moist, tasty, delicious...easy!!  I took the advise of others and added some fresh lemon juice right around the time I uncovered it for the last 10-15 minutes of baking.  Keeping this dish covered during baking is what really kept the chicken juicy and flavorful.  Another change I made, was to use grape tomatoes (you could use cherry as well) instead of sliced tomatoes.  I put some in at the beginning, and popped a few more in  when I added the lemon juice! A real winner!

Thought I'd give this a try as it sounded so good and all the reviews were good too. All we could taste was garlic!! It was so strong we couldn't eat it and we both love garlic.IF I make it again it will be with maybe 1 or 2 cloves and not 4.

Great healthy option. Chicken came out very juicy. Used fresh basil from the garden instead of dried but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Used Roma tomatoes and they kept together. Made a nice presentation.

It was alright; mind you I altered the recipe a bit to suit my Sunday night ill-prepared student kitchen. I mixed the garlic, basil, parsley, and salt together in a bowl with some olive oil, cayenne pepper, and a squirt of lemon juice and rubbed the chicken with it. Baked as instructed (minus the tomatoes) and topped with mozzarella for the last 15 minutes. I feel like it definitely lacked something... the tomatoes may have made the difference. Either way, it smelled absolutely incredible in the oven, but the taste just wasn't 100%. A little disappointing, given the mouth-watering aroma. I like the feta and balsamic vinegar idea. Next time!

Oh, this was so easy and so delicious!  I was worried it would be too plain, but the chicken made it's own broth as it cooked, and it was very juicy.  I did end up cooking it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe said, but I used 6 chicken breast halves instead of 4.  I omitted the red pepper flakes, used fresh parsley and basil (about a tablespoon each), and added about a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar over the chicken.  The, I chopped the tomatoes and added another tablespoon each of the vinegar and olive oil over that .  Finally, for the last 15 minutes of cooking, I added about a cup of reduced-fat feta.  This was SOOOOO good!

OMG!!! This was soooo amazing!! It was so juicy!!! I didn't have garlic cloves just minced garlic and I didn't have tomatoes but found I had a can of Tomatoes (Garlic & Basil) in the Pantry! The can of tomatoes was the perfect touch. Next time I may try to add a little bit of cheese. This will definitely be a keeper. My Husband loved it!

I made this exactly as stated. Not a huge fan of red pepper flakes (come to find out) and they did really stand out in this.  I will make it again but I will omit the red pepper flakes.

i will admit, i had barely any of the spices...i had herbs de provence.  also didn't have any tomatoes, so I added diced can tomatoes after i uncovered the chicken to cook.  i also used minced garlic - a lot of it.  the chicken was moist, it was just surprisingly bland.  it needed more salt.  next time i would consider using garlic salt and/or more crushed red pepper and I will try it with the herbs recommended

Fantastic flavor and so simple to put together!!  My husband and I agreed this will go in the book of favorites.  To dress it up I did sprinkle some feta and extra herbs over the tomatoes about 5 min. before it was done baking.

This was good, quick, and easy.  I followed the recipe to a T, except for the following. . . added in about a tablespoon of olive oil to the bottom of the pain, and didn't use tomatoes because I didn't have any.  I will definitely make this again.  Also note, can be a tad on the spicy side with the red pepper, so you may want to lessen or eliminate all together.  Overall, very good.  Thanks.

This was outstanding.  Easy is Right !  I did change the ingredients a bit to suit my own taste and saved it with the same title.  My version uses Olive Oil, Italian Seasoning, lots of fresh basil and lots of tomatoes ... but this recipe is still the source.

I am impressed with this simple recipe chicken tastes so juicy and good! I didn't have tomatoes, Im sure it would taste even better. I sprinkled parmesan generously at the end of baking... (didn't measure ingredients)

Super easy and low maintenance. I didn't have tomato, but I used roasted red pepper from a jar and it was just as delicious! I love the touch of spice and the basil is perfect. The baking time left the chicken cooked perfectly. I highly recommend and will make the next time I need a quick easy meal.

This is so easy to make! I basically just rubbed pesto on the chicken, let it season for about 20 minutes, and sprinkled parsley, basil and crushed garlic on the chicken before baking it. I put some cheese on top and broil for another 5 min a little before the chicken was done. The tomatoes came out perfect! And the juice was excellent! My fiancee loved it =)

Ive made this 10 plus times and it rocks every time! I use minced garlic-use full basil leaves under tomatoes, little balsamic to add a little kick. Throw some mozzarella on top last few minutes and you have scored with a great meal!

I thought this chicken had some really great flavor.  I did make some changes/additions just because I had the stuff on hand.  I think it would have been fine without them too.  My additions were: I put a little chicken broth in the bottom of the dish, I added a jalepeno, minced, a little bit of a leftover onion, chopped and I used fresh basil and fresh parsley out of my garden. All of the flavors blended nicely and was very arromatic when it was in the oven.  This was also a very healthy meal while still having a deep flavor.  I will definitely be adding this recipe to the collection.

I loved this recipe!  I found it when my husband and I were on the first Phase of the South Beach Diet, and was excited to find a delicious-sounding recipe that fit the requirements.  I made a couple of changes as per suggestions by others.  I didn't add the red pepper flakes - mostly because I didn't have any on hand.  Also, I used dry garlic flakes and found they worked just fine.  Right before cooking, I poured some balsamic vinaigrette on top of the chicken/tomatoes, which I was delicious, and also I added feta cheese to the tops during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Wonderful recipe!  Have already made it twice and will be considering it a staple!

Like most chicken breast recipes, I found this a bit dry.  I used fresh garlic, parsley & parsley from my garden.The flavors were good.  I speeded the cooking process a bit by purchasing cutlets (rather than big, fat breasts)and reduced the amount of time in the oven.I agree it is simple.

This was very good.  However, I cut back on the basil and added more tomatoes slices. I think the tomatoes kept the chcken moist.  My husband and I are on Weight Watchers, so this recipe was very lean.

This was very good.  Followed the recipe except I used canned diced tomatoes, and minced garlic.  Take some help from the store, minced garlic a big time saver.  I mixed part of the spices and garlic with the tomatoes before putting on top of chicken. Very moist chicken.  A Big hit with the husband!

Very easy to put together, and got the "thumbs up" at dinner. My cloves of garlic were fairly large, so I cut back to only 3. I used a total of about 4 tbsp chopped fresh parsley instead of dried, and drizzled a little olive oil over the chicken and tomato slices before putting it in the oven. Basil pesto would go well with this, either as a side or on top.

I made this this past Sunday. I'm a proscrastinator, so was running low on time when I got started and decided to make it as per the original recipe, though would use fresh herbs the next time.  I did brown the chicken first and altered the baking time. It was very flavorful. McCormick has grinder style herbs now which I love so I used the Italian Seasoning grinder instead of all the separate herbs.  Since there was just three of us for dinner, I had plenty for Chicken Ceaser Salad yesterday. I warmed  the leftover chicken on my grill pan sprayed with evoo( rather than truning it into rubber in the microwave) before adding it to the salad. My family enjoyed it.

We are eating a lot of chicken lately and I was getting tired of all mmy usual fave recipes.  This was easy and delicious.  I still have fresh herbs from the garden and I don't use salt, but otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written.  This is a keeper.

I've made this recipe a few times now and have made these alterations to the original. I liked the advice of the reviewers who suggested drizzling with balsamic vinegar, but only had the BV salad dressing on hand so substituted that. I use a can of petite diced tomatoes, I only use fresh tomatoes in the summer. I use fresh garlic if I have it, garlic powder if not.  The  last time I made it, I had to use my crock pot as I was out all day. My husband asked me what I did different because it was even better than before.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe

I liked this recipe, but it was a little spicy for me.  I sprinkled balsamic vinegar on top of it all, like someone else suggested, but probably won't do that again.  I will probably cut down on the red pepper next time also.

Was easy, looked and tasted great! I almost felt it needed some sort of sauce paired with it, possibly a cream sauce, but in solution to that I think this would be excellent on top of pasta with alfredo sauce! Delicious recipe!

This was great!! I am doing a diet that doesn't allow for much fat at all and the great thing about this recipe is, I did not have to alter it at all to fit my meal plan. It had great flavor too!!! Next time I will try garlic salt instead of sliced garlic (just for a change/quickness) and add some mushrooms and zucchini to the dish. But, it is great just as is!!

This recipe was really good but if I followed it to the letter I wouldn't be a good cook.  My family ate it all.  I used boneless chicken tenderloins that was all I had.  I marinated the chicken in Mr. Yoshidas marinade the morning before I made them.  I added sliced onions, garlic powder, onion powder, minced garlic.  I would definitely make this again.

This turned out great... the chicken was really moist and tasty.  The only change I made was to also drizzle a little balsamic vinegar over the chicken and I only used half the amount of garlic. I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was pretty good for a low-fat recipe, but it definately needed a little something to flavor it a little more. Parmesan cheese helped & I marinaded the chicken in a low-fat Italian dressing first. I think I'll try it again with whole chicken pieces (so it doesn't dry out) and I'll need to play with it more. All in all, will make again & it's easy and quick for weeknights. Needs a little more to get 4 or 5 stars for me.

I tried this recipe with a twist, I added a whole lime juice and substituted garlic gloves with garlic powder and chili with paprika, and I tell you it came out not to dry nor to juicy, just right and the taste was perfect.  Give this recipe a try if your short on time to prepare dinner with my little twist, and you can't go wrong.  Great recipe.

My husband and son enjoyed it more than I did, but it is a good, simple recipe.  I decided to grate some parmesan cheese on top and see that others did the same thing.

Excellent!!! I was looking for a low fat/cholesterol recipe and had no clue I'd find one as delicious as this! I prepared it exactly as written except I did add a light sprinkle of part-skim mozzerella cheese on top and only baked 10 min  after uncovering. Everyone raved over it, including me! Thank you Kitty!

This dish was fantastic!  Really easy to make and very little mess to clean up (now that's my kind of cooking!).  I eyeballed a lot of the proportions, but it turned out fine.  I didn't have tomatoes, so I used about 3/4 can of diced tomatoes.  I didn't have enough garlic, and I think the dish would have been even better with all the garlic the recipe called for.  I also added a splash of lemon juice and sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Oh, I did cut my chicken breasts in half, and didn't reduce the cook time.  The chicken was a little dry, but still great.  My 10 month old and two year old ate it with no complaints.  Served with bowtie pasta (with Roasted Garlic Ragu sauce) and mixed veggies!  Thanks for an easy and great dish!  The hubby said it was yummy!

This was easy and good.  I soaked the chicken in vinegar for about 30 minutes (longer is better, though) before preparing in the pan.  It made them juicier.  I also did what others suggested and added about 1/2 cup of shredded mozz during the last 15 minutes.  That made the dish.

Absolutely excellent!
I started off making it exactly as written but after removing the foil I kicked it up to 375 and added some shredded mozzarella cheese and a little store bought Arrabiata sauce on top of that.  
Turned out to be one of the best chicken dishes I've ever made.

Per other readers, I drizzled balsamic vinegar over it and added some mozarella cheese the last 15 minutes.

Loved it.   I was out of red pepper flakes so I used some cayenne pepper powder.  I also sprinkled on some lemon juice before baking.  Chicken was surprisingly very moist and tender.  I'll definitely make again.

Simple recipe using ingredients that you usually have on hand. It's not a 5 star recipe, but it's a good healthy option for a weekday night when you don't have a lot of time.

This was really good! So easy to make too. I followed the recipe and added the other suggestions to brown the chicken on both sides before baking and adding balsamic vinegar, feta cheese and tomato slices at the 25 min mark. Baking for an additional 10 min. Definitely a keeper!

It was ok. I'd make it again if I had it on my mind. If feel like it needed some other seasoning to boost it just a little. I used tender loins instead.

I used fresh basil and fresh parsley- and lots of it.   I used garlic salt to save time and cayenne pepper to prevent super spicey bites for the kiddos.  Topped each breast with three thick tomato slices, more basil and parsley, and some normally expensive cheese I'd gotten on clearance- would use mozzarella, goat, or feta otherwise.  But definitely needed some cheese IMO.

Super quick and easy, the only change I made was sprinkling Parmesan cheese on it at the end of baking.

only thing differently i did was i used garlic salt, garlic powder, minced garlic in a jar, and marinated it with lemon juice. i did not use cheese like everyone else because i am on a low fat strict diet. it turned out really well.

confession time---i used tuna instead of chicken! And you know what? it wasn't half bad. Although i did think the dish lacked some another component that i simply cannot put my finger on. the truth of the matter is that the recipe is too simple. will possibly try it again with more ingredients and maybe with chicken breast as the recipe says.

pretty good, mine turned out kind of dry.  Hubby likes it like that anyway.  The good thing about this is that I cook a whole package of chicken at once and then save the leftovers for other dishes later in the week.

Recipe doesn't need any modifications at all for a flavorful, moist and healthy dish. You might want to add more tomatoes so there is enough for each serving.

I loved how easy this was but my 12 year old complained it was a bit tough.  I think it would have been better if I had seared the chicken first to seal in the juices.  Otherwise... a huge hit.

This was just OK. It seemed like it would turn out so much tastier than it did. Maybe using fresh herbs would be a better way to go, since you're already using fresh tomatoes. The dried basil, especially, tasted harsh for some reason.  I don't know, but I will not be making this again.

Very flavorful! It's easy to prepare and goes into the oven so you have time and space to prepare your side dish.  Has plenty of flavor so I didn't need the added calories of the cheese some other reviewers suggested (although it would probably be delicious!)

My daughter just made this recipe for Sunday night dinner. We all agreed that the only thing missing was vine-ripened tomatoes! Excellent recipe; easy and flavorful. We'll seek some better tomatoes from a neighbor or farmers market.

Delicious!  I soaked the chicken in salt water brine for a few hours to tenderize it.  Also, cut the large chicken breasts into smaller pieces.  This recipe is a keeper.  Low calerie too!

I was skeptical that this would be moist without any oil or stock, but it was both tender and moist.  And delicious!  I will use less of the dried herbs next time, but otherwise this was a hit and will be on our menu regularly.  A dream recpe for the busy mom!

This was pretty good.  I browned the chicken in a pan before putting it in the baking dish.  I didn't have red pepper flakes and used cayenne instead.  I also used rinsed diced tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh on hand and used fresh herbs instead of dried.  I think it would have been better had I pounded the breasts a little thinner.  I would have liked the flavor to be throughout the chicken and not just the outside.

Easy and delicious!!!
I used fresh organic pureed herbs from the grocery store...comes in tubes, parsley puree, basil puree and garlic puree. Added some parmesan cheese on top of the tomatoes for the last 15 minutes, it was amazing! My husband and 18 mo old LOVES this.

I also browned the chicken first.

The whole family loved this, which is hard to do! I think I'll mince the garlic instead next time because biting into the slices was not fun. I was surprised how moist this was!

This is excellent!! Every bite had flavor to it and my son who would rather eat all the sides than his meats asked for more! I left out the red pepper flakes cause I didnt have any at th time but it was delish!

Amazing, I did a couple things to alter the recipe a lil bit.  I added a balsamic glaze and fresh mozzarella underneath the tomatoes.  My boys (8yrs and 7yrs) and husband LOVED it, as with all of the recipes from this God-sent website.  Thanks Kitty731!!

This is an excellent and easy dish to make. I will definitely make it again.  I used fresh herbs and also added some tarragon that I had as well.  I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on during the last few minutes. It was very juicy and flavourful.

Excellent and easy to prepare.  I did  brown the chicken first.  I did add Fire Roasted Tomatoes on one of the pieces of chicken and feta cheese also like one of the other readers did.  Very tasty.

The easiest and healthiest dish by far! My entire family luved it! Even the picky kids!!  

I added a little bit of chicken broth to the dish just to keep it most and garlic powder instead of the garlic slices.  It was perfect especially on top of some rice a roni wild rice! 2 thumbs up!

Even though I browned the chicken before baking, the chicken still seemed rather blah. Perhaps I am just not that fond of baked chicken. It was okay.

I made this and was less than impressed.  I actually used more seasoning than the recipe called for and found the chicken to be bland.  We ate it, but will not make it again.

I made this for my family right before my mom came over to babysit.  When i got home, I had mixed reviews.  Almost everyone loved it except my oldest son.  But he claims the baked tomatoes were awesome.  So good in fact that he ate all the tomatoes off all the left overs.  That left me with cold left over chicken minus the tomatoes.  I have to say that I agree with the rest of the family, though.  When i tried it, it was very yummy... cold, left over, missing tomatoes and all.

This was super easy as everyone else says. I also followed advice & used about 2 fresh thick sliced tomatoes per chicken breast.  I thought it was just "OK", but my husband and kids loved it. It was super juicy & moist. I guess its a matter of pref. I will make it again tho...

This was OK.  I made this with two suggestions from other reviewers - I added some Balsamic Vinegar on top of the chicken before placing the tomatoes on top and during the last five minutes of cooking I put thin slices of mozzarella cheese on top.  I definitely will try this again but will allow the chicken to marinate in the seasonings and the balsamic vinegar first.  I think it could have used some more garlic too (but I'm a huge garlic fan).  Overall an ok meal, nothing wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I guess I'm in the minority - they were just ok.  I found the chicken looking pale, not much flavor and without the addition of any liquid, they were a little dry.  We sliced up the leftovers the next day and made a sandwich with aoili mayo and some sliced fresh tomato.

This recipe was so easy and I love that the most of the ingredients are ones that I always have on hand.  I made it for a couple of friends and they asked me to send them the recipe afterwards.  I will definitely be making it again.  I did sprinkle a tiny bit of parmesan cheese on top but it would have been fine without it.

Ok I made this today for lunch and was afraid it would not have enough flavor because many reviewers said that it was bland but figured I would try it anyway and wow do I disagree!! I made it EXACTLY like the recipe says and it was SOOOOO flavorful!! Maybe a lot of people did not measure correctly because we know and LOVE lots of flavor and this dish delivered. Towards the last 15 min I sprinkled a little Fetta over the tomatoes, this was an excellent dish and my whole family loved it so this is for sure a keeper in our house!

Don't understand how anyone likes this. I took the advice of another reviewer and browned the chicken and added fresh mozarella last 15 min. I ended up having to add some extra salt to give this some flavor.

The basic recipe is good, but needed some adjustments. Upon the recommendation of one of the reviews, I marinated the chicken with olive oil and the spices listed. I also baked the chicken uncovered at 425 degrees, for a shorter length of time (15-20 min.) so it browned a little. I omitted the tomatoes. Next time will try it with the tomatoes and feta cheese.

I read quite a few reviews before trying this recipe.
Instead of slicing the garlic, I crushed it and rubbed the chicken then left it on the top.  I added 1/2 teaspoon white pepper in addition to the other ingredients.  I increased the parsley and basil by a tablespoon and the red pepper flakes by 1/2 teaspoon.  
The chicken was moist, full of flavor and not overpowered by the spices which I was a bit worried about.
This is definitely a keeper.

Very good and super easy, fuss free. I made this for my family of 4, myself, husband, 4 year old son and 11 month old son. Everyone including the boys gobbled it up.  I topper the boys and hubbies with mozzarella to make it kid friendly but left mine as directed. I will for sure be making this again. Thanks!

This chicken recipe is by far one of my favorites! I cooked it for my husband the other night and he raved about it! The only thing I changed was adding some swiss cheese to it. Yummy!

Just finished making this and it was a HIT! The best part is that it was a quick and easy meal. Although I had to substitute the dried parsley for McCormick onion powder with white and green oinions and parsley. Instead of garlic cloves I used Spice World minced garlic. This is great to make when you're  short on time but hungry for something good.

This recipe is super delicious! I used fresh basil and parsley instead of the dried ingredients as the recipe calls for and it turned out quite well. I paired the meal with some basil polenta with some tomatoes on top and it was a complete meal!

I made this on the stove top in a large frying pan and it was just as good as baked in the oven. A perfect summer time way to prepare it. No heat from the oven and it cooked in half the time with the lid on.

Pretty good, although my chicken was very thick and took longer than 40 min, great flavor. I added some feta cheese to the top too for the last 10 min.

I thought I had parsley but I didnt:> So what I did was marinate chicken in Italian seasoning, olive oil, garlic and some red pepper for about 4 hours. Than put in oven at 400 for 20 mins. Last 5 mins I put tomato on with some mozzarella cheese I had to use up. I enjoyed this and will use this recipe on my journey of eating healthier.

So simple, but delicious nonetheless! The spices and the tomato perfectly compliments this moist chicken. I used minced garlic and put mozzarella cheese over the chicken for the last 10 minutes. I highly recommend this for a healthy, delicious chicken recipe!

This dish was a pretty big hit at my house. I served this dish with the 2-cheese pasta bake. I did not change anything except for adding more parsle and less basil I also put about 1/4 a cup of water in the bottom of my pan with the chicken to make it more moist. This will become a regular dish at my house!!

The chicken came out very moist and flavorful. The tomatoes are a must and round out the flavors nicely. *UPDATE: After making this a couple times now, I like to rub the chicken breasts with a tiny bit of EVOO & then rub on the garlic (minced).  I find that one tomato is usually enough to cover the chicken breasts (I use half a tomato when making 2 breasts).  Sometimes I sprinkle with fresh grated parmesan cheese, sometimes I don't!  Tastes great & is very moist every time!  Thank you for this recipe!  :)

My family didn't care for the flavor. And it didn't turn out as juicy as I had hoped. I would definitely suggest browning the outside of the chicken. We didn't do this and it came out looking unappealing.

Usually I think the only good thing about a chicken breast is that it holds the wing to the other tasty parts of the bird...however, this recipe has changed my mind.  The meat was tender and fairly moist (will follow the advice of others and brush with olive oil next time...) and the flavors were wonderful.  I added shredded mozzarella on top and will try feta next time.  First class recipe!

I had 2 chicken breasts in my freezer that needed to be used.  So, found this recipe. I did make some changes, like I used fresh basil...put the big leaves on the bottom of the dish. didn't have any parsley, I followed the rest of the recipe, except I put roasted red bell peppers *(those in a jar)* on top. This was delicious. the fresh garlic on the chicken made the dish, along with the fresh basil. *oh I ate them both*

This went over real well when my son and d-i-l came to dinner.  Only change I made was putting fresh parsley, basil, garlic in food processor and spreading this paste liberally on chicken before adding the tomatoes.  We loved the idea of just preparing the tomatoes with the garlic paste on its own; I will do that soon.  My husband is a diabetic and I am pre diabetic so this vegetable dish is a "free" food for us and soo delish.

This was really easy to put together. Tender chicken and base for a versatile dish. Think next time I'll follow other reviews and try adding a slice of mozarella on top for a few minutes in the oven - would be a great addition!

WOW!  I'm on a low-carb diet and this recipe fit the bill, so I tried it.  I used evoo spray in the dish and seasoned it as per the recipe.  In the last 15 minutes, I added a slice of provolone cheese, which melted and slightly browned.  YUM!  I'll try the balsamic vinegar and feta as others suggested, adding some lemon juice and subbing oregano for the basil next time for a Greek twist.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Made this for hubby last night as I had some chicken thighs in the freezer. Used fresh herbs from the garden. Browned the thighs in a little EVOO first. Instead of red pepper flakes added some creole seasoning to the parsley/basil mix, then poured the juices from the browning pan over all. Used beautiful fresh tomatoes from my garden and baked covered accordingly. When I removed the cover added some provolone cheese for the last 15 minutes. Chicken was moist and hubby loved it. Will add to my favorites and will play around with cheese in the future. Really nice, easy weeknight recipe. Thanks Kitty.

Very tasty. I added olive oil on the bottom of the dish and drizzled some on the chicken and tomato's before baking. I'll be making this again, thanks Kitty!

Very simple recipe. Called for a bit too much basil but was delicious when balsamic vinegar is added and its allowed to marinate for about an hour.

This works for a quick and easy recipe for ingrediants you most likely have on hand, but we found it rather bland.

Amazing! We loved this recipe - I made some changes. I used only freshly chopped herbs  and minced the garlic. I added a little olive oil and some fresh lemon juice. I combined all the ingredients, and let the chicken cutlets marinate in it for a few hours. I left out the tomatoes - as we don't like baked tomatoes ans instead, placed a thinly sliced piece of lemon on each piece of chicken. This was wonderful and I will try it on the grill in the summer as well!

Outstanding!  I browned the chicken breasts first, added 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegarette dressing, and used fresh basil.  My family loved it.  Definitely, a keeper.

It was VERY good, i did take the advice of others to add the extra calories on the top with cheese and decided to add more of a pilaf of vegtables since my family enjoys an abundance of veggies! I also think that next time i will marinate the chicken in olive oil and the listed herbs to give the chicken more flavor as the flavor was very light, but my family prefers a stronger taste.


will make this again!

This was AWESOME!  We're at a high altitude and have troubles with chicken drying out - especially chicken breast - so this will be a regular in our house because it stayed moist!  I did drizzle some balsamic vinegar over the top and added some shredded parmesan cheese just before it came out of the oven, and would consider marinating the chicken for a few hours before cooking next time.  Thank you!!

I used fresh basil, and took others' suggestion to "marinate" chicken in spices and balsamic vinegar, as well as throwing some mozzarella on top. Excellent dish!

I'm sorry, but I did not care for this recipe! The chicken was tough and dry and just awful..I did marinate it in Italian dressing for awhile and put a little balsamic vinegar on it also like other reviewers suggested and it was not overcooked(if that's what any body's thinking) I don't know what happened but I won't be making this again...It looked beautiful though!

This recipe is easy and very tasty!  I used frozen chicken breast and so had to cook maybe 10 minutes longer. They were still juicy! Will definitely make this again.

Wow, O'man this is great! Everyone in the family LOVED LOVED this. I have made it twice, once as written and then added low moisture mozzarella cheese with few drops of basil olive oil (from Target- Archer Farms) and it was 10X's better with only adding a few more calories to this yummie chicken. The second time I made this I added more tomatoes..We will be eating this at least once a month!

I thought this recipe was great! My husband didn't care for it though, which is why I gave it a four stars. The only thing I did differently was I used crushed garlic instead of slice it and I put everything in a zip-loc baggie with some EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the non-Rachel Ray viewers.) and marinated it for about 30 - 60 minutes and then cook it on the George Foreman grill. Delish!

I really liked this recipe.  I used skinned thighs and fresh basil.  No red pepper flakes.  I was afraid it would be dry so I drizzled olive oil over.  Cooked it longer and when removed from oven, sprinkled parm cheese over and let it melt with lid on.  The recipe was very moist.  Next time I will do the chicken breasts.......Thanks for a great new way to do chicken!!!

This was right on time as yesterday's Daily Dish, as I needed something quick and easy to do with boneless chicken breasts last night.  As advertised, quick & easy, and tasty and healthy too.  Hubby & daughter loved it. The only changes I made were to brown the chicken a little first (in my big cast iron pan, which I then used to bake it in), and I only used another 1 tsp each of basil and oregano on top of the chicken.  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and topped with some mozzarella for the last 5 minutes in the oven.  Chicken was on the verge of being a little dry, but was even better drizzled with some of the tasty pan juices.  Might add some grated parmesan next time.  Thanks for a nice weeknight recipe.

This is a good recipe, but nothing stellar in itself. I highly recommend using fresh ingredients, although the appeal of this recipe is that I already had all the ingredients on hand. I found the chicken to be dry with this recipe, so take precautions in that department.

Definitely a change from most chicken recipes I use...  Not overly special alone though.  If I had thought through the meal more completely and served it with a complementary side dish, it could have been a ten-star meal!

This was sooooo good! I used fresh herbs and a little olive oil and marinated the chicken in the mixture for a few hours. Like others, I topped the chicken with cheese for the last 10 minutes of cooking. I used a romano/parmesan mixture. This was very good and healthy. I will definitely make it again and again!

I thought this was good. I did'nt have a tomatoe, so I put a can of whole peeled tomatoes in it, and cut them in half. We are not into spicy food, so I also did not put red pepper in it. I also chopped up some sweet onions and threw them in. It's a quick and easy recipe. Thank you!

Nothing spectacular, just a nice and easy chicken dish.  Of course, it would be better with fresh herbs, but this works well for a quick and easy main dish.  I brined the chicken breasts for about an hour beforehand, and it really helped to keep the chicken from drying out.

This was VERY quick & easy to prepare, which is important in our house! Chicken stayed nice & juicy. I did add some lemon juice and also sprinkled on some feta cheese and sundried tomatoes. Very yummy flavor. Thank you!

This dish has a great taste. I had to modify the recipe since I am in the process of moving. Many of my dishes are packed up. I used fresh basil, dried parsley and minced garlic. I cooked it on top of the stove at a medium low temp until done. I will definitely make it again. Very easy.

I substituted chicken thighs,  prediced garlic and canned dice tomatoes out of necessity. It worked like a charm. Fast, easy, and very tasty. Next time I'll  take it out of the oven about 5 minutes sooner. I LOVED this recipe!

Really good but tweaked it a bit, doubled up on the spices and used chicken thighs as that was what I had. The flavors were a great blend, I also added a little onion and garlic powder to give it a little extra.

Embarrassing to say, coming from an inexperienced cook, this was my first time making oven baked chicken.  And I must say I think I found the right recipe.  Easy, delicious, and a garlicky flavor that I love, I did nothing different except cut down the ingredients for one person and bake it in a 2 quart baking dish.

This came out dry. I followed directions to the tomato.... although I used grape tomatoes that I cut and just threw on top as well adding a dash of pecorino Romano cheese to the top after it was finished baking. I will not make this again.

I had only 2 chicken breasts and didn't want to go to the store since it was raining super hard.  So I cut them in half length-wise.  Use petite diced tomatoes.  Drizzled a little bit of balsamic vinegar on top before baking. Added some mozzarella and put in oven for 1 minute. This was very good and I had leftovers for lunch the next day.

This recipe is very refreshing! I wanted something to shake up my taste buds from our normal baked chicken routine. I did execute the recipe my way... I used fresh Italian parsley (flat leaf) instead of dried and I used chicken legs and thighs instead of chicken breast (not a fan). I never really measure unless I'm baking (a south thing) so i can't give measurements.  But it was a great dish! I will make this dish again!  Oh, the one thing I will definitely do different next time is let the dish marinate over night to enhance the flavors!

the recipe is good, but as one reviewer pointed out the chicken looks too pale on the plate, and all the flavorful juices drip rather than stay in the chicken. I'd add that in fact it is necessary to brown the chicken before to try and "seal" it. If you put it in the oven like this all the juices will come out and as a result, it just tastes like a chicken breast you boiled with seasonings. If you brown the chicken beforehand it will retain more moisture and the result will be a tastier and juicier meat. Also, I'd baked it without covering and add tomatoes at the end.

I minced 6 cloves of garlic, used frozen chicken tenderloins (which needed more cooking time) and topped it with mozzarella cheese. We LOVED it! Wow!

Day 1, not my favorite at all.  The flavors didn't really blend.  The next day, this tasted great in my lunch.  It just needs a little time.

This was really very good, I worried it would be bland but for a healthy recipe the flavor was wonderful. I did drizzle a little balsamic on top the tomatoes with the sprinkle of parmesan. Was very tasty!

Made this last night for dinner. Followed the recipe as written but substituted canned diced tomatoes for the fresh ones.  It was just okay, nothing special.  However, it is a great low fat, dietetic meal.

Tried this recipe last night.. awesome.. the flavors were superb.  Served it with Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce.  worth the try even if asparagus isn't your favorite.  We'll definitely have chicken this way again.

This was a fabulous recipe - easy, quick, and I couldn't believe how juicy the chicken was! I honestly expected it to be dry since there wasn't any water, but I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out marvelous! The name is a little long, so we coined it "funky chicken" but it was fabulous.

Very easy and fresh. I found there to be a tad too much basil for my taste when I first made the recipe so I was a little skimpy the next time. I also used crushed vs slices of garlic and it was fine. Will be making this again.

My fmily loves ths recpe,nd I love it becase it is so simple.  I add feta the last 15 minutes, it makes a big difference.  One thng, when I printed out the recipe, there was no option to exclude the ad.  It used a lot of ink and made me sort of mad that I had to waste ink printing an ad I had no need for.

I would give it a 3.5 if I could.  Pretty basic, eh, recipe but ok if you like simple flavors. Did try feta on one of them but not impressive.  Trying to think of how I may kick it up the next time. hmmm...

The tomato on top was pretty flavorless after being in the oven. The red pepper flakes gave it heat but this could use more salt and more flavor.

Truly a simple but delicious way to cook chicken. I changed it just a little - instead of tomatoes I used homemade marinara sauce with just a sprinkle of fresh mozzerella.  But next time will totally follow the recipe.  All in all one of our favorites

Came out nice and moist perfectly. I had to to skip the sliced tomatoes as I was out of tomatoes, and substituted crushed red pepper for ground.

Also, for me, the chicken was done as soon as I uncovered it (poke test and meat thermometer). However, my oven may be running hot. Your milage may vary.

This was glorious! I made it for my boyfriend, and he couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was. I've made it again already because it was so good. I was skeptical that it would taste like every other chicken I had made with herbs (it's so simple-not many ingredients), but not the case at all. I guess what they say is true, less is more :)

I drizzled the chicken with red balsamic vinegar before baking. After baking, I drained the juices, simmered them to reduce the amount by ~1/2 and to concentrate the flavors and used this as a topping. YUMMY!

I was half way through the recipe and found myself without dried basil, but was able to scrounge some fresh from the remnants of the garden. Tastes fabulous!!

Very good, easy to make, easy clean up.  I would modify somewhat and will in the future, however right now this is a PERFECT Phase 2 recipe for anyone on the HCG / Dr Simeon's Diet!

SO SIMPLE yet tasty and easy! It was fast, too... I only baked my chicken for 20 minutes covered and added mozzarella cheese the last 15 minutes it baked uncovered. I used fresh parsley because I had it, and actually omitted the tomatoes all together to suit our preferences. The red pepper gave it the perfect amount of kick!

This was very good, although beware - the red pepper flakes are HOT!  I found it too spicy for me, but my partner loved it.  I'd tone down the spice on my breast next time (easily done with this recipe) but I'll definitely try it again - easy and healthy.

Smelled and tasted yummy but I agree with other reviews - would be good to brown the chicken first to it isn't so pale.  Also liked adding the balsamic vinegar at the beginning and a little mozzarella at the end.

This was definitely a good recipe to make in a quick amount of time!!  Only thing I would try next time is to substitute some ingredients with fresh herbs, and extra virgin olive oil, in order to make it taste more fresh.  Other than that, it was great!

I really liked the flavor of this chicken. I also added some mozzarella cheese on top during the last 15 minutes, and it was a great addition. I thought the garlic slices were a little strong, so I think I'll mince the garlic next time. I also added a little balsamic vinegar and lemon juice per other reviews. Overall, a very nice way to dress up chicken.

Yummy.  Didn't add as much of the seasonings the second time.  A bit overwhelming for some of us.  We cut it up & made it into chicken ceasar wrap-ups with lettuce, cheese & dressing.  THAT was good.

Even with the garlic and herbs this dish just did not have much flavor.  The chicken was more moist than many dishes with boneless skinless chicken breasts.

Pretty easy and that is definitely a plus, but I found the chicken too dry at the end.  I did marinate it beforehand in Italian dressing with some basil added and cooked it as per instructions except when I checked it about 6 minutes after removing the cover, I found it a little overdone.

This recipe turned out quite tasty, and was very easy to make. I omitted the pepper flakes and baked the chicken on a foil-lined cookie sheet (used additional foil to create a cover), but otherwise I followed the recipe and was pleased with the outcome. The sliced tomatoes added a pleasant tangy twist to the herb-and-garlic-coated chicken. I will definitely be making this again!

Amazingly good, for something so simple and easy to throw together.  The garlic slices roast along with the chicken, and become very buttery and delicious.

Good.  Never used dried parsley before - didn't care for it.  I will make it again with fresh.  The other dried herbs were fine.  Tomato, nice touch.

i loved that it was so easy! i used chicken thighs instead of breasts though, and i used garlic powder in addition to jarred minced garlic (i love garlic). it smelled great coming out of the oven - this would make a great entertainment dish for someone like me (young and not very experienced in the kitchen).  i'll definitely make this again, but i'll add more salt next time because there wasn't enough flavour as it is.

Followed the recipe to a T. I didn't really like how it turned out. It was by no means bad but definitely not good. Will not be making this again.

I liked this recipe. It was simple and quick to put together. The only negative thing I have to say is that the cook time is to long so keep and eye on it. I will be making this dish again.

I used boneless skinless chicken tenders instead of breast halves because it is what I had.  I just reduced the cooking time to 15 min. covered and then 10 min uncovered.  I think I used too much garlic since I reduced the amount of chicken.  It was extremely moist and I added feta cheese on top for the last 10 min.

This was probably the easiest dinner I ever put together - and it was delicious! I added a little bit extra on the spices and added a tsp of savory, and used garlic powder since I didn't have any fresh garlic. But it was great blend of spices. I sprinkled with mozzarella cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking - chicken was moist and delicious. Also, since I don't care for tomatoes, I covered some of the chicken with mushrooms instead. Worked great. Thanks for sharing!!

The chicken came out juicy and tender.  I left out the salt and pepper and only added 1 tsp of basil and parsley to the top of the chicken.  Also i drizzled balsamic vinegar before baking it and added a little bit of fat free mozz cheese in the last 10 min of baking.  I agree that you should brown the chicken first.  This will definitely be something that i try again

This was the best chicken I have ever made. It was even juicy in the microwave the next day. I rubbed Garlic flavor EVOO all over it and left it in a little longer than it says and it browned a little and still wasn't dry. I will for sure make again it was a huge hit. Throw home-grown tomatoes on top and yuuummm!!

I may try this one again, but I will brown the chicken first and use less Basil. It was too much basil for me but my husband loved it. I also put the cheese on top the last 15 min.

We really liked this! I loved the simple ingredients, which are all things I almost always have on hand.

Made with the following changes: 
Used fresh basil. 
Drizzled EVOO on the top of the chicken.
Used LOTS of garlic.
Used a whole basil leaf under each tomato slice.
Sprinkled Parmesean cheese on the top 10 minutes prior to finish.

REALLY good. Really simple. The picky boyfriend really liked it. Served with Jasmine rice and green beans.

For sure will make again.

My chicken took almost an extra hour to fully cook the parts hidden under the tomatoes.  Unfortunately, this was not a family favorite.

I had this reciepe the first time at a friends house for luch. They were leftovers from the night before but the taste was so good I had to have the recipe. I made it myself at home, I added the balsamic vinegar and the mozzarella cheese as suggested by others, as did the friend who recommended to recipe. Very easy to cook, and very yummy.

I added to his recipe b/c it thought it sounded a bit plain.  1st of all I flattened the chix breast and folded feta cheese inside it.  Then I drizzled EVOO over the top followed by the spices, and then the tomatoes.  Once out of the oven I sprinkled a bit of Parmesan Cheese on top.  These turned out wonderful!  My husband and I both agree the feta cheese is a great addition!

This turned out great, very easy to put together.  I did play around with the herbs a little bit, I used an Italian herb blend rather than just parsley and basil.  I also added a little bit of chopped fresh rosemary that I had on hand, as well as black pepper.
I paired it with rice and sauteed spinach.

I made this last night and my whole family loved it!  I added a slice of mozz. cheese on top of the chicken at the very end.  The chicken was very moist and had a lot of flavor.  I took the advice of others and marinated the chicken in chicken broth (fat free and low sodium) and balsamic vinegar, the spices and crushed garlic cloves.  I also cooked it in a little bit of chicken broth and poured a little balsamic vinegar over the chicken before baking and I did not use the red pepper flakes.  Thanks for the recipe and for all the suggestions by others!  I will definately make this again!

This was just OK. The chicken WAS very dry...I served this on top of cous cous with a side of mozzerella caprese. I don't think I'll make this again.

This was super easy to make, the chicken was tender.  The spices, a little too much.  I will make this again but with less herbs or I will try different herbs.

I doubled this recipe and made it for Christmas dinner. It was really good and everyone raved. Just the right amount of flavor and the chicken was really tender. Also very, very easy to make!

This gets a 4.5 from me, 5 from my hub.  Amazingly simple recipe, yet so tasty.  I found the baking time to be right on, although I initially thought it seemed a tad on the long side.  Hub was scared of it at first (he told me later), but he really enjoyed it.  I paired this with the "Garlic-Shrimp Angel Hair" recipe from the site, and it was a big hit!

A really great low fat and cal option! I cut the red pepper flakes in half as we don't like too much spice. It still had a bit of a kick to it though. Very good. Will make again for sure!

This chicken was delicious and juicy!  Even my toddler, who usually leaves her meat on the plate, ate every bite.  (For the kids piece I omitted the crushed pepper.)  I added a teaspoon of capers to each breast before adding the tomatoes.

WE loved this! I have always LOVED cooking and making new recipies. I am in college full time now with 3 kids, so My choices are homemade yet quick for most nights. I put all the ingredants together on the chicken and placed it in the fridge while I went to class, when I got home put a slice of Mozz cheese (the only change I made) on each breast then topped with the slice of tomatoe..IT was wonderful!!

Not only was this meal tasty, we got to feel especially virtuous about how healthy our dinner was while eating it!  I made a few changes based on other reviewers' suggestions: Used olive oil instead of cooking spray, dipped the tomatoes in red wine vinegar (didn't have balsamic) and sprinkled the tomatoes with a little extra basil and parsley.  Good and good for you.

We liked this recipe very much. Its very simple but flavorful. The only thing I did different is that I had marinated chicken breast in Italian dressing for a day or so before using it. Red pepper flakes add just enough of a kick also.

Very good and tasty.  I did what others suggested and used bread crumbs on the bottom to soak up extra butter and I also dipped the chicken in flour and egg to help the bread crumbs stick better.

Great recipe! Added a blend of shredded Italian cheeses toward the end and let it melt on top before taking it out of the oven - delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This was super easy to make, but I was short on time, so I used dried garlic instead of sliced cloves.  I also used a bit of cajun seasoning.  It came out very flavorful, almost too much so.  My husband enjoys spicier foods, and he seemed to really like this recipe.  I will likely make it again, but I will use less spices.  The one recommendation my husband suggested was to use less salt.

I thought this was just okay, but considering the way my husband RAVED about it, I had to give it 4 stars.  I think I may have used chicken breasts that were a bit thinner than needed, and that's where I got turned off.  I will use thicker breasts next time.  Also, the calorie content also was wonderful in my (dieting) eyes.  Thanks.

This recipe was not a keeper in my book. Although it was simple, it lacked a great amount of flavor and tenderness. I have tasted better.
