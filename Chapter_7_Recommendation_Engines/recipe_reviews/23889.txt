Tasted great and looked like it took more effort than it did.  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes and some tomato sauce for the fresh tomatoes.  Will definitely be making this more!

Tends to come out a little dry, I added some enchilada sauce after the meat/veggie mixture cooled and it was delicious!  Also, if you run the meat and vegetables through a meat grinder before you stuff the shells, the texture is much more consistent and (I think) better.

After reading the other reviews, I agreed the mixture looked too dry...I made the following changes and it turned out so great that my husband and I ate almost all of it and had to stop ourselves from polishing it off.

Instead of tomatoes (which I don't like), I added a bottle of Chipotle-flavoured Pace salsa - it added just the right amount of moisture, flavour, and a yummy spicy-ness.  I also ditched the dried parsley (I've read if you use parsley dried you might as well not use it at all), and I substituted freshly pressed garlic for the garlic powder and fresh cilantro for dry.  Easy changes on an already easy-to-prepare dish, and it turned out delicious!

This was VERY good! I used one small can of tomato sauce and one can of mexican seasoned stewed tomatoes (chopped them up in my food processor). Had to adjust cook time on the stove to cook out liquids. But it was great. 

HOWEVER, when attempting to put the meat on the pie shell half, you MIGHT want to mention that you need to COOL the meat first. I didn't even think about it and ended up with holes in my shell when I folded it over. .. OOPS! hee hee - but this will go in my permanent recipe collection!

very versatile and my pre-diabetic husband loved this recipe. To change up this recipe I substituted whole wheat tortillas instead of pie crust. Secondly, you can use chicken, rice and black beans. Lastly, I used all kinds of peppers from my garden.

These are amazing. My husband and I absolutely loved these. They taste like ones you can get in a restaurant.  I did take the advice of others and increase the spices and I also added shredded cheese inside. but it was great. I told my sister she had to make it and her and her husband begged her to make them at least once a week. I will try with ground beef next time b/c my husband prefers it, but the turkey was tasty too.

I love empanadas, and as someone always looking for healthier versions of my favorites, I was excited to find this one.  They were great, and my family enjoyed them a lot.

I was glad that I looked at the other cooks' tips, and I also used salsa instead of tomatoes. Made the meat mixture very tasty and little extra spicy since I used medium salsa. For some reason I ended up with too much meat mixture and wasn't able to use it all in the pie crusts. However, I saved it and used it in regular tortillas for lunch the bext day. Very tasty-- I had been looking for an empanadas recipe that didn't have pork!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, and we enjoyed this. I did not add cilantro (didn't have any), and I added considerably more of all spices called for. The texture and consistency of the meat mixture was fine. I let it cool a bit before adding to the pie crusts. It's good reheated also.

Great recipe!  I followed others' advice and added a bit more cumin, some chili powder and chopped fresh cilantro.  My husband and I really loved these--and I used the leftover filling to jazz up our side dish, the Taco Salad with Ranch Dressing (also on this site).

Growing up in Panama, i ate a lot of tomato based meat empanadas.  I learned how to make them after moving to states.  Was looking for a twist on one of my favorite foods ever.  These were amazing!  Definitely let meat cool before rolling in pie crust.  So glad i came across this recipe!  Thank you!

Awesome! Very tasty and easy to make. I substituted the pie crust with indiviual round empanada crusts by Goya. Found them in the freezer section. Can also be found at your local Spanish store.

A little more involved than I care for dinner, especially since it's best if you cook the filling the night before as not to have problems with the pie crust. But the flavor was good and my husband enjoyed it.

Tasty. I used a pillsbury deep dish pie crust. The meat definitely needs salt or any kind of salt based seasoning. I did notice as I was cooking that the recipe was missing something and my tastebuds confirmed it. Will make again and probably use adobe.

These were great.  I used ground beef instead and salsa like other reviewers suggested.  I made them with puff pastry sheets cut into circles, filled and folded over.

We did not think they had a lot of flavor.  Eldest son liked but he also added a lot of melted cheese over them.  Would not make again but thanks for letting us try.

Great recipe! I substituted ground turkey with ground chicken. I read the suggestions and waited for the meat mixture to cool down before I put it in the pie crust. I also added cheese and one diced jalapeno. Delicious and easy. No mess here.

This recipe tastes great if you can get it to the table in one piece.  The filling is hot which practically melts the pie crust.  Maybe a biscuit mix would be better.  Anyway, after getting frustrated with the annihilated crust, it baked just great and was very tasty.  Makes 2 crust's worth, but hubby and I split one and saved one for the next night.  I don't think I could spread it out for 8 svgs and be satisfied.

I liked it pretty well, but nothing too grand.  The rest of the family didnt really like it. Bigger chunks of veggies might be better, maybe more like burrito fillings.

The flavor was good, but the pie crusts made it too sweet.  I also had a hard time working with the pie crusts (couldn't get them to not fall apart!).  Probably won't bother making this one again.

These were sooooo good!!!! I took many other reviewers advice and used salsa in lieu of the tomatoes, plus more seasonings. My kids went wild over this great recipe and so did I. I plan on making this again as an appetizer for a party we have coming up with sides of sour cream, salsa and guacamole! Yum!

At first, we made this recipe as stated with the exception that we left out cilantro (we don't like cilantro).  The meat turned out dry and tasteless, and we were very disappointed.  However, we made some simple changes that miraculously turned it into a 5!  All we did was add 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 to 2/3 cup chicken broth to the cooking meat mixture, and that gave it the flavor, texture, and moisture that the mixture needed for the ingredients to truly shine.  I would also suggest using deep dish pie crusts because there was a lot of meat.  However, it all turned out great, and we will definitely make this dish again!

So tasty!  I didn't have any parsley or cilantro, but the remaining ingredients were perfect.  The red pepper flakes gave a bit of a kick to it, and even my picky 1-year old ate it up.  It tasted just like the empanadas my Argentine husband makes.  I also didn't have any tapas (pastry actually used for empanadas)but it tasted great with some homemade tortilla shells.

I made this for a dinner party and it was the only item served that had no leftovers. The only improvement is if you use fresh tomatoes add some salt and extra pepper for flavor.  I also kicked it up with extra hot pepper flakes and cumin.  This is definately going to be one of my favorites.

This was soooo good and easy. I only had 2 frozen pie crusts, and used them to make a pot pie.  It was such a great combination of flavors, and it was even better the next day!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

This was great!  Reminded us of the empanadas we've had in Argentina.  I made my own pastry crust since I didn't have one frozen.  Yum!

Was very good--first time I remember having ground turkey. Was better after
adding salt and garlic powder.

Spicy and delicious!  I will definitely be making this again -- got thumbs up from husband and son. I used my own crust and added some red bell pepper with the green, but other than that I followed the recipe.  The only thing that might make it better would be fresh garden tomatoes, but I'll have to wait until next summer for that.  For now, I used canned tomatoes (with jalapenos) and it turned out great.  I used my pizza pan, and the 2 giant halves fit just right on it.  I did make the filling ahead of time and cooled it as well as chilled the pie dough, and I think that made for easy assembly.

Delicious!  I substituted in salsa for the tomatoes, as suggested, and used a homemade crust instead of a premade crust.  I was a little concerned that the pepper flakes would make the dish too spicy for my young kids and husband, but added them anyway.  It was not too spicy for them!  I think that the mixture tasted even better the next day.  I used the excess meat-mix to make some quesadillas as a previous reviewer did; they were quite good.  I will definately be making this agian.

This recipe was quick and delicious!  I squeezed half of a lime into the ground turkey mixture as it was cooking and some shredded cheese inside the pie crust before baking.  A great recipe!

What a mess!!  I had the WORST time with the pie crusts.  When I put all of the filling in and tried to fold it the fold side completely broke open.  I was even careful to not put it in hot.  When I tried to fix it I realized that the entire bottom had reduced to a pile of mush.  I ended up putting what was left of the filling in a pie dish and covering with the remaining crust.  It tasted OK but not worth me ever attempting again.

I used some of the other suggestions such as chicke broth, salt, and salsa a in place of the tomatoes. I also used cut-up turkey cutlets instead of ground turkey and 1/2tsp cumin and cilantro insted of 1 full tsp. I spkinkled some parmesan, mozzarella, and cheddar cheese on the top of mixture before ceiling. This receipe was pretty good. My co-workers enjoyed it.

I made these as directed, except omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any on hand. The empanadas were delicious! I couldn't even tell it was turkey. There was more filling than would fit in the pie crusts so I used the leftover in quesadillas (I added cheese) the next night. YUMMY!! Will definately make again.

Really good.  Make sure to add some chicken broth, and a can of stewed/diced tomatoes because it can be dry.

I have to agree it wasn't they weren't too tasty until I added a quick fixer-upper. I tried the filling before I put it into the dough, and decided it was bland. I just added some salsa out of jar and it fixed it right up. I really enjoyed them after that.

My family really enjoyed this.  Made my own crust and did add chicken broth to the turkey mixture.  Also used a container of the ready pac pico de gallo.  No leftover so will make two next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was great.  I followed some of the other suggestions about adding extra spices and chiken broth...my kids loved it!!  I also made it into more of a pot pie using a top and bottom crust.  This recipe went into my box as a keeper!

This was really, really good. My daughter has a dairy allergy and it is really hard to find recipies that don't have milk or cheese and still taste good. This one is a winner! I had read other reviews that said it was a bit bland, so I added some chili powder, paprika, and cajun seasoning. I think it would have been pretty spicy even without the extras though. My only complaint is that it is pretty labor and time intensive - it is not something you can whip together in 20 minutes. Still in all I will definitely be making this again!

Well, I just don't know what to say. I looked at the reviews and I looked at the ingredients. I knew it would be blah and went against my best judgement and followed the reviews. It was awful. NO Flavor. I eat regular empanadas a lot and this recipe should be called something else. Besides it made so much, I just threw the rest of the filling out. Thumbs down.

I thought the filling was wonderful, but I think it would be better served with enchilada sauce or a cheese sauce, as the end product of this recipe was rather dry.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I didn't have tomatoes so I used bottled sauce and it worked incredibly well!  Thanks
