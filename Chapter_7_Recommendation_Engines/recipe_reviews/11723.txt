This was a really good dinner.  My husband and Father-in-Law loved the sauce!  I used two cans Italian style, diced and peeled tomatoes (undrained) in place of the Romas, and two jars of artichoke hearts because we love them.  I also added the liquid from both jars, but next time I will drain the second jar into the sink -- the sauce was just a little too "marinade-y".  I used slightly more garlic than called for, but other than that exactly as written.  Served over fresh cheese ravioli with sourdough bread on the side --- WONDERFUL!!!  And oh so simple!!

One of my favorite quick lunches with friends.  I use canned Italian tomatoes with basil and four cheese ravioli.  And the oil at the end is essential for keeping the pasta from sticking together.  I also saute the garlic in the oil for about a minute before I add the other ingredients.  I don't add the marinade from the artichokes.

This was a nice change for ravioli and it was quick and easy, but I would not make it again.

I found this recipe a few years ago and everyone in my family still loves it!  In the winter we use canned diced tomatoes (and sometimes in the summer when we don't have the time to peel fresh ones).  Sometimes the jars of artichoke hearts have really large pieces, so I always chop them up before adding them.  Quick and easy, and SO delicious!

We enjoyed this very much but I altered it just slightly.  I used one 25 oz. bag of ravioli.  I used 4 Roma tomatoes, but didn't bother to seed them, and one can of Italian-style diced tomatoes.  I also used 1 whole can of artichoke hearts, sliced up, and used all the juice.  I used 4 cloves of fresh garlic, instead of 3.  I also added some Italian seasoning and let it all cook down for about 10 - 12 mins., then mixed it with the ravioli.  My husband also used some of the sauce on top of some cheesy garlic bread.

This is my husband's second favorite meal - we make it quite often!  The first time I made it, it did seem bland so I added premade pesto (Safeway Verdi brand works best) to the tomato sauce for an extra zing ~ absolutely delicious!

MMM so good! I used only one package of ravioli (Light cheese) but the full amount of sauce. I also cut back on the salt, and added sliced black olives, as well as fresh basil (about 2 Tbsps). This was delicious! Perfect amount of sauce for 9 ounces of ravioli. I know that a bunch of other reviewers said that something was missing... try the fresh basil! And if you are using parmesan cheese from a can, dump it out. There is no replacement for fresh parmesan (I spend the extra money for Reggiano Parmesan... it's the BEST and makes such a difference in recipes). Also, the recipe calls for FRESH tomatoes. There is a time and place for canned tomatoes, and this recipe is not the time, nor the place. Quality ingredients are needed to make this dish. Took me a half an hour from start to finish. Thank you for this one, Cathy!

Three stars for being quick, easy, and filling!  I needed to get dinner ready fast and this worked well.  It wasn't knock your socks off wonderful though.  It also made a lot, even though I only used one package of pasta (I used fresh cheese tortelini).

I served this sauce over cheese and proscuitto filled ravioli along with fresh asparagus and a salad.  I appreciate the fact that it was not time consuming (considereing I started dinner a little later that usual) and it had a pretty good flavor.  I didn't have any green onions so I subbed some parsley and Italian seasonings. I did add a bit of sugar because it was really tangy. I didn't peel or seed my tomatoes....(didn't realize I was supposed to until I read the recipe again and had already chopped most of them up).  Don't know if I'll make this again or not, but I am glad I gave it a try.

I really liked how easy this recipe was, and that it only took me about 15 min to whip up.  I did feel like it was missing something though.  I might add some white wine to the tomatoes, artichokes, onions and garlic next time.

Delicious! My father, who is the pickiest eater you will ever meet, even went back for seconds. Best of all, it is incredibly simple to make. and you CAN use canned tomatoes if they're the organic steamed kind. Much better than the artificially ripened ones you find in the winter (& you can use the juice to make a delicious tomato soup!).

Very good and easy as well.  I added a bit of tomato sauce and a few extra artichoke hearts as well.  The tomato sauce gave the sauce a little body, which I thought improved it a bit.  Great recipe!

This was a good basic recipe.  I chopped everything very fine in a blender and used a tablespoon of the marinade instead of plain olive oil.  It was a bit salty for my tastes and I had cut out the salt.  I'll make it again, but will add different seasonings to give it some more flavor.

I enjoyed trying a dish with no meat.  It was fresh tasting and the family all liked it.  I used to jars of artichokes which was perfect!  It was still missing something though.  I am going to try fresh mozz next time.

I love the fresh tomatos and green onions! Yum. Added a couple of ingredients to make it more of a cream sauce but this would be delicious either way! Thanks for the recipe.

I used the advice of a lot of reviewers on here. Substitute the green onion for a chopped half of large yellow onion. Use two cans of Italian diced tomatoes and something I came up with myself...last 4 minutes of cooking, toss fresh peeled and deveined shrimp in the tomato sauce. I believe that is what was missing from the recipe. Outstanding!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband loved it, I thought it was good but not outstanding. I think I'll add some tomato paste next time to add a thickness to the sauce, but the fresh tomatoes were a hit. My toddler loved it as well. We'll be making it again for sure. Thanks!

Flavor was wonderful but I think much of that was due to the marinated artichokes. The brand I bought had a lot of flavor vs many others I've tried that were much less spicy. I used the marinade since there was very little. Only change was the size of hearts-it was a 12 oz bottle. Everyone enjoyed the change and loved it with the broccoli asparagus salad with avocado dressing

I've made this recipe twice and both times it came out great. I followed the recipe to a T the first time and it was wonderful. 

The Second time around I added a little hot pepper to spice things up, I didn't bother skinning my tomatoes, added an extra can of diced tomatoes, and it came out just as good. 

This is the kind of recipe that you always keep on hand for those nights when you don't feel like cooking too much. I paired it with a strawberry and spinach salad and my family loved it.

Super delicious and easy to make! I used 2 cans of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, added 1 small can of sliced mushrooms and used 1 can of artichokes, not marinated.  I'm making it again tomorrow!

Made this dish last night and really liked it!! I used tortellini since I didnt have ravioli on hand.  I followed the recipe but did a few things different.  For the tomatoes I used half of a large can of crushed tomatoes.  Also added a can of mushrooms to the mixture since hubby likes them so well.  Once the tomato mixture was cooked throughly it still didnt taste quite like I liked so I added just under a 1/4 C of cream cheese (in small chunks) and extra parmesan cheese.  Let that all melt and come together.  It turned out fantastic!! I will definatley keep this recipe and make the same way.  Also love the artichokes in it. Yum!

I LOVED IT!  So fresh tasting!  I used halved grape tomatoes in place of the romas because I had them on hand and I only used 1 pkg of raviolis (dinner was just for me).  I recommend chopping (I used kitchen sissors) the artichokes up so they go a little further and cooking the "sauce" (it's more of a topping) a little longer than called for to cook the garlic up a little so it isn't so over-powering.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty, simple dish to change up dinner. fast too in a pinch. If I don't have green onions, I use the same amount of regular onions. Recipe as-is is well received by family.

I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes, so I used a 14 oz can of petit diced tomatoes, strained.  It's a great meal for a weekday night when short on time.

Overall, this was good! I did make a few changes... For example, I didn't use as many roma tomatoes. But I don't think it would've mattered. The recipe was easy, and the result was delicious.

Great flavor. I substituted canned Italian style tomatoes as others suggested, which made this a quick and easy meal to prepare.

I love this gravy (as it is called here in South Philly!) I did tweek it a little.  Instead of green onion, I used shallots.  I also added a few anchovies in with the oil, garlic and onion that way there they literally melt.  I also added a few chopped black olives, 2 bay leaves and fresh oregano and basil.  YUMMY!!! No cheese was added to mine.  It tasted liked an authentic Italian gravy!

Yummmm! This is the tastiest dinner entree I have prepared in a long time! I personalized it just a bit. After tossing the ravioli in a little oil, I also gave it a few shakes of italian seasoning. I also added fresh chopped spinach to the sauce to increase the vegetable content. I omitted the green onions because, for me, it just didn't seem to work with this dish. It tasted divine and was pretty healthy too!

A great recipe!  It was so easy and inexpensive to make too.  I substituted frozen ravioli, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, and some Italian seasoning to make the prep a little easier.  I forgot to add the green onions but it turned out just fine.  Next time I will drain the tomatoes a little more (the sauce was rather watery), or boil off more of the water.  My husband suggested that we try the sauce on chicken breasts sometime.  A quick, attractive meal that will definitely be a regular in our home.

Yummy combo of flavors! I love artichokes and don't really have many ways to serve them. Only changes I made were: I used frozen raviolis, a 14oz can artichoke hearts; and because I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, 14 oz can diced italian tomatoes with ~ 1/2 c spaghetti sauce. Next time will also make sure to chop up artichoke hearts. Overall quick, simple and tasty!

This was OK.  The recipe didn't say whether or not to drain the marinated artichoke hearts.  After reading the ingredients in the jar, I decided to drain them (but didn't rinse them).  As I'd drained the artichokes, I added a little more olive oil.  I used parmesan-romano cheese to give it a little more of a kick.

This was really easy and simple, but it had a lot of flavor. I used romano cheese instead of parmesan. It's sharper with a little more flavor.

Oh yum! This was excellent!!! Even my artichoke-hating hubby ate this  right up! Other than opting to not peel my tomatoes (no need to, IMHO), I made no real changes. I usually tinker with every new recipe I try, but this is the one rare time I didn't. This is simply perfect as is! A touch of fresh chopped basil MADE this dish (try it!). Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Cathy. I'll be turning to this often for sure! :-)

This was a great dish because it was so easy. I did add some spagetti sauce (about 1 cup) to bring out the tomato sauce. I can't imagine it without the tomato sauce, it was very good.

I followed many of the suggestions in the reviews.  I used fresh roma tomatoes, but I think it was a little bland.  Hubby liked it more than I did.  I'm not a huge fan of jarred artichokes, which probably affected my enjoyment of this recipe.  If I made it again, I would use freshly grated parmesan instead of the pre-grated stuff in the container.

Mmmmm.... really yummy for a quick meal.  I didn't have Roma Tomatoes so I used Italian Diced Tomatoes (included liquid) and didn't have green onion so I used a sweet onion.  Turned out great.  Will do this one again.

EXCELLENT! I loved this dish and so did everyone else in my house. I used two cans of diced tomatoes peeled and seeded, and added the garlic/basil juice from each can also. I used the marinated Artichoke hearts from Costco chopped in half lengthwise. I added a tiny bit of chopped onion and some mushrooms since it seemed they would go well with this. I sauteed the garlic and Olive oil for a minute to let the flavors mix, then sauteed the onion and mushrooms for a minute before adding the tomato and artichoke. I let it all cook down while I cooked the raviolis. I served with warm green beans and homemade garlic and herb bread. FANTASTIC!

I added an extra clove of garlic, and some liquid that was left over from the artichoke hearts.  I also added a couple of octoberfest sausages barbecued and cut up.  It added to the flavour. Delicous meal.

This was very good! The only alteration I made was using an Italian Seasoning mix. Just using salt and pepper didn't seem to make sense for something like this. It turned out very good and we also used cheese-stuffed tortellini instead of ravioli. When we first started eating it, we felt something was missing... then I realized I forgot to put a little parmesan on top. Boy did that make a huge difference! Once we added it, it was perfect. :) Both my hubby and I have left overs for lunch today! We will definitely make again. Thanks!

Yummy Yummy!  I used tortillini and added the basil.  I also used just over a pound of tomatoes.  My husband loves basil and so loved the addition.  Other than that I followed the recipie.  I usually like more sausy pasta, but the flavor made up for it. Yummy.  I think I might try it next time with caned diced tomatoes, just for conviniance.  I like meals the faster the better

This recipe turned out better than I had imagined!  Instead of fresh ravioli, I used dried spinach/cheese tortellini.  Also added about 8 large quartered fresh mushrooms, a handful of fresh basil, capers and substituted regular minced onion for the green onion.  Oh and I didn't bother with seeding or peeling the tomatoes - I just chopped them and threw them in the saucepan.  Superb and so easy to make -- will definitely be making this again.

This was a good refreshing summer dish, however I didn't use the fresh tomatoes, but one can of diced tomatoes and next time I would use one more can of tomatoes because it needed more.  Other than that it was a great falvor, love the artichokes!

Great recipe and very fast and easy to make.  I feel the sauce should be used for  only 1 package of the ravioli though.  I made the full sauce recipe for one 9 oz. package and it was perfect.  I also add 3/4 cup chopped basil and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it a little extra flavor.

This was my first attempt at cooking in nearly 10 years. Easy and yummy! This is also very good with summer squash instead of the marrinated artichoke hearts.

this is a pretty standard summer italian dish.  no wow factor until added a good handful of freshly torn basil from the garden.. curious why the picture is of tortellini instead of ravioli..did anyone else notice that? Tortellini will hold the sauce better then ravioli especially after coating it with olive oil as suggested in the receipe --can anyone give me a reason to make the ravioli non-stick by adding the oil??

I used canned tomatoes with some roma tomatoes from the garden. Next time I'll use the canned ITALIAN tomatoes to give it more flavor.  I'll make it again.

This didn't blow me away, but it was pretty good.  My husband and I both had seconds, and I'll definitely make it again when I'm looking for something other than the usual canned pasta sauce.  I added about half the marinade from the jar of artichokes to spice it up a bit, and I also added some sliced black olives.  I didn't really like the taste at first, but it was much better after simmering for about 15 minutes.  The tomatoes were nice and broken down, and the garlic was a little more mellow.

This recipe made a very quick and delicious meal.  I used canned, diced tomatoes instead of fresh to make it even quicker and also added fresh basil for more flavor.  This one I will definitely make again!

This recipe is a keeper.  I made this for a non-vegetaian crowd and it was a huge hit.  Very light and filling.  I garnished  with feta and  followed other reviewers advice and simmered the sauce longer.  This recipe is all about fresh tomatoes.  Don't even think about using canned!

We enjoyed this quite a bit.  I used a 24 oz package of ravioli, which I boiled and drained, then cooked over an olive-oiled skillet with 1 T of onion powder until the ravioli browned up a bit.  Seperately, I cooked the tomatoes, artichokes, onions and salt/pepper.  Then I mixed the pasta into the vegetable mixture, minus the extra 1 t of olive oil.  We usually eat the ravioli by itself and it's great, but this was a very nice change of pace.

No cheese ravioli at the supermarket so I used gnocchi instead, and substituted canned diced tomato for fresh ones.  Very delicious!

I used 2 cans of diced and seasoned tomatoes instead of roma, and I used a white onion instead of scallions. These were the most delicious raviolis I have ever had in my entire life - and Boston's North End serves some really good ones! I just made it last night and I'm already craving it again.

Very good.  A quick throw-together meal that's fit for company, too. Although fresh tomatoes taste better, canned diced tomatoes work well, too.  I've also added a small can of sliced black olives--very good.

This was an awesome recipe. I added chicken and instead of Roma tomatoes, I used a can of Rotell (Italian style) to add a bit more flavor. My family LOVED it and we will make this again for sure. Thanks so much!

This is so good!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a can of tomato puree to make it a little more "saucy".  I chopped up the artichoke hearts and added all of the oil from the jar.  Delicious!

I've made this sauce twice and loved it both times.  It is very simple and quick to make.  Both times I've served it with pasta rather than the ravioli.  A nice change of pace.

This recipe was wonderful!!!  I was worried that it wouldn't have much flavor but it tasted great! And it was super easy!  To save dishes I heated the tomatoes and artichoke while the pasta drained.  We will make this again!

A perfect blend of flavors, and a really nice presentation, especially with 3-coloured tortellini. Use fresh tomatoes straight from the garden for an even more divine flavour.

This ravioli was a hit at my house. :) Very fast and easy to make and a nice, light tasting flavor. One thing that's not clear in the recipe is whether to drain the artichoke hearts. I didn't and it created a wonderful sauce for the vegetables. :) Excellent, I'll definitely make this again!

How easy was that??  (And tasty, too!)  Great for lunch or a quick dinner.  I used a can of whole, peeled tomatoes and a can of artichoke hearts.  This way I didn't have to worry about the veggies spoiling before I used them.  Everything else, except for the pasta, you should have on hand.  Thanks, Cathy!

this is a wonderful, easy dish that comes together quickly. The only change i made was to use tortellini instead of ravioli. Make this when you have beautiful, flavorful tomatoes and I'd recommend adding just a pinch of crushed red pepper if you like your food spicy; it gives the sauce a nice kick at the end without taking away from the other flavors. Thanks for sharing!

I am sure this dish is great as written, but I decided to gussy it up a bit. I added a little heavy cream and parmesan cheese to the tomato mixture while cooking (used diced tomatoes, no green onions). I also sauteed some shrimp and added them to the sauce.  Topped the whole thing off with crumbled feta. It was delish!

I served this as a side-dish with baked wild salmon. The flavors were great together and the ravioli received much praise from everyone. The sauce was put together while the pasta was cooking, so took no extra time. I did have to use a store-bought tomato instead of home-grown Romas as my backyard tomatoes are still green. I only used one large tomato with seeds and skin because that was all I had available. I plan to use this recipe for dinner next week with company and also I'm looking forward to using this recipe with fresh Roma tomatoes from my yard.

As is I give this 4 stars only because I think it's slightly bland on it's own.  However I think this recipe is a great "base" and is very versatile, in addition to being very quick & easy.  I used canned diced tomatoes with green chilies for some kick.  I also used fresh garlic, onion powder since I had no scallions and added a few squeezes of lemon juice.  My whole family really enjoyed this meal and I will definitely make it again!

I make my own ravioli from scratch which also makes this better.  3 cheese, spinach, mushroom, onion ravioli.   I use thyme and oregano in them so it gives it more flavour.  I use lots of garlic in the sauce.  With just a few minor adjustments, this is amazing.

this is good, I was also worried about this being bland so when the oil was heated I added the garlic(4 cloves instead of 3) and green onion until the garlic was a nice golden brown. this dish turned out excellent. thanks

This was great!  I almost never make recipes as written, but I didn't make too many changes to this one.  The four stars is only because of my modifications.  I cut **way** back on the oil and didn't add the extra at the end.  I added a bit of red wine, some italian seasoning, and some bacon that was in the fridge.  DH loved this and said I must make it again.  Thanks!

Super quick and easy but the results tasted liked I spent hours on this. I added a few more artichokes and used penne pasta instead of ravioli but kept everything else the same. Husband gobbled this up. Served with some hot garlic bread.

fabulous meatless entree--even my husband liked it and he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy...I also chopped the artichokes and used the oil they came in (so omitted the olive oil called for in the recipie.)  I didn't have fresh garlic, so used dried miced garlic and omitted the green onions (didn't have any).  I used 3 medium tomatoes, and about 3/4 can of diced tomatoes in sauce to give the sauce more substance.  In addition, I added about 2 T. of brown sugar to cut the acidity of the canned tomatoes down.  This will definately become a regular on our menu rotation.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  My five year old daughter loves it!  I found that the sauce is kind of dry, so I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes.  I poured out some of the juice, but next time I think I might try it with more.  I loved the artichokes!

This recipe was awesome!  Being into convenience I also used canned tomatoes, but changed it a bit.  I used 1 can of Italian recipe peeled tomatoes (I poured out some of the liquid) and 1 can of the peeled and diced tomatoes, drained and I also used bottled garlic instead of fresh.  It still came out excellent and was gobbled up quickly.  My 1 year old even loved it!  Thanks to Cathy for sharing this one with us, we'll defintely be using it again.

This sauce was delicious!  I had homemade tortellini and I didn't want a sauce that would over-power their flavor.  This sauce fit the bill perfectly.  Next time I would use a bit more cheese (my family are big cheese-lovers) and I would add the green onions at the very end of the cooking.  They got rather soggy and gray.  This is definitely one that I'll keep.

Yum!  My entire family loved this.  I love that the sauce was light and the house smelled amazing while it was cooking. We used diced tomatoes but other than that, kept the recipe the same.  Thank you!

This was simple and really tasty. I peeled (but didn't seed) my tomatoes, and drained the excess marinade from the artichokes, and there was still plenty of "sauce" for my liking, which I didn't expect.

This was just ok but I had to change it a lot based on what I had. My artichokes were not marinaded so I know I missed out on flavor there. I chopped them up very small because my boys and husband don't like them. Only my 16 year old got a piece of the artichoke which seemed funny to him.  He thought it was the skin of an onion and I said "probably".  But I can't wait to tell my husband that he ate artichokes after he has it again for lunch today.  I also used some doctored up spaghetti sauce instead of the tomatoes because my picky kids wont eat tomatoes (yet they like spaghetti sauce) Hmm. I added about 3 TBS of fresh basil because my son loves it.  I also served it with more fresh grated parmesan on the top. I LOVED how easy it was to make.

We really liked this, and it was easy!  Used several more green onions (they were small), and as other reviewers recommended, I used the marinade in the artichokes.  Also used two cans of diced tomatoes in Italian seasoning blend instead of the roma tomatoes.
Very good - thanks!

This was pretty good, not knock your socks off but enough to make again. It was very tangy so next time I'll maybe add sugar. Only changes I made was adding chopped orange bell pepper which was tasty and made it very colorful and some cayenne pepper because I like spice.

My son asked me to try this recipe because I've been hunting for quick and yummy recipes (and he had a mad craving for pasta!). This recipe truly fit the bill. I didn't veer very far from the original recipe, but I did take the advice of another reviewer and added a little oil from the artichoke marinade.  Delicious, quick, light.  I will definitely add this to my favourites.

Although this was relatively easy to prepare, there was nothing really special about it.  The "sauce" was mostly vegetables with little real sauce.  It would probably be better on plain pasta, something similar to the tomato, basil and garlic sauce I prepare in the summer.  Because good marinated artichokes are hard to find, probably won't make this again.

This was a HUGE hit with my kids!  Even my picky 8 year old asked for seconds.  I did add tomato sauce to make more sauce, used extra artichokes, and a can of stewed Italian tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes. I also threw in some homemade ravioli made with ground beef.  I did drain the artichokes and chopped them as other reviewers requested. I also didn't add too much salt since we added shredded Parmesan.  It was perfect!  It will definitely be something I cook again and again!

I prefer a sauce unless the ravioli is baked or fried.  Vegetable mixture was good though.

I used tortellini since I had some in the freezer, and it turned out nice.  I used more Roma tomatoes than called for, which was to my liking. A good flexible recipe that is quick and easy!

This works well with 2 cups of uncooked Tortellini.  I use Barilla, cook for 11 Minutes add to the heated sauce.  I do use a 12 oz jar of marinated artichokes.   I make this all the time, as I did tonight.

Wonderful. I didn't make it exactly how the recipe is written. I had ravioli stuffed with smoked mozzarella and artichoke so I used those versus using artichokes in the sauce. I did not have fresh rom a tomatoes on hand, but I had a large can of crushed rom a tomatoes with basil. I sauteed garlic in the olive oil, then added 1 chopped sweet onion. A couple of minutes later, I poured in the roma tomatoes and added fresh basil and parsley. I also added dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper and a dash of balsamic vinegar and white wine. Yum!  On the side, we had roasted asparagus with a butter and balsamic vinegar sauce. Lovely combo.

Made this for my boyfriend and his roommates. Everyone loved it and it was SOO easy. I just made some changes to the original recipe as suggested, substituting some of the roma tomatoes with italian seasoned diced tomatoes, and using some of the oil from the artichoke hearts.

This is a fantastic weeknight dinner. Very easy to prepare, filling and tasty. I used fresh tomatoes but did not peal or seed. I did use the artichoke marinade. The sauce was a little bland for my taste so I'll add a little pre-made pesto next time at the recommendation of another reviewer.

My husband made this tonight for us and we thought it was pretty good. I loved the taste of the artichokes and tomatoes together, and you can't go wrong with cheese ravioli in my opinion. The only thing I would change would be to add a little bit more of a sauce to it. I thought that some of the ravioli's were a little bit dry, but still good. Might try some white wine in it next time.

This recipe made a great complete dinner and was a nice, lighter alternative to other pasta dishes, but it really didn't wow me.  If I made it again I would add more seasoning and maybe more onion.

Absolutely delicious! Although, I did alter the recipe a bit, it is a very forgiving recipe and a great starting point for your own personal taste. I used beef/pork tortellini instead of cheese ravioli, two cans of basil, oregano, & garlic diced tomatoes, and one large can of artichoke hearts and the entire bunch of green onions. It was so simple and looked and tasted like a meal you would get in an Italian restaurant. So glad to have found this recipe!!

I gave this 4 stars it is soooo quick and easy if you already have the pre-made raviolis. Also good on other pastas in a pinch. Took me 20 minutes to make dinner. I'd never cooked with artichokes before. It was really good and my 2 year old liked it. Hidden veggies, love it!!

I absolutely loved this!  It had so much flavor!  The only thing I'd change next time is use less olive oil or else drain a little of the liquid from the artichoke marinate (i thought it was a bit salty).  I will definitely make this again!

YUM!  The only things I did differently was I chopped up basil and put on it for presentation and an extra flavor and added grilled chicken to make it a meal.

Slightly on the bland side though overall easy to make. Next time I would add some fresh basil and asparagus.

Needs more spices, and maybe something else, but it is almost a 4 star.  Will make again.

My husband and I tried this last night.  I also used canned diced tomatoes. My husband doesn't care for canned artichokes but liked this dish.  Very tasty then and as left overs.

Flavor seemed to be missing something, not sure what.  Will try once more, this time using tortellini rather than ravioli, and perhaps play with a few extra spices.

Our first thought was that something is missing from this recipe.  I can't really place what it is.  However, it was very easy and had a good taste overall.
Thanks, Cathy!

recipe didnt say to drain artichokes so just in case, i drained most of it. i probably shouldve drained it all, marinade kind of strong. also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh chopped. fresh chopped wouldve been better. otherwise pretty good. hard to find just plain cheese ravioli though. only found 4cheese.

This was sooo good! I added olives and some canadian bacon. Also, I added about 3oz of tomato paste to make the sauce a little thicker, but that's because we like thicker tomato sauces though. But with all these ingredients, it was very pretty. Thank you!

this had very nice flavor. i used 2 cans of diced seasoned tomatoes, kept the juice from one and strained the other. the marinade from the artichokes gave this a zesty taste. i will definitely make again

Very easy. My first time making this was for friends, and it was great. I also used can tomatoes and puree instead of fresh. What I liked most was how light, unsalty it was.

This turned out very yummy. The best part was that it took so little time to prepare.  The store I was at, only had the larger size jar of artichoke hearts, which turned out to be a good thing. I used almost all of the jar and next time will just use the whole jar (and I did use a previous reviewers comment to cut up the artichoke pieces some).

This was okay, but I like my pasta dishes a lot "saucier".  I used frozen ravioli, I think if I try this again I will use canned diced tomatoes and tortellini, the raviolis were kind of bland.

This was great. My kids were not that thrilled with it. But we adults loved it. I think the greatest thing is that it is so easy. I used 2 containers of artichoke hearts because I love them so much.

I altered this recipe to use canned tomatoes. All the ingredients are canned and can be pulled out in a moments notice for an elegant meal. The sauce is equally good with angel hair or bowtie pasta. Leftovers keep well and taste great the next day.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe.  The marinated artichokes give it lots of flavor, and we serve it over a pound of spaghetti.  My kids actually eat it too!  This is now a revolving recipe at our house.

Excellent! My husband loved it and so did I! The only things I did different was I used white onions and I think I forgot the cheese, but it was delicious any way.

This recipe is wonderful!! I made it for my vegetarian friends baby shower and it was a huge hit!! It's incredibly tasty, quick, and easy. I drained the artichokes to cut back on oil. YUM

Loved it!  If you like marinated artichokes, I think you'll really like this recipe.  It's great as a main dish, but I can't wait to make it as a wonderful side dish next time we have my family over for dinner.

This was great! This is a house favorite now. Jusr adjust the artichokes to taste, since their marinade seems to be where most of the flavor comes from.

This recipe was so fast and easy to make.  It was a delicious change from the typical cream sauces I use for ravioli.  The artichokes gave it a gourmet flair.
