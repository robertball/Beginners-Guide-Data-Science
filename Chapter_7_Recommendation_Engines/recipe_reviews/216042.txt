I think pre-cooking or even marinating your meat before you cook it is crucial to taking this dish from ordinary to extraordinary. I actually marinated my turkey tenderloins in a homemade fajita marinade and then just followed with the recipe. I used my own homemade salsa and I used way more cilantro than the recipe stated, both in the enchiladas and then some sprinkled on top. This turned out okay--though quite dry. I think if I were to make this again, I'd include enchilada sauce or up the salsa or something. It needed the extra flavor that I got from my marinade and it really needs some enchilada sauce--otherwise you've really got turkey soft tacos.

Yum! Great way to use up leftover turkey. I added taco seasoning to the meat mixture. Thanks! :)

These are a great way to use turkey leftovers and not taste like leftovers. I made these after Thanksgiving and got raves, no one could believe they were made with turkey.

Needs a bit more substance, I think instead of sour cream inside the enchiladas, cheesy rice or mexican rice, enchilada sauce and possibly some refried beans would have been a lot better. Ok recipe, really easy, wasn't that impressed.

This is as tasty as any other enchiladas recipe I've tried. Enchilada's aren't a food with a ton of flavor in my opinion...they're good, not great...and that's how I feel about this recipe.

I made this last night with leftover Thanksgiving turkey breast. It is was delicious! I sauteed some sliced onion & red peppers in olive oil and added this to the tortillas before I rolled them up. My four year old daughter & my husband gobbled these up. I will definitely make this one again!
