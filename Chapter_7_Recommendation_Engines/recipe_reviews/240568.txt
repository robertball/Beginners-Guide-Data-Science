I made this for dinner last night and let me tell you it is a winner!!!! My husband loved it and so did I. The only thing I did different was intsead of breadcrumbs for the topping I crushed up seasoned crutons for a crunchier topping. The next time I make this I plan to to use 4 cups of milk for the sauce because I thought it was a little dry after baking.

I really enjoy turkey tetrazzini to help me deal with Thanksgiving leftovers. And this was pretty good; I liked the egg noodles instead of the spaghetti I have typically used. There was nothing exciting about the flavor, though. 
This took much longer to assemble and prepare than I expected it to, and I dirtied so many dishes to make it. I was glad that I read through the recipe before I started, or I would have taken even longer to make the dish. All ingredients need to be chopped, measured, etc., before you begin.

Not a recipe I would repeat without doing several changes.  Since I don't agree with saying "how good it was, but I changed this and this and this",  I will just leave my review at not so likeable.

I doubled this recipe because I'm feeding a large family. I have made other tetrazzini recipes before and I liked this one best for ease of preparation  and very creamy sauce.  Overall a little bland,  I would have liked a little more herb flavor or maybe a spicy kick,  but a bit of salt and pepper at the table did the trick. The crunchy topping was pleasant. All around happy votes from the kids,  and definitely a happy turn on our Thanksgiving leftovers.  Those who are off put by the nutmeg, I use nutmeg a lot,  you'd be surprised by its versatility.

This was an amazing recipe! I omitted the mushrooms and peas. Instead of the peas I added thinly sliced carrots to the onion, celery, and butter mixture. It turned out great. My picky family ate it all and asked for it again.

My son and 14 yr old grandson loved it. My 9 yr old granddaughter thought it was just OK. My 6 yr old grandson ate the noodles only. I'm giving it 5 stars and inserting it in my favorites.

It's delicious, except I changed a few things because I didn't have all the ingredients in my kitchen...

I look at this as a "leftover" recipe, but I didn't have all the ingredients it called for. I made it exactly by the recipe except I didn't have celery, mushrooms or cream cheese. So I made it exactly as written except I omitted the mushrooms and celery, and I substituted 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan for the cream cheese. I did everything else as written.

It's absolutely delicious, and it would have only been better if I'd had the celery, mushrooms and cream cheese and followed the recipe exactly. But if you're missing a few ingredients as I was, just use this recipe as a guide and make the best dish you can. We all loved it!

Great recipe, although I did kick it up a notch and added a bay leaf, basil, and thyme to the onions and celery.  I also added about a quarter cup of white wine before putting it in the oven.  Delicious!!!

Not sure about this one. Son didn't like it, daughter thought it was ok, none of us liked the topping. I think the nutmeg throws it off for us.

First time making this recipe, so I followed it exactly. Concerns: prep time was much longer (washing/slicing mushrooms, dicing onions, chopping up turkey,) .... took me 30 minutes; and at times confusing ( just give us the ounces of cream cheese and ounces of noodles).

was great  but I did make changes so I'm not sure it is really fair to rate it as is.  I used cream of  mushroom soup because I was in a hurry. Lots of garlic power and put mozzarella  on top instead of bread crumbs. The turkey was roasted with an herb crust and the additional flavor was welcome.  4 stars is only because I altered it so much. Don't really know how the original would have tasted.

I think there must have been an error in this recipe. It calls for 3 1/2 cups of milk. While the flavor was good it was extremely soupy. I think 1/2 cup of milk may be more appropriate.

IT WAS A LITTLE DRY ESPECIALLY WHEN REHEATING. I ONLY USED SALT & PEPPER TO TASTE AND UPPED THE PEPPER TO 3 TSP.  I USED FRESHLY GROUND COARSE PEPPER. ALSO ADDED A BIT MORE SALT. BEFORE PUTTING IN BAKING PAN, TASTE, AND ADJUST YOUR SPICES. I LIKED THE EGG NOODLES OVER PASTA WHICH I'VE USED BEFORE.

I made this exactly as written, and it was pretty good, though I think it needs a little more spices. It was also a little drier than we would like a casserole to be so I might make extra sauce next time. Otherwise, definitely a thumbs up and a great way to use up some of that extra turkey from the holidays.

I added Sherry.  I can't believe you left it out!  And cream cheese with milk is no sub for whipping cream. Parm in with the Panko crumbs along with a bit of butter is fine.

This dish was delicious and a great way to use leftover turkey.  I omitted peas, mushrooms, bread crumbs, and nutmeg.  Everyone in the family enjoyed.  I have been making tetrazzini for years and this is a great taste with the cream cheese.

This was just okay. Kind of a standard noodle casserole - you could sub chicken or tuna. I thought it had a vaguely sweet taste that I didn't care for - not sure if that was from the cream cheese or maybe the Worchestershire? My husband didn't notice that, but he added hot pepper flakes.

And to whoever said they didn't make it because the recipe doesn't state the servings, it does - 6. But I agree that it's hard to find on the page AND the number of servings does not print with the recipe.

Turned out great!  I doubled the recipe and froze half for a later time. Used 24 ounces peas and 12 ounce box of bow tie pasta. Probably closer to 7 or 8 cups turkey and Italian style panko bread crumbs. Everyone had seconds and there is enough left for a few lunches.

I make a similar recipe: turkey broth in place of milk, add 1 cup grated Monterrey Jack cheese, 3 cloves of grated garlic, a can of diced black olives and 1 cup white wine.  If it is dry add more broth, to soupy, simmer longer.   This does take some time to make.

I prepared this dish for a work social (used all my left over turkey! Hooray!) I used more milk to make it a little more creamy and it turned out very good. I'm happy to report that every bit got eaten, and a few asked for the recipe! Success!

Very tasty and easy to make. I had some leftover gravy from the turkey and used that together  withthe milk to measure 3.5 cups liquid and also used a little bit more of the pasta. Used panko crumbs and also put  a tablespoon of jalapeño cream cheese together with the rest of the cream cheese. It was delicious

This was a great way to finish off Thanksgiving Turkey!  The flavor was delightful and the topping was so crunchy :).   I save the end of my potato chips to use in place of bread crumbs, I especially like the jalapeño ones. These add a little kick to whatever I’m baking.  I will definitely be making this again maybe even with chicken.

Not my favorite. Came out looking amazing, but the flavor is a little off. I think it is the cream cheese instead of something like mushroom soup or sour cream. Would not make it again

I made this DELICIOUS recipe with the modification from Lola650, that is I doubled the topping.  My daughter roasted the Thanksgiving turkey at her home and shared the three cups with me.  I made the Turkey Tetrazzini  for Sunday dinner, and everyone loved it.

Very tasty way to use cooked turkey. I added more milk,as my sauce was a bit thick. I used panko bread crumbs for extra crunch, but I think that took away from the flavor. So crunch vs flavor. I’ll try regular next time

I really liked this recipe.  It had some nice flavor.  A great way to use those Thanksgiving leftovers.

This was a great dish, but it took a little longer than expected! Lol. I forgot to get mushrooms and the celery I already had suddenly disappeared, so I had to improvise with cream of celery soup and cream of mushroom soup. I didn't have any nutmeg or cream cheese either.  It was still delicious!

Made it exactly as written, except I only had garlic and herb bread crumbs which made a tasty topping.  I cooked the entire 8 oz. bag of egg noodles and used all of them.  Excellent recipe. Would be great with chicken or even tuna. Will definitely make again.

Came out wonderful. We did not have any mushrooms and instead of bread crumbs I used unseasoned stuffing cubes. I had a half bag left over so I used them. It tasted wonderful. I will definitely make this again.

The "something" this needs  is peppers---your choice of color, but traditionally green.  "Try it, you'll like it!"

It thought it was pretty bland.  Maybe needs some cheddar cheese or maybe some Swiss.  Definitely needs something.

This is a great base recipe for leftovers. Leave out the noodles, and sub crushed pork rinds for breadcrumbs, and you've got yourself a low-carb/keto meal.

It did take a full hour, but it was worth it.  Yes, lots of dirty pans, but it was worth it.  My husband loved it (except the topping which is fine...he can give me his because I love it!)  I WILL be making this again!

Followed the recipe exactly.  It had a different taste that I think was the ginger.  Don't think I would make it again unless I modified this recipe.

The first night it was pretty good, but the leftovers were not that great (and it made a LOT).  It seemed to lack flavor, even with the addition of more worstershire sauce, and the nutmeg gave it a taste I disliked.  Another change included doing spaghetti noodles instead of egg noodles.  If I make this again, I will have to tweak it a bit and maybe make half the amount.

I  substituted   chicken instead of turkey.
I found the  recipe  lacked pizzazz.  It  needed Worcestershire sauce..

I didn't have any peas on hand but made this as stated otherwise.  So delicious! I can't wait to have leftover turkey again so I can make more!
