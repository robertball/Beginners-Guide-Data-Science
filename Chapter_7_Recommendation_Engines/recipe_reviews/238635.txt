I followed the recipe exactly but baked it in a 375 degree oven due to our winter weather.  Wonderful!  I'm sure it's even better cooked on the grill!

I made this and it's super delicious. Only difference was that I made it in the oven.

I've made this for several years.  Always on the grill and excellent.  I read it as turn the cabbage at about 40 minutes not take off the grill at 40 minutes

Great but I should have precooked the bacon a little since it was barely cooked after 40 minutes.

The first time I made this the bacon was undercooked, but the flavour of the cabbage was delicious. The next time I made it, I partially cooked the bacon ahead of time, before wrapping it around the cabbage. This simple step was a big improvement.
