Followed the recipe as is.  Came out chewy and delicious.  The brown butter flavor was great.

They're good but I don't think they stand out as special. My daughter likes to make them however ,  and she gets compliments from her classmates.

I made these with white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also left out the cornstarch because I didn't have any. (I didn't notice any problems with doing this.) My roommates gobbled them up! I'd definitely make them again :)

The dough was very sweet as well pretty gooey and on the thinner side.  I refrigerated it for about 45 minutes until viscous enough to roll and hold together. I was concerned that they were too rich, but once they baked the flavor evened out nicely. I Baked them for 9 minutes on a light cookie sheet with wax paper and one darker cookie sheet with wax paper. The lighter cookie sheet cookies were super soft on the bottom. I had to flip them over and bake for an additional 6 minutes at 2 minute intervals to insure they didn't burn. The darker cookie sheet cookies came out better, slightly golden brown on the bottom. Flavor was good but I didn't love the texture. These were a little too light and "airy". Think I'll look for another recipe.
