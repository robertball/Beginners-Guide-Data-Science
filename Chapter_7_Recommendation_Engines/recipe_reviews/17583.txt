I love this recipe!  I made it for a cake raffle at work and after the person who won it shared it, all you could hear was moans of pleasure coming from the kitchen!  One person said they always order carrot cake in restaurants and this was by far superior.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter and made it into a four layer cake (two 9" pans and then cut each cake into two) with cream cheese icing between each layer (double a regular c.c. icing recipe).  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe.  I've made it three times in the last two weeks(twice as a layer cake and once as cupcakes) and will be making it for many years to come!

Pure goodness! I reduced the oil to just over one cup and added a little pineapple juice instead. The cake is so moist! I've made several carrot cakes before and this is my favorite. I recommend the 'allspice cream cheese frosting' available on this site to top this cake.

oh yes, this is absolutely delicious.  My only change was to reduce the amount of coconut to 1/2 cup. This is now the only carrot cake I shall make.  Thanks for sharing with us!

Very good.  I made a few changes to make this cake a little healthier.  I used white whole wheat flour, only about 1 cup of turbinado sugar and 1 cup of applesauce intsead of oil and for the remainder of oil I used butter.  I left out the coconut because I don't like it.  It was delicious with cream cheese frosting.

I like carrot cakes to begin with , and when I baked this one , I could not believe it. Thanks it is a great recipe. I agree with some of the reviewers . The carrot should be 11/2 cup and the coconut should be 1/2 cup. I also increased the cinnamon to 3tsp. My friends and we love this . I told all my sisters about it.

This is an exceptional cake! Its just a shame the CARAT cake is not spelled as CARROT, as people looking for a good recipe may miss out when searching. People keep telling me they'd pay good money for this in the best restaurants!

I made this for my mothers 60th birthday. First time making carrot cake, everyone loved it. I did add a little nutmeg. I then used white chocolate cream cheese icing from another recipe.

I have made this same recipe for years with 2+cups carrots and without the coconut, and it is the BEST. Carrot cake is my husband's favorite. He has tried those at several high end restaurants and says they aren't as good as this recipe.  I always add a little more pineapple and nuts than what is called for and use a cream cheese frosting.  It also works well in a 13x9 pan at 325 for about an hour.  Next time I will add coconut and if he likes it, I will keep it including it. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Excellent, However I substituted the oil (always) with applesauce. It greatly reduces the fat, and wonderfully adds to any carrot cake recipe. For Diabetics, you can also substitute Splenda for any part of the sugar. Whole wheat flour for half of the flour, and makes this, and any Carrot cake recipe more healthier. I usually use at least 2 cups of carrots. Wonderful!!

It is the one from the Old Farmer's cookbook.  Best carrot cake recipe on the planet! I cut the oil back to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup pineapple juice in place of all the original oil.  Baked in a 13x9 pan.  Delicious!

I am a very experienced baker. I was not pleased with the outcome of this recipe. I was making side cakes for a wedding and this cake did not rise well. Tried it twice. If you want a perfect carrot cake use the Cake Doctor's recipe. It came out very high and even and everyone at the wedding raved about it..

This was my first carrot cake. It was amazing! I reduced the coconut to 1/2 cup, used 1 cup oil and 1/2 pineapple juice. I also increased the carrot to 1 1/2 cups. Everyone raved! It was so moist! Fantastic!!

This carrot cake is amazing! I took others' advice and reduced the oil to 1 cup and then added 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice. I also reduced the coconut to 1/2 cup. Also, my favorite cream cheese frosting to use with this cake is cinnamon cream cheese frosting, my version of the 'allspice cream cheese frosting' recipe. I substitute cinnamon for allspice and use vanilla instead of milk. A winner every time!

I made this cake exactly as directed for my daughter's 31st birthday and everyone loved it.  While sorting through the various recipes, I found it curious that this recipe called for one cup of carrots  while many other recipes called for up to three cups.  The result was that the cake tasted a little like a carrot/spice cake, very moist and delicious.  Next time I will try one of the other recipes with more carrots to see which one I prefer.

I made this into cupcakes, and everyone has enjoyed them.  I also added milk last second (just a splash)  and only added 1/2 cup of oil.  I just couldn't handle 2cups worth of oil.  I also added more carrots, about 2.5 cups worth.  To my amazement it seemed like I still needed more carrots.  It tasted great, but it lacked the carrot flavor I was trying to incorporate and that is why I am rating it a 3.  I am going to keep looking for a carrot cake recipe.

This cake really lives up to its name!  Everyone at my Easter party loved the cake and the piece I got the next day was even better then before.  I made the cake the day before my party and it was just so moist and delicious!  I will be making this again.

I thought this cake was delicious.  I made it for my Mother's birthday and she loved it.  I reduced the amount of oil as others suggested and it was still very moist.  My husband doesn't like coconut at all, but he liked it in this cake.

I made this, and the whole cake was gone the same night. People couldn't believe how moist it was and how well it stayed together. The flavors are amazing. The only thing I would change, would be the take the pineapple out of the can and shred it a little more, I didn't like having a chunk of it my bite, but I like the subtile hint of it. I also added pecans instead of walnuts and used 2 cups of carrots.

This made a really nice birthday cake for my daughter. I made it with vanilla cream cheese frosting. She loved it. I used my convection oven and needed an extra 15 minutes to cook through. I used a bundt pan.

I love this recipe.  The only changes I made: reduced oil and added left over sour cream, used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar, and left out coconut because we didnt have any.  Love it!

This is an amazing carrot cake recipe. The only adjustments I made were for personal preference: I added 1 cup whole wheat flour, added 1 cup of shredded carrots, used 3/4 cup Splenda and 3/4 cup brown sugar, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp, used 1/2 cup melted butter and 1 cup applesauce, used 4 tsps of cinnamon, 1/2 cup flaked coconut and 3/4 cup chopped pecans. I amde an Orange Cream Cheese frosting to jazz up the flavor a bit. SO GOOD!!! I have finally found the best carrot cake recipe and I will be making it frequently.

I've made this cake and cup cakes several times.  This cake is very moist I omit the coconut , very good without.  My co=workers ask all the time when I am going to cook another one.  My family love it.

I spoil people w/ this cake...it has been fought over at work...even made hunger games themed cake 11x17 w/ 9x13 top layer w/ it...it is so very popular worth taking time for. I toast nuts and coconut to enhance flavor and use a little salted butter w/ sweet to take down some of the sweetness of the sugar and I also use the NeufchÃ¢tel cheese to cut down some of the fat but not the taste...

Very good, but FAR too much oil.  I go half oil half applesauce and it works well.

I baked this and brought it into the office for my boss' birthday and it was a major hit!!  One of the guys told me I should give up my day job and become a baker!  I made 2 changes to the recipe - as per some of the other suggestions, I substituted 1/2 cup of pineapple juice for 1/2 cup of the oil.  I also baked it in a 13x9" pan instead of three 9" rounds.  I had to increase the baking time to about 50 minutes and unfortunately, when I opened the oven door after 40 minutes, the cake fell in the middle.  Still tasted great but looked awful.  All of the guys said this is a keeper and I am sure it will be requested for future birthday celebrations!

This is delicious. The first time I made it I tried to make some changes to make it healthier - DON'T DO IT. The recipe is perfect as is.
