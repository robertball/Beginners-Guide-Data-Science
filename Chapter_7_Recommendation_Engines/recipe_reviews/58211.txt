Cajun-country reviewer here to say this is about as authentic as it gets, though technically a Cajun home cook doesn't use recipes or measurements.  According to Louisiana tradition this would be served on a Monday -- supposedly an easy meal for laundry day because of the simmering time -- accompanied by sweet, plain, or cracklin' cornbread and a glass of iced sweet tea.  Practically speaking, it's a tasty & inexpensive any-day meal.  Oh, and, andouille is a cajun sausage made in Louisiana & pretty common in southeastern grocery stores; elsewhere, you might be able to find it in specialty stores or else ask if the manager of your grocery store can order it.

The andouille is a MUST for this to be authentic, Jacob's world famous andouille ships and is worth it when you can't get it locally. Also try vegetable oil instead of olive oil, it gives a different taste and instead of cooking the garlic first, throw it in during the simmer process to avoid the 'nutty' flavor of it frying, increase the bay leaves to 4 or 5 and use oregano instead of sage & thyme.  When completely cooked the beans should be very soft with a creamy consistency, use the back of a wooden spoon to smash some of the beans against the side of the pot as you stir them. EXCELLENT, also try serving with a bottle of pickled peppers at the table, sprinkle a little of the peppers vinegar on the beans for added spice.

Everyone loved this.  We made it vegetarian-friendly... instead of water, I used veggie broth; instead of sausage, I used veggie sausage crumbles.  You couldn't even tell because there are so many yummy flavors in this.  I used more cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper than the recipe called for.  I also used 4 cans of kidney beans rather than dried, and just added them when I added the sausage (I simmered the veggies in the broth with spices for about 1.5 hours, than added the beans and veggie sausage for the last half an hour).

This dish was absolutely delicious and packed full of flavor.  With any recipe..you have to make it your own. A little of this and a little of that goes a long way.  Of course it needs salt..you should add that before anything else is done...Most of these recipes are base recipes..something that you can build from. It's up to you to make it worth your while. With my revisions it was the perfect consistency, perfect flavor, just the right amount of spices..I did omit the celery and garlic clove. I used dried minced garlic, red and green bell peppers, lots of cayenne, Tony's creole seasoning and chicken broth...not that store bought stuff but just regular water with better than boullion chicken base..(can be found in just about any grocery store) instead of water, I also used a little sage and cumin. I replaced the olive oil and used butter.  I seasoned my vegetables while they were carmelizing. I loved it and my fiance thought it was the best thing since white bread,,,needless to say I will be making this again.

A little tip from someone who was born, raised and still lives in south Louisiana... instead of oil, brown the sausage and saute the trinity in the rendered pork fat from the sausage!  You'll never use oil again!!!

Awesome recipe!  Very authentic, and I'm from the south.  I decreased the oil to 2 Tbl. to cut down on the fat, decreased the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp. (just personal preference), and used the "Simple Cajun Seasoning" recipe found on this site.  I cooked everything with the lid on for the first hour to keep the water from evaporating, then cooked 1 more hour with the lid off (2 hours total was perfect).  I used turkey smoked sausage to, again, cut down on the fat (added the last 30 minutes of cooking).  After cooking, I added 1 1/2 tsp. salt.  The next time I made this, I was half asleep and used pinto beans when I should have used red beans - still came out great!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was awesome. I thought i would never be able to duplicate grams red beans and rice! Nothing i tried came close to her cajun cookin. The only thin i did different was to smash the beans against the side of the pan once they started gettin soft. Thats how she did it and it produces a thick gravey type sauce. Smelled awesome while it was cookin. Took less than 2 hours to cook, probably cuz i used small red beans instead of large kidney beans. had to add a little more water or it would have been to thick. We also dont have andoulli in MI, ive only seen it in LA. I used eckridge smoked sausage and it still was great! This is now my new recipe! THANKS

This was about as authentic as I have had outside of NO!  Only difference was I used chicken STOCK (not broth) which made for a more flavorful dish.  Definitely worth making!

I disagree that andouille is absolutely essential to an authentic red beans & rice.  By definition, Cajun and Creole cuisine is "peasant food" that makes use of what is on hand by people who lived off the land (e g. Cajun) and/or cooked with secondary protein sources rejected by the rich (basically, the scraps - e.g. Creole).  I think what you purists are referring to as "authentic" is in fact "traditional".

In New Orleans even, andouille isn't the only protein that can be used in an authentic red beans recipe.  You could use andouille, or tasso, or boudin.  In the bayou (e.g. Donaldsonville, etc.) and on the plantation (West Feliciana Parish, etc.) you would also see smoked turkey necks, smoked ham hocks, pig feet, pork belly, alligator meat, etc.

In fact, some of the oldest and most authentic recipes I've found for this dish contain only salt pork or pickled pork.

I've even found fully vegetarian recipes that are older than the invention of andouille.  Let's not forget, this dish is all about stretching a small amount of protein into a full meal in the autumn months when meat is scarce and what meat they had was being hoarded/preserved for winter.

All that being said, I absolutely love andouille.  I just find it ludicrous to get all snooty and stuck up about what started off as the furthest thing in the world from pretentious.

YES. but,, The other tradition is that a ham was served for Sunday dinner (OBTW Sunday dinner is served about 2:00 in the afternoon on Sunday) and on Monday morning the remaining ham and ham bone and all of the other ingredients were put into the pot at the same time and allowed to cook all day.  The beans had to have been soaking overnight.

This was a great recipe!  Like most, I made a few modifications to suit my tastes.  I doubled the cajun seasoning but used the lowered sodium version and found it still needed salt so I added a tablespoon of kosher salt and about 1/2 tsp. black pepper.  I also added about 2 T. worcestershire sauce and used half the oil.  I wanted to cut the fat content, so I used Jennie-O lean smoked turkey sausage instead of andouille.

I made this recipe yesterday.  The aroma was WONDERFUL.  My mouth watered as it simmered away on the stove.  I tasted the broth after it had cooked for an hour and decided it needed salt, so I added a tablespoon.  Perfect.  I cooked it for the time recommendations listed in the recipe, but when it was done, I felt it was overcooked.  An hour and a half would have been sufficient, I think.  NEXT TIME:  I’ll use tiny red kidney beans instead of the standard (available in most grocery stores).  I’ll dice the veggies and sausage and make it into a hearty soup instead.

I didn't rate this recipe as good as it is.  It is a great rendition of red beans and rice just as written. I have made this recipe many times with great results.  When I'm feeling lazy I use Miami Beaches base recipe with one significant change that many of you will likely discard.  Instead of using EVOO, I use bacon drippings that occupy a spot on my kitchen counter.  Not the healthiest choice but the flavor is there and that is the southern way - just exercise more:)

Several Cajun dishes; gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice, are so much better with a roux at it's base.  Creating a roux adds an extra 45 minutes to this recipe, but it is worth the time and effort. This is the method I use when I want to "do it right". 

To modify the recipe as I have, modify step two with the following. You will need to add an extra 1.5 cups of water in step 3. For clarity, an additional step - "2a" - is added as well.

2. Mix 1/4 cup of bacon grease (or oil of choice) and 1/4 cup of all purpose flour in skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until the roux is mahogany brown in color.  This will take 30-45 minutes!   

2a. Add the celery, onion, garlic, and bell pepper to the roux and cook for 5 minutes. 

Continue with the steps Miami Beach outlined with the original recipe.

FANTASTIC!!  Did this in the crock pot, so I skipped a lot of the steps.  I soaked my beans over night then put then in the crock with 4 c chicken broth and 2 c water as well as everything except the rice.  I put the rice in about 30 min before serving... I used about 2.5 C instant rice.  I did double both the cayenne and cajun seasoning as well as added some cumin because I like it very spicy.  Like many others I also added salt, but that's pretty personal, so just add salt to taste.  The Andoulie makes the dish.  The neighbors had never had red beans and rice and loved it.

I've never had authentic red beans & rice--so if you want an expert opinion about that--find another review. BUT I am a pretty awesome cook (according to my 3 kids & husband anyway!) and this was a great dinner for us. The directions are easy to follow, the ingredients are accessible (meaning I didn't have to fly to Tibet for a 1/2 tsp. of anything--relatively speaking), and the taste was super. My only semi-negative comment is directed towards myself because the only andouille I could find was "meh" which meant the flavor IT imparted was also average. SO make sure you go to a real butcher and ask for their andouille & don't use middle-America-glorified-hot-dog andouille! The extra effort will be worth it.

This was fantastic!  I modified the seasonings a tad.  Didn't use cayenne, thyme or sage. Doubled up on the cajun seasoning, added garlic & onion powder.  This dish needs salt so added towards the end.  Threw in 2 smoked ham hocks for good measure and used 5cups chicken stock instead of plain water.  Let is simmer for 2.5 hours and mashed some of the beans which thicked up the sauce.  DELISH!!! served with white rice, corn muffins (Jiffy brand & added corn kernals & sharp chedder to mix) and steamed broccoli.  Served with a bottle of Tasco on the side.  Hubby asked me to make again half way through the meal.  It's a keeper!

This was a wonderful version of red beans and rice that I made for my daughter's wedding. Her husband is Cajun and this was for a pre-wedding bash. We served with catered ettoufe and jambalaya. It was a big hit and everyone thought it was authentically made. I didn't use bay leaves because we did'nt have any and I mixed the rice with the beans. It made plenty and was all eaten. It does take some time prepping but definately worth it.

This is a great recipe but I changed the cooking method around.  I first browned the sausage, removed it from the pan and then added in the chopped veggies to brown them.  I only used a few tablespoons of olive oil.  Then I added in chicken broth instead of water along with the beans.  I didn't pre-soak the beans and never do.  It only takes about 30 minutes extra cooking time and then I don't have to remember to soak beans ahead of time.  I increased the cajun seasoning to 2 tsp. and think it could have used more.  Overall, a good recipe but needs a little extra spice for my tastes.

Really a simple thing to put together and let simmer while busy doing other things. Rather than using kidney beans, I did use small red beans and subbed in a red pepper for the green (It's what I had). Also, it may not be very authentic, but something I've done and love with most of my bean dishes is an addition of raw chopped veggies and some cilantro at serving time. I used a concoction of finely chopped carrot, red and yellow peppers, and some green onion with cilantro. The flavors are great together and the texture and crunch it adds is very tasty. Pass the hot sauce. Good recipe thank you.

This is a good recipe that I'll adjust and make again. There's a *LOT* of confusion, but kidney beans and red beans are technically two different animals. Red beans are the smaller of the two, and (IMHO) more flavorful than the common kidney bean.

There are as many recipes for red beans and rice as there are for spaghetti sauce, meaning you can tinker with the recipe to suit your tastes.  A ham hock really adds flavor.  When serving the beans over the rice I like to top them with a couple of spoonfuls of an onion salad recipe that comes from Leon Soniat, the former food editor of the N.O. Times Picayune (thinly slice two white onions, add 3 TB olive oil, 1 TB vinegar and some salt and pepper.  Refrigerate)

I changed it up to suit my "Okie" way of cooking. 1 1/4 teaspoons of dried oregano, 4 Tablespoons of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, 1 Tablespoon of dried parsley, 2 Tablespoons dried onion flakes, 2 Tablespoons minced garlic, 1 Tablespoon of salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 3-4 Tablespoons Knorr chicken flavor bouillon, 6 cups of water, 1 bag of beans soaked over night and big chunks of ham. Put it all in crock pot on high and cook till done. Mash 2-3 Tablespoons beans in cup and add back in crock pot for thicker beans. I fix a pot of white rice and sweet cornbread to go with the beans. Talk about A-OK YUMMY!!!!

Midway through cooking this recipe, I didn't think it was going to turn out well. However, with a little tweaking of the original recipe, it turned out great! The original recipe didn't indicate whether to simmer the beans covered or uncovered, so I did both. I covered the beans for about 2 hours, then cooked them uncovered. I cooked the beans about 30 minutes longer after adding the sausage, which ensured that the beans were fully cooked and soft. I also added about a tablespoon of salt. I would also recommend letting the beans cool a bit before serving - - it enhances the flavor and allows the sauce to thicken. I would definitely make this again!

The people on here who substitute smoked sausage for the andouille and then complain that it isn't spicy enough are killing me! You've got to use the andouille if you want the extra kick! Also, to make it a little spicier, I throw my veggies in the pan after I brown the sausage. Give them a little andouille grease bath before adding them into the beans. Also, try using Weber  brand "N'Orleans Cajun" seasoning if this dish wasn't hot enough for you. It is H-O-T Hot!
I substituted 2 (15 oz) cans dark red kidney beans (making it not so authentic). Only used 1 cup water. Added 1 can chicken broth and 1 can tomatoes. Scaled down cayenne pepper by half because of the little ones. Awesome recipe!!

Quite good. I made per the recipe except added more bay leaf, more cajun seasoning & a little worcestershire. I used wild hog smoked sausage as well, and of course I "mushed" a lot of the beans after they'd gotten soft. The one thing it definitely needs is salt! But wait until near the end as it may depend on the particular sausage you use. I do think using broth in place of water would have added more flavor as well. Overall, great recipe!

I am from Louisiana and have been moving around because of my husband's active duty military status.  This is by far the most authentic red beans and rice recipe I've tasted!  I had been so dissapointed in the red beans and rice that I had been ordering from restaurants.  Now I have a recipe that enables me to have the "taste of home" no matter where we end up!

I followed this recipe and it made my house smell wonderful but in the end I found it a bit bland. Seasonings need increased in my opinon. I DID use red beans instead of the kidney seeing how red is the true authentic but they got overcooked and split. My 4 star is not based off of that thought since the recipe does actually call for the kidneys which are bigger and would logically take longer to cook. Great start to a potential great meal but I truly belive the the spices need increased along with the additon of some LA hotsauce sprinkled over the top. I will make again but with tweaks to suit our taste.

I'm not from the southeast, so I have nothing to compare these to in terms of authenticity. However, I thought they were delicious. I used the ingredients in the recipe exactly except I didn't have sage, and I added some salt at the end. Also, I used chicken sausage. Can anyone from the south tell me how much using pork changes the flavor? I might use it for flavor next time and keep the chunks big so that I can move them to the side. 

One reviewer said her pan scorched. Mine would've too if I hadn't added additional water. I know from a lifetime of making pinto beans that you must monitor the water level of the beans unless you have the measurements to your recipe down and have mastered it on your stove. My parents never liked to measure, so they always had a pot of boiling water next to their pot of boiling beans to add if the beans got too dry. 

Several reviewers said they used canned beans because they have bad luck with beans, so I thought I would add some tips. My mom always said to add salt the last 10-15 minutes before the beans are done because if you add it sooner the beans might not soften. Also, use fresh beans. With pinto beans, the lighter the beans the fresher they are. I am sure there is a rule of thumb for red beans. Make sure you sort the beans too! If not, you might end up with bad tasting beans or rocks!

This was DELICIOUS!!!!!! My first time cooking dry beans and I thought I would try this... Oh my gosh!!! It could not have tasted any better!!! I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed my sliced andouille first to get a good sear on the outside. I then sauteed the vegetables in the remaining fat from the sausage (not the healthiest option but well worth it in taste) I also used half chicken broth and half water (6 cups of plain water sounded to bland) After 2.5 very miserable hours of smelling this delicious aroma throughout the house, I added all the vegetables in with the sausage and seasoned it a bit more (with various spices). All I can say is WOW!! I served half that night for dinner (over white jasmine rice- the sticky kind used in asian cooking for sushi). The sticky rice really helped hold it all together and prevented everything from becoming a broth-like soup. The rest I froze in individual servings for a later date. 5 Star recipe for sure!

NOW THIS IS IT!!! About as authentic as it gets. Though every family from New Orleans has there own little tweek of the recipe this one is very good. Being a New Orleans Native the only thing we do differently in my family is add New Orleans Hot Sausage and a ham hock to the recipe. We also smash the beans just a bit at the end to thicken up the roux. I cook this a-lot in the crock pot on low for 8 hours and it comes out great. The flavors blend well. I also let my beans soak overnight, which helps with the cooking.

Great recipe!  I followed the advice of several of the reviewers and used chicken broth for some of the water and replaced the thyme and sage with oregano.  I also added a teaspoon of sea salt.  I soaked the beans overnight and then put everything except the sausage and rice in a crock pot and cooked on high for six hours.  I didn't saute the vegetables first, just left out the oil and added them right in with the beans.  I added the sausage and cooked for an additional half hour while I cooked the rice.  It was just spicy enough for me and not too spicy for my kids.  Thanks for a keeper!

This was very delicious. I got nervous as I was cooking it because I used 2 cans of red kidney beans instead of the dry beans. I had read another review that said she cut the cook time in half since she used can beans. So I browned the sausage. Then cooked the veggies in the grease left over from the sausage. Poured the veggies in one container of chicken broth, it ended up being about 4 cups I believe. Let it simmer for about 30 minutes then added the sausage in with the beans/spices/veggies/broth that had been simmering for 30 mins. Still when I was done it was too soupy. I read other reviews where people added the rice in the pot. That thickened it up just right. I was worried for nothing because it turned out amazing since I added the rice with the mixture. I also added more Tonys seasoning and extra cayenne pepper since we love spicy. Used 3 bay leaves, oregano, parsley. I kinda just threw ot in as I thought necessary. Thanks for great recipe. Oh and I added one can of tomatoes/chiles when I added the sausage to the mix. So overall I had celery, bell pepper, tomatoes/chiles, garlic, onion, beans, and sausage. I use a microwave rice cooker because I am terrible at cooking rice. I cook my rice in the rice cooker and add the done rice to the pot of all of the spices/meat/veggies.

I soaked 2 pounds of beans overnight, thinking I wanted mine to be more BEANY than sausage.  I ended up using only 1.5 pounds as that is all my dutch oven would hold!

I cooked the vegetables in my Lodge dutch oven with some olive oil (not 1/4 cup) and then added the beans, water and spices.  I also added a ham bone.  Before adding the sausage I thought it needed salt, but I waited, and I am glad I did.  By the end, I thought the flavor was perfect and no salt was needed.

This was excellent, and I will be putting this into semi-regular rotation.  I took some of the directions from others (added salt, added some additional seasonings like onion powder and garlic salt) but remained pretty true to the recipe.

I have 3 suggestions that work for me.  I put some baking soda in with the beans while soaking, it helps with the unfortunate side effects of eating beans, and shortly before serving I mash the beans to make it more of a gravy, which is the preference in my house.  It tastes best,imo, with cornbread crumbled either on top or between the beans and rice.  This is real comfort food and is good in the crock pot, too.

My husband went to Tulane and he said this recipe was quite authentic! He recommended just giving it a couple extra hours simmering low on the stove. We used sweet italian sausage as not to scare off our daughter with the spiciness of the andouille, but had a bottle of Tabasco on the table to spice things up a bit if we wanted!

I found this a very easy, affordable, and tasty recipe with just the right amount of spice.  I followed the recipe exactly but used andouille chicken sausage (a bit milder than the one I normally can find) and the cajun spice mix from this site (leaving out the optional red pepper flakes).  Like many others, I served this with a side of cornbread.  I will definitely make it again.

I give this recipe a double thumbs up!  Every year I attend a homeowners meeting where there is a themed potluck dinner.  This year it was a Cajun theme and I made this dish.  Not only was this dish gone in a few minutes, but I had people asking if I had made more so they could have seconds.  I used a combination of white and brown rice, use canned red beans as I had limited time and added just bit of chicken broth at the end of the cooking time as it seemed to be a bit dry - I may have had the heat too high while simmering. This is definitely a hit and will make it again and again - 5 stars!!   DTCookin'

After trying and failing with many other Red Beans and Rice recipes, I finally found a great one!  I always add a little extra andouille, use canned kidney beans instead of soaking them, and add some chopped jalapeno peppers along with the onion and peppers. GREAT recipe!

This is a good, basic recipe for red beans and rice. There are many strongly held views about this. One holds that the beans should be cooked with pickle meat--readily available in Louisiana. It's stew pork that pickled in vinegar and spices for about 3 days. Another view uses a hambone or hocks. I've tried all three and prefer the hambone. Some people swear by Camellia brand kidney beans (Wal-Mart) because they cream-up better than other brands. Smoked andouille is available almost everywhere. Excellent fresh which will need browning is available at Whole Foods. I don't think pre-soaking the beans much matters given the long cooking time.

Outstanding!  Like others, I made some changes - I used far less oil, more Cajun seasoning, chicken stock instead of water, and andouille-style turkey links... this tasted amazing!  Not necessarily a work-night meal due to the cooking time, but definitely worth the wait - the overall flavor was surprisingly authentic and just simply delicious.  I even left out the celery and it was still great. Highly, highly recommend.

I love this recipe and I everyone I make if for loves it! But I made a few minor changes. After soaking my beans, I cooked them in the crock pot for about 5 hours, then I added all the other ingredients UNCOOKED. I just threw them all in and let them cook on low for about 4-5 more hours.Turned out delicious over the white rice. I also used a cheddarwerst sausage. I just use whatever sausage is on sale or that I have on hand. Doesn't seem to matter. I also ALWAYS use Tony Chacheres Creole Seasoning.

This is delicious my husband could not stop talking about how good it tasted. I wanted to make it that day so I used 4 cans of red kidney beans vs the dried beans. I used 3/4 chicken broth and 1/4 water. I did not omit any ingredients and added the andouille sausage the last hour of cooking. When I made the rice I used chicken broth instead of water. I would definitly make this again and recommend this recipe.

We enjoyed this recipe, but I did make some revisions.  I used 3 cups of chicken broth for part of the water, red pepper instead of green because that's what I had on hand, and used all cajun spice mix rather than separate herbs and used a liberal amount.  I also added a 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes with the andouille once the beans were tender.  My sauce was thick and flavorful, and I added the rice directly to the pot and mixed in rather than spooning the beans over the rice.  In our opinion, the andouille is crucial--nothing else adds the flavor and kick that this adds!

I'm from Louisiana and I always loved my Grandma's Red Beans and Rice. She used a ham hock which was boiled in the same pot the beans were cooked in, First boil the ham for 15mins, theadd beans, cooked vegetables and seasonings. turn heat to med-low and simmer until beans start to burst and create a creamy gravy, or if you are impatient smash some of the beans after they have softened against the side of the pot. This is a main dish not a soup,  serve with your favorite sausage, which has been baked or grilled. Andouille or Hot Links work best for me.

This recipe was very easy to make. We had extra Italian sausage that I needed to use so I substituted that in place of the Andouille sausage. I live in a small town and don't believe I can find that sausage here anyway. Even using this other sausage the recipe has an amazing flavor. We added this to our recipe box and I'm making it again this week. Thank you for sharing.

The best red beans and rice I've ever had! Slow cooked in a crock pot. Used "simple cajun seasoning" recipe found on this site. If you like your food spicy, add more cayenne then called for.

I loved this dish. Mine doesn't look like the one in the picture though. I hate the color of this dish, it looks grayish/brown and disgusting, but the flavor is great. The first time I cooked it, I followed the recipe to a T, and the dish looked even worse than the second time; the beans had fallen completely apart, and were mushy. I don't like super mushy beans, so the second time I made it, I cooked the beans for only an hour; this was much more to my liking. Love this dish!!

The best I've ever had and quite a differenced from the same ole, same ole that my mom and grandma used to make. I'm from Baton Rouge, La. and was very impressed with the outcome of this recipe!  I did however make some changes...added salt, extra cayanne pepper and extra Tony's Chachere. To thicken up just a little, toward the end (and before I put in the andouille sausage), I took a LARGE spoon of the beans and smashed them, then stirred them back in.  Gives the juice a little more substance!  Thanks for the recipe.  It will be a regular in my home for dinner!

You left out an important step most Cajun cooks take to thicken the sauce and complete the flavor.  When the beans are fully cooked, mash about a third of them before adding your sausage.  The beans will then get a gravy like consistency to the sauce like the original Cajun dish.

I don't enjoy speaking negatively, but this just isn't a proper red beans and rice recipe.  There's not nearly enough seasoning for the amount of ingredients, and there're too many vegetables for the bean & water ratio.  

I naturally season with salt and pepper in stages whenever I cook but am incredibly confused that there is no inclusion of salt in the seasonings whatsoever.  I understand in other recipes because you usually start off by rendering bacon lardons - and including a good hamhock tends to add extra flavour - but this was just bland as all hell.  

I thought it would be okay since my girlfriend enjoys bland food, yet she won't even eat it!  Now I've got roughly 2 quarts of this stuff sitting in my fridge and I can't bring myself to throw it out, so instead I'm forcing myself to eat it, begrudgingly.  

Hate to leave a bad review, but this just ain't the business.

I made this the day before we ate it. So to keep it fresh, I separated the beans and sausage from the broth, and stored it in the refrigerator over night. The broth was a bit thicker than it was when fresh, But over all it was still good.

I made this using the cajun spice recipe from this site titled, "Cajun Spice Seasoning in a Jar" for my gluten free sister's birthday. I was able to find sauage that was also gluten free.  Everyone at the party raved about the flavor, texture and how filling it was.

Spicy but really good! Makes a lot. Make sure you soak the beans in a large pot, as a small one will not make it through the night in terms of water.

This is my first time commenting - but I just had to because this recipe was SO GOOD! Right up there with some amazing red beans and rice I've had in New Orleans. SO SO GOOD. The only thing I did differently was I added salt to taste and it was perfection.

An absolutely fabulous recipe! Authentic taste. The only thing I can suggest to improve on this recipe is to replace 2-3 of the 6 cups of water with stock. I had some stock from pork hocks that I had cooked a few days earlier and that really imparted a rich flavor to the beans. I think any flavor of stock would work. Also, I think the recipe could use some more salt than just what's in the Cajun seasoning. Also, when using dry beans remember that soaking overnight really means 24 hours, not 8 or 12. The person who gave this a 1 star review probably didn't soak their beans long enough. Thanks for the great recipe Miami Beach!!

Excellent!! I grew up in the deep south and this taste just like my mom's. The only change I made was to use an extra 1/2 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper to kick fit up a notch and turkey sausage to cut down on the fat content.

This can be made healthy! Alright, maybe it's not "authentic", but this recipe does great with less salt, brown rice, and some turkey sausage. I basically followed the recipe, but made the above substitutions. I used homemade Cajun seasoning that has very little salt. It's just 1 T salt, 1 T oregano, 1 T paprika, 1 T cayenne pepper, and 1 T black pepper. I put in a full tablespoon of this and it was super spicy. I liked it, but the kids were a little overwhelmed. No one missed the salt. Next time, I'll use a little less of the Cajun. Also, I used rinsed canned small red beans because I've had no luck with dry beans. And finally, who still cooks their rice on the stove top?? You can cook brown rice in 30 minutes- 1 C rice, 3 C water, 10 minutes on high, 20 minutes on half power. No watching, no stirring, and no rice stuck to a pot. It may not be authentic Louisiana, but it's become our healthy family version!

Awesome recipe! I used the Simple cajun seasoning recipe from this site for the cajun seasoning and served with grandmother's buttermilk cornbread also from this site. Delish, thanks for the recipe:)

Red beans & rice is my favorite meal, so I had high hopes for this, and they were completely met.  I used 1.5 lbs of beans and a little more of each of the spices.  Used turkey smoked sausage and just used enough water to reach one knuckle length above the level of the beans in the crockpot.  Also added a ham hock to add some more flavor.  Cooked in the crockpot for 8 hours. The best red beans and rice I have ever made!  Don't tell my mom, but I think it's better than hers ;).

Used 3 cans of drained kidney beans (so no overnight soaking) and veg oil instead. Added more salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning. Also, didn't have andouille sausage so used smoked sausage. I simmered the vegetables and seasonings for 1 hour and added the beans when I added the sausage. Cooked for 1 more hour and smashed some of the beans on the side of pot to make the sauce thicker. However, make it as written before adding any extra ANYTHING. Plenty of reviews says it's too spicy or salty and plenty say there's not enough spicy or salt.

This is a great recipe.  I used Camilla red beans.  I waited to add the seasoning and veggies until the beans had cooked for about an hour.  My husband is from Louisiana and he loves beans.  However I grew up in Mississippi and was use to eating ham or ham hock in our bean.  So I cooked a pot of neck bones until they were super tender.  I pulled the meat from 90% of the bones. I added the cooked neck bones to the beans when I added the sausage.  I did not have audoulle sausage.  Its hard to find in North Mississippi.  I used regular smoked sausage. Make sure its pork sausage and not beef.  Both meets mixed together with the onions, bell peppers, celery, and other seasonings was awesome!  This was the best pot of bean I have ever had.  No joke...it was the best!

Fabulous sums it up.  The only changes I made were a bit more sausage and the addition of sweet basil, removal of sage (not a sage fan here) - it turned out wonderful and I had forgotten just how filling red beans and rice are.  

I highly recommend this particular recipe to any wanting to make true style RB&R.

This is a very good recipe.  I kept thinking it was missing something, but it was the dash or two of cider vinegar!  It adds so much flavor.  This is definately a dish that is better the second day.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a really good recipe. The flavor was out of this world. I didn't have dry kidney beans so I used pintos. Also for those of you who don't like alot of heat, I suggest that you decrease the cayenne to 1/4 tsp or less. My husband liked them served over cornbread not rice. But thats just a southern thing.

These were really good.  Spicy, but good.  Didn't use bell pepper & used Creole seasoning b/c I didn't have Cajun.  Andouille sausage is spicy!  I think next time I'll try regular smoked sausage (I know it won't be authentic then, but the kids will be able to eat it.)  Thanks for the recipe!

Great receipe! Delicious, made it for a potluck. Subbed chicken stock for water, reduced by 1-2 cups, added extra cajun and cayenne (I dont like too much heat and even I thought it needed a little more). Other than that, delicious!

yum! this was very good but too spicy for my tastes. I added a bit of salt, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. This was easy to make, but time consuming because you have to let it boil for so long, but to me it was worth the wait. Next time I make this I will for sure use less hot pepper though, I wanted to eat more but my mouth was on fire! For me, the sausage adds enough heat on its own, I won't add any other hot ingredients next time.

I didn't want to spend money on cajun seasoning at the grocery store, so I made a small batch of Emeril's "Essence" cajun seasoning: 1/2 tsp each of salt and garlic powder, 1/4 tsp each of black pepper, onion powder, cayenne pepper, dried oregano, and dried thyme.  The amounts add up to 2 1/4 teaspoons of spice.  I used 1 tsp as directed in the recipe.  Next time I may use the entire amount.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! I haven't had red beans and rice like this since I was in LA. I asked for the recipe and was told, "Just what you like, child." I never was able to make it taste well until now! I'll be making this at least once every two weeks! Thanks!

I remember the first time my mom made this, I fell in love with it, but....it didn't taste nothing like this. This is absolutly fantastic. I didn't have the dried beans so I substituted Glory brand New orleans style canned beans, and I also used the creole seasoning found on this site. Unfortunatley I wasn't able to get any andouille so I used turkey sausage instead which wasn't bad at all, I can only imagine how much better it would have if I could have used andouille.

I have come back time and again to Caroline's recipe for Authentic Louisiana Red Beans and Rice. I grew up in New Orleans, so I know my red beans, and this is the real deal. When I was living in New Orleans, this red beans recipe was always the hit of my Mardi Gras party. (This recipe refrigerates well overnight and heats up easily when it's time for the party or time to refill the red beans on the buffet table!) Now that I live outside Louisiana, and cool weather has arrived, I soaked a bag of Camellia red beans overnight last night and I'm just about to start whipping up a pot of red beans. Thanks, Caroline, there's no better way to stay connected to my Louisiana roots than with great New Orleans food!

I love this recipe, but I cheat. I use turkey kielbasa, 1 can of beans and 1/2 can of refried beans (or 2 cans of beans and mash up 1 of the cans of beans before adding it to the veggies & liquid), and most of the seasonings. I use less water and add bullion if I have it. This way I can make it for dinner when I get in from work. It might not be authentic, but it is tasty. I try to let it simmer for 45 minutes before eating.

I pulled this recipe up to compare it to my Louisiana red bean & rice recipe and it is almost identical. I also use chicken stock instead of water and I add one small can of tomato sauce, 8oz, to add a little vegetable stock flavor. It won't give it a tomato flavor. I often place all ingredients in a crock pot in the morning, eight or more hours total time, and serve for supper over rice. Bon App'etit!

Delicious and simple. Made it with one minor alteration- but that was because I had the heat on the beans too high and almost burned them! (I had to add a cup of chicken broth after two hours to get it saucy again) Great flavor! My husband LOVED it. Definitely will make again!

I use bouillon cubes or stock instead of just water & only add salt & creaole seasoning to taste. I also added a few slices of bacon & some smoked meat. This great with cornbread (hot water or jiffy) .. *I'm from louisiana & I approve this recipe* :)

I love this recipe--and I did not add any meat!  I used 2 cans of red kidney beans, cut the other recipe ingredients in half, and added a 15 oz. can of chicken broth.  I let it simmer while I fixed the rice.   This was just the right amount for 2 people and it was delicious!

Perfect...followed recipe exactly as written and was so pleased with the results!  My wife isn't a big fan of beans but she loved it too. Definitely going into permanent repertoire.

A great recipe, one very reminiscent of several I've sampled in Louisiana. I don't rate any recipes I've tweaked and, while there are several variations possible, this one is very, very good as written

Great taste. I did add 2 or 3 smoked ham hocks. Then I cooked it long and slow. Probably not "Authentic", but it was wonderful.

Delicious! I will be making this again! I could not find the right sausage (and I didn't want to waste time driving to different stores) so I just used Italian sausage, not as authentic, but still delicious.

This is one of the best bean dishes I have ever tasted. I couldn't find the Andouille sausage so I just used 94% fat free turkey sausage and I used three large jalapenos instead of green pepper because of taste preferences. It was an amazing, flavorful dish. I can hardly wait to try making it with the Andouille sausage to see if it improves the flavor, but, honestly, I just don't think it possibly could. Wonderful!

It was pretty good. It made a lot of food too. The only complaint I have is that I really felt like it was missing something. I'm not sure what though. I did use the andouille sausage too - which is suprisingly hard to find in the Midwest.

Made this recipe in the crockpot. No need to soak the beans.  Browned 5 slices smoked bacon and used that grease instead of olive oil (less than 1/4 cup).  No sage. Added 2 cloves garlic to the sauted veggies (must have garlic!). Cooked on low for 8 hours in the crockpot.  Used smoked turkey sausage instead.  Came out GREAT! Will definetly make it again.

This is good stuff! I don't understand what some of the reviews mean when they complain that it's not authentic. It's authentic in every way. Perhaps one could specify Camellia brand red beans, but other than that .... ?????

I made this vegetarian by making a roux with vegetable oil and flour - 1/2 c oil to a little over 1/2 c flour.  I added veggie stock to the broth.  I put red beans in a slow cooker on high for three hours with onions, and then I added the other ingredients and cooked for another three hours, still on high.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It managed to be both spicy and bland at the same time.  The beans required serious doctoring to make them taste like something other than just 'hot'.  I had to add salt and several other spices to jazz it up. I would not make this again as written.

I thought this was not to my liking, due to no flavor. I made this for our mardi gras party and yes it had "heat" but no flavor, you could not taste any of the other herbbs . Will not make ths recipe again.

Awesome!  Dear Husband loved it!  Used small red beans. Swapped 1/2 of the water for chicken broth and doubled the Cajun seasoning per the suggestions.  Added about a teaspoon of salt/black pepper/garlic powder mix.
YUM!!!

My whole family loved this. I made a few modifications but the method outlined in this recipe is perfect. I read other recipes that included a ham hock, so I added a smoked turkey leg (a healthier subsititution) while the beans were simmering. I ommitted the cayenne and served hot sauce on the side since my kids would be eating this. It definitely needed salt, but I followed the other seasonings to the letter and it had great flavor. I substitued turkey smoked sausage for a healthier version, but next time I'll definitely indulge and use andouille! Great recipe!

Made some changes needed to increase the flavor of the dish, and with those changes it can be great! I took one star off because without those changes, i think it would be a quite bland. Used Bacon grease instead of OO to give the vegies a little porky flavor, and when the beans were halfway done I added 4 slices (with half of the recipe) of diced uncooked center cut bacon to them. At least doubled the cayenne, added 3x more garlic, added tabasco at the end, used rubbed sage because that's all I had, fresh parsley and thyme because I prefer it. ( no need to waste time stripping the thyme stems of their leaves, just throw the entire thing , stem and all, in there and take them out when its done, the leaves will have boiled off into the stew) had no cajun seasoning so honestly I just put things like paprika, oregano, cumin, red pepper flakes, and fresh rosemary, salt and pepper to make up for that ingredient. I doubled the bay leaves, crushed one to put in there and put the whole leaves of the rest, couldn't find adouille sausage so just used smoked. With these changes the dish was DELICIOUS. but if I were you I'd just add the herbs/spices stated and adjust to your taste afterwards. Make sure to add more herbs and spices if you end up (like I did) adding a lot more water. Also I think the entire recipe would only yeild 4-6 servings tops, not 8. I think I might try homemade chicken stock in the place of half of the water instead next time!

This was excellent!! In terms of taste, I personally would have given it four stars because it's just pretty darn good, but didn't knock my socks off.  BUT I got tons of compliments, my family loved it, this ingredient list was so accessible (no highly specific, difficult ingredients like bacon grease), and this was healthy, cheap, easy and satisfying so that it will be a frequent go-to for us in the future.

Good recipe.  I'm still searching, though, for that elusive flavor I found in red beans and rice down in New Orleans.  This recipe is very flavorful, but there's still something missing.

My husband and three boys just love this recipe. I've made it at least 10 times since finding it. I've only used Andouille sausage once because it's a little too spicy for my almost 2 year old.  I also use red pepper instead of green, but other than that, recipe is just perfect as is! We love having leftovers the next day, too! Great recipe! Thank you!!

I'm one of THOSE people. I changed the recipe as I cooked. My husband has never been a fan of red beans and rice so I thought this would be something he would enjoy since it includes meat. I added a can of tomato sauce and a dash of onion powder. It turned out delicious. My husband liked it. We haven't reached love because of the red beans but we're close and I'll take it!

I just made this, sat down with a bowl, and there happened to be some good jazz on the radio.  I felt like I died and was in heaven.  Make sure you have the hot sauce when you serve--it puts the sunshine in it.

Excellent!!! I am from Louisiana and love red beans and rice but have never had a recipe. I did, however, tweek it a bit on account I didn't have all the suggested ingredients...celery, bay leaves, cayenne pepper, sage, or andouille sausage.  Although I love andouille sausage, and know it would have made the dish all the better, I now live in Alabama and can't find it anywhere.  I only a 1/2 red onion and 1/2 green bell pepper.  Instead of teh celery, I used a bit of celery salt (to taste). For my particular cajun seasoning, I used Tony Chachere's and some Tabasco.  Since I used smoked sausage and the beans soaked up a good bit of the spice, it was just the right substitute! Awesome!!! And, even though I like a bit of Spice, it wasn't too spicy for the kids!!! ;)  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

I cooked mine fast and easy with canned red kidney beans and chicken andouille sausage. If my substitutions turned out so delicious, I'm guessing that from the dried beans, longer cook time and real sausage this one's a 5 star. Next time I'll plan ahead.

I made this as a treat for my husband who loves Cajun food.  We loved it!  I got a little carried away with the spices and it got really hot!  Next time I'll use less! There will be a next time!

This was good but nothing I would call spicy. If you like spicy, you'll need to add more. I didn't find the right sausage yet though, maybe that will add more flavor.

I'm so bummed by the way this turned out! I followed the recipe to a T and it was SO thick! I "simmered" for 2 1/2 hours, but the bottom scorched and then the whole dish tasted scorched. I'm not sure what went wrong in the process, but considering how long it took, it was definitely disappointing.

It came out really good but I had to make a lot of changes like other reviewers did.  I used 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning, replaced half of water with chicken stock, added more salt and black pepper, and pureed some of the beans and vegetables and put it back in the pot half way to simmering.  I only had smoked Kielbasa sausage so I used that.  I also used regular red beans.  I didn't have to  simmer for the entire 2 1/2 hours and 1 1/2 hours sufficed for me.  This was delicious.  I'll make this again.

Yum!  Simmered a ham bone with mixed beans.  For our tastes, it was a bit bland, but easily fixed next time with a bit more spices.  Thanks!

This was very hearty and full of flavour. I used less cajun seasoning as my little one wouldn't have eaten it with the heat. I used chicken sausage as that's what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty!!  I'm not from Louisiana so I had no problem cheating and using canned beans.  I used 2 cans of kidney beans and 2 cups of chicken broth.  It boiled down nicely and still made the yummy "gravy".  I cooked it for 1 1/2 hrs.  I added 1 tsp of oregano and plenty of New Orleans Blend Seasoning salt & Creole seasoning instead of "cajun" seasoning.  I also added the sausage in the beginning and didn't wait until the end.  My 3 & 5 year old loved it.  We had no leftovers, so I might have to double the recipe next time.

These beans were awesome.  I used small red beans rather than kidney beans.  I used yellow and orange pepper because that is what I had on hand.  My picky husband ate two helpings.  (Woohoo!)  I only cooked 2 hours and the beans were just right.

This was okay.  Not a lot of flavor, but it was good with hot sauce and I would make it again.  I used 31 oz. canned beans instead of dry.  I also don't know about the 6 cups of water direction . . . no where in the article does it say to drain the water, but that's what you are supposed to do, right?

Almost five stars.  At the end, I felt like it needed a tsp of gumbo file powder and salt.  Also, I find it helpful to caramelize the onions in bacon grease, not olive oil, before adding the beans.

Holy cow, this was so good on a cold night! I made it with 4 cans of small red beans and much less water instead of the dry beans, but left everything else the same. As others have noted, it is even better the next day.

This was amazing! I made it for guests and everyone ate 2 - 3 huge helpings and asked for the recipe. I couldn't find andouille, so used regular beef smoked sausage, but I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Just before I added the sausage, I smashed some of the beans against the side of the pot to make it thicker and creamier (since I read that this would make it more authentic). The texture was perfect. This one is going in my rotation! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I really liked this. I followed the recipe but didn't use the cayenne pepper which was good as it was spicy enough with the andouille. My husband thought it was too spicy but I think it was just right.

Excellent stuff.  If you're in a hurry, two cans of beans (rinsed) works.  You can also add a lot less water and cook it down faster, but the longer you can wait, the better it will be.

I feel bad having to review this without actually being able to make the recipe as given (can't get my hands on sausage) - but what I did make was simply marvelous. Had to use spicy italian sausage (only 2, crumbled) and small red beans (not kidney), but the flavors were simply fantastic.  Served with cornbread and salad and stumbled off to bed will full VERY satisfied tummy.  Wonderful.

This is about as close as you are gonna get to the authentic stuff.  Per six cups of water I used 4 chicken boullion cubes, I also added a teaspoon of chili powder and half a teaspoon of cumin.  I also used two cans of kidney beans instead of dried beans since that is what I had on hand. Aside from that I followed the recipe...good stuff, thanks for the recipe it is a keeper for our house.  Oh yeah I strained out and mashed half of the beans toward the end of cooking and returned to the pot for the creamy consistency.

Fantastic. Everyone complaining about the dish not being salty enough, when you add the water and the cooked veggies to the beans, throw in 7 chicken boullion cubes that will salt it perfectly. I also substituted oregeno for the parsley and threw in some cumin and marjoram just for kicks. Also I used three bay leaves and kielbasa as I don't care for andouille. Superlative flavor.

Very good recipe, one I will continue to tweak in the future.  I added about 1/2 c. corn, a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and about 1 c. okra after sauteeing them in olive oil with extra garlic and additional creole seasoning.  I'd like to make this again, adding shrimp, crawfish or possibly both.

My family enjoyed this.  We are vegetarian so I did not add the sausage (I could have used Boca Italian sausage or something but I did not have any - next time I will try that).  I added extra cajun seasoning, zucchini and jalapeno from our garden.

What a great recipe!!  I did change it up a little, but mainly because I just threw everything in the crock pot. I omited soaking the beans overnight, and the sauteeing of the veggies (i just threw them in after I chopped them), I added 2 ham hocks, and used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water instead of the 6 cups of water the recipe called for, and I left out the sage.  At the end, I used a potato masher and mashed about half the beans to give it the right consistency.  It was great!!  I hate judging a recipe less than perfect when I do things to change it without trying the original first, as it does sound good as written!!  I just didn't feel like watching the pot for a few hours!!

This was great. I used Bush's red beans in my recipe and my total cook time was 1h15m. Nixed the hock too. Otherwise I went by the recipe. It was great. My whole family loved it. There were no leftovers and I was asked to make it again........tomorrow. For cajun seasoning I used the "cajun spice seasoning mix in a jar" from this website. That stuff is awesome! This is definitely a keeper and is easily modified to suit your own personal taste. Thanks!

This is the best!
I tweak a bit...
I use Van Camps New Orleans Stlye Kidney beans (they are the best) Use 4 cans.
I use Chicken broth INSTEAD OF WATER.
and I use a whole package of aundoule sausage AND a whole package of Smokey Hollow cajun Sausage.
We live an hour from New Orleans and my family loves this better than any we have eaten anywhere!

I was so excited to try this recipe after reading the extremely favorable reviews. I may have completely missed the boat on this one somehow -- although I checked and rechecked the recipe & ingredients as I was preparing it -- but I was extremely disappointed with the way these beans ended up tasting.  I found the flavor to be difficult to describe -- somewhat bland BUT with a very definite (spicy) "bite" for an aftertaste that left my throat burning.  I believe it may be from the thyme(?)used in the recipe?  I don't know.  I'd be leary to try this one again...sorry.

I also couldn't find andouille sausage, so I too used lite kielbasa instead. Yes, the sauce doesn't thicken up much, but the rice really soaks it up nicely. I ended up using way more than 1 tsp of Cajun seasoning - I just added it liitle by little til it was how I liked it. Thanks!

This was really lacking in alot of things. It was too watery, needed salt. When it was finished, it looked like bean soup. I pureed a LARGE can of kidney beans, to help thicken it, and that did not help. I would not recommend this to anyone.

This recipe got rave reviews from my family. I did make several changes: I used a can of black beans instead of the dry kidney beans, added 1 can 14.5 oz. of diced tomatoes, added some salt and omitted the green pepper and only used 2 cups of water.

I made some changes to this and maybe that's why I didn't like it.  I used Cranberry beans instead of kidney beans and skipped the sausage since that's not available where I am and wanted to make it a vegetarian version.  I added some salt and pepper.  It was pretty sausy, which is good, but it just didn't have enough flavor.  I won't make this again.  I'll try some other rice and beans version.

Delicious!  I almost doubled all the spices since I like to kick it up a notch.  Since I was pressed for time, I used 4 cans of beans, like what the other reviewer recommended.  I placed everything in my Instant Pot and cooked for 14 minutes in high pressure.  It tasted like I had cooked this dish all day.  The flavors were awesome!  My whole family loved it and it was very simple to make.

I have made this 3 times now.  It is excellent.  We use red beans and instead of water we use home-made chicken broth.  All those store-bought rotisserie chickens, use them for broth. Much more flavorful than canned stuff.   I soak my beans overnight, but I just read where you don't really have to do that.
Follow the recipe closely, just titrate down the  cayenne pepper.
We usually make enough for 2-3 days.  Great meal and better leftover in my opinion.

This was great, I will definitely make this again. I added 2 chicken bullion cubes, 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin, and doubled the sausage. The sausage I sautéed in a pan before adding to the pot to increase the flavor. In addition I cut the cook time by 1/2 hour. Thanks for the recipe.

I must be missing something because it turned out extremely watery and not very flavorful. Followed the instructions as stated, using actual andouille (mine was an alligator/pork mix) and fresh veggies. When done, the broth tasted very watery and the veggies were dreadfully soggy. With all the spices I put in it should have been way better.

Very good - andouille sausage is a MUST for this. Thankfully I live in Texas and we have it in our markets. Instead of spooning it over rice I just mix the rice in with it. Makes great leftovers as well.

I love this recipe! I'm from Louisiana and it's very rare that I like my cooking better than other's cooking, but when I make this I feel like the BEST cook in the world.  I've made it 3 times now and every time its been amazing! Definitely needs salt and more cajun seasoning... but everything else is perfect.

I followed the recipe as it was written. This was my first time making red beans and rice, I did a really good job thanks to this recipe!! I will make it again and again. All this needed was a little salt to suit the eaters taste. I didn't add salt while it was cooking. I just let everyone add on as much or as little as they wanted once they fixed their plates.

Added quite a bit of salt. Very spicy for my family with small children, but that's easily rectified in future planning.

I made this without meat, and it was really good!!! I used canned beans. And I put the rice in with the bean mix for like the last 15 minutes of cooking and that's what I'll do next time. Also next time I'll add more peppers, like 4-5 cups water and maybe I'll blend up a can of beans to make it thicker.

I just made this tonight for dinner and it was amazing! I didn't have any sausage so I kept it meat free and I also added a can of diced tomatoes. Everyone, including my 4year old and 7 year old had seconds. I served with corn bread and tea, as someone suggested. Very filling and inexpensive. I used what I had on hand! 2 thumbs up!

very very good!! My husband is from Louisianna and is very picky about his red beans and rice and he loved this. I didn't have any celery on hand so substituted celery flakes. Next time I'll try real celery and see if it turns out even better!! Thanks

Lord knows how many recipes I have for Red Beans & Rice...been making it for years. With a couple of minor tweaks this is now my go to recipe. In addition to the andouille (no substitutes here) I will add another pound of meat...chicken or ham are great. I also use small red beans instead of kidney beans.
Excellent product....I use it in my catering business.

This is a good place to start.  I had to add more seasoning, the recipe amounts make it bland.  I season to taste so I don't have amounts.  I added more Cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper.  I also cooked the seasoning and herbs with the veggies before adding them to the beans. I had an Italian herb and cheese sausage on hand, so I used that.  It was good, but does not compare to the classic andouille sausage.

History says that Louisiana Red Beans & rice was made on Mondays; laundry day. So for the simplicity of doing so, I don't sauté the vegetables. Monday mornings everything into a pot bring it to a boil & simmer until family is home then cook the rice & corn bread.

Loved the recipe.  My 1st attempt at making them and they were good.  I used the sausage inn the recipe but I think smoked sausages would be fine also. I wouldn't darn toss out a good ham hock and I don't know why it says to do so either.  I didn't.

Overall, simple and easy to follow.

This turned out really good.  I did end up having to add a can of chicken broth the last hour of cooking as my beans were way too dry to continue cooking.  Other then that, it turned out delish! I served over rice and made sweet corn bread muffins to go with it. I will make this again.

Great recipe. I've used it before. This time I didn't have andouille sausage, so I'm using Cajon style boudin(boudain).

Pretty much followed the directions exactly. I did add two Knorr chicken cubes to the 6 cups of water, and added the garlic with the sausage as someone else suggested. Oh and I didn't have any sage, and added about a half teaspoon of salt. DELICIOUS!!!!

Only gave 4 stars because I didn't exactly follow the recipe of HOW to cook this but I DID use the exact spices listed and it was fantastic! First off, I didn't have the bell pepper or sausage. I also replaced 4 cups of the water with home canned chicken stock. [Here's the method to my madness: 1)Sort red kidney beans and "soak" using (5 quart) PRESSURE COOKER (put beans into cooker with 4 cups of water, bring to pressure and cook 5 minutes, let cool naturally). 2)Meanwhile, cook "trinity" (onions, celery, garlic) in bacon grease instead of olive oil. 3)Once pressure cooker is depressurized, rinse beans with cold water. Return beans to cooker and add vegetables, chicken stock, water, and spices; stir. 4)Bring to a boil and lower heat to simmer, uncovered, for about 45 min-1 hour. 5)Steam rice while beans are finishing.] I thought the kids would think it was too spicy but it was just right for kids and myself. The hubby added more Tony's (Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning) since he likes it a bit more on the spicy side. I think Frank's Red Hot Sauce or Tabasco would also be an awesome addition. This is going in the meal rotation for sure!!

Fills the house with a wonderful aroma. I had to omit the cayenne for the delicate northern palates in my house, but the andouille added a fair amount of zing. It's a great dish to make on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

I'm a vegetarian, so I left out the sausage.  I was worried it would lose so much flavor because of this, but it didn't!  I just used a little extra seasoning and added a little tobasco sauce, and it was so yummy!  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!  I found it 3 weeks ago and have made it three times now!  I oped the cajun and the cayenne and it was still great!  Our family likes it a little hot so it was perfect!  I have used regular smoked sausage and andouille and they both are great!
Thanks for a great recipe!!

Perfect! We loved this recipe. The only change I made was substituting smoked sausage for the andouille sausage. I didn't have any but I will definitely plan better next time.

OMG! This recipe is delicious. I made some minor changes based on many of the reviews. I reduced the liquid to 6 cups and used a mixture of chicken and beef broth. I also used two small hamhocks and 1 tbsp of the creole seasoning. Because of time, I simmered in a stock pot with lid on for first 3 hours and then tilted the lid for the last 3 -4 hours to reduce the liquid. It was nice and creamy, creating a nice rue. Next time I will try the crock pot overnight. I served this at a New Orleans "theme" party and it was a big hit. Definitely will make again. The dish was bursting with flavor and was not salty. I did use the andouille sausage, which is a must to add to the "kick".

Excellent!  I used a little bacon grease instead of the olive oil, added ham base to the water, doubled the cajun seasoning (recipe on this website) and added no additional cayenne pepper (personal preference on the spice/heat level).  The veggies cooked down to the point that even my daughter who does not like peppers/onions gobbled it up and was none the wiser!  I did find andouille sausage and feel that "made" the dish.  Five of us enjoyed this very much and there was slightly enough left over for a few lunches the next day.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!

I'm not from the south but these beans were amazing.  I too used 1/4 tsp of cayenne and added oregano.  I used all fresh herbs but followed the rest of the recipe and they came out great.  I was told by a fellow chef that the longer cayenne cooks the hotter it becomes so she like to add hers at the end to avoid the heat but still have the flavor.  Great recipe, I'll be using this again!

My family and I loved this recipe!  I used drained and rinsed, canned beans (didn't soak them), because I didn't have dry ones and I was jonseing for some red beans and rice.  I halved the water and cooking time, and it was still delicious.  Have the proper beans now, and will be making this recipes again next week.

Husband said this is the best beans and rice he's ever had!  I thought it was great too!  I did mine in the slow cooker so I skipped cooking the veggies and just threw them all in the crock.  I added the sausage in about an hour before we were wanting to eat it.  Easy and delicious!

We loved how this recipe turned out.  I made a few changes.  No bell pepper.  I used 4 tsp of Penzies Cajun seasoning and omitted all the ojavascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceholder$edit$saveButton','')ther spices.  I used 3 tsp of Kosher salt.  I also used a Chicken and Apple sausage instead of the traditional Andouille.  I'm not a Red Beans and Rice expert, but it still tasted great and was very simple to make.

This was awesome. My husband, who does NOT like sausage, lapped this up and wants it for lunch tomorrow! I made this last minute and couldn't locate my dry beans, so I had three cans of red kidneys and added one can at the beginning of the simmer time and the other two at the end, when I added this sausage. Next time I will use dry, because I just like to, but this tasted FINE with canned beans. 

I also made a bit of a roux, before I added the chicken broth (didn't use water, six cups of broth instead) and it made this nice and thick. Trust me, the sauce is A++, having a it a bit thicker was really nice for keeping it on the beans and rice. Oh, and I couldn't find my thyme...so I just skipped it. I also used a bit more garlic than was called for.

Perfect RBandR....I will make this over and over again. Use the actual Andouille, I cannot imagine this dish with anything else. Seriously, if it's not at your conveniently located grocery store, go out of your way and find it, you won't be sad you did. 

I gave this five stars, I would absolutely give it SIX if I could! TERRIFIC!

My husband and I absolutely loved this. Made a few modifications to suite our tastes of course, but it turned out great. Didn't add the rice, and used different sausage. Used some hot sauce/Tabasco sauce as was suggested by other reviewers. Definitely cooking this again!

I am giving this 5 stars, because although I made some changes, I can tell it was good to begin with.  I used red beans instead of kidney, I also chose to only saute the garlic for one minute to avoid the over-cooked taste. I increased the cayenne to 1tsp and the cajun to 2tsp and added half andouille and half turkey keibalsa sausage. It was excellent!

I've never eaten this before trying this recipe, and it's totally delicious! Had my parents over for dinner, and they said it was as good as they had tried when they were in New Orleans, except that we can't get andouille sausage here.

Ahhhh this is the best red beans and rice recipe! I modify it a little by adding a bunch of seafood-gumbo-stock to make a solid gumbo...yum.

Loved it.  Made a few changes.  I used 3 cans of kidney beans, a pkg of smoked sausage, 1/2tsp file, four cups of watter and a little extra creole seasoning.  I didn't saute the veggies in oil so that cut out some fat.  My family loved it.

After looking through all the recipes for beans and rice I thought I would try this one.  It is very good, but I did add more cajun seasoning (about 2 tsps more) and added habanero sauce in.  We don't have access to andouille sausage so I used smoked beef sausage in it's place.  I also made it in the crockpot and then transfered it to a pan to finish it.  Instead of making the rice seperate I put 1 1/2 cups long grain rice in with it and added about 2 cups of water and cooked it until the rice was done.  We used it to make bean and rice burritos and everyone liked them with the addition of more hot sauce.  Overall a good recipe!

This was alright, I am thinking I didn't like it as much because I have never really been too big on kidney beans- Thanks for the recipe though!

I converted this to a crockpot meal just for convenience. I kept it cooking all day and added chicken kielbasa (we don't have the sausage called for in this recipe here) and cooked a few more hours. My husband is a southern boy and he loved it! His stamp of approval on a southern dish usually means it is top notch! The only thing I would change is to add 2-3 tsp of salt to bring out the taste.

Awesome. Have cooked twice and family loves. First time did not have enough kick; so added extra hot pepper. We don't like kidney beans and used a combination of black, navy, and pinto. I also boil for 2 minutes, sit for one hour. Rinse and clean, soak overnight (or while at work). Beans have a lot less gas this way. I also have mixed up meats depending on what I have on hand.

My first try at Red Beans & Rice!  My husband and son said this was fabulous.  A little spicy for me, but I forgot to fix the cornbread that would have balanced it some.  Added some diced ham slice that I had leftover & I thought it needed some salt. My husband wanted it to be more gravy-like so I added a little instant flour & water which thickened it perfectly.  Makes a lot & I'm sure I'll be making again.

I never had this before but have heard of it and seeked out this recipe to try it.  I followed exactly as written.  It is AMAZING and so glad for you sharing it!  The andouille sausage is so smokey and spicy in it.  My 3 guys all ate it up with Cajun Sunshine hotsauce and although I doubled it, it only lasted a few days.  Thank you and I encourage others to try it, now today I'm making Crab cakes with remoulade sauce.

AWESOME!!!!  We took out the green bell peppers, but this is a wonderful recipe.  We used turkey keilbasa instead of andouille sausage - and it was great!!!!

We made a double batch and froze half!!!  Still wonderful!!!!!!!  Would recommend to anyone looking to make great red beans!!!!!

First time I have ever made red beans and rice and turned out pretty good. I did some tweaking based on other folks reviews. I used canned beans (no dried beans at the Trader Joe's and too lazy to go to another store), I used chicken andouille, chicken broth instead of water, used less oil and added some more garlic. I also took part of the beans and pureed them as others suggested to make it thicker. It definitely needed more cajun seasoning than the recipe called for. I used a tablespoon but may even use a tad more next time. In the end it did need something so I added some hot sauce and that seemed to do the trick! I think next time i may add more garlic too....

I live in Southwest LA so I've had red beans and rice many times, but this was some of the best! I used half of the cayenne it called for and next time, I might use just one bay leaf and less sage. I had to laugh when I saw how much cajun seasoning it called for. If you're from Louisiana, you used at least a tablespoon. Just to let y'all know, I read on another website to boil red or kidney beans for at least 10 minutes to release a toxin. It does take out a lot of the red color, but it usually ends up brown in the end anyway. Also, add a dash of hot sauce! Great recipe!

The beans took forever to cook and still weren't soft by the time the meal was served. Will adjust by using canned beans and minute rice next time. Same spices, though. They were good.

I took all these raw ingredients (plus 1/2lb crumbled boudin sausage) and threw it in the crock pot on low with 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water.  I also added a a few hamhocks for flavoring.

8 hour later was a masterpiece, I promise :)

Extremely authentic recipe, which gracefully adapts to variation. It's good to remember that this dish - like all other regional "comfort" foods - began as an economical way to feed families, using on-hand ingredients.  

I cut the oil in half, and made the following changes (based upon the ingredients I had available): omitted the celery; substituted fresh jalapeno for bell pepper; used coarsely-chopped turkey bacon instead of andouille; used brown rice in lieu of white.  In addition, I used a submersible blender to puree about one-third of the beans for a much creamier texture.

Purists might be apalled, but the final product still tasted quite authentic!

Not the best, I think maybe there were just way too many spices added. The base of the recipe is pretty good but we found it a bit too flavorful. And I'm not talking about mouthwatering flavor, I mean now I am confused because this now tastes like a dip instead of red beans and rice flavorful. I gave it a 3 starts because I decided to use it as a dip instead and it worked well but not so much with rice. It may just be me so it is worth a try.

Very good.  The house smelled fantastic!  It really needs the andouille sausage and luckily I was able to find some, even in Indiana.

This was very good, but we felt like it was bland - so at the end we added a few teaspons of Better than Bullion, chicken flavor.  That was what it needed.  Otherwise, fabulous.

First time making this and it was great.  Next time, I'll add some more salt.  Sprinkled it with green onions and Red Hot to serve.  YUM!

The dish needed more flavor.  Yes, the sausage did give it a kick but there was something missing.  Very bland.

Excellent flavor, we enjoy really spicy food so I added two sliced jalapenos to the vegetables. I also added 4 cups of chicken broth and only 2 cups of water. Will make again, feeds a crowd

Recipe works great, I used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water.  Might have to add more water as it cooks down. I also only used 1 bay leaf to not over power the flavor and doubled my cajun seasoning.

I couldn't find my New Orleans recipe book so I used this one and it was an awesome substitute.  My grocer didn't have andouille so I used Johnsonville's hot italian sausage which made a fine substitute.  Also, I cut pieces of cooked sausage up into small pieces and added it to the beans.  Will definitely use again!

Changes I made bc that's what I had on hand--1 pkg smoked kilebasa for andouille and 2 cans red beans vs dry and red pepper instead of green. I also added 2 ham hocks for extra flavor and simmered for several hours. Family loved it. We had no leftovers and it fed 6. Def will put it into the rotation.

So yummy!  I did not follow the recipe exactly, but I don't think that matters.  The biggest difference is that I used canned beans instead of dry to save time. Full flavor and just the right amount of heat made this dish a winner!

Dissapointed! Tasted flavorless.  Had to call my grandma in Louisianna who said to double the amount of cajun seasoning, add cumin, and use smoked sausage, not andouille. After that it tasted good.  However, she makes a slow cooker version that takes a fraction of the time, which I will use in the future!

Great recipe but was really spicy. would cut down on the cayene next time. also, the andouille sausage did not impress me especially for the price. I would use something else next time. overall, this was good.

This dish smelled amazing as I cooked it but lacked a bit of flavor. Admittedly I omitted the cayenne pepper because I was serving this to my kids. I reheated the leftovers the following day and added some garlic powder, more cajun seasoning and salt and it tasted much better. Maybe not as authentic but more flavorful.

This came out beautifully and my husband scraped his plate and ate what was left on mine!  Because I only had canned chili beans on hand, I had to alter the recipe a bit, so I'm not sure what it would have tasted like if I had used dried beans and was able to simmer for the full amount of time.  I cut the recipe in half, sauteed the vegetables in the olive oil until they were just starting to soften, then added 2 1/4 cups of water, the white rice, a can of drained and rinsed red beans and sliced chicken andouille sausage.  I also added the spices and the bay leaf, but after a taste-test, decided the flavor was off.  I tripled the Cajun seasoning (we like spicy!), and doubled the thyme and sage.  I kept the others the same.  I brought it to a boil, then turned it down to a simmer, covered it and cooked it for 20 minutes.  It was still a little too watery, so I turned up the heat and stirred constantly until the unwanted liquid evaporated--about 2 minutes.  At this point, the only thing it really needed was 1/2 tsp. salt.  This tastes just like the red beans and rice I ate as a child and will definitely be part of our permanent rotation.  Thanks so much for the great base-recipe!!

Simple, easy, satisfying, and perfect for feeding a crowd. I sauted the sausage and veggies to a light brown for added flavor before adding them to the beans. Note: this recipe feeds 8 HUNGRY MEN. I doubled the recipe for a crowd of 14 and ended up with enough to feed an army. Still, I'm not complaining as this recipe is easy on the purse and is really tasty.

Me and my fiancé have prepared this meal twice and have absolutely enjoyed it. This is about as authentic as you can get. We followed the recipe exactly and added salt to taste. Also to thicken up the bean juice I press my beans against the side of the pan toward the end. For my personal taste, I add a little hot sauce and ketchup to taste when eating. Cook this meal and enjoy!!!!

We loved this recipe.  It was nice to have for a change instead of making it from the prepackaged stuff.  It did make quite a bit however so there were plenty of leftovers that went to waste.

I would give it 5 stars based on the aroma alone!  I had to feed a lot of people and didn't have enough kidney beans to triple the recipe, so I mixed in 1 lb. black beans with 1 lb small kidney beans and 1 lb large kidney beans.  Also, had to use turkey sausage (doctors' orders...).  With these changes, this recipe is a 5.  Without them it would probably be a 7!  Thank you, Miami!

Really good!  This recipe is the real deal.  I did add a 1/4 can of tomato paste and 5 beef bullion cubes just to make the broth a little richer.  It is a great recipe. Thank you!

This was a great recipe. I have just introduced red beans and rice to my family. A great source of iron without the loads of saturated fat. I like the use of all the vegetables. Everyone ate this meal even my little kiddos.

This was outstanding!  It was pretty mild, so if you like spicy, I'd recommend increasing the spice.  But, we loved it!

This was good for a nice change of pace, I was craving something like this. I must have not put enough water in or just took the 'simmer for 2 1/2 hours' to heart and didn't really look at it, but in just under two hours I burned the bottom layer of beans and all the water was gone. So as an advisory I would check on it after an hour and every half hour after that just in case. Also I just threw approximate amounts of the spices in and in my case it could have used a little more kick. I absolutely agree with one reviewer that it needs salt. Over all a good recipe and I will probably make it again.

This is the best! Have always had red beans and rice growing up, and this being my first time to make it, you would think I had been cooking it for years! I followed the seasonings exactly, but I did omit the celery. I also chose not to use ham hock or ground meat, instead used smoked sausage. Just a tip if you don't have all night to soak and want to have it sooner, I got this idea from another recipe: Cover your dried beans with about 2 inches of water. Boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let them soak for an hour. After doing this just follow the recipe as stated. Will do it the exact same way the next time, just when it gets closer to being done I may add a little water, the finished product didn't have much sauce, but still not complaining. Lots of flavor, too easy to make, and great on the budget! Quit looking for another recipe, cook this one tonight!

Loved this... I cater a party of 75 people and they just loved it. Spices were perfect. I used Rogerwood Sausage instead. My say what a wonderful Mardi Gras party I catered.

This recipe was delicious, and very flavorful!  I made a few adjustments after reading the comments.  I used chicken broth instead of water, I doubled the cayenne, used Oregano in place of Sage, tripled the Cajun seasoning, and added some Bourbon St. Seasoning in addition.  My husband and I really enjoyed this, thank you!

It is a sense of pride that you receive when making a dish from without the aide of a "box". This recipe turned out wonderful. I made a few changes, as do we all... I did the quick soak method (bring water to a roaring boil, add beans & boil 2-3 minutes, remove from heat & let sit, covered, for at least an hour). Then, reducing half the oil, cooked the veggies, and left out the celery, and saved the water the beans were in. NOTE: Dumping out the "bean" water will reduce gas, but will reduce nutritional value! Therefor, I saved the water, added a little more to get needed amount & added bouillon cubes to make broth. I don't use Cajun seasoning but threw in about 1/2 teas. chili powder,dash of cayenne, crushed red pepper, garlic, black pepper, and a pinch of salt. **Check your beans at 1 1/2 hours, then every 20 minutes after that. TaDa ps-i used mild italian sausage for the meat

OKAY I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I MADE A COUPLE OF CHANGES. FIRST, I COOK MY VEGTABLES. THEN REMOVE THEM FROM THE PAN. THEN I BROWN MY SAUSAGE. I USE NETTLES OR ANY SPICE SAUSAGE. THEN I POUR A BOX OF CHICKEN STOCK ON SAUSAGE. ADD VEGGIES BACK. ADD SEASONINGS, ALITTLE MORE CAJUN SEASONING THAN SUGGESTED. AND I SUBSTITUTE BAY LEAVES FOR 1 TEASPOON GROUND BAY LEAVES. THEN I USE 3 CANS KIDNEY BEANS. SEPERATE 1 CUP OF BEANS SET ASIDE. ADD REST OF BEANS TO SAUSAGE MIX. THEN LET SIMMER FOR 30 MINUTES. OKAY NOW I CRUSH THE CUP OF BEANS WITH A LITTLE MILK AND ADD TO MIX FOR THICKENING. I ALSO MIX 1 AND HALF TBL FLOUR TO HALF CUP MILK AND THEN POUR THAT IN THERE MAKES IT THICKER. I KNOW THIS SEEMS LIKE ALOT BUT WITH THESES CHANGES THIS RECIPE GOES FROM HOURS TO ABOUT 40 MINUTES

I love this recipe!  When my pocket book cannot afford jambalaya this certainly hits the spot.  I did make a couple of minor changes.  Instead of all the spices I use the "Creole Seasoning Blend" recipe that is on this site, added a 28oz can of whole tomatoes and as others have mentioned some salt.  The andouille sausage is the heart and soul of this dish.  I use Aidells with great sucess.  I followed a suggestion made by another review to make it less soupy... smash or break up some of the beans on the side of the pot.  Yum!

Yum, yum these were all that! I pretty much followed the recipe except I didn't measure water or spice. I added chicken bouilon as many other suggested and I didn't have chicken broth.  Great recipe you can do a lot with!.

These were very good.  I actually parboiled my red beans for 1 hour on the stove, then drained them and followed the recipe and put everything (except the sausage) in the crockpot and turned to low.  I started the beans at 7:00pm and cooked all thru the night and then in the morning I browned the sausage to bring out the flavors and juices and added it to the beans and left for work.  I came home at noon and they were perfect!!!   Love this recipe.

I've tasted many versions of red beans & rice but the dish was never anything special to me.  Being one of my boyfriend's favorite meals, I searched & searched for a recipe to use for my first go at making it myself.  I have to say that it was delicious!!  There was so much flavor.  I did double the cayanne pepper, added a diced jalapeno & used Johnsonville hot links because we like the bite! :)  Thank you for not only a great recipe, but for adding a new staple to my menu!

We love this recipe! Instead of the individual herbs, we just use 3-4 tbsps of the Creole Seasoning Blend (found on this site), and we're forced to use kielbasa due to inavailability of andouille. We add about 3-4 packages of chicken bouillon to the water, and add a large can of stewed tomatoes with liquid. We make it in the morning and add the cooked rice to the pot once all the simmering time is over, then let it sit for a few hours (LET IT SIT - it gets better as time passes). The rice absorbs the excess liquid and it ends up a wonderful mixture of flavors. This is an awesome recipe that tastes great, makes a lot, freezes well, and can be easily modified for individual tastes (even my picky 3-year-old loves it, as long as we remove the red beans from his portion). We serve it with fresh cornbread.

I don't know if it is fair to give this four stars without using the andouille sausage, but since so many people review this without using it I thouht I would rate it accordingly. The sausage will change the flavor of your dish! I had a nice spicy, great tasting bean mixture until I added my eckrich smoked, it became mild and a tad salty. Maybe the reason for the omission of salt in the recipe?  It was good after adjusting the flavor I used Tony's creole seasoning. Everyone liked it. My advice is note the sausage!

I have use this recipe the last three times I have cooked red beans and there's never any wasted. before trying this recipe I'd always throw leftovers out after being in the fridge untouched for a week. since using this recipe..I am no longer the only bean lover in the house. I prefer a little more pepper but rest of family cannt tolerate spicy food and we are watching salt intake..so this recipe is just perfect for us.

Everybody seemed to enjoy this, including four kids.  Good flavors, though it really needs salt.  (I can't understand why the recipe was published w/o salt or pepper.  I added 2 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp of pepper.  Conservative amounts for both.)  A tbsp. of sherry cooking wine seemed to help, too.

I used Trader Joe's fully cooked andouille sausage.  The recipe doesn't specify cooked or uncooked.  Personally, I'd be uncomfortable adding uncooked pork sausage for 30 min. while on a low simmer.  If using uncooked sausage, I'd consider either pre-cooking (e.g., parboil) or adding to the pot for a longer period of time.

My hubby liked it but then he is American, I am Australian and found it a little different but I will give it a 5 anyway because he liked it. We don't have that sausage here and I used Charito.  Hubby tried it and said put salt in and I did and it tasted better we also added some pepper.  I cooked it with out the lid and it seemed to go faster.  Also if you are like me and thought you would use a can of kidney beans and then at 2.30 in the afternoon realise hubby at them last night with the left over pasta sauce ???  I had a bag of dried one I brought for this one, i just put 2 cups of water per 1 cup of beans and boiled then simmered for 45 mins perfect.
Thanks
Will make it again.

I cooked this for a potluck at work and most thought it was really good. I've recieved 2 requests to cook it for them for a couple special events than plan to have.  I loved it and just added a bit more cajun seasoning and a bit more cayenne pepper.  The andouille sausage set it off perfectly.

I've cooked several Beans & Rice recipes over the years (usually off the cuff) and am still experimenting...  I skipped on the Andouille sausage (I was't the one shopping) and wound up with the store brand "Mild Pork Sausage" in a 16oz tube...  Fair enough; beggars can't be choosers.  I followed the recipe totally except for the meat, I added salt, and the cooking time... more like 2 hours. Oh, instead of Cajun Seasoning, which I lack, I added a bit more Cayenne (never hurts), Black Pepper, and a Garlic & Herb blend...  At first this dish tasted kinda bland but the more I ate and the more the heat set in, the better it got...  I'll use this recipe as a base in the future and maybe tweak it some more.

This was good. I did it in the crock pot, and added a ham hock and some ancho chiles for some spice.  I didn't eat the rice or add the sausage.  Except for needing some salt, this was a really good flavor and hit the spot!

Followed recipe except sautéed the andouille to get some fat from it instead of all the oil and added more Tony’s Cajun seasoning, plus about a tsp of salt. Mine was done in about 2 hours though but it could be contributed to the pot I used since it retains a lot of heat and that I have a gas stove. Tastes delicious!

This is a savory recipe.  That means it needs to be tasted during the cooking process and tweaked to taste.  Add something if necessary.  When I read "I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted terrible," it tells me they never tasted it along the way.

Great recipe, but it was pretty bland without salt which seems to be the trend. I added about 1-2 tsp, not sure of the amount since I didn't measure and just added until it tasted right.

Followed the recipe to a T except I made it a little easier and faster.  I cooked my vegetables is a dutch oven then used the same oven for the beans.  Instead of 1# Dry beans soaked overnight... I used four cans of S&W canned Kidney Beans with liquid. Rinsed each can with about 1/4 cup water, poured rinse into pot... then cut the straight water to five cups.  Brought all to a boil the simmered for 3 hours with the sausage in the last half hour.  They were as good as any we've had in the best cajun/creole restaurants in New Orleans.  My wife agreed... so it must be true.  Oh yeh... you've got to serve it with Crystal Hot Sauce.

No one from Louisiana would ever used steamed rice for their recipes.  You may come close to authentic but I would not call this authentic. We boil our rice 1 cup rice and 4 or More cups water, then strain and rinse (cleanse and was excess starches off,.  The reason for this is simple. STEAMED RICE DRINKS UP ALL YOUR JUICE IN ANY RECIPE YOU COOK.  ??.

I love recipe. Two things I did different. 1) Authentic or not... smoked ham shank is added to the water at the start. The smokey flavor is excellent and a welcome addition to having only andouille. 2) I made my own cajun seasoning blend... to easy and now I don't have a jar of blend that I may or may not use.
Make this recipe! Very very good!

Two cups of rice for a pound of sausage and a pound of beans?  I like a higher ratio of beans & sausage. Also, 8 servings? Is this a side dish, because I make it as a main dish. 
I read some comments with people stating they put this is in a crock pot/slow cooker. Please never do that with red/kidney beans unless you've properly cooked them first . . . unless you are using Blue Runner from a can, which in all honesty, tastes better.  Anyway, with raw beans, it doesn't matter how long you've cooked them if they never reached proper temperature.  Don't eat a raw potato.  Don't mix bleach and ammonia.  Don't put raw kidney beans in a slow cooker.

Andouille is fine, but it's more expensive, much fattier, and more coarsely ground than smoked sausage.  I tend to just get Manda, Richard's, or Rouse's smoked sausage.  Andouille has big ole chunks of solid fat and isn't for everyone.  I tend to use it sparingly, and may use a little with red beans, but I'm going to cut up a couple ropes of smoked sausage and cook them until they're caramelized before adding them to the beans.  I cook it as a hearty dinner, and I cook it often . . . like once a week often.  Andouille isn't very practical or healthy as the primary meat in the dish.  Also, there's no need for a splash of vinegar if you use Louisiana brand hot sauce instead of Tabasco.  I add some in while cooking and then some more for my own bowl afterward.

I made this recipe as is, no changes. I rate this a 2 star because of the complexity of the recipe and the results were not worth the time in my opinion. Mine came out looking exactly as pictured and I was super excited to put it in my mouth. The results were disappointing to me, my husband and my two sons. Spiciness of the sausage aside, the bean mixture was way too bland. We added salt and it still didn't taste great to us. Now on the personal side, all four of us rated this a 0 star because we didn't realize just how spicy andouille  sausage is. We've heard of it but never ate it and none of us are spicy food lovers so why I tried this recipe, I don't know. Probably because it just looked so darn good in the picture. None of us ate more than a couple of bites. If you're a spicy food lover then this recipe might be one of your favorite all-time recipes with a few tweaks for the blandness. When I try a new recipe, we all decide whether it's a keeper or not. This is not. So 0 stars for us and 1 star for the recipe itself. As one reviewer hit it exactly on the head, "it had heat but no flavor". And as another reviewer said, "it looked like slop". But because I hate to throw any food away, I put it in the fridge in hopes that someone would eat it but nobody did. It ultimately went into the trash anyway.

For me this turned out watery.  I should have reduced the oil, suated the sausage at the beginning, instead fo 6 cups of water, use 4 cups of broth.  I had to cook the rice longer than the recipe called for.  

Basically didn't like this recipe.

I'm from Louisiana and I've made this recipe quite a few times. The only thing different I do is add 4 to 5 chicken bouillon cubes, I sautee the sausage before adding it and the fat to it, amd I always add Louisiana hot sauce at the end. It always comes out delicious, and my husband loves it!

Great - Start with dried kidneys and take it slow and steady. Added Conecuh (Alabama) cajun sausage at the end (I pan-fried it first) and let it simmer.  I got a love slap - and a toast - from my real Southern friends.   Don't cheat with canned beans or cheap sausage. Delicious if done right.

This was delicious and I added a 3lb of sausage to my mix as I like A LOT of sausage. I also added 1/2 tsp. of salt as recommended by other posters. This turned out to be the best tasting red beans and rice that I’ve ever tasted. My whole family loved it.

I'm from NOLA as well. First thing is do NOT add rice to the pot. It is served on top of rice. If you add the rice to it the rice will just over cook and you have a big gloppy mess, especially if you reheat the next day. Some might want 80% beans and 20% rice or vice versa. I just made Italian wedding soup and the same rule applies. Don't add pasta to the soup, add pasta or rice in the serving bowl. If you're going to eat it all right away I guess it would be OK, but don't cook it any more once the rice is added.  If I'm making Jamaican rice and peas, that's different, you cook it all together in 20 minutes and its more like dry fried rice with no gravy. Crackling cornbread goes well with this. I add ham base and chicken base to the water to make a stock, after I have cooked the beans till tender, dump out the water and add the stock back in to finish cooking. Sprinkle of green onions, chives or fine diced white onions on top at serving.

I made this for myself and was just sitting down to eat it when a friend asked if I could pick him up from work. Thought I'd be nice and fixed a container for him. Later that night he sent me a text saying, "Awesome beans and rice!" To which I responded, "Glad you liked it." He then replied, "Didn't like it, I LOVED IT!!" So I'll most definitely be fixing this again soon!

Most cooks in the Lafayette, La. area mash about a third of the beans when they get soft and stir them well so they sort of make it a thick gravy for the beans.  Always keep a bottle of hot sauce on the table.

This was very good. Hubby said its the best he has ever had!  I did not use thyme. Doubled the cajun seasoning and threw in a smoked turkey wing.  Also used small red beans soaked overnight.  Simmered about 2 hours with lid on then another 45 min with lid off.

In a Cajun kitchen you'll always find something a cookin!
You can be assured the Cajun trinity is part of almost every dish!  I have eaten, loved and cooked Cajun food since I could reach the stovetop and hold a wooden spoon (66 years more or less). One of the first dishes I learned to cook was red beans and rice! This receipt is as close to authenticity you can get unless great grandma made them over a wood fire in a big cast iron pot. Delicious, rich with that just right smokiness from the andoulli and a generous pinch of cayenne!  I've made it, eaten it, served it to friends and family. They always go back for more.

I learned red beans and rice from a cook at the Hummingbird Grill ( a truly legendary dive in New Orleans).  I actually would rate this dish as 4 ½ stars because of the lack of a meaty ham hock and not specifying Camelia kidney beans.  I would also forego the oil and use the fat rendered from the andouille sausage to sauté the vegetables.  The ham hock adds flavor and Camelia beans add a distinctively  New Orlerans feel and taste.  Yes, you can tell the difference!  Good any day of the week but N.O. tradition says Monday night;s dinner, Monday being the customary old wash day.

I presently live in Abbeville, LA, grew up in Baton Rouge, then lived in New Orleans.  There is no right (authentic) way to make red beans and rice,  as long as you stick to the basics.  Different people have different preferred tastes.  Some like it with sausage, some with ham, some with salt meat, some with pickled pork.  This recipe is a good, basic recipe for anyone who wants to make some good red beans and rice.  Don't forget the cornbread!  Thanks for sharing!  :)

The cook times were accurate, but seasonings extremely bland. It took quite a bit of doctoring and adding of other seasonings not mentioned such as salt, pepper, etc.

I can't speak on how authentic it is but it sure is a spicy, savory, stick-to-your-bones, can't-wait-for-left-overs kinda dish. This might upset my Cajun Purist friends but I added a few drops of LA Hot Sauce & sprinkled some green onion for plate dressing & a dollop of sour cream because... sour cream. ;b
P.S. Also dropped a few shrimp in the pot  & let cook for the last 5 minutes until pink. Would have preferred crawfish but I couldn't get my hands on any at the time.

I modified the recipe to non-spicy for kids by omitting the cayenne and using sweet italian sausage and made in the crock pot. It was creamy and the sausage added a lot of flavor. I thought there was too much extra broth for cooking with a lid on so I'd try just 5 cups of water next time. I had to double the cajun seasoning and add 2 tsp of salt.

This is more of a once in a while dish, and its good for potlucks. I served it with a side of garlic bread.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was a little bland. Not sure what spice I'd add to pep it up, but it needs just a little something. Other than that, I thought it was great.

I'm from New Orleans.  This recipe has a good base of flavorful ingredients, but this recipe and most of the other "red beans and rice" recipes here are missing a major ingredient. 
SALT!!!  This is why reviewers are calling it "Bland".
I followed this recipe and it was in desperate need of salt.  I could tell after only 30 minutes of cooking.  I used 2 teaspoons of kosher salt (not as strong as regular table salt).  Some people may like a little more.
Please, if you really want TRUE NEW ORLEANS RED BEANS AND RICE, add SALT!
You should keep your pot covered during cooking and stir every 20 minutes. Smash some of the beans against the pot with the back of your spoon to make a rich creamy texture.  Cook on almost medium heat or a touch lower than medium for almost 3 hours.
Have to add that I get the biggest kick reading recipe reviews from people who have changed the recipe completely!  LOL
I see someone didn't even put sausage in their beans!  Sheesh!

This is so good. I leave out the celery because some members of my family don't like it. I add some sort of hot pepper to it when cooking up the veggies. I use jasmine rice to give it a special touch.  I am so excited I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is great but if you are pressed on time use 1 can 16 oz kidney beans. Boiled with 2 cups of water instead of 6 cups. turned out delicious! Served it with French bread.

I adapted this recipe to the pressure cooker, and everyone that has tasted it loves it.  Me included. I spent my summers in east Texas when I was young and red beans and rice was a staple at grandmas' house.  This is just like I remember it.  I live in the northwest now and I don't have any trouble finding Andouilli sausage around here, so that's what I use. I prepare it according to this recipe but I only have to cook it 20 mins in the pressure cooker.  I release the steam quickly and add the sausage and bring it back to pressure for another 10 min.  I then remove it from the cooker and cook the rice in the pressure cooker too.  When the rice is done, instead of serving over the rice, I mix the rice right into the red beans.  It couldn't be better!

Meh.. Not the worst, but not the best I've had either. Since it has good bones, I gave it 3 stars. I too found it lacking flavor, and greasy. But I suspect that could have been the brand of sausage I used so I won't hold that against the recipe. Will try cooking beans with hocks, jowls or at least pickled pork. Next time instead of using water to cook the beans I will use stock, and saute' vegetables in bacon fat, and a different brand of sausage. Maybe some Jasmine rice too. Good red beans and rice are out there. I've had them.I just need to keep looking.

I love red beans and rice.  This was my first time making it.  I used 8ounce trinity mix instead of cutting up the vegetables.  I bought it at a nearby grocer.  I also used 32 ounces of vegetble broth with one cup of water.  I reduced the water by a cup as suggested by others.  I may reduce it by a cup and a half next time. I used chicken sausage for the sausage.  This was a very tasty dish.  I used a teaspoon of cayenne pepper because I wanted it hotter.  I'm very pleased with the dish.

Maybe my expectation was different.  I was looking for more thick consistancy (like Popeye's beans and rice)  I followed the recipe and cooked with lid on.  It was too soupy for my liking and little flavor less.  I drained about 16 oz water while it was still cooking, add 2 cans of red beans.  Then I mashed the beans/veggies, add a lot more of cajun seasoning.  After these changes, it tasted pretty good!

As written I give this 4 stars. I stuck very closely to the recipe, but made a few modifications. I added about 4 extra ounces of sausage and another tsp. of cajun seasoning. After about 1 hour I tasted the sauce and it really needed salt so I added 1 Tbsp. You could probably get away with 2 teaspoons, but the recipe definitely needed salt to enhance the other spices. Only cooked for 2 1/2 hours as beans were fairly done after 2. Very tasty. Will certainly make again.

Had to add salt and left out the celery. Word of caution on the Andouille sausage if you have those that don't like spicy food - cook the sausage first and rinse it off to remove some of the heal from it.

The favors are spot on yummy, but I used cheater (canned) beans, reduced cooking time to a little over an hour.  Everything else was the same and yummy.  Might cut back a smidge on the cayenne as it will be even hotter tomorrow!

I really enjoyed this but I gave it 4stars instead of 5 because of two things. It needs salt which was not indicated in the recipe. Also simmering it for 2.5 hours evaporated all the juice and I had to add a cup of broth to make is less pasty. I think I will cover it for part of the time when I make this again...which I will. It really was delicious once I added some salt and broth.

We cut back on the hot spices a bit as the sausage is also spicy.  I like to add some ham to my red beans and rice, and I cut the sausage into smaller pieces.

Absolutely amazing! Everyone went back for seconds and there was enough for leftovers which did not last long.  Based on other recommendations, I doubled the Cajun spice (Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning)and added a few splashes of Tabasco after I added the andouille.  It had plenty of kick, but not so much that the kids wouldn't eat it.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent, authentic Louisiana flavor. I left out the sage because I'm not a fan of it. I added a little cumin, seasoned salt, pepper, and worcestershire for extra flavor. Also I just used a smoked pork and beef sausage because the store didn't have andouille. It was delicious, and I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe is so good.  I found that it didn't need to simmer the full 2.5 hours, mine was done simmering in just under 2 hours.  The flavor was so rich that my wife said she would enjoy it equally without the sausage (makes it healthy).  Anyway, this is a very good recipe for people who enjoy flavorful food.

I'm from Louisiana ,and I have to say this is a very good recipe. The only thing I did different was to soak the beans over night. This will cut down on cooking time and make it a creamy consistency ( if cooked longer ) I also added a chicken stock ( bought over the counter by Knorr ) for added flavor .

I use canned beans and can reduce the cook time to 40 minutes. Also I use 1 and 1/4 cup of rice and add right after saute onions n peppers. No celery needed. Brown sausage separate n drain grease then add.10 mins before done I add 1 can diced or 2 to 3 fresh sliced maters. Add cilantro for a topper. Enjoy!!! Thats what I love about cooking. There's no wrong way :)

I have made this twice with kielbasa and couldn't stop eating it. Can't wait to order some real andouille from Jacob's or whoever. My only change is the rice: I prefer brown. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe with absolute punctilio. My mouth is watering just writing about it. Seriously--it's like candy.

This rocks.  I am sensitive to heat so I cut back cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon and also cook beans with chicken or beef broth instead of water to add flavor.  Garnish with green onion, sharp cheddar and corn bread muffins.

I really really want to say I liked this, but there was no salt in the recipe. Really? For that reason, I don't know what to say. Once we added a bunch of salt and a lot more Cajun seasoning, it was pretty good. Probably not something I'll make again, because it just doesn't taste like much, and we couldn't tell what it was missing.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I was dissapointed in the lack of flavor.  There is something big missing here.  I even used homemade cajun seasoning from a recipe on this site.  I wish I knew how to get some flavor into this recipe.  It surprised me as there was a ton of seasonings in the recipe.  I'm open to anyones suggestion.

SO good.  I added a splash of apple cider vinegar to the pot, and served it with lots of vinegary hot sauce.  The only thing I wish I did was find authentic andouille sausage.  I used a chicken andouille, and it just wasn't quite the right texture.  Oh well, that means I have to make it again ;)

I made this around Christmas of 2011.  Not really sure how to rate it.  The reason I say this is because I am pretty sure the main reason that I didn't care for it at all is because of the sausage.  I had never cooked with this type of sausage and I will never cook with it again.  People that like this sausage will probably love this recipe.

This was delicious. The recipe was easy, we had everything in the house already except for the andouille, and the taste was incredible. We used black beans instead of red beans, and we left out some cayenne since we have a 3 year old at our table. 

Since we don't have Cajun seasoning, I followed the advice of another reviewer and went to the simple Cajun Seasoning recipe on this site. Instead of making a batch, I just used 1/4 t each of black pepper, paprika, oregano, and 1/2 t of salt (would've included 1/4 t of cayenne if we wanted more heat); it turned out great! The flavor was rich, the spices balanced and not too salty.  Also, the consistency was great and ate well over rice. 

Will add this to our rotation for sure.

Great recipe!  I cut back on the vegetables a bit as it started to look like vegetable soup. DON'T DO IT! The vegies cooked down nicely. Next time I will make it as written but double the Cajun seasonings and use Tabasco to taste to make it perfect as I like it spicey.

I've never made red beans and rice before so I followed this recipe to a T.  I took some other reviewers advice and smashed the beans on the side of the pot with a spoon.  Unfortunately this recipe just wasn't something I like.  Too hearty for me.

Pretty decent recipe and authentic. Too much water used (in my opinion). I like thicker beans. I also think there wasn't enough seasoning used for this recipe. I added approximately 2 tablespoons of my own made cajun seasoning instead of the what the recipe called for. I actually don't use measuring cups/spoons that often for creole cooking... you really just have to feel your way through sometimes.

Awesome!  Even my picky kids enjoyed this meal.  I mashed about half the beans at the end to make it thicker in consistency.  I also served Cajun seasoning so that those of us who wanted it spicier could add it.

My family usually does not like sausage, white rice or kidney beans and everyone loved this. I increased the amount of sausage, celery and cajun seasoning. I even used butterball turkey smoked sausage the second time around because It was all the store had and everyone still liked it. This is a keeper.

Paid $4.50 for a pound of andouille sausage. It was nothing special. No better than smoked sausage. It was good but not earth shatteringly amazing... Might make again but not a top recipe.

I gave this  3 stars because, the beans were over cooked & it was too bland, for me.  If I make it again, I'll make changes to suit my taste.

Extremely filling and very tasty.  Left out the celery b/c I didn't have any and it wasn't lacking in flavor.

So I've tried red beans and rice before and never liked it, well I've changed my mind. Looks like the recipes I've tried never had enough flavor, this one is a hit! I followed the exact recipe and just added salt to taste at the end and it was soooo good. Will do this again and again...

I have been making this recipe for years now, which I found here, and it has become a family favorite!  Our kids request it at every family event. I pretty much follow this recipe exactly and only adjust the spice level depending on who will be eating it.  Making it again tonight, for tomorrow.

Love this!  I'm originally from New Orleans and grew up eating this kind of food for breakfast.  That being said, this is the best red beans and rice recipe I've ever come across.  I substituted nothing and loved every bit of it.

Awesome recipe!  Thank you so much for posting.  I've been down to New Orleans about 10 times in my life and I'd say these are very close to the ones I've had down there.

Yum! This recipe is delicious! I decreased the amount of olive oil. I used just enough to nicely coat the bottom of my pan. I also increased the amount of cajun seasoning to 1 tablespoon. We have andouille sausage here in north Florida. It adds a nice flavor to the beans, so use it if you can find it. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!

Being from the deep south, I can tell you that this is as authentic as it gets!  Love it!  However, it is very spicy, probably too hot for most people.  My husband could barely eat it but thought the flavor was great!  I think I will cut back on the cayenne pepper next time.  I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and Hillshire Farms Smoked Beef Sausage instead of andouille sausage.  As always, it is even better the next day so if you can, make it the night before and then just heat when needed.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I made this dish for a group of college-age kids and it was a hit. The only thing I changed was to add an extra tsp of Cajun seasoning...then served it with hot sauce. I will definitely make this again.

Always wondered how red beans and rice tasted like so I made this, but without a few key ingredients. I didn't have the andouille, so I put in normal chicken sausages with half-cube of chicken bullion. No cajun, but added in the oregano, salt, chili powder and black pepper which is basically the same thing. No cayenne pepper so added extra chili pepper (hot!).

My husband and I really enjoyed this!  I didn't have the andouille sausage (couldn't find it) so I just used turkey smoked sausage, and I omitted the cayenne because my hubby doesn't like really spicy foods.  Overall, I will definitely make this again!

I decided to take a short cut and use canned beans; in hindsight I should have used the dry ones and made this on a weekend. But I was excited to use my homemade Cajun seasoning and the andouille, I had just purchased. I omitted the cayenne as there was cayenne in the seasoning. I didn't think I could take all the heat, but I served it with Tabasco...just in case my husband thought it was too meek. We both really enjoyed it and as I made the whole recipe...we had enough to feed an army. Next time I may half it and use a bit less sausage. Thank you Miami Beach for sharing, it did taste truly authentic!

I was very excited to make this recipe considering all the great reviews. I used Andouille sausage as suggested, but I really don't think it added much to the flavor. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. Just don't buy something cheap like Hillshire Farms sausage. Overall we thought the dish was missing something- a seasoning perhaps, but we could not pinpoint it. I'm probably will not make this again.

This tastes just like the red beans & rice I've had in New Orleans restaurants.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect.  I did take about 2 cups of the beans out after they were soft and mashed them and put them back in, as I like a more creamy consistency, and it turned out very nice.  Added several drops of Lousiana Hot Sauce on top before eating.  Wonderful!  (We have a small catering business and this is the recipe we now use and people absolutely love it!)

I think this is a great recipe, I have made it multiple times and the only thing I did different was I decreased the cayenne because my kids thought it was a bit to spicy...also someone said to add salt (salt will stop the beans from getting soft, the author is correct in salting it at the end when the beans are already tender)...Overall this is a great recipe as is.

Absolutely must use the Andouille Sausage.  It imparts so much more flavor than a kielbasa sausage.  This was fantastic.  I was able to find andouille sausage at Albertson's up here near the Canadian border, so I'm guessing it isn't as uncommon as one would think, as you head north. Ask at the grocery store.  This was wonderful.  We didn't change a thing!

Excellent.  I lived in Louisiana for 3 years & became hooked on Blue Runner beans.  I never tried to make my own, but with all the fantastic reviews, I had to give it a try.  I used Chicken Andouille Sausage, as the regular stuff is impossible to find in MI.  I also mashed most of the beans in the last half hour of cooking.   It's nearly identical to what I remember.  Thank you for sharing this!

High praise from a Louisiana girl. This is a great recipe. I am looking forward to leftovers! I followed the recipe with the exception that I had to use dried celery, used 6 bay leaves and used two bell peppers because the ones I had were on the small side. The flavors are wonderful and it smelled so good simmering on the stove. I used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and between that and the andouille sausage did not have to add any salt (other than the little bit I always use making rice). Try it!!

Delicious and nice flavor.  I don't know what authentic red beans and rice are but enjoyed these for sure.  I did not have any green pepper and used smoked turkey sausage instead, otherwise followed the recipe.  Was great - probably better with the right sausage :) One tip do not adjust seasonings until all the water is cooked out of the beans so you do not over salt or over spice.

This was absolutely delicious and filling! I had to make a couple changes: I used canned, rinsed kidney beans. Right now bell peppers are just too expensive for me. Instead, I used jalapeno peppers (about 1 T- I'm guessing because I kinda just dumped some in). Also, I used Hickory Farms smoked sausage. I followed other users tip and smashed some of the Kidney beans to make it a bit gravyish. I did make it on a Monday :-) but I didn't do any laundry.

Such great flavor!  My husband said it's the best he's had and that is saying alot!  I used some left over smoked turkey (put a whole leg in then shredded meat off the bone after a few hours) so mine was a bit untraditional.  Would, of course, be awesome with the sausage as well.  I cooked mine in the crock pot and it took about 8 hours to get to the thickness that I like (I like it thick). I also mached the beans a little bit. I used chicken broth instead of water. Can't wait to try again!

My personal preference is that it is yummy with these changes: 5 bay leaves, 1 heaping tbsp cajun seasoning, add 1 tsp garlic powder and 4 tbsp salt. I'd also cut down the water to cook the beans to 5 1/2 cups. I used small red beans and my cooking time decreased a half hour.

I had to triple the Cajun spice, and I still think it needed more heat. But I don't think my andouille was the most flavorful kind I've ever had, either, so that might be part of it. I enjoyed this a lot and will play around with the spices to make it perfect for us. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!  My husband is from New Orleans and he is very, very, very happy with this recipe.  We had to put it in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours to get the beans soft.  And this is after we soaked them for 8 hours prior to cooking. Next time will just use the slow cooker.

These were really good, the only thing my husband said was that it reminded him of pinto beans(he's used to them out of the can), i however, can't complain, they were delicious.  I had to stop myself from going back for a 3rd bowl. Great as left overs too.  I served it with the buttermilk cornbread from this site.

Followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding salt, plus allowing it to cool in the fridge overnight and reheating the next day (to allow flavors to meld).  This was the worst dinner I have ever cooked.  It smelled good but looked like slop.  It was spicy enough to make my mouth itch, yet it had no actual flavor - absolutely horrible and not worth all of the time/effort put into it.

I have made this a few times and it is excellent every time! I've used different kinds of sausage (kielbasa, chicken) and I also add some shrimp too. Very good - even my preschooler loves it.

This is a really great red beans and rice recipe. I followed the directions and also followed the advice of others. I added 2 hamhocks and used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water when cooking the beans. I also made golden sweet corn bread and a peach pie (also from this site) and finally got to use my new rice cooker. Again thanks for a great recipe, my family loved it. Oh and don't forget to pick up a bottle of picka peppa sauce. When you add a few dashes to your bowl it really adds to the flavor.

I made this last night and let it simmer in the crock pot overnight.  Made it almost exactly as written except I had some frozen chicken broth (homemade) that I substituted instead of water and omitted the cayenne (personal preference).  DH and I both gave it a 5 star.  Only complaint was it was a bit "soupy" but that's ok - we loved it anyway.  It did look a lot like the picture posted!  I didn't have Andouille so I bought a spicy smoked sausage and it was wonderful.  This will become a staple for us!

I really enjoyed this.  I used about 1.5 T of olive oil, just to cut down on the fat.  I increased the garlic too.  I used 6 cups of chicken broth instead of water, and added about a 1 t. of oregano.  I also smashed some beans against the side of the pot like some reviewers suggested.  I can't get andouille sausage here, which is a shame because I love it, so I used some some spicy kielbasa.  Overall, great recipe.

I followed others' advice and doubled the cajun spice amount.  I couldn't find andouille sausage, so I got louisiana hot links, and the beans turned out way too spicy.  Our noses were running!  Next time I will double the cajun spice, but add a more mild sausage.  I also added 2 tsp. salt and it really needed this.  It would have been way too bland without salt.  We made burritos the next day with the beans and they were so good!  I might make this recipe again just to make burritos.

Great Recipe! I did take advice from others and half way through cooking the veggies and beans I added a few chicken bullion cubes. I also added dried red pepper, celery salt, and a dash of Jamaican seasoning for a added sensational flavor. I didn't used the sausage recommended, I just used smoked kielbasa! My husband loved it!! Thank you for a great recipe!

Very good recipe.  To add even more "authentic" southern flavor, I threw in a ham hock, and then shredded the meat from it and added it to the cooked beans.  Also, I always use dried "small red beans" rather than kidney beans, they cook faster and we enjoy the texture of them.  My southern-born spouse really enjoyed this dish!

This was extremely bland yet left our mouths on fire. After soaking the beans overnight, I cooked this in the crockpot on low for 7 1/2 hrs, then added 2 c chopped ham instead of sausage (should've added more) & cooked on high for another 1/2 hour. I think this would be better if bouillon was added to the water. All in all, I don't recommend this recipe.

I've been cooking for quite a while, but being from the Midwest, had never quite understood the appeal of red beans and rice until I tried this recipe!  Wow- it instantly went on my family's repeat list!  I did modify it slightly- I couldn't get andouille sausage, so I used a smoked polish sausage and added a hamhock.  I also altered the cooking time to adapt it to a slowcooker.  I cooked it ~5 hours on high (until the beans were starting to get nice and soft), then added the sausage, and cooked another hour. Yum!

Pretty tasty.  I am hoping it will be even more flavorful tomorrow or the day after.  I reduced the water/chicken stock to 5 cups but it still is too watery for my liking.  Next time I may just use 4 cups of chicken broth.  

I also added some extra cayenne pepper to give it an added kick.  

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Hopefully my husband will enjoy this served over brown rice and sweet cornbread.

Very good, but since I'm from Cajun country and had many a red beans and rice I will say that I've had better.  This was a little too liquidy.

Had to give this a 4 because I only soak & cook beans for making homemade soups. If you cheat & go the "easy" route, this is a 5 for sure. I used can kidney beans w/juice, inst rice, seasonings as stated & mix together before serving. I've moved this from a "side dish" to a entree to be served with corn/sweet corn bread or a salad.

This was FANTASTIC - even my bean-hating husband ate two bowls! I cooked it in my crock pot - didn't soak the beans or saute the vegetables, just rinsed the dry beans and combined everything (except rice) in the crock pot. I cooked them on high for about 4 hours and then bumped it down to low for another 3 hours or so, and left the lid off for about the last half hour so the broth could thicken a bit. The beans got quite tender this way, and the flavors all blended together nicely. Chopping the veggies in a food processor made them virtually disappear, which meant that my kids ate it without a fuss (because visible vegetables = blecch). Other minor changes - I used a full T. of cajun spice, and added a tsp. or salt. I'll be making this again soon!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I used all those same ingredients plus a couple extra. I used about 2 cups of chicken stock instead of water. I added a few dashes of Tabasco and Worchestire sauce. My boyfriend grew up on authentic Cajun cooking, and he says my red beans and rice are the best he's ever had. What a compliment! Thanks for the recipe!! I will be making this again and again for sure. :)

I really enjoyed this. It just needs more meat and more seasoning. I added a couple tablespoons of creole seasoning and some pepper. I didn't have any more sausage, but need time I will use 2 lbs.

Wonderful!

I changed things up a bit though, I cooked it with a  ham hock from the beginning and I put in the andouille.  I didn't follow any measurements for the seasoning because that wouldn't be authentic and I also added oregano.    To make the sauce thicker I smashed some of the beans up through out the cooking process and it came out extremely thick and creamy.  The andouille is a MUST for this recipe.  

This was extremely filling!  Also soaking the beans is also a must.

My husband, 5 year old and I really liked this!  However, take note to make sure you do use andouille sausage or you are going to miss out on an essential flavor enhancer to the dish.  The andouille I used was "raw" so I crumbled it and browned it with the vegetables in step 2, which also enhances the flavor in the beans as they cook.  Andouille has a lot of "kick", so you may want to try 1/4 tsp cayenne, simmer and taste before adding the full 1/2 tsp as Cajun seasoning has cayenne as well.  To give the dish more of a "hammy" pork taste (like Popeye's red beans and rice - the BEST!), I added 1 tablespoon of Penzey's Spices Ham soup base - made a wonderful flavor contribution!  All other ingredients I left the same as noted in the recipe; however, I let it simmer for close to 3-1/2 hours to ensure deep flavor.

I initially was going to give this the lowest nuber of stars possible, but I gave it two extra stars. One because I couldn't find the right sausage, and that makes a big difference according to the previous reviews. Another because my husband liked it, but that was after he used his arsenal of different spices on it. It took a lot of time to make. It cooked so long that the vegetables disappeared into the sludge from the beans. It didn't look anything like the picture. I followed the instructions exactly (except for the sausage) and I couldn't even eat it. I definately wouldn't make this again.

I am from Louisiana and never really cared for beans and rice , but this recipe was great , I followed the recipe to the tee except i added more beans and replaced half of the cajun sasuage with smoked sasuage to kick the fire back a notch ..
If you like red beans and rice this is probably the best recipe you will ever come across...

Wonderful!  I made it precisely as described, except that I substituted fresh herbs for the dried parsley and thyme.  Frankly, we ate this all Christmas weekend before even getting around to making the rice!  It's great as a soup/stew all on its own.  (I did make rice to accompany the leftovers when I took them to the office after the holiday.)

Great recipe! I make a double recipe and freeze in individual freezer bags.  Wonderful.  Then when you want red beans and rice you simply have to make the rice!  

Note:  I think salt was mistakenly omitted.  I add two teaspoons -- or to taste.  Love it!

Really enjoyed this and did take into account some reviews. I forgot to soak the beans so referencing americas test kitchen, I used 12 cups of water.  Then simmered it half covered for maybe 3 hours for the first simmer.  I did need to add 1 more cup of water (once the water reached the top of the beans), but that's all.  once I added the sausage, it was another 1/2 hour per recipe and great results.  also added before I simmered the first time was 2t. salt, 3/4 t. cayenne, and 2 t. cajun seasoning.

We just finished a late lunch using this recipe.  Very good.  We used a ham hock rather than the sausage.  This recipe does need a little salt, but it reminded me a lot of the red beans and rice we had in New Orleans last year.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice hot meal on a cold night.

I loved this! Husband didn't. I cooked the beans for several hours with a ham bone that had a lot of meat on it, and also added a couple of habenero peppers in with the onions...it was mighty spicy and I think just one would have done it. I had some trouble finding the sausage, but finally found a chicken version at Trader Joes. I'll make it again, just not when my husband is home.

I've made this recipe lots of times now.  Andouille is impossible to find around here, so I just use whatever I can find.  The amount of cajun seasoning I use varies with how spicy it is, and I agree that it needs a bit of salt.

The sauce was VERY thin...I expected a thicker sauce, and the beans to break down more. However, my family liked it. When I served leftovers I added cooked shrimp to it as well.

We are not southerners,  so can't speak to the authenticity,  but it was fun to make and delicious! We made this as part of a southern themed family night,  along with corn bread and a southern cucumber and tomato salad recipe I found.  We'll definitely make this again!

This recipe is great as is, but I make a few modifications. If you forget to soak the beans overnight, boil them in water for about 2 minutes and then let them rest for a half hour and drain, then continue with the recipe. I like to add 1 or 2 ham hocks to the beans while they're simmering. It gives it amazing flavor and the meat afterwards falls right off the bone and is delicious!! Also, while they're cooking, take your spoon every now and then and mash some of the beans against the side of the pot

I've made almost exactly like this for years letting it cook all day on low in a crockpot. One of my favorite dried bean recipes. 

But be warned about trying this in a crockpot! All flat and kidney beans have a toxin that can make a person sick. It can be neutralized by 180 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes such as with the quick soak method or on the stove. Most crockpot  aren't that hot. So if you do this in a crockpot, simmer beans for 10 - 15 on the stove, cover for 2 hours, drain, rinse and then put in the crockpot. It will need a little less water too. I'll do the quick soak at night, stick them in the fridge then get the crockpot started the next morning.

I'll saute the veggies, brown the sausage and just have everything in one container to start in the AM too.

I was born and raised in Louisiana and I have to say that this did not remind me of authentic Louisiana red beans and rice. It was very bland. I needed to add more cajun seasoning and more salt. I think there was also not enough sausage. :( These are all things that can be changed, but I think it needs some love to make it better.

I made this for the first time on Sunday, and it was delicious!  I used red beans and pretty much followed the recipe.  The only thing that I changed, based on reading several reviews, was to double the seasonings.  Everything was well-seasoned, flavorful, tender and just delicious.  I did add a link of smoke sausage in addition to the link of andouille sausage.  I will definitely be making this again on Sunday.  The time spent was well worth it.  The family raved about it!  Thanks for another great recipe!

Awesome recipe, tastes amazing. I made a few edits I used 4 cups of water instead of 6 and replaced Cajun seasoning with Old Bay. Then cooked the 2 cups of basmati rice in the pot with an addition 3 cups of water.

This is so good! Must make with chicken broth or something similar for the added flavor. I’ve made it once with broth and once with water since I didn’t have broth on hand. Broth is the way to go or your own bouillon cube concoction. Will make again!

This tested pretty similar to the red beans and rice I've had in New Orleans, although the spices were a bit milder than expected. I doubled-up on the cajun spice to rectify that. The cider vinegar really enhanced the flavor.

I made this in an Instant Pot (15 minutes with natural release) and reduced the liquid from six to four cups. That was still probably a cup more than necessary. Adding the sausage in for the entire cook didn't negatively impact the texture.

I browned the andouille sausage first and then the vegetables.  Instead of plain water, I used chicken broth for the beans.  Great recipe!  Only wish I could have found Camellia Red beans, but the generic store brand worked.

I made some changes based on other reviewers and personal preferences.  First I used about half the oil and added 3 cubes of beef bouillon to the water.  For the cajun seasoning I used 1/4 tsp each of paprika, dry mustard, white pepper and black pepper.  I simmered for 1 hour with the lid on then 1 hour with the lid off (because I wanted it to stay on the soupy side) and that was plenty of time.  I sauteed the sausage before adding to the beans because I love having a little char.  It turned out quite delicious but it was still a bit thicker than we care for so I think next time I will add extra water/bouillon and increase the seasonings 
accordingly.  I might even double the sausage next time as it is the best part!

Followed the instructions listed. It seem to be missing something. I'm definitely going to make it again, and add more salt and Cajun seasoning. Other than that, the texture was perfect!

Followed the recipe and this didn't turn out as good as I hoped. It wasn't bad, just not what I imagined. Didn't notice the green pepper at all and the spices need to be increased. I WILL be trying this again though and try to bring it up a notch.

This was amazing. I didn’t have time to soak the beans. So I used 4 cans kidney beans rinsed, then an additional can I placed in the food processor and then added it for a creamier texture. 
Also, I used 9 cups of water and placed a ham bone from the previous nights dinner in the pot from the start. I increased the Tonys to one full tablespoon as well. 
I cooked 3 hours, pulled meat off hambone, and added andouille sausage the last 20 minutes. 
This was a wonderful meal.

So yummy! Didn't add the sausage since my hubby doesn't like sausage so I made it on the side. I used pinto beans instead since they didn't have kidney at the store. Overall this was such a yummy recipe and liked that's it's low salt. Definitely gonna make this again! Thank you

This was okay. I made the recipe as written, and my son and I both thought it was bland and needed more flavor. If I make it again I would add salt and a little more cayenne pepper.

Very good. I'd recommend using a Dutch oven to cut down on prep time. Only took me an hour and a half to cook the dry beans.

Just be warned that your results can vary depending on your Andouille sausage which provides a significant flavor contribution to this dish.  Otherwise this recipe is middle of the road flavor wise for me.

Very tasty, but next time I'll cut back on the cayenne slightly. It's not super spicy - just a little too spicy for me. I added 2 teaspoons of chicken Better Than Bouillon with the water.

I don’t know if this is authentic as I’ve never been to New Orleans or that area. It was however delicious. As people have said this is a great base recipe that you can adjust to your specific tastes. I increased the cayenne pepper and Cajun seasoning. Not sure how much as I was adjusting as it cooked. I also added mrs. dash salt free extra spiced to  a nice kick. Next time I might add some habaneros. I didn’t have andouille sausage but. Had some leftover cal reindeer (I’m in alaska) hot sausage so I use that. I followed the cooking directions exactly and everything came out delicious. It’s actually the first time I’ve successfully cooked dried beans before. This is a great simple and budget friendly recipe.

I made a rue!  First the onion then the flour.  Then followed the recipe.  Also, I was making blacken chicken  to go with this dish.  I put some of the blacken seasoning in it.  The gravy and seasoning came out perfect!

Flavor was very nice as I tasted it but with six cups of water this was extremely watery, more like a soup. If you make this I'd recommend you start off with perhaps four cups of water and add if it's needed. I will try again but using much less water when cooking the beans.

This is one of the best recipes I ever made.  The only changes I made was that I lightly browned the andouille before adding it to the beans and i used chicken stock instead of water. Both changes give it a very rich flavor.

Great recipe!!!!!!! My fiancé is from Louisiana and was quite surprised to have something that “almost” tasted like home. Will definitely mess with the seasoning a bit more for fun in future. This is delicious! A new favorite! Thanks for sharing!!!

Nice recipe but a little bland for my taste buds, as is.  I had to spice it up quite a bit.

I make this all the time. Normally just sub canned bean to be able to make it quick (Under 30). Its my comfort food, I can never get enough.

Welcome to the taste of NOLA!
Spot on authentic. Made exactly as stated. After simmering 30 minutes, transfered to pressure cooker, and once pressure acheived, simmered for 15 minutes. Once pressure released, added sausauge and simmered 15 minutes. Next time I will just make it in the pressure cooker. Hubby ate two full servings and said I can make this anytime!

I cooked this all the time, my husband favorite. I used 2 packs of Conecuh hickory smoke sausage husband request because he likes more meat in it.

This has become a family favorite. I use dried red beans instead of kidney beans as we prefer the taste and texture. I usually add more cayenne as we like spice, and I don't add the sage as it's not something I usually have on hand. This recipe works great in my Instant Pot when I don't make it on the stove. Definitely a keeper!

This is my go to recipe for Red Beans and rice.   My kids don't like spicey foods so the only adjustment I make is to the Cheyenne pepper and this is still very good.   We just spice ours up individually with tabasco.   Love this with a splash of apple cider vinegar and cornbread.   So good!

This was a great option for feeding a large group.  It needs a bit more heat or salt, but all round it is a great dish.

So delicious! Made it exactly as presented. I only added a little more Cajun seasoning because we like spicier taste. Also, I added Tapatio hot sauce as condiment for extra spice!

I made this in the crockpot. It was delicious. I also substituted Polish Kilbasa for the Chorizo I already knew that I don't like Chorizo so the substitution for me was a very good one. I will make this again.

10/9/18:  This could use some additional salt.  I might try another meat next time to make this leaner.  Also, maybe add some okra.  This is filling and tasty enough.

Because my family prefer a more low fat diet, i substituted the sausage with trimmed and home ground pork loin and sausage. I then used a new orleans flavor rub or salt to marinade the grounded meat for about 2 hours ...... It worked well.

Wow! I’m so disappointed. We were in Florida and I had the best red beans and rice at the shrimp basket. Back home, I thought, I’ll try. I was excited to find this recipe. I followed it step by step. First taste was bland the bam, hot, I could not finish my bowl and will be throwing it out. I wanted to give it zero stars but was forced to give it one.

This recipe was pretty good, but I think it needs more Cajun seasoning (I used Cajun Spice Mix by DiamondLil from this site). Instead of dried beans I used canned kidney beans and Gilbert's Bourbon Chicken Sausage as that's what I had on hand (sausage is good, but a tad too sweet to use in this dish...stick to a good andouille or sub with a smoked sausage for sure). Flavor was still pretty good despite the ingredients I had to use. Overall, I'd add more Cajun seasoning as needed (and some salt if you're not using Tony Chachere's). Will try this recipe again for sure and closer to, if not as written. Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect and Very flavorful after some modifications. Up the Tony’s to 1 T, 1 tsp oregano, half tsp basil, 1 T Worchestire sauce, add 6 tsp. Chicken broth granuilles to water. Cook for 2 hours total.

Awesome recipe...I did add my touch to it. I used chicken broth in lieu of water... a little less thyme (personal preference), and threw in a tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning and some green onion. There is barely enough left for me to take to lunch tomorrow!!

This was great, but like someone else mentioned...you have to make every recipe your own. I wouldn’t put olive oil in my red beans...like ever. I sautéed chopped bacon in a large pot, then the sausage, then the veggies in all the fat, and then add the beans and water and seasonings. Summer for a long time till it looks right. I didn’t measure anything, just eyeballed it all.

This was the first time I followed a recipe to make beans. I am sorely disappointed with the results; with only  “heat” from the Cajun spice and cayenne pepper, the dish is quite flat and tasteless. It’s definitely lacking something that I can’t pinpoint.

I could not find the sausages that the recipe calls for, so I used spicy Italian sausages and followed the rest of recipe to the letter, I must say it was very delightful, I had visitors and they loved it too, even kids liked. It is a nice way to make beans that are not sweet!

This was amazing! I used fresh thyme and parsley rather than dried. I used half of the sausage and rendered it slightly with the vegetables, cooking it the whole time instead of adding it at the end.

This was absolutely delicious. Had just the right kick without being 5-alarm hot. I wanted a little more color in mine, so I added about 3/4 cup tomato paste. It was a great addition and made it sort of like a stew too. It was great with the rice but also alone! All the flavors and spices work really good together. I’m definitely making this again!

I don't know if it was something in the Cajun seasoning I bought to make these, but they tasted like they had Vicks Vapo-rub in them.  Ended up tossing the whole batch out.

I've never been a big fan of red beans and rice, but the hubby likes having it on New Year's Day so I tried this recipe--I am hooked!  He did mention he normally puts red wine in his so I added a cup of Merlot, included a ham hock during the long simmer, and used ground sage instead of dried so it ended up having a little stronger sage taste, but it was delicious.  We served this with the little cheddar biscuits from Jim n' Nick's BBQ and the sweetness in those helped offset some of the heat.  Obviously, reduce the cayenne pepper if you want them less spicy.  Will definitely make this again!

I've made this probably about eight times now and I do have a few tested tweaks: first, kidney beans have a toxin in them (phytohaemagglutinin) that doesn't come out just by soaking them.  You have to let them actively boil for ten minutes once you bring  the heat up, then you can turn it down to a simmer, otherwise that toxin won't break down.  Second, I use broth in place of water to add some more depth to the flavor.  I fry the sausage in the skillet before I do the vegetables, and just add enough olive oil to the drippings to get the right amount of fat.  Lastly, I caramelize the onions, which adds the perfect touch of sweetness to the recipe.  If you don't want to use the sausage, like I've done a few times, I'd suggest reducing the amount of broth by maybe a cup, otherwise it gets too soupy.  This is a fantastic meal, I'm going to be making this for years.

I made this tonight exactly as directed minus the bay leaves and it was wonderful.  Been having to eat the boxed mix up until now!!!  I also used canned kidney beans to make cooking time shorter. Not hot in the mouth but it sure has warmed me up!  Defiantly adding this one to my Iowa  "winter" menu :)

This is a really good recipe.  The only change I made was double the Cajun seasoning. I also put everything in the crockpot except the sausage and cooked for 6 hours. An hour before serving I put the sausage in. Very tasty. I will make this again.

My husband loves cajun food and this was no exception.  It wasn't quite spicy enough for us. Next time I will increase the cayenne and cajun seasonings. I think I will look for a better quality sausage as well. It definitely needed salt and pepper.  I'm sure this recipe will be making regular appearances on our dinner table. Thank you for sharing it.

I made this exact to the recipe. At first I wondered where all the liquid was going to go, but then after an hour and a half I had to turn off the gob because it looked like a cross between dog food and slop. All the liquid had cooked down and reduced. This was spicy (great!) but bland. I won't be making this again.

Not my favourite meal. It took a long time to make to my boyfriend. There wasn't a lot of sauce/juice. The only real taste of this meal was the sausages. It wasn't bad, but I had more expectations.

My husband loved it but it's a little too spicy for me.  I will make this again because my husband thought it was "pretty  darn good".  I will cut the cayenne and Cajun spice in half next time.  He can add more to his liking.  Loved the andouille, just brought the whole thing together.

The spices where good but found the recipe is lacking.   A bit of salt and a couple good dashes of Franks hot sauce improved it greatly.  If I make it again I think I would add Franks hot sauce to the batch

I've made this a few times. Several times on the stove top and once in the slow cooker (stove top turned out best, by the way, but the slow cooker turned out ok, as well). The first time I made it, I made it as written (the ONLY exception was that I sauteed the onions, celery, and pepper in butter instead of oil). It was too spicy for one of my children, but just right for the rest of us. I toned down the red cayenne pepper the next time, and those who wanted more spice were able to add hot sauce to their individual bowls. Once, I was out of cayenne pepper and subbed a pinch of red pepper flakes instead, which resulted in almost identical results. It's a good base recipe that allows people to do something a little different each time and still have a good end result (switching out cooking oil for butter, or adding more beans to stretch it out, or toning down or bringing up the spice, or thickening/thinning the sauce/broth based on personal preference - I like it a bit ticker). I do smash about half of the beans with a thick wooden spoon once they're soft enough, but that is personal preference.

Edited to add: I cannot eat pork, so I use precooked chicken or turkey andouille sausage when I can find it. When it's not available, I either make this a vegetarian dish or add shredded chicken.

My husband and I really enjoyed this, and are still enjoying this!! It makes quite a bit of food. I am definitely making this again but with more spice and maybe a bit less water as it didn't cook down as much as I would have liked.

This was SO good!! The only change I made was that I used 2 cans of kidney beans rather than dried/soaked, so i cut the 6 cups of water to 3 and let everything simmer for a little over an hour until the broth wad nice and reduced. I'll definitely make this again!

I used 28 oz canned diced tomatoes (undrained) and only 1 cup water to cook the beans . After tasting, I also added more garlic, 1/2 tsp granulated onion and 1/2 tsp salt. Delicious! This beats my old red beans & rice recipe by far!

I made as described but tend to go heavy handed with herbs and garlic.  Loved the end result.  I SOAKED my beans for at least 30 hrs with many many changes of water before cooking because of time constraints to get the dish started.  Used brined turkey (which tasted like ham) because it was in my freezer.  I would use this easily as an after Christmas  acres skis dish!

love, Love, LOVE this recipe!!! 
I had been craving red beans and rice for a couple o weeks and finally just decided to "pull the trigger" and try my hand at making my own from scratch rather than buying some from a restaurant/grocery.
I know it calls for Andouille  sausage (and I do love that) I happened to have had some smoked sausage already AND as is a rather frequent habit with me, I embellished even more and put a Wisconsin spin on it by using some left over Bratwurst that I had already to go! THAT added a decidedly unique flavor pairing to an already massive favorite!

Wow!  This recipe was so easy and so delicious. I'll definitely be making it again.  

I soaked the beans overnight, then prepped the celery, onion, and bell pepper and added the spices to the slow cooker and let it cook on low all day.  By the time I got home from work, all I had to do was turn the slow cooker to high and add the sliced andouille. By the time the rice was done, so were the beans, and their union was simply amazing.  

A splash of apple cider vinegar really does change the whole flavor of the dish.  I haven't decided if it's better that way; I'll leave that to you to decide.  It's definitely worth trying.

I tend to use recipes as "suggestions" more than anything. This one worked well that way, although I did a few things differently. rather than using oil, I used the fat from the sausage. Rather than soaking the beans the night before, most packages of beans have "quick soak" directions on them, which I used. and I split the seasonings between the trinity and the beans while both were cooking. When I combined them, I just add the rice directly, saving me one pot for rice.

Wow wow wow, what an amazing recipe! I had to work all day and didn't have time to watch over the beans so I cooked them in a crockpot instead of on top of the stove. I didn't even presoak the beans the night before. I simply washed the beans well - very well - and then placed them in a crockpot with 7 cups of hot water. I took the suggestions of others about using chicken broth and decided to add two heaping tablespoons of chicken base to the water and stirred in to dissolve. Side Note: Chicken base is a highly concentrated stock that's in a paste type form. It's sold in most grocery stores next to the bouillon and comes in a jar. Chicken base is like bouillon in a way, but  much richer in flavor and without all the salt. Try it - it will surprise you. Anyway, I added all the spices to the vegetables as they sautéed cooking only until the onions were beginning to turn translucent, then stirred them into the beans. I live in a part of the country where andouille is very hard to find, so I reluctantly tried the Johnsonville andouille sausage. I was extremely surprised and pleased with the flavor and quality. Not greasy at all and super tender.  I vertically sliced the sausage into 1/2 inch pieces and then stirred it into the beans. I set the crockpot on low and cooked for 10 hours. I was concerned the sausage would be too mushy and the beans too soupy, but it was absolutely perfect. Tasted exactly like I remembered eating all those times in New Orleans.  Even using the amount

Wonderful!  I've never had red beans and rice before but this was different and delicious.  I made it in the crock pot and used fresh bone broth in place of some of the water.  We really loved it.

I loved this recipe! I picked this because of how many spices there were. I'm no expert on red beans and rice, but this looked promising. Made it for the family and they loved it too.

I really liked this and will make it again. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is I don't think you need all the oil to saute veggies in. I also used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of water in the final cooking of the beans. It seemed to need a little more cajun seasoning too.

Can't properly rate/review this one, because I couldn't find the right sausage. I believe that's why it didn't work out. I thought I could substitute any smoked sausage, but the sausage I used was much too hard. Willing to try again if I ever find andouille sausage.

Time saver, use can red kidneys and link sausage (HIllshire or Eckerds), reduce a can of tomatoes, add veggies + spices. Throw in Crock serve w/ side of shred cheese and Tabasco. Prefect tailgating.

I've been making & sharing this recipe for years. It is a perfect electric pressure cooker recipe, no need to pre-soak the beans that way! Instruction adjustment would be to cook beans, making sure there is still plenty of water, then add veggies & spices. Authentic Cajun sausage is great, unless you are feeding small people, then any smoked sausage will do. This freezes well, so make enough to put aside some to reheat in a few weeks

I thought this was a good recipe, I used what I had on hand & it came out satisfactory. I'm giving this 3 stars because I was the only one that ate it. My entire family didn't want to eat this.  We do live in the Midwest so maybe that had something to do with it.  I probably won't make again.  I was happy to try it though.

I made this recipe exactly as written - it was terrible. My husband  (who never complains about food, ever) asked, "What did you do wrong???" There were too many different spices/flavors and the bay leaves were really over powering. I think the amount of time & water suggested in regards to cooking the beans was way off. The beans were mushy and the other vegetables had turned into a paste from being over cooked. What a disappointment!

I made my own Cajun seasoning which included  salt and cayenne so I omitted these from the recipe. I also used canned beans which meant I used less than a cu of water.. I served Nando's peri peri sauce with it. Absolutely delicious. I'd like to try it with chicken or pork too.

I am from South Louisiana and this recipe is a good one, but the picture with the recipe is not. Red beans should be thick and creamy, you should barely have to chew the beans. Also, I would omit the sage and olive oil. Just saute and brown the sausage, use the drippings from the sausage to saute vegies in. You could also throw in a ham bone or ham hock for extra flavor. There is nothing better than a pot of red beans that have been cooked all day. Sprinkle some pepper vinegar on top the beans when serving, it is a great compliment to the beans. This is a great dish that won't break your wallet. Serve with some homemade corn bread.

Winner!  We really enjoyed this recipe. Followed all directions except subbed oregano for the sage. We don't like sage. Mashed some beans to thicken the broth. Great with cornbread.

I made this recipe this weekend. We really enjoyed it!  The only thing I changed was that I added chicken bouillon to the beans and vegetables as they simmered all day.  Also add salt to taste. My whole family tucked in and had seconds.

Wow, this dish was full of flavor! I had to adapt this dish to what I had on hand...
I used 1 lb of chicken andouille sausage, 4 cans of red kidney beans, reduced the water because I made the rice separate, used low sodium chicken broth, puréed 1 of the 4 cans of beans for thickness, added a pinch o ??

Came out well, but didn't bring much heat. Doubled the Cajun spice and Cayenne pepper to bring it up. Also added a little corn starch to thicken the broth. It's a great recipe using common items and makes a lot.

Red Beans & Rice is one of our family's favorite dishes.  I've always used The Joy of Cooking recipe 'till now.  I  made this last Friday, let the flavors meld overnight & served it over rice yesterday for us & our neighbors (from New Orleans) & the raves were non ending. This is our new recipe & I could not be more pleased.  Our neighbors asked what i had done to improve the flavour; I told them of this recipeI which they printed & took with them & are making it for themselves today.  Thank You ever so much.

I am from Cajun Country and my parents were from New Orleans. This recipe is too watery, need to smash some beans and simmer till thick. I also use Tabasco sauce but I add a little ketchup instead of the vinegar.

LOVE THIS!!!!
The only thing it needed was salt so about an hour into it simmering I tasted it and added some (and a dash more Tony's). I started cooking way way too early so after 2 hours of simmering I threw in the sausage and let t cook for 15 or so minutes and then I threw it in the croc pot for around 2 hours. Holy moly me oh my.

Very delicious! Made it with the exact ingredients but I did brown sausage first added chopped veggies and spices. Then I added the 6 cups of water and dried beans. Brought to boil. Turned off for 1hour then brought back to boil, covered and simmered for 2 hours. Perfect!

the only thing is that the beans were a bit undercooked. I don't know where I went wrong. if anybody has some bean tips, I'll appreciate it!! thanks

Fantastic! I made a few substitutions- dried small red beans instead of kidney beans, vegetable oil instead of olive oil, added 1 tsp. black pepper, 2 tsp. Cajun spice instead of 1 tsp. and 1 1/2 lbs andouille sausage. I added tabasco to my bowl and a splash of apple cider vinegar. Delish!

This really is closest to my Nonna's recipe as I've found.  She doesn't even have it written down, and uses a ham bone with it - but getting a ham bone isn't easy, and this is just as great without it. My culinary students tested it for a Mardi Gras luncheon for 250 teachers, and it's awesome, and very easy to make (just time consuming!).  We made some changes:
1.  Cut up some black forest ham and added with the sausage
2.  Stirred in a few squirts of ketchup at the end, it really made it.  
3.  Serve with a splash or two of balsamic vinegar.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone always enjoys it. I add about a quarter stick of butter and some salt during simmering and think it makes it a touch richer. In order to make this recipe in a time friendly manner: I make up 4-5 seasoning packs up once I have all of the spices out, to save time in the future. I also have used 4 cans of canned beans (then cover with water) in lieu of dry. They also have minced garlic in tubes that saves time mincing garlic. STILL delicious and can be completed start to finish in 45 min or so. Thanks for the recipe! I used to lunch at Bourbon & Tolouise (authentic Cajun restaurant) in Lexington, KY and this is every bit as good as theirs.

I made this exact same recipe but I used dryed pinto beans, I cleansed rinsed them,  cooked them on stove top for 30 minutes next time I will cook longer. I also cooked rice separately mixed it in later after beans and other ingredients cooked I used a slow cooker cooked on high  8hrs. I ran across this article about cooking dried beans in slow cooker. if your cooker doesn't get very hot I suggest cooking beans on stove top for at least an hour then adjust your slow cookers time.

Was looking for a real-deal recipe to remind me -- it's been too long since I made this. I just cook the trinity in the bottom of a big pot with the sausage and then dumped the beans in there. But otherwise much the same (with a little wine of course ?? and my own spice mix). Fantastic!

Honestly, I was drawn to this recipe by trying to find a way to improve on the Popeyes red beans and rice, which have gotten worse and worse over the years. As a basic recipe to work from, this was fantastic! I made a couple of modifications. For one thing: throwing a handful of minced sausage in with the onions, peppers, celery and garlic at the beginning gives the overall stew a boost...

The authenticity of this recipe resides in the fact that the  measurements are approximates and suggestions, based on taste and style. Unfortunately saying "authentic" also draws out the comments from the haters. If they found this recipe bland or boring, the fault lies in their own cooking, not the recipe.

I made this recipe last night for 25 people. They loved it!! I kept the sausage out of it, because I let people choose if they wanted beef or chicken links at the end but those rice and beans were devoured by all. I will definitely be making again! :)

I used canned beans instead of dry because I never can get dry beans to soften.  Other than that, I followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I was afraid it would be too spicy because I'm quite a wimp, but, once I put it over the rice, it was just plain good!

USE the Andouille sausage! This recipe is exactly like red beans & rice I've had in NOLA. I used kidney beans (that's what I had on hand)-soaked over night. As some suggested the KB don't soften as much even after cooking longer, so next time I'll use the smaller red beans. The flavor was SUPERB! I took it to work for lunch and let a few others taste it, they could NOT believe it wasn't from a cajun restaurant!  Said it tasted JUST like the real deal! I WILL make this again! Thank you!

This recipe was excellent. I found I only needed to cook 1 1/2 hrs. rather than the 2 1/2 stated. I used the Cammelia brand red beans and soaked them. Will definitely make again.

This was flavorful and so delicious! If you don't like it too spicy, cut down on the cayenne. I used half and thought it had a nice kick but wasn't too spicy for my kids. If you have to make it in a hurry, you can use canned beans and add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it.

My tweaks: (1) I did add 2 tsp of cajun seasoning  (Slap Ya Mamma).  (2) used 3/4 chicken broth and 1/4 beef broth (what I had in the pantry).  It was too spicey for my daughters but fine for the wife and I.  The spice came primarily (probably) from the extra Slap Ya Mamma (my daughter described it as dried skin of the devil in a can) but the  Savoie's (sp?) Andouille had a bit of it's own heat.  I typically like my food to be mildly spicey as a baseline for the family and then add heat for me primarily with sauce (Belizean habanero sauce almost exclusively for me... love the flavor)  This was too spicey to add sauce and still enjoy.  

I enjoyed the texture ... it came out creamy from mushed beans and veggies but also with full beans to add variety.  It simmered mostly with the lid on (I had it cooking while I was away) and only had the lid off for the last 20-30 with the sausage.  Next time I will probably leave the lid off for the last hour (pre-sausage) and after putting the sausage in so there might be more whole beans left and also thicken up a tad more from evaporation.

I'd probably enjoy it more with a smoked sausage instead of Andouille.  The Andouille really didn't bring anything unique to the flavor ... just more of the same cajuny spice.  A smoked sausage, however, would be add something distinct and complementary.  I'm from Texas though so that may have something to do with that preference.

Very good.  I cut the amount of cayenne pepper; I used 1/4tsp instead of the amount the recipe called for.  As written it would be too spicy for our family.  I used turkey andouille sausage instead of pork & brown rice instead of white.  My husband said in terms of flavor, he couldn't tell a difference so that helped to make it healthier.  I made a sweet jalapeño cornbread to go with it.  I will definitely make this one again!

Really good flavor. I didn't use the thyme and took out the bay leaves after only about 10 minutes. I increased the amount of Cajun seasonings and it had a nice kick to it. I also used a different sausage, I will definitely make it again with the sausage it calls for.

I live in New Orleans.  While everyone and their mom has a favorite recipe, this is my go-to for red beans and rice.  I make my own Cajun seasoning, and will often increase the amount of veggies, but that's my preference. It's perfect as it is!  Sometimes I'll add bacon and use the grease to cook the vegetables, and sometimes I add ham or tasso.  Any way you make it your own, the base recipe is awesome.

Turned out good. I'm not a seasoned eater of Louisiana beans. I chose to cook double he recipe so I doubles all the ingredients including the Cayanne pepper.... A bit too much spice for me. I will remake this later and will likely cut that down. Other than that it has a unique taste you don't find in south Florida.

I did it with fresh herbs instead of dried and served it with coconut rice and a green salad.

This is a great recipe! If you are from New Orleans, you don't rate to judge red beans and rice, jambalaya, sauce picaunte, or gumbo! You are Yankees, stick to your Yankee food, leave us Cajuns alone. The only good thing to come out of New Orleans are Muffalottalas.

I have made this multiple times and our family loves it. I like all of my food really spicy so I add tabasco to the recipe and then again to my bowl. When I need a big pot of food to put in the fridge for a few days of meals this is one of my go to meals.

I've made this recipe a few times now using canned beans instead of dry. 2-3 cans get the job done just fine. 
Family complained that I didn't make enough, which doesn't happen often in my house!

Excellent recipe. I reduced the garlic and reduced the cayenne slightly. Substituted chicken broth for water and used smoked sausage. Tossed the whole thing in my slow cooker and cooked on low for 8 hours.

Fantastic! No changes necessary.  I happen to use a house made ground hot pork sausage from my local co-up; it's quite delicious and incorporates well. A friend of mine told me he actually preferred it over the andouille version although I suppose it depends on the taste and quality of the sausage and your own preference. I also sautee chopped onions and garlic before adding the rice and water and add a dash of turmeric for color. Not a needed step but it gives it some added love. As for the opinion of cajunpcs, I have to say respectfully that I think you're whacky on the junk. I am not from Louisiana so I have no right talking about authenticity here but I do know my food and it seems to me a lot of other reviewers, who are from Louisiana, approve. Bottom line; it tastes great and that is what matters. To say basically that this dish is rubbish just makes no sense unless either your taste buds are shot or you don't like this style of cuisine. This has made it to my top 3 dishes which is a fairly distinguished position in my repertoire.

I keep a lot of dehydrated veggies so when I get the urge to cook, I don't have to run to town to purchase items.  Used dehydrated celery and peppers and added 1 1/2 lb. elk burger.  Everything else was exactly as in recipe.  Absolutely delicious.  My husband is from Louisiana and raves about the red beans and rice that he grew up on and he loved this!  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us!

Made exactly as stated in recipe, except that I used the crock pot!  Cooked for 8 hours on low, then added the sausage and cooked on high for 30 minutes.  Delicious!  I served this with homemade cornbread.

i have served this twice and my guests have raved each time.  Comments such as "best I have ever had" were frequent.  It is a hair spicier than I normally cook but the heat does not stick with you.  My guests who do not care for a lot of spice liked it just as much as those who do.  By the way, my guests and I are all from Louisiana.

Not sure how this recipe received any other rating  than a five!  I made as listed but simmered in a slow cooker on low for 4.5 hours then transferred bean mixture to pan, added sausage and continued to simmer on the stove top for 30 minutes. (Work often interferes with my cooking pleasure). Used some of the liquid to boil my rice in. wOweeeeee. My husband is right now eating second helpings right  out of the pan. Glad it made plenty - will get me through the workday tomorrow thinking about eating this dish again when we get home. Great choice for our Fat Tuesday meal.

Excellent! I make this about once a month, because my husband asks for it and loves it.
He doesn't like andouille sausage so we'll use butcher-made sausage with pork and sometimes use kielbasa to make it less greasy. Really really delicious. 
Sometimes I'll use fresh parsley which is much better and we always like to add a bit more of the Cajun seasoning for a better kick. 
Once every hour as it is simmering, be sure to stir it up, and for good measure, we'll use the mixer to blend everything together. Comes out real nice and so delicious!
It's a hit in our house!! I've probably made this dish 20 times by now, or more.

This was delicious!  I haven't had the "real deal" to compare it to, but I was very happy with this dish.  It was easy to make, which is always a plus.  The only change I made was to add some chicken Better than Bouillon as per other reviewers' suggestions..  I'm not sure if I used a different creole seasoning than some (Tony Chachere's), but I didn't find the need to add more salt.  Any more would have been too much for me.   I will be making it again this weekend!

This is AMAZING. Granted, I'm not a Louisiana native (went for the first time a couple months ago and had this meal) but I thought it was fantastic. I had to improvise on a few things (my grocery store only had chicken andouille sausage and I used canned beans) but it still came out perfect. 

P.S. mine was done in 2 hours, not 2.5

My husband said this was the best meal that I've ever made and I've made some kick-a** meals. The heat was great. It was perfect for my hubby and it wasn't too hot for me. Made it Monday night; already planning to make it Sunday.

I didn't see the suggestion to use chicken broth, but used chicken broth for both the rice and the red beans and rice. Also, I didn't have andouille on hand, so I used half a pound of cooked chicken and half a pound of kielbasa.

When I made this, it just didn't have much flavor, but I liked the ingredients and texture.  I plan to re-make it with either chicken or vegetable stock (maybe half water/half stock) and double the cayenne pepper.

Great recipe!  I am always looking for a "new" way to eat pinto beans and this one is  keeper.  The first time I made it we were at the fishing camp and everyone loved them.  This will be a go to recipe for years to come.

I followed the recipe, except i browned the sausage first and used the drippings instead of the oil to cook the onions and veggies. It was delicious, just a little too spicy for me, next time i'll take the spice down a notch but otherwise it was great!

I have been making this recipe for two years now. My husband loves red beans and says I make them best. :) I do not soak the beans overnight. I soak them for 4-5 hours and this has always worked perfectly for me. Sometimes I double the recipe but decrease the water by 2 cups total. I omit the cayenne pepper for my kiddos. Us adults add hot sauce and green onions in our individual bowls. This is the best red bean recipe and I am from Baton Rouge. I worked for a caterer who made them for football games and I can say, this recipe is better.

I just made this for the first time, and my family is raving over it.  My wife thinks it is almost as good as her Mama's.  I hope there will be some left when I am ready to eat it!

I watched the video and mostly followed the recipe exactly, with the a few minor changes:

I used chicken andouille sausage and whole grain rice to make it healthier.

I added 1 tsp of ajwain which helps make the beans less gassy.  If you can't find it in your grocery store, you can get it from Amazon.

I also added about 1 tsp of ground black peppercorns.  If you are still using the powdered stuff. you don't know what your are missing.  Black peppercorns make everything they touch taste better.

That is pretty much it.  Otherwise, cooked exactly as specified.

Yum!!! I had to sub yellow bell pepper for the green (it's what I had on hand) and I added a bit of beef broth in place of some of the water for added flavor & richness. I also added smoked paprika to enhance the color. I didn't measure any of the herbs or spices, either - I just eye-balled them & added to our taste preferences. I've made this twice now & it will become a staple at my house. It is quite yummy and very filling! Both times, I served it with corn bread, fried okra & cole slaw. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!

Will definitely  make again. Didn't have any celery  on hand but still came out wonderful. I'm a cook that doesn't  usually measure things except for when baking, so I used this as an ingredient list and added a probably added more veggies and herbs then listed but the end result is exactely  what I was hoping for.

Awesome recipe - though I used garlic and deer sausage instead of the andouille so also added a little bit more cayenne pepper. Smash up the beans a bit while cooking to make the sauce a bit thicker but then you might need a bit more water - just depends how you like the consistency of the beans. Also had some ham bits left over and threw those in as well as cut way down on the amount of oil to sauté the vegetables and did use more celery. Served over basmati rice - sometimes the type of rice used can make a difference and I feel this is one of them. Everyone had seconds - a couple of the guys thirds so I'd say this was a hit.

This dish was a hit.  I used frozen kidney beans and omitted thyme, only because I didn't have any. I also turned the spice factor down a notch because I wanted to serve it to my toddlers.   Even without the thyme and full fire, my husband and I thought it was a hit.  Now I must admit that I thought the base recipe was in need of salt so I added a little tub of that concentrated chicken stock and it complimented the dish perfectly.  This dish is a winner!  I will certainly make this again, with the modifications I made.  I whipped up some corn bread, fried chicken and rice.  I can hardly wait to eat it again tomorrow!

I made this for our groups monthly senior citizen luncheon. Most are from the South, and although we (the volunteers who provide this monthly luncheon) are not, at the end one elderly fellow said I had "earned a place in Heaven," because of this dish.  I want some right now! Love Southern food!!

This was great! I did everything as written, only I added 2 bouillon cubes to the water. I also had no Cajun seasoning so I had to use creole seasoning, and it was still fantastic. I also crushed some of the beans with a spoon as suggested by other reviewers to make a thicker gravy, and then added some salt. YUM!

LOVED IT! 
I goofed and put creole seasoning instead of cajun seasoning (oops), but it was still terrific. A bit runnier than I expected, but that is by no means a disappointment. Spicy, hearty, comfort food. I'll make this again and again!

This was absolutely delicious though I improvised a few things.  I added a small ham hock at about the 1 hour point on the beans, and cut and fried up some breakfast sausage with the grease from it for a little more meaty flavor.  I also mashed up some of the beans after they had gotten soft so they would mix in with the base better.  Finally, instead of serving OVER the rice, I mixed the rice in with the beans (I also used brown rice instead of white).

This recipe is spot on. We like to eat our red beans and rice with hot-water cornbread.

Absolute best recipe ever. 

First time making beans not canned. I put them in boiling water placed a lid over the beans and brought them to a simmer for an hour. Drained them and proceeded with the recipe. I didn't want to waste two pots so I sautéed the herbs first, added the trinity, sausage and moved it into a bowl. I took the reconstituted beans threw them into the same pot and added a quart of vegetable stock and the remaining 2 cups of liquid (I used water). Dashed some kosher salt

After about an hour and 20 minutes I checked the beans and they were perfect. I added back the veggies and sausage (I used turkey kielbasa-could not find any andouille in my grocery store) and simmered for another 30 minutes to reduce liquid). 

Garnished with cilantro and green onions.  To die for. Thank you for such an incredible recipe and easy to make!

I tried this recipe, and it was delicious, everyone loved it!!   So i brought in a couple Louisiana natives to give it a try, while they did enjoy it, they immediately pointed out some improvements, such as cooking the kidney beans in pinto bean seasoning, and adding a ham hock to beans while cooking.  By the way, it was so much better the next day.  All in all the finished product was extremely enjoyable, so following the recipe precisely will not be a let down.  Happy cooking!!!

Substituted the beans with the "15 Bean Soup" bean mix. Added 1/4 teaspoon of grounded white pepper and salt to taste. Used 2lbs of sausage instead of 1lb. My family loved it. Served with cornbread muffins.

Only thing I did different was cook it longer to get the beans to break down like the red beans and rice my Cajun roommate made  This turned out just like his.  The quality of the sausage makes a huge difference.

The whole family loves this one. We use Tony Chachere's for the Cajun seasoning, and plain hardwood smoked sausage if we don't andouille on hand.

I have made this several times without changing a thing and I absolutely love it. Everyone that tries it loves it. I use Earl Campbell sausage when I can't find andouille. I honestly believe Earl Campbell sausage makes it more spicy.

Very nice to know that an authentic Cajun cook would not use measurements, but I'm pretty sure an authentic Cajun cook wouldn't be perusing a recipe on the internet.  Can we keep the criticims to the actual recipe please?

Delish! First time  making Red Bean and Rice and I love it. I stuck to the recipe with one exception -- I do not eat pork and my husband is a vegetarian, so at the point in the recipe before you add the meat, I split it in to two pots; one vegetarian and the other using a chicken andouille sausage. Both pots are great!

Awesome! The kids ate it all up. I made one substitution... instead of the andouille sausage I used what I had on hand which was Butterball Smoked Turkey Sausage. I just sliced them up and put it in. The kids loved the "special hotdogs" that was in it.

This dish was phenomenal!  Everyone loved it & my husband was asking when I was going to make it again before we finished the first pot!  I will definitely make again!  I'm from down south and both pair of my grandparents lived in Louisiana, so I can attest that this dish has authentic  Louisiana flavor!  I prepared it just the way the recipe said and it was beyond yummy.  This is a keeper in my book! :)
_________________________________________

UPDATE: I've made this numerous times and it always comes out great!  This particular time, I used chicken andouille sausage and it was phenomenal yet again!!!

I made this exactly as written except for adding salt and some extra cajun seasoning, it was fabulous! Served with cornbread and sauteed green beans and onions as a side.  Will be making this again and again, a new family favorite!

Super yummy!  Big hit with the family.  I made some Johnnycakes to go with the beans and rice and it was fantastic.  Will definitely make these again... maybe next Monday!

Made this for my husband who loves red beans and rice. He loved it.I did reduce the oil and I boiled the beans for an hour, then added all my seasonings.I continued boiling for another 2 hours. I also did not soak the beanso overnight.

Before going to work this morning (6-03-10) I placed all the ingredients in my Crock Pot and cooked on low for 6-7 hours.  For additional flavor and to give this recipe "my own signature" I added three smoked turkey necks, Zummo sausages and BADA-BLING - this is a WINNER!!!!!

Delicious with some cornbread muffins! I make the recipe exactly as stated, and it's a huge hit. Even my brother, who is a cajun fan and a tough one to please, loves this dish.

All I can say is YUMMMMMMMMMM!! This is sooooo good.  I couldn't wait for the rice and cornbread.  The recipe is fine and the only adjustments I made was adding ham pieces that was from a shank I had. I would guess around 1 cup and I used smoked sausage because andouille sausage is a rarity in Detroit. I also used 1 Tablespoon of Tony's Cajun Seasoning instead of 1 tsp.  We like semi crunchy celery so next time I will add it when I add the sausage.  I hope this freezes well.....that is if there is any left!  Thanks Miami!  This is in my recipe box!

Delicious and spicy!  See the simple cajun seasoning "recipe" on this site if you don't have handy.  I think I erred in covering the pot during simmering as the beans and veggies were still very liquid after the cooking time.  No matter for us as I was making it a day ahead, and overnight resting and reheating with lid off gave it the correct consistency.  Fun to make, smelled wonderful; we loved this dish.

I loved this recipe and make it often.  With the 6 cups of water I did use 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth and 3 cups water.  I do use canned kidney beans.

This was my first attempt at a beans and rice dish!  I've always purchased the quick and easy packages.    I was very impressed!  My Roommate was very impressed!  It was very easy to prepare, gave the kitchen a wonderful aroma while it was cooking and I have plenty of leaftovers to enjoy!  I'm looking forward to trying my beans and rice recipes!

There was nothing wrong with this recipe, so I'll give it four stars. However, it just didn't really stick out as "good!" I couldn't comment on it's authenticity, as I've only had red beans and rice in New Orleans once, however this was nothing like what I had.

This recipe is great! I am a Louisiana native and this gets my approval. I double up on cayenne and sage. I also add Tony's, seasoning salt, and regular salt to taste. Love this. Husband really loves it!

Very very good! I used canned beans and added a can of diced tomatoes, and didn't cook it nearly as long, but it was so good! Pair it with cornbread!

This is pretty close to what I ate in Louisiana when I lived there.  However, whether it's 'authentic' or not, I was taught to add a can of beer to the beans.  Definitely adds 'character' to the overall flavor!

I've made this recipe three times since Halloween and we love it!  It always goes over well and the spice is easily adjustable without compromising flavor.  I don't use andouille since I can't find it in DC but I'm very happy with smoked sausage.  I also add shredded chicken to mine which I boil and season seperately.  I also add a can of diced tomatos with chiles. I've used both kidney beans and red beans and haven't noticed a significant difference.  It's laborious but well worth it.  Leftovers don't last long at all!

Pretty good meal for a cold night. I cooked mine in the slow cooker all day. I knew I should have left out the Thyme since I can't stand it. I halved the amount and it was still too grassy tasting.

Absolutely fab meal, the red beans are given a new lease of life in this recipe. Being a head chef for some 25 years now at a top london restaurant i was pleasantly taken aback with the final outcome. A meal for all occassions thats filling, warming and wholesome throughout. Paul..

This was really good, but really spicy. I do not like spicy at all, but I think it was spicy because of the andouille sausage I used. My husband loved it, but he loves spicy. The only thing I did differently was I used chicken broth instead of water and then when I added the sausage I took a cup of beans out and mashed them up and then added them back to the pot. Next time I will use kielbasa or ham hock.

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't know andoiulle was spicy or I would have cut down on the cayenne.  I thought sausage was a little too greasy. I will skip sausage next time.

This was my very first time even having red beans and rice, let alone making it, so I have no authority on the claim of "Authentic".  But I do know that it tasted great! Had a red pepper on hand so I used that instead of green, and I had to add extra spices, but that's because my boyfriend and I like things spicy.  To make it healthier, we didn't use sausage and replaced the white rice with brown.  Will definitly make again!

Well, this was fantastic!  My husband and I don't eat green peppers at all, so we substituted 2 red bell peppers instead. And they didn't have any andouille sausage here in the UK that we could find, so went for a Polish sausage.  We also added a ham hock while everything cooked, and then shredded the meat from it, and added okra in the end.  Made my grandmother's cornbread and decided to skip the rice and just eat the beans and sausage over that.  Delicious!

It was pretty good.  We'd make it again, but it wasn't quite what we remembered from our favorite restaurant.  I'd add more spices.

I loved this. My husband liked Jumbalaya[sp?] better. I like them both. This is a little simpler tasting. I used a low fat smoked sausage.I also followed the other recipe with covering the beans in water, boiling, cover for an hour. Very good.

Flavor was very good.  However, for those of us from the North, it would be helpful to know that Andouille is generally smoked in the South.  All I could find was some fresh Andouille.  The dish was good, but would have been great with more authentic sausage.

Great recipe! I used canned beans because I was in a hurry and turkey kielbasa (for health, even though andouille tastes better). Still turned out really great, but a cornbread side is a must! Will definitely make again :o)

This is a great red beans and rice recipe!  I made it as directed, except used vegetable oil instead of olive oil (next time I will use less) and I accidentally used a tablespoon of cajun seasoning instead of a teaspoon!  I thought it gave it just the right amount of spice, but it was too much for my kids.  I will make this next time I need a red beans and rice fix.

Wonderful dish!  Easy to prepare, very well received by the company we served it to, and it left the house smelling really good.  I followed the recipe pretty much too the letter except that I used smoked sausage.  Will definitly make this again!

Really great. I had to substitute a little on the spices to adjust to what I have available in my kitchen and also added about 2 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of black pepper and it came out really great. Husband raved. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious! I didn't actually measure anything just threw the ingredients together but it turned out great. I mixed the rice in at the end (rather than serving it over rice) and that added some depth in flavor as the rice absorbed the seasonings.

This was delicious. I needed to use extra seasonings such as salt, cumin, oregano and the Cajun seasoning (Simple Cajun Seasoning also from this site)but that's probably because I made mine with leftover ham instead of the andouille sausage. I will definitely be trying this recipe again with the sausage and we thank you for a yummo meal last night MIAMI BEACH!

This was very good.  Used broth as some suggested.  Applied the spices exactly as directed.  I like mine spicy and often add some hot sauce at the table but I didn't need it for this recipe.  

My local market was out of andouille so I used a "Cajun style smoked sausage."  

I simmered for about three hours, then another hour after I added the sausage even though it was already cooked.  The consistency was very nice.  I will make this again.

This was great - the only thing different that I did was instead of using water I used chicken stock to cook the beans and went ahead and add the sausage into the pot with the  beans and vegetables. I also did not cook the rice seperatley  - after simmering for 2 hours I added the rice to the pot – brought it back up to a boil – turned the heat off and let it sit for about 45 minutes without uncovering the pot. Everyone loved it.

We loved this recipe! My husband isn't a big rice eater, but the flavor was so good that he didn't seem to notice the rice. The only thing I had to do differently was use polska kielbasa, but it was just right for us. Thanks for a keeper!

This is a SUPER recipe. I do agree with other reviewers about the salt. I think you should do about 50/50 chicken broth/water. Maybe if you have andouille, you don't need it. I used chx sausage. The 6 cups of liquid was not enough liquid(i probably ended up adding an extra 1 1/2-2 cups). But I also used the small red beans vs. large kidney beans. I used chicken sausage instead and only sprinkled a few dashes of cayenne(had a 3 yr. old to feed). Oh, and I had no sage. But overall I think this turned out REALLY YUMMY!!!

This dish is EXCELLENT --I followed the recipe exactly except for the sage (I'm out) and it is so easy & incredibly tasty. Add tasbasco sauce to taste (at the table) but the recipe itself is perfect as is. The only change I may make next time is to substitute chicken broth for half of the water but other than that I won't change a single thing. This is the only recipe to use if you want the taste of the real thing!

Maybe it was because I didn't add the sausage until the end (to make some vegetarian), but it was disappointingly bland.

This was a wonderful recipe! I used red beans, added more cayenne, some salt, and it was perfect!

Being a Louisianian myself I have to say that this recipe was very authentic.  I served it with some crusty bread and didn't have anything left in the pot!

This was great!!  I actually cooked the beans for about 4 hours before adding the meat.  I did a quick soak of the beans (bring to a boil and then let the beans sit for about an hour) rather than soaking them overnight.  The only thing my husband said it needed was twice as much meat!

This was very good. I used dried red beans instead of kidneys, but will probably use kidneys next time because the red beans bled while I was soaking them, and wound up more pink than red. I also used Tony C's Creole seasoning because two stored I went to here in Springfield MO did not have Cajin seasoning. Is there much of a difference? I put this into my Dutch Oven in the Oven at 250 and stewed from around 8am till we got home from Church just after noon. The top looked dry at first but one stir with the spoon and it was perfect. Next time I will go ahead and add the sausage at the beginning so we don't have to wait after Church. I sent some home with my daughter, and am now waiting on SIL opinion. Red Beans and Rice is his favorite dish.

Less water ( better to use broth ). Yes, add salt & pepper. Diced/stewed tomatoes too. Must not skip Andouille - that is the heart and soul of the dish. Someone mentioned they can`t find Andouille in Michigan - Holiday Market in Royal Oak carries the cooked at at their deli counter and uncooked at their meat counter.

YUMMY!!!  Everyone in my family ate it up.  The only thing I did differently was replace sage with oregano as I didn't have sage.  And I added frozen okra in the last 10 minutes. This one is going into my repertoire!

We loved this! I did cheat and use canned red kidney beans. Once I found this recipe, I just had to make it the same day! It came out fantastic...and it tastes even better the next day! Thanks for posting.

OMG this is sooooo good. The only 2 changes I made were instead of water I used chicken stock and instead of the sausage called for I used Chappel Hill smoked garlic. I let it sit for about 30 minutes before I threw in the sausage....it became so think and yummy!!!!! I can't wait for the family to try it.

I followed this recipe and the problem was that the simmer time is way too long and the garlic overpowered all of the other flavors. I think that less simmering  time (maybe an hour), along with half of the garlic, might make this recipe work out. Also, the long simmering time decreases the nutrients from the ingredients.

This was really, really good and hit the spot. I'd been craving red beans and rice forever. It's really rather basic and for the first two hours I was worried because it seemed to be extremely DULL. At the two hour mark I threw in 3 chicken bouillon cubes and a bit more cajun spice and let it simmer for two more hours before adding the meat (regular smoked sausage links).In the end I was very pleased. Very good.

I was really excited about this recipe - and I followed it to the letter. It was very bland for my palate and my husband only considered it edible after dumping at least a 1/4 cup of hot sauce on it. If you like red beans and rice without any kick to it - just add some salt and this recipe is for you.

My husband and I agree with another reviewer that the only spice was the heat.  Just seemed a little bland.  HOwever, I didn't modify the recipe as others had suggested, so maybe that was my problem.

Really, really good.  I made it in the crock pot after sauteeing the veggies on the stove first.  The whole family loved it, which is unusual for us, for a bean dish. Will definitely make this regularly.

Used Aidelis andouille and canned Glory red beans.  Added a small can of tomato sauce and some chicken stock.  Let this reduce and thicken.  Excellent recipe!

This was a good recipe.  I did tweak it some, as others as recommended.  I used about a tablespoon of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning as opposed to a teaspoon.  I definitely used Andouille sausage and it was great.  As someone else suggested, I would recommend more than 1 lb of meat.

Great - nice change from all the Thanksgiving leftovers! I have made red beans several times, but liked this combination of herbs and seasonings.  Only thing I added was subbed a can of beef broth for 2 cups of water.

Made this in the slow cooker on a lazy Sunday and it turned out very good - definitely tastes like authentic Louisiana cookin'!  I added 2 bouillon cubes of chicken stock, basil, and more cayenne pepper suggested from other reviewers.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

This was delicious!  I don't know what the last person was using for the "heat" but my red beans and rice only had a slight bit of heat...very slight...and I followed the recipe to a "T".  I used turkey kielbasa, that is the only change that I made.  I think the next time, I will probably kick up the cayenne or just add some hot sauce to my bowl.  Regardless, this is awesome with some cornbread.

I've never had Red Beans & Rice before, nor have I ever made it,so....I don't know if my husband and I just don't LIKE Red Beans & Rice, or if we just don't like this recipe.  We both thought the only "flavor" was that of heat; other than that, we both thought it tasted bland and that it needed more meat to it. I added extra salt and more Cajun seasoning, which helped somewhat, but not enough to the point that it saved the recipe. I would not make this again...especially considering the time involved. I'll take a good bowl of chili over this anytime, and I'm not even a huge chili fanatic.

I love this recipe.  My boyfriend is a super picky eater and he LOVES this.  It has been a staple in our dinner repetoire for almost two years.  It's very nicely spicey, and the sausage is awesome.  I love cajun food, and this is a fantastic recipe.

Definitely a recipe to make again.  A big hit with husband and his friends.  We have been to New Orleans and this dish is definitely "authentic".  Did need to add some salt (actually I added a couple beef bouillon cubes).

Perfect--just like the red beans and rice I grew up eating, and so easy!  I substituted turkey sausage for andouille and also added some pieces of turkey ham.  It was a bit bland initially, but as the week progressed the flavors deepened wonderfully.  Thank you for sharing!

We just got back from Baton Rouge and I had never had such awesome Cajun cooking! This recipe is great, very authentic! I looked all over town for andouille sausage, but what I found was not worth the hunt. I don't like the Johnsville stuff is authentic, not spicy at all. Recipe will be made over and over and over...

This was probably the best red beans and rice I've ever eaten!  Absolutely delicious!  Only change I made was to add some salt.  Not spicy enough for my husband but a little extra cayenne corrected that.  Will definitely make again!

I was quite surprised to find that the recipe turned out kind of bland. I did not have a couple of spices in the pantry (thought I did...) so maybe that was a factor. However, a little Tony Chachere's and Louisiana Hot Sauce went a long way, and it was really pretty good. The texture of the beans was great after most of the day in the crock pot on low and then a couple hours on high. We'll make this again and try to add some more flavor. Thanks!

I tried this recipe and it needs more spice. I put twice as much cajun seasoning in to begin with and it still wasn't spicy enough. Although those who weren't use to Cajun Spicy Foods thought it was.

yum!  I loved it with a dallop of sour cream.  The apple cider vinegar was not a hit with some!

Excellent! I forgot to soak the beans overnight so they only soaked for a couple of hours before cooking.  So they weren't soupy. I did add salt as was recommended by so many others.  Cooking time was right on. I will definately make again!

This was a wonderful recipe. Since andouille sausage is not readily available here in the Netherlands, I used a type of smoked bacon pieces, that worked out well. I also was a bit more liberal with the cajun seasonings and added some paprika too. It turned out lovely for my dinner party and had my dutch husband and dutch guests trying a new american cuisine and loving cajun food. Delish!

My red beans and rice always comes out of a box, so I decided to give this a try for a change.  I was unable to get andouille sausage and used a different smoked sausage.  The taste was comparable to that of the box (except it needed some salt), so I believe I will save myself some time in the future and just continue to use the Z-brand in the box.

Both of my sons love it and they are very picky.  It does take some time to make but it is worth it.

We enjoyed this recipe, it freezes well. I didn't have the sausage but used a smoked ham and it was very tasty.

Very good. I used canned beans and put it all in a crock pot to simmered all day. I also used 1 t. cumin and 1t. frozen cilantro leaves from my garden. I liked the faint taste of cilantro. This is a delicious, hearty dish for cold winter nights. Served it with the sweet 'Amusement Park Cornbread' from this site.

This recipe was the best ever.  I used smoked sausage, because I could not find andouille sausage.  I added more salt and cayenne pepper to taste.  This will be my staple red beans and rice recipe!
