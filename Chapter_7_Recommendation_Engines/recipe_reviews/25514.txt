These mushrooms are so delicious! I've been raving about them to family and friends. However, I recommend eating them hot out of the crock pot (the recipe calls for chilling). Honestly, I can't wait to make them again. Scrumptious, to be sure.

These were sooo good! I wanted a recipe that went good with steak and wanted something besides the old "mushrooms in italian dressing" recipies. I did not slow cook because of time but did cook them in electric skillet with onion and garlic as well and served hot with dinner.  Delicious!!

I was really excited about the mushrooms, but then disappointed by the taste.  I guess I should have expected them to taste like terhikki because of the ingredients, but it was an overwhelming surprise.  The mushrooms are very strong, I wouldnâ€™t suggest serving them by themselves.  They also tasted better warm not cold like the recipe suggests.  Good recipe if you are looking for terhikki mushrooms.

Very easy and tasty but only if you're a big fan of soy sauce. Choose a quality brand.

The amount of butter used made the mushrooms taste a little too buttery. I used 1/2 cup of butter and 2 cups beef bullion (in place of water) on my second batch.

This was a hit at a party I had.  We just left them in the crock pot with a slotted spoon.  I was also short on time before hand, and just did the first part with the butter, soy sauce (I actually used Bragg's- healthier!) and sugar in the crock pot itself, and it turned out fine.

These were awesome.  They got the 'you have to make them again' demand!  Even friends that are not crazy about mushrooms said the taste was wonderful (just not the texture!)I saved the sauce as a chicken marinade for the next day.  Will definately be making these again.  Thanks for a great recipe

WOW this was super!  My family LOVED it!  The only thing that I would change would be to spray the crockpot before cooking with nonstick spray to keep it from discoloring and staining.  Otherwise perfection!!!

Everyone loved these. I melted the butter and half the soysauce in the microwave in my crockpot rather than dirtying another dish. I also added a 5th package of shrooms and there was plenty of sauce to handle it.

Man were these good----and EASY. There's a restaurant we go to that serves shrooms almost identical to this, and I once asked how they were made. Naturally, they wouldn't tell me. I had to quarter the recipe, and the only thing I did different was add minced jarred garlic. But then, I garlic EVERYthing. We had these with bacon wrapped steaks and my husband couldn't make enough 'yummy' sounds. We used the juice from the shrooms for au jus and I believe the words he used were 'delicious', 'terrific', 'frickin awesome', and next time we need au jus for steak, I'm to make these mushrooms.

I have been making this recipe for the past 2 years.  I am frequently asked to bring these delicious little morsels to potlucks, and they are staples at the parties I host.  I also serve them warm.....just drain off some of the liquid from the crockpot and place them on the table as part of the buffet!

Very good recipe.....the only thing i did different was thicken up the sauce with corn starch and served the hot right out of the slow cooker. I also didnt do first step, I threw every thing right in slow cooker and it worked...... They were a hit!

I love mushrooms and I love soy sauce but this is way too much. Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think so as I followed the recipe to the tee. If I could give a zero I would.

I made this for a potluck at work.  VERY EASY!  I ran out of soy sauce, so I used teriyaki, and I didn't have white sugar, so I used brown.  They were delicious-kinda sweet and salty.  One thing, though...I fell asleep and the crock pot turned to the "warm" setting so by the time I woke up, the mushrooms had shrunk.  They tasted great, but didn't look too appetizing-LOL  Next time, I am going to add some green onions and program the crock pot to turn OFF-LOL

I used only half the quantity of soy sauce and it was still way too salty. I drained the mushrooms and added them to a noodle salad, so they were edible, but they were not suitable for a side dish. I gave 2 stars instead of 1, as I think this recipe has potential for tweaking into something good.

I made these to go with Christmas Dinner and they were wonderful!! Everyone loved them. I did add 2 cloves of diced garlic and subbed 1/2 brown sugar for white sugar. Next time I will be using less soy sauce.

Very good.  The sauce could make enough for eight packages of mushrooms.  I only needed to cook my mushrooms on low for about three hours before they were done.
