There is a much easier recipe...My husband is brasilian and his mother has been making this recipe for 70 years...Take a metal bundt pan place 1 cup of sugar.. We use more for extra syrup...Place on stove.. Heating sugar to a syrup...stirring aprox...15 minutes...swirl syrup in bundt pan covering sides...place in a glass pan of water... about half way up your bundt.. Place in a blender 12 eggs...3 cans condensed milk 14oz...3 cans of milk...(using your condensed cans)blend for 5 minutes..pour into bundt pan..Bake for 90minutes... on 400 degrees.Refrigerate at least 12hours... You can make different sizes...But this is the holy grail...If your blender doesnt hold it all ,you can pour part in a bowl..I have done both and it comes out the same.even if the ingrediants are uneven to start...There is less pans..No towels..No separating eggs...

This is a great recipe, and I make it at almost every gathering and holiday!  I do make it a bit differently.  You can get air bubbles if the oven temperature is too high or water in water bath is not enough.  I like mine very smooth, and my husband likes it with bubbles.  So I make it both ways.  I do add water to my syrup and sometimes few drops of vanilla too.  Once it's cool, I freeze the syrup so it doesn't mix with flan mixture.  I blend 1 can of sweet condensed milk, 1 can (I just use can as measurement) of milk and 3 eggs.  I don't separate my eggs, and I find that I like 3 eggs instead of 4.

Very tasty!  I split it into 5 ramekins for individual servings.  The only issue is that mine had tiny air bubbles...why?

Flan was super delicious. I would use more sugar to get extra caramel sauce. It took about 15 minutes to become syrupy.  I turned the flan after 2 hours of cooling off but it did not flip as nicely.  Next time I will refrigerate it first.  I can't wait to make it again.

This is one of my all-time favorite desserts. Rates up there with German chocolate cake. I have to restrain myself from eating a much bigger portion than I should.

I LOVE THIS. But it is difficult to make for a new cook or an inexperienced kitchen diver.  The carmel can burn and getting the right consistency is scary. But once you make this a few times (For me it was at least 5) you can feel the confidence and enjoy the perfect taste.  A recipe that is brillant and beautiful.  Obrigada!

Followed the recipe exactly. Cooked it at the specified temperature, with a water bath, covered for the recommended amount of time (45 minutes). The flan did not turn out as a custard, but rather glorified scrambled eggs in a ramekin. I've never had trouble with custards cooked in a water bath before. This was very disappointing, I hate wasting food.

Delicious flan.  I'll have to try some in Brazil on my next visit.  My only complaint is that the sugar took FOREVER to turn to syrup.  I was stirring for more like 25 minutes next time I will turn up the heat and hope I don't burn it.

(edit) I had flan in Brazil many times during my recent visit and this is the real thing.  If you have some Brazilian friends for whom you'd like to make a classic Brazilian desert you can't go wrong with this.  I recommend topping it with super fine coconut shreds for the real deal.

Loved it! Really value other commenters-- followed the suggestion to use more sugar for more syrup. One question: I used a glass pie pan and ended up with plenty of syrup, but also a dark hard mass of sugar on the pan. I feared the carmelized sugar would stick to the pan so I sprayed with just a little cooking spray.  I also used two tbsp water (recommended elsewhere) to get a good syrup. Did that backfire on me? Or is it inevitable to have that disc of sugar stuck to the bottom/top? Or did I do something else wrong?
Also, I learned you really have to let it fully cool in the refrigerator. We couldn't wait and had the first slice when it was still a little warm. But the next day, there was SO much more syrup and it had settled so nicely. Hope I have an occasion to make another again soon.

This is definitely not for a beginner! It was a very difficult recipe but it turned out delicious!  The syrup was hard to make, mine ended up being really hard when I poured it into the dish and didn't cover the whole dish but after it came out of the oven it was perfect just like the picture.  It also took a very long time to cook I did it for 45 minutes at 350 and it was still liquid so I did it for another 45 minutes at 400 and it came out perfect.  I also recommend using a small round dish, the one I used was a little too big so my flan came out very thin.

Pudim is a very good desert, but I could not get the caramel sauce to turn out for anything in the world with this recipe.  I found other recipes online that said to use water when making it and that seems to make more sense...so I'm going to give it another shot.

This is a recipe that we in Srilanka call Caramel pudding.. It is very popular and is a fall back quick and easy pudding that we use very often. That recipe uses water in place of the milk and less sugar for the sauce. I tried this recipe as is and Im comparing it to that. I love the firmer custard texture and the thicker caramel sauce that forms here. Its great warm or cold and I always unmould so the sauce drips down the sides. Somehow, I find that the sauce increases as it chills, so if I unmould straight from the steamer (which I use in place of oven. same cooking time) I have less sauce. If I refrigerate overnight then turn out, more sauce. Anyway, this is so much better than the traditional I grew up with.. My friends agree too.. They've all asked me for the recipe.. :) Who would have thought just milk in place of water would make such a big difference!

Made this on the spur of the moment.  I lived in Brazil and love their food.  I was always afraid to make this but it turned out to be relatively easy and came out fantastic!!!

This was my first attempt at Flan and it came out excellent.  The hardest part of the recipe was stirring the sugar constantly for fifteen minutes so it would melt and not burn.  .  I will be making this as a staple of my desserts for company!

I only used 1/2 cup of sugar, omitted the 2 tablespoons of milk and didn't separate eggs. I blended everything together. This is by far the best flan I have ever had.

Simply the best flan you can ever make, you got to try this recipe. I did have to alter the bake time, maybe because I have an electrical oven, after the initial 45min bake time I uncovered it and baked it for an additional 30 min checking the 1" from the center every 10min to see if it got done. Also I used 1/2 cup to make the caramel, I have a Batman mold and it was still too much. Next time ill see if 1/3 of sugar enough to coat the mold in a thinner layer.

This recipe tasted like overcooked eggs to me. I will try another recipe. I think it's a matter of personal preference on this one. some may like a super eggy tasting flan!
