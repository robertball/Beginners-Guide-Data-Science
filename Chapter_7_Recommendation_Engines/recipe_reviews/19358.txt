This is a good recipe with lousy instructions. For a 9x13 pan you will only need nine noodles, three layers of three noodles. On top of the first and second layers, put half of the cheese/veggie mixture. On top of the third layer (the top layer) put your last two cups of sauce. I actually used three cups of sauce for the top and sprinkled the top with extra mozzeralla and parmesan. Other adjustments I made: less onion, added garlic, added mushrooms, used fresh broccoli, and LESS oil. There is no way you need a half cup of oil. That really ups the fat content of this recipe. I sprayed the pan with PAM and used one tablespoon of oil. I sauteed on medium and it worked great.

The end product was DELICIOUS, but we had to make a lot of adjustments to the proportions so I can't give this 5 stars.  Namely, we used 1/2 of a 16 oz box of noodles which is 9 noodles.  Also 1 lb of ricotta cheese and 2 eggs was plenty of filling for a 9x13 pan.  I agree with another view on sauteeing the veggies in much less oil, abt 1 T is plenty!  Will definitely make this (adjusted!) recipe again  :-)

I love this recipe. I would recommend using only one package (16 oz) of lasagna noodles. I also used fat free ricotta and fat free mozzarella and did not worry about using the exact amount of vegetables as the recipe calls for. It turned out delicious, even with the fat free ingredients. I've made it twice. Yummy!

Delicious!  My husband and I absolutely love this recipe!  I used lots of vegetables including carrots, broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, red and green peppers, and onions.  I lightly coated the bottom of a large skillet with olive oil, browned some garlic in the oil, and then sauteed all of the vegetables in it.  You do not need all of the olive oil that this recipe calls for, and it is much healthier this way.  The garlic added a nice flavor to the vegetables.  I also used fat free ricotta and mozzarella to make this recipe a little bit healthier.  The taste was not compromised at all.  I used no boil lasagna noodles to make this recipe easier, and I only needed one box to make a huge pan.  This is a great recipe, but like others have said, be careful with the directions.

I made several modifications to this recipe and it came out great.  Making a smaller batch, I added different veggies in order to keep it interesting and healthy.  I used nine noodles (rice lasagna - no boil!), one container of ricotta, 2 eggs.  I sauteed yellow onion and then added carrots and asparagus, then broccoli, red bell pepper and cauliflower.  I only used about a tablespoon of olive oil and some garlic - and also only used fresh veggies.  I can't do frozen veggies.  I cooked it for an hour on 350 with tightly wrapped foil and then uncovered and put it under the broiler to finish.  We enjoyed it for a Sunday dinner and are both looking forward to the leftovers.  One other modification: I put a little tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan before the first layer of pasta.  Then I did: cheese/veggie mix, shredded cheese, dollops of sauce, pasta until the top layer where I only did sauce.  I was easy on the cheese between layers.

Very good recipe. Everyone liked it. I added minced garlic and zucchini to the veggies. I do have to say that you do not need nearly as many lasagna noodles as the recipe calls for, though.

Very easy to make and a healthy mix, but a bit bland.  I'd recommend adding garlic and some oregano.

Wonderful lasagna that helps us eat our vegetables!  My teen son stated how good this lasagna was, he thought something was different than our normal lasagna,  (no meat!), but he really liked it!  Really, reallly good the next day, of course.  I added fresh mushrooms and red bell pepper, and halved the ricotta mixture.

Good recipe. I used the entire bag of broccoli for the 6 servings size and it turned out okay.

Next time I will make sure that the lasagna edges have sauce on them so they won't get hard.

Making this "as is" was a bit bland and it made a total of THREE lasagnas. (Thankfully I keep foil 9x13 pans on hand, so I was able to freeze the other two for another night). That being said, I like the ease of making more than one dinner's worth and freezing the extras. I only used 16 ounces of noodles and that was more than enough for three pans worth of lasagna.  Like other reviewers, I saut√©ed the veggies in about a tablespoon of EVOO, half a cup is ridiculous. I also added fresh sliced mushrooms, cauliflower, half a small red bell pepper diced, two cloves of garlic and fresh parsley to the veggie mix. I used one very small onion (1 and a half cups is WAY too much for this dish)  To the cheese mix I added fresh chopped oregano, rosemary and a little more garlic. (About a teaspoon of diced garlic)  Otherwise it was pretty good. And the family loved it. I will be making this again. :)

As someone else suggested, I used a pckg of mixed veggies.  Also, 1 bell pepper.  I used pre-boiled lasagna and part skim ricotta.  Also 3 eggs instead of 4.  Brought the calories... down and it was delicious!  Not too saucy or too rich.  I will make it again.

I read some of the comments from other users. Under servings for every menu you have to adjust the serving size to acommodate how many people you are cooking for. So for this recipe adjust and the oil and all ingredients will be scaled down or up.

This was good but the amounts are all off.  I used 8 lasagna noodles instead of 2 boxes.  Next time i will chop the broccoli and carrots more.

Awesome! We meat eaters were pleased too.  I changed it a bit.  It seemed like the ricotta mix was going to be really thick with all the veggies in that layer, so I sauteed the onions, green peppers & some sliced & diced zucchini and added them to the spaghetti sauce.  Then steamed & cut the broccoli & carrots from a mixed freezer bag & added them to the ricotta mix.  I used half the eggs & less ricotta as noted in other reviews & it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious lasagna, but needed a few changes.  I had made it once with the full amount of ricotta called for here, but it seemed to be too much.  I found that half the amount sufficed.  Also, I used one egg. I used fresh broccoli, steamed it tender and put it through the food processor.  The carrots I sliced very thinly with the food processor and sauteed them.  I left out the bell pepper as I thought it seemed too much vegetables. To the ricotta mixture I added about 1/4 teaspoon of mace (you can use nutmeg), because the two flavors are a match made in heaven, and nutmeg appears in many lasagna recipes.  Overall a great recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this dish! I am a vegetarian and my family is doing everything they can to enjoy some vegetarian dishes with me. I came home to my dads house one day and he surprised me (and my brother) with this amazing dish! Thankyou so much! This recipe has been added into my personal family cook-book:)

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years - and it is always a huge hit!  My changes: I use precooked pasta sheets; instead of broccoli I add in 2 small packets of frozen spinach; I also add in fresh dill as it goes well with the eggs and ricotta. Another friend puts in cubed pumpkin in her dish.

It was okay, but not that great.  I think it was too heavy on ricotta and too short on sauce.

I made this last night and have gotten rave reviews by my meat loving boyfriend and coworkers. I did use part skim ricotta and mozzerella as well as whole wheat lasagna noodles.  As a true cooking novice I was amazed and disappointed with how the noodles stuck together like glue when I drained and put them aside:-) I did make some of the other changes to the recipe suggested by other reviewers including less egg and oil.  Very happy with the results.

I really wanted to like this recipe, especially since it took me over an hour to prep. I used all fresh veggies, used a very garlicky homemade pasta sauce, and cut back on the egg and ricotta (per other reviews), but that was all I could taste. All of those wonderful vegis and sauce were completely masked by ricotta. It did seem to mellow out as reheated leftovers though. Just a general lasagna tip, some people mentioned just using uncooked noodles. My mother used to always make her lasagna with uncooked noodles the night before and let it sit in the fridge--it gives even the edges that may not get a lot of sauce action time to absorb a little liquid. That is what I did and the noodles were just perfect, not mushy or too hard. I may try this recipe again, just cut way back on the ricotta and egg.

Good basic recipe but I had to add more spice and herbs in it. I added oregano,rosemary and white pepper and more salt and reduced the oil to 1 tbs.  Overall very nice and firm, not runny or too saucy.

This was pretty good.  I halved the recipe but discovered that I made way too many noodles. Half a 16 oz box of lasagna noodles would have sufficed.  I also diced up some banana peppers for the filling and it made a great addition.

Wonderful,healthy recipe. 12 noodles works perfectly - 3 on each layer. I made only 1 substitution and 2 additions: I had no parsley and used one t. Italian seasoning. I added 2 cloves grated garlic to the ricotta mix. I added 1 small jalapeno pepper to the vegetable saute for a little zing. 
You might want to take the chopped broccoli from the freezer and pour it into a colander first thing. I wouldn't leave anything out of this recipe except maybe 1/2 cup of the ricotta. Don't go with low salt on the spaghetti sauce or it could be lacking. I used Bartolli mushroom. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you so much!

A great recipe, although I did scale it down a bit. You don't need quite as much riccota cheese or lasagna noodles. Also, I used a frozen bag of california blend vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) and that worked great.

This was great but I did make quite a few changes: I used 15 oz. of Ricotta instead (because that's what I had, and it was great - wouldn't use more). I did not add parsley or green pepper or carrots. I sauteed the onion in a little olive oil (not a half cup), I then added some chopped kale and sauteed that too. I defrosted a bag of frozen broccoli and then put the broccoli, onions and kale in a food processor to puree it. I added half of this mix to the ricotta mixture and half to the tomato sauce. I baked for 45 minutes covered in aluminum foil and the remaining 15 minutes uncovered, broiled the top at the very end for a couple minutes. Will definitely make again!

LOVED THIS.  As all others said, some adjustments had to be made:
Used 2T olive oil.
Used part of one package lasagna noodles.
Added mushrooms
Added 1 zucchini, diced
Used more mozzarella

A great recipe!  I am not a very good cook, but this dish was loved.  I cut down the amount of oil to a couple of tablespoons, and added more cheese on top as others had suggested.  Next time I will try putting in spinach and tomatos, and possibly a little less green pepper.

This was surprisingly rich and tasty. If I were to make it again, I would omit the carrots - I didn't like them in there at all - and chop up the broccoli into smaller pieces (I used fresh). Oh, I also added a little garlic powder. Thanks, Kimber!

This is a very good recipe!  Very fast---I made this last night and totally forgot the broccoli (had just green pepper, onion, carrot and mushrooms) and it still came out great!  I did not cook the noodles first, but added 45 minutes to the cook time and they came out perfect...Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

This lasagne was very good, but it wasn't any better than the frozen veggie lasagne I normally get. It took a lot of time and wasn't very economical (I know that is the nature of lasagne).

This was really good.  I'm giving it four stars because you do have to follow the suggestions of the reviewers.  I used 9 lasagna noodles, oven ready.  I used fresh cauliflower, broccoli and carrots, already cut and bagged.  I saut√©ed garlic for two minutes in two tablespoons oil.  Added the chopped veggies, along with sliced mushrooms and minced onions.  Sauteed for five minutes.  I mixed 32 ounces low fat ricotta cheese and four eggs, Italian seasoning, parsley and black pepper.Mixed in the veggies with the cheese mixture as directed.  Put a cup of sauce on bottom of pan, added 3 noodles, covered with cheese/veggie mixture, repeated once with noodles and cheese/veggie mixture, then topped with three more noodles, two cups sauce and 2 cups mozzarella.  Baked one hour.  It was delish.

Excellent recipe, I too used just enough oil to coat the bottom of pan and only needed 1 box of wheat lasagna along with part skim ricotta cheese. I did add 16oz of Muenster cheese & 16oz of extra sharp cheese. My family loved it and didn't miss the meat either!

I sort of followed the recipe.  1 box noodles, 1 egg, low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta, I lowered the veggie amounts and added mushroom, corn, black bean, and zucchini.  I added spices up the wazoo, made my sauce from canned tomatoes and tomato paste, and added TVP for protein.  A good basic recipe that is easily adaptable.

Thisi was excellent and easy.  My son who is very picky about lasagnas, said it was my best.  I do agree about adding
more sauce and mozarella on the top. Also I substituted zuccini for carrots and added mushrooms.  Thanks for a family favorite!!!

I made this for a guest who doesn't eat meat. I grilled zucchini and used that instead of the pasta.  It worked well to bring the carb count down, but it took FOREVER to assemble.  Would use half the cheese and more veggies. The amounts are definitely off. Ours did not cook in the hour it was so thick. I froze the leftovers and will use later. You must add garlic!

A Surprise!  As I was making this, I found it not thrilling.  But once it baked, it was great!
  I used fresh broccoli (braised) which gave this ingredient more body.  I grated the carrots in error - I was switching back and forth between two recipes - and that turned out to add substance to the stuffing.  I'll "make that mistake" again.

I used 2 cups of Mozzarella cheese. It could have used 2.5 -3 depending on how you like your Lasagna.

It's hardy if you add lots of chopped vegetables.  I put the carrots and broccoli in the sauce and the onions and zucchini in the cheese mix.

Absolutely delicious! It was my first time ever making lasagna. I subsituted the ricotta cheese with cottage cheese and added spinach, and it was great! However I didn't need so many noodles like this claimed but I will use them for next time. I'll be making this all the time now

This was fantastic! The only change I made was to keep the ricotta egg and herb mixture separate from the onion and veggies. I spread the layers as described. It was tasty and held together beautifully. I'll definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe. The oil is way too high, I used a dash like as if i would to normally saut√© my veggies. And I added garlic and mushrooms. Also the noodles, I used 9 whole wheat noodles, for a 9x13 inch pan. YUMMY.

The first time I made it I used vegetables I had on hand.  I used cauliflower, carrots, onions and was going to use spinach but I forgot.  It only too 9 noodles and I left out bell peppers.  I also only used 1 container of ricotta and only 2 eggs.  4 eggs seemed like too much and I used 1/4 cup of olive oil to saut√© my vegetables.  This was a huge hit. My kids loved it and so did my lasagna hating mother.  I am making it again tonight.  This time with asparagus, cauliflower and carrots.  I'm doubling the recipe this go and am using a container of cottage cheese along with the ricotta.  Yummmm.

I tried this recipe and my family loved it! I did make some alterations to it, I saut√©ed mushrooms along with the onions, carrots, green peppers and broccoli. Adding garlic seems like a good idea too..will probably try that the next time.

Like many of the other reviewers said, this is a great recipe once you figure out how to put it together.  I added summer squash because we didn't have enough broccoli.  I used 9 no-boil lasagna noodles (less than one box) and created three layers.  I also put sauce on top of each layer of noodles and poured the remaining over the top.  I used some parmesan on top, too, since I had some left.  Will definitely be making this again to use up vegetables.

Good recipe! Made it for my vegetarian boyfriend and non vegetarian friends, and they all loved it!  Make sure to chop broccoli somewhat though before adding to the dish, because otherwise the lasagna comes out sort of lumpy.

This was pretty good.  I left the carrots out because they seemed out of place.  Next time I will add mushrooms and more sauce. My husband thought it was a bit dry.  I added 1T minced garlic and served with garlic bread.  Also I used the steamfresh broccoli which made it very easy.

This turned out pretty well, but it took much longer to prepare than the recipe claimed and it could have used more salt. Also, 24 oz of noodles was way more than I needed. 16 oz would have been plenty.

I made this dish for a vegetarian expectant mom and it was absolutely fabulous. Not being a vegetarian, I would have never thought to even try this delicious dish. This one is going into my recipe files and I'll be sure to make this again!
