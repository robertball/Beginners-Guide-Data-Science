This is an elegant and incredible recipe, the name "Chicken Monterey" does not do it justice. You have to make it right, if you don't follow the recipe don't complain. This is a classic french mushroom sauce and the flavors combine to make you nearly weep. I made this for a party I threw and didn't even try it till after the party because I had been cooking all day. When I popped a bite into my mouth I made noises that were, well, inappropriate. 
When you brown the chicken, do it in hot, almost browned butter to acheive the browning without overcooking the chicken. I think that may be where some people are complaining, they destroy the chicken before they ever put it in the oven. The sauce needs to be made exactly according to the directions. I will cherish this recipe in my files forever. 
-Oh yeah, I am going to try adding some diced green chiles next time, but only because I have followed the directions once already.

Fortunately, my husband and I raised our children to at least "try" everything that's on their plates. To our delight they've developed very mature palates and I knew that this recipe,with all of the wonderful mushrooms would be an instant hit. Although I only made four chicken cutlets I kept the sauce amount the same and used about 4 ozs. of cheese.  I didn't have any white wine on hand, however, I used a good hardy beer instead.  If you're not a salt person, leave out the celery salt; it won't make a difference.  This dish was delicious!

Thank you all for your great reviews....I agree w/ all of you that there needs to be more sauce, and I also double it when using breast halves and adapt as needed...more wine...less celery salt, etc - forgot to mention that in orig recipe, but as any good cook knows....you have to be able to adapt as needed to any recipe!!!! I love all the helpful hints that I get from the reviews of various recipes - I can tell who loves to cook and I am NEVER insulted when my recipes are critiqued!   ALSO, try using chicken cutlets, as they are thinner and take less time to pan fry than regular breast halves - and I add Garlic Pepper to the flour  to bread the chicken in b/c we love garlic, and I add about 3 cloves of garlic, and pre cut mushrooms will cut down on your prep time. Sauce is probably enough if you use the cutlets, as opposed to the breast halves, and you can cut down on the baking time if using the cutlets.  So glad that everyone has enjoyed this recipe, my best friend shared this recipe w/ me several years ago, and it has been a favorite around our dinner table!!!!  Doreen

This one is fantastic. My changes: no onions (yuck), used half pkg sliced mushrooms, only used 6 Tbsp butter, only used a sprinkle of salt and pepper (no fancy stuff), used more chicken broth instead of wine (didn't have it), used only 1 cup MJ cheese (misread recipe) and halved the chicken pieces (2 breasts, making 4 pieces). 
My husband and I melted into this.. next time will serve left over sauce with rice or egg noodles. I also soaked the breasts in garlic infused olive oil for a few hours before I started because I was worried they'd be dry like others have said. This was perfect. When you fry the chicken, do it over medium heat and just until the sides get pretty white -- I think actually browning them is what is causing the dryness. Don't worry, they'll cook all the way in the oven.

This was perfect. Thank you.

I'm going to have to give this another shot, because I wasn't too impressed with it.  The celery salt was very distinctive (and since I love it in bloody mary's I thought it would be good here as well- teehee) and it was very greasy.  Next time I will take Linda Mclean's review advise.  Thanks Doreen (& Linda too)!

Wow, what a great recipe...the only thing I'd change would maybe be to make more of the sauce and add more white wine to thin it out a little.  But wow, one of the best chicken recipes I have found.  Tried this recipe out on my in-laws a couple weeks ago and they are still complementing me on it.  A definite keeper in my recipe box!

This would have been awesome EXCEPT it was much too salty. I will make this again but use less chicken stock, no salt (celery or otherwise) and maybe add some water so the sauce is not so thick. Thanks Doreen!

This recipe is the best chicken dish I've found on this site!  Wonderful tasting sauce, moist and tender chicken.  Yummmmmy!!  I printed the recipe as is, but only used 4 ch. breasts (in essence, doubling the sauce), and used the sauce over rotini noodles.  I also did not have wine, so I used more broth instead.  Wonderful!!!!

Wasn't a huge fan of this one and I think it was because of the wine. If I ever make this again I would skip the wine. It was too strong.

So good!!!  Do yourself a favor and DOUBLE THE SAUCE, it is delicious.  I did a cup of broth and 2/3 wine.  Make sure to cook the wine down so it doesn't overpower the other flavors.

My husband does not 'do' mushrooms - so I did not use -I only cooked for two breasts the first time - I can see why many suggested doubling the sauce if serving for eight. The sauce is very good, however I added maybe a half a cup of milk to the sauce after adding the cheese, what I'd made turned out a bit heavy and more chicken stock would have made it too salty (I used a bullion cube for stock with the ½ cup water it was strong) I did not have any white wine on hand – but boy I will add wine the next time making this (next weekend!) I breaded the chicken with bread crumbs – but next time will use flour, as baking the breasts in the sauce – crisp of bread crumbs is neutralized. I look forward to using mushrooms when having family enough over to make more than one main dish!

Oh my goodness! This is a wonderful dish! So elegant and light and tasty! I split two large breasts and pounded them thin. Kept the sauce amounts the same. Other than adding some of Emeril's Essence to the flour, I followed the recipe exactly. Served it with rice pilaf and mixed veggies. Went down well with the same Pinot Grigot I used in the sauce. Great dish for company - you can make a lot of it (and the sauce in advance).  Do your sides while the chicken bakes. I'm definitely adding this to my "favorites" list.

Made this last night.  Actually, I browned the chicken in olive oil and butter the night before, made the sauce, refrigerated all and popped it in the oven at 350 degrees for 40 minutes the next night.  The only difference is that I used shredded Swiss cheese instead of the Monterey Jack.  It was wonderful.  Served it with angel hair pasta and broccoli.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Not our favorite.  I didn't use any additional salt other than what was in the chicken broth.  Used garlic powder and ground celery seed and was still a bit salty for my taste.  Maybe, leave out the wine, use low sodium chicken broth, and add about 1/2 cup sour cream.  Will stick with my grilled chicken breast smothered in white cheese sauce.

Made this for a dinner party & everyone LOVED IT!!  I did use extra mushrooms, sliced not chopped, since we love mushrooms and I also added extra chicken broth to the sauce as mine came out a bit too thick.  But this was a good thing since the sauce was so delicious it made more!  I had two people ask for the recipe at dinner, I will definitely make this again!

I made this during Christmas holidays when I had company.  It was a big hit.  I did not have white wine on hand so I used Sherry wine and it still came out very good.

This was FABULOUS!!! My husband and I both loved it. I used a whole can of chicken broth and no wine.  Also used a non-stick skillet and cut the butter to about half to save on fat.  I'd recommend this recipe to everyone!

This chicken stayed so moist!  We all loved it!  For the family's sake I sauteed the mushrooms as the recipe says with the onions and garlic but then set them aside.  I meant to add them back on the my chicken breast (the fam isn't a mushroom fan) before it's topped with cheese but I forgot.  So when it was done baking I just threw them on top of mine :)  This really is delicious!  Will definitely make it again!

I agree with other reviewers - you need more sauce and less salt.  This dish was still excellent though - my hubby and father raved over it!  I served it over rice with salad.  Yummy!

Very good.  I didn't have any white wine on hand, so I used 1/2 bottle of a lite beer and it still had the unique savory flavor.   My boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms, so I ommitted them.  Next time I will just have him pick them out because the dish seemed like it was missing something. I will definitly be making this recipe again.

This was a very good recipe. I did need to double the sauce because there just wasnt enough. It was a little cheesy but Im not saying that was a bad thing. I will make this again!

We really liked this.  I actually followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using 4 chicken breast halves instead of 8, and not measuring the presliced mushrooms I had.  It was really tasty, and I will make it again.

Excellent!  I did not use the wine but tripled the chicken broth.  I lightly floured the chicken before I sauted it; however, I think next time I will skip the flour.  Sauce is great over rice!

This was so very good.I did add a dash of hot pepper flakes and did not pound the chicken. I make a new recipe serval times a week, and usually toss them.But this one will go into my safe keeping file.I printed this out in 10/03 and just came across it in my stack.Looks like a few people have found it. LOL. Thanks so much Doreen for posting this.

I used 4 breast halves, doubled the sauce (but kept salt and pepper proportions the same -- used regular salt and pepper, as didn't have the special stuff on hand). Served over pasta, but might try rice cooked in chicken broth next time. Delicious!

I can't believe anybody would give this less than 5 stars.  I thought it was fantastic.  I made it for guests and even the kids who are picky eaters loved it.  This is a keeper.

I've made this twice so far and the family all love it.  The flavor is wonderful and the chicken is so tender, baking at only 300 degrees.  But I can't give it 5 stars, since the recipe definitely needs tinkering with.  I made it with only 4 breasts, but the same amount of sauce, as we wanted enough to put on rice or mashed potatoes.  I use celery seed not salt, so I didn't find it salty.  I also first browned the chicken, then made the sauce in the same pan.  This way, I was able to cut back some on the 2nd bit of butter, plus the sauce has the chicken flavor.  I LOVE butter, but this sauce can be greasy.  I also added additional broth and wine.  I may take another review's suggestion of adding sour cream.

This was GREAT! It wasn't to hard and the results were wonderful. The one thing that I do recommend is making a double patch of the sauce. I like my chicken smothered.

This chicken was wonderful! It was loaded with flavor and had a great sauce.  I didn't use the celery salt and I used low soduim chicken stock; so it wouldn't be so salty, from what the other reviewers had recommended.  But I think next time I will reduce the butter, it seemed like a little too much.  I'll definitely be making this again and I'd highly recommend this to anyone!

Delicious! Needed more gravy.  I dipped the breasts in flour/bread crumbs then fried lightly.
I have put in my "to make again" book.

This dish is superb.  The sauce is tasty, creamy and compliments the chicken well.  My husband was 1 hour late coming home so I turned the oven down to a warming degree and it was still delicious when we finally had dinner

This was so good! I followed the directions -except I used only chicken broth( my kids hate when I use wine in recipes). The chicken was tender, sauce was amazing. My 16 year old daughter said it was the best chicken she's ever had..she even stopped talking to eat dinner! I served it with oven roasted potatoes and sauteed green beans.

I would cut out some Monterey and use a little white Mexican cheese dip instead. All my guests were adding this on top of their chicken. Of course my family loves cheese dip!

I had to make a few changes for what I had on hand. I used boneless chicken thigh pieces. I didn't dredge them in flour I just browned them in some olive oil and garlic seasoned them with a little salt pepper. Put them in the oven with some colby cheese on top.  I then made the sauce following the directions except adding more chicken stock and omitting the wine. I served the sauce over mashed potatoes. It was absolutely wonderful. Will be adding this into my rotation.

This was just ok.  No real wow factor but after reading the other reviews of those obviously impressed, I'll try it again and see if I have a different result.

Boy did this turn out delicious! After reading many of the reviewers I made the following changes: use half the chicken, but keep the sauce the same and reduce the celery salt. I also used less butter in both parts to make it a little less fatty. I bet it would have tasted even better if I had of used all the butter. I don't regret any of these changes as it turned out perfect. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe! It has great flavor and is soo easy and cheap to make. I followed Cindy's recommendation and made the sauce ahead of time, boy did that save a lot of time! Great tip! :) I also omited the celery salt since I didn't have any and just used a cup of chicken stock and omited the white wine. I will definitely make this again. I only used 5 chicken breasts since there is only 3 in our family that eats.

This has a wonderful flavor!  Even my kids, who won't eat mushrooms, eat this up, without knowing they're eating mushrooms!  I think you only need to use 6 breasts for this recipe. To save time, I prepare the mushroom mixture earlier in the day, and refrigerate until ready to use.  If you do this, the sauce will be thicker, but it thins as it cooks.  My family didn't like it as much with the wine, so I omit the wine and use 1 cup of chicken broth.  This gives it a milder flavor. I also omit the celery salt and the extra cheese on top.  I have substituted cheddar cheese and, to me, it's just as good.  One more tip that makes it easier for me:  To get started,  flatten 2 breasts and put those 2 in the skillet to brown while you flatten the others.  By the time you pound the next 2 breasts flat, the first two are nice and brown, and so on.  Served over egg noodles, this has become one of our favorite meals!

This was a very nice chicken dish; I always love the extra dimension of flavor that adding wine to a dish gives and this one was no exception.  I used the full amount of sauce but cut the amount of chicken in half for three of us; used one large portabello mushroom and used 1/2 celery seed and 1/2 celery salt due to some reviewers complaining of too much saltiness.  In the future, I would serve this with rice as I think the sauce would be good drizzled over rice as a side dish.  Thanks for the good recipe, Doreen!

This was pretty good -- rich though.  Skipping the butter, I pan seared the chicken w/o dredging first in flour in a small amount of olive oil, then used the same pan to make the cheese-wine sauce.  I opted for reduced-fat cheese to save on those pesky calories/fat grams and didn't top the chicken with additional cheese as the sauce was fine as-is.  Might add additonal veggies next time - peppers would be good... thanks for the post!

I generally liked this recipe. The sauce is more onion-based than I like, however. I had to bake it at 325 until it simmered - 300 didn't seem right. Next time I'll reduce the onions and add some heavy cream. For some reason, it tasted better the next day - the flavors had time to meld a little more.

This was a pretty good recipe, although it tasted similar to a cream of mushroom soup topping covered in cheese that would have been much easier and less expensive. Still tasty, though.

This was pretty good. The flavor was good but it was waaaaay too much cheese, that's why I'm giving it 3 stars. I doubled the sauce like most of the reviewers suggested and only used 6 chicken breasts - it was plenty of sauce and made quite a bit extra, which was fine because I used it the next day and put it over rice for lunch! Many reviews said to put in a whole can of chicken broth, which I did. I'd probably add even more because the sauce was thick - like cream of mushroom soup! Oh - and cut back on the cheese - it was a bit greasy. Not sure I'll try this one again but I'm glad I tried it.

Sorry, I didn't care for this recipe at all.  The celery salt was odd tasting in it (regular salt would have been better), and there was way too much pepper.

Very good ... very easy ... esp if you buy the chicken cutlets!  I use more chicken stock (whole can) and less white wine (1/4 cup), but it still come out wonderful.  I also garnish with some chopped tomatoes and green onion.

This was awesome. I am not a big fan of mushrooms myself, but my husband likes them a lot. I am not a big cook eigther, but I loved this recipe and it was easy to make. Only thing I changed: love garlic so used 2 cloves, and love cheese so used a lot! I also used a whole cup of chicken broth rather than the wine. Will be making this for a long time to come. Thanks!!!!

This was fantastic! I read all the reviews before had and eliminated the celery salt and doubled the sauce. It was a huge hit and I will be making this again for my family and friends. Thank you Doreen!

This was delicious! I've also found that this works very well if you use red wine and mozzarella cheese.  A fantastic recipe, either way.

This was delicious! I used only 6 chicken breast and I doubled the sauce. I didn't use the wine. I tasted it first before I decided not to use the celery salt. I added 1/2 tsp. salt instead. I used all of a small can of Swanson low sodium chicken broth and used more cheese on top. If you want to serve over rice like I did, I barely had enough sauce for 2 portions even with doubling it, so I will triple it next time. We like a lot of sauce. Also served with a side of broccoli that tasted great with the sauce on it. Also baked at 325 degrees instead of 300. Very nice presentation if serving to guests. Doreen this was great! Thanks!

This was really good.  I made the same amount of sauce but only did 2 chicken breasts, and served some of the sauce over noodles.  I too had too add extra broth and wine to the sauce, but I think next time I'l use less wine to start and more chicken broth.  The mushrooms were a bit too winey. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! Really good dish but I think that next time I might try to cut down on the fat content by using a tablespoon of olive oil instead of butter. I know that butter adds flavor but I have to be alive to taste it. I may also cut down on the flour in the sauce.  It was a little thick.Other than that-this one is a keeper!

This is absolutely delicious!  I scaled it to two, but made the same amount of sauce.  There was extra, but it was great on leftover rice.  I used used 3/4 cup ea. of wine and broth, though, to thin the EXTREMELY thick sauce.

I invited my sister and her husband over when I made this recipe and I think he wished he'd have married me instead of my sister! They LOVED this recipe and so did I. Even my picky 4 year old ate this one.  My man griped about how unhealthy it was with all the butter and cheese but I love butter and cheese and I've already made this twice (with regular salt and pepper and chicken broth, plus extra broth to replace the wine which I didn't have on hand).  *****

I found this recipe to be very easy to make, and so delicious ...I did double the sauce, as my family likes a lot of sauce, plus the sauce tastes great on baked potato.  This recipe is a "Repeat".

Excellent recipe!  Have made it many times in the past and everyone loves it!  Always serve with asparagus and butter-whipped sweet potatoes.   And I'm a guy, but find it east and fun to make!  Just a slight change to the recipe though.  I start with a full glass of white wine...  just enough which is called for in the recipe but most of which is added to the chef!

This gets five stars because the preparation instructions were well written, allowing me to make a number of  ingredient changes. I used red onion, canned mushrooms,  and beer.  It turned out to be a fantastic meal.

This was so delicious!!! I wish I was rating it 100% on the original recipe as I hate it when people change things and then rate but, that being said, I didn't have white wine or chicken stock. So I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the half cup of white wine and half cup of chicken stock. As far as mushrooms go I used baby portobello as the flavor on those is amazing. I used 4 chicken breast halves as that's how many I was serving and kept the sauce amount as listed since I saw some previous reviews stating the sauce wasn't enough and that amount of sauce was just enough to cover the 4 half breasts. I also followed another reviewer's recommendation and lightly browned the butter in a cast iron skillet before adding the chicken. This allowed quick colorization without having to cook the chicken too long on the stovetop so that when I baked it the chicken did not come out over cooked at the 25 minute mark. I followed all directions and cooking times as listed and found this to be even tastier than going to a restaurant! I feel like I haven't cooked a chicken dish this yummy in a long time. I would even save just the sauce portion of this to use as a super tasty mushroom gravy for other dishes. I think serving this alongside some buttered egg noodles would be really good. I will definitely be making this again for sure.

Fantastic and pretty easy to make even for me! I'm usually a 5 ingredient or less cook. My family loved it and it was perfect for 4 people although my husband and my boys were hoping for leftovers. Tasted delicious even though I was missing the white pepper. I did take time to pound the chicken thin and cut the oven time down by 5 minutes. This will become a staple in our house.

I made this recipe, but I eliminated the celery salt.  I also added twice the amount of wine that it called for.  The sauce definitely has to be thinned out a little bit.  But, it was one of the best dishes I've ever made.

A real treat.  The second time I made this I followed advice of other reviews and made a few " tweaks" to the recipe.  (Yes, I know about those of you who scold folks who rate a recipe based on their personal changes.  I rated this a 5 star as written, and now want to make my personal recommendations for changes.  I always enjoy - and learn from -  others who take the time to write their personal hints and tricks to improve a recipe.). My changes: 1. used the amount of butter as written and did not think it was too much. 2. doubled amount of wine.  3.  Skip the part where you coat the chicken with flour.  This is not necessary and makes for shorter prep time.  Just brown the chicken  breasts in butter.  4. Omit celery salt. 5.  use 2-3 cloves of garlic.    6.  Did not pound to flatten chicken breasts. Just used thick, plump pieces and they cooked beautifully.  Husband loved this recipe.  Served with wild rice.  Thanks!  Will make again soon.

Love this recipe- I always make it when I've got time for something other then sloppy joes or turkey burgers. It definitely has a prep time, but your patience will be rewarded with a tasty dish fit for guests! I'm finding it odd that some people are complaining about the cheese in the recipe- when it's sort of the biggest deal to it, lol.  I don't change anything except the white pepper (which I don't have)- and it turns out great- I serve it with some wild rice and steamed kale and it's great!

My DH loved this chicken recipe.  I took some of the advice of others and left out the celery salt, cut back on the butter to make the sauce (used a little olive oil instead--still tasted GREAT), and I used a half a cup of monterey jack cheese in the sauce and didn't feel that it needed more.  I also used three cloves of garlic, and didn't have any white wine on hand, so I used cooking sherry.  I used 2 chicken breasts and cut them in half to speed up the cooking process and used the sauce amount in the recipe and it was just enough--so if your making 8 breasts, you may want to make more sauce.  I also browned them in the butter once it was brown--kept them moist and golden brown--yum.  My DH said this was awesome and wants this more often.  Next time I will increase the sauce and serve this over wide noodles!  Yum....thank you Doreen for sharing!

My husband & I loved it............The only change I made, was to make additional sauce. That is, possibly I made it too thick. But I just added more stock and wine, as it cooked, till it reached the consistency and amount I felt was right. My husbands compliments of the dish kept coming after every bite! Thanks for sharing!!!

Best chicken dish I ever had! Didn't have celery salt or white pepper. Added a little lemon-pepper and crushed red pepper to the sauce for a little spice.

I love this sauce!! My husband and I go to this place where they serve Chicken Pepperoni Monterey over Pasta and its amazing! So I've tried recreating it and it never was the same it now, cut the butter in half and just add the pepperoni in with the garlic, onions and mushrooms. Prepare the same just leave out the Salt, the pepperoni gives off the right amount of salt... Goes great with pasta or Gnocchi!

Made this with "fake" chicken, Worthington's canned meatfree chicken, and a mozzarella/provolone cheese mix instead of monterey jack and it was still DELICIOUS. Made more sauce than called for (adding another T of flour and a cup of water in addition to a full cup of wine and a cup of the juice from the canned "chicken"). Topped with panko bread crumbs instead of more cheese. Was salty so shouldn't add salt to flour/batter. Added minced celery to mushroom mix rather than celery salt later, and used oyster mushrooms. Served steamed broccoli on the side and might add that to the casserole next time. YUM!

I did brown my chicken then make the sauce in the same pan to pick up the extra flavor.  I made extra sauce and glad I did - it's really good.

We thought this was delicious.  Unfortunately, I didn't have mushrooms, which I love, but that's okay.  I butterflied the chicken, so two breasts fed my family of four and it only had to bake for about 15 min.-20 min., can't remember now.  I served with fake mashed potatoes (cauliflower) and steamed broccoli.

I wouldn't think you would want this much onion in it.  I didn't use any and had planned on putting in a little onion powder, but forgot.  I agree with others, it was a tad too salty.  Not as bad after baking as when the sauce was cooking, but next time I think I will cut 1/2 the celery salt.  May add some celery seed for the other 1/2.  May also make sure I use unsalted butter, or I may just use chicken broth instead of stock.  Stock seems too salty like bullion is. That may help as well.  I will save this one, and will make it again sometime.

Everyone really seemed to like this one.  per other reviewers, I made the sauce in advance and even browned the chicken a few hours before and refrigerated them until time of assembly. I had some leftover turkey bacon in the fridge and layered that on top of the chicken, then poured over the sauce and then more cheese, covered and baked until chicken was cooked through and cheese was melted. Loved the fact that no "cream" of whatever soup was needed for the sauce. It was creamy and thick and delicious. Served with herbed angle hair and a salad. Thanks!

I tweaked this a little...I skipped the celery salt and used sauteed celery instead. Subbed sherry for the white wine, because I had that on hand. And I skipped the mushrooms because the kids and I don't care for them (my hubbie does, but he wasn't cooking) :)
Thanks for a good recipe!

This was good except the directions weren't too clear.  Like the butter called out is 1/4 cup and steps 2 and 3 each call for a 1/4 cup.  Fight through the directions and you'll get a good 4 star chicken.

This recipe was a lot of work and not worth the effort in the end. The taste was just weird. I would definately cut back on the celery salt and the white pepper. I had to cook my chicken quite a bit longer than what the recipe called for. I served it with rice, but it would probably be better with noodles. I won't be trying this recipe again, I think it needs too many adjustments.

This is what I would call a dish for company (but I'm not waiting for them to come to keep making this!)  I didn't bother to pound the chicken, basically, because I didn't want the extra cleanup.  It was cooked perfectly all the way through.  I cut each huge mushroom in 16 wedges just because it gives it more texture and looks special.  Fantastic recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Really good. I used black pepper and a Pinot Grigio. It was just a tiny bit salty for me (everyone else thought it was great), next time I'll cut the celery salt in 1/2. I suggest you taste first then add the celery salt to your liking.

Mmmm....this was delicious. I loved the creamy sauce on the chicken. It reminded me of a milder creamy chicken marsala. I added another clove of garlic and increased the mushrooms I put in because I love garlic and mushrooms. This recipe is a keeper!

I didn't like the flavor of this at all - all I could taste in the sauce was the celery salt and white pepper.  Definately won't be making this one again.

This had an interesting flavour. My husband liked it but I thought it tasted kind of like chicken soup. I didn't bother with putting it in the oven and adding extra cheese to melt over the top.

This recipe turned out very well for me. I scaled it down a lot, 2 serving only. I served it with some nice steamed broccoli, and baked potatoes. Very yummy :)

I wasn't sure how to rate this recipe.  On the one hand, it tasted really good.  On the other hand, it took so much work, was super unhealthy, and the sauce was basically an onion sauce which I wasn't expecting.  So while it was good, I don't think I would make it again because I've made meals that are just as good, if not better, that were a lot less hassle to prepare.  But I suppose if you have a lot of time on your hands and don't mind eating something really bad for you, then try this because it does taste pretty good (if you're prepared for "oniony-cheesy-chicken").

Wonderful recipe, this tasted soooo good!  I browned the chicken w/o flour in olive oil, then cooked the veggies in the same oil, thereby cutting down on some of the fat.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, but that made too much, so I will probably make the amount the recipe calls for next time.  I served with angel hair pasta.  Fantastic!

Delicious!  Easy to prepare and not terribily time-consuming.  Followed the recipe practically to the "T".  Only exception - I used four chicken breasts instead of eight.  Just enough sauce for four.  Any more and you should double the recipe.  Served with butterred egg noodles, crisp green beans and garlic bread.  Will definately make again.  Yum  :)

I tried this recipe lastnight after reading all the great reviews. It was really good. Picky eaters loved it and are still talking about it this morning.  I used more chicken broth and no wine.  I added red and orange bell peppers for colour.  I also added a few more spices and a little hint of pepper to give it extra flavor.  I was amazed at how the chicken fried so well, follow the directions exactly for this and it should be fine.  Shake off all extra flour before frying it. I will definetly make it again.

I did not coat the chicken with flour, but rather seasoned with salt and pepper only.  Came out nicely.  My husband who usually turns his nose up at dishes make with "glop" went back for seconds!! Thanks for the recipe.

Really good chicken recipe.  Probably 4 stars for me but my husband RAVED about how good it was, so that gets it 5!  I served it with steamed broccoli and brown rice.  Mixed some of the mushroom sauce into the rice. Was a really good meal!

Good recipe, I agree that it needs more sauce doubled onions,used 2 cups canned mushrooms {we buy gallon cans ofmushrooms at Sam's club] used 1 cup of wine and 12 oz. can of chicken broth used 2 cups of flour with lots of spices, italian seasoning,basil, oregano,thmye,sage,dillweed,and put the white pepper and celery salt in flour along with fresh ground pepper, then used 3 tablespoons of flour mix in sauce  before coating the chicken. Also doubled the cheese in sauce and used 1 cup on top. Turned out great.

This was a good recipe, but I didn't think it was great.  I think I coated the chicken with too much flour. I had the chicken wet when I put it in the flour and patted it and topped it with as much flour as I could get on it.  I thought that it would make the chicken with a crispy crust, but it just turned out kinda mushy.  I will make it again, since the reason it turned out like it did was my fault.  The flavor was good and we did enjoy it other than the mushy flour stuff.

I also halved the amount of chicken, but used the full sauce amount. Also, I steamed about a cup of broccoli florets and stirred them in after removing chicken from oven. Served with white rice - really good!

My husband says this was like eating at a gourmet restaurant.  It was delicious.  I did add more chicken broth and wine (about 3/4 cup of each).  I served with Angel Hair Pasta.  A Hit all the way around!

Even my husband's picky best friend said this was AMAZING! I served with lightly buttered egg noodles and zucchini.  A lot of butter and cheese, but oh so good!  Thanks

Pretty good - not a big flavor though.  I will make again, but I will fry it longer - I fried until just brown and I think it needed a little more crunchy coating.

It was more on the salty side than I like.  But everyone seemed to like it.  My husband would like me to make it again.  I doubled the mushroom mixture and used half the amount of chicken and we still wanted more of the sauce mixture. Next time I will triple the mushroom mixture. I only used 2 Tbls of butter (one for each frying).  Next time I probably wont use any and just use cooking spray.

My husband and I loved this!  I didn't have any wine to add to it but it was still excellent.  Really tasty with noodles.  Would be great to fix ahead of time and then right before your guest arrive, pop it in the oven.

I didn't care for this recipe.  For the time involved, I expected much better.  The sauce was a soupy consistency--too thick.  I won't be making it again.

I loved this recipe!  It was delicious.  My 3 year old daughter even liked it.  I didn't add the celery salt, since I didn't have any, I added garlic powder though.  And I also added more mushrooms and a little more wine.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I was not impressed by this recipe.  It is not for the health conscious, that's for sure.  It has a good flavor, but we did not like how greasy it was (a lot of butter and cheese).  If you are going to make this, I would definitely lessen the butter and the cheese.

What a great dish!  I might cut down on the celery salt next time (great flavor, just a bit salty).  I used a package of white sliced mushrooms and they worked out perfectly.  And to make it kid friendly I used additional chicken broth instead of the wine.  Double the sauce - it is just too good not to have enough!  I will definitely be making this recipe again!  Thanks so much Doreen.

This is a GREAT dish.  If you like mushrooms, this is for you!  The sauce is wonderful, so make a little more, because when it's gone, you'll be wishing for more.  The sauce would probably be great on hamburgers too.

I cut the butter to about 1/3 of what recipe said and increased the chicken broth by 2. I still did not have enough sauce for out taste - I'd probably triple the sauce next time. Flavor was excellent though.

Although I don't have 'kids', I have two 18 year olds, the one that tried this, our daughter, really liked it, and she is so tired of having chicken 'all the time'.  My husband really liked it too.  The only comment I have is that I would brown the chicken first, I think that would make it perfect for my family!

I browned the chicken before putting it in the pan which probably made it a lot more work, however it was very good.

Excellent!  Will definitely make again and double the sauce portion as it was delicious!!  I used all chicken broth, regular pepper and regular salt and it was fine, so don't shy away from this recipe if you don't have the exact ingredients.  Yum!

Overall this is a great recipe. I made some changes to accomodate my children's tastes. I left out the mushrooms and cut the onion and garlic in half. We used all chicken stock and no wine. My 13 year old who won't try anything new, loved this and really surprised me. We will definitely be having this one again.

8-12-01   This was FABULOUS!!!  We all liked it, even my 4yr old finicky eater. I will definitely make this again.  It would be great as a company dish.

I served this at a potluck and everyone loved it.  I suggest that you reduce the amount of wine by 1/4.  It was alittle salty too so I would cut down on the celery salt.

this was a tasty dish, you can really taste the wine in the sauce, i would have liked it to be more creamy, but none the less, it was very easy to make, and i added a bit more cheese,,,yum!

Loved it, quick and easy.  Kids would like it, if you allow them to pick off the mushrooms.  It will stay in my recipe box, and be used again.
