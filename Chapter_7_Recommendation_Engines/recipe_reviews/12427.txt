A good pie, but I have tasted better Quebec's sugar pie. To avoid the pie being liquidy just add 1-2 spoons of flour. Also make sure that the sugar is well mixed into the cream before putting it into the oven. Bon appetit!

Great taste, but never solidified (if that's the right word), it stayed very soupy.  Eventually, after 2 days, it had finally solidified.  A little bit disapointed, but may try and make again, though i followed the directions exactly.

A agree with the previous review right down to in the fridge a couple of days later when mine finally hardened too. Mine never got 'hard' either. It was very sloppy.. the flavour was there.. a beautiful flavour but it was runny and 'syrupy'. I think I'll try cutting down on 'runny' ingredients the next time to see if it works.

What can I say? Sugar + cream. How can you go wrong with ingredients like that? The walnuts are the only thing that makes this one different than any other sugar pie. Also, no problem solidifying after a night in the fridge.

really good, I put it into the freezer a few hours after it cooled. It kept great, and when I went to serve it, it had a carmel solid top and a little runny inside, but everyone loved it.

I don't know what happened with this, but the pie filling became very hard and caramelly after it was cooled. Also, it was overflowing from the pie crust so that made a huge mess! It tasted good but does not look good at all.Not the best sugar pie I've made, and I'm from Quebec! :)
