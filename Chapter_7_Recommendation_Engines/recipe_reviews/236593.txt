Wow! GREAT recipe... so rich, tasty, and nicely textured, turned out BETTER than most any other banana bread recipe I've tried, and those were not gluten-free. Really fantastic. I did omit 1/2 cup of the sugar (so just used 1 cup), and otherwise made with very fresh, high-quality ingredients... this always seems to help (fresh GF flour, organic sugar/evaporated cane, organic local farm egg, etc). I did use 1 cup of regular-size semi-sweet chocolate chips (totally fine) and added the optional 1 cup walnuts.  Also, I baked it in a bundt pan... The recipe made quite a bigger batch of batter than I anticipated, and reading the comments about the longer cooking time and gumminess a few experienced, this seemed like a great way to "thin out" the loaf for even cooking and browning, and still keep a nice presentation.  It worked! Only added about 7 minutes extra baking time (~52 mins total).  Thanks for the recipe... I will definitely keep this in my files as a staple dessert and breakfast cake!

Just made this today & while it tasted good, it took over an hour and a half to bake this.  The directions are way off and after 45 minutes in the oven it was like soup!  If you are making this, allow for MUCH longer cooking time.

This was my first foray into GF bread baking from scratch.  I was very happy with the texture.  The taste was really good too, my whole family loved it, but I will add a little salt next time, I found the sweet taste to be somewhat unbalanced without salt.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a standard muffin pan, and baked it for 20 minutes.

I received rave reviews for this banana bread recipe! Only modifications were one cup brown sugar and I used vanilla bean Greek yogurt. Cooked it throughly and it's crusty on the outside and soft inside, yummy with a nice cup o' tea. Thank you!

very good fresh out of the oven, but it took longer to cook than the directions said. (coulda just been my oven..) anyways, it turned out soft and delicious inside and kinda hard an crunchy on the outside, served w butter, yummmmm! also, i used previously frozen bananas. seemed to work out just fine. 
and i used regular chocolate chips and that was delicious, there wasn't any problem of them sinking to the bottom.

I too had an issue with the bake time. Took it out and the center was soup. You should double the bake time.

This did not turn out great. I did make the following changes, maybe not wise...  cut sugar to just over 3/4 C., only had 2 bananas so added an additional 1/4 C. applesauce in place of missing banana. Baked for ~53 minutes, I live at high altitude and often need to bake things a bit longer.  I added about 1/3 C of blueberries instead of choc chips. About 1/2 C of walnuts. I didn't like the texture, kinda chewy. Could be a tad bit sweeter. Probably won't make this again.

I just made this tonight and haven't tasted it yet. Smells good but it took twice as long as directions say to bake.

These have great flavor!  I thought the consistency was a tad gummy, but I'm pretty picky.  Also, I didn't have applesauce, so I just pureed an apple with the bananas.  That may have affected the consistency a little.  All in all this is a great recipe and I plan to save it and make it again.
