I was hesitant about reviewing this recipe because I did change it to suit my families taste. With the changes, it became a 5 star recipe for us. I have seen review where people lament reviewing recipes that have been changed, but you know, thats just how cooking goes!! Unlike baking which is a formula, cooking just lends itself to changes. As Emeril says, " Its our right, its what makes cooking fun and personal ". In case your tastes are like mine- these are my changes: Used crushed tomatoes instead of diced,deleted the  tomato paste and kidney beans and used large shell noodles.

I'm sorry to rate this low but I've had about every kind of chili mac there is and this has the ingrediants but none of the taste.  It's not really chili mac without the flavor.   Disapointing

I gave this 5 stars because it was really tasty, easy and uses wholesome ingredients (no processed foods) that I usually have on hand. I substituted ground turkey for the beef and used cheddar cheese. I added extra cheese as a layer in the middle of the casserole since we love cheese. My picky eaters ate this! Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow at lunch.

This was awesome! For me it was just right from a Spicy Hot stand point. If you do not like the hot just reduce the amount of cumin. Otherwise it has a wonderful flavor and will make it again and again.

This was addicting!  It was one of my husband's favorite meals that I've prepared since getting married a year ago and I will definitely continue making it.

Made this recipe exactly as written, and it was very good.  This recipe does make alot, so next time I will freeze half, so we don't have so many leftovers.  Thanks for sharing!!

I tell you, my family LOVED this.  They ate the entire 9x13 casserole.  The only change I made, was adding "green" tabasco, only because I didn't have the can of green chiles.  It was a wonderful, easy recipe.  Potluck Heaven!

Everyone really liked this recipe. It was very simple to put together. I prepared it covered it and let it sit for 1 1/2 hours covered on the counter while I went to the gym. Popped it in to the oven and dinner was served. Will definitely make again.

We prepared the casserole the night before and the noodles came out horribly soggy.  Aside from that, the recipe was okay - nothing fantastic.

This came out great! I tailored the recipe to my family's liking: I halved most of the recipe, cooked in an 8x8, substituted chunky spaghetti sauce for the tomato paste and diced tomatoes, used a full can of beans, and a fresh green chili pepper. It was a hit, and is now part of my recipe box!

this recipe was good. i made a few changes as usual. i made a box of kraft mac & cheese (deluxe, family size) and added the beef mixture to that instead of just plain noodles. it made A LOT, so next time i will freeze half (especially since it's just my husband and me!). i also added a bit more salt and chili powder to bump of the flavor. i was also too lazy to put it in a separate dish and bake it...so i left out that step. will definitely make again. thanks for sharing!

Eh, good but not great..... Made this for dinner tonight. The entire Chicagoland area is under a severe blizzard watch. It's so bad, I worked from home and my hubby came home from work early. Not wanting to run out to the grocery store in this mess (are you kidding??!!?), I did a search that called for ingredients already in my pantry and this was the first recipe to come up. Ironically, this is the SAME recipe that's in my Reiman Publications Light & Tasty (now Healthy Cooking) cookbook. I had even marked the page this is on, anticipating to try it sometime in the future! While this isn't the worse thing I've ever made, it's not top on my list either. Both my hubby and I agree that this is SUPER bland. My hubby felt this was too "beany," but he's not a fan anyways. I usually alter every new recipe I try, but this time I didn't... well, sort of. My only change (if it can even be considered one) was to halve everythihng since I was only serving two people. Served with cornbread, this was a filling, but "meh" meal. Too bad. I had this in my recipe files for quite a while and was anxious to try it at some point (and it's healthy to boot). Thanks anyways, Marlene! :-)

I thought this was just OK. Followed recipe except used 1lb of ground beef rather than 2 because I just felt like 2 was too much meat. Overall the flavor was just not fantastic, but not bad either. I probably won't make again.

I also added delmonte fiesta corn. and the cheese top I put cheddar. I forgot the salt. I think I will add black olivies to it next time. It was very easy and ymmy, thanks

This is real comfort food.  The only changes I might make would be a bit more chili powder, and a bit less salt.  I served fruit cocktail with mine, and a chocolate pie for dessert.

Really good, but I used one pound of meat cooked with a packet of taco seasoning, and doubled the rest of the spices, omitted salt due to canned veggies.  I used Mexican spiced tomatoes.  Yum.  I think the recipe means 8 oz. pasta, not one cup.

Yikes! Too hot!!  We love spicy things, but the chilis was too much.  Would only ad a fraction of the can.  Otherwise after adding a lot of sour cream to tame it down, it was ok.

I'm sorry, but this dish lacked pizazz.  The ingredients are good, so maybe a different method of combining them would bring out more flavor.  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed and I won't make this again.

Made this for church and it went over pretty well.  I did not have any chopped green chilies, and used chili beans instead of kidney beans and it was great.  Next time I will probably not add the tomato paste because it seemed to overwhelm the entire dish and I had to add more seasonings, even brown sugar to remove that flavor.

This was very good. My bf loved it and raved about it all weekend.  We don't eat pork or beef so I substituted it with ground turkey. Also because I used ground turkey and wheat pasta I added an extra can of tomato sauce.  Wheat pasta usually soaks up all the goodness and requires extra sauce for my liking.

This is awesome comfort food, the trick to this recipe is to taste and season to your liking before adding macaroni.  The cumin is essential to the flavor of this, add (good)chili powder as needed. I finely diced two japalenos without seeds and sauted with the onions. Just enough to kick it up a notch, without being to spicy.  It makes a lot, great reheated the next day.

This was a great recipe!  The only thing I would change next time is the kidney beans.  They were very "meaty" and just didn't seem to belong to the recipe.  Personal preference, I suppose!  But otherwise, it was fantastic.  I had no leftovers!

We made it vegetarian with Morningstar crumbles.  Added extra cumin.  Didn't have the green chilis.  Kids loved it.  Never saw my son sit still and eat so much.  It will become one of our regular dishes.

This was a great recipe! We wanted to make dinner with ingredients we already had vs. going to the store. I probably doubled the seasoning & added a touch of garlic salt and garlic powder. I also added about a tablespoon of Williams Chili Seasoning. Very yummy. Definitely a repeat at our house!

This was a great casserole. I didn't have quite enough meat (probably only half or so), so I made up for it by using an extra can of beans. The other changes I made were adding some red and green pepper and leaving out the extra salt (there's enough in the canned tomatoes and beans). Next time I'll layer some cheese in the middle of the cassrole.

Really good.  I made it almost exactly as written (used whole grain mac and ground turkey) and took it to an office potluck.  My coworkers tore it up!

Am giving this 5 stars. My husband loved it, but thought that there could be more macaroni in it. Next time I will double the pasta amount.

I had to make dinner based only on what I had in the house so I did an ingredients search and came up with this.  It turned out really good!  The kids ate it right up!  I used turkey instead of beef and played around with the seasonings to suit my taste, and the end result was a good home cooked meal and the best part was I had everything on hand.  It was a nice change from the usual ground meat recipes that I always make.  Also, for us it's going to be enough food for 2 nights' dinner, so that's a bonus.

This was a really yummy, throw-together recipe! I added/changed a few things to fit what I had on hand...I only had about one pound meat (ground turkey) so I doubled the macaroni. I used stewed tomatoes instead of just regular diced & I used 1 can light red & 1 can dark red kidney beans. I also cut the chilies in half because I knew my kiddos wouldn't eat it if it was too hot. And they loved it! This was actually the first time I've been able to get them to eat kidney beans! Oh yeah, I also added a can of corn just to get an extra veggie in there! Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted to make a huge batch so, I used an entire box of macaroni, which may have been a little too much. Any who.. I used 2 packets of chili seasonings and I think I should've used 3 because of the amount of macaroni.  But, we still loved the recipe. Also, I used half italian sausage and half ground beef.

I used rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis since i was making it for the kiddos and thought a separate can of green chilis would be too spicy for them, turned out to be a nice amount of spice.  If i make it again i would add more tomato paste or possibly use velveeta nacho/mexican cheese as i thought it was a little dry-not enough binder. Good base just needs some tweaking to personal taste.

This was a very good recipe. I did make a few changes. I used 2 cups of uncooked mac and was a little heavy handed on the spices. It seemed a little dry so I added some beef broth. 
It was an easy, filling, and satisfying meal.

Pretty good.  I didn't change anything other than to add more spice than what the recipe called for.  Otherwise it would have been quite bland.  I think a little heat would have helped this recipe, it needed a kick.  I think I would make a few changes next time.  Likely change the amount of tomato and the type, wouldn't go with diced.

Casserole was yummy, I doubled the amount of chili powder and it was still mild enough for my 8 month old to eat.  Next time, I'll add more heat, as my family likes things a lot spicier. All in all, this is a keeper.

This meal was amazing!  It was cheap, fast and my husband thought it was the best casserole we have ever had!!  This was the first time I made it and messed up on a few steps and used black beans instead but it still came out delicious and there were lots of left overs.  My tip: use more noodles if you like noodles and more cheese if you like cheese. This one is easy to suit to your own taste.

This was good. I made a few changes just because I used what was already in my pantry. I used ziti instead of mac noodles, tomato sauce instead of tomatoes and chedder cheese instead of mex blend. My toddler ate it and hubby and I each had 2 bowls!

I also found the seasonings lacking. Added 1 packet of taco seasoning/mix and it made a big difference.  Could probably even use a little more next time.  Also added 1/4 teas. cayenne.  A pretty okay dish.  Personally, I don't think it needs 2 lbs. of hamburger, maybe half.

Definitely requires at least TWICE the amount of seasoning. I didn't have chopped green chilies and I used black beans instead of kidney beans. Added a little more noodles and little tomato sauce to compensate for adding more noodles. Good for a quick meal and most of the ingredients are already available.

Oh my gosh!  This turned out AWESOME!  I did not have any Mexican cheese blend, so I used shredded mozzarella mixed with chili powder.  The result was so yummy smelling, I couldn't resist trying a bit after it came out of the oven (I make casseroles ahead of time forhubby who works nights).  I loved it and the chili powder gave it just the right kick - will definitely be making this one again!

This is one of our favorite meals. This is much better if you use salsa in place of the tomato paste, double the spices and serve with a variety of chili toppings. I like to pair this with homemade corn casserole or Mexican Sunset Bread. This is also good with ground turkey. You could also replace chopped veggies for part of the meat, too. NOTE: You might want to cook the pasta partially before you add it to the casserole. It's always turned out better for me.

I was needing something different for the ground beef that I had and gave this a shot.  I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder instead.  I used a can of tomatoes with chilis and a can of tomatoes with garlic and onions and omited the chiles on their own.  Used mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese for the top.  Had one only 1 kid that didn't care for it but she was mad at me so you never know.  :)

I made this with everything but the cumin, used a can of mild chili beans and did the layer thing with cheese in the middle and on top. Turned out fantastic! Everyone ate it and I even got a "awesome!" from my oldest kid. They are all picky eaters so had to hide what I was putting in it until it was on their plates. Oh and I made the corn bread too. Thanks for a great, easy, tasty dinner!

This was okay. I personally think it needs a little more macaroni and less beans. I used velveeta cheese. My husband said this was a little spicy for him.

This was pretty tasty.  I did not have 2 cans of diced tomatoes and tomato paste, so I used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce, which worked well.  I also added more chili powder & cumin and added worcestershire sauce to suit our tastes.  I always substitute ground turkey for ground beef.  These changes made it more like the chili I make.    Will make this again.

My family really enjoyed this one!  I followed this recipe line for line and it ended up a little too spicy for half of my family.  The second time I made it, I changed a few things (cut out some of the spices) so I gave it 4 stars.

Not liking a thick sauce, I use rotel in lieu tomato paste and green chillies. Up the seasoning and add black olives, top with cheese rather than stirring it in.

Absolutely loved it! Will make it again.

I used chili pepper flakes instead of the chili powder.

Besides that, the flavor and spice was there. The layer of cheese topped it off.

Good job!

I read many of the reviews prior to trying this recipe and made the following adjustments:  used one pound of ground beef instead of two; seasoned the meat mixture with taco seasoning; used only 1/2 tsp of salt; substituted chili beans for the kidney beans. My family LOVED it and asked me to make it again next Saturday.  Great recipe...thanks for sharing!

Great base recipe, but like others mentioned, the spices need to be bumped up.  Instead of salt, I used taco seasoning and used a whole tablespoon of chili powder.  Add some corn and salsa, and you got something!

This is a good recipe and lends itself well to changes. That being said, I didn't have some of the ingredients so I had to improvise....I used two boxes of boxed Mac and Cheese - made to directions, I used 1 pound of turkey and black beans. Aside from this, I made it to "specs" and used York State Sharp Cheddar to top. Not bad at all and I will make it again!

Delicious and so easy to make.  I used a combo of reduced fat cheddar cheese and fat free cheddar cheese to lower the calorie count.  I also used whole grain elbow macaroni.  The family loved it!

My family loved it and it was simple to make.  I didn't have any green chiles on hand and used some green salsa.  It had plenty of flavor for my family and I spiced mine up with some hot sauce.

It was good the way it is written but even better with the changes I made. I used Bill Echols taco seasoning from this sight instead of the listed seasonings. This made it much tastier. Due to allergies I left out the onions from both recipes. And because I prefer my chili mac without beans I left those out also and increased the pasta. I also left out the green chilis for my mild children. We all loved it this way. Thank you.

I didn't use the tomato paste opted for 8oz tomato sauce plus can full of water. That's the only thing I changed.  Very good.  Even better on day 2.

This was a good recipe that called for second helpings! I used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes instead of the plain diced tomatoes and green chillies. I also left out the beans. It turned out spicy, which I had not expected. However, my husband and I love spicy foods, so it was a pleasant surprise.

This was pretty good. I didn't have the green chilies but otherwise, followed the recipe as written. It tasted fine, reheated well and was easy to prepare. 10 servings is too many for my family, so I cut the recipe in half and it was just as successful.

Very good. We used black beans instead of kidney beans and diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of adding the chilies and diced tomatoes separately. A good quick and easy meal that would go really well with a side of cornbread.

Pretty tasty. I added more cumin and chili pepper to it and liked it much more. Though I did cook it with ground turkey so that might be why I need to add the extra spices. So very yummy. Surely a keeper. My Faience even liked it and he is super picky about anything with spices and even a little heat! I also used Smart macaroni to make it even more healthier and again still yummmy.

I'm not a fan of kidney beans so I subbed a can of mexican style chili beans and used ground turkey instead of beef (just cause I had it)  This was a GREAT recipe. My husband also loved it.

This was an easy, good homey dish. After reading other reviews i too added more cumin and chili powder, plus a few dashes of tabasco and some lemon juice, which I have found brightens anything made with tomato. I stirred about 2 c cheese into the whole mixture, and then topped it with more cheese before baking. It came out like a spicy mac and cheese.

What a flavorless blah meal this was.  I was looking for something with good flavor, and this was not it.  I will keep looking I guess, this recipe was nothing more than a waist of time and food!

This was good and my kids even liked it.  I used ground turkey and whole wheat noodles to make it healthier.  I also added some chopped green peper because I had some on hand I wanted to use up.  Instead of tomato paste (which I didn't have on hand at the moment) I used 1/4 cup chili sauce which not only thickened the sauce but also added a touch of sweetness.  I kept the seasonings the same, but I doubled the onion and garlic.

I have made this several times now and it has become a family favorite.  It is a very versatile dish and can be spiced up or down according to your family’s tastes.  It can also be stretched.  I have made it with up to 4 cups of dry elbow macaroni and it was still fantastic.

This was very tasty with a few minor adjustments, I ended up using more chili powder, and did not bake in the oven in the end, just put a cover on the cassa role dish and put it in the oven on warm until the cheese melted. That way he noodle are not over cooked. My hubby loved it!

Our family really enjoyed this meal.  It was easy to make and all of the ingredients are things i had on hand.  5 stars for easy preparation. Even though it isn't "over the top" on the yum-factor, it is still really good and certainly worth making again.

This is one of my all-time favorite foods.  This is a great recipe.  I added a can of navy beans as well as the kidney beans and more garlic.  I topped it with sliced cheese because I didn't have any shredded cheese.  The slices made it easy to portion out.
