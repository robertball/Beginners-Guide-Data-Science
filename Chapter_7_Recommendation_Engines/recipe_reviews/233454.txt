This was nice, fresh and light! Two things I think this needed to make it perfect for us was a bit more olive oil (maybe another 2-3 Tbsps., I didn't measure) and lots of grated parmesan cheese. This would make a great side dish for any meat, seafood or fish. We actually preferred this room temp, as opposed to hot. I think next time I will add some red pepper flakes for a little spice. All in all, this was very good and I will def be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

A really creative take on the traditional "olio e aglio" sauce! The point of such a sauce is that you like and want the strong, fresh taste of garlic (aglio). These sauces are not for the faint-hearted. This definitely needs to be seasoned with more olive oil (should be a little shiny, not dry). The nice thing about an olio e aglio sauce is that you can add different herbs (fresh basil, parsley and pine nuts make it "pesto"; hot pepper flakes, oregano and parsey make it "puttanesca", etc. Olio and aglio sauces are not traditionally served with parmesan cheese, nor are fish sauces. Cheese is used with meat or tomato sauces, Alfredo, butter-based sauces, etc. Great recipe for summer!

This is one of my favorites and I can't wait I make it again this weekend. I added a little extra olive oil, diced Roma tomatoes and basil. My entire family loved it.

I made this last night, using 3 very small cloves of garlic, and my husband and I found the garlic extremely overpowering, ruining what sounded like a good dish. We did add parmasean to it, which made it better tasting, but too thick/dry. With the leftovers, I threw them in a pan for a quick fry, and added some almond milk to make it creamy. It cooked up the garlic to give it a very nice flavour and the zucchini still had a crunch to it. Next time, I'll still marinate it, but fry it up prior to adding the pasta to mellow out the strong garlic.

5-10-2016  ~This was a ho-hum dish for both Hubs and me tonight.  The grated zucchini gave this an off-putting flavor of its rawness and it was difficult to get it to mix evenly and thoroughly with the pasta.  Also, one tablespoon of olive oil was not nearly enough.  We agreed we would have much preferred pasta with olive oil and garlic and a side of sautéed zucchini.

Made this with whole wheat pasta and used more zucchini.  I've never been a big fan of zucchini but have to admit this was a great way to prepare it.  The zucchini stayed nice and crunchy.  DH really enjoyed it.

I only had one small zucchini, so I thought I'd try this recipe with reduced portions. Spiralized the zucchini to make "zoodles" then combined it in a large bowl with 1 1/2 TB of olive/canola oil, one clove of chopped garlic, a thinly sliced shallot and a sprinkling of hot red pepper flakes and salt & pepper. Let it sit for about 90 minutes in the fridge. Then made a small pot of orzo and added this to the bowl. Sprinkled with nutritional yeast (instead of cheese). YUMMY!

I make this often for my family that gets tired of tomato sauces, I like to add little butter along with the olive oil when sautéing the zucchini. I toss it with whatever pasta I have on hand along with parm, and even some fresh mozzarella 'pearls' when serving it cold some halved grape tomatoes or cooked artichoke hearts are a great addition.

I was very excited to make this being that I love zucchini and I had two waiting to be used. I guess because of the zucchini being grated up, it didn't have too much of a taste until I added some Italian dressing.

This was an excellent fresh recipe. Would be good served hot or cold and is easily adaptable for additions.
