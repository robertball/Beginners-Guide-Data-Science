I made this recipe tonight as my first attempt at making lasagna for my husband.  After reading the other reviews, I followed their advice and doubled the amount of sauce to two jars.  I also kicked up the garlic a tiny bit and used a combo of ground beef and ground, Italian sausage.  I found real, block provolone and shredded that, but I'm sure that it would have worked to simply dice up some sliced provolone from the deli, if necessary.  To save the mess of an extra pan to clean, I first sautéed the garlic and onions, then transferred them to the saucepot.  After browning the meat and draining it, I added the sauce and meat combo to the garlic & onions.  I also precooked the noodles about 5-6 minutes so that they wouldn't soak up too much of the sauce, and baked for 35 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered.  Perfect!  I was worried the whole time that the noodles wouldn't cook properly, or that it would dry out, but it didn't need any extra sauce on the side since I'd doubled the amount to begin with.  The addition of sausage and second jar of sauce was key.  Can't wait to have leftovers!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This lasagna was FANTASTIC.  I made a few changes, however.  As suggested, I used 1/2lb mild Italian sausage in addition to 1 lb ground beef.  I omitted the provolone, since I didn't have any left.  I mixed together in a bowl 1 500g tub of extra smooth ricotta and 1 250g tub of cottage cheese.  I added some parsley and black pepper to the cheese mixture.  I layered mine sauce, pasta, sauce, pasta, cheese, pasta, sauce.  I then sprinkled some grated mozzarella and a bit of old cheddar on top.  I used the oven ready lasagna noodles for this and had no problem at all.  Baked it at 350 for about an hour, uncovered. 
I actually used 2 8" square foil pans and for this recipe.  Had one the next night for dinner and the other one is frozen.  My boyfiend, who is Italian, LOVED this lasagna.  So did his mother!! ;)

Very good lasagna. Good idea on doubling the sauce and adding some italian sausage. Tip for those who don't want to boil the lasagna noodles...just soak them in some hot tap water for five minutes or so to soften them up. Works great.

I used my own homemade sauce with one can of drained no-salt diced tomatoes. I added about 1/2 tsp. of fennel seed to the sauce and I used fresh garlic. I also used small curd cottage cheese and I added 1/3 c. of Kraft parmesan cheese in with the cottage cheese and eggs. Really tasty lasagna. The provolone really was a surprize to me. It made the lasagna taste a little creamier, if that makes sense. I liked that when I made this, the lasagna wasn't too wet and it didn't fall apart when cut. I think using your own sauce is key.

I'm sticking with this one!!  I made it for dinner party and had nothing left but a smudge on the bottom of the pan.  The only thing I added was some mild Italian sausage for extra "bite",
Yum!

I have tried to make lasagna many times and this recipe has been the best and the simplest. I have found some good ones that just require too many ingredients. I do add more sauce it seems like the pasta and ground beef soak up the sauce and leave it dry so I add an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. very good recipe.

Fabulous recipe for a "Basic Meat Lasagna" and a great recipe for times when you want lasagna but don't have the time to make it from scratch! This is very easy to throw together and perfect for a hearty weeknight meal. So if your're in the mood for Italian but think you don't have the time - think again. I used 1 lb. of ground beef and 1 lb. of mild Italian sausage. I also doubled the sauce using Classico Marinara and added a little red wine and some fresh basil to give a bit of a flavor boost. I just layered everything as I usually do using no boil lasagna noodles which really makes things easy and topped it with a mix of shredded Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. Great with garlic bread! (leftovers freeze well)

Easy, good recipe. I liked the addition of provelone. I did stream line directions a bit to make it easier.

This was very yummy!  My husband and teenagers gobbled it up.  I did put an extra 1/2 jar of sauce as people recommended.   I also just cooked the meat, onions and garlic together then added the sauce ingredients.  The amazing thing for me was to precook my noodles or not since nothing is mentioned in the recipe.  In the end,  I did not precook them and cooked the lasagna for 45 min. covered and it was perfect.   I also split the recipe into two 8x8 glass pans so I could freeze one.

I have never made lasagna before and following this recipe was a great first start. It was very inexpensive. The directions were clear and precise. I added 2 mores cups of cheese and I used ground turkey instead of beef. I love this recipe. I will definitely make this dish again!!!

Very good recipe which I'll be coming back to again and again.  I'll be trying other lasagna recipes as well since this didn't knock our socks off but as the name says, it was a great basic recipe.

P.S. We added mild italian sausage to the meat and used a jar and a half of our favorite spaghetti sauce.  Instead of shredding the provolone I just laid out the slices -- worked great.

my boys, teenagers and i liked it...   sent gf pics during prep process and got grief for my onion cutting prowess, as well as lack of mozzarella on top, recipe doesnt call for it....    recipe also assumes you know how to boil lasagna noodles,lol....also division of oregano is left up to the chef,... i always try to  follow to the letter the first time i make and then improvise,  next time, mozz on top and will get onion cutting tutorial...

I have never made homemade lasagna before and was really nervous.  I followed the recipe except I did cook it covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 10 minutes.  It was fantastic!  I'm not one for overly saucy lasagna so I was happy with a little less sauce.  Those that like it saucy should definitely add more sauce.

Excellent recipe!  *TIP* For storing lasagna, in case you don't know already do NOT put it in the fridge covered with foil! The tomato sauce will devour the aluminum and absorb into the food.  Use plastic wrap or some other plastic material.  And if you cooked it in an aluminum pan, take it out and put it in something else before refridgerating! It doesn't take long for tomato based sauces like spaghetti sauce to eat away at that aluminum!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent and super-easy recipe for lasagna.  I used a combo of ground chicken/ground sirloin, added mushrooms, and doubled the spaghetti sauce.  I will be making this again.

My husband and I made this for a family gathering at our house.  It was our first time making lasagna for our Italian family and EVERYONE LOVED it! You definitely need to add more sauce to the recipe and it did take us longer to make than the time listed on the recipe, but we don't cook that much.  I will make this again and again!

This was VERY good...  Although I think there was a typo somewhere.  The recipe says to brown the meat with oregano and garlic powder, and to also mix the sauce with oregano, and then to mix oregano into the ricotta...  But there are only two measures listed.  So I just kindof guessed on the sauce measure.  I also layered it a little differently than mentioned in the recipe because I thought the ricotta would be hard to spread on the sauce.  It smelled delicious while cooking and was very tasty!  This will definitely go in my recipe book!  Thank you!

This gives you a good idea of how to do it ... I also used sausage instead of sausage flavored sauce, not as much oregano, more sauce and meat too, and skipped the provolone since I'm not a fan of it.

Pretty good lasagna, not the best I've had, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I will try it with provolone next time, as I didn't have any at the time. Really simple to make, and was impressed, as I had not made lasagna like this before.

I took some of comment advice and added more sauce. I used about 1 and half jars of sauce. I also used 1 pound of ground beef and half a pound of ground sausage. The lasagna turned out great! Everyone loved it and it was really great reheated as well.

This is my first time making lasagna and something about this recipe caught my attention. I managed to go to the local supermarket and gather all of their finest ingredients. All I can say is thank you very much my husband loved it! We topped it off with a fresh garden salad and some Moscato!

very easy to follow. i followed other reviewers advice by adding some italian sausage, but seeing as how sausage isn't a favorite of mine, i'm going to leave it out next time. the only problem i found was it was a little runny, maybe after soaking the noodles for a few minutes, i'll let them dry on a towel next time. all in all, very good basic recipe to tweak to my liking!

Great recipe.  I made this with homemade pasta.  I used the Basic Pasta recipe found here that was submitted by Pat  (great pasta recipe).  I used 1-26oz can of Chunky Vegetable spaghetti sauce and 2-8oz cans of tomato sauce.  I only used half of the provolone cheese called for because that is all l had.  I did not cover to cook because it seemed moist enough.  It turned out perfect.

This is was an awesome recipe. It was one of the best lasagnas I have had in a long time and it was fun to make. I had never used ricotta chesse before with the egg and milk, and i must admit that made the lasagna taste really good. I had only made lasagne one time before this for my husband 4 years ago and he asked me to never make it again. But after last time it seemed like he feel in love with my cooking all over again. So thank you for this wonderful reciepe.

I gave it four stars because I wan't sure if the noodle was supposed to be cooked or not.  I followed others' advice and pre-soaked them.  They tasted a little gummy-starchy.  I used two jars of Italian sausage sauce...added oregano, basil, garlic powerder...yum!  Thank you for sharing.

Thank you for your delicious recipe. This is the 3rd or 4th time I've made it. Each time it seems to come out even better than the last. The whole thing only cost me about 20.00 and for 4 people and leftovers that's not bad at all. I used a smaller pan this time so I only came up with 2 layers instead of 3, but it was plenty. Now I have extra sauce, cheese and ricotta mix to make another tomorrow (probably to just freeze) As my husband told me tonight it's "good stuff" ---- HUGE compliment. Thanks again.

Really good. I halved the recipe for an 8x8 pyrex dish – but I took other reviewers' advice on "doubling" the sauce. I used a full jar of sausage-flavored spaghetti sauce, 4 oz. of tomato sauce and a lb. of lean ground beef. Because I didn't really need to drain the lean beef, I combined a lot of the steps in one skillet. 
I ended of with the sauce base layer, plus two sets of noodle-sauce-cheese layers so that cheese was on top. Baked 35 min. covered, 25 min. uncovered. It browned up nicely, and I let it cool for 15 mins. so it would cut nicely, too.
I wanted to try it with part italian sausage, but I didn't feel like spending the extra money (an earlier attempt at lasagna was expensive and not tasty). I might try it in the future, but honestly making it this way was great – cheaper and a little less fattening, plus plenty tasty. 
Next time I will probably go ahead and throw in the extra 4 oz. of tomato sauce along with the extra spaghetti sauce. I haven't eaten a ton of lasagna in my life, but the instant I tasted this, I knew I was going to have two servings. And I look forward to leftovers.

I started using this recipe in '07, and ever since my friends and family beg me to make it. Hands down the best Lasagna I have ever had. The only changes I made to the recipe are I use two jars Bertoli Sauce instead of the tomato paste and 6 oz of Italian Sausage that I brown with the Beef. You must try this recipe!!!

I made this dish for dinner tonight. I have never cooked lasagna before. I'm not the very best cook in the World and I'm only just starting to improve. My fiance LOVED this lasagna and he is a difficult person to please. VERY difficult! He went back for thirds.
I gave this recipe 4 stars because 1. it took me almost 2 hours to make(prep time took forever) and 2. i made some improvements. After cooking the meat and adding the sauce, the meat didn't seem to have much flavor even with the garlic and onion so I added some creole seasoning and a chili pepper to spice it up. Then instead of using a whole tub of ricotta, I used half ricotta, half cottage cheese and even added some cream cheese. I was afraid the noodles would be hard but they came out perfect. I did not cook them beforehand. I also added a little bit of breadcrumbs and shredded parmesan on top before baking. I will definitely be making this dish again but hopefully it won't take me as long next time! :)

Loved this recipe! I've made it twice in one week. I add a lot more or I would give it five stars. I added a ton of fresh garlic (five heaping tablespoons, but garlic mellows as it cooks) and an extra onion, sauteed those before adding the meat, poured on the oregeno, basil, thyme, and garlic powder and doubled the cheese. But, I love my food really flavorful. This is so easy (even though it takes a little while to cook), that you can pretty much alter it to your tastes. Plus, I doubled the sauce and added a can of original Rotel--it may sound weird, but the lasagna had a very faint echo of spiciness which I really enjoyed!

Wow!  This was very good and quite easy. I soaked my noodles first, probably about an hour or so.  I also used more sauce and threw in some cottage cheese with the ricotta because I needed to use it up.  Other than that, no changes and everyone thought it was delicious.  Will def use this recipe again. Oh - used a lot less dishes too.  Soaked the noodles in the 9x13, browned the meat, onions, garlic in a skillet and then added the sauce to simmer.  Only one bowl for the ricotta/eggs mix.  Not necessary to mix the cheeses in a new bowl...just my 2 cents.  Thanks again!

This was a great recipe!  I couldn't find shredded provolone cheese (or even a hunk that I could shred) so I bought the 'Italian mix' of cheese from Kraft.  Next time I'll substitute Italian sausage for part of the meat to give it a kick!

Very easy to make. This was my first lasagna, and it turned out great.  I didn't use the sausage flavored sauce, and instead of provolone I bought an italian blend of shredded cheeses.  Very good!

This was good although I don't know how only 9 noodles was enough for a full sized 9x13 lasagna! I made a 9x9 & just had enough. Anyways it was good, I added some chopped sauteed spinach & mushrooms for added nutrition. Maybe it was that addition but I thought the lasagna was kinda liquidy. Other than that it tasted pretty good!

I took this to a party and everyone still keeps talking about my "amazing lasagna" months later.  I've tried the recipe twice, both times doubling the amount of sauce, and definitely think that is the key. Otherwise follow the recipe completely and it's amazing!!

This lasagna was my first and it turned out wonderfully as a special dinner for my guy.  I used 1 lb. of ground beef, two jars of spaghetti sauce (Muir Glen Organics) plus 1 can of tomato sauce, lots of fresh-pressed garlic, italian seasoning along with the oregano, sliced provolone instead of shredded (plus the mozzarella), low-fat ricotta, onion powder in place of an onion, and no-boil rice noodles.  The noodles did mush up a bit, so next time I may either use more or try another brand.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written, though I did streamline the process to use fewer dishes.   To save time, I prepared the sauce the night before, layered the lasagna in the morning, popped in the fridge and then into the oven in the afternoon.  Cooked on 375 for 35 minutes covered, 22 minutes uncovered.  This was a fantastic lasagna recipe.  Thanks!

I've been using this recipes for years now, and I LOVE IT!!  I use 1lb hamburger meat, and 1/2 lb Italian sausage. It’s perfect if you don’t have a garlic clove or onion.

it only misses out on the last star because i thought it tasted like stouffer's frozen lasnga and i personaly don't like it. My family liked it pretty well. there was something sweet tasting in it. I would suggest another jar of spagetti sauce otherwise it would be too dry and definitly add more noodles no one could find them. Might make again

This is so delicious.  I have never made lasagna before, and it is so easy.  However, I needed two jars of sauce, and it had to bake in my oven for an hour and a half.  But it is definitely the best lasagna I have ever had.

I love this recipe. It's easy to follow without all the 'a 1/2tsp of this here!'. I do end up using more spaghetti sauce and I use 1/2 beef 2/3 mild italian sausage. Turns out perfect every time! Since I only cook for 3 there's always plenty to take along the next day for lunch and it's just as good being microwaved the next day as it is fresh.

Genius!

Excellent lasagna without a lot of fanfare and so easy to make!  I have tried many, many recipes over the years and this one is not only a great starter recipe, but a keeper!  I also used two jars of spaghetti sauce as some reviewers recommended.  And, since I had some Italian sausage in the freezer, I added that to the ground beef.  Finally, I used cottage cheese (small curd) instead of ricotta to gut down on the fat/calories.  Delicious!

It made a ton- easy to make.  Very filling! 
Minus 1 star=Too bland for us. That's probably not the recipe problem, but my choice in sauces.  

I agree with other reviewers double the sauce otherwise it would've been too dry.  I also added a 1/2 pound of Italian sausage.  I did not cook noodles first and their texture was perfect.

This was a great recipe.  The reason I give four stars is because it came out a little dry for my tastes so next time I will add a little more sauce.  

It made a decent size pan of lasagna so I had some left over.  I made a smaller dish and put it in the freeze.  It froze really well and still tasted great when we ate it a week or so later.

It does one's morale a lot of good when people rave about something you've cooked, and this recipe will get you raves. I used 1/3 Italian sausage and added a half cup of cottage cheese, but the surprising thing was how people liked the effect of the sliced provolone cheese. I could not find grated provolone, so I had the girl in the deli slice some very thin, then made layers of that. People loved how every fork full had strands of cheese stretching back to the plate. It seemed to accentuate the cheesiness of the dish!  This is seriously decadent lasagna, and I'll make this dish for the rest of my life.

This was my first time making lasagna and it turned out amazing!used hunts garlic and herb spaghetti sauce and added 2 six oz cans of plain tomato sauce. Next time I will double the sauce so there is extra to pour over the leftovers when reheating. I also used 12 noodles. So yummy!

Very good recipe.  I would suggest adding salt to the ricotta mixture as without it, I find that layer to be a bit bland.  I add fresh basil and nutmeg as well; but that is just personal taste.  I make lasagna only a few times per year and this is the recipe I always go to to keep me on track.

This lasagna is so good! I've been making this for a few years now, and always have forgotten to review it. The only thing I changes I make is to add 1 lb. of regular ground beef and then 1 lb. of pork sausage.  its really good that way.  I also used sliced provolone and layer with the slices seperately from the mozzarella.  Everything else I make the same way pretty much.  This is a keeper!

I made this for the 2nd time. I made it for the first time last year. Both times were a hit! I made it for dinner last night and bought my coworkers in leftovers & they loved it! I did tweak it a bit. I used Prego sauce. I actually used two different kinds and I used one can of tomato paste. I did mince some garlic but I did not sauté any onions or peppers or even the garlic. I just put the garlic in with the ground beef and sprinkled some garlic powder on top of that is it. Then I drained the meat then added the Prego & Tomato paste. You really do not need much seasoning if you are using Prego. I used Prego Mushroom Supreme and Prego Roasted Garlic. Easy & DELICIOUS!

UPDATE: 12/2009 I had to put an update on this lasagna as I just made it again for my very first dinner party. I made 4 pans!! They were all delicious and a hit with my guest. Anyone who gives this lasagna a low rating is not being fair or do not know what they are doing! I saw some complaints about the sauce & the taste. That is the beauty about this recipe you can tweak it how YOU see fit. I follow the recipe exactly except I use 2 jars of Prego and 2 cans of tomato paste. Prego has a variety of flavors you do not have to go with "sausage" if you do not like sausage. The four pans I made were all different. I made one with ground turkey, ground beef, pork sausage and sauce & cheese. I have not made this in at least 2 years and it was still a hit! Try it you & your family or your guest will love it!

This recipe received rave reviews from some friends we had over. I took the advice from others and added an x-tra can of tomato sauce. I also cooked the onions and garlic in with the meat and drained it all together afterwards as other reviews had suggested. I used 1 1/2 pounds of hot sausage and 1 pound of ground beef. The tomato sauce I used was Bertolli with Garlic and Olive Oil added.  I added some extra spices to my taste as well such as thyme and basil. I also used the oven ready noodles and it worked out great. The cheese I used was a blend of six italian cheeses that was pre-grated to save some time. All the changes made it pretty easy to put together. I will make this recipe again and again. Thanks so much!!

OMG, this was absolutely heavenly.  I made this last night and my husband was in heaven.  He raved about it all night.  It was perfect.  I took the advice of others and used two jars of sauce and pre-cooked the noodles.  I also used one pot.  I browned the onions/garlic, added the meat and then the sauce.  Cooked for 15 min and then put it all together.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and it was yummy.  I recommend this to everyone.  I will definitley make it again.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe.

This past weekend was my first time ever making lasagna.  All I can say is WOW this dish is wonderful.  I along with other readers added Italian Sausage with my hamburger and used two jars of sauce.  My husband who is usually not a lasagna fan just loved this!!  I will be making this recipe over and over again.

DELICIOUS.  I added 3 Italian sausages (chop/grind well, it should mix evenly with the beef) and the meat was perfect.  I also added a lot of spices (basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, pepper, salt) to taste. I sauteed 5 tbs garlic with 1/2 tsp of the above spices and the onions.  When the meat was thoroughly cooked I added the garlic mix.  
For the sauce I used 16 oz spaghetti sauce, 5 oz tomato paste, and 8 oz spaghetti and basil sauce.  I added the meat mixture to the sauce and then added herbs to taste.
I used cooked lasagna noodles and topped with a parmesan/mozzarella mix.  Fabulous.  I think the lasagna would have tasted like frozen lasanga without the sausages, herbs, and basil sauce.

This was so good!  My husband has always said that he makes the best lasagna but when I made this, he had a look of defeat on his face.  I made some alterations: I used ground turkey instead of the ground beef, I couldn't get shredded provolone so I used 4 oz of cheddar 4 oz of monterey jack and 8 oz of mozzarella, and I used 2 jars of sauce.  The extra sauce that I didn't use in the lasagna, I served on the side.  I also boiled the noodles until al dente.  Delicious!

It tasted wonderful!! Made it for my boyfriend's family and it was a hit. Only problem was that I hated boiling the noodles. Next time, I'll try putting them in the dish dry and letting the sauce bake it.  Needs more sauce to cover entire dish. Lots of noodles left over.

This was very good. I made a couple of changes. I only used fresh garlic and I sauteed the garlic and onions and then added the jarred sauce. I added some red wine and fresh basil to that for better flavor.

The best lasagna I have tasted! (after my aunt's). This was my first time making lasagna, and I was extremely satisfied with the results. Since I do not like Provolone cheese, I just used Mozzarella and Extra sharp Cheddar. It was the best, I recommend it to anyone that would like to try it!

Seems like a good recipe but missing A LOT of important data like not using all of the ingredients because you will need them in several places (garlic, oragano, CHEESE).  The cheese was a big problem.  it  just says mix the chesse so naturally I mixed all the cheese which left me no cheese to cover.  Honestly Im a little mad because it this is my first time cooking and its a disaster.

Yummy. I also tweaked the recipe a bit too. I wanted more sauce but didn't have any more on hand so I used a can of original Manwich!!!! I also doubled the mozzarella. Wow this is gooooooooood!

This is wonderful.  I made some minor adjustments but all-and-all it is an awesome just as it is listed.  We use gluten free rice noodles and I can't tell the difference.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved this dish. I never made Lasagna before.  This was a huge success, and I sprayed my foil with pam spray before I cover it so the cheese doesnt stick to the foil. I cooked it for 45 minutes to 1 hour with it covered then uncovered for 30 minutes more to get the cheese brown. Yummy!

LOVE this recipe! This was the first actual homemade meal I ever made and I made it for my VERY italian boyfriend who said it was better than his grandmothers! The second time I made it was for his entire family (15people) and they all loved it as well. The one thing that I have changed is I use a regular spaghetti sauce not the sausage flavored. And 1/2 ground beef 1/2 sweet italian sausage insead of just beef. Looking forward to making it again soon!

My husband really liked.  Very meaty lasagna! I had to leave it in the oven for 10-15 minutes longer because the lasagna noodles weren't cooked enough.  Also, I added ~16 oz of additional spaghetti sauce.

This was great! Like many who reviewed, I am a first time lasagna maker, and this was incredibly easy.   I did alter the recipe a little bit...I used 1.5 pounds of ground turkey, 20 ounces of 7-herb spaghetti sauce and no tomato sauce (which I found to be the perfect amount of sauce), I added parsley, and chili pepper, and used Italian 4 cheese. Finally, in order to make sure the noodles cooked properly, I added 1 cup of water around the brim of the pan right before placing the lasagna in the oven.

I started using this recipe a few years ago and as other readers suggested I doubled the sauce, but it that is the only change.  Has to be the best lasagna I have ever made.  Every time I make it someone asks me for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing

RAVE reviews for this.  I made 1 minor change, 1 lb ground beef + 1/2 lb italian sausage.  The first time I made this my husband came in from the garage and said "What are you making!?!?  It smells sooo good!'  He loved it!  Its my stand by lasagna recipe and one Im always confident to serve for guests.  I need a few extra noodles to fill a 9X13 pan.

What an awesome lasagne recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I used 32 ounces of spaghetti sauce instead of 28 (and had just enough).  I also used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb mild Italian sausage.  I used fresh mozzarella and left the provolone in slices.  My husband thought it was the best lasagne I ever made.  My kitchen smelled like an Italian Restaurant.  Thanks so much Alysia!  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch!

I just made this recipe and it was my first time ever making lasagna.  The recipe was easy to follow and I thank everyone for their tips such as using the 2 jars of sauce (I did not use the can of tomato sauce).  I used two jras of Prego Italian Sausage and Roasted Garlic (prego was my childhood favorite).  I also went with the 12 noodles instead of 9, that worked well.  It has a delicious garlic flavor without being too overpowering.  Now I have 9 more servings to work with! I'll freeze some, eat some at work this week and hopefully get some to my family.  Thank you for the recipe, I am ecstatic to have found a lasagna recipe I plan to use for a long time!

The first thing my husband said after cleaning his plate was "You should go give that recipe 5 stars!"

I'm paranoid about undercooked lasagna noodles (mom's were always tough), so I half-cooked my noodles. And we only had 1/2 the mozzarella she recommended, but we improvised with extra shredded parmesan.

This one is a definite keeper, the best homemade (well, mostly)lasagna I've ever had. Thanks!

This was excellent.  I followed previous suggestions.  I used 1 pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound of Italian Sausauge.  I doubled the sauce and pre-boiled the noodles for about 5 minutes.  The provolone adds a great flavor and I wouldn't substitue.  Just buy a block and shred it because I've never seen it sold shredded.  This is my new Lasagna version - I've tossed the one I was using for the past 20 years.

I cooked this lasagna for Christmas Eve dinner and got rave reviews!  My husband said it was the best lasagna he ever had.  The only thing I did different was to use garlic and mushroom sauce and instead of 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of italian sausage.  It was awesome!  Thank you so much for the great recipe.

This lasagna was the best recipe out of 5 that I have had in my life.  The provolone added more depth, and this lasagna would definately not taste the same without it.  THANKS!

My family loves this recipe. For the meat ingredient, I used 1 pound of dark ground turkey mixed with 2 sweet Italian sausage links. (about 3/4#) I cooked my noodles for about 5-6 minutes and I used only one jar of spaghetti sauce. I know others used more sauce but maybe because I cooked my noodles, it didn't require more sauce. 
Love this recipe!

This recipe was great!  I did take advice from others and made extra sauce, which definitely helped.  I also added roasted herb and garlic flavored sausage which gave it that little extra flavor.

My husband says this is a keeper.  I did use Italian sausage and two jars of spaghetti sauce. Other then that it was done just as the recipe said.

I love this lasagna recipe. Easy and flavorful. I do mix in some extra herbs (basil, oregano, pepper) and parmesan into the cheese mixture.

This was great!  I made it two weeks ago and my family is already asking me to make it again!  I only made one ingredient change and that was to use sauce without sausage flavoring.  I also opted to mix all the cheeses together and make one layer out of them.  It was awesome!

This was my first lasagna and it turned out beautifully!  I made only one change: I was totally out of oregano so substituted it for majorim. Will definitely make this again.

Very good!  We're more of a seasoning fanatic so we added a can of italian style diced tomatoes, and used romano parmesan spaghetti sauce and a touch of salt, and added pepperoni to the top layer for a kick.  Otherwise, this is the best I've ever made!! Thanks!

Great & easy to follow!!! Pretty cheap for all the stuff you need. I think mine cooked a bit longer...about 15min. My changes: 1. I used turkey meat instead (NO taste difference)I have used a 1 1/2 lbs of meat before, just so its a bit heartier. 2. i used the no-bake noodles (saved time) 3. I didn't have any provolone, so i didn't use any!

There is nothing basic about this lasagna, except the ease in making it. my friend thought this was "store bought", because it turned out so well. This was my first attempt at making lasagna, and this recipe quickly became my favorite. I used a pound of ground beef, and a tube of sausage, plus, after reading reviews, I doubled the sauce, and used italian style cheese, which contains provolone as well. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe!  The meat sauce was wonderful and very thick.  I did add an additional jar and eliminated the tomato sauce and it turned out great. I added cottage cheese to the ricotta as well and that made for a nice smooth texture.  Very happy with the end result. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

My favorite lasagna ever! I've made it several times, but I never follow the recipe exactly. I've used ground turkey, all mozzarella, and added peppers and mushrooms to the sauce, as well as other italian spices to the ricotta cheese and to the meat. Freezes great, makes a ton--I use 15" x 10" dish. I think it works great with a jar of Ragu traditional sauce and almost a whole jar of Classico Tomato Basil while omitting the tomato sauce--they meld great together and give you more sauce which I love.

Loved it!!!  This is the first lasagna I've ever made, and I got rave reviews.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I did add a second jar of sauce, and felt it was very much needed.  I also added 1/2 pound of Italian sausage, and used 1/2 pound less of the ground beef.

I'm new to the cooking game, and my girlfriend loved this.  She asked me what brand it was, and when I told her it was from a recipe and not from the store, she didn't believe me.  The only thing I did different was to add 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound italian sausage.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!

I made this recipe with the exact ingredients listed!  I used the no boil noodles. This was some of the best lasagna I've ever had.  I made three layers total and the top layer was meat, ricotta mixture and then cheese!  I will be making this again!  Yum Yum!

Good recipe! This was my first time ever making a Lasagna. I've always heard that lasagnas are a lot of work and a lot of ingredients. I agree!!! However the finished product was FAB-U-LOUS! The only alteration I did was use half ground beef and half ground pork. I really wanted to use ground italian sausage but my store was sold out and i didn't feel like driving all over Chicago. Great, great recipe, full of flavor!

I made this 10/3/11. Used Newman's Sausage and Pepper pasta sauce. Didn't seem like there was enough sauce, even though I spread "thinly". Same with cheese, didn't work out to be enough for a 3rd layer.

Ended up making it a two-layer, but it did taste very good and was said by one to be one of the best lasagnas they had eaten.

This lasagna came out great! I tried using ground turkey instead of beef to cut the calories a little, and it's absolutely delicious like that. I baked it for about 55 minutes altogether, uncovered the whole time because I had run out of aluminum foil, and that worked out fine. I definitely recommend this to beginner cooks like me.

I added 10 oz of frozen chopped spinach to the meat sauce as well, it can't go wrong in sneaking in vegetables.  It is great!

This wasn't the best.  The only sausage flavored spaghetti sauce I could find had onions and bell pepper added to it.  We weren't a big fan of the bell pepper taste.  Probably won't make again.

This lasagna is yummmmmmie!! I made it last night and my guests raved about it.  I made a few changes. Instead of the 1 and 1/2 lbs of beef, I used 1 lb beef and 1 lb italian sausage. I used 2 jars of 24 oz sausage flavored sphagetti sauce AND 1 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I think next time I will add a second 8 oz can of tomato sauce to make a bit saucier.  The final change was that I used an 8 oz package of mixed shredded Italian cheeses because I could not find shredded provolone by itself.  It turned out delicious!! Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

I'm just starting out cooking, and this was a great recipe to make. My family loved it, said it was the best lasagna they've ever tasted. The only thing I would do differently next time is make just a little more sauce. The last layer was stretched a bit thin. But it tasted wonderful!

this recipe was absolutely wonderful. we absolutely loved it! my daughter is 5 and is going through her picky phase and she couldn't stop eatting it.  we are italian and grew up eatting wonderful foods, especially my fiance. he talks endlessly about his grandmothers lasagna (and all of her other recipes) and he said that this was on  the same level as his grandmas. he wants me to make it again over and over. my parents also joined in and my mom is a very picky italian eatter as she also grew up eatting her grandmother's cooking and she felt it was a very good recipe. she is a harsh critic and said that i should post a 5 star review on here to let everyone know that if you are considering making it, you should just make it, you will be very happy with the results and i know that this recipe will be in my recipe book

I made this as a 35 serving recipe and served it at a large gathering and people loved it.  It does make a LOT more than the servings actually suggest.  I did use more noodles and extra sauce and cut the fat some by using 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese.  It was a very cheesy lasagna with great visual appeal and bold taste.  Thanks !

Amazing recipe! I used only mozarella, instead of mozarella / provolone mixture, because I couldn't find provolone. I also used cottage cheese, instead of ricotta. All in all, it tasted great! This is a definite keeper and worthy of 10 stars! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Used 2lbs of beef as that is what I had.  Followed other suggestions and added 2 cans of sauce.  Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  Ended up using only about 3/4 of the sauce and precooked my noodles.  Very runny but really good taste.  Next time will only use one jar like specified.

This was a good lasagna recipe.  Instead of cooking the meat seperate from the onions and garlic, I just cooked it all together.  Also, I used extra spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.

I had never made lasagna before (I am not much of a cook) but this recipe was so easy and delicious.  As recommended I used 2 jars of sauce - my favorite store brand marinara.  I also did half ground beef and half sausage...however I used 1 lb of each because my husband wanted it meaty - it was good but maybe a little too much meat.  I added extra garlic and extra basil / italian seasoning.  The store only had 32 oz containers of Ricotta and I got distracted and used 24 oz instead of 15 oz - this worked out ok since I had used doubled some of the other ingredients.  Instead of mozzerella/provolone I used the packages of shredded Italian cheese from the grocery store which include those cheeses but also has asiago and something else I think.  My husband's reccommendation is to cook the onions a few minutes before adding the garlic to the pan.  I put both in at the same time and when the garlic started to get a little too brown the onions weren't quite done yet.  This resulted in some crunchy onions in the lasagna.  Despite all my goof ups it was still very yummy - a fool proof dish!

Very good lasagna.  The only thing I would do different is add a bit more sauce.  It tasted a bit dry, especially the next day after reheating.  Other than that, this is the best lasagna recipe that I have found!

This is a great lasagna recipe! My family completely loved it. It turned out perfect. The ingredient measurement worked out perfect for me. (just enough -no leftover)I used the Newman's Sausage and Peppers sauce. The look of the dish was very nice as well. Make sure to let it set and cool for a while once you take it out of oven. It allows all the "stuff" to simmer down -very easy to serve -not messy -stayed together. Plan on making this one for guests!

This meal was awesome. I found the reviewers' remarks to be very helpful.  I used 2 jars of sauce.  My husband is a meat lover so I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground sausage.  I'm from the south so I love for everything to be seasoned.  I put some garlic salt with bay leaves in the ricotti.  I also seasoned my meat with garlic salt, garlic powder and a little Lawry seasoning salt.  Only seasoned with small portions though (don't want the meal to be too salty). It turned out to be very delicious.

I served this to 25 people, it was fantastic. I mixed in some mild Italian sausage, instead of using the sausage flavored sauce. My husband said it was the best lasagna he's ever had.

Delicious! I like EASY cooking so I usually brown the meat with the onion and minced garlic-(from a jar) in a medium sized stew pot, drain the fat, add our favorite spaghetti sauce to the pot, and season with salt, garlic powder and oregano to taste.  I included chopped mushrooms and chopped black olives to the meat sauce, now the family won't have it any other way. I've also made this dish with cottage cheese in place of the ricotta cheese mixture and it's just as delicious! I always serve this dish with garlic bread, using the easy garlic butter recipe on this site.

After finding out after many years that my husband doesn't care for my lasagna, I realized it was time to try something new.  And boy, am I glad I did!  It turned out great!  It was so moist...the ricotta blend was superb, it was almost like a custard.  My husband went for seconds, which he never did with my "old" lasagna!  Next time, however, I may try it without sausage flavored sauce, maybe a marinara sauce...it's flavorful enough with the garlic and herbs.  I found the sausage flavor a little overwhelming with all the garlic and oregano, but that's just my personal preference.  Very delicious with wonderful texture!  Thank you!

I made this recipe as part of a class presentation for my wine class at culinary school. I didn't change a thing. I served it with a 2001 Fess Parker Syrah and got rave reviews from all, especially the two professors grading my presentation. And my very picky husband loved it which is a huge plus. It freezes very well. I usually make the serving for 10 and freeze half of it for another day. Alysia - you're aces!

This is a fantastic lasagna everybody.  Perfect for picky eaters too!  We've been gobbling up the leftovers.
I customized the recipe for a serving of 5 (small household) and used 1/2 lb of beef and 1/3 of Jimmy's ground sausage instead of sausage flavored sauce (just used regular spahetti sauce).  For those that are confused about the oregano mishap in the recipe, I used 1/2 teaspoon in all the oregano mentioned area's and it seemed to turn out just fine.  For anyone who had trouble finding or creating shredded provolone cheese--I bought sliced provolone and minced it into tiny squares--worked great!  

I hate trying to create my own meals, so this has been a real treat for my house.  Thanks Alysia for your recipe.
We in sunny california appreciated it.

I thought this was great, and more importantly my guests and hard-to-please husband raved over it.  One thing that was confusing is that oregano is listed in the ingredients twice, but used in three places (meat, sauce and cheese).  I wound up guessing, but it didn't hurt anything.

I'm not what I would call an expert lasagna taster but I think this was pretty darn good. I seldom order it in resturants but this recipe is as good if not better than the resturant's. I did change a couple of things... I added a package of Jimmy Dean sasuage and maybe a little more onions than called for ('cause I like onions). I also precooked the lasagna about 5 minutes in boiling water, just enough to make it soft and absorb some of the water. This prevented the lasagna pasta from soaking up all the sauce. This made the lasagna very moist and very tasty. My wife had seconds and said it was really good. I thought it was pretty good also!  This was the first time I've made lasagna and I thought it was fairly easy to make and it's as good as any you will find in a resturant!

Great Starter recipe.  I had never made lasagna before.  I hated all the pans and bowls and cut them down by sauteying garlic, onion, oregeno for just a bit, tossing in meat(I used 1lb ground beef and 1/2 lb italian sausage, but needed more meat) when the meat was browned I added sauce (used much less, we like it dry it cuts better and you cn always add more on top when serving. Added just a drizzle of the milk or the ricotta would have been too thin. I used a baking spatula to spread ricoota mix and it worked great. Thanks for the basics!

I have been using this as my basic go-to recipe for the past year or so and my family loves it.  I use Newman's Own Pasta Sauce and then add my own stuff.  Good basic recipe - good ratio of cheese to sauce to noodles : )

This is a pretty basic lasagna and really good.  It also freezes very well.  My husbands loves it.  I have a hard time finding sausage flavored sauce, so I get beef flavored and I usually end up using a little more than a 28oz jar.

I don't normally cook, especially things as complicated as lasagna.  But I made this recipe for my whole family one night and it turned out AMAZING!  (So amazing that my mom asked for the recipe!) The only way I modified the recipe is that I used 2 1/2 lbs of meat, instead of 1 1/2.
Although there were a lot of steps to this recipe, they were very easy to do and it tasted amazing.

Excellent recipe.  The only changes i made was to add one extra can (8 oz.) tomato sauce, and used basil and oregano instead of just oregano each time called for.  This had great flavor and was so easy to put together.

This recipe was pretty good, but not the best lasagna I have ever had. I did use an extra can of tomato sauce and sliced provolone cheese instead of shredded. If I make this again, I will omit the tomato sauce and use regular spaghetti sauce instead. I will also use more lasagna noodles. Make sure when it is finished baking that you let it sit for approximately 10 minutes. Everyone seemed to really enjoy it.

This was the first recipe I've attempted for lasagna.  I found a few others that involved dutch ovens that had great reviews, but I don't have a dutch oven and I didn't want to get TOO complicated on my first attempt.  I've made this three times and I have gotten RAVE reviews every time I've done it.  I made it most recently for new years eve dinner for my friends and again, it was a huge hit!  I didn't make that many changes, I used sausage instead of ground beef like other reviewers.  I also forgot to add the 8oz of tomato sauce but it wasn't missed really.  I did double the jarred sauce like most everyone else and even then, I was a tad bit short.  DEFINITELY use two jars!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Best Lasagna I've ever had.

My Fiancee made it for me for my birthday, and I loved it.  She changed a few things around though, such as 
1/2 lbs of Jimmy Dean Sausage and 1 lbs of ground beef

and the 500g of Ricotta and 250g of Cottage cheese.  But also kept the Mozzarella and provalone cheese the same.

2 jars of sausage flavored spaghetti sauce

Added some pepper to the mixture as well

Basically added a few of the other reviews additions together and then added a few of her own things.  
I come from a family that loves to cook (and eat) Italian dishes and to be honest this was better than anyones in my family.

I followed this recipe exactly, except for just using 1 garlic clove (& accidentally mixing all the cheeses together and adding more shredded cheese on top of that cheese) and it was great! Good flavor, thick lasagna. Yummy! Thanks!

I've made this several times and it always comes out a winner! I do use the 1 1/2 lbs of beef, but then add in a few links of broken up hot Italian sausage to give it a little spice. So yummy!

This turned out great.  I actually had lots of sauce left over so I ended up putting an extra layer of noodles.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I'm sure I will make this again, but I would probably add more veggies and spices to our taste next time.

This is a really great recipe.  I just added a second jar of spagetti sauce.  The next day it was a little dry for my liking, but the extra sauce made it perfect the second time I made it!  Thank you for sharing!

I like to try a different lasagna recipe every time I make it and this was one of the best! My 8 oz. pkg. of provolone was sliced instead of shredded and was the perfect amount to layer twice.  I did add a little water, just what I used to swish in the sauce containers to get out every bit of sauce.  Also, cooked about 15 min. longer covered and added parmesan after uncovering.

My boyfriend couldn't believe that I had never cooked a lasagna before! I added just shy of 1 pound of fresh itallian sausage, other than that I followed the recipe exact. I think next time I will add a bit more sauce and shredded cheese to the top. Super quick and EASY! I will be making this over and over again! THANKS!

This is one of the closest recipes to my Italian grandmother's.  YUMMY!!!!  I double the recipe and put in two foil pans and freeze one.  I do use my grandmother's sauce recipe instead.  I also just purchase sliced provolone and lay it on top of the mozerella.  Even my 6 yr old who hates pasta LOVES this!!  Excellent recipe!

This was my first time making lasagna.  I always thought making lasagna was difficult, but this was quite easy!  We almost ran out of sauce for the 3rd layer, so next time I will add another jar, as most people have suggested.  I will be making this again!

This is the recipe I will always use when I make lasagna - it was delicious!  Instead of the 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef, I used 1/2 lb of Italian flavored turkey sausage, 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of ground pork.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added a second jar of sauce and replaced the can of sauce with a can of diced tomatoes (drained).  Thank you Alysia!

I made this for dinner the other night and I served it to my Inlaws and husband and they loved it. I thought it was going to be good, but I still don't like the taste of tomato sauce. It was a lot of work for me, only because I strained the spagetti sauce to get the onions out of it. I did changed a few things on the recipe only because my husband hates ricotta cheese. I used half ground beef and half sausage instead of all beef. I couldn't find sausage flavored sauce so I used Ragu meat flavored instead. I left out the garlic and onion, only because I hate them. And I used shredded italian cheeses, with parmesan, provolone, mozzarella mixed together. I used the 2 eggs and milk together, but I had to used some kind of cheese to mix in with that so I had some cream cheese, (yes cream cheese) and I mixed it right in. It baked up very nice. I didn't tell anyone about the cream cheese, except for my husband and he just laughed. Thank you for the recipe.

The recipe was great... pretty easy to follow.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and it worked great.  I followed other's advice on doubling the sauce- it would have been dry without.  I would recommend using more noodles.  Otherwise we loved it!

it's the first receipt i read from allreceiptes.com, and it's also the first italian food i made!
i found this receipt so usefull. detailed but flexible.

i actually put 2 tea spoon salt into the sauce, but it was too salty, i guess puting 1 tea spoon salt will make it taste better.

Thank you Alysia. Now i have nice food to cook for my parents when they come all over from Hong Kong, and of course, for my girlfriend, heehee. Thanks!!!

I had my brothers and families for supper tonite and wanted to make lasagne but I've never run across a good recipe so searched AllRecipes; I decided to try Alysia's and it's definitely "a keeper". They all loved it and asked for the recipe. The next time I make it, I think I'll use Italian sausage to give it a little more spice.The cheeses were great!

The best lasagne I have ever had.  A tip from my nana use 1 lb of beef and 1/2 lb of ground pork it's an old family secret.  Another change to save time and dishes saute the onion and garlic then add the meat to that pan and cook together, it makes less dishes and infuses the flavour.  I added a little salt and hot sauce to the mixture.

Unbelievable! This recipe is wonderful. I made a few changes for convenience. I used Ragu Traditional sauce and only used 1 pound of ground beef and then 1/2 pound of italian sausage. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as it said. I made this when having guests over and they raved about it! It was time consuming to make, but worth every bite!

My family enjoyed it even though it was a little dry. To save time, I used the no-boil noodles and forgot to take into account that the noodles would absorb a lot of the sauce. I'll make this again and when I do, I'll add a little more sauce than what's required.

Awesome!!!!!!!!  I made a few changes after reading the other reviews. I made it with 12 home made noodles.  I used a 32 ounce jar of Ragu w/sausage, peppers & onions, plus another smaller jar of Ragu (traditional style) and the 8 ounces of tomato sauce.  I also added a small container of Light & Lively cottage cheese with the Ricotta mixture.  Turned out fabulous and wouldn't change a thing.  I will always make this one.

Wonderful!! I have never really liked lasagne before because I like a meaty lasagne. This was the perfect choice. I made this as a romantic meal for my boyfriend and he fell in love with it. Thanks so much!!!

I would save time and cook Onions in oil then add meat. DELICIOUS!! Use your favorite sauce. Next time I will add sausage and save a little extra before everyone eats it ALL!

Good recipe.  But it needed about 10-15 more oz of sauce, in my opinion.  As well as some parsley and crushed red pepper on top.

Made this last night and it was amazing!! Especially since it was my first attempt at lasanga.  I subbed out half of the beef for hot italian turkey sausage, doubled the sauce, used no boil noodles, and added a few extra cloves of garlic to kick up the flavor a bit.  All in all easy and delicious!

Great recipe and the family loved how little fat (really only the oil used for the onion/garlic and what's in the cheese). I followed all the quantities "as is" and it worked fine without more sauce although when making next time I'll probably make a half again of the ricotta mixture to allow another layer of noodles. Other change was I didn't have any sausage but the sauce needed "something" so I added some turkey pepperoni - perfect addition and kept the overall lasagne nice and tasty but not fatty. This recipe would also be fantastic with turkey mince instead of beef.

Very good, easy and basic recipe. I've made it twice, once using provolone slices and once using creamy havarti slices, plus shredded mozz in either case. I do not have canned sauce so I use 2 x 24 oz jars of Classico pasta sauce plus a about a half cup to a cup of water. Use half the water and 1 c sauce mixed to make very bottom layer & very top layer of sauce. Did a combo of ground beef and Italian sausage crumbles plus a small package of frozen spinach, thawed and drained, added into the meat & sauce mix. For me making in a 9x13x2 pan, this uses 12 lasagna noodles (4 side by side plus 1 split lengthwise and laid down the side of the others). Using the "no-cook" or "no-boil" noodles I don't pre-cook them, I just make sure every piece of noodle has sauce on it so there are no hard edges after cooking.  My sauce is quite thick with all the additions so I can fit, from bottom to top, 1 thin layer of (watered) sauce, noodles, meat/sauce mix, ricotta mix, light sprinkle of shredded mozz, 1 full layer of provolone or havarti (6 sandwich size slizes), 2nd layer of noodles, 2nd layer of meat/sauce, 2nd layer of ricotta mix, 3rd layer of noodles, thin layer of sauce, even sprinkle of shredded mozz, even sprinkle of grated parmesan. My 9x13x2 pan is filled to the brim this way. I spray some tin foil with nonstick spray before covering the pan to avoid the cheese melting and sticking onto the foil.  Baked at 350 due to dark nonstick pan.

I give the actual recipe s stars, but the plate that was before me 4 stars.  I have been laid out due to knee surgery and my husband tackled the recipe on his own. It was pretty good, he admiited to me later that he did mess up a little bit.  I know that if I had prepared it, it would of definately been a 5 star meal.  LOL

Another wonderful recipe! Instead of beef, we used ground turkey. Also made our own spaghetti sauce using the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipes from this site. I will be making this in the future!

Tastes great! Used italian sausage and 2 cans of sauce and added another layer of noodles. Let this set in the fridge overnight before serving, if possible, because leftovers tasted even better!

Very Good.  I am not a cook, but remember my late Mom's lasagna as being delicious and wanted to try to make it.  This recipe was very close to how my Mom made it, except I substituted cottage cheese instead of ricotta, as she did.  I was surprised at how well it came out.  I was able to follow the recipe very easily.  Thanks.

Yumm - I liked this recipe much better than 'Bob's Awesome Lasagna' on this site.  Granted, it's a little more work, but definitely worth the effort.  I added 1 lb. of sausage, and then used homemade spaghetti sauce (1 quarter plus 1 pint, sans meat).  This gave me a lot of sauce, so I decided to make two pans and freeze one for later.  I cooked a few more lasanga noodles (5 min. - al dente), added some cottage chese to the ricotta (only because I didn't have any more ricotta and was doubling it), and increased the cheese.  This is now my go-to lasagna recipe.

Yummy! I gave it a 4 because there is quite a bit of prep. It comes out wonderfully but be prepared to work which it does state 50 mins! I did not use provolone cheese only because I do not like it. I will make it again.

Incorporated suggestions from previous reviewers and it was a hit!!  Used 1/2 lb pork and 1 lb hamburger.  Used 2 jars spaghetti sauce (omitted the 8oz can tomato sauce)with par-boiled noodles.  Used small curd cottage cheese instead of Ricotta.

I just made this recipe for my grandmother, THE cook in the family, and she loved it!  Being new to the cooking world, this was very easy for me.  I did double the spaghetti sauce and added a little basil to the meat.  It was great!  Thanks Alysia!

My whole family plus the neighborhood kids loved this one!  Of course, I had to make some changes using what I had.  First I used half ground beef and half sweet italian sausage (just becasue I'd never tried the sausage before).  I used two jars of sauce.  And used chedder in place of the provolone.  Other than those few minor changes I followed everything else.  This will be my new lasagne recipe unless I get daring enough to try one of the others.  Yum, yum, yum!!!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Good for basic. Used mozarella and provalone combo that was preshredded. Also used sauce that had garlic chunks so I only added the garlic powder and onion powder. I know it will taste even better tomorrow.

I tried this Lasagna and I totally loved it! It has a very different taste, especially when you add the Italian Sausage Tomatoe Sauce that makes a big difference in taste. I totally recommend it!

HUGE hit with the whole family!!  I used 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground beef as other suggested and it added a PERFECT little kick!  I also used extra sauce as suggested, but I won't next time as I think I would like it a litle drier....not a huge tomato sauce fan.

Loved Loved Loved it. The sauteed onion and garlic were great. Used the  2 cups of the four cheese italian mix and 2 cups mozzarella. Still need to master taking it from pan to dish and keeping it in tact.

This was my first time making lasagna.  My parents absolutely loved it. It tasted like it was straight from a restaurant. Next time I might try adding mushroom.

I used this recipe the first time I ever made lasagna, and it immediately ousted my mother-in-law's signature lasagna on my husband's list of favs. I made no changes to this recipe and it was phenomenal as-is. I will recommend using Newman's sausage flavored spaghetti sauce, because it has nice slices of spicy sausage in it.

Awesome recipe and so easy!  Definitely needs 2 jars of sauce.  I also subbed the beef for ground Italian sausage and it was even better.  This one's a keeper!

This was soooo great!  I have never made lasagna that had that golden melted cheese look to it it was beautiful.  I took the other reviewers advise and made it with 2 jars of sauce and baked it for 35 min covered.  It was so good.  I also added a bit of Italian sausage.  This is a great great dish I highly recommend it

This was my first time ever making lasagna and let me say it was great. I added more cheese for my own taste but everything else I did to the letter. I will be keeping this one for sure. This would be great for those potlucks at work. Try it. You'll LOVE it.

This recipe was very good...it was my first time making lasagne and it was much easier than I thought...probably due to this fine recipe.  I added a little more garlic and more cheese.  This recipe has just the right level of moisture...so it holds together very well.  Will definately make this again!

I've never really cooked anything.  I made this in my dirty brooklyn apt. in an attempt to impress my lady-friend.  It worked.  The recipe is premium.  Add a side of garlic bread, a romaine lettuce ceasar salad and a bottle of red wine and you win!!!  My personal preference is to go heavy on the tomato/spagetti sauce combo.

Fantastic recipe!!  I made it exactly as written, except I used plain spag sauce (all I had!) & I didn't measure the cheese, so who knows exactly how much was in there. Made it for a dinner with friends...she makes lasagna all the time & her husband liked this better!  After dinner, she asked me for the recipe!  Will be making this again for sure.

This one is wonderful! The only change I made was to add more cheese. My entire family loved it.

I made this for my husband for his 31st birthday this weekend and it was a huge HIT!  I altered it slightly.  I took out the onions entirely and went a little light on the garlic, using garlic flavored tomato sauce in place of some of it, but regardless, it turned out awesome considering it was my first lasagna!!!

This came out very very good!. I would have rated it five stars but the cheese was a little skimpy. Next time I will know to use a little more ricotta cheese. But other than that I ae it for dinner and lunch the next day! It was great!

Very very good lasagna.  I did not put milk in ricotta cheese/egg mixture, and I did not use all oregano called for.  I liked the sauce flavor and quantity.

I wanted to do something special for my 'manfriend' (as my daughter calls him) for Valentine's Day and lasagna is one of his favorite meals.  I tried it long time ago and it turned out very badly.  I decided to look for another recipe and found this one.  It was WONDERFUL!!!  I did take a tip from some of the reviews and used two jars of spaghetti sauce instead of one.  I also used way more cheese than called for but, I love cheese!  Next time, to save time and pans to clean, I will combine the meat (I used ground turkey instead of ground beef) sauce, onions, seasonings and minced garlic in the same pan.  The only other thing I did different was bake it a little longer after uncovering it.  I baked it for about 30 minutes instead of 15 and it turned out great.  He loved it and said it was better then some restaurants.  Thanks for the amazing recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.

This is an easy recipe and we really liked it.  I made some changes.  I took the oil, onions and sweated the onions out and then added the garlic and cooked a few minutes then added 1# beef and 1/2# sausage instead of sausage flavored sauce.  Then added sauce, 24# oz of jar spaghetti sauce and 16oz of my sauce.  While this was cooking in the Dutch oven, I made the cheese filling.  I couldn't find shredded provolone so I took sliced and cut them up small then added pepper sand salt and Parmesan and a bit more oregano.  The mozzarella was just enough.  I always keep spaghetti sauce as extra for after baking.

Directions unclear. Did not say to use cooked noodles. Could have used at least 12 noodles for a pan this size. Need more ricotta at least double the amount. Used all fresh ground sweet Italian sausage. Needed  double mozzarella and provolone. All in all flavor and finished dish was good.

Haven't made it.  Recipe appears incomplete.  No mention on whether Lasagna noodles are boiled first before the pan or put in raw.  There is no mention of what you do with the ground beef after you brown it.  I assume you add it in a separate layer or do you mix it in the sauce?  Please correct.

Nothing like having a basic lasagna recipe. Depending on meats available, you can twig what you add by degrees. Anytime I make lasagna, I have to beat off the family to give it time to settle once made so it will serve better. Always a delicious meal. And yes always have more sauce than recipe calls for.

Will someone please explain why nearly every recipe that calls for browning ground beef with flavorful things like onion, garlic, peppers etc then calls for draining the ground beef. There goes the flavor down the drain.

if you are going to the trouble of making lasagna make your own sauce. note: you do not have to cook or heat up lasagna noodles, they taste better if they are uncooked and soak up the sauce while cooking. many different ways to make lasagna . depending on what you want. meat, vegetarian or vegan.

I didn't make this as directions were unclear and didn't say weather to cook noodles or not. Sounds like it could be a decent recipe but think I will stick with Chef John's. Always a winner.

Very good recipe.  I changed very little, but agree that directions could be written differently as someone suggested, saute the garlic and onions, add and brown meat and then add the tomato sauce to that.  Less clean up.  Other than that, I just added about 10 oz. more of tomato sauce, half of it covering the bottom of the pan before placing the first layer of noodles on top then poured the rest into the meat mixture.  Also added a little basil with the oregano.   Boyfriend who is not a huge lasagna fan ate almost 1/3rd of the pan.  May try again with Italian sausage, but either way, it's a keeper.  Thank you for sharing!

Just made this tonight and it was great! I too doubled the sauce and added Italian sausage (1lb of beef and 1lb of sausage) Also, I'm lazy and used all dried herbs :) Not only am I lazy but I don't know how to follow directions apparently haha..I accidentally mixed the ricotta, egg, milk, oregano mixture with the mozzarella and Parmesan mixture, whoops! Ended up being fine as I had plenty of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese to sprinkle on top and in between layers. I love cheese, clearly! Good recipe and will make again for sure!

I used my favorite pasta sauce (two large cans), and used two pounds of Jimmy Dean regular sausage.  I doubled the amount of noodles, cooked them until they were barely flexible (about six minutes).  I also doubled the amount of mozzarella cheese. Baked covered at 375 for 40 minutes, then 15 minutes uncovered. Was delicious and I have enough for a whole second meal.

Solid recipe for a quick lasagna when you don't have 3+ hours handy. I wasn't in love with the cheese mixture--it had a weird texture that I wasn't in love with. Next time I think I am going to try a different cheese mix.

Delicious. Not the most simple recipe but worth the extra work. Recommend using 2 jars of sauce and slightly precook the noodles.

THIS recipe was the Bomb! The only thing I did differently was added a half of container of cottage cheese. I made it for a friend and he liked it so much he took half of it home with him to eat the rest for dinner and lunch at work, days later he said it was still good. besides that, I love the fact that every bite he took he was be thinking of me! Thanks Alysia!

First time making my own lasagna, and I think it turned out awesome! I had 1 lb of beef n bought Italian ground sausage n mixed that. I couldn't  find straight provolone shredded, found a mixed 4 cheese Italian blend

Delicious & easy!  So good, my husband accused me of buying it because I baked it in a aluminum foil pan, instead of my usual lasagna pan, for easier clean-up! Nice compliment, yes?????

This was our Thanksgiving dinner this year as we were relaxing on the beach and no one wanted to cook all day.  This was the best lasagna I've ever made--lots of sauce, gooey with cheese, excellent flavor.  We don't like lasagna that you can cut in neat little squares like a cake, we like a big sloppy plate full of good ingredients.  A 9 x 13 pan fed 10 people with one little 1/2 serving left in a corner.  Despite the challenges of not cooking in my own kitchen, and not having some ingredients, i got creative and bought Classico sauce with roasted garlic and another jar of sauce that had herbs already in it.  Mosty people seem to think that lasagna takes all day and has elaborate preparations--this took me less than an hour to assemble for the oven, start to finish.  Really impressed the rest of the group!  Awesome aswesome awesome!

This was delicious and an easy to make.  I further seasoned the meat with basil, marjoram, salt, pepper and minced onion.  I also sprinkled basil on the cheese layers.  My new go to lasagna recipe.

I didn't follow the directions, just the ingredients list and this turned out delicious. Lots of cheese, the sauce tasted great. I used the oven-ready lasagna noodles, which I don't recommend unless you enjoy a rubbery texture. Definitely will be making this again!

My bf's family is Italian, so as you can imagine I was VERY nervous to make a lasagna. I cooked it for his birthday and he told me later in private that it was better than his mom's famous homeade lasagna!!! Thank you thank you for this recipe.

Even though I am a real big fan of lasagna...I hadn't ever made it home-made.  
So far, I've made it a few times & everything blends well together.
Although, I do not use the tomato sauce & add an extra jar of Sausage (makes a BIG difference in flavor!) flavored sauce.  One jar isn't enough at all.  Which is why i rated this 4 stars.  Not perfect..but pretty close.
Overall..I'm pleased with it & will continue to make this lasagna over & over!  Thanks for the great recipe. =)

Putting milk into the ricotta cheese mixture piqued my interest so I thought I'd give this a try!  It was really delicious!  Will do it this way from now on.  Thank you!  (No rating for this recipe because I didn't make it as written.  I only tried the ricotta cheese mixture portion.)

Fantastic! I absolutely loved this recipe. I followed it precisely.  However, I did not have enough meat sauce for the third layerr. For the serving required, I suggest another jar of sauce and another 1/2 lb of ground bee.  Otherwise, it was fabulous!

I sauted the onions and garlic in with the meat. Then added 1 jar of sauce along with 1 can of stewed tomatoes., tomato paste and parm cheese.  It was so hot I cooked on the grill.  I also skipped the provolone.  Next time I'll add more sauce.

Just wanted to say how much my family loves this recipe.  I am such a bad cook, but this has become what I'm known for - people love it!  We personally love the meat the best, so we do about 1 lb of beef and 1 lb of sausage, but other than that, we follow the recipe to a T.  Since it's just me and my husband, we normally eat it the first night and freeze about four more meals from the leftovers.  Makes for a really quick and Yummy dinner over the next few weeks.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I agree with the other 5 star raters.  The recipe makes a lovely, restaurant quality dish.  I believe the provolone, along with the suggested italian sausage/ground beef combination, is the KEY!  This one's the new family lasagna!

Easy and Fast receipe. My family loves it. You can substitute the jar of sauce for any you like. I also used the "oven ready" lasagna, and it made the receipe fast and easy to alter with your preference.

I told my boyfriend I would cook for him last night.  There were two problems however... 1. I was bragging about my mothers lasagna recipe and 2. I can't cook.  I didn't have the recipe and I needed help fast.  Thank you Alysia for stopping a potentially disasterous dining disaster from occuring.  The recipe was so simple that I didn't even mess it up, except for the noodles that fell on the ground.  Thank God there is a 5 second rule... The lasagna was great and we enjoyed it. I owe you one...lol.

I use this recipe as the basis of my lasagna receipe.  This recipe makes awesome lasagna, but adding personal favorites makes it better.  My husband married me for my lasagna.  Thank you Alysia!

Pretty good, we ended up eating it all.  I guess since I was raised on those frozen lasagnas that is what I'm used to.

This was a great starter recipe.  I'm eating it right now.  I couldn't get my hands on any shredded provolone so I skipped it and doubled the mozzarella.  Next time I'll keep the pound of mozzarella and add provolone slices (originally from WI-I LOVE cheese).  Used dried minced onion instead of fresh (didn't have any on hand), added parsley, garlic salt and fresh, and added a can of diced tomatoes to the sauce.  Used oven-ready noodles and cooked for an hour.  Almost bubbled over the pan, but this is some tasty stuff.  Will feed me and my roommate (a silly boy who doesn't know how to cook) for a week.  Thanks!

I made this for my family tonight (4 kids under age of 6, a teenager, my husband and me) and everyone LOVED it. My 5 year old who hates meat tasted one bite and then finished his plate. My husband not only had 2nds but had thirds. This is our lasagna recipe forever! Thanks so much!

great recipe, I changed the provolone to a cheese mix of asiago and parmesan and it came out wonderfully. This would really be good for a dinner party. I had no idea there would so much, I ended up having to freeze some.  I'm be eating this for a while but I'm not complaining =)

I made this dish for my family on Father's Day and everyone LOVED it!  To make it a little less filling, I used light ricotta cheese.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is simple and great. After the first time, you can play with this recipe so easily. Like now I add fresh basil leaves to the sauce, or I add more cheese, or just what ever. It tastes great without alterations, I just enjoy experimenting and this is so easy to do that with!

Thought this was very good...I prepared this a day ahead and refrigerated it so it took about 20 minutes longer to bake. Was very time consuming (as most lasagnas are) but worth the effort. Next time, I will use the no-boil lasagna noodles.

This was my first time making lasagna and although it was a bit time consuming it was quite easy.  The end result was very good and I will definitely make this again.  Since we love cheese, next time I will add a bit more to the recipe since I was left with a sparingly amount to sprinkle onto the top layer.

This was really good and relatively easy.  My family enjoyed this a lot so I will definately add it to my collection.
