This is so delicious, I should have doubled it. I almost didn't put in the bell peppers because I usually don't care for them , but I thought I should at least try the recipe first and I wouldn't change a thing! This is my new favorite recipe ever! I can't wait to have a party and serve this, you just can't go wrong with this, I love it and will pass this on to all my friends, Thank you so much Bianca!

With a couple of modifications because I didn't have all the ingredients, this recipe was so yummy it's replacing my current favorite green chile recipe! I browned the pork with about 2T chopped garlic (ok, so we like garlic). Added no bell peppers but about twice the amount of green chiles. I only used about 1/2 c. of Sherry because we were out and left out the oregano.

I never would have thought to use the cilantro and Sherry directly in the stew - what a wonderful taste - thank you Bianca!

Fantastic! This recipe has become a favorite in my house. 
I added 4 cloves of garlic and used chicken broth instead of water. I'll be making it again soon!

Excellent dish for potluck!  Very flavorful and fresh tasting.  Only problem is the salt tends to drop down to the bottom of the pot, so the final scoops tend to be very very salty.  Would suggest using less salt to reduce overall saltiness and get the most out of the whole dish.

Everybody says the kitchen smells like an authentic Mexican restaurant when I make this! I forgot the oregano and it is still fantastic. My only complaint is although pork shoulder gives it a great flavor but is a HUGE pain to trim and cube. You get about half the meat after you clean it. I'm experimenting with some other pork/roast cuts.

This has become one of my staples. If you can get it, use fresh roasted green chile (make a friend in New Mexico). I use half the number of bell peppers but  much more green chile. I never have sherry around, but I add a few slugs of rice vinegar instead. The longer you let it cook, the more tender it gets, but if you are starving or have a boyfriend who is pestering you for dinner, you don't have to let it cook the full allotment of time.

Yum. It was very good. I followed another viewers suggestion about cutting stew meat into small pieces and used green salsa as directed. It was fantastic. Thanks for the recipe I will
be using it alot.

I was so excited to find this recipe - I had a similar one from Sunset Magazine from back in the 70's, and really wanted to be able to duplicate it.  I used a cup of rice vinegar instead of the sherry, and used only three bell peppers, as the ones I had were very large. The original recipe I had was made with some kind of vinegar, probably cider, and in a lesser amount.  I am pleased to report that this recipe, as I made it, is exactly what I was looking for, and my husband likes it also.  It is fabulous served with sour cream and flour tortillas.  Some time, if we have sherry around I will try it that way.  In the meantime, I will continue to make this on a regular basis. Thank you for a great recipe.  This was like coming home.

This is superb!!  I added 3 finely chopped Serrano peppers with seeds for a little heat.  The chiles basically cook into the stew so it's not as hot as you might expect.  Next time, I might even put more in.  We loved it served with tortillas.  Be prepared, though, because the pork shoulder is a real pain  to trim and cube but it tastes great. Next time, I think I will at least get a boneless pork butt to save time.

This was really really good.  I cooked for about two hours and the pork turned out very tender.  I didn't use the shoulder but just a roast.  I cut the recipe in half, but still used two pounds of pork, and a bunch of cilantro, next time I will use more.  I love it. My husband said it was missing something, like being smothered in cheese.  But for a low calorie meal it was fantastic!  Served with a jalapeneo beans, tortillas and wheat rice.  Will be making this again.

I have made this recipe several times and followed the instruction exactly.  It is a wonderful and very tasty dish.  My husband doesn’t usually like cilantro, and with it cooked down, it wasn’t overpowering.  He even liked it.  We eat this with Spanish rice and homemade pinto beans.  The meat is very tender.

This was delicious!  great flavors and easy to make.  I used some boneless chops that I had on hand, so the cutting up part wasn't that difficult.  I did add some garlic to it, and several generous shakes of Adobo (Goya) seasoning at the end - wan't to punch up the flavors because I was serving it over saffron rice - came out spectacular.  They were fighting over the last bit in the pan!

I used a pork loin roast, trimmed of fat, and cooked in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  I also used garlic salt.  It was great!  I will say it was a little watery...all of the vegetables give off their own liquid, in addition to the liquid you add.  Next time, I might experiment with less water.

Excellent and very easy (with the exception of cutting the meat off of the roast)  It reminded me a lot of carnitas.  I typically don't associate sherry with a mexican dish, but it worked wonderfully.  It also was a hit with my husband who typically doesn't care of the spicy flavor of mexican food.  Yet, it had just enough punch for me . . .will make again.

I left out the bell peppers and used fresh frozen hatch chiles in place of canned. I also substituted chicken broth for the water and the cooking sherry and used cumin in place of oregano. I know I changed it a bit but all in all it turned out delicious.

Excellent recipe! I roasted the bell peppers first and peeled the skin then chopped them, added 3 cloves of garlic (minced) and a 2 tablespoons of lime juice. Instead of letting it simmer in the pan I moved it into my crock pot and set it on high for 2 1/2 hours. My entire family loved it! I'll be making this again!!

This recipe is one of this family's favorites!  It's a bit mild for us as written, so I usually add a bit of jalepeno pepper for some extra kick.  It smells great while cooking, freezes beautifully, and makes my husband happy every time I serve it.  Yay Bianca!  You've got a winner!

Exciting flavors from following the recipe exactly. Next time I will add diced green serrano peppers to give more heat. Freezes and reheats well. Thank you for a great recipe.

I would highly recommend subbing anaheim peppers for the bell peppers... I did, and it was fantastic!!  Also used vermouth because I didn't have any sherry on hand.  Very, very tasty!

this was awesome!!!!  I had to use red wine instead of sherry.  I didn't use salt.  I cooked it the day before I served it and that may be what made it extra delicious as many stew type meals are best the next day.  Definetely a do again,and again and again......

I was surprised just how good this was! We used fresh chile peppers instead of canned green chiles, since those are hard to find here in Germany. My husband loved it. We'll definitely make this again.

This was really good! A bit of a variation from the green chile pork I've had before in that it was a bit sweet and tangy. Alterations I made: used chicken broth instead of water (next time, will only put a pinch of salt if I do this again as it was a little salty - and I like salt). I didn't have enough cooking sherry, so I used half cooking wine and half rice wine vinegar. (I think the cooking wine made it come out a little sweet.) I also only used 2 green peppers, but would probably increase this next time. I worried it would overpower the rest of it, but they just melt into nothing and work well with the rest. Overall, a really simple and great dish. The pork came out super tender. Will definitely do it again.

This was pretty good - though you have to take my rating with a pinch of salt.  I didn't have a can of green chilies (dang hubby used them when I wasn't looking!), so I chopped up a couple of Thai Dragons from my garden - wasn't enough.  Also, my cilantro has died with the seasonal cold, so I used dried.  I had less meat, so cooked shorter.  If hubby had gotten home earlier, the meat would have been perfectly tender - but it went a bit longer (on a lower temp) and dried out a bit, though still fairly moist.  On the whole, this is worth trying again, but I'll want to make a few changes - and I should have topped with sour cream!  (Didn't have it on hand.)  ---  OH!  And I also served this as a "stew" rather than in tortillas.  Might have made a difference??

This was very good!  The only changes I made were to use 2 green peppers and less pork.  I cut up some pork chops I had in the freezer and they ended up nice and tender.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time I will add another serano pepper to spice it up!

My family loved this recipe.  I used a pork tenderloin because I had it on hand.  I chopped it up small.  I used only one very large green pepper because it seemed to be enough for our taste. I served it wrapped in warm tortillas with a chipotle flavored mayo/sour cream combination.  It was terrific!  Thank you.

This is one of my favorite all-time recipes. I've been making this for several years now and I never get tired of it. My husband loves it, too. I scale it down for two of us, so I tend to use a pork shoulder or chop. I also don't cook it as long, considering the cut of meat I'm using.

I'll make this again. I did add some ground Aleppo pepper, since I didn't have a big enough can of peppers. I also saved a bit of the cilantro to sprinkle on the top when I served it - with sour cream, of course!

When I was learning how to make green Chile this recipe became my go to for ingredients. The only thing I change is my seasonings and how hot I want it for each batch. It’s always a hit.

This makes Ah-MAZE-ing Green Chile! I’ve made it numerous times and it’s great as is or with variations. I use more green chiles, less bell pepper, lots of garlic, beef or chicken broth, more liquid and sherry, because we like to thicken it at the end and use the sauce to top burritos. I also shred and add the cilantro stems as they’re loaded with flavor and melt in the sauce during the long cook time. I’ve used different cuts of pork and think it’s just as good with pork loin or lean pork chops ... Lots easier to prepare with less fat running through. I’ve never had a miss with this one. It’s super forgiving as long as you include the sherry and cilantro.

I was surprised they used green bell pepper AND cooking sherry, and cilantro is a very strong herb.

Wow! Thank you, Bianca. I've been making this for three years and doubling the recipe. As a result, our kids think I make amazing Mexican food. The first two years I started with braised pork shoulder, and this became one of our favorite family recipes for Sunday dinners. This year our method has changed. We grill twice as many pork chops with rub the night before and dice up the leftover chops the second night. I add them after Bianca's mix has cooked for 2.5 hours. Our family loves to use any leftover pork and green chilies on eggs/tortillas for breakfast. This recipe gets better each with each meal.

This was supergood.  I think I cut the pieces too small.  Next time I'll have to remember that the pork shrinks when its cooked ALOT.
