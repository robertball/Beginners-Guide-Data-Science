This is a great dressing.  I prefer fresh garlic over garlic powder so I used one clove of garlic through my garlic press and I upped the white balsamic a bit because I found it a little too oily for my taste, but I'll bet it is good without my changes.

This is an excellent dressing -- so quick and easy to whip up and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I've made it several times. Nice and light to have on a salad when you are having a main dish with a creamy type sauce.

I did like this vinaigrette!  I thought I'd have to add more vinegar, but I didn't.  The mix is a rather common proportion of olive oil to vinegar.  I'm rating it a 4 instead of a 5 only because I think that there will be a number of people who will say it's too sweet and some who will think that there's not enough flavor.  It's a mild flavor for sure.  I must admit to having used lemon olive oil, and that's probably the reason I loved it.  I would think that those who love the taste of the salad rather than he dressing would agree that this is great.  I would recommend it for sure, and I'm also positive that my DIL will agree that it's wonderful!  Thanks, Becky!  EDIT THE NEXT DAY!  I changed my rating to a 5!  :)

I liked it but I found it just a tad too sweet. I made three changes...I cut the honey back to 2 tsp, added 2 large cloves of garlic (micro planed) and added a tsp of dijon mustard.  The sugar content in balsamic vinegar varies widely so in the future I will taste before adding the honey. Thanks for sharing.

This is my go to salad dressing now. It's amazing! I do add a small amount of grainy Dijon mustard sometimes as well.

First time I made the dressing. My entire picky family loved it. Will definitely will be making this again soon.

Followed the recipe exactly and received many compliments.  Served with an arugula based salad with goat cheese.

Delish!  I omitted the honey and added a dollop of Grey Poupon, as other reviewers had suggested.  It's plenty sweet without the honey, but also mild and satisfying.

This dressing is delicious. I omitted the honey the second time I made it for a little less sweetness. My husband loved it with the honey though.

I tried this because I enjoy a white balsamic vinaigrette at a local restaurant.   I did not have  honey in the house, so substituted maple syrup, because why not, I'm Canadian!   The dressing was delicious.  Made from items that I always have in stock.  Thanks for a recipe that I will make often

It was delicious! It was just like the dressing I had at a restaurant at Emerald Isle. I have already made it 3 times!

While this dressing is tasty, it tastes nothing like the Panera dressing, which has apple juice concentrate  and Fuji apple flavoring in it to give it the apple flavor.

Excellent!  I made it as directed and it came out great.  I usually cut back on salt in all recipes but I recommended using the full amount.  Also, make it up a day in advance, if you can.  The melded flavors get better and better.

Fantastic recipe and a new family favorite. The only change I made was cutting the honey in half.
