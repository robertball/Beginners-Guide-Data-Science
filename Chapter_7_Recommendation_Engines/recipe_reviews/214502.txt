Completely satisfied!  Fairly easy to prepare, even with a 12 month old at my feet.  Super tasty and has a nice kick!  I didn't change a thing on the recipe.  Just used the 3 biggest peppers I could find in the jar and there was plenty of heat.  Nice and moist too, not dry at all like some baked mac and cheese recipes I've tried.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I jazzed it up just a bit by tossing some panko bread crumbs mixed with melted butter on the top and baking it for 30 minutes until it formed a crust.  The mac and cheese had the right amount of spiciness to it as well.

This was the ultimate comfort food. My sister and I made this together and weren't sure how it would turn out but all of the flavors ended up coming together beautifully. Some things we did a little different were using large shell pasta instead of macaroni which hold more of the sauce in the pasta. We also used half milk and half heavy cream, used a can of chopped green chilies, and topped the dish off with some shredded cheese the last few minutes of baking. It turned out perfect and very delicious... I definitely recommend trying this recipe!

I will never make regular mac n cheese again!!! This was SO good.  I couldn't find chipotle peppers so I roasted 1 poblano pepper and used 1.5 teaspoons of chipotle powder.  I also used 1/2 smartbalance half butter blend that was handy.  Amazing lavor - thank you veggiegirly!!!!

I made this for our Memorial Day family barbeque.Everyone loved it. I used 24 oz.macaroni and doubled everything else (except the flour.) I prepared it the night before.And when I took it out to warm up a little before putting it in the oven....I took a little taste and thought NO ONE will like this.But after baking it for over an hour and a half (it was a big pan) it was flavorful.

Good recipe! I used 2% milk and it tasted great. The spiciness is a nice addition. Next time I think I may add some chicken too.

This recipe is very good, I have made it several times and it's very forgiving and always tasty.  I use a little more chilis than what this calls for as I love the heat.  Reheats really well for leftovers.

I was very excited to make this recipe because I love the taste of adobe peppers in food. However, I was rather disappointed after making this mac and cheese. I felt like there was too much butter in it for one, and two it needed some sort of processed cheese so it didn't separate from the butter. I will not be making this recipe again unfortunately.

My family liked the smokey flavor it added to the mac and cheese, but they didn't like when they ran into a chopped pepper. My son says it is a make again recipe, but my husband says don't make it again. I didn't like it at all, but my parents did. I followed the recipe exactly. Easy to make. It is will not be added to my recipe box.

I made this twice because it was so dry the first time I thought I'd used too much pasta since I cut the recipe in half. The second time I made it, I doubled the milk and used more cheese.  There was much more sauce than the first attempt, and I thought it would really coat the pasta and be creamy.  Instead it was chalky and no one liked it. I really wanted to like it, but will not be trying again.

Amazing exactly as written, chopped chipotle really small to make sure kids did not detect them.The smokey flavor made it taste like there was bacon in it somewhere according to the kids. :) Thanks VeggieGirl for my new standard home mac and cheese.

I used half the amount of chipotle chilies because I can't do a lot of spicy, but it was fantastic.

this is a good recipe although using processed cheese like craft makes the dish taste a bit bland.  using a fresh sharp cheese is much better or maybe a nice sharp french cheese like beaufort woould be exceptional.

I loved this recipe, it was wonderful comfort food. I added chicken, and did not have the types of cheeses (I just used cheddar cheese). My husband said it was good, and that he would eat it anytime. The recipe calls for the perfect amount of cheese sauce as well, so it isn't dry like some mac and cheese recipes. I also didn't have time to cook it in the oven for longer than 10 minutes, and it was fine! I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting some jazzed up mac and cheese.

This was AMAZING! I decided to use just the "sauce" from the canned chipotle peppers.  There were no chunks of peppers and it still had all the flavor. The whole family loved it (some wanted MORE heat!) and I will definitely make this again.

I made this dish and took it to a Superbowl party. I dropped the dish and my husband off at the party, left for a bit to pick up my children, and when I returned, it was GONE!!  I hear that everyone raved about it. I only gave it 4 stars, because I didn't taste it myself!! But I'm making it again for dinner tonight.

This was a great recipe.  I made it for a get together we had yesterday and everyone came back for more.  Even our 5-year-old liked it so much he ate it twice yesterday.  I had to add 1 more cup of milk than the recipe calls for, hence, 4 stars instead of 5 or would have been perfect.  For those who don't like it spicy or hot, I would reduce the amount of chipotle chiles to 1 or 2.  But it added a little kick that a typical mac & cheese recipe doesn't have and made it GREAT!

Tasted excellent! First time making a bechamel without burning it, or the milk turning. Not too heavy, nor are the peppers too much. GREAT RECIPE.

Too much flour made the end result slightly clumpy rather than creamy and cheesy. Would reduce to 3-4 tbs if I made again.

Yum! I was actually looking for a mac 'n' cheese similar to one I've made in the past. I searched for a recipe that included the keywords "macaroni, sharp cheddar, whole milk," and "flour," but excluded "Velveeta." Bravo! I did leave out the chipotles this time, as is was made for my small kids, but I'd like to try the spicy version for grownups, next time!

This is one of the better mac & cheese recipes I have tried. It's full of flavor. I added an additional chipotle out of the can. I also used gluten free penne (corn, rice and quinoa). I used 1c of pepper jack and 2c of Velveeta shreds. It has a nice smoky heat w/o being too spicy.

Good! Cut down the chipotle to only 2 peppers and, also, added bread crumbs to the top right before browning.

Fabulous! I made only one modification: instead of 1 cup of Monterey Jack, I used 1/2 cup of Jack and 1/2 cup of smoked gouda. It punched up the smokiness just a bit, and was amazing...
Oh, and I made it with brown rice penne, which worked fine.

Good! I healthed it up a bit by halving the butter and flour and using low fat milk/2% cheeses - it was still thick, creamy, and flavorful.  Also added some fresh spinach which wilted nicely during baking.

Decent taste, but simply not worth the amount of ingredients put into it (so much butter and cheese!). The chipotle seeds can be a bit off-putting in contrast to the texture of the noodles and cheese as well, but that's just an issue of ingredients. Overall, it's worth a try, but definitely needs some tweeking.

I took this to my husband's office for a potluck luncheon.  3 people asked me for the recipe, and almost everyone was saying, "Who made this macaroni?  This is GOOD!"  I didn't change the recipe at all.  Yummy!!

I am a huge fan of chipotle and this is a great recipe. How I personalized it: I doubled the chipotles, halved the butter, used pepper jack cheese and smoked paprika, and added a panko/butter crumb topping. Next time I might try adding some bacon to really play off the smoky flavor. We will be making this regularly...thanks for sharing!

Made it just the way it's written. Which is unusual for me. Fantastic, might even replace my traditional mac and cheese. Had it with Roasted Garlic Lemon Broccoli from this site. Always seem to have extra cheese sauce. Makes a great dip

This was really good - I did change it a little bit because the amount of milk made it look like it would be too dry. I put in 4 cups of milk. I only put in 2 chilis because while they're pretty good about strong flavors, it would have been a little too spicy for them. I thought 2 was a good amount.
