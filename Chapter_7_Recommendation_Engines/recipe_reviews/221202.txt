These are excellent! They taste great warm or cold, so they're perfect party food!  Try adding diced roasted red peppers (the exact addition needed for the antipasto squares recipe also on this site)...or mix it up with different combinations for the "guts".  Roast beef, jack cheese, green chiles; pizza sauce, pepperoni, sausage mozzerella and provolone -- endless possibilities; all great party food or Friday family movie night munchies! Oh!  Bake the bottom crescent layer for 6-7 min's before layering on the rest...it helps it bake up nicely with no soggy/smushy spots.

This recipe was a hit with "the guys." I doubled the meat to cater to my crowd, but that was probably not necessary as all the flavors are strong enough on their own. I would recommend forks and plates, as the meats secrete a lot of oil which makes this too messy to be a fingerfood. Everyone loved it and cleared out the pan.

I want to rate this but I must admit that I changed a few things. I don't like salami or pepperoni so I passed on those meats. Since it had eggs I went in a "breakfast-y" direction by adding a small bag of real bacon bits (don't judge, it's what I had on hand ;)) and I used a 9oz package of deli ham. Instead of swiss I used slices of colby-jack cheese. My family just adored this and has asked me to make this again.

Very very tasty! Followed recipe exactly and everyone one loved it, including my very picky youngest daughter. If I were to change anything, it might be to drizzle a small amount of italian dressing over meat and cheese layer.  Still absoutly awesome as is.

The bottom layer was a little mushy so I think next time I will bake that for a few minutes before adding other layers. Other than that good taste.

Cut down on the cook time a bit. Mine was too brown. I didn't have any salami or Swiss. It might have made a tastier addition.

I made this for brunch for my family on New Year's Day. I put in the search box crescent rolls and eggs since that is what I had on hand and this is what came up. We had some ingredients and others I had to trade out. I only had one can of crescent rolls but only needed the recipe for 4 people anyway. I had ham, pepperoni and turkey for meats and only had sharp cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese on had so that's what I used. I still used 3 eggs and seasoned those with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I layered like instructed and cooked for 30 minutes, after having cooked the bottom crescent rolls for about 5 minutes like another reviewer suggested. It did not come out at all greasy but could be because I used turkey instead of a salami. Anyway, this went over very well with my family and it all got eaten up. I would recommend for a quick and easy, but different spin, on a breakfast/lunch sandwich! Turned out tasty!

This was very good.  I used Monterey Jack instead of the provolone.  I think it would be even better with pepper jack.

I made these for an afternoon get together with my friends, they all loved it and want the recipe. I didn't use pepperoni just ham and salami and swiss and provolone. I also chopped up some jalepeno peppers and spread them over the mixture for a little kick!. Thank you for this great appetizer!

Came out perfectly!  Only changeS were to cook the bottom dough for Seven minutes as someone else had suggested and added dry Italian salad dressing mix just before adding the eggs. Was delicious and everyone loved it.

Wow.  I just needed to use up some left over cold cuts so I made this, not really expecting much.  I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be spectacular.  I did use turkey instead of ham because that is what I had on hand, but I suspect it would have been even better with ham!
I have found this to be even better if a person blends broccoli into the eggs with a blender and adds some smoked paprika and onion salt to the egg on top.

This has become a family favorite! I admit I did make a couple changes. My husband hates salami, so I omitted it. I didn't have any Swiss cheese on hand, but I did have Pepper Jack cheese, so I used that. Other than those two minor changes I followed everything else as is. This is a very delicious recipe!!
