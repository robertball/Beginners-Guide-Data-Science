I have been making congo squares for many years. My mom and chef sister still can't make them like I do. The secret is to beat each of the three eggs one at a time for three minutes each. The texture of the final product is much better and bakes lighter. Bake at 350 degrees for 28 minutes only even if they don't look done. Also I use Crisco instead of butter and one 1 pound box of LIGHT BROWN sugar. When they are at room temp they are very gooey inside. Good luck! I think if you use my tips you too will be a congo square Queen like me! lol

My grandmother used to make this same exact recipe and it's a family favorite and now 30something years later it is still a must have for my family that I make every holiday! The only difference i see is that we use a 350ยบ oven and you have to carefully watch the time and sometimes take out 5 minutes early depending on your oven. They can be very gooey or very cakey.. my family likes them gooeier... also we just tried making them with the splenda brown sugar blend and they came out just as good but with no sugar for the diabetics in our family. Wonderful cookie bar

My mother made these when i was a kid. (Cookies are time consuming;) Like cookies don't overbake: better a bit underdone so they're nice and chewy when cooled. They are very very sweet.

Hmmm...I hate to be the one to bring down the perfect score but these tasted more like chocolate chip bread to me and my husband. Not sure what I was expecting. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted pecans for walnuts for personal preference. They were ok - not too sweet and very cakey - not sure what I would change. Probably won't make again but it was worth a try for something different.

I haven't made these in a few years but I am so glad I found the recipe again. Moist and chewy. So good I have been making them at least once a week and they never last long. Also taste great with both white chocolate or butterscotch chips mixed in as well.

this recipe is just like the on my mom use to make when I was a child. I add a little bit of my own ingredients to it like peanutbutter chips and I have to double it so I add milk chocolate chips and peanutbutter chips or chocolate carmel chips and leave out the nuts I have allergies to nuts.

I cooked this today with my 18 month old son and his 4 year old friend. Together we had it made in less than 10 minutes allowing for setup time. It would have been quicker again if I made it by myself without help but it was a great recipe to make with helpers. It is delicious and cooks up well. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is great for a quick dessert. I'm a chocolate chip cookie lover so I loved these squares. It's kind of like a blondie brownie with chocolate chips. (I added a little more than 6oz!) It would probably also be good with butterscotch chips.

Wonderful recipe for a square of chocolate cakey goodness. Sweet and light I will definitely make these again! I added no nuts just 2 ounces of chocolate and I thought that worked perfectly would be yummy with nuts too I'm sure1

It is a great recipe. It is a family favorite from my husband's childhood. It is not as sweet as most cookie recipes but ya just can't eat one! And it is easy and dependable.

Just as good as they were when my mom made them for me growing up. I cut the 3/4 cup butter down to 2/3 and baked at 350 instead (still came out plenty gooey) but left it alone other than that. Wonderful recipe!

This has been a family recipe for years. My Nana used to make them and they were Pepere's favorite desert. The recipe got passed down to my mom and she passed it down to me. It is a family favorite and I am not allowed to go to any holiday event without bringing a pan of these. I think they remind my siblings and cousins of holidays with our grandparents. I know they remind me of my mother. The only differences in our recipe is we always use margarine. I've tried using butter and the consistency is off every time. The other thing missing is 1-2tsp of vanilla and I use probably double the amount of chocolate chips. I'm only going to give the recipe 3 stars as is... but the way my family makes them they are 5 stars!

I have been eating these since I was a small child and it was nice to find the recipe again. I like to make them with a couple variations 6 ounces of chocolate chips I add another 6 ounces of peanut butter chips or butterscotch chips. Instead of full cup of walnuts I use 3/4 cup walnuts and a 1/4 sliced almonds or pecans. A good recipe to change things up a little.

A holiday favorite of my husband! To keep soft I store in airtight container with a slice of bread. It keeps them just baked soft. They also freeze very well!

I adapted this to be gluten-free lower sugar and a good source of iron. Substitutions: flour 1 1/2 c brown rice flour 1 1/4 c gf all purpose (containing chick pea flour); 2 tsp baking powder 3/4 tsp xanthan gum dark chocolate chips and cashews. Sugar was reduced to 1 1/4 c. Puts each square at about 10 g of sugar. Very yummy but somewhat healthy!!

A little bit dry. I think it could have used more chocolate chips. I will make it again. Maybe I was expecting to taste more like a square.

I followed the recipe and was very unimpressed. After a half hour of cooking they were still completely doughy so I turned the heat up to 350 and left them in for an extra 20 minutes. They still ended up doughy. (No it's not my oven.) Maybe they are supposed to be doughy but we prefer things to be cooked around here. The flavor was less than desirable - quite bland. I wonder if adding a little vanilla would help it a bit.?. Either way I won't be trying these again. Cookies would have definitely been quicker and much tastier. Disappointing.:/

It was a standby in my family as we grew up. I couldn't find my mother's recipe but this one worked well. It does need 12 oz. semisweet chocolate chips.
