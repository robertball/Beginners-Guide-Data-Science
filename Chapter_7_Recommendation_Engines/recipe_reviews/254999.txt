I pretty much stuck to recipe using diced fresh tomatoes and lots of garlic and fresh amberjack which is an excellent firm-textured mild-tasting white fish that grills very nicely. Turned out fantastic. Will definitely fix again if I see amberjack available again.

The only thing I altered is that I double the recipe because I was making a significant amount of Amberjack, so I used one can of diced tomato's and one can of rotel tomato's to add some spice to the recipe.  It was very tasty!
