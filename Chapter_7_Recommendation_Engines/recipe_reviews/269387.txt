8.22.19  I must first state my puff pastry had spent way too much time in my freezer.  As a result, it was not as pliable as it should have been (little dry), making it a bit of a challenge to roll out to 11”x18”.  Putting that aside, these still turned out delicious.  My recommendation would be to let the brie get “very soft.”  I was having some difficulty spreading it on the pastry, so I actually added more, which just oozed out when it baked.  If it’s not completely covering the crust, I wouldn’t worry too much because the cheese will melt, filling it in.  That little bit of brown sugar was succulent in the caramelized onions which on their own are already sweet…it really works here.  The only thing I’m on the fence about is the caraway seed, just not sure I’ll add that the next time, or maybe just add less (personal taste, perhaps).  This is an awesome appetizer with excellent eye appeal, somewhat elegant, but easy to make, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
