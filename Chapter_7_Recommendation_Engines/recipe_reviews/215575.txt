This is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!  I used 6 cups of watermelon.  The taste is very refreshing and just wonderful on a hot day.  This would be REALLY good as an adult drink whirled around in a blender with ice and vodka.  It's just THAT good.  Thanks!

I was wondering on how someone could improve on freshly sliced watermelon as-is, but this was VERY good.

I love watermelon! I tried this and the first couple of bites tasted really different but nice...but after that, I just wanted the taste of good ol' watermelon. I don't think I'll make it again.
