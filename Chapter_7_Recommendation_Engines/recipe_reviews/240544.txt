Meaty turkey soup with amazing depth of flavor! I used hot picante sauce and this turned out great.

I doubled the recipient. Started by sautéing two onions and 4 jalapeños. I used left over Thanksgiving turkey, medium picante... Very tasty!

This is pretty tasty and very simple.  As a starter it’s good, but it has little to stick to your ribs.  I added corn and diced tomato which helped but it still needs something more if you want this as a meal.

5 stars for ease of preparation and 5 for flavor! Winner! I didn't have a jar of picante sauce, but I had just made a fresh salsa from this site. I pulsed the salsa in my blender for a couple seconds. Wow, did this turn out really good! Keep in mind that the soup will only be as good as the quality of picante sauce you use. This makes 6 small servings, so it's perfect to pair with a sandwich for lunch.

It was really good and easy. I was surprised how good it was.
I used turkey frame stock and some left over turkey meat instead of the canned stock and ground turkey. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Next time I might add some black beans or corn for a little extra pop.

Delicious.  Added a 1/2 an onion, 1 jalepeno and a can of fire-roasted tomatoes.  Hey, why not...
Only soup that I can actually eat the whole thing during the week without having to freeze it.  Really love it.  Thanks Tim!

Surprisingly good! I didn't have high hopes for this one, but I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! Next time I'll use homemade salsa since I think the flavor would be even better. I also don't think the oil Is necessary so I'll omit that next time. I garnished with sour cream, shredded cheddar, and avocado..

Easy, quick and tasty. I added a little cheese, avocado and left over corn chips.  Husband was surprised and asked for seconds.....he's the family cook!

This was the best soup I have ever made! I did change it up a bit because that's what I do. I added a can of rotel, a can of drained corn along with cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper. Topped with sour cream, tortilla chips and chopped avacado made it to die for!!!!

Excellent, one of my favorite soups ever!  I am only making tortilla soup this way, it was so easy and very flavorful!  I used my favorite salsa in place of the picante sauce just for my own personal taste preference.
