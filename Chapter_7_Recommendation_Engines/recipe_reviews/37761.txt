I made this for our Independence Day celebration, mostly thinking the kids would like the jello. Turns out the adults loved it and gobbled up more than the kids! It was worth the effort required to make the presentation spectacular.

This was such a fabulous success!  I couldn't believe it could be so easy and taste so good.  What a presentation it made at our Memorial Day Potluck Dinner.  Thanks.

I found the blue jello (Berry Blue flavor is what I used) to be an odd combination with the strawberry flavors from jello and real berries. I'm not sure why. This was also the first time I ever put jello in a trifle. I'm not sure I liked it as much as trifles that use all creamier substances, but it was certainly worth a shot! Thanks!

This was fabulous and so easy to make! I also added some bananas, because I love them. My boyfriend is coming home from Iraq next month and I will be making several of these trifles for his welcome home party! I know he and his Marine buddies will love it!

I made this to rave reviews. The only changes I made was I used my own pound cake from scratch and it makes a huge difference!
