I'm surprised . . . I'm not a big fan of lentils (my Italian hubby is though), and I really liked this! I scaled this back to 1 serving, as I had exactly 2 oz. of lentils to use up. I also used Argentinean Chimichurri (recipe also on this site) that I had left over from a cookout last weekend. I took the submitter's advice and served this with sliced cucumbers and grilled naan (as I didn't have any whole wheat pita bread). It made for a nice, healthy lunch!
