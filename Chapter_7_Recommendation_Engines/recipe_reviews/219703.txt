I love traditional oatmeal cookies with walnuts and raisins, so this was a nice change.  It was a little sweeter than I prefer but that may be because of the quality of chips I used, but it was still very good.

The cookies were crunchy on the edges, and chewy in the middle. They were delicious and easy. I didn't have cinnamon, so I made the cookies without it. Everyone loved the cookies and I will make them again. I also added chopped walnuts... Wonderful!

A tasty cookie we really enjoyed.  I followed the ingredients and directions, as directed.  The only change was, mine were in the fridge all day as I mixed them up in the morning and baked them in the evening.  They held their shape and were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Just how a cookie should be, in our opinion.

These were great I followed recipe but added more oats... not sure how much. This made a TON of cookies. I like small cookies... I rolled each one into a ball about the size of a large marble or undersized ping pong. One batch made 4 dozen. I may have added a lot more oats than I thought! Glad I made so many as everyone wanted to take some home. I love all cookies but these are different. I am the only person in my group who makes these. TIPS: You must refrigerate dough 1st. Roll onto balls for perfect circular cookies. Re- refrigerate if dough starts getting messy (sticking to hands) be wild add more vanilla or cinnamon to taste. Butterscotch is a strong taste don't go overboard on chips.

Delicious cookies & great directions.  I like the 2 tsp of cinnamon in them.  (Used all I had on hand - quick oats - and about 2 1/2 cups, seemed right.)

This was the oatmeal, butterscotch cookie recipe I was looking for!  Tried several others and they just weren't right.  I made exactly as stated.  This has the perfect combination of butterscotch and oatmeal.

These are so delicious!! Came out perfect. Crispy on the outside, chewy center. Definitely need to refrigerate the dough before baking. I doubled the recipe and it made about 6dz.  Already getting requests for more!!

I took a chance and picked this recipe for a cookie exchange instead of making an "old favorite" -- I wanted to try something new. I am so happy with them! I doubled the recipe as written since it doesn't say a yield and got exactly 8 dozen cookies when using a one-inch wide cookie scoop.  As I was putting each dozen in the oven, I realized why the dough needs to be chilled -- the cookies I put in the oven first when the dough was the coldest turned out the best looking. They all taste delicious, but the ones I put in when the dough had warmed a bit don't have as much texture on the tops.  I started putting the dough back in the fridge between scooping. Exactly 12 minutes in the oven and these came out wonderfully!  So tasty and very nice looking!

My hubby loves oatmeal scotchies so after finding this recipe, I knew I had to make them for him.  I didn't have any vanilla so I used orange extract.  I doubled the recipe and threw about a cup of coconut in with the oats and butterscotch chips.  He proclaimed the recipe "a stroke of genius."  So not only will I be making these again, they will be my new go-to oatmeal scotchie recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

It needed more flour.  They spread out and were very thin and flat.  I followed the directions exactly.  Great taste though.

These are delicious and the perfect combination of crispy and chewy! I've made similar recipes, but these came out the best. Refrigeration is definitely key. My favorite homemade cookies!

Great taste.  The cookies came out very thin.  I used One-Minute Oats.  Maybe (?) that was the problem.  Wish I knew.

You can't go wrong with Oatmeal Scotchies! An all time favorite cookie since I was a child. Now my kids and I make them together. This was a great recipe, followed exactly except I used the whole bag of buttescotch chips which was closer to two cups :)

This is the first time I have made these cookies.  They were a little crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle.  I will for sure be making these a lot more times in the future.

These are amazing and  seriously addictive.  the school office staff raved!!  I baked on parchment paper, which I think made it easier and I also refrigerated the dough again, between each batch, to keep it cold.  It really does bake better, when it's cold.  Then they are easier to role into balls.  Everyone said they looked professional. :)  Will be making these again, many times, I am sure!

I just made these. I made it slightly different and they are very good. I cut the cinnamon in half my family isnt huge on cinnamon. I also substituted some of the butter for applesauce. This is something I do on every recipe and they came out great.
