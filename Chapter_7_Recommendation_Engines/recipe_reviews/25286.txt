I love this recipe!!  I have made probably 15-20 times, I usually use fresh broccoli  that I steam for about 5-10 min. (just a personal preference), and increase the rice to 1c. (which I cook in Chicken Stock instead of water, again personal preference)  I prefer Cheze wiz over velvetta for this recipe, but have also used tostidos cheese sauce in a pinch, (it gives it a little zippier flavor)  We love this as a side dish with chicken or pork chops, definately a keeper and in regular rotation in our house!

Coming from a large family, we divide up the cooking when we all get together.  I was assigned a vegetable to bring to Thanksgiving dinner, and decided to try this one.  Everyone loved it!!!  Even my wife, who normally doesn't like broccoli, cheese, onions or rice! She wants me to make some more.  Mods:  used 1 cup rice, used 3/4 of a medium onion, cooked rice in chicken broth, used 1/2 can cream of chicken & 1/2 can cream of mushroom, used a whole bag (16 oz, I think) of frozen cut broccoli.  Great recipe!!  Thanks to the poster and to the reviewers.

Perfect...Just consider adding the 1 sleeve of ritz crackers crushed with 1/2 cup melted butter placed on top just before going into oven!! That's how it's done at Cheddar's Resturant

I fixed this for Christmas dinner because I had a broccolli rice casserole lover coming. It must of been pretty good because she kept asking me what where the different tastes she was getting. I heard her tell someone on the phone that I made some kick butt broccolli rice casserole. I really liked the bacon and we love onion but I did cut it back by half after reading the review's and I did add a little more rice
but will not next time.I like more of a creamier taste than dry.
Thanks so much for a really nice switch up taste on this casserole.

I agree with a couple of the other reviews: this needs less onion and could use more rice to make it firmer and less soupy. I will try it again that way.  The taste is good, the bacon is a nice touch.

This recipe is a great base and very forgiving. I used a whole pkg of 10-minute brown rice; most but not all pkg of frozen chopped broccoli, and added 2 tbsp Creole Seasoning from this site, 1 tbsp minced garlic, and 1 tsp seasoned salt. This spiffed up what some called a bland dish. Instead of processed cheese, I used a 10 oz can of Cheddar Cheese soup and 1/2 cup milk. I sprinkled 3 handfuls of white cheddar cheese crackers on top and baked. Kids, ages 10 and 8, gobbled it up, and hubby had seconds. We finished the 9x13 pan in two nights! Thanks for the post; this is going in my Keeper file.

This recipe is really great! I'm sure it would've been wonderful had I followed the recipe exactly, but I did make a couple of changes based on what I had. I used minute rice instead of long grain rice and I doubled it to 1 cup. I just cooked it in the microwave (add 1 cup water and 1 cup rice and heat for 5 min.) I only used half an onion and instead of the jar of processed cheese sauce I used a can of Campbell's cheddar cheese soup. (I think Velveeta would've been great too.)I also added a handful of shredded cheese. (Colby and Montery Jack I think.) IT was so tasty, my husband said I "hit a home run". I roasted a chicken and had this casserole as a side dish. Because we then had leftovers, I shredded the remaining chicken I had roasted and added it to the broccoli casserole leftovers, added another handful of shredded cheese and mixed it all up. I put French Fried onions on top and baked it and it was like a whole new meal! I'll definately keep this recipe around.

With this recipe we were able to get my little brother who is a picky eater to eat broccoli and potatoes! It has a great taste.  I substituted the rice for cubed cut potatoes and used 16 oz of shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese and it was a real hit.

Could barely give this one star.  The flavor was dominated by bacon and was beyond soupy.  Served it to 8 people and they all agreed.

I agree that you should double the rice.  My husband really liked, so that alone will cause me to make it again as the man needs more veggies in his diet.

Really good!  I would use more rice next time (it came out more like soup). It was still very good.

While looking for something different to make with dinner tonight I came across this recipe...after reading some other reviews I also used 1 cup rice and did not add the milk. I did not use cheese whiz, I used 8oz of cubed velvetta instead (what I had on hand) also used fulled cooked bacon so did not have as much bacon grease but still worked well with the onions.   Just finished dinner my 7yr old LOVED it, my 2 1/2 yr old said "i no like it" and ate everything off his plate LOL then asked for more rice...next time I will make it without the bacon..(im not a bacon fan) but this was still very YUMMY! Oh I also added some shredded cheese on top the last 5 min of cooking. Thanks for the recipe!!   Edit: my husband normally gets in late and always eats after myself and the kids...his first forkful in his mouth and all he could say was MMMMMMMMMMM this is good..

This is hands down the best casserole I've ever had! It was so delicious and filling and everyone loved it! 

The only thing I did different with the recipe was double the amount of rice to 1 cup. If I hadn't it would definitely had been too runny. I also used 12oz of broccoli that I steamed beforehand. 

I will definitely be making this recipe again. Next time I'm going to experiment with adding in some chicken chunks and some minced garlic for some zest. Not that it doesn't need it though!

was very good... kind of rich with the cheez wiz. I think it needs a little more rice because it was a little soupy (although that didnt keep me from eating ALL of it!)

This is my second Thanksgiving making this dish and everyone loved it! The bacon and onion where a great addition. I tweeked it by using 2 bags of instant rice which equaled 4 cups it was the perfect consistency. Also I used turkey bacon for friends that do not eat pork. For extra seasoning I added some garlic powder and lawrys.  ~Happy Cooking!

Very tasty.  I love onions and bacon, so this was great.  I used cream of mushroom soup, precooked rice (i had leftover), and sharp white cheddar instead of the jar stuff.  Turned out great and the recipe was easily cut in half for just the two of us.

Although not my favourite, the 3 males of the family loved this. The dish is completely empty and I only had a small serving! Very "Cheese Whizzy" but as it calls for that type of cheese I shouldn't have been surprised.
I used a full cup of rice rather than the 1/2 called for and the consistancy seemed right. I used fresh broccoli which I steamed till fork tender as I prefer that rather than frozen. The bacon and onion flavour was good. For sure I will make this again as it was really appreciated. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is wonderful! I as well used 1 cup of rice instead of 1/2 cup. Im a vegetarian, so instead of cream of chicken, I used cream of mushroom soup, AND morning star veggie bacon..... Yummmmmm. I will continue to use this recipe. Thanks!!

One of our new favorite sides!  So good and creamy.  Use the extra rice as others suggest and I eliminated the bacon as I didnt feel it would need it....and it does NOT need it.

I made some changes to this as many have. I didn't have bacon, so I omitted it. I doubled the rice, only used 1/4 of an onion, used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of chicken, and used shredded cheddar to taste. Maybe w/ some bacon, it would've stood out but otherwise it's alright. Nothing you can't live without but good.

We made it for Christmas dinner. If you attempt this recipe - omit the bacon. Cut the onion and only put in one quarter of what it calls for and then cut the cheese in half and DOUBLE the amount of rice. Follow the recipe and you will end up with a heavy cheese glob. It has far too much cheese, bacon, onion and far to little rice and broccoli.

I was actually really disappointed as I thought my family would love this. We love cheese dips, bacon ect. but the processed cheese in this was gross. I will not be making this again.

I used brown rice, fat free cream of celery soup, and about 1/2 cup of lite sour cream. This was very flavorful and a lot more healthy!

This was so YUM...but really rich.  I substituted the 1 cup milk and 16 oz processed cheese sauce with: 8 oz shredded mild cheddar cheese + 1 cup heavy cream + 1 tsp garlic powder + 1 tsp onion powder + pepper to taste...I warmed all of the above on low heat until the cheese melted and mixture became homogeneous.  I also used 16 oz frozen broccoli instead of 10 oz.  This dish was really tasty...I may use milk instead of cream next time though because it was too rich.

I altered this recipe quite a bit.  I didn't use any cheese sauce, replaced the cream of chicken with cream of mushroom, used two small shallots, and topped everything off with fresh shredded cheddar cheese. I would have to say it turned out quite good.

Very good! Especially if you need some cheese, etc. to get someone to eat their vegetables.  I used the whole 10 oz package of broccoli, but scaled down the rest of ingredients to make 4 servings instead of 8.

YUM!! This was really good! I added the 1 cup rice like others suggested and a little more milk, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Used cheddar cheese instead of what is called for and a 15oz bag of frozen broccoli cuts as that is all I had on hand. My son loved it and this will definitely be added to our favorites.

My step mother used to make this for me when I was a picky teenager. I've wanted to make it but I kept forgetting to ask her for the recipe. I did have to add A LOT more rice about 1 1/4 cups (dry) more to get it to the casserole consistency I was used to and well as doubling the broccoli. The bacon was a neat idea but its not an addition that has to be added to make this super yummy. It went over well at the christmas table.

if you love cheese...you will love this recipe. i did as others suggested and doubled the rice..the consistency was perfect, not runny at all. I made this for my husbands office party and everyone raved and even sent text messages telling me how delicious it was. I also made it for Thanksgiving and the chef in our family requested this recipe. Great for any holiday or a simple dinner. Don't worry bout using the processed cheese sauce ...not cheese whizzy at all. I used the generic W*lMart brand and this could not have been better. Be careful not to overcook the bacon.

I made this Thanksgiving and my oldest son said it was his favorite dish out of everything.  Looks like this will be a new traditional dish at our holiday dinners.  Thanks for a great recipe!  UPDATE:  My Aunt Wanda recently told me that this is officially my "signature dish" and can't wait for the holiday season to indulge.  Again, thank you for an awesome recipe.

After putting this recipe together, it seemed a bit too runny and a tad bland, so before cooking it I added the rest of the 32oz package of broccoli, a cup or more of shredded cheddar cheese, a bit more salt and some crushed garlic.  Thank you so much, it's a good recipe and tweeking it to your own personal preference makes it fabulous!

Simply Awesome. I went with the advice from other reviews and doubled the rice and added a little more bacon. It turned out better then I expected. I hate broccoli but this was amazing. Will def. make again.

Very good.  I used 2 cups chicken broth, 1 cup rice and only 1/2 of medium onion. I also drained off most of the bacon grease after sauteing the onion.  Perfect consistency!

I used a purple onion, a jar of cheese whiz, and one cup of white rice. The flavours all came together well exept for next time i would double the rice. The texture was a little mushy. Still yummy though would use it again.

I modified the recipe a bit by adding more rice.  I also excluded the onions since no one in our family likes onion.  The recipe wasn't all that good.  It was VERY cheesy, too cheesy for my taste.  If I make it again I'll increase the rice even more and use Chream of Mushroom instead of the Cream of Chicken.  I am a big fan of Broccoli Cheese Casserole but this recipe didn't come even close to be one of the best.  Sorry.  Not a keeper.  I doubled the recipe because we were supposed to have company for dinner and it took almost an hour and a half to bake.

I took the advice from several reviewers by adding more rice to make it less soupy. The dish wasn't soupy....but lacked flavor. Wasn't a favorite, doubt I'll make it again.

Was a big hit at our Thanksgiving.  Only substitute was to use store bought bacon pieces to save time and for convenience but turned out very well nonetheless.  Will be making again.

I made this last night for my family and everyone loved it except my daughter who hates broccoli. But even she said it was a good recipe. I did change a few things. 1. use only 1/2 cup milk for a less soupy consistency 2. I didn't have any cheese sauce so I substituted Tositos queso sauce. In my opinion I think this took it up a few notches. Excellent flavor and it comes in mild, medium, or hot. I used medium and it was perfect. 3. I also used a suggestion I found on here and sprinkled a row of crushed Ritz crackers and melted butter although I think it would be good either way. I gave this four stars instead of five because I did make those changes. Overall a great recipe that I'll make again.

I made this as a last minute dinner when I hosted a slumber party for 4 teenage girls. It was a hit! I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, sauteed a cup of chopped baby bella mushrooms with red onions, and melted a 16oz pack of velveeta. It was delicious!

I've made this a few times with success each time. I use 1 can of cream of mushroom instead of the milk. I also use Velveeta instead of the jarred cheese. And 1 cup of rice. I also put several dashes of garlic powder in.

This recipe is fabulous!!! My family loved it and I have been requested to make it more than once. I only gave four stars because I feel it's better with two jars of cheese, 1/4 of an onion, and I don't use the milk. Any kind of rice will work... I might make this again tonight!!

Be sure to double the rice to 1 cup (cook in 2 cups water).   I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.   Great family favorite!

It was okay but I won't be making it again. I use 16 oz velveeta and melted it into the 1 cup milk. Everything else I did as the recipe calls for. Mine came out firm. Not soupy at all.

My family ate it, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped, and was overly salty. I had to use a garlicky mushroom soup concentrate due to allergies, which didn't appeal as much as other soup brands likely would've.

I've made this previously as written and would call it a 3 1/2-4 star recipe, which is why I gave it the rating I did.  However, with a few easy modifications, I think it became a 5.  Instead of frying up bacon, I used a jar of Hormel's real bacon pieces (was way easier and avoided grease), and instead of frozen broccoli, I steamed 2 lbs. of fresh broccoli.  I also used 16 ozs. of shredded sharp cheddar cheese in place of the processed cheese sauce, and then topped with standard garlic/cheese seasoned bread crumbs and pats of butter.  Came out awesome!

Just made this tonight with a fresh cauliflower, quinoa and velveeta instead of the frozen broccoli, rice & jarred cheese because that's what I had on hand. Holy guacamole was it good. Saving this simple recipe so I don't forget. Will make a delicious side dish to bring to parties.

Very good, my husband loved it. The only thing is I made it more of a meal by adding cooked shredded chicken (about 1lb.) to it and cut down on the onion.

This recipe is in rotation at my house. My 4 yr. old always request it. Very delicious and it makes a large serving amount. I use fresh broccolli gently boiled to just tender. I cook my rice seperately as well. Combine the soup, milk, and jar of cheese whiz in large bowl add my seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, white pepper and dash of salt and corriander powder) then add the cooked broccolli and rice stir and put in large rectanglar glass baking dish in oven for 20 min until it browns on the top. So yummy! Goes well with several main dishes!

I read all the reviews on this recipe before I prepared it to make sure it turned out as good as possible. I found this recipe to be extremely versatile and just about any favorites could be added to adjust to your own taste. I didn't have any bacon on hand so that was eliminated. I added a full cup of rice and added 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of chiz whiz only because the processed cheese was  pricey. I think either one would be delicious in this recipe. I also added garlic salt and pepper for taste. My family really liked it. Great recipe for picky vegetable eaters.

I have made a recipe similar to this for the last 5 years for thanksgiving.  My family does not like Green Bean Casserole so this has become the alternative.  I use velvetta cheese, fresh broccoli, and cream of celery soup, I omit the bacon (personal taste) and also add 1 cup of sour cream.  Even my picky ten year old eats it!

Very good.  A little on the rich side.  I think I will make
make my own cheese sauce next time and use cheddar and sharp cheddar to cut the richness.
