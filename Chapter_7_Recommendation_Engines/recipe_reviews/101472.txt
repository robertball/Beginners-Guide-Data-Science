My husband thought this was a 5* recipe.  I appreciated how quick and easy it was to prepare, and that it was a relatively healthy meal... but the meat took in very little of the marinade flavor.  I expected to LOVE this because the marinade reminded me of PF Chang's lettuce wraps, but it was just alright.  I may try this recipe again with one of the other Lawry's marinades, but I'll poke/slice the meat to get more flavor in it.

This was "OK".  We didn't love it but we didn't hate it either.  It was very easy to prepare.  The flavors blended together very well.  The only thing we didn't like is the sodium content of the marinade.
