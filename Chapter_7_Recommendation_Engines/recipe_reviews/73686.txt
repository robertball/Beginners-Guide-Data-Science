I am the original poster of this recipe, and I wanted to add that I often add a crunchy green such as romaine along with the spinach, and I sometimes add thinly sliced fresh mushrooms.  We tried the blush wine vinaigrette as one reviewer suggested, and it was very good, but we still prefer the depth of flavor and punch the balsamic vinaigrette provides.  Thanks for all the positive comments!

My honey said it was the best salad he has ever had.  I made it ahead of time and added the cheese just before serving.  Thanks!  I will be making this one alot :)

This was wonderful!  It was such a nice break from regular salad, it was light but very filling with the nuts and cranberries.  I added romaine lettuce for a different texture, and used sugared almonds instead of honey roasted ones.  We served it at a dinner party with the Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing (found on this site) and it was delicious.

I just tried this salad but upped the serving for 12 people for our Thanksgiving meal. I made only three slight changes, I used toffee flavered sliced almonds,used baby spinach with red lettuce to add more color,then to top it off we used Brianna's Blush Wine Vinaigrette (that was the key ingredient). It was the hit of the meal, plus there wasn't any left. Everyone loved it. It will now be our signature salad. Thanks!

Very nice salad, and pretty presentation.  I used raspberry vinigarette the first time, which was good but I'm not crazy about how sweet it was.  I would recommend blue cheese crumbles and balsamic vinegarette dressing to go more 'tangy' than sweet.  I'll be making this a bunch.

Boy was this good.  Even my 8 yr old granddaughter couldn't get enough (I didn't tell her it was spinach).  All the ingredients went so well together.  I couldn't find honey-roasted sliced almonds so I used honey-roasted cashews and chopped them.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I make this all the time and it is great. You will always get rave reviews when serving and you can vary it greatly. I like blue cheese and toasted walnuts best.

This was a huge hit when we brought it to a dinner party, and I have to admit it's one of the top salads I've ever had.  Served with Kraft raspberry vinaigrette and homemade honey-roasted almonds. We were unable to locate honey-roasted almonds at the store so we made our own: - 1 cup slivered almonds, toasted in oven for 30 minutes at 300 degrees - Stir the roasted almonds into a saucepan that contains 1 tbsp honey, 1tbsp oil, 1 tbsp water until liquid disappears - Toss in a mixture of 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 tsp of salt.

This is a wonderfully refreshing and filling salad! We make it all the time now. One thing we like to add to make it more of a meal is cubed baked chicken. It's great either way!

a fantastic salad. i subtituted ground walnuts because that is all that was in the pantry. next time, i'll choose whole walnuts instead. i used a balsamic dijon dressing that complimented this perfectly.

I've made this salad several times now paired with Red Raspberry Vinaigrette from this site and always get rave reviews.  I use Spring Greens bag mix in addition to spinach and add sliced mushrooms.  Excellent recipe!

Made this salad for 100 people at a Mother's Day dinner at church; and for 60 people at a graduation banquet.  It was an absolute hit.  It is very beautiful, very tasty with many levels of flavors (made it with a raspberry basalmic vinaigrette), was easy to prepare,and not too expensive.  Consequently, I already have plans of serving it again - this time to 120 women at a Church retreat. Highly recommend this salad.

Delicious!  I left off the onions, as I don't care for raw onions.  I used a poppy seed dressing which I found on this site, and the salad was to die for.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have been throwing a salad like this together for a few years. It is always delicious.  I also add Perdue Short Cut Grilled Chicken on top to change up the recipe.

My husband LOVED this salad, which really surprised me since I didn't expect him to like the mandarin oranges and cranberries so well!!  But he's raved about it all week.  I've made it twice now and I found it was MUCH better the second time because I tossed it and kind of coated it well with the dressing (I used Paul Newman's Balsamic Vinegar.) It wasn't nearly as good when it wasn't coated well and was a little dry.  We'll definitely keep making this one!

DE-Licious!  I figured I'd give this one a whirl but wasn't too excited about it until I tasted it.  It is such a great pick me up afternoon snack or feature dish.  Very satisfying.  Also, as one reader noted, use Brianna's Blush Wine Vinagrette Dressing.  Just perfect!

amazing salad!  i went strictly by the recipe and used my cranberries that i keep soaking in seven-up in the refrigerator, trick i learned from a restaurant in california.  rather than shriveled and dry they are plump and juicy with juicy freshness.

This is also great with thin slices of granny smith apples instead of the oranges. I also like to add red, yellow and orange peppers. Wishbone's Red wine vinegarette dressing is perfect for this.

We were sick of ordinary salad, so I decided to try this one.  It was very good.  Made it to go with "real Italian calzones" from this site.

Very nice salad!  I made this tonight as part of a special dinner to surprise my husband, and he loved it.  It was quicker than making a traditional tossed salad, and it looks very fancy.  I used Emeril's raspberry balsamic vinagrette for the dressing, which was very good.  I will definitely make this on a regular basis.  Thanks for the recipe!

Brought to my friend's house.  Everyone really liked this salad.  Used Blue Cheese and Honey Dry Roasted Nuts.  This is definitely a keeper.  Liked the fact that each person could do their own plates and leave out an ingredient if they didn't like it (although the combination of using all the ingredients appeared to be the right combination of flavors).

I made this for Christmas 2010 dinner with my family.  I used fresh baby spinach and red leaf lettuce, and I substituted chopped pecans for the almonds.  I also used Brianna's Blush vinaigrette instead of balsamic.  Everything else stayed the same.  This was delicious and I got many, many compliments on the recipe.

This salad is absolutley amazing! Per the submitters suggestion, I used glazed walnuts and blue cheese, and it's DELICIOUS! I also used Ken's Creamy Balsamic Vinagrette, which I highly recommend. It's not a "cream" dressing, it's just super emulsified and thicker which really complimented this salad. I can't wait to have this with dinner again tonight. Next time, I'll use the feta and almonds. Thanks for sharing this fanatstic recipe! :)

Very good salad and it does make a beautiful presentation.  I served it at a dinner party for my family and everyone loved it. Even my sister-in-law, who is pretty picky, asked for the recipe. I substituted sliced green onion for the red onion because I had some on hand, but will try it with the red onion when I serve it again with Thanksgiving dinner.

This is very much like the prepared Grand Parisian Salad that is sold at Costco.  They include Gerard's White Balsamic vinaigrette and fancy greens instead of spinach.

I served this at a dinner party as the salad course between two other Allrecipes: Ali's Amazing Bruschetta (appetizer), and Clam Sauce With Linguine (entree).  Big hit!  Per other review I added some chopped romaine for variety/color.  I forgot to buy red onion but it was fine without.

I needed a quick, healthy dish to take to a post-triathlon party so I tried this.  I went to the grocery after the race and threw it together.  It was a huge hit with my team and I'll definitely be making this again and again.

I made this salad and used poppy seed dressing. It was a hit with all of my family. The fruit in the salad really complemented the rest of the meal. I also added some sliced strawberries to the salad. yum!!

teens and adults really liked, I used spinach & romaine to give it more crunch.  I made early in day, omitting nuts & cheese, put on salad plates & covered. At dinner time, I added the nuts & cheese for those who opted for them.

This is a really good salad! I used one bag of spinach and one bag of mixed romaine lettuces. I felt like there were to many cranberries, and no one used the dressing! I doubled the recipe to feed 20 people and they ate it all up. I will be making this again.

Very tasty and colorful salad.  I replaced the almonds with plain walnuts and substituted reduced fat feta for a slightly less calorie-intense salad.  Even so, I think it needed more spinach to balance out all those toppings.  I'd go with more greens next time for less calories and more salad-y.

This is a sophisticated, yet easy to prepare salad. I made it for a luncheon and had rave reviews! I used the Brianna's Blush Wine dressing, and sugared walnut pieces- made it ahead and let it chill about an hour. Highly recommended!

I have made this several times and always with excellent results using the different dressings:  Balsamic, Raspberry, Brianna Blush, etc.  I think it all comes down to personal taste.  The only difference I make to the recipe is to slice up sweet navel oranges when they are in season (I'm from Florida!!).  Last time I fixed this I also threw in some arugula into the mix.  I get the usual "WOW, this looks great!" response every time I serve this to guest.  Thanks soooo much WendyinTexas for submitting a simple, but delicious recipe...and healthy too!!!!

Rather than adding feta or blue cheese this salad I have added sliced hard boiled eggs! Another way to get some protein on board. This salad is always a crowd pleaser.

This is my go-to salad. I do not candy the almonds, just toast them lightly in a skillet. There is enough sweetness with the cranberries and oranges. I make my own vinaigrette with 1/4 c white balsamic vinegar, 2 T. fig balsamic vinegar, a tsp of dijon, salt and pepper and then whisk in about 1/2 good extra virgin olive oil. If too tart, add about 1 tsp of honey or to taste. Can also use a T of juice from oranges as a sweetener.

My husband and I totally loved this salad. I did tweak it and used green onions instead of a red onion and used honey-roasted pecans instead of almonds. The contrasting flavors really went well together. My husband initially eyed it up with a suspicious look on his face. Then he ate it and wanted more! All I can say is YUM! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Ok I am totally addicted to this salad.  If you live in Canada, try it with President's Choice Maple Balsamic salad dressing.  It's slightly sweet and compliments this salad perfectly.  I highly recommend.

This was so yummy! I am a total health nut, so I love salad. But I felt like it was sort of soggy, so I would use less balsalmic viniagrette. Also, if you are short on ingredients, it also tastes great with just mandarin oranges,balsalmic viniagrette and spinach leaves. None the less thanks!

This was a good recipe to begin with, but I changed it up to our liking and have been eating it every single Friday night for... I lose count of the years! I use (in this order) bagged "tender baby lettuces", red onion, bacon bits, feta cheese, dried cranberries, walnuts, mandarins, and Newmans - fat free raspberry vinaigrette.

I just love the taste of cheese with fruit, and cranberries are one of my favorites.  I invited my girl friends to lunch, and this was one of the items on the menu.  Everybody loved it!  I could not find honey roasted almonds (or don't know how to make them), so just used flaked almonds.  Served with the recommended vinaigrette, as well as a raspberry one - both were wonderful.  Will definitely be making again and again!

This is the best, most refreshing and pretty salad I have tried in a long time!  Friends who came to dinner loved it, and it will be a regular here from now on.  I didn't have almonds, so I used sunflower seeds instead.  Super!  Used a good quality balsamic 
vinegar in the dressing, and it was just excellent.

So awesome. Followed the recipe. Only problem was that I couldn't find honey roasted almonds...so I roasted my own, and I used too much sugar to coat them. Because of the cranberries and mandarine oranges, this salad didn't keep well in the fridge, so I would make just prior to the event and not prepare before hand.

I've been making a similar salad to this for years.  This recipe is delicious.  My only suggestion would be try using raw slivered almonds and toasting them before hand, it brings out the flavor and makes this salad even better!  It also cuts down the calories and salt in this recipe without losing flavor.  You can brown them either in a toaster oven or in a skillet on the stove.  Just keep a close watch so they don't burn.

Wish I could give more stars, even though I forgot the feta. My 5 year old who likes to stay away from salad couldn't have enough of this. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner. What a festive, colorful and fantastically delicious salad.  I used the Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette and Glazed Almonds recipes from this website to top the salad. An older auntie with a tiny appetite devoured this salad and asked for seconds! A terrific addition to any holiday dinner.

Wow.  This is really good and easy to whip up.  I didn't have spinach so used mixed greens.  The feta tastes great against the sweet mandarins and dried cranberries.  Great combination of flavours.  Thank you for sharing.

I use this for special dinners.  Easy to assemble at the last minute.  Very little prep.  My only comment is to go very light on the dressing or serve on the side.  I think with the moisture from the oranges it gets too wet very quickly.

WONDERFUL salad - lovely to look at and eat!  I modify depending on what's on hand.  I usually use pecan halves insetad of sliced almonds, and omit the feta due to dietary restrictions.  I also prefer a red wine vinagrette for the dressing.  I add some sliced pears when I have them.  I never tire of the flavors - I've taken it for lunch for nearly two weeks now!  This will be a staple salad for me, and I am not normally one who eats lots of salads!

Love this salad! I've made it for a few parties, and everyone loves it. I don't even use dressing. The mandarins are so juicy, you don't need it. Unless you just like the flavor of balsamic. 
I add wheat berries to mine so it's more of a meal. And I've used baby kale instead of spinach. Both are great. Seriously, this salad is easy and tasty.

Thank you for this recipe! It's my go-to salad for special occasions now. Granted, I don't measure anything, and I serve it with whatever dressing we have on hand (Kraft's Bacon Ranch was awesome).

My nine-year old is throwing fits about salad, and not wanting any at all. I am trying out different combinations to see if I can find something that he enjoys. I didn't combine everything in the salad. I put all the topping choices in little bowls on the table. After he'd put in the items he was willing to try, he devoured it. He scraped the bowl for the very last tiny bit of spinach leaf. My husband and I just sat there and stared. This was not a kid just eating his salad because he was supposed to - he ended up liking it!

Pretty good! I can only award three stars based on my initial impression, but with a few tweaks, this could be 5 star quality (hence my 4 star rating). I love all of the components of this salad and think they work well together, but to my surprise I didn't care for the balsamic vinaigrette at all. The tart balsamic and pungent, tangy feta was just plain overkill. I think I would prefer a blush wine or raspberry vinaigrette or blue cheese paired with the balsamic instead. I will definitely try one or all of those substitutions next time. All in all, this was super yummy, but a little of a disappointment after adding the balsamic. Thanks Wendy! :-)

Lovely recipe. Just perfect. No need to lay the ingredients in any order though. It's a salad, it's meant to be tossed so the dressing coats everything. Perfection.

This really is very pretty to look at, and delicious as well.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the combination of flavors is wonderful. Since its summer I think I may try adding fresh apricot or nectarine next time, this is definitely one of those salads you can play around with or enjoy exactly as written. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has been around for years and years - and I'm glad this cook put her own twist on it and posted it here! :)  It's one of my favs - so simple and easy. I've also used both pecans & walnuts (candied, peppered, & otherwise!)

Thank you Wendy in Texas for this recipe! I was looking for something a little different than a typical lettuce, tomato and carrot salad. I brought this to a party and it received rave reviews all around. I followed your recipe, didn't add anything different. This is without question my favorite salad. Thanks again!

I used this recipe more as an idea to build on... I used fresh cutie clemintines instead of mandarin oranges, spinach and romaine, plain roasted almonds, goat cheese instead of feta, and added avocado and mushrooms.  delicious... I will make this again as my go to spring-summer salad.

SOO Amazing! I used Spring salad mix and reduced fat feta cheese. Everyone in my family of 6 loved it! Definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe to include on a salad bar. Very tasty and very popular. The only changes that I made was to halve the amount of mandarin oranges and throw in some pineapple chunks as well as adding some romaine. GREAT!

OMG! De-lish! It’s hard for me to get worked up about a salad recipe but this one was fantastic! I used the advice of ALGOMA and bought Brianna’s dressing but this one was called  The New American Dressing. It’s a creamy balsamic dressing. That and Sun-Maids Cape Cod cranberries. They were sun dried yet very moist. I also used a low fat feta crumbled cheese and I swear you could not tell. It had great flavor and tasted like the fat version. All in all this was a huge hit with everyone.  Thanks sooo much.

This is a salad that I introduced to my family on Thanksgiving.  I have now been asked to bring it for events such as 4th of July, Family Reunions, pot luck dinners at church....it never gets old.  All you need to do in switching it up is change the greens-spring greens, spinach or mix them.  You can change the nuts - from almonds to pecans, honey roasted or not.  Change the dressing - raspberry, balsamic or red wine vinegrette.  It is wonderful!

This has become one of our favorite salads. I substituted goat cheese for the feta and it was so good I think I'll stick with the change! Otherwise, everything else about the recipe was followed as written. I served this with Tuna Noodle Casserole from scratch on this site. A very tasty meal!

A nice, healthy, colorful salad.  I used walnuts since that's what I had in the pantry.  Instead of balsamic vinaigrette, I used raspberry.  The mandarin oranges make this a very refresing salad!

A great recipe! I used a raspberry-walnut vinagrette which turned out amazing! I would use less than a cup next time, though, since the baby spinach is fairly light and soaks up a lot of the dressing. But a nice, light, refreshing salad overall! My son and fiance were getting tired of the usual salads, and this went over well, even though they are not big green eaters!

I'm normally not a big salad eater.  Even though I like spinach salads way more than regular (i hate lettuce) i still usually have to force them down.  But this salad was GREAT!  I made a couple of changes based on personal taste.

First, I used the Sugar Coated Pecans recipe from this site for the nuts.

I am not a big onion fan, so I diced the onion.  After a while it smelled way too oniony, so I pulled most of the pieces back out.  It still had a good onion flavor without the pieces of onion.  Next time I think I'll mince up just a little bit of onion, and then just let the salad sit with one huge piece in it (and then pull that piece out), just to give it the flavor.

I used goat cheese because that was what I had on hand.

I used the "balsamic breeze" salad dressing spray.  It's lower in calories and keeps you from drowning the salad.

WONDERFUL!

I was in charge of bringing a salad and came across the Beautiful Salad. I substituted baby greens instead of spinach and toasted plain sliced almonds.  For having such simple ingredients I was surprised at how wonderful it was.  There is no end to the fruit combinations one could come up with. Next time I will substitute the mandarin oranges for pears, apple or some sort of berry.

This was so good! I added an avocado and made a simple dressing with balsamic vinegar, rice wine vinegar, olive oil, sugar, salt and pepper. I roped it with a Trader Joe’s crunchy salad topper pack and it was amazing!

I made this first for a first course for a dinner party and everybody loved it.  I made it again for my family and it was a hit.  Instead of Balsamic vinaigrette, I used Girard's Champagne dressing. The contrast of sweet with the tart feta cheese was excellent

Excellent salad, everyone loves it.  I made a Simple Balsamic Vinaigrette from Emeril Lagasse's collection. It was perfect.

So, I had my parents over for dinner. I thought the salad was great but I everyone else was too busy eating to comment. THEN my parents BOTH asked for 2nds. Paired with grilled chicken it was a HUGE HIT. Mmmmm. Thanks for sharing.

Ehh. I love every ingredient in this salad but don't really think I liked it all together. The only change I made was that I've never seen honey roasted almonds out here so I used honey roasted peanuts & sliced almonds (couldn't decide which would work better so used both!) I'll probably make it again with some changes.

This was delicious!  I served it on Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I used a homemade vinaigrette dressing and substituted regular slivered almonds for the honey roasted (because I couldn't find them).

With all the goodies in this salad, I expect to be blown away.  I think it was the base of the salad that didn't meet my expectations -- the baby spinach with balsamic dressing.  The recipe is worth keeping, but next time I'll try it with chopped romaine and a lighter, fruitier dressing.

Very good.  We are salad lovers.  Small changes I made was substituting grape tomatoes for the cranberries, blue cheese instead of feta and I added a t of sugar to the vinaigrette.

I loves salads like this but my husband usually skips them.  My 2 and 3yo kids love it!  I left out the red onion and the only honey roasted nut I could find was cashews.  I used a raspberry vinaigrette instead of basalmic.  Can't wait to have more for lunch today.

This was an excellent and refreshing change of pace!  The only changes I made were using a bit of walnuts (less than a handful) instead of almonds and Earthbound's Organic "Herb" salad mix, instead of just plain spinach leaves.  Newman's Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing.  Perfect balance of sweet and tangy!

Very good salad!  I used pears and dried cranberries with toasted pecans (although I have also used dried cherries and toasted walnuts, too) instead of the oranges and almonds.  I also used a locally made cherry balsalmic vinegarette.  Very tastey!

Because I cannot eat onions or too much acid, I eliminated the onions and the cranberries.  I substituted roasted and salted almonds because I have them available for snacks.

Other than these changes, made as directed and have continued making it as it has become a family favorite.  The combination of the sweet mandarins with the vinaigrette and the saltiness of the almonds made it a very balanced tasty salad.

I’m always looking for quick, healthy lunch options, and this tasty salad fit the bill perfectly. The sweet mandarin oranges and dried cranberries are nicely balanced by the savory balsamic vinaigrette dressing and crispy onions. I used smaller portions of the ingredients to make an individual serving for lunch on the go. For added convenience, I used a prepackaged mix of sliced almonds and dried cranberries that I had bought from Walmart.

Great salad for dinner parties. And SO SO fast and easy to make. The second time I substituted blue cheese crumbles for the feta, and everyone raved about it. I think it was a bit more flavorful.

Served this with grilled teriyaki chicken on top and it was a delicious, fresh-tasting, mid-week meal. Also experimented with edamame as a topping and could take it or leave it.

Husband and I love this salad.  My market had big beautiful blueberries which I substituted for the cranberries. It made a perfect side for a quiche Lorraine.

I have been making this salad for years and it is such a hit that I get requests for it over and over again at potlucks. It is absolutely incredible as-is... why change amazing? But over the years I have made a few changes when I have extra time that everyone seems to love. First, I often substitute sliced fresh strawberries for the cranberries. I also usually use half and half baby spinach and torn romaine hearts to give the salad more crunch. And lastly, when I have time and want to be fancy, I caramelize whole almonds vs. buying packaged honey roasted. This last step is a pain, but reeeaaalllly puts it over the top when you're trying to blow people's minds. :)

I've made this several times so that speaks volumes because I don't make it again if we didn't love it the first time. It's versatile in that this is a good any season salad.

I made this for a family Easter brunch. Everybody loved it. I substituted slivered almonds for roasted almonds, and this minor change didn’t detract from flavor or appearance.

This salad was great!  I used red leaf lettuce instead of spinach, just a preference and fresh orange segments instead of canned.  Great taste.

This recipe/dish was fantastic and went very quickly!!!  Everyone (family and/or friends) enjoyed the meal – the only complaint was that no one could get seconds.   I allow for seconds after I have cooked the dish for a first time.  That being said there will definitely be a next time as this dish is going into the family’s meal rotation.

I made this for a family party, exactly as the recipe said.  
It was the first of 6 salads to disappear and daughter said it was
her favorite dish at the party.  I don't think it could be any easier to make, either!!

This is my go-to salad whenever I have company coming!  I sometimes omit the red onion.  I make my own dressing with balsamic vinegar, orange juice, EVOO and whatever spices I feel inspired to add.  Homemade poppy seed dressing is also good on this salad.

Hit with new boo...actually saved what would have been a blah dinner. Perfect as is, but I used a pre-mixed bag of spring &a spinach, honey roasted pecans, and drizzled with Newman's Rasberry Viniagarette.  I put two thin slices of cucumber on salad plates first diagonally, then arranged the  salad on top. I will take a pic next time! Also, I'm thinking of adding a little more color with a few grape tomatoes or red bell peppers.

I've been keeping this recipe for nearly a decade. I only make it for parties with a crowd. It never fails to please. 
Never a big fan of spinach,  I always use my favourite salad greens or any salad greens fancied.  I had coral lettuce, butterheads, salad mix pack all thrown in. Sometimes when I run out of purple onions, I use sweet white onions which works better for those who don't like the strong onion aftertaste in mouth. It's not easy to find canned oranges here so I make this with naval oranges or any large sweet orange supremed (youtube Chef John of foodwishes). 
Thank you for this amazing recipe!  It's definitely a keeper!!!

I followed the suggestions of several others and added some green with a little crunch, using half romaine lettuce and half baby spinach. All I could find at the store were glazed (sugared) walnuts, so I went with those. Otherwise, I made the salad as written and it was delicious. My hubby said he would prefer goat cheese over feta, so I may make that change next time. But  I took it to work for a lunch and everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again!

This is a delicious twist on salad w/fruit!! Due to personal preference I subbed walnuts for almonds & I used raspberry vinaigrette b/c that's what I had on hand- but I'm sure the recipe as written is great. I love recipes that you can just slightly "tweak" to suit your own preferences. Thanks so much- it's a keeper :)

I made it with a mix of greens including spinach, chard, and arugula, because I had them already mixed together in the fridge. I liked the addition of some other greens besides just spinach.

I made this for an event. Everyone loved it. I served it with a choice of balsamic vinaigrette or raspberry walnut vinaigrette. Most folks chose the raspberry. It's a keeper

Absolutely delicious. Instead of honeyed almonds I used slivered almonds and roasted it in a frying pan until just slightly browned. It added a nice crunch!

I took this to a potluck dinner. I did not use almonds as someone had a nut allergy.  Instead I used chow mein noodles.  It was a huge hit!!  Definitely will make again.

Good recipe, even for my veggie-phobic crowd.  My own personal suggestion is that with the mandarins and craisins it was plenty sweet, so I'd go for a plain toasted nut next time.  But very good as written and pretty as well.

Just made this last night for my dad's birthday. It is the perfect mix of toppings, but instead of spinach I did a lettuce spring mix. Can't wait to have more tonight!

This really a 5 star recipe, but I changed it up a bunch so only giving it 4.  Used hearts of romain instead of spinach. Forgot to buy onion but didn't miss it.  Used Trader Joe's dry roasted pecans because I had them.  Subbed gorgonzola for feta.  Soaked the dried cranberries in 7-Up for a few hours before adding to the salad. (thanks to the previous reviewer who suggested this)  Used my store brand dressing--white balsamic with honey vinaigrette.   Thanks Wendy for the delicious recipe.

This was a very easy dressing to make with simple ingredients readily available.  I use 1/4 c of sugar and still think the dressing is too sweet.  It is also a very thin dressing.  I was not planning on making this again, but my husband said he liked it -- so I guess we'll try it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great salad for winter months.  It just brightens any meal, especially a hearty, creamy soup.  Try it with the Hawaiian Bread I from this site!

I love this recipe.  I add any kind of fruit I have at home. The mandarin oranges are good but add some strawberries and dark purple grapes and you have a feast for a king. I vary the nuts too.I make a quick vinaigrette with honey,apple cider vinegar, mint, and a good fruity olive oil.Really love this recipe!

Loved it! Even my husband who doesn't always enjoy salads, wanted seconds! I used a spring mix of lettuce and skipped the almonds.

Super easy and very tasty! I used bleu cheese instead of feta and needed very little dressing. 1 cup would be WAY too much. I suggest tossing everything and then adding dressing to taste and tossing again before serving.

Loved this salad.  Made the Honey Roasted Almonds from this site to go with it.  Used shallots instead of red onion, otherwise made as directed.  Thank you Wendy!

Everyone loved it! The onion is crucial. Even my husband who dislikes onion insisted it was necessary to taste right. We used some creamy balsamic and some raspberry vinegrette.

We loved this recipe!  I used only half of the feta (1/2 cup) and about half of the dressing and we thought it was wonderful!

Wow is this delicious.  I normally do not like a salad with a sweet component, but the combo of sweet and tangy is perfect.  The GS asian dressing was a great addition.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I served this salad twice for company with rave reviews. Made on individual plates ahead of time with all but the feta cheese and it was a beautiful presentation. Used Sunkist Honey roasted almond accents for the nuts, and giralds white balsamic vinegarette dressing, which i let everyone put on their own amounts. it was outstanding!

I think it's great when you can't stop eating a salad because it tastes so good.  It just shows that things that are healthy for you can also taste great!  This was a fabulous salad.  The only thing is that, for me, the amount of dressing was excessive.  But that's an easy fix.
