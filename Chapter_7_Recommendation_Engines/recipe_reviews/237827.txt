For those who had complaints or were disappointed in this recipe I urge you to always watch the attached videos when available. Invariably Chef John will add hints and instructions that aren't listed in the short printed directions. In this video he points out that this is a VERY basic recipe and he expects us to add things to our taste preferences-Onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce soy sauce, ginger, Teriyaki, etc. This recipe will give you a basis from which to proceed. Remember, his favorite phrase is, "You're in charge of your gravy!". So play with your food and make it your own.

I love reading all of the reviews. They give hints on how everyone makes them.  I like reading positive reviews even when they are not enjoyed. They tell how to improve or or keep exact or even if they did not think it was good. I do not like reading  sermons on heath facts. If I want them , I will go to health sites, which I do. Stick to the recipes, pease. Those are worthwhile.

This was my favorite salmon cake recipe by far.  I did add Old Bay instead of cayenne and some grated onion in the mix, as well as Panko, since I did not have saltine crackers.  I thought it might be too runny with two eggs, but I refrigerated the cakes for a couple of hours before I cooked them and they were sublime!  A keeper.

Fresh (wild) salmon is the healthier choice.  Canned foods are typically ridden with bpa. Bread crumbs are also healthier than saltines.  Most Saltines contain hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup.  Not to mention loads of refined white salt.

Just tried this recipe.  Husband and I both loved it!  I think more on the bread crumbs and the oil and butter. Great and easy, even for the fish challenged.

I love Chef John's recipes, and I'm sure this version of salmon cakes is great.  I've been making salmon patties for 30 years, as it's my husband's favorite.  I would just say that you don't have to take the bones out of the canned salmon.  The bones are soft and just disappear when you mash the salmon.  The bones add calcium to the meal making it even more nutritious;  I do remove as much of the skin as possible. Thanks for the great recipies!

Excellent recipe  I only used one egg and added some mayo and onion.   I also added old bay.   I am from the east coast so everything is better with old bay!

Easy and delicious. We used leftover copper river salmon, gluten free breadcrumbs from our local GF bakery, and alderwood smoked sea salt. Very tasty!

Really liked this recipe.  But then all of Chef John's recipes are spot on :)  I did add diced onion and celery and used panko in place of saltines.  Will make this again for sure.

I love salmon cakes. I think this is the best I've ever had. I think without the capers it would have needed a little onion and dill.  I was skeptical about the 1/2 tsp of cayenne, but I followed the recipe, and it was great.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Chef John. Once again you've hit it out of the park.

My Mom fixed salmon patties and I use her recipe which is quite similar to this one. Only difference is I use 1 egg and  1/4 cup milk instead of 2 eggs. I also use 1/2 cup all purpose flour instead of bread crumbs which makes them very crunchy on the outside and soft inside. Celery seed is also a great addition for flavor.

Awesome!!!!  I am a native of the Pacific Northwest so canned salmon wasn't going to suit our tastes so I bought a beautiful,fresh Copper River salmon filet. I grilled it with your seasoning salt and then flaked the cooled salmon as directed. I served it with your tarragon aioli. Perfect balance of flavors. My spousal unit said this will be a repeat very soon. Thanks for sharing another stellar recipe Chef John.

I have been making salmon cakes for over 60  years - I also add about 2 teaspoons of Coleman dry mustard to the mix as well as some grated onion, to your taste.
My son, a Chef loves these cakes, baked or lightly fried.
tks, Mary

Another favourite by Chef John!  I followed directions pretty much as stated but added a little green onion and chives to the mixture.  Also, as I didn't have any Saltines on hand, I used Carr's table water cracked pepper crackers instead.

I am a huge fan of Chef John recipes! I am trying out his cheese soufflé this weekend!! These were great.  I didn't have saltines so I used breadcrumbs in the cakes and used Panko on the outside. Added a little mayo and Dijon too and old bay but they were delicious!

Chef John's Salmon Cakes' Haiku: "Not very impressed. 5-star reviews added things. Maybe I should too?" Followed the recipe exactly, other than not having capers, and found the lemon to be overpowering, and the mixture too wet (resulting in fall-apartey patties) despite refridgerating it for the recommended 24 hrs. Perusing reviews finds me seeing many folks swapping saltines for panko, or adding onions, celery, mayo and a variety of other mix-ins. I usually use panko, along w/ onions, and only 1 egg, in salmon patties, so maybe I should've stuck to our traditional method, but CJ's recipes are usually spot-on. Sorry, this one just wasn't to our liking.

I have been making salmon cakes since for years, like my mother before me.  I use canned salmon but leave in the skin and bones for calcium and added flavor.  In addition to the egg I add chopped onion and celery and some Old Bay seasoning.  I use dried bread crumbs and cook in solid shortening.  I am sure this is good but I just made mine two nights ago and they are a big hit with my family.  Need the extra flavors.

Chef John's recipe is very healthy indeed, but when I make these salmon cakes, I mince or finely chop up red and green bell peppers and onions to add a little more flavor. Enjoy!!!!!

These cakes were really yummy, however, I found the 1 TBSP of capers were a bit too much for my liking. I will make this again with 1/2 TBSP chopped capers and I think it will be perfect! This is a nice way to use canned salmon!

Just made and ate this.  Excellent.  I used wild salmon that I canned myself, otherwise followed the recipe.  I might add a little more lemon, but maybe not - I did add a little too much cayenne because it was the last in the jar and I like spicy anyway :)  Thanks again, Chef John.

I have made this recipe several times and it is a definite keeper for me. My husband and I really love the taste of these salmon cakes. I know it seems too wet with when you first mix it, but even leaving it in the fridge for just 30 minutes, it definatly holds together enough to make a good firm cake.  I didn't have capers the first time I tried it--but I like it better now that I have made gotten capers and add them.  I have used crushed townhouse crackers when I didn't have saltines and also subbed Old Bay for the cayenne last time.  There wasn't much difference in taste with either of those  subs.  I do use cornmeal fish breading (because I have some open) instead of the bread crumbs for the breading.  Last time, I made them into mini-cakes for an appetizer to bring to a party and they were well-received.  I serve them with the lemon sauce for fish cakes from this site.

Delish! I loved it as is, although my husband thought it was a little on the spicy side so may use a tiny bit less cayenne next time, but will definitely make again :) the capers were a nice flavour in there, enjoyed.

Very good recipe. I adjusted herb and spice for my family's tastes. YUMM-O!
Pay no attention to people referring to "refined white salt", etc. There is no such thing.

For a novice chef like me, I thought this recipe was particularly easy to follow.  I made the recipe exactly as instructed and it turned out really well.  I paired it with steamed broccoli and rye bread -- delicious.

Great for left over salmon! I had just enough salmon to make these. I used panko breadcrumbs for the outside which gave it a nice crunch. Next time I think I would like to add some scallions. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  I grew up eating salmon cakes for breakfast at least once a week.  I made as instructed but added minced green onions.  I served these for dinner with Chef John's tarragon aioli. Thanks Chef John:)

I made as directed with one addition, i stalk of green onion, chopped. I let sit for two hours in the refrigerator, and fried them up I made 8 small ones instead of 4 large. 
So so good. I will make them again tonight.

These turned out as they should, but they were deinitely not a hit with the kids.  I thought they were okay, but probably would have been better served on a bun with some cheese and mayo or tartar sauce and a bit of lettuce.  Won't make them again.

The recipe was the best one I've ever tried. I only added some dried dill, garlic granules and onion granules to the seasonings. Otherwise, they cooked up superbly and very, very tasty.

Made it exact to the recipe.  It was OK, but VERY salty.  I'm not someone who uses a whole lot of salt while cooking, so the combination of the salt in the recipe, the capers, and the salmon itself made the dish incredibly salty.
If I did it again - which I might - I'd cut all of the salty ingredients in half.
That said, the patties held together very well, and the texture was great!  Crispy outside, tender inside, like seafood cakes should be.

Great recipe. I halved the recipe. I substituted the olive oil and pepper for olive oil mayonnaise with black pepper (1 Tbls.). Used 12 saltine crackers. Substituted Cajun seasoning for salt and cayenne. I dried about a 1/4 medium onion and mixed in as well. Also, I didn't use bread crumbs. Rolled into balls and placed in hot oil and flattened in skillet. Turned out fantastic!

I love Chef John! His recipes, thus far, have been a hit with my family and I. The only thing I did differently with this recipe was omit the cayenne pepper since children were also going to be eating them, and I added a little minced garlic, since I love garlic. However, I used French's Dijon mustard made with Chardonnay to top my own salmon cakes for that extra kick. They are awesome to just grab and go at room temp, and they were a great match warm with a pasta salad I made. Thank you Chef John for this recipe! I will make again and again. Oh, and I was very leery about the capers, but I went along with it anyway.....tasty!

My wife and I made this and it was terrific. We used canned Pink salmon as that's what we had, and it made 4 patties that gave us two dinners as we only ate one each per meal. We used dill weed in place of capers (capers are too salty for us) as well as salt free soda crackers, and followed the instruction carefully. It all turned out great except that our gas stove seemed too hot at the medium setting for the cooking time of 4 minutes per side, so I overcooked one side and used 3 minutes for the second. Two nights later I reheated them in he microwave and they were perfect. Thanks Chef John! I don't know why some others had problems, and we did not find this to taste fishy either which was a bonus, so we will make them again, and there's no need to use fresh salmon or a more expense type of canned salmon as we had no complaints!

Great recipe.  I changed it up a little.  I used Garlic Croutons and Tony Chachere's BOLD Creole Seasoning.  Wonderful flavor, and then topped with homemade tartar sauce from Mayo, lemon juice, Apple Cider Vinegar and ChowChow canned from yellow squash.  WOW...

Hubby said he liked these, but I didn't like them at all. They were way too salty. The canned salmon grossed me out because of the bones, skin and fat I had to pick out, then the mixture was too goopy. I think 1 egg would have been plenty for the diminished amount of salmon I had left after weeding out the bad stuff. I added some minced onion for added flavor but ended up not tasting it at all, and I didn't taste the capers much either so maybe they can be left out and that would cut down on the salt taste. However, I won't be making these again.

Really loved these salmon cakes! I had them with mashed rosemary potatoes and green beans with garlic, and they were AMAZING. They were a bit on the spicy side, which is fine by me (LOVE spicy food) but my fiance was less enthused.

Delicious! I made these with all breadcrumbs (homemade) instead of crackers. The flavor of capers and hint of a kick from the cayenne is great! Served with a sour cream and caper tartar sauce.

These are easy to make and tasty. I used half of the black and cayenne pepper and it was good, not too spicy.  I served with homemade tartar sauce. Next time I'm planning to add a little minced onion and some dill to the salmon mixture plus some salt and pepper to the bread crumbs before frying to add just a little more complexity.

I was the recipient of several cans of salmon.  Chose this recipe because I have had such good results with Chef John’s video instructions.  Didn’t have bread crumbs so whizzed a couple more crackers in the blender.  Otherwise good texture and flavor.  Will make again.

My brother lives and fishes in Kenai, AK. He cans and ships salmon to me. This is my go-to recipe. Great as is, but sometimes I add 1 Tblsp of mayo...never dry.

Love, love, loved it!  I was getting tired of  my old salmon patty recipe and thought I would give this one a try.  This one is a keeper for sure!  I didn't change a thing, it's perfect the way it is.

It really doesn't taste like the bulk of this came out of a can! It also came together really well and was easy to make. Had it with some tartar sauce and it was pretty good.

Just the way it is is fine.  We like it a little more spicy so I would add in the future but perfect  salmon patties as it is written.

Really like them as they are a looser than using bread crumbs as binder, kind of like a good crab cake. Kelchner cocktail sauce, broccoli/cauliflower/red pepper mix and glasses of KJ sauvignon blanc made for a great dinner!

I love salmon cakes....as long as someone else makes them!  Well, until now.  I will always hate picking out the skin & bones but these will always we be a big comfort food.  Chef John can sound a little full of himself at times & with every recipe of his I follow he has a reason to be.  Keep making those amazing videos!

This was delicious! I will probably use fresh salmon next time, more for simplicity than anything else. Like other reviewers, I added some chopped onion (about 1/4-1/2 cup) and a sprinkle of old bay; I also added a touch of dried dill, dried parsley, and garlic powder. Used a breadcrumb/panko blend, and served the cakes with Home-made tartar sauce. Will definitely repeat - might make smaller parties, too.

These were really good. I followed the directions and the capers really added great flavor. I had Club crackers instead of saltines. I only had 30 minutes to let them sit in the fridge and thought they certainly would be too wet and would fall apart. But they cooked up great in some butter and avocado oil. Ended up staying together and tasted great. Next time I’ll substitute Old Bay for some of the cayenne and salt. We sprinkled some on top this time. Next time I will find a recipe for a sauce.

This turned out great. I made a 1/2 portion with a 6 Oz. can of skinless boneless wild salmon which made preparation even easier. The added ingredients were perfect for making generous portions that were nicely crisp and really highlighted the Salmon flavor, which I love. I’ll be adding this to my favorites and look forward to making again. Thanks for Recipe!

This recipe turns out great.  I use an egg with the mayonnaise and add panko until patties hold together.  Also used salmon fillets that had been previously poached.  Pretty and substantial meal.

These were great....I did not have capers and I did add finely diced green onion and celery, omitted salt that I can not have. Used Panko  instead of crackers and lightly coated with masa before frying in a bit of canola oil.

I would add eggs so it would hold together.
The flavor was great and I’ll make it again.
I used fresh salmon that had been grilled
And was leftover.

I did not see Chef John's other salmon cakes recipe with fresh salmon or I would have tried it. I wanted a loaf so once I put this together I put it in a loaf pan and covered it with foil so it wouldn't dry out, then browned the top. I used left over baked salmon.   I added a cup of minced onion, a cup of finely chopped celery, a tablespoon of dill weed.  I only put in 1/4 tea of cayenne and did not use capers. I served it with a white sauce with lemon juice and dill weed in it.  Absolutely perfect!

I would've given this one more star except for a problem: the patties fell apart easily when I flipped them. I've been making salmon patties for years and never have them fall part like that. I think it may be because of the lime juice. The patties were a little wetter than the other recipes, but as typical of a CJ recipe, they tasted great. Next time I'll try without the lime juice and just add it on after cooking. Thanks for posting.

Hi Chef John,
Strongly doubt you'll see this, but you have two recipes of the same "salmon cakes," only difference is that one has eggs and lemon included and the other doesn't. I made the one without the eggs and they broke apart on me, then I saw this other copy of the recipe and noticed it was added. You might want to erase the other as they don't quite turn out as good. Other than that, my husband and I are big fans. Thanks

I absolutely love this recipe I did Donny own thing a little and baked salmon early in the day and used fresh instead of canned . Everything els I did exactly. I also made his Aioli sauce ! It took an hour lol since I never made it , my mom and fiancé devoured it . My mom said it was wonderful and would easily pay 25$ for the dinner in a restaurant . She's very proud of me :) and I'm proud of myself as well! Thank you chef John ! Another dinner accomplished ! He makes everything so easy to do and if there's a video to watch it makes it even easier !

I had salmon and really didn't know how to cook it. I found this recipe and was so pleased!  This will be the only way I will cook salmon from now on. Thanks for such an easy to follow and great recipe

Not bad.....I didn't have capers but everything else was pretty much the same.  I think this is one of those great basics that you can easily tweak to your own preference.

I've made this a few times now and love how simple it is. I try different flavorings/spices every time. This most recent time I used a ginger paste and they came out fantastic.

Loved this recipe. Served with creamy garlic sauce and it was fantastic.1/4 cup mayonnaise. 1 to 2 garlic cloves, shaved on a microplane, pressed through a garlic press, or very finely minced.1 tablespoon lemon juice. Heavy cream, to thin, if needed. Salt to taste.

Wonderful flavor, moist inside, yet a bit of crunch on the outside.  I added a tsp. of mayo, substituted panko breadcrumbs for the saltines and used Old Bay instead of cayenne.  Served with fresh steamed asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce (Chef John's recipe).

Finally a salmon patty that isn't crumbling into pieces or just mush. The canned  salmon and saltines made it work and that is all that matters to me. Thanks again chef.

Doubled the recipe so we could take them for lunch the next day. These are so delicious! I left off the cayenne and used a little dill pickle instead of capers. Made a sour cream, cucumber, cilantro, lemon and garlic creamy dip to go with it and everyone loved it!

So good.  (I used fresh, wild caught , cooked salmon rather than canned.)  Initially I was thinking, "where's my onion, where's my bell pepper, where's my Old Bay Seasoning, where's my Worcestershire?"   BUT, these were so good that I quickly forgot all those questions.  I will keep my old recipe but this version will be added right next to it.   DE-licious!!!   Well done, Chef John!

We love these lemony salmon patties. We now substitute ingredients: Oatmeal instead of saltines; dill rather than parsley; packets of salmon instead of canned. And, we bake them in a 400-degree oven on parchment paper (10 minutes each side). Great with mozzarella cheese and grainy mustard on top!

I doubled this recipe as I had 2 cans of Salmon and craved Salmon Patties. I added chopped green onion (4), and subd TJ crackers (Golden Round) for Saltines in order to save a trip to the store. Served with dollops of homemade White Sauce, steamed veggies and brown rice. Wow! This really fit the bill. Thank you Chef.

Great-tasting salmon patties. The only changes I made were to reduce the amount of lemon (not a big fan) and used Keebler Club crackers, which I had, instead of saltines, which I didn't. I eat the bones of canned sardines and fried smelts, so I didn't bother removing the bones of the canned salmon - they're relatively soft  and are loaded with calcium. I refrigerated the mix for about three hours, but when I formed the patties they seemed way too wet. However, they remained intact and fried up beautifully. BTW, 13 saltines weigh about 38 gms, so keep that in mind if you substitute another cracker.

For those who are cooking gluten free crushed rice cheks are a wonderful tasty substitute for the crackers.
I'm not on a gluten free diet but after tasting salmon cakes made this way by a friend who is - I'll never look back. Of course she dolls hers up by adding green onion, and so forth.  
I would also think Panko would work for this.

Great recipe. Followed very close to original. Definitely needed a sauce to liven it up. I found a garlic dill mayo recipe  from another site and was just about perfect. 
I double everything and got eight good sized cakes. Fed three adults and three kids   Without leftovers. 
I will surely make this again.

We will definitely be making this many more times. I usually skip right to the recipe without watching the video but one of the reviews suggested we would get extra hints if we watched the video first. I did that and totally agree with that review - will be doing that more often :)

I've made this twice and it was excellent.  Put the salmon mixture together in the morning and made the patties later in the evening.  They had great flavor and held together well.  I had one the next day on a salad.  Yum!

Super, as always, Chef John! Followed recipe exactly, except I had two 5 oz packages of salmon, so only used 1 egg as the salmon was already pretty wet.  Served with crab cake remoulade, green beans and leftover cheesy potatoes... Yum!

pretty good, i must say. I wish I had some kind of sauce for the cakes. I used old bay seasoning in place of the cayenne pepper because I ran out. I also used Ritz crackers instead of saltines for the same reason. I added breadcrumbs to the mix because it was a little too watery. i'd definitely make this again but i need a sauce!

Save yourself the trouble and use fresh salmon, not canned! I had to spend 20 minutes sifting out every single little bone. The flavor was mild and could be spruced up a little bit -- the saltines downplay the salmon. Trying breadcrumbs next time!

I had to choose the tried and true, plus chef Johnny's video made it very accessible to make.  I definitely recommend the sitting time in the refrigerator.  It's a tasty all star meal.  

I always look for ways to impress my lady.  A little garnish and she'll think it's a restaurant meal... Always plate what you serve.  The little bit extra makes all the difference.  BB

Like others, I used this recipe as a springboard and absolutely loved what I ended up with. My changes: half a small onion whirred in the food processor, 2 cloves garlic, 1/8 tsp old bay seasoning, 1/4 tsp paprika, no capers or cayenne, ended up using 20 saltines to counter the water in the onion, and I mixed ~4 Tbs coconut oil and 4 Tbs butter to fry them in. They were the bomb and stuck together very well (I was careful when moving them to the pan and when flipping them). I served them with a quick homemade chipotle mayo and some pickles and uploaded a pic. I think I will make more tomorrow :D

I gave this 5 stars even though I screwed it up.
Almost burned the salmon.  I promise I will be 
more careful the next time.

This recipe will go into the rotation- tasty, easy to make, and the ingredients are readily available.
Because I had to use gluten-free crackers and bread crumbs, I used the two eggs that the recipe calls for instead of one egg that some other reviewers used to help  bind the patties  together.
I also added finely chopped onions, garlic, dill weed, as well as extra cayenne and capers. Yummy!

I adore Chef John's recipes and this rates right up there. I had some leftovers and want to use them up and this was the perfect recipe to get the job done.  I added a little minced onion and parsley. Mixed it with the crumbs from the bottom of the bag of Stacys pita chips and we had dinner!
Wonderful recipe for you to embellish to your taste.

Made this last night for dinner and it was excellent. I used Old Bay Seasoning instead of cayenne and think it added a great flavor. These are very rich and it makes 4 large patties. Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe with no changes.  It was very flavorful and moist.  To save a few calories decided to just use a little bit of lemon on the patties rather than an aioli.  It has been added to my recipe box.

Could use more seasoning, otherwise it's pretty good.  I used old bay instead of cayenne, but still was a bit bland.

My wife cooked this last night sans the capers and cayenne pepper and the patties were moist and pretty good. My wife's recipe is very similar but has diced onions. The onions add flavor and a little crunch.

Only 4 stars because there is no need to remove the  skin and bones, just mush them up and add to the mix.  Removing them also removes important calcium and omega-3 and omega-6 oils.

It was ok but kinda bland. I'm a southern cook so we like lots of flavor. I don't cook using measurements. I'm what they call a vibration cook. But I added garlic powder, a little onion powder, seasoning salt, and a sprinkle or two or italian seasoning. Yummy!

We always had them growing up. Its really simple and I too use old bay. If you don't like to pick out the bones and skin. Chicken of Sea make a smaller can of 6 oz. Boneless, skinless.
I started several years back when salmon went so high. I use one small can of  the boneless skinless salmon and 1 can white albacore tuna worked out great.

Actually, you can crush the bone and skin into the salmon. More calcium ans omega oil. As the reviews show, you can so almost anything with this recipe, and it's great.  I serve with a cheese sauce made with a little mayo, some milk, and cheddar cheese. Always a hit.

I made this with left over fresh salmon and used Parmesan cheese in place of the flour. I have one of those halogen tabletop oven so I baked/fried it in there so it was very healthy and outstanding. I made a topping of 1/4 c mayo and 1tbsp. Dijon mustard and dill weed and put a tsp. on each patty before serving.   Served with spinach salad for a very enjoyable meal.

Was great.  I used left over salmon fillets I baked the day before that had some soy and brown sugar on them.  Did not have capers.    They were fabulous.  Kinda sweet.  No fishy smell or flavor.

5 stars easy!  Salmon patties come out picture perfect and delicious.  I like to cut the recipe in half and use a 6 ounce vacuum packet of salmon.  As other reviewers have commented, this is a basic recipe.  Once you have the basic recipe, embellish to suit your taste.

I have made these several times without substitution.  My son who normally hates canned salmon loves these.  They always turn out good.

I don't generally enjoy salmon, but this recipe was pretty good! Next time I would cut the salt is the only thing. I can't wait to substitute the salmon with crab for crab cakes, my fave!

My pregnant daughter-in-law devoured these. They were yummy.

Yummy!  Because of what was on hand, used yogurt to replace one of the eggs; breadcrumbs in place of saltines (1/2 cup) and panko in place of breadcrumbs for crisping.  Love spicy, but for DH's sake will use half the amount next time.  Thank you for sharing!

I love this with canned salmon, or this summer I had an abundance of fresh trout, so one night while baking 2 large ones for dinner I also baked 4 medium to smallish ones, after dinner I deboned them and vacuumed packed the meat, freezing it for future use in these cakes. They were a great hit, but in future I thin I'll use fillets because it took me longer to debone then it did to cook whole fish and prepare cakes and fry!

This is a good recipe. I don't like capers very well and I thought it was
to much egg. 1 egg worked fine. I have been making mine with parsley flakes, 2 slices of bread crumbled and an egg, salt & pepper, an a bash of old bay. Fry in veg. oil. You can also use a can of jack mackerel in these recipes. It's about half the cost of a can of salmon, tastes pretty similar.

It was okayish. I'm from Maryland so maybe my idea of seafood is different. I'll make it again eventually but it's basically a glorified tuna melt
