I have made this recipe as it is written three times since I found it a couple of months ago.  It is absolutely delicious!  The sour cream really cuts down on the heavy mayo flavor that is in most salads.  I believe the celery salt and dill are imperative.  I understand leaving things out or adding things because of a personal preference but I wish those that made modifications would not rate recipes.  Sometimes leaving out something minor could make a big difference.  Trust me, spend the couple extra bucks to buy all of the ingredients for this and you will not be disappointed.

This is almost the same potato salad I made this weekend.  I added 1 T of yellow mustard in addition to the dijon, as well as a tsp of worcestershire, a tsp of fresh lemon juice and I used FRESH dill, instead of dried (1/4 of a cup). I also think it's easier and faster to cube the potatoes before cooking... boil about 15 minutes.

It’s so difficult to indicate precise measurements when writing out a recipe for someone. Tastes vary, sizes of fresh ingredients vary, and sometimes we just use “a little of this and a little of that.” But somehow, however, the submitter has it just right.  She’s got the perfect measurements of each of the ingredients.  I wouldn’t alter that a bit.  But while I didn’t change anything (except for using a couple less eggs and fresh, rather than dried dill) I did add some things to dress it up a bit.  Some thinly sliced radishes, sliced green onion, a few slices of cooked and crumbled bacon, about 2 T. creamy horseradish sauce and some Jane’s Krazy Mixed Up Salt really made the flavor pop and made a good potato salad even better.  My favorite part of this recipe is the half and half mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise.  It was creamy and still had a slight tang from the mayo without it being overbearing.

First, let me say I made this recipe twice... Once exactly as written, then with a few tweaks. The secret of this recipe is, of course, the dressing. It is very good as is. But on my second try, I doubled the mustard... even better! Yes, use the entire tablespoon of dill, it's perfect! I did prefer a little more celery, onion (Vidalia), and egg. But I'm not changing the dressing!

I made this for a large group (50 people) and received rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used celery seed instead of celery salt since I didn't have any. It was the perfect potato salad, and I will definitely make it again.

I took the recipe submitter's advice and made this potato salad the night before so it would have time to set until dinner the following evening. My two sons helped me make this salad from start to finish. I made a few small changes due to what I had on hand--I increased the celery to two large stalks, green onions instead of white, used Beau Monde seasoning instead of celery salt (Beau Monde seasoning is basically celery salt and onion powder) and because my son asked, I threw in about six chopped garlic dills. This was quite good, though I think it could use a little more spicing up. Next time I make this, I think I'll add some garlic powder, chives and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. As is, quite good. The amounts of mayo/sour cream were absolutely spot on. I'm glad that the submitter added the footnote about making it ahead of time. I think that's what makes this salad. My sons and I really enjoyed making this together and we all (me especially) appreciated the ease of this recipe.

I have been trying and trying to make a good potato salad and finally I have a recipe that has helped me do that.  I did make a few changes based on my taste...I left out the celery salt and onion.  I used yellow mustard instead of dijon and used celery seed instead of real celery, both of these substitutions were because I didn't have the actual called-for ingredients on hand.  I was so happy with the way this turned out..by far the best potato salad I have ever made.

Great potato salad!  Loved all the flavors in this.  I did have to make some substitutions based off of what I did or didn't have.  I used onion powder instead of onions, and celery seed instead of celery.  I also left out the celery salt.  This will definitely become my standard potato salad!

I made this potato salad this week and it was fabulous!  I used fresh dill and other herbs from my garden.  Also, I cut the recipe in half and it still filled a larger-size  bowl.  Thanks for a great summer recipe!

Excellent potato salad!  My husband said it's the best he's ever had, and he LOVES potato salad! Followed the recipe as written with light sour cream and a mixture of light and regular mayo.  Definite keeper!

Wasn't quite enough sauce for the potatoes, so I would increase amounts a little next time.  The flavor was good if you love dill, which I do.

Just made this and I'm having a hard time putting it in the fridge to chill because I can't stop eating it.  This sauce could be used for fish or other uses!  YUM!

Because of the reviews, I decided to make this potato salad to take to a cookout, and 2/3 of it went uneaten.  What a waste!  I followed the recipe exactly.

This is a very good potato salad. The best thing is you can adjust the amount of ingredients to your family portion size. I used daisy light sour cream, a little red onion, celery seeds and grey poupon mustard. I did not have celery on hand. I made this salad enough for two people but I also kept the same amount of creamy sour cream/mayonnaise sauce because I really think this makes the potato salad plus the FRESH dill.  I added and tasted as I stirred the ingredients and eyeballed the rest according to my tastes. I chopped up the FRESH dill, used 1T, added it to the sauce, poured it over the potato and egg and mixed it altgether, chilled all day until ready to serve. I do suggest making this ahead of time to allow for the sauce and dill to set and flavors to blend well. Makes a big difference. This had a nice creamy consistency with a slight tang which I loved. A keeper in my book! UPDATE: Absolutely delicious potato salad! The more you let it sit ahead of time in the refrigerator the better the tastes. I could taste the fresh dill, creamy sauce with potatoes and eggs. going to make again. a hit in my house!!!

Very good! I left out the celery, just don't like it in potato salad. It needed to be a little "saucier" the next day so I used some heavy cream. Deelish!

My husband recently went nuts over a potato salad at a BBQ joint (made with sour cream).  I went searching and found this recipe - only had russets on hand, halved recipe using 1/2 c each of sour cream and mayo and 1 tsp of vinegar & mustard ... it's phenomenal!  Thank you so much for recipe!

Great creamy tasty potato salad, I did omit the onions because our guest can't eat them, so I put in extra celery and one chopped dill pickle. Used garden fresh chopped dill. My potatoes were medium in size and I was afraid the amount of mayo and sour cream was going to be too much, but ended up using it all for a nice creamy perfect texture. I only made it four hours before eating it and was perfectly fine and our guest loved it. Update: This has become my "go to" potato salad. This is wonderful for potlucks because it really taste better the second day. Dry dill works well but fresh is best. I'm now asked to bring potato salad to all gatherings.

This was only okay. I'm actually surprised that it has a five star rating, to be honest. I followed the recipe exactly, and my family thought the apple cider vinegar was really overpowering. The dill was really strong, as well.  I would not make this again. Sorry to be harsh.

this recipe is perfect with the ingredients just as is. 
Everyone I've served it loves it.
My modification is in the preparation i sprinkle the apple cider vinegar over the warm potatoes after cutting. I also use fresh dill from the garden and when i do I triple the amount as my Scandinavian family loves anything with dill.

This recipe is so good, it might make you want to slap your mama. (just kidding) I cut the recipe down because I live by myself, but now I might be sorry I did. I had a small bowl even before I chilled it. It does not need tweaking!

I made this for a Memorial Day pot-luck for work.  Although, at this writing, I haven't tried it yet, I found it a bit dry when mixing it all together.  I mixed some additional dressing ingredients together and added it in, and it looks just right.

Delicious as written.  I used a one less potato, just because I love the juicy sauce and wanted to slather the potatoes with it! Creamy with a bit of tartness, and love that this has a less mayonnaisey flavor.

Made it for a birthday bbq last weekend and it was a hit! I only used about 3 or 4 eggs because 5 just seems too much. I also did a little s&p on the potatoes before mixing in the dressing. 

Didnt have Dijon mustard so I had to use normal mustard but next time I will pick up some Dijon for sure.

I made this recipe twice in the last week for parties.  It was a hit both times.  I used a couple more potatoes than the recipe called for and added an extra celery stick or two (I love the crunch).  The first time I made it the night before the party, so it had plenty of time to chill. The second time I only made it a couple of hours before the party.  It was definitely better when it had more time to chill.  This is a great summer recipe.

This is a good recipe, but I prefer more mustard.  I added a couple teaspoons of oriental hot mustard to ramp it up, but that didn't do what I was looking for, so I also had to add some yellow mustard.  After that, you couldn't taste the dill, which was disappointing.  The lesson here is, if you prefer more of a mustard flavor, don't use this recipe, if you want the dill flavor, don't add more mustard!  It was tasty, but not my taste.

Yummy.  Two of my kids loved it so much, they mixed it with rice to have as their main meal.  Makes way more than 8 servings. I'd say more like 16. I didn't have sour cream, so I used Greek yogurt, which added a great tang. Be generous with the salt.

This was pretty easy and tasted great.  I diced the potatoes before boiling but the 20 min was a bit too much since they were small chunks so adjust accordingly if you dice first.  My husband doesn't like hard boiled eggs so I put some aside without and then added only 3 to the rest of the batch. I followed the measurements other than just a tad of Dijon per our taste.  Update:  The full tablespoon of dill seems a bit overpowering to me so I will cut back on that a little next time.  20 mins of hard boil time on large potatoes cut in half is still too long, they were too mushy.

Super tasty! Dad raved over it. For a shortcut I boiled the eggs with the potatoes, removing them after they had their time in the water. Personal preference chages: I subbed greek yogurt for sour cream, added a bit more dijon for extra bite, used shallot inlieu of white onion, and about 1/4 fresh chopped dill. Really, really good!

Delicious! I don't normally like potato salad. It tends to be too mayonnaisey and heavy for me. But this is much lighter than most recipes and has a wonderful, unique flavor! I brought it to a work potluck, and everyone loved it. I followed to recipe exactly, but I used light mayo and sour cream. I'm really grossed out by "diety" tasting things, but everything worked great.

The dill was a lil strong for my taste so if there's a next time I will reduce to 2 tsps. I added a tbsp of yellow mustard along with a tbsp of spicy brown mustard. I didn't add the chopped celery but did use the celery salt. I also used 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 1 tsp of Season All. All in all this was  good potato salad if you like the taste of dill weed.

After following the recipe for the dressing, I found that it needed a little something. So I added about a tablespoon of paprika, a dash of cayenne and an additional tablespoon each of Dijon and apple cider vinegar to give it a tangy twist.

I love dill and thus added a TON more than called for.  I also used sour cream and mayo because I don't like the idea of mayonnaise.  The result was delish, but the day after it was a bit runny.  I think because of the sour cream.

Absolutely loved this recipe, exactly what I was looking for.  I swear I have a whole jar of dried dill weed un my cupboard but couldn't find it, so I used dill pickle relish instead, and it was still the bomb.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious. We could not stop eating this potato salad.  I have also used the sauce (everything except the potato and eggs) to make deviled eggs...Wonderful.  It also reminds me of a creamy dill cucumber salad my mom used to make and look forward to slicing some of those up and adding to this sauce

I grew up on the mustard style potato salad and must say that I and my wife really loved this recipe. Some mods based on preferences and what we had: used russets, no eggs, no celery salt. Excellent potato salad. I've been wanting to try a dill weed potato recipe for a while and this one is a winner.

I made this for a banquet and everyone went nuts about it.  I did add a tablespoon of yellow mustard to it just to give it a little more flavor and I peeled the potatoes after I boiled them.

I made this recipe as stated.  We liked it best the next day-the flavors were more incorporated in the potato salad.  I will keep this one since it is a bi different from the others I have made.

This was delicious! If you use large red potatoes you will NOT need 10.  I used 7 med-lge potatoes and kept the dressing amount the same. Perfect. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is great!  I love the mayo and sour cream combo flavor is so much better than just mayo.  We always have fresh dill in our garden, so it was a great addition to this recipe.  I've made it numerous times. We don't care for eggs with our potato salad, so I just omitted them.

Made as directed but accidentally bought celery seed instead of celery salt.  It was really good, but kept thinking it needed something more...like thinly sliced radish.  If you have a party to go to, you can trust this recipe as is and be a hit.

Made this just as recipe said for the 4th of July, it was great. 4 stars because I don't see why the recipe says to cut the potatoes after boiling instead of beforehand. Will definitely make again, with a dash of dried mustard!

I found this recipe to be very sour.  I even added sugar to the dressing but still thought it was not balanced.  I made it for a large group and it really didn't get eaten.  Maybe if you cut out the mustard and add some sugar it might be better

This is the best potato salad I've had in a long time.  They sour cream perfectly cuts the mayo and the mustard isn't over powering.  The only change that I'll probably make the next time I make this is to add dill into the spices and sour cream/mayo blend so there is more of a dill flavor to it (I like dill, it may be too much for others).

this potato salad is so good! I made one simple adjustment which was substituting approx. ¼ cup of fresh dill for the dried dill. the dressing for this is just perfect as is. the celery salt gives it a great flavor my family loves! this salad tasted awesome after just a few hours of chilling in the fridge, so if you don’t have time to chill overnight, do not worry! make it anyway! also worthy of noting is that this is the first potato salad I have ever made. I will make this over and over again from now on!

Wow. I think the exchange went like this. Me: This might be the best potato salad I've ever made. Hubby: This might be the best potato salad I've ever HAD!! Yeah, its that good. Only made a couple changes. First, no celery but did use celery seed. Second, used dill pickle juice instead of the vinegar (I wanted it really "dilly" and might have used a bit more than the recipe) and sprinkled it over the warm, cubed potatoes so they could absorb the flavor. Lastly, had fresh dill in the garden so used about half fresh and half dried (and maybe a little more than the recipe called for. OMG. This will now be my "go to" recipe for potato salad. Just about perfect in every way.

This was excellent.  I tweaked it a bit hence the 4 not 5 star rating as I can only comment on my own additions:  capers,and diced gherkin pickles as didn't have relish. Also added some caper juice rather than the vinegar. Omiteed the celery seed as I didn't have any and some of the reviews  said that it was optional.
I had the tube of "fresh" dill so added that rather than dried. Tasted great. I just used about 4 cm worth squeezed out.  If you aren't familiar with these type of herbs go check them out.They are the perfect balance of fresh taste with the ability for them to last in the fridge for up to 3 months!  I use way more fresh herbs now!@ 

I served this along with balsamic marinated tomatoes over mixed salad greens and broiled salmon for lunch. Big hit!.

Will definately use again.  I did under salt it a bit or the salt got absorbed by the potatoes. I would mix the ingredients  then double check the salt before serving.

I don't typically like potato salad... and I quite enjoy this one!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought the sour cream was what really made it outstanding.  The second time I made it, I was going to be serving it to someone with a dairy allergy, so I had to use all mayo.  Although I went ahead with the recipe, I was unsure if it would be as good without the sour cream.  So I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was still an excellent potato salad that everyone enjoyed!  I would probably still prefer to make the sour cream version, if given a choice, but leaving it out is perfectly acceptable as well.  Thanks for a recipe that made me give potato salad a second glance!

Made this twice. I left out the sour cream and doubled the mayo the first time. Second time, I used sour cream and mayo (3/4 cup of each). My family prefers mayo only...try it without the sour cream and see which one you like best.

I used fresh dill (I love dill and used quite a bit, to suit my taste) and I didn't have a white onion on hand but a red onion.  Also, just because I like pickles in my potato salads, I chopped up a few baby dills, just for some additional "crunch" (although the celery does a fine job of adding texture).  My potato salad was "scarfed down" at the recent 4th of July BBQ.  Great recipe!

Great recipe! I made this as written for a family dinner, with the exception of fresh dill instead dried, and I had russet potatoes on hand, which I roughly peeled and cut before boiling. The salad was fantastic, even my mother loved it, and asked for the recipe - and she's been making it "her" way for 40+ years! Mom and I agreed the sour cream is a great addition, it takes out the oily texture of just mayo versions. The salad is light and the if you love dill like I do, it really showcases it. Thank you for sharing the wonderful recipe, its a keeper!

Classic. Yum. We've all had the unpleasant potato sald experience. Potato & pasta salads....the staples at nearly every buffet, pot luck & picnic, are rather like playing roulette. Nice or NASTY. You can never be 100% sure before that first bite. ;-)

This one is YUMMY!!

Very, very good!  I made this recipe for a 4th of July BBQ and was very pleased.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I cut the potatoes first, then boiled them.

Out of this world!  We have dairy allergies so I just had to replace sour cream with mayo.  Everyone loved it and couldn't get over the flavors.  It reminded me of my grandmother's potato salad. A real comfort food.

I'm not a fan of celery so I left out the chopped celery, but this was very good.  I'll definitely make it again for cook-outs or picnics.  Thanks!

we used 1/3 c. of mayo and 1/3 c. of dijon mustard ... also, diced the potatoes.  it was the perfect amount of "sauce" to coat the potatoes and onion.  I would add another stalk of celery next time.  super good.

Outstanding!
My wife is a southern girl and said it was her favorite potato salad ever.
Followed the recipe with exception of using fresh dill and low fat mayo.

I wanted a different potato salad to serve at a recent get together and made this just as the recipe stated; made no changes.  It  was a hit and everyone raved about it.  I saved this one and will definitely make it again!

This is the recipe I’ve been searching for years to find!  It’s a fabulous potato salad! I made my second batch last night for a family gathering and told my husband that this could become one of my “signature” dishes. The dressing really makes it, not too heavy and the right amount of dill weed.

This is the best potato salad I've ever made, or even eaten for that matter! I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream and it came out perpfectly. The fresh dill was amazing. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Love this recipe, I had been looking for a great potato salad recipe for some time because I'm so picky about my potato salad.
 I have made with eggs & without, great both ways. I added more celery, and top with green onion if I've got some on hand.

I like the eggy taste of this recipe.  Thought it needed more mustard and celery salt so added 1 Tbsp more mustard and 1 tsp more celery salt which helped.

The only change I made was to cut the recipe down and use my left over baked potatoes instead of cooking up fresh ones. This turned out nice and creamy with a lovely dill taste. I woulnd't change a thing.

Very good potato Salad! I love the addition of the dill. It could have used a little more dressing though. I also  suggest cubing the potatoes before boiling.

It was delicious ?? I used two stalks of celery and red instead of white onion. My husband loved it too, next time we will try it with half the mayo, as it was a little to greasy for our taste.

We loved it! I wanted it to taste like my mom used to make and this was really close. We ended up giving it a lot more salt for a more savory taste. I loved the fresh dill in the salad!!

one of the best potato salads I have eaten in a long time.  I did put in some fresh dill as I had it on hand and the aroma was wonderful and so fresh.  I will make it again often.

I've grown weary of the regular potato salad and have gone thru 100lbs of potatoes searching for one with sour cream, dill weed and a bit of tang.  This is it! No more searching and recipe saved. Should've known it would come from next door,  WTG SPANISH FORT!!! Absolutely delish just as written but you can fiddle with it and get wonderful results too.

Very good. I ended up using a higher dressing to potato ratio (about half again as much), but my red potatoes were pretty big. I also added an extra egg and some additional celery, just because I like those, but I suspect that for most people the written proportions may be perfect. My vinegar and mustard “to taste” meant that I added a little extra. Also, I had only celery seed, so I added somewhat less of that. I made 1/2 of a recipe, and it would make six to eight pretty generous servings.  Next time I may use green onions.

I thought that this recipe was just ok.  It needed a lot of help as far as the seasoning goes because I thought that it really lacked flavor of any kind.  But I didn’t have any celery salt.  I only had celery seed.  So I used a lot of extra salt and a ton of celery seed and dill.  It is true that it tastes better the second day.  And I really enjoyed the dill.  I will keep tweaking the seasonings and see if I can master it.

I made this for my daughter's graduation party. (I multiplied the recipe by 5).  We had lots of people and lots of other food there but, this potato salad was a huge hit!!  Several people told me it was the best potato salad they had ever had and wanted to know where I got it.   I was proud to say I had made it myself.  The dressing is what makes it so good.

Simple to put together great taste ... I peeled and cubed my potatoes and steamed in a steamer bag for 4 minutes and set in freezer for a few minutes to cool and added a few dill pickles because I love them !! next time I will use more dill and probably try fresh dill this summer...

Always delicious. I don’t have celery salt so I used extra celery and a little celery seed

3.28.18  My sour cream was not looking too fresh, so I pitched it and sub’d plain Greek low-fat yogurt which worked fine.  I had fresh dill on hand, so I used that (fresh is always better) instead of dried.  I just never tire of potato salad like this, just creamy, old-fashioned comfort food.  Rocked the carbs today!

A tasty variant of the traditional potato salad.  One suggestion, as the internet sends this recipe all over the world, it would be helpful to give a volume or weight for the potatoes.  We don't like a lot of dressing, so I reduced the mayo and substituted yogurt for the sour cream. No complaints or leftovers!

I made it with a few changes/additions, but it's a VERY good starting point. I added about a Tbls white sugar, 3/4 cup chopped dill pickle, 1/2 cupped chopped green olive, a minced pickled garlic clove, 1 Tbls yellow mustard and a couple dashes of cayenne. Turned out marvelously.

This is a really yummy potato salad recipe.  I did not use the eggs just out of personal preference but the dressing is delicious.  I also add a little more celery and onion for crunch.

This is such a great recipe!! As recommended I made the "sauce" as written- no substitutions but I doubled it. My family prefers"mushy" potato salad so I used 10lbs russet potatoes peeled before boiling. I used 10 full eggs and 4 yolk only eggs.

I scaled this down for two. Followed the recipe as written. We aren't big mayo fans, so the mix of mayo & sour cream was right for us. I will try this again but probably add a hint of sweet to the dressing, either honey or a sprinkling of sugar, but that's just us. Otherwise, this was far better than any store bought  potato salad.

YOU AIN'T JUST WHISTLING DIXIE! THIS STUFF IS THE BOMB! My mother made it the same way, the only way. This potato salad gets better with every passing day, if it makes it past two. I remember eating this stuff for breakfast! I'm so glad you shared this recipe because I only knew how to make it from helping her and never really wrote it down. That's what I love about Allrecipes is that it takes me back and connects me with people who appreciate memories, tradition, and just good food. Thank you.

Delicious recipe! I used fresh dill and added only enough dressing to cover the potatoes.  Otherwise it would have been way too moist.

I will definitely make this again, I made a few changes ,as my family is very picky, replaced onions with 1tsp onion powder, and 1/2 tsp shallot salt, and replaced what we call the crunch factor-celery with two large kosher dill pickles, (we prefer valsic brand). No additional salt is needed. As for type of potatoes, my mom always used russet, so 7- 8 large one for this recipe. I made a day ahead, everyone one loved it.

No changes. Everything was perfect! My cooking philosophy goes something like this: If I can't make something in my kitchen that is notably better tasting than what is available pre-made at the grocery store, I will not invest the time and the effort to complete the recipe. 

This recipe would have been worth twice the effort, but fortunately it was as easy as cutting up a few ingredients, and being willing to wait until the next day to eat it! My family loved it, I loved it, and so did my company!

I added a little more dill, celery seed, and mustard to boost the flavors a bit. I also added a little dried cilantro to balance the sour of the mustard and vinegar.

This is a good basic recipe but you'll need to add quite a bit more seasoning to bring the flavour. I also added corn to sweeten things up.

My biggest problem with this recipe was how many potatoes to put in. Red potatoes come in a variety of sizes. "10 red potatoes" isn't enough information (I did find 3 lb. red potatoes works well). The recipe, as written, is very bland tasting, but apparently a lot of people like bland. I took some reviewers' suggestions and added 1 T. sweet pickle relish, subbed 1/2 of the mayonnaise with Miracle Whip, and added 2 chopped large dill pickles, which improved the flavor significantly. Will add more dill pickles next time. This is a great base recipe that can be tweaked to your liking. It is going into my recipe file.

We absolutely love this potato salad! I omit the eggs because I can't do hard boiled eggs, but do everything else as written; and I dont do that often. You must use Dukes mayo if you can; because its obviously the best!

I followed this recipe to a T except I didn't have green onions or celery, so I substituted a shallot. I definitely missed the crunch that the celery would have provided, but it was still delicious. The next time I make it (and I will!), I think I'll use more of a 60/40 mixture of mayo and sour cream, reducing the mayo a bit. I'll also use a bit more dijon.

By far this is the BEST recipie for potato salad I have ever made or eaten. I use a high fat content sour cream and full fat content mayo which makes it taste really creamy, but I think it's the addition of the vinegar that gives it that extra special something. I add the vinegar to the still warm cubed potatoes which gets absorbed while the potatoes cool down. Everyone always asks me to bring the potato salad, it's a golden recipe:)
Thank you to the original poster, it's a fantastic recipe!.

Holy Cow! This recipe is simply unbelievable. I am a guy and have never made potato salad one time in my life. I love dill and had a taste of a dill potato salad somewhere and I just decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint. After I finished making it I took it in the other room to have my wife taste test it and her eyes lit up. We both could hardly believe what we were tasting. I added a little bit of garlic salt, seasoning salt  and a splash of Mrs. Dash.  I seriously doubt that I would even try another potato salad recipe as I have found "the one".  Much appreciated.

I made it this morning, exactly as written except I used fresh dill, to bring to my dad's 70th birthday tonight. Hopefully there is still some left to bring, as I can't stop stealing spoonfuls. SO GOOD. Next time I might chop up a few dill pickles in it for even more dilly goodness and crunch, and maybe up the celery just a bit or add a bit of red bell pepper. I like a little extra crunch.

I have tried several potato salad recipes with various successes.  This is my absolute favorite!  I love the suggestion of squeezing fresh lemon on it before serving.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the Dijon, used 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp celery seed instead of celery salt, used a full tsp of black pepper, and added 2 Tbsp sweet relish.  After mixing all ingredients I mashed it up slightly with a potato masher while still leaving it quite chunky.

I made this as the recipe calls for with the addition of a little horseradish per some of the other review suggestions and it turned out fabulous! I made it a second time with celery seed instead of celery salt due to dietary needs at the time and it wasn't nearly as good. My newest favorite way to make Potato Salad!

This was a good base to go off of for potato salad, but it was definitely missing some things my family likes!  I like more hard boiled eggs than is called for, and have to have chunks of dill pickles in mine!  I think every bite should have potato, pickle, celery onion and egg in it!  The salad was bland, even with the vinegar and dijon, so I added some Miracle Whip for some tang and a whole lot more dijon.  I kept tasting it until it was to my liking.

I will first state that I LOVE potato salad, anytime of the year.  I have made my mom's recipe for years, sorry mom, but since I found this recipe a few years ago this is in only one I make.  The only change I make, which is just a personal preference, I add sweet pickles and a little of the juice to the mayo and sour cream.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly.

I use this recipe all the time. Because I do not like raw onion, I cook the potatoes with a fair portion of vidalia onion. I skip the eggs, and use lots of fresh celery when I do not have celery salt. Dill and sour cream make it the best ever. Also I have used \yukon gold and russets as well as red potatoes. Yummy every time!!

Amazing potato salad.  I did make a few changes. Due to a celery allergy I did not use celery or celery salt. I added smoked paprika and spicy brown mustard (to add a little kick) with the Dijon. I prefer to cube my potatoes and boil them in seasoned water for about 15min so the potatoes are flavorful!  Amazing recipe even with my minor tweaks!!!

I made this recipe many times and follow it exactly as indicated. I do add some crispy crumbled bacon, and sometimes fresh chives and extra dill, but that is a personal preference. The  1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream makes this a killer potato salad, and starting from the basics of this recipe you can tweak it to your liking. This is a keeper of a recipe, and following it to the letter won't steer you wrong. everyone I serve it do loves it.

This potato salad recipe is just awesome. I used any old type of potato and it came out great. I also did not use the egg, but may the next time. My husband, who is fussy about food in general, and my parents, who aren't really the mayonnaise type, loved this as well. They enjoyed the tanginess from the sour cream. What a hit this was!In fact, I just emailed Mom the recipe for tomorrow Father's Day BBQ!

I used 2 sprigs of fresh dill finely chopped and didn't need to use the dried dill at all and 3 hard boiled eggs instead of 5 and this is so good I couldn't stop tasting it before chilling! The dressing tastes a lot like my sour cream cucumber dressing & I'll definitely make it again.

I used all the other ingredients but, sour cream, celery, sweet onions or vinegar.  I added  spring onions.  The dish was great with the changes made!!!

Update:  Used cream cheese because I did not have sour cream. 1/23/16

This potato salad is a great base for whatever tweaks you have in mind. The sour cream/mayo is as good as the reviews stated. Bc of my daughter, I omitted the onion and added some pickle relish. Excellent.

Really like the tangy dressing but I think I added a little too much vinegar. To counteract that I added in half a teaspoon of Stevia sweetener for just a hint of sweet to balance the sour. Worked perfectly.  I also used a little less egg cause the ones I had on hand were jumbo size.  Will definitely make this one again for our many summer cookouts!

I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting the sour cream with plain yogurt because I had it on hand. It turned out to be one of the best potato salads I ever made. Creamy and flavorful without being too heavy.

Wow!!  Followed this recipe exactly and this potato salad had great flavor and very crunchy!!  The dressing is awesome!!  I guess it's your own personal taste if you want to add a little less or a little more flavor, but to be honest this is one of the best potato salad recipes that I have ever made!!

This is probably the best potato salad I've had. I did make a few modifications since I don't like celery. I used 2 dill pickle spears instead of celery, and I used 1/4 cup fresh dill instead of dried dill because I love fresh dill. I will definitely be making this again!

I did not follow the recipe as is.  I did not add the eggs, vinegar, or mustard.  I am not a fan of vinegar in potato salad. With these changes, I would give this recipe 5 stars for sure.

This is a very good and simple recipe. We really like it served with barbecue chicken or ribs.

To be fair I left out half of the ingredients, but I was looking for a simple dill potato salad and this most closely approximated what I was looking for. Everyone loved it. I omitted eggs, onions, celery and celery salt. Didn't need salt or pepper. It was fantastic!

This was a hit! It was my first time ever making potato salad and I chose it because I already had all the ingredients. However, I subsituted Dijon mustard with whole grain mustard and dried dill weed with fresh dill because that's what I had on hand.
