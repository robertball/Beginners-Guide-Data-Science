This recipe was awesome.  It is the best pecan pie I have ever eaten.  Although, I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe.  That gave it excellent flavor.  I made this pie for Christmas dinner, everyone raved about how wonderful it was.  Even people who didn't care for pecan pie said that it was excellent.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

Sorry folks, but I bake a lot of pies, and this is NOT a good pecan pie.  WAY too sweet, I felt like I was eating a few pecans with my cornsyrup.
On a positive note, it sets fine - as a matter of fact it was so thick when I poured it into the shell, it stuck to the spoon!  Experienced cooks - try another recipe, this one's not it.

I had been craving a pecan pie for a while so I decided to search for a recipe with good reviews.  This recipe certainly lived up to its rating. I was not used to a deep dish pecan pie though.  The kind my Mom always made was more shallow and chewy.  This pie is thick and gooey, but delicious.  Although the recipe did not call for it I was planning to add 1 tsp. of vanilla to the mixture before baking, but forgot.  My pie did not need it, it was wonderful as is.  I did take other reviewer's advice though, and added more pecans.  YUM!!  I will definitely be making this pie again!

This recipe needs 3/4 tsp vanilla, with it his is the best pecan pie. I get rave reviews. Well except for my mother in law. She insisted I use her traditional recipe because hers was better. Funny thing, one year I made both and she loved her recipe but my pie was gone in a flash. There is nothing wrong with the recipe. I have made this for years.*****Don't forget the salt. The trick to balance the sweet is more pecans and how you put the pie together. Put a nice layer of chopped pecans on the bottom before filling, some will rise and become candied on the top. Then put a nice layer of chopped on the top and then decorate with whole. I don't use a lot of whole because it makes it messier to cut up and eat.**** If your pie is too high in the oven it will take longer to set up. Ive always used a glass pan. You have to use a ring to protect the crust. I know at higher altitudes Ive had to put foil over the whole pie for an additional 10 minutes to get it to set. I give it a poke with a toothpick and a wiggle if it jiggles it needs more time. Experienced cooks know cooking times can be approximate. Let it cool completely on the counter to set. I always make mine the night before.******* For deep dish pies add 1/4 more sugar and syrup, one more egg and adjust to 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt.

This was my jumping off recipe for a chocolate pecan pie.  I'm basing my review for my additions.  However, I can't imagine that it wouldn't be grand as it is written.      I sprinkled the bottom of the deep dish crust, (unbaked), with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Instead of a full cup of light corn syrup I used 1/2 cup of light corn syrup and 1/2 cup of Lyle's Golden Cane Syrup, and added 2 tsp. of vanilla.  It gave the pie a wonderful caramel taste. I did have to bake about 1 1/2, but I tented the pie with aluminum foil so the top wouldn't burn.        It was absolutely what I was looking for, and it will be my go-to recipe in the future.  Thanks for letting me experiment with your wonderful recipe, Laurie.

I would give this more stars if I could. It was sooo very easy to make, and sooo yummy! My mom always makes the pecan pies for family gatherings, but I offered to bring them this year. They were a huge hit! I actually didn't have enough brown sugar for 2 pies - so I made 1 pie with brown sugar and 1 pie with white sugar. They were both fabulous! Thanks!

This makes a very good pecan pie!  Nice and rich, the way pecan pie should be!  I added a touch of vanilla, but otherwise made it per the recipe and it turned out great.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I love pecan pie and this one is no exception.  My only gripe was that it had to cook so long.  Knowing this from reading all the reviews, I covered the crust of my pie for all but the last 25 minutes.  And the pecans on the top of my pie did burn a little.  I'll find a way to remedy that, but overall it will be a good pie to serve at Thanksgiving.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit with all ages.  I did put foil over it until the last 20 minutes.

I have been makeing this recipe for over 30 years.  I have tried other pecan pie recipes but always go back to this one when I want the best or want to impress someone.  I have sold these pies at Christmas and Thanksgiving for several years and have return customers.

Amazing. I turned it into tarts. Used premade shells, and it made 30 tarts. The best.

I have used the same pecan pie recipe for years.  This will now replace it.  Wonderful!  I would recommend covering the edges of the crust with foil part way through.

This is a delicious recipe. I've made it several times for the holidays and get rave reviews. Its very simple to make, however I've always had to bake it longer than 60 minutes. That's never been an issue for the end result! Enjoy!

Wow this was fantastic!!!! This was the first time to make a pecan pie and was very pleased with the result. I don't have a 1/3 teaspoon so I only added 1/4 teaspoon of salt and it didn't matter at all. Still turned out really good. And I liked the fact that most of the ingredients were already in the pantry. My pie crust was frozen and I thought I had messed up by not thawing it but it turned out wonderfully.

This was fantastic-- I used the dark brown sugar which made a real difference in the taste.  I also added vanilla and more pecans than the recipe calls for.  I also had to bake mine a little longer.  It was delicious

I've always made pies for the holidays and recently married into a family of pecan pie enthusiasts!  It seems all the men in this family go bonkers for it - including my husband!
I was nervous about making the pecan pie last thanksgiving since I had only ever made one kind (not this recipe), and it hadn't turned out how I would have wanted.  With all those pecan pie lovers, I was afraid of ruining their thanksgiving pecan pie experience!
Well, I didn't have to worry.  This pie was *excellent*.  It set perfectly, and everyone loved it.  Some said it was the best pecan pie they have ever tasted, and they've all requested I make it again this Christmas!

I have made this pie about 6 times now for various occasions including Thanksgiving. It comes out fantastic everytime and is so easy to make. I have used store brought pie shell and even a graham cracker shell! Be sure to crush the pecans before you place them in the pie and don't let the mixture spilll over the crust.

Awesome Taste! A little bit runny/gooey even after plenty of time to set up but would make again. We placed pecan halves on the top for an interesting design. If you don't care about presentation (having the pie slice be picture perfect) then this is the pecan pie that dreams are made of! Next time I will add an extra egg for the consistency and then it will hopefully be picture perfect! Yum!

Very Very Sinful!  Just cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil after about 30 minutes, or when you notice the crust is getting a nice golden brown.

I have been playing with pecan pie recipes for a while, this one is the best tasting, easiest to prepare, without having to buy unusual ingredients not often kept on hand.  My family loves it, I have made it the last 2 thanksgivings.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was one of the best pecan pies i have ever had; A GREAT RECIPE.  I did make some changes like adding about twice the pecans and I used about 1/4 cup dark corn syrup and 3/4 cup white corn syrup.  It is not quite enough to fill a larger or deep pie crust, which is why I added more pecans - but next time I will make about 1 1/2 times the recipe for a deep 9" pie dish.  Overall - a fanstic recipe and a keeper - it is going in my recipe box for sure! Thanks!

This was my first attempt at pecan pie, and it turned out wonderfully!  This is really close to my all time favorite pecan pie from The Old Mill restaurant in Pigeon Forge, TN.  I chop the pecans into very small pieces and mix some throughout the filling, and then sprinkle the top.

I'd never made a Pecan Pie before and chose this recipe last Thanksgiving for our holiday dinner.  It was a hit and I've been asked to make it several times since.  My whole family loves it.  It's not too sweet and the filling sets very well.

While I love to cook and especially to bake, this was my first pie. I normally use coconut sugar instead of white sugar at my home. For those who think this might be too sweet, you might give it a try as it is less sweet that granulated white sugar. I used the recipe here on AR, for the, "french pastry," crust and it was truly divine! It may have been the best tasting pie we've ever had. I feel a bit guilty, giving just 4 stars for this. However, it didn't set up well for me. Perhaps I'll have more success with more practice and some tweaks.

Although I personally did not care for this pie, everyone else absolutely loved it!  It was very sweet.  I followed the recipe as is except I added about 1/2 cup more pecans.  I will probably make again.

A very good tasting pie, but very sweet and I am a sweet eater. I followed other reviewers advise and used a 10 inch pan and there was not enough filling! I had to make more to fill my pie. Stick with an 8 or 9 inch pan. I did like the color and flavor the brown sugar gave the pie. i will try this again cutting down on the brown sugar by about 1/3rd C.***Update...made this for Thanksgiving using 3/4 C brown sugar. It was perfect! Delicious and buttery tasting without being overly sweet.

I just loved this recipe, so easy to make and easier to eat! I  baked one for my mother in law, who suffers from diabetes,  I just substituted the corn syrup with agave nectar and it was wonderful, just a little less sweet.

Excellent! I added 2 Tbsp of Maker's Mark bourbon to it - made it even more of  Kentucky recipe :-).  Thanks for a great, no-fail pecan pie!

This recipe came out great for me! I added one tea spoon of vanilla, and after I put the pecans on top of the filling, I sprinkled a bit of filling over the top. I will definitely be making this again. My one complaint, and this is very minor and almost always my main complaint, is that the directions are not very exact. For example, I thought that the filling would be more of a paste, and less of a liquid. It set perfectly, but it would have been nice to know that pre-oven the filling was supposed to be very liquid.

This was the first pecan pie I ever made.  I made it as a tester for me and hubby the day before Thanksgiving.  It was amazing and gone by turkey day breakfast.  The last piece of pecan pie I had before this was from Goode Company and it is hands down the best pecan pie I ever had!  This was not quite Goode company but it was dang close with it's buttery deliciousness.  However, because my last comparison was so dang good I struggled with giving this a 4 or a 5.  I decided I would wait and rate it until after Thanksgiving day dinner at my inlaws so I could compare.  As you see, I gave it a 5.  My mother in law makes a dang good pecan pie and this one was better ....sssshhhh :)  Mine set just fine.  I covered the entire thing with folil for the first 30 minutes and left it uncovered for the rest.  I had no problems with the crust or pecans burning.  I also used the chrisco pie crust recipe which was super easy and was a nice contrast to the super sweet buttery pie filling. I highly recommend this recipe.

I make this pie each year at the holidays as it is my husbands favorite - in fact- this was the first recipe I ever used from the allrecipes site!  I use a store bought refrigerated pie crust and always use extra pecans (at least 1.5 cups!) You need to bake for the full 60 minutes to get the perfect consistency.  You will also need to cover the edges of your crust to keep from over-browning (I remove the foil about 40 minutes into cook time).  As others have suggested, I recently added a dash of vanilla to the mix- yummy! I don’t bake very much and this is SO easy! This is a staple pie in our house during the holidays – rich, decadent, and delicious!

This was the 3rd pecan pie that I've made this week and my favorite.  I am testing recipes before Thanksgiving since we have new food allergies and I don't want any surprises at dinner.  I used shortening instead of butter, I added a couple drops of butter extract, and 1 tsp of vanilla.  It came out perfect!  I have found my pecan pie recipe and now I can move on to pumpkin. :)

Wow! I have never liked pecan pie and I liked this. I wasn't sure about it after comparing it to other recipes I had and to other reviewers so I used four large eggs instead of three. I also added a little vanilla and baked the pie for about 60 minutes. I gave one of these pies to my carpenter and let's just say my bathroom is the best looking in the neighborhood! : )

I haven't made a pie in years, thought I would try this Pecan Pie for Thanksgiving.  I loved it, so did my family,  I ended up making another for the day after Thanksgiving,  took to friends, They all loved it. I did add an extra cup of chopped pecans to main pie mixture.  Put pecan halves on top.  Yum

Excellent! My first pecan pie ever and it turned out great. I added extra pecans after reading other reviews. I will probably stick with the original amount next time--I like to taste more of the filling but my husband said he wouldn't change a thing. I made my pie in a glass pie pan and set it on cookie sheet--Baking 60 minutes at 350 was exactly right for my pie.

This is a great recipe for pecan pie.  The only change I made was adding more pecans.  1 cup did not look like enough.  I used pecans from my mother in laws pecan trees.  They make all my recipes taste so good! My Mother said it is the best pecan pie shes ever tasted.

I live with a pecan pie lover, and made this for him.  We both think this recipe is fabulous!  I only sort-of liked pecan pie until yesterday when I had a bite of this.  
It is the perfect consistency and flavour.  The only change I made is to add more pecans (about 1/2-3/4 cup more).  One cup just did not look like enough on the pie.  I found that amount of nuts perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the sugar filling.
Excellent in the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" with homemade whipped cream.  (Don't whip the cream with too much sugar-- the pie is sweet enough!)
Congratulations, Laurie.  I now love pecan pie-- but only *this* pecan pie!

Super easy to make. I made this for Thanksgiving and it got raves. I cheated and used a bought pie crust. I also had to cover the edges of the crust with foil while baking to prevent burning them. But it was well worth it.

Great tasting pie.  Although, next time I will cook it a little longer.  Mine did not set in the middle and was a little runny.  But I still got comments about how great tasting it was.

I did make a couple of changes.  I doubled the recipe, added 1 extra egg and 1/2 cup of molasses.  Before adding the eggs I beat them till they were mixed well and then strained them through a sieve.  I then added the eggs to the rest of the ingredients. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of pecans.
I made 2 crust.
2-1/2 cups  King  Arthur Flour, 2 sticks (very cold) unsalted butter cubed, 1/2 tsp salt. I put the above 3 ingredients in a food processor and pulsed for about 30 to 45 seconds
I added about 7 tablespoons of ice water.
Mix till all ingredients hold together.  Form a ball and cut in half.  Roll out (both if making 2 pies ) place in pie pans ( I used 10 inch). Put in frig  till pie mix is ready and bake at 350° about 1 hr to 1 hr 10 min.
I thought this pie would be extremely sweet but to my surprise it was just right.

This pie is very easy to make and extremely good!  I used brown rice syrup in place of the corn syrup and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Turns out wonderfully, not too sweet at all (may be different with corn syrup).  I also protect the crust using tin foil for the first 30 min as suggested by others to prevent it from burning during the long cooking time.  A word to the wise - make sure the pecans are on top of the filling!  The nuts can withstand the heat.  if you have the filling on top, it will puff up like a soufle and burn (in my experience).  This pie does set up once cooled, but I always bake it on a cookie sheet to make it easier to take out of the oven.  It has the consistency of a pecan butter tart, and just as tasty!

This pecan pie was delicious and VERY sweet. I gave it four stars because the directions for baking aren't very explicit. It does take about 50 minutes--but if you're expecting a very firm consistency this may not be the pie for you. When it is done the top has crusted but the interior of the pie still moves; however, it will firm up after you take it out of the oven. I kept mine in for about 50 minutes and didn't want to keep it in longer because the crust was already light brown and the top was dark brown. When it has cooled, the consistency of the pie will be more like caramel. I would recommend this recipe overall, especially since the ingredients are so simple and straightforward. I did add some vanilla and a little bit of cinnamon to mine to give it some extra oomph. This pie got a lot of compliments.

This was my first time making pecan pie. I chose the perfect recipe!!! I added one teaspoon of vanilla as many others did and one tablespoon dark rum. I also doubled the pecans as suggested, I put one cup chopped pecans in the pie and used another cup whole on top. It was so delicious, not too sweet at all. Four of us ate the whole pie in a matter of hours!

I saw this pie had great reviews, except someone who said it was too sweet.  A pecan pie is sweet, they are supposed to be very sweet, hence the large amounts of sugar and corn syrup.  This recipe was perfect, my sister always won the grand prize ribbon for pies with a pecan pie that tasted just like this.  She would take halved pecans and carefully arrange them on top so it looked perfect just in case you want to try it out in a competition. Lastly, this pie is not the sweetest pecan pie I have ever tasted, there are some that make your teeth hurt from the sweetness, this is not one of them- this one's a keeper!

I followed the directions almost to the T.  The exception was I left it in the oven an extra 15 min. past the max baking time.  It still didn't set up.  I would like to know how long all of the successful pies baked for.  I can't believe my 350* is that much different than theirs.  And this ain't my first time around a pecan pie!

The taste was very good.  I didn't find it too sweet.  I thought it was rich and caramely.  I'm just disappointed that it didn't set up.  It was allowed to cool to room temp too.  More bake time would have burned it.  Foil on top?  Maybe.  The taste is worth giving it another go though.

For now it will be a delicious ice cream topping.

This is the only pecan pie recipe I have ever used but it is amazing! I have made this several times and even gave them out as Christmas presents last year, everyone loves it. It is very tasty and easy to make. You might want to cook it a little longer just so it is not runny inside, depending on your oven but it taste great either way. Just be sure not to burn the top.

This was my first time making any kind of pie.  It was simple and a crowd winner!  After reading the reviews I chose to cover the edge of the crust with foil for all but the last 15 minutes of baking time.  I also used 4 eggs instead of 3.  Delicious!!!

the center did not set at all , i followed directions but still ended up with a puddle of goo in the center , i never made pecan pie so wasnt sure how it would look while cooking it , maybe it needed cooked longer than recipe called for or maybe it should have been put in the fridge , dont know but it was probably something i did wrong because this recipe got great reviews ...maybe i'll try again and cook it a little longer than put it in the fridge

Pecan is my dad's favorite pie so i made him this after reading all of the great reviews. I did have to cook it about 20-30 minutes longer. 

But according to my dad, stepmom and brother, it was the best pecan pie ever. My stepmom said it tasted like it belonged on a restaurant menu. She said it was VERY rich and had a wonderful consistency.

Thanks for a great and dependable recipe!

I usually use four eggs, about a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla when I make my pecan pie and it is always wonderful.

This recipe is out of this world!  Very easy and oh-so good.  To make it a little bit richer, I used half a cup of dark brown sugar and a half cup of regular brown sugar.  Gives the pecans a candied taste.  Very, very good.  Definitely a keeper.

This was my first attempt at a pecan pie - and I'm glad I chose this recipe. The pie was easy to make, very classic/traditional in texture, and best of all, delicious. Definitely going to add this one to my recipe box.

Great Recipe. The only thing I did differenly was pour the pecans in the mix. I just prefer more pecans through out  the pie and not just on top.

Very good!!  I had to leave it in the oven for an extra 15-20 minutes at 375 degrees until less giggly, but after it cooled COMPLETELY, it was worth the wait.

Doubled pecans and drizzled some brandy over entire pie before baking for an hour at 350 degrees.  Crust was a beautiful golden brown and the pie not too sweet.  So unbelievably easy! Thank you for the recipe!

A pecan pie worth raving about!  Like other reviewers, I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract as well as adding in about 2 cups overall of pecans (1 c. chopped and 1 c. halves).  It was a HUGE hit at the family Thanksgiving meal - so much so that they are asking for this recipe for this year's meal because I won't be there!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

By far the best pecan pie I have ever tasted! It has the perfect sweetness and it's oh so gooey. All I added was a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.

Being that this was my first time making or even tasting pecan pie, I was a bit nervous ... but this was super easy and SO yummy that I'm not sure how I'd lived without it all these years! l had lots of others try it that knew what pecan pie should taste like and they all got that dreamy look of pure bliss on their faces and said they loved it! Thanks for such a great recipe! Like other reviewers suggested,  l added another half cup of rough chopped pecans. I added them to the batter on accident instead of sprinkling on top, but I love the day to pecans became candied so I'll probably keep doing that. l had to use dark Karo syrup as I had it and I did add a couple glugs of vanilla. I did not make my own crust this time and maybe that's why the filling seemed to sort of soak thru, so I had to more scoop it up then get a nice slice, but that's my fault, though I'm not sure how to change that next time. But I will for sure be making this a ton - but I'll have to make sure I give some away as l keep finding myself wandering in the kitchen accidentally sneaking a bite! Thanks again!

I like to follow a recipe, as written, to give a fair review. That said, our family didn't care for this pie. It is more "gooey" than jelly-like (the texture we prefer in pecan pies). Surprisingly, It did hold its shape, despite it's gooey texture. If you are just going for taste, the taste is pretty standard pecan pie.

This has been my mom's pie recipe forever and I have never eaten a pecan pie as good.   The only issue we ever had was that because the cooking time was so long, sometimes the pecans on top got too browned.  This was resolved by putting the pecans in the crust first and pouring the liquid over.  It also creates a nice shiny glaze to the top of your pie.  As others have mentioned, it should have a teaspoon of vanilla.  Delicious!

This is usually my goto pecan pie recipe...with 1 tsp of vanilla added....its also known as Dear Abby's Pecan Pie....a delicious pie...for whatever reason as this was being cut at the table it was a gooey mess in the middle....It was totally cooked and looked beautiful as I really try to place my pecans decoratively on top.....even though it tasted very good....I was a bit embarrassed with its "runny-ness". Not sure if the karo syrup has anything to do with this.....I also made Pecan Pie V from this site the other day and that does not call for any corn syrup.....and that pie was amazing to cut w/o any sloppy mess and tasted just as delicious.

I made this in a graham cracker crust instead of the regular pastry style crust.  It was quite good!  I also added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tbsp coffee.

This pie did not set up! Made a nice crunchy top, with soupy goo underneath! 
We're chopping it up to use for ice cream topping, but I won't make this pie again.

Perfect!  Be sure to use the best pecans you can find.  I bought pecan halves and coarsely chopped them (adding a little extra), and garnished with a pecan half on each slice.  Picture-perfect and the best pecan pie I've ever tasted.

i really did not care for the taste - more like caramel pie with pecans. this is easy and quick, and i have to say, my parents and brother liked it. but i definitely love my mom's recipe a whole lot better. my husband is not a sweet-eater, but he does like pecan pie. i made two (one for my brother's birthday and one for my husband's); my husband barely touched it, and my 3-year-old wanted nothing to do with it. sorry, but i won't make this again. 4 stars because of the reviews from mom, dad, and bro. i would have given 3 otherwise.

This is sooooo good.  I use either a deep dish pie crust or a 10" pie crust.  It makes alot of filling.  I also mix the pecans in with the filling.

I made 2 pies (forgetting to put salt in one of them) and they both turned out excellent!  My in-laws loved it...it was my first contribution to Thanksgiving!  I'm giving this 5 stars due to it resulting in pies with great flavor and simple to make!

This was my first time making a Pecan pie and everyone loved it. Some friends didn't believe I made it, they had the nerve to say that I purchase it from a bakery.

I took some hints from other reviews like adding an extra 1/2 of cup of pecans, adding an extra egg and covering the crush once it has golden.

Great pecan pie! Very sweet, which is of course the point of pecan pie. My husband loved it, and he's a pecan pie critic. It was the first time I had made or eaten pecan pie, and I thought it was great.

This is, by far, the BEST Pecan Pie I have ever tasted! I usually have to double the recipe to make sure there's enough to go around for family functions - this goes so quickly! This is incredibly easy to make and definitely worth what little effort you have to put in to make it. :) Thank you so much for the recipe!

Other than being too sweet and rich for my taste, this pie was very very good.  Unlike some reviewers, it did not take mine as long to cook.  It actually overcooked after 60 minutes, so I baked another one for 50 minutes and with a little less sugar (2/3 cup) and less butter (2 1/2 TBSP).  It probably could have come out after 45 minutes cooking time.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This pie is great! I used an extra 1/2 cup of pecans and mixed them in with the filling instead of sprinkling them on the top. Looked and tasted excellent!!!

Really good pie! My husband said he wished I didn't like it so that he could eat the whole thing himself :-)  Bummer for him!  The texture of the filling was a little weird, not as "smooth" as some other pecan pies I've had but it wasn't enough to make me not like this recipe.  I'll definitely be making it again....hubby is already asking for another one!

My husband is from the south and pecan pie is one of his down home favorites, and I could never seem to get it quite right, but he loved this!!  He shared it with his brother, who agreed that this is one of the better pecan pies I have ever made!

I only had 3/4 cup white corn syrup, so I added 1/4 cup dark corn syrup to make up the difference.  My family said it was the best pecan pie they ever had.  And that's saying alot.

I used a frozen pie crust, and everyone thought it was a store-bought pie from the looks of it.  The pie was beautiful!  I used a cup and a half of pecans.  The pie set up perfectly, and was absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe and the pecan pie recipe off the back of Karo syrup and
 my husband preferred this one way above the Karo recipe.  My children loved it
 also.  I prefer to heat it up for 20 sec. in the microwave.

Wonderful pie!  We added vanilla, because we like vanilla.  We also had to cook the pie a little over an hour - but we're in higher altitude, and that might have made the difference.  Yummy!

This recipe was gIven to me by my mother in 1975. It was published in the newspaper column called Dear Abby. According to the article Abby was given the recipe  by the chef of the Phoenix Hotel in Lexington. Ky. My mother gave me the clipping and I make this pie every Christmas.
It is a tradition and a family favourite.

I decided last week I wanted to learn how to make delicious pies. I have fond memories of my friend's mothers kentucky pecan pie so I chose this as pie #1. Turned out perfectly!! Not too sweet as some reviews have indicated. I did use a light corn syrup to achieve this. My chef buddy who knows what is what, tried out the pie and was impressed. I love this recipe and will experiment some but the basic recipe as is is excellent. Next I want to learn to make my own crust. That will seal the deal with this pie for sure.

Looked and tasted good as I followed the initial recipe minus taking some suggestions of cooking at a lower temperature for a little longer.  The only change I would make is because the pie was very sweet so I would cut back on some of the sugar.

I made this pie two different times. Once to try it out and for Christmas dinner. The first time I made it was my first time to make a pie ever, turned out great! My husband and daughter's favorite pie is pecan and they loved it. The second time i made it I made it with dark corn syrup and like it better. This is a great recipe. Thanks!

I have never made a pecan pie before, but my grandson requested it for Thanksgiving this year.  I found this recipe, which promised to be good... it wasn't just good, it was wonderful.  The whole family raved about it, and said it has to become a part of our Thanksgiving tradition.

This was really easy and extremely delicious!  This was my first time making pecan pie and I'll be doing it again. :)  I did add a tsp of vanilla per the others suggestions and think the pie needs it. 
 Because of this recipe I've been dubbed the official pecan pie maker for family dinners from now on.

I paired this with your No Fail Pie Crust 1 and am now the official Thanksgiving pie baker! I added the vanilla as suggested, but I also altered the baking directions. I started by baking the pie at 425* for the first 15 minutes, then reduced the heat to 350* for the remaining time. I also baked it on a parchment lined baking sheet on the BOTTOM rack. My crust browned beautifully and was flakey on the bottom and the side. Voted best pecan pie in my family!

Excellent recipe.  I used dark corn syrup and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the mix.  I also doubled the pecans, using whole ones for the top layer.
The crust I use has four ingredients:  AP flour, lard, salt, and ice water.

I agree that no changes need to be made to make this simple, yet fabulous pie.
I did enhance it with 1tsp.vanilla, and 1 Tbl Boubon. For extra excitement I added 1/4 c of chocolate chips in the bottom of the pie crust, mostly for the kids. Also used 2 cups Peacans and toasted them for 7 min on parchment paper. Simple or dressed up, really good!!

My first shot at making a Pecan Pie. I made it for our family Easter Dinner and everyone loved it. It turned out great and was so easy to make. I do need to find a good crust recipe. I used the store bought crust in the dairy case. Left much to be desired.

This recipe first appeared in a Dear Abby column in 1974.  I remember because that was the year I  married and I made it for our first Thanksgiving and  for every holuday since. It is  delicious .  The original calls for a tsp of vanilla.  The one bad review i read about this pie said  the filling was so thick they had to scrape it off the spoon when putting in the pie crust.  That person made it wrong .  This is  a very liquid filling that sets as it bakes.   If this is your first time making a pecan pie, learn from my mistakes.  Always check your oven temperature with an oven thermometer.   If it is off even a few degrees your pie will be cooked in the outside and liquid in the center.  It must cook at least 50 minutes.  If it starts to brown too much around the edges, cover with foil.  Your filling should be jiggly  but not wavy.   Put a knife in and when it comes out clean it's good.  If you overcook it will taste eggy.   You can use margarine...in fact that's what the 1974 recipe called for.   I used Parkay  .  I use butter now, but margarine tastes fine.  I sometimes use light corn syrup and dark brown sugar, or dark corn syrup and light brown sugar...it's all good.  This is a very rich pie.  Real whipped cream is perfect with it.  You must try this if you love pecan pie.  And if you don't,  You will after making this!

This was the first pecan pie I have ever made and it turned out really yummy!  I used dark brown sugar which gave it a really deep, rich flavor!  I also added a little bourbon!  Yumm!  I would make this again for sure WITH the dark brown sugar and bourbon!  I also used whole pecans instead of chopped and just added them to the top.  I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it!

A spectacular pie: I only added one thing: Southern Comfort, approx 1/4 cup, to the pie mixture prior to baking; add very slowly, mix well. 
You should do this, you won't be sorry.

It was good, though maybe 50-ish minutes in the oven wasn't quite enough-- still a bit runny after refrigerating overnight.

It turned out a little runny in the middle, but if I had baked it longer, the pecans would have burned.  It was a little too sweet for my taste.

If you add 1 tsp of vanilla, this is Dear Abbey's pecan pie recipe and as my Mom always said "It's the best I ever ate"!!  I agree

This is not Kentucky Pecan pie.  It's supposed to have chocolate chips in  the recipe.

A new family favorite. This was a very flavorful, delicious pie. I too added the tsp of vanilla as well as taking measures to be sure my crust didn't brown too much. It had a great buttery taste and was nice and rich. It only last one day!

Quick and easy to make.  The only problem I had was that the filling only filled 1/2 of a 9" pie shell so I made a second filling and added about 2/3rd's of it to fill the pie shell.  I also used whole pecans for the topping rather than chopped.  It was delicious.  A definite hit.

The filling is too sweet, and not clear like we like it.  The recipe is ok, the pie got eaten, but not the best.
