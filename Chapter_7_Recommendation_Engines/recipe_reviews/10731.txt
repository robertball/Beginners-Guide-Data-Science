These turned out beautifully. I learned how to make these when I lived in Germany, but I lost the recipe. This one seems identical. Make sure to cut out extra tops, because they will ocassionally crack during baking. In true German style, I love to put sauerkirsch (sour cherry) jam in the middle for a kick of tartness.

Perfect. I struggled to use my mother in law's recipe, which is in German and uses weights rather than volume measurements. This recipe worked beautifully and even my German husband was thrilled. Thank you so much! Now that Advent is approaching, I plan to make several batches!

Lovely, light cookie!  I wasn't able to give the recipe five stars, though, due to the following errors:

If the dough were rolled out to 3/4" thickness, not only would you have a cookie that's 1-1/2" high when finished,  there's no way, unless each was only about an inch around, you'd be able to cut out 60 cookies in order to make 30.  I rolled out my dough to about 3/16", and I got 40 heart shaped cookies, 2" wide at the widest part.  Almost all other Spitzbuben recipes say to roll out the dough to 1/4" (one said 1/8").

I warmed up about 3/4c. preserves, and I had a few of tablespoons leftover.  1/2c. would have been plenty.  

Minor oops is the typo in the second to last sentence.  ;0)

These cookies are delicious!  This has quickly become a new family favorite...I made a batch to send to my grandmother, but they were all gone before I could get them in the mail!

These are very yummy. The only reason it isnt getting 5 stars is because it was a real pain to make. Ive never made these before so I did not know if what I was doing is right. I wish the directions were more detailed. My dough was very crumbly and hard to work with, I dont know if it was supposed to be this way or if I did something wrong? The taste was great though. I also didnt know if the cookies were supposed to be golden when taking them out of the oven, so I just did 8 minutes (not golden, but tasted good) so I guess thats how their supposed to be.

Made these for a school project... A food from Switzerland.  Made two slight modifications... rolled dough much thinner than 3/4 in. more like 1/8 - 1/4.  Didn't have time to make the vanilla sugar (although it intrigues me) so I added a splash of vanilla  extract when I added plain granulated sugar.  We made about 30 complete cookies.  The snowman was about two inches tall and about an inch wide.  YUM!  Will add to my cookie jar favorites year round!  Thinking it will be fun to make flowers in the spring!

It made 4 dozen cookies, using the William Sonoma thumbprint cookie stamps, heart, circle, and rectangle. I rolled the dough thick, at 5/16ths, or 8 mm, and cut the shapes right after mixing the dough. Then refrigerated the shapes, baking them the next morning on parchment. I baked at 400, rotating 180 degrees after 4min, cooking for another 4 min. Cooled on the sheet 1 min. After fully cooked, I filled the indentation with melted seedless raspberry jam.

This was perfect!  My daughter was doing report on Switzerland and needed to make a recipe.  They turned out great!  We used regular sugar instead of vanilla sugar, but only because of time constraints. Otherwise, strawberry and raspberry jams were delicious with them!
Thanks!

I made them for my Life Skills class for my project on Switzerland and my classmates just ATE THEM UP!!!! I used the Red Rasberry Jam for the filling. I can not wait to make them and try a different flavor jam. By the way has anyone ever used like a chocolate filling to me that sounds really good to me.
