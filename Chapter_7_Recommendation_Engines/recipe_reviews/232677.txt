I submitted this version and what I created originally does not show 1 cup water. Perhaps that was added by Allrecipes when it was published. That would definitely make it too soupy in my opinion. One tip is that I often use the pre-cooked bacon and it works just as well and saves a step.

Basic taste very good, very easy to make..."good enough for guests".  BUT...too sweet for us, also a little watery - the latter is surprising as I baked it uncovered and for longer than called for.  We will cut the brown sugar in half, will compensate by adding a little more molasses.  Also will cut the water in half.  I baked it longer than called for because we like a "crust".

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is because I needed to adjust the ketchup and molasses.  Made as written, it was too bland for my taste.  I'm not sure how much I adjusted; I just kept adding until it tasted correct.  I too lessened the water and brown sugar to 1/2 cup each.  I also sauteed the onion in some bacon fat for some added flavor.  With my adjustments, we loved it.

I really thought this was great & super easy. I will never eat premade canned beans again! I totally forgot to add the brown sugar which was a good thing. I added extra bacon though, and sautéed my onion in the bacon fat before mixing! Delish...thank you!

I'm making these for the second time! Actually the friends I made it for last time requested it! They were very good and very simple to make. I had never made baked beans before. This time I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and the water to 1/4 cup. I also added a little extra ketchup and molasses. The recipe was great, I just like my beans a little less sweet. Both times the turned out great!

The ingredients in this recipe are exactly what we've used in my family for generations, so I thought I'd give using canned beans a try! (PS. My dog said he didn't give out the recipe! LOL) I used Goya Small White beans which eliminated the traditional process of soaking, boiling, etc.  Also, because the canned beans are precooked, the actual bean pot to table time was considerably less. Great short cut! Glad I tried it! Thanks Mariap430!

Very good basic recipe, and I liked that it didn't call for a can of pork and beans/baked beans in the ingredients like so many others!  I made this for the 4th of July when I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any canned beans to have with dinner.  I used 2 cans pinto beans (because that's what I had on hand), substituted honey for the molasses (because we didn't have any), reduced the brown sugar to 1/2C. and omitted the bacon because I didn't want to wait for it to thaw.  I didn't have time to bake them, so I cooked them on the stovetop for about 40 minutes while waiting for my husband to cook the hot dogs.  Next time I will definitely do them in the crock pot or oven as the beans were a little too firm.  But the flavor was PERFECT!

Made this for the first time never making baked beans before and with very little cooking experience and it came out great. I honestly could not have made it as good as i did if it wasnt for the comments about how the cup of water made it too soupy. That's the only thing i omitted and it came out great. I know i am going to be making this again in the future.

Taste is good but is way too soupy for us.  I would think about trying this again with half the water and taking the foil off sooner.

I love this recipe! It's my go-to for baked beans and I've made it at least a dozen times. It's great as is, however, I like to double the beans and just use a combination of whatever beans I have on hand (usually pinto and black beans) and I add an extra 1/2 C of water. I also don't crisp the bacon, just cook it until it's lightly browned, since I don't like sharp bits in my beans.

Make this to take to a cookout and it was delicious. I didn’t use the bacon as there were people that are vegans. But was a hit with everyone

This was a hit, comments made by guests, “ best baked beans ever”. I added 3 cans of beans organic low sodium northern white beans, reduced the water to 1/2 cup, sautéed onions in bacon fat, 1/2 cup brown sugar. This recipe will be a BBQ favorite.

Followed the recipe. The flavor was good, BUT, I would omit the cup of water next time and make sure the onions are diced.

These came out every bit as good as Moms. I added about a 1/2 cup of good Vermont maple syrup, extra salt pork and 2 good heaping tablespoons of brown sugar, along with the mollasis. Skipped any stove top cooking except for the pre simmer of the beans to get them soft. I had soaked my beans for 18 hrs. mixed all ingredients in and right into the oven. quite tasty.

Fantastic!
Did not add the water, used tempeh instead of bacon, used leftover oil in that pan to cook the onions and I did not bake long.

I just made this home-made baked beans recipe and my family LOVES it! I did alter the recipe a smidge though---I substituted onion powder for the fresh onions (since my husband can't handle the real thing), I only used 2 tablespoons of molasses since other reviews state it was a bit too sweet with 3, and I didn't put the bacon in it because I was all out. Even with these changes, this recipe was easy to make and very delicious!

This was very good. Took it to a party and it got rave comments. I did cut the brown sugar in half after reading the comments and I was glad I did. I also added an additional can of beans and cut the water down a little bit. It was still a little soupy after cooking longer than recommended. If you want it a bit drier, definitely plan on more time. Overall, pleased with the products and the bacon cooking is the most time consuming.

I added less bacon as its harder to find where we live, and next time I will make the mustard a tiny amount.  Good recipe for baked beans we cannot buy!

I loved the flavor of these beans. I cooked them in the crockpot for few hours. I took the advice of others and halved the sugar but did put probably 1/2 cup of water since it was in the crockpot. I used jowl bacon that I diced up but did not brown, again....the crockpot thing. I'm getting ready to make them for the 3rd time. Try it, you'll like it!!!

This was a great recipe and tasted fabulous.  After reading the previous reviews of sweetness, I did cut the brown sugar and molasses as well as added 2 additional cans of beans! What a great dish!

This really is delicious, different than a normal baked bean dish. I will cut back a little on the water next time as I would have liked it to be a little thicker, otherwise really good!

I made the recipe *almost* as directed...I put in WAY more onions (cooked with the bacon) and bacon than what the recipe calls for.  I used the full cup of water and thought that it might  end up to soupy. I cooked in my cast iron pot and it ended up not being soupy at all. I had to pull it out of the pot before it got to dry and put it in a little crock pot to take to a Christmas get together.

I never thought I'd love baked beans, but here we are. I reduced the water to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 1/3 cup. I increased the bacon to 1 lb, and saute the onions in the bacon fat left over.

This was delicious! It had been years since I made baked beans, so I needed a recipe! Once the bacon was cooked, I drained most of the grease from the pan and sautéed the onion before adding it to the bean mixture. I did not add the cup of water, but will probably add half a cup next time.

Made without  bacon. I have 3 picky eaters and thought I would have left overs since recipe is 8 servings. 
This was not enough!!!

Second time I had to double recipe to have enough for a family of 5.

I needed something quick to go with hotdogs for dinner and this fit the bill nicely!  I halved the recipe and used dried minced onion and prepackaged bacon pieces.  Also left out the water.  I mixed them up in a microwave safe covered dish and nuked em for five minutes with the lid on and three with it off.  They were very good!  I’ll definitely try again when I have more time to make them as written.

I leftmost out the bacon and used pork and beans because that’s all I had in the house.  Came out delicious.

Read a few reviews and made minor adjustments. Didn't add any water, I used undrained cans of G.N. beans. I only used 1/3C. of brown sugar, a 3oz. jar of pre-made bacon crumbles, and I eyed a squirt of BBQ sauce and a bigger squirt of ketchup to equal 3-4 TBLS. So simple, will definitely make again.

Very good! After reading the reviews, I cut the water in half. I’ll probably omit the water altogether next time because it’s not needed. I also sautéed the onion in some of the bacon grease. This was a big hit with my family and anytime I’m invited to a bbq, this is what I’ll bring!

changed it up a little accidentally!- the garlic powder came out really fast (not cooking at my house)- my son said ‘you just made a new dish’- we’re now calling it garlic baked beans- my grandson tasted them and gave me a thumbs up! they are pretty tasty!

Great recipe.  Doubled the amount and baked for 1 hr and 15 minutes.  Used less water and sugar and increased ketchup.  Will definitely make this again.

Loved the taste! I do add a little more molasses, and about a tablespoon or 2 of the bacon grease. We love the taste of bacon! Unfortunately, it is soupy, and after 45 minutes, its not even bubbling and the onions are still raw tasting. So I've been turning the temp up to 400 degrees. And, I like to cook mine in a cast iron skillet in the oven.

Flavor was fine but consistency was too liquidy.  It never congealed.  I will not make this recipe again.

One other thing. They did take a good hour to bake. They were real runny at 45 minutes. And that was without the water!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I'm glad that I saw the post from the submitter who stated that the water was added to the recipe after submission and to not add it. It would have made it really runny. I would also recommend taking the foil off for some of the baking time if you want the sauce to thicken at all. I left it on and it was a bit too watery for me. I stuck it back in the oven without foil and it was much better after about 10 minutes.

Just made it but didn't have any Onion so I grabbed 2 green onions from garden and cut them up in it. I hope it turns out right. It seems a bit watery. I hope it thickens. I will post on the result. ^.^ Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe, but I added green pepper, used dried prepared mustard & sauté onions in bacon grease.  No leftovers-clean pot!  No better compliment!!!  I like mine a little less juicy so after cooked uncovers to get the consistency I wanted.

I cooked this on the stove in an iron skillet and added chicken broth instead of water and cut back on the sugar. Big success at the family cookout.

Very good recipe.  I have so many canned white beans and not so many recipes for them.  I did make a few small changes.  I used raw honey (2 tbsp) in place of molasses (I didn't have it),  omitted the bacon(low fat diet) and water, used 1/2 c. brown sugar instead of 3/4 c.  I sauteed the onions with cooking spray in a 3 qt. pot and mixed in the rest of the ingredients.  I decided to bring to a boil, then simmer on very low heat for 2 hours.  The beans came out fantastic.  Great flavor.  Will definitely add to my go to sides.

First Homemade BB I have tried. Really great basic recipe. I made small adjustments just based on common sense and what my family and friends tend to like flavor wise and its definitely a hit!
