I made the mistake of using a very large head. Medium size would work much better.  Very tasty and easy too make. My husband went back for seconds and was glad we had more left over!  I didn't have havarti cheese so used Swiss. I suspect it would have been better with havarti, or at least different.  I like the ease of preparation and flavor!

This was delicious!  I have to admit that I changed it by using cheddar cheese, but the texture was also really wonderful. One thing I noticed was that I needed to use waaayyy more water than the half cup suggested (the cauliflower kept burning). Great recipe though, and something I will definitely put in heavy rotation.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used mozzarella and parmesan since thats what I had. I spiced it with Lowry's Seasoning Salt and Old Bay mixed in with the onion, mushroom and leftover florets.  My wife was absolutely blown away.  5 stars.

It turned out very good. Mushrooms are one of my favorites. When I make it again Iâ€™m going to add walnuts and or pecans. That should add some protein to the dish and some crunch.

Very good. Cauliflower took 30 mins to steam and u have to keep adding a lot more water. I used blue cheese and Gouda.
