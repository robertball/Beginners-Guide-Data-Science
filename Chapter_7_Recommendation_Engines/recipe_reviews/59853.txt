This was an AWESOME pancake recipe. I didn't have rye flour so used 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead. I also added a few tablespoons of flaxseed oil and used walnuts instead of pecans. The batter was very thick so ended up using 1 cup of soy milk and 1 cup of water. They came out perfect, moist and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, absolutely fantastic.  Light and fluffy, tasty, and satisfying in a way I never thought "healthy" pancakes could be.  I will definitely make this again, and probably soon.

I didn't have rye flour, so I just used whole wheat, and I used sunflower seeds instead of pecans.  I also added two sliced bananas, although apple cubes would be good too.  I needed to add another 1/4c - 1/2c of liquid, though, as it was more like dough than batter.

I didn't have rye or soy flour, so I used whole grain instead.  After adding in the liquids, I found it a bit too thin, so I mixed in half a banana to thicken it up a bit.  Turned out really great and amazingly fluffy!

Very good. I just finished eating a pancake sandwich made by smearing crunchy peanut butter between two pancakes. I made a simple vegan fudge sauce out of 2-3 tbsp dark unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/2 cup vanilla soy milk, 4 packets of splenda, and a pinch salt warmed up in the microwave together. Cut the pancake sandwich into four and dipped into the fudge sauce. Tastes like a Reeses peanut butter cup pancake.

These pancakes were delicious! Definitely not like the usual whole grain pancakes. They were light and fluffy, and the exact same texture as regular pancakes. I used the recipe to make waffles, and instead of pecans I added some rolled oats and blueberries. So good! I had to add some extra liquid though, about 1/4 c.

My 7 year old and I went Vegan recently, so I have to relearn many things including making pancakes.  These were better tasting than regular pancakes!  I used whole wheat flour, rice milk, and raw sugar.  I must comment that white sugar is NOT vegan.  This recipe will be used often!

I made this for my kids this morning because our cupboards were bare and we had no eggs.  These turned out to be the best pancakes I have ever made.  Used only whole wheat flour and whole milk instead of soy. YUM!!

Mmmm I am a fan! I didn't have rye flour, so used ww with a little buckwheat and flax mixed in. I also used almond milk instead of the soy. Then I mixed some frozen blueberries in and topped with real maple syrup. YUM.

Update - made these with rye flour today and fresh blueberries. Forgot how good these are!!

These were very good, but this recipe does NOT make 4 servings!  Double or triple the recipe if you want to serve more than yourself.  (I didn't have the problem with them being too thick like other people did.)

I am not a vegan but my 22 month old son has an egg allergy. I used what I had on hand for these hearty pancakes and he loved them!I added small apples pieces and that seemed to add a bit more moisture.

These don't taste great (well not with all whole wheat flour and regular milk and no pecans) but they worked when I was out of eggs! Add some syrup and they are eaten right up - they really are fairly light and not bad. I'd make them again in a pinch but not for any other reason. :) Oh and I needed extra milk - probably because I used all whole wheat flour.

The answer to the question: "What happens when you just announced 'pancakes' to your kids - and then you find NO EGGS!"? I used this as a springboard.  1 Cup whole wheat flour 1/8 Cup cornmeal nutmeg instead of cinnamon apple juice in stead of water 2 tsp Baking Powder for extra fluff!  I threw some frozen strawberries into a pan with a splash of pure maple syrup for topping. Kids had them with just the syrup and loved them.

I double the cinnamon and add 1 cup of apple sauce instead of water - not "light and fluffy," but good, filling pancakes that get me through the morning.

I couldn't get these off of the skillet fast enough for my picky kids (ages 5, 3.5, & 2). They LOVED them! I only got one, which actually really filled me up -- I have no idea how they are each eating 4-6 pancakes! (I doubled the recipe, thankfully!) I used almonds instead of pecans, they were all I had. I used half whole wheat flour, half white flour -- making them not whole grain, but still fairly healthy IMO. They were NOT light and fluffy for me like some have said, but the denseness didn't take away from the overall taste at all! I definitely recommend using the cinnamon. It added a great flavor!

I'm not a vegan, I was just out of eggs. I used all AP flour, more cinnamon, and apple juice rather than water. The batter was still a little thick so I added milk until I got my desired consistency. My three kids really liked these.

I was really impressed by this recipe. I am not a vegan, but I have been looking for a good eggless pancake recipe, and this one is perfect. The texture and consistency turned out just like a regular pancake. I will be making these again.

These were pretty fluffy and a great alternative to regular pancakes.  I didn't have any eggs, so that's why I found this recipe.  I used regular all-purpose flour and all milk instead of half water and half milk and it was just perfect.

light & fluffy & better than some regular pancakes I've had. After reading other review I doubled it to feed my small family of four (husband, 1 year old, 3 year old, & me) we ate all of them. next time I will triple or quadruple it so we have leftovers for the next morning! I didn't have rye or soy flour so I used 1/2 rice flour, 1/2 cup oat bran & 2 T wheat germ (remember I doubled it) and I used a little honey instead of sugar. Everyone loved em! We'll be using this recipe from now on when we make pancakes.

I also chose these pancakes due to a lack of eggs, but managed to have most of the other ingredients.  For flour, I went with half and half wheat/white, and I added wheat berries, flax seed, and slivered almonds.  I went with cinnamon and nutmeg as well, but couldn't really taste it.  I'll add a bit more next time.

They're heavy, and slightly doughy (perfect!) and I liked having some crunch.  I'll make them again.

I thought the rye flavor might not be good in pancakes that are supposed to be sweet, but you really couldn't tell it was even in there. Really good grainy texture (if you like that) and really good flavor with cinnamon and maple syrup.

A bit thicker than non-vegan pancakes, but still very tasty! The cinnamon is a perfect touch, and if you're adventurous, might like to try a bit of nutmeg as well.

I'm not even vegan but I think these are the best pancakes ever! Wow! I didn't have rye flour so I substituted with half whole wheat flour and half ground flaxseed. The pecans should not be optional but are a MUST. I toasted the nuts first to enhance their flavour. I also used a little less water than the recipe calls for. I'm not going back to traditional pancakes!

I made with only whole wheat flour and skim milk.  Like another reviewer I did cut back on the liquid.  I made a double batch and cut back almost 1/4 cup of liquid.  I used the cinnamon and vanilla and these were delicious.  I found these when I was looking for something to make without eggs because we are all out.  I saved this and it will be our standard pancake recipe.  Even my five year old ate them and he is picky.  Thank you for posting.

Very tasty! I added wheat flax and wheat germ instead of the soy. It only made four though, so I'll have to add more liquid, maybe apple sauce next time. Raspberry sauce and blueberries in the mix made it fruity and nutty, too.

I just made these. In fact the plate with my second one is beside me. They are delicious! I made exactly the way the recipe said except I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts. I may try to add more water and milk next time as I think they would be even better lighter, and the batter would go farther. Great recipe!(Updated 6/8/09) I still make these pancakes often except now I always add a couple of ripe bananas. I still use walnuts and with the bananas it has the perfect taste for me.

WOW. This is a great recipe. It's so filling in the best way.

I also didn't have rye, so I substituted 1/4 cup ground flax seed, and 1/4 whole wheat flour.

It needed more liquid, probably about 1/4 cup of water. And a little more sugar, probably another 2 tsp. Other than that, this recipe is delicious! Thank you for posting.

These came out light and fluffy. I made some following the recipe exactly except using only whole wheat flour and they tasted great. (Not sure why one complained of bitter taste). I also made a batch using two ripe mashed bananas and they were wonderful!!
Thanks so much!

I liked the texture, but the overall taste was very bitter... I had to drown them in honey and butter, and still could taste the bitterness. Anyone have any tips on how to improve this, since I really do like the idea of using rye flour in pancakes. Thanks!

I just made these pancakes, substituting what I had on hand and they came out great!  I used a cup of organic wholewheat flour, 1 tbs. ground flax seed instead of soy flour, coconut milk instead of soy milk, panela (unrefined cane sugar), and bananas, topped with pure, organic maple syrup…thanks for the inspiration!

I experimented with adding 1/4 cup  of ground pecans and 1/4 cup of ground almonds, omitting the chopped pecans. Like many others, I didn't have rye flour or soy flour so I used all whole wheat flour (and a tiny amount of leftover white flour). After adding a little more liquid, the pancakes were exactly the medium-thin, soft/fluffy consistency beloved by my family. And yummy!

Like many people, I didn't have the various flours, only whole wheat.  It seemed a little runny once I mixed the wet and dry ingredients, so I substituted ground flax seed for the nuts.  The batter became so thick I decided to call these "pancake cookies" -- but then when we ate them, they were still very light!  Delicious with pure maple syrup (and organic sugar rather than white).  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Thank you thank you thank you!  We have missed pancakes.  I doubled the whole wheat flour since I did not have rye and replaced the soy flour with ground flaxseed.  I also used almond milk instead of soy and maple syrup instead of white sugar.  I did find that I needed to add a little more water/milk to these to thin them out a bit.  The texture was much better than I expected with the whole wheat flour and they were great with maple syrup on top.  Am sure they would be awesome with some fruit, peanut butter, and/or chocolate chips mixed in too!  So glad to have a healthy pancake recipe that actually tastes good!

i just ate one small one, my 7yr old girl and 6yr old boy too.  I used rice flour and white flour instead, and added 2 tablespoons of flax seed.  Added water until the mixture was thin enough to pour. And added chocolate chips and banana to the mix.  Delish with blueberry jam spread thinly over it, a tad of maple syrup and a red berry garnish sugar is not vegan if it's processed with pork bones.  :-)
