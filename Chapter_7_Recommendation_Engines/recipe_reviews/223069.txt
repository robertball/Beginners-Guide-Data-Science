I have made this recipe many times - I should've reviewed it a long time ago! Just like my gram used to make! I love it - I throw in a tablespoon granulated tapioca to thicken a little more and ad tsp vanilla to filling - also sub heavy cream for milk ( personal preference) I sometimes make galette w/ it which works fine as well -see pic I have won quite a few pie baking contests and have just qualified for state championship -if I say its great ...its great! Should've reviewed a long time ago! Also I am partial to most of chef johns recipes! Keep em coming!Great country style pie -not too many frills let's the fruit shine! Top w/ real whipped cream if you can

Everyone loved this twist on classic strawberry rhubarb pie! Don't omit the nutmeg, but don't go overboard...it gives it a nice custard flavor. Delicious.

Sooo good.  On the video someone said it was to runny for them, so I used 2 cups of sugar, and 1/4 flour.  My fruit wasn't nice and shinny even though I used the jam, but still SOOOO GOOD!!

Very good.  Easy to make.  I used frozen strawberries and rhubarb from our patch.  Used the basic flakey pie crust recipe from this site.  A nice different type of treat for summer.

Wonderful easy recipe w/lots of flavor.  I haven't had a strawberry rhubarb pie since I was a young girl.  I'm not a fan of a double crusted pie so this looked perfect.  I wouldn't consider myself a baker by any means but after having a huge craving for strawberry rhubarb & watching Chef John's video, I knew I could handle this. I didn't have enough sugar so I only used 1 1/4 cups (it was still sweet enough).  I did bake it an extra 10 minutes because I just wasn't sure that it was set, not sure I needed too.  My mother, who is an experienced baker was impressed by the glazed fruit on the top (excellant tip to brush it w/warmed jam - presentation was great).  It set beautifully after being in fridge.  Will definately make again, and again, and again.

I give two stars but might change rating after I taste/eat it.  It is still very runny and I baked it longer than the 1 hour...actually baked it for 1 hr and 45 minutes and still runny so I sure hope after I cool it, it changes, solid.

This is a really easy, fun recipe.  Everyone in my family loved this custard pie so much, I have made three in the past week.
Using a prepared, frozen pie crust is not what I usually do but I agree that it makes this recipe go quickly and it tasted great.
The custard filling is very generous in the 9" pie shell so don't over fill or you will have a mess in your oven.

This recipe saved my booty. It's a perfect blend of sweet, sour, and creamy. My daughter brought home a gallon of rhubarb from her friend's house and I hadn't a clue what to do with it. I'm glad I chose this recipe! It was amazing! FYI some pecans in the crust recipe will not go amiss.

the first time i read this i was going to put a 1/4 c water in then i read before dumping it thank goodness if yours ends up runny that might be why only use 1/4 teaspoon of water and 3 tablespoons milk. there is very little moisture in this besides the eggs mine turned out wonderful. Used course sugar on top over warm jelly ....

Tried this pie once before and everyone loved it. Did one today only used Splendra and sugar - free strawberry jam by Smuckers. Just as good. Whoopie! Now I can enjoy without guilt. I didn't tell anyone it was sugar-free til later. All loved it and said they would never have guessed. Will use this from now on.

I was very nervous when I made this bc I did it while my 1 yr old was taking a nap and was not able to get to the store but really wanted to try this. I ended up using what I had on hand which was 2 cups of strawberries and a cup and half of ruhbarb a 9 inch deep dish shell 1 cup and a quarter of sugar French vanilla coffe mate cuz I was out of milk apricot jelly for the glaze and I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg bc I was out. This tasted GREAT with that! Im sure if I had the proper ingredients this would be ridiculously outstanding! Thanks John!!

We would make this again! A family member doesn't like strawberries, so we substituted pineapple, and it tasted wonderful.

Store bought pie shells are always smaller than homemade so this recipe as written would way overfill one pie shell. I doubled this recipe and filled 3 pie shells perfectly. I also added 1.5-2 cups of strawberries to the mix just to use them up which worked out perfectly for my 3 pies. I baked in a convection at 325 on a cookie sheet, they were done at 1-hour (no spillage).

Nice, sweet pie. A bit too sweet for my taste after adding the custard. I cooked 2 pies (one slightly longer than the other) and neither set even after many hours in the fridge.

This is among the best pies I've ever made. Only made slight modifications. I added a little squeeze of lemon juice (I have a tree full, it goes in everything) & some orange zest to the fruit, & a little vanilla to the custard. I put a lattice top on it. Set up perfectly, even on a hot day. Wish I'd had this recipe when I was in Michigan last summer & up to my ears in rhubarb.

Made this and it was gone in 2 days.  I have shared with friends who also grow their own rhubarb. Of all he rhubarb recipes I have used this one is the Best!!!   For the topping I did change it some. I added 1/2 brown sugar, 1 cup oatmeal 1/2 stick butter, with the strawberry jam it gave it a nice crisp.

Absolutely delicious. Mine was not runny at all, but it had a little less liquid. I put in powdered milk and I didn't add the water, so the only liquid came from the eggs. I skipped the glaze on the top all together and I don't miss it. It really doesn't need that extra sweetness. The custard is well distributed and adds that extra flavor to the fruit.

I was excited to try this recipe.  I like rhubarb pie and I like strawberry rhubarb pie and I like custard added to pie.  But the custard was too sweet and it didn't mellow the tartness of the rhubarb because it was all at the bottom.  Sorry Chef John.  Next time I'm making a standard strawberry rhubarb pie and pouring hot custard sauce on top.  Then I know I'll be happy.

This pie was perfect. The only change I made was I forgot to put the butter on top before putting the pie in the oven. The results showed that the butter isn’t necessary. I will definitely be making it again.

I was introducing this to my bf who has never had rhubarb so I didn't want to scare him away with the tartness. I used half and half instead of 3-1 ratio of rhubarb. Turned out just as good!
I ended up having too much to fill my pie shell (which was the same dimensions as John's) so I had a smaller shell on hand and put the rest of the berries and custard into that. It didn't fill it up all the way so I made a basic crumble for the top. Both turned out great!

Ok, first off, this recipe is DELICIOUS!!!  I just made it for the first time to take to my family's Thanksgiving dinner.  It took longer to bake than the recipe said, but I had added some decorative crust to the top, so maybe that's why.  A toothpick came out clean after 1.5ish hours in the oven. So even though it still jiggled a little bit, I figured it was done.  It exceeded my expectations!  Perfect balance of tart to sweet to creamy.  I didn't cut the rhubarb smaller, just thawed a bag of chopped frozen stuff & tossed it in with the strawberries.  I will DEFINITELY be mashing this again!

Very yummy! This pie was super easy to make though I did not originally buy enough rhubarb stalks for 3 cups of rhubarb. I would recommend buying 4-5 stalks because 3 stalks only got me to 2 cups. I also added a little vanilla to the filling and used a premade unbaked crust from the store. I loved this pie it was yummy but not overly sweet. I ate it for breakfast this morning too!

This is, above and beyond, the best pie I have ever made! I used my homemade strawberry-rhubarb jam to glaze the pie and it made it even better.

I made this pie today and it was incredible. I had an extra cup of strawberries and an extra cup of rhubarb so I added an extra 1/3 cup of sugar and 3 tablespoons of flour plus 1 teaspoon Almond flavoring.  The strawberries were frozen so the pie turned out a little too wet. Next time I need to add a bit more flour. I made the custard as indicated. I didn't have strawberry jam on hand so I used strawberry/rhubarb.  This truly is the best rhubarb dessert I have ever had.

This is one of my FAVORITE recipes!  I love rhubarb but there aren't a lot of recipes aside from strawberry/rhubarb pie or crumble.  THIS is different and delicious!  I have made it many times and it is always a hit (even with those who think they don't like rhubarb)!

This is a recipe that I would hand down to my kids. I can only agree with the other reviewers... This recipe is amazing. I followed the recipe as closely as I could but I had to use gluten free all purpose flour and I substituted the nutmeg with cinnamon (could not find the nutmeg today).  I also used a store bought gluten free pie crust.  This pie ROCKED!  No problems with runnyness, texture was perfect, even slightly warm. To add to perfection, I would add some vanilla ice cream on the side.  Oh, I just remembered that the recipe was too big for my store bought pie crust and I had to use a second dish for baking. In addition the pie overflowed so make sure you put the pie on a cookie sheet to catch the spill in the oven.

This was easy and delicious - even though I only used 2 eggs and didn't have the filling mixed as well as in the video (which I watched AFTER I put it in the oven. Oops!).  I baked an extra 10 mins until it seemed more jiggly than sloshy in the middle.

Substituted sugar with calorie-free sweetener (Truvia) and real eggs with cholesterol-free egg product. Added vanilla.  Turned out to be quite good!

Really yummy.  I had to make in a pinch so I used store bought frozen crust.  The filling oozed out a lot. The glaze made such a difference to the look of the pie. Big hit at the table.  Thanks again Chef John!

Made this pie twice last week and it is fantastic - the filling is out of this world!!!!  My only problem is that I did use a frozen store  bought pie crust and it did not bake properly and stuck to the bottom of the pan.  What did I do wrong?   Going to make another but will make my own crust.  Any comments on the crust are welcome.

I think this recipe is wonderful.  The tart rhubarb is offset by the sweet custard.  I followed the recipe exactly except for a little change during baking & it turned out great.  I baked mine on a silpat baking mat in a cookie sheet for about 50 min, then moved the (glass) pie pan to the rack for another 20 min.  So I baked it an extra 10min from the original recipe.  The middle was still a bit jiggly when removing it from the oven but I figured it would set/bake a little more once it was out.  The finished product was great.  Could have *maybe* used a bit more baking, but it's still set enough it doesn't gel out when it's cut.  And this is when it is cooled and stored in the refrigerator.  **this pie is meant to be kept in the refrigerator & served cold otherwise it will ooze out and be too runny**  It's a keeper recipe for me.  I love custard pies and I love this pie recipe more than a regular strawberry rhubarb pie.

This was wickedly good.  I had no access to rhubarb, so I made the pie with four cups of strawberries.  My family loved it on Thanksgiving day.  I had to go ten minutes over the cooking time to get the correct consistency, but other than that, no problems.  This is a perfect impress-your-friends dessert, and they don't need to know how easy it is to make.

I really appreciate everyone who takes time to review recipes! I made a few changes based on earlier reviews: I reduced the sugar to one cup, added half a teaspoon of vanilla, and replaced the 3 tablespoons of flour with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. I also omitted the strawberry jam glaze. It was delicious and set up beautifully!

I liked the pie, but I also like more custard.  Hubby and I agree, double the custard next time.  Very easy to make.  Mine looked exactly like the picture.  (and for me that is a plus)

yes, it was easy, yes it tasted good, but mine did not hold up. it was runny and i did everything as instructed. and just as he said, it was solid, but with a little jiggle like in the video. it smelled delicious, but didn't look great! I used a 9" deep dish pyrex pie dish. Could that be the reason?The custard layer was not as thick as his. I would make it again if i knew how to remedy it. It definitely was not underbaked. Any ideas?

I didn't have strawberry jam, so I used some rhubarb curd that I made the night before as the glaze.  I'll definitely make this again. So. Good.

I was so excited to try this recipe!  Unfortunately, the custard never did set up.  I think maybe there was too much moisture in the rhubarb, but I poured liquid off - put it back in the oven for an extra 20 minutes... more puddles to pour off.  Won’t be doing this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written because I love Chef John's picks and videos. However, I added an additional 6 minutes bake time since it was still slightly runny in the middle (could have been my oven?).  Next time, I'll take reviewer Missy Huber's advise and add one tablespoon of tapioca to thicken it. No matter, it was FABULOUS!

Outstanding followed the recipe as given. Before serving put in the refrigerate cuts better--no need for ice cream or whip cream. Great flavor
Today I'm going to make the same recipe without the crust and serve as a custard. Will see???? I think it'll work LOL

Made this last night and it is delicious! As are all of Chef John's recipes! I did increase flour to 1/4 cup as others reviewers suggested. I also had used a larger deep dish pie pan so I added an additional 1 cup of rhubarb. Would have added more berry but was out.  This took about 1 hour and 15 minutes for some reason in my convection oven but sometimes I don't believe my oven is working correctly but I am noting this for myself for future reference. I used raspberry jam with water for the glaze as it was all I had and I knew it would work. I will make this again for sure. Used the pie crust recipe on the Crisco box as I was low on butter and it was flaky and browned up nice and I have another crust to use for other things. Loved this!

Way too sweet and did not set. Maybe adding cornstarch next time and cutting the sugar? I was very disappointed.

Followed the recipe and it tastes great. However it was quite runny. This is the second time I’ve made it and runny both times.

Loved the flavor but next time will add tapioca to thicken as some suggested. It was a little runny and I think would have benefited from a thickener. Will make again.

This was SO tasty! I had never tried rhubarb before (I know, ridiculous) so I decided on this recipe. Followed to the letter and it was insanely delicious! The custard IS really sweet but everything else is so tart and buttery that I found it a perfect balance (and I generally don't like things too sweet). Cook time was a a bit longer, but that's custard for you! My one complaint was after I refrigerated it the condensation from the cling wrap dripped down and made it look totally gross (user error here?). But once I got it in the bowl it didn't matter at all and it was SO good. I think this would be wonderful with an crumble topper or cherries instead of strawberry rhubarb. 10/10 will make again!

Delicious - made it for the first time.  Very easy! 
The tapping is important to keep the custard from pooling in one spot and not cooking completely and the turning. 
  I did not tap and am not sure if I did a full turn - all but one section settled (about one piece) and that is all I can think could cause it.  Every morsel was devoured by 5 grownups...and left them wanting more!  
If you use frozen berries or frozen rhubarb you MUST defrost and drain...or add extra flour,  It will not set up otherwise.

Followed the recipe perfectly, and had many issues. I ended up baking the pie for an extra half hour, and it didn't do anything to help the custard set.  I thought that maybe this was the reason that it needed to be refrigerated (which I did for several hours), but that did not help either, as when I cut into the pie it was incredibly runny.  The custard was also way too sweet.  An okay foundation for a recipe, but if I made it again I would probably use a different custard recipe, as the one provided in this recipe just wasted ingredients and time on my end.

Like other reviewers, I had to let the pie bake quite a bit longer. The taste and consistency outweighed the problematic extra baking time. Simple and delicious!

For many years I have made a rhubarb custard pie from a very old Better Homes and Gardens recipe book, but with out the strawberries.  I was pleased to find this almost identical  recipe with the addition of the strawberries.  For those who found it to be runny,  my  original recipe called for 1/4 cup flour.  That is what I used even with the strawberries, and it turned out perfectly.  It was a big hit at my community happy hour tonight.

Worst pie ever! After cooking for an hour it was still not set in the middle. The next morning I pulled the pie out of the refrigerator to find it did not set in the middle. The rhubarb was not soft and the taste was bad. I will not make this pie ever again.

I made this with a paté sucreé pastry, put it in a tart pan and flipped the untrimmed edges back over the filling so it looked like a gallete. The only change I made was to use frozen strawberries instead of fresh.
 It was spectacular both in appearance and taste. Chef John, you’ve done it again!!

The only changes I made was using buckwheat flour for the crust, I used less sugar, I used muscovado sugar, I used half and half instead of milk, a little gelatin just to make sure things firmed up, and I used dates instead of strawberries since it was all I had. It turned out a little different, but good; I love food play!

The only change I made was instead of the strawberry jam mixture on top, I sprinkled 1T of cinnamon and sugar mixture over top before baking and omitted the jam step.  It was Amazing !

I made this recipe, it seemed to be very wet after cutting although the taste was very pleasing. My next one I will do some experimenting with corn starch or a bit more flour, maybe tapioca to thicken up the custard for a better base.

Oh this pie looked so beautiful....I was so proud to give it as a gift for a coworkers' birthday, until it was cut into, and the too sweet custard spilled out the sides! I was so embarrassed. I had even put it in a pastry box. I made the recipe exactly as written and consider myself a very experienced baker having even worked as a baker in my twenties- in my mother's and grandmother's footsteps. It was way too sweet, and I had to bake it an additional 35 minutes. Just a waste. Reputation ruined. I just wanted to take it back and throw it in the trash but she was so gracious and appreciated the effort. If you must make this, decrease sugar to 1 cup and increase flour by a tbl or 2.

This was good and very simple to make. I did find that I thought the custard was a bit too sugary. Lots of the sugar sank to the bottom of the pie which then made a dense sugary layer across the bottom that I felt was too sweet. I will make this again and next time cut down on the sugar by a bit. Super easy and delicious though!

I liked it, but I would suggest you add a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg mixture. I used rhubarb from my garden, so the prep time was a bit longer than I expected, about 35 minutes. Otherwise it was a good recipe and I would make it again.

It was super simple to put together, though I'm not certain I'm sold on the custard. It was tasty, but I think I like strawberry rhubarb pie without the custard flavor in there.  I'll still probably make this again.  I made two the first time around, they turned out perfectly, took them to work, and shared around. Very well received.

I ended up putting a crust on the top and it took near forever to bake, and still hadn't firmed up. By the time the crust had browned, it still wasn't firm so I just turned the oven off and left the pie in overnight. 

WOW! The next day I served it and everyone was crazy for this recipe. IT's a new go-to! 

PROTIP: Peanut butter whipped cream (whipping cream, powdered sugar, peanut butter powder) was a very surprisingly perfect addition as a play on peanut-butter and jelly.

If you use a store bought pie crust - as suggested by the chef - you will not be able to fit in all the prepared custard filling. If you try (I did), be prepared for a huge spillover and mess!  Most of the custard was on the cookie sheet, and not in the pie.

I used about 50/50 rhubarb and strawberries as I had more strawberries then rhubarb.  I didn't make a pie but used frozen tart shells that I had in the freezer and wanted to use.   It was a bit messy to pour the custard into the shells but the end result was still delicious.   I didn't put the glaze on it.  After a few days later, the shells got soggy so next time l'll try using a pie shell.  Will make again.

Was kinda skeptical in the beginning because I tried the rhubarb by itself..I thought omg this is going to be nasty lol This was a wonderful recipe. Followed everything to the T except I used a shortbread pie crust..this was amazing!! Will make this again. My nephew even went back for seconds.

I made this and followed the recipe except I added a 1 1/4 cups of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups of sugar because it sounded like it was going to be too sweet.  It never jelled as a custard and it was too sweet in my opinion.  I did love the Chef John's crust though.

FANTASTIC. We loved this. I don't make a lot of home made pastry pies. But this is the fresh fruit season when I will go out of my way.  A little nervous about this because of soupy reviews. I do have other recipes that are good but we all like to try something new. Still it's a pie, and I want it to turn out.
So,,, I tried it. I trust Chef John and I always like to try it.
For us it was the right amount of sweet and tart. I followed exactly so I could judge properly and I had no problem. 
Custard was set beautifully. I used cream for the milk, I added 1 extra egg , and in my oven I had to cook an extra 20 minutes, and I refrigerated all afternoon. I also really like the jam glaze tip FANTASTIC. Iloveit

This is an excellent recipe. The only small change I made was to increase the flour to a scant 1/4 cup. I used the freshest and ripest strawberries I could get and the rhubarb came from my friend's garden. I will definitely be making it again, and will share the recipe with other pie baking friends.

This pie is delicious. I hadn't tried rhubarb before but I got some in my CSA share this week along with strawberries, so it was perfect. I washed and dried the fruit well, based on some other reviews saying the pie wouldn't set. I added a little more flour, a splash of vanilla and 2 shakes of cinnamon along with the nutmeg. It's the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I served it warm with whipped cream!  It was a huge hit!

OK,  my husband made this, his first pie.  he watched the video and he went by the instructions exactly.  He even took it out when they said to.  Not knowing much about pies he didn't think anything off the center being so running and I , since I am recovering from surgery wasn't in there to advice him to cook it longer, so first time not a complete success.  
Couple weeks better and I am feeling better so lets tackle this pie again.  He had used frozen strawberries so this time we used fresh.  Followed the recipe to the t.  After an hour it was obvious the custard still wasn't set.   I ended leaving it in a half hour more and even then the custard didn't ever really set the way I thought it should.  My husband checked our oven temp to make sure it was accurate and it was so we are not sure why it wasn't a complete success, but it did taste good.  Next my husband is tackling an apple pie,  lets hope he has a little more success or I think he will just stick to steaks and leave the baking to me.

This was my first experience with rhubarb, both cooking & eating it. I liked this recipe. I thought the custard was tasty and gave it the perfect balance of sweet and tart. It is very rich. This would've been a pretty quick recipe if I hadn't made my own pie crust.

Delicious! My changes include 2c rhubarb, 2c quartered strawberries, 1c sugar, no warm jam on top.  Added dash of vanilla extract in custard. Made with own pie crust (buttery flaky pie crust from this site) so cooked 70 minutes with all the butter bubbling then turned off oven but left in for few minutes. Served with vanilla whip cream.

This is a very delicious recipe.  It is so easy to make.  I used up the last of my frozen strawberries  (thawed and somewhat drained) with fresh rhubarb plus substituted 1 T of tapioca along with flour since frozen fruit is extra juicy.  My 5 yr. old nephew devoured his piece.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this last week and it was wonderful!  As a matter of fact, it was so good, I made two more yesterday.  The only changes I made were to use cinnamon instead of nutmeg, (I don't like nutmeg) and I used heavy cream instead of milk.  (I didn't have any milk on hand.)  This has become my favorite pie!  Too bad it is so hard to get rhubarb here in Arkansas.  On the second pie I made, I forgot to put the glaze on.  I really couldn't tell any difference.  I actually prefer it warm, instead of chilled.  I will definitely be making this as often as I can find rhubarb.

I thought this was very good though a little too sweet. I have to admit I added more strawberries than the recipe called for and my strawberries were very sweet so that might be why mine could have used less sugar. I've never had strawberry rhubarb pie so wasn't sure what to expect. It's definitely different tasting but my husband and my boys and I all liked it. BTW for those of you who are wondering how much rhubarb is 3 cups, it is about 3/4 pound. Hope this helps.

Hate to downgrade this recipe but the timing was off. I cooked for a little over an hour and it was still raw. I had to put it back in the oven after it had cooled for a few hours. I used frozen rhubarb which may have been the cause but I doubt it. It needed an additional 20 to 30 minutes. Taste is good but not spectacular.

I made this for my mom on Mothers Day, and made sure my sisters were there as well to taste it. This was absolutely incredible! I am definitely going to make it again. I used a ready made pie crust, and used strawberry rhubarb preserves to gloss the top, because I didn't have strawberry jam.

This was wonderful. You do need to refrigerate it so it will "set". I made it for company and was so worried it wouldn't ever set. It did, and they all loved it.

I have tried this recipe and it was delicious.Chef John does give clear instructions which make it easier to follow. Love his videos!  I am wondering though if recipe was obtained from the "The Best of the Shaker Cooking" cookbook. Interesting that the ingredients are pretty much the same. The Shakers didn't use strawberries and covered pie with lattice crust..Oven temps somewhat different.
Next time will make the Shaker's recipe and compare..

This was a ho-hum recipe for me. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I baked the pie for longer than stated because the custard still seemed to jiggly after 1 hour. I bake for about 1 hour 15 minutes at 350*. Refrigerated overnight. The texture of the pie is just weird - I don't have a better way to describe it. There's a layer of set custard on the bottom of the pie. And then a layer of runny custard on top with fruit mixed in. The flavor is ok, but the texture is off for what I would expect from a pie. I really wanted to like this and have another rhubarb recipe to add to my arsenal, but the custard just didn't work for me.

I made three of these for a Monday morning meeting.  It was the day after Mother's Day and many of those attending had just had a rhubarb dessert over the weekend.  Many of the people said that this pie was better than what they had for Mother's Day.  It's a very simple and basic pie recipe with a really clean taste of the fruit.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  I particularly liked the shiny glaze of the jelly.  I'll be making it again as long as my friends keep providing me with fresh rhubarb.  Thanks Chef John.

Plate-licking good! I didn't cook it long enough at 65 minutes, probably because I used frozen rhubarb, but delish nonetheless. I also used less sugar (1 heaping cup) as others recommended and it was still plenty sweet even for my insatiable sweet tooth. Others raved about it too.

This was fantastic!  The custard filling was just right, the juices didn't run all over the plate. Thanks Chef John!

Way too much sugar in this one--I would cut the sugar in half next time.  I also baked it .5 hours longer; it didn't seem like it was setting.

I'm making my second one right now.  This came out great!  Everyone in  my family enjoyed it and that is a rare thing indeed.  If you like rhubarb then this a nice pie to make.

Amazing recipe, my pie crust was smaller so I used 2/3 of the recipe. I baked for 45 minutes probably because of the smaller pie crust or my oven gets hot really fast but it turned out great! I skipped the last step (forgot about it ) but it was still great. Served it with ice cream but it tasted great without it too unlike most pies. It wasn't tangy bec, the custard tasted great and sooo easy to make. I added vanilla essence and cinnamon but no nutmeg.

I followd the recipe exactly, but I must have done something wrong (which seems to happen when I bake).  The rhubarb was crunchy.  Sorry Chef John, I'm not a very good student!

Now I know where the expression, "easy as pie" comes from, but don't tell my family!  This delicious pie with the sparkling ruby red finish could not have been easier. Thank you.
