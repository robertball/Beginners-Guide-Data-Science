We found this cake way too heavy for our tastes. Presentation was an issue because the texture seemed terribly uneven and I wasn't happy with that at all. Flavors were good but probably won't make this one again anytime soon. Sorry.

This is a recipe my mom used to make for us when I was little.  We called it "Nutty Cherry Chip Cake" because it had 1 cup chopped walnuts added to it.  I made it for the first time last night for my daughter's birthday, and it came out wonderful!  I would definitly add the nuts, and just sprinkle the top with powdered sugar.

Very good. I used applesauce instead of oil and it came out great. It is very moist on the inside.

very simple cake, quick and easy to assemble, no butter, and friendly enough for my little boy who likes cherries but is very picky indeed.
it was moist for most of the time and in spite of what you may think reading the recipe it does not turn out overly sweet.

This cake was okay, definitely not what I expected.  The flavors are pretty good, but the texture was strange- Not exactly moist, not exactly dry.  I considered making frosting for it, but since my issues with this recipe relate to the texture I didn't think it would really help.  I'm not sure I'd try this one again because there are other recipes to try.

I thought this was just okay.  It was fun to make - very easy and different, but I probably won't make again.  Just wasn't my favorite.  I'll keep searching for a really good cherry cake.

This recipe is okay.  It tastes pretty good and stays moist. It tastes better then it looks.  It doesn't win many points for presentation.  Many people mistake it for fruit cake.  Not sure how often I would make it.

Wonderful!  Just made it yesterday for an early Halloween party.  Didn't want to use a bundt pan, so I baked it in a 13x9x2 inch pan for 30-40 minutes.  Everybody loved it!

This cake was a hit!  I topped it off with whipped cream cheese icing.  We had a bbq and everyone wanted seconds of it.  I think next time I make it I'm going to add white chocale chips to it instead and see what that does.

I thought the looks and the texture were fine, but the flavor wasn't what I expected. I couldn't really taste the cherry - maybe it was kind of overwhelmed by the cinnamon?

I have now made this cake dozens of times and I have never heard anyone NOT like it. It is my new  specialty, but I gladly share the recipe, which by the way is EASY! I serve the cake with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze. I love this cake.

Good,tasty, fast recipe.  I served it with whipped cream, and a drizzle of chocolate. It was more of a hit with the adults then the kids.

This is an easy, good-tasting, satisfying cake, and the chocolate/cherry/vanilla flavor combination was new to me. It is a bit sweeter than I would have liked... I was hoping that more of the tart flavor from the cherries would come through. It's also a bit messy and hard to cut into neat slices.

I made it with white chocolate chips instead and it made it look prettier and more pink colored.  I took it to an engagement party and they loved it.  It could have baked a bit longer than 1 hour - it is thick.  Pros - easy to make and with white chips, pretty in color.  Cons - did come out a bit uneven and it is not that sweet if that is what you are looking for.

I've made this cake several times and have always gotten rave reviews. Looks and smells good. I'm lazy about the frosting-- all I do is melt chocolate chips or semi-sweet squares (even the dreaded canned chocolate frosting!) and drizzle over the top. Awesome!

I made this for a group of friends at work and they really liked it.  It's moist. My buddies like cream cheese frosting, so I made cream cheese frosting for it - so then it was extra yummy.  After I let it cool, I put in the refrigerator over night - which made it taste even better.  Easy and good.  ~ jen

Great for people who are allergic to dairy.  Go easy on the oil.  I melted semi-sweet chocolate squares instead of chips to create a more uniform texture.
