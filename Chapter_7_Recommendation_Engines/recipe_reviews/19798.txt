Wow, Grandma Grippin...thank you!!  Even though mine was nothing like a pudding, more like drop biscuits in syrup, it was really delicious.  I was a little skeptical about the amount of water called for, so I cut it down to 3 cups.  I used 1 cup of brown and 1 cup of white sugar in my syrup mixture.  My dough was really thick, so instead of dropping spoonfulls into the syrup, I rolled them into balls and flattened them out a little to resemble biscuts.  They cooked up beautifully...and there was plenty of sauce. I would make this again just for the biscuits!! I'll definitley keep this in my recipe box.  Thanks again!!

I fixed this for my family of 10.  It was a hit with all and everyone wanted seconds.  My husband, who was a bit skeptical about the brown sugar, said he really liked it and it was a keeper.  We will make this one again and real soon.  Thanks for the unique dessert.

Sounds like everyone was expecting something different that what this recipe really is.  You have to remember this is from an era where the people lived on hardly anything extravagant... but this was something that they could provide for their family as a treat.  My mom loved it as it reminded her of what my grandmother used to make for her as a child.  Definitely a recipe that brings back some memories of those who grew up on it.  To the author of the recipe!  Congratulations are sharing a genuine recipe that brings delightful memories back to those who grew up on this simple economical dessert!

Fortunately I had better results than the previous reviewer. I did find it a little too watery but that's easily adjustable. The flavor was great and hubby enjoyed it with frozen whipped cream. (He actually had thirds) This also froze well and hubby has been taking it to work for lunch. I'll make this again but will cut down the water to just three cups.

This was the WORST dessert I have ever had the misfortune of making. Honestly, I can't comprehend how anyone could like this. My mom, who always likes this kind of dessert, told my husband, "It taste worse then it looks." What is so delicious about cinnamon flavored biscuits, swimming in a sickingly sweet syrup??? Blech! Don't waste your time or ingredients!!

Well, I might have goofed with the recipe.  I tried to cut the recipe in half... and I think I added too much butter. It wasn't quite right at the end.  I will try it again - and may add some vanilla to the sauce like one of the reviewers suggested.

Wow! this is one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life.  This is the first time I've tried baked pudding and it certainly will not be the last.  I'll have to make this a monthly dessert.

This made a huge batch.  My kids weren't used to this type of pudding ("What, no box of powder mixed with milk?"), but my oldest was open-minded enough to try it.  He and I both loved the brown-sugary flavor.  Next time I'll just make half of a batch, though.

It's 1/12 cups of milk.
it's not too bad but there is too much syrup so u might want to cut down on the water and sugar when your making the syrup.
but yeah it's not too bad i've tasted worse.

How to Make This Recipe Work for You:  I started this recipe knowing I would have to make some adjustments.  Previous reviewers stated problems with thin, syrupy sauce, sauce boiling over in the oven, etc. so I cut the sugar syrup recipe in half (1 C. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. butter, 2 C water) and let the it simmer while preparing the 'biscuit' part  so as to reduce it a bit further.  For the second part of the recipe, I mixed the flour mixture into the creamed butter and sugar with a wooden spoon until it resembled pea-sized bits.  Then, I added milk (probably about 1 C; I eyeballed it) until the dough was of drop biscuit consistency.  I heeded the previous reviewer's advice and, rather than dropping the batter into the sauce by spoonfuls, I spread it into a greased 9x13 dish, used a large fork to tear holes in it, and poured the sugar syrup over the top.  The pudding was done after 25 minutes in my oven.  As expected, the sauce moved from top to bottom, and thickened nicely.  As-is, I would give the recipe 2.5 stars because of the excessive syrup, milk measurement, and because I think the dough should go in the pan before the syrup whether you drop it or spread it.  Even with my modifications, I give it 4 stars because while the flavor is good, the 'dough' part is still lacking (a little bit too much of a flour taste for me). I will try adding more spices to the dough, and adding another cup of sugar syrup because...well..I don't give up that easily :D

Thank you for a trip down memory lane. We found it to be very soupy like but good flavor. I added cool whip on top before serving. I will add vanilla next time and a little cornstarch to the brown sugar and water to thicken it a bit. I LOVED the "down home" simplicity to this recipe. Thank you for the old memories made new.

My family loved this pudding and say it is a def. keeper.  It was very easy and i had no problems with the sauce being too thin.  I may add a wee bit of vanilla to the sauce next time and of course, butter makes everything better!  A nice cake-like top with caramel sauce. Yum!

Granted...the flavor is good if you just eat the top, but it seems awfully strange to have the cooked bread part floating on hot sugar water.  This recipe was a waste of the last of my butter and brown sugar!

At first I didn't think that my family would like it. BUT, they LOVED IT!!! It's unlike any pudding that I've had.
Thanks for sharing this unique recipe. :-)

This is a lot like my mothers recipe for "Quick Pudding."  I put enough milk to make a thick batter.  Then spread the batter in the baking dish, and pour the brown sugar water over the batter... we also add 11/2 cups raisins to the batter.   When finished baking, the water and brown sugar and raisins are on the bottom and thickened.  We serve it with ice cream or whipped cream.

The taste is good, but it overflowed so BAD while cooking that my whole house filled with smoke and the smell of burning sugar. My hubby was so mad!!

Okay I am giving this four stars because I hated it, but my 88 year old granpa requested 'brown pudding' for thanksgiving absolutely loved it.  I made it and thought it was soggy and tasted like brown sugar water, but as for the man who grew up on this, he said it is EXACTLY what he remembered his mom making.  Thank you for giving me something i cam make especially for him.  I guess I just am not a fan, but for traditional 'brown pudding' this is THEE one!

VERY rich...a little goes a long way!  Very good but it doesn't seem to keep very well in the fridge (got runny)so probably best to make when your not looking for something that will be good for leftovers.

It was okay. A little too sweet for us and way too much water. I even cut it down to 3 cups like others suggested.

Ya this is kind of weird.  It is basically floating biscuits in a syrup sauce.  However, if that's how it is made traditionally, you can't complain.  Taste wise, it's pretty good.  Just different but I can see how they really liked this in the olden days.

I decided to take a couple of the cooked biscuits off the top and put them in a bowl.  Then I added the syrup on top and lightly mixed it to a pudding consistancy.  This made it much more like a bread pudding.  Then for fun I added rasins which was the right thing to do.  It was pretty good after that.

I thought this was horrible.  Although I can see how some people like it, it didn't suit my taste.  It was too un-refined.
