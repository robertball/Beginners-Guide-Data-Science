This is awesome....great meal to make in your crockpot in your RV while camping or during hunting season or anytime.   I think the cream corn does wonders for this...it is a winner in my book.  I use red potatoes because they hold up better and don't turn to mush.  This has become a family favorite.

I have made a similar recipe for years on stove-top.  I use only one can of cream style corn, omit whole kernel corn, and add one can of pork and beans.  I love the flavor of mine and also love the flavor of this new version.

I found the corn to be overwhelming.  Also, like another poster, I added a bit of garlic powder and some basil to the recipe, and, since our family likes a good bit of heat with our food, I also added about 2tsp red pepper flakes.  I submitted a couple of pictures of the result, and, as you can see, mine turned out more like a chili than a soup.  That's not a bad thing, of course, but I was expecting something a little thinner than I got.

IF I were to make this again, I think I would only use a single can of corn, probably the creamed corn, and then use vegetable broth to make up the rest of the liquid.

One last note:  it's ridiculously filling.  I took a great big bowl because I was Starving, but by the time I was half way done, I felt a little sick.  Just, you know, FYI.  :)

Excellent recipe. Thank you. I like that it has simple ingredients and seasoning....no canned soups or exotic anything. I might use fresh corn if I get some this summer but this is a winner as is. 

So refreshing to find this for my family and know everyone from young to old will enjoy it.

I haven't tried this, but is sounds yummy.  I have an issue with using canned corn though.  I would use fresh of the cob or frozen.  Canned corn has way too much sodium and it taste tinny.  I will make this, using fresh or frozen corn.  Thanks for the recipe.

My grandsons loved this soup even on a hot July day. My changes include:  reducing to three cans of corn (2 regular and one cream style), a half cup of vegetable broth, a tad of granulated garlic, and a tad of basil. I like to measure my potatoes and two cups of peeled and diced red potatoes were perfect. Lastly, I cooked it on the stove!  Thank you Meemps for sharing your recipe.

Great recipe ~ especially for the cooler autumn days! I cut back the amount of corn, and look for organic to avoid GMO products. I also like using white potatoes and leaving the skin on ~ good suggestion to add them last, since they cook very quickly when cubed.

Pretty good, plan on experimenting a bit next time. Needs more spices, was a bit heavy on the corn taste but overall very good.

I've made this a couple of different ways, I made it by adding a tablespoon of minced garlic, along with the recipe as well as using canned cubed potatoes. I also serve it with Kings sweet rolls on the side. My 9 year old LOVED it sooooo much I made it twice in one week, and she went and gave samples to the neighbors! It's a hit around my house, even with my husband who isn't a huge corn fan he even ate two bowls. I can make it in the crockpot when I have more time or even on the stove. LOVE IT

Don't know if I'm missing something here but this was a very tasteless soup.  I followed the recipe and after we tasted it I tried adding some basil and garlic like others suggested and it still just tasted very bland. It sounded so interesting and different from anything I've ever made before and all the reviews either gave it a 4 or or a 5 star rating so I thought I would give it a try.  Won't be making it again.  Sorry.

I used ground pork & beef, 1 can of creamed corn and beef stock in place of water.  Added garlic and some spicy tomato and ginger sauce to amp up the spice.  Delicious.

I would have to agree with most of the reviews here ; the corn can be too much but it is an excellent recipe and soup.  Made it 2x already.  What it might need is a punch of spice ; maybe a pinch or 3 of black pepper ; diced jalapeno? Also I did use beef stock instead of water.

Again I love this soup and the 1st time I made it it went in a day and made friends with my neighbors (haha).

Loved this! Anything I can throw together in the crock pot and is low maintenance that still turns out delicious, tasting like I slaved, is a winner in my book! Like others, I added some garlic powder to the meat when I browned it, and when adding water I used beef broth instead. Simple! I think next time I'll add mixed vegetables instead of the regular corn for a twist. But this was quick and delicious, served with some warm biscuits, my three big guys loved it and asked me to make it again. That makes it a winner with me.

Ehh, wasn't really impressed with this soup. It ended up being more like a stew, and didn't have much flavor. Also, I think 4 cans of corn is too much! Won't be trying this again.

I was very impressed with this recipe. I'm not a big fan of soup, but my husband enjoys it and we've been looking at different recipes to try. I made it exactly as written, and will be adding it to our dinner rotation. This would be great on a cold day with a side of crusty bread!

5 stars with the following accommodations. As written the recipe is very bland. Added: beef broth instead of water, 2 celery stalks, minced garlic, basil, crushed red pepper flakes. Delicious and hearty.

I doubled the ground beef and cut the corn in half.  I thought the recipe was going to be too simple to be good but it was actually pretty tasty.  It was a good Sunday night supper.  Everyone liked it and I will be making it again!  Thanks for sharing.  :)
