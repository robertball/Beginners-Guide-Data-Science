This fast, easy, and delicious. I did do somethings differently.  First I added about 
1 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter mix.  Secondly, I baked the batter for about ten minutes before adding the fruit (I used red delicious apples, turned out fine) Lastly, I sprinkled brown sugar on top, giving it a nice brown color after it baked.  My family just loved it!

You certainly don't need to know your way around the kitchen for this one... but don't be put off by the simplicity of the recipe, either; it's really good!
I used half light brown sugar in mine, added a few drops of vanilla to the batter, and prepared it with 2 cans of drained peaches (spread evenly over the top), which I also sprinkled with cinnamon. What a quick, easy and delicious week-night dessert. Thanks, Rosemarie.

If you really want to make this easy... simply open a can of Cherry Pie Filling and spoon over the batter. My Mother had this recipe when I was a kid and I have used it every since.  Always turns out great!

This cobbler is best with real juicy fruit... the breading top will suck the juice from a dry fruit like apples and make the cobble taste bland and "sticky"

This recipe was excellent, and ridiculously easy to prepare! I made mine with fresh-picked wild blackberries from my own yard, and even used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose.  Nice and crunchy on the top and edges and wonderful ooey-gooey in the middle.  Try this one! Even a ten-year-old could make this one!

Very good! I made it with apricots and used Splenda for 1/2 cup of the sugar and regular sugar for the remaining 1/4 cup.

I made this dessert with blueberries and raspberries, what a horrible idea!The batter was good that's why I gave 3 stars but the berries were so sour and bitter we couldn't even eat it and I added a bunch of sugar. I will try with peaches next time.

I LOVE this recipe!  Super easy and so delicious.  What could be simpler!  I substituted Spelt Flour, Rice Milk and Sugar in the Raw in the same measure and it worked out perfectly.  I also used a 2 packs of frozen organic berries (usually Strawberries and Blueberry) and it totally rocks!  Even my mom loves it!

I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white flour in this recipe. It came out pretty good, and was very easy to make. It was a little too buttery though, so next time I will make it with a little less butter. Thanks for the recipe!

Here's how easy this is to throw together. Sister calls to see if she can borrow camping gear. No problem. C'mon by. Hang up phone. Heat oven. Stir batter. Slice fruit. Assemble and pop into oven. One hour later I'm dishing it up over ice cream with my sister. She's happy. I'm happy. You can be happy, too.

This is more cake-like than cobbler - just a "heads up" for those considering diving in with this.  If you're looking for something more fruity you might want to consider another recipe.  This couldn't be easier to make - you'll have it in the oven in just minutes.  The batter is buttery and just sweet enough - as I always do with similar batters, I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I made this with all strawberries - it was good, but I think I'd prefer this with either a blend of berries, or with a firmer fruit - the mushiness of the strawberries was just a little disagreeable.  Good and versatile old-fashioned dessert.

Very good basic cobbler recipe!  I had been looking for a long time for a recipe that was close in texture to my grandma's. Most I have found have a pie like, or biscuit like topping.

I only gave 4 stars because the first time I made it it cam out a smidge bland. The batter was a little too sweet and didn't taste like much. I also thought the fruit part was a little boring.

The second time I added 1/4tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp almond extract to the batter. I also prepared my fruit the way I would for a pie. (Tossed it in a bit of sugar and cornstarch.

These slight additions resulted in the perfect cherry cobbler that took be back to my Grandma's kitchen.

Crowd pleaser! In the winter I use frozen berries and in the summer whatever fruit I have handy.  Hardly ever two full cups of just peaches. Too many other fruits to indulge in. Yum!

This was very good. Was looking for an easy cobbler where I didn't have to cook the peaches ahead of time before baking it. This was it. It was interesting in how it turned out at the end. I layered all the peaches on top, but when it baked, they sank to the bottom and the crust ended up all golden brown, and delicious on top, just as if I had put it on top at the beginning. Very tasty.

This is wonderful.  I was given a big bag a apples that needed to be cooked up immediately.  I whipped 3 cobblers out in no time.  The apples I ad were red delicious and not very tart so I added a little lemon juice to the slices and a tad bit of cinnamon and cloves..  yummy these turned out so good!!!

I used fresh peaches, and mine didn't come out as well as I hoped.  It tasted good, but the center was too soft.  If I make it again, I would stir the fruit into the batter instead of into the middle.

Definitely not like traditional cobbler, especially from down South.  The batter turns out spongy and a tad mushy.  It's also very sweet!  Putting the batter atop the butter may have been a bad idea because the batter and butter mix.  Maybe cooking the batter for 20 minutes and then, putting the topping on would be better.  I was looking for a hard crust on top that would be moistened by the fruit on the bottom.  Not so.  I used real cherries and made a the mix from the Cherry Pie III recipe on this site and it was great!!

I made this tonight with frozen (pre-thawed) peaches.  It was very good and gets points for EASY!!!  The only hard part is the hour baking time wait :)  Served with vanilla ice-cream.

Wow, this was so good and so easy.  I'll be using this recipe a lot this summer with fresh fruits.  Tonight I made it with frozen triple berry mix from Sam's club (just plopped in the frozen berries) and cooked as directed.  During the last 10 minutes I sprinkled some sugar on top and it made a little crunchy crust.  Just delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe with apples. I added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and also spinkled cinnmon on top.  Considering how easy it is to make and the awesome flavor, I had to give this recipe 5 stars!

Wonderful and very very easy! I tried both blueberries and peaches. Both were delicious! I added cinnamon and nutmeg to both.

I love the ease of making this cobbler. It goes together quickly. I used a mix of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and cherries. I doubled the batch and put it in a 9"x13" pan.

This was okay, very easy to make which is a plus, I think its a good basic recipe, but it could use some improvements. I think ill add vanilla next time. A little bit of a flakiness would be nice as well. I always remember cobblers being flaky. Maybe just me will probably make it again with some changes.

Very easy and good. It wasn't what I was expecting, but still delicious. Mine turned out more like a "bread pudding" rather than a cobbler. I used white peaches and served with ice cream. Will make again for sure!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I like it more as a breakfast side rather than a dessert.  I used 1/2 cup of sugar, cinnamon and vanilla to the mix.  I also added 1/4 of sugar and some cinnamon to my fresh strawberries and blueberries.  I like the dough because it does not take away from the fruit.  I will make this again this week.

I baked this recipe yesterday and my husband gave two thumbs up!  The crust was so easy to make and came out delicious and moist - I added 1 tsp vanilla extract.  Also, I used frozen sliced peaches - thawed them in the microwave then mixed w/ 3 tbsp 100% natural peach spread.  Laid them beautifully on top of crust and sprinkled w/ little bit of cinnamon.  Wonderful dessert, thanks!

I used a can of tart cherries in water (drained the water), and I only used 1/2 C sugar. It was still really good. This recipe is easy to adjust to your personal tastes, and it's super easy and fast to make! I put it together in just a couple minutes while my chicken finished oven roasting and then popped it in the oven once the chicken was done. By the time dinner was over and cleaned up, dessert was ready. Loved it!

Good and easy recipe. I followed recipe as is for the batter, but used plum, peach, pear, black berries and blue berries. The total amount of fruit was over 2 cups. I sprinkled cinnamon powder on top (I love cinnamon) and it turned out great. 

I like this recipe because the ingredients are always readily available in my kitchen and it takes very little time to prepare before you put it in the oven. 

It is very tasty, but I personally prefer something less sweet for the batter. I prefer much less sweetness than most people so I don't think that would be an issue for many. I think it works really well with some sweet and tart fruit. If the fruits are just sweet (like pear), I would add some lemon juice to give more dimension. If this recipe didn't turn out well, I think it is either because the fruits didn't taste well or maybe you just don't like cobbler.

Very disappointed. The batter was inconsistent in texture: sometimes good, sometimes gummy and gelatinous and I couldn't finish it. Even when it was the right texture, I was not impressed by the taste. I completely followed the recipe and this is the first recipe on allrecipes.com that has bombed for me. I used blueberries only (frozen) and I did use gluten-free flour so that may have been a partial cause in the recipe not working for me.  I won't try it again though.

This is possibly the best desert I've ever had.  I made it exactly as the recipe says, using bing cherries as the fruit.  I can't wait to share this recipe with my friends (although I'm not sure I'd be willing to share any of the cobbler)!

I used to make this all the time, years ago, ( I won't tell you how many).  I hadn't made if for very long time and forgot some of the instructions and the 'how much'.  I even made it today from memory and see I forgot a couple things....so by chance I got the idea to come and look here in allrecipes and low and behold, here it is.  I'll have to hurry and go change the recipe I gave to a friend last week to use up some of her peaches from her tree so her recipe will turn out right.  Hope she hasn't tried it yet......

Great recipe but way too much sugar for my family.  We used 1/4 cup sugar, soy milk, and only 2 tablespoons butter.  Was still sweet enough and great tasting.

Very good!  I used a 12oz. pkg of frozen blueberries.  Increased the  baking time by 5-10 minutes.  Increased the oven temp to 350 for the first 30 minutes.  Used my 8x8 inch Pyrex dish.  Also, I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over everything before baking.

Good but I had to add some spices/vanilla/almond so that it wouldn't be so bland.  It does remind me of bread pudding---it was great with my changes and I used fresh peaches...oh yum!

very good.  everyone loved it.  I used frozen berries (raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and strawberries), so mine needed longer in the oven than if I had used fresh fruit.  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and cooked it according to the directions for 60 min, then turning the oven down to 300 degrees for a few more minutes to prevent over-browning of the edges while the center finished setting.  I also replaced 50% of the sugar with splenda.  The family splenda-hater didn't notice.  Thanks for posting, I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Don't forget the size of the dish! I accidentally used a dish that was about half the volume, and the cobbler came out thick and chewy. The taste was still good considering the easiness of this recipe.

My family LOVES this!! My husband doesn't like cobblers at all, but this is one of his favorite desserts. I do add 1 tsp of vanilla when I blend the ingredients together. I've only made this with peaches because we love it so much this way that we've never got around to trying it with any other fruit. I'm sure it would still be killer no matter what you put in it. I always double this recipe and put it in a 13x9 inch baking dish. The 9x9 just isn't enough for my family of 5. Very easy and very good!

OMG this is fantastic! Its also super easy.  I have made it with peaches and then again with blueberries.  I would say I preferred the blueberry cobbler, but that's just a fruit preference.  I did add the vanilla and the sprinkling of brown sugar over top.  Also, I mixed the butter that is melted in the baking dish with the batter just a little bit.  This seemed to be better than the time that I did not do so.

This cobbler is very easy to make and tastes great, but it seems to get soggy by the second day. I have made it twice, first with apples, then with peaches.

Very good! I made this for dessert last night and followed the recipe exactly except that I used a combo of strawberries and blueberries (about a cup of each). I served it slightly warm with a warm vanilla custard sauce. My guests enjoyed it.

I made this to a T and it was just okay. I bready and not really all that sweet.  If I make this again, I'll definitely do a brown sugar topping.

It was pretty good. I'll make it again, just with a few changes next time. I'll sprinkle some sugar on top next time and add some vanilla to the batter.

This is so tasty, my mom has been making this for over 20 years and it is awesome to see that now others are enjoying it. You ca also use canned fruit w/syrup, just cut sugar in half.

Just scrumptious and almost too easy.  I made this with 2 cups of fresh pitted cherries (the pitting being the most laborious part of the whole process), raw (turbinado) sugar, half smart balance spread and half butter.  The raw sugar gave it a nice molasses-flavored chewy "crust" and the bit of butter lurking at the bottom was just fabulous.  Can't wait to make it again, with apricots!

I forgot to add some extra milk so it was borderline dry, but it was so so good.  Made it with peaches and blueberries for a big crowd and they all loved it.

I LOVE this recipe!!  It definitely isn't your old-fashioned cobbler, but it's delicious.  It's moist, tasty, bready and wonderful.  I have used this for a fruit cocktail cake, as well.  My family will eat it 3 meals a day, if I let them.

Used 21 oz. can cherry filling, I must say this was very yummy!  Thank goodness, crust did not turn out "bisquit-y" like it does when you use Bisquick.  I will make this one again!  Extra good with vanilla ice cream

Very good and easy.  Used 2 large peaches and one cup of frozen raspberries.  Used half light brown sugar and half white sugar.  Baked in a 9" glass pie dish and served in wedges.

Made this with fresh cherries and it turned out very good. I love the fact you can use lower cals ingredients (splenda, reduced fat butter and skimmed milk) and still get a delicious dessert.

I made this with really lousy peaches (They were the only ones available so I added 1/4 cup of sugar to them after slicing them and let them "steep" for a while.)  But the cobbler was still very good despite the substandard peaches.  Even my super-picky other-half enjoyed it about it and went for more the next day -- which NEVER happens.  Tonight I'm trying it with a canned cherry pie filling and I'm going to experiment with a butter, flour, and sugar crumb topping.

I made this for my family and everyone loved it. I used fresh hand picked black raspberries.  Once I put the raspberries into the batter I sprinkled a tiny bit of white sugar over the top of the berries.  I have already made this twice this weekend.  Love it!!!!

I found that although this recipe was good, it need more sweetness to it. Especially if using fresh or frozen fruits. I used 2 cans sliced peaches( will use more next time) and sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on top. Also added vanilla to the batter. Instead of 3/4 cup milk I sybarites 1/4 of it for can peach juice!

Easy and Good! This is a plain downhome dessert and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream it is yummy! I made this with a 21 oz. can of cherry pie filling and accidentally only put in 1 tsp of baking powder, but it seemed to turn out fine. 
(I also put a little vanilla in the batter and sprinkled the top with some sanding sugar about 10 minutes before taking it out of the oven just for fun and a little sugary crunch).

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I used berries fresh from my garden that I had frozen which worked well, but the amount of sugar was not nearly enough for them.  Also, I would recommend using unsalted butter or margarine in this recipe because my cobbler tastes salty and there was no salt in this recipe.  For my own personal taste I added cinnamon which worked well for us.  In the end I finally put about another 1/4 - 1/2 c. sugar sprinkled on top and this really helped.  I will try again but with some changes.

I thought this was good.  I substitued splenda for the sugar.  I also added vanilla and cinnamon as others recommended.  I added 1/4 c of splenda to the peaches themselves.  Very tasty and will make again.

This recipie is delicious and so easy.  I actually made it 3 times in 1 week, twice with apples and once with fresh peaches.  As suggested I added 1 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter.  I also sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on top of the fruit.  Pair it with vanilla ice cream and you have the perfect dessert.

I made this cobbler with whole wheat flour, half brown sugar, half regular sugar; I also tossed all sorts of berries and peaches in a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar (for taste), before adding them to the batter. I used less butter as well (only half of the specified amount). The taste was amazing! Very fruity and savory. The batter was a bit mushy (it could be from the juices that the fruit left behind that mixed with the batter; it could be from the whole wheat; I'm not sure). I do know that I'll make this again. Lovely dessert; goes well with vanilla ice-cream and a bit of cream. Yum!

I added a teaspoon of vanilla like others suggested and sprinkled on a streusel topping for the last 15 minutes. This was excellent!

This was OK, but mine must not have turned out as good as it did for others.  I didn't think it had too much taste, and it was the consistency of a cake, not a cobbler.  If I make it again, I will try another fruit.  I did like the ease of this recipe, though.

Easiest and best dessert ever. So...quick and easy. I substituted buttermilk for milk, it was phenomenal. I used fresh peaches and stirred them with a touck of allspice before placing on top of the batter. Was a nice spicy touch. Will use apples next. YUMMY!!!!

Awesome recipe! Nice and simple. I would have given 5 stars but added little too much. I did as others suggested and sprinkled about 2T of brown sugar and 1t of cinnamon on top of the fruit. Also added 1t cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. Have made it with all kinds of fruit now and blueberries/plum mixture is our favorite!

I followed the recipe as per instructed, the presentation was great and the dough was flavorful.  If you really want a sweet dessert, you want to use canned peaches instead for extra flavor and juiciness.

This was the first time I have ever made or even tried a fruit cobbler, and I wasnt sure what to expect.  All in all I thaught It was alright, not too keen on the saugy cake-like mixture under the fruit.  I wouldnt recommend this one...it was a waste of good fruit!

So simple and very tasty. Mine turned out just perfect.  I wonder if the person who had a problem with the sides browning before the middle was done did not have an even layer of fresh peaches.  I used thinly sliced fresh peaches and made sure they were evenly distributed on the top.... not all in the middle.  Also I used a round baking dish, so mine looked just like the photograph!  I'll certainly be making this again.

Not a big hit.  I used fresh peaches and added a dash of almond extract as well as a little more than 1/2 brown sugar and buttermilk instead of milk.  It started burning around the edges at 30 minutes when I took it out and sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar.  The center was still raw and so it had to bake another 20 minutes and then the top was really burned.  Somewhat bland in taste even with the addition of almond extract and cinnamon sugar.

This was delicious!  Sometimes I think we trick ourselves into thinking that an easy recipe isn't going to be any good.  What an easy, yummy surprise!  I used fresh peaches, added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter and cooked for 40 minutes.  Then I sprinkled some brown sugar on top and cooked the additional 20 minutes.  Outstanding!  What could be a better summertime treat with a little vanilla ice cream!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy and delicious.  I made it withsome fresh peaches that were getting too unattractive to eat whole.  I tossed them in a little brown sugar first, added about 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the batter and baked it for 10 minutes before adding the fruit.

My family makes this cobbler with whatever fresh fruit we have in the garden at the time, and serve it with evaporated milk. It's our go-to dessert, all year long, using canned fruit!

I loved it! Super easy to make. Although my boyfriend thought it was too dry without ice cream, I think I enjoyed it because I dont care for traditional cobbler.

Easy. Quick. Tasty. I made this with fresh blueberries (1 pint). One bowl, one pan, no mess.  The batter mixes up in a minute then just pop in the oven.  Nothing could be easier!  I served it warm and it was very good. This is a great family dessert, not quite fancy enough for company.  Heads up: baking times vary. Mine was done after 40 minutes, not the recommended 1 hour. I followed the recipe exactly.

This is an excellent excellent easy and tasty recipe.  Have made this more than once following the recipe exactly.  Have also made it with canned peaches as well as frozen.  Only thing I would change but haven't  for my own taste is cut back on the sugar to a half a cup.

OH.MY.GOD! This was soooo good and so easy! I made this last night for our day-before mothers-day lobster feed and everyone raved about it!! I used spelt flour, raw sugar and soy milk and it turned out fantastic! I had planned on making it with peaches but I hadnt bought enough so I tossed in some strawberries and blueberries, served it with vanilla ice cream and WOW! I will make this again and again and again.....thanks!

YUM!  I did as other reviewers suggested and halved the sugar between brown and white, and I also added some Mexican vanilla to the batter mix.  I used diced fresh apple and some frozen mixed berries with about 1/8 c. brown sugar and some vanilla to add sweetness and flavor.  The cobbler turned out to be very tasty!  :)  Thanks for posting the recipe!!!

Made this with blueberries for my hubby.  I had never made cobbler before, but I'm sure I will be making it again.  Hubby said it was one of the best cobblers he had ever had.  The best part is that it was an easy, simple recipe.  I will definitely make this one again, and will make it with different fruits!!

Easy. Delicious. Very pretty too. Used 1/4c light brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar. Added 1t vanilla extract. Of course, make sure your fruit is ripe, sweet and delicious. That's the key.

Very easy and good. Made with mostly blueberries and a couple of strawberries. Would recommend adding extra sweetener if using berries that aren't especially sweet. I ended up sprinkling sugar on top after I tasted it. Next time I will mix the berries in sugar before adding to the batter.

Excellent!! I will use again.  I used fresh peaches, nectarines and some strawberries.  I could not stop eating it!!  The crust/dough has a nice buttery flavor.  Just be sure to cook it enough.

Great simple recipe. Only took about 5 minutes to prep. Next time I make it I will spread the fruit out more, piling it in the middle means the edge pieces don't get a lot of fruit and the center pieces are nothing but fruit. Also, I think brown sugar would make it just a little more delicious!

The recipes calls for not stirring the fruit together with the batter.  I ended up with a pile of blueberries in the middle and cake like crust around the edges.  I will use another recipe next time.

This was certainly a very easy to make and tasty cobbler. I modified and used 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, only 1/2 cup sugar, and used 1 tblsp. lesss than 1/4 cup of butter. I used about 1 1/2 cup peaches and 1 cup blueberries. Then I sprinkled about a cup of Kashi Go Lean Crunch cereal on top (before baking) for a fiber boost. My kids scraped the plate clean, but my husband said although it was good it tasted healthy and wasn't as good as a regular made cobbler. It's good the next morning for breakfast leftover.

Next time I make this I will spread the fruit out over the batter.  I was expecting the fruit (I used peaches) to spread as the cobbler baked, but that did not happen; otherwise this is a good cobbler recipe.

This is simple and delicious! I have made it with blueberries, peaches, raspberries and strawberries. I added a little cinnamon with the peaches. Turned out great.

I made this and called it cake, and the fruit (nectarines and peaches) my children said they hated was gone in a blink.  I added the vanilla like other reviewers suggested, and I think I will experiment with spices as I try different fruits.  Thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit! I made very few changes, other than to up the recipe to serve 8 and use two 21 oz cans of cherry pie filling. I put 1/3 cup of margarine in the bottom of an 10x10 casserole dish, then poured the batter over that, then added the cherries. I spread them evenly across the top of the batter but only to about 1 inch from the edge of the dish. I was surprised that in little over 30 minutes the cherries were completely covered with the batter. After 45 minutes I took it out and sprinkled granola over the top. I took it out after one hour and it was perfect. Juicy and delicious and the breading was perfect! I Served with vanilla ice cream, it's definitely a family favorite.

I needed a quick dessert for an informal dinner with friends, and this was a real hit with the adults and kids!  I doubled the recipe and followed the advice of other reviewers by using half white sugar and half light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla in the batter, and I sprinkled the top with a little cinnamon and sparkling sugar. To save some calories I used skim milk, and because I doubled the recipes, I spread the fruit around the batter instead of dumping it in the middle. Instead of peaches, I used two jars of drained Morello cherries in light syrup that I always keep in the pantry from Trader Joe's. We served the cobbler warm with vanilla ice cream. The cobbler is better served warm. When it cools it gets a little dense, but I suspect there won't be much left over if you make this recipe!

really good!  I used fresh strawberries and blueberries and added a little of the sugar directly to the fruit so that it wouldn't be too tart.I spread the fruit all over (instead of putting it all in the middle). I was worried the butter would sit on top, but it all mixed together while bakingand turned out great!!

This recipie is easy to make and delicious.  The few scattered complainers probably just don't know how to cook.  If you happen to know your way around the kitchen, this is a good one.

Boring! This recipe is dull.  I made this exactly as shown here and it was by far the most bland apple dish I've ever made. A waste of fruit, a waste of time. I'm just glad the recipe wasn't any larger or I would have wasted more ingredients on it. Please don't make this.

I tried this first with cherries from my own tree. Didn't turn out too tasty. Tried it again with fresh peaches. It was amazing! We even had it for breakfast this morning! Not too sweet, but you really taste the fruit! I'm trying it again tonight with fresh blueberries. Jan 2015-This is my go to dessert for those evenings when I want something warm and comforting, but don't want to fuss in the kitchen. I've used blueberries, peaches, and apples with great success! Strawberry, raspberry and fresh cherries were failures, but I'd try cherry pie filling in a pinch. I made this for my grandmother recently, and she called the next day to ask for the recipe. If your 91 year old Granny liked it that much, you know it's good!

Super easy & very tasty!  I hate to rate recipes when I make changes, but this basic recipe is good "as is" so I did .  For my own, I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 cup of blueberries to the peaches, along with a sprinkling of pecan pieces on top.   Delicious!

This was not at all what I was expecting. I used strawberries and peaches, and added cinnamon to the batter for flavour. The result was edible, but I'm not a fan of the texture. The cake part came out chewy and I don't understand why. Flavour is nice, but I can't get past having to chew it apart. Won't be making again.

We made this with blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries.  Yum!  It was easy, and delicious.  Definitely put the batter on the bottom, like the recipe says.  When it bakes, the batter with rise up and around the fruit and the sugar in the batter will get crusty and crunchy.  It's seriously so good.  :)

One thing that will help sweeten the cobbler if making with variety of berries is to macerate the fruit first--put in bowl--sprinkle about 2 Tablsp. sugar over top of berries--then because I'm more tactile than daughter--I reach in with CLEAN hands and kind of mash or squish a few (not all) of the berries up--she presses a glass down to crush a few berries and get the juices flowing--let that sit while oven preheating and toss together the rest of recipe.  Made it twice and first time I left rack in middle of oven and turned out a tad gooey in center--second time I place oven rack up a notch and turned out evenly baked throughout--good recipe for if you're in a hurry.

This is a quick and easy recipe, which is always a good thing.  I used frozen mixed fruit because that is what I had in the freezer and it turned out great.  But this would work with any fresh or frozen fruit.  I don’t make cobblers very often, so I think this has just become my go-to recipe for it.  Thanks for sharing!

I absolutely love this recipe. I make it with gluten free flour (King Arthur brand) and fresh granny smith apples about once a week. My husband likes to have extra apples on top, so I make it with apple chunks but I bake about two cups of apples separately then pile them on the individual servings after the cobbler is done. I do add quite a bit of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla, but I put those in just about every baked good, so that's not a strike against the recipe. It takes all of ten minutes to mix the ingredients, melt the butter, and layer it into the dish. By the way, this doesn't require any xanthan gum if using the KA flour.

Quick and easy recipe. I've only made blueberry cobbler prior to trying this recipe, so it was a bit dry compared to what I'm familiar with. I think next time I would mix the apples with some juicy peaches or blueberries and it would make a big difference.

I made this recipe today using Granny Smith apples which I had mixed with a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar since they are so tart.  I was very disappointed.  The finished product (and I took it out 10 minutes early) was dry.  I did take a 1/2 c water and 1/4 c sugar boiled it until clear and then poured over the top and returned to oven for about 5 minutes.  It was okay then.  I was surprised since I had a tried a similar recipe for individual cobblers previously and they came out too juicy and ran all over the cupcake tins.  Sheesh

I made this last night as a double batch apple cobbler - with a couple of changes other than a straight-up double.  

1.  used brown sugar instead of white.
2.  added 2tsp of cinnamon
3.  added 1tsp of nutmeg

It is AMAZING.  :)  Give it a try.

Incredibly easy to make and customize.  I added a bit of vanilla to the dough and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on the top to make a bit of a crust.  It's dense and rich and delicious!  Change up the fruit and you've got something for any season.  I used a mix of frozen berries and fresh peaches, and it was great.

I've made this several times now with a variety of fruits, both fresh and tinned.  It is always delicious and always receives compliments.  We love it with cream -- but honestly, I love it as is.  I do as others suggested and put about a tsp of vanilla in the batter and about 1/2 tsp or so of cinnamon as well.  You cannot go wrong with this dessert.  So easy and it really looks lovely.  Thank you for sharing this.

Made this recipe tonight for the family and they loved it.  I did cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1 tsp of vanilla and instead of using peaches I used a can of cherry pie filling.  I will be making this again.

this was definitely easy and tastes OK but mine didn't separate like i had hoped.  its more like a REALLY mushy blueberry coffee cake.  maybe you need a firmer fruit...  i used 3 cups fresh blueberries with a couple teaspoons each flour and sugar.  just OK with blueberries, will likely try again with something else.

Wanted a nice cake topping that is easy to assemble, and this works well. Added a dash of vanilla to the batter and used leftover sliced fruit from fruit tray rather than peaches. Turned out delicious. Will definitely try it again.

What a great recipe. I add vanilla extract as well, and then 1 tbsp or two of flax seed meal and a product called Complete Greens. It's a powdered greens mixture that goes down very easy. I put it in  everything, including pancakes and brownies.

Delicious!  I halved the recipe, used currants, and sprinkled some sugar on top of the berries after putting them on top of the dough.  Since I had halved the recipe, I cooked it just 45 minutes.  It turned out great!  Easy to make, too.

This was very good and I had everything on hand to make it. I was looking for a blueberry cobbler, so I made this one with blueberries instead of peaches. I used whole wheat flour, because I almost always substitute whole wheat for white. And I added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the batter. I baked in an iron skillet and it was yummy!

I give this a three but it has potential to be a five.  It is a great start just a little bland.   My company that I served this to and I feel that the cake mixture needed some vanilla or almond extract, a pinch of salt and maybe even some cinnamon.  I added raspberries to the peaches but they also needed to be tossed with sugar.  It would be delicious served with vanilla ice cream!!  I will use this recipe again, just tweaked a bit.

I made this recipe last night and it was quick but  not a unique recipe. It should have had some vanilla or something to give it more flavor. The crust was too thick and mushy.

This is a good cakey fruit cobbler.  Makes a moist, light cake topping, not a crumble.  I used peaches and it was tasty, will try again with other fruit.

this was really easy and quick turned out quite good since I used apples that I had in cold storage.
The only thing I added was some coco covered almonds that I coarsly smashed and added to the crumb topping.

Very easy and quick.  Taste just didn't impress me that much, even though I added some vanilla to the batter to give it some flavor.  A little cakey and bland, with a bit of a soggy bottom (used thawed, frozen peaches).  Might be better with brown sugar.  Nothing bad to say, but not "wow" either.  Might make again if I needed something to slap together.

Delicious! Used a can of canned fruit (juice drained), a pear and an apple. Sprinkled with sobe brown sugar 10 minutes before it was done. Turned out great and will definitely make it again!

This cobbler is pretty easy and tasty.  I made it with fresh peaches last time.  This time I'll try fresh blackberries and canned peaches.  I also made mine using whole wheat flour and margarine instead of butter.

I agree with some other reviewers, too cake like for me. I was looking for more of a true cobbler recipe. But to be fair, I substituted apples for the peaches so that may have made the difference.

Okay, with a scoop of vanilla icecream on this warm cobbler and this is dangerous!  Soooo yummy and way too easy!!  Changes:  I used 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the 3/4 white sugar.  I used my home canned peaches.  Sprinkled top with a cinnamon/sugar mixtixe.

I made this with fresh peaches and also with canned. The fresh peaches got a little dried out, but it was really good both times. The addition of ice cream pushes it to 5 stars :)

It is fantastic! I made 2 batches of it last night, (used Macintosh Apples) and my husband and boys chowed down. I served it with Vanilla Bean ice cream right after dinner. One batch is gone, lol. It's a definite keeper!! I did add a touch of vanilla to both batches, and I think it brought out a lot of flavor. Can't wait to make again...

Wow! This was a spectacular success! I prepared this last night and there wasn't a scrap left in the dish :o)) I used brown sugar instead of white and the cobbler went into the bottom of the oven at a higher temperature (190 C) because I had something else to cook at the same time that took twenty minutes of the total time. After I took the other item out, I turned the oven down to 165 and moved the cobbler to the middle shelf. The end result was a delicious crispy around the edges, caramally peach cobler which I served with vanilla bean icecream. Thanks so much for this excellent sweet treat.

I give this a big BOOYEAH! So easy, so delicious. I made this with fresh picked wild blackberries and (sadly) store bought blueberries and it turned out perfectly! I had to adjust the sugar a bit to accommodate the (sadly) tart blueberries, but that's why we taste our berries first. A winner forever in my book!

I'm not sure what I did wrong. I followed another reviewer's advice and baked the batter for 10 minutes before adding the fruit. I also added almond extract to the batter. It smelled amazing but the peaches shrivelled up and the batter was chewy and pretty much inedible. Probably won't make again.

I gave this 4 stars bc I love how easy this was to make. I would give the flavor only 2.5 as is, but this is a recipe that can be modified easily. I had some golden delicious apples on hand that needed to be used before they got too ripe, so I cut them into small chunks. The cobbler was nowhere near sweet enough for me and I even sprinkled brown sugar on top before popping it in the oven. It may have been bc of the apples I used. Next time, I will add a vanilla flavoring as suggested by others and maybe some brown sugar in the batter too.

So, so easy and so good!  I have made this twice in the last three days. Last night I doubled this as I had 4 large overripe peaches that needed to get used.  I also added some vanilla oil and was so glad I did. My husband and I both keep sneaking pieces of it and it will be gone soon.  Only wish I had had some vanilla ice cream to scoop when it came out of the oven last night.  Will make again and again.

A little bland. Not really a traditional cobbler more of a fruit cake thing. Looks good in the picture.

It's pretty good. Very simple to make, with ingredients on hand in the kitchen. I just wanted to use up some frozen berries that I've had for ages! (mix of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries.) I did add a tsp of vanilla to the batter, as well as sprinkle some brown sugar on top before it finished baking, as other reviewers suggested. oh also, make sure you keep an eye on it because mine was done in 50 minutes (baked in a 9" deep dish pie pan.) spread the fruit all over the batter, and the cake will rise up and envelop it. It's good but I guess I am just more of a pie person! It's fun to try new things though (never had or made a cobbler before) and this recipe looks like it has pleased a lot of people.

This is SO good! I used the advise from some other reviewers- I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/4 brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I used blackberries, blueberries and raspberries. It did taste a little tart (not as sweet as I thought), but it tastes amazing with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a little whip cream!

So quick and easy! Followed some other reviewers suggestions and added in 1 tsp vanilla and used half white sugar and half light brown. Didn't have quite enough peaches, so used half peaches, half raspberries (had them on hand). Delicious-- and so simple! Definitely will try again with other fruit variations!

This was great, but I changed things. I accidentally didn't add enough cobbler for the amount of fruit I had and didn't realize this 'til I put the fruit on top. So, I made a second batch of the cobbler and realized the first batch didn't have baking powder. I thought this would never work out, but it turned out great. You can't mess it up! I used raspberries an peaches.

I added about 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter and used a combination of apples, peaches and a few blueberries.  I received compliments on the dessert and would consider making it again.

This is a great recipe! I had a variety of berries that were to the point of "use them or loose them" so I used them all (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and cherries). I had at least 3 cups and it worked out fine. This is not an overly sweet dessert.  Followed the recipe only adding a sprinkle of raw sugar to the top at 30 min. and then returned to the oven for another 20 min. Great ending to our meal tonight. This is also extremely easy to throw together. Could be served on a weeknight or special occassion. We will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was soooo easy to make and YUMMY! My kids devoured it!  Some say the crust had a funny texture, but we didn't think so. I wonder if they used a 9x13 pan instead of a 9x9.   I'd like to cut the amount of butter, but I'm not sure how to do that as the cobbler really stuck in places as is. I didn't have fresh peaches, so I drained 2 cans and used those. Delicious! I'll definitely be making this again.

5 stars for simplicity and taste! There can't be an easier dessert than this. I used a canned fruit mix (peaches, pineapples, grapes) that I needed to get rid of. I also substituted 1/2 wheat flour, and 1/2 splenda to lower calories. Plus I added a bit of vanilla extract to the batter. It couldn't have been any tastier. Next time I'll cut the butter down so it's not as greasy.

Good recipe My DH is allergic to many fresh fruits so I use cooked fruits for him. Made this with Apples and craisins. Reduced the sugar as I always do and used apple sauce and Canola oil as suggested on this site for many baked goods. Akso good with Apples, Pears and Raisins with a little cinnamon.

This recipe is almost too easy! I made it with a couple of very ripe golden apples and added lots of cinnamon and a generous helping of vanilla to the batter. Oh and I added more baking powder than the original recipe calls for. I then sprinkeled some sugar and cinnamon on top of the apples and baked it for around 50 mins. My husband and my parents in law simply loved it.  Note: I only used 1 big tablespoon of butter and it turned out great and not too buttery tasting.

This was easy enough to make, but something about its texture was weird. It was kind of rubbery. I'm pretty sure I won't use this recipe again.

This was great. I used 2 fresh apples and a can of apple pie filing sprinkled with with cinnamon and brown sugar. I think the amount of butter was a lot. Next time I will cut the amount of butter. Thanks for sharing!!

I have this recipe from another source and have used it as-is for a long time. Try mixing the fruits -- some peaches and berries, or using strawberries to dot the corners to make a pretty dessert. This is a good learn-to-cook recipe for kids.

This was definitely easy to make. I had a bunch of fresh berries from the farmer's market so I decided to make this berry "cake" with blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. I added some cinnamon and vanilla extract for flavor and some brown sugar on top for a little crunchiness.

What a great and easy recipe! I would have done it to a "T" but my gf and I had an abundance of fresh, sweet Bing cherries, not sours. So I cut the sugar in half, which worked really well. Also, I added a bit of salt, since I've never made desserts without salt, but there was a salty taste... of course not the fault of the recipe! Meanwhile, for those using cherries, I would recommend cutting the pitted cherries in half or quarters -- the dish is very shallow and the whole cherries take up the whole height of the thing...

This recipe is simple, quick and versatile and good.  I've tried different fruits and added spices from vanilla and cinnamon to almond and ginger.  Kinda reminds me of a really moist, fruity bread.

very simple and quick. I used fresh pitted cherries. The fruit spread out nicely on the bottom. I agree with others-- it was very cake-y more than a true cobbler. Delicious though!

Due to time constraints I just made this exactly to recipe, except I used frozen mixed berries and cherries. It turned out quite good and I will make it again, but will sprinkle sugar on top like it's been suggested. Nice one!

I was surprised by how such an easy recipe could turn out so delicious! I did tweak it a bit I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and I only baked it for 45 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

This cobbler was so good!!  I used cherry pie filling and also added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract to the batter.  After I put the filling on the batter I sprinkled a little brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  Delicious!!!

This is awesome, SO easy and SOOO good!!  I used a can of lite cherry pie filling instead of the peaches, and just added a little vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the batter for extra flavor.  GREAT idea for an easy, really tasty dessert.

OMG!OMG!OMG!  Awesome Cobbler and I inadvertently made something my mom made when I was a kid!  How cool was that!  We barely waited for it to cool and topped it with a devonshire custard (yeah from a can... but its phenominal).  Made same tweeks as previously suggested and voila... an 8x8 tray of heaven.  If it wasn't for the fact that it was 10pm when I pulled it out of the oven, it would have been gone that night!!

Nice recipe to use ingredients on hand.  I made it with a can of Oregon cherries, to which I added 1/8 tsp. almond extract.  I added the can with the juice, and the recipe still worked out fine.  You think the bread topping will never be on the top due to the large amount of juice and cherries, but it grows around the sides and makes a crust almost completely covering the top!  Next time I think I will add 2 cans of cherries, one drained and one undrained, since this was a little light on fruit.

I did not care for this at all.  The batter had an unpleasant taste.  Crumbled toppings may be more work but are much better, in my opinion.

Very good but not great.  I added a dash of salt, teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  The topping is cake like, but it's so easy to prepare, I will use it again.

I love this recipe and will definitely use it again!  I used 2 cups fresh, pitted cherries and made the following modifications: added 1 tsp. vanilla, added approx. 1/4 tsp. salt (eyeballed it), and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I used a 9-inch pie pan and mine only needed to bake for about 42 minutes.  My husband loves it, and when I tasted it, I knew right away it was a keeper!

This was pretty good and the easy part was the best part.  I did add some sugar and cinnamon to the fruit otherwise it would have been too bland and sour.  It was light and fluffy not like cobbler crust, but I will definitely make it again :)

So yummy!!  Used 2 pints of blueberries, followed everything else to a T.  Wish I had my camera because it was just so beautiful.  Served with Mixed Berry 5-minute ice cream from this site. The cobbler was thick and sweet, not runny at all. Wonderful.

Excellent and simple cobbler recipe with really great flavor.  I didn't make any changes except to add 1/2 tsp. each of salt and vanilla.  I used fresh cherries as the fruit.  Soooooo delicious with premium vanilla ice cream scooped on top.  YUM!

I made one last night with cherry pie filling but substituted half a packet of butter buds in place of all but 1 TB. of butter to cut down on fat...loved it!  Made it again for work with canned peaches and blueberries this morning and it disappeared quickly!  Thanks for this easy and fast recipe!

Everyone loved it!! I added some vanilla and nutmeg to the peaches. The crust was perfect and it wasn't too sweet.

I made this for Thanksgiving with cherry pie filling (rinsed off most of the gel sauce though). It got rave reviews! Today I'm making it with peaches for a potluck dinner. This is great!

I would not make it again.  It's too dry and not sweet enough.  I would suggest putting the peaches on the entire top & not in the middle.  They did not spread out and you have a "cake" around the sides.

Juts made this today, as it was so easy I did 2 at the same time.  I did strawberry and peach and they took me a total of 10 minutes to prepare both for baking.  Simply yummy for such a simple recipe!

I used the proportions from this recipe, though I mixed the ingredients in a bowl and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the can of peaches before pouring into a greased pan.  It was delicious! Thanks! Next time I'll try brown sugar.

The Only changes I would make is a bit less sugar. I tend to use fresh berries that sometimes can be tart. So I add a little sugar to the berries while they sit. Particularly Strawberries after cutting. BUT that is just me. I made up 4-5 bags of dry ingredients so that I could whip one up by just adding butter and milk. AND of course Almost any kind of fruit, together or separately. It does not matter if you put the berries in the batter OR pour the batter over the berries. Like the recipe says "Easy Fruit Cobbler"

I took the advice to add 1 tsp of vanilla to measuring cup before adding the milk. I used 2.5 cups of very tart blueberries so I sprinkled sugar on top before I put it in the oven.  I loved this. The sweetness of the cake part complimented the tartness of the berries.

I've been making this since my daughter was in middle school, and it's one of the first recipes she learned to make on her own. She's now 35 years old. This
 is quick and simple. If you have really sweet peaches, cut back on the sugar.

The only change I made was I doubled it and baked it in a 9×13 glass pan. It required longer baking time, so I just checked it every 5-7 minutes until my chop stick came out clean. I used 2 cans of peaches for the fruit. It turned out just like the fruit cobbler from my childhood, and the family enjoyed it, too.

I did as others suggested and added a tsp vanilla to the batter. I also exchanged 1/4 cup of sugar for brown sugar. I used a bag of frozen berry medley. Very good for a basic dessert. Served with ice cream. Will make again.

used fresh peaches, not quite ripe enough.  Undercooked the dough because oven runs low.  Still we loved it.
Will try again with corrections made.

I love the consistency of this cobbler. However, I can't seem to get the apples to work using this recipe. Granny is too sour and Delicious apples are too sweet and gives off more water. We plan to try again with Granny Smith but double the amount of sugar. I also used Marie Calendar crust on the bottom and on top as extra crust. If I can just get those apples right.....

Great recipe. I used plumcots, my new favorite fruit. These were ruby red and ripe.  I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to amp up the flavor. It is an easy and delicious recipe. I had a bigger group so I doubled the recipe. Served it at room temperature with French vanilla ice cream. Everyone raved about it.

My mother, Lila, used to make peach cobblers with a similar/same recipe. I used your delightful recipe with Sugar in the Raw, baked the pastry for 10 minutes before adding the peaches on top, liberally seasoned the peaches with cinnamon, drizzled 1 tablespoon of butter over the entire dish about 10 minutes before the end of the one hour baking time. I also used a glass casserole dish, as my mother used to use a beat-up deep cobbler tin pot. It was yummy-delicious-goodness-oh-my-gawwwwwd good, just like my mother's, every time. Thanks for sharing all the tips in the comments, fellow bakers and kitchen adventurers.

Delicious and simple-- I've been making this recipe with some slight variations since I was a child back in the Florida Panhandle!  I've always used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/4, and added an egg as well; otherwise, exactly the same.  It's a particular favorite with ripe nectarines-- the tartness of the fruit is wonderful with the sweet batter, especially if you accompany it with vanilla ice-cream.  One caution:  It tends to overcook easily, so keep a weather eye on it in the last 10 minutes or so and be prepared to take it out early if it looks cooked enough.

I made this for Memorial Day and served it with vanilla ice cream. It was delish and so very easy to make.  I used blueberries instead of peaches, added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon  and used Gluten Free all purpose flour instead of wheat flour. My family likes sweet things but we thought this was a bit too sweet so next time I will cut the sugar a little.  Definitely plan on making this again and experimenting with different fruits.

Five stars for sure!! This is a great recipe, very simple, but so satisfying. I will make it again and again, with different fruits. I made it with peach and served it with ice cream.

This is my easy go-to summer dessert.  I grate a little lemon zest into the batter and add a pinch of cinnamon for a little extra flavor.  It's great with peaches or berries or some combination thereof.

I used drained jarred sour cherries (added the leftover juice to un-sweet ice tea-yum).  Since I knew the sour cherries would add a good bit of sweetness I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and added vanilla.  I think a bit of almond extract would do well here as well. I used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk.  Good for dessert.  Good for breakfast.

yummy, but I changed it up a bit as well.  Used 1 c. buttermilk, 1/2 c white sugar, 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 1/4 c unbleached, 1/4 c rolled oats, 2 t baking powder, pinch of salt.  Mixed 2-3 T of soft butter right into the batter, added a little of the LIGHT syrup from the canned peaches to smooth it out. Sprayed non-stick spray in 8x8 pan. Sprinkled Cinnamon on the chopped canned peaches, poured batter on top.

This recipe took me less than 10 minutes to put together.  I used blueberries and a nectarine.  Topped the fruit with 1 tablespoon of sugar mixed with cinnamon and added sliced almonds on top of the sugar. I even cooked it in a toaster oven.  Excellent.

Five stars for ease and versatility. No, it's not a "perfect" cobbler. If that's what you're shooting for, then find another recipe and expect a whole lot more work. This thing is super quick, super simple, and super tasty. You can tweak it and dress it up in all sorts of ways, and it generally turns out great. It's the perfect desert to throw together on a whim, or when you want to add a desert to your menu without penciling in a whole additional hour to your cooking time. You can use all white sugar, brown sugar, mix it up with parts honey, molasses, Splenda, agave, WHATEVER! I usually toss in a splash of vanilla and some lemon zest. I also sometimes add hints of cloves, nutmeg and or cinnamon, depending on what fruit I've used. I've tried berries of all kinds, apples, peaches, pears, raisins, etc... Right now I've got one bubbling with apples and kiwi :) Seriously 5 stars, because the possibilities are endless. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, and VOILA! Seriously, one of the best quick and easy recipes to have in your tool belt!

I increase the milk to one cup and add 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 T of cinnamon and a 21 oz can of cherry pie filling.  Nice and chewy-the way a cobbler should be!

Well I am never 1 to follow a recipe I always have to put my stamp on it, anyway I made mine with peaches I peeled and cut and added white and brown sugar, cinnamon to taste. I pretty much followed the recipe but I added a dash of vanilla to the batter. My house smelled so good. Cooked for an hour. Couldn't wait till it cooled so I served myself a small piece and I am happy to inform you it was DELICIOUS.

I had to make two, my family loved it so much! I thought it was a tad too sweet, but they didn't.  Added some cinnamon and vanilla to the fruits.
I love that I can use any fruit, used some frozen fruit the kids poo poo for smoothies, but devoured in the cobbler.

Delicious! I defrosted frozen blueberries and rinsed them before covering them with sugar and poured the batter over it. I also added a tad bit of vanilla extract. I sprinkled a little brown sugar, cinnamon and sugar on top before baking. Light and fluffy! No need for ice cream.

i really enjoyed this recipe, its really good with old peaches which make it extra sweet! add a little more butter to put on the cobbler and will make a beautiful golden look! add some vanilla extract to get that inner taste :1 I put some cherries in the cooking, making sure they were a bit old to not have any bitter taste, it is honestly the best cobbler i have ever tasted

I used a mix of fresh cherries, blueberries, and raspberries. This cobbler has a cake-like consistency, not overly sweet, and not like the cobbler I'm used to. I ended up eating it for breakfast. It was easy though.

Tried doubling for a 9 x 13 pan...too much cake-like dough. Used combination of frozen & fresh peaches, which I drained. Wish I hadn't cuz it turned out dry (really embarrassing) & unappealing. Couldn't even tell the peaches were fresh--sad! We like our peach cobblers to be juicy with crust more like a pie, so this recipe definitely wasn't what I was looking for, nor was it a success.

Love it! I had never made any cobbler before but wanted to try it out before Thanksgiving. So glad i picked this one to try first! I took the advice i read and added 1 TSP of vanilla extract into the batter & sprinkled some Light BROWN sugar on top. I made mine with a can of splenda sweetened cherry filling. i used a 9x9 pan and sprayed cooking spray generously. The top has a great crunch, which makes me want to use a long pan for a more thinner and larger crust area :) My husband loved it! And he isn't even really into sweets! Making this against in a few weeks for Thanksgiving for sure =)

This recipe is the same as my Mother used to make and I have been using it for years!  It's very versatile.  So considering the type of fruit you are using, adding some pineapple also will sweeten it up.

I don't think I did anything wrong as this was a very easy recipe to follow, but I did not like this. I used white peaches because that was what I had, but other than that, I made no changes. I doubt that white peaches would make a big difference, especially since I tried a slice as I was putting this cobbler together, and it was ripe and sweet. Well, I did not like this. It just was very underwhelming. I even tried topping it with vanilla ice cream. My husband said he just didn't care for it. In my opinion, it was weird and "bready" and just not good. Too bad.

Simple and easy...my kind of recipe!  I made some changes in the recipe as I did not have fresh peaches so I used 3 medium red delicious apples for my cobbler.  I also added cinnamon and since I did not want the cobbler to be dry I added 1/2 cup of apple juice. It was just delicious!

It turned out great I chose apples I did add 1/8 cup of dark brown sugar a couple of dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg and then topped with a glaze and Carmel drizzle I made the glaze with 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar and 3 teaspoons of milk and a quick dash of vanilla extract

If you are using wild blackberries, I would reccomend sugaring the fruit prior to adding to the batter.

Awesome! Used some of all the previous suggestions. Added 1/2 brown sugar and 1 t vanilla to cake mix,  sprinkled brown sugar on top and added just a sprinkle of sugar and 1 t cinnamon to peaches. It was perfect, everyone loved it warm with vanilla ice cream! Great summer dessert. So easy to make. Took me about 15 mins, including preparing the fresh peaches. Thanks!

I made this recipe as written and it turned out good. Next I added some vanilla to the batter, and sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking, and then when done I sprinkled with cinnomon sugar. Good Yumy. Next time I think I might try a mix of white and brown sugar for the batter as well as the brown on top. I used a can of Freestone Peaches, I think I might try it with fresh strawberries.

I made this with some fresh cherry's and was not disappointed. Even though this does not taste like the cobbler I grew up on, it definitely hit the spot, thanks for the recipe!

This is so simple and so good!  I've made it with fresh apples (+ a little cinnamon and sugar on top), with frozen berries, and canned cherry pie filling.  They were all delicious, and nothing could be easier.

It did not turn out well for me. It didn't ever get a golden brown. I will probably try it again -- maybe with a different fruit as I used nectarines this time.

I didn't care for this. It was too cakey - I guess I prefer the biscuit type dough. I also made it with splenda and I didn't like the weird taste of the splenda. Next time I use splenda, I'll do half-and-half with sugar.

Great recipe and so easy.  The only problem I had was that the batter didn't look right (too white), so I added an egg, it turned out awesome and would definately make it again.... and again.  I also added approx. 1/2 cup fresh blueberries too, and served warm with vanilla ice creat... excellent!!

Overall, this is a delicious and easy dessert.  I made it with granny smith apples and increased the fruit to 3 cups (3 large apples). I think that I would use 1/2 the amount of butter next time as it was a bit too greasy and buttery tasting. Also- I used whole wheat flour- which tasted great but the batter needed a few more spoonfuls of milk to get the consistency right. I added vanilla to the batter as recommended by other reviewers and also mixed the apples with cinnamon and a bit of sugar before adding to batter. Really yummy!

This was definitely easy!  I used frozen peaches and cooked the dish a little longer.  The bottom portion was a little bland, next time I make this I will follow other reviewers comments and add vanilla extract and cinnamon.

Very good, simple,easy!  Good with ice cream on warm cobbler. I added half brown sugar/white sugar, used half & half instead of milk.

Sooo easy to make fresh homemade cobbler! I will use a little more fruit next time, and maybe a little cinnamon, but this was a big hit.

So easy and so delicious. I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk when I made mine other then that everything was the same.  I also tried it with fresh apples which I let sit in the heavy cream while I did the rest of the prep to keep them from drying out. It worked out well if you want to use fresh apples instead. Add some cinnamon too and its perfect.

Very good! I used freshly picked cherries in the cobbler. Watch closely while cooking to make sure that it doesn't overcook. The sides got a little burnt and rubbery. Like others suggested, I added some vanilla to the batter. My family thought that it was perfect though.

My friend and I wanted a dessert to go with our lentil soup, but didn't want to go to the store for ingredients.  We found this recipe and it was delicious and soooooo simple to make.  We added cranberries, brown sugar, and walnuts.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful treat.

This was an easy cobbler to make...and very quick for a fun family dessert.  I would probably opt for a more crusty style cobbler if I was having guests.

This was yummy! I used 2 cans of drained peaches and sprinkled some cinnamon on them. Instead of using all white sugar, i did as a review suggested and used 1/4c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar and a splash of vanilla. Will definately make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was super easy.  I've made it with raspberries and blueberries.  It's best served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  I can't wait to try it with other kinds of fruit!

This was very tasty but a little dry as I made it with fresh peaches.  I'll make it again, but maybe with berries and will add some liquid.

Really love this recipe!  I used a large can of sliced peaches (drained), and added cinnamon (1 tsp) and vanilla flavoring (1 tsp) to the batter mixture.  I used an entire stick of butter and baked this as described in a 9X13 "pyrex" type dish.  Almost the entire pie is gone (for just 4 people)!!  Some brown sugar would also add a nice touch/extra flavor, but I was out, so I just used white granulated sugar.  Great recipe --- thanks for sharing!

I made with freshly picked raspberries and the recipe was perfect.  I did change the cooking time in my convection oven from 60 min to 45 min and it turned out perfectly cooked but still very moist, not too buttery either.

A delicious and very simple cobbler with a soft cake-y texture.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and spread the peaches out across the top instead of just in the center.  I also only baked it for 50 minutes in high altitude.

I Luved this reciper. I agree with previous reviewers when said that it took them literally 10 min to whip up. Super easy! I made some changes though to make it a little healthier (makes me feel better about eating more.)
I subsituted 1/2 the flour with stone ground graham wheat flour, I substituted all of the sugar with Splenda(although next time I think I'll only substitute 1/2 the sugar with Splenda). I used nectarines and plums( its what I had laying around) All in all it was a good recipe! will definently make it again

I love this cobbler, I make it all the time.  I've used frozen peaches, frozen mixed berries, canned blueberry pie filling, and a jar of fried apples from Cracker Barrel.  Everyone loves it.  Anytime I have friends over and they request something sweet, this is so easy to throw together, and it's perfectly ready in an hour.  It's so simple!

Very good cobbler, but a bit bland. I added 1 tsp. vanilla to the batter and some cinnamon to the fruit, and I still think that next time I'd add 1 tsp. of almond to the batter for a bit more flavor. I made this with nectarines and peaches and they were a great combo.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used a leftover fruit salad from last night's dinner. I followed directions and didn't stir the fruit into the batter but it didn't spread about 3 inches to the edges.  I'll definitely make it again but I'll probably spread the fruit out a little from the center.

yummy batter. I used blackberries so it was really sour but that was not the recipes fault. I just put a lot of powder sugar and ice cream on it which took care of the problem!

The cobbler was yummy, but wasn't a traditional "cobbler."  A little "bready" and without a crumbly top.  We used apples instead of peaches, which tasted great.

This was a quick and easy dessert to make!  
I added a little brown sugar to the top of the peaches.  This is a tasty treat!
