Great dish, simple to make, I used 2-3 teaspoons of garlic / chilli sauce  for the extra kick.

Quick and Easy!  Cooking moves fast with a wok so be sure to prep everything beforehand.  The chili garlic sauce is essential since this is meant to be a spicy dish.  Full of flavor and the veggies a nice sweetness to counter the salt in the sauce.

Good recipe, will definitely make this again
What I changed was to double the liquids and instead of rice I made it with Cauliflower rice, saved calories and it tasted great

Very good, didnâ€™t have corn starch so subbed flour and used half a red pepper and half green pepper. Served over quinoa. Very good, will make again!

This recipe was easy to make. Delicious! And low-carb if you use Splenda. Less than 30 minutes from prep to serve

I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.  We did add more chili garlic sauce to add more heat.  When making in the future, I would increase the sauce slightly to make more gravy when mixing with the rice.

We make this at least twice a month, usually with cauliflower rice instead of regular rice. It's delicious.
