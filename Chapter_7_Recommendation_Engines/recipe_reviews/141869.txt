Whoa!!! This is excellent!!! And, can you say HEALTHY???  Superb recipe. Only change I made was to use 4 cloves of garlic (what can I say - I'm a garlic freak.) I've also used a similar method with swiss chard and spinach, but never tried it with balsamic vinegar. That adds a real tasty touch! Note that the recipe says to cook the kale until half of the volume is reduced. Don't over cook it - it's healthier that way!! You don't want it to end up like a wet rag. There should still be a hint of crispness to the leaves. Also, toss the kale a few times and it won't burn. The water on the leaves from washing should be enough. Simple, tasty and good for you!!!

This was a super recipe!  If you are a novice at cooking kale, like I was a while ago, you need to strip the leaves off the stems and also chop the leaves a bit before cooking. You should add a small amount of water when cooking the kale and watch carefully so it doesn't boil away and burn. This recipe is very easy and has a really nice flavor.  Thank you so much!

Very nice kale preparation.  Tastes very Southern, even though its Italian.   Be advised it takes at least 20 minutes to wash and de-spine and chop the kale.  Also, it helps to have half of the olive oil in the pan when you're cooking the kale, to help it from sticking.  Also, add 1/2 cup of water and cover the pan- this will ensure that the kale doesn't burn.  The water will evaporate off at the end, leaving nicely sauteed kale.

In the past, I steamed my kale (chard, spinach, etc.), then transfered it to a frying pan with garlic butter, and then dressed it on the plate with balsamic vinaigrette . . . so imagine how happy I was to see this simplified version of a side-dish I enjoy so much (albeit sheepish about not having figured out the "one pan" method for myself. Seems so obvious now!) Anyway, this tastes wonderful: fresh greens are so easy and good for you!

NEEDS 1/2 CUP LIQUID.  This is a good way to cook any greens: kale, spinach, chard, collards. Saute the garlic in olive oil, add the greens -with some liquid, like water, veggie or chicken broth, cook it down, add a little salt. Your done.  The vinegar is tasty.

I made this recipe as listed and it was very good.  Next time, I plan to cut the amount of balsamic vinegar in half.  There was too much and it overpowered the taste of the vegetable.

Our neighbor gave us a bunch of fresh kale from her garden.  I didn't know how to prepare it, so gave this recipe a try.  I've made spinach this way, and the kale tasted just as good with the EVOO, garlic, & balsamic.  Felt like we were doing something very healthy for ourselves with dinner tonight!  Thanks, Dwieberg.

I loved this, although i did it a bit differently. I doubled the recipe, then ran out of balsamic vinegar after one tablespoon. So i did one of dijon mustard, one of regular vinegar and 2/3 of a tablespoon of sugar. It was awesome, especially for my first time cooking kale.

I'm sure it would have been much tastier if I didn't burn it. Smelled lovely in the pot. I think it just needed some more water... make sure you keep enough water while steaming the kale!

Since I learned cooking styles from a true italian, I knew to season the pot with the ollive oil and garlic (over med to med high heat), then I tossed in the chopped kale and after a couple tosses, I turned the heat off and let it sit for a few minutes.  Finally, I drizzled it with the balsamic vinegar, tossed it again and served it with blue cheese crumbles.  Awesome!!

This is a great recipe! Very simple & full of flavor! I have Kale coming out of my ears right now (over-planted, oops!) & as long as you use GOOD QUALITY balsamic (I use Olivier from Wiiliams-Sonoma) it compliments rather than over-powers. I do add a couple of Tablespoons of water when wilting (or reducing) the kale. Thanks!

This was my first trial at making kale and it turned out great with a few adjustments based on the reviews.  Saute the garlic first in 1/2 of the oil recommended, then add 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth and the kale. After the broth evaporates, toss in a little balsamic vinaigrette dressing and top with toasted slivered almonds and navy beans for a tasty and healthy meal!

I've never made Kale, so this was a first try for me.  I have to say, I really liked it!  Not sure if my family felt the same way, but I think if I doctor it up with a little more flavor, they may come around to liking it.  I ate kale quite often as a child, and I'm pretty sure my grandma used a LOT more garlic, and probably a dash of sugar, so I'm going to try that next time.  (Coming from a family that is 100% Sicilian, I'm pretty sure my grandma put sugar in EVERYTHING!) :)  I served my kale as a side dish with Pesto Cream Sauce Linguini, also found on this site.  It was a nice combo!  I will definitely be making both dishes again!

I was skeptical about the vinegar in this recipe, but it was actually really tasty and helped offset the bitterness of the kale.  The only change i made was a couple pinches of cayenne pepper flakes because the smell reminded me of chicken wings with hot sauce.  The little extra kick blended in nicely without being overpowering.  I will definitely make this again!

I didn't dry the kale leaves after washing them, I put them right into the pan with about a table spoon on water so it wouldn't burn. Also, Lower the temperature considerably before adding the oil and vinegar so it doesn't burn the pan. After I took it off the stove I then put it In the oven preheated at 350 so it would have a crunchy crisp to it. And then I sprinkled Parmesan cheese onto it. Turned out wonderful!

Love kale. This recipe is pretty basic. The only thing I would suggest is keeping the leaves wet before adding to the pan. This will give you a few minutes of steam to help cook the greens. I also hollowed out a space between the kale when it was almost done, and sauteed the garlic first, before adding the balsamic vinegar.

Greens are best made very simply and this recipe fit the bill. I did put a small amount of water in the pan and cooked covered until the kale had reduced. I drained the water, added everything else and cooked for another 2 minutes or so. Very tasty.

I looked at this recipe and thought, "hmm... looks to me like I'm about to burn some kale." Then I thought, "nah, it can't be... it has such a high rating!" I followed the recipe to the letter, and sure enough, had to run my pan of charred kale out the back door while the smoke alarm blared inside. What did I do wrong?

I started the kale with about 1/4c of water.  After it cooked down, I added three cloves of garlic, 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp of balsalmic, a shake of red pepper flake, and a good amount of salt and black pepper.  It was delicious...my first attempt at making kale.

Was trying Kale for the first time tonight.....the woman at the farmer's market suggested we try Red Russian Kale first because it is less bitter so we bought a bunch. Not knowing how to cook it I searched and found this recipe. I did mostly follow the ingredients, I just changed up the order. I first sauteed some onion and garlic scapes (also bought at the farmer's market) then added the kale with about 1/4 cup of water. I let the kale wilt and then added the salt (kosher), pepper and just a little red pepper flakes. At the very end I added a nice aged balsamic vinegar. Then cooked for the last 2 minutes. I ate all of my serving and hubby ate most of his.....he was just glad that I was eating and enjoying a leafy green vegetable. Will definitely make again!!

In my opinion, as the recipe is written, the kale is undercooked. It may be a matter of personal preference as well that I didn't care for the vinegar. I prefer to use fresh lemon juice instead because any kind of vinegar on cooked greens seems to be overpowering.

We all loved this!  I love the idea that no fluid is added so you don't loose the water soluble vitamins!  All my kids ate this, it had really good flavor.  I didn't add much salt and it was almost too strong so don't over-do the sodium!  Thanks for sharing this!

This was great ... I added more garlic though.  Nice to have a healthy kale recipe that doesn't call for bacon!

This was so good. I changed it up a bit by mincing up a red onion and sauteeing it in the olive oil until tender, then adding a clove of minced garlic. Finally added the kale, with about 1/2 cup of beef broth, and the balsamic and reduced. It was amazing!

Next time, I will I cook the kale down with water first. It was not soft enough. Otherwise, my dad and I loved it! I have never had balsamic vinegar before. The smell is horrible but it tastes incredible! Will make this again!

Very good and simple recipe! I was out of balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead and it worked just as well. Thanks!

I made this for New Year's Day and it was wonderful.  I steamed the kale in a little chicken broth to add some flavor.  We will definitely have more kale.

I have never cooked kale before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I subbed butter for the oil, but otherwise I followed the recipe. I had leftovers so I threw them in with some chicken soup, and it really kicked it up a notch, in fact, I might just have to make some for my next pot of soup!

I loved this, but like other reviewers, I started with the olive oil and garlic, then added the kale.  My kale wasn't "wet", so I added a few splashes of water when I added the kale.  Yummy.  I think I'll also try it with a little red wine vinegar instead of the balsamic, just for something different.

Easy and tasty!!  Definately needed the 1/2 cup of water.  I cooked the Kale for about 20 minutes and it was perfect.  I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used white.  Reduce the amount of vinegar if you have to use white as it was a little strong.  Definately a "keeper".

I thought it was very good, as I had never cooked kale before.  I added some sugar, more vinegar and cooked at least 10 minutes or longer.  I am sorry that I never cooked it before I lost my husband, as he would have loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! Now I can eat kale.
I have been trying to eat more greens and have been trying to include kale but have been struggling with the bitter taste. This recipe is delicious. I added sautéed onion, 1/3 c water, and increased the garlic to 2 cloves.

This was delicious.  I used spinach, kale and red chard.  Steamed it in the wok for  few minutes then added the garlic, olive oil and balsamic, let it cook for a few more minutes.  It had a really nice flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I like the flavor, unfortunately due to the oil and the fact that you cook away a lot of the nutrients in the Kale it doesn't seem like a very healthy choice. I may try to use less oil next time... we will have to make this again!

I picked up some Kale at the farmers market after reading about its super food qualities and had no idea what to do with it. This recipe is an easy, delicious and fast way to prepare kale. I've already made it 4 times!

Delicious flavor and simple preparation. I would use less B.V. Plus, using a mixture of varieties of Kale added to the taste. Great recipe to keep on hand for the summer as it makes an easy side dish, or when coupled with rice/meatballs/pasta can be a great meal.

This was ok.  It was a little too much vinegar for me.  Other than that I did like it enough to eat some left over the next day.

We did not care for this recipe.  I did not have balsamic though - I used red wine vinegar - so maybe that is my fault.  It was just bitter and not very yummy.  My husband wouldn't eat it.

My husband and I both thought that there was WAY too much vinegar in this recipe.  We couldn't taste anything else and it was too powerful to eat. :( Also, we followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1/2c. water while the kale was cooking covered.  This worked marvelously, but I would recommend draining the water before adding the remaining ingredients.  If you cook it long enough to evaporate the water, it will be too well done!

Really easy and healthy. I added more garlic and a can of diced Italian tomatoes to the kale after it had been reduced to half. Also, if you don't us any liquid the kale will cook down really fast and get burned. I used a cup of chicken broth poured over the kale in the beginning. Otherwise, really good, my husband loved this and he's not a huge kale fan.

This is a great recipe for kale, but also almost identical to one I use for dandelion greens (buy organic only or you might get way too many pesiticides in this type of veg!). I use soy sauce in place of salt. My kids even ASK for both of these greens.

Delicious! I combined this recipes' instructions with the directions on the back of the bag of kale I bought on a whim when it was on sale. I followed these directions, and I also added a can of crushed tomatoes with basil and some Italian seasoning mix in after the kale wilted to half volume. It's so delicious!!! I've never had this before, but I'm sure I will again.

I got a bunch of kale at the CSA I just joined and wanted a recipe that wouldn't overpower the flavor for my first taste test.  I don't think I'll ever try another kale recipe. We loved it, absolutely scrumptious.  I only added a little bit of fresh basil and used garlic scapes (another new CSA gift) instead of a garlic clove.   Yummy. On to that funny looking kohlrabi that's still in the fridge.

We didn't really care for this. I am trying to eat more kale since it has been labelled the world's healthiest vegetable. We didn't really like the sour taste of the balsamic with the taste of the greens. Maybe it is better if you have really good aged balsamic? I would also like the greens cooked longer so they weren't as tough.

Kale is a greatly underrated veggie and this simple preparation gives it an additional kick. I added some crispy onion bits (from Trader Joe's) and I think that made it even better.

This was just ok for me. The balsamic vinegar made it taste more like a pickled kale. And the color is not the best either.

I was looking for some inspiration for what to do with kale, and I found it!   I didn't exactly follow the recipe, but used it as a start.  Before doing anything with the kale, I sauteed some sweet potatoes, mushrooms, and onion (cut into bite size pieces) with garlic.  I added the kale, following instructions loosely, plus some crushed red pepper.   Not exactly the recipe, but yum!

If I make this again, I will reduce the amount of vinegar in it and/or change the type of vinegar used. Red wine would probably be better; balsamic is too strong in this quantity.

Spiced it up a bit by mixing toasted sesame seed oil with olive oil and using garlic balsamic vinegar and fig balsamic vinegar because I I was out of plain balsamic vinegar. Result was great. Kale cooked much quicker than expected and was very tender.

This recipe was easy and really delicious with the balsamic vinegar.  The kale cooks down to be so much less than when you start so make sure you have a full batch of kale.  My husband and I both wanted more as I hadn’t started with enough!

Concept is good, implementation is  poor.   Prepared as directed results in burnt kale.  12 cups of kale is a considerable volume, a large saucepan is not large enough.  A nice deep and wide skillet, the kind you use to prepare a large dish with a sauce. To properly wilt the kale you need broth (or water) , 1/2 to 2/3's cup or more.  Kale is a dry vegetable, unlike say  spinach . And, turn down the heat.  Be gentle with your food.

My whole family loves the recipe, even my two year old says he wants more "green" when we eat it. ;) I usually serve this as a side to a pasta dish of some sort when we are burnt out on salad.

I love this! Just tried kale for the first time and have tried several variations of this dish. I added some cooked sliced red beets and leeks which added color and texture. This will be a go to dish for a quick, healthy supper.

This was great; my family loved it.  I have to admit I made some modifications, though.  I put the olive oil in the pan and tossed in a handful of pine nuts.  When they started to brown, I added the garlic, gave it a quick stir and dumped baby kale in my big 12.5" skillet until it was heaped high and wouldn't hold any more.  I turned it with the pine nuts and garlic until it was cooked down and added the 2 TB balsamic vinegar.  Because greens cook down so dramatically and the result looked like it had a lot of sauce, I made a second pan full and only added 1 TB of Balsamic.  I mixed both batches together in a serving bowl and added some feta cheese.  Even my veggie hating son liked it.  Delicious, fast, and super easy.

I make kale like this all the time, except I use more garlic since we like it.  Sometimes I add a few sprinkles of crushed red chili pepper flakes for an extra kick.

Delicious! If I'd known how easy it was to make great tasting kale I'd have been doing it for years. I did add a bit of water (1/4 cup or so) to help prevent it from sticking, and that worked well for me. Will make this again and again - thanks!

The preparation method was fantastic. The flavor was not quite amazing for me. I think you really need to love balsamic vinegar to like this. I'll experiment with using other herbs/vinegars/onion or something to give flavor in the future.

This kale did not turn out well.  Like others have suggested, the balsamic overpowered the dish.  I added 3 tbsps water to the cooking kale based on some of the reviews, but it didn't cook off and the kale turned out really watery.  Based on the 15 minute cook time, I thought it would cook longer, but after 3 minutes, it was reduced by more than half and I think it was overcooked.  I will not make this one again.

We are  using more greens and keep looking for different ways to cook them.  Loved this one for Kale and  only changed a few hings.  I cooked the kale with about 3/4 cupof chicken broth (I used Trader Joe's) until the kale is reduced to half, by that time the broth is almost gone, used only 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar since that was all I had  and then added the olive oil and minced garlic........came out wonderful.  We will have this often now.

This did not turn out well. I made as instructed and my kale burned and then the vinegar was too strong. The kale was still tough and chewy. The only great thing was the suggestion of another reviewer to throw in a few grape tomatoes at the end.

My CSA kale was turning yellow, and i had a choice between freezing it for later, or eating it.  I found this recipe, and it was simple and quick enough for the mood I was in.  Yum!  I almost screwed it up by assuming that I'd be cooking it in water.  With no mention of water, I threw out the pot-full of water I'd begun to heat, and replaced it with the kale, chopped and still wet from rinsing.  From here on, it was a cinch.  The only changes I made -- no pepper with a nod to my food sensitivity, twice as much garlic, and raw pumpkin seeds I quickly toasted and threw on the top of the kale as a garnish.  Excellente!!

This was great! Very easy to make. I used red kale (the curly kind) and I didn't have any balsamic, so i substituted red wine vinegar and it was still good. I think balsamic would be better though. A delicious, simple way to prepare a very healthy veggie - awesome!

This was the first time we have ever had kale.  The recipe was alright.  I think I will make it again.

Italian cuisine RULES when it comes to vegetables.  This is my favourite recipe for kale.  It's delicious!  I found other readers comments very helpful in fine-tuning recipes.

A easy and classic way to spice up Kale.  We loved it but we love Kale period!

This is pretty good, but I must have used too large a clove of garlic because the flavor was overpowering (and I'm a big garlic fan!). However, the kale still had some crunch and natural flavor. Easy, quick, healthy side.

Not our favorite : (  I might try it again but will cut back on the vinegar, I thought it overwhelmed everything else. The family wasn't impressed, but they were troopers and tried it.

I thought this recipe was great - easy, healthy, and delicious! I followed the directions, while adding a bit of water to the kale during the first step (as others suggested). I also tripled the amount of garlic. I also chopped up the stems and threw them in with the leaves, and was glad that I hadn't discarded them. The result was a tender, yummy side dish - not too oily or tangy, like some other vegetable sautees that use oil and vinegar.

Only made kale once before in a portugese soup and it was great.  This recipe didn't work for me. I didn't like the taste of the kale with these ingredients.

This recipe was very easy and tasty.  I added some water to the pan as previous reviewers suggested.  I also used 4 cloves of garlic and used kosher salt.  I just eye-balled the vinegar, but it was probably less than what the recipe calls for, and it was plenty.  I will definitely make this again.

This was good but I was a bit overwhelmed by the pockets of garlic.  It was difficult to distribute the minced garlic evenly throughout the kale at the point of insertion in the recipe.  I'll try again, maybe this time mixing the oil, vinegar and garlic together before pouring into the pan to see if it distributes better.

Did not love this, BUT I decided that I just don't like leafy veggies...I had some Kale leftover from making soup so I tried it.

This simple recipe makes getting a not-so-popular veggie on the table easy. Very flavorful (the vinegar is a perfect complement to the earthy kale)and went great with my dinner of pork chops in mushroom sauce and red mashed potatoes. Per other reviews, it was helpful to know that you should trim the leaves completely from their stem, chop the leaves, and add a bit of water to the pan in first stage of wilting.

I don't think I let the kale wilt long enough as it was kind of chewy, but we liked the Italian flavor.

Pretty good. I don't love kale, but I eat it for its nutritional value, and this recipe made it palatable. Go easy on the balsamic vinegar. Also, the kale cooked much more quickly for me than the recipe indicated, so watch it closely so it doesn't burn.

I tried sauteeing this in the pan, but it turned crispy instead of wilting.  Next time I will steam first.  The flavor was ok, but the crispy texture was awful.  I couldn't even eat it.

Not bad... very strong balsamic taste.  I'd probably make it again.
