This is a fast simple recipe. It is good as the recipe states or with chicken.

This is more of a side dish than a main dish. I chose to add in some saut√©ed shrimp to make it have a little bit more substance; it was OK but it's not anything that I would rave about.

I made this when I had asked my husband what he wanted to eat and he replied "whatever is fastest". It doesn't get any faster or easier than spaghetti, peperoncino,  aglio e olio for a "primo" (first plate). I waited until the pasta was about 2 minutes away from being ready to heat the oil, garlic, and peppers.

Yum! This was so easy to put together. I've never had gluten free pasta before, but it tastes just like normal pasta to me!

We enjoyed this.  Very easy and quick to put together.  I added a touch of basil and a healthy dose of crushed red pepper.  You can add your own touches easily making this a good base to use up leftover veggies.
