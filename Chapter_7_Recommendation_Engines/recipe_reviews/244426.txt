This has become my go-to method for using up fruit of various kinds. We have so much great fruit in our area that it's hard to keep up with it. This is a great option for apples, pears, you name it.

I made it with black plums and 1/4 c blueberries.
I did not peel the plums but cut them into slices!
Yum!

This was super easy to prepare, with the added benefit of having a little "wow" factor in presentation. It tasted great, but if you're looking for a gooey pie filling, this is not it.  The taste was  not too sweet or overly sugary, which we appreciated. My family loved it, and I would definitely make it again.

Such an easy and simple dessert to make. I used apples and blueberries because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great!

Swapped apples for pears because I had pears I needed to use up, used the pie dough roll found in the refrigerated section, and added almonds & oats for more texture!

The recipe worked a treat as it was. I picked this because I had leftover pie dough that wasn't quite enough for a second pie. Otherwise, did everything the same. 

If I were to make it again, I would drizzle a little lemon juice over the apples to give a little more acid and dust the pie with powdered sugar to serve, but that's just personal preference.
