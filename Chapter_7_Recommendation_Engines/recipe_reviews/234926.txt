These are delicious and SO easy to make! The crunch of the pretzel makes this extra special. They also look really cute when served in mini muffin wrappers.

I thought these were okay. I wasn't real fond of the slight after taste of the cream cheese, compared to regular peanut butter bonbons. I also didn't much taste the pretzel like I expected. I blended them in my Vitamix, on speed 3, for about 15 seconds or so. That's a huge time saver. There were plenty of 1/4" sized bits after doing that. I didn't think the filling was really sweet, nor did I get that sweet salty balance. The main flavor was pb and cream cheese. I changed the servings to 4 to try the recipe, since I had the ingredients in the house, and I got 9 bonbons as the yield would suggest by making 1/4 of the recipe. For ease I had to dampen my hands to work with the pb filling and I used a cookie scoop to shape them, which worked well. From a taste stand point, I will have to see what others think. I am always looking for new holiday candy ideas. ty

Wow, I did not like these. I so wanted to like them, but there was just something off with the combination of the peanut butter and cream cheese. Interestingly enough, they actually look like they would be good, I was so disappointed in how they tasted. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but the combination of these ingredients just didn't end up in a good final product. I agree with almost every point made by Holiday Baker in her review, the filling wasn't right. The pb and cream cheese dominated and not in a good way. It didn't taste at all like a bonbon, just like pb with cream cheese. Sometimes when companies promote a recipe designed to sell their product, the recipe just isn't that great. This is one of these instances. Time to take this one back to the lab!

This is a great recipe. Made it as a gift and it was a HIT! The only addition was adding a little vanilla extract, otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Next time I'll top with a drizzle of melted white chocolate chips for a little added flare!

I made these bonbons with NO changes whatsoever to the recipe for a company potluck, and they were a big hit.     

I was initially concerned about adding the cream cheese since some other reviewers hadn’t liked it, but it was totally fine.  When the cream cheese is blended with the peanut butter (use a blender - perhaps people aren't blending thoroughly?), you don’t taste it as peanut butter and cream cheese.  It becomes more like a rich peanut butter with a slight cheesecake texture/taste.   My husband, who is not a fan of cream cheese by itself, tasted the PB & cream cheese blend before I added any other ingredients, and liked it a lot.    Plus, once you add the sugar, the pretzel bits, and cover the whole thing in chocolate, there’s so much else going on taste-wise, the cream cheese does not stand out at all, and it helps make the mixture easier to handle for dipping.  

I used a tablespoon and teaspoon to scoop the mixture and help shape it into uniformly-sized balls, so the bonbons would come in two sizes to suit people who wanted big or little pieces.  

I definitely recommend using the mini-muffin liners to hold the bonbons, as these are serious chocolate eats and it gives people something to hold them in so the chocolate doesn’t melt on their hands.   

The recipe recommends using a fork to spear the balls for the dipping process: personally, I found it easier to use a small pair of tongs, but either way works.  

Bottom line, awesome recipe, and the proportions were

Wonderful and simple to make! I added about 1/2 tsp. vanilla to peanut butter mixture. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. Don't understand any of the negative comments. Ghiradelli is clearly the best!

I wasn't excited about the flavor of the filling. Actually extremely disappointed with it. But since it was my money invested in the ingredients I took it upon myself to fix it with one tablespoon melted butter, one tsp. Vanilla extract,  1 tsp salt and 2 more tbls. Peanut butter. The salty sweet crunch became awesome and the weird cream cheese 5th was completely gone.
