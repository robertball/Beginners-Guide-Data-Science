This is my introduction to muesli and we enjoyed it. I like that you easily can mix it up the night before and it's ready for you in the morning. All of this recipe's ingredients are things that I eat often (just not all together) so I felt pretty certain I'd like this...and I did!

This was like yogurt porridge. I feel like I wasted my ingredients. I could see how some people may possible like it so I wouldn't give it 1-star but I don't think this is an impressive recipe.
