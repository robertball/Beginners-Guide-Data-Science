it wasnt quite like store bought whipped cream. Its got a stronger taste...stronger vanilla and stronger sugar. I will personally add 1/2 tsp vanilla next time instead of 1tsp.

My daughter and I made this to go on our iced coffee today. I didn't have heavy whipping cream, only regular whipping cream, but it still whipped up nicely and held its form. I also generously heaped the 2tbs. of powdered sugar and added an extra 1/4tsp. vanilla extract. It reminds me of the whipped cream in the can, but even better. So good!!  Oh.. a glass bowl worked fine chilled in the freezer for about 5 minutes first, along with the beaters.

Perfect and simple. We loved it. I used Black Madagascar vanilla extract, that is what I had (a gift from a Dear One).

Super delicious and much better tasting than store bought. To be warned it does make a lot more whipped cream than you'd think, plus after whipping you should consider refrigerating it for a bit after to firm it up a bit after working it so much if it begins to melt.

Very nice whipped topping.  Will make again, prefer it to store bought.  Must use super fine sugar, don't have any?? just place regular sugar in food processor till fine sand texture.  Double recipe to frost an angel food cake, 1 cup cream doesn't make enough.

This is great.  Will  not be buying   whipping cream in the can or cool whip again.  It takes only a few minutes to make and   tastes so much better than store bought brands.  I did chill the bowl and beaters for 30 + minutes prior to making whip cream.

I didn't have any superfine sugar so I used regular.  I added 1/2 t extra and the vanilla.  It wasn't really sweet enough.  I added a little extra sugar with some improvement but it still wasn't exactly what I had hoped for.  I think I'll just stick to store bought.  Sorry.  Thank you anyway for the recipe.

This recipe calls for "superfine" sugar but I just used regular sugar as suggested by another reviewer and it turned out great.

This came out perfectly and helped me out of a pinch. I make a chocolate pudding/mousse with whipped cream and realized, at the last minute, that I was out of the store bought stuff. I did use 3T of powdered sugar, but that was my only addition. Thank you for sharing!

This was a huge hit at Christmas! I baked the gingerbread in a 9x13 pan which allowed me to do 3 layers. As per suggestion, I did put some bourbon in my whipped cream as well! Delicious and everyone loved it!

This is amazing. I used it to frost an almond scented layer cake and it was perfect. I added a bit jmore superfine sugar, but that's just a matter of personal taste.

Very good, and the texture was beautiful but the vanilla flavor is a little too strong. Next time I might cut it down to 1/2 teaspoon.

I have made this recipe repeatedly and followed exactly and turns out perfect every time.  Thank you so much for the advice of freezing the bowl makes a huge difference.  I use this recipe for my banana cream pie from this sight.

De-Lish!!!  I didn't have any ready made super fine sugar, so I put regular sugar in my mini blender and, voila!  This will be my go-to for whipping cream, from now on.

So easy and so delicious.  I used this recipe to make a whipped cream frosting for my banana pudding cupcakes and they were amazing.

This whipped cream tasted amazing!  I had heavy whipping cream lying around and decided to make it.  I was so glad I did because it tasted great and my  family loved it.  I will definitely make it again in the future.

This is a wonderful recipe for making "basic" Whipped Cream. I didn't have (rarely do) Superfine Sugar so I just took some "regular" granulated Sugar, popped it into my Food Processor and pulsed it a few times (Abracadabra, Superfine Sugar :) ). I actually made 2 batches for this year's Thanksgiving gathering (my "assignment" this year was to "bring the desserts"): the 1st batch was made exactly as written and worked wonderfully (for those who opted) on ALL of the Pies and other desserts I made. But (shame on me, lol), I forgot to include the Vanilla Extract in my Pumpkin Pies, so for my 2nd batch of Whipped Cream, I included an ADDITIONAL tsp. of it. I didn't say a word, but many (and we were 23) actually did generate to the "more Vanilla-ed"  batch for BOTH their Pumpkin Pie and Pecan Pie desserts. Go figure, lol. :)

My 14 year old son made this using head whipping cream. Served as too layer on a homemade chocolate cream pie, and it was hands down, amazing. We have a slice of pie left in the fridge four days later, and the whipped cream is still thick and firm.

Pretty great! I had some left over Heavy Whipping Cream and didn't know what to do with it so I turned it into whip cream! I didn't have a blender so I had to manually whisk it for about 5 minutes, but added sugar and vanilla extract like it says and it turned out fantastic!!

Just the right amount of sugar, and vanilla adds a little extra taste.  Only problem is that it needs to be used right away as it loses the thickness after a couple of hours.

Actually better than store bought! I love the extra density and creaminess. I used one quarter the amount of vanilla called for and about one tbsp sugar. It was perfect! Love that I can control the amount of sugar and I'll never buy store bought again :-) thx for a keeper

I made this for a Fourth of July cake I made for a party and it was a big hit. Of course I changed the recipe to suit my needs but it was the basic directions

First time making whip cream.  It's super delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as it said. I no longer have a reason to buy the canned kind. This one is way better and I can control the amount of sugar

Didn't change a thing.  Used my new Kithen Aide stand mixer, and like magic, done.  No more Cool Whip for me.  Too Easy.
