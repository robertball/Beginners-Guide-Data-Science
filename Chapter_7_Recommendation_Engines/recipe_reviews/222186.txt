I was looking for something different & yummy, and man, did I hit the jackpot! This pizza was phenomenal! All the ingredients were perfect together, and the husband, 14 & 6 year old ate it up. I also used Chef John's crust recipe, which was just perfect, even though I only let it rise for 2 hours.  Other then the dough, I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee, though I will definitely have fun playing around with it next time.  Cooking's no fun unless you can screw around with it a little!

This was delicious!  That being said, I think I prefer it as an appetizer (on a super thin crust/flatbread) rather than as a meal as it is quite rich.  I followed the recipe, though I did use dough I'd already made and frozen.  I was concerned w/the high bake time, but it's spot on and will be my new pizza cooking method as the result is a perfectly crisp crust.  I did not have fresh herbs, so I chose to use a pinch of dried Italian Seasoning.  Great stuff, Chef John!

This was a nice way to use asparagus, but it was very rich!  Also, I used one clove of garlic, instead of the two recommended, but the finished pizza had a sharp garlic bite.  Roasted garlic might be a better way to go for a mellower garlic effect.

So good!  I used a loaf of Italian bread for the crust, since I'm yeast-bread phobic and none of the ready-made crust options looked very appealing (and were expensive).  So given that the recipe was for a 9" pizza...doubled the ricotta mixture except for the oil.  I also have no idea how to measure a cup of asparagus!!  To me, 'trimmed' means trim off the tough part of the stem, not chop.  So I probably used way more asparagus. (I had 36 spears, most very small, about 75% of a supermarket bunch.)  I also used a pizza blend of cheese for the white cheddar, and a bit of feta on top of that.  Sounds like a lot of mods, but I felt that Chef John was giving us permission, so that's okay!!  Next time I would like to add some onion and mushroom.  Yummy!

This is a family hit! I cheated a bit, used a thin crust in the tube pizza crust and always dust the pizza pan with cornmeal and a very thin coat of olive oil to prevent sticking.  We like spicy, so I used a teaspoon or so of the red pepper flakes, along with Italian seasoning herbs. I did add mushrooms and onion, with the ham. My asparagus were thin, so no prep needed, as Chef John said.  Love the 5 min on low rack, 5 min high.  It was perfect-we are having it again tonight!

Incredible recipe. I've never had asparagus on pizza before and it was really good! Pretty much followed this recipe exactly.

I wanted a white sauce pizza that didn't use a jar of Alfredo sauce. This was fantastic! Didn't have cream so I used milk, but that was the only change to the sauce. I was needing to use some leftover chicken so I didn't use the rest of the recipe, although it sounds yummy and I will try it. I did use the suggestion on how to cook it though and we loved the crisp crust! I will be making this again.

this was very tasty.. fearing it would be incredibly rich like others posted, we used shrimp in place of the smoked ham.. and placed slices of provolone on top for the cheddar.. i would like to try this with a combo of feta and maybe another melty cheese.. as SkiBunny said.. it really is a great inspiration recipe.. ty for the enlightenment

Delicious.  I like to use "Valentino's Pizza Crust" recipe on this site, which makes enough for my 12" pizza pan.  Therefore I made 1.5x the toppings in this recipe.  I did chop my asparagus into 1" pieces which makes the pizza easier to eat in my opinion.  Next time I think I'll add more ham.  I pulled my pizza out after 9 minutes since the crust was browning.  Will make again.

Used Naan bread for crust and only made the toppings. Good use for leftover ham from Easter. Cooked at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes. Liked it a lot.

I have made this a few times now and it is becoming my favorite homemade pizza.  I sometimes make 2 within 2 weeks or so to use up the ricotta and ham. And sometimes I pre-bake the crust a few minutes, or cook the asparagus a bit longer.

Excellent.  I've made it both with ham and cooked bacon.  Both were great.

Cooked in Big Green Egg. I used pizza crust from dairy case at the store. Added a couple of very thin tomato slices. It was delicious. I’ll definitely make this again.

This was an amazing pizza. I did use a super thin crispy crust which suited the rich sauce very well. I threw all the sauce ingredients into the mini chopper and wizzed it up which made it super simple. I used the white chedder in addition to some shredded swiss that I had leftover in the fridge. I wouldn't want this as the main course because it is rich but it was awesome as a side to lasagna. I just loved the flavor of the sauce and how easy it was to throw together.

This was very easy to put together, and very delicious for a change.  I liked the ricotta and Olive oil and herb sauce, and the sweetness of the asparagus went well with the salty nutty cheese.  Very very good

Loved the ricotta mixture on this!  I didn't use any of the herbs listed but did use chives and dill, had parsley on hand but forgot to use it.  Used store bought personal size crust.  Delicious!

Chef John did a very nice job thinking this one up.  I did not use his crust recipe though, I used one from Food Network by Bobby Flay that is ready in 1-2 hours instead of 18. My only change would be the amount of seasoning in the ricotta mixture.  It ended up needing some garlic salt because it was a little under seasoned for my household.  I think the perfect addition would be brushing the crust thinly with a mixture of olive oil, garlic salt, and black pepper, maybe even a little parmesan.  After upping the seasoning, I was delighted.

This is one of the best pizzas I have ever had.  I used regular pizza dough, very thin.  What a great ideas and a great way to enjoy pizza that is not just your ordinary pizza!! Thanks
