The amount of carrots in relation to the two types of cabbage seemed disproportionate, so I cut that back to have equal portions of all three ingredients.  I tasted the dressing and added more lime juice, and ended up with a very nice cole slaw.  This has good eye appeal and good taste, a winning combination!

I added a Granny Smith apple, grated, and left out the oil.  It's delicious!

I loved this!  I followed the previous suggestion to add more lime and since I didn't have peanut oil, I used sunflower oil because I had it on hand.  The sauce is so simple, so flavorful, and just what I was looking for.

Very tasty! I changed peanut oil to 1/4 cup sesame oil and 1/4 cup olive oil due to allergy. I also added more lime juice per another suggestion.

Great! I did cut down on the oil because we found it unnecessary. We ate it on top of some fabulous carnitas (recipe found in allrecipes) in a corn tortilla. They went together fabulously! Huge hit with all six of us, and something that all my kids loved. Thanks!
