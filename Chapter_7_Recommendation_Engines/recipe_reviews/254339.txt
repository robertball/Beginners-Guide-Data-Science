Except to lick the spoon, I haven't tried it yet but it tasted good.  I made 24, so it was a long afternoon in the kitchen.  The only substitution was a cup of sour cream instead of the 4th can of condensed cream.  It took 2 pounds of key limes.  Even with an electric juicer, it was time consuming.
They are cooling as we speak, so whipped cream and raspberries will go on tomorrow.  These are going to an end of summer, birthday boat party and it is hot as blue blazes.  My plan is to freeze them overnight then top and put in a cooler right before we leave.  Wish me luck!

Did not have any distinct taste as I had hoped for. Will not do again.
