I tried this recipe because my family really love soda bread, and adding Bailey's, I figured, could only make it even better. I was so right! The bread turns out moister than normal soda bread, and everyone who's tried it has just loved it. I now make this every St. Patrick's Day, and often when it's not St. Patrick's Day! The one thing I do differently from the recipe is that I substitute currants for the raisins.

This bread came together amazingly quickly in my stand mixer, and turned out perfectly!!  My husband and I couldn't eat the entire loaf ourselves, so I took some to a meeting, where it received rave reviews.  I'd definitely make this again!
