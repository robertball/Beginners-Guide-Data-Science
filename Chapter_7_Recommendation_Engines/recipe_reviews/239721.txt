Really easy and yummy! My family loves cheesecake brownies prepared this way, and have been asking for this almost weekly, since discovering this recipe (thank you for sharing).  Last time I made this, I forgot the butter; however, it made no difference to the taste or texture, so I'll continue to "forget" it the next time I make this again (next week!).

These came out excellent.  Don't expect cheesecake when you bite into cream cheese, you'll be disappointed.  If you want a true cheesecake it's going to take more than just sweetening cream cheese. (or you can buy premade cheesecake filling in the store)  These are fine as-is, and very tasty!

This recipe was great. I should've doubled it! We just used our homemade brownie recipe and it worked out well. I will definitely make these again!

I made this recipe as written, however, I used Ghirardelli triple chocolate brownie mix and after filling the batter into the cups had none left for the top. I placed a good fluffy dollop of cheesecake batter on top of each brownie set the timer for 25 minutes and placed them in the oven. After 25 minutes I checked them with my cake tester and the brownies were still raw. After checking my oven for temperature and trying to figure out why they were not cooking, my granddaughter Olivia, who is 13 years old, figured it out. The directions on the brownie box said to cook brownies for 50 minutes! So please check the cooking time on your brownie mix. I also added an egg to the cheesecake batter and it whipped up nice and fluffy. They were really good! Took one star off for not explaining different cooking times!

Good recipe! I added one egg to the cheesecake batter to thin it out.

I was really disappointed with how these turned out. the texture of the cheesecake filling was odd compared to the brownie, and in turn was a bit off putting. I think if you swirled the cheesecake filling into the brownie batter it'd be more successful. they were easy to make, just nothing special. and while edible, not something I'd prefer or make again.

one word: amazing! 

i will definitely make these again but double my batch to 24 cupcakes.  made these for a bake sale and they sold in less than an hour.  super delish!
i used the mocha brownie pilsbury kind 18.75oz or something like that.  it had this amazing coffee/cheesecake flavor to it.  so good!

I made it with a fudge brownie mix. I added 2 eggs to the cheese portion because so many reviews said it didnâ€™t have a cheesecake taste. I made 1 dozen, using all of both batters. The group I made them for said they were amazing. I will make them again!

One of my co-workers made it for my birthday (we always put in our birthday request) and to be honest it was okay.  Flavor wise not what I was expecting.  Cream cheese I could not taste.

Made recipe according to directions.  Too much batter for 12 cupcakes.  They were also not done after 20 minutes. I ended up throwing 10 out.  Will not make these again.

These were sinfully delicious!!!  Mine looked more brown on top than the ones in the picture since I layered the cream cheese between the brownie mix as directed in the recipe.  Definitely does not need any icing.
