SUCH a cute idea.  Considering Thanksgiving only comes once a year, and this only makes 12 of them, it doesn't seem it would be too terribly time-consuming to shape these.  Will definitely take some practice, but the idea is genius!  Seems to me that some sort of a fish-shaped mold would be a great place to start..

I am not an artist, so they were a bit hard to mold, but tasted great and were a big hit! Next time I am going to try making the "meat" portion entirely of cocoa krispies, rather than coating the end in them.

These were a big hit on Thanksgiving-everyone got such a kick out of them.  They weren't the easiest to shape, but I was able to make them passable.  Like another reviewer, I would try to do these by making the end totally out of cocoa krispies.  You'd lose the good peanut butter taste, but could also add peanut butter to the marshmallow mix.  I like my rice krispie squares better that way, anyway.  Overall, a huge hit.

I made these last night for our Thanksgiving dinner.  They weren't as hard to shape as a I thought they would be.  The hardest part was spreading the peanut butter.  Overall, cute idea and the kids loved them!
