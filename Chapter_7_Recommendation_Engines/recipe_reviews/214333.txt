This has to be the simplest, most deliciously easy cheesecake I have ever made in my life. I like to think I am a purist when it comes to baking and if it doesnt take half a day to make; well then in my opinion, it isnt homemade. I humbly admit that I was wrong. If you're ever in a situation where you need dessert fast then this is the cheesecake for you. Or if you're craving something sweet in hurry (and Ladies, you may know what Im talking about) this is the one. Enjoy! I know I am.....:-)

Absolutely delicious!!! but the taste does come at a nutritional price.   I found and used "Graham Cracker Crust I" by Carol since I didn't have a pre-made crust on hand.   I gave a 4/5 stars because of the confusion I had in the first step about where to put the instant coffee mix. Also I wasn't sure of the purpose of placing some of the coffee mixture on the bottom of the crust.
