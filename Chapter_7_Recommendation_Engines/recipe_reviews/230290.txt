Absolutely loved it.  Will make it again and again.  Served the cookies with peppermint ice cream and my friends are still raving about it.  There are two small things I would modify when I make this recipe the next time:  #1 -  I will add 1 more tsp of peppermint extract (I want more flavor in the cookies) and #2 - I will place only six cookies on each baking sheet.  They really spread out quite wide and I didn't leave enough space between them.  Otherwise, they're simply exquisite!  Buttery, crispy, gorgeous looking.  A winner!

Fabulous Christmas cookie and very easy to make. I have a double oven. In one oven I used my regular cookie sheet, in the other oven I used my Pampered Chef baking stone. The cookies on the stone took longer and did not spread out like the others. Next time I will only use my cookie sheets. I was also nervous about flattening them too much. After making the first batch I really pressed them down and they turned out better. I also tried to make the edges uniform after I pressed down first batch. They look nicer in their natural shape. Lastly, I overcooked a batch because I thought they would look more golden when they were done so I left them a little longer. They were still fine but a little harder than I think they should be. I love these pretty buttery minty cookies! These are a must bake at Christmas time. Thanks Island Girl!

I tried this recipe today after finding some leftover peppermint candy from the Holidays. I was a little skeptical about the oatmeal/peppermint combo but they are delicious! Definitely will make these again (many times I think!)  Thanks for sharing.

This is a delightful recipe that has a good but not overpowering peppermint taste! I rolled the dough into balls and then flattened them with the palm of my hand. The cookies were done after 10 minutes and were removed easily from a parchment paper lined sheet. The powder sugar/crushed candy mix dusted on top makes this cookie, so don't be shy! It is a very light, crispy cookie that I would definitely make again.

Here's a new cookie for your Christmas cookie plate!  These turned out very nicely!  I made half a batch of these, fitting 12 cookies easily onto each baking sheet with parchment and baking for 12 minutes.  I got 23 cookies using a small cookie scoop.  These are very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

I really loved these cookies. It alarmed me though when I first starting preping them that there's so much butter, I will cut back the butter by 1/2 & I think maybe get the same results. These are really yummy though, I made some to give to the leasing office tomarrow for Christmas Eve, I ate 8 to myself when they came out the oven. You dont need to keep them 3 inches apart though, 1 inch is enough room. There's no baking powder or soda they dont rise, they stay the same size as you plop them on there. I did 1 cup white flour & 1/4 cup wheat flour to make them healthier & no one can tell :-) Wonderful Christmas cookie I will make these years to come I love them.

My cookies did not look like those in the picture but did taste good. After I had the first batch in the oven I saw that I had a partial package of mini chocolate chips on the counter and added those to the rest of the batter, made a great addition.

Wonderful cookies that are simple to make!  Followed the directions exactly.  The oatmeal and peppermint are a great combination.  They also look like they came from a bakery!

Did not spread out and oats were hard.  I used KerrGold butter.

So easy and so good!! These are very light and crisp with a minty, buttery taste that makes you want to keep going back for more. I did as others suggested and used a full tablespoon of peppermint extract and also used Kerrygold butter. AMAZING! Everyone loved them

Away from my own kitchen and recipe box, I picked this recipe for its similarities.  My recipe is rolled and cut so I tried a test cookie from this dough, did not work well, spread unevenly baked at 325F fan.  Next I tried another test cookie, using a cookie baller and pressing the balls with a glass dusted in powdered sugar then baked 325F.  This was a better method for this cookie but still not an even bake.  I'm an experienced baker, always use quality ingredients and rarely have what I would call a disaster, this recipe is a disaster.

These delicate cookies are a megahit!  Not only are they a festive way to celebrate the season, but they are packed with peppermint goodness.  I did take a hint from another baker to add 1 extra teaspoon of peppermint extract which made them 'just right.'  ENJOY!

I used 1 Tablespoon of the Peppermint  extract and 1/2 cup of the crushed peppermints for added flavor. These are a big hit with friends and family! Thank you.

I will make this recipe again, it was a hit. The flavor was tasty and the recipe was easy. I dipped the bottom of some of my cookies in chocolate and these went first. Also the recipe mentions using a teaspoon (does not say rounded) of dough and making about 36 servings. I used a teaspoon of dough  and got more then double this amount maybe even triple, so either use a very heaping teaspoon if you want this amount or even use a tablespoon, or like me have lots of small cookies. The texture of these cookies was not what I expected they seemed to be both crisp and chewy, this is because the oatmeal yields a chewiness but the dough would be crisp without this. Also mine did not seem to brown on the edges until a couple min more then the higher time given in the recipe. I cooked mine on parchment paper and they came off easily that way.

I really liked these cookies and they were easy to make. The only change that I made was to bake on parchment paper. I learned the hard way that these cookies will stick to an un-greased cookie sheet

This cookie was not what I expected. It doesn't have a very good flavor or texture.  I will not try them again.  The candy canes are tacky after they are baked and make it difficult to eat.  The cookie is not sweet like you might think.  My grandchildren took one bite and threw them away.
