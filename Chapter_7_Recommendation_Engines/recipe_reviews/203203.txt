EDIT- You can reduce to 1 egg - I was doubling this recipe from my original to serve more people but realized the 2 eggs is probably a bit much - would be fine with 1 for those having trouble making balls out of them. It's hard in the beginning but they result in a moist meatball. :)Also, you can add more breadcrumbs to balance out the moistness if you are having trouble. AND I just noticed in the directions/ingredients, that oil is added to the mixture - I don't add any oil to this mixture - I only spray the baking sheet with oil. :S

So delicious! I subbed laughing cow garlic and herb for the cream cheese, olive oil for the veggie oil and added slightly more bread crumbs and they came out fanastic! The chicken mixture is very sticky as others have said so I used 2 soons to get it to the baking sheet. A little tip: if your meat balls are all wonky looking just spray your hands with a little cooking spray and reshape once they are on the baking sheet. Works like a charm!

I will start by saying that, without a doubt, this recipe surprised me the  most of any in months!  This is a good thing.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like I expected them to be bad, but I've never made anything with ground chicken, and I've heard a lot of negative things about using it.  But, I followed the recipe as written, using  very soft cream cheese, olive oil for the oil and fresh herbs.  I MIGHT have added a bit more bread crumbs, but I can't say for sure.  I did use my 1/8 cup scoop because I only have the use of one hand, currently, so I got about 30 meatballs out of the recipe. :)  After mentioning an idea, and getting some feedback in the RE, I decided to try to create a complimentary sauce to serve these with pasta, so I made a sage/cream sauce and tossed it with penne rigate.  SO GOOD! :)  Thank you, Raquel, for the opportunity to branch out, and mis7up for the "name game" which made me make these, sooner rather than later. :)

I think these are great. The recipe submitter suggests using only 1 egg; AR won't let you modify a published recipe, so she can't "fix" it, and so it is up to the reader to read the top reviews (she's #1). Using only one egg eliminates most of the stickiness issue. Beyond that, this is just what ground chicken IS -- it's soft and squishy and no amount of stuff added in is going to make it into ground beef texture, so don't try, or you'll wind up with dry meatballs -- or gross breadcrumb-flavored meatballs. I reduced the salt in this recipe by half and thought it was delicious. I made no other changes but next time I might try fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, just because. Thanks for the recipe, Raquel! (P.S. Use a cookie scoop, one with a trigger release, to form any meatballs but especially chicken and turkey ones!)

I was starving when I made this, so I made one chicken patty along with the meatballs and ate the patty first with a piece of colby jack cheese melted on top and saved the meatballs for dinner.  I have found my new chicken burger recipe.  As some viewers mentioned, the meatballs had a strong garlic taste but I did not notice this as much in the patty.  Served the meatballs later with spaghetti sauce.  Yummy thanks.

Great meatballs!  The cream cheese kept them from drying out and I did have to use a lot more breadcrumbs though to hold them together better.  Instead of Italian seasoning I used fresh rosemary, oregano, parsley and thyme.   I served them with some creamy sage pasta and sauce!  We loved them!

I made these meatballs as directed (except for using regular cream cheese) and thought the Italian seasoning was a little strong and that the red pepper flakes were a little much.  Next time I'd decrease both by at least half.  I used an ice cream scoop to portion out my meatballs - I didn't fill it all the way so they came out a little wonky, but it kept my hands clean :)

This was fantastic!  I really had my doubts and everything was yummy.  I followed the recipie almost to the letter. I didn't have the Garlic cream cheese on hand so I used regular cream cheese.  It still had lots of flavor and kids loved it!  Thanks

Very good but on the spicy side.  Next time I would decrease the crushed pepper by 1/2.  I used a small ice cream scoop to form the meatballs - very easy.

My family scarfed these up like manics...all but my youngest. She just doesn't like meatballs of any kind, but I still try anyway. I read the edit from the submitter and I omitted the 2nd egg PER-batch. I did make a double batch though and it had only a total of 2 eggs in it, but since I didn't realize until I was making it. I had 1 package of ground chicken and 1 of ground turkey. So I used them both. I wasn't sure about the garlic cream cheese and found "Alouette Garlic & Herb spreadable soft cheese" Which is my favorite spread. I'm assuming that was it..(because it worked) I also had to increase in the doubled batch on the bread crumbs by a 1 1/2 tbsp more. I changed the red pepper flakes to powder(per my kids). I also used olive oil in place of the vegetable and when I doubled the batch I only used a total of 2 tbsp and not 3 that would have been called for. I used a food processor to mix all my ingredients well and then scooped out the mixture with a Wilton cookie dough baller. And it made roughly 53 meatballs. They baked beautifully but I can see taking the meatballs and halving each one into smaller bite size the next go around. The recipe was totally awesome. The kids were popping then into their mouths and then eating the alfredo sauce and noodles on the side. It was a complete success and the family left only a few for someone to have 1 plate for lunch. Totally will make again. Thank you!!!

So good! Didn't have any garlic cream chesse, so just used the regular.  My husband agreed that it would be fabulous over a creamy pasta!  Highly recommended.

These were fabulous! They were really garlicky though (and I love garlic) and I used plain cream cheese. I am sure they would be way too garlicky with the garlic cream cheese. I made a double batch and froze the meatballs on a cookie sheet, then transferred the balls to ziploc bags. I put enough in each bag for one meal for the 3 of us. Baked them for about 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees from frozen and they were perfect! (I did check the internal temp- very important to get correct) Great recipe!

I use with making any kind of meatballs: wear surgical gloves. You can buy them by the box at any store; Walgreens, Walmart, where ever. They are cheap, so you can go through em like nothing. And they keep your hands clean & neat up. Makes handling the meatballs much easier too I've noticed.

I have made these twice now. I serve them with homemade alfredo sauce on top of pasta. I had to double the recipe the second time. Never any leftovers!

Phenomenal! I was skeptical but I couldn't ignore the positive reviews, and I'm so glad I didn't! I used ground turkey instead of chicken since it was easier to find.   It pairs well with a simple rice pilaf (think homemade rice-a-roni). My only complaint is that they were too good and we didn't have any leftovers so next time I will double the recipe! One other tip, I like meatballs to have a slightly browned appearance so I cooked these under the broiler for the last 5-7 minutes. They were still perfectly cooked and looked "pretty" too. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't read the "edit" of the recipe until after I started, so I added the 2 eggs it called for.  This, of course, made the mixture too sticky to make into balls.  I turned it into a loaf pan and made meatloaf instead.  It's very good.

These were really, really good and something different to have for dinner.  I used 1 egg, and probably ~1/4 c. of bread crumbs (didn't measure, just kept adding until it was the right consistency to form a ball.  I also cut the crushed red pepper in half, and it was still a bit spicy for my 6 year old.  I served it with Alfredo sauce and noodles (drizzling a bit of the Alfredo sauce over the meatballs) and they were a hit.  Will definitely be making again!  Thanks for sharing.

I'd give it 4-1/2 stars if I could.  Very good, but not super fabulous - a bit too much garlicky flavor and they were pretty "hot", but I love hot stuff so it was fine for me, hubby thought it was just a tad too much, though he ate them and said he'd them again. At first when I told him what I was making he wasn't too sure about chicken meatballs.   I wasn't real sure what to serve these with or how to serve them.  I finally just made "kicked up" mashed potatoes and steamed some fresh green beans in chicken broth.  It made for a very tasty meal.

this was wonderful!  I used turkey instead of chicken and it worked really well.  Next time I would use less garlic powder because it was kind of over powering.  If you don't like the red peper flakes you could use less and still get a great flavor.  I'll do this again for sure!  Made pasta with alfredo as a side dish!  YUMMY

This was my first time cooking with ground chicken. Overall we were pleased and it was all eaten. I couldn't find the garlic cream cheese so I subbed laughing cow garlic and herb cheese. I also used one egg and cut the red pepper flakes in 1/2 since my 2yr old would be eating this with us. I used my cookie scoop to form the meatball and I had no problem with them holding together. It was a nice change of pace and I might make it again if I was to buy more ground chicken. I served with Brazilian White Rice and Alfredo for dipping sauce.

This recipe was pretty good.  I substituted shredded cheddar cheese for the parmesan cheese and added some green onion that I was looking to get rid of.  They weren't the best, but there weren't any left either, so I think it's safe to say everyone enjoyed them.

These were amazing.  I used laughing cow garlic and herb cheese instead of the cream cheese.  I also used 1/4 cup of egg substitute in place of the eggs.  I skipped the pepper flakes and used smoked paprika instead.   I also rolled the meatballs in half of the cheese after scooping them out with my ice cream scoop.  Yummy!!

My hubby was quite skeptical when I told him what was for dinner but he LOVED them as did my 10 yr old.  I made some changes based on the reviews of others and my own personal preferences.  I used 2 lbs of ground chicken.  I eliminated the garlic powder and Italian seasoning and added a tsp of dried basil instead.  I replaced the garlic light cream cheese with one container of Philadelphia Savory Garlic cream cheese and used Romano cheese instead of parmesan.  It definitely needed more bread crumbs than it called for and I just sprinkled them in bit by bit until I got a consistency I could work with.  If I had to guess I would say I ended up using around a ½ C.  One reviewer recommended using food prep gloves to help form the meatballs as ground chicken is very sticky and that person is BRILLIANT!  The gloves worked well and when they got a bit sticky I had my 10 yr old on standby with cooking spray to spray my gloves.  I would definitely make this again.  I served this with Orzo with Parmesan (again I used Romano) and Basil recipe on this site and roasted cauliflower.  I also made the basil cream sauce recipe from this site and it was delicious over the meatballs.   This was my first foray into cooking with ground chicken and I was not disappointed.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are great, I was surprised by how flavorful they were. Next time I will use less pepper flakes. Used 1 egg as someone suggested and they turned out fine. Preparation is a bit messy but the result is well worth it.

Great recipe!  I took some suggestions from other reviewers and only used 1 egg and didn't add any oil.  I also used saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs and I used plain cream cheese.  It was very sticky, so I just spooned it onto the baking sheet.  Don't add more of anything to make it less sticky.  It will come out too dry then.  Turned out delicious.  Thank you for the recipe!

Unfortunately, I did not read any reviews before making these, so did not see the submitters suggestion in her review to use only one egg. I found using the two eggs as written made the mixture so moist it was impossible to form meatballs, so I had to add considerably more bread crumbs which ended up making them on the dry side. I left out the pepper flakes and used only half the garlic. We enjoyed the flavor and I would make these again using only one egg.

The first time I made these, they were awesome, but I altered it slightly to the ingredients I had on hand: I used turkey, paprika, italian seasoning mix, oregano, minced garlic, minced onions, bread crumbs,  dash of pepper flakes, dash of olive oil, *yellow raisins*, *1 egg*, *no salt* and *no cream cheese*.   I starred these last few items b/c I feel they made  HUGE difference. The cream cheese is simply not necessary (and will keep it from getting sticky), 1 egg and a dash of olive oil is all you need, and the yellow raisins make a great sweet/savory contrast with the cheese and turkey. I rarely add salt when I cook, especially things like meat, because turkey is salty enough on its own and the "flavor" salt adds can generally be achieved with other spices.

Had these with Keni's creamy sage penne rigate, and they were absolutely delicious. Very moist and tender, with just enough of a "crust" on the outside.

This was a great recipe!! I didn't follow it to a T but I used it as a base. Here are the modifications I made. I used 1 egg, olive oil in place of vegetable, instead of 1 TBSP garlic powder I only used 1 tsp garlic powder and added about 4 gloves of fresh garlic (grated). I also used plain low fat cream cheese, because I couldn't find the garlic roasted one. And instead of Italian seasoning (because I didn't have any) I used fresh basil (about 2 tsp), 1/2 tsp dried parsley, and 1/2 tsp dried oregano. I got about 12 meatball from this because I made them pretty big, and I stuffed fresh mozzarella cheese in 1/2 of them. I also used an ice cream scoop and a spoon to form the balls - to keep hands clean and get them rounded pretty good!. I baked them on 425 for about 25 minutes (my fire alarm usually goes off if my oven is over 400 so I'm surprised I was able to get it to 425). Then I threw them in my pot of marinara sauce for about 10 minutes. They were amazing! Definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing!

My husband was surprised at how much he liked these, and my four year old gobbled them up and asked for more. I used ground turkey, and since I only had plain cream cheese I upped the garlic powder. I served them with penne, a balsamic cream sauce and broccoli (though asparagus would have been awesome), but they also taste really good with marinara.

These were really good.  One caution - 1 t of crushed red pepper flakes makes these pretty spicy if you have younger children (or a wimpy husband).  My kids liked them, but did comment that they were too spicy, so I will reduce probably by half the next time.  I also used two eggs, because I forgot that the submitter said to only use one.  They were very goopy, even with lots more bread crumbs, but still tasty.  I served over noodles and made a WW recipe for reduced calorie alfredo sauce.  So yummy and will make again.  Thanks for sharing Raquel!!!

Tasty, but way too garlicky. Did have basically a good flavor, but with a strong garlic aftertaste. Would be find with that adjusted. I only used half the amount in the recipe and that was still too much.

Made this to exact recipe except I only used one egg per other reviews.  It was PERFECT.  The red pepper flakes add just the right amount of kick to the meatballs - we will make this one again!

I saw this on the "recipe buzz" and decided to try it. I thought they were pretty good. I couldn't find the garlic cream cheese, but the store did have something called savory garlic cooking creme made with cream cheese. It did make the the mixture a little soft so I added an extra Tblsp. of bread crumbs to bind it. I used a 1 Tblsp. cookie scoop and got 23 meatballs. It worked with the scoop, but would have been too soft to form by hand. My only real changes is I don't care for pepper so I left out the black pepper and red pepper flakes. I would probably cut back the Italian seasoning if I made again for personal preference. And, add more cheese or experiment and maybe try cheddar crumbles, because I guess I would like them more cheesy. I have never made a chicken meatball before so this was really interesting to try. I can't believe I ever paid for them at the store! Thank you submitter.

I was making sausage and looking for ideas.  I saw this and decided the flavors could make an interesting chicken sausage.  I ground up 6 chicken drumsticks and using all the ingredients except the eggs made about 10 hot dog sized sausages.  They were excellent pan-fried.  Great flavors.  I will use this recipe again, maybe even tweak it for a ravioli filling.  :)

I didn't know what to expect with this recipe but I'm so glad I tried it!  The meatballs were different and delicious.  They didn't form into balls as well as I wanted but the end result was fantastic.  I served these on top of the brazilian white rice from this site and homemade cheese sauce.  YUM!

These were absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe very close, and here are the alterations that I made: 
- used 1 egg;
- used plain cream cheese;
- decreased garlic powder;
- omitted red pepper flakes since both my mom and I are not big fans of them.
Also, after I made the mixture, I put it in the freezer for about 15 min to firm up, and maybe that's why I didn't have a problem forming the meatballs. The Italian seasoning gave them a great flavor but I thought the flavor of dry herbs was a bit much... or maybe it's just my seasoning is old. I can only imagine how great these meatballs will taste with fresh herbs! Will definitely make them again.

All I had was ground chicken breast which made for an ooey gooey mixture.  There's no way I could have made the meat balls by hand or I would have been wearing most of them as meat gloves.  So I used a small ice cream scoop and it worked great.  I used Laughing Cow light garlic and herb as other reviewers suggested, cut back on the crushed red pepper to protect DH's sensitive palate, and used 1/2 tsp of dried thyme and a tsp each of oregano and basil instead of Italian seasoning.  The meat balls cooked in only 15 minutes and were completely done.  Twelve or thirteen minutes would probably have done the trick (because of the ground breast).  I served these in a mushroom cream sauce from Eating Well with some orzo on the side and dinner was wonderful!  Thanks so much for the post, Raquel!

My family really liked these.  I changed the recipe (i.e. one egg, more bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, no Italian seasoning...it was in the crumbs, no garlic powder or salt...it was in the cream cheese).  The flavor was excellent.  TIP:  the mixture is sticky!  So I shaped the mixture into a rectangle and used an oiled knife to cut it into 20 pieces.  It was then easy to pick up each section and give it a little shape.  This on goes into my rotation!

Excellent meatballs! Didn't do much differently, except to use just one egg, plain cream cheese and about half the amount of red pepper (and they were plenty spicy for me!) Judging from the recipe photos, the cream cheese should have blended in more. I had globs of it here and there in the meatballs, which tasted good but I think next time I would microwave the cream cheese a bit to get it to blend in easier.

Can you say YUMMY! These are so delicious. I served these with an Alfredo sauce, but no sauce is needed, really. I used an ice cream type scoop to portion these out so it was super-easy with the mixture being so sticky.  I made extra and put some of the mix into the fridge and baked them up a few days later. It was much easier using the cold mixture, but it is still workable even sticky :-) Kids loved it, hubby loved it. This is a keeper. Oh, I found the red pepper flakes a tad too hot for our liking, but not overwhelmingly so. I think next time I'll just leave them out. I also don't use powdered garlic (hubby gets indigestion) but did use 3 cloves of fresh pressed garlic. Enjoy!

This was so good.  The only thing I did differently was to make a meatloaf out of the mixture.  Since so many reviewers sad it was difficult to form meatballs out of the sticky mixture, I thought it best to plop the chicken into a small loaf pan.  It turned out great.  I baked it at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  We ate it plain with mashed potatoes and corn.  Next time I will try it with a marinara sauce and pasta.  Thanks so much!!

I was really excited about a healthier verson of a sausage ball, but these just didn't deliver.  I used homemade bisquick to help with the consistency, because as is, they wouldn't form good balls.  I even added some shredded cheese to the mix, they just lacked flavor.  Served with homemade ranch from this site, it stole the show.

My family loved these, but I did change things a bit.  It desperately needed more bread crumbs, so I added about a half cup of fresh bread crumbs and instead of Italian seasoning, I used about 2 teaspoons of Grill Mates seasoning for chicken.  I like the cream cheese addition.  Good stuff!  For a less sticky meatball, simply refrigerate overnight.  I baked some leftovers the next day and noticed quite a difference.  Will definitely make again.

oh where to begin. The basic ideas and ingredients are good. The execution...not so much. I didn't have garlic cream cheese so used plain with a clove of garlic. So far so good. 1 tsp red pepper flakes is too much/heat overpowers the chicken. Cut back to 1/4 tsp. 1 Tb of galic powder on top of the garlic cream cheese is waaay too much. Cut back to 1 tsp. And I LIKE garlic! I have no idea why the oil is in there. Chicken is dry and needs moisture...but there is already the cream cheese in there and the mix is already way too wet to hold together without it...so I left it out. Cutting the 2 eggs down to 1 would help it being sooo wet. 1 tsp of salt for 1 lb of chicken is too much sodium/ used 1/2 tsp. As I said, this is so wet there is no way a ball holds together. Increased the 1 TB of panko crumbs to 1/2 cup.
*I did actually use the oil after all....to brown the meatballs in the pan...not to put in the mix. In the end I really did like these and they are keepers. Just took a lot of changes to get there.

Not a fan. Omitted the oil and used only one egg. Still too wet to form a good meatball so had to add more breadcrumbs to even handle the mixture but this just made them mealy and mushy. We couldn't eat them. Gave them to the neighbors dog who loved them! Quite an expensive dog treat though, lol! Sorry, but these were just not good to us at all!

As originally presented the recipe was way to mushy.  I had to compensate for the extra egg with added panko crumbs.  Worked well.  Also do not like to pay the extra for flavored cream cheese, just upped the garlic powder and that worked well.  May cut back on the oil next time to see how that works out.

I thought these were delicious. I used ground turkey and mizithra cheese as well as parmesan. I had to add a few more breadcrumbs and refridgerate to stiffen meat up for meatballs. They were tender and very flavorful.

Sorry. I have never given a poor review before, so I'm not just a critic. I think they needed a LOT more bread crumbs - they were flat, salty meaty blobs.

Very tasty! My husband is picky on the way his chicken is prepared, but he even ate these leftover the next day! I don't think he knows they are chicken! I fixed them with rice the first time. I may try them with an italian side next time! Will make again! Yummy and easy!

Super easy to make!  However, more spicy than cheesy.  I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and used more than needed.  I guess my ground chicken was too moist.  Will recommend this over and over again!

Very happy that I tried this! I used ground turkey and served it with fettuccine noodles and light alfredo sauce, and we liked it a lot. We also thought it would be good over mashed potatoes and chicken gravy. Next time I'll use just a tad less red pepper and make with ground chicken. Tasty...inexpensive satisfying meal. Thanks!

I didn't expect this to be so spicy! I'm not a wimp about spice - but I when I do meatballs, I prefer them more Italian style with less kick. But don't get me wrong they were very good and an incredible healthier option. I only used one egg per everyone's instructions and it worked out well. I wouldn't bake them in the oven at that high heat for that long again - they dried out a bit. I will add fresh garlic next time. Overall I got good reviews from my Dad and husband, so I will make them again with a few tweaks.

great meatballs. I made 10 larger and used for meatball grinders. I used turkey and increased bread crumbs and they held together great.

This recipe was disappointing to me.  I just didn't like the combined flavors but my husband loved it.  I used two eggs with a little extra bread crumbs and left out the oil, which I'm glad I did.  The meatballs came out very moist and held together well without the extra oily taste.

These were great - I had no problems mixing or rolling these into balls. I forgot mine in the oven for a little while - it dried out te balls a bit it left a nice crisp pn the outside, which reminded me of when you fry a meatball.  I normally hate chicken, but I thought the flavors of the cream cheese and pepper couvered the foul taste of the chicken, and I hate beef more than chicken, so these will be my new go-to meatballs!

This should be called nuggets of goodness!  I did improvise with onion powder instead of garlic powder and added more crushed red pepper.  I also used ground turkey (white meat lean) Perdue brand.  I am really surprised at the levels of flavor here....

These were SO GOOD!  I only added one egg based on other reviews and I also added probably close to 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs (used panko).  I had to season my own cream cheese with some herb/garlic seasoning as I only had plain light cream cheese.  They were full of flavour, loved them...my middle son (6) found them a little spicy so wouldn't eat them, but my 8 year old enjoyed them!  So, for any that might be feeding these to younger ones, maybe watch the red pepper flakes!  Fantastic meatballs...I love them just the way they are!

I made exactly like the recipe said. I used alouette garlic and herb cheese spread.  You can't roll these meatballs because they are so moist. You just lay out round blobs on a cookie sheet.  They are still fabulous. I would not add more breadcrumb ,this would just dry them out. Don't expect pertect looking meatballs.

These meatballs are delicious! I would make 1 change, however. Instead of 2 eggs, 1 egg would suffice. My mixture had an excess of liquid, which made me add more bread crumbs in order to bring it all together nicely. Also, I couldn't find the garlic cream cheese in store, so I used jalapeño cream cheese instead.  A yummy hit!

Hosting a grain free baby shower and thought I'd try these out to stay in the healthy zone.  Substituted almond flour for the bread crumbs and since I didn't read the reviews used two eggs which made things gloppy.  Added about 2 more Tbsps almond flour and used my cookie scoop with spring mechanism which worked great.  Made 35 smalls balls, baked 15mins.  Used Laughing Cow Swiss since didn't have cream cheese.  Served with homemade barbecue sauce.  Excellent.  By themselves the seasoning seemed a bit strong, but with the sauce it was fine.

I tried it using all the most popular suggestions. They came out dry with one egg and 1 Tbl of bread crumbs and too browned on the bottom. Recommend dropping the heat to 350F. Probably does need a bit of fat (oil) in mixture to keep it moist. I omitted it. Will be fine with a sauce of some kind over it. This recipe really wants to be good but it takes so much work to get it right. How can you go wrong with the garlic cream cheese and Parm cheese but the texture and flavor didn't cut it for our family. Might skip the mammals and next time try this basic recipe over a white fish broiled with a splash of lemon.

Absolutely delicious!  I got this recipe as an email (Daily Recipe).  I was drawn to it because of the health aspect (I lost 20 lbs. last year and have resolved to keep it off and keep my family healthy), looked at the ingredients and knew I had to try this.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I couldn't find Roasted Garlic Cream Light Cream cheese at my grocery store.  I also only used 1 egg, only because that was all I had...one lone egg.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 4 wedges of The Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb Light.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Wow....these were so moist and flavorful...served these with a homemade Marinara sauce.  My family DEVOURED these.  I could only get about 16 meatballs out of the recipe as written because we like our meatballs a little bigger.  (I use these as a meal, not as an add on to say, a pasta dish).  So, I actually made them again 2 days later and this time I doubled the recipe.  Fantastic!  I love that you can dial back on the pepper flakes if you have someone (like small children) who can't take the spice.  This family LOVES spicy food, so the amount written in the recipe was perfect for us.  I took this to work the next day for lunch...omg, such a good lunch.  I think this would be fantastic with ground Turkey too.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  Will be in my regular rotation.  Really, really yummy!!!  :)

Great Flavor, I double the recipe and shouldn't have doubled the egg and found them to be quick goopy. I was still able to ball them and put them in the oven but they flattened out rather than stayed round - I'm thining this was my fault and not the recipes. I think this would be fabulous if made into patties for Chicken Burgers as the flavor was great!

Just a little to dry for me.  I followed the recipes as written.  Major bummer.  I was looking forward to adding these to my regular dinners because of the low carbs, but I didn't love it enough to try them again.  Sorry.

These turned out great, and you can take plenty of liberties with the recipe and still get outstanding results. Nicely done! Thanks for sharing!

These were very good. I used fresh bread crumbs rather than dry. And I don't trust store bought ground poultry so I ground up chicken breasts. I make these and freeze them so that I can use them in a variety of ways. I keep them small so that they can be used in soups also.

Wish I could give this recipe a 3.5, so I rounded up.  It's good and easy to make.  I added it to a vegetable minestrone soup.  The only problem is TOO MUCH GARLIC.  If I ever make these again I will likely omit all of the garlic powder.  The garlic cream cheese (I actually used Philadelphia Cooking Creme in savory garlic flavor) was plenty garlicky.  The garlic powder was overkill.

These were outstandingly delicious.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks.  btw, I couldn't find ground chicken and didn't have time to wait for the butcher so I made them with ground turkey instead.  Very tasty.

The first review by the author tells you not to add oil and comments on the egg.  These are awesome.  I doubled it and used only 2 eggs.  I used half chicken half turkey because chicken can be too mushy.  I'll cut back the salt next time.  These are great as is though.  My daughter told me it was torture that she could only have one while waiting for dinner.  I don't give 5 stars to many things on this site, but these truly are delicious.  Thank you.

We all loved these meatballs!  Even my 10 year old son couldnt stop eating them.  I couldn't find the garlic cream cheese so I used regular cream cheese and I only used 1 egg.  They came out moist and delicious.  They were kind of hard to shape and did look a little funny but no one seemed to care.  I made pasta and sauce and just added them on the side.  Next time I will try simmering them in the sauce a little bit after they are done cooking.

These were very good.  The whole family liked them.  I did go a little easy on the red pepper flakes, maybe used only a half a teaspoon.

Very tasty and will make again. You can definitely taste the spice in the crushed red pepper flakes. I don't mind a little bit of spice, but those who do not necessarily like much spice in their food should be aware.

Although I liked them, next time I would add a bit more cheese to make them softer, and some red pepper to give it some spice.

These are great and super easy!  I mixed everything in the food processor and then spooned them onto the baking sheet.  These were a bit heavy on Italian seasoning for our taste, but still a great recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

O M G these were so juicy & flavorful. plus crispy from baking them on a foil lined sheet! leftovers (days later) & theyre still juicy! i did use 1 egg, & heads up: the herb/garlic cheese spread is found in the gourmet cheese island in the deli section of my local ralphs. however, next time, im using regular spread ( too garlicky for my tastes). who woulda known ground chix had this in them ?

These meatballs are excellent! 
I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I used ground turkey and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Spice types/amounts were exact. That being said, for personal preference I will cut back slightly on the Italian seasoning, other then that they were not dry or bland. 
I was able to find a product by Philadelphia called "cooking creme" in the cheese section. The flavor was roasted garlic and I figured that was very close to the listed ingredient. Very flavorful. 
Hope this was helpful. Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good!   I accidently omitted the oil, and only put in 1/2 the red pepper flakes, but they weren't dry and were sooo tasty!!  I cooked them for 17 min exactly, but I think 15 would have done it.  Thanks!!!

Used much less red pepper.  Wish I had used much less salt.  Had to add quite a bit more bread crumbs.  Basic concept is great since we're on a strict NO red meat diet for health reasons.  A few adjustments was all that was needed.  Will make them again to meet our taste.

Tasty and moist.  Had to use light plain cream cheese (can't find the roasted garlic here).  Also subbed olive oil for the vegetable and cut back on the garlic powder.

These are fantastic! I followed the recipe but omited the red pepper flakes cause I had none and glad I did. I ended up using about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs just to make it easier to form and I made mini chicken burgers. It was a hit with 2 of the 3 kids, and the only reason the 3rd didn't like them to much was cause they're spicy. I will make these again but reduce the pepper and italian seasoning. It says alot when my pickiest eater wanted seconds and even have them for lunch! Thank you for the great recipe Raquel.

oh just wanted to mention though that it doesn't really taste cheesy so if your looking for cheesy these aren't it, but they're still fantastic and easy to make ahead and freeze.

Sticky mixture for sure so in the interest of time I made this as a small meatloaf instead of meatballs. I baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes per anothers suggestion which worked great.  I only used 1 egg and plain lite cream cheese (never seen a roasted garlic cc in our stores) and no added oil (simply not necessary).  Nice flavor and light texture.  I served with marinara sauce and angel hair.  I will make again next time for meatballs grinders.

Double the parmesan so you can actually roll into balls.  Bread crumbs aren't really necessary and I used regular cream cheese (I couldn't find roasted garlic CC) and instead of garlic powder, I used garlic salt which eliminated the need for salt.  I also didn't add the pepper or red pepper flakes but that's just personal taste - I don't like them.  Awesome!  I also made some alfredo sauce for dipping which my whole family loved!

Delicious! I did make a couple changes: 1 egg instead of 2, double bread crumbs, didn't use the crushed red pepper flakes, and used regular cream cheese. I made spaghetti sauce and after the meatballs were almost done, I put them in the sauce to finish cooking. Definitely a hit with my entire family!

These were easy and sooo good!  I used lean turkey because that's what I had.  Couldn't find the garlic cream cheese, so I used regular light cream cheese and added a little extra garlic powder.  These were moist and didn't need any sauce.  I will definitely make them again.  Thanks, Raquel!

These were amazing!  We're trying to eat lighter so I decided to grind my own chicken with the kitchenaid mixer.  It was so easy.  From there I had to double the recipe as I ground too much!  The store didn't have garlic cream cheese so I used sun dried tomato cream cheese instead. I substituted the crushed red pepper (I was out) with about a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Gave it a nice kick.  I also had to add about two minutes to the cooking time, making it 20 minutes in the oven.  My picky 4 year old and 1 year old loved this dish, so it is now in the rotation!

Did it with only one egg per the addendum by the creator, turned out very well for how quick and easy it was to make.

Just made this recipe with my son. Only thing I didn’t have was roasted garlic cream cheese and forgot to buy while I was at the store. I ended up using regular cream cheese instead. This recipe turned out amazing!!  my whole family gobbled them up! They also smelled amazing while in the oven. Thank you for such a yummy recipe to try!

I was super surprised by this; will definitely make it again. I didn't have an Italian seasoning, so I looked it up and made some myself.  They actually taste likes stuffing!  I would tweak a few things to add to some alfredo. HOWEVER people are under the misconception that these are healthy; they are only healthy if you chose the proper ground chicken. Otherwise they can be more fattening that burgers!

AH-mazing!!! Make it exactly as is - the batter(if that’s what you call it) is on the wetter side but that’s because they are super moist! Just plop them down into meatball sized balls and you’ll be fine. I did line my pan with the parchment paper which was a life saver. The first time I made it they were amazing but too spicy for my 3 year old so I omitted the red pepper all together the next time and they were still fantastic!! Makes great leftovers as well!

Needs more bread crumbs and spreadable cream cheese would work better than a room temperature bar, I am sure.

This was good!  Please read the very first review where she was unable to edit her recipe.  1 egg not 2 and skip the oil.  I have saved this and will make it again!  I skipped the red pepper flakes because the wife is a wimp on spicy stuff

I did not make any changes except next time I will reduce the crushed red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  The reason is it’s just a little bit spicy.  I do know you have to add additional flavoring to make ground chicken and ground turkey taste good. I will definitely make again.

Great recipe. I can't always find the roasted garlic cream cheese so I just add plain cream cheese and some minced garlic. I've made these as the meatballs added to sauce for spaghetti and meatballs. I've also made patties and created a Greek type meal with tzatziki, pita and potatoes. The other night I made small patties and made a pan gravy. I have cooked these in the oven and pan fried them simply by spraying my frying pan with cooking spray. All depends if my oven is free :)  These are so tasty. Great recipe Raquel

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a recipe, but these are so good that I had to write one.  I looked for a recipe for the pound of ground chicken breast I bought.   OMG!  What a lucky choice!  I had these made and cooked in 30 minutes.  Substituted Neufchâtel for the cream cheese in the recipe only because that's what I had.  Added a little more breadcrumbs.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  Used them for meatball subs.  So delicious!  They would be great for fast, healthy family dinner.  I am taking them to my next pot luck.  I think everyone will love them. I know I did.

Excellent results. I made these into chicken burgers. Using wet hands shape into 3.5" diameter patties. Then pan fry a few minutes each side on a lightly oiled non-stick skillet. Serve on warm burger buns and dinner is served.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe!  Great as meatballs, but even better as burgers.  I only used one egg and 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper and topped it with Muenster cheese.  DELICIOUS!!

I would give these 3.5. I thought they were pretty good as did my son. My husband not so much.  Based on other reviews I used only 1 egg, 2 TBSP of bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1  tsp of salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp of oregano, 1/4  tsp of basil and a heaping 1/4 tsp of the crushed red pepper.  I used 2 spoons to drop them onto the pan like cookie dough. Ate with a variety of sauces but think I will try them with pizza sauce and maybe some melted cheese next time.

Delicious! I skipped the additional oil and used one egg vs two. I could only find chive and onion cream cheese, and it was great! I will be making these again for sure, hopefully with a cream sauce next time.

I followed the directions exactly, just used ground turkey instead of ground chicken. They looked like meatball cookies, splat!!  It would have been ok if they taste half-way decent, but nope...  I think it's probably a good recipe, just no clue what I might have done wrong, and not brave enough to try them again...  :-(

A little spicy for the kids- next time will cut back on red pepper. I coated the pan in olive oil, and omitted oil in the meat mix. They were good, I would make again for a pretty easy dinner.

Very good recipe.  We are eating a heart smart low fat low sodium diet so I made so adjustments.  I doubled the recipe to put some into the freezer for later.  I used regular 1/3 the fat cream cheese and added 3 fresh minced garlic gloves.  I used Egg Beaters instead of whole eggs and increased the bread crumbs to make the mixture easier to work with.  I only put in half the salt and used sea salt instead of table salt.  I only cooked them for 15 minutes and the internal temp was just right...I will put these with some homemade sauce and whole wheat pasta...

This was so different than I was expecting. Of course, not your average meatball like beef, but different yet very tasty! Don't know why lots are complaining about the mess, yes, it is messy, but since the ground chicken doesn't have any fat, it washes right off, without that greasy feeling beef gives. I used whole wheat pasta and a garden marinara sauce, and it was really tasty!

I kinda don't WANT to leave a review here since I did my "own" thing BUT if it helps someone then so be it.  FIRST:  I HATE parm. cheese...that being said I left it out.  I ground my own fresh chicken breast and added the cream cheese and some salt free chicken herb mixture and fresh bread crumbs and left out the "spicy/pepper" stuff as hubby has sensitive stomach....I DID add dried, granulated garlic.  I made 2 patties for pita sammies and made meatballs with the rest.  YUMMY and this is a fabulous recipe for being creative and doing your own thing.  Ground chicken can be so very bland and IMHO needs a lots of doctoring and this recipe is fabulous....thank you for the inspiration!  OH....I didn't add veggie oil but used "cooking grade" melted coconut oil for health reasons.

Surprisingly delicious and not dried out at all! Edits to recipe: used 2 cloves minced garlic, included regular cream cheese, did not use garlic powder, added more breadcrumbs until mixture was less wet, sprinkled salt on meatballs and drizzled EVOO before baking. Served with marinara sauce and spaghetti. Would be excellent on crusty bread as a sandwich. Will try this again with one egg next time.

These meatballs were very tasty and they made for a great change of pace. I doubled the recipe and as another user suggested, I used only one egg. I used an ice-cream scoop to shape the meatballs. I realized that the meatballs were so moist that they weren't forming circular balls. I decided to add a bit more bread crumbs. The next time I make it I will opt for the odd shaped meatballs. About 5 minutes before we were going to eat I discovered that I didn't have an sauce (the italian in me wants to put sauce on everything). My husband and I both thought that the meatballs could stand alone. I wasn't surprised by my husband's response but I was by mine. I will be making these the next time I have company and it will be part of my monthly rotation.

The flavor of this recipe was great! However, I had to use about 1 cup of bread crumbs to get the meatballs to form. I would recommend cutting the egg to one and using about a half cup of bread crumbs. I will use this recipe again and again!

I made these just last night and, wow, they are delicious!  I couldn't find ground chicken so I subed ground turkey but everything else I did to a T.  I did notice a few things that weren't quite right, like the 2 eggs and the oil but they still turned out fine and moist.  then I read the first review which was Rachel's corrections and it was on par with what I am thinking of doing next time.  the red pepper flakes, I think, were a bit too overpowering but they calmed down the next day.  This is definately a keeper in my recipe book :)

These were really good and easy.  I'm glad I looked at the other reviews because I added more bread crumbs and only 1 egg.  Oh I made them with ground turkey and my husband said they tasted like regular meatballs.  They are spicy but that's good in our family

These were very good.  Even my picky kids liked them.  In fact, I will double the recipe next time since we all would have eaten more.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the eggs (I only used 1).  The submitter said that one was enough.  I found that it was sticky and I could form a meatball but not roll it into a meatball.  The end results though were very moist so it was well worth the effort.

I made these the other night as an appetizer.  They were good and everyone loved.  There was one left!  I doubled the recipe but will definetely tweek it next time. I used veggie cream cheese which I will add more next time.  I cut down one egg as others suggested and will probably cut it down more.  Way too much italian seasoning and not enough garlic flavor.  Will add more parm cheese too as I didn't taste it.  I served with homemade honey mustard dressing and it complimented them well.  Also added dried parsley but will prob use fresh next time.

Delicious!  Very spicy, tastes like sausage.  I used ground turkey, and subbed 2T of crushed rice chex instead of bread crumbs since I have a child who can't eat gluten.

Very yummy......
I couldn't find roasted garlic light cream cheese, so I used the regular cream cheese, but I used 4 glove of fresh garlic, stir fried with butter.  I didn't use oil.  Since I made double, I used 2 eggs only.  Even my husband was surprised how good it turned out.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

I made these last night and followed the recipe exactly - just doubled it.  Super easy to put together and assemble on cookie sheets - I used ice cream scoop as others have suggested.  They cooked in about 16 minutes and smelled so good!  They tasted great too!  I made a corn/rice mixture to accompany them and it was tasty, but would like to pair them with something creamier next time.  We love garlic and red pepper - so they were great for us.  Thanks for sharing!

My fiance and I loved it. I added something a little different. A long with the Parmesan, I added 1/4 of a cup of cheddar cheese. I know cheddar cheese is not Italian, but for some reason it sounded great inside these chicken meatballs. I am telling ya, superb!!!

Made with 2 triangles of Laughing Cow, one egg and minced garlic. Made into burgers and cooked on the stovetop. Wonderful flavor and will go into my burger rotation.

Wow! When I first saw this recipe I wasn't sure what to think but I thought I would give it a try, and I am so glad I did! My husband and I were SUPER impressed with these! We absolutely loved them and I will continue to make these from now on. I ate them with pasta and a home made Alfredo sauce and it was to DIE over! My husband and I kept saying how this could be a dinner at Olive Garden! I was so impressed and I recommend it to everyone! Yummy!
P.S. I used ground turkey, regular cream cheese, and omitted the red pepper flakes (I'm not that into spicy stuff)and they were still super good.

I fixed these for dinner today.  Used turkey instead of chicken, chives & onion cream cheese (could not find roasted garlic) besides garlic powder is used in the recipe, one egg, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and omitted the crushed red pepper flakes. They were perfect to form into balls.  I cooked them as directed and added them into my spaghetti sauce.  Moist and yummy.  Can't wait to make them again and will double the recipe.

I try to exactly duplicate the recipe as it is written even though I may be skeptical of the the ingredients or amount of them. The only thing I did differently was chive & onion creams cheese, couldn't find garlic. All that being said, these were the best meatballs ever!!!

These were a good alternative to beef.  We ground our own chicken, just seems healthier.  Would cut way back on the italian seasoning, it overpowered the cheesyness and add more bread crumbs.  Tasted a little bland, so would add some sauce next time.

At first I was disappointed because they were gooey and not forming into meatballs.  Then I read the reviews again and realized I missed the one where the person that posted this recipe had edited it.  So I shaped them the best I could and cooked them.  Even with the mistakes they still tasted great!  Everyone loved them.  I have such a hard time eating ground chicken and turkey, but not these.  There was a battle of who got the last one!!  I can't wait to make them again....the correct way!!

Couldn't find ground chicken, so I used turkey.  Had to half the spices, as my kids don't like hot food.  Turned out wonderful, very tasty!  Made with pasta and a cream sauce.

Loved it! Did have to change up the spice amounts slightly, but that's personal preference. You will need more breadcrumbs though in order to form the meatballs. I think I used 1/2 cup total. This is a delicious way to make healthy, tasty meatballs. My husband frowned at chicken meatballs but said they were good and he would definitely eat it again. That's high praise! LOL Thanks for posting the recipe, Raquel. Edited to add on 9/23/11 - have now made this recipe numerous times and combined the meatballs with various other dishes. So versatile and hubby still eats every bite! These are now a regular on our menu rotation. Thanks again! Edited to add on 3/30/12. Didn't have cream cheese so used marscapone. Awesome! Had it again last night and looking forward to leftovers tonight. Try making meatball subs with these with a nice alfredo sauce, YUM!

This was Very Quick, Easy & Delicious! I fed them to my boys, 7 & 4, and they were a little spicy. I would definitely use 1/2tsp of Crush Red Pepper rather than 1tsp. I served them with Broccoli and Cheese,  Mash Potatoes and Chicken Gravy to pour on top both chicken and potatoes!!

Very flavorful! A little on the dry side but its still enjoyable. I used 1 egg & omitted the pepper flakes. Also, I used a small cookie scooper which made 30ish.

Currently looking for the 10 star button.  Not finding it, bummer!!!  These were excellent.  I measured nothing and in the end they were extremely runny so I added more bread crumbs, but not too many as I didn't want them dry.  They were still extremely sticky when I balled them up and put htem on the pan.  They turned out perfect.  I have more in the fridge to make today, I will add an extra egg just to make sure that they didn't dry out too much....excellent recipe!!!!

I used ground turkey instead of ground chicken.  Although they were a bit dry due to my overcooking them, the flavor was wonderful.  Didn't form into round meatballs, but did cook up nicely.  Since dry (overcooked), will be great added to pasta sauce.

We really enjoyed these. Used ground turkey instead of chicken because it was priced better. Didn't have garlic cream cheese but used plain light cream cheese instead. Didn't feel that it needed the extra garlic. My only complaint is that the mixture was too moist to roll into meatballs. I ended up adding more breadcrumbs to thicken it up. I probably used about 1/3 to 1/3 cup bread crumbs total. Had a nice kick to them. Made about 17 meatballs.

I followed the recipe as is, this is very good! The chicken was simmered in sauce after being cooked, served on rolls covered with 3 blend pizza cheese and baked until melted.  Yummy!

I made these into meatball sandwiches! I used turkey instead of chicken, used 1 egg, and made my own garlic cream cheese.

I had a little trouble with the cooking time. My thermometer never got to 165  so after 25-30 minutes I took them out. They were fully cooked and  kind of dry. next time I make these, I'll take them out at 20 minutes, cut into one to check doneness and not rely on the thermometer. I tried 2 thermometers and both wouldn't get to 165, so I know one wasn't broken.  I used ground turkey  as that what was on sale here. I do think next time I'll add more seasonings

These were wonderful. I also was not sure when I saw the recipe. I used turkey instead of chicken and served with a ratatouille type dish that I make. The mixture will seem very moist but that is the way it should be. If you add too much of the bread crumbs they will turn out dry.

Delicious! We all loved these meatballs.....I only used 1 egg cause the lean ground chix is so moist....low fat cream cheese and added garlic since I didnt have the cream cheese called for in the recipe....kept all other ingredients the same. I also fried these bad boys and served them with a country gravy. Very tasty and easy. Will make again...Thanks!

These are really good. I used turkey, only one egg and regular cream cheese. I paired it with "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" and "French Baguettes" from this site. What a wonderful meatball sub!

These were only so-so.  Didn't really like the seasoning, and the balls were impossible to form, as written.  Had to add lots more bread crumbs. They came out very crunchy on the outside, which was nice, but very dried out on the inside (probably due to all the xtra breadcrumbs).  Anyway, my four-year-old granddaughter enjoyed them, but I found them barely edible.  I won't make these again.

This was pretty good. Easy to make except that my mixture was so soft that it was near impossible to make "balls" out of it so I ended up just spooning it on to the sheet in big clumps. My chicken just seemed really soft... Next time I won't add as much red pepper flakes, and I add minced garlic to reg cream cheese.

I loved this recipe, although I did make many alterations to it. Instead I used one egg, & instead of garlic powder I used Alouette Garlic & Herbs spreadable cheese, Italian bread crumbs, and I thought maybe this recipe needed more flavor so I added oregano, onion salt, 1 Goya packet, garlic salt, and cilantro :) It made the meatballs much more scrumptious! I added them on top of homemade fettucine alfredo that I made. T’was perfection

I love these. Very easy for my first time. Not dry inside and I had no problem using substitutes. Used the 1 egg. I had no bread crumbs I used saltines and I was out of Italian seasoning so I added Cajun. Great flavor and very healthy. Hope the re-warm is as good. Served whole grain quinoa brown rice and asparagus.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I made modifications based on the comments, but I don't think the recipe would've been too disastrous had I followed it. My modifications:
1 Egg, Garlic paste (1TS) and 1/4 c. whipped cream cheese (easier to mix), 3 TBS Bread crumbs with italian seasoning on them (no additional italian seasoning), 1/2 TS Crushed red peppers
I forgot to spray the backing sheet and they did stick, so be sure to spray!

Very tasty, and super easy. 1 egg, no oil, as directed in the authors comments. I also added a teaspoon of onion powder, and served it over angel hair with a home made marinara sauce. Great for low sodium seekers without pushing hard into calories.

Mixture was waaaay too wet to form balls so I plopped it onto baking sheet like cookie dough. “Until juices run clear” is wishful thinking. My chicken “cookies” were dry despite precisely following recipe including extra egg and still adding oil. Flavor was good, so after family got over the strange looking meat blobs that I served, we agreed they tasted good. Not sure I will attempt them again.

I will be making this again. I followed the recipe as written and the chicken mixture was to gloopy to form into balls. I just make in in a loaf pan baked it for 30 mins and it turned out wonderful. My entire family asked when we could have it again.

Was skeptical about this recipe based on some of the reviews, but they came out great! I cut the recipe in half and forgot the oil, which did make them extra sticky when forming, but they were still pretty formed and tasted amazing as meatball subs :)

I will make these again!  I followed the update and added only the one egg and a bit more bread crumbs.  I liked the idea of another reviewer and added  Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb  wedges(2) instead of the cream cheese.  I added the oil this time but may omit next time around.  They were very moist and on the soft side.  I will omit oil next time and see if I prefer the consistency.  Also want to thank same reviewer for tip of spraying olive oil spray onto my hands to roll up the  meatballs.  It worked like a charm.  The meatballs were spicy in a good way.  My husband approved!!

I have made this several times. This recipe is a big hit with my family. I only use 1 egg as noted by the author. The results are always very good. I have served them with fresh sauce or prepared sauce over shaped or filled pasta.

I used spicy jalapeno flavored cream cheese instead of plain, I also did not have any Italian seasoning, so I used a garlic and herb mix I had. I actually forgot to add more salt, which honestly worked out for me otherwise I think it would have been too salty. I also used a left over crushed red pepper packet from a pizza place. I served over Mexican rice with salsa and tortillas. So not exactly as the recipe goes but my family still really enjoyed!

FABULOUS!!! I flipped the meatballs the last 2 minutes to even out the browning and use 1 egg. I will make again. Also, the smaller the better, i made 30 from the single batch.

Amazing!! Super easy to mix up. I did follow suit with others that have commented and just used 1 egg.  I substituted the vegetable oil with extra virgin olive oil and cut  down th amount to a little under  a tablespoon. Red pepper flakes does cause it to have a kick, but not overly hot. Will definitely make again & adding to my archive of recipes.

Delicious! I only had light cream cheese and went light on pepper flakes because of the family. Used Italian panko and mixed half a tablespoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of minced garlic. As edited by author, I used one egg but decided to add a teaspoon of olive oil for good fat.

After reading some of the comments, I did only use one egg, used light cream cheese (couldn't find garlic light cream cheese) did just 1 tsp of garlic powder (1tbsp would be way overpowering) 2 teaspoons of italian seasoning (should've done just one) and more breadcrumbs.  Can't tell you exactly how much more as I just sorta eyeballed it to get the mixture be not so darn sticky.  But I'd guess it was at least another 1/4 cup.  And it was still sticky.   I did also omit the pepper flakes for personal preference.
It was decent, but I really question some of the measurements of this recipe.  I'm sure I would've not have liked if I stuck to the recipe

Delicious, just a little spicy for my kids! Next time I’ll cut down/cut out the red pepper flakes but I’ll definitely be making this again soon!

loved this- a bit too much kick so reduced the red pepper flakes. Used one egg based on other reviews. I didn't have the  chive cream cheese but did have another 'flavor' I think it was garlic and herb, and they turned out great!

I made this with ground turkey - absolutely delicious. I doubled the bread crumbs and added some hot sauce. They make great meatball sandwiches as well! Thanks.

Easy to make and good recipe, but a little too much garlic for me.  Will decrease by half next time.  I used garlic & red bell pepper cream cheese and two eggs (one person suggested one egg) and it only took 18 minutes to cook.  I used an ice cream scoop as suggested by reviewer - mine is vintage from my grandmother and only made 12 meatballs, but they were large.  Will make smaller ones next time.  I then used cooked linguine noodles and alfredo three cheese sauce - added cooked meatballs to this and put into crockpot to simmer for 4 hours.

Just okay.    With all the additions they are probably not any healthier than beef or pork.   Reasonably tasty but nothing special.

Great flavor! I only used one egg and ended up adding a BUNCH of bread crumbs...mine ended up too dry...one day I'll catch on to this cooking thing! I'd probably keep one egg and maybe 1/2 cup bread crumbs.

So delicious!  I doubled the recipe. The made two changes. One was with the cream cheese.  My surrounding grocery stores didn't have garlic cream cheese  so I used herbs and spices  cream cheese and it was wonderful. The other change was not only did I bake them but I also fried some.  These meatballs were so flavorful I will be making these many more times!! My boys loved them as well.

Nice. I made as burgers and meatballs. Used cheddar cheese.  (1pound of ground chicken = 2cups)
As others suggested I only added 1egg, used regular cream cheese, halfed crushed pepper and quartered garlic. 
Can serve with pasta sauce and pasta or creamy pasta.

Everyone loved them! Made a few changes, I used 1 egg, used reg. cr. cheese and sautéed my own garlic in some of the oil already in ingredients plus a bit of butter instead of more expensive prepared cr. cheese. Will definitely make again :)

Looking to try something other than plain ol' beef meatballs this intrigued me. I couldn't find the roasted garlic cream cheese so I just made my own and used olive oil instead of vegetable. I enjoyed these.

I quite liked these.  They are super moist.....kind of hard to mix and form into a ball...but they are good.
I would suggest a tiny bit more bread crumbs...but all in all, yummy for a different treat.

I've made these many times and they're always a big hit at our house. I make a big batch the meatballs and place them on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper with a little space between each one. Allow to freeze until hard and then put them in a freezer bag. Now I can have these yummy cheesy chicken meatballs more often and in smaller amounts when it's just the boyfriend and I having dinner. I just take.whatever amount I'd like, place them in the oven as directed except at a slightly lower temp since they are frozen  and cook them roughly the same amount of time. I serve them with egg noodles and Knorr brand garlic and herb sauce mix. Yum!

This is a fantastic recipe that diversifies the use for minced meats. I substituted Boursin Herb and Garlic cheese and Panko bread crumbs. I would suggest using more than the recommended amount of bread crumbs but either way I'm sure it would turn out great.

I used plain cream cheese and minced garlic instead of garlic cream cheese and Italian-seasoned crumbs instead of plain crumbs and separate seasoning. My kids really liked these meatballs with their pasta. The only negative about this recipe is that it was really sticky and messy when forming the meatballs, even after reducing to just one egg.

These are very good, however you might  want  to reduce the amount of garlic powder. It was a little too much for my taste, but overall a very good meatball recipe.

I will cook this again but with less spice so my 1-year old can have some. I think this could also work as a patty and be dressed up with lettuce, tomato, onion and dare i say..bacon.
Overall its an easy prep with a decent result.

First off, thanks for the recipe Raquel. I tripled this recipe and sadly, there are only 3 meatballs left in the fridge. To up the flavours of the completed product, I lightly saute them in EVOO until a light brown crust forms.  I have served them alone, with my spaghetti sauce and on a meatball sandwich. These are really, really good meatballs, and a great way to use up thigh meat when it's on sale (I ground my own). I added roasted garlic to plain cream cheese and added some dried chili pepper flakes. These will became a staple in my family. We all really enjoy them....DJN

These were so flavorful and awesome!!  My husband immediately said I need to make this for dinner 3x a week!  My kids raved and wanted 2nd and a 3rd!  I double the recipe because I have a hungry husband and 3 growing boys.  I made Penne pasta with roasted garlic Alfredo topped with Parmesan cheese.  After reading the reviews the only thing I did different from the recipe was used only one egg for the doubled recipe and I eliminated the oil the submitter said she never puts in the balls.  Thank you so much for a fabulous recipe!!!

The only meatballs we eat. I've swapped up spices and use fresh ones only and low fat cream cheese and panko instead but my fave is the original w a wee bit more cheese. Superb! LOVE this recipe!

In place of the parmesan, I used Dubliner cheese.  I've never used cream cheese in a meatball recipe. But it was delicious!

Wow! So good! So much flavor packed into a little meatball. I am much of a chicken meatball person, but when a friend of mine made these for me I had to have the recipe! I did tweak it slightly though. Instead of the cream cheese I used Mozzarella (not much of a cream cheese fan) and instead of 2 eggs I used 1 like the other reviews suggest. So easy to make and absolutely delicious! This is going to be a household go-to dish!!!

I really loved these. I do have one question... When you were figuring the nutrition information, how many meatballs were in a serving?  It just says it makes 20 and then the nutrish info ... Is it per meatball?  I haven't worked with grund chicken before, so I am kind of being lazy I suppose in asking!!!  But would appreciate!!!

Awesome recipe- had some ground chicken I had to use up but didn't have everything on hand, decided to try it anyway & it even came out great with the modifications I had to make: doubled meat & spices (except italian seasoning- kept that at 1 tbsp) used two eggs, subbed crushed cheese nips for bread crumbs, added extra shredded cheese since we had no cream cheese, left
Out oil and red pepper flakes, just sprayed pans, used shredded mexican cheese in the meatballs and topped with parmesan- came out moist and flavorful- picky husband & kids loved them.

We really liked this recipe though I cut back on measurements on a couple ingredients based on other reviews. I used one egg. I used 1 tsp of garlic powder b/c I know the tbsp would of been garlic overkill for me. I used half the pepper and red pepper flakes for our tastes and it was just the right heat for us. Did not use italian seasoning b/c my bread crumbs had that in it. Also, I didn't have cream cheese so I substituted pureed cottage cheese based on substitutions info from this website. I used a scoop to dip the meatballs b/c i hate the gooey mess of forming meatballs. We enjoyed these and i'll surely make them again many times.

These didnt look or taste like meatballs to me but they were tasty and my kids ate them. I have little meatball making experience, but the consistency of these didnt allow me to roll them into shape. I kind of dropped spoonfulls like I would for cookies. I will try again and maybe change my rating to a 5.

Made this last night. I only used 1 egg, and it was plenty to keep the mixture bonded. I reduced the red pepper flakes to just a few shakes, and did not add oil to mix. It didn't need it. Used someone's tip to oil my hands to make it easier to roll the meatballs. Don't neglect to oil your sheets, they will stick, even with using non-stick foil or stoneware sheets! My 7yo son LOVED them, so did my husband. Great way to perk up ground chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using only one egg and using more breadcrumbs like other people suggested. I found it to be way too garlic-y and pepper-y. Next time I make it I'll reduce the garlic powder to 1 teaspoon, and halve the pepper and the salt.

These were great. I am like you I have gone to ground turkey and chicken over beef and most people have still not noticed it. The ones who won't eat it I just don't tell them it is chicken, works for me. Great recipe ! Thanks for sharing!! I added real garlic and left out the crushed red peppers for cayenne.

Mmmm!! These were absolutely delightful. I had make my own spice blend because apparently I was out of the required spices. The consistency of the 'balls' worried me at first because they were so goopy but... having used used the full two eggs and only a teaspoon of bread crumbs(GF)and it worked out surprisingly well. I also substituted mozzarella in for the Parmesan, and it worked. 
I'm glad to have found a delicious recipe that can easily be made organic and gluten-free. Recommended!

These taste VERY similar to sausage balls.  I only used 1 egg... only 1 was needed.  A little bland though.  Next time I will add some onion powder.  To make them taste even more like sausage balls, substitute the parmesan for cheddar and add ground sage!  Yummy!

Wow. Amazingly delicious and amazingly easy. I didn't have roasted garlic cream cheese, so I used plain cream cheese (the light variety) and substituted 1 tablespoon of minced garlic for the garlic powder. And I used 1 egg instead of 2, per the advice in these reviews. I couldn't be more pleased with how they turned out - and they've even turned my husband into a ground chicken fan. Bravo, thank you, and keep these great recipes coming!

These were pretty good.  I used a third of the red pepper flakes, but it was still pretty spicy so my kids did not eat them.

This was a good way to use ground chicken but mine turned out more like a stuffing drop biscuits, probably because following the directions left it extremely runny so I ended up adding about 1 cup fresh bread crumbs to get something to work with. 
Forget about trying to make a regular meatball with your hands, use two spoons and do the drop biscuit way. Make sure you spray your foil very well. I had to make a chicken cream soup sauce (1 can cream of chicken + 1/3 c liquid) to dip them in. 
I took others advice and only added 1 tsp garlic powder which to me, still seemed like too much. I like spicy food but 1 tsp red pepper flakes is too much. Next time I will cut that back to 1/2 tsp. I actually think they would be great in a chicken soup as dumplings!
Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I was on the hunt today for a ground chicken recipe and ran across this one. I always worry about ground chicken being dry, but this one was exceptional. I followed the recipe other than omitting the red pepper flakes (the 1 tsp of black pepper was plenty hot for us) and used a teaspoon of garlic salt, a teaspoon of garlic powder and 2 minced garlic cloves in place of the 1T of garlic powder. We also have to do everything gluten free, so I used gluten free breadcrumbs. Worked great! This will get added to my personal collection of GF recipes!

Made these little guys for a "Chicken" themed party and they were a huge hit. Added a bit of Cilantro which gave them a "fresh" taste. Instead of baking, I lightly browned them on a stove top and then let them slow cook for about 2 hours before serving. I'm sure baking would turn out just as well if I was in a pinch for time. Served them with homemade Alfredo Sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Have made these twice now...the first time I followed the recipe exactly (and really liked them!) but the second time I made a couple changes and absolutely loved them. I only used 1 egg, used plain cream cheese (because I was all out of the garlic), added some very finely chopped onion, increased the breadcrumbs to about 1/4 c, added a few splashes of ckn broth and no oil (except to spray the sheet). I served with wild rice and roasted Brussels sprouts. Delish!

Very tasty.  I would add more breadcrumbs next time as it was too wet and made the meatballs hard to roll, but it was so delicious. Making it again soon!

Fabulous recipe. This is the 2nd time I've made it and everyone absolutely loves it. I agree that putting the balls together can be sticky/tricky with the ground chicken, but do not recommend extra breadcrumbs. I think the texture/flavor is perfect as is and wouldn't want to dull it down with the extra crumbs. They were great on their own with red potatoes on the side, but next time I think I'll try them in an italian dish.

These are incredible, easy and a MUCH healthier version that ground beef meatballs! I opted out of the cream cheese and used laughing cow garlic and herb (4 wedges per 1 lb). I did not used the oil listed in the recipe. Everything else stayed the same. These have a great flavor that even my picky daughter loved. She didn't like the way they looked out of the oven but we convinced her to try them. She wants more! For those having trouble with the sticky mixture, simply put a small amount of water on your hands before putting them on the baking sheet.

I did add some sun-dried tomatoes and subbed shredded mozz for the cream cheese. Will be eating the left overs tomorrow : )

I was skeptical because the couple of other things I've made with ground chicken came out super dry, but I made these exactly as written here and they were moist and flavorful. Definitely recommend!

I made these for the 1st time for New Years Eve, they were very good. 
I try to avoid gluten so I used mashed potatoe flakes (approx 1 cup) rather than bread crumbs. I used regular cream cheese and added Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic.

I was looking for a way to use up some ground chicken, that I could also serve my 3 year old. These were moist and flavorful, and I'll definitely be making again.  My 3yo really enjoyed them too.  I did make the following substitutions.  Only used 1 egg, and cut the oil by half (I also did olive oil instead of vegetable oil).  I used regular cream cheese, since that's what I had.  To make up for that, I used minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder (I think I would do that next time too).  I used fresh basil and parsley instead of the italian seasoning.  I always like my meatballs with fresh parsley!

I ended up making this into meat loaf using individual silicone baking cups, even with the one egg used in the recipe. I guess I just did not have the patience to make the balls with the sticky consistency. I sure did like the garlic flavor throughout and the left overs are being made into meat loaf sandwiches later today.

I made this exactly as written except I made 6 chicken patties and baked them for 21 minutes and they tasted great. I might cut back on the italian seasoning next time.

I thought these were just ok.  Definitely a good base recipe.  I used the Philadelphia Savory Garlic Cooking Creme and the garlic taste wasn't overpowering (even though I love garlic), so for those who thought this had too much garlic, try the creme and you may change your mind.

These were really flavourful.  I spiced them up with red pepper flakes and I used ground turkey instead of chicken.  Make sure you grease the pan though or they stick like crazy.

I will definitely be making these again but I have to say the recipe was VERY heavy on the garlic (and I LOVE garlic)  I only put a sprinkle of garlic powder and the garlic was still too strong so I suggest omitting that.  Also, if you don't like really spicy food, half the red pepper flakes.  They were so moist when raw that I used a cookie scooper to get them on the sheet.  It actually worked out good because it was less mess.  Because I couldn't roll them they didn't look like a traditional round meatball, but who cares because they are delicious.

These are awesome. I was disappointed I didn't double the recipe because 20 wasn't enough! They were so quick to make with very minimal mess and clean up, plus they are a healthier option for a hearty, comforting meal! I'll definitely be making these often!

It was too loose for me to make meatballs. I added more breadcrumbs, and still loose. Makes an EXCELLENT MEATLOAF though.

These are very good. I used bulk chicken Italian sausage with regular bacon and scallion cream cheese. Since the sausage already had some seasoning, I cut the Italian seasoning and red pepper in half. I did not add garlic powder.

I made these w ground 99% lean ground turkey. I couldn't find ground chicken at my grocery store.  I also used baby bell garlic herb cheese.  I should start off by saying that I'm not a huge fan of ground turkey. But, I loved these.  I reduced to one egg & added a bit more garlic.  My husband loved these, too. I'm trying them in spegahatti tonight.  Flavorful, low fat goodness.

Very yummy! I made them into chicken patties intead of meatballs. I followed the recipe except I only used one egg and they were WAY to gooey to grill. I ended up using a ton of breadcrumbs to get them to firm up. I will make them again but think I will omit the oil and egg all together, there is no need for it. They were great as burgers and I plan to try them in meatball form as well.

Made these with the 1 egg as suggested, because I only had 1 lb of ground chicken. Used plain low fat cream cheese and added some garlic powder. Made my own bread crumbs and added about 1/3 cup. This was yummy! Served with fresh summer corn and cole slaw. Hubby doesn't like the idea of ground chicken, but he finished what I gave him. It will make a great lunch on a salad or in a whole wheat pita. No sauce necessary. Thanks, Rachel.

Very Good, used ground turkey and laughing cow garlic and herb spread instead since I had it on hand.  LOVED the spicy!  I mixed all together expect the oil, added it last and was able to easily roll the meat into balls.  Will make again!

At .98 cents a pack at the commissary, I grabbed a handful of ground chicken packages wondering what was I going to do with them!. 
I was happy to find this recipe and the best part, I had all ingredients except for garlic cream cheese. I substituted that for regular cream cheese and added one extra garlic to it (I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder). I also used just one egg and that was sufficient. For the italian seasoning, next time I think i will reduce it just a tad. 
Everyone in my family loved them and will certainly make them again!

This was AWESOME!!!!! A++++  I added them to some alfredo and penne pasta. Also made some garlic bread on the side. My husband loved it. He said this has to be 1 of the best meals I've ever made. WOW! I accidently used 1 tbsp of crushed red pepper instead of 1 tsp. Was only a tad bit spicy... not bad at all but next time I will use 1 tsp. Thanks for sharing this. Next time I'll make it with some tomato sauce. Love that its 1/2 the fat of ground beef.

Mmmmm!!! These are yummy!!!  I followed the directions... I did have to use Savory Garlic "cooking cream cheese" because I could not find roasted garlic light cream cheese.  I also added extra bread crumbs (for a total of 3 tablespoons).  It was very mushy to try and handle and roll up by hand so, I used an ice cream scooper and that worked very well!  They were reallllllllly yummy!!!

Yum! Everybody liked these meatballs, husband, 3 year old daughter, 10 month old son and me. I used just one egg and added a little extra bread crumbs because the mixture seemed a little wet. Came out great. I also added garlic powder to the mix because I didn't have garlic cream cheese. I will make again! Tx

VERY SPICY. I'm not sure why nobody else here mentioned it, though I guess I shouldn't be surprised with all that red pepper. It's hard to eat one without running to the fridge for a glass of milk. I think my wife ate two and called it quits. They also burned on one side, so you need to flip them over halfway through cooking.

I will try making them again, but will probably leave out the red pepper entirely, as I tasted a couple that had a lot less red pepper and were pretty good.

I made these last night for dinner for my beef-loving husband and he loved them! I used cayenne pepper instead of the crushed red pepper flakes, and poultry seasoning instead of the italian. I also couldn't find the light garlic cream cheese, so i used regular. I served it over salad for lunch and we both loved it!

These were really really good. I added more bread crumbs and used ground turkey. Had them with some pasta with alfredo sauce. Will make again.. soon.

These had great flavor and smelled amazing in the oven. They just did not have the best consistency and did not seem to bake well. Will have to play with this one!

I followed this recipe just like it was written only I took the advice of other reviewers and used one egg. It was really good but i am a wimp and I thought it was to hot. Next time I will use about half of the red pepper flakes. Other than that it was really good and easy to make!

I really liked the flavor but I pre mixed everything up and put it in the fridge for a few hours first and it was very salty, I don't recommend doing this. Next time I'll make them fresh and put them right in the oven. Very yummy though, will make this again and again

These were awesome with this yummy alfredo sauce on top of linguini and veggies.... AR's Alfredo Sauce II.  I didn't see the author's comments and added the oil into the mix but they turned out fine.  I used regular soft cream cheese, Italian style bread crumbs (since I had them on hand), cut the Italian herbs in half (since they were in the breadcrumbs already),  and refrigerated the mixture for a few hours before making them into balls.  My husband doesn't care for ground meat of any kind but he went for seconds on these and gave me the go-ahead to add this recipe to our regular rotation.  I saved some of the mixture to make Chicken burgers the next day as one user suggested.  Can't wait to try them that way, too!

I gave this four stars because the texture was good, the finished product was neither gooey with cheese nor dry, the preparation was simple and we would definitely try them again. However, I do have to say that the Italian seasoning was a bit much for us..we'll definitely cut back on that next time. I tried two grocers and found no garlic cream cheese and the Laughing Cow was too expensive for today, so I used cream cheese, fresh garlic and a bit of sea salt and some garlic pepper, onion powder, and parsley.  I liked the inclusion of the red pepper! And the suggestion to make burger patties out of them, also - we will probably give that a go, too, with some of those Sandwich Thin buns or the like. Thank you for sharing.

JHop, I served these meatballs on buns - today, I plan to use a sauce - maybe, they will be tastier. As for the oil and cream cheese, I agree with the other comment, why oil and cream cheese? Using ground chicken would have enough greae in the meat. I used turkey meat, 1 egg, regular cream cheese. decreased the oil to 1 tablespoon and eliminated the red pepper, with the other ingredients. Very moist, but just okay.

My very picky husband even liked these yummy meatballs.  We substituted ground turkey for the chicken because it was on sale and made my own garlic cream cheese.  Also no red pepper flakes for the hubby.  We make these about twice a month now.

My family loved these. Instead of chicken I used turkey....but followed the recipe other than that. Had trouble getting them to actually roll into a meatballs but they ate just fine and cooked up just right.

These were a little on the spicy side for us. I think one egg would have been plenty because they did not roll into meatballs very easily, they just plopped onto the prepared pan but did cook up well. Leftovers are going in spaghetti sauce.

They were ok.  Not horrible but I just thought the cream cheese would of added something better.
