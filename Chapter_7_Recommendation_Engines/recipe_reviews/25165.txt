Great recipe but replace the bacon drippings with warmed olive oil and the vinegar with balsamic vinegar, cut the sugar to two tablespoons and add freshly crushed garlic. Proceed with the directions.   You wont have a heavy greasy taste with the olive oil and it will be much healthier!

What a wonderful salad!  I have made it twice this week.  I did not have bacon so I sauted 1 cup of walnuts and added them to this great salad.  I found it very easy to make and a favorite with my husband!  Thanks

Good... However, I agree that it is a little too greasy.  Also, do not stir in bacon with the greens.  Add them on top.  They got "soft" when I added the dressing.

This recipe was great! I also added some fresh mushrooms. I would agree with another reviewer that you shouldn't mix the bacon in because it did get soggy, but other than that it was a real crowd pleaser.

Personally I found the white vinegar a bit too harsh so I will try white wine vinegar next time, but otherwise this was good enough to make a meal of it!!!!!

Very tasty and easy!  Although for how easy it was, I was surprised at how messy it made my kitchen!  (just a side note!)  I thought it was a tad on the sweet side, will cut out more sugar next time and then it will be a 5!  thanks!

This was very good.  I made it as shown the first time.  The second time, I changed it up a bit, and liked it even better.  Instead of green onions, I used a red onion.  (Vidalia onions were even better) I did not add the 2 eggs to the dressing.  I just couldn't do it.  I used red wine vinegar instead and used splenda instead of the sugar.  My husband and family all really loved it.  Served  with some garlic bread, and boom, dinner was done.  I'm thinking of serving this to the kids football team next week for thier pre game salad.  (I'll probably use olive oil instead of the bacon greese for the dressing though)

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! I did substitute the sugar with Splenda and used only 1/8 cup, making it even more Atkins friendly!

I am not a big salad eater.  I hate lettuce, but have found that I like romaine and spinach, so I tried this recipe.  It was very good.  I added croutons too.  I used it for a dinner party, and unfortunately, the other guests didn't like it.

I was quite skeptical about this one as I don't like wilted lettuce/spinach/greens etc. But..much to my delight, it was a rather nice texture. The taste was also very yummy and my kids loved it (and any way that gets them to eat spinach is a good thing!) My only comment was that there was excess dressing on the bottom and that made for some pieces of spinach to be drowned.

This was okay. I may have not done something right, but I followed the directions. It just seemed to be too heavy of a dressing.

Very good -- my husband and I loved it.  This salad is definately a meal in itself.  I thought the dressing got just a little too thick, so next time I will use only one egg.

Good, but for some reason did not "wow is this good" us. I think I would prefer to make the "Strawberry and Spinach" salad from this site when we want a spinach salad.

Great salad!  I omitted the two raw eggs.  I added one tablespoon of honey rather than the sugar, and used olive oil rather than bacon grease.  I added toasted walnuts and craisins.  Awesome!

This was just great. I made little substitutions (rice wine vinegar, honey, red onion) but the basic recipe is perfectly delish. I scaled it back for one & it was fine. It went in my favorites book.

I love this recipe.  Brings back lots of memories.  the green onion is really necessary.  Do not use maple bacon or it will be too sweet.  I used a 10 oz. bag of baby spinach and it was just right.  thanks.

I sauteed some chopped onions with the bacon and then mixed in the rest of the dressing ingredients. I didn't use any hard boiled eggs...don't like them....served mine with lots of sliced baby cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced red onion and croutons....AMAZING!  I am going to try this with already browned and crisped bacon pieces and add a bit of olive oil to make it a bit healthier next time.

Excellent recipe. READ Carefully. The last 2 eggs/sauce mixture is added to bacon grease on burner and simmered. I simmered for much longer than 1 minute to get the sauce right (about 3min). The sauce turns out great and eggs are cooked.

Made this last night and will again in 2 days (for company).  I really recommend reading the recipe through before starting.  The egg added raw to the bacon grease took me by surprise.  I had just read the ingred. and hard boiled them all.  Also please note that this is written for 12 servings. Making it for 4 people was tricky by doable. Next time I will add more time to the eggs for hardboiling.  Mine came out at soft boil which wasn't bad, but isn't for everyone.  Also a tip:  Use "old eggs-not as fresh" they're easier to peel.  And you shouldn't cover the eggs as directed.  By doing that it traps the sulfure and causes the egg yolk to develope the green ring around it.

This is pretty much the recipe my grandmother used when  I was a child. However she did not use eggs in the dressing. This was the only way my dad would eat spinach. By the way, my grandmother was born in 1875 and this was the way her mother made this salad.

I LOVE this salad!  My picky husband loves it, too.  We didn't use the boiled eggs on the salad, though.  Instead we added almonds and cranberries.  We are definitely going to make this again!

My husband and I enjoyed this salad.  I modified the dressing by omitting the sugar, and substituting 1/4cup lemon juice (fresh squeezed) for the red wine vinegar; I also added dashes of salt, pepper, and dried tarragon to the dressing.   There was a lot of dressing, way too much for the bag (12 oz?) of baby spinach I used, so I ended up draining the salad bowl before serving.  Nevertheless, this was delicious!

If you mix the eggs into the grease as stated you are cooking the eggs so they are ok to eat.  I cut this in half (there was only three of us) cut back on the sugar some and used apple cider vingear (always have) and it was great.  The eggs in the dressing make the dressing thick and it clinged to the spinach beautifully!

I like the bacon and eggs with the spinach.  However, I felt the dressing was lacking the sweetness necessary to offset the salt and was too greasy.  I would definitely not cut the sugar ( I used 3 Tbsp and found this not to be enough).  I think this will be better with a sweet poppyseed dressing and the adddition of some fresh mushrooms.

Use Turkey 1/2 pound of bacon ( I chopped it into little pieces and added to the oil before, be sure it cooks untill slightly crispy at least, so the olive oil absorbs the flavor)and 1/2 cup of olive oil to cook it in , instead of pork bacon.....much healthier and taste just as delicous...great alternative to those who have high cholestoral to watch out for. My kids loved it this way as well and they are not often easy to please when it comes to food.

I thought this was an excellent salad with a few changes. I completely omitted step #1...I did not add the boiled eggs. I also omitted the green onions (not my favorite). Instead I added some roasted walnuts and goat cheese. Though this is not really a healthy salad, it tasted excellent. My husband loves it.

Wonderful dressing and salad! I think I'll use less oil next time, just to save the calories, and add some water to keep the volume the same.

Pretty good.  Not my absolute favorite but I would probably make it again.  My suggestion is to follow the recipe exactly but just be careful not to add too much dressing to the spinach so it doesn't get overwhelmingly greasy.  Also, add some tomatoes or other veggie to increase the health factor.

I made this exactally as the directions stated and it was WONDERFUL. I was hoping to have some leftover to take home from our Thanksgiving meal but there wasn't any left. The only thing I did was use all white vinegar because I didn't have any red wine vinegar.

Pretty greasy.  After sitting a while (had it during Thanksgiving) you could see the fat from the bacon grease hardening and that was unattractive!  Also, some had a hard time eating it knowing there was a raw egg in it.  Will not make again.

This is the first wilted spinach salad I've tried so admittedly I have no point of reference, but I think it's really yummy. I didn't realize I was out of red wine vinegar so I subbed cooking sherry and it still came out well. I also added some leftover quinoa just because. I will make this again.

Very good side dish.  I decided to add a holiday element by using a generous handful of fresh cranberrys (cooked and reduced as if I was making sauce for Thanksgiving).  I tossed this into the spinach until coated then proceeded with the recipe as directed.  This added a slight sweet contrast with the bacon dressing.

Great recipe -works nicely with or without eggs. Try some dried cranberries (craisins work well and are convenient) to add a bit of brightness.

Whenever I think of a wilted spinach salad - this is the one I want. Very good just the way it is, but you can change the ingredients to suit your own taste, as well. Excellent recipe.

We liked it, but would prefer that the dressing be less sweet. 
  I'm Keto so I substituted 1 Tablespoon Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for the white sugar and added mushrooms but did everything else the same.  Will absolutely make again!!

This recipe is one on my 17 year old's favorite salad recipes.  I just cooked a special dinner for  him scoring well on his ACT and this was one of the recipes he requested.

I took Diane Moore's suggestion on this and it came out fantastically, and FAR less fattening:

Great recipe but replace the bacon drippings with warmed olive oil and the vinegar with balsamic vinegar, cut the sugar to two tablespoons and add freshly crushed garlic. Proceed with the directions. You wont have a heavy greasy taste with the olive oil and it will be much healthier!

Made this but changed the drippings to olive oil and cut back on the bacon.  I also used sliced sweet onion in place of green onions and cut back on the sugar slightly.

I had a dinner party and made this rather easy salad. It was a hit with my guest. No one thought the dressing was greasy. I was very careful not to use more than the recommended amount of bacon grease. I will definitely make this one again.

Followed the directions exactly right but left out the sugar. So much better without the sugar. My whole family loved this salad. Everyone from my 11 year daughter to my 50 year old husband. Plus, my 18 year old step-son doesn't like spinach, and he got seconds.

Just what I was looking for today. I left out the boiled egg, and added mushrooms and toasted walnuts. Made the dressing as suggested except for sauteing a bit of Vidala onion in the bacon grease. Looking forward to making this often.

This is one of my husband's favorites.  If you are making it as a side dish, I would recommend serving it with a very light entree because everyone will want seconds on the salad!

I just made this salad tonight and it was FABBBBBULOUS!!!!   My husband and finicky 6 yr old son even enjoyed it.   I didn't follow the directions as far as the vinegar and sugar directly.  I seasoned it to my own liking and it turned out GREAT!!!!

I will certainly make this again.

For the dressing I used white vinegar only and used half of what the recipe calls for cause I don't like the taste of vinegar too much and my family and guests loved it. I have been requested to make this dish again for family gatherings. It turned out really good and the dressing was a good sweetness. I

This was fantastic. Even my son who fusses  over anything remotely resembling a vegetable ate TWO helpings-and SPINACH no less! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Thanks Chip!
