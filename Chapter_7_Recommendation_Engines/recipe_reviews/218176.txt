The veggies can be cooked at 400 for about 30 minutes, and they'll be done.  The dressing was easy to make, and tastes great.  I served this on red leaf lettuce without the cheese.  Wonderful, colorful salad!

This recipe is delicious! I substituted balsamic vinegar for the apple cider vinegar. It went nicely with pan seared salmon and a glass of red wine.

I really liked this- no changes except that I didn't peel the beets and it didn't make any difference.  I served it over romaine lettuce.  I had never had anything like this before and I didn't know if it should be served hot or cold.  I ended up eating it at room temperature and still really liked it.  I could see it served either way.  The taste is half-way between a fresh salad and the vegetables at the bottom of the chicken roast.

First time I ever had roasted vegetables, and loved them. This has become my favorite vegetable dish.

No need to roast veg so long. 15 covered and 15 uncovered @ 450.  Added balsamic to dressing for extra kick. Love how the tea mellowed the flavor.

Made this for a couple I work .. made it as a side dish with roast chicken. Their comment... "this is better than eating at a restaurant." Enough left over the following day -- it was delicious cold too... Hot or cold -- this is a keeper.

This was fabulous and a big hit at a recent BBQ.   didn't have chipotle, so I used ground ancho power and some cayenne as a substitute.  Also didn't have apple cider vinegar so i used white champagne vinegar.  Still a wonderful dressing with the black tea.

nice recipe. My only complaint is that the dressing is far too watery, next time I would reduce the amount of tea.
