This was ok, but could have been great with one change... Marinate the tofu first for a few hours. It will soak up the sauces and be flavorful instead of bland.

My husband has never liked tofu better than this.  I froze the tofu, thawed it, drained it well and marinated it in the sauces the day before I stir fried.  We really liked it - and of course we didn't use frozen peas and carrots, but we used fresh vegis.  Yummy stuff!  Thanks; we'll eat this again.

The recipe sounded interesting, but alas, it turned out very ordinary.  Too much hoisin sauce for one thing.

This recipe was great. Use whatever vegetables you have on hand it it will turn out great!.  I added some ginger for extra flavour.  Great tasting and good for you.

Great one. 

1. I soaked the tofu cubes in soy sauce.
2. Fried also almond nuts and peanuts, along with the onion and garlic.
3. Added fresh spinach leaves and green onion to the mix (just the green part)
4. I have no Thai chilli paste, so I used a powder chilli
5. I have no hoisin sauce, skipped that
6. Instead of that, I added black pepper /the powder/ and basil :)

This recipe was only ok, not because of a bad recipe. My family and I are new vegetarians and are not yet fond of tofu. I think we should have cut the amount of tofu by half. I think we would have liked it s  alot more otherwise.

I think this recipe is fantastic for an everyday meal.  I typically scale down the amount of each ingredient a bit and exclude the black beans.  Thank you for sharing this great dish.

This was pretty good.  I've never cooked with tofu before and I had the other ingredients on hand.  However, instead of Hoisin sauce I used oyster sauce because this is what I had.  I also threw in some mushrooms I had as well.  It was really good.

Good flavour but next time I'll cut down on the amount of rice and cut out the black beans as they don't jive with Asian flare in my opinion. Would sub edamame instead.

I did marinate the tofu in a teriyaki and hoisin with some tamari.  I used mixed veggies as well. Here is the secret....use a tofu press to dry out the tofu and slice it into thin matchsticks. Very good with lots of possible variations.
