I love this recipe and make it about once a week.  The tips I have for this recipe:

1) A standard 14oz carton of tofu fits into an 8"x8" pan if the tofu is cut into 3 thin slices instead of 4.  I also cut each of the 3 slices into 8 triangles.

2) The sauce is enough to cover two things of 14oz tofu.  Either use twice as much tofu or make this sauce all at once and use half of it (and the rest later) or use the "customize this recipe" feature at the bottom of the main page to change it to 2 servings from 4.  

3) Start 2/3 to 1 dry cup of brown rice  when the tofu is draining and then make the sauce then bake this and it will all end at the same time.  

4) Brocolli.  This is soooo good with brocolli.

I make this recipe about every other week.  It is sooo good! There are a few notes to make, though.  One is that there is truly a lot of marinade.  I would definitely use two cakes of tofu with his recipe. I typically, based on what is in my house, substitute parsley for the cilantro and use a tablespoon of ketchup plus a teaspoon of liquid smoke for the dried chilies. I also find that the amount of oil is unnecessary. I use 1 tablespoon of each oil, and have excellent results.  I also flip the tofu over a bit past halfway when baking.  I usually brown these again in a dry skillet before serving.   Lastly, make this recipe, you will enjoy it!!

This is a great recipe and was described by my fussy eater sister as "funky" vegan food. I used light soy sauce and did not use any canola oil in an effort to reduce fat. I used jar minced ginger and added in a teaspoon of jarred chilli and forgot the cilantro. (still tasted great, will try with it next time)I prepared the tofu per the recipe and with no time for marinating just put it in the oven for 30 mins. 
After baking, there was plenty of sauce (I didn't take out any as suggested)I tipped the tofu and sauce in a wok with some frozen stir fry vegetable mix coooked it all together and then served it over rice. Everyone loved it. 
The aromas from cooking made everyones mouth water. This recipe is set to be a regular at our place. Thanks for the recipe Meaghan it has great asian inspired flavours.

I may never need to order out for tofu again! It takes a while but is not time-consuming. I baked them for about 40 minutes then broils them for 20. They were crisp on one side and tofu-textured on the other. I might flip them over next time, as in today, because I had enough leftover sauce to reuse it for another batch!

This was my first time having tofu.  I think this recipe is great!  I ate mine over a plate of basmati rice with cilantro and green onion on top.

This has to be my favorite recipe. I have all the omnivores in my family eating it. They love it too. I make a batch of Jasmine rice, add some fresh pineapple and pour the tofu and sauce over it. Yummy

Yum.  This reminds me of a dish that I had in a little cafe on the north shore of Kauai.  I would recommend freezing and thawing the tofu first to give it a chewier texture.  I also added a few handfuls of fresh broccoli for the last ten minutes of cooking and covered the dish.  That was really tasty, and the brocolli came out perfectly tender-crisp.  The sauce is excellent, and tastes even better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were very good but came out oily.  Next time I would leave out the canola oil altogether.  I added a little extra orange juice because I was worried they wouldn't be orangey enough.  I will definitely make them again!

This was delicious....I didn't pour off any of the marinade before baking, and then when it was done I spooned the extra over steamed broccoli and served it with jasmine rice!  It was fabulous!

Great recipe.  Less oil is def. needed.  I use 2 tblspoons olive oil and 2-3 drops of sesame oil.  Using the 4 teaspoons of sesame really, really overpowers.  I also found it best to freeze the tofu after pressing the water out.  Freezing for about an hour allows tofu to be cut into into thinner pieces without it falling apart. I followed previous advice and I bake with all the marinade, turning tofu over halfway and then either letting moisture cook to a yummy glaze, takes about 1.5 hr or I take it out after an hour and serve the marinade over rice for a full meal.   These tofu triangles also work great in curry dishes!  The baked marinade really helps the tofu keep it's form in the hot skillet full of coconut milk and curry and it adds an extra depth of flavor to the curry dish!

This tofu recipe was great.  A nice combination of flavour and heat.  I couldn't really taste the orange juice that much though.  I left it in its marinade for the full 24 hours and I didn't drain off the excess before putting it into the oven.  The extra sauce after it baked, I put over rice.  Served this with steamed broccoli.  Thanks for the healthy recipe, and I will make this again.

The flavor of the marinade was great, but it was too oily. I will definitely cut back on the oil next time. I would also recommend  marinating it overnight and baking the tofu without having liquid in the pan. It will come out firmer, which I think is better for tofu. Baking as stated in the recipe, the tofu came out too soft for my liking. I thickened the remaining marinade with cornstarch for a nice sauce to serve at the table.

This was edible but I have most of the complaints that others have listed.  Too oily; not enough orange flavor (even though I added several inches of orange peel to enhance it).  The vinegar and soy more or less took over the main flavoring.  Wasn't particularly impressed with this dish.

This is a very flavorful way to serve tofu. I left out the green onions (don't like them) and chiles. I like it using orange juice, but I sometimes substitute juice from one lime instead - yummy! Also, instead of pressing the tofu, I pre-cut them into triangles and place them in a jar overnight. This drains the excess water out of the tofu the same way as pressing it.

My husband does not like tofu but he liked this prepared without the 1/3 cup canola oil, all the marinade, broccoli added the last 10 minutes over brown rice.  My daughter did too, still waiting on my son's opinion.

These were pretty good - I wish I had used reduced sodium soy sauce, because the end result was pretty salty.  But I think that's just because I'm used to cutting back on the soy.  I marinated overnight, but instead of cooking the triangles in a puddle of marinade, I spooned a couple teaspoons over each piece.  I wasn't a huge fan of this on its own, but I diced up leftovers and added to Thai Inspired Confetti Salad and the tofu went really well with it!  So I'll make this again, but pribably to cut up and add to other dishes.

I eliminated all of the canola oil, and didn't have green onions or cilantro but other than that this recipe was very amazing! I marinated for about eight hours. and to bake the tofu, I took it completely out of the marinade and baked it on parchment paper, flipping once halfway through. I had a firm texture, with a sort of crust on the outside and softer in the middle. I thickened the marinade with some cornstarch and added red bell pepper, spinach and peas, and spooned it over brown rice and the tofu. I was a little afraid of the vinegaryness and orangeyness so I added some honey to the sauce as it was simmering. It was a very delicious meal with the changes I made!

Made this as the recipe stated and it was good!  I will make it again but with modifications.  First, make sure you have EXTRA firm tofu.  I didn't and it was a little mushy.  Also, I'd add some brown sugar to taste and cut back on the oil.  I've made tofu before and if you like more of a 'chicken nugget' texture..freeze the tofu before marinating it.  All in all...a good recipe to tinker with!

I've made this several times and it is always a hit with vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I typically marinade the tofu in a large ziplock bag over night. Doing that really soaks up the orange and ginger. This recipe is good baked, grilled or in a noodle salad cold. Delish!

This turned out fantastic.  I cut the amount of oil in half, and it was still great.  Served with a quinoa salad on spinach leaves.  This I'll definitely do again.

This was delicious and an easy tofu recipe.  My husband even liked it; we ate it with rice.  I am going to make this again this week and I will try some orange rind as suggested by another review.  Thanks.

I wish there was a little more orange flavor to this.  That being said it was very tasty and will make again.  I will probably add some orange zest next time.

Excellent on tofu, I even used some leftover marinade on sweet potatoes and it was unbelievable.  Delish!

Does not look appetizing at all, but the taste is AWESOME. I will definitely make this again, and I do recommend you try it. I didnt use sesame oil or the chipotle peppers and it was still perfect.

The orange flavor was immensely overpowering to a point that was not enjoyable.  30 minutes was perhaps too long to marinate, as tofu soaks up flavor like a sponge anyhow.  The tofu was quite soggy and mushy, even though I pressed it for over 30 minutes beforehand.  If I try this again, because the title does sound good, I will adjust the flavors and marinate 20 minutes tops, and cook it in a saute pan just barely coated with a little olive or grapeseed oil, flipping once halfway to get it golden on both sides.

I thought this was an interesting mix of flavors; I never would have thought to use orange juice in a marinade for tofu! I used other posters' idea of putting in vegetables during the last 10 minutes or so of baking (used green peppers) so that was an easy way for a complete dinner (served with steamed white rice). Next time I might use a little less rice vinegar, as it was a little sour for my taste, but otherwise a good recipe!

As other reviewers suggested, I cut back the oil significantly. This was ok but the tartness of the vinegar really overwhelmed the other ingredients. If I were to make this again i think I would add some honey to mellow out the acidity.

This was delcious! A few changes I made: 1) I didn't have any green onions, so I chopped up white onions and laid them on top of the tofu to bake. They came out great 2) I also didn't have fresh cilantro so I used a pinch of dried cilantro over each triangle. 3) While the tofu was baking, I sauteed fresh broccoli & bell papper (what I had in my fridge) in the marinade (as other reviewers have mentioned, there is a LOT left) until tender but crisp. THey were a perfect addition to the meal! I served all over brown rice with a side of Sriracha...amazing!!

These tofu triangles are delicious! I took some advice from the other reviewers and used about 2 tbsp canola oil instead of 1/3 cup. Couldn't have been better.

Very tasty marinade.  Not sure why it calls for 1/3 cup oil.  I used 1 Tbsp. instead. Makes a lot of marinade.  Next time I will make half the amount, as suggested in other reviews.

I love this recipe!  I left out the green onions, cilantro, and chipotle peppers (I didn't have any of those things), used dried ground ginger instead of fresh, and almost completely left out the canola oil, using only a drizzle (based on other reviews).

The juice dried up in the 45 minutes of bake time--next time I'll bake it in ALL of the marinade.  But the tofu turned out delicious!  I served it with stir-fried broccoli, green beans, carrots, and onions; with rice on the side of course.

I even made another batch of marinade, warmed it on the stove, and poured in a mixture of cornstarch & water to thicken it.  I served that as additional sauce for the tofu, veggies, and rice.  It was fabulous--even my husband loved the flavor! (Not so much the tofu, but that's just him.)

Too tangy for me - maybe it was the vinegar?  Didn't change anything but left all the marinade in while cooking.  Was worried it was still too "soft" for my bf so I pan fried it a little on each side after it was baked - he loved it.

Love this!  Didn't think there was too much marinade (the recipe says to pour some off before you put in the oven).  I marinaded this overnight in the fridge, and I think that really made all the difference.  Served over jasmine rice and with sesame broccoli...will definitely make this again!

this was alright... too much vinegar for my taste.  i think maybe i'd rate it higher if it called for half the amount of vinegar.  i typically like strong flavors, but for some reason this didn't do it for me.

Followed the proportions and directions and ingredients perfectly but during cooking, the orange juice became really bitter.
If I should ever make this again, I'll use little to no orange juice, making up with orange zest alone. I may broil it towards the end aswell; the texture was a little on the "mush" side.

This was very tasty. My six year old, who hadn't eaten tofu since he was one, asked me to put some in his school lunch. Next time I might trying broiling it for a few minutes at the end to give the top a crispy texture.

I wasn't overly impressed with this. I froze the tofu before-hand too. I DID forget the ginger (husband doesn't like ginger), maybe that is the magic ingredient that made everyone else rate it higher?

I made this with jasmine rice and broccoli and it was SO good!  The only change I made was in cutting up the tofu pieces into smaller triangles. Leaving them in the oven the full 45 minutes was the perfect amount of time for them to brown!  I will make this again for sure. Thanks for the great recipe!

we (me, bf, and bf's daughter) really liked this recipe.. we smoked this on the grill with jack daniels chips and made a few modifications.. as suggested by possum81 we cut the recipe in half and used it on 14 oz of tofu.. i left out the canola oil and red pepper flakes (bf's daughter doesn't like spicy).. subbed 1/2 tsp dried/powdered ginger and garlic for the fresh.. also subbed 1/2 tsp dried onion flakes for the green onion.. didn't add the chipotle (again she doesn't like spicy, but it sounds good).. bf threw the leftover marinade in some chow mein noodles, which they loved.. ty for the recipe

The sauce was heavy on the soy sauce taste and light on the orange. I wasn't a fan.

WOW!!!! Absolutely amazing!!  I made this as written with one exception-I used less oil.  I used about 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil instead of the vegetable and sesame.  I was a little skeptical when I took it out of the oven since the tofu was soft (I generally prefer my tofu with some crisp on the outside-either grilled or sautéed), but this changed my mind.  Definitely the best tofu recipe I have had by far!  This is going into our regular meal rotation.  We had baked potatoes and broccoli with it.  Mmmm!  It has some kick to it, but i thought it was the perfect amount of heat.  Make this dish!!!

i thought this was great. followed the directions exactly, using extra firm tofu, pressing, and marinating for 30 mins. the tofu came out the perfect texture, and very nicely browned on the edges. the marinade does make a lot, but personally i don't think i would cut it by half because then it wouldn't cover the top of the tofu while marinating. i'll be making this again, thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  Does make a lot like others mentioned.  Try a 9x9 and it fits cut according to recipe directions.  Kiddos really liked it.

followed recipe exactly except cut oil by half.  Still didn't like the greasy texture.  would recommend only a teaspoon.  flavor was decent but probably won't make again.

This was very good! I used orange-mango juice and half the oil. I simmered the poured-off marinade while the tofu was baking and served it over sauteed veggies, and it was delicious. After 40 min. in the oven I still had a lot of marinade in the pan and the tofu wasn't golden, so I broiled it for another 10-15 min. to get a bit of a crust. Although the tofu looked floppy when I took it out of the pan, it had a nice texture. This is a definite keeper.

These are very tasty and easy to make. I didn't drain the marinade off before I baked them because I wanted sauce for the rice. My only problem with the recipe, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, is that the marinating time should be included in the total time. I ended up not eating this on the night I planned to because I thought it would be ready in 1 hour and 25 minutes. It did taste delicious the next night, though. Thanks!

Very tasty stuff! I use Bragg's Aminos instead of soy sauce and season accordingly. Even my 'meat & potatoes" husband enjoyed this!!

This was a delicious sauce! I gave it 4 stars because that is a LOT of oil - i didn't use any of the canola oil and it was fine

Very good. Next time I would bake them with even less of the sauce than I did this time. The tofu was a bit soggy, but it tasted pretty good. Added brown rice, broccoli and shredded carrots.

This was my first time trying tofu. The recipe itself was pretty descent. The marinade was quite tasty. Personally, though, I found that it's the tofu itself I don't care much for (due to the spongy texture). Perhaps if the tofu had been crisper, I would have liked it better... ?

Delicious. We made this with cubed extra firm tofu. We didn't use any vinegar and cut down on the soy sauce, but it was still wonderful and we didn't think that we liked tofu!

This had too much orange flavor for me, and it was mushier than I expected. I won't be making it again.

My mom and I ate the entire pan of this stuff in one sitting, and my carnivore boyfriend even admitted they were darn tasty. This is a good recipe to use as an introduction to tofu.

My girldfriend and I thought this was great.  The sauce was the perfect mix of sweet and savory with the cilantro and red pepper.  We added some shitake mushrooms, but it would have been great without them.

I thought this dish was pretty good. The sauce was a little overpowering. I don't really know what you would do differently though.
