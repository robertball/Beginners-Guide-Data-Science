I used frozen dough loaves, let them rise, them rolled them out and stuffed with sausage and cheese. My guests could not get enough of these!!! I did a few varitaions, some with just cheese, some with combinations of ham, salami, pepperoni, bacon and all with cheese. I would make this for EVERY party!

This recipe was great!  Everyone loved it!  I ended up using 2 loaves of bread instead 
of only one, so it made a lot more than I thought it would!

This is very similar to a recipe I have used from time to time. I have also substituted Rhode's frozen bread dough and have put in different toppings also to change it around a bit, from taco meat and cheddar cheese, onions and olives. Also, spaghetti sauce (very sparingly) with ground beef and mozzarella cheese!

Good stuff!!  I make a double batch every time and mix up the sausage types. I replaced the pepperoni with spicy sausage (just personal preference).  Very good recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.  Sue Wasson

Wonderful, and if you do not have MSG (mono-sodium glutamate), don't worry.  It's not a NECESSARY ingredient.

Very good... I can tell I need to make some adjustments, though, if I ever make it again.

I really liked this recipe - due to a shortage of time I used pizza dough - no MSG was used - and I added spinach to the second bread very tasty and very filling.

This is great! I had only 1 pound of sausage, so there wasn't quite as much filling as the recipe calls for. And I used my own bread dough. It was delicious; everyone loved it. It was very moist with a nice crisp crust.

My entire family liked this, which is always a big success.  I didn't have a hot bread roll mix, so I made dough from scratch.  I also used less pepperoni and added a bunch of spinach.  Instead of dried onion I chopped fresh and cooked it with the sausage.  It made a lot and had no complaints, so I'll make it again!
