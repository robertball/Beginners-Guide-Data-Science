We all enjoyed these very much for our cocktail hour!  I added guava juice and they were perfect.  I'll definitely be making these again.

It was the drink of the day at my poolside July 4th party.  The drink's name was the biggest draw.

This drink was really yummy!  I agree with someone else who said to double up on the pineapple juice to take some of the strength out of the drink.  The pineapple juice masks the alcohol so it is easy to get carried away with this one!!!

This is now my signature drink. You can order this at the Venetian in Las Vegas for $9.00 or as I prefer, make up a batch in your room before going out on The Strip. YUMMY!!!

Boy, these do pack a punch!!! Course I didn't let that stop me from having 3 of them. ;o) I garnished w/ a maraschino cherry instead of an orange twist ... it sunk to the bottom of the martini glass & the grenadine floated around it, giving a "fade" effect...very pretty!

I had several friends over and we all agreed that the measurements of the rum and vodka should be switched, because it was just a tad too coconutty.  (3/4 oz rum and 1 oz vodka.)  Other than that, a great recipe and a really fun evening tweaking it to our taste.  Thanks POLKA!

This is drink is so tasty and visually appealing! I double the pineapple juice just for personal preference. It's so easy to make and was a huge hit.

It was ok, but I personally think that the combination of pineapple juice and coconut goes better with rum, rather than vodka. So, it was different than what I had expected, and probably stick to my preferred combo next time...

I really liked this drink. I didn't have any grenadine but I'm sure I would like it that way too. We ran out of pineapple juice and so we tried it with orange juice. It worked well that way too. I added quite a bit of ice to the martini shaker and then strained it out. It made the drink nice and chilled. Everyone was impressed.

Awesome tropical beverage for a Caribbean-themed wedding rehearsal dinner!   I used the calculator to adjust for 50 servings and poured these from a pitcher garnished with fruit slices.  Mai tai umbrellas were the perfect touch.  Will make again for son-in-law's May college graduation reception, though will use a punch bowl with a pretty ice ring.  Cheers!

WOW! How about 6 stars. This drink is so much fun it may, singlehandedly, bring back prohibition. As other reviewers have said, have a care, it goes down easily, but you'll soon have difficulty holding on to your inhibitions!!

These are great!!!  Went down a little too easy for most of us though!  We made them by the pitcher full and added the grenadine right before serving since it was a big group.

Enjoyed this quite a bit.  Tasty way to transition from work to play :)  Tastes like a pina coloda w/out the ice & w/ much more of a kick!  They do sneak up on you, so enjoy them when you are settled in for the night.

A very refreshing & fruity "girlie" drink for sure! Substituted pineapple/orange juice blend & it was a little better - not quite as sweet! Yum!

If you add diet or regular lemon lime soda then call it a Bikini Splash!  Yummy in both versions and creates an atmosphere of vacation.

These were a huge hit, made a pitcher on Friday night for a basket bingo, I bragged about them so much all day Saturday that I had to make another pitcher for a cookout that night.  This is our official Summer 2009 Drink!!! thanks

Great! The Mr. loved mine and wanted one of his own. I did double the pineapple juice and it was perfect! So yummy! I think next I'm gonna try orange juice to go along with the pineapple.

I found this recipe last summer, bought the ingredients and measured out for a pitcher to take to a party  It was such a big hit that a couple of us had to leave to go buy more! 
Delicious, not too sweet and perfect for a hot summer night.

This was so delicious, it tasted like a strawberry pina colada! I usually enjoy strong martinis but even I found this one a bit too strong for the flavours. I echo others' recommendation to double the amount of pineapple... at least! Very delicious!

So I tried this martini recipe for my New Years party last night and it was such a HIT!! The only issue I have with this recipe is that you can only drink a few because they are so sweet. I am going to play with the recipe a bit to see if I can make it a little less sweet. Other than that it was Absolutely delicious! Thanks for post this!

I first tasted these at my cousins wedding a few years ago and fell in love with them.This is the exact recipe I use and it is perfect as is. Make sure you shake the mixture up at least 30 seconds to ensure that it is chilled.

Made this to bring to a 'Cocktail Potluck' where everyone brings their own cocktail and accompanying finger food. Very tasty, easy to make and easy to bring in one container. Just add grenadine to the glass. Reminded me alot of the taste of Mai-Thai's.

I decided to make this drink because I had the alcohol on hand and only had to buy grenadine and pinapple juice. I made as directed and it tasted like vodka more than anything. I see now why people added more pinapple juice. I tried that but it still wasn't all that great. I've had much better. I guess I was expecting it to be somewhat frothy and kinda along the flavor of a pina colada or a 'pinapple upside down cake' martini. I'm glad I didn't make a pitcher of this.

Yummmy...one of my favorite drinks ever. I do use a little more pineapple so I don't fall on the floor after only a few of these! LOL  Sometimes, I leave out the grenadine and use vanilla vodka instead of plain. You don't even miss the grenadine this way!

Wow! This martini is delicious! I was serving this at a party and everyone loved it. I doubled the pineapple juice so it wouldn't be too strong and added some ice in the shaker so that it would be cold. I'll definitely be making this again!

Had a couple of these tonight as a trial run for my upcoming July 4th party.  (research purpose only LOL) I took others advice and added more pineapple juice and I wasn't impressed at all.  My second batch I made exactly as the recipe states and it was fabulous!  I'll serve these at the party!

This really is a great, easy-to-make martini.  Have made this for friends/family many times, adjusting juice/alcohol ratios slightly to individual tastes, and gotten lots of compliments.  I use Malibu Rum for this one.

Made a few of these and they were pretty tasty!  The presentation is very pretty.  When you add the grenadine it flows all to the bottom.  So when you finish it, you get a nice sweet treat at the end.  I also sugar the rim of the glass.  Yum

Very tasty!  Make sure you only add a SMALL dash of grenadine and it creates the most colorful drink!  Note- we had to triple the recipe as it didn't make as many martini's as the recipe claimed.  This is a great drink and it was a party hit!

I made this for some seriously picky drinkers.  Very Grey Goose kinda gals so to speak.  Every one of them loved it!  I did too!  So easy to make.  I used Malibu coconut rum, Dole's pineapple juice from a can that I poured into a glass carafe and grenadine syrup.  I added the Grey Goose - and had a winner!  Make sure you shake it enough to make it frothy as it does make it better and colder.  Not as "put you under the table" as you might think.  Pleasantly surprised with the taste and the ability to function after having one.  But like I said - these are women who know how to have a drink now and then.  It makes you feel like you're in Hawaii so I highly recommend!

This drink is so good! Be careful, they are silently strong.  I served these at my Bunko night and everyone wanted the recipe.  They couldn't get enough, I actually tripled the recipe when using the martini mixer and it made about 3 drinks each time.  Like summer in a glass.

Tried Dole Pineapple/Mango juice instead of straight Pineapple juice in this today.  A bit thicker and doesn't seem to froth as well as pineapple but it was great

Our new favorite addiction.  I grabbed a pineapple/orange juice mix one night instead of plain pineapple juice.  I thought it was a horrible mistake and couldn't finish the drink - my husband thought it was a fine substitution.  Experiment at your own risk I suppose!

Wow, this packs a punch!  I took a sip and promptly doubled the pineapple juice as others had done.  Even then, this is quite a strong drink!  By using the remainder of the juice can, I was able to make it less full of fumes and something I could drink easily.  Thanks for the recipe!

The pineapple juice makes the drink in my opinion.  I wish I had a Martini glass for the picture but the drink was pretty good.  I changed it and added ice because my juice was not cold.

This is now our favorite martini. I make them exactly as directed. A martini is usually stronger than the standard mixed drink so I would not like it if the juice were doubled as some have suggested. The coconut rum would be overpowered and it adds just the right hint of coconut.

Great Drink and easy recipe to follow. Followed the recipe for the first drink than tweeked it a little by adding more pineapple juice. Very tasty. Made them two nights in a row. Just for a variety I tried it with Pineapple rum instead of coconut rum the second night (one of my friends didn't like the coconut). It was good that way too, but I prefer it with the coconut rum. GREAT RECIPE and if you do it right you get the cool layering effect from the grenadine. AWESOME....so yummy!!

A crowd pleaser at our family reunion this summer! I have continued to mix them this fall to remind me of the fun we had poolside! Can get too sweet, if you aren't careful with the grenadine.

For those that say it's too strong, that's how a martini tastes.   It's meant to be that way.    Try using a good rum not the "house" brand.   It'll make it smoother.   Coconut rum....so yummy!

This was good. The vodka helps cut the sweetness. But we liked the Tropical Delight Punch better.

This was my first Martini.  I was shocked by how much it smelled like a Lava Flow - my favorite drink from our honeymoon.  I doubled the pineapple juice like a reviewer had suggested.  It was still really strong but really good.

I altered this martini to make a less strong alcohol flavor. I followed the directions but added one extra oz of pineapple juice and then three oz of lemon/lime soda. Could hardly tell there was alcohol in it!

One of my favorite drinks.  I've used Captain Morgans, which is not a coconut rum, and it still turns out great.  Sometimes I just make it over ice when I don't feel like dealing with a shaker.

Loved this!  It is a bit strong for someone who doesn't drink martinis.  But if you are a martini drinker this is great for a summer night.

Tried these yesterday and they were yummy! I had them shaken and poured over ice, but I'm sure they'd be just as good served straight up. They're pretty sweet, but just perfect for a hot summer day!

This was great!  I substituted passionfruit rum, since I didn't have any coconut.  It was wonderful- even guys who "don't drink girlie drinks" said they loved it.

Don't leave out the grenadine--it adds the touch of sweetness that this drink needs!  I did use citrus vodka--which could be why it tasted so much better with the grenadine!

this isn't just a 'girl's drink' at all!  my husband (a Marine) loved it too!  we added a little less vodka and a little more coconut rum because it seemed a little strong (even for my friend who drinks more often than i do).  i think we may use another reviewer's idea of flavored vodka next time just to change things up.  but it's really great as is.

I have found MY drink...perfect and soo easy to make! Tweaked abit, not a fan of strong alcohol taste: 3/4 oz vodka, 1 1/4 oz each pineapple juice and malibu shaken with ice, strained with a splash of grenadine (actually double ingred. for a serving)...a must make!

This drink was a big hit at a recent party. I found that I was spending too much time mixing individual drinks.  I deciced to mix everything in a pitcher and put it in the fridge. Everyone had access to it throughout the night. No leftovers! Thanks for the recipe

These were awesome!  I served them to a few friends tonight, and everyone enjoyed them.  I actually experminted with Vanilla Vodka and Raspberry Vodka also, and found that I liked plain Vodka the best.  I used 1 ounce Malibu Rum, 3/4 ounce Grey Goose Vodka, and 2 ounces pineapple juice (I doubled the suggested amount of juice) and shook it up in a shaker with crushed ice.  I then added the dash of grenadine once I poured it in the martini glass.  Awesome - I will make again very soon!

This was ok. I think it's just my tastes, honestly. I guess I'm not a huge fan of the pineapple/grenadine combo. The second time I added some simple syrup and tonic water to dilute the pineapple (and make it less strong.) I left out the grenadine and liked it better.

Basic mixed drink, nothing fancy in my opinion.  I will admit I make a lot of mixed drinks using "The Little Black Book of Bartending" so I'm probably not the best person to rate a drink like this one.  Doubtful I will ever make again.

It was too strong for me. I made it the second time with 2 oz pineapple juice and felt that was more to my liking. I also preferred it more chilled, so I shook with several ice cubes.

Yumm!!  What an easy and delicious summer drink!  Definitely something you'd enjoy poolside ;)  I kept the ratios of 1 part coconut rum, 1 part vodka and 1 part pineapple juice and made this as a drink over ice - topped with Grenadine.  You can add more pineapple juice to your liking if this is too strong, but I found it to be perfect.  You could also make this in larger batches with the 1:1:1 ratio of rum, vodka and pineapple juice to go by.

I doubled the pineapple juice, garnished with a cherry, and rimmed the glasses with pink sugar!  Perfect!  :). I'll definitely be making this one, again!

This is really good as is, but I found that I preferred it with a little less vodka and a little more coconut rum.

Great drink! We make them by the pitcher for parties and just to make it easy mix equal portions of Malibu, vodka and pineapple juice and then let guests determine how much grenadine they want to add.

Amazing!! I've have spent so much money buying this martini at restaurants and bars. Now I can finally get my moneys worth and a little bit of a kick. This is much stronger than the ones sold at the bar. I am feeling wonderful after half a glass. Great flavor too!

The recipe as written wasn't that great, but when altered a bit it's realllly good. I don't like coconut so we just used banana rum, but since we're not big alcohol/vodka drinkers, this drink was too strong. We doubled the pineapple juice, and only used 1/2 ounce of vodka and it's fantastic. I'm drinking one as we type! With the drink mixed like this, I can definately see how you can get drunk quickly without realizing it.

Very good and very strong! My friend accused me of trying to kill her after the first sip, but we forgot about all of our worries! We made a whole pitcher of these little drinks for the beach.

I didn't have the grenadine and upped the juicey to 1.5 oz. and loved it.  Tastes a lot like a Pina Colada and will be making this again for sure.

Great recipe! A bit strong, but really good :) I paid $18 for a similar rum/vodka cocktail last weekend and it was not nearly as good.

Looked good but go easy on the grenadine as it only needs a couple of drops and if you give it a splash it will be too much and the last mouthful will be straight grenadine.  Too sweet for my liking.

YUM!  YUM!  YUM!  So easy, so delicious, such a pretty presentation.  I doubled the recipe and it fit beautifully into a martini glass.  I used raspberry vodka instead of regular.  I also went a little heavy with the pineapple juice because I didn't want to hurt myself when I drank more than 1 of these drinks!  Thanks!!!  The new drink of girls' night!

Very good. I didn't actually measure anything, just eye balled it. I didn't ahve any grenidine, so I left that part out. I added some club soda to ad a little fizz, which I think is a fun addition. Anyway, good stuff! Very refreshing
