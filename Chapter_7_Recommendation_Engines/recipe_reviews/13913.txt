I have tried this recipe and thoroughly enjoyed it. For excellent flavour, it does require time to marinate the mushrooms - this may be considered by some as a downside but it really is worth the time. All it means is that you have to be somewhat organized - but that's not so bad.

Definitely a keeper and everyone who has tasted these mushrooms loves them.

These are great as a meatless sandwich. We've melted cheese over them and serve them on a hamberger bun with lettuce and tomato. These are wonderful.

I tried this recipe on my picky husband and he actually liked it.  My kids didn't care for it, though.  I tried this marinade on steak and grilled it.  I've never had such a wonderful steak, at home or in a restaurant!

Absolutely delicious! Do not turn - grill one side only! I wasn't sure if the mushrooms needed to be turned over, as it seemed all the goodies would just fall out, so I grilled a couple on both sides and they weren't nearly as good.

The perfect thing to serve when you are entertaing both vegetarian and non-vegetarian guests.  The grilled portobellos are wonderful served as a "steak" or sliced and served over pasta.  They're even better served as a sandwich on french bread with sundried tomato pesto.  Wow!

This was a big hit at our house.  My husband said it tasted like grilled steak and asked for seconds.  That's the highest rating you can get from him.

Good easy recipe for tasty grilled mushrooms.  I grilled them and made sandwiches with mozzarella cheese, mayo and roasted red peppers on a toasted whole wheat roll.  Used 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar and that was definately enough.  Yum!

I can't wait to try this recipe again.  I did something very wrong the first time I tried it, and the vinegar was extremely overpowering.  Nobody could eat them.  I think I added too much. Next time, I'm going to omit it altogether, I think.  But, I've had  mushrooms grilled like this, and I KNOW they are delicous.  I just have to figure out what I did wrong.

I think this could be very good, but there is WAY too much balsamic vinegar flavor when following the recipe. The mushroom was very tender and all the other ingredients made gave it great flavor, but it was almost unedible with all the vinegar. I will probably make them again with 1/2 the amt of balsamic vinegar.

I totally changed up this recipe! I used Olive Oil instead of canola and cut the oil in half! I also cut the balsamic vinegar down to about 1 TBS per recommendation of others!. I added 1TBS of Soy Sauce, 2TSP of Ume Plum Vinegar (adds tang and saltiness)added 1/2 cup lemonade and a half tsp of Worcestershire sauce. I also took the stems from the mushrooms and chopped them up and added them to the Onions. I did not add any salt or pepper! I grilled these for around 15 minutes to make sure that the onions cooked through. These were absolutely amazing! We had them for my grandma's 90th birthday and everyone ignored the lamb and went straight to the portobellas. Not a bite left on anyone's plate!

OMG! I went totally rogue w/ this recipe - sorry. I used olive oil instead of canola and white balsamic vinegar and ended up marinating these for 3 days b/c I got sidetracked. I sauteed them over med-high heat and they are the best mushrooms I have ever tasted. I'll be using them in a frittata with feta and caramelized onions tonight.

Yummy! I was short on time. So I made the following adjustments.  I poured some olive oil directly on each mushroom.  Then I followed that with some balsamic vinegar poured directly on each one. Then I sprinkled garlic powder on top and added sea salt and black pepper.  I let them sit for about 30 minutes before putting them on the grill.  They were done in 8 minutes on the grill and were delicious.  We ate them burger-style with a slice of provolone cheese melted on top, a slice of raw onion, and a slice of tomato.  Perfect.

Thank goodness I read the reviews because the full amount of balsamic would have killed this.  Use half the amount called for at most.

These are perfect! We marinate them for about 4 hours (easy marinade to fix up and it takes about 5 minutes...if that) and then cook them on the grill. The first time I tasted these I thought I would fall onfo the floor in convulsive seizures of culinary delight (ok that is too dramatic but I am trying to convey...these are REALLY good!). I don't eat meat and had not had a "burger" (I do not like the frozen veggie burgers very much) in a long time. I ate these on hamburger buns with some habanero mustard (I like things hot) and my eyes rolled back in my head (ok..more drama I know LOL). Tonight just made them for the 2nd time and they were every bit as good as the first time we made them. 

Try these! You will not be sorry!!!

There's really no need to marinate the mushrooms; just brush the mixture on the 'shrooms right before grilling. Served it with steamed basmati rice and sauteed spinach.

These were so good I made them twice in a weekend, for different parties! I did use olive oil instead of canola, and shallots instead of onions for a more delicate flavor. We grilled the mushrooms gills-side-up and heaped the marinaded shallots and garlic onto the gills. All of the flavors cooked together, and we went ahead and served them with the "topping" too. Fantastic.

Killer mushies !!!  MARINADE FOR THE HOUR FOR SURE.  
But, Just some changes I made.  Trim the stem flush with the bottom of the gills so the marinade doesn't collect in the hole gravity.  Brush a little oil on bottom of cap & around edge.  Swirl the marinade that pools by the stem out every 15mins or so just to ensure all that goodness is everywhere.  I grilled these in a grill pan, then immediately take same (oven safe) pan & broil on high for 5-7 mins  They were amazing.  Such an earthy, rich flavor.  Seriously, don't put cheese or any other ingredients.  These are very flavorful as is !!!

This was one of the most FANTASTIC things I've ever tasted!! I have always been wanting to try portabella mushrooms, and my boyfriend has asked me to fix them, I came across this recipe and it sounded delishious and I had to make it. Wanted something light and flavorfull, and WOW this was it. Only changed the oil amount (I used EVOO) to 1/3 to about 1/2 a cup considering the balsamic is so pungent. Other than that I did everything the same. Grilled it 5 min on each side and they came out wonderfully. I did poke a few holes in the bottom to allow them to drain so they werent all watery. THANKS AGAIN!

We loved this combination of flavors for grilling portobello mushrooms!  Extremely simple to make but tastes complex and 'upscale'.  I served this with pasta topped with oil and asiago cheese and it was a great light dinner.  The only change I made was to reduce the balsamic vinegar by half but that's personal preference, no reflection on the recipe.  I also scooped out the gills, again just me.  We will be eating this many, many times I'm sure.  Thanks, BFOLLICK, for posting a great recipe!

These are fantastically easy to make and even better to eat! I stick to the recipe and grill these to perfection.  I have made them several times and they never disappoint! Sometimes if we have leftovers, we dice them up and put on top of pizza!

Instead of vegetable oil I use olive oil, I also add fresh rosemary. The flavors blend perfectly together

Very tasty mushrooms!  I grilled them with extra virgin olive oil instead of canola, shallots in place of onion, and added a slice of muenster cheese for the last minute of grilling.  So easy and yummy.

pretty good, but not 5 star due to a couple things - these really could have used some seasoning - salt, Italian seasoning, something. They were good but a bit bland. Also, watch your grill temp - I guess I made a mistake and misinterpreted the recipe's instruction for "hot" grill to mean "high" on my grill's burner dial and mine got a little too charred on the outside before they were cooked all the way thru. Next time I will turn it back to medium or medium low...Will try again with these modifications.

I have made this twice, first i marinated it for an hour and a half and used a pan to cook it the flavors overpowered the mushroom flavor too much and it was soaked with the marinade. I then mad it according to the recipe but added a sprinkle of thyme, salt and peper, it was wonderful

These were good, but balsamic vinegar is extremely powerful, and I would use much less than the recipe called for.  Perhaps 1 tbs or omit it entirely.  You can substitute vinegar for some onion powder and seasoned salt.

Oh, wow!  To quote my husband, "These are fantastic."  Marinating for an hour or so really gets the flavor going on these.  I mixed the ingredients as directed, but since I wasn't going to be grilling I sliced the caps to marinate, then sauteed them in a searing hot pan. To die for, and I can't wait to try this on the grill!

2nd time made. I tweaked the recipe quite a bit to my satisfaction (found marinade too overpowering the 1st time). I used about 6 tbs balsamic, 1/8 cup olive oil, 6 drops Worceshire sauce, 1 clove garlic, switched out the onions for 15 (chopped) pieces of chives, about 3 (chopped) stems of rosemary and 1 tsp raw sugar, plus salt & pepper. Perfection.

This was yummy. I couldn't believe I was eating mushrooms. I didn't have canola oil so I used grapeseed oil. Also, I fell asleep so they marinated about three hours. It didn't hurt it at all. Since this was the first time I grilled mushrooms, it would have helped if the recipe specified grilling them face up, face down, or half the time on each side (which is what I did).

Wow, these were just awesome!  Hubby came home with a 4-pack of Portobellas from Costco, so I found this and made it in about 10 minutes, then left it to marinate for about 3 hours while we were out and about.  I made it as listed (well, increased proportions a little because of the 4th 'shroom), except I used 1 tsp of bottled minced garlic instead of fresh.  We ate ours on a bun with some avocado slices on top.  So amazingly tasty!  5 stars alone for the taste, and another 5 for the ease of preparation!  We will definitely be adding them to the rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. I was really looking forward to this recipe but OH MY GOSH the vinegar was TOO much. I followed the recipe exactly and I don't know how anyone could even eat this. It was inedible. Sorry, but I have eaten much much better Portobello Mushrooms and I will steer clear of this recipe in the future.

Great recipe and SO tasty. The first time I followed the recipe but felt like their wasn't enough vinegar. This time I only had 20 minutes to let it marinade, but that was more than enough. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used garlic salt and dried basil. I also just used a frying pan and I came out great, it kept the flavor and the juices. Will be making this again and again.

The marinade for these mushrooms was outstanding.  My dinner guests could not stop raving about the delicious mushrooms.  The only change I made was I used olive oil instead of canola oil and I added some salt & pepper to the marinade.  10 minutes on the grill and they were ready for dinner.  Great recipe, Bfollick!

My girlfriend said hers turned out well, but I gave her the smaller of the two mushrooms, which coincidentally had a little break near the top and let the marinade drain off. Mine was a watery mess, because I didn't want to flip the mushroom and lose all the onions to the coals. Next time we make these, I'm going to pierce the bottom of the mushrooms to assure that the oil and vinegar drains off.  We also added Swiss to the top of these 5 minutes in which melted over it beautifully, and served on sourdough bread.  I'm going to play around with the recipe some more, but I'm definitely going to be adding these mushrooms to my repertoire.

As many others have said, I cut the balsamic vinegar by half to 2 tbsp. I also left out the onion from the marinade and changed the oil to extra virgin olive oil. Once marinated, I sliced and grilled the mushrooms. Be careful not to burn them. Then I used a Vidalia onion sliced VERY thin with 2 tbsp. of minced garlic...sautéed in olive oil till they cooked down a bit. After grilling the mushrooms I placed them in with the onion and garlic sauté for about 5 min. on low heat. WOW, really good used in a sandwich or wrap or over a bison burger.

Yum! I added approx. 3 tbsp of soy sauce and some fresh/dried african blue oregano to the marinade. 1-2 hour marinade in a ziplock, flip the bag about every half. George Forman grilled it 8 mins med-high. Perfect!

Good stuff! I love the way these big portabello caps mimic meat. I would agree with some of the other reviews that the recipe calls for a bit more balsamic vinegar than I think is needed, but then I was using a cheaper, more tart vinegar than is available. An aged, mellower version might be just right. Since, in addition to meat, mushroom caps mimic sponges, I wouldn't let them marinate much longer that an hour. Thanks, BFOLLICK!

This is a great recipe, which we prepare a few times each summer.  If you wonder whether to flip them over on the grill  -- don't!  You'll lose a lot of the flavors and it's not necessary.  I generally double or triple the minced garlic, use olive oil rather than canola and allow the caps to marinade for a few hours.  It's great for both vegetarians as well as carnivores, as it is quite meaty and tastes a lot like steak.

This recipe has great potential.  Here are the things I feel need consideration:  how large are the mushrooms?  Should the mushrooms be turned?  Based on my experience, you must watch your mushrooms for donness and do not turn them.  I substituted lemon juice but would have used white wine for vinegar (which I'm not supposed to consume) and I added thyme to the marinade.  Ten minutes was much too long.  They did not get mushy but too dark especially on the thin edges.  I will do it again a little differently.

Tried these using only canola oil and a splash of balsamic as a marinade, tossed in a dash of garlic powder, and soaked the mushrooms in it.  Cooked on the grill on high, and encouraged the flare-ups that came from the copious amounts of oil that dripped on to the fire.  When they were done, I sprinkled fresh grated parmesean cheese over the side with the gills, and served on onion rolls that I toasted on the grill.  FANTASTIC.

I wish I would have read more reviews.  The overwhelming vinegar flavor made these inedible.  I will try the same recipe but with a different type of juice to marinade other than the vinegar.

I didn't care for this, but I am NOT a mushroom fan. I gave 4 stars because my husband and guests really liked them. I guess the soft texture threw me (I really wanted it to taste like a steak). I even had my husband throw them back on the grill to try and "firm" them up. The marinade was delicious and I would like to try on a real steak. Thank you.

A tad too much on the vinegar for our taste. We will cut in half the next time so we can taste the mushroom.

The taste was ok, but something was really missing. I went back to look at other reveiws for tips and couldn't help but notice most who loved,  sereved as a sandwich or topped with chese and the extra ingredients (eg. pesto sauce and bread)must be needed to balance.  I may try again.

This recipe was very good. Even my carnivore boyfriend liked it. I marinated the mushrooms for two hours instead of one. I didn't use any canola oil--instead I used about 2 tbsp of olive oil. Grilled half the batch (Foreman Grill) and broiled the other half and preferred the broiled version since it was easier and a lot less messy. Could be served by itself, over some cous-cous, or on a burger bun with melted swiss (as we did).

These were fantastic. I used olive oil and red wine vinegar as that is all I had on hand. Grilled over super hot coals for appx. 7 minutes. We enjoyed every bite!

Wonderful flavor and texture.  Who can't use a vegetarian meal once in a while.  I uded olive oil instead of canola.  We melted blue cheese in the well of the mushroom and topped with lettuce and tomato on a kaiser roll.  Best "burger" I have ever had.

This was my first attempt at grilling portobello mushrooms, and I thought they turned out very nicely.  They were flavorful and juicy, we ate them on hamburger buns.

Délicieux! I adjusted the recipe to 4 servings and used olive instead of canola oil.  I thought the suggested amount of garlic seemed like a bit too much, so I used two very large cloves instead. These shrooms are a great substitute for burgers. My vegetarian guests were so pleased. I'll definitely be making these again.

We added some crumbled bacon to the top and some grated parmesan, served over a tomato slice.  I used the indoor grill and covered for the last five minutes with some water in the drip pan to steam a little. I cut the balsamic back by half as others advised, so good that I ran right out and bought more mushrooms for tomorrow.  Outstanding!

Add lemon juice some lemon juice, salt and pepper to the mix to tie it all together. Also if you leave the stems on it makes for easy transportation to and from the grill.

Extremely disappointing. The savory flavor of the mushroom is gone and the sweetness of the balsamic is overpowering (think: sugary mushrooms.) Onions are wasted as they impart no flavor.  Would not make this again.

YUMMY!  The texture took a second to get used to because it tastes so much like a steak burger... I ate it on whole wheat with pepper Jack cheese, lettuce & tomato...

For the first time having a portobello mushroom, I thought this was really good.  I originally had it on a sandwich like a burger, but I didnt like that so I just had it with the lettuce and onion and it was good like that.

Delicious!!!! We tried this recipe last night and will definitely make it again.  Made a few changes to this recipe after reading many reviews that the balsamic was too much so I added more canola oil than called for, added fresh thyme and oregano, then added feta cheese a few minutes before taking it off the grill.  The flavors were a wonderful mix and just melted in your mouth.

Being a new vegetarian, my husband was bbqing, i did not know what to eat.  I stumbled across this recipe, i never knew I liked mushrooms.  But made this way I now have something to eat when he fires up the pit.  We let them stand for about 3 hours, and a few people even put them on top of their burgers patties. THANKS!!!

I halved the vinegar because I knew it would be too much and and my boyfriend still could not eat it.  I thought it was good, hence the two stars.  As written (4tbsp vinegar) this would be inedible to us.  Sorry!

Love these! Since none of my kids really care for portabellos, i marinate a bunch and keep in the refrigerator for lunches when i am in a hurry (just fry one up in a pan). I like to melt mozzarella on top and eat on a whole wheat bun (or english muffin). I think i am going to try this on small portabello kabobs with sirloin!

I removed the gills and peeled the skin from my mushroom caps, then after marinading baked them for 20 minutes at 425.  Topped with provolone cheese and served burger style with tomato and lettuce.  Makes for a very tasty 'bello burger!

Not bad, however the amount of dressing for 3 portobello mushrooms was NOTHING to really do anything to season them before grilling.  I've had grilled portobello mushrooms much better than this one.  I'd add more ingredients, don't  know exactly what, but the recipe can definitely be improved.

My husband, my son, and I liked this recipe. I marinated for 45 minutes, which was fine. I used 3 T. of balsamic and that was probably better than 4. I understand that sour/tangy taste another reviewer mentioned. But it didn't bother me as much. I think you can work with the ingredients as you like. It is a great starting recipe, if you are just trying grilled mushrooms.

As a new vegetarian, I am experimenting with lots of new recipes- this is definetly one of my favorites!  I made this for dinner for myself on a whole grain sandwich round while the rest of the clan ate their burgers.  This was incredible!  I will make them again and again!  I did not change the recipe one bit- it's perfect just as is!

This is one of those great recipes that is fast, simple, straightforward and simply delicious. It has just the right combination of flavors. The portobellos hold up well on the grill (they don't fall apart). This would go equally well with hamburgers and macaroni salad as they would with a gourmet steak and Caesar salad. Loved it!

This isn’t about the recipe but about the improper grammar use. It is said and I quote “ Here there marinated” which is improper.  As in they are and it should be they’re and not there.

Always keeping an eye out for a good mushroom recipe.  Couldn't resist trying this and was not disappointed.  Love grilled mushrooms and balsamic vinegar.  Of course grilling is epic.  To decrease the earthy flavor of mushrooms, I turn the cap upside down and scrape the gill part out. Then I poke tiny holes all over the bottom of the mushroom cap and let it marinate all day before grilling it.  A grilling trick I like to use is to set the thing I am grilling beside rather than directly over the heat.  Or on the warming rack if your grill has one.  After it gets as warm as I like it, then I set it directly over the flames to get the grilled marks and crunchy  bits.  This way I can more easily control how well done the item is. No more burned food with cold or lukewarm center.

When you prepare it like above and marinate it all day or overnight, the mushroom really has a great flavor.   I have started to add some liquid smoke or smoke flavored salt to the marinade to give it a more meaty flavor.   Even my mushroom hating, carnivore husband likes this if he has a couple of sides to break up the flavor.

Taste your balsamic before you use it.  If you do not love the taste of that variety you will not like this recipe.  It is a prominent flavor in the end result.  Use one you really enjoy or make a balsamic reduction by adding ruby port and sugar to taste and simmer to reduce by half.  Some super market brands are horrid and this can salvage those unfortunate bottles of nastiness.

I used 1/4 cup tomato basil balsamic vinegar dressing instead because I did not have any balsamic vinegar. We also grilled the mushrooms on the bbq with hickory wood chips. The next day we heated up the leftovers and you could really taste the smoke from the chips that infused into the mushrooms.

Loved this, and love allrecipes.com!  As other reviewers suggested, I cut back on the balsamic vinegar, and that turned out to be a smart move.  I would say 2T is plenty. My only other modification was to add  diced red pepper (about as much as the onion), and a little S&P to the mixture before spooning over the mushroom caps.  I let them marinate at room temp for about 2hours before grilling, and they were terrific! I served this with a spoon full of seafood salad (also found on allrecipes.com), and it seemed to be the perfect summertime evening meal!

These were delicious -- as written I think they would have been a little bland.  I added sea salt & cracked people to the oil / vinegar.  I used shallots instead of onions and I also drizzled some Worcestershire sauce over the whole thing.  Grilled for 10 mins over direct heat and then about another 10 over indirect.  wow -- they were the bomb!!

Delicious, simple, quick and healthy dish. If you let the mushrooms marinate for longer, you get a stronger taste.  Really enjoyed this dish.

The first time I made it my husband complained that it was too vinegary.  The second time around I substituted 2 Tbsp. Water for 1/2 the vinegar.  My husband liked it that way.

We made this tonight, using olive oil instead of canola and less balsamic vinegar after reading the reviews.  I also added a bit of salt and pepper, but it was still just kind of bland, soggy and greasy (and that was after deciding to turn them and grill both sides -- I can't imagine how greasy they would be if you left it all pooled on top and didn't turn the way some reviewers said to do it).  I think this would be better as part of a burger with a lot of toppings or something, but you might as well skip the large amount of oil since it just makes it greasy in a soggy way and quadruples the calories.  I'll try another recipe next time.

This is a great recipe - delicious mushrooms! I used 3T olive oil, 4 T balsamic and 2T soy sauce. Also, 1/2 tsp dried minced garlic, the minced onions, and cracked black pepper. They grilled gill side up with a little sharp cheese on top. I made a sandwich on a bun with avocado, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I Couldn't ask for anything better. Thanks so much!

Absolutely LOVE this....I do my own twist on this though...I cut fresh pineapple into rings and put them on the grill as well. When portobello's are done I put the pineapple on top then put some raw cheddar or colby cheese on them and melt under broiler for a few minutes. I serve it with Organicville bbq sauce, roasted asparagus and sweet potato oven fries. EVERYONE I have ever made this for wants the recipe - it has been a huge hit even for major meat eaters!

Made these yesterday..they were awesome. I used 2 Tablespoons of Balsamic(Trader Joe's Gold Quality Balsamic Vinegar of Modena) and light olive oil instead of canola. Didn't have an onion so I used a shallot. It made enough marinade to put on 5 large mushrooms. I spooned it onto the gill side only and just rubbed olive oil on the smooth side. I let it soak in for @4 hours before I grilled them. I topped them with smoked provolone, home made roasted peppers and home made pesto and put them on a fresh kaiser roll. Friends said they were the best grilled mushroom sandwiches ever :)

I agree with a few others that there was too much vinegar in the marinate. Other than that it was good and we will try it again. I did add some Parmesan cheese. I cooked them in a hot oven on a baking sheet for about 15 minutes.

Great recipe! Some reviewers had difficulty with the Basalmic vinegar...you should note that different brands of Basalmic can greatly differ in strength. I would say 4 tbsp would be fine for a milder vinegar, but adjust to 2 or 3 tbsp with a very strong Basalmic. Also, a great addition is a tbsp of Mrs.Dash or a veggie spice. We also like pepper flakes for a little heat.

AMAZING!!  LOVE this recipe and now feel guilty pleasure when we cook out and I eat this while everyone else eats burgers or whatever.  Yum!  I'm drooling just thinking of it.  I have made recipe this way many times but have made tweaks over the years.  Now my adapted marinade takes 30 seconds to prep and is easier to flex up or down by mushroom count.  PER MUSHROOM, I use 1 TBSP canola oil, 1 TBSP balsamic, 1-2 clove garlic (depending on audience or mood), plus a sprinkle or two (maybe 1 tsp?) of Montreal Steak seasoning (McCormick, I think).  Takes no time at all and pop it in to marinate.  Only hassle is remembering to make them in advance but it's worth it.  If they marinate for less time, they're still good but not DIVINE!!  Oh, and leftovers are good cold with other veggies or beans.  Often eat with white beans and leftover grilled asparagus or chopped tomatoes with a little balsamic dressing.  THANK YOU for submitting and for all the other reviewers' insight!!  One of my weekly favorites!

The vinegar was way too overpowering in this recipe. I will try again, but cut the vinegar back to 1 tablespoon next time.

Love this!  I mix balsamic vinegar with Italian Seasoning Dressing mix, then marinate them.  Great flavor, goes well with salmon!

Great flavor and simple. I use my cast iron grill pan indoors and it turns out great! This will make smoke indoors though so make sure you have good ventilation if you go that route.

Very easy to prepare, incredibly tasty and a hit with our vegetarian friends. Total prep time (including grill and marinating time) was about 1h 20m. We served this with tomato based gazpacho, cold rice/vegetable salad, grilled veggies and a zinfandel/syrah/merlot blend supplied by our guests. It was a very colorful, well received and satisfying meal. The one leftover was just as satisfying the next day! I'm not a vegetarian, but this will definitely be added to our rotation.

SOOOO good! I used olive oil instead and included a little salt and pepper. One question: the recipe states to reserve the stems for other use. What other use? I may chop them up finely and add them to the mixture next time around.

This recipe has made a believer out of people who don't believe that this can be a tasty and healthy option for lunch or dinner.

For my family's taste, we used 3 cloves of garlic vs the 4.

Easy, and of course its a base to use to make it your own.  I loved it pretty much as written, although I did add a few shakes of crushed red pepper.

Made these last night, did not like the balsamic vinegar marinade.   Also, 10 minutes is not enough unless the grill heat is so high it burns the mushrooms...I did at 325 for 25 minutes, turning several times.  Mine looked like the picture but didn't like the taste.  I will try again another day.

This recipe really saved my day.  I knew of all the ingredients, but I was not sure what kind of vinegar to use.  Thanks, BFOLLICK. I always make extra ones to add to next day sandwiches.

I made these several months ago and they were a hit!  My husband keeps asking me to prepare them again so making them again tonight!  I throw all of the marinade ingredients in the Vitamixer and make a double recipe.  I use the left overs in other recipes. Fantastic  sliced and used in Spring Rolls or over pasta.

Love these mushrooms. I took to work to our breakroom and heated one up for lunch with some vegetables. They went crazy. Thought I was having steak for lunch and the smell was amazing. Wonderful on a bun also in place of a burger. Dress it up, dress it down, it is great.

With the marinade, these did grill up nicely.  However, they were a little too sour and a little too greasy for my taste.  It overpowered the earthy tone of the mushroom that I love so much.

Wow - these were AWESOME.
I added a bit of red pepper flakes to the marinade for just a bit of heat.

VERY tasty!  Marinated it longer, but no worries.  These were juicy and perfect, served as an accompaniment to filet mignon.  Would be just as well suited as the "meat" for a burger.  Will definitely be using this one again.  Thanks!

So delicious.  We used golden balsamic and they came out so flavorful.  I bought the ones that were already sliced, but they were so difficult to grill...next time I'll buy the larger ones.  They also shrink considerably (I forgot that happens to mushrooms).  This would have been a great meal for Lent if I had found it back then.

I gave these a 5, but my husband only gave them a 3, so we'll average it out.  Good flavor, very satisfying texture.  He just isn't that into portobellos, so we may look at other recipes, but I felt the balsamic vinegar matched well with the flavor of the mushroom.

The only change I made was to use olive oil. We all loved these (my husband and I, my vegetarian friend, my 87 year old meat and potatoes father). We served them with steak, rice & bean stuffed peppers, and tossed salad.

I made the fabulous mushrooms as a compliment to our dinner the other night.  They were very flavourful.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them.  I grilled them on my indoor grill, rather than the BBQ, and they turned out very juicy.  I highly recommend these.

What a treat!  The mushrooms were a big hit at our BBQ.  Will definately make again and again. I also used the marinade on a london broil and it added great flavor to the meat.

I used just a little butter instead of the oil, added honey and halved the balsamic vinegar.  Lovely sweet and sour flavour.  Will certainly cook again.

Made these tonight and they are delish! I would try 3 TB of balsamic next time because it was just a little too strong, not bad but just my taste. I just marinated in a bag and was able to grill both sides then added some of the remaining marinate on top. Enjoyed this a lot and will make again!

This was as promised- "divine!" I would totally make this again and next time I will eat them all! LOL!The flavor turned out perfectly but I think it has to be on the grill. One of my guests who had it was vegan. She asked for the recipe right away after the first bite. Instead of grilling she said she may roast in the oven but I'm not sure it would turn out the same. I let the marinade sit in the mixing bowl for an hour. After I spooned them onto the portobello caps I let it soak in for another hour before grilling. They were absolutely delish!

Unbelievably good.  Even non-vegetarians will love this “meaty” alternative to a burger.  Have made it 3 times now.  It’s become a staple.  I serve it on  Orowheat Multi Grain Sandwich Thin rolls with lettuce, tomato, avocado & sprouts.  Delicious !

The taste was delicious, but I must have done something wrong. The onions were under cooked. I think it could have been grilled for 20 minutes. Grill closed at about 400 degrees.

I made this because I bought some portobello caps and didn't know what to do with them. They are very good! I usually just put steak seasoning on grilled or stir fried mushrooms, but the vinegar is tasty, too. Will make again.

Great recipe.  I didn't have onion or fresh garlic so i did a teaspoon of onion powder and a teaspoon of garlic powder. Based on other reviews i cut back the balsamic a bit to 2 tablespoons and added 1 tablspoon of soy sauce.

I served these on buns with pesto, tomato & mozzarella cheese. Very tasty. However, the next day when I ate the leftovers (cold btw, which was fine) I added a smear of Miracle Whip to the bun and extra salt on the tomato. WOW, what a difference. SO good! 
It is possible to do this vegan with vegan pesto, v mayo & v cheese.

Very good. Lots of flavour. Make sure you marinate it long enough for the flavour to absorb.

This was delicious. I marinaded for 2 hrs and instead of
1/4 Cup (4 tbsp) balsamic vinegar, I used 1/4 cup balsamic glaze (it's thicker) and 1/4 cup water. I used on 2 super huge Portabella caps. I chopped the mushroom stem and added to Marinade before pouring inside cap. Great w/ BBQ/grilled meats.

What an easy, yet very tasty recipe!  The flavor of the chicken was sooo good, and the mushrooms sauce was the cherry on top! I have combined the chicken with other toppings or sides as well for a completely different dish, regularly.  Great recipe:)

Definitely too much oil. Even adding 1/4 c of soy sauce and apple vinegar each, there was too much oil. I also added 1/4 c of chopped scallions and sprinkled some cracked black pepper. Next time I would cut the oil in half and switch to olive oil.

It tasted pretty good (even my 10-year old grandson liked them), but I was hoping for something a little sweeter. Probably the wrong ingredients for that.

Can't wait to try this recipe! Only step I will be adding is to lay the mushrooms gill side up in the sun for 20-30min prior to marinating. May not be a well known tip but you get more Vitamin D from mushrooms if you lay them out in the sun.

I really enjoyed the taste of this recipe.  The only thing I used different was olive oil instead of canola oil.  When I make it again, I think I'll add some mozzarella cheese to the caps.

Not great. Could use more flavor. Also should have put the mushrooms  right on top of the hot coals instead of indirectly heating them off to the side.  Came out better when I stuffed them with black beans and salsa and baked them in the oven.

I liked it. Boyfriend thought it was too vinegary. The onion and garlic would be better if the onion was carmelized on the side and then placed on top after mushroom was done. I'll tweak it next time.

Full disclosure: I was out of onion and used shallot instead.

These mushrooms were fantastic! I needed a vegetarian main dish for a BBQ and made these. Honestly, I think these were a bigger hit than the tri tip we made! I will absolutely make these again.

I read the other reviews and followed the advice of decreasing the amount of Balsamic vinegar. I cut the amount in half from 4 TBS. to 2 TBS. The first word out of my husband's mouth was, " Boy you can really taste the vinegar in these." I thought so, too. If I make them again, I may try two tsp. of the vinegar.

I made this for a vegetarian friend when I grilled up some steaks at my place. She's not the biggest balsamic vinaigrette fan, which I didn't know, but she still liked these. Her only comment would be to use less of the vinaigrette. I ate one the next day and loved it just as it was! Sooo yummy! I diced the onion instead of chopping.      I only took off the one star as a warning to use your best judgement on the amount of balsamic vinaigrette.

Used olive oil instead of canola and grilled the mushrooms for only about a minute (or at least a lot shorter than the recommended time).  Also used half the amount of balsamic vinegar.  They were amazing!  Based on taste, it is a five star recipe, but due to the changes to the recipe, only gave it four.

I did not like this recipe. I always make exactly as per the instructions the first time to give an accurate review. Like others, I felt there was too much balsamic and the flavor was just sour and lacked complexity. Also the 'shrooms were soggy and I didn't care for the texture. I'd rather just grill the shrooms naked and drizzle with some vinegar & oil, S&P to finish.

I really enjoyed the taste. I arrived home and wanted a quick side dish. I reduced the marinating time....which I wasn't' t so ingenuity managed about 30 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great recipe and I will definitely use again. Thanks for the recipe.

I give this a 4 or 5, my husband gives it a 2, so I'm rating it a 4. I thought this was easy and delicious! I also skipped the fresh onion and instead did dried, minced onion since that's easier. This smelled so freakin' good while it was marinating, and tasted lovely as well. I cooked it in sauce pan with a little of the marinade. Cooked up nice!

Delicious! I use the caps as a "bun" for hamburgers.  I do however, use less balsamic (2 tbsp)as it is quite strong.  I also let it marinade for a few hours to let the mushroom fully absorb the flavours.

I have never really liked any kind of mushrooms, but these are amazing!!  The kids liked the initial flavor, but had a bit of an issue with the texture. I can't wait to eat this again.

Very good.  Used pre-sliced portobello mushrooms and some peppers.  I used Colavita Balsamic Vinegar from Modena, Italy.  Very good brand. Put aluminum foil on the grill, with a little of the marinade, then mushrooms and veggies on top.  Grill 5 minutes on each side.

My husband grilled his pork chop, and I had my mushroom. Yum! He wanted his pork chop blackened, so I added the rub to both the pork chop and the portobello. I did marinate the mushroom over an hour. I left all the marinade, onions and garlic in the gills, and I'm glad I did. I loved the flavor of the balsamic with the heat of the spices.

I agree with previous comments that 2 Tablespoons of vinegar is more than enough. With that said, it is an excellent marinade. I tried serving the whole mushroom as a burger on a bun, but the marinade made the bun hopelessly soggy. Next time I will slice the mushrooms and serve as a side dish, in a salad, or as a sandwich with carmelized onions.

Excellent mushrooms! In order to make this a 5 star I will cut down on the vinegar which was previously suggested by another reviewer. It was too overpowering.

Add a tomato slice. So good!  The mushroom by itself in this marinade is amazing. I marinaded a thick slice of tomato with it and grilled it on too of the mushroom. Yum!

Amazing! I served this with brown rice and grilled asparagus - very filling. I did change to olive oil and used half as much vinegar. In addition, I used the same amount of marinade on 2 caps. I think next time I will put a little shaved parmesan or romano cheese and pop them under the broiler for a minute or two. Yum!

These turned out very good, but there was a lot of oil sitting on top of the mushroom. I drained it off several times while on the grill. Make sure you don't grill too long, they turn mushy.

Just wonderful. I had no balsamic but subbed with  lambrusco vinegar and only used about half called for in the recipe--we don't like too much zing. Hubs never cooked a portobello before today, he put them on a grill rack and let cook about ten minutes, a very big one needed a few minutes more, very easy to grill and excellent for beginner or experienced chefs. Family raved about the favor.

I like this recipe a lot. Another reviewer mentioned (indygirl915)that it had too much vinegar. I agree. I use 4 teaspoons of vinegar instead of 4 tablespoons. It is confusing that the oil is measured in 1/4 cup but the vinegar is measured in 4 tablespoons.

I like mushrooms and so did my guest.  I used balsamic dressing/marinade instead of the vinegar mix.  I added just a little seasoning salt and it was yummy.

Yum, yum and yum.  I followed the directions to a tee except for I added a little sea salt. I ended up marinating them for 3 hours.  They were absolutely delicious.  Even my carnivore husband couldn't get enough of them.  We are following a Paleo-ish diet and these will definitely be a staple!!!

First time trying these babies and I have to say they were yummy!  A bit too wet for a regular roll but then maybe I overdid the marinade.  Hubby wouldn't touch them (says he won't eat mushrooms) but everyone else, including the teenage grandchildren loved them.  Will definitely make again and experiment with different cheeses and other toppings.  Thanks for the post.

Ultimate. This was fantastic. I'm a meat-at-ever-meal type trying to find some alternatives that don't amount to a waste of charcoal. Naturally a downpour started while I was prepping, so I wound up using a cast iron grill pan on the stove but it sacrificed nothing about the dish.

Was definitely tasty. All three kids tasted and seemed to enjoy(8,7 and 5). My wife suggested next time to add Parmesan cheese.....which sounds like a great idea to me.

Very tasty. Marinated for about 25-30 minutes only and quartered the mushrooms. Everybody loved them, even my 2 year old ate 2 pieces. New fave here.

I didn't know hoe many mushrooms I had, since they ere precut...so I think the marinade was a bit heavy on the balsamic - but everyone seemed to like it!  I actually don't even like mushrooms, and I thought they were pretty tasty.

These were pretty good! The balsamic vinegar added just the right amount of tang to it.

I only added 3 Tbs of balsamic vinegar and it was enough for me.  I had to bake these in the oven but next time I will grill them or wait and make them another day.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are the best mushrooms with grilled Rib Eye steaks!  We substituted with 1/8 C. EVOO and 2 Tbs. of the vinegar. It is worth the hour marinating time!! Thanks for the easy recipe!

Good stuff!  I didn't even marinate this for more than 10 minutes..and it came out perfect.  We served it on hamburger buns...with chopped grape tomatoes and fresh basil (mixed with a bit of leftover marinade).  Yum! I'll be making it a second time tonight...and trying the full marinade time as well.

These were okay, but not what I expected. I've had a similar recipe as appetizers in restaurants and expected a similar flavor with this recipe. It just didn't seem as flavorful as I expected. Maybe they needed to marinade for more than an hour. I will definitely try these again, with a longer marinade time and will modify this post if I get better results.

I made this as a hamburger alternative for a vegan friend at our recent cookout.  She loved it!  The vinegar taste and smell disappeared after grilling, but left the rich balsamic flavor.  The mushrooms that she didn't eat became sliced toppings for the rest of the burger eaters.  Everyone loved it.

This turned out amazing!  I used olive oil and did a  reduction with the balsamic vinegar so ended up using about double the amount since it boiled down.  It tasted better than a good London Broil.  My son and his girlfriend are vegan and vegetarian respectively, and they really enjoyed it too.  Thanks Joe.

These have great flavor. The first time I sliced them after cooking and served them along side a nice steak. Second time I ate them on a bun just like a burger with all the fixins. Both ways were soo good.

This was a good simple recipe.  I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used and apple type.  I'm sure it would be much better with the proper vinegar.
