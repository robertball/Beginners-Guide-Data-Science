Very tasty, and easy.  I couldn't resist adding some fresh chopped rosemary, crushed garlic and butter under the skins.  I also turned the hens on the rack and increased oven temp for a few minutes to brown the bottom skin.   I would cut back a bit on the amount of lemon juce next time, but the baste did make a savory sauce in the bottom of the pan (grease can be skimmed off).  Will definitely make again.

Yummo. I didn't find the lemon juice overwhelming at all as others have said. And I'm not big on citrus in my meat. Very easy recipe. Great flavor. For some reason, my roaster pan dries up liquids very quickly making it difficult to baste. So after the 30 minute mark when I was supposed to start basting, I poured a little white wine in the bottom of the pan. I basted the hens every 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes. It was wonderful, and the crunchies in the bottom of the pan were so good! Adding cloves of garlic as someone else said would probably make this even better. If I make cornish hens in the future, this may be the only recipe I'll use.

This is excellent, although I added rosemary to the spices.  Cooking time at 375 is too short.  Need to increase temp or lengthen time.

Gotta give it 4 stars. I changed things & plus I was not overly "wowed" but nonetheless it was still good.  I cut down on the lemon (per suggestions and hubby's lack of prefernce for strong lemon flavor) and cut down on butter and made up the difference by adding chicken stock. Also, added a bit of rosemary and a slice of onion and leftover lemon from the lemon juice inside the hen cavity. Skin got nice and brown which is a definite plus - be sure to give the hens adequate room, don't scrunch them, on the baking pan. I did not have a roasting rack, so, I improvised by balling up some aluminum foil, then covered the foil balls with one sheet of foil with slits, and placed the birds on top. Also, basted every 15 minutes or so and let them rest when they were finished. Good basic recipe...nothing super excited but very classic. Will more than likely use again - the husband really enjoyed it.

Okay. Like my own recipes with cornish hens. Although it was juicy, my family and I didn't care for the 'lemony' taste. Followed other reviews suggestions and used some of my own spices, but still this recipe falls short.

this was very good!  The only thing we did differently was that we smoked the game hens before marinating them. Delish!

Sometimes the possibilities are endless when it comes to chicken and meat. When it comes to finding a good basting recipe, I get skeptical; finding the right combination of flavors can be difficult.  This was really good and easy to prepare. They turned out very moist and flavorful - the meat just fell apart, it was so good. I also stuffed each hen with a chuck of chopped onion and a chunk of orange. Made this for a crowd of 11 on christmas eve and they all loved it (and were stuffed). I'll use this recipe again.

this was an excellent dish.  i used this recipe for my girlfriend and i and we absolutely loved it.  i would highly recommend using a little less lemon juice and adding some fresh chopped garlic and rosemary.  i will be making this dish again in the near future.

I cooked only one hen so the recipe was divided into 1/6th.  Cooked in a gas oven at sea level.  Cooking time is way too low.  I would add maybe another 30 minutes.  Maybe raise the temperature to 400.  

From the salvaged parts, the seasoning tasted great.  Adding rosemary, as others have suggested, was an excellent idea.

I was not in my home kitchen, but its frustrating to follow a recipe to a letter and not get it right.  Please fix.

I added in more spices than what was listed..oregano, basil, and lemon pepper and cut down the lemon juice to 1/4 cup.  It was moist and juice.  I also chopped up onions, carrots, and yellow bell peppers in the pan for the last 30 mins.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner.  My family loved it!  They were juicy, perfectly browned and awesome.  I thought I had lemon juice but it turned out to be lime juice, worked just as well.  I have been voted the new Christmas dinner chef.

I made this with chicken legs and it was so so so good.  I enjoyed it.  It was very tender.  I added olive oil to the lemon juice and butter.  I dipped the chicken in the lemon juice/butter/olive oil mixture.  I season the meat separately with some lemon/pepper season. I then continued to baste the chicken thru out the cooking time.  It turned out great!!! excellent flavor.

An excellent spice mixture, contrasts well with wild rice and green veggies. Should add 10 minutes to cook time for each oven door opening for basting.

I just made this last night and used a Breville BOV800XL toaster oven.

It turned out great!  As was suggested by another reviewer, I did up the temperature to 380 and added 5 minutes cooking time.  The ingredient list was simple and prep was simple.  Will definitely make it again.

I loved it!! I didn't use lemon juice but might try it next time... i did add some red pepper because I like spicy foods. also i made sure to rub the ingredients into my hen before cooking, and turned the heat on my oven up to 400 ten minutes before it was finished. the sauce was tasty, and great to pour over the hen after it was finished.

I really liked this recipe, very easy to make and so   tasty.I did add a little chopped garlic and some dried rosemary. I have a gas cooking range and find it did take a little longer to cook even using the  convection setting. The hens were golden brown.I de-glazed the pan with white wine, which made the gravy taste great.I will make this for our christmas dinner this year instead of the usual turkey... this was my first time cooking cornish game hens...thanks so much for the recipe!

The hens were delicious and very juicy! The only substitution I made was using "smoked" paprika, instead of regular paprika. I cooked them at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 30 minutes.

I made these for an anniversary dinner and all I have to say is wow! They were tender and moist and the sauce was perfect! I admit I too used fresh herbs as opposed to dried and cut back a tad on the lemon, but only because of who I was cooking them for.
This was the perfect dinner to celebrate. Thanks so much!

Yummy. I added lots of lemon juice (fresh squeezed) because I like lemon. The skin was just crispy enough and the meat was juicy.  Very good!

Tasted wonderful, the only reason I am not giving it 4 stars is because the mixture clumped and got hard while sitting between bastings so I used melted butter and sprinkled on the seasoning. Great tasting birds and so tender.

This is probably my favorite recipe I have found on All Recipes! I use this on all roasted chicken whether they're hens or not and they always come out crispy and flavorful. My one piece of advise is to not scrimp on the basting every seven to ten minutes at the end because that really makes it great!

My kids LOVED this recipe.  Imade it for Christmas dinner and they were licking the bones the flavor was so delicious.  I also added some butter and rosemary under the skin but otherwise followed it exactly and the hens came out fantastic.  Will make over and over and over.  May even try it on next years turkey for thanksgiving!

amazing! Did this in the crockpot with 2 hens used the amount in the recipe except the paprika (used 1/2 cumin and 1/2 red pepper to replace) and used this to season the chicken. then put an extra cup of lemon juice in the bottom of the pot. Chopped up some extra margarine a put some of it in the cavities of the hens and put the rest in the bottom of the crockpot. My husband and I loved it!

Cornish hens are one of my favorites for company dinner, and this is a good recipe.  I stuff the birds with seedless grapes and tell the guests that this is mating season for cornish hens and if they are lucky enough to get a female they may find eggs inside, which are delicious.  When the plates are served at the table I anoint each hen with a few spoons of flaming Grand Marnier.

This was really good! I'm not a very experienced cook, but this was simple enough and turned out great! Made this for Christmas dinner.  I had to cook the hens a bit longer (maybe 20-30 mins) than the recipe called for, but that could just be my oven.

So-so recipe. Added rosemary along with other seasonings. If make again will cut down on the lemon juice, a bit too much for our tastes.

Made these for a family dinner and they came out so beautiful and tasted wonderful.  Of course I made a few changes.  I only used a dash of thyme, added in a bit of dried rosemary and I put half of a lemon in the cavity of each bird.  Also, instead of pouring half of the liquid over the birds in the beginning, instead I basted them every 15 minutes.  Birds were golden brown and moist with a wonderful lemony flavor.  Everyone enjoyed this very much!

First time game hen- We tried this recipe with potatoes, onions and mushrooms. Our oven lied to us-  It said 375 on the dial but took longer to cook. Will test with oven therm. I give this an A++.
