These bars are unbelievably delicious!  A blend of short-bread like crust, with an unbeatable combination of chocolate and toffee bits in the topping. Personally, I like the taste of toffee with milk chocolate rather than regular semi-sweet, so I have used either milk chocolate chips, or else I "chunk up" a large bar of milk chocolate.  Also, making these with fat-free sweetened condensed milk does not change the taste one bit.  My family doesn't like nuts, so I leave them out.  TRY THEM! They are fabulous!

I made these for our New Year's party and they were a big hit. Easy to make too! I used mini-chocolate chips instead of the big ones and it turned out very well. And, I accidentally left them in the oven a little long, but they still turned out great! Definintely mistake proof! Very good!

This is a very tasty,easy alternative and very nice change from your everyday choc. chip cookie! The recipe is easy to follow with delicious results.  I made each serving size quite small, with this recipe yeilding about 60 servings.  Small servings due to the VERY rich and flavorful bars. I was impressed with how easy this recipe is and even more impressed with the end result! *I added all the toffee bits to the top during the last baking step as I didn't want hard crunchy candy texture on top & added additional 1/2 cup chopped pecans to top layer for final baking as well*

Followed the recipe EXACTLY (I even measured out the chips instead of just dumping them in) and they look exactly like that cute little picture, but these should be called "un-inspired chocolate chip bars". There is very little actual toffee flavor and the bar has just a mediocre taste. I was certainly under-impressed. I have no idea what all the rave reviews are for and why this is considered "super" rich. Please! This wasn't even as sweet as a regular candy bar. Which is surprising when you look at all of the sweet things that go in it. But I looked at the recipe 20 times since then wondering how I could have such a different experience. But nope...I did it right.

THE MOST REQUESTED DESSERT RECIPE EVER and hands down all-time family favorite.  I've made bunches and bunches of times and they freeze well, too!!  This one is dangerous for me to have in the freezer, however, because I crave them just knowing in they're available.  My husband is not a sweet eater, but he LOVES these and cannot resist.

At our house we refer to these as "Sinful Bars".  They are very rich and thick, and fantastically delicious.  They also freeze well and stay fresh-tasting for quite a long time after being defrosted, if you can keep them around long enough to prove it!  We LOVE these bars!!!

I made these to take to a party. I did omit the nuts. I think these are good but I'm just not crazy about the sweetened condensed milk in them for some reason. I wonder what it would be like with a jar of caramel sauce poured over instead of the milk...I may try that :) But, it's obviously all up to individual tastes. Looking at the reviews, most people loved them. I liked them but don't think I'd make them "as is" again, I may try the caramel :) Thanks for posting!

Absolutely delish!!  It's a great candy bar that's so easy to make!  I got a little mixed up with all of the ingredients that needed to be reserved to make different layers.  I put the remaining toffee bits on before the final baking, but that didn't matter! The results were still great!  The sweetened milk mixes with the crust to create a caramel-ish layer.  I had to refer back to the recipe, because I wasn't sure if I had added any caramel and just forgot!  I highly recommend this recipe.  :)

Great!  VERY rich - a little goes a long way.  These are fantastic with pecans.  I also used an 8 oz. bag of Heath toffee bits (measured as 1 1/2 cups), and just omitted the 1/4 cup that you put on top at the end.  The bars were so chocolately, it wasn't even missed.  Be sure and turn down your oven 25 degrees if using a dark pan.  I forgot to, and the bars were hard on the edges - my fault.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent bar recipe.  I took these to work and the office devoured them.  They are rich and delicious and simple to make.  Cut them in small squares.

My diabetic father-in-law loves these cookies and has me warn him a week in advance on when I will be bringing these over.  Everyone in the family enjoys these, but like others have said...these are very sweet!  A little bit goes a long way.  I will make this cookie often and the extended family looks forward to these at Christmas.

Prefer another 7 layer cookie that sticks together better.  These seemed a little powdery.  Extremely hard to cut after being in the fridge, so give yourself time to get room temperature before slicing.

Nice, tasyy recipe.  Only four stars because, although simple and yummy it isn't much more than a glorified chocolate chip cookie and I was looking for a little more pizzaz  - I was looking for something to serve to guests on special occasions!  However, I WILL be making it again for any-old-time moments :)

when fresh from the oven these are impossibly and intolerably sweet.   my brother, husband and i couldnt eat even a square, and trust me, we can eat.  however....when they are completely cooled, these are fabulous and terribly addictive.   very dangerous to have around.  this is for crazy sweet toothed folks.

These are the best!!  I've been making these for about 10 years now and everyone who eats them loves them!!  They are very easy to make.  I use my kitchen aid stand mixer to cut in the butter and use mini chips.  My family prefers the minis in these bars over the regular chips.

I loved these.  They were easy to make, (don't melt the butter).  I was a little worried about them being too sweet so I cut the toffee in half.  They were still great and would probably have been great with all the toffee.

This was absolutely delicious! It is very very sweet, so its best cut into little bars but they were a huge hit with everyone that tried them. I used a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and a cup of nestle swirled caramel and chocolate chips. It was absolutely phenomenal, i will definately be making this often.

People will remember these! And so will you. The recipe is simple to follow and the product is gooey and decadent. If you like gooey chocolate confections, watch out...It's hard to stop eating them once you start! Note: The cooking time is correct, but the dough does not, in my experience, become golden brown as the recipes states. So just take them out at 25-30 min. and not a moment later - the dough will dry out otherwise.

Very sweet. Tastes even better when heated up with ice-cream.

AWESOME!  I made them for a Super Bowl party and they were gobbled up!  Had leftovers and brought them to work.  Everyone loves them!  Good idea to cut into small pieces, as they are very rich.  I used toffee bits, and milk chocolate chips and pecans.  Wonderful!!!  Will definitely make again, though to me they were a little labor intensive!

I was on a hunt for this recipe because I was dying to make it and found it! Now everywhere I go, people ask me to bring it! Ver rich. Cut into small pieces.

All I can say is... Holy sweet tooth!  I think these are possibly the best cookie bars I have ever made.  Congrats to the bakers at Hershey's Kitchens!  This recipe is so simple and delicious.  I took this to a pot luck and they were gobbled up.  Make sure to cut them extra small, because they are so rich.  I used Hershey's Almond Toffee chips and milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  I also used chopped walnuts and pecans, so the recipe ended up having 3 kinds of nuts.  Very yummy!!

Okay, these are ridiculously delicious and awesome and so easy to make! The sweetened condensed milk is a unique, decadent addition that really enhances the moistness and toffee flavor. I have no control around these bars! If you love chocolate and toffee this is it. I bought 7 SKOR bars and crushed them up, because I've never seen SKOR Bits sold anywhere.

These are a "one size fits all" dessert, as they seem to appeal to both children and those with a more discriminating palate.  They are very rich, so I recommend cutting the bars really small.  I also cut back on the brown sugar slightly.

These are my new favorite cookies! Do you have any idea how hard it is to not gobble these down until you get sick? I had to bag a few for myself & keep them hidden so the cookie monster wouldn't get them (my husband). Would make a great gift.

These bars are delicious! I did not pack the brown sugar and they were still very sweet. I am going to reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup unpacked next time.

With all the good reviews, I thought these would be better. The shortbread chocolate chip crust was too dry for my taste. Won't make these again.

Outstanding! A little bit of a pain to make (with all the separating of ingredients, cutting in the butter, etc) but very worth the effort, and I had all ingredients onhand! Very addictive and appreciated by all who sampled some (over and over again!) I did spray my pyrex dish prior to filling.

extremely rich and sinful.  I am so glad I am intending these for a giveaway to the neighbors, as I would not trust myself.  I was intrigued by the crust and it proved to be a winner; tasted like butter toffee all in itself.  Didn't have toffee chips so subbed butterscotch morsels and it was not disappointing.  I didn't want to overbake and end up with a hard crust so followed the recommended baking time and although I was a bit leary, followed instinct and took them out.  After cooling completely they cut perfectly and crust was just right on spot.  Cut into small pieces since these are very rich.  Great easy recipe.

This was great.  I accidently added the toffee to the top before cooking, but it didn't burn or anything and it tasted great.  I will make this again :)

These bars were quick to prepare, and tasted great. I thought there was too much chocolate, though, to the point that the toffee flavor got lost. When I make these again, I think I'll omit the last sprinkling of chocolate chips on top, and maybe even cut back on the chips in the dough, so the flavors are more balanced. Thanks for sharing!

Very good! Extremely rich, and very tasty. These got completely demolished when I took them into work,  but I'm only rating them a 4 because they weren't as exciting to me as I had anticipated, but still very good, and loved by all.

I made this recipe for my jobs annual Bake-off and won. I didn't try it myself because of all the sugar but got great reviews from my co-workers.

I made these for christmas. I think they are delicous but I could not get my children to like them. Strange since they are stuffed with candy pieces and chocolate! I give them 4 stars....my kids would probally give them 1 star

Very delicious and sweet. I used butterscotch chips instead of toffee, only because i was out and it tasted yummy. i also used half white chocolate chips half semi sweet.

These taste pretty good but they were too gooey at first--I refridgerated them overnight and they were too hard--after sitting out for a while they were pretty good.  The edges around the pan get a little crunchy  but all in all this recipe tastes really good.  It's certainly a recipe for those who have a sweet tooth!

Very yummy. I will definitely make them again. The ones around the edges are not as good as the "crustless" ones because the toffee around the edge got a little too hard.

These are wonderful!  I like them even better than Magic Bars.  I doubled the recipe and made them for work and they got gobbled up in no time.  My store didn't have the Skors chips, so I used Heath chips instead and I'm sure it was just as good.  And pretty easy.

It's hard to botch this recipe.  The person who gave it to me wrote 2/3 C. flour instead of 2 1/3.  When I saw how gooey the texture was after step 2, I used all the mixture on the bottom crust.  Because there was so much butter and less flour, I baked the crust for approx. 7 minutes instead of ten and took out the final product after 23 minutes instead of 25-30. None of this made any difference.  These were a huge hit at my work's Goodie Day!

These were good, the ones in the center of the pan, the best.  I used a metal pan and the edges were overcooked, I am wondering if a glass pan would have made much difference.  But I think for all the work involved and the overcooked edges that I would rather make Hello Dollies which are just as good.

These are amazing! I bake all the time and I am usually immune to temptation, but even I can't resist them. The first time I made them, my husband claimed he didn't like toffee or nuts, and now he begs me to make them for every party we go to! They're easy and sooo good!

These bars are wonderful.  They are definately rich but not too rich.  This is a cookie recipe that I know I will use a lot!

four stars only because the directions are confusing - I didn't realize until too late that I was supposed to split the crumbs. very delicious.

These sent everyone to Cookie Nirvana!!!! Quite easy, love the fact they don't require shaping/cutting, or  rolling, or none of that stuff. Easy. I got MANY requests for the recipe for these.
