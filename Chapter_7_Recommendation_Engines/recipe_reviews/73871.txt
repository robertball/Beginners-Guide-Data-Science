I used this recipe (minus the peppers) for the sauce on a thai chicken pizza.

Despite my initial reservations while cooking this dip, it  was very well received at the party I brought it to. One friend liked it so much she said she could eat it with a spoon. Although it is not all that visually appealing, it makes up for it in flavour and uniqueness. I used red thai curry paste instead of red chilis and I used hoisin sauce instead of fish sauce (personal preference). Nice when you want something different.

This was delicious.  A lot of people requested the recipe.  If you are looking for something different from the normal old boring dips, this is it.  I did add abit more chili because we like it hot.

This recipe is awesome!  I added green curry paste to give it extra heat and used it in lettuce wraps.

If your guests like Thai food, they'll love this dip - it's different, tasty and fairly easy. I added green curry paste, more thai chilis and a little more chunky PB. We didn't like it with the shrimp crackers, but loved it with bread and black pepper flavored water biscuit crackers.

I added basil and while cooking the chicken a little bit of green thai curry paste. It was fabulous.

I have been making this for years and I am always asked for the recipe. It is very original and people are amazed at how good it tastes. Use red pepper flakes or regular mint if you don't have what is called for. I serve it with cut up pita bread or pita chips.

1st of all this was not hot. I ended up putting 1/2 heaping teaspoon of red pepper flakes in after it was done because it wasn't spicy.  Even with that addition it wasn't that hot. Some people didn't like the sweetness and one person I heard say, "Peanut butter? "  Maybe she was allergic to peanut butter, I don't know, but she didn't eat any of it. Won't make this one again I can assure you.

My boyfriend and I LOOOOOVE this dish. We follow the exact recipe except we omit the chile peppers (I can't tolerate it; my BF adds extra crushed red pepper to his dish). It's so easy to make and has become our go-to when we're stuck on ideas for dinner.

It was fine but was kind of bland. It just tasted like peanut butter and coconut. It needed more kick.  People at the party didn't seem to know what to do with it. We're going to try it today over rice.

This is the first Allrecipes recipe that I have gone wrong with. Usually the ratings always tell the truth, but I have to say, I really did not like this dip. People at the party I brought it to ate it politely, but definitely not a keeper and I threw away the rest. I tried to make into lettuce wraps, but even that wasn't great. Very greasy between the coconut cream and peanut butter.

We just loved it with bread toast! Used textured vegetable protein.

This is similar to a recipe my sister-in-law used to make from Thailand. I add more Thai peppers, a little soy sauce and cooked, ground rice as well. I serve it with cabbage leaves to help cool the fire from the Thai peppers. Sis never made it with peanut butter, coconut cream or mint, so I didn't add them. Not sure if it is fair to rate this recipe, but it is the only one I found even remotely close to hers. So thank you for sharing.

This was good and creamy.  It's definitely not a mainstream type of dip that would appeal to a lot of people.  I could eat only so much of it as a dip, so I added some peas and ate it with rice.  Also, the coconut cream was a bit overpowering, and I only used 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.

After initial cook/taste, added more of non-chicken items to make it creamier, smoother, stronger flavor.
I like it. wife wont touch because of the appearance.
