Added a roasted onion and instead of adding heavy cream I topped it with some crème fraîche and chives. It was deliciously warm and comforting and I fell asleep soon after consuming it!

It was bland with a color and consistency that reminded us of baby food.

Great flavors, and perfect garnishes (I added creme fraiche as well, it was wonderful). If it's bland, add salt (and cayenne). Mine required a lot of salt. I added a bit more water to thin it out. I didn't think mine needed straining.

I sweated some onions and garlic first and then made as directed without the heavy cream

I halved the  the recipe but otherwise followed as written.  It comes together easily. The parsnips have a surprisingly sweet flavor so using the bleu cheese croutons provides a nice counter balance of flavors.  My soup turned out very thick so perhaps an increase of additional stock or water is in order. I would make it again.

I loved this! My first time eating parsnips they were oven roasted and undercooked - tough and fibrous cubes of too much of anise flavor. This soup really opens up the true flavor of parsnips, and the light sweetness of the apple pairs beautifully well. I’ve almost never had a need to substitute things in any of chef John’s recipes (unless specified by Chef John himself to experiment).

I used 4 cups chicken broth & 3 cups water. Added 1/2 teaspoon salt at the end.
