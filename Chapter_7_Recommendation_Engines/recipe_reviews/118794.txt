Hey I worked in my father's restaurant for a long time and we made onion rings. Running out of onion rings was a big problem because the batter would fall off if you didn't let it sit in the refrigerator before frying (at least 20 minutes). Soaking the onions in ice water would help the breading stick (a lot better than doubling up on the flour and breading) but it still wouldn't stick as well as letting them sit in the refrigerator. Of course we only used flour, water and breading. Thus, I recommend omitting the ice water step but place the prepared onion rings in the refrigerator for 30 minutes prior to baking. I think this should help the problem of the batter falling off.

These turned out really well.  It's nice that they are not fried and still crispy.  The trick is to beat the egg whites for at least two minutes until they have stiff peaks.     Make sure you only put a little of the bread crumb mixture at a time in the bag because as it got wet it didn't stick well.  It needs to be dry.   I needed get rid of the wet stuff and make a little more.  Next time I will know.

I modified several steps of this recipe..I chose to not use the resealable bags, but instead used bowls. I did not soak the onions in ice water (didn't see the point). I dipped in egg mixture and then into flour and then finally into a bread crumb/corn flake crumbs mixture. It helped to dip twice to make the coating thicker. I drizzled a bit of olive oil into the baking dish and baked according to original recipe....VERY GOOD!! Next time I will try without the olive oil to see if they get as crispy. Sprinkled with parmesan/romano hot out of the oven! Yum!

i'm a HUGE fan of fried onion rings but this baked version was excellent!!! and not greasy at all. i also didn't use the bag method - just dipped them in a bowl with bread crumbs mixed with garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, parsley flakes, salt, and pepper (minus the thyme). i will make these again very soon cuz all i have left in my house are onions :)

These onion rings turned out fantastic being they are baked! Don't get me wrong, of course fried deliver an entirely different flavor, but this recipe is a wonderful alternative, and healthy too! I used my whisk for the egg whites, I beat until frothy. I also used Progresso Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so you may want to cut down on the salt that's added. I love salt so it didn't bother me, but I could see this being salty to others if using seasoned crumbs. I also very lightly greased the baking sheet with olive oil, and it worked great! I will definitely make these often, thanks! :)

Great baked onion ring, satisfied my onion ring craving!  I used bowls instead of plastic bags but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The breading stuck to the onions just fine.  I think problem people have had with the breading sticking comes from the egg whites not being whipped enough. The foaminess of the egg whites should be very fine, and almost to soft peak stage.

I agree with other reviewers who say that the trick is to beat the egg whites to stiff-peak stage- it helps the crumbs stick better. Also, i went with the bowl method instead of a bag and got great results. A good trick to use to prevent "club fingers" is to use one hand for the "wet" and the other for the "dry", preventing any cross between the two.  Overall, I gave this a 4. The texture was good and the rings browned nicely- it was very good for a baked recipe. I think next time I'm going to try panko breadcrumbs to see if I can get a different texture, as that was the only thing that didn't please me. I'll definitely be trying this one again!

Breading problem - Like other reviewers, the breading didn't seem to want to stick on the rings. We ate them anyway, and they were okay, but probably won't use this recipe again. Is there a trick other cooks used to make the breading stick?

VERY good.  A heathy alternative to a deep fried favorite.  I added dome different spices and used some baking powder and flour in the bread crumbs.  They came out crunchy and delicious. I also double dipped them into the egg and bread crumbs for a thicker coating. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Following previous reviews I beat the egg whites to a soft peak and they truned out really well.  I had no problems with the breadcrumbs sticking to the onions.  Next time I will slice the onions a little thicker and add some parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs.

These were AMAZING!! I'd give them 10 stars if I could!! I love onion rings but they do NOT fit into my diet so I decided to try these. Even my 5 year old loved them! I made them tonight & he wanted seconds! Since we were out (I scaled down the recipe) he asked if I'd make them tomorrow! I didn't do the bag method - I used 2 bowls. One for the breadcrumbs, one for the egg.  I also used egg whites & not the entire egg to make them even more figure friendly.  I did double dip them though - dipped in egg then crumbs, back in the egg & back in the crumbs. Had no problems with them sticking either - they were perfect.  I didn't have thyme so I used S & P, Paprika & some Garlic Powder. They were FANTASTIC! Thanks for such an awesome recipe - this one will be a staple in my house for appetizer night & football nights! My husband can't wait to try them once he's off night shifts!

I read the reviews first, and I am glad I did.  I skipped the bags and just used a couple of bowls for dipping.   I beat the eggs only until foamy because I was doing it by hand and I was in a hurry.  Being in a hurry I also skipped both the ice water AND refrigeration tips.  I used season salt, granulated garlic, and paprika to season my crumbs (just a personal preference, I don't like thyme).  While it wasn't a heavy batter I had no trouble getting it to stay on(and I like a thinner crust anyways, so it worked perfect for us), and it baked up nice and crisp, though I did give them a quick spray of Pam before putting them in.  My kids and my husband and I loved them, and will definitely have them often!

These were absolutely delicious, it was great to eat onion rings without grease. Did have some leftovers from the other night, reheated in oven and tasted great.

I thought these were really good. I didnt soak my onion rings because I was too hungry :) It does make a thin crispy onion ring, so if you are looking for a thick batter, this is not for you. But I liked it a lot and will make again! Thanks for a healthier version!

The taste is fine, but the breading didn't stay on.  In no rush to make again.

I have been a member of this site for years but this is my first review.  The reason I feel so compelled to review this recipe is to save others the disappointment, the time and the ingredients necessary to make a total failure of a recipe.  I read all other reviews and tried all methods suggested, e.g. 30 minutes in the fridge / double dipping in batter / baking / -  even tried frying etc.  There is NOTHING that can make this an acceptable version of "Onion Rings".  I notice that one other Irish (?) person (dublinireland05) wasn't too complimentary about this dish either! I can't say that Irish people have better onion rings. Some of the best I have tasted have been right here in the US but do yourself a favor and seek another recipe.   This is a version I will not make  again.

Since I am trying to cut calories and fat, I am not frying anything. This recipe lets me get that "almost" fried onion ring taste. The onions really are delicious and crispy. I skipped the 3 bags step but now see the need for them. The breading gets clumpy and won't stick to the onions. Next time I'll follow directions!

I couldn't get the breading to stick but I think I'm at fault - probably didn't beat the egg whites long enough. However, they did taste pretty good, considering it's a healthier version of the greasy, fried rings. Following the advice of my father, I coated the onions with cornstarch, then dipped it in egg white, and finally in the bread crumbs. Thankfully, the breading did stick to the onions.

The bread crumbs did not adhere to the onion rings very well; HOWEVER, even though they didn't look that great before baking, they did crisp up nicely and were pretty good.  I used Vidalia onions, and even though I wasn't that happy with the whole process, I'll make them again, but try something different to get the bread crumbs to adhere.

These were good...followed instructions exactly. Although crispy, some of the coating didn't quite stick. Fried are definitely still my favorite, but since I don't fry at home, these are a nice alternative. Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I loved these. Used flour rather than bread crumbs and as suggested by another reviewer drizzled with olive oil b/f putting in oven. Also used the hint to refrigerate sliced onions for 30 minutes before processing. Rings were crunchy and delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

Thanks!  Finally I have found  a recipe that keeps the breading on...and doens't allow it to fall off when I take a bite.  I followed the recipe excatly ...but baked some and fried some.  I think it must be the whipped egg whites that do the trick.

This didn't work for me at all.  Breading didn't stick to the onions, and so we just had scantilly breaded baked onions.  Perhaps there is not substitute for frying.

These were surprisingly good, considering they were baked, not battered and fried.
Definitely whip the egg whites to soft peaks, it really will make all the difference.
I added a little extra pepper and some chile powder to my breadcrumb mix to give them an added kick. They were delicious.
My boyfriend poo-pooed this when I told him what I was making, but once he tried them he agreed they were pretty darn good for something low fat, and proceeded to eat at least half of them.

Not amazing, but not bad. I might make again, although it sure took a lot of effort to do each individual onion ring.

We were making burgers but didnt have anything to go with them so decided to try this recipe, and what a pleasant surprise! Honestly, I wasnt expecting much, but these onion rings taste just as good, if not better than their fried counterparts.  I actually used fish fry instead of bread crumbs, so mine may have been saltier than the original recipe, but I still enjoyed them alot (and so did my family!) And yes, breading the onions was sort of difficult, but I always find it difficult to bread things, so this was not a surprise...will make these again the next time we have burgers.

Eh.  The flavor was good, but it took a lot of time dipping one ring in the mixtures at a time.  So I got lazy and grabbed a whole handful and put them all in the egg mixture & then tried to coat them in the bowl of dry ingredients together.  That method is not suggested!  :-)  I will try these again if I have the time to do one ring at a time - or can think of a quicker way that might work better.

These were surprisingly good considering how low fat they are; not greasy in the least! I followed the suggestion of others by using bowls instead of bags. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt & 1/2 regular paprika & 1/2 smoked paprika. The flavor was amazing! Hubby loved them too. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Severe Breading Problem If you follow directions to a tee. If you are hoping they will taste like your favorite fried Onion Rings then don't waste you time here.

i used my standing mixer to form the stiff peaks and a bowl for the seasoned breadcrumbs. start w/ a small amount of bread crumbs & add more as you go because they dont stick as well when they get eggy. before they were cooked they didnt look coated enough but they turned out really good once they came out of the oven. sprayed them with pam to ensure they got crispy. they made a perfect side for slow cooker buffalo chix sandwiches. also served w/ celery sticks and homemade ranch dressing.

This didn't do it for us at all. The coating wouldn't stick to the onion, and the flavour was bland.
