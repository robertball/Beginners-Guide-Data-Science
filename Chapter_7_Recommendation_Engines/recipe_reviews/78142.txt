This is one of the best chicken dishes I've ever made.  Of course, you do need to season most things you cook with salt and pepper.  My 11yr old that never eats leftovers loved these. Luckily he shared them with me. My version I cooked the mushrooms, onions and garlic in the pan after I cooked the chicken.  Yes it did take me about 5 extra minutes, but as you can tell, well worth it.  Thanx CELIADAYAGI.

This recipe was GREAT! I don't like mushrooms that much, but the mixture of garlic and onion with them made them delicious! I also cooked the mixture in the same pan as the chicken, and it gave the chicken a stronger taste. I would definitely recommend this refreshing, easy recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  I try to minimize the clean up so after reading the other reviews I took their advice and cooked everything from stovetop to oven all in one pan, I also pounded the chicken.  I reminded me a little of Chicken Saltimbocca.  My husband and I decided this is definately a keeper.

This is VERY similar to a recipe I have made since I was able to reach the stove. I LOVE IT! I have found that it is excellent w/ any cheese you have in the house or even without cheese. Since I am addicted to cheese, I even stuff in in the center of the chicken breast with the mushrooms and onions - DELICIOUS!

This was very good and simple to prepare.  I pounded the chicken breasts before cooking them and they were very tender.  I also prepared the entire dish in one skillet.  I just covered the skillet for the last 5 minutes with the chicken, onions, mushrooms and cheese.  It worked perfectly, made little mess and was liked by all!

Very tasty! Dish was easy to prepare in a very short time.  I used only 1 oven safe skillet to prepare entire dish, which made for easy cleanup.  I added salt and pepper to chicken as well as vegetables while frying.  Also added 1Tblsp butter to olive oil to help brown and flavor the chicken.

I followed the directions and my chicken came out rubbery. It took longer to cook than the time on the recipe. My family did not like it. The flavor was bland.

Great recipe and easy. I dredged the chicken in Panko crumbs with some sage and garlic salt to give a little more texture and flavor. I had small breasts,so they all cooked evenly, otherwise I would have pounded them thinner. I also added white wine when I added the mushrooms (so the absorb the Flavor) and it was wonderful. A definite keeper!!

My mushrooms went bad before I had a chance to make this. So I had to use bellpeppers instead. I love how quick it is. I thought it was OK. My husband loved it.

Bell Peppers, Onions and any other item that you especially like would go great in this item.  I would use a pan that will work on the stove and in the stove.
  I'd also remove the chicken from the pan and cook the vegetables in the same pan. 
  Why use two or three pans when one will do?  Takes about 5 extra minutes

This was a very good quick chicken dinner.  i did everything in the same oven safe pan and i used munster cheese insted of mozzarella.  i also added some leftover zuccini and yellow squash that i pan fried the night before.  it was tasty but my husband and i both agree that sauteeing the veggies with white wine would be even better.  this ones deffinatly a keeper!!

This was surprisingly good.  I was in a hurry with no ideas for dinner so I did a quick search for chicken recipes.  This sounded easy and had good reviews so I tried it.  I did not have fresh mushrooms, so I used a can.  The only cheese I had on hand was a Mexican blend, so I used that instead.  I sauteed the mushrooms, onion and garlic as long as I did the chicken - almost caramelizing them.  After I cooked the chicken, I moved it to a baking dish, spooned the mushrooms & onions on top then covered them with the cheese.  My husband and I both really liked it.

I was worried this would be bland, but it wasn't....just make sure you have some SALT handy! I made this all in ONE large pan starting with the chicken and onions, then adding the rest after they cooked.  Used LEFTOVERS in my spaghetti sauce !!  Just chopped everything up, put it in my sauce and let it simmer for a while.  Would have been even more flavorful if I had added Italian sausage to the sauce also!

Excellent quick fix meal! It actually tastes like you spent hours instead of minutes making it. I pounded out the breasts and sprinkled with Adobo seasoning and I didn't cut the chicken in half or in pieces but instead left them whole. Other than that I followed the recipe as written

This was very good! I used a frozen "mushroom medley" from Trader Joe's as well as a few fresh sliced white mushrooms, and it really amped up the flavor. The only down side for me is that this was really not a 20-minute dish. It takes much, much longer than 5 minutes to cook onions until they are soft. I spent at least 20 minutes just on that step alone because I wanted to get them somewhat caramelized, and it is worth the extra time spent doing that. I would make again, but plan ahead to spend that extra time on the onions.

I used this recipe tonight because I was looking for something simple and inexpensive for dinner. I was able to purchase all the ingredients that I needed for under $12, so that's a huge plus for me. I made a few changes, including using oregano, a few pinches of basil, and parsley on the chicken. I also cooked with butter and cut the chicken into smaller pieces. I cooked the chicken in one pan and the onions and mushrooms in another, then combined the two and sprinkled the cheese all over the top, covered a few minutes, stirred, put more cheese, covered and then stirred again. I used way more cheese than the recipe called for (I'm not exactly sure how much, because I don't measure anything), so it was very rich. Served with thin cut pepper/garlic potatoes. This dish is especially delicious if you eat it right after its done and the cheese is gooey and wonderful. I will definitely be making this again because it was absolutely delicious, easy, and cheap.

This was a tasty meal. I used the same stovetop pan to first cook the mushrooms and onions, set them aside in the baking dish, and then seasoned the chicken with Adobo, cut it into bite size pieces, and cooked them in the pan until no longer pink. Upon putting in the baking dish, I mixed everything together before putting the cheese on top. It was so much better already having everything cut and my husband loved it. Served it over whole grain brown rice.

I don't know how some reviewers could say the recipe was bland when you're putting garlic and onions in it.  I used chicken thighs and drumsticks with skin on and bone in for this recipe -- just needed to use them up.  Don't try this at home. It took me longer to cook them, and added too much fat to the recipe.  My mistake there.  I did add some seasonings (salt, pepper, and garlic powder) to the chicken before I cooked it.  I didn't have the cheese and didn't really miss it.  The only thing I'd really change from the original recipe is to use boneless skinless chicken thighs (I just like dark meat better).  I'm sure they'll cook a lot faster.  I also used an oven safe pan and agreed cooking the mushrooms, onion and garlic in the same pan the chicken was cooked in helped the flavors blend better!  This recipe is a keeper with me.  Can't wait to try it with the chicken thighs, and the cheese will make it that much better.  Thanks for this recipe, Celia!

I used chicken tenders instead and browned them longer. I also used more mushrooms and after they and the onions and garlic cloves (which I left intact and removed after finished) I added some butter and milk and then watered down cornstarch to make it a sauce I also added some salt. Put chicken in baking pan added mushroom gravy mixture and shredded colby-jack on top instead also. Served with chicken brothed basmati rice on the side. It is one of my favorite although it took longer to cook than the recipe claimed so not such a quick meal which is why I picked it in the first place.

I'm going to have to side with the others who said this was very bland.  And it took longer than 20 minutes because 5 minutes in the oven did not finish cooking it through.  With some help, this could be an OK dish.  You need to season the chicken with S&P before browning.  I would bypass the oil and use butter for better flavor, especially to help the onions, garlic and mushrooms-they were greasy and flavorless.  I think it would be better to saute the veggies, then hold them and do the chicken in the same pan, maybe add the veggies back in and deglaze with some white wine, then put it all into the bake dish.  This could also benefit from some herbs, maybe a little thyme...don't know that I'd bother to try this again though.

Loved it! A lot longer than 20 minutes to make but worth the wait. Put some Mrs. Dash on chicken to spice it up a bit and only had mixed cheddar. Next time I'm going to add a little more garlic. Will be making this dish many more times. Thanks for the great recipe. Kat

This was good but nothing special to me. It needed more seasoning. I loved all the mushrooms! I will take from this recipe but come up with my own twist on it. It is a good base recipe.

Great recipe! I was exausted after work one night, and didn't have the energy to make something over the top. This was perfect. It takes almost no time to throw together, yet tastes like you've been slaving for hours!

I've made this dish twice. It's a very easy, tasty recipe.
