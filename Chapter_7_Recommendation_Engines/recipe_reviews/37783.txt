Really good.  I added alot more curry powder to mine to make it more like a true curry.  Almost three times as much.  Great for leftovers!!

This was a good change from the usual turkey leftovers. However I did change a few of the ingredients. I used cream of chicken soup, fresh mushrooms and a lot more hot curry. We love spicey! I also added leftover peas to the rice. It made a sweet contrast to the spice of the curry. The thumbs were up for this recipe. You could easyily substitute chicken for the turkey. I will be making this again.

My hubby was in the mood for curry, and this did the trick.  When I tasted it before it simmered, I was skeptical, but it comes out tasting fairly authentic when all is said and done.  My 3-year-old refused to try it and just ate the rice until the end of the meal.  He then polished off two servings of it!  Thanks for a quick and good recipe.

Really liked this one! I added 2 handfuls of Craisins and a medium apple. I also used 2 tbsps curry (one hot one plain) and this dish was definitely a keeper. It makes me want to cook a turkey in the "off-season" just to eat it again. Thanks Clint!

Good recipe for the left overs...  I suggest you substitue rice with the left over stuffing... I added a little more curry than the recipe called for as the simmer time brings out the spice's full flavor...

My family and I thought this recipe was awsome... As with others, I used fresh mushrooms, added peas and red peppers for color, and a bit of garlic with extra curry for flavor. I served it with basmati rice but think I'll try it with pasta next time...Maybe penne? Thanks for helping me get rid of that leftover turkey!!!

We loved this dish!!! It was simple to make and very flavorful. I must admit that I added more curry powder than what the recipe called for (I used 3/4 teaspoon), and it tasted even better the next night. 
You can also serve this over toast, buttered and cubed. I also had it over some mashed potatoes and found it to be quite flavourful as well. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with everyone.

Great for left-overs.  I added more curry and a little hot sauce to spice it up.  I also substitued plain yogurt for the sour cream and used fresh mushrooms. We've always struggled with what to do with leftovers.  This recipe is a keeper.

I thought it was just okay. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding some frozen peas for color and veggie serving. We found that it needed a lot of salt and pepper, and won't make it again.

This was a wonderful change for the left overs!  The recipe was so easy that I allowed my eight year old daughter to make it.   The curry flavor was very mild, perfect for anyone that does not use it often.

This was a good, not great, option for the leftover turkey. Please don't be fooled by thinking this is any sort of Indian dish because curry is in the name. The curry flavor is extrememly mild. My alterations were to leave out the mushrooms and add half a can of water to it. We don't like sauces too thick. Thanks for the recipe, we'll probably make next year after Thanksgiving.

I suppose I used this recipe more as an idea or guide than anything else. I'm not quite sure why, other than I don't cook turkey often (last time was a decade ago). 
 I actually have made a recipe similar to this with leftover roasted chicken, and cream of chicken soup. 
 This made good use of 4 cups leftover turkey, as well as leftover homemade gravy (w/ white wine), homemade mushroom cream sauce ... hell, I even threw in a touch of Cranberry sauce with pears & ginger. I did use a can of cream of mushroom soup too. Much like the other cooks, I added way more curry -- about 2Â½ tablespoons, as well as some Garam Masala, and a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg. I threw in some onions,celery & carrots I'd roasted with my turkey, and two chopped apples.
 Like I said, I used this as an idea more than followed the recipe. I probably tossed in other stuff too ...

Very good. I just added a bit of Mrs Dash to it and quite a bit more curry since that is preferred here. It was a hit! I served it over noodles, which was also a hit! Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I was looking for leftover turkey recipes and came across this one.  We love curry, so I used 3 tablespoons, plus I added 1/4 cup coconut cream, the unsweetened kind.  I also used cream of chicken mushroom soup, left out the mushrooms, and added milk to cut the canned soup gloppiness.  It was a winner, there wasn't any left.  If you don't feel like making homemade curry, this is a quick and easy substitute on lazy days, with your own alterations!

Good way to use up leftover turkey.  I used leftover fried turkey, container of fresh mushrooms (YUM), and added green peas and colored bell peppers that I had in the freezer for extra color & taste.  I also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons curry powder and pepper to taste. 

Did not even taste like leftover Turkey!  Keeper

This was amazing, and so easy.  I added a little more curry since we like things a little hotter and I tossed in a hand full of frozen peas.   Perfect!!!

This recipe was an excellent start to my modified version. I used the turkey drippings and 1 can of coconut milk in place of the condensed mushroom soup, milk and sour cream and used fresh mushrooms and added 1 whole green pepper and salt to taste. It was awesome and most importantly very quick and easy!

Really, really good and easy to make. Took some other reviewers advice and added peas, made with chicken instead of turkey. Not very spicy, will add more curry next time, but it was still excellent.

I enjoyed this very much and the leftovers were AWESOME but I had to rate it four stars because of the changes I made.  I made it with (fake) burger crumbles and brown rice, and I upped the curry to 3 1/2 teaspoons.  It was easy and quick to make with ingredients that I tend to keep on hand.

I really liked both the flavor and the easiness of this recipe.  I didn't have any onion, so I melted the butter and added about 1 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and both my husband and I loved it.  Good recipe for a basic curry.

This was good.  I gave it five stars because it is a great way to give left over turkey a great spin.  The changes I made was I used buttermilk instead of sour cream (didn't want to go to the store), added some chopped up carrots and used a couple tablespoons for curry.  Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed this recipe, it didn't feel like we were using up leftover turkey!  It's a lot like hearty pot pie filling with a little zing from the curry.  We think it'll taste better over wheat pasta next time, although the rice is OK too.  We used skim milk, fat free sour cream, and fat free soup with no problems.  We also substituted cream of chicken since we were out of cream of mushroom, also with no problems.  As a shortcut I used dried minced onion with a little water, which gave us the onion flavor without the big chunks, and it worked out well.  Definitely a fun recipe to try!

Delicious!  I made a white sauce instead of canned soup, and doubled the curry; I plan to make it again, with four times the curry for more flavor.  Will try some of the other ideas next time, too.

This was pretty decent, but I would advise using a different meat. We felt the turkey smell and flavour overpowered the dish and didn't mix well with the curry flavour. The sauce was phenomenal, though. A real pity the turkey didn't work in it.

My husband cooked this up and it was easy and tasted great. We added extra curry powder (to taste) and since I forgot mushrooms at the store we added in peas. They gave it a nice taste and a bit of color. We will be making it again.

This was a great, easy recipe and very tasty.  I skipped the mushrooms and I was out of rice so I served over egg noodles. I also tried it on a toasted dinner roll which was better than the noodles.

This was a great & easy recipe, but we definately modified.  Used about 2 Tbsp of curry, one whole chopped onion, and fresh chopped portabella mushrooms (at least 1-1/3 cups) to complete everything.  But the end product was great.  It did need a little additional salt & pepper, but that is an individual taste kind of thing.  We will make this again.

Delicious! My husband raved about this one. I didn't have sour cream so I added a dab of yogurt and 1/2 can coconut milk. Wonderful

Fantastic receipe to use up the Christmas turkey which was left over. Made double the quantity to freeze. Put more curry powder like some of the other reviews but apart from this kept everything the same. Very tasty

Very good, quick and easy to make with items on hand. I used leftover turkey and pork, a little more curry to taste, and a garnish of coconut. Yum! Will be keeping this recipe!

Very easy to make.  This dish would be great in the hospital.  I added more curry powder to my individual dish than was in the recipe.  It reminded me of the mushroom and rice recipe that used to be on the can label.  I definitely will not fix this again.

This is excellent. I added more curry, we love spicy dishes and I used chicken. I serve it over Jasmine rice.  We love Indian and Thai food and this was nice variation of an authentic dish. We make this all the time.

Umm, this recipe was definitely NOT my favorite. If you like authentic indian, this is not the recipe for you either. I blame it on the cream of mushroom soup...if you really want to try this recipe anyway...go for cream of chicken, it probably wouldn't be quite as gross that way.

I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts in place of turkey and, like others, doubled the curry.  Delicious!

This was a very quick and easy recipe to make.  I loved the taste.  I followed what others said and increased the curry to 2 tablespoons.  I also used fresh mushrooms that I sautÃ©ed with the onions.  It was a great success.

Good basis for a recipe--nice way to use up leftovers. I omitted the mushrooms (Sweetie doesn't like them), doubled the onion, added about 1-1/2 c. frozen petite peas, tripled the curry powder (the add'l turmeric gave it a nice golden color) and put in some red pepper flakes for spice. Generously salted/peppered the rice too. Everyone (Sweetie, 4YO and 6YO sons and me) ate it up. Thanks!

Very nice, quick meal.  I added some frozen peas just long enough before serving to let them cook through. It extended the recipe a bit, added some color and also cut the richness just a bit.  Thanks. It's a keeper.

We really liked this. I did add more curry, 1 full tsp., and I also added red cooking wine to the mushroom soup and the flavor was great. I served it over rice but I think it might be very good over biscuts too.  My husband said he could use more curry but it was enough for me :o). Will definitely make this dish again and with other leftover meats.

Good way to use leftover turkey but definitely needs another tablespoon of curry and some pepper.  I added peas and topped
with french fried onions which I broiled to crisp.  Gave it much
better flavor.  I also cooked my rice with bouillon in the water.

This Recipe was a great way to get rid of leftover Turkey from Thanksgiving and it is different than the same ole Pot Pie.  My husband loved this and couldn't wait to take the leftovers to work the next day. I did add another tablespoon of Curry though. Gave it more of a kick.

Very easy to prepare and very good. I didn't have any sour cream so I used a squirt of Light ranch dressing and tripled the curry as some of the others did. I also added carrots and celery which I cut up "Asian" style it was really tasty!

Excellent though I did make a few additions and subs.  I subbed yogurt for the sour cream, added some garlic to the onion during the last minute of the saute , added a touch of red curry paste as well a bit of turmeric.  Overall a great recipe, highly recommended.

Great keeper recipe.  Great "cleanout the fridge" dish....and pick the few leftover garden veggies (carrots/beans)  Steamed carrots and green beans.  Carmelized red onions, then added wrinkled red pepper and cremini mushrooms....added some spices...Mrs Dash, cumin etc.    In separate bowl, mixed cream of broccoli soup with sour cream and bit of blue cheese, along with spices (curry, cinnamon, gara marsala)  Added turkey and mixture to frypan veggies....all while rice was cooking.   Sprinkled more blue cheese on top.   ....might have included some leftover gravy from pork tenderloin and another bowl of veggies too.....  This is a keeper.   Can imagine what adding some white wine to that sauce would be like.    Oh, almost forgot, loosened up the sauce using low fat evaporated milk cause there was no milk in the fridge......  Had fun making this one.

1st time i made it, according recipe, very bland, a turkey stroganoff. Still thought it had potential, based on ingredients. 2nd, time, i ramped it up a little. Way more curry(added curry until it was a pale yellow, perfect for me), added way more onions(thinly sliced, not minced, and sautÃ©ed), more salt and a pinch of sweetness to mimic dried fruit found in some curries. I also used coconut milk instead of milk. I added everything to taste, so I can't give exact measurements, but 2nd time was great. Smooth, creamy, a touch spicy, very good.

I am always looking for different recipes for leftover turkey.  This recipe is easy and doesn't take long.  The amount of curry called for in the recipe is just right but if you like your food spicy, you may want to add some more.

Not much into curry, but wow, leftover turkey never tasted so good! I didn't have any mushrooms but the mushroom soup was enough. Followed everything else as written and it was delish!

This is similar to my all time favorite leftover turkey recipe "Quick Curry Turkey" - it came from a Better Homes and Gardens cookbook I received as a wedding present in 1976.  I usually add more curry(at least 1 T) cayenne pepper and Accent seasoning.
Everyone who tries it loves it!!!

Good and easy way to use turkey leftovers and easy to adjust to your own preferences,  In response to the reviews, I tripled the quantity of curry and added some green peas.

This is a tasty recipe, but to spice it up a bit more, I added more curry and then added some turmeric and garam masala. It turned out great and the whole family loved it.

We really liked this recipe.  I had some very dry leftover turkey and this recipe made it come alive again.  When I made it a second time I added more curry powder (1 1/2 teas)- it tasted even better.

Very bland, I had to double the curry and add salt and pepper, but still was missing that something extra.  Taste better the second day.

I needed something to use up leftover baked turkey breast, so I stopped at Sprouts and picked up some mushrooms and their organic cream of mushroom soup (it has no MSG and ingredients you can read).  I used fresh crimini mushrooms, about half the sour cream, added some paprika and some Tajin to "up" the flavor, and subbed white wine in place of the milk.  It made for a flavorful dinner tonight----total comfort food when put over sticky rice.  I was surprised it didn't have a photo since its first review dating back to 2001!  I'd make this again for sure!  Thanks, BRNDIRT!

Be happily warned that this is not calorie free or one of those "lite" meals. So, in order to in some small way make myself feel good about making this, I added a can of peas. Strip down the turkey or store bought turkey breast right after the meal or when you bring it home. It is much easier than after it is has been in the fridge overnight.

This was pretty good. Comfort food with a twist, and a great way to use leftovers. I did make some changes - extra curry powder, white pepper, and a dash of ground red pepper; added some celery and peas to up my veggie intake. Might not be too authentic, but still tasty.

I am sorry, but neither I nor my family liked this recipe.  I made it exactly as written, but when nobody liked it, we tried to add more curry, then when this did not improve the dish, we started to add all sorts of spices.  We just couldn't get it to work fo us.  Thank you for sharing, though.

Really good. I also used a bit more curry, and a little extra milk. The flavor is great and it's fast and easy to make. Thanks for an idea to get rid of my leftover turkey. BTW, My family loved it.

This was pretty good--everyone liked it.  I did double up on the curry powder like many other reviewers suggested.  Also added a few handfuls of frozen peas.

I'm always looking for quick and tasty weeknight meals and this fits the bill perfectly.  I used turkey breasts that I had thrown on the BBQ the night before in anticipation of making this.  I used about 3 tsp of mild curry paste and added frozen peas and chopped red pepper.  This is now one of my stand-bys.  Thanks!

Easy, a little different, good if you like bland-ish food.  After reading some reviews, tried to liven it up a little by doubling the curry, adding boullion to the rice cooking water, chopped veggies, and used cream of celery soup.  Very, very bland.  It's not a BAD recipe, but definitely for those that like very mild food.  Visually, it's not all that appealing either.

This is the BEST leftovers recipes I've ever made. Like everyone else, I added a lot more curry powder than called for. This was a big hit in my house.
