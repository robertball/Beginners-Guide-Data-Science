Quick and easy. BIG HINT: Let the syrup mixture boil (and I mean rolling boil) for 3 minutes. This will let the syrup turn into a fudgy binding that WILL set up in the fridge. Just make sure it doesn't boil over. If you do that, they will set perfectly every time.

These are fantastic. So delicious! I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used regular cow's milk instead. Very good recipe.

These are frighteningly addicting!  Needed to use up some evaporated milk and came across this recipe.  Accidentally skipped the vanilla and did 2 scant cups of sugar.  I let it boil for a couple minutes to be sure the sugar dissolved, stirring constantly.  I dropped these onto wax paper on cookie sheets and made them pretty small and let them set up in the freezer for about 15 minutes and they were perfect!  Better go eat my tenth one now!

Since I don't like peanut butter and my husband and kids don't like coconut, I thought this recipe was a good option. 

 As I started making a batch, I realized that I didn't have any cocoa powder.  I'm not a chocoholic, so I simply made this batch without any cocoa.  
  In addition to not using the cocoa powder, I decreased the sugar to just 1 1/2 cups, and added the salt and vanilla to the butter/milk/sugar mixture.  I also omitted the nuts and added another cup of oats. I had read previous reviews that indicated their cookies were gooey and didn't set up, hence substituting the additional oats for the nuts.  

I also let the liquid mixture boil for two minutes.  DO NOT OVERBOIL, THOUGH!

Lastly, because my kids love chocolate, I sprinkled mini M&Ms on the tops of the cookies.  Do NOT stir the M&Ms into the hot mixture, they will melt.  I did need to push the mini M&Ms into the cookies a little bit so that they wouldn't fall to the base of the cookies.

All in all, I think my version is tasty and colorful.  You can use certain color M&Ms for holidays and use school colors for bake sales and sporting events. 

One last hint.  My kids went wild when they saw the finished product, but I needed the cookies to cool off.  When they weren't looking, I simply placed my wax paper lined cookie sheet (with the cooling cookies) into our (cold) oven and set the timer for 30 minutes.  I found this to be a great way to hide the temptation until the cookies were truly ready.

I wanted to make these because I had some at a babyshower recently and they were so good. 
I made this recipe today and they didn't quite turn out right. The cookies never "set" so I had to throw all 3 dozen away. They turned out sticky and gooey and they weren't very chocolatey. My daughter wanted one, so I let her have one even though they never set. I don't know if I did some thing wrong, but I wouldn't probably make them again. On the plus side they were very quick and easy to make.

A 4 star for the 'concept'. I changed this, followed other reviewer's suggestions about the 3 minute continuous boil, and my cookies turned out quite well. Soft, but not 'gooey'.
I did a half batch. I used 4 packets of Cookies and Cream Quaker Instant Oatmeal, 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract, a tiny pinch of sea salt, 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1 cup of Splenda white sugar, 1/4 cup fat free vanilla yogurt (I had no milk at home), 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, and 1 TBSP Cocoa powder.
I feel that as the instant oatmeal's already quite sweet, the white sugar could be halved. Also, the cocoa could be halved as well, but these are sweet and chocolately.
Such an easy recipe to make... I really like that they turned out fantastic with fat free vanilla yogurt instead of the evaporated milk as well.
Remember to stir stir stir for 3 minutes your sugar, yogurt (or milk if you follow recipe directions on site), butter and cocoa at boiling point as not to allow it to burn.
Definitely a keeper recipe!!!

This recipe turns out perfect everytime. I added half a cup of peanut butter to the chocolate mixture and let it boil for 3 solid minutes and they turn out perfect every time. Love it.

I agree with other reviewers that this recipe has a delicious flavor. However, yes, not so instant. It took a long while for these puppies to set. I put them in the freezer for a while (30+ min), and they were still rather syrup-y and bendable. Then I left them on the counter overnight, and they are much harder this morning. I'd say that they are really more like oatmeal candies than cookies. All in all, a tasty experiment, but I'll probably just bake oatmeal cookies next time I have a hankering.

This recipe tastes delightful!! And it is incredibly fast and easy.  Mine were a bit gooey too but I think if I would have made the cookies smaller (maybe 1 in. diameter?) that would have improved.  I will try this recipe again for sure and attempt to perhaps either use more oats by 1/2 a cup or so or maybe boil it a bit longer.  (I boiled them for a little under a minute to try to insure right texture.)  I didn't put the nuts in but I imagine that would help a little too.  They taste FANTASTIC though!  Thank you for sharing it!

AH HA!  Oatmeal cleverly disguised in chocolate!  My youngest daughter "hates" oatmeal, I had her read the recipe while she was licking the spoon.  I had no problems with the cookies setting up, instead of nuts, I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chips with the oatmeal.  They melted right away into the mixture, but it still turned out great!

Very yummy & very easy! I let the mixture boil for 3 minutes and once it was mixed with the oats and made into cookies they set in about 10 minutes.

This mixture for me was less like cookies and more like the texture of krispy rice treats or granola bars.  It was setting up so fast I had to stop making drop cookies and simply pressed the mixture into a glass pan lined with wax paper.  Then I cut them into squares.  Still delicious, yummy and easy to make.  I did not experience any runnyness or problems setting up the cookies. Maybe it was the fact that I substituted half the sugar for Splenda or that I used whipped butter substitute spread.  Could be the fact that I live in the desert in Arizona.  Can't say, but I definitely will make this recipe again! Cookies or squares, doesn't matter.  I took some to my Mother and she was delighted with them!

I also found this recipe to be too runny.  But it was fine when you let the mixture set for about an hour.  So I would say they are not so instant.  I also added some coconut to the mixture and they taste fantastic! I will make this again!

Hubs wanted no bake cookies and so he and I made these today.  We used Spelenda instead of sugar . . .and it appears that was a mistake.  We had to increase the butter to 1 cup but didn't realize that until we'd started mixing everything together so I had to melt 1/2 cup of butter in the microwave and then add it in with the rest of the mix.  It worked out okay in the end, but since subbing Splenda for sugar  is the only change we made (other than adding a spoonful of peanut butter--just remembered that too!), I have to assume that was the difference.  So, it worked, but I'd do 1 cup of butter if you sub all Splenda.  Sugar must be heavier or something and make a larger amount of syrup.  Hubs loved them anyway, and insisted on huge cookies--I pulled out the medium cookie scoop and he protested so the ice cream scoop is what we used instead.  He's happy, so I'm happy.  Recipe worked great for what he wanted.  Thanks for sharing!

They ended up a little goopy, but delicious. I'd add a splash more oats to the recipe to make it perfect.

I had to 'make' my own evaporated milk by putting 8 ounces in a saute pan and reducing to 4. I followed TC McCooke's advise and let the liquid boil for 3 minutes. Tasted great, scarily simple.

Love this!  Boiling the mixture is a must, and next time I plan on throwing a little bit of peanut butter in there too, it's almost begging for it.  What a texture treat!

I loved these!!! I halved the recipe, did not use the pecans and used fat-free evaporated milk, and they still came out great. The other thing I changed was that I added the salt directly to the milk mixture (I just thought it would mix better that way), and the vanilla also (for the same reason), but I added it after I removed it from the heat. I let it boil for a good minute and half, and after I mixed in the oats (I used instant) I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips, 'cause I'm a chocoholic;)
They set up great for me, and I will certainly make again, thank you for these!!!

Yummy!  T

These are just like the one's my mom made when I was little because they don't contain peanut butter, which we both hate.  And, just like when I was little, I can't wait for them to cool... I'm digging in even before they've hardened!!  My kids love them, too!  Thanks for letting me continue the tradition!

I measured everything correctly, and mine never set either.  They taste fine, but are too gooey too eat.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Tasted great but even after following directions, mine turned out crumbly.  Maybe too many pecans, or not boiled long enough, not sure. Peanut butter ones have better texture.

The idea is good, but the recipe begs for a better binding agent. After reading the reviews, I figured that this recipe would need fixing. I prepared it as is and followed the suggestion of bringing the butter mixture to a boil  for about 3 minutes not more or less...This never settled even after leaving the mixture overnight in the fridge. Given this outcome, I thought about the No-Bake Energy Bites from this site, since I have made it many times. Per that recipe, the two binding ingredients are peanut butter and honey, so I decided to add a few tablespoons of honey to the mixture to keep the recipe's flavor mostly unaltered. TA DAH!! Problem solved! The rolling of the little balls was A LOT easier than before. I know this will change the recipe a bit but if it will help here is my solution/suggestion: use honey instead of sugar or replace a portion of the sugar for honey.  Also, you can just add slightly warmed honey to the mixture directly if you already made the recipe as is to fix it. The advantage of warming up the honey while melting the butter is that it will make the mixing with the dry ingredients very easy. After mixing them, you can let it sit a little until the mixture is comfortable to the touch and start making the balls. It will be sticky but not excessively and will not crumble. Put them over wax paper to settle and that's it!

Way, way too sweet!   I remade these with 3/4 of cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut and 1 and 1/4 cup of white sugar, and they were the perfect sweetness.  I think the less white sugar we consume, the better, and my kids love this healthier version.

It was delicious, how ever I had to substitute few things (allergy related) I put coconut oil instead of butter and almond milk instead of regular milk,  but it turned out awesome

Stayed too moist, soft, maybe because I added extra vanilla.....so I baked them on a Silpat at 350 for 10 min.  Came out crispy crunchy, delicious after I cut them apart.

I must have measured inaccurately because I seemed to have a dry result. I let them boil for 3 minutes and then added the oatmeal mixture. Maybe I let them boil for 1 minute too long? I could barely get them to stay together due to the lack of sauce. They did taste delicious, but was not fit to present to people. I think i will try it again and see if they turn out better with less boiling time. I also thought the chocolate was faint, so I may increase it next time.

They were a bit too gooey. Fall apart in your hand, a bit messy. I wasn't crazy about the flavor either. They're a bit too sweet for me. But then again, it is a cookie.

I needed a quick snack for an impromptu snow tubing trip, and found I had all the ingredients for this recipe.  While it is tasty, I do have to agree with the others who found it still very gooey and sticky after setting for some time.  I followed the recipe, using half cinnamon roll, half plain oatmeal, about 1.5 cups of sugar and I boiled the chocolate mixture for a good three minutes until it was nice and fudgey.  Then I popped the little darlings into the freezer.  They set up well, so I thought all was well, but removing one from the tray, they are very sticky.  Really a cross between candy and a cookie, as someone else mentioned.  Very nice flavor, but next time I'll bake if I want a cookie!

Wonderful, easy recipe!  We absolutely can't use peanut butter because of a peanut allergy, but they turned out absolutely wonderful!  We also eliminated the nuts but followed the recipe otherwise to the letter.

My family has made these cookies for years. Back beyond my great grandmother, we dont use evaporated milk, no nuts but the use of peanut butter is a MUST.You MUST MUST MUST boil the mixture for 3 to 4 minutes. Then they will set up. We make them without the cocoa as well and just have peanut butter ones. We also do not use quick oats.

The cookies were definitely good!  I suggest a low boil for 1 minute.  This will cook the sugar down a bit more and help solidify the cookies.  Also, putting them in the fridge for about a 1/2 hour helps as well.

i noticed that there was a lot of sugar in the recipe so i reduced the amount and it still came out tasting like pure sugar. It was easy, but not very tasty.
