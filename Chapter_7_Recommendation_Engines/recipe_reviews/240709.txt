I do believe that the 2 tablespoons each of the spices are way off. I initially made this with one tablespoon of each and it was still off. Perhaps teaspoons would be in order but I'm not sure.

So I am teaching my son how to cook on a budget now that he's on his own.  I saw this recipe and it took me back to my just getting started in adult life.  Anyway what I had him do was buy the Ramen (10 for $3.00), 1/2 a rotisserie chicken, box of mushrooms. frozen peas, chicken stock and the spices (since he doesn't have ginger, onion powder and garlic powder).  we followed the directions, but just a teaspoon of the spices and a dash of salt and pepper.  But what we did was way out of left field, we added 1 cup chicken stock and 1 1/2 cup water.  we dumped a hand full of peas, mushrooms and shred the chicken breast and let it come to a boil.  Threw away the packet and added the top Ramen noodles for 3-5 min then served it up!  It was really good, he loved it and It took me back to simpler times.

I agree with tho other reviewers who said that this recipe yielded too much spice. Because I read that prior to mixing the whole amount in, I just added 3 tsps. to the soup. The spice amount seemed right, but the ginger was strong. My guess

It's rare for me too dislike something a much as this. I did 1t of ginger and 2t of garlic and onion powders. I'd put ginger in the fraction of a teaspoons. It really overpowers everything else.

Seasoning was way off. Definitely too much ginger.  And the recipe yielded too much seasoning.  I used only half of the mixture and had added vegetables and more water and it still didn’t taste great.

Holy Cow! Way to much ginger, I started gagging! Hopefully you saw this comment before attempting, because you really need to minimize the spices. I also ended up with almost half a cup of spice that was unusable. Like the idea though.

The amount of spices in this recipe was way off.  I would tone it waaaaay down.

Looked at the previous reviews before I gave this a shot.  Instead of water, I tried it with chicken broth and dialed down the spices.  While cooking up the broth it smelled pretty good and just about right for the broth for ramen.  Taste, ah, the taste.  Initially it seemed somewhat bland, but that ginger after taste really sticks with you.  Personal experimenting will adjust this right.  As for me, I need to go gargle to get this after taste out of my mouth.

As others have said, the measurements seem to be off. However the ingredients are right. I made it once as instructed and WOW...flavor overkill. I later made it with the same ingredients but less amounts and it was great. I also added in some red pepper flakes for spice.

I did not use ginger but it still turned out great. I added kale and tuna to make it even better. All in all, it was great. You can check the picture out on my page.

I put it everything as said and it came out with the water and spices turning into pudding. Tasted okay but it needed less spices.
