We made this last weekend, using petals from our Belinda's Dream rosebush.  I had never heard of rose petal jam or jelly until a few days before, certainly had never eaten it.  I was a little wary of what it would taste like, but it's unusually wonderful, a delicate rose flavor, very sweet.  Must be like what a hummingbird is tasting.  We plan to give it as gifts.  We washed the jars and lids in the dishwasher, then boiled them in pans of hot water, leaving until ready to fill.  One recipe made 3 and a half jars (I think they were 6 or 8 oz. size jars.  Anyway, you should allow for 4 jars if possible.  And it's so pretty!  Whatever color the roses are, that will be the color of your jam.  This was a huge hit as a gift at Christmas.  So unusual!
