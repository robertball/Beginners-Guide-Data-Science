This could be made with water, formula or breast milk in place of the cream; however, just plain mashed banana is probably fine also, and there's no need for sugar. I thought there was too much cream, and I probably used 3 1/2 tablespoons. This was actually perfect after frozen for a couple hours, then it was a nice treat for my preschooler.
