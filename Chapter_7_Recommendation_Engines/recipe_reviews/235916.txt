Really surprised by how easy these chocolate chip cookie dough truffles were to make.  I scaled this recipe and only made 1/4 of a batch which yielded 14 truffles.  To form the truffles, I used my tablespoon size cookie scoop.  I used mini-chocolate chips inside the truffles. Instead of using confectionery chocolate, I melted 1/2 cup of regular chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon of shortening in the microwave and dipped the frozen truffles. I sprinkled almonds and red and pink candy Valentine hearts over the tops of the truffles before the coating hardened.  Thank you, white_angel for sharing your delicious recipe!

I'm not a big cookie dough fan, but these looked good, and I was intrigued by the cream cheese. They were good! I used a wooden spoon and hand mixed, and it was pretty difficult to mix in the flour. I had to use my hands to mix at the end, and so I left out the last 1/4 cup of flour just because I was getting tired of mixing. They weren't too sticky when I rolled them into balls. I froze as stated, and they were very easy to dip; I used chocolate almond bark. DS thought they needed a tad more salt to taste like real cookie dough. I made some 2 inch balls and some 1 inch; I prefer the 1 inch, as they are very sweet, and I like the smaller bites. Made for Recipe Group selection.

Recipe Group: Yum yum! Very rich and delicious. I made the 'dough' part (used mini chocolate chips), refrigerated overnight, then formed balls and froze overnight. For the chocolate coating I melted plain old milk chocolate chips...it took a whole bag to dip a half recipe.

Made this for Recipe Group...These were VERY good! I halved the recipe but only added about 3/4 cup flour b/c I didn't want it o be too 'floury' tasting. Doing that did make these a little bit stickier to roll, but they worked fine. Very easy to make, and I really liked the little tang from the cream cheese. My little taste testers loved them! I'm not usually a huge fan of cookie dough things, but I really enjoyed these and will def be making them again! Thanks for sharing :)

Recipe Group Selection:  07, February 2015 ~ These were an easy treat to make and share with many people. Everyone liked them, but I personally didn't care for them.  I should have gone with my instincts and used 1/4 cup less flour.  The mixture was very thick to mix and I finally had to finish mixing with my hands.  I rolled in to 36 balls and froze.  They were very easy to dip and add sprinkles for Valentines Day.  I used part of them for my Girl's Night Out treat and boxed the rest for friends and neighbors.

Super easy and super delicious.  The one thing I think I will change is to add a little less flour next time - the texture is a bit firmer than I thought it should be.  Bring the recipe if you take these to a party - you will be asked for it!

I made a half-batch and they turned out beautifully. I used chocolate-flavored almond bark in place of the confectioner's chocolate, with just a few semi-sweet morsels melted in for that classic chocolate chip cookie taste. Very tasty, but one is more than enough for me! They will be devoured at our Christmas party.

They are very rich! Everyone who tried them after I made them had a very shocked face and said "Omgosh this is amazing!" I for sure liked them. The ONLY thing I found disappointing was that they're so rich I couldn't eat more than one! The only issue I ran into was when I made a homemade double-boiler, my glass bowl on top with the chocolate in it didn't fit down far enough into the pot with water, and the steam kept burning me.

These were ok. I love real cookie dough so I thought I'd give these a try. I didn't think they tasted like I expected they would. Several other people liked them though.

These were yummy!  Made exactly as the recipe states.  I had a hard time dipping them using the toothpick method that I usually use for dipping candies as the toothpick would break if it hit a chip but other than that it was a great recipe.  My daughter loves them!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious and pretty. We made these and dipped them in dark chocolate. They have been a hit with anybody who has tried them.

I thought this was a great recipe and I received great feedback from the various people I shared them with on Valentine's Day.  The only change I made to the recipe was to decrease the flour by 1/4 cup.  I got 35 truffles out of the full recipe.  They are very rich, but I feel they come very close to tasting like real chocolate chip cookie dough.  Thanks for sharing this treat, white_angel!
