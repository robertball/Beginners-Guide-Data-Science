Delicious, pretty and different. I found I needed to cover the pan a few minutes to ensure the beans were cooked crisp-tender before they would turn too brown. I finished these with a dribble of toasted sesame seed oil at the end which really enhanced the flavor, and I  believe this would have been kind of boring without it. These were so good and flavorful that this is one of those rare occasions where the addition of garlic wouldn't necessarily have made this any better.

Very easy and delicious.  Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it.  You can substitute asparagus for the green beans and sliced or slivered toasted almonds for the sesame  seeds.

I used thawed, frozen green beans and it worked, but would have been better with fresh.  I also added a clove of minced garlic to the oil with the green beans and it was exactly what I was looking for, YUMMY!  UPDATE: I wanted this again, but had no green beans so I used broccoli instead and it was equally delicious (although I used a little more soy sauce & sesame oil since they soaked it right up)!

We really enjoyed this tasty dish. I did add some fresh garlic to it and some sliced fresh mushrooms. Because of personal time constraints, I actually undercooked the dish at first, chilled it, and we ate it later, just heated it up in the microwave and it was excellent. Steams well in the microwave for about 2 minutes in a bowl covered with plastic wrap. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good!  A nice change from same old green beans.  Be sure to use regular soy sauce as the mild lower salt left them a little boring.

I thought these were pretty good. I used frozen home grown beans and boiled them for a little while first because my husband hates his veggies 'tender crisp' and prefers them softer ... I bet this would have been great with fresh beans especially if you like your beans a little crispy.

I subbed olive oil for the canola because this is what I had. I ended up covering the beans to get them a little more tender yet still hold their green color but they still seemed to be lacking a little something in the end so I gave them a small drizzle of sesame oil and that did the trick.

Yuuum!!! Used olive oil instead of canola and per other suggestions, increased the sesame oil to 3 teaspoons and added fresh pressed garlic.  A definite keeper!

Substituted plain green beans for Japanese edamame soy beans. However, mine turned out a little salty, so I think I will cut back on the soy sauce for next time.

During holidays and at family gatherings I recall seeing this dish on the table along with other spreads. The sprinkle of the white sesame seeds always caught my eye -so pretty. If I remember correctly there was also sugar in this sauce. However, I made this dish according to the directions and found that it had the sesame flavor but was lacking something so I went ahead and added a pinch of sugar to the soy sauce mixture. I stirred the mixture and let it sit. I made sure that I sauteed the beans until they were crisp-tender. I toasted the sesame seeds for about 1 minute (over gas stove) and poured it over the string beans. I do not think you need the entire amount of sesame oil when stirring the beans in the skillet. You could just drizzle a little sesame oil on the top right before adding the sesame seeds which adds a nice flavor and pretty presentation.  This is such a tasty twist to the same ole' boring bland string beans.. and worth the effort to make it. Just like I remembered....

That nutty sesame seeds pair perfectly with nutty green beans makes good sense, of course, but it was kind of an "Oh, duh!" moment for me. I added some minced garlic, too, to ward off vampires and such. :)

These were wonderful, using fresh green beans make it extra special.  I did blanche them first, and they were just spectacular. I would go to a Buffet just for these beans and now I so happy I can do them myself.  Toasted sesame seeds are awesome served with this flavorful side dish!!!

Cooked exactly as state, but didn't use sesame seeds (realized last minute that I was out)... still, the taste was amazing!  Husband immediately declared it a new way to cook up some boring beans.  Served with Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi and a some Mandarin Orange salad with the Asian Ginger Dressing from this site.

This was excellent with some modifications.  I used peanut oil instead of canola.  I began with green onions and fresh garlic from the farmer's market, letting those brown a bit before I added the green beans.  By the time the beans were done, the onions and garlic were nice and carmelized.  The cooking method here worked beautifully.  Thanks for a terrific jumping off point!

Very good and simple.    After getting the beans browned, lower the heat to medium, add some minced garlic.  With fresh beans, it might be necessary to add spoons of water in the process to make sure they are cooked.

This makes a great side dish to go with any asian meal.  I seved this with seared Ahi Tuna along with coconut rice and it was the perfect healthy light meal.  I will for sure make these again as I'm always looking for great way to prepare fresh veggies.

I made this last night and served with Honeyed Pork Chops found on here also--great combo!   These were tasty and quick and easy to make.   I threw my sesame seeds in with the beans as I was cooking them and got them toasted that way.   Thanks for a tasty side dish!

These were awesome!  Used EVOO instead of canola oil and added red pepper flakes for some added zing.  Loved the crunchiness of the beans.  Weren't mushy....very tasty!  Even good re-heated the next day.  Will be making these again very soon.

Turned out perfect and met the expectations set. It's light and you can adjust the beans to whatever level of crunchiness you want.

This was so simple to make and delicious - thank you! I suggest, as others did, doing the initial cooking with a lid on, at least for about 3-4 minutes. We found the browner the bean, the yummier.

The beans need a little more than 10 minutes to cook, mine came our a little underdone. I added a little lemon juice for a zing.

Delicious! I also covered mine for 5 minutes to so to get them cooked enough. Using a good quality soy sauce will make all the difference in a recipe like this.

WAY too much oil for us. i was not a fan of this cooking method for green beans. i prefer to steam them first and then flavor them with melted fresh herb butter or olive oil.

An excellent recipe and one I'll use often. I will try with less oil, though the liquid that cooks out of the beans makes things seem 'greasier' than they really are. I always thicken with a sprinkle of flour or cornstarch to make the seasons cling to the vegetables rather than sitting in the bottom of the bowl. Nice flavor and easy to make as I've always got at least frozen green beans available at home. Thanks for the recipe!

These had good flavor, but I think there was a little too much oil in this recipe. It left the beans having a very greasy mouthfeel and left oil on your lips. Eek! Loved the sesame though.

Girlfiend loved them. Followed the cooking times but in my opinion they were too undercooked - nearly as 'hard' as fresh. Will double up on flavorings next time to get more 'bang' flavor-wise.

I keep canned vegies in the house for emergency purposes only. My emergency was that I totally forgot to buy string beans today and I wanted to make this. Even so, this was a great dish! I did add onion/garlic powders and a bit of red pepper flakes for some heat. I toasted my seeds in the the oil and then added the beans. Good Nell and thanks!

These are soooo good. I used sesame oil and hot oil together instead of canola oil. I have used this recipe on frozen thin green beans, as well as Prince Edward blend (green bean/wax beans/baby round carrots) with great success. As good as the ones I get in Asian restaurants.

A little dull as written.  To make it five stars, use 1 T light sesame oil and 1 T toasted sesame oil and add red pepper flakes to give some heat.

This is a great recipe and requires little effort. I cut my green beans in half and do find that they need to cook a little bit longer than stated. The only change I make is cook time, adding some fresh minced garlic and using a few drops of sesame oil with the soy sauce at the end for more of the sesame flavor. These are delicious and a hit in my house!

We didn't love them, but we didn't hate them. Probably will not be making them again unless we added some flavoring (garlic, etc)

Definitely a different flavor. The only negative I have is that my palate is unused to this much sesame oil.

Delicious, very quick. My family is picky they don't care for fresh green beans. But, I decided to grow a garden this year and I have green beans coming out of my ears. LOL So I needed new recipes that they would like. They LOVE them this way. But I added toasted almond instead of sesame seeds. Our new fave.

These green beans were so tasty!  My family's enjoyed these several times.  I've followed the reviewers's additions/advice and changed accordingly.  No matter what I've done, it all tastes great! I've served these mostly with chicken and once with steaks.  I haven't served them yet with Asian foods! No one cares! They all love them and ask for them over and over again! Great recipe!

Delicious! I changed this recipe up a bit - I threw in some red peppers and mushrooms. Turned out great! The only thing I will do next time is to cook the beans a bit longer before adding the peppers and mushrooms.

We LOVED these green beans!!  The only thing I did differently was steamed the steam in bag frozen green beans.  Cooled them then tossed in the hot oils for 5 minutes.  The mix of sesame oil and the toasted sesame seeds made this dish fantastic!!  Will be making again and again and again!

Good flavor! I only disliked how much (many?) sesame seeds it called for; I used less, but they still made it strangely crunchy.

Excellent side dish! I used pre-toasted sesame seeds (from the Asian section in my supermarket) but I think they may have been old because I could not smell any sesame to it at all, so I re-toasted them quickly over med/high heat in a nonstick pan and added a drop or two of sesame oil - really brought out the scent and flavor! I brought these to Christmas Eve dinner, and followed another reviwer's suggestion to undercook by a couple of minutes in the pan so that when I reheated in the microwave they were still crisp-tender. I brought a full 2 pounds of these green beans to dinner and not a single bean was leftover. Thanks!

Just like my favorite Japanese steak house, even my boyfriend loved them! Thanks!! The only thing I did different was use lite soy sauce, a little more than it called for.

One of our favorites recipes.  As is!  My kids actually ASK me to make these and they don't like veggies.  It's pretty much the only way they'll eat green beans.  My husband and I love them, too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved them, but my family wasn't as thrilled. My husband (a true Southerner) thought the beans tasted raw. The next time I will blanch the beans first. Maybe that will make him happier. These were perfect with the Sesame Turkey recipe from this site.

I added some minced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes in the skillet, but kept everything else the same.  I was skeptical but 1 tbsp is the perfect amount of soy sauce.  Delicious.

These were really delicious!  I used those frozen "steam-able" green beans, thawed them out, and then just followed the rest of the recipe.  They have a GREAT flavor - and I don't usually like green beans!

I loved this recipe! I made it today for my first Thanksgiving dinner using frozen french-cut green beans. I ran cold water over the beans and squeezed them in the strainer before putting them in the pan with the heated oil. I also added a dash of rice vinegar with the soy sauce but I'm not sure it made a difference. It was like a mock wakame salad! My boyfriend, however, did not care for it because he claims to hate sesame, despite loving Japanese food.

I was soooo tempted to use garlic in this recipe, but then thought it might change the entire taste. I didn't read the reviews prior to making this dish, but next time would think twice about using so much oil. Liked the overall taste of the dish, might need a bit of tweaking with chili oil or red pepper flakes tho'.

We love traditional, Southern green beans, but these were very good!  I served them with Chicken Katsu and Glo's Sausage Fried Rice for "Japanese Night."  They were a great combination.

What a wonderful, flavorful recipe for green beans. It adds just enough flavor without overpowering the beans. We also like to make this with fresh asparagus - yum! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were ok. Fairly easy to prep. Needs some garlic. Good variation for fresh green beans if you are looking for something different.

Give it only four stars because I think there was a bit too much oil. Will bring down the canola oil amount a bit next time, other then that, it was very good. Forgot about the sesame seeds, will get next time. Very easy recipe.

I really liked the taste of these. Much more exciting than plain green beans. My family wasn't as big a fan. I did add minced garlic with the beans as well as added sesame seeds to the oil to toast. To complete the meal I made 'Asian beef skewers' and plain jasmine rice. Fun.

Great flavor even after I got carried away and some of the beans "blackened", those seemed to get eaten the fastest.  Added some minced garlic and a little extra soy sauce, just for our taste.

this recipe was great!!! I added a little minced garlic and some minced dried onions while cooking in the wok.  I took the advice of someone else and only cooked for 7-8 min. and then finished in a microwave steamer with a scant amount of water.  My kids love green beans on Chinese restaurant buffets and these were just like them!!  The 3 of us ate the entire recipe!!  I'm so glad they love veggies!!  I also made an applesauce recipe and pecan pie that I found on allrecipes today!! Served all these along with pork chops for a super dinner!!!  These green beans will also be on my Thanksgiving table!

These were very tasty green beans - a very versatile side-dish.  I made them for a dinner party, and they were still good when served lukewarm.  I used a combination of white and black sesame seeds, which gave it an interesting look.

I was drawn to this recipe by all the beautiful photos of it, and it did not disappoint. I went to the store with sesame seeds on my list and forgot to get them, but in spite of that the green beans were perfectly flavored. My husband had 2 huge helpings--and he's not a veggie lover!

What a nice change from regular ol' green beans. I over cooked mine a bit, but they were still good. I made a huge batch to snack on all day at work. I think I'll be doing that more often. Thanks for the recipe!

These were a little greasy, I would cut back on the oil and possible place on a paper towel before I serve. Other than that, it has a good flavor.

This recipe turned out great!  The only substitution I made was for toasted sesame oil from Trader Joe's.  They had a great "toasted" flavor.  The only thing I would change is to cut down on the oil just a little bit.  They turned out a little on the greasy side.  Maybe next time I'll try blanching the green beans first, also.

I did steam my beans a bit first out of personal preference.  Very nice recipe.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic that I sauteed in the canola oil.  Sesame oil was not too overpowering but complimentary to the dish. I loved the little crunch of the toasted sesame seed for garnish.  Lovely dish with a beautiful vibrant color; presents well.

Quite good!  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to spice it up.  In the future, I think I'll cut back slightly on the oil.  This wasn't quite as good as the green beans at our favorite Asian buffet, but it was still pretty good!  Thanks!

Very good and super quick! Ideal complement for Asian-syle dishes. I blanched the beans prior to cooking them in the pan as I don't like them crunchy and added a pinch of garlic powder.

Perfect!! These were easy and very tasty.  I substituted frozen green beans because that's what I had on hand.  I microwaved those to just about room temperature before proceeding with the rest of the directions and they turned out great.  I've made these twice in two weeks and will defintely be making them again. Great recipe.

A change but can do a lot to change it up if you want or not.  Could add mushrooms, bacon, onion, or leave as is.  The sesame oil is the key I think.  The sesame seeds don't do anything but that is a personal preference.

WOW!  This is delicious!  I had never thought of sesame oil and green beans but now it is an every day occurrence! I used EVOO instead of canola, just added some sesame oil at the end after steaming the green beans and added garlic (our preference).  The sesame seeds and peanuts at the end make this out of this world!!

This really adds flavour to your green beans!  Easy to make and it gets you out of the boring beans syndrome.

I used to make this dish 40 years ago as an easy dish to bring to a group pot luck. I would add a little ricewine vinegar to the dressing, Since I cook by taste, not sure how much of any ingredient I used, but be sure you taste--and maybe add more roasted sesame oil and/or soy sauce. Always popular!

Excellent. Instead of soy, I did have a bit of a soy-based chinese sauce leftover that I used. Only used enough to help the beans steam a bit at the end.

Thank you for the recipe.

My husband’s favorite way to eat green beans. I add a few teaspoons of minced garlic during the sauté process. Sometimes a little extra soy sauce also. I’ve forgotten the sesame seeds a few times. Don’t really notice the difference. Taste like the green beans from my favorite Chinese buffet back when I was in college. I used to go in there and pack a takeout box full of them.

Super easy and delicious.  Sesame oil adds a nice flavour. Looks attractive with sesame seeds, and I also added cashews to the top for garnish which looked great and added a nice occasional nutty taste.

I did not make any changes, but as the beans were a little less done than my family likes, think I'll steam a little first next time.  Overall, a very nice side to the baked fish we were having.

Very tasty and fast. I used 1 tsp each canola and sesame oil, 1 tsp each light soya sauce and toasted sesame seeds, to 1.5 lbs green beans, perfect with our Korean pork tenderloin.

I would make it again! Not super flavorful as my family and I couldn't really taste the soy sauce, but I liked the olive oil, and it was over all a nice change from regular steamed green beans.

Love it. But I decided to wing it a little bit  --- threw in some mushrooms, minced garlic from the jar and went way over the sesame oil and soy sauce recommendations, then cooked it down. I should have made some mashed potatoes or something because that extra sauce is the DEAL.

Made exactly according to recipe. Came out a little stiffer than I like but given the origin of the recipe it was fine.

UPDATE: MADE THIS WITH ASPARAGUS THIS TIME AND ALTHOUGH YUMMY, I PREFER USING GREEN BEANS. Yum! These were really good! Even my picky hubs liked these but did point out that he could do without the sesame seeds.... As Naples34102 did, I also drizzled my beans with a bit of additional sesame oil and didn't find the combination of oil and sesame seeds overwhelming in the least (but I LOVE sesame anything!!!). If you're looking for a quick side, look no farther. This is simply deeelish! Thanks for sharing your MIL's famous recipe, Cooking_Muse. I can't wait to try this with asparagus next time! :-)

Simple and delicious recipe!! I've been looking over the Internet for years for a recipe just like this and I finally found it. I could never get the flavor just "so" and this recipe hit it right on the head! It's so easy to make and reheats just as easily. Tastes good cold or warm.

There was absolutely nothing special about the green beans.  They just tasted like green beans with soy sauce.

Easy and delicious dish!  I substitute sesame oil for canola  oil and sometimes add peanuts instead  of almonds.  Fabulous dish for the whole family!

If you are looking to make the green beans that are at the Chinese restaurants, this is it! I used 1 1/2 Tblsp. of vegetable oil, as I can not tell the difference in any other oil. And, I used 1 lb of french style frozen defrosted green beans. And, I also did not add the sesame seeds, because I do not like them on vegetables. But, the recipe is basically green beans sauteed in oil and then flavored or salted with soy sauce. They are identical to the ones in the Asian restaurants in look and in taste.  But, I am giving it a 4, because I was hoping if I made them at home they would be a little less greasy. I may make again with stir fry, but with only half the oil and soy sauce.

These were pretty good.  I boiled them before pan frying them because we don't like crunchy veggies and they came out great.

Perfect! Delicious and simple. Don't change a thing except if you want softer green beans extend the five minute sitting time at the end. They are crispy otherwise which is typical] of asian prepared veggies.

This has become a staple in my house.  My husband is not fond of many vegetables but these he will eat.  I add ground black pepper, a bit of hot sauce, and minced/chopped garlic.  It gives it a bit more kick.  I have also added snow peas (mix them in later as they cook more quickly) and this comes out good as well.

I made this as written and it was very good, but I felt something was missing so the second time I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder as the beans were cooking and I took another rater's suggestion and drizzled with sesame oil to finish.  Very good recipe, thanks for sharing.

This was very tasty. I did use young/tender frozen green beans and it tasted great. A nice change from the same old green beans. Served with "Oyako Donburi" and "Japanese Zucchini and Onions."

Very good, just like another reviewer I would stick to regular soy sauce not the low-sodium one.  It was a little bland without the salt.

Not my favourite way of serving green beans. Some were crispy and some were overcooked. Maybe that was my fault for not paying enough attention to them. The problem that was the fault of the recipe was that they were too oily and the flavours of the sesame oil and soy sauce were too strong, in my opinion.

The taste was great, however I skipped ther toatsed sesame. I didn't have any. I added a little bit of sugar in case the soy sauce was too salty. Like many, I thought the green beans were way too oily. Next time i'll cook the green beans with water, once all water is evaporated and green beans are tender, i'll toss it in the sesame oil. I would make this again. I think my vegetable-hating boyfriend liked them.

Not bad. Nothing special though.Kinda bland and a lil to much oil for my taste. I think next time i will eliminate the canola oil and stick to only the sesame oil, add fresh garlic, and maybe a wee bit of brown sugar. 3 stars if made as written.

I didn't have sesame seeds so I omitted them.  But otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Unlike some other reports they were not the least bit oily.  Quick and easy and delicious.

Nicely light, easy, and healthy.  My kids are weird and like their veggies, so this was a no-brainer when I read the recipe.  Even so, they liked it so much, there were no left-overs.  Lovely.

The only real change I made was to throw some toasted cashews in the mix.. not because I thought the recipe needed them, but because cashews are awesome on just about any vegetable.  I have to say, though, I'm with the folks who say "cut back on the oil" in their reviews.  I used the amount called for in the recipe, but with double the beans, and it was still a tad too oily.  In spite of that, that were no leftovers.

I thought these were great....a nice side dish for any asian meal. I only had 1/2 lb of fresh green beans, but ended up cutting back on the oils by more than half. I used hot chili sesame oil because that is all I had on hand and it gave the beans a nice spiciness. However, my 3 year old toddler did not care for them at all!

My family request these wonderful green beans at least once a week.  They are truely the best we have ever tasted.  Even my kids' picky friends rave about them.  I can always expect a phone call from one of their Moms asking how I got "little Timmy" to eat green beans, lol.

This was ok but I'm not sure if I would make again. I followed the recipe almost exactly- I added some minced garlic with the oil & didn't use the sesame seeds maybe that is why I didn't completely love it. My husband doesn't like sesame seeds to I omitted them. If I do make them again I will cook them a little longer, they were a tad more crisp than I would like. Thanks.

These are absolutely delicious! I always make them with frozen green beans, that I thaw first, and they're still awesome (although i'm sure fresh is even better). My husband asks for them all the time and our toddler loves them too- definately a family favorite- thanks for sharing!

Oh so good!  I added two cloves of minced garlic and it was spot on.  I made the whole recipe for just my boyfriend and me and yet strangely, there were no leftovers! :)  So tasty and impossible to stop eating.

This recipe is super easy and very tasty.  I recommend cooking the green beans a few minutes longer to really bring out the flavor and give it a crunchy texture.  I also added some chill pepper flakes to spice it up.

Great!  I used fish sauce in place of the soy sauce - my wife is allergic to soy.  I'll make again.  Next time I'll serve with steak.

I couldn't figure out how a simple green bean recipe flavored with soy sauce could get such raving reviews but I tried it and I can't stop munching on them!  They really are very tasty.

I loved this dish and I dont like green beans! I'm 48 years old and haven't eaten green beans since childhood. These were easy and so good. They stayed crunchy and the light soy flavor with the seeds were perfect. A great way to use up those fresh beans from my garden.

I just love these. I love green beans to begin with. I use whole frozen baby green beans. I sometimes add fresh garlic to these.I snack on these instead of chips .The bad thing is they smell so good I end up having to share with the kids. Thanks for the recipe

I use this recipe all of the time for a quick side dish.  I just use canned beans as a time saver and I've done it with and without sesame seeds.  I also add a can of sliced mushrooms.

I thought these were jusk OK, but my hub and kids LOVED them, so 5 stars...  I cut the oil, cooking them in just a spray of canola.  When mostly cooked, I added the soy sauce and sesame oil, tossing in the sesame seeds just before serving.  My 5 year old had 4ths.

This is one of the only two ways my 8 yr old son will eat beans now!  I'll do anything for them kids to eat their greens so we do this often.
tastes fabulous with the soy sauce, I also add some terriyaki sauce too which my son loves even more!

I followed the recipe to a T and neither my boyfriend nor I like it. The sauce didn't work for us. I made it will the Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi, which has an unreal sauce on it so maybe it just paled in comparison. Will not make again though.

YUMMY!! We really liked this.  I had to cook a little loger than 10 min. but my beans were fat.  I used olive oil instead of canola & next time will try & reduce it to 1/2 Tbs. but these didn't taste oily at all, just a personal preference.

A wee-bit oily, but, otherwise a VERY tasty and delicious side dish. Goes great with Japanese themed dinners! Thanks!

I have made this dish for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  Not only does the flavor nicely complement the traditionally savory flavors of American holiday dishes, but it's ridiculously easy to make, and not at all time consuming.  It has received raves from literally everyone I've ever served it to!

Only change was to use olive oil.  This was good.  A strong soy taste (isn't my favorite), but something hubby and my son liked.  Will make again.  Thanks for the post.

Out of all the recipes I've tried from allrecipes.com, this one is my favorite.  It's simple, quick, and delicious.  (And it works just as well with broccoli!)

I had high hopes for these based on reviews, but we didn't like them at all.  I made them exactly according to directions, but we didn't like the texture at all and they were kind of bland.  They were pretty, but that was the only good part for us.

This is a great way to spice up your beans every now and then!  I used two cans of french style green beans, added a little less canola oil and a little more sesame oil.  I also left out the sesame seeds and added garlic. Yum!

Finally a good recipe for fresh green beans.  I used toasted sesame oil because that's what I keep in the house.  Since I didn't have sesame seeds, I tossed in some garlic after I took it off the heat.  The green beans were cooked perfectly and my kids who normally hate cooked fresh green beans came back for seconds and thirds!

These were good, not outstanding and I would probably make them again just for a different way of preparing green beans.  Next time I'll use toasted slivered almonds though, I prefer their flavor over sesame seeds.

This recipe is so easy AND tasty!  I have made it twice and envision it ALWAYS remaining near the very top of the list of favorite ways to make green beans.  I followed the recipe fairly faithfully, but added the soy sauce to the pan while it was still on the heat.  The soy sauce reduces a bit this way and may help to hold the sesame seeds on the beans better (I had no problems with them coming off as mentioned by a previous reviewer).

I only made 1/2 pound green beans but kept the other ingredients the same. Even so, we thought the beans were bland and we didn't like the consistency. Might be better to steam them first.

I sauted some onion before adding the green beans. (I used frozen. That's all I had on hand. They worked just fine) The end result was very nice and flavorful. :)

We liked these green beans, but I admit that I cooked them a little too long for our taste.  The soy sauce and sesame seeds are a nice addition to a favorite vegetable.
