For the LCHF crowd i replaced:
vanilla yogurt w/ plain full fat yogurt
whipped topping w/  heavy whipped cream whipped cream
creamy peanut butter w/ freshly made peanut butter made with peanuts only.
and added liquid vanilla stevia w/ a pinch of salt

turned out great.  Thanks for the inspiration.

This was really good as is!  For my taste, I might add a little less cinnamon, but everyone else loved it.  I made it for my teen daughters party and I served with apples and strawberries.  We ran out of fruit and I actually had girls asking for spoons so they could finish the dip.  Will definitely make again!

This dip is fantastic, not too sweet and not too thick.  My friend loved it so I gave her the recipe.

I made it and forgot the cinnamon. It was good, but needed something else so I added a little bit of brown sugar. It was so easy and quick to make and I actually had all of the ingredients in the fridge!

I thought this was a very easy, light, and fluffy fruit dip.  I added just a sprinkle of powdered sugar to it to make it slightly sweeter and it was perfect with my sliced apples.
