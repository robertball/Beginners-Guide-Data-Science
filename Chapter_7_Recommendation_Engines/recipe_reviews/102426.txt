I have made Pumpkin Pie Cake quite a few times, but my recipe calls for a 29 oz can of pumpkin (not a 15 oz can). I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. DO NOT make the mistake of using pumpkin pie mix for this recipe or it will not turn out. I generally use a spice cake mix with very good results. My gamily likes this just as much as they like pumpkin pie.

Way too sweet.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 c.  There is enough sugar in the cake mix and milk that a full cup is not needed.  I like to taste the flavors of ingredients, not the sugar.

This pumpkin cake was very good, altho I think I like my recipe that uses a 29 oz can pf pumpkin better, as it has a better pie filling to topping ratio & makes it more pumpkin pie-ish. I like the use of brown sugar and more spice than the norm. I always dbl the spice in my pumpkin pie. Since I only had a 15 1/2 oz can of pumpkin, this is the recipe I used. I didn't have pecans or walnuts so used sliced almonds instead and added flaked coconut for some crunch. I cut the melted butter back to 3/4 cup. It was served with fresh whipped cream and it tasted delicious.

Loved it! I would like to reduce the amount of butter on top, does anyone has a suggestion?
