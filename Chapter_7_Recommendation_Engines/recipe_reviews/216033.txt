The apples added nothing to this recipe-they were totally overpowered by the brussel sprouts. I was expected a little sweetness or apple flavor to enhance the brussel sprouts but nothing.

These were okay, but a little bland. Hubby didn't much care for them. I'd probably give them 3.5 stars. They needed something, but I'm not sure what. More herbs, maybe? Butter? They also took a good bit longer than the stated roasting time and the sprouts were slightly tender-crisp while the apples were very soft.

I made two different Brussel sprout w/ Apple dishes tonight. Both from this site. This one is far superior and flavorful. I am not sure why some of the people who reviewed this recipe said it was bland, because it wasn't at all. The only difference that I did was how I assembled it. I cut the sprouts up first and put them in the bottom of the dish. I then put the apples on top and mixed the remaining ingredients together and poured them over top of the sprouts and apples as a sauce. Put in the oven and bake as directed. Enjoy!!!

Great taste, easy to make.  Be sure to core the sprouts, though.

I had apples and I had brussel sprouts so I thought this would be the perfect combination, but it really lacked flavor and the addition of apple cider meant the sprouts didn't get the brown crispy edges we all love

Since so many reviewers had said this dish lacked flavor I used extra thyme an added a splash of apple cider vinegar. Turned out good, and had a nice flavor.

I love Brussels Sprouts and this was just one of many recipes I tried to change up the dinners I prepare for the wife and I (all of the kids are gone and I'm retired). And to 'Mdilloway' who stated that the dish was really vinegary and sour, what the !!!! are you using TART apples for in the mix when the sprouts are already a -2 on the flavor scale of bitterness. The tartest apple you would want to use is a Granny Smith. Next time, do what I did. Use the recipe for 'Sweet and Sour Green Cabbage' and you'll get great results. This is a keeper.

This was pretty good, but the apples were super soft. Maybe if you added the apples in part-way through it would be better, but then they wouldn't have the dressing ingredients on them.

This has WAY TOO MUCH apple cider vinegar. It made the dish very sour and the whole house just smelled of vinegar. I'd use half the amount next time. 

Because the vinegar overpowered everything else, I sprinkled brown sugar on towards the end, which caramelized. Then it tasted much better. 

Also, it needed 40 minutes, not 25. Maybe it's my oven (though other stuff I cook is okay) so have a little flex time.

I used Pink Lady apples, which are tart.
