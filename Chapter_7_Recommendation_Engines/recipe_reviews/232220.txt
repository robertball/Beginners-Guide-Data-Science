I made this for Easter breakfast and it was absolutely delicious!! However, it was a bit runny after 45 minutes and I ended up draining some liquid off the top and then baking it for well over an hour. Any ideas on what I did wrong? I will definitely use this recipe again for left over ham.....a real keeper that I will pass on to my sisters.

This was really good. I didn't have the full amount of ham so I used what I had.. still came out delicious. Next time I think I'll leave the ham the same amount, but add a veggie like broccoli

This was really good. Like other viewer will add broccoli next time. Some of my guests thought it was a little spiced but I thought it was fine.

If this review was solely my own, I would give this 4 stars. However, my husband raved about it. He told me how much he liked it when I debuted it at dinner, and then again the next day when he ate leftovers for lunch, and then the day after that he expressed disappointment when there were no more leftovers for breakfast. So, thanks to his rave reviews and the ease of preparation, this gets 5 stars. The rosemary flavor really makes the dish. It's amazing how a little of the herb goes such a long way.

Awesome!!! Welcome change from the usual egg and potato casserole. I had to guess on the grits because I only had instant-- following the box directions for 3 servings-- but I would recommend 4 if someone else has the same dilemma. Regardless, the flavor was rich and delicious. I bake mine in 2 8x8" pans because I was concerned the casserole would run over in the oven. Family loved it. Thank you!

Quite runny.  Next time I will add one more egg and a bit more grits.  I loved the taste!

This was great. I needed to increase the cooking time a bit and turned the oven to 370 at high altitude.  Great for using up that holiday ham.

Made this two ways with the grits and another with cornbread 
both was a hit with the family and friends.
