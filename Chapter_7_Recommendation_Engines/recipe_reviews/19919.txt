Vodka sauces are wonderful and so easy to make! I sauteed some chopped onion in olive oil along with 3 cloves of garlic. I then added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole and then 2 tsp. of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. I also added a bit of parmesan cheese along with the cream and the sauce came out very smooth and oh so good over the penne pasta. Great with garlic bread!

I've made several a la vodka sauces before, however most used tomato puree or just canned tomato sauce.  The idea of using whole peeled tomatos in this recipe is a good one, however that's the only thing I would do again from this recipe.  There is entirely too much heavy cream used in this recipe.  The flavor of the tomatos and the spices was great, but once the heavy cream was added this sauce suddenly became very bland.  Not only was the sauce bland, but it was very thin.  My recommendation would be to cut the heavy cream in half.

I made this for dinner last night - my husband called it "restaurant quality".  With the alterations I made, it was closer to another 5-star recipe on this site, "Penne with Spicy Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce", with no meat.  I recommend using red pepper flakes, 3/4t. salt, crushed or diced tomatoes (vs. whole) and less cream.  I added sliced, fresh mushrooms halfway through - oh yum!  Adding the red pepper with some salt will eliminate the blandness that other reviewers mentioned.  I will make this again with those changes.

This is amazing if you mix it together with the penne and let it all cook together at the end for an extra 10 minutes.  The sauce thickens and the flavor really comes out. I also used half the amount of cream and about 3/4 lb of pasta.

Absolutely amazing. I varied the recipe just a bit by using crushed, not whole, tomatoes, and about 3/4s of a pint of heavy cream - but everyone went back for thirds!

Follow this recipe exactly except:

Add 1/2 tsp of Red Pepper Flakes to make it slightly spicy that everyone will like...  I personally like 1 tsp.

Add the cream and simmer for 5 mins, then add the sauce to the noodles and simmer until the sauce turns from watery to sticky...  just like making mac and cheese!

I also like to add some cooked jumbo shrimp when I add the cream.

This recipe is so close to the Penne alla Vodka I order at a very expensive italian restaurant.

Wow!! Now I know what to cook for my boyfriend when he comes into town next weekend. I have been experimenting, trying to come up with the perfect dinner for him, and this one definitely is up to par!! I threw in a dash of red pepper flakes and extra garlic for some heat. I halfed the recipe, but accidentally forgot to halve the vodka (yes, it WAS an accident!) :), but it turned out delicious anyway. Next time i might add some grilled chicken breast, and maybe some peas for color. You HAVE to try this recipe, you will not be disappointed, i promise. Thanks Liarose!! :)

I have tried countless recipes for vodka sauce. I've also ordered it at restaurants several times. This is the best vodka sauce I've ever had. My husband and everybody I make it for loves it. It's very easy, too!

Very good, but be sure to let the vodka cook "off".  Used crushed San Marino tomatoes in place of whole tomatoes as they impart such a wonderful flavor.  So easy to customize this recipe by adding basil, red pepper flakes, chicken, etc., the possibilities are endless! Thank you liarose for the submission!

Excellent! I can't recommend this recipe enough. It's easy to make and absolutely delicious. My whole family loved it. I even substituted fat free half and half for the cream and it still tasted wonderful! I probably didn't need to  but I also added a dash of red pepper flakes. I can't wait to make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was simple, elegant and delicious! I even got away with using half-and-half and it was still very good. I also added sliced mushrooms and shrimp. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Vodka sauce! This is one of the best.

Absolutely awesome!! It's like a dish you'd get in a very nice (expensive!) restaurant. For convenience, I use a can of diced tomatoes. The heavy cream does make it rich, but that just adds to the decadence!

Very delicious! I definitely did not use all of the cream which worked out well because the next day I wanted it again so badly I made enough for 1 serving with the leftover cream!  I would highly suggest sitting vodka aside for 10-15 minutes with a teaspon of crushed red pepper soaking in it until ready for use. I like a little kick :)

I've made this three times now.  The original recipe is why I rated it a 4.  It became a ten, and a family favorite when I chopped up an onion and 5 slices of bacon or panchetta and sautéed them to start and serving with grated parmasean.  The rest of the recipe was followed as is.  I would suggest however that adding the cream to taste is a good idea.  Start with a quarter cup and taste..  In fact, I used 5% cream once and it was excellent.  Just remember Chef John's suggestion, after you mix the sauce in with the pasta, cover it and let it sit for 5 minutes and let the sauce absorb into the pasta and it won't be runny.  Also, I learned on an Italian cooking class to always use whole tomatoes, San Marzano if available, because any diced or pureed ones loose their quality when exposed to blades or the tin in the canning process.

This recipe is delicious! I used a box of pasta that was a bit under a pound and cut out about a quarter or two of the cream (I chose to use light cream), but it was still super yummy. I have tried other recipes and have been disappointed with the outcome. Either the sauce wasn't pink enough or there was too much of a vodka taste. This recipe is perfect. Definitely a the pasta to the skillet and let it all cook together for 10 minutes like one reviewer suggested. DELICIOUS! I can't wait to make it again.

Very good however one big ingredient is missing: CHEESE! You must add parm to this sauce while tossing the pasta. The parm cheese will give tons of flavor and thicken the sauce.

This came out pretty good. I did add much more garlic because I love it. As recommended by others, I used a half pint of heavy cream and that worked well. I also added some parmesean cheese to the sauce to thcken it up a bit. Next time I will saute some onion to put in this sauce as well. Great sauce to build off of and customize!

I MAKE THIS WITHOUT THE VODKA (WITH OR WITHOUT IT) I ADD APX 1-2 TBLS. BROWN SUGAR THIS TAKES AWAY THE BITTERNESS OF THE TOMOATOES AND I LET IT SIMMER FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR IF NOT MORE AND IT GETS NICE AND THICK. I ALSO USE ONE OF THE BIG CANS OF CRUSHED TOMATOES A PINT OF WHIPPING CREAM AND FRESH BASIL LEAVES I SAUTEE ONIONS AND GARLIC IN OLIVE OIL AND ADD TO SAUCE AND LOTS OF CRUSHED GARLIC AS WELL, AND SERVE WTIH CRUSHED RED PEPPER ON THE SIDE

I usually go for the 5 star recipes when I try one, so this one sounded fairly easy, I made it, never altered it because everyone enjoys this one so much (well, I added 1/4th less heavy cream because I prefer a stronger flavor)but this is delicious, my husband and the rest of the family ask for this dish often.

Really great recipe!  I tweaked it only a little by using tomato puree since tomato chunks don't go over well in my house.  I also added sundried tomatoes to the sauce with the basil.  They add another great flavor and texture.

Made this tonight for 1 since hubby wasn't home for supper. Halved the recipe, added a sprinkle of sugar and crushed red pepper to the tomatoes, and had to use dried basil since I had no fresh (only use about 1 tbsp of the dried stuff-the flavor is much stronger than fresh). Also stirred in parmesan and romano cheeses with the cream. AMAZING! Will make again and again! (next time with chicken)

I love it with lots of creamy sauce so I made extra sauce. I pour some sauce on when the pasta is ready and then at the table I serve a gravy boat of extra sauce along with parmesan cheese.

This was very good.  Like others I added extra spices:  more garlic, basil, and Mrs. Dash seasoning.  Also I let the sauce sit for several hours.  The taste improved the longer it sat.  Left over sauce the next day was even better.  Lots of good reviews from my family and guests. Thanks for the recipe.

I used 1/3 cup vodka( what can I say I'm a drunk) and added chicken breast strips and asparagus to the sauce and tured out great.Had to thicken it up with a little corn strech.Will make it again next time using shrimp and broccoli.

Scrumptious indeed.  I made this for a few guests, one of them being a vegetarian.  I used fresh cherry tomatoes instead of canned.  It was consumed with much enthusiasm.

We LOVE this recipe. We added additional garlic, onions, red pepper flakes, grilled chicken and sun dried tomatoes. We only used 1/2 of the heavy cream.
Next time I'd like to add either shrimp & mushrooms! And switch to 1/2 & 1/2 cream. YUM

I tried this for the first time with some minor changes..  I used half the cream as others suggested.   When I cooked the garlic, I added some onion and PANCETTA bacon (so different from regular bacon, no comparison and it will make the dish) I didn't have any red pepper flakes so I threw in a pinch of ground red pepper and it was AMAZING!!

I would add more garlic, less of the sauce from the can of tomatoes and you do not need the whole pint of cream... 1/2 pint is plenty.  I also used more like a 1/2 cup of vodka.  Delicious sauce that you can make pretty quickly and it's not expensive... although it makes for a special dinner.  I suggest to taste it as you go and know that you can easily adjust this recipe to your personal taste.

This recipe is amazing!  I added the onions and bacon from the earlier version of this recipe (Penne a la vodka I) and it was delicious!  I also added parmesan cheese.

Wonderful!!  I took the advice from others and used diced tomatoes, some red pepper flakes, and added mushrooms.  I used the heavy cream.  It was great.  My husband loved it.  It is a keeper.

This turns out to be my wifes FAVORITE dish with just a couple alterations that for the most part have been listed already... but here they are again but maybe in a different order.  :)  I added about a teaspoon of red pepper, 3/4 tbs of salt and half the cream that was called for.  I marinaded 2 chicken breast halves that I had sliced up in a mixture of 1/4 C water 1/4 C olive oil and about 3 tbs of "Kick'n Chick'n" from Webber (all mixed prior to adding the chicken) for an hour and then grilled it in a fish basket till done. I kept the chicken seperate when serving but (as recommended by others) I put some sliced mushrooms in during the simmering.  I also added the proscuitto (that I had grilled slightly) and simmered that in for the last half as well.  I serve the chicken on side, make your own decisions here.    Oh baby!

I make it with 3-4x the garlic recommended and also more basil. I suggest using slightly less cream. A decent base recipe.

Love this dish. I use two tablespoons of butter instead of olive oil.  I add some chopped onion, use crushed tomatoes, and use only a half cup of cream. It is soooo good!

This recipe was absolutely amazing! I just made it for my family, and my brother (who rarely likes anything) asked for seconds and licked his plate! However, I did make some additions to the recipe. I added 1/2 a red bell pepper, 2 Italian garlic sausages, 1/2 package of mushrooms, and some Parmesan cheese. I also followed what I had read on here and added the pasta to the sauce and let it simmer while I stirred it for 5 minutes. It turned out absolutely delicious!!! Definitely the best Penne Vodka recipe out there!

This was delicious, it didn't come out runny at all. The sauce was a lovely orangish hue.
 I used heavy cream & I've also used half& half with success.
  I've added shallots when I had them.
 Asiago cheese grated into the sauce is a must- Good Grief this is good!
  You can substitute stewed tomatoes and tomato puree if you don't have the whole tomatoes on hand.
  A very nice Lenten recipe for meat-less Fridays. Was it just me or did anyone else not taste the vodka?
 Thanks, Liarose for a keeper.

AMAZING. Yummy. Please make this, you will LOVE it. I just finished the leftovers and it is only 8:30 pm. My husband and I couldn't stop eating and talking about this. So easy to make. Go ahead and use the full cream...treat yourself...then skip dessert. And use the best canned tomatoes you can find.

Solid basic recipe and the comment about cooking combined sauce and penne at the end is spot on. Serve it hot from the last stir to the table with a wine that can stand up to the spice and heat.

For this recipe, I add a good prosciutto, the cheaper domestic stuff, trimmed of all fat, and sliced really fine. Sautéed with the onions and garlic, it should be lightly browned. 

For dessert, after all that pepper and spice, cold fruits like pink lady apple or tangerines, cut cheese and a good white wine. 

Whole deal is two pots and some knife work and your people are fed like monarchs.

For something so easy, I was surprised at how delicious this is.  Ended up using diced tomatoes.  Did not have fresh basil, used Italian seasoning.  Still delicious.

This recipe calls for way too much cream, I would recommend only using a 1/2 a pint. Also as other reviewers have said the whole tomatoes only seem to water down the sauce without adding much flavor. The meals only saving grace was the pancetta I added. I will definitely be trying a different vodka pasta recipe next time. I do not recommend!

Fabulous recipe, we make it about once a month.  Half to 40% of the cream though, and it's still excellent, we don't like it too creamy :).  I usually chop the tomatoes in small pieces before adding to pan with juice from tin. Thank you Liarose :)

One of my favorite recipes!  I usually cut the heavy cream to about 1/2 pint.  Thanks for sharing!

Outstanding recipe...the only thing I do different is adding a package of portobello mushrooms.  This is the perfect recipe for company!

I though this was pretty good, but my husband was not thrilled. If you don't like creamy pasta dishes I would not recommend it.

I thought this was a good recipe to work from.  I doubled it, cause I like having leftovers in the fridge for the week.  I added shallots to the garlic mix, and 4 tsp of white sugar to the sauce mixture.  I should have added a little more sugar; sauce was a little bitter.  I added 3 cups heavy cream instead of 4 (again, I doubled the recipe).  Thanks.  :o)

This was great. The only thing I added was 1/2t red pepper flakes, some chopped onion, garlic salt and shrimp. It was a very light sauce and everybody loved it. Definitely a keeper!

Made this dish tonight and I liked it a lot. It wasn't perfect or close to the best Penne Vodka I've eaten, but it was close enough that it is worth making again. I did make some important changes though: for a 6 serving recipe I added 1/3 Cup FROZEN PEAS to the sauce during the last 6 minutes of it cooking, about a teaspoon of CRUSHED RED PEPPER FLAKES, a quick sprinkle of GARLIC SALT (you could add another 1/2 clove of garlic and some more salt instead, but I was out of garlic), 1/2 Cup of TOMATO PASTE to thicken things up and only 1 Cup of HEAVY CREAM. 2 Cups would have been too much in my opinion.  My girlfriend even commented that the frozen peas made a huge difference. I really suggest doing the peas thing. But over all I really enjoyed this dish. Delicious.

fantastic. I've made this three times and each time it tasted great. I always add a box of perdue chicken strips to add some protein. Also, I use cans of diced tomatoes because I think its easier to mash. Use a couple more cans than asked because I don't think it is enough sauce for a pound of penne

I've got to say the first time I tasted Penne a la Vodka I fell in love with it so I decided to find out how to make it. This recipe was nice and simple and I made my own modifications towards it little salt. black pepper and red pepper flakes. I made the sauce to the consistency that I wanted then mixed it together with the penne and grilled chicken while using the remaining half of the heavy cream. The family loved it....

I've made this now about 100 times. Instead of whole peeled tomatoes, I use Fire Roasted diced tomatoes with garlic. I add about 1 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp black & red pepper. I only use 1 cup heavy cream and I use vanilla vodka and it's out of this world!

This is a great recipe.  I did only use half a pint of heavy cream as I find that a whole pint is too much.  This is tasty and delicious.  I recommend adding bacon to the cooking garlic, as it adds a really nice flavour.  Then add the tomatoes, basil, salt and pepper.  I also add chili peppers when it is cooking to add a little heat also. A classic!!!

I made this vegan style with soymilk and it still came out great (and much healthier)! I also used one (14.5 oz) can of whole peeled tomato and one tomato sauce for a "smoother" sauce. Fresh basil is key, but I've also made it with dry and the sauce still tastes good! I also add about 1/4 cup finely diced white onion when cooking the garlic for an added level of flavor! Yum!

We loved it.  I used 25% heavy cream and 75% 1% milk so the fat content would be lowered.  It was still great.

This tasted as good as something you would get at a nice Italian restaurant.  I did use a half pint instead of a whole pint of heavy cream after reading other people's reviews, and I added 2 tablespoons of butter and a splash of milk.  I also added a generous helping of red pepper flakes...it needed that 'kick.' It was quite good.

This was very good. My sauce kept reducing so I added 1 can of tomato sauce. I used one cup heavy cream. For a little bit of a kick I added a dash of red pepper flakes, one small whole onion diced and a dash of nutmeg.

I just made this.  I added even less cream than called for, and i find it to be very thin, and pretty tasteless.  I added a ton of parmesean reggiano to add some flavor.  It worked, and is decent, but really doesn't taste like a la vodka.  If you live in a good city, with great italian restaurants, I don't suggest you try this.  I think you will be pretty disappointed.

What a wonderful pasta with minimal time and effort involved. Did reduce cream and added crushed red pepper flakes as others suggested. Also let pasta sit in sauce for at least an hour to allow the flavors to absorb. Will make again and again...

I have made this several times.  The base sauce is wonderful however, I do add mushrooms, asparagus, chicken and just regular bacon.  Sprinkle of parmesan on top.  Very easy and always a hit.I don't like penne so I use spaghetti instead.

This was very good. Used 4 cloves of fresh garlic (pressed) and crushed tomatoes instead of whole. I also used fat free half and half. My son,friend and husband ate it up. Next time I will make 1 1/2 lbs of penne and double the sauce.

This recipe was very good.  Like other reviewers, I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.  I don't use heavy cream or half and half too often so my family isn't used to rich foods.  I substituted fat free half and half which I had never tried before.  It worked great - the sauce thickened just like it's supposed to!  I probably used only 1/2 pint. I also added a pound of raw peeled shrimp to the tomato mixture.  When the shrimp were cooked through I added the half and half.  Finally I added the penne to the pan and mixed well.  Served each portion with a little parmigiano reggiano grated over the top. Everyone - even my picky kids - liked this recipe.  Next time I make this I'll add some kind of sausage  instead of the shrimp, just to change it up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe - giving it 4 stars because of the high fat content.

Here, in Utica, NY, we call this "Vodka Riggies", except there are hot peppers and parmesan cheese added to the sauce.  We have a festival every year, called Riggiefest, where restaurants fix this and variations for tasting and competition. It's a Central NY staple!

I made this recipe to please my 16 year old.  I left out the vodka; my son was the one to purchase the ingredients & is to young to buy alcohol.  The dish was great, there were no left overs.  This is defenately a dish I will make again, it was simple to make & had a great taste.

Great dish!  The only changes I made were: diced tomatoes with jalapenos (which gave it a nice kick) and 2 strips of bacon -diced very small.  The last minute I added fresh parmesan cheese.  We loved it!

I love this recipe, it's a favourite for next day lunches!  I changed it by  added red onion and thin strips of bacon and used only gluten free ingredients.  Everyone loves the taste - and they don't even know I make it gluten free!!

This was really good tastes exactly like a dish I get at one of my favorite restaurants.  I used diced tomatoes and only 1 tsp of minced garlic(personal preference).  I also added about a bag of spinach which I wilted with the water from the penne.  I loved it.  Thanks for the recipe

This is a really good one. I just used half of the heavy cream and added some half & half, and still tasted pretty good. I will make it again for sure.

This pasta is absolutely delicious!  Like I read in other reviews, I used 1/2 pint of the heavy cream and around 3/4 lb. of pasta.  SO good!!

This was pretty good, but I felt something was missing - don't know what.  Salt? Veggies? Followed recipe exactly, but used half-and-half instead of cream.

This was a great recipe.  I used diced tomatoes and tossed  prosciutto in at the end with the penne.  I did not drain the tomatoes.  To get this to reduce properly make sure you use a large skillet and let it bubble a bit during the first two simmers.  Everyone enjoyed this and was told I was "a wonderful cook".  Thanks!

After seeing how simple this recipe was I was skeptical that it could possibly rate 5 stars.  It, however, was very delicious.  I did follow a few reviewers suggestions and use fat free half and half and added a bit of red pepper but that was just due to personal preference.  I will make this over and over again.  Thank you.

Very good, but the sauce was a bit thin, didn't stick as well as I had hoped to the penne.  Could have been me, though! I used 1/2 and 1/2 as other reviewers had suggested, and used those gourmet tomatoes stewed in tomato puree and basil. Next time, I'll use the tomatoes I can drain & see if that helps thicken it up. Otherwise, I'll thicken with parmesan cheese.
Definitely will try this one again!

VERY DELICIOUS!  WE ADDED CHOPPED COOKED CHICKEN, COOKED SHRIMP AND PROSCIOUTTO (Sp?) IN THE FINAL STAGES AND THIS MADE THE DOUBLED RECIPE GO A LONG WAY FOR A NICE DINNER. WE ALSO FOUND THAT IF YOU MAKE IT AHEAD OF TIME AND LET IT SIT AND "GEL" FOR A WHILE IT TASTES SO MUCH MORE FLAVORFUL WHEN HEATED TO SERVE LATER. THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING!

I gave this 3 stars because it is a good base recipe, but we found it bland. We like a meat sauce, so I browned 1 lb of ground Italian sausage. Then I mixed in 2, 14oz cans of crushed tomatoes. Then I followed the directions as is. I added some Parmesan cheese to the cream sauce too.

Halved the cream as other reviewers have said and it came out fabulous!  Also, I don't like chunky tomatoes in my sauce so I used a can of tomato sauce rather than the whole peeled tomatoes.

Delicious but I amend the recipe a bit. I saute shallots with the garlic in the first step.  Also, when I add the tomatoes and basil in, I also put a few dashes of red pepper flakes and about a tablespoon of sugar in (to cut the bitterness). Always turns out great.

This was delicious!  I halved the cream and added mushrooms, spicy Italian sausage and an extra clove of garlic.  I will be making this again!  Next time I won't be so lazy and add some zucchini on the side.  Fantastic!

I made the penne vodka for the first time today Easter Sunday.... Omg... awesome especially it is the first time I made penne vodka....The thickness of the sauce was perfect with the 1lb. of pasta... I choosed the crushed tomatoes instead of the whole.

I have made this so many times and forgot to rate.
Good, pretty presentation, and easy. I do add more fresh basil and parsley, white wine instead of the vodka and just a tad of broth if  I want the sauce a little thinner. Over some
Fresh linguini, a salad and garlic bread.... YUMMY
Thank You for Sharing

Just finished making this dish, pilfered some penne smothered in the sauce. Follow the advice of other reviewers by reducing the amount of cream, a bit more vodka and added shredded parm cheese to the dish. I used spinach penne and thoroughly mixed the sauce w/ the cheese in a casserole dish and warmed it up a bit more to be served w/ turkey meatloaf. Yummy!! Can't wait for din-din.

This is so easy. When I made it people thought I put much more effort than what it was. I'm making it again tonight.

I made this last night. My husband and son loved it. Husband is very picky about tomato based sauces, and son does not like anything different. They loved it. It was easy and truly delicious. I served it alone...no bread, no cutlets, nothing. It was good enough to be on its own.

Great, quick dinner. My mother makes a very similar sauce that is great. I added fresh parsley along with the basil. Some crushed red peppers add some flavor too. Would make again!

The only thing I did differently was that I used dried basil because the grocery store was out of fresh. My boyfriend and I both felt as though the sauce was extremely plain and definitely missing something although we couldn't put our finger on what. I do not plan on ever making this recipe again or recommending  it to anyone else.

This needs a little quirking, but overall very good and very easy to make, even for an inexperienced cook.  As others suggested, I would definitely only use 1 cup of cream, and I used Hunt's Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes - gave it a lot more flavor!   I have made this for my mother-in-law two times and she absolutely loves it.

I took the advice of others and used crushed tomatoes and only one cup of cream and this was pretty amazing. I can't figure out how some people thought it was bland.. because it was far from that when I made it. Besides changing those two things I kept the recipe exactly the same.

I add a hot finger pepper, which I cut up and sautee with the garlic and basil.  I also only use half the cream, and let it simmer a little longer than suggested (otherwise it doesn't have near enough flavor).  And you'll want to interpret "salt and pepper to taste" rather liberally.  Great recipe though.  I always make it for guests, who usually request it again next time.

Definitely not quite what I was hoping for. Too creamy, not enough spices. Where are the onions? I had to add them on my own along iwth a lot more sauce.

This recipe makes a very good vegetarian Penne a la Vodka.  Definitely stick with the heavy cream -I tried using light cream and it was not as good as when I made it with the heavy cream.  I also like to add the pasta to the sauce at the end and cook it together, to thicken up the sauce a bit.

This stuff was AMAZING!  My hubby cannot stop talking about it!  I added grilled chicken to ours and a dash of red pepper flakes, and I used 1/2 the amount of heavy cream called for as recommended by others, but otherwise followed the recipe as is and it was PERFECT!  I'm definitely making this next time we have company.  Mmmmm!

Absolutely great!  I substituded the tomatos with diced tomatos with same can size and added sliced mushrooms.  Kim loved it and son actually liked it too.  Great and very easy for a quality dinner.  It was made as a side dish for breaded boneless pork chops, next just going to may chicken chuncks with it.  You won't be sorry for trying this.

I've made this twice already (using the adjustments that 'Lizard' made-used crushed tomatoes and 3/4 pint of cream) and love it! It's perfect and I'm going to make about 5lbs for my daughter's bday celebration, too! Thanks for the great recipe!

EUREKA - I found the recipe I have been searching for!  Now please note I gave this 4 stars as it is writen here (cos I found it a bit bland), but I did add a bit of chili peppers, a bit more garlic and garnish with fresh diced tomatoes and VOILA - 5 STARS! I think stewed tomatoes are important for coloring, you don't seem to get that with diced as much.  Also, you can use 3/4 or even 1/2 of the cream they use here.  Left overs heat up well too.

I loved this. I love creamy pasta, my husband loves tomatoe based pasta and this was a perfect blend. I added red pepper flakes and chicken. I didn't think it was necessary to do all the seperate simmering of each ingrediant so I shortened the simmer times of all of them except for the initial simmering of the tomatoes to burn off some of the juice. It turned out wonderfule. Next time I think I will add a little more vodka for taste. Great recipe!

Really, you don't have to change anything at all for this recipe, unless it's for your own tastes. Myself, I would probably use less red pepper. But please try as is and be thankful for a wonderful recipe!

Great recipe.  I added a little red pepper flakes to give it a kick and used Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2.  Turned out wonderful.

SO EASY - and tasty.  This was great - everyone in the house loved it(including the kids).  I didn't use fresh basil, because I don't like it - and the kids would be all like "what is the GREEN stuff!"

So good. I made the recipe as is, except with a little red pepper flakes. I think it would have been good either way. This recipe is work trying if you like pasta dishes. It was really easy to prepare and had enough for a large family. :D

I made this last night and stayed pretty much to the recipe. A couple small changes I made were I only had canned stewed tomatoes so I used them. I doubt that they changed the recipe much except that I think stewed tomatoes may have a little onion in them. The other thing I did was I was roasting garlic for dressing so I used three cloves of the roasted garlic instead of chopping the garlic. I think in the future I would use more roasted garlic or just chop the garlic instead because I love garlic and the roasted was a little bit tame for my taste. Other than that, I kept the recipe exactly as stated. It was wonderful. Served it to 10 friends and everyone loved it. For the meat eaters we also had chicken parmesan. What a yummy meal! I will definitely be making this again. Oh and I used 2 cups of heavy cream and made 1 1/2 lbs of pasta. It was not too creamy and I think because there is no butter in it, it did not taste too rich. Its a keeper!

This recipe is absolutely EASY and full of taste.  However; I added 4 cut up small chicken breasts, 1 extra clove of garlic, and some oregano.  I also used Whole wheat Penne pasta.  When I make this recipe again I will add 3 more cloves of garlic - totaling 6 cloves, a cup of diced onions, and a cup of sundried tomatoes along with everything else I added to begin with.  This is a great recipe and my kids really loved it - it's definately a recipe we'll make over and over.

This recipe was great and my family ate the entire servings.  I did however add a little more garlic and less cream then the recipe called for.  I would make this again, in fact my husband has told me it was a "keeper".

Amazing recipe! It got rave reviews all around. I added a touch of tomato sauce and when I tried it again I made it with shrimp (also works with chicken) which gave it a little something extra.

Yum! I love pasta with tomato vodka sauce at restaurants and was hoping to find something that was similiar that I could make at home.  This was super easy and pretty good - I think it could be a bit more flavorful, but still thought it worthy of 4 stars.  I sauted some shrimp with the garlic and tomatoes, set them aside when they were done and then put them back in just before serving so they didn't get overcooked.  I also added peas to the sauce.  A very nice Valentine's Day meal!

Used more vodka 2/3 cup and less half and half (trying to make it more figure friendly) about 1/4 cup.  I may use a little more half and half next time.  I really like this sauce.  My 2 1/2 year old was eating his pasta plain with cheese and asked for me to put sauce on his!  It must have smelled good to him too!

Did as others recommended and put in 3/4s of a pint of heavy cream. Also, by the time the dish was finished... I ended up putting about 1 tsp of salt and about 1/4 tsp of pepper. Very delicious and everyone loved it!

If you want thicker sauce, you need to let it sit off the stove for 10-15 minutes. Then, reheat prior to serving.  I also added only 3/4 pint of heavy cream and I think only 1/2 would have been fine too. Finally, I found that the sauce was too sour for my taste so I added some sugar.  It tasted great after that.

We add 1/2 jar of sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and thinly sliced, and a dash of crushed red pepper flakes once the cream is added. We also add 1 pound of peeled, raw shrimp in the last three to five minutes of cooking time.  Also, do not add the basil until the end, unless you like wilted strings in your sauce.

This is really good and easy to make.  I used non-fat plain yogurt, instead of cream, to cut calories.  That made it probably more tangy than it would have been.  Maybe half yogurt and half cream  or possibly 2/3 yogurt, 1/3 cream would make it smoother.

With some homemade soft bread sticks and salad, this is a delicious meal.

The sauce was awesome.

I did end up using less cream then the recipe called for and it turned out glorious.  Only giving 4 stars because I did mod the recipe.

Very yummy!  My husband requested that I make it again, and he never does that!  I used petite diced tomatoes, added a bit of onion and reduced the heavy cream just a little.  It was perfect!

This is delicious but I did make a few changes.  I cut the cream in half and used evaporated milk so that it wasn't as "heavy" and added crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little more flavor.  Also, I did not like the idea of using whole peeled tomatoes so I used crushed instead.  It is wonderful!  I would give it a 5 but since I strayed from the original recipe I am giving it a 4.

this recipe was great!! i added half a can of evaporated milk instead of heavy cream to help the calories and not as much basil just because of personal preference. i also tossed in some browned italian sausage that i had leftover. turned out fabulously!!

This was Ok.  I thought I would try it for something a little different.  It seemed too bland. Sorry.

So good.  I have made this with and without the vodka.  Both ways are tasty.  Generally I serve it with Penne and Shrimp.  I also add a little crushed red pepper and sometimes use half and half instead of cream.  Really great recipe love by all in my family.

I thought the flavours in this recipe were delicious.  Following some of the suggestions, I blended some of the tomatoes to make a less chunky sauce and added an extra clove of garlic.  However, I had a difficult time getting ths sauce to thicken within the alloted time.  Perhaps I should have drained the tomatoes?  Had to add some parmesan and starch to thicken it up, but it was a hit :)

I made this for book club and it was a big hit.  I found that I did not need as much cream as listed - in fact I used half and it almost looked like too much.  I also sprinked in a touch of cayenne pepper which gave it a nice kick.  I used canned, diced tomatos and blended half of them in the blender and left they others diced to make a little variation in the sauce.  This is the kind of recipe that is quick and easy and makes your kitchen smell delicious!

Used chunky crushed tomatoes instead and half/half and it turned out wonderfully.  Not low fat, but sooooo good!

This recipe was great.  I fixed it for my fiancee and she loved it, she says she loves it almost as much as she loves me.  She tells me she was kidding, but I know the truth.  I think that the next time I make it, I will use 4 ounces of half and half just because we wanted the sauce to have bit more of a tang to it.

This was an exellent recipe!  The sauce also tastes great over potato gnocchi in the place of the penne.  Like others recommended, I used dice tomatoes insteard of whole tomatoes, half and half instead of heavy cream, and added 1 tsp. of sugar.

I really wanted to try this recipe, but unforunately my husband is lactose intolerant. I decided to try it anyway, but instead of using the cream, I substituted 1 3/4 cup low-lactose yogurt ("BioBest") and 1/4 cup lactose-free milk. It probably wasn't the same consisitency, but it tasted great, and my husband reported no ill effects! Someday when he's not around I'll have to try it with cream so i can compare.

Good, but needs some changes. I’ve made this twice. Once following the recipe, the second time changing it to how I think it should be. DO NOT Use the whole pint of cream. It makes it too milky.

Great recipe. One easy step to take to enhance it is to boil and shred some chicken and toss it with the pasta sauce at the very end. I also add a little bit of smoked paprika to make it sweeter, but that comes down to personal preference and I only discovered this effect because I accidentally mixed up my pepper and paprika, so YMMV.

Added  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano at the end and have added sliced cooked chicken or Italian sausage, as well as crushed red pepper.  This recipe is spectacular and I have received so many compliments when I’ve served it to guests.  Fabulous dinner entree!

cut the whipping cream to about 3/4 of a pint, added onions on when the tomatoes were simmering. recipe came out great and it was good for meal prepping too. way too much for the 2 of us so we have enough for a side for a couple more meals.

I sauteed porcini mushrooms and zucchini first, then added a dash of red pepper flakes, along with Herbamare salt and oregano and a touch of garlic powder. Also browned sausage and added that at the end. A great meal that lasts for days. I have used half and half before and even creme fraiche--both great substitutes.

This is a very good recipe for busy, after work evenings. Simple, fast and restaurant quality. I added chicken, good quality real Italian whole peeled tomatoes and a pinch of red pepper flakes. My rating is based on the recipe as presented and I would easily give it 5 stars with these simple changes. It's going in our regular rotation!

Very good recipe.
I added oven baked salmon and asparagus, cut into small pieces and allowed to simmer with the penne sauce mix. Yum!

I made this today for the first time and I made a few changes. I used crushed tomatoes (28oz) instead of peeled and added a small can of diced tomatoes (14oz). I added about 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper and used about 4 garlic cloves as opposed to two. I also used about half the amount of heavy cream. With these changes the sauce came out phenomenal! As it sits, the sauce does get a little thicker. Definitely making this again!

I made penne a la amaretto because I had no vodka but had amaretto liqueur. It was sweeter so I added more seasonings and chili powder to cut out the sweetness. I also added chicken sausage and shredded Parmesan and Romano cheese. It was delicious!

I used crushed tomatoes instead of the peeled and I used slightly less cream at the end and it came out phenomenal! Even my picky daughter absolutely loved it. This was my first time making this dish and it will become a regular staple in our home!

I have made this recipe at least half a dozen times, and I have one word for it: Bland!!!!

Every time I have made this recipe, it comes out very bland. I have tried making the recipe as provided... I have tried crushed tomatoes... I have tried pureed tomatos... I have tried different Vodkas... less heavy cream... different heat levels... adding parmesan cheese, etc., etc., etc., and it always turns out bland. I added crushed red pepper, as another reviewer had recommended, but it did little to help the flavor of the sauce. I'm giving up on this recipe and trying another one.

Easy to make! I'm new to cooking and it came out perfectly! But the recipe is huge and I didn't think that it microwaved well, so if you're just cooking for one or two you might want to halve the recipe.

My kids and I love this sauce!  I did make two slight changes. I did a quick pulse blend to break up tomatoes  before I added them to the pan. My kids didn't like the chunks. Also, I used only about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  Way too creamy with original amount. Overall delicious!

Family loved it..thanks!

 I sautéed a small, chopped onion and didn't use the entire pint of heavy cream only because I used some for another recipe..was still very good. I don't think the entire pint is necessary.

Tasty recipe, I sautéed 1lb of shrimp and added it soon after the cream. Well actually I used a half pint of half and half. I suggest tempering the cream so it doesn't curdle. Put the cream in a bowl and add some of the heated sauce by the spoonful until it's warm.

Made this tonight for my family, and they loved it..the fresh basil is just soooo good, we love fresh ingredients! I did cut back some on the cream, it still made plenty and I used petite diced tomatoes.   This was easy to make and it's like being at a restaurant.. Thanks for the recipe : )

Really delicious.  My kids loved it too.  In my experience it's easier to break up the tomatoes after they've cooked for a while.  I also would add another can of them and a bit more garlic.  Just my taste though.  I will be making this again.

Excellent recipe.  Used diced tomatoes with garlic & oil, put in food processor for a few seconds.  Also added 8oz can of tomato sauce to thicken. Took up pasta early and cooked it in sauce for 2 minutes.  Yum

Great pasta dish!  I followed the instructions as directed and it turned out great!  I used rotini since I didn't have penne pasta and I doubled the amount of vodka!!  Ha! ha! ha!  I served it with citrus glazed chicken and a bottle of Chardonnay!  Great combination!!

I made this for my in-laws and I followed the recipe.  However the sauce seemed liquidy and not thick like I was used to eating at resturants.  I suggest you let it sit in the pan for at least 5-10mins before serving.  The second time I made the recipe I added peeled and deveined shirmp (about 16-20 per pound size, 1 pound bag) and assuming they would give off some juices I drained about 1/4 cup of the juice from the canned diced tomatoes I used and the sauce still seemed thin, but I let it stand as I said and it was better.  I did also add some fresh grated parmasan cheese and tossed before serving which made it a little more salty which is what I thought it was lacking in the flavor.

This was awesome.  My kids don't like spaghetti (w/e!) but they really loved this meal and it tasted like restaurant quality to me, but it was SO simple!  I did double the garlic in it though!! Yummmm!

I usually don't cook with salt. When I don't cook with salt, my dishes come out tasting great with out it. So when I made this dish, I didn't mix in the salt and I didn't like the flavor at all. The flavor was awful. But then I decided to add a little salt to it and it tasted better. So if you don't like cooking with salt, this dish is not for you. Otherwise, with the salt its ok.

very good, the only thing that I did different is that I added two cans of peeled whole tomatoes and just 3/4 of the heavy cream. Other then that every one really enjoyed it.

I made this recipe last night and like many of the other reviewers found it bland...Lacking in something, not bad, but rather blah...Comes out great If you like a very lightly flavored "tomato" [in quotes do to the very mild flavor that they bring to the dish]cream sauce, but if you like a bolder flavor like I do try a different recipe

This is one of my favorite entrees to order in Italian restaurants, so I was very happy to learn that I can make it easily at home.  It was delicious!  I'm going to add a few chili peppers next time.  The fresh basil from my garden was great with this recipe.  Thanks!

So Delicious!!!  My (meat loving) husband thought this was fantastic, and had seconds or thirds.  I got rave reviews from him which are few and far between.  I will definitely be making this again (and again)!!!  I used jarred minced garlic instead of fresh because that's what was on hand, and like other reviewers, I also used diced or crushed (I forget which one) canned tomatoes. I realized after I'd gotten started that the bottle in the cupboard I thought was vodka was actually rum.  So I made a mad dash to the store and ended up letting the tomato mixture simmer for about 30 minutes instead of 15.  It was a quite thick because of that, but still turned out deliciously!!  The smell while it was cooking was so good!  And the leftovers were really great also. Definitely a keeper!

This recipie is so good.  I keep having to print myself a new one becuase I have to give the recipie out everytime I make it.  
If I have a lot left over I put it in a casserole dish with some chicken, parmesan and mozzerella and bake it for about 45 minutes for dinner another night.

This was very good!  I did change a couple things...I added onion and chopped prosciutto when cooking the garlic(the one other time I had this dish it had onions & proscuitto).  I also used diced tomatoes instead of whole.  This is a great change from everyday red sauce.  Great for a casual dinner or entertaining.

This recipe was pretty good. It was a little too bland for me but my husband and son loved it. I added chicken to it.
