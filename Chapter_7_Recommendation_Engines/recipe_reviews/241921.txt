This is a very good basic pasta dough recipe. If you are going to pass the dough through a pasta machine right away (like I did), you can let the pasta machine do most of the kneading for you. I set my machine on #6 and pass the dough through 5-6 times until nice and smooth, folding in half and turning the dough each time before passing it through the machine. Once the dough is nice and smooth, set the machine on #2 and pass it through just once. Place the long sheets of dough on a lightly floured surface, and then cut into your desired shape.

I did not add any salt.  After I had my dough mixed and kneaded I wrapped it in plastic wrap while I got everything set up.  I divided into 4 pieces and re-wrapped 3 of the pieces to keep moist.  This was my first time making pasta and it came out wonderful!

Just got a pasta roller and cutter for my machine and was so excited to try this. It was so good! Thank you! I'm not sure if it's me or the water where I live, but I have to double the amount of water. I've used this recipe 4 times now and I consistently have to adjust the water. Again, I know that humidity, temp, etc have a lot to do with it. I would encourage others to try this out and  work with their dough. Finally, I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and it was great.

Wasn't too bad needed more water where I live than the recipe called for but that is normal for a recipe to have differences like that. Didn't make a lot of pasta only enough for 2 people.

My dad's recipe that I use is similar to this, and a bit smaller. Good for me,  since I hand roll the dough by hand. It's work, but we'll worth it. 

When I make the pasta dough,  I add additional seasonings also. The bowl I made today was ribbon pasta infused with garlic and onion to be the bed for beef stroganoff. Delish!

This was excellent! I mixed the dough in my cuisinart on the dough setting and rolled it out and cut fettuccini with my kitchen aide pasta attachment. Topped with my homemade pasta sauce made with pork steak and San Marzano tomatoes and fresh herbs and served with a glass of Chianti I was one happy girl. This is my new favorite pasta recipe!

I've made this recipe with both all purpose flour and 00 flour and found the 00flour was much easier to use and made the pasta texture even better!

I would totally make this again. I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat, so I needed more water, but it was so good!  I don’t have a pasta maker, so I cut the dough in four pieces then rolled it out really thin with a rolling pin.  Then I cut it with a pizza cutter.  Not very pretty, but yum!

I wrote the recipe down, and took a picture of the recipe too. I did add an additional tablespoon of warm water, but the  recipe was  so easy to follow. I made lasagna and spaghetti. I baked the lasagna tonight for supper, and the whole Family was impressed. Thank you for sharing.

Fairly basic recipe but delish. It does need more water to bring the dough together.

Pasta dough is a very simple recipe. 
I like the addition of olive oil in this one. 
Sadly had no Olive oil on my shelf. 
Simply substituted canola vegetable oil. Thus I made the poor mans version. 
Still homemade pasta is leaps above out of the box variety. Not sure why but suspect it’s the fresh eggs.

If you’ve never made fresh pasta. You owe it to yourself to give it a try.
  
Not many ways to make an exotic meal for under two dollars. Home made pasta qualifies as a crowd pleaser.

For special occasions. I suggest using the best eggs you can purchase. “organic”. I am blessed with having good friends with free range chickens on there farm. Which have a good portion of Illinois insects in there diet. Fried over easy in a skillet for breakfast they are a little better than the dollar a dozen bargain eggs.  However when used in pasta and noodle dough. Some level of culinary nirvana is reached.  The raw dough also smells better.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make. It was my first time making a homemade pasta dough and using the pasta maker. It made a decent amount and was delicious!

Second attempt making pasta, first was a Kitchenaid recipe that didnt work very well, this one was much better! Pasta was soft and stretchy and rolled out much better in the Kitchenaid attachment. We let half of the dough sit, the rest we rolled and cut right away into fettucine. Some of the dough shredded coming out but it was mostly fixed by folding it up and running through again. Other recipes say to let the pasta sit, but I didnt see it here, so just used it right away. We are waiting for pasta to dry now, which is also optional from what I read but makes it a little easier to handle. Great recipe! Thanks!
