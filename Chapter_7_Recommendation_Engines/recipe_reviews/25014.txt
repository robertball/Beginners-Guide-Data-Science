I followed other reviewers' ideas by decreasing the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Because some had said the brownies weren't chewy enough I added 1 tbsp cooking oil with the butter. Others had said it was too floury-tasting so I decreased the flour to 2/3 cup. And I decreased the baking powder to 3/4 tsp. Also, I baked them til they were just brown around the edges, about 23 minutes.   And --- TA-DA! I ended up with moist, chewy brownies. I halved the frosting recipe, and it was just the right amount; not overly thick or sweet. What a pleasant change from chocolate brownies, with a lighter and more delicate flavor. We loved them with the recipe changes I made.

The icing ruined it for me i'm afraid. Way too sweet!!(stick to the roof of your mouth sweet). Its saving grace was the chewy, almost cookie like brownie. If i make them again, it will definately be with a different icing. Thanks for the brownie recipe anyway...

These were much closer to a cookie bar texture than to the expected soft brownie tecture.

I halved the brown sugar as I dislike overly sugary desserts. There was just enough dough to spread into an 8x8 pan. 

My guests considered the bars delicious. I wished they had a little more variety in taste. Should I make them again I would include a smidgen of ginger and a dash of cinnamon.

Frosting is very sweet - should be used as a drizzle rather than a cover.

AMAZING RECIPE!!!! I made it and everyone at work lost their minds over it. One modification I made was the frosting. I used skim milk and added more milk and confectioner's sugar until it was pretty runny. I spooned a few hot tbsp over the cooled brownies and tilted the pan to coat. Perfect caramel sauce!

I just made these brownies today.  They smelled wonderful and tasted even better.  I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfectly.  I did, however, add a few things....toasted chopped walnuts and pecans as well as butterscotch chips.  About 1/4 C of each ingredient.  You don't want to add too many butterscotch chips since that would make the brownies even sweeter then they already are.  I also believe that adding the icing is a mistake.  All I did was wait until the brownies cooled and sprinkled them with powdered sugar.  That was perfect.  Also I used an 8x8 pan and cut the brownies 5 down and 5 across making a total of 25 pcs.  Since the brownies are so rich, a small piece is all you need to satisfy your sweet tooth.  THESE BROWNIES HAVE A WONDERFUL RICH BUTTERSCOTCH FLAVOR.  Absolutely will make again!  Oh yeah they did settle just a tiny bit in the middle but most brownies will do that.  Try them, you'll like them...for sure!!!!

This is the first time I've ever tried making butterscotch brownies, and I'm pretty happy with them. They came out nice and chewy, with a good flavor. I left out the nuts because I didn't have any. As other reviewers have mentioned, the frosting makes these super-sweet, so keep a glass of milk or a cup of coffee on hand! :-)

Awesome! These brownies disappeared in our home. I've been looking for a good butterscotch brownie recipe since losing my old time favorite one. This is a keeper!

I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, baked 28 minutes, and the brownies came out quite dry.  Perhaps reducing the sugar to make them not too sweet as other reviewers reported, made a difference in their texture.

I had to omit the nuts b/c my hubbie doesn't eat them. but I made this in the spur of the minute while I was craving sweets. I couldn't find my bakg pwd (until after!) so I subbed with a tickle of bkg soda and half cup sour cream. ohhh wee so good. BUT frosting is still 2 sweet for my husband even though I almost halved the sugar in the cake and the frosting. guess I shouldn't have added those butterscotch chips on top ummmmm so good!

LOVE these!! Super easy to make, even my 4 y/o helped. I made the recipe as is. They are SUPER sweet, but I love it that way. I used a 9x13 stoneware pan and baked for 20 min. They were a bit thin, but chewy and yummy. A keeper!

I would refer to these as just a chocolate chip pan cookies.  I didn't really get a lot of butterscotch flavor coming through.  After making the brownies, and tasting a little, I opted not to make the icing, and instead drizzled them with caramel.  My kids each had one, but the rest of the pan did not get eaten.

These were very good but VERY sweet! That might be somewhat due to the fact that i added chocolate chips instead of the walnuts but i think it would have been too sweet for my taste either way. I would make these again but cut the sugar down.

I liked the brownies and the frosting, but best eaten immediately as they began to dry out on the second day.

They were okay without the icing, but once that was added they were way too sweet. Also after a day they were very dry and hard. Will not make again.

First, this recipe says it serves 25, but it uses an 8x8 pan.  I guess that would be one bite per person.  I doubled the recipe.  The sides bake up the side of the pan and the middle stays flat (as others have reported).   They taste ok, when fresh, but can't say there's a real butterscotch taste.  After a day they are very dry (also as others have reported).  I won't make again.

This is my favorite butterscotch brownie recipe (without frosting) that I make frequently when I need to take dessert somewhere.  I do not cut until I am at my destination as I would want to eat them instead of share them.

I make the recipe for the brownies and then put cream cheese frosting topped with toffee bits.  I love them SO much.  Can't say anything about the frosting as I've never tried it.

I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour, and the brownies tasted great. A little dense, and not too sweet, but it was perfect. For the icing, I read some reviews and tried to halve the recipe. I would not do that next time - there was not enough frosting, and it just looked sloppy when I spread it on the brownies. Next time, I will use the full amount.

The brownies themselves turned out so good that while they were cooling my boyfriend and I couldn't help but break off pieces of it to sample. When it actually cooled and I frosted them, I thought the frosting made them terrible. It was way too sweet at that point and we ended up scraping as much as the frosting off as we could. I would suggest leaving the brownies plain.

Excellent! I have made these twice and they always come out SO GOOD! I can't get the end product to be even in the pan though...the sides are always higher than the middle. But the delicious frosting covers it up! The frosting absolutely MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH! Bake for the full recommended time...great recipe!

My family loved these brownies. I doubled the recipe exactly as written, but the batter looked more like cookie dough. Worried they would come out dry, I added 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. veg. oil to my doubled recipe, and this gave it more of a batter consistency. They took about 45 min. to bake, but came out great. Will definitely make these again.

These were fantastic!!!  This is what I did:  First, I followed another commenter's advice and changed the portions to the following: Reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, reduced the flour to 2/3 cup, and reduced the baking powder to 3/4 tsp.  Also, the boyfriend is allergic to nuts so I substituted butterscotch chips for the walnuts.  Then, I realized I definitely did not have enough filling to fill an 8 X 8 pan so I doubled the recipe, with the previous adjustments, and then added that to the first batch I made.  Perfect!  It came out perfectly!  I was planning on adding the frosting but ended up omitting it; I think it would have made them too sweet.  These definitely are really sweet.  They're kind of light and airy though, so they the sweetness isn't overwhelming; it's not too rich and filling.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I don't like frosting so I just made the brownies (minus the nuts since I didn't have any on hand), and they were delicious!  Buttery and sweet, but not too sweet.  They deflated to half their height after I took them out of the oven, but I actually liked them better that way...I think it's what made them so chewy.  I loved how simple the recipe was, and I would definitely make this again!

I doubled the recipe and used a 1&1/2 quart baking dish. Produced a nice, thick, chewy golden brownie. Yum! I didn't bother with the icing, plain is perfect. Cooking time for me was approx. 35 min. Oh, and I changed the walnuts to butterscotch chips. Enjoy!

I'm in the process of making this... the batter tastes very good. I made some butterscotch brownies at the school I work at today (from a mix) and this tastes very similar! I added chocolate chips, and instead of frosting, sprinkled powdered sugar over, then topped with chocolate and carmel syrup! MMmmmm! Very good!

This was such a great hit.  I have to hide them from myself or I'll eat them all at once!

I was looking for a butterscotch brownie recipe that I rememberd from when I was a kid.  This recipe sounded like it would work.  I tried it an it turned out great!  In fact, after I made them, my family of 5 had them gone in half an hour and I had to make another (double) batch!  I followed the recipe for the brownies exactly, but left off the icing.  Definitley a keeper.

Something went horribly horribly wrong with this recipe.  I made one batch, and they turned out so-so, although I had the same problem with the sides being way higher than the center.  I decided to make a second batch so that my son could take some to school for Valentines Day, and I have no idea what happened, because the center didn't rise at all!!  I can't think of what I did differently!  My advice is, if you try this recipe, follow the direction to a 'T', is seems to be very touchy!

This rating is for the brownies only. The frosting got such consistently bad reviews I decided it wasn't worth the time or ingredients. This is absolutely sweet enough without the frosting; to get more of that butterscotch flavor (rather than just brown sugar) I added about 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips. The brownies are quite good; it does help to cut back on the flour a bit (I cut back to 2/3 cup) and I cut back on the sugar since I knew I was adding the chips. The reviews were all over the place on this one and everybody who made it as written gave it really poor reviews, so I was apprehensive but I love butterscotch so I gave it a shot w/the changes mentioned above (a compilation of the most popular adjustments from other reviews) and I think it came out pretty good. I'd make it again but with those changes. Thanks for sharing your recipe; it was great for my sweet tooth fix :)

Just finished making them and they were AWESOME!!  However, I am still on the search for something I think was a butterscotch brownie that I ate 10 years ago..  I did the 2/3 flour and maybe I will add more next time to get a different consistency.  This doubled pan will surely be gone by tomorrow.  ::yay::

the brownie itslef was pretty good, but very chewy.  But I really dont recomend using the frosting included in the recipe. It was very gritty and just tasted like sugar. A buttercream or penuche frosting would be great on these. Or just melted butterscotch chips.

I really like these. I did leave off the icing though- I wanted something that wasn't too overwhelmingly sweet. I have to remove these from my house after I make them, otherwise I'll eat them all in 24-36 hours. No joke!

My husband tried some butterscotch brownies made by a friends wife and loved them so I was on a mission to find a good recipe and I found it. He LOVED these, at the whole pan practically in one day. If you follow the directions to a T and bake the time and make it like it says turns out, the corners were a little higher though?

I hate to ruin the party, but this was way, way too sweet for me (and I have quite a sweet tooth). All I could taste was sugar, no real flavor.

I just made them for the 1st time and they are terrific! I had no problem with the sides being higher than the middle, but I do agree you need to cook them for the full time. The frosting is fabulous! The brownies are so good I may try them without the frosting next time, but then again, why? This is going into my "good and easy" recipes to be enjoyed again and again. Try them! You'll love them!!

This recipe has no butterscotch anywhere in it. This turned out more like a cookie  than a brownie. Will not make this ever again.

These were way too sweet.  Also,I put the correct amount of flour in but they came out tasting like I put too much flour in them.  Not making these again.

These were cheap to make - just a bunch of ingredients I already had around the house.  They're a little too sugary, which can be good in a way, because it keeps me from eating too many.

Yummy!  I make these in a pie plate and cut them into wedges.  Instead of the topping suggested I just melted some chocolate in a double boiler w/ a dab of butter and cream and spread it on top.  My friends love when I make this.

These are really good- so chewy and have a great butterscotch flavor.  They are very sweet (almost too sweet), so I almost rated them a 4, but they're so good that I rated them 5.  Maybe one could decrease the sugar in the brownie.  I wouldn't decrease the frosting sugar because it might not turn out right.  Very easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and baked about 28 minutes.

These were really good- but they could be great. I doubled the recipe to fit into a 9 X 11 pan - but they still weren't as thick as a brownie should be. Next time, I'll double the recipe for a 8 X 8 pan, or I'll quad the recipe for a 9 X 11 pan. I added butterscotch chips to the batter - and it added a lot of yum.

Like others, I didn't add the frosting.  It probably would have been good with it but I know I love it without, so why mess with a good thing.  This is a favorite of my family and they request it every holiday.

for some reason my brownies were a bit dry and crumbly and i cooked them only for 25 minutes. The frosting was delicious though (thumbs up ) my husband loves it . I added some butterscotch chips into the mix and into the frosting ..taste pretty good...
