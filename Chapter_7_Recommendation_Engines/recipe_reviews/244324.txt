8.7.16    Recipe submitter says this is "highly customizable," so I did use a plum instead of a peach and garnished with some GhirardelliÂ® white chocolate shavings.  As I suspected, nothing not to like here, it's a bit decadent tasting.  Husband said I can make this one ANYTIME!

Delicious flavor combination - but I did customize by using frozen peaches, Greek Yogurt, cocao powder, maple syrup, vanilla and enough milk to blend everything well in my Nutribullet.  Will make again for sure, maybe adding some oatmeal to make it a breakfast smoothie.
