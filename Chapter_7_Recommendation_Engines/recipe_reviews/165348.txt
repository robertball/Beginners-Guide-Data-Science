This recipe is good, however, it is better if a mixture of ground veal and pork/Italian sausage were incorporated with the beef. Ground beef/hamburger does NOT impart the same flavour and this mixutre gives the sauce a richer flavour. Rather than dried basil, throw in a handful of fresh basil about 30 minutes before the sauce is finished with fresh garlic and red wine. This I learned while attending an Italian cooking class.

I've been making this recipe for several yrs minus the bacon and wine bc I never have it.  I also add 1 tsp of Cayanne pepper for some bit.  Everyone who eats it LOVES it.  Sometimes I add 1/2 burger and 1/2 Italian sausage.  Always is a hit.

This is a very tasty recipe. Be sure to use a good wine you would actually drink, not some cheap wine. Definitely not a sweet wine. I do prefer to combine good fresh sausage instead of solely ground beef. At times I have also substituted bison for the ground beef. Try using ground chuck for a meatier taste.
