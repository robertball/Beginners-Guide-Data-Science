These are so yummy!  I always get rave reviews when I make these.  I like to use chocolate graham crackers, and all butter instead of the margerine.  I also sprinkle my pecans on after the glaze.  They stay put that way and get a little extra toasting.

Mom loves this.  I used a full pack of graham crackers, and added a dash of vanilla.  Scattered pecans under and on the butter mixture.  Cooked 8-9 minutes to prevent burning.  Used Pam on the foil, and I'm glad that I did.  They were very easy to make- if you are using a flat cookie sheet, be sure to turn the edges of the foil upward to keep the liquid, which spreads out a lot during baking, from overflowing.  I did have some problems with my graham crackers "shifting" during cooking.  Cut into triangles for a beautiful presentation.  I found them slightly too buttery in feel and taste, but still quite good.

I went looking for this recipe after tasting some at a bake sale.  I've made this recipe 2 times since then and neither batch has lasted longer than 24 hours!  They are very easy to prepare, but be warned:  They're hard to stop eating after you start.

I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar. Turned out just great.  I think next time if I make them I will use butter crackers instead of graham crackers.  These should soak up the glaze better.

Well I have been wanting to make these forever and finally got around to it. They turned out really yummy...kinda like pecan pie only so much easier. I'm not sure why the recipe calls for margarine and butter. I used all butter and they turned out fine. Also, not sure why the stove top mixture has to boil for three minutes. I was afraid it would taste burnt so as soon as it was nice and thick I spooned it over the crackers. Overall really good

We loved, loved, loved this recipe. I used a sleeve and a half of cinnimon grahams and since I didn't have enough pecans I used some walnuts too. I spinkled some nuts on before the butter mixture and the rest after. I also used all butter as well as a little vanilla extract. The sauce was a little thin so I then added some brown sugar and that made this a favorite here that I will definately make again and again.

These were okay.  I thought they could use more flavor.  I'd do 1.5 times the sugar/butter mixture so they're thoroughly coated, and definitely don't leave them in for 12 minutes, unless you're doing it at a lower temp.  My friend makes something similar but uses Saltines instead of graham crackers, doesn't use nuts, and puts chocolate chips on as soon as it comes out of the oven, spreading them once they've started to melt so it's a pretty smooth layer of chocolate.  Wicked good that way; so-so when done the way this recipe's written.

This tastes soooo goood!  I did take some of the suggestions: used brown sugar instead of white, crushed some Ritz crackers over the graham crackers, used cinnamon graham crackers (all I had) and sprinkled coconut over the topping before I baked it.  Warning: THEY ARE ADDICTING!

I didn't like these. Maybe I just didn't cover the graham crackers well enough with the sauce, but they tasted way too toasted and crunchy (and I only kept them in the oven for 10 minutes instead of 12). Might have been better if completely soaked in sauce without any bare cracker exposed. I don't think I'll make them again though.

Highly addictive!  It taste like a softer version of almond roca kind of.  I used a mix of pecan and walnuts (didn't measure), 9x13 pan using almost a whole sleeve of graham crackers, 3/4 cup of all butter, brown sugar, and a dash of vanilla.

I used the suggestion of club crackers and used pecan chips instead of chopped. I also added coconut to half a batch. A quick, easy, and delicious treat! I've already passed on the recipe to 2 coworkers who absolutely loved these! I will be making them again.

This was surprisingly good! And ever so quick.  After reading the reviews, I used only 1/2 cup butter (skipped the margarine) and I blended in a good sized  spoon of dark corn syrup after I cooked the sugar and butter.  I really like the flavor mix... like pralines.  I might try maple syrup next time.  It was just the right amount to make a thick coat for the crackers that fit in an 11 x 7 pan.   I baked them nine minutes and they were fine.  I think they'd set up more like 'brittle' if I'd baked them longer, though.

I have made these countless times, and countless ways and they're always a hit. 
I've made a batch with coconut, added chocolate to another, and have also used them with ice cream.  Once on the bottom of a bowl with vanilla ice cream on top sprinkled with more pecans, and another time I made ice cream sandwiches with them.  At Christmas I dip one half in white choclate and let the chocolate harden , and dip the other half in milk or dark chocolate.  Put in a tin with a bow, and your present will become the most requested!!! 
The best part is everyone will think you spent hours making them!!!  :)

Used cinnamon graham crackers. Didn't let sauce boil 3 minutes -- just brought to a boil and then spread on crackers. We couldn't wait 'til they cooled all the way though...yummy warm.  Nice afterschool treat.

Excellent, I did double the recipe for the topping as the first batch was not enough to cover the crackers.

These turned out fabulous. My husband asked if they were hard to make and I replied no so he said would you make more soon? I put the graham crackers on the cookie sheet with parchment paper and they were  so easy to remove when they cooled. Great

I did try and I was not sure if all the glaze was for the one layer of grahams. I made the mistake of putting foil down and not a good idea for clean up as I could not get off foil and most broke. so do not use foil. Very good would make again but very greasy from the butter. Would make again. family loved them.

First let me say that the crackers are incredibly delicious and decadent. However, I wish I would have sprayed the cookie sheet with spray olive oil. They really stuck to pan - or I didn't take them off the pan soon enough and they cooled to the pan. I added a dash of cinnamon. Good, Good, Good and a little of the butter toffee topping for a bowl of ice cream!

These were incredibly simple to make. Big hit with the guests with plenty leftover. I froze the leftovers and guess what... these taste even better frozen! DIdn't change anything in the recipe.

Wow, these are really good, and very easy to make as well.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I'd like to try the variation suggested by another reviewer and use club crackers or Saltines to get the sweet/salty combo.  It's really hard to stop eating these once you start!

This recipe was wonderful...definitely a hit with my family.  They finished it all!  The best part was that it was super easy to make - no fuss!  I actually added mini chocolate chips the same time I added the nuts - it was yummy!

I absolutely love this recipe, its always a hit.  Someone left a review saying they didn't care for them.  You have to make sure you spread the mixture over the crackers entirely.  Some of the outer edges MAY be dry if you don't, but they are so good.  I always have to take the recipe with me when I take them to a gathering. :)

I made exactly as the recipe except I used all butter because we don’t keep margarine in the house. I used a large cookie sheet and covered with parchment paper. Used about 1 1/2 sleeves of crackers just as the recipe states. I have made these on numerous occasions and always get asked for the recipe. It’s pecan pie without all the fuss, what could be better

I didn't have pecans so I used about a cup of roasted peanuts that I put thru the blender to make a rough chop.  I also used organic coconut palm sugar (which tastes like a very light brown sugar) and they were great!  Even better a day later.  These are more like a candy and everyone loved them!  Will make again with pecans but I think the family will prefer them with peanuts.  I think I'll go have another one right now!

I love this sweet treat!  I've made it many times and always share with friends.  It's quick and easy.  I didn't change a thing, but you could makes different changes to make this recipe into many different versions!

Very glad I used some vanilla and dusted this with powdered sugar.  I don't think it would have had much taste if I didn't.  Not one of my favorites.  Husband said it was just ok.

Oh Yummy! I admit I didn't follow things exactly because I didn't have everything on the list and I was hot to make it 'right now'.. I Used Ritz crackers cause I had a ton of them, and made a double layer. I also added 2 TBSP vanilla cause I can't get enough of it. I KNOW I used more than the called-for amount of pecans and I even took 3 handfuls off, but it smelled wonderful! When it came out, I let it cool for a minute or three and dusted it with 10X sugar for looks and hello! How EASY is this?! I love it!!

This is a great recipe, but I don't use graham crackers, I use club crackers. It is also good if you stir in a teaspoon of vanilla after the sugar/butter mixer has finished boiling!!!!

I doubled the sugar, and went with 4 sticks of butter, deleting the margarine.  Tastes great!

I used cinnamon grahams (all I had in the pantry) & brown sugar instead of white.  Also added the pecans over the top.  These are absolutely addictive - my grandson loved them.  Next time I will try regular graham crackers.  This is a real crowd pleaser, very easy to prepare & definitely a keeper!!

I did try this and it came out great, took a little get together last night, almost all was eaten, I let the hostess keep the left, I am going to make more,  I have the Nu-Wave cooking system, you control the heat and all, nothing burns on that thing,  this is the easiest recipe for quick treats!!  Loved it, sorry no pics

I've made this recipe twice (at least tried to) and both times it has become a sugary mess

Very good recipe. Love the taste. Should have read reviews before making. Would have been easier getting them out of pan if I had used foil. Maybe taking them out before cooling completely would help too.
