We've made it several times now and its becoming a favorite middle of the week dinner with some fries (and a beer of course) We've tried it with store bought sauage as well and it comes out just fine. Idk why he cuts the dough into 5 segments and then glues them back together. We just cut the doug in half and roll it a bit and it comes out perfect. love this one.

These are wonderful tasty appetizers.  Everyone loves them.  I could not find the puff pastry dough, so I used crescent dough sheets.  They worked fine.  I also used mild Italian sausage instead of the ground pork.  I mixed in some minced onions and bread crumbs.  I did sprinkle with sesame seeds.  I love that touch.  They are a very tasty appetizer that is easy to manage when) you are a party when everyone is grazing. (Standing and balancing their food

Was easy to make however next time I make them I will make the pastry and meat into thirds rather than into 2 rolls as they were pretty large. A smaller bite is better for parties.

These were a great change to my football Sunday chips and dip. They were a huge hit and everyone loved them!

Excellent! It might be idea, to same time is to by your favourite flavoured sausage, take the skin off and roll up into your dough. It's already the right size.

These are great. I watched the video because I have no experience making anything like this.  With no experience they came out great.  I think  pastry dough might come in different size boxes as I seemed to have more dough than I needed but that is better than not enough!  My box weighted 1.1 lbs.

Very tasty!!  I didn't change a thing with the ingredients.  Perfect as is.  The only thing I would do next time (and there will be a next time!!) is to slice the pieces thinner.  It was a bit thick and filling (more than I wanted as an appetizer).  Overall it was a hit at our house.

I really liked these and they are fairly easy to make.  Next time I would put them on a rack that fits inside the cookie sheet to absorb some of the grease given off from the sausage.  It made the bottom a little soggy.

Delicious!  I am making them again right now, cheating with store bought sausage meat as we already have it in the house.  I suspect I'll prefer the from scratch recipe.  The flavor is fantastic!  We're going to try them with honey mustard and with some left over pesto for dipping.

These are fantastic.  I was wondering if anyone has any experience at freezing the prepared rolls for later cooking.

Should I cut them up first and freeze the individual rolls or can I freeze on entire roll and cut it up just prior to baking?

Excellent.  Made mine bigger and used sage breakfast pork sausage then added the ingredients.  Severed them with Coleman's mustard and HP sauce which is traditional.  My family loved them

Omitted onions and garlic because some guests didn't like them.  Added about 1tsp garlic powder instead.  The bottom edge was a little soggy, but not too bad after they cooled some.  Took them to a Christmas "finger food" pot luck.  People seemed to really like them.

This is pretty amazing.  A friend from England mentioned these to me ages ago and when I went looking for recipes this is the one I settled upon.  Delightfully crisp!  Could perhaps use some cheese, but is amazing as is, just dip in a little mustard.
