I enjoyed this soup very much however the broth is VERY spicy. If you do not use the avocado, I highly recommend that you cut back on the chipotle peppers. The avocado mellows the broth out nicely but it still has a great deal of kick to it. The only change I made is that I did not cook the rice first because I wanted it more firm.

I made a big batch for freezing.  Like one of the other reviewers, I also substituted quinoa for white rice, added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and left out the chicken and the cheese.  The avocado was a nice touch.  Next time I might throw in some lemon juice.

After reading the reviews and then rereading the recipe, I thought it might be somewhat bland, but this was a really good soup. I used vegetable broth and left out the chicken and cheese, and I used uncooked quinoa instead of cooked rice, so the soup was a little heartier. Plus, I used fresh oregano (and a little extra to pump up the flavor) and about 1/2 tsp sea salt. By itself, the broth was VERY spicy, but the garbanzos and avocado helped mellow out the heat. For me, it didn't need the cheese--the flavor combo actually tasted a bit cheesy on its own.

Very good recipe.  Nice change of pace.  We added some crushed up tortilla chips at the table that added a nice crunch.  Definately need to have the cheese and avocado with it.  Will make again.

I bought a can of chipotle peppers... then needed to find a recipe to use it!  With all the exciting ingredients I expected more flavor.  The cheese and avocado cubes were fun additions.  We added salt at the table.

This was delicious. If you want to cut the spiciness down cut out the seeds in the chipotle pepper, then add them to individual bowls as desired.

Very good, easy soup. I sauteed some onions and garlic first and added broth and rest of ingredients to pot. It would be great w/some chopped fresh cilantro. Didn't have this time, will next time.

This was a little spicy for several of the people I served it to, but others raved about it.  In the future I will probably try to make it less spicy.

Very good soup.  I omitted the salt because chicken broth has enough salt in it.  I added garlic powder and in addition to the white beans, I added a can of black beans to get more protein.

Didn't have the Monterey Jack, but it was really good with just the avocado!

We liked it, but not as much as Slow Cooker Taco Soup. Here's how I embellished it: 
Added 1/2 of a green pepper and 1/2 an onion (first saut√©ed in olive oil to soften)
Added a can of black beans
Added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes
Reduced to one can of green chilis
Increased the salt from a pinch to a 1/2 teaspoon
Put the rice right in the pot to make easier - reduced amount to 1/2 cup of raw rice, since the recipe called for 1 cup of cooked rice
I topped with 2 avocados instead of 1 and just stirred into pot

I love spicy food and this is now officially my absolute favorite soup ever. If it sounds appealing definitely try it! I followed one other reviewers recommendation and put in uncooked rice so that it wasn't too mushy, but then I also had to add about 2 more cups of broth to compensate. Definitely worth making, so delicious and so easy!

I've been learning to cook the last couple years.
I had the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and needed to find a way to use it.  I found this recipe and made it, not expecting much.  This is only the second soup I've ever made.  WOW! It is so delicious and spicy.  Maybe one of the best soups I've tasted.  Just got back from grocery so I can make some more.  Oh, I didn't know how to make shredded chicken and I used thighs? (dark meat) and cut it in cubes. Later I found out I should have bought breast meat and shredded that.  I'll be making it that way next time.  Plain monteray jack was kind of hard to find, usually they have it mixed with Colby; finally found it though.
