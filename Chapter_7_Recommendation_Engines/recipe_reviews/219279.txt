This cake is awesome! I made this for my dad last year and he was reluctant to share with anyone.  Well he's going to be 70 tomorrow and I am making this cake again since spice cake is his favorite.  We will see if he's going to be a party pooper and not share with all of the people he's invited.

This cake is deee-lish!  I substituted applesauce for the apple butter, because I didn't have any, and it turned out great!
