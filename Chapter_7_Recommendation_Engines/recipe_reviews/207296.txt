Great after dinner drink! I chilled my glass and opted for half and half instead of milk - this classic will never die!

I used to enjoy this drink many years ago when it was called "Kahlua and CREAM," and I  didn't have to be so concerned with calories as I do now. Yep - we drank this using rich, heavy cream!  Nothing can compete with the richness of cream, but this is a fine and acceptable second choice. While not as thick and creamy as the original, this actually is more refreshing.  Brings back memories of my calorie-carefree youth!  For best presentation, fill glass with ice, add Kahlua, and slowly pour in milk for a layered effect.  Serve with a stir stick.

One of my all time favourite drinks! To me it's like dessert in a glass. I would suggest serving it on the rocks and garnishing with a couple maraschino cherries.

This is ALWAYS a hit! Perfect just as written, but for extra richness just sub heavy cream or half and half for the milk. :)

This is so great.  Easy to make, easy to drink, and gets you drunk to boot.  Easy to add a little variety too.  Will be drinking this over and over again.

Just tried this.  It's sooo good.  I used quite a bit of milk, and just a splash of kahlua - but this is a drink i'll be making again.
