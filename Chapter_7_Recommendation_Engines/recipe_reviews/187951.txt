I made this as stated except I used 1tsp powdered ginger for lack of fresh. I took it to a BBQ and it was a hit. I had people asking for the recipe. Definitely is a benefit to make the night before and let the flavors blend. I will make this again!

Tried with apple cider vinegar because we couldn't find rice vinegar. Still excellent! One of the best recipes I've tried in awhile.

Very good! This salsa offers a great combination of flavors and textures, and adds color to any meal.  We had it with broiled Talapia.

I chopped up all the ingredients quite a bit more than the picture suggests but otherwise followed the recipe exactly - it was a hit at my sister's dinner party!  I'll definitely make this again.  The only change I'll make is to make sure to get riper mangoes next time.  The ones I found that day at the store were a bit underripe but still good in the salsa.

This was an amazing recipe..I added the juice of one lime and substituted 1/2a jalopeno as I was out of red pepper flakes! Easy and delicious...I served on grilled halibut, and finished the rest off with chips!

I wasn't sure if I would like the ginger in this recipe; but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor it created when mixed with the mango. I felt like the salsa needed additional texture, so I added 1/2 chopped bell pepper for some crunch.

This Salsa won "BEST IN SHOW" at my work Cinco De Mayo Salsa competition.  It was the only salsa entered that was all eaten.  I served it in a bowl on the middle of a platter with blue corn chips all around the bowl and used Cilanto leaves as garnish at the sides of the salsa.

This was very good.  I didn't have red onion so I used white and didn't have fresh ginger so I subbed 1 tsp of ground.  I think next time I will use green onions due to personal preference.

Delicious!!!  We loved it.  I omitted the pineapple, and used 1 tsp. dried ginger to save a little money.  It comes out very sweet, I think the pineapple would've been to much.  To die for with blue corn chips!  Add a few more red pepper flakes if you like it spicier.

I made this salsa today, and it is amazingly good!  I did reduce the amount of red pepper flakes a bit, but it still has a good bit of kick.  We will definitely be making this again!

Excellent recipe...  Fresh ingredients with great flavors is the key to making this salsa.  It has a good taste when made, but melds into a different level of flavor after a night in the frig.  The bright citric flavors are a good match with grilled chicken, pork, or fish matched up with a semi-dry chardonnay.  Thank you!

What has two thumbs, is on a diet, and is in love with this recipe?  This girl!  I really, really like the ginger in this recipe - very refreshing!  Next time I would like to use a jalapeno, but being fresh out, the red pepper flakes were just what I needed.  I added some bell pepper (orange) that needed to be eaten and a tad of tomato (also in the "about to go bad" category.)  Loved the rice vinegar, also.  This was absolutely DELICIOUS on my baked salmon and I can't wait to eat it again.  And again.  And then probably some more.  It's a perfect summer dish for this girl!

This was really good! We used it on fish tacos (Tammy Hayden's recipe here is excellent) and even my kids loved it, though I divided and made some without the red pepper for them.

My new favorite! I only used red wine vinegar instead of the rice vinegar -- only because I read the recipe wrong :P But I will make this time and time again.  I really loved the red pepper flakes with this! If you have the time, let it sit together in the fridge for at least an hour for the flavors to blend.  A must-try!

I've made this several times already and distributed some to neighbors. My husband looked in vain for the heat ingredient. Boy was he surprised it was freshly grated ginger. Easy to assemble. We enjoy it with tacos and pork chops.

I went easy on the onions and only put in about 1/4 of the read onion. I also used apple cider vinegar becuase I could not find rice vinegar. It still tastes wonderful! My only suggestion is using less Crushed pepper

This was an easy, delicious recipe, but I absolutely hate onions so I substituted a little chopped scallion for the red onion, and added some orange and yellow peppers for color and crunch.  It tasted great!

My kids and I loved my version of this!! I replaced the red pepper flakes with a small amount of fresh habanero peppers. ( we like it spicy!!) and omitted the ginger ( I didn't think it would go well with the peppers). I also used lemon juice instead of vinegar.. Even with all of my customizations, this turned out so colorful and delicious!! Perfect served with coconut shrimp!

Very good and quick. Tasted great using peaches instead of pineapple; don't be afraid to use what you have on hand. Goes great over broiled fish.

I was out of salsa and am making beef fajitas. So found this recipe. I had a couple of very ripe mangoes (the last off our tree) in the fridge. A baby pineapple off a plant in my yard and fresh cilantro growing in a pot. I can’t eat red onions but had vidalias and used that. No fresh ginger either so I used dry. It’s delish!

Wonderful salsa.  I subbed green onion for red (what I had on hand) and it was really great on several things I've used it on this week.  I used it first on turkey burgers, then pulled pork, quesadillas, tortilla chips.  Very versatile.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good good good.    We salsa on fresh halibut.  Delish.  Tomorrow we shall have more salsa on pork chops  . . .  were it not for the onion, we'd have it on ice cream.  Maybe we should anyway!  :)

I made this for a mandatory salsa contest for my Spanish class, and followed the recipe exactly, besides accidentally adding a little more vinegar than called for, and I meant to do the opposite. Sad news, this meant that it tasted strongly of vinegar, but I enjoyed the combination of flavors otherwise. I used a pretty standard, boring white corn chip and it worked well with it.

Quite good. I prefer salsas whose chunkiness is balanced by sufficient liquidiness. That way it doesn't just seem like a salad. I recommend squeezing some of the mangos to add a bit more (good-tasting) juice. I chopped in a jalapeño as well, which seemed to be a good move. Great with simple yellow corn tortilla chips.

Made this to serve with grilled fish and it was terrific.  The fresh ginger is a must - if you are uncertain, mince it VERY fine and you won't be disappointed.  I did use finely minced jalapeno instead of the crushed red pepper and I think that was a good call.  Use as much or as little as you like, but it adds an authetic taste the red pepper won't give you.  This recipe does make a lot, so try a half recipe first if you're on the fence.  Oh, and I used fresh pineapple - canned is fine but the fresh pineapple was amazing!

i made this for the first time and put it over grilled cajun tuna steaks.  it was fabulous.  i used half the ginger because my friend doesn't like ginger and he didn't even taste it!  i could taste it and it added a nice kick.  i only had 5 canned pineapple chunks, which i diced, and it was enough by my taste.  the mango provided enough sweetness.  i put the ginger, red onion and cilantro in a mini food processor which provided the perfect mince.  i probably only used 1/4 t red pepper flakes (i don't measure) and it was plenty spicy.  glad i didn't put a whole teaspoon in.  the final modification was 2 T apple cider vinegar because i didn't have rice vinegar.

Great flavor!  I used the juice of 1 fresh lime instead of the vinegar. I didn't use the pineapple tidbits, didn't need it. Used two very ripe mangos and one that was just a bit firm and tangy. So tasty! I've got a lot of fresh coconut and will probably ad some, but it is great as is.

I'm on the fence with this one... it was very different but not great. The mangos I used were ripe but just barely, and they equaled three cups. Also, I served this with chips, but I believe that this would go better as a side with a fish or pork dish. The chips did absolutely nothing for it. If I try this again as a side with fish or pork, the mangos will be very ripe, and I'll cut this recipe in 1/2.

I've never made any other mango salsa before, but this one was so good! I only rated 4/5 because I think the full 2 tablespoons of ginger would have ruined it. I added about 1 heaping tsp grated fresh ginger, not finely  diced. Ginger can be very overpowering and I don't think I would want to bite into a chunk of it!

This recipe is very addictive.  It is the perfect balance between sweet and hot.  I adjusted the red pepper flakes and the ginger in it.  My husband suggested that I make it more tropical by adding flaked coconut.  I did that and it was out of this world!

I made this to go with some miso salmon, and it was just delicious. Sweetness from the mango, tang from the pineapple...yum! I was too pressed for time to add the ginger, and being sensitive on spicy things I omitted the pepper flakes altogether. But there was still so much flavor, and still a bit of a kick to it to satisfy my sensitive taste buds as well as be mild enough for my 17 month old twins. Hopefully next time I'll manage to actually add the ginger!

This is a delicious refreshing salsa for hot weather!  My husband dislikes red onion, so I left that ingredient out.  I baked it on talipia, and it was a hit!  We ate the leftovers with tortilla chips the next day.
