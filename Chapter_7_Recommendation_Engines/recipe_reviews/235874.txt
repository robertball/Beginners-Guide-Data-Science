This has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup.  As is, it’s just o.k.   To me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce.  It was bland and seemed to be lacking something.   I’m thinking it’s the cooking process.  It seems backwards.  Typically, milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling, especially if simmered for a long period of time.  It works out o.k. for this recipe because it’s so thick from the cheese that you don’t really notice.   What I found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock, absent of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind.  It’s only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender.   Onions, celery, and carrots are essential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor.  I would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more cook time.  The other change I would make is when to add the milk.  I would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk, but that’s just me.

Three stars because it actually tasted good, but the whole cooking process was just strange. In all my years of cooking, I have never seen instructions like that. All you really gotta do is brown your butter, add the other veggies along with the broth, simmer til the vegetables are done. Then add your thickener - in this case, flour and melted butter. Then you add the milk and the cheese. It turned out great this way, and only took me and my daughter about a half hour to make it. Simmering the already thickened broth/milk for 20 minutes? Then adding the vegetables and cooking them for another 20 minutes? Seems to me that the recipe instructions are actually written in reverse!

I made this soup and my husband (who is not a really big soup fan) could not get enough of it.  Only difference I made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream (since I had it on hand), rather than 2 cups 2%.  Also, I didn't have the full amount of cheddar, so I threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference.  But I almost never have velveeta, and would recommend sticking with the cheddar just out of principle's sake.  I used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream (just a preference).  Then I added the milk and cream at the end with the cheese.  It was definitely a delicious and thick soup, just like Panera's.  Yum! Thanks a bunch, gildawen!

I hate to leave a 2-star, unfavorable review.  However, to be fair to those who want to try this in the future, I want to give my opinion: it was bland and utterly tasteless. I was so disappointed that I didn't care how close it was to Panera's recipe -- I just wanted flavor!  I ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base (2 chicken bouillon cubes would work too), and this did the trick! We ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner, and I will make this regularly throughout the winter, WITH my additions. Good luck!

The family loved this soup. The only changes I made was to thin the roux with chicken broth instead of milk and added the broth instead of milk. Then I added all the veggies and simmered it, then added the milk at the end. Wonderful soup!

I've made this soup before using a different recipe, couldn't find the old recipe so I decided to give this a try. I used the exact measurements and ingredients listed except celery, the only other difference I made was instead of simmering the milk/flour/butter to thicken I used chicken broth as the liquid, let it simmer a little (around 7 minutes) added all my veggies and 1/2 cup of water (my burners are too strong and I feared all the liquid evaporating and becoming a pudding instead of a soup) and let it simmer until veggies were tender. Last step I added milk, cheese and served. WOW. BIG HIT with me and my husband who doesn't like soup. The flavor was all there, just be careful with adding salt as most chicken stocks already have sodium and cheese adds a lot.

I'm rating it 3 because I have to rate it. But for a suggestion since I've made the Panera copycat before. First is to blend the ingredients, minus the cheese, in a blender. Second, the secret ingredient is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product. And btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth.

I had been craving broccoli cheddar soup and went with this one since it looked easy and had great reviews. I left out the carrots and salt by choice and added 3 chicken bouillon cubes.  We all enjoyed it very much and I shall make it again.

This was good, but it didn't knock my socks off.  I found I needed to add 2 more cups of chicken stock to cover the veggies (I didn't measure the broccoli), but the texture was still nice and thick once I added the cheese.  It was just blander then I was expecting; I added a tsp or two of garlic salt and a healthy dash of crushed red pepper to add a bit more depth.  I think I agree w/the other reviewer from today who prefers another broccoli cheese soup recipe from this site.  THANKS for the recipe!

*arthur fist* Like many of the other reviewers, I had to tweak the recipe. The instructions didn’t read well to me so I took some suggestions and now I think I have a good system to get things the way I’d like.

 I used 1.5 cups of sharp cheddar, 4 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 cup of thin carrots, 4 table spoons of butter, ¼ cup of flour,  2 cloves minced garlic, ½ onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, 1 tsp of nutmeg 10 oz of broccoli. Steam broccoli until soft and easy to cut (It took forever to get soft simmering with everything else) In another pot sautee onions, carrots (if you don’t have a blender I’d make the pieces even smaller) in butter until tender, then add flour and cook for a minute. Add 2 cups of broth to onions, carrots, and flour mixture. Add in your cup of heavy cream and bring to a boil then lower the temp, remove from heat and add cheese gradually while stirring (if you throw in all the cheese at once it'll get clumpy). Your mixture should be thick at this point, add the last 2 cups of broth to thin it out, and add in your broccoli. Add seasonings to taste. Let simmer for awhile and it should be good to go.

This is almost exactly like Panera's soup!  I loved it!  The only thing that I changed was the chicken stock.  I am a vegetarian so I used faux chicken broth powder made by Frontier which is just like real chicken broth only not as fatty.  Thanks!!  I will be making this for years to come!

The flavor of this soup was good, but the texture was a bit off-putting... If I were to make this again I would add the milk at the end for a smoother broth.  I believe the milk was scorched in the process due to the fact that it was added so early, which made the soup feel a little gritty on the tongue.

This is a wonderful dish.  I especially love Panera's take on it.  I added some nut-meg, two dried tomato slices and a touch of garlic.  I subbed 1/4 cup of milk with butter milk because thats what i had.  I finished by garnishing the plate with green onions and additional salt and pepper.  My taste buds were rejoicing like they were singing in harmony... I almost forgot to mention that i added 1/4 a cup of high quality havardi cheese with my sharp cheddar and when it finished I blended half of the soup in a blender by pulse.  Trust me folks this is to die for.  I deducted one star because I almost feel like these changes should have been in it to start but even without them the soup would be fantastic for a family dinner.  

An Idea:  I Plan to cook a box of cheese and mac then add it to the final soup product then baking it with light cheddar and chips/crackers blend on top of it.  Bake maybe 15-30 mins on 375.

This recipe was delishhh! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because I did modify it a bit. The only veggies I added were a whole onion (recipe calls for a half) and added 2 cups of broccoli. I just do not particularly like carrots or celerey. Also, I only added 2 cups of cheese as that is all I had on hand (note 1 bag of shredded cheese = 2 cups). Overall FANTASTIC recipe! I cannot wait to make it for family and friends now! Leftovers were good too!

I served this soup at a bridal shower luncheon, where it was a big hit.  I doubled the recipe, however the Allrecipes app for iPad only doubled the ingredients list, not the amounts listed in the directions...which caused me to have to make two batches of roux once I realized the error.  I made it pretty much as written.  No additional salt was needed due to the chicken broth (hubby brought broth instead of stock) and the cheddar cheese.  I did purée mine as I saw an opportunity to use my immersion blender. ??I'll make this many times in the future!

This was very disappointing. I made soup for 8 servings but it came out for about 3. Also, it was very thick. That was my first try. My second try came out better dense-wise, but still very little. It ended up I had to make 16 servings for five people. All I have to say is be careful servings wise.

This is good but I had to add cayenne pepper due to the bland taste. Still very good! I also made a nice spread for bread to go with it. Use French bread, 8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup Romano or parm cheese, two garlic cloves. Mix it up and sprinkle fresh rosemary on top and broil for a few minutes. Perfecto!

I used half and half and vegetable stock and omitted the celery.  I didn't understand the part when you just simmer milk and broth with the already-cooked onions so I completely omitted that part.  I also steamed the veggies first so it was done faster and only used half the cheese, which was PLENTY.  I'm a cheddar fiend and I found half the amount to be plenty, probably because the soup was already thicker because of the half and half.  It was amazing though.  A good recipe to start from!

This was a very tasty soup, I doubled it and the pot did not last more than one meal!  I do think the directions are nonsensical.  I sauteed the onion, celery, and carrots in the butter and then added the flour and made a roux.  I  don't know why anyone would saute the onions separately instead of just cooking them in the same pan?  Then I slowly added the broth.  I then added warm milk to the soup and seasoned it.   The chopped up broccoli was added and I also put in 4 slices of American cheese (because I knew I didn't have 4 cups of cheddar).  When the broccoli was tender (which takes longer than 20 minutes) I added only 2 cups of cheddar cheese and that was actually enough to give it a good flavor.   My soup did not separate at all.  I was worried it wouldn't  thicken enough after I added the milk but it did while the broccoli was cooking in it.  My family loves this soup!

Great soup, messed up cooking directions. Instead, start by sautéeing  the onions in 4T  butter. Chop and add the carrots, then celery, then broccoli. Continue to saute for a minute til the vegetables begin to soften. Add the flour and mix. Stir in the broth, hot, and simmer until cooked. Then add the cheese and finally the milk. I put 2 cups in the blender and returned to the pot to make it creamier.

This was very good! I followed the recipe except I didn't have any celery so I used celery salt to season.  The texture was decent, but I think I will try like the others and wait until closer to the end to add the milk.

Awesome Recipe!  I did minor tweaks based upon my pantry contents.  I added more chicken broth, some heavy cream, spicy monterey jack and american cheeses.  I think this would be phenomenal tex-mexed up!  Next time, I'm going to used the same base and add fire roasted corn and red peppers.

We really liked this soup. All the kids actually ate it, which in this house can be a shoot in the dark.  I added sour cream and two different types of cheddar cheese.  The recipe size is accurate. I put it into a 4 quart crockpot and it filed it up.  The ingredients weren't terribly difficult or expensive. It was fairly a simple recipe.

I used this as a foundation to my soup - I doubled the liquid, omitted the fresh onion for onion powder (way more taste) & used 2 cubes of bullion. I shredded the carrots with the larger S-blade on my food processor. I boiled the vegetables lightly in 3 cups of water, then I turned the heat to simmer adding 3 TBS of garlic powder and a pinch nutmeg. I used 3 cups of oat milk (plus 1/4 milk with 1/4 c of flour for thickening). I simmered it for 15 minutes or so. Then I added some shredded vegan cheddar (about 3 cups) and some chilli flakes. It turned out very nicely! Thanks for the recipe.

Thanks for this recipe, I've been making this soup for 30+ years and wanted to try someone else's ideas.  I followed the directions and suggest following the author's advice to change the recipe according to our preferences. The soup is bland and the vegetables are added so late in the recipe that they are underdone and their flavors haven't blended with the soup.  After simmering this for 2 hours, i added some garlic and a dash of cayenne and will let it simmer longer to see how it tastes after the vegetables have released their flavor.  Next time, I'll sautéed the celery and carrots with the onions and steam the broccoli before adding to the soup.

This is my very first review and I'm excited!  I made this recipe tonight and it was absolutely DELISH!   Now the only changes I made was using a can of Campbell's cheddar cheese and a cup of shredded sharp cheddar.  It wasn't intentional,  I grabbed the shredded cheddar from the freezer and noticed there were tiny icicles on the cheese.  I thought it would make my soup less thick if I added the amount  the recipe called for so I opted to use the canned cheddar cheese to make up.  It was still lovely nonetheless.  I also made mine with whole onion and for added flavor and added  and  sprinkled white pepper towards the end of the recipe.

This is the second time I made this soup and I still love it. I used half the amount of carrots since I know panera's doesn't have that much in theirs and it was perfect. I used bullion cubes instead of chicken stock which is the same. I put 3 cubes instead of 2 for a stronger taste since the reviews said it was bland. It was perfect in my opinion.

This was exceptionally good. Thank you for sharing the recipe. I find the complaints odd because this is just a basic roux recipe (butter, flour, milk). Nothing unusual, but a perfect combo of flavors and it nails the Panera recipe. Since I used 1% milk, it was probably a bit healthier too. Delish! The whole family loved it too.

Yummy soup, but when I added the cheese, the soup kind of separated. Not sure why. I will definitely make this soup again, but I will  follow the recipe in reverse, using the broth to simmer with the rue, adding vegetables sooner and milk later. I also added some garlic powder for flavoring.

It was good, but something was off. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added about a cup more broccoli. I will try it again with mild cheddar instead of sharp, maybe that'll take away the weird flavor that it developed.

Great start, but made some changes to the directions:
First, sauté onions in butter.  Then add broth and veggies, and let simmer. Season to taste. Add flour and melted butter and let it thicken a bit.  Then remove from heat and add cheese and milk.
I like to serve with sourdough or a hearty wheat bread.

I've made this a time or 3, & I am one of those who add-to the recipes of others, to bring the dish into line with my personal preferences.  I have done so here as well.  My tip: While whisking/simmering the flour/milk mixture to thicken, add in 3 skin-on red potatoes, diced to 3/4 inch squares.  They will be cooked just right for finishing while the brocolli and carrots become tender, & just before adding the cheese.  The 3 potatoes give an already Great recipe, that extra heartiness you'll appreciate on a cold winter evening...

Cook with love. This soup is delicious, but take your time and put some love into it. You can't throw all the cheese in at once, gradually add and stir while doing it. I also tweaked it by adding a can of cheese soup to make it cheesier. Also shred your cheese don't be lazy and buy the shredded cheese, it is covered with wax. Therefore making it clumpy.. and don't add salt until it's complete.

Made this tonight and it was excellent. I did make a few changes suggested by other reviewers to bump up the flavor a bit (added a couple to shakes of granulated garlic to the onions and a splash of white wine with the chicken stock). Also, though I used the exact amounts of butter and flour for the roux soup base it came out way to thick during the first simmer portion. I added almost another full cup of stock and a splash of heavy cream and that made it perfect. Very minimal changes to the recipe, most to address the consistency of the soup. This one I will make again and again. For our family of three there are NO leftovers!

Based on some of the reviews , I made some changes to this very good basic recipe. I added minced garlic when sauteing the onions and briefly added the carrots and celery. I added the vegetable mix to just the chicken broth along with 2 small bay leaves, and 1/4 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning. I let this simmer for 20  minutes before adding the milk and flour. It was delicious!

I have tried a lot of cheddar broccoli soup recipes.  I think this will be my go-to from now on.  It is so easy and just excellent!  I used all the ingredients as described, but I did change the method.  I had a generous 1 1/2 c of broccoli already partially steamed.  In a large saucier, I added the celery, carrots and onion to 4 T melted butter and cooked the vegetables until limp.  My S&P to taste was 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp coarse black pepper. Stirred in the 1/4 c flour and stirred constantly and let it cook with the vegetables another 3-4 min.   Combined the broth and milk.  Added 1 cup broth/milk, whisking constantly into the flour mixture, and then continued to add the rest of the broth/milk.  At this point, I brought it up to a boil, added the broccoli, and then turned the pot down to simmer and let it cook for about 20 minutes.  I added the cheese, kept the heat on low, and cooked it for another 10 minutes.  It turned out beautifully and got rave reviews from everyone.  I even heard a couple of "better than Panera's" uttered.  (I did make this again, and the 2nd time, I did add 1 generous teaspoon of Better than Bouillon chicken stock paste -- it added a very pleasant richness. Also, broccoli could be added with the cheese towards the end -- just a matter of preference on how soft the broccoli should be).

It's rich and creamy; almost a meal in itself with bread.
I didn't have enough cheddar cheese so I also used monterey jack with jalapeno.

Followed the recipe as written. The soup came out great. You will not be disappointed. The original Panera recipe has a slight spice to it, thinking it might be a touch of nutmeg. I'm going to work on it.

This was really good. I didn’t change anything other than to substitute half and half for some of the milk which made it extra good. I agree with the other reader that the cooking method was a bit cumbersome. I just melted butter, added carrots, onions and celery and sautéed until soft. Then I added the broccoli and sautéed for a few minutes. I added the chicken broth, boiled for two minutes then added the milk and cream and finally the cheese. The whole thing took less than 30 minutes.

Just sitting down to my first bowl of soup. First impressions..pretty tasty!  I agree with other reviewers that took issue with the steps. A soup like this requires the veggies to cook in the broth, then make the roux separately, adding the milk and cheese to the roux and thickening to a smooth consistency before  combining with the broth. I also used my immersion blender in the veggie mixture, reserving about half to one cup of broccoli pieces which I added back to the soup at the very end. (And now I'm just polishing off my SECOND bowl...Mmmm)

Panera's current commercial features their broccoli cheddar soup and emphasizes wholesome, real food, with no artificial ingredients. Specifically aged cheddar cheese. Velveeta is unnecessary and more expensive than real cheese. This is a fine recipe if the Velveeta is subbed for real cheese.

I can't stand Broccoli but my 10yr old daughter loves this soup from Panera.  I made this recipe but added a little garlic powder but kept the rest the same and she loves it.  Thanks for the recipe she couldn't be happier.

Yummmmmmy.  I was sorely craving broccoli  cheddar soup and finally decided to try to make it myself.  I carmelized the onions slightly, used 2x the broccoli and then used an immersion blender to break down about half the broccoli.   I used 1 c Mexican blend cheeses, 1c cheddar and about 1 c jarlsburg cheese...which is what I had on hand.  Also threw in about 3 green onions chopped.  I dare say this surpassed Panera's soup in my mind.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This is very good and almost close to Panera. The method needs some tweaking, as the celery, onions, and carrots should be cooked with the milk/flour mixture to add flavor.  Otherwise if you add the vegetables at the end, there's not enough time to incorporate the flavors.  I even added the broccoli to simmer with the milk to give this a more broccoli flavor.

I followed this as the recipe states except I used half n half instead of milk and added a little garlic powder. After making the rue and waiting for it to thicken, it seemed pretty thin still, but once I added the cheese it thickened up perfectly. My son says it tastes just like Panera! I will certainly make this again! I plan to freeze in individual servings to thaw on demand!

I made this gluten free by doing a 1-1 GF flour substitution and it turned out great! I used 2 cups of broccoli and added a clove of garlic  when I cooked the onions like the suggestions recommended. My family raved about it, definitely will be made again.

I gave the 4 stars because the directions are weird but loved the soup. As others suggested I didn't add the rue/milk until the end and cooked the veggies in the broth first. I reduced the cheese to 1 and 1/2 cups and added garlic. It only took me about 20min to make. This soup was AMAZING, I loved it.

This is the best soup broccoli  soup i’ve Ever tasted!

I like broccoli and cauliflower soup, so I substituted 1/3 of the total broccoli with cauliflower. And I found that I like the flavour that marble cheese gives it.

Also, my sister is gluten intolerant, so I tried a batch with her gluten-free flour and it still tastes amazing! It mixes much smoother than real flour. I was surprised that it worked out so well.

Pretty good basic recipe. I very finely chopped the carrot and celery. I added a clove of garlic and about an 1/8 tsp of ground cayenne pepper, and added two strips of finely chopped bacon to give it some more life. I also scalded instead of simmering because I was afraid of curdling the milk.

First time making this delicious broccoli-cheddar soup. The only alterations from the recipe were: 1) dice the celery & sauté it with the onion. 2) coarsely grate the carrot instead of matchstick cutting. Be sure to constantly stir this to keep the milk from burning on the bottom of the pan. And keep the heat low and slow for the same reason. The seasonings need adjusting for me and I found 1-1/2 teaspoon of salt a good amount. If you have leftover soup, it MUST be reheated veeeerrry slowly, stirring constantly. Otherwise it will break!

I'm really bummed, I followed the instructions and mine came out grainy and has a very bland taste. I wish I knew how to correct this, it looks like it would taste good. Veggies came out perfect. Maybe if I added additionally seasoning I could get past the texture.

This is now my fav Broccoli Cheddar soup. I added garlic and sautéed all the veg except broccoli.  I simmered it in the stock and added some Vegeta and did the thickened milk part separate and then added to the veg and finally added the pepper and cheese. FANTASTIC!!!!!

my family and I loved, loved, loved this. I used chicken broth instead of stock. Added the veggies to the broth and let them cook until soft. Then I added the milk mixture to the soup. It was awesome with a nice crusty french baguette. Will definitely make this again.

I just did this with the stems from broccoli I had left at Christmas I used my food processor and chopped up the carrots and broccoli.  Tasted great.  Increased the milk and butter to 1/2 cup  as I had more veggies that the recipe.

This was good....I found it needed a little zing, so I added 1/4 cup thick sour cream and about 1/8 cup chopped green onion top. I put in 2 cups of cheddar and 1/2 cup of Swiss for the cheese. As my family doesn't  like large chunks of broccoli, I pureed  it slightly. I definitely  will make it again with the above additions.

Amazing!! Just made this about  20 minutes ago. Doubled the recipe bc my husband REALLY LIKES TO EAT. 
Added cream cheese, 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of heavy cream.  Used vegetable stock instead of chicken bc we are vegetarian. THIS SOUP IS DELICIOUS. I will definitely be adding this to my recipe book.

This was delicious! 
I made a couple modifications: 
I sauted the onion, celery and carrots together.
instead of 2 c. of milk I used a 12oz. can of evaporated milk + 4oz. of 2% milk. 
I decreased the cheese to 1-1/2 cups.
Everyone wanted seconds!!

The recipe is easy to follow and it tasted . I've loved the Panera Bread recipe for ages and was glad to find a copycat recipe. It'll be amazing if there are any leftovers of this!

Here are the changes I made, mainly due to what I had on hand.

-1 TBS of Onion Powder substituted for onion
-2 bags of frozen veggies (Broccoli and Broccoli/Cauliflower)
-No carrots on hand
-Added a few pieces of Smoked Gouda cheese for added flavor. Yum! (just less than a 1/4 cup.)
-Blended with a stick blender to cut down the size of the veggies.

Just o.k. At best. Made this adding a bay leaf, a little nutmeg and used extra sharp cheddar cheese. It was pretty bland. Maybe next time I will add some tobacco and/or some Worcestershire sause. It needs some umami.

This recipe is BOMB. I used gluten-free flour instead of wheat flour, and used onion powder in butter with celery before making the rue...it tasted so close to Panera's soup, it's been a long time since I've ate it due to it containing gluten!

The basis of the soup is good. I just made it differently. I cooked the onions and celery together with butter and garlic. Added some smoked paprika and a dash of cayenne. Lots of salt and pepper. Also just let all the veggies simmer in sauce. Without the seasonings it would have been very bland.

Very good. Just like Panera. But the other reviews were correct. I simmered the vegetables in the chicken broth then added the white sauce and milk and simmered an additional 30 minutes then added the cheese.

So I changed it a bit, but it was yummy. 

I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth, and used about 3 cups instead of two. I had the same proportion of vegetables, but I cut out the celery, reduced the carrots, and added a bit more broccoli to make up for it. I also added two cloves of crushed garlic, and black pepper. 

I made the sauce with the broth, not the milk. Didn't let it simmer for 20 minutes, but added the veggies immediately, let that cook till it was all done, about 30 minutes. Then I added two cups of half-and-half instead of milk, let it all heat up, then added freshly grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese. It was delicious. The original would have been delicious, too.

I made this for supper a few nights ago and my family had varying opinions of the soup. My son thought he was in heaven with how cheesy it was. My husband liked it but thought it was too cheesy and I was somewhere in the middle, but I did really like it. If I make it again, I might decrease the cheese somewhat.

Absolutely fantastic soup. I have made it twice in two weeks. First time I used store-bought vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, and also used pre-shredded cheese. Second time I used my home-made veggie stock and noticed no big difference, but I also grated the cheese off a block, and that made a difference in the texture of the soup, especially as it cools off. With the pre-grated cheese, the soup can get a bit grainy and stick to the spoon. With hand-grated, that was not a problem at all. So if you have the time, grate the cheese off of a block. I loved this recipe and will make it often and to serve to guests. Thanks for a great recipe.

I really this recipe. I was actually looking for the Subway recipe for their cheddar broccoli soup and chose this instead.  I made minor modifications by adding garlic and onion powder. It came out great and my family never lets any go to waste.  I truly love this recipe and I share with others.

Liked it well enough.  Not alot of flavor from the veggies, though.  I agree with other reviews that said veggies have to go in early.  If I make it again, I would add the stock first with the veggies too.  Then I'd add the milk and add a little extra.  It ended up a little thick. Also, I think 2 cups of cheese was enough personally.

I've made this a couple times now. It seems like it's best to have it right away because this time, I made it the night before and then kept it warm in a slow cooker for a potluck. It does have a tendency to get or look gritty if it's cooked for too long. I've found that you definitely don't need to cook the roux for as long as they suggest and you definitely don't want to cook it on a high heat. To me, this feels like making sausage gravy, but thinner, and with veggies. 

When I made mine, I added the flour and butter right to the cooked onions, but in the future, I'd just add the butter after the onions were done, and then stir in the flour and cook until it got a bit brown, then add everything else in after that and keep it as low as possible. I've seen people mention nutmeg, and that might be a good inclusion, as well as a bay leaf. It also needs a bit of salt and some pepper. Make sure to taste it as it goes and adjust it. 

I'll make it again, more than likely.

Made slight changes in cooking order and didn’t have broccoli so subbed zucchini and added chicken. I had to add more flour to thicken more. (Do the right way or it’ll clump) Delicious!

This is my new go to Broccoli Cheddar Soup.  I will say I always add garlic and I did kinda change it a little.  I sauted all the veggies, except the broccoli, together in the beginning with the onion.  Also, I used the chicken stock to thin my roux so I wouldn't have to worry about the milk burning. and the milk was one of the last things I added before letting is simmer to combine the flavors.

We chopped all veggies in a mini chopper, it gave us a more blended soup. Added extra garlic and chives. We have made this soup several times and it always comes out perfect.

We used a little less cheddar cheese because my family is dieting, but it was still a pretty great soup.

I will say, this is delicious, but I did follow others advice and change up the cooking instructions a bit as well as a few ingredients because I didn’t have some things. I sautéed the onion (1/2), carrots and celery in 3T butter till soft. Added the broccoli. I had probably 2c and it was really finely chopped. Added 2 lg cubes chicken bouillon and 1 of beef (I ran out of chicken). Added 2c water and 1t garlic powder. Simmered until tender. In another pan I made a roux of 3T butter and 3T flour. Once the veggies were soft, I puréed them a little with the stick blender so they were still chunky, but not whole. I turned up the heat to medium and added the roux, stirring to thicken. Then added the cheese. Then added the milk 1c at a time. Stirring well between each cup. Heated it all through. It was perfect!

This recipe taste great without any modifications. But it doesn’t make eight servings. I did one and a half times the recipe, and it made only six servings and we ate them out of bread bowls, so they were not huge servings. 3 adults, 3 kids and it wasn’t quite enough.

I really liked it, I did however sauté the carrots and celery with the onions for softer veggies for the end result, and I would definitely recommend adding a clove of garlic or two to the veggies as you sauté them, other then that great taste, would probably make it again

I made it exactly according to the recipe except that I used frozen broccoli which I partly thawed and then chopped, and frozen carrots I took out of my mixed vegetables and chopped into small bits. I didn't add any salt or pepper except for the fresh ground pepper at the table. I thought the recipe was unusual because the milk was added at the beginning and simmered instead of at the end of which I'm used to with cream soups. it helped to have a second chef in the kitchen with me today because constant stirring was needed. It was absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I doubled the recipe, added cubed ham and extra broccoli. (One can never have too much broccoli)  I had half n half so I used that but only 3 cups instead of 4. (I doubled the recipe remember) using broth to make up the difference.  I added nutmeg to the half n half, it brings out the flavor.  I only had mild cheddar so I used 4 cups.  It was heavenly.

Delicious and very close to Panera. I like to also add 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and blend about half of it before adding cheese to make it creamier.

I gave the recipe 4 stars because I almost never follow the original recipe, but I use it as my base and it was good. The soup was great and I will definitely be making it again throughout the fall and winter months. The only thing I did differently was I used a combination of half and half and heavy whipped cream instead of milk. I also sautéed minced garlic with the onions (didn’t have celery), and seasoned the soup with ground pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and seasoning salt. I also used a mixture of sharp cheddar, mild cheddar and Colby jack cheese. I kept it simple as far as the order of the recipe. I sautéed the onions and garlic, and then I added 4 cups of chicken broth, carrots, and broccoli to the sautéed veggies. I let that simmer for about 20 minutes, and I mixed in the flour and butter thickener. Lastly I added the half and half and heavy cream, and stirred in the cheese. It was a little too cheesy so i thinned it out with the broth and dairy and it was perfect. I served it with grilled ham and cheese sandwiches and my husband and kids loved it. Definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe as written except I didn’t have celery so no celery. Some other reviewers mentioned the process was odd but I followed it and my family loved it. Very easy and quick. I think the summer time varies depending on how big you leave the broccoli. I cut mine pretty fine so the summer time wasn’t 20 min. We will definitely make this again. Thanks for an awesome soup recipe!

This was a super helpful recipe, but it did fall a bit short on flavor. I combined the steps for thickening the base and cooking the vegetables a bit, but there was still something missing. I saw someone else's review to add some Better Than Bouillon and that made this SOOO much better! My boyfriend finished the pot and was upset there wasn't more! Just make sure you haven't added too much salt before adding bouillon because there's a lot of salt in it.

Great broccoli cheddar soup which can be modified to anyone's taste - more spice ... different cheeses ... adding chicken as some did.   The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was I agree with some that the more logical approach for me was to cook the veggies in the broth and then make the roux (butter, flour, milk) adding the roux to the broth/veggies.  Then add the cheese to melt.  Thanks for sharing!

This is absolutely the Gold Standard of Broccoli Cheese Soup! It is the only one I'll use. However, I did stumble across another recipe that had 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg. I know it sounds weird, but it gives it an extra interesting flavor and I liked it!  Also, I used 2 cups of half-and-half cream instead of milk and it had a great texture. It's a keeper!

It is good but does need something. Second time I made it I added a teaspoon of Thai Red Curry Paste. My kids loved it. Four of us finished off the whole batch, I’ll double it next time.

I increased the broccoli to 2+ cups and increased the cheese to 3+ cups.  Then I added chopped rotisserie chicken that I got from Costco at the very end.  Serve some garlic bread on the side and you have a complete meal.

I agree with several other reviews.  To take this soup to the top level, thin the roux with chicken broth, then add more broth with the veggies.  Simmer this to cook the veggies, then add milk, cream or fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and heat to warm.  Serve in a sour dough bread bowl!

This soup is amazing!! We made it tonight and made a double batch and the whole family LOVED it every one said it was way better than Panera’s! It’s super easy to make the hardest part is doing a rue which is really not bad at all, it’s pretty quick too within an hour we were eating and it has the best taste. So full of flavor and super savory and delicious! I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking to recreate Panera’s broccoli and cheddar soup at home!! We added just a little bit of paprika and red pepper flakes along with the salt and pepper and it was utter perfection.

When I began making this I thought it didn't look like it was going to make much soup and once throwing it all together as shown it tastes pretty bland. That being said I used an additional cup or so of broccoli, an additional cup of chicken broth, an additional cup of shredded cheese and approximately 8 oz of sour cream. It turned out pretty good and enough to feed 2 adults, 2 teenagers and have a couple bowls for leftovers.

Fabulous flavor!  I used half and half instead of milk and only needed 1/8 cup flour to thicken it.  I seasoned it with black pepper and garlic salt and only used half of the recommended cheese. Perfect!

It's easy to make and delicious. I may make a slight change next time but I didn't change anything this time and it's still yummy. I've never been to the place it's copied from so I don't know how close I am to the original but who cares.

Made recipe as written.  My only complaint is that it tasted a little grainy.  Maybe I should’ve cooked the flour/butter mix a little longer?  Definitely worth trying again.

I made this recipe because I couldn’t find the one I normally make. It turned out pretty good. I don’t measure so not sure if that could be the reason. I put garlic in with my onions when I cooked them down, used the powder chicken stock and mixed it with 2 cups of water ( I always make my chicken stock with more powder than it calls for) and I also added sausage balls that I cooked in the oven.

I used 1/2 & 1/2, thought it would be creamier. It turned out delicious. Will definitely make again.

This soup was really just OKAY. I was really hoping for it to taste awesome, but it was very bland and tasteless. We added garlic powder and seasoned salt and it still just was not right.
I think the main part of it was the consistency of the soup base. It was not as smooth as I would have liked, it was more chunky, but not necessarily in a bad way. I would not make again, but maybe

I feel that this is a good soup but needs more flavor like maybe a super sharp cheese and cook everything in one pot instead of separate.  Cream soups need a touch of nutmeg to bring out all the flavors.  This is just my opinion

This was a good base for the soup.  I added garlic powder- next time I’ll add fresh garlic to the onion as I make the sauce.   The spicier folks in the house added chipotle flakes and lived it.

The receipe lacks seasonings. It's a delicious soup after I added garlic powder, nutmeg, salt and black pepper. Also I added 1/4 more broth to it to thin it out a little because it was too thick. I really does taste like Paneras version but also with those few more ingredients.

Delicious 
I was starving so I skipped the celery.  After sautéing the onions I added the broccoli, carrots, and even some cauliflower. I mixed water and milk. I shook cold milk, flour and white wine in a small container and poured it into the soup. To avoid cleaning a messy pot, I served the soup, then I added the cheese on top. Delicious!

I made this. I followed it exactly as written only to have wasted my time, money, and ingredients. It does not taste like Panera’s soup! Trying to eat this would be like trying to eat a condiment by itself.  It tasted very weird!

The best laid plans.  (when you meal prep veggie trays with broccoli,  carrots and celery but don't get around to eating them before they start to dry up).

I stumbled upon this recipe in the ingredients search, and holy geez.  I was able to use up my dry ended veggie trays,  some bone broth from the freezer,  and that last bit of heavy cream. Gluten free cup for cup blend instead of traditional flour. I finished the soup with extra sharp cheddar,  gruyere and the last bit of a parmigiano-reggiano wedge, tossing in the rind instead of adding salt. 

This soup is perfect.  I've never experienced the Panera version,  but if it's half what this one is,  I understand why they have such a fandom. 

The fact the soup isn't blended makes it,  tbqh. Tender crisp chunks of fresh veggies in cheesy saucy glaze is unimaginably good.  Holy grail comfort food.

I give this 4 stars because of the way it was made. It tastes wonderful. In one pot I added the chicken broth, carrots, celery, and broccoli. In a saucepan I added 1/4 c. butter and the chopped onion. When the onion was soft I added the flour and cooked it until it started to turn a nice golden color. I added the milk to this and stirred constantly to make a nice sauce and let that boil gently for about one or two minutes. By this time the veggies in the broth were tender. I added the white sauce to the broth, stirred well, took the pot off the burner and added the cheese. I let the cheese sit awhile to melt, then gently stirred it. The result was a very flavorful, smooth, thick soup. I used grated sharp cheddar cheese, but added a handful more of it because I wanted my soup to be just a little thicker.

Our nearest Panera is over an hour away, so this recipe is definitely a new favorite in the house. Paired with a piece of French bread or Everything Italian slices, it's perfect. I followed some advice on the recipe and used stock/flour first, then added milk. I also simmered the veggies the entire time. Love it! Highly recommend it. I will be using this over and over I guarantee.

I love making different broccoli cheddar soups, this one following directions to a T is to bland for my liking. I did find a solution to this adding whatever spices I want too, remember when creating recipes especially for yourself not everyone is going to have the same taste level. 
I for one seasoned while everything was simmering. Salt,pepper,garlic, and chili flakes for a little something extra. I used store bough shredded. Key to this is letting it get room temp because if not it will curdle. 

Other then that it was great.

It didnt taste very much like the original, and the cheese made the whole meal have a grainy texture, to the point where you could see specks the size of a grain of sand all over the spoon. Completely ruined it for me, couldnt finish it.

I have made this recipe so many times and it never fails! The texture the way the veggies are cut and cooked is my favorite way to eat broccoli cheese soup!  I usually turn the heat to low or even just turn it off when i add the cheese. I find too high of heat will make the cheese turn into a funky texture.

I made this recipe and it was so easy.  I made a couple of adjustments since the first time I made it we thought it was too salty.  My adjustments were:

1) used 33% reduced sodium chicken broth
2) used 3 cups of non-fat milk
3) used 2 stocks of celery
4) used 3 cups of cheddar cheese
5) all other measurements as per recipe

Delicious! Definitely need to double the liquids because it was more veggie than soup. I will be adding some minced garlic to add more flavor next time. Overall very delicious.

It's really good! I wish it didn't have so much cheese ... But I guess that's why it's delicious.

Didn't make any changes, but will experiment with the recipe the next time. It seemed to need a milder cheddar cheese for us.

So are so good but I added a little bit of paprika and instead of making things more harder use one of the choppers to chopped down the vegetables more instead of putting cooked food in a blender same result just faster.

Delicious! I melted all the butter, sautéed the onion, then added the flour. (I’m impatient.) Also I added the carrots with the chicken broth because carrots take longer to cook than broccoli and I didn’t want mushy broccoli.

Reversed the steps of adding milk and broth and added the veggies to simmering broth, before adding the milk. Excellent flavor and texture.

I sautéed the celery with the onion and also added about 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic.    I think I added a little too much cheese.  This was fantastic and I will definitely make it again!

Yum yum!!! Spot on. My directions were quicker. I sautéed the onions/pinch of salt then added the veggies-topped another 3-4 tbs of butter & a pinch or 2 of salt.  TIP: I shredded the carrot with cheese grater. My kids not a carrot fan so they have to be super thin. Worked great & way quicker to prep!  Poured in broth & made a thickenr of the melted butter & flour in the microwave heated butter first then added flour & whisked until creamy. Added to soup to simmer then added milk & shredded cheese. Pepper to taste. Omg its JUST like Panera!!  Family approved.

I have eaten this item at Panera, Atlanta Bread Company and McAllister's several times in the bread bowl. Was great. Then I saw this recipe and made it. Gotta say, there's no difference in the taste or texture, it is just awesome! The only difference is, you don't pay every time you crave this, you can now make it easily and cheaply yourself, with enough leftover for a few days. BTW, even if left in the fridge for a few days, you can zap it a few minutes in the microwave and it's just as good! Thank you so much for hacking into the recipe lol ?? and sharing!

OMG. This was so delicious! I used frozen broccoli because my local Aldi doesn't stock raw broccoli and it still worked perfectly. All I advise when using frozen broccoli is to heat it in the microwave for about half of the time it takes to cook it, and then add it with rest of the veggies.

Love this soup I made it as written                                          *** A note to other cooks... I used cheddar cheese that I bought in the bag already shredded Unbeknownst to me during processing after the cheese is shredded corn starch is added so it won’t stick together This type of cheese really tightened up the soup 
When I reheated I had to add more milk

This soup is absolutely mouth watering and addictive. I made it just for me and my sister and brother in law ate it all before I got another bowl. It was very thick so I added a cream of mushroom soup and a can of milk and one half stick of butter and let it simmer another 20minutes. Absolutely wonderful

Although I basically followed this recipe, I made some adjustments, as suggested by some of the other reviewers, for instance, I used a mixture of whole milk and cream, and I added some garlic and nutmeg. I also altered the cooking process. I sautéed the onion, celery and garlic in the entire amount of butter required. When the onion was transparent, I sprinkled the flour on top and continued cooking while stirring until the flour was cooked but not browned. I then added the chicken carrots and broccoli,brought to a boil before adding milk and simmering until done, then stirred in the cheese. The results were wonderful!

I made this last evening for dinner.  I had been wanting some of Panera's Broccoli Cheddar Soup, found this recipe here and made it.  It wasn't hard to make, kinda tedious to cut up the onion and separate and cut up the florets but it was well worth it-and simple to make to boot.  I shredded the carrots instead of making matchsticks.  It came together really well.  Sauteed the onion, celery and garlic in butter, removed when soft, added flour  and mixed with water to thicken added the reserved veggies simmered about 25 min.  I thought it needed thickening and added flour mixture and a little salt and pepper - it was done and.  Everyone loved it and finished off the last little bit this morning!

I added extra flour on accident and it turned out thinker, but the flavor is fantastic.

I like this but it was a little bland to me. I added an additional cup of chicken broth and 2 cup of heavy cream Alton with parsley.

Turned out well! Nice taste! We added more broccoli than usual. We also made it gluten free using America’s Test Kitchen flour in place of regular flour and it turned out fine; not grainy like we were worried. My partner who wanted Panera’s broccoli cheddar soup said it didn’t taste exactly like it but was not worse or better. That is a high review from her.

I would suggest two things. If you are watching your saturated fat intake, watch the soup as it's 
 simmering and add MORE broth to prevent over-thickening of the  base.  And, just FLOAT some of the cheese on each serving. 
I added extra florets, a smidge of garlic paste, and a pinch of nutmeg. My husband thought he'd gone to heaven!  Great recipe. I just did minor tweaking!

I really liked this recipe, after I made a few changes. I sauteed my onions with a cup of mushrooms , and I cooked my veg in the chicken stock. I added a bouillon cube to the broth. I made the roux and added the milk to that, then the cheese after the milk mixture thickened. I added that to the stock and veg and stirred it in. Excellent flavour, will definitely make it again.

I made this today.   It's great.  Of course I always add my own twist to any recipe.  While the onion was sauteing in the pan I added shredded carrots and chopped celery.   I also added salt and pepper, and garlic with parsley.  I added 4 cups of broth to the onion, carrots and celery.  I added a couple pkgs of cut broccoli and cooked it until broccoli was tender.  I made a rue with flour and water.  I used a whisk to make sure to get all the lumps out.  you want to make it thicker then normal because you are going to thin it out some with the cream.  I added half and half and milk and 16oz of cheddar cheese and stirred it well.  
Cooking is not really a stick by a recipe thing.  I get the basics from the recipe and take it from there by adding things to make it more flavorful

It was ok, I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but I’ve always had an issue adding cheddar cheese to sauces. It ends up with an awfully grainy texture and I never seem to get a smooth cheese sauce this way.

It  is delicious and tastes very much like Panera's. My daughter is gluten sensitive, so I made it with Namaste Gluten Free Flour Blend, that works wonderfully. It's so nice for her to get to enjoy this soup, since the Panera version is off limits for her now!

I made this soup for my husband and I while I was having a weird pregnancy craving..while I agree the method is a little silly, it worked and the soup turned out just fine! I do want to say it definitely needs more seasoning than just plain old salt/pepper, but anyone who’s ever cooked anything knows to taste first then season accordingly to your taste preference. So people need not complain in the comments on flavor, you had the ability to liven it up! I added onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and a tiny pinch of curry. It was delicious!

I didn't follow the directions, other than to saute the onion. I followed another persons suggestion. I sauteed the onion, tossed in the celery for a few minutes then added the broth. I then added the carrots and and broccoli and simmered until the veggies were cooked, then I added the melted butter. I slowly added in the flour and stirred as I did so. I added the milk, brought it to a light simmer then added the cheese. I did add a dash of nutmeg, some garlic powder, salt and pepper. Turned out pretty good! We had some left over bacon from this weekend so I made sure to crumble a little on the top with a little extra cheese!

This came out very similar to something you'd buy from Panera. I did make some alterations: most notably I doubled up most items, and added 3 diced red potatoes so I'd get a week of lunches out of it. I also added a bottle of hefeweizen beer to the sauteed veggies because I love that flavor in this soup.

Timing recommendations: it took my roux/milk/stock mixture about 50 minutes to thicken, so I would recommend starting that process as step 1 before sauteeing any veggies. I spent a lot of time waiting around the broth and stirring.

Sauteeing recommendations: I like to get my onions a little caramelly, then add the other veggies into the skillet to punch up their flavor. Once the veggies were co-mingled I poured in a bottle of Weinstephaner beer and cooked off the alcohol. This whole mixture went into the broth once the broth was thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. 
Beer + Cheese = Amazing.

Made this recipe for my sweetie. We both liked it, was pretty good. However ingredients were missing. For a more "Copycat recipe" Dijon mustard,Cayenne Pepper Sauce like Sriracha or Red Hot and Paprika. Of course this is just my opinion I do really like this soup.

My 1st attempt making broccoli cheese soup & it turned out wonderful! Please note, this recipe didn't yield many servings so if you're feeding a family be sure to adjust ingredient amounts for the correct number of servings.

I used 1% milk and more broccoli than called for.  I had medium cheddar so I used that and it turned out really good. I will make this again. Serve it with crusty french bread or bread bowl.

I made this for my parents and they loved it.  I used a little more onion than called for.  The only thing that I will do the next time I make it is to use more broccoli.

Hands down the BEST broccoli cheddar soup. My family raved about it and when our co workers smelled the left overs we had at lunch it was the talk of the room. I highly highly recommend this soup. Plus it's super easy to make and I almost always have all the ingredients on hand.

I've been looking for a good broccoli cheddar soup that tastes similar to Panera's version. That is my favorite soup from Panera and I always order it whenever I go.  I had tried to make broccoli cheddar soup many years ago and it tasted horrible and I vowed I'll never make this soup again.  So when I cam across this recipe I thought I would give it a try.  Boy was I surprised! It was delicious and it came very close to tasting like Panera's broccoli cheddar soup.  I ate two bowls of it - it was that delicious!  I made it exactly like the recipe except omitted the celery- not a big celery fan and used mild cheddar cheese since I didnt have sharp cheddar.  It will be a perfect Lenten meal during Lent this year!!!

Probably won’t make again as it’s too far off point. Not bad, just doesn’t taste enough like Panera soup.

Great recipe. My family gobbled this all up! I didn't have any celery on hand, so left it out and it came out just fine. I also use vegetable broth in place of chicken broth to make it vegetarian.  I will definitely be using this recipe from now on. Thanks.

This was fabulous! Everyone absolutely loved it. I thought ahead and made a little bit extra for hearty appetites. I had cream on hand so we enjoyed a bit of a richer taste but I will use the 2% milk in the future to cut the calories from today’s overindulgence. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

This soup is very similar to Panera Bread's so if you don't like Panera's, this won't be for you.  I personally do so I loved this soup. I did find the cooking process odd so I shortened it up. I didn't set the onions aside as I am from Louisiana and often make roux with my onions in it so I was pretty confident it would work out fine. Also, I added my veggies in with my milk and stock. I did make it the way it is written the first time and I'm pleased to tell you my shortened version came out just the same and was still delicious. Thanks for the great recipe. :)

I made a few changes which made it better in my opinion. I added cayenne pepper for some spice, salt and black pepper to taste. After mixing in the broth and continuing to whisk well I added onion and carrots. Close to the end I added broccoli and cooked for 10 minutes longer. I throw cheddar on top of the bowl of soups so that way it be freshly mixed in. It's delicious recipe to start! Thank you.

Extremely good.  We did 3 cups of cheese and used fattier milk.  Salting to taste at the end is important.  I may double the recipe next time for a bigger yield.  Thank you for posting this!

Very easy to make and delicious.  I added extra veggies and cheese and used milk and half & half instead of just milk.  Doubled the onions and browned them just a little.  I've never made broccoli cheddar soup before.  This is a quick, easy and delicious recipe.  I hope it freezes well.

Very, very good!  Delicious!  Just what I was looking for.  I followed it exactly, other than like others, using broth in the first step with the flour/butter.  I used sharp cheddar, so so good!  Husband just yelled from kitchen  "That was FAN-TASTIC!"  :)

I used veggie broth, a whole onion, more broccoli, and added a can of coconut milk after the veggies were half done. It was awesome! maybe next time a pinch of cayenne. It was a big hit!!

I simmered the chicken stock with vegetables, then added it to the roux. Finally, slowly, adding the cheese.  It was great!

Good base recipe. I suggest adding bullion cubes or better than bullion and some garlic. 

I doubled the celery and carrot too. 

Overall, nice flavor and texture.

I LOVE Panera's broccoli cheddar soup; I order it every time I go, winter or summer, so I was hoping to find this to be fairly similar. I think it was, after modifications. I agree with other reviewers that the vegetables should be cooked longer in the broth before preparing the roux and adding the milk. So, I sauteed the onion and some chopped garlic, and then added the broth and cooked the broccoli (cut small) and carrots. I skipped the celery this time. After the vegetables were pretty tender, I made the roux in a small separate saucepan and added it and then the milk. For spices (what really makes the flavor, I think), I added salt and pepper, then some nutmeg, mustard powder, and Worcestershire sauce, to taste. It turned out to be very rich and flavorful, and I will try this again. :)

I made a roux with the 4 tsp. butter and 1/4 cup flour then added the milk and later the cheese.  After prepping the veggies in advance I sauteed the onions in 1 tsp. butter then added the chicken stock.  When the veggies were cooked I added the roux to the hot soup and it was delicious!  That's the southern way!

My boyfriend had requested broccoli cheddar soup and I found this recipe. I didn't add the onion because I'm allergic, and used parsley for an extra touch. I also added chicken to this. It was delicious, and we'll be having it again for sure.

It was really good. I've been looking for a hearty broccoli and cheese soup, and this is it. I used vegetarian broth instead of chicken broth and shredded the carrots and celery. Mmm, mmm, good.

this was AWESOME; suggestions: I made 4 servings for 2 people (we love soup) and had about a serving and a half left over, so if you're hungry I would double the recipe and be ready to have a little leftover. Additionally, I skipped the onion and added salt, onion & garlic powder and that was less chunky and just as flavorful. Put more salt than you think you need. Additionally, start your vegetables a little sooner as they take a while to get as mushy as I personally enjoy them in soup. Awesome recipe! Thank you so much & I served with cape cod chips for my final enjoyment! :)

This turned out pretty well.  I liked the overall taste and texture. I liked the chunky feel of the veggies because I left them firm combined with the creamy base.  I rated 4 because I could have followed the recipe more closely but I made it thicker to my liking. I may come back and make it a 5 because it was good. I also added more butter to enhance the feel.

I loved the flavor of this soup and it was everything I expected except it just didn't thicken as much as I would have liked it too.  In the future I would recommend when u sauté the onions to do so with a light coating of cooking spray and not so much butter.  The soup was thickening until I put the onions in and then it seemed to thin back out and never thickened back up.  Other than that it was the most flavorful cheddar broccoli soup I have ever made..I served it with warm slices of fresh baguette and it was a hit!! Thanx for the recipe!!

Probably shouldn’t have used shredded cheddar cheese.  It seemed oily and separated in the soup.  Fairly bland, too.  Next time I’d use a higher quality cheese and add more spices.

This was really delicious and easy to make. I even made some for my neighbor. I would have given it give stars but there is no way this recipe will make seven servings. There were three of us and it was hardly enough.

This soup it's better then the Panera one. I follow almost all the instructions except that I shredded the carrots and cube the celery, also  I used 32oz of chicken broth. I  seasoned with a lot of black pepper and it was so good. we didn't have leftovers ( hubby & I finished it at once)

Love this soup. I have made multiple times and will make minor revisions (more broth than milk, no celery in house) and it is still great.

As is it is a great base, as stated. We are trying to stay away from sodium so small changes were made but still with great taste and a couple of potatoes for some extra depth on the soup.

Delicious soup! Taking others’ advice, I sautéed the onion and celery (I didn’t have any carrots or I would’ve sautéed them, too), added the broccoli (I used a bag of frozen and chopped it in my processor) and chicken broth, cooked for 20 mins, then added the milk and flour, brought to a boil, and added the cheese. Great recipe! The only downfall was that I didn’t have any leftovers because everyone loved it and had seconds!

I used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of 2, just to make the batch bigger. I also shredded my carrots and added cumin at the end. This was an excellent recipe and fairly easy to make!

Yes I will make it again, but I will make the roux in a smaller pot, or use less flour--bit of a flour taste.

Like some of the other reviewers I used stock with the roux then added the milk. It made a great soup that did not even need the cheese. I added garlic, fresh ground pepper and a bay leaf.

I almost never leave reviews, because so many other people will, but had to write because this recipe is DELICIOUS. I used whole milk because that's what we had, measured generously with the veggies, and was delightfully surprised by just how tasty this was. Thanks!

It came out right the only thing it was a little salty from the broth. Next time I will use no salt broth. Other than that it was on point.

I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of sour cream. Made the rue with the chicken broth and added the milk and sour cream after to avoid burning the milk. Made it for the people at work and all loved it served in bread bowls.

It was fantastic the only thing I did different was add some potatoes -carrots and sweet potatoes separated add the chicken stock and blended with my handheld blender then  continue the recipe as instructed in turned out great ---obviously i never tell my kids about the vegetables on the soup if they don't know can't hurt them ---easy pizi --they have been  eating a lot of vegetables  since they were babies in this way ...

The soup was very good.  I had to use gluten free flour which changed the texture a little, but it worked fine.  I'd add more cheddar next time to give a stronger flavor.

Yes, this is an excellent recipe.  Needs a few instruction tweaks for folks who aren't experienced home cooks.  I would advise that you saute the onions and carrot strips/shreds  together in the saute/skillet pan so that the carrots are tenderized.  In addition, separately cook the broccoli first in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes or till just barely tender and then blanch the florets in a big bowl of cold ice water so that you stop the cooking and retain their bright green color.  Be sure to drain the broccoli before adding to the soup later.  I don't start my roux (butter/flour/liquid) until after my veggies are cooked and set aside to add later.   Also, the size of the soup pot (saucepan) itself should be at least a 2 qt. size to contain the completed recipe.   Take your time and take care with your roux not to cook it over more than medium or medium low heat.  The initial butter/flour mixture should be thick, but creamy, not pasty.  You can add tiny bit of butter at the beginning if necessary.  Just be sure to stir, stir, stir, this butter/flour mixture over the heat for at least 4-5 minutes before adding hot (not cold) milk.  As soon as you add the milk, the roux will get very clumpy and thick......Don't worry.  That is supposed to happen.  Just keep stirring and adding in the milk a little at a time till the whole mixture getting very creamy.  Keep cooking for about 10-15 minutes more so the flour taste is gone.  THen feel free to add all the chicken or veggie brot

What a disappointment!  I will learn now to read reviews before trying any recipe. Of course the directions were backward, I’m ashamed I did not realize it. My second mistake was being so excited I DOUBLED the recipe. Veggies did not cook well, flavors did not meld and the milk and flour kept humming up in bottom of pot. So,  all that anticipation and waste of ingredients wasted!  The best I can say is it was bland, bland.

So I sautéed the onions in the butter till they were translucent with some colored onions. Then I added the stock and let that simmer for 5 minutes. Then I threw in the broccoli and the carrots and let that simmer for 20 minutes.  Then I stirred the melted butter with the flour until smooth and thick (about 8min).  Then I slowly added the milk to the flour mixture and continued whisking until all the milk was added and it was a thick consistency. Then I poured the thick milk flour mixture into the stock and vegetable mixture.  Then I stirred in the cheese until melted and added salt and pepper.  ALL DONE!!

I’ve never made broccoli cheddar soup before and this was super simple and delicious! I had to make a few adjustments because I didn’t have some of the ingredients, but every substitute worked out perfectly! I even added some diced potatoes for a more hearty soup!

I added extra cheese and broccoli and also added my favorite winter flavor enhancer - shallots. Great soup, made a double batch so that we could have leftovers!

Turned out great!  The only ingredient that I added to the recipe was celery salt.  I find this always brings out the flavour of broccoli soup.

I have made cream of broccoli soup before and it seemed kind of blah. 
I made this delicious soup as the recipe instructed.... only added a half cup heavy cream with milk,... everyone gave great compliments! It will definitely be my “go to” soup often.

I would add more seasoning but I do appreciate you sharing your recipe. If this is Panera's soup I definitely wouldn't be buying it at their restaurant because for what it is I could make a better one at home. As I said, more spices and other seasonings are needed plus I wonder if you could make this with cornstarch to make it gluten free. I love the broccoli cheese soup at Pizza Ranch

Tastes just like Panera’s at a fraction of the price! The broccoli turned out perfectly cooked and not gross and gray. I used extra sharp cheddar and it was fantastic. Thus soup is definitely worth the time it takes to make it, even though you need to be watching it and stirring pretty much the whole time.

This is a fabulous soup for the taste buds.  I use better than broth for the chicken broth and it just gives it a little something extra.  Can't go wrong here.

You can also use unsweetened coconut milk if you have a problem with regular milk. I haven't tried it with that A2 milk or a Lactaid brand but you can also subsitute those too. You want the soup to be creamy. There's also arrowroot flour that can be used in place of flour. You will have to add as needed not using the guide measurements to achieve the same results but just as tasty.

It was my first time making this soup. It's very easy and extremely delicious! Panera's soup is a cheap Chinese knockoff compare to a masterpiece I have made:-) some modifications included: 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of heavy cream, added shredded chicken breast (leftover from last night's dinner), and 1/4 teaspoon of  paprika for the kick (with 2 teaspoons  of salt and some pepper)... Next time I'm making it, I might put a little less cheese... but overall 5 stars from me & my 7 year old critic.

Deeee-lectable! Pretty easy to make especially with pre-chopped vegetables and shredded cheese. It tasted like Panera even before adding the cheese, so you may be able to go with a smaller amount.

OK. So I made this. I would say the only draw back was the time it took. I would also add that it did need more milk to not be really thick.

Very good flavor I made it in the insta pot for 30min on the soup setting.... I added  cheese after  it was done cooking  due to the possibility of it burning on the bottom of the pan

Our absolute favorite soup! This recipe is great just as submitted. But with a few tweaks, even better.
One whole onion, chopped. Half & half for at least 1/2 of the milk portion.  4 to 8 ounces of Velvetta. And 1/8 to 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg gives this soup that secret ingredient.

Tastes just like the real thing! This was a delicious soup! I am not a huge fan of added butter, so I skipped the roux and halved the flour and it still turned out great! (I mixed a cup of the soup in my immersion blender to make up for the lost thickness) really delicious soup. Amazing recipe! Thanks for sharing!

It’s very tasty. I used gluten free flour and skim lactose free milk and reduced the cheese to 2 cups. Also, just before adding the cheese I used my immersion blender to make it smoother.

Made this today. For some reason my cheddar cheese didn't want to melt. Only thing I changed was adding a chicken breast. The cheese clumped up to the chicken. Otherwise it was good and I'd even eat it without the cheese. Will make again.

I've made broccoli cheddar soup many times before. I decided to use this recipe because my younger son loves Panera. I wish I'd not followed the recipe to the T (okay, I didn't... after tasting it I added onion powder, celery salt, worcestershire  sauce and garlic powder). This soup tastes nothing like Panera's. I wish I'd sauteed ALL of the veggies.  In the future I will add fresh minced garlic, smoked paprika and maybe a dash of ground mustard.

I actually screwed up the recipe out of my own lack of shopping before making it. I didn’t have chicken stock so I used the Lipton chicken soup  stock and took out as many of the noodles as I could. But the recipe for the Lipton asked for double the amount of this recipe so I had to double this recipe. It ended up turning out fine. A lot of people said it was bland and the recipe was backwards which through cooking school it is backwards but my error made it taste excellent. Making it again tonight and I have the proper ingredients now so I hope it’s still as tasty as it was before!

I followed the recipe to a T (minus the celery) and the flavors were good but the consistency was really thick, equivalent to a dip.

I know a lot of people reviewing this said it was too bland, ect. The basic recipe is pretty good. If you want more flavor I added garlic powdered and cut up some already good left over bacon and that really made the flavor pop.

If you line more flavor in you food, you will definitely have to make some changes, I followed most of the recipe but added potatoes and extra everything... it’s a good base though. We really enjoyed this soup ??

This soup was amazing! Halfway through making it I realized that this recipe would not be enough for 3 people so I doubled the recipe. I also added some cream to the soup and when it was finished cooking, I added a little extra milk because it was a bit too creamy and thick. It tasted even better than Panera’s soup. It was so fresh and filling. My family absolutely loved it and told me they want me to make this again. The soup was very filling. I served it in normal sized bowls and we couldn’t even finish half of it. I recommend serving it in small bowls.

A friend of mine has brought this to my house before and it’s one of my favorite cold weather soups. I used an emersion blender right before adding the cheese to blend about 1/2 of the vegetables.
Delicious

What the recipe leaves out is seasoning at each step. Some people were saying their soup was bland. I found I needed to add salt when cooking the onions, and again during the simmering. The recipe also left out a key ingredient of nutmeg. I realized too late that I had none so I substituted with cinnamon. I used half and half instead of milk to achieve a richer soup. It turned out delicious. I doubled the recipe because I had a surplus of broccoli on hand (still have a lot left over!). I plan on freezing this soup so I'll have some all winter. Yum!

Great recipe for sick days!! Recipe was fantastic and very good. The only change I made was I added a bit of velveeta cheese to give it more flavor instead of stirring in the cheese

Excellent!  Made for first time today and both hubby and I loved it!  Only complaint I have is that it doesn't state if it's 1/4 cup butter before melting or after, so wound up using too much.  Apart from that, turned out great for first try.  Oh, and prep time is time consuming, but so worth it!  Already planning on when we should make it again.

This soup tasted good. I'm a fan of clear soup and usually not into creamy soups, but making it at home feels a bit different. I followed others and use stock to add to my roux and milk at the end. All was well until I added cheese which caused the whole pot to become grainy. Did online search and found out that the soup temperature was too high. I'll try again next time.

I followed the recipe except making roux. I added 1/2 cup sour cream instead and added cheese last. Not as thick but very rich in taste. I also added bacon flavored Spam. Will definitely make again!

I don’t frequent Panera, so I don’t know how it compares, but it was very good! I ALWAYS mess with recipes so I used half fat free milk and half light cream, used more veggies, added 2 cloves crushed garlic and some cooked chicken I had in the fridge. Awesome flavor and consistently.

Great soup recipe! Super simple, and easy to customize. If people are finding the flavor lacking, cook your onions with some minced garlic, cook in the salt thoroughly while the soup simmers, add onion powder, nutmeg, or paprika to give it a little kick. Experiment with it! This is a great jumping off point!

Yumm!!  We loved this recipe!  We made it as directed, only making two small changes...we added 3 carrot sticks, chopped and we used cashew milk instead of dairy milk as that's what we drink.  I also blended it all in the blender before adding the cheese.  IMO what really made this soup is using a good quality cheddar cheese as that's where the flavor shines.  We used kerrygold aged cheddar and I think this gave it such a great flavor!  Our entire family (even our picky young ones) loved it!

I added grated parmesan cheese (the real stuff) just  before serving.  The addition of celery and carrots make it more flavourful.  Will definitely make again.

This was quite tasty. Like other cooks, I had never put the milk in first. It came out just fine, but had to keep it on low and keep stirring it to keep it from burning or sticking to the bottom of the pot. As some people thought it was a bit bland, I added a bit of garlic, a potato cut very small and some thyme and a few other tiny bits of savory spices. My husband is not a big cheese fan, so I only put in about 1/4 of the amount of cheese.

A good base recipe. I agree with the other reviews re: cooking process. In addition, I had half of a Costco rotisserie chicken (no legs) so I boiled the whole thing with half an onion, 2 carrots and a celery stalk. Strained it into another container. Used that as my chicken stock. Then I shredded the remaining chicken meat and added it to the broccoli soup, In addition I also added corn, half of a diced russet potato and a good couple dashes of Nutmeg and one can of cream of mushroom soup.

This soup is really great. The method is easy and the result was very good. Next time I make it I would cut back on the grated cheddar cheese as the quantity in the recipe made it too salty and cheesy. I added no salt, only pepper.  Next time I will increase the quantity of broccoli.  These are minor adjustments to an otherwise great recipe.

Turned out great. I omitted onion and carrots by choice and it was still amazing. I did add 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese as well

Cooking method worked out perfectly for me.  The only changes I made were that I used vegetable broth for my vegetarian daughter to be able to enjoy and I'm not sure it was needed was to add 2 oz of processed cheese.  It was very creamy and delicious but I will probably try just cheddar next time before added anything more....definitely will be making again.

I added a lot more broccoli and about 2 1/2C’s more chicken broth. Once the soup simmered and ready to eat I used my bullet and creamed about 2 cups of the soup which I  found thickened the soup up....

I give it a 4 because my family liked it. I thought it was OKAY for the amount of effort it took. I took others advice and made the roux with the broth instead of milk. So maybe it was my own fault it was so-so. I won’t make again unless my family really wants me to.

I suggest adding garlic when you are sautéing the onions. I cook the broccoli, carrots, and celery in the chicken broth for 10minutes. For a little extra taste I love adding jalapeños.

I've made this recipe countless times. The family loves it. My only comments would be to cook this slowly and before adding the milk and stock/broth, heat them (not to boiling). If you cook it too fast or add cold milk/stock, the soup is prone to getting chunky.

I used 3/4 of a bag of the frozen chopped broccoli and because I’m a rebel, I sautéed all the veggies in a stick of butter.  Once they were done the way I wanted them, I threw 6 tbls of flour in.  This caused the veggies to clump up a little and sautéed a min or so longer.   I mixed both the broth and milk together and added it in.   Everything thickened up fairly quickly with no flour clumps.  I added sharp cheddar, let it melt.   My family couldn’t gobble it up fast enough

Very tasty! I steamed broccoli, carrots, and celery for 10 minutes while making roux (from just butter, flour and then adding only stock).  Cooked for 5 minutes and then I added cheese slowly in portions to melt thoroughly and added spices. I added 2 Tbs of bullion,  a few grinds of pepper, and a couple dashes of cayenne pepper for a little zip. Then I finished off by adding the milk (I never use anything else - just me) and cooking on med-low while stirring often for a few minutes. Added in veggies and let simmer on low for another 15 minutes.

Soup turned out amazing! The recipe was a little small for my family of 5, but I made some adjustments and I'm real sure it was far better than Panera broccoli cheese soup...

I thought it sounded like too much butter and cheese.  I added a potato (cut into very small cubes and added when I added broth).   I  used 1 Tbsp butter and sautéed the celery, onion and carrots, and added garlic powder.  I felt I needed to add a little more butter to that; but not much.   I went to store to buy stuff (including milk) returned home with no milk. (I know)  so I added 1/4 cup or little less of half n half, and large heaping tablespoon of sour cream just before adding cheese (which was 4 ounces grated medium cheddar.  (no flour, I felt the potato would help thicken the soup).  I added no salt or pepper until the soup was in my bowl.   I suggest trying and tweaking the recipe for your taste buds.  Mine made four bowls of soup.    (it could have used 2-4 oz more of cheese but I was trying to keep calories down.   ENJOY

I've made this soup a couple times now...each time I've added 1 more cup of chicken stock...and I find that all that cheddar takes away from the soup...so I use about half the cheese and it's amazing....no leftovers! I melt all the butter called for in a pot...then sauteed onions and carrots...then added flour and cooked for 4-5 minutes before adding milk and broth. After it comes to a boil I add broccoli and simmer

I really wanted to like this copycat. The way the recipe follows, the soup is too thin; even with cheese. I also had to simmer my veggies for 40 minutes as they were not tender at 20. I used extra sharp cheddar for more flavor. I shredded my own cheese (pre shredded cheese is coated in cornstarch, so it will CURDLE or not melt properly!). I also added a teaspoon of garlic salt. It does not taste exactly like Panera's, but my boyfriend did enjoy it. Next time I will blanch all the vegetables in butter, then like others have said, make a roux only using chicken stock and flour; then add the milk and cheese at the end...

I will be making this again ....and again!  Made just a couple of minor changes.  Had broccoli stems left over.  Cut them in small pieces and simmered to soften in the chicken stock before adding to the soup.  Used a combination of processed and shredded cheeses in lieu of sharp.   Just using up a couple of leftovers.

I mostly followed the recipe, don't like onions or celery so I did not use them, instead I used onion and garlic powder. I steamed the broccoli florets ahead and set aside, while I made the soup base, butter and flour first then chicken stock, I also added 2 chicken bouillon cubes then 2/3 cup half & half and 2% milk for 1 cup total, added the cheese, used 2 cups pre-shredded cheddar cheese added the cooked broccoli and the matchstick carrots and simmered for about 25 minutes. Overall it was very tasty!

This was my first time making broccoli cheddar soup and it honestly couldn't have been better. I was surprised how fast it came together too! Added a lot of fresh ground pepper, sea salt and garlic. 10/10

Doubled. The prep time is killer,  but using regular instead of baby carrots would have helped. Added 3 cloves crushed garlic to onion. Used large soup pot. Better directions :
(1) Melt 1 tbsp butter in soup pot over medium high heat. Saute onion and garlic, stirring, until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and melt remaining four tablespoons of butter. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, 3 minutes.
(2) Gradually add chicken broth, whisking constantly, then whisk in milk. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, 20 minutes. Add broccoli, carrot, and celery and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
(3) Reduce heat to low, then stir in cheese and cook, stirring, until melted, about 1 minute. Let everyone add their own S&P.

I used extra cheese and extra broccoli. DH wanted to eat it all, E not excited.  Grenier adults liked.

My family lost their minds over this recipe. One caution: this does not make 8 servings. Maybe 3 1/2 good sized bowls. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked the vegetables during the "thickening" process to deepen the flavour. Also, suggest using stock first, then the milk, as per usual soup making methods.

Really loved the flavor of this soup. Followed the ingredient list exactly but instead of adding the milk first, I added the broth, mixed it together and then added the milk.  Don't know if it was that misstep that didn't allow the fats to join together properly for thickening but after stirring for the 20 minutes stated, it never thickened like it should have so I mixed an extra tablespoon of flour and butter (a beurre manie) and tossed it in the soup...that added just the right amount of thickening.  Then I added the vegies (which were raw according to the recipe except for the onions), and cooked for the stated time.  They were still very crunchy when I would have preferred just a bit more cooked (although NOT mushy).  I will make this again but will add the carrots, broccoli and celery to the onions after onions have started to soften a bit before adding to the  soup.  Would have given it 5 stars except for a bit on the thin side and vegies not cooked enough for soup.

Sautéed veggies except broccoli in 1 T butter, added broth and cooked on low 1 hr. Pureed  1/2  broccoli  with can evaporated milk, added all but few tablespoons to soup pot. Balance I used to mix with 2T cornstarch. Added that to pot and cooked for 15 minutes. Added cheese and cooked low until melted. Season and yum. Will keep this recipe.

Made this last night for dinner and it was spectacular.  Didn't really change anything except to throw in a dash or two more of salt and pepper!   My only criticism would be that it separated when I re-heated it for lunch and took on a grainy texture.  It was still great soup, just took on a different feel when I ate it, hence the rating.  My whole family loved it when we had it for dinner and my son said "mom, this is definitely a keeper".  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought it was a really good recipe and made it as listed.  I'm not sure on the serving size of 8.  I didn't think it yielded as much and should maybe be like 5 servings.  Will definitely double the recipe next time.

A great recipe, will definitely make again! The only change I made was to add half a cube of bouillon instead of salt, which made it a bit more savoury IMO.

We used frozen broccoli florets, and baby carrots, as well as matchstick carrots. There were no cheese measurements, so we added 1 cup to the soup, and sprinkle some on top when done. Ours was better than Panera Bread’s. We also added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, a pinch of salt & pepper.

The ingredient list on Panera Bread's website does not include celery, so I left that out.  While this doesn't taste the same, it's pretty good.

The soup is good, but I feel it could be better. It was kinda dull  and a little bland. Next time, I would add garlic and spices.  I think I would also add some bacon. Just ok, but needs improvement.

It came out VERY well. My husband liked it a lot so that’s really saying something. When I cook, I like to really make it worth my while. I doubled the batch and after having some for lunch, only ended up with four 1 pint containers full. Next time, I’m going to quadruple the amount and make it worth my while. It was THAT good !

I made this for dinner tonight and didn’t taste any of it until it was completely done. I went exactly step by step in order changing nothing! It was so amazing and so easy to make. I have never had Panera broccoli cheddar soup but it is my moms favorite! And if it is anything like this it is now my new favorite! I am passing this around to all my friends and family! This was definitely a hit in my house!

It is visually beautiful...but bland on taste. Add your seasonings to your likening and it is fine. I would make again with personal adjustments.

It was very good. Not quite as thick as I was hoping though. The quality of chicken broth makes a huge difference.  I will make it again and thicken it a little more next time. Doubling the recipe is the perfect amount for having enough leftover to freeze.

This was a great recipe! I love Panera's soup and was craving it and this was pretty darn close. I followed the recipe exactly. The vegetables were a little firm, but I liked them that way, it gave the soup texture. If you want them super soft, I'd cook them longer before adding the cheese. The only other thing I'd do differently is maybe to add less cheese first and then try it out. It was just borderline too much cheese. I used whole milk because that's what I had at home. Between the cheese and whole milk, it was pretty rich, which could be good or not, depending on your preference. I liked it, but couldn't eat too much at once. Overall, DELICIOUS!

I thought that the cooking instructions were a bit odd but I followed them just to see how it would turn out. it was quite good the only change I made was to use velveta instead of cheddar simply because I was out of cheddar and have continued to use velveta because I liked it that way

Perfect soup on a very cold and snowy day!  I followed the directions with the addition of some garlic powder and a healthy dash of cayenne black pepper. I did feel the soup needed a little more seasoning.  I used lactose free whole milk and Cabot lactose free cheese that I shredded.  I served it with some homemade crusty bread and a leafy, green salad. I will be making this again and it is easy enough to make after a long day at work.

This was an excellent broccoli cheddar soup recipe. I added one russet potato, cut up and cubed to give it extra thickness. It will definitely be added to our soup rotation.

I made the recipe as listed and didn't have any trouble with the milk curdling, which I was concerned about. However, I do have 2 criticisms - first, that the veggies need far longer than 20 minutes at a simmer to cook through (the broccoli and carrots still tasted almost raw after 20 minutes), and second, that it is WAY too much cheese. 

I made it a second time with a few tweaks, and was much more to my taste. I threw in some minced garlic with the onions, I added salt and pepper in with the milk at the beginning rather than the end, I let it simmer with the veggies for close to an hour, and I cut the cheese in half. It came out the perfect consistency with good flavor.

Everyone is so eager to eat it, I never have time to

instead of milk.
Great recipe!!

Super easy to make!! I followed another user’s suggestion and sautéed the vegetables, then added my broth. Simmered for about 10 minutes, added the butter & flour roux to thicken, then finished by adding half-and-half and cheese. My daughter loves it!

Amazing recipe; it has made its way into our regular meal rotation (all 4 kids and husband get excited about it).   Good for a comfort food type meal on a cold day, and delicious enough to wow company!

I cook the onions in the full amount of butter, then add the flour directly to that.  As recommended by others, I add the veggies and chicken stock and let simmer till tender, then add milk last, with the cheese.

We use whatever cheese we have on hand (herb & garlic or old cheddar, mozza, parmesan, provolone, etc).

I add a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a bit of mustard powder along with seasoning salt and pepper.

I ended up doubling the recipe mid-way, because I wanted lots of leftovers. Because other reviewers had mentioned it could be bland, I added one packet of beef bullion seasoning, and went heavy on salt/pepper, to my taste.  I also used half and half.  I also didn't follow the time of simmering; I simmered for probably 15 minutes before adding in the veggies and another 10 before adding in the cheese. It turned out great, tastes so similar to the Bread Co (Panera) recipe!

This was excellent!! Changes I made: used 2 cups broccoli, about 4 cups chicken broth, 2 red potatoes finely diced, seasoned with a little garlic powder, a pinch of nutmeg, salt and black pepper. I pulsed in blender about 1/3 of the soup before adding cheese. I used about 1.5 cups of cheese, half white half yellow both sharp cheddar.  I did not use celery.

I really, really love this soup.  I make a few changes to it and with those changes it is 100% a 5-star recipe.  I saute the onion, then add the extra butter and flour directly to it.  Pour in the chicken stock (we use vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian), then add veggies at the same time.  Simmer 20 min. Add milk, warm through then add cheese.  At the very end i put in a dash of garlic powder (probably 1/4 tsp - 1/2 tsp) and a big dollop of sour cream (probably about 2 tbsp, maybe even 1/4 cup).  Then serve in a bread bowl.  Also I often leave out the celery since I rarely have any on hand.  Simply delicious!

This is an excellent recipe. I didn’t have any celery when I made this, but I honestly didn’t miss it because I’m not really a fan anyway. The key to really putting this recipe over the top though is adding a pinch of nutmeg. It really makes everything else pop. I’ve seen that in other broccoli cheese soup recipes. I also add a little garlic or garlic powder. I’d give this recipe a 5 star, but I just feel it needs a little jazzing up. That being said, it’s a great “base.” Would definitely recommend it! Just add your own little twist!

Love it! I melted 3-4 Tbs. Of butter and let the carrots and onions (out of celery ) cook in that (covered) for 5 minutes. Added 1/4 c. Of flour to make the roux, then added the broth and simmered for a minute. I used cooked broccoli and added that, followed by milk and cheese last. Salt and pepper to taste.  Came together in no time. Fast, easy, delicious.

I was craving soup on a cold,  windy, rainy day so I found this recipe and had everything on hand to make it. WOW! This is a keeper. The only change I made was to do one cup of milk and one cup of half and half, but really, it would be just as good with all milk! I only had medium cheddar cheese.  I really feel like this soup is better than soups I have had in restaurants. LOVE it!

I substituted red for white onions and added green onions with the cheese. The broccoli wasn't covered, so I added cream and more chicken stock. The soup was delicious and I will definitely make it again!

Followed directions and all was well until adding the cheddar cheese and BAM! the cheese separates and I have a pot of uneatable garbage. Time and money lost. Will use velveeta next time.

I kept all the ingredients the same, just rearranged the cooking order. I sauteed the onions, carrots, and celery in the butter till tender. Stir in the flour and cook for a few minutes. Whisk in the milk and bring to a simmer whisking constantly. Whisk in the chicken broth. Add the broccoli. Salt and Pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook until the broccoli is tender but still firm. Not mushy. Whisk occasionally. About 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add the cheese. I like to add a few slices of processed cheese torn up. Stir till the cheese is melted. Time to eat!

I wouldn't make this again. The vegetables need to be cooked beforehand. Made it as directed and it's been an hour cooking and they're still not soft.

This was just what I was looking for.  I made it pretty much as written but I did add some garlic to the onion.  I'll keep this because we really like broccoli cheese - like Panara "used" to make - I think it's changed from the original and this tastes more like the original.  Anyway,  thanks for sharing this really good recipe!

I am a big fan of Panera's broccoli cheese soup. This tastes just like Panera's. Recipe is easy  to make and I would make it again.  I've been a cook for many years and tried several recipes. This is great.

We love this recipe, but I made a few small changes. I used 1 whole onion, carrots, and celery and food processed them for my toddlers who would pull their nose up to chunks of veggies. The total was about 4 cups. I sautéed this in the butter until soft. I followed the directions until adding the broccoli - I used closer to two cups of broccoli cut into small pieces for my littles. I cooked them just till they were cooked to my liking which was less than 20 minutes, more like 10. I shredded my cheese and did two PACKED cups so it was probably more cheese than what the recipe called for technically. The flavor was amazing and it was super cheesy. A family Favorite.

Great soup, tastes just like Panera's! I was out of carrots so I used extra celery. I did not add salt at the end, just pepper. Everything else stayed the same. It's a little involved for me, but I would make again. Thanks for sharing!

I like this recipe, but  I think it is too grainy and not as  thick as I would expect it to be. I came in to see if this recipe could entice me to try Panera's soup plus it seemed to me that probably the recipe was unjustly reviewed. I think you can tweak it a bit to make it thicker with the aid of half and half and maybe the best cheddar cheese you can afford. Whole milk alone will not be enough to get that bit of a hearty heavy texture. I will follow Christina's suggestion which seems very spot on! I will report on it! I made Easy Cheese and Garlic Scones from this website to accompany this recipe and OMG it is very, very good! UPDATE: I forgot to mention in my review that you can add a bit of green onions for flavor. I made this soup today following Christina's suggestion of using milk and cream which in my case was 1/2 & 1/2 and it was a success! As she mentions stick to cheddar cheese. The soup will be of the right texture (not grainy at all) and just adjust the salt to your taste and if you wish add pepper. If for some reason you don't have celery, a pinch of celery seed will work. This was YUMMY all it needed was that little extra grease that the cream or the half and half provide to it! Whole Milk alone won't do it.

My husband loves this type of soup, unfortunately when made exactly as the recipe says it's mediocre at best. He had one bowl and we ended up throwing the rest out cuz it just tasted so blah. If you try this recipe, be sure to see what others may have changed to make it better... because it will definitely need it!

Great flavors but like other suggested, the steps are out of order; add broth to the roux, then add carrots, celery and broccoli. Simmer that until tender then finish with cheese and milk. My daughter swears it tastes just like Panera's soup.

I didn't have celery so I added more carrots and broccoli. I also lacked the right amount of cheese and so I substituted about 6 oz salsa con queso and it turned out phenomenal.

Haven't eaten Panera's version so can't compare to that. I made this in the early afternoon and when my wife called mid afternoon about her disastrous day I said dinner was ready. She came home and ate and raved about how good the soup was all evening long.  Followed the recipe so I could judge it and not some altered version. Says salt and pepper to taste and no salt was added as the cheddar cheese supplied enough. Now I know I have a great base and can tweak for different tastes.

Loved it.  Made it with all broccoli stems since we had used the crown for salad.  Pureed it in the Vitamix.  Flavor was great.
Did add a touch of Tabasco, a whiff of nutmeg and a bit of lemon juice which I add to all cream soups.

The recipe itself works just fine. But what is missing, which I have seen in other copycat recipes, is a tablespoon of nutmeg. For some reason it just has the flavor to make it perfect. I also add about a tablespoon of minced garlic and a few slices of Swiss to suit my pallet. Adjust to your flavors. But this is a great base to have for broccoli cheddar soup.  Also try in a crock pot. Just let it sit. Or minus the chicken broth and add to a cooked box of elbow pasta for a great mac n cheese meal topped with bread crumbs and put in oven for about 20 minutes on 350 after combining all ingredients.

I made this soup for lunch today.  My husband loved it and so did I.  I made it with 1% milk because that's what we buy.  The flour and cheese made it plenty thick.  I will make it again...for sure!

This recipe is better than Panera's , I loved it. I added some cauliflower because I had it. I changed the way I made, I blanched the vegetable except the onion. I put all the butter in a pan  sauteed the onion until tender . Then I mix in all the flour and cooked until blond. I slowly stirred in the milk then added the chicken stock. I cooked it until it was thick. I added the cheese and let it melt, then I put the blanched vegetable in. I let it warm thru and had a bowl of the best broccoli cheese soup I have ever had. I look forward to making it again. I hope you try the way I made it, it made a thigh rich soup. SO SO GOOD!!!

I liked the soup a lot. I did omit the onion (allergies) but followed the rest quite on. I took your suggestion and used half and half and I really liked it. It was a hit.

This was delicious with a few changes I made.  First, I cooked the onion and carrot together.  Then I cooked the flour and butter, added the stock and milk, brought to a simmer until thickened.  I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tsp of chicken buillon and 1 tsp garlic powder.  It was fantastic and only took about 30 minutes to make.  Yum!

This recipe came out perfect, my boyfriend requested broccoli and cheddar soup and I came across this recipe. We both love it, although, he ate almost all of the pot to himself.

Delicious. Yes, I changed the order of how I cooked things (cooked down onions, added the rest of the veg & cook 15 mins, add butter & flour, cook, add broth). After letting it cook for another 15 mins I added the milk, and when hot, the cheese. The only different ingredient I added was 2 cloves of fresh sliced garlic with the veg. Seasoned with salt and pepper.  I think it really does capture the Panera flavour and texture.

I added more broccoli and made extra cream sauce.  I grabbed a bowl, before I remembered to add the cheddar cheese and it was so delicious! Next time I make it I will not add the cheddar cheese, but will have it available on the side. It was great both ways. I also used heavy cream and that made it extra delicious. More calories of course. I saw a couple of reviews saying their soup turned out bland. I wondered if they just needed to adjust the salt & pepper.  I had never made a cream soup before so I followed the cooking instructions to the letter.

This recipe was robust, flavorful and texturaly pleasing.  One criticism is that in the written directions nowhere does it say to layer in seasonings (which is probably why many have said it tasted bland).  The onions should be lightly salted when cooked, and salt and pepper should be added (to taste) after the cheese is added.

I cooked the carrots and celery with the onion thus reducing the cooking time.  I also added fresh mushrooms to the onion mix the last few minutes.   Use extra sharp cheddar to boost the flavor.

Very delicious, served with toasted rye bread sticks for dipping!  The only change I made to make it healthier (without sacrificing flavor) is NOT to make the roux in the pan before adding milk.  You get the same thick results by whisking flour directly into the milk and skipping the 1/4 cup of butter altogether.  I do this every time I make béchamel or any white sauce.

Doubled the broccoli used veggie broth rather than chicken broth and added minced garlic to the onions, a chopped jalapeno and frozen chopped kale at the end. (Green onions would have been great but I was out). YUMMY - Thanks for the recipe!

I used frozen broccoli and fat free milk. I also added fresh minced jalapeno and it just took it over the top.   Loved  this recipe! Had no idea this was so easy to make.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

It was just okay for me.  It seemed to be missing something. Maybe I was just disappointed that it didn't taste like Panera.

According to my husband, mine was better than Panera's!  I followed the recipe but I always add a bit more cheese and a bit more broccoli, etc... I must say it was very, very tasty and will be something I make often!

It had a chunky texture, that I assume was because of the shredded cheese. Tasty though! Next time I make this I will add rice to cover this.

I loved it! I adore Panera's soup, but I live up in Canada so I can only have it a couple times a year. This tastes exactly like Panera's; I'll definitely be making this again!

Made it with ingredients and quantities the recipe called for just a different method- one I'm more used to. The flavor was great ( ok I might have used a little more cheese) and served in homemade bread bowls - yum!

I thought the recipe was confusing - I sauteed the onions, then added one can of broccoli cheddar canned soup and 1 can of chicken stock,  and a handful of shredded cheddar cheese. Then I added broccoli, carrots , and seasonings and simmered for awhile.  Then I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese.  If it needed to be thicker I used instant mashed potato flakes a little at a time.  It was really good.  And most importantly, easy.

This has been the most delicious broccoli soup I have ever made! Easy! The only change I made was adding a potato cut in cubs and added a bit of extra milk to make it more soupy. The way I like it. But nothing else. Great flavor! Great texture I loved it!

I am used to adding the milk towards the end and that's what I did. I cooked the flour until golden brown and then I slowly added the chicken broth. Covered and cooked for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then I added the veggies and seasoned with salt, pepper and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Cooked for another 20 minutes and added 1/2 cups heavy cream, 1/2 cup regular milk and 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar. I then used an immersion blender and made more of a cream soup.  The family loved it.

Next time I will blend everything in the vitamix, return to the stove, then add the broccoli. This will make it more closely resembling the Panera version. Otherwise, that is the only thing I would change.

Awesome flavor! I added half and half instead of milk. Turned out great, except kind of curdled because maybe the milk had been simmering for so long? Next time, I'll cook the butter and onions until translucent, add the broth and remaining vegetables, cook about 20 minutes till done, then add the thickener (flour and butter/milk mixture), then the remaining milk and cheese. That should do it.

Good soup!  I made it with a couple changes: I added a bit more carrots and broccoli.   I chopped some of the broccoli very very finely and some slightly bigger.  I used MATURE white cheddar (sharp).  I added 1 minced clove of garlic with the sautéing onions.  And I made the chicken broth extra strong.  Tasty result :)  Perfect with some crusty rolls or baguette for dipping.

This is a really good recipe. If  you are lacking some flavor,just add some more chicken cubes. Tastes just like Panera. Just add many cubes as it takes.  It is a lot easier to use a food proseser to chop the carrots.  I made this recipe and I have to quadtriplet it for my family(eleven kids)

I have had this made for me many times and it is awesome!  Tried it myself twice - once i burned it so watch the heat and stir often.  Second time it was delicious!  Very easy to make  and a crowd pleaser.    Also - your choice in cheese is important.  Buy a good sharp cheddar- preferably fresh grated.  I could eat this every day. :-)

I made this great soup for a family dinner.  I added chopped chicken breast and chipotle seasoning to add smoke and heat.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly; it was such a great soup.  It tasted so delicious, I made more just for me.

My family absolutely LOVES this recipe!!! Personally, I am not much of a soup eater. I found this recipe here and my Mom decided to make a large batch with a friend - thank goodness they made the size they did!!! The entire batch was nearly COMPLETELY GONE by the end of the night, as after the main meal my parents and I kept going back to it for snacks!! The last bowl was used up the next morning for brunch! Haha! It was actually THAT good!!!

I decided to give the Paneras Broccolli Cheddar soup a try on a freezing cold winters evening while out with my mom, since I LOVED this so much! I actually HATED it!! This recipe takes their soup to an entirely new level, and quite honestly I think Paneras should start using this instead!!! My family was almost addicted to it, it was SO GOOD!!!!!

It does take some time to make, and can be messy, but it is WELL WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!! It holds up well in the fridge also, and an extra large batch (doubling the recipe several times) holds up for about a week... not that it typically lasts that long with everyone eating it 2 meals a day and sometimes snacks in between!!!

Whether you like soup, or are like me and typically can't stand even the thought of it, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!!! YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! It is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!!!! 

Thank you so much for this recipe!!! It definitely hits the spot on cold winter days, and every other day during the year as well! Haha!!

Great recipe! You should substitute one cup of milk for some table cream to give it a proper texture. It's quite delicious and hearty. Definitely simple and worth a try.

I added about a 1/4 cup of half and half. This is the best soup outside of panera.

I mixed with the stock first and vegetables and then added the milk and finally the cheese last. I added onion powered, minced dried onions and it came out great! Definitely recommend adding more spices and salt so that it has flavor.  Will make again. :)

This is a great receipe and it had lots of flavour.  I used extra strong cheddar though and added a little worchershire sauce.

Beautiful soup.  With a few changes.

1T. Sugar only
Mix roux with chicken broth not milk
Add milk at the end
I made the cheese soup alone and boiled the veggies separately then put the veggies with the cheese soup.

Fantastic! I used the ingredients but didn't follow the instructions, as a few others suggested. Also replaced butter with olive oil. 

Sautéed onions, celery, and carrots first, added flour, added water and brought to boil, added chicken cubes and broccoli, in the very end turned off the stove and added a bit of heavy cream and the cheese.

I agree with the other reviews. It turned out ok but was missing something. Adding onions, celery, and carrots to stock to simmer and adding thickener, milk, cheese, and broccoli last may help.

I love this soup.  I would add a little bit of cream vs milk to make it richer.  More calories though!  Another tip...if your making it as a main course cut the servings in half.  This recipe for 8 servings is enough for 4 people to have it as a main course.

Perfect broccoli cheddar recipe! Delicious and I can never get enough of it. Some advice: if you think you've added enough cheese, you have not. Definitely add more cheddar than you think you need

I have made this soup numerous times and always get great compliments from my family and friends as to how delicious
it is.  I do cook the vegetables in the chicken stock for 20 minutes and then make my roux with flour, butter, milk then add the cheese and then add it to the vegetables.  It turns out perfect every single time.  Thank you for this recipie! It is the best!!!

ive made this twice, i love cheddar broccoli soup, but every time ive followed the recipe exactly and every time it comes out super thick like a paste. its still nice but so thick its hard to eat a full bowl, the taste is delicious but the texture makes it hard to swallow i don't know what i'm doing wrong but its definitely way to thick, shame.

4 stars because although it was AMAZING I did change a few things. First I sautéed the carrots and onions in butter until soft, skipped the flour added the broth and milk,  let it come to and boil then stirred in the broccoli, 2 cans of Campbells cheese soup and one can of cream of celery, a handful of shredded cheese, garlic powder celery-salt some oregano.  It turned out PERFECT.  Thick creamy flavorful. 100% make again.

Turned out great! Thought that the flour/broth/butter mixture was too thin so I added more flour... don't do this! It turns out suuuuuper thick in the end due to the cheese. But it tasted so good!

This was so so SO good! I followed the exact recipe except I added an extra cup and a half of Broccli. Just because I'm a huge broccli lover! So flavorful and full of my favorite veggies. I couldn't believe how much flavor the soup had from such simple ingredients. Would deffintaly recommend. Taste the exact same as Panera. Oh, also after I added my cheese I let simmer for about 30 minutes. Deffintaly gave the veggies time to soak up all that flavor! ??

I made this today.  As several reviewers noted, the instructions seem to be out of order.  I've never simmered a thickened milk base for 20 minutes.  However, as I wanted to rate this I ALWAYS make a new recipe just as the author writes it.  Next time I would cut the carrots into smaller pieces.  I would chop the celery a bit smaller.  I would use a combination of cheeses.  This was close to Panera Broccoli Cheddar soup but not spot on.  Something is missing. Thanks for the recipe gildawen.

I know it's not suppose to be exactly like Panera, it's a copy cat recipe, but it wasn't nearly as close to Panera. I followed the recipe exactly as it says. I'm rating it a 3 because maybe I didn't add enough salt and pepper for taste. The soup looks GREAT!! But the taste is a little bland. I couldn't really eat the soup by itself because of the blandness, so I just ate it with homemade paninis. Other people have done this recipe exactly like it states and they have loved it. So again, I'm rating a 3 because it might be that I didn't add enough salt and pepper (how much more does it need though??? The cheese is already packed with salt and so is the stock.)

I love this recipe! This is my third time making it and this time I played around with it a little. I used half and half instead of milk and chicken broth instead of stock because that's what I had on hand. I also added chicken breast...delicious! This recipe is a spot on copycat recipe. My family says it's better than Panera!

I ate the whole pot of soup myself in 2 days. Creamy smooth and satisfying. The carrots not only add color they add texture.

I agree with all the comments about it being a strangely arranged recipe. Unfortunately mine curdled at the end and I didn't even simmer the roux for 20 minutes as specified by the recipe. Tastes great though!

Made this after making another copycat recipe and this one is really tasty, easy to make and my family loved it but I do prefer my other copycat recipe just a smudge more. The other calls for dry mustard powder and a pinch of cayenne which just adds that tiNY bit more depth of flavour. I would recommend this recipe however!!

I made it pretty much just like the recipe. Delicious! Same day I was making sourdough bread, so I just fashioned some little bread bowls., topped with grated Parmesan, and broiled until cheese melted.

Loved the recipe.  I follow the lead of others in their reviews by adding cream last.  I also added some crumbled bacon for flavor as well as nutmeg.  Overall it is a fantastic dish once you add a little more flavor.

I thought it was a little bland, even though I used sharp cheddar. I added some dry mustard and red pepper, and that gave it the needed zip.

I love Panera Bread's soup and when my husband and I got married and moved there weren't any Panera Bread restaurants near us so I took to the internet and found this recipe and it tastes fantastic! I would venture to say it tastes better than Panera Bread. My only shortcuts is I use "mexican blend" grated cheese and sometimes substitute chicken for vegetable broth if I want to cut calories

I did what a lot of the comments suggest: pour the broth into the flour/butter mixture and then veggies and diced yellow potatoes (already boiled/steamed) and then the milk and cheese.  Added garlic powder and a little salt. Used sharp cheddar and muenster cheeses. Garnished with pepper and red pepper flakes. Definitely making this again!

I made this soup exactly as written and it was very good! My kids & husband really liked it topped with shredded cheddar cheese. The vegetables were not as soft as I would have wanted and the soup was a bit bland. Next time, I am going to sauté the onions, carrots & celery together then add that mixture to the milk/ broth mixture. I may also add a clove of garlic and a dash of nutmeg too. Overall,  a good soup.

I made it the first time exactly as is. It was good but not great.  It was really too cheesy and me and my husband love cheese. I tweaked it the second time and put in one less cup of cheese and a triple cheddar blend instead of sharp cheddar and it was so much better.   Overall a good base that you can tweak with your own personal preferences. I do love that it is so good with very few ingredients

Not sure this soup can be bad, but then I make good soup, most of the time!  After reading the reviews I decided to use the cream soup procedure that has stood the test of time.  I sauteed the onions, simultaneously simmering the other veggies in the stock, moving right along to making a light roux.  I used the seasoned flour that I always keep on hand.  Then I saw that we were running low on milk, so I cut it to one cup and added another cup of stock.  I mixed in the onions and roux and brought the pot back to a simmer, tasted for seasoning and to be sure that the flour was cooked, and turned the pot off.  Then the cheese went in and I ramped the richness back up with a splash of cream.  Then I found out that I had added a cup too much of broccoli.  See why I said that this recipe can't be wrecked?

Very good.  It doesn't have to take 50 minutes to make, though.  Cook the onion in the 1/4 cup butter, add the flour, cook for a couple minutes then add the broth and milk, mix well with whisk until there are no clumps, then add the rest of the ingredients minus the cheese (takes 15-20 minutes once the soup starts to simmer).  Then add the cheese.  It will be done in thirty minutes.

I made this soup exactly as posted except for a slight change in procedure.  I mixed the flour with the vegetables & butter before adding the liquid.  There's no reason for my change other than this is how I have always done it so I knew there would be no possibility of flour lumps.  I made no changes to the ingredients & both my husband & I loved this soup.  It really thickens as it cools, especially when we stored the leftovers in the fridge overnight.   The taste was even better the next day & I just added more milk to thin it out a bit.  
Wonderful recipe.  (Note:  You could even use this as a dip by maybe adding some spices or chilies.  It's just that good.)

I get so angry cooking, especially during the part where i was mixing the flour with the butter. But i just added the chicken stock and brought it to a nice consistency.  Added all the ingredients, additional 3 minutes and bam, turned out perfect.

Very good. I added the flour to the onion mixture then added the cream.  No need to removed the onions  to make the rue I used heavy cream instead of milk. I also added some garlic. Very good! My Mom even asked for the recipe!

Fabulous 
The only thing I did was to use my immersion blender before adding the cheese.  My husband couldn't stop saying wow and mmmmm !

I made it according to the recipe. But I did make a couple adjustments to it by adding more cheddar, garlic, and added vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. All and all it gave me the base I needed. Thanks!

While we did love this soup and will make again, I did follow suggestions of other reviewers and added the broth to roux mixture, then  cooked veggies for 20 min. Added 1/2 and 1/2 (next time I think I'll use while milk), brought I back up to temperature then added cheese. Give it a taste then add appropriate amounts of salt and pepper to your liking. It was fine for hubby but I put a few drops of Worcestershire sauce in my bowl.

This soup turned out great! My picky-eater Husband even had a second bowl. (Yay!!)

I will have to say, however, that I didn't follow the directions exactly. I used a lot less onion, and only about a Tbs. of very fine celery-which I sautéed with the onion. I also used a lot less carrots- about six baby carrots, which I shredded so they would soften faster. #PickyHusbandProblems.

Awesome. More cheese does not hurt, but more importantly, this is just a cheese sauce without browning the flour. We like to make a roux by cooking the flour until it is dark golden. It has a richer flavor, and you don't need to simmer "until the flour smell is gone," because it will be already. We also like to cook the onions until they start to brown. Delicious.

This turned out great! Since my daughter is a vegetarian I used vegetable stock instead of chicken. Also I sautéed the onions in the big pot then made the rue with the onions and added stock instead of milk. I then added milk and simmered for 20 minutes. So so good!

Thank you for inspiring the jump off for this. So I gave the recipe 5 stars as it is. I made it as is first then adjusted for my own version of this...bottom line, I now prefer mine (and even yours too) over Panera. my budget does too!

Fantastic recipe!  So delicious and so easy!  I can't wait you make this again.  I added an additional 2 cups of chicken broth, but the thickness of soup is a personal preference.... all the stars!
My kids wouldn't even taste it, but my husband and I didn't mind a bit.... more for us!

I read all the reviews, which were extremely helpful in making this soup. I took the advice and did sauté the onions in the butter flour and then chicken stock. Next time I would also sauté the celery with the onions as they were too crunchy for my taste in the soup. I also made 4 cups of broth rather than two to not make the soup so thick. The taste overall was good. Adding different types of cheeses (I did mozzarella with cheddar) makes for a flavorful base.

It was good but not great. The flour part is the part that bothered me. If there was something else someone could suggest to use to thicken it up other than flour- let me know! I used only two cups of grated cheddar cheese instead of 2 1/2. I'm glad I did. It was reallllyyy cheesy! Maybe next time I will skip the flour completely because the cheese seems like it would thicken it up enough. Other than that it was good!

Delicious!  You definitely need to sautee the onions first & cook the veggies before adding milk/cream.  I used half cream and half milk since I had it on hand and it was a very yummy soup!

I used a whole onion .I added one chicken stock cube at the veg adding part as well, as a few people said it was bland and a taste test made me want more flavour but then  i added no salt .  I added to the flour and butter with the stock first as some others did.  I only added i cup of cheese and felt this was enough as i wanted to be able to taste the broccoli as well as cheese.  I didn't cook the sauce and then the veg i just added it altogether and cooked it didn't need to have 20 minutes before adding the veg. I liquidised to blend the flavour through but enough to still have chunks.  I added milk to the consistency we like.  This soup was a filling soup full of flavour with a tang of cheese It was lovely.  Thank you

I made this recipe just as it was written, except I didn't have any celery on hand and I just sliced my carrot. It was incredibly delicious! It would have been better only if my homemade bread bowls had worked out. I'll definitely make this again.

I've made this several times and the family loves it. The only thing I have changed is the order that I cook the ingredients. This is the same as several other reviewers. The milk should be put in last not first.

Will make again. I had to change a few things, but it turned out better than paneras.
1. I added a bit more flour to the roux. 
2. I added an extra 2cups of broth to the soup. I also used veggie broth instead of chicken.
3. I added 2 bay leaves while the broth was simmering. This improved the flavor greatly.

Very good soup!  I added more veggies than it called for and diced ham, ended up grating a bit more cheese than it called for so added all of it. Only reason for four stars is the cooking process, would simplify it next time (like many other reviews). My husband who does not love cooked broccoli loved this soup!

Didn't bother to saute the the onions and butter in a separate pan. Did everything in one soup pot for convenience.  Still turned out great! The only thing I omitted was the celery because I didn't have any on hand. Was a hit with my 14 month old son. Any way to get him to eat veggies is a win in my book! Will make again.

I made this with a few minor changes. I increased the amount of broccoli and used fresh not frozen. I also omitted the celery and added garlic. I used 8 oz. of extra sharp cheddar and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the finished product. Served with some crusty garlic bread. This was one of the best soups I have ever had anywhere! It will definitely become a regular.

I made this with a few modifications, and it was wonderful.

I'm not sure about the posted servings, though.  I added an extra 1/2 cup broccoli, a can of sliced mushrooms (1/2 cup),  1/2 cup of diced red bell pepper, 3 Tbsp Gochujang chili paste, and I used a whole onion instead of a half.  With my additions, the recipe made two quarts.  At  8 servings without my changes, that's less than 1/2 cup (4 oz) per serving, so be aware.

The chili paste (which I added at the end) made it taste like spicy pimento cheese, and I will definitely make this again.

I liked it ok, but it was a bit runny and it seemed like after simmering over an hour that the broccoli should have cooked so it wouldn't be crunchy.  Once we sat down to eat I still found a few pieces crunchy.  I think I want to try this recipe again, but put it together the way I would and see how it turns out.  I am wondering if it was user error.  Lol

This turned out really well. The only issue I had was that the flour never turned into that paste-like consistency that was in the video and we couldn't figure out why. In the end the soup did seem just a bit grainy, probably having something to do with this, like maybe for whatever reason the flour never fully dissolved (and yeah, that probably had something to do with the flour never thickening when mixed with the butter). Not sure if the flour was old (we used my mom's stash but she didn't think it was).

But that aside, in the grand scheme of things, this turned out really well. Even my five year old niece finished her plate. Of course she wanted a popsicle, but at her age, it still counts.

Quick note: My mom thought it was too thick, but I liked the consistency. Next time, we'll probably add a wee bit more chicken broth or milk to the mix to thin it out some. We'll probably also add some garlic next time because... yum... garlic. I love the versatility of this one.

I doubled this recipe and found it difficult to get rid of the flour flavor. The soup was bland so I kept adding other ingredients to make it taste better. I added way more cheese than recommended and garlic powder as well.  This definitely doesn't taste like panera's broccoli cheddar.

This soup was just so-so and didn't remind me of the Panera version.  It was lacking something special for us and my husband wouldn't even finish his bowl.  I do recommend for anyone trying it, is to add the veggies at the beginning and let them simmer in the broth for flavor, and to wait til the end to add the milk so that it doesn't curdle and give a weird texture to your soup.  I did enjoy making it.  Thank You for the recipe!

This was wonderful! The only difference that I made was I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 light cream. I also used xx sharp cheese. I would suggest little or no salt added. and also cooking the veggies a little longer unless you do like your veggies in soup crunchy. My husband was very skeptical as he is not a broccoli lover , but even he said it was good.

I followed the recipe as directed  accept  I added the milk and flour mixture at the end instead.  I also added some additional spices; pepper, garlic and salt.  It came out pretty good for my first try at making soup.  The only problem I had was getting all the cheese to melt but overall it was very tasty.

My whole family loved this recipe. I had even thinned it out by adding about an extra 3/4 cups milk - not because it looked too thick but because it didn't make as much soup as I expected. I would definitely double the recipe next time. It says 8 servings but it was not quite enough for my family of 6 (two of which are small children and don't eat much.)

I can't believe how simple this recipe was to make. I had all of the ingredients in the house except celery. I substituted half a teaspoon. I really tastes good and now I don't have to trek all the way to Panera Bread.

this recipe was OK. however, it calls for waaaay too much cheese. it probably sounds silly, but it was overkill. all I and my husband could taste was cheese. I'd say cut it down to a cup less. it also doesn't make a very large amount. you probably want to double the recipe (but not the cheese)

I cant believe my super picky girls ate this! I made it like the recipe but I did something different on accident because of my lack of attention to instructions. I sauted the onions and left them in the butter and added the milk and chicken broth.  So the onion stayed in the mixture the entire time...  the pieces where a bit  chunky so I put the soup in my magic bullet and blended them down to make a more smooth soup.  We WILL add this to the recipe for weekly dinners!

It turned out really well. I did what others suggested, which was to add the flour mixture at the end. I also used an immersion blender to create smaller broccoli pieces.

I have made this soup exactly as written many times.  I use either Balderson old cheddar cheese or Black Diamond old cheddar cheese.  Either one works really well bc they are very both very sharp.  To keep your cream from curdling, simply use low heat, and a very large whisk, stirring often.  Turns out great, every time.

I made this for my Christmas cookie party (to off-set the onslaught of sugar) and everyone LOVED it. I'm a beginning cook and found it easy to do---especially since I skipped all the steps about heating on the stove and threw everything into the crock pot. Cooked the night before for approx. 4 hours, refrigerated over night,  reheated in crock pot for 30 min the night of.

So many recipes out there for broccoli cheddar soup, but this is one of the best. It has a nice balance of broth and milk, and the carrots add to the flavor and color. A definate keeper.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using half and half instead of straight milk. Hubby said he never wants Panera broccoli cheese soup again! He said this is a 10/10. It is delicious. This is a definite keeper!!

I made mine more like I would when I make clam chowder. I sauteed the onion and then added the celery, carrots and enough of the chicken broth to cover the vegetables. I then simmered for about 8-10 minutes and then added the broccoli. I simmered for about another 7 minutes or until the broccoli was tender. I followed the recipe  with the flour, butter, milk and stock. Simmering for about 20 minutes as called for. I then added the vegetables and simmered about 10 minutes more before adding the cheese and some pepper. My son who never had this type of soup before, loved it and so did it. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was a hit !! I rated 4 stars because like many of the other reviewers I made changes. I used the broth to thicken, instead of milk and it worked out perfectly! I saved the milk and added it at the end with the cheese . Added a cube of chicken flavor to the broth, and a pinch of nutmeg to the final product . Thanks to the other reviews for these tips, it turned out great and family devoured this soup ! Also, as per another suggestion, I threw much of the soup in the magic bullet and blended for a few seconds then back to the pot for a more creamy soup !

Oh man, this was REALLY good. As usual, I tweaked it a bit - as written, the roux mixture was suuuuper thick, so I added quite a bit more chicken broth, and also some heavy cream. Had some Parmesan that needed using up, so I grated that into it, too. I used my trusty stick blender to blitz half of the soup, and then I added the julienned carrots. Absolutely delicious! In an ideal world, I would make bread bowls to serve it in, but since I am lazy, that just isn't gonna happen. Anyhoo, thanks for a fantastic recipe, gildawen!

My family was not sure about this soup (my family is not big on onions), but they LOVED it. I wished I had made more; it was only enough for two large bowls. If you are serving this as a main dish for more than two persons; I would double the recipe.

I liked it.  I added some water and used celery salt instead of celery.  Also added a tiny bit of nutmeg.  Used monterey jack instead of cheddar because I did not have any.  I loved it.

I made the following changes.
#1 I sauteed the onions and celery in the butter adding a pinch of salt and fresh ground pepper.  Once the onions were translucent, I add 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic,  cooked for a couple of minutes. and then added the flour. 
#2 In place of chicken stock, I used vegetable, simmered a bit before adding the broccoli.
#3 While the rest of the soup was cooking,  I melted 2 TBS of butter in a separate sauce pan, added equal amounts of flour to make a roux .. Once incorporated I  slowly poured in 2 Cups of warm milk and  melted in approximately 3 Cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 1 tsp of paprika. When done,  I pour the cheese mixture in with the rest of the soup, heated through and served. Garlic bread and black olives on the side.

I was concerned about the lack of seasoning to this soup so I also added a cube of chicken bullion to the broth.  

As others suggested, I added broth rather than the milk to the rous.  I also immediately added the veggies to the broth to allow them to cook and flavor the broth as it thickened.  Once cooked, I added the cheese and milk and heated through before serving.

Four as written but with modifications it was a spot on copy of Panera's soup.  Cooked the onion and celery in 1 tbsp butter then added the rest of the butter.  Roux took about 5-6 minutes to come together, then slowly whisked in the broth.  Simmered for twenty minutes and added broth as needed to prevent sticking.  Only one cup of milk, all of the cheese and brought it back up to just under a simmer.  It came out exactly as I wanted it to.  Thanks for a great start!

I love this soup but I don't use flour in it.  For those gluten free folks I also use about 1 1/2 lb of Velvetta and other cheeses and a good lb of broccoli and carrots that I cook in the chicken broth.  After it's made I use an immersion blender to cream the soup and thicken it without flour.  It's very adaptable to what you have on hand.  If I don't have velveeta I just use cheese.  A mixture of cheese is good and 1/2 of milk  and 1/2 cream or half and half.  If I need more I also add more chicken stock.  If it's seasoned it's delicious.

I made this recipient for the first time and it was amazing! My husband who doesn't even like soup absolutely raved about it. It tastes exactly like the Panera soup. This recipient fed five of us with a little leftover. This recipie is the only one I will use for broccoli cheese again.

This is so easy and so delicious!!  I use whole milk  and unsalted butter and I double the carrots and broccoli.  And because of the amount of cheese I do not add any salt to this recipe...it's perfect without it.  So good!!

Very good basic recipe..... easy to make, the right consistency,but very bland. Adding the milk and roux prior to the broth doesn't work for me.  It wasn't the way I was taught to cook and I've never done it that way. So this is what I did:  I used all the ingredients in the given amounts. I didn't follow the preparation order. Instead I sautéed the onions in the butter, added the carrots (which I shredded in my food processor) and the chopped celery. Cooked them down.  Then I added the chicken broth reserving a small amount to thin the roux. Now here's where the broccoli was added which was chopped more fine than course.  Added the milk....which, by the way, I think the soup is thick and rich enough without adding the extra calories of half and half or a heavy cream. I then brought the heat up  and cooked just under a boil for about 20 minutes. The soup needs to be watched closely and stirred frequently once the milk is added. It wants to stick to the bottom. Then  I used an immersion blender to thin the soup of large chunks, added the  cheese which was cut into tiny cubes and blended again with the blender.... In the mean time I am making the roux. Lastly, I add the roux to the soup and WaaLaa!  We've got a beautiful soup of a very nice not too thick, not too thin consistency. Now the taste test......soooo very bland:(( Oh my....I tasted more carrots than anything.  So,  I add  2 teaspoons of chicken bullion base, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of fresh ground white pepper,

This soup is awesome!  My husband and I love Paneras and we think this recipe is even better!  I followed the recipe with the exception that I did not add salt and pepper and I did not blend it. We like it chunky. I've made it twice in the last week!

I made this for my in laws to eat at a later date but I did keep aside a couple bowls for us. It was the best I've ever made, in fact the best I've ever eaten.  Something that may make a difference is using a good quality white cheddar, which is what I did.  I'm about to make it again but this time it's for us!

Wow, yum!  However, I did follow other reviewers and sauteed a whole chopped onion and celery in 2 TBS butter before moving on with the recipe.  This is from the bible of soup making!  Always sweat out the veggies first! My broccoli was precooked because I had leftovers from dinner and had cooked waayyyy too much broccoli!  Instead of flour to thicken, I kept out 1/2 cup of milk and added 3 TBS corn starch to the milk.  Stirred that in the rest of the ingredients and brought to a simmer.  Thickened beautifully without that extra 1/4 cup of butter (and fat!).  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE butter, but trying to save a few calories whenever possible!  Also, next time I would precook the carrots to some extent, because you really should not be simmering a soup with milk in it or you risk it tasting scalded.

I like this soup a lot but the directions are a bit strange. I just use it as a reference to what ingredients you would need and I eyeball and taste test along the way. It does taste very similar to Panera's version :)

I couldn't eat this because of the dairy, but made it for my husband. He loved it! I used the same amounts of ingredients, but changed the order of the recipe steps to make it easier. I started with Step 2 first for making the roux. Then, followed the first part of step 3 to finish making the roux, whisking constantly. Bring to a simmer and then leave the roux on medium-low. On to the veggies! I used my dutch oven (or go ahead and use a small stainless steel stock pot) and sautéed onion, carrots, and celery for about 3 minutes. Then, I added the broccoli (fresh, not frozen florets) to the veggies and added about ½ tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper. Continue sauteeing for about 3 minutes. Also, keep an eye on the roux and whisk it intermittently—you might want to reduce the heat to low until you are ready to add it to the veggies. Add the roux to the pot with the veggies. Mix to combine and simmer for about 20 minutes. Stir in cheddar cheese until melted. I used an immersion blender to puree the soup for my husband since he had several teeth extracted recently, but he sure would have loved to eat it sans puree! The soup looked and smelled so good I was jealous I could not eat it!

I made this dish. I made some minor changes. My son doesn't like broccoli so I chopped it fine by using a food processor. I also added turmeric powder, seasoned salt, and garlic powder to the veggies. I then added parsley flakes in the final round. Great soup. Thank you!

Made as written and my family ate it up and cleaned the pot! (be careful not to simmer to high or the milk will curdle)

Great recipe! I let it cook longer because the carrots and celery took longer to soften, added a sliced green squash and substituted regular onion with green onion. Great texture, nice and cheesy, and easy though it does take time. I'm going to use the slow cooker next time using the stove only for the flour and butter roux to add in at the end.

Broccoli and cheese soup is my favorite. Really tasty and easy recipe. As for it being bland, the brand of cheese you use is important. Not all cheese is made equal. I personally love Cabot's extra-sharp cheddar. Other than the cheese, add anything you want to add to the taste. As simple as it is, just reading the ingredients should pretty much tell you what it tastes like.

Made it, liked it but the steps are overdone and out of sync. I would have sauteed all the veggies together first, made the roux with the chicken broth and added the milk last with the cheese. Also, another reviewer  suggested 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of half & half, which I did.  I doubt making these changes could reduce the deliciousness but would make it less time consuming.

Make sure you actually let the roux and chicken stock thicken before adding your veggies. I gambled on time and thought if I added the veggies while it thickened, I could cut the cook time in half. SO WRONG! The taste was great but it never thickened so I had a watery base. Some things in recipes are suggestions and some things are instructions, and THAT, ladies and gents, was the latter. Xoxo

I tried this, and I was very impressed. I simmered a very thinly sliced carrot in about a half cup water in a medium saucepan while chopping a whole onion. Then, I added the onions and let them simmer while I finely chopped about a half head of broccoli. Once I had the broccoli chopped, I added it, along with about another half cup of water to the saucepan, covered it, and boiled it for about 7 minutes. In another saucepan, I made the roux, added about 2 1/2 cups milk, stirring constantly on medium heat. Once roux was totally dissolved, I added it to the veggies, added about a 1/2 tsp. garlic powder , 1 tsp. dried minced onions, and about 3 tsp. chicken bouillon.  I added about a cup of shredded mild cheddar, but sharp would have been better. Adding some parmesan would be good, too. I found the soup to be excellent, and I will try and add celery and nutmeg next time. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I followed other reviewers and added the chicken stock after the flour.   When the flour was all incorporated and thickening I added  the carrots , sauteed onions and celery and simmered for 20-30 minutes before I added 1/2 cream and 1/2 whole milk and the broccoli florets.  Other than salt and pepper I also added about a tsp of garlic powder.  Ten minutes before serving I added the cheese.  My family LOVED this and I will definitely make it again this winter!

I agree with a lot of the other reviews in the order should be broth then milk. I used half and half, 8 oz of fresh cheddar, and 3 slices of American cheese, and it still lacked flavor. Won't do this one again.

I love broccoli cheese soup and this one was a bit different from those I've tried previously. I followed the recipe as written except that I had some evaporated milk to use up, so I used that as part of the milk and decreased the flour a bit to compensate. Next time I plan to save a bit of time by cooking the carrots, broccoli and celery in the broth while I make the white sauce in another pan, then combining.

I made this soup tonight and my only changes were, I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.( my family is vegetarian) and I simmered the vegetables the full time in the milk/stock base. It turned out wonderful and my daughter who is a very picky eater ate 2 bowls:) so big hit! Thanks for the recipe!

My daughter really loved this soup. I served it to her with sliced French bread from Publix. I didn't prepare it the exact same way as described in the directions because they seemed kind of confusing, but it all it's all it came out the same way and was still delicious. I will definitely be preparing this again for those cold winter nights.

This soup is amazing and DOES taste like Paneras version!  I followed a recommendation from another review and cooked all the veggies in the stock for 20 mins (I waited to add the broccoli til half way thru), then made the roux separate and added in at the end with the cheese. 
The whole thing took about 30 mins total and it was FANTASTIC!

I left out the celery, just because I don't like it .i also added 2 extra cups of chicken stock , because it was too thick to cook the broccoli and carrots but it did thicken back up as it cooked and the veggies got done and I added the cheese. Other than that it's great!

This soup is amazing and tastes just like paneras. It is a very easy recipe to follow as well! My fiance is so picky and he lovessss this soup. For those that dont feel the same and say its bland, i can tell you your probably doing something wrong. Because it has incredible flavor.  I make this for family and friends when i have get togethers i have yet to have someone not compliment it.

This tastes like the restaurant's soup, but the technique is odd.  I have tried it as written and it works, but found easier ways to make it.  Setting aside the onion is unnecessary.  Once they are softened add the other vegetables and the chicken broth.  Simmer until cooked.  Meanwhile, make the roux (flour and butter), and stir in the milk bit by bit.  I like to stir the shredded cheese into it after the milk.  Then I stir this cheese sauce into the vegetable soup and adjust the seasoning.  

I usually add a bit of garlic and nutmeg at the beginning.  Otherwise I really like this recipe.

Loved it! But like others said, I thought the recipe was backwards.  So, I simmered the broccoli and carrots in the chicken broth with a little water.  Sautéed the onion and celery in butter.  Made the roux very thick - and my husband is gluten free so I used gluten free flour mix.  Then I added all to the veggies along with the cheese,  a little salt, pepper and granulated garlic.    Delicious

I cooked about two inches of the broccoli stems, carrots, a fist sized cut up potato and onions  in the butter until tender.  To this I added the flour stirring till smooth.  I added 1/2 and 1/2 and stirred all till smooth. I added the chicken broth and then cooked for 20 m. I used a bag of Sargent four-cheese Mexican cheese.

I changed one item. Instead of 2 cups of milk, I used 1 cup of dry milk and 1 cup of half and half. These 2 ingredients gave the soup the consistency and flavor I wanted. Absolutely delicious

Reminds me of the soup my Great grandmother used to make! I used the veggies right out of my organic garden! I feel like it is my drug of choice, love fresh veggies!

I did not do all of the simmering time, It really did not need all of that time to be ready for the next stage, I diced up a full length carrot and i diced my celery. this is prob why those did not need as long to soften. I think it took half the time for me to make this batch. Also for seasonings i used Garlic pepper and Himalayan sea salt. 

I sauteed the onions, put them in a small bowl and then put in the butter in the pan until melted, added the flour until it was to the consistency I liked. I added the milk and broth at the same time. and stirred periodically as it thickened, only took half the time than what is listed. then i added in the veggies, and about 3-4 min later added in the cheese. I did say broth because i used 2 chicken bullion cubes and made 2 cups of broth since i do not have stock on hand. 

The Garlic pepper is another Allrecipe that I love. Highly recommend it.

I have been successfully making copycat panera broccoli cheese soup for a long time so I thought I'd add the variations for what I think make it perfect: 2 cups half n half instead of milk, no celery, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg at the end with the (8 oz.) cheese. The nutmeg is key! We have NEVER been disappointed with this recipe!

I made this soup. I did not use the celery. I used half and half instead of milk. I used frozen broccoli. I cooked the soup longer on low, instead of 20 minutes, I cooked it for 35 min, then added the soup. I also added chicken cubes for flavor. I will diffinitely be making this again!

This was delicious. The recipe is pretty forgiving too. I didn't follow the steps the right way and it was still awesome. I used 1 cup heavy cream and extra stock. I'm making it again tonight but this time 1% milk. It's all I have and I don't feel like running to the store. I hope it is still delicious.

It was my first time making broccoli cheese soup at home and I really liked it! My husband loved it too. I did make some small changes..i put the celery in a food processor instead of sliced, I also used ALOT more butter then called for. I used  whole stick...along with whole milk. I also sauteed my shredded carrots first in minced garlic and added some garlic powder to the mixture. I added 4 cups of sharp cheddar cheese to the soup then used some more for garnish. It turned out amazing! Not the healthiest but definitely tasty

This soup has a fantastic flavor! Never had the restaurant version. I followed direction as stated.  The only thing I had to do was add more flour to the milk mixture because it did not thicken over the 20 minute period. No big deal. The soup was a hit for the whole family!! This is a keeper! Going to make this again! Might even have to double the recipe so we can have more!

We loved this!  I followed Christina's advice and sweated the veggies (minus the broccoli) in the butter before making the rue.   
I also steamed the broccoli ahead of time, because my husband has a sore tooth and I need the broccoli really soft.  I added about 1/4 teaspoon cayenne and about 1/2 garlic powder.   Everything else was just as written.  
I will make this again and again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This doesn't taste similar to Panera Bread's I thought. There was so much cheese, and the sharp cheddar was overwhelming. If you use this recipe I definitely recommend using a milder cheddar and your own seasonings.

This will be my go to recipe for cream soups!  I'm lazy, so I did everything in one pot. Sauteed my onions and celery in all the butter, then added the flour, and cooked a minute.  Added my two cups of chicken broth and one cup of cream, we like it thick, stirred in the broccoli and carrots, cooked til done.  Off heat added one cup of cheddar and one cup of swiss cheese.  My DH loved it.  Thank You for posting.

I made this recipe it is excellent. I changed the process and added all of the butter at one time with the vegtables and sauteed them all together  add the flour and continued to sauté the mix before adding the liquids and the broccoli. Everyone liked it and the cooking process was much easier, and quicker.

Super good! I changed up the cooking instructions and sauteed my veggies in butter first, then made my roux,  added chicken stock, then heavy cream and extra milk to thin.... I didn't measure ingredients exactly as specified but this recipe was an excellent guide for me. Thank you!

I took the advice of reviewers DIZ @$%& and Valerie Gray Smith below, and sauteed the veggies in butter first (with a teaspoon of minced garlic thrown in), then added the milk, cheese, and seasoning. Lastly, I added pre-steamed broccoli florets (nuked 'em 3 mins.) Terrific soup, 5 stars. I rated it four because I changed the recipe from what would have been pretty bland soup, and split the difference.

Great recipe. I used white cheddar cheese & added more spices. 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper doesn't make it spicy but more flavourful.

Superb recipe. I used halfandhalf, and added a half-teaspoon  of nutmeg, a tablespoon of garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard. My granddaugbter is a very fussy eater and she had two bowls, so it is safe to say she liked it - and that is a true endorsement if I do say somyself. Would definitely recommend. It was truly awesome.

I used olive oil for making the roux, and cut it down to three tablespoons of each to make the sop a little less thick.  I cooked the carrots and celery the full amount, but added the broccoli at the halfway mark so it was a little less "done".   To those who say it can lack flavor, make sure you use a good sharp cheese, or try a little garlic salt, or my favorite last minute addition, a drop or two of Tabasco.  No one thinks its hot, it just has a little more tang.   The use of 2% milk instead of half & half, which I have seen in some recipes, makes the soup a little less rich, but then you can butter your French bread or rolls!!

I made changes based off of suggestions from some of the other comments - basically sautéed the onion/celery/carrots first to build flavor and added the dairy stuff last. It came out wonderfully with those adjustments.

Three stars for the way the instructions are written, but five stars for a delicious soup! It makes no sense the way this was written though. It needn't be so complicated and truthfully, backwards in that you never want to cook your veggies in your thickened soup. So... follow the ingredients list, but simply saute your veggies till tender, add butter and flour and whisk until smooth and flour cooks out a bit (about 2 minutes), then add your milk and broth, whisking until smooth and thickened. Remove from heat, add cheese, stir to melt and serve. Yummy, simple and delicious!!

This was a good base to start with but it needed more flavor for me.  I added a half orange bell pepper, 1 shallot with the onion, garlic, dill and turmeric.  I also chose to use a cup of strong Gouda and 1.5 cups of sharp cheddar.  After the changes, I love it!

I made this soup followed the recipe to the T and it came out delicious. It fed 5 no problem with one having seconds. I did use a scale to get the half pound of broccoli and ounces of cheese.  I also used an immersion blender. I did not blend it all because I wanted it to have some texture to it but it would've been good either way. To be honest I've never had Panera but I know a good broccoli and cheddar soup when I taste it and this was good. There are no left overs but I wish there was.

I made this soup today for dinner. I added garlic to the sauteed onion and celery. It really boosts the flavor. I added about 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper because BEFORE adding the cheese, the soup tasted like it needed some flavoring. Since adding the cheese it became just a little salty, but not too bad. The main reason for the 3 stars is the texture. Shortly after the cheese melted, it curdled into tiny bits. The flavor is fine, but the texture is a little off-putting. I would not make this again unless I can find a remedy for that issue.

I thought this had really good flavor. I did add 2 cubes of chicken bouillon and added the butter, flour, milk, cheese at the end as suggested by others. I also added a couple dashes of nutmeg at the end and will do this again. The nutmeg gave the  soup a more complex taste. Very good!

I found this to be tasteless, even though the recipe would seem to be sufficiently flavored.  The consistency was good but, the ingredients became very granular in texture once the soup was cooked.

I agree that the method is odd but it worked just fine.  I made it as written but when I tasted it, I agreed with another reviewer that it needed something.  I added only 1 tablespoon of chicken stock powder and a teaspoon of garlic powder and then it was YUMMY!  Too salty really, but that's because I tried to liven it up with salt and pepper to taste BEFORE I went to the garlic and chicken stock powder.  Next time I make it, and I will, I will add the stock powder to the stock itself near the beginning, and maybe add fresh garlic to the sautéed onion instead of using powder. Then I will be able to get salt and pepper right, if even needed, at the end.

The only changes I made were to omit celery and use more broccoli (almost .5 pounds) and carrot (.25 pounds).  First of all, it was extremely flavorful, and I wonder if the lack of taste others describe has to do with the broth they used. We used chicken STOCK, as it calls for, and the flavor was spot on. However, the soup came out so thick that it questions the definition of soup. Yes, some of that might have been the extra broccoli and carrots, but the actual broth was also very thick. I don't think it needs to cook for so long before adding the veggies. Or it needs more of the stock... Something. It was still quite delicious though, even super thick.

Edit: Made this again, used exactly 1C of carrots, 4oz of broccoli, and one 8oz block of cheese, shredded. Left the onion in the pan when I moved on to the flour step, and then added only chicken stock for the first 20 minutes. Added the 2C milk when I added the veggies. This time, the consistency was perfect. Will use 10-12 oz of cheese (block, shredded, not pre-shredded- huge difference!) next time and call this one a big keeper.

Nice and tasty and only took me 45 minutes from start to table.  I used chicken broth instead of stock and less cheese at the end by half a cup or so.   We loved it.

It was bland the carrots and broccoli didn't cook all the way in the time that was there. The milk kind of stuck to the bottom of my pot in the 20 minute time limit. So I'm going to try what The other people suggest and reverse it and put the milk in last. It tasted better the second day

This soup was so creamy and good. I love the addition of carrots. I would double batch it if I was making it again because my family wanted more.

directions? was a little to much work according to directions. Followed other raters lead and found on other site. Merge the  ingredients and directions. Came out good. It was a little bland at first. I added a little tarragon which gave it a different flavor. Wife is not a cheese fan, however she liked this.

I didn't think this tasted like Panera's soup. I am not a big fan of soup, but LOVE Panera's! This is very brothy and southern-tasting. Husband enjoyed it though.

Ok I personally thought it looked good until I tasted it. There were to many carrots and the taste was a bit bland but with the right amount of salt and pepper to taste, it turned out pretty good!!

I doubled the recipe and it made about a gallon worth of soup. 
Besides this I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out okay. In the end I ended up adding more garlic and onion powder to make the soup taste a bit more dynamic. Id recommend you season this heavily. Otherwise a decent cheddar broccoli soup recipe.

It was so good. My husband made it to take to a family dinner and it got rave reviews and we were asked multiple times for the recipe. It wasn't too salty like some cheese soups and you could still taste the veggies, which is important to me.

This is a great recipe! I did make these changes and have done so ever since the first time I made it.  Always use organic ingredients. Less toxins for you, your family and the planet :)
-Saute the onion and celery together
-next add the 2 cups of chicken broth along with the cooked onion and celery to a blender or food processor.  (I have a Blendtec and use the "soup" mode here). Wait, and add later, once you have the milk, butter and flour all mixed together.
-now start your butter/flour /milk (I use the same stock pot I cooked the onions and celery in)
-once that is all mixed into a smooth creamy consistency,  add the stock from the blender into the creamy base
-now add your cheese 
-salt, pepper, and a little fresh nutmeg to taste
- add however much broccoli  (I usually have frozen organic) and shredded carrots you want. I like grating my carrots with the finer grate. It helped them cook through faster and blend into the soup better.
Enjoy with a lightly warmed baguette!

The taste is good but goodness 20 minutes turned into more than an hour to get the veggies to cook. And even then they were still crunchy. Next time will steam broccoli and carrots before  adding.

I made it for my boyfriend, he loved it. I used 1 cup milk 1 cup half and half and shredded my own cheese instead of buying it already shredded (I swear it makes a difference). I am a vegetarian so I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. It was delicious. Better than Panera bread!

Very close to Panera's! I think the only difference between this & Panera's is the consistency. Panera's is smoother & creamier, while this is chunkier. That, & I'm not sure if panera's has carrot/celery. All in all, an amazing soup & less fat than other broccoli & cheese soups.

I initially thought this soup was bland.  I blended it in the blender and when I tasted it, it was much better without any changes.  

Blend it first, it improves the flavor.  Also, I did not simmer the milk and flour for 20 minutes.  Skip that part - add the broth and veggies and at the end add the milk.  It saves time.

Best broccoli soup I've ever made.  I've had some bad ones too.  This has a nice filling consistency.  Used a cup of half & half because one review recommended using whipping cream.   Liked having the carrots in there.

This soup was very good. A little rich from all the cheese. Next time I think I'll leave some out but very good regardless. Thanks for the recipe, definitely reminded me of Panera's.

As other reviews state,  it is a great foundation! I personally feel that the cheese is a little bit to strong. The next time I make this, I will use Medium Cheddar instead of Sharp. I also added a little bit of Chicken Bullion to mask some of the Veggies. It did the trick. With a little bit of fine tuning, this recipe Be exceptional! Thanks for sharing!

i sauteed all veggies, then added chicken stock till veggies were fork tender. Then I added chicken stock, thickner ( roux), and just regular 2% milk and cheese.  served with a crusty bread. Happy bellies and shorter cook time. I stole a tip from Ree Drummond's potato soup and added about a tsp of cajun seasoning and used a whole onion instead of half. had to add more stock/water than required because it didn't cover veggies. Great starting point.

Ingredients made a tasty soup but I agree - the instructions were odd. First make mirepoix - butter, onions, celery, carrots.  Then add stock and ensure they are cooked until soft; add broccoli towards the end (and tsp garlic powder). In a separate pan 1/4 butter, cook flour, then add to veggie broth. Lastly stir in milk, melt cheese, season w pepper.  Also good adding mushrooms w the broth.

This is my second 5-star recipe in a week - I feel like I am on a roll! This soup is very comparable to Panera's broccoli cheese, which I have always loved. The flavor is great, and this is very easy to prepare, although the only time consuming thing is chopping up all the vegetables. But it is so worth it! My husband, three boys (7, 4, and 2), and I all really liked this a lot. When I made this following the recipe, there was enough for the five of us, plus one extra bowl (which I ate the following day), so I think the next time I make it I will double the recipe so that we will have enough leftovers for everyone. In fact, I am thinking about making it again for my lunches for work this week since we still have enough veggies left to make again. I can't say enough how good this soup is! Thank you for sharing the recipe, gildawen!

My husband and I do a "meatless Monday" every week, and we love to cook together every time we get a chance. We decided to try this, because we love all of Panera's soups. We did tweak the recipe a bit based on other users suggestions. 
We used all of the same measurements and ingredients, except we added fresh garlic to sauté along with the onion. We also seasoned with a bit of salt, pepper, and a dash of cayenne at every step of the cooking process.
The other thing we did differently is that after whisking the flour and butter, we added the chicken broth AND the veggies, seasoned everything, whisked well, covered and simmered the veggies in the broth and flour mixture for 30 minutes. We then used 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of heavy cream, and the 2 1/2 cups of cheese. Wisked it all together and it was great! The only thing we could've done differently is added more broccoli.
This recipe is a must try. It's such a great base recipe that you can really play with and customize.

I added thyme for additional flavour as I too found it a bit bland, then after I added the carrots, sautéed onions and celery I cooked them until tender then blended it all with an immersion blender.  I then added the broccoli to the hot soup and let it cool to store in the fridge overnight.  The next day I heated the soup up and added the cheese, garnished it with extra cheese and broccoli pieces and served it to my dinner guests.  Soup always tastes better the next day!

4 stars as written,  but I made it a 5 star soup with minor changes. As others have said,  the cooking process is backwards and needs more flavor. Even after I added more  salt and onion powder,  the flavor was missing something, so I tried a few drops of Worcestershire sauce,  and it tasted fantastic.  As for cooking,  I sautéed the onions in butter,  added broth and veggies to simmer, and milk and cheese last.  it was easy,  will make again.

I LOVE this soup! I made exactly as written and it was most assuredly restaurant quality. I know I will be making this over and over this fall and winter. The only thing I will do differently next time is increase the broccoli maybe 2 cups.

You knocked this one out of the ballpark, girlfriend.  I choose this recipe  cuz it didn't use processed cheese food.  A couple of spuds, diced, gave it a tad more body and a sprinkle of garlic powder were all the changes I made.  YUM!

Excellent!  Made it as written although I didn't have any celery, used medium cheddar instead of old and 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 cup milk.  Great soup on a very cold day.

As a novice in the kitchen I must say this was amazing! I'm so proud of myself! 

    Instead of the White Enriched Flour I used Whole Wheat & mistakenly bought Vegan Broth as opposed to the Low Sodium Chicken Broth but it's still tastes tremendous. Also, I used the Original "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter." The consistency came out just a tad thicker than what I know the Panera brand would though. Any tips on what might have happened?

I absolutely love Panera's Broccoli Cheddar Soup. This was the closest I've come to copying their soup. I didn't change anything, and I thought the cheese curdled up a little when added. I'm not sure what should be changed to make it more like Panera's but it wasn't quite perfect. Overall, a good Broccoli Cheddar Soup.

I made this today and after reading a lot of the comments left on here I did make a few simple adjustments, for example I added the chicken broth when the recipe said to add milk to keep the flower from burning. I also put the carrots, celery and some extra broccoli through the food processor for a quick fine chop. It came out pretty well my only problem is that it seemed to be a bit grainy. Im not sure if I just did not whisk the flower, butter and broth long enough but either way the flavor was excellent after a little salt and pepper.

This is awesome soup!  Even my husband likes it and he doesn't like broccoli.  I just made a couple of changes.  I uses half and half cream instead of milk, I didn't use celery, and I added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  It was delicious!  Thank you.

You are right. This is one of my favorite soups, so I had to try it! The only change I made was using evaporated milk..everything is great as is. If you want Panera's best, don't change the recipe.

My son was craving the Panera soup that this recipe is copying so I gave it a try because I wasn't actually going to drive there to get it :-P
I had everything but the celery, the butter and the cheddar cheese on hand. I know right!! Don't freak out though, I had Gouda cheese and coconut oil :-D
The soup turned out wonderful with the substitutions I made. But I also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and a pinch of dry mustard during the last 10 minutes of simmering and it gave it a nice savory flavor. I decided to add those ingredients because I read   a couple of reviews mentioning that it was a tad bland.
I'm making this again within the next few days after I go grocery shopping and will try it with cheddar cheese because I did miss the sharp cheddar taste in the soup. But I plan to use coconut oil in place of the butter and keep the additions I made.
Awesome recipe Gildawen, thanks!

It was fabulous!  I didn't change anything but it was definitely not 8 servings.  I have 3 toddlers (so small servings), me and my husband and I  would definitely double because we had barely enough and we served with salad and bread.

This soup was FANTASTIC and fairly simple. It freezes well too. Don't rush the cooking process especially that 20 min simmer in the middle before adding the cheese. I rushed the second batch and it had a grainy texture instead of smooth and creamy.

This recipe was pretty good, though the serving size was a bit small and it wasn't as thick as I would have liked. I added extra cheese, milk, and flour and crotons as a little garnish. It tasted so good!
