This is one drink that I have a couple times during the holiday season. It's a little on the sweet side but great for those who like chocolate and mint together. TIP: This is even better if you use a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream instead of the cream and mix it up in the blender until smooth.

It was good but very very sweet. I used half and half but then added milk to try to dilute the sweetness.. then added more vodka to dilute it further.:) I'd probably reduce the creme de menthe a little and try it in a blender with ice next time.

These drinks were delicious and a pretty shade of green (maybe the other reviewer didn't use clear chocolate liqueur)! We drizzled the chocolate syrup around the edge of the drink at the end and it ran down the inside of the glass in funky streaks. Tastes just like mint chocolate chip ice cream. Fantastic!

Very sweet. I used milk instead of cream. Also added a little extra but it's still very sweet and very strong.

Vanilla vodka ruins this drink! Also BITD Smirnoff Blue was preferred. I always made mine (bartender) with equal parts 100 proof vodka and the liqueurs unless someone specifically wanted more or less of something. It used to be 1 oz each. Shaken and served in an "ups" glass or strained and poured over fresh ice.
