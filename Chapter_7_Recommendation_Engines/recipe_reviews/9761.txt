This is a nice, not too sweet, dense bar or square. I used a generous cup of carrots, added a grated apple and a Tbsp of lemon juice. I left out the butter and cut the sugar in half. Instead of 2 cups all purpose flour, I used 1 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup quick oats, 1/2 cup wheat germ. I am quite happy with it and will likely make again.

Very good and very easy.  I added in an 8oz can of drained crushed pineapple and topped the bars with the allspice cream cheese frosting.  A definite keeper.

I just made these bars, and was surprised to find no mention of where to put the 3 tbsps of butter.
I put the butter in the pot to simmer with the rest. I added extra spice: 1 tsp ginger. I also skipped
the walnuts, since without nuts these bars could be considered lowfat.
I cooked these bars for 25 minutes and that was enough.  The texture of these
bars isn't ideal, but the taste is nice. I'd probably put a bit less sugar (3/4 c) in next time and sprinkle
some powdered sugar on top.

A decent lowfat snack cake

This is a great recipe!  It's easy to make.  The spicy flavor is great.  The sugar can definitely be reduced, it's quite sweet as is.  Very good.

I also found no mention of the 3 Tbs butter so I put it in the pot to boil as well.  I used golden raisins which add a nice juicy addition.  I also made a quick cream cheese frosting to top them with, YUM!  Turned out kinda like carrot cake brownies!

A while ago I started looking for low calorie stuff to loose weight. This was one of the selections coming up. I read the reviews, followed others and made a few changes to bring calories down. Sweetening with stevia extract I’ve been doing for a few years. There is no bulk in the extract, I used ¾ C applesauce which is also a ‘switch’ used in baking for oil or fat, so I also passed on the butter. Recently read an article about health benefits of pineapple. Someone chose to drain pineapple and add to this. I didn’t think to look at the size of can the person used, I had a 20 oz. can (ugh a lot to add!) When draining it – the pineapple juice = I cup SO I used the juice instead of water. No raisons in the house–dried cranberries that are sweetened. The extra volume with the 20 oz. Pineapple – I used 1 ½ C oat flour and 1 ½ c oat bran. These turned out good, not too sweet, texture like a brownie. The cranberry carrot combination is very good. Next time I will double the spices. About losing weight – eating no dinner or very little has shed 10 pounds in 3 weeks. These will make good breakfasts.

Thanks to the reviewer who made the suggestion to cook the carrot mixture in a glass mixing bowl in the microwave, then mix everything else in that bowl.  So much easier and less to clean up!!  I used 2/3 cup Splenda,doubled the spices, omitted the raisins, added 2 tsps vanilla, 8 oz. can well-drained pineapple, and 1 cup chopped pecans. I also used a Cream Cheese Frosting.  The bars were a huge hit at a church gathering last night.  The next time, i will add 1/2 cup more shredded carrots and add 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  This recipe will be my new favorite cessert to take to pot lucks and family gatherings.

Very good bars. My kids helped make them and even with their imperfect measuring, they turned out great.

This is a great recipe and I will use it again. I used wholemeal flour and added some wheatgerm and linseed meal to give a little more fibre.

Excellent recipe! I used Newman's Own Orange Mango Tango juice in place of the plain OJ. I also made a glaze with the juice and confectioner's sugar. I only used the glaze on half the bars. I found the glaze made them more like dessert. Without the glaze, they seemed an indulgent breakfast. Like other reviewers, my bars were ready to come out of the oven after 35 minutes.

These are wonderful and will be great when asked to bring dessert! Next time I'll combine ingredients to be simmered in glass mixing bowl and microwave. Then add the remaining ingredients in same bowl.

Followed recipe exactly. Found it difficult to spread mixture into pan so it came out uneven. Baked for 25 minutes and was fully done. Delicious.

I really like this eggless recipe. I looked at some of the reviews & decided to add pineapple too. Also, I added the Pineapple reserve along with the Orange juice and water. I added Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate & used brown sugar. Delicious! Thank you for posting this recipe. I needed to bake something for a bake sale to benefit a local non-profit. I am so happy this turned out. Want to make it again.

I thought these would be a great snack for the kids but they were just so dense and lacked flavor.  I wouldn't make these again.

I thought that this was very good.  I will probably reduce the amount of cloves though.  This will be good to freeze in individual portions and put in the kids' lunchboxes!
