OMG - how awesome to find this recipe here! My Grandma used to make this 45 years ago, and it's always been my favorite. It was either from a magazine or a Baker's recipe pamphlet that she'd had at least since the 1930's or 1940's. I've made this so many times over the years and I can guarantee that it's fabulous! It's really decadent without being overly sweet. The sweetness comes from the meringue shell, which plays perfectly against the rich chocolate filling, when made as written. If you substitute Cool Whip it will be a much sweeter pie and have a much different texture as the whipped cream is what dictates the firmness of the filling. Whip the cream until very stiff and the consistency will be that of a sturdy mousse. This is a wonderful pie exactly as written, and is delicious without embellishments. The ONLY other suggestion I would make is to try using a non-stick pie pan, as I've had touble in the past with the meringue sticking to the pie dish (could just be our darned St. Louis humidity!); I thought about greasing and flouring the dish, as one does for cakes, but wasn't sure if that would work with the meringue or not. All in all though, excellent recipe. Thanks so much, Marcia, for submitting this, so I'll never have to worry about losing it again!

This dessert has a light airy crust and intense chocolate filling.  Let it sit a day before serving or the meringue may be chewy instead of soft.  I used cool whip instead of the cream and topped it with additional cool whip, pecans, and toasted coconut.  Yummy!

The crust shrunk, I went up the sides, need to mound higher than the sides.
I used fat free cool whip and it was yummy! Very chocolaty!

My family used to make this pie every year for Passover, because it's borderline Kosher. ;) We got it from an early edition of the New York Times cook book- I think from the mid-1960's.


The NYT book recommends unsweetened chocolate for the filling, which I prefer; it gives a more smooth, complex flavor to offset the sweetness of the other ingredients. Also, for some reason it recommends using room-temperature eggs for best results. Dunno why but I don't mess with success!


Make sure you beat the meringue until it's in VERY stiff peaks- otherwise it'll settle to the bottom of the pie tin and it may cook unevenly. Pile it up around the edges so you have a real crust, not just a flat thing.

The filling is easy, you just have to make sure you don't burn the chocolate- leave the burner on low and stir frequently until it's all melted. I also like to add a bit of vanilla to the whipped cream.


You can let this sit in the refrigerator as long as you like; just cover it so it doesn't dry out. Also, keep it chilled until you serve it, because the filling melts! It's still tasty, but it's more like pudding that way.


I'm baking this for a pie-themed party tomorrow and am anticipating much ooh-ing and ahh-ing!

I have been eating this pie for as long as I can remember and Iâ€™m 70. My mother made this time and again for my father and I with only one major problem it never lasted long enough. I like to let my eggs get room temperature before using. My daughters and son now cook this pie for their families. Wonderful pie.

I made this recipe just as stated and it turned out perfect! It is rich yet light with the meringue like crust. The only bad thing is it was too good and I had to use all my self control not to eat the whole pie!  It is a keeper for sure:)

My mother made this often when we were kids, and I've continued the tradition with my family. Now it's the grandkids who beg for it! I have found that for the most successful meringue crust, spray the pie pan with cooking spray first.  Once it's ready for the oven, bake at 275 for one hour.  Then - and this is the most important step - turn off the oven and leave the crust in for another 30 minutes.  This makes a big difference in ease of cutting and serving, in my experience. One more thing, I use superfine sugar instead of regular granulated.  Enjoy! This is a great recipe!!

Chocolate Angel Pie is our family's favorite.  I've been making it for over 40 years. The merengue crust makes it extraordinary. Definitely a 5 star dessert. Nancy Cook
