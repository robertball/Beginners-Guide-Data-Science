I am rating the technique as well as the recipe. Believe it or not, I'm from the south and I can't make a rolled out biscuit! My mama made them this way and it's the only way that I know how. After almost 20 years, I have definitely mastered this technique. The recipe is great too, but I usually just use self rising flour, omit the baking powder and salt, and use buttermilk. Truly a traditional southern biscuit!

Great basic recipe anybody can tweak. It uses basic ingredients and requires little time which is important in today's kitchen.

 Add sub. buttermilk instead of milk and add a bit of sugar.

 Four thumbs up here!

I have been hand-forming my dinner rolls since I came across this recipe a few months ago. I finally got to try the actual recipe---the biscuits were out of this world! My new fav. biscuit recipe. I love the hand-forming instead of rolling technique.  Thanks for the post!

Great biscuits! The only change we did was to drizzle melted butter over the biscuits after cooking them halfway.

Have been using Allrecipes since the start and rarely post anything but THIS WAS REALLY GOOD.  And so much easier than I thought biscuits had to be (no flour all over the counter, etc.).  The recipe came together in about 5 mintues.    Used beef dripping (lard) as I had it.  Bearing in mind the instructions, I really tried to make sure I didn't "overwork" the dough/batter and did leave it slight sticky.  Just squeezed up 9 larger biscuits, patted into rough rounds and left them to the oven.  They were barely gold on top when the bottoms were brown -- so watch out, they could get away from you.  But I found the recipe's timing to be accurate.  I put these with some stew I pulled out of the freezer, but would also be great for breakfast as they're so fast.  The texture is not so much flaky but very, very light and fluffy.
*****
Have since made this on a holiday visit with friends -- found out we didn't have any milk so substituted some watered down sour cream and that worked brilliantly.  This is so handy it'll have to be a keeper ... one of my "desert island recipes."

So far, I've tried six different recipes, four from this site, and this is the best home made biscuit recipe I've come across!  This one is simple, requires no sifting, and comes out with scrumptous biscuits that do great in the oven even after they've been frozen. I replaced the shortening with lighly salted butter, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I know I lack experience in the hand forming technique and I'm sure I kneaded them more then the recipe called for (I like to use up all my leftover flour or scraps into the dough which requires more kneading), but they still turned out wonderfully!   They're done when you get a lightly golden hue on the tops, about 10 min in my oven. A light flakey crust on top, and soft on the inside. To freeze, I simply put the individual uncooked biscuits in a freezer safe container or freezer ziplock with some syran wrap so they don't stick together, took them out when I needed them, allowed them to come to room temp (really important), put them on a baking pan with non stick spray, and cooked like normal in the oven according to recipe. When I make this again, I might try cutting the butter back to 1/3 c and see what that does to the recipe.
Happy baking!

Made with half butter and half shortening.  Melted 1T butter in a pie pan, then dipped biscuits in butter and placed in pan so edges were touching.  Came out tall, flaky, and fluffy in about 15 minutes.  Among the best biscuits I've ever had.

Yum!  We followed this as is, but we used 1% instead of whole because that was what we had on hand.  Easy to make and delicious to eat!

These were okay, but I prefer a self-rising flour recipe.  They were a bit crumbly and too hard on top.

these are awesome!  for the first time, I actually made biscuits to go with the stew, and they weren't rocks.  They were nice and fluffy and rose so high.  I've never had bisuits like these, I've only seen them.  but I think I am going to tweak it a bit next time and add maybe a little garlic powder and parm cheese and see what happens.  thanks GeorgiaCook1

This is the easiest tidiest biscuit recipe I've ever used and I love them.  I ended up eating way too many ;)  and everyone I shared them with agreed.  I ate them with a spicy stew with butter and then had them for dessert later with butter and blackberry preserves.  Both ways, amazing!  Thanks!

Great recipe, I used butter for the shortening and melted it, which is my sneaky trick for scones. Will try a version with dates, and a cheese and raisin one too.

I loved these.  These are not your trad. fluffy biscuits.  But these were great for biscuits and gravy.  This one is a keeper.  I think next time I do these I will brush the tops with a butter.  Thanks!!

Thank you!  Thank you! GeorgiaCook1!  I had reviewed over 100 biscuit recipes on Allrecipes.com in hope of finding a recipe that would be the hand-formed ones like my Mississippi grandmother made WELL over fifty years ago.  Well, dear lady, YOUR recipe was the one that got me to join AllRecipes.com -- I just had to let you know how much I appreciate your helping me resurrect this bygone preparation style for southern biscuits.  I'll make your biscuits for my Yankee hubby tonight!!  Janna in Germany

I was trying to find a recipe like the one my mom always made, and this is basically it except she used self rising flour and omitted the baking powder/salt. I’m new to making biscuits and still have some practicing to do lol bc mine were not as pretty as my moms. They weren’t horrible looking though. The two things I did different was 1) I used some expired milk (I was always taught that make great baking) and 2) I ended up having to come them about 3 min longer 
They were absolutely delicious though!

Great recipe!! This is especially nice when you have a time where your counter-space is limited. Especially during the Holidays and there are several people in the kitchen. Small tip reminder to less experienced cooks --when subbing Kosher or Sea Salt for regular table salt make sure to cut salt by half!

I've never rolled and cut biscuits, have always done it like this. Quick, easy, always turns out great. As others have suggested you can tweak them any number of ways.

Pretty good for a quick biscuit with not too complicated ingredients (stuff I had on hand).  I added a little oregano to the dough for some extra flavor.  Next time I may add a little more salt & spices.

This recipe is a staple of mine.  It is super simple, without a lot of ingredients or equipment needed.  Throw it together in less than a half hour to compliment any dinner or breakfast.  I live in Colorado, so I played around with the timer settings and temperature to get it to work in high altitude.  I set the temperature at 425F and baked them for 14 minutes to get them golden brown.  My family loved it.  Photo added.

My only complaint is that they didn't rise at all during baking.  Very good dipped in soup and slathered with jelly in the morning :)

Either I didn't do something right or ? These biscuits did not rise or look like the picture. Seemed very greasy from the shortening. I used butter flaver crisco

I liked the method-no pastry blender or roller needed! They cooked up great and tasted great, too. The only thing I changed was to use skim milk instead of whole because that's what I needed to use up-probably they'd taste even better with real milk :) I love how quick and easy this was-will definitely make again.

We loved these biscuits.  I used my food processor to mix and then kneaded lightly.  Because of altitude and humidity I used only 3/4 cup of milk and it all went together perfectly and easily.

I have seen the light and I'm never going back! :) These are so delicious. They look beautiful. It was so easy to make them. It really didn't take much more time than using a mix or making drop biscuits. We paired these with the Southern-Style Chocolate Gravy recipe from this site. Loved 'em! This will definitely be the recipe we use for biscuits in the future.

This is the easiest, yummiest, and most versatile biscuit recipe I have ever come across!  My family and friends all love these.  Plus I can play with the recipe and they always turn out yummy.  My favorite is to use whipping cream instead of the whole milk and then add herbs and cheese.  Rich, delicately flaky, and perfect for special occasions!

These are pretty good!  I used buttermilk and butter and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  Very easy to make.

Not the best biscuit, but gets 4 stars for technique & potential. I thought they tasted good with butter & honey, but were pretty bland. I used a stick of butter instead of shortening, but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time, I will try buttermilk & see if they turn out better. NOTE: Either the bake time is too long, or the oven too hot as these would be burnt in 11 minutes.

I've been eating biscuits in South Georgia for close to 70 years -- some good, some mediocre, many of them great. But never tasted any like these. Matter of fact, barely tasted these because they were close to tasteless. Sorry, because they were extremely easy to make. Might try them with buttermilk and see if that helps.

These are the best bicuits I've ever made. They're even better than the ones you buy in the refridgerated section of the supermarket. Thanks for the great recipe!

My teenagers asked for seconds and thirds.  Quick and easy, no rolling required.  I did cut the salt back to after reading other reviews.

Have been making these for 52 years since I was 12. Mother and Grandmother made these and my grandmother would flatten hers out with her knuckles and make them thin and call them cateyes. Delish. Nothing better with butter.

Tasty and easy but was not flaky. Might have been because I used butter. Had a nice salty crust and was very soft inside. Didn't keep track of time so some of them burnt on the bottom. Otherwise nice recipe.

These were good.  I didn't love them, but my husband thought they were a great change from my buttermilk biscuits.  Not as flaky as I thought they'd be.
