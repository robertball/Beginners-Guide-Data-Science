I am so glad you all are enjoying my recipe, but please do not complain if your soup doesn't turn out correctly b/c you used the wrong cheese... The proceesed cheese adds a creamy factor that cheddar doesn't have - please try the recipe (any recipe for that matter) first before you alter it...  thanks!!

Very good soup!  Per other reviewers, we added some extra potatoes and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Although extra potatoes were added, I think I'll even add some more (use 3 cups) and maybe an extra 1/2 carrots and celery.  We sprinkled some dried parsley overall!  Looked and tasted great!! Thanks Janet!

Thanks, Janet, your recipe just got me first place in our annual soup cook-off at work.  Got lots of raves!  I followed the recipe almost to the letter, but did use more potatoes than called for, and at the end I added a couple good dashes of cayenne pepper.  Must say that the cayenne really did wake up the flavors in this soup. Thanks again!

DELICIOUS!! I used grated cheddar instead of processed cheese and had to add a litte more milk.  I also added some cayenne after adding the cheese.

My husband enjoyed this soup but I really did not care for it. I thought that the Velveeta was very over powering and that was mostly all you could taste.

This is my new favorite soup.  It took a little time to prepare but it was sooooo worth it.  The second time I made it I did add 1/2 can whole kernel corn.  If your family likes corn the way we do you should try that as well.  ENJOY!

Great job, Janet! This is the best soup 
I've made in years, and I've made it several
times. I double the potatoes and the soy sauce,
increase the other veggies by 1/2 cup or so,
and make it truly lowfat by using skim 
milk and Velveeta Light. I've also ended up spreading
the recipe around my office, once they smelled 
what was coming from my cubicle! Great soup!

Excellent recipe! I used more potato and added corn as suggested by some.I don't usually cook with velveeta but it really does make this soup rich and creamy. It's good with cheddar- I've made it both ways,but even if you don't usually use processed cheese-just try it and you'll see how good it is. Will continue to use and enjoy. Very easy, too! Thanks for giving us this great dependable recipe!
Added comment 10/7/15 I've been using this recipe for 6 years now and still love it! I usually omit the chicken and add corn for a meatless meal/ vegetarian friends. Just finished a bowl so had to add this additional comment!!

This was a wonderful "snowy day" soup, hearty enough for my husband, flavorful enough for me, and healthy enough to feed my children.  I might even add some corn next time.  I also roasted a whole chicken and used that in the soup as opposed to using boneless, skinless... much more flavorful.

This was delicious!  I didn't have any celery, so I substituted a can of cream of celery soup.  Everyone in my family really liked it.  My oldest child ate four bowls!

This was absolutely delicous, thank you for the recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added more potatoes, about 3 and a half cups...we're a potato family!  Nice and creamy and very filling on a chilly day- serve with some toasted crusty bread, mmm-mmmm!!

I made this one chilly weekend and we loved it!  Even my two very young grandchildren enjoyed it.  It's a "keeper" at our house.

I made this for dinner tonight & both my husband & I really enoyed it. I diced up some mushrooms & broccoli because I didn't have any carrots & I don't like celery... it came out really yummy! Perfect for this cold rainy night. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good, the whole family liked it. I added a dash of cayenne pepper, just to give it a little spice, nothing crazy. I also topped mine with some diced tomato, just for the heck of it. Will make again.

Yummy!  Mine was a little "soupy".  Cannot tell if it was the cheese or the milk that did not quite meld as it should have.  I assume it was because I used 1% milk instead of whole and butter instead of margarine; it was what I had so that is what I used.  All-in-all, a very good and easy recipe.

FANTASTIC!!!! This is such a good soup! I made it exactly as directed (besides adding more potatoes)...next time I will omit celery (you couldn't taste it anyway) and I may try adding tomatoes and green peppers. I also added lots of pepper at end and some red pepper....can't wait to take this to football parties!!!

Excellent! My husband and I loved it.

Changes from original:  I did the extra potatoes as suggested (3 cups), added salt, pepper, and italian seasoning

Next time: I am going to fry and shred bacon, add garlic, add more peper and seasoning

Time Savers: I bought pre-chopped onions and carrots.

Found this to be just average tasting.  There are MUCH better cheese soup recipes to be found on this site.  Will not be making this one again.  Maybe it was the Velveeta, most cheese soups that i have made & enjoyed have used cheddar.

Loved this!  I added a clove of garlic and cooked the vegetables in the butter.  I used leftover herb and garlic marinated chicken breasts and added some minced jalapeno pepper slices along with a dash of cayenne for some kick.  This is a keeper.

This was good but we found it really rich and heavy.  This would be a good side dish or appetizer.  We felt so full after just a small bowl.  Good but I don't think I will make it again.  Just my opinion, you try it and see what you think. M.keddie

I really liked this recipe! I added corn to the vegetable list also just because I love it in soup. I didn't have any velvetta, but I did have a box of organic macaroni and cheese (not the powder cheese)so I just added the package of cheese it came with and then added regular shredded cheese.  It worked out great.  Sometimes you just have to substitute things because you don't have everything on hand.  I didn't have enough milk either, so another sub was half almond milk and half 1% milk.  Family thought it was great and will be making this again!

I used this recipe as a base - so to speak – I had a breast of left over garlic chicken from a earlier meal -recently a lot of cheddar cheese was on sale,  I got more than enough! So I used cheddar – my family love garlic – so first I cooked garlic with butter and olive oil (instead of margarine) – added celery – then added flour making a roué – then added the broth and milk and used what was on hand in the freezer of frozen vegetables – also cut some sweet red pepper and green onions. Someone with reviews added cayenne in theirs so – I did also, not much as my soon to be daughter in law is not the fan of spicy as my sons are! This turned out fine – I was glad to have a recipe to work off of – thanks

Excellent recipe.  It doesn't freeze well, but that was not too much of a problem to eat it all week! Rave reviews with my son.  I used real cheese rather than processed cheese.  Very yummy!

I am terrible with remembering to get dinner started on time, and so I came onto allrecipes all in a fluster with only one meat option. Canned chicken I had on hand. This recipe did not let me or my family down. It was absolutely delicious. I did not put celery in it as I didn't have any. But it would have been even better with it. What an easy quick comforting dinner this was! Thankyou!

Excellent recipe.  I have made this for many years.  I do add 1 cup corn and do saute the veggies a bit in butter/olive oil, sea salt and pepper, and while cooking the veggies, omit the soy sauce and add 1 tablespoon of McCormick's curry powder; then saute the veggies until the onions are translucent.

Super good soup and easily customizeable, which I love. I had some leftover green beans--tossed them in. Used corn as some here have suggested. Used cheddar--and only about 8 ounces instead of the pound of processed. Used skim milk. Added some chipotle pepper and some habanero sauce--just enough for a zip. Also added some parsley, a tablespoon of sugar, and a sprinkling of Lawry's seasoning salt. First rate.

This turned out great! And - to be fair - I *almost* completely stuck to the original recipe! My only alterations were to 1) add a tsp or two of garlic, 2) add a cup or so of frozen corn kernels, and 3) omit the chicken, as I was putting chicken in the accompanying salad! 4 out of 5 in my family really liked it, with the exception being my 11yr old son whose religion prohibits him from eating vegetables ;^) Even my wife, not really a soup person, enjoyed it, and my 16yr old son had four bowls! The processed cheese really makes it creamy (at the expense of your health, but...). Great stuff!

It's delicious! I added twice the potatoes, used organic chicken broth, and grilled the onions with bacon grease and minced garlic. I also did not use processed cheese but I shredded a bunch of cheddar cheese and it turned out great.

I have been using this recipe for a few years now, and it's a family favorite! SO delicious! I use rotisserie chicken to help save time, and almost double the veggies. Next time I will try adding corn and cayenne pepper.

This recipe is good.  I have made it twice now, the first time using processed cheese, the second using sharp cheddar. I prefer about 1/4 to 1/2 lb of sharp cheddar, to keep the cheese from overpowering the soup.

This was good! I used leftover chicken from a roast I made the day before. I also used cheddar cheese, which I grated and added to the roux (flour, butter, milk mixture) before incorporating into the vegetables and broth. The soup is creamy and delicious!

This chowder was a hit with the family.  Easy to prepare.  I made my own chicken stock by boiling the chicken meat first.  Removed the chicken and threw in the vegies.  I added brocolli to the mix and used sweet potato.  Came out great.  I topped this meal off with savoury bacon scones.

This was a good comfort food to make for my daughter who is feeling under the weather. I didn't have carrots or celery on hand, so I subbed corn and canned green beans. I did not make the white sauce, just used the processed cheese, and I forgot to add the soy sauce. Before serving I sampled it & added a little salsa to spice it up. Delicious, even with my changes!

Just finished dinner and "WOW"!!! It was fantastic!! My six year old even loved it. The only thing I added was Garlic a can of corn and corn bread. Instead of chicken, next time I'll use clams, shrimp, crab meat, and mushrooms. I'll let you know how it turns out.

This was delicious  with my few changes. I made it but substituted a few items.  I did not use Velveeta only two different types of cheese, Sharp Cheddar and Colby jack.  I also added some Herbs de Provence, a little salt and white pepper.  Since I did not use the cheese that would have had the salt etc.

I will made it again.

I made it with shredded cheddar cheese because that is what I had.  My family loved it.  I doubled the potatoes and added a can of corn because my family loves corn.

This was amazing! I doubled the potatoes, omitted the celery and added salt and a little cayenne, and I won a chowder cook off!

probably would make a little thinner and would add corn.  Second day was a little thick, maybe add some broth for leftovers.

Tastes very good.  I used organic baby carrots I had frozen and canned potatoes I had and put them in for the last 5 minutes of cooking the celery and onions.  I followed a recipe online for how to thicken almond milk and used that and rice flour instead of flour and milk.  I believe I have a slight milk allergy that gets worse as I get older.  I also used 3/4 of the Velveeta called for to cut some calories. It took me awhile but the end result was very good!

I've been making this for years, and it's a family favorite.  Sometimes I substitute diced ham for the chicken, and that works great, too.  Have not tried it with soy sauce, I'll have to remember that for next time.  Extra good with bacon bits crumbled on top and a side of crusty, toasted homemade bread.

This was very good. I used cooked boneless chicken thighs because that was what I had. I only used 1/2 the cheese called for and it was enjoyed by all. True it is not a spicy dish. Not everything has to be. Adding a little cracked black pepper or Tabisco will pump up the heat, if that is what you want.

I use half regular velveta and half spicy velveta and I also add a small can of green chillies.  I've made this soup twice and it's amazing.

I used a site where you can input ingredients and they give you suggestions on what to make and it said Chicken Cheesy Chowder. So I came to this site to look up the best recipe and I found yours. It took some time because I like to let soups and chowder cook longer cause they taste better. And OMG it came out amazing, I also gave some to my neighbor and she said that it tasted better than even restaurants could make. Thank you so much!

Made this today exactly as written....not great!  Pretty bland as a few others mentioned.  Put in a bunch of fresh black pepper and added some green onions and fresh parsley on top to try to help it a bit.  DH doesn't like hot sauce but I put some in mine....still not so good.  Oh well, to each his own!  I won't bother to put this in my recipe box.

We loved it, I doubled the recipe, added 3 cups of potatoes and I mix and match the cheese to whatever we like.    I love the creaminess that I make enough for a week.  I also add other veggies like corn, green beans, etc.

I made this for my boys using rice flour and soy milk and I don't think those substitutions hurt the flavour at all! They slurped it up and asked for some in their school lunches the next day. Safe to say it was a hit and I'll be making this again.  Also, a note: I have found that Canadian Velveeta is sponger than the American version but melts really nicely in this recipe nonetheless.

This was very yummy and simple to make, and perfect on a cold and blustery day with a fresh loaf of bread. I added a can of corn and some rough chopped carrots.

A bit time consuming to put together, but really tasty - creamy and filling. I use a rotisserie chicken to save time and add a can of corn.  It makes quite a large amount so we have leftovers for lunch for a couple of days.

This is some good chowder! Takes some time to get it to thicken up but was worth it. Be careful not to let it scorch.
Doubled the recipe to start with.
Removed the onion (one of my guests was allergic) and replaced it with 2 cans of white and golden corn.
I like my chowder thick so i actually ended up adding 2 whole blocks of Velveeta. Will make again.

I omitted carrots and the potato but added some green pepper and some garlic (I add garlic to eveything!). I did use cheddar cheese as I don't like processed cheese. I added just a touch of 1/2 and 1/2 maybe a 1/4 cup and a pinch of cayenne. But the basic idea was the same and it was fantastic.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I love adding more potatoes for a thicker chowder but I definitely recommend this for a cold day or hearty meal that your family can enjoy over and over again. :)

Wonderful recipe!  My husband doesn't typically care for soup but loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly, except added corn.  However, take note when you make the flour mixture, it says to use a "medium saucepan."  I used a small one and it boiled over and left a huge mess.  Not fun to clean up!

I wish this would've been a little thicker, but I think it's just my lack of cooking skills when it comes to flour.  The taste overall, was great! I added about a cup of frozen corn and used frozen cubed hash browns for the potatoes.  Will definately make again!

I, and my family loved it!  I traded a bit of the veleeta for sharp cheddar.  I also didn't let the milk boil, it will curdle if you do that.  I just let it get nice and thick.  I also bumped up the potatoes and carrots like someone else suggested.  Yummy!

This was outstanding!! Thank you, Janet! I made a couple changes though. 1) used American cheese, just under a pound, 2) added cheese to the milk mixture until melted than added that to the veggie mix, 3) omitted the soy sauce and used 2-3 good splashes of white wine and 3-4 good shakes of worchestershire sauce. Oh and I shredded the carrots instead of diced. Served with warm, crusty bread and it was perfect!

This was a wonderful chowder to have on a cold day!  It warmed the soul!  I followed the recipe except I double the potatoes and cooked chorizo (1/8c) with my chicken to add a little spice.  Then towards the end of warming I added a few dashes of cumin and parsley!  Will definitely make again!!!

Maybe my expectations were too high after all of the rave reviews but I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I made it just as written (only subbing butter for margerine and real cheese for "processed").  Maybe those subtle changes were enough.  It was way too runny to be considered a "chowder" and needed some last minute spice additions due to being bland.  Nobody was wowed by this, not even my son and me who should be regulars at Cheese Eaters Anonymous.  Won't be making it again.

This was really tasty.  I did add some frozen whole kernel corn as well as a can of creamed corn as some had suggested.  I also added some Tony's seasoning and cayenne pepper.  I served with hot sauce and hot buttery cornbread!  Delicious!

Great recipe!  I went exactly by the recipe except for a few additions of ground red pepper and Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic, which is a tasty addition to your recipes.  This is a great soup for the fall weather.  I'm planning on taking it to our church's Hayride and Chili Supper.  I believe they're gonna enjoy it!!!

This chowder had great flavor. I served it with some Mexican corn bread and it was a great hit.

Add about 8 oz of corn and you have the best chicken corn chowder I've ever had.  It's much, much better than any you can find at the store.  I did also add a dash of thyme, but other than the thyme and the corn, followed the recipe as is.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good, can be a vegetable soup too. I followed other suggestions and use more potato. I used chicken tenderloins which were great for this recipe. I spiced up the chicken with black and red pepper which added a good taste to the chowder. I will absolutely make again!

The velveeta taste was so overwhelming that we couldn't enjoy the chicken or vegetables.  Tasted flat and greasy.  Expensive and time consuming to make.  It did make a lot, and I'm guessing would be a huge hit with kids.

I used leftover roasted chicken, potatoes and carrots. This was a great way to use my leftovers plus it tasted great!

Great recipe! After the first try I made it with a combination of pepper jack and swiss cheeses. I also used twice as many potatoes. Overall, it's a great base recipe!

Yum! Yum! This is a great soup, thick and cheesey.  The only thing I changed is I like my celery and onion sauteed. Will make it again.

I loved this soup, however, I made some adjustments since we are trying to watch our weight.  I used the "light" version of processed cheese, half the amount of butter to make the roux, and skim milk.  It tasted fabulous!

Just finished eating this chowder for dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I did add brocoli and the extra potatoes, but other than that, did not change a thing.  It was absolutely wonderful.

Great soup! I didn't have chicken, so I reduced the liquid amounts. We didn't have to add salt or pepper. I recommend this recipe!

This is a great, hearty chowder.  A slight adjustment I made was to cook the onion in the melted butter (no margarine :-() until soft before adding the flour.  I also added 2 C frozen corn
before adding the roux to the veggies.

I was looking for a recipe to use up chicken from a previous dinner, and I had all these items on hand.  Delicious!! It was a bit time consuming, but well worth it.

This was so good!  I made more than the 5 servings. It was a little thinner than I wanted. I will try more flour next time. Great flavor!

For some reason this soup did not turn out as thick as I had hoped.  However my husband enjoyed it a lot anyway.  I did use cheddar cheese instead of the processed stuff, and added a little parmesan as well.  I used worcestershire sauce instead of soy.  This is a recipe I will probably experiment with again.
