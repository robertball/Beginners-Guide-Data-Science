Quick, easy, okay. The chili, because of the veggies, had a fresh taste even with the canned ingredients, but it was a bit too spicy. If I make this again, I will use 1/4 t ground red pepper.

Worked the Super Bowl this year and made this chili to bring with me to work. Everyone LOVED it. Has a kick but not too bad. I used black beans instead of the Ranch style beans. Came out delicous! Definitly will make again

This recipe is genius. Followed it exactly except I added 1 teaspoon of salt. It was delicious, with minimal effort and I'm glad I sprayed with Pam as recommended because it made for even less cleanup.  Family loved it.

This was really good chili! The only thing was that I cooked it for 2 hours and 25 minutes on high, 25 minutes longer then it called for and the carrots were still pretty raw. I will make this again because the flavor was good, I will just cook for longer.

Wonderful! Alike another viewer I used canned black beans (did not drain/rinse). I also added veggie ground. In a pinch would also work as a chunky salsa dip with tortilla chips.

Very hearty and filling; not mind-blowing, but it was very easy. Maybe tone down the red pepper if you can't take too much spiciness, but I thought it was just right in that regard. A liked it with a dollop of sour cream in the bowl.

Very good recipe, I followed it exactly except I didn't add carrots because I don't like them. It was a bit spicy so if you don't like your chili too spicy you may want to cut down on the red pepper.

I can barely cook, but this was super easy and very tasty. I made it last year for a Halloween party, and everyone loved it. I ate the leftovers for lunch for about a week after the party, and it was still delicious. I followed other people's suggestion to use black beans instead of ranch beans (still don't know what those are) and to put in less red pepper and chili powder. I have a sensitive stomach, so I left out the bell pepper, but it was still good, not bland at all.

Wow this was pretty good!!
I took some of the other reviews into consideration (as I always do) and substituted the ranch style beans for black beans.
I also used crushed red pepper flakes which my family love in pretty much everything!!
I did make this with less spices than recommended and then added as it cooked to suit my families tastes.
Freezes really well  - I will defintely be making this again it's way cheaper than the tinned veggie chillli and much better for you!!
