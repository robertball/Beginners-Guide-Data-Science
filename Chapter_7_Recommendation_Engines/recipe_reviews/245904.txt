Next time (and yes, there WILL be a next time), I'll use less Italian seasoning, less salt, and a lot more pear. I couldn't taste the pears at all. I have a feeling with these changes it'll be 5 stars. UPDATE: I made this again, this time quadrupling the pears and cutting the salt and Italian Seasoning in half. The pear taste was strong, but it was still bland. I think next time, I will double the pears and add a splash of balsamic to the pears before putting them in the mix.
