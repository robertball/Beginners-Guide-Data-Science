These were fabulous! I had a little trouble getting my breadsticks as thin as I wanted, but if you roll them, let them rest, and then roll again, you should be able to get to the desired thinness. 

For a dipping sauce, simmer 10 oz of tomato sauce, 1 t Italian seasoning, 2 t oregano, and 1 t garlic powder for 20 minutes. They'll pair fabulously!

OMG these are delicious... Great mix of ingrediants.  I made my breadsticks alittle different though, i rolled the bread dough out kinda like papa johns does. Scored the dough to make strips but kept them together and poured the butter on top and then the cheese mixture.  As they baked to poked them with a fork so they wouldn't rise too much and when the bottom was done broiled them until the cheese was nice and brown.  So so good!!

Thank you Taste of Home test kitchen!  This recipe is so very, very good, especially in light of the little energy I invested in making them.  I was looking for something easy and fairly quick to go with the Italian meal I was preparing and this recipe was just what I needed.  Quick thawed the frozen bread dough in an hour and a half on the backyard picnic table and followed the recipe as written.  (It was 95 degrees out and I put it in a sealed plastic bag.) Husband loves them too.  Will definitely make again and again.

I made a couple additions to this recipe the last time I made it and it turned out very nice so I decided to share. All the seasonings were the same. I didn't have time for the loaf that I bought to thaw out and rise so I went back to the store and grabbed some can crescent rolls. I pinched the perforated edges so the dough would be rectangular rather than the standard triangles. After pinching the dough together I placed small slices of cheddar on the inside and rolled the dough up to form a garlic bread stick (make sure that all edges and openings are pinched closed). I then dunked the sticks in the melted butter and rolled them in the cheese and seasoning mixture. Also, the parmesan cheese that I used was not out of a can. It was premium real parmesan and great cheese always makes a difference when you're cooking a recipe that calls for cheese. I placed them on a greased cookie sheet and threw them in the oven. We ate them with spaghetti and a side Cesar salad. My husband and the children devoured them! They loved the melted cheese that surprised them when they bit into the bread. It was a total hit! Thanks for the great recipe!! :o)

I made these even easier by using "take and bake" type breadsticks.  I just dipped them in butter, then the cheese mixture and baked for the recommended time on the package.  Easy and delicious!  Perfect to serve with pasta.

Wonderful!  Like another reviewer, I just took my pizza dough (I used homemade, not frozen), shaped it into a rectangle, scored it into sticks, brushed on melted butter, and shook on the toppings I wanted ... talk about yummy!  I had left over pizza sauce, and we used it to dip ... delish!  Oh, I made them again last night, and I used olive oil instead of butter ... great!  Thanks!

Made my own bread with bread flour AND gluten, so extra light.  Then molded into ropes.  Melted butter and crushed two cloves of garlic. Then added onion powder and brushed on the breadsticks after they rose.  Sprinkled spice packets from Lil Caesar's and Parmesan cheese on top. Also made similar version with healthier ingredients (whole wheat flour, oat bran, and flax seed meal).  Followed same recipe. Divine. A keeper.

Very easy and tasty!  I cooked 1 pan (8 sticks) for 10 minutes and the other pan for 12 minutes. Very different flavors! I like them lighter, while my husband likes them a bit crispier!

I kind of cheated a bit and didn't use the frozen bread dough.  Last Valentine's Day I had made individual heart-shaped pizzas for my family, and I used the extra pizza dough.  They were awesome!  I had too much cheese topping, so I used the rest as my "cheese" on my pizza, and that was great also!

This is a good quick recipe if you need breadsticks in a pinch. I used thawed buttermilk biscuits because that is what I had on hand but they turned out good :-)

I had fun with these.  Great tasting and good looking too - a big payoff for relatively little effort. Since this was just for Hubs and me, I improvised a little, using frozen Texas-size dinner rolls rather than the one pound loaf of bread dough.

Good!  I also rolled them out and let them rise again before deeping them in the butter/cheese.

I used a can of Pillsbury dinner rolls and followed the directions except I didn't use the cheddar.  These were so yummy with spaghetti.

I make these all the time and everyone loves them, I do more butter to drizzle on top also before baking. These deserve to be a little sinful pleasure!

I used this on store-bought pizza dough and just shaped it into a rectangle and spread out all of the ingredients on top.  Then I just sliced the dough when it was done (Like Papa John's) and my boyfriend loved them!  They came out excellent!

What a great recipe!  By some great miracle I remembered to take bread dough out last night and today I'm about to make these breadsticks for the second time.  Full of flavor, versatile and easy to make!  (The first batch I made I added some sea salt to the spice/cheese mixture...my husband picked the salt off because he found them too salty, ha ha, but his co-workers loved them, as is, and so did I.)  The possibilities are endless for this recipe, use what you have on hand or what will compliment the main dish you are serving these with.  I'll be making these over and over!  (Today I am going to mince a generous amount fresh garlic to add to the cheese mixture and ALOT of freshly ground pepper!)

Very good recipe! I served them with pizza sauce since that's all I had on hand and they went well together. The only thing I did differently was I baked it at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes. I didn't feel very comfortable putting them in at a higher temp. I will definitely make these over and over again!

This is a great recipe. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of thyme and 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary instead of the Italian seasoning due to the dish these were to compliment. I big hit with everyone of all ages.

Made along with some pizza for some friends coming over for dinner.  Everyone liked them.  I did use double the toppings when I made it (the breadsticks just took that much when I rolled them).

This recipe is very easy and the bread sticks are very good.
