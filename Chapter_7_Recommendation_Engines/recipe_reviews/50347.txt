This was my first time venturing into the world of Indian cooking. 

What an easy, wonderful, tasty meal. I followed the recipe and some of the reviewers suggestions. I used non-fat yogurt and the food coloring. I did add the cilantro to the marinade, in addition to putting it on after. 

I marinated it for the 24 hours and it was PERFECT. Spicy and flavorful. I will be making this MANY times and hope to share it with all my friends.

Updated: I make this about twice a month. I make 16 chicken thighs and freeze them for when I want some of this tasty meat. I also bake this at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes.

This was the best, most flavorful chicken tandoori I have ever made.

I used skinless breasts on the bone, marinated them for 24 hours, and broiled them for 10-12 minutes on each side.

This version is perfectly edible but pales, in MY opinion, when compared to Tandoori chicken generally available. I suspect that this may be the result of cooking at too low a temperature. A Tandoor is an Indian clay oven, where the temperatures regularly reach levels far hotter than the standard kitchen oven. I tried this recipe as specified and was disappointed, and I have given 3 stars as a result. I then cooked it at a much higher temperature, which resulted in a better consistency but dried it out too much. I finally slightly increased all the quantities of spices and yoghurt and cooked that on the highest heat I could, and found THAT would have rated 4.5 stars. So the spice combination is good, the principle is good, the cooking is not. I strongly reiterate that this is MY opinion. I also have a vague problem with using food colouring. By using Turmeric, you can get a good yellow colour without needing the artificiality of colouring, and tomato pur√©e (or harissa if you like heat) can add a reddish tinge.

My husband is from Pakistan and he loved this recipe!  It was VERY easy and delicious!  As a matter of fact, it was the best Tandoori chicken I've had anywhere.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they were very moist and tasty.  For dessert, try Simmi's Kulfi recipe.

Excellent recipe! Used boneless skinless chicken thighs that I put on kabobs. Don't like food coloring? Use some colorful spices instead. I used some turmeric and some paprika to give it a brilliant orange color! The taste was the same.

Excellent and easy. I let the chicken breasts marinate for a day to give full flavor. I also left out the food colorings, and my guests laughed when we initially looked at the chicken..it was the craziest shade of pink/coral that I've ever seen. But it still looks like the chicken I'd get at my local Indian restaurant. Everyone loved it. I paired it with basmati rice, coconut-curry sauce, steamed vegetables, and naan. It really tasted authentic!

Thank you very much for this recipe! I marinaded it for 24 hours, scraped off all the marinade , and then cooked in my Romertopf clay pot for about 45 minutes at 480deg. The chicken came out perfect. I almost didn't add the food coloring, but I'm glad I did because the finished product looked exactly like what it looks like in restaurants. My husband declared it a success. I'll be making this again and again.

I woul prefer not to give this dish any star value because I was unable to follow the recipe as stated. As I made it I didn't like it, but I will try it again. Here's what went wrong: 1- Absolutely use the food colouring...unless you want to eat pink chicken. 2- Do use a grill.  It was waaaay too cold to go outside and grill, so I did cooked the chicken with marinade in a pan (like a stir-fry). I am positive the grilled flavour is far superior. 3-I could not find garam masala. I'm sure I have seen it before, but just when i needed it I couldn't find it. So instead I used a tandoori paste along with all the other ingredients. Wasn't that great...  I will definetly try this again.

This was great!  I baked it in the oven at 350 for about an hour and a half.  I was pressed for time, so I didn't remove the skin first.  I wish I had because when you remove the skin after cooking, it takes away all the flavor!  I will definitely make this again though.  The dish went nicely with "Indian Dahl and Spinach" from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVED this recipe!   And, it was SO very easy.  I used chicken breasts AND thighs.   Make sure you follow the instructions on marinating - I think this is key to making it super moist.  Also, I baked mine, and made sure to keep draining off the chicken liquid that baked out.  Then, at the end, I broiled the pieces just to make it more like they were grilled....  I love spicy foods, so I added quite a bit extra cayenne.   But that's me - I wouldn't recommend if you don't like HOT HOT HOT.   All in all, a great and super easy recipe!  Loved it!

I thought this was pretty good! I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (close to 2 lbs), used onion powder instead of onion (due to allergy) and skipped the cilantro (accidently). I marinaded for about 18 hours in the fridge, then threw the whole thing, marinade and all, into a 350 oven for about 45 minutes (uncovered). The chicken came out juicy and bursting with flavor. Next time I try this (and there will most definitely be a next time) I'm going to cube the chicken and maybe cook it on the grill, kabob style. I agree with the others that said the grill might add a smoky flavor that would work great with this dish, but it was just too hot to grill today. I can't guarantee the taste is authentic (the onion allergy prevents me from eating this when I'm out), but I can say it's pretty darn good! Thanks!

In the event you can't find garam masala, I used a quick recipe from Allrecipes that works well.  Whole spices are best, but this is easy and quick:
1T ground cumin
1 1/2 t each ground coriander, cardamom, black pepper
1 t ground cinnamon
1/2 t ground cloves
1/2 t ground nutmeg

Beautiful recipe! I grilled it, like the recipe says,  and it came out perfect! To 'Ani',  that is the most ignorant review I've ever read. There is nothing remotely hard to follow in this recipe. Even worse, the author gave you the alternate cooking method and YET you chose to do it your own way instead. Therefore, the only person to blame for your dissatisfaction, is yourself.

Yellow food coloring = turmeric
Red food coloring = paprika
For the life of me I just can't use food coloring as an ingredient. Every ingredient should contribute towards the flavor. I think you will find that paprika and turmeric are a welcome addition to Tandoori Chicken besides providing a nice color.

Five stars! Delicious & authentic.  I used four large boneless skinless chicken breasts & marinated them for 24 hours prior to grilling them.  I made the garam masala using the recipe found on this site, and I omitted the cilantro.  Squeezed fresh lemon wedges over the meat after it finished grilling.  We had nothing left over - even my kids loved this!  Served it with couscous and asparagus for a tasty Sunday night dinner.  Highly recommended.

Honestly I did a lot to deviate from the recipe because I was short on time and thought they would turn out horrible for sure, but they turned out FANTASTIC so I can only imagine what sticking to the recipe would taste like. 

I didn't have food coloring so I used paprika mixed with tomato paste for red and tumeric for yellow. 

I didn't have time to marinade them for a day so they sat for about 2 hours (still PLENTY flavorful) 

I was making a loooooooot of chicken and didn't have the time to grill so I stuck them in a pan, drizzle of oil, and popped them in the oven. 

Let me tell you, these were succulent, BURSTING with flavor, and perfection. 

Advice though: try to get some of the yogurt off before you cook because it sort of coagulates, but still lovely even if you don't.

Made this for my parents along with coconut rice & spinach salad.  Baked my chicken (used thighs) in theoven at 400¬∞, poured off the liquid, sprinkled with fresh cilantro & finished under the broiler.  Used fat free yogurt too and left out the food coloring.  Delicious.  They loved it.

This was yummy!  I did make a few slight changes based on prior reviews.  I used a 2 lb. whole chicken that I broke down into pieces.  The onion I grated.  Same with the ginger.  In place of the garam masala I used 2 tsp. of Tandoori Seasoning from Penzeys.  I omitted the cayenne pepper, which I won't do the next time.  It needs the spice and puch.  I think 1/2 tsp. would be fine for our tastes.  I also didn't use the food coloring or the cilantro.  I grilled this on the BBQ (It was 35 degrees outside.) and it came out fantastic!!!!  Served with saffron rice and fresh steamed asparagus.  Nothing was left at the end of the meal.  Compliments to the original poster, as this is definately a keeper!

This recipe tastes amazing and is simpler than it looks to make.  I use prepackaged chicken thighs which are just the right moisture and thickness to grill up well.  The flavors are subtle in the marinade but come through nicely when cooked.  Be sure to use a higher grill temp to get the crispy outside texture.  It makes the grill messy but is outstanding.  It is also great for leftovers.  Family favorite.

Very good! A friend recommended this to me because of my love of indian food, but I've never dared make it. I cut chicken breasts into small pieces and let it marinade for 24 hours. The color seems kind of scary before its cooked, but don't be alarmed. I put on skewers and put on BBQ, and the taste was delicious! Served with Samosas, Naan, rice, and cilantro chutney from a local farmers market. I'll definately make again.

Very good, I baked this instead of grilling and it turned out good.  I put the pieces of chicken in a salad with onions, tomatoes and some ranch dressing -- similar to Cosi's Bombay salad.  It tasted similar and very good.

This recipe is wonderful, but I found a way to leave the skin on. When putting the chicken in, to marinade, lift the skin and put the mixture under the skin as well as the outside. When you remove it from the grill, the chicken and the skin, both, have great taste!! Also, if you have a local city market, like we do in Kansas City, use Tandoori seasoning to give it the color and leave out the food coloring. It makes a huge differene.

This chicken came out phenomenal! I baked it in the oven on 450 for 30 minutes. I omitted the food coloring, too. It was tender and moist and bursting with flavor. I added extra cayenne because I like things spicy. Very enjoyable!

The fact that red and yellow food colouring are used in place of "Tandoori Masala" should be enough to demote this dish of the title "Indian Tandoori Chicken".
This is an offense to a classic Indian dish and my taste buds.

I made this recipe as written and used boneless skinless chicken thighs. The result was awesome, I will make this again. It went well with the 'Indian-Style Rice with Cashews, Raisins and Turmeric' recipe from this site.

My first time making tandoori chicken. It was easy to make and tasted great...my Indian in-laws didn't even know it was tandoori chicken though...they said there wasntenough spices.next timeiwill marinate longer (I only had a few hours this time). If marinating longer still doesn't work then I will increase the spices.

Hubby and I loved this dish. Our five teens have regularly enjoyed food from other cultures since they were babes. I was surprised they collectively gave it a thumbs down. Chicken was moist and beautiful to look at. I followed recipe as written.
Update = I whipped up an apricot dipping sauce for the leftover chicken since kids wouldn't eat it as is. Served it to them after school with rice and got rave reviews. The sweet sauce perfectly complimented the Tandoori chicken.

This was very, very good. I had to adjust down the cayenne pepper for my kids, but the garam marsala gives the yogurt great flavor. I broiled the chicken instead of grilling (after marinating for roughly 18 hours). I served this with basmati rice and curried cauliflower. Also, I did use a little food coloring paste (orange left over from decorating Halloween sugar cookies) but you could also probably get similar results from using paprika/tumeric.

This chicken is good, but I wouldn't call it tandoori chicken at all-it's missing that outer crust that makes it so distinctive. The marinade had great flavor though so if I'm in the mood for Indian-flavored chicken, this is the recipe I'll use.

Marinated overnight and used chicken breast (all I had in house) and broiled.  Turned out great.  The only change I would make to the recipe would be to use turmeric, and more cayenne for color and heat.  I would also use more gara masla next time. and not use the dye's, though i followed the recipe as written and the color was very good with the dye's.

Excellent! We made this for supper yesterday and I kept going back for more. I used only chicken thighs because they always come out so moist - even when grilled. Thanks for the recipe - I've been looking for a good Tandoori Chicken recipe for a long time.

This was great. I used the garam masala recipe & made my own. I could only find a huge pkg. @ my local grocery store. Definitely let it marinade for 24+ hours. My family thought it was great & my brother called it gourmet. I didn't use the food coloring. Wish I could've grilled it but it was cold (35) & windy. But it browned up nicely in the oven.  Wasn't sure about cayenne pepper but wish I would've used it. I think it could use the extra kick. Otherwise really good. Thanks.

Having gotten tired  of standard grilled chicken and having yogurt in my frig (for once in my life) I tried this dish and  it has become one of our favorites.  The flavor is fantastic.  Slice it up and serve on a mediterranean buffet table and you have a wonderful party dish.

Very good! I didn't add the food coloring as I'm not big on coloring my food. I also added some 1/2tsp ground turmeric, 1/2tsp paprika, 1tsp cumin. I used greek yogurt instead because I like that its less watery then normal yogurt. I marinated the chicken and then used cooked it following the tikka masala recipe for the sauce. Excellent!

I have just started to experiment with Indian spices and cooking and I must say this recipe has so much flavor. The yogurt makes this chicken so moist and the Garam Masala spice is what makes this dish for me!

Its a good recipe, we ate it but it wasn't a favorite.  I think the quality of your garam masala would greatly effect the finished dish.

Delicious and easy, would definitely make it again.  Like others, I skipped the food coloring, but the family complained that it didn't look right, although it tasted great.  I marinated for 6 hours.

We loved this recipe!  I was unable to find garam masala locally and used a recipe from this site to make it.  My picky husband was pretty sure he'd hate this being that it had marinated overnight in yogurt and seasonings.  But we BOTH thought it was wonderful!  I used chicken breasts with rib bones and grilled after marinating overnight.

This was delicious, despite my changes.... My review is for those that likes to alter the recipe for whatever reason... Well first, I used turkey tenderloins ( just what I had in freezer), I didn't use any food coloring ( didn't want to add artificial stuff ), and I sauteed half in pan, and broiled the other half ( to compare the taste). My conclusions is...using turkey was just as tender ( I marinated for 24 hours), Flavor was great but didn't look authentic because no food coloring, I would use food coloring next time. Definitely try to grill it for the smokey flavor next time because sauteed version was good ( better than the broiled) because of the caramelization. But for true Tandoori flavor, grilled would be soooo much better. I will try it again.... Flavor was very good !

Very Good and so moist!  I cut the chicken into strips to skewer on the grill before marinating which helped the marinating process along.  I cut everything up into the marinade in the morning, and by 6pm it was ready to grill.  I made this chicken with foil packs of veggies coated in dijon mustard, cumin, garlic, ginger, and vinigar and made a cuccumber salad with mint for a side.  So good and great for planning ahead for an afternoon party!

I marinated this for about 20 hours. The color is beautiful if you use the food coloring. I was rather disappointed with the flavor though! I thought with all the spices and letting it sit for so long it would have a lot more flavor. I served this with cholay and Basmati rice. I doubt I'll make it again.

We did not like this at all.  I followed the directions and even marinated it overnight.  The chicken was very dry and had a strange flavor.  Seemed like the wrong balance of spices.  We typically like Indian food but we won't try this one again.

An absolutely authentic version of Indian Tandoori chicken. What I do is serve with grilled veggies (onions, peppers, and mushrooms with some grill seasoning is to die for). And, some rice - my husband`s favorite is saffron rice. Or, some Indian bread (naan or paratha).   If you want to get really gourmet you could let the yougurt drain in some cheese cloth or a clean dish rag/towel. This makes for a very creamy yogurt - and is what home cooks in India use. PS: I prefer to finish with a mango lassi - super simple to make!  ---- edit---- I also wanted to say you can find natural food coloring at the Indian grocers. Or, use some paprika.

I took my first bite and felt like Steve Martin in the Pink Panther the first time he tasted a Hamburger. 

The flavors don't mess around - Wow!  Delicious. I did the same as another reviewer stated. I broiled for 10 -12 minutes on each side. 

Flavor is the name of the game here. The chicken is so juicy. Food doesn't have to be boring!

I love this place. :)

we used fresh lemon instead of lemon juice, the recipe was so delicious, especially when we let it marinate the full 24 hours.

This was absolutely delicious.  The food coloring makes it look exactly like in the restaurants.  The long marinade in yogurt kept the chicken very moist.  I will definately make this again.

All I can say is WOW!.  I've never written a review here but this recipe was so good, I just had to come here and say it.  I followed everything to a 't' and it came out wonderful.  The garama masala is expensive but well worth it for this dish.  Can you post more indian recipe?

This was really good and was a huge hit at a dinner party.  I doubled the marinade for about 4 lbs. of thighs, and it was plenty.  Marinated for a bit over 24 hours and then cooked the chicken on the grill.  It seemed like a lot of cayenne so I held back when doubling, but next time will use the full amount.  The chicken came out tender and juicy and even skeptics who had never tried indian-style food before loved it.  Served it with basmati rice and the Marrakesh Vegetable Curry from this site (which we love).

I made this for my wife and it game out wonderfully.  I let it marinate overnight and left out the food coloring.  It grilled up nicely and I will definitely make it again.  It seemed a shame to do away with the marinade at the end, though.

Two words for this recipe: YUMMM ME!! I used 5 boneless skinless breasts, sliced in 2" strips, and used my tagine (moroccan cooker) on the stove top-low setting for 2.5 hrs.  Wow, was it flavorful and better than any restaurant tandoori chicken that I've ever had! (I didn't have to marinate either.) I served it with garlic mashed yukon gold potatoes.  Thanks for this recipe!!

I left out the cayenne pepper for the kids and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Smelled heavenly on the grill and tasted just as good.  This will be a regular in our house.

Just what I was looking for a marinade. Ended up grilling direct medium heat for a few minutes and then over indirect heat for about 30 minutes. Served with rice and dal maharani. Yum!

this was very good.  the seasonings were great.  I grilled it on an indoor grill, but would probably grill it outdoors next time due to the clean up mess on an indoor grill, or bake it in an oven.  I made this with naan bread, and basmati rice.  I will definitely make this again.  thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used boneless, skinless thighs.  They turned out very moist but the taste was bland.  With all the spices used, I had hoped there would be more flavor.  I did omit the food coloring and add turmeric and paprika to give it the orange color.

I just made this recipe for my family and it was a hit, even for my teenage kid who does not like anything spicy.  I reduced the cayenne pepper to only 1/2 teaspoons. I also used greek yogurt.  Broiled it in the oven, with door slightly open, at about 15 minutes each side. Served this with rice and cucumber raita.

This was very good. I followed the exact recipe. I only gave it four stars as it is not truly Tandoori chicken unless you cook it in a Tandoor over. This is as close as you get to the real thing without investing hundreds of dollars on a special cooker. We had several people over for an Indian dinner and this was everyone's favorite dish.

Tasted pretty good, but next time I'd definitely skip the food coloring. What a mess! Unless you want to be wiping up playdoh fluorescent pink colored yogurt from everything in your kitchen, leave out the food coloring!!
I marinated about 24 hours and grilled on a George Forman. It tasted good and was pretty mild.

5 Stars!  I don't have a grill, so I cooked chicken pieces in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, after marinating them for 24 hours.  Tastes just like from an Indian restaurant...except no Tandoor/roasted flavor.   So next time I'm going to cook on a grill.  I miss the smoky grilled facet of the dish.  I also used the garam masala recipe on Allrecipes, which tastes authentic to this non-Indian. A plus.

Made recipe as written but the chicken wasn't anything special. The flavor did set in ( had 4.5 hours to marinate) but it was still subtle. There wasn't enough to thoroughly coat the chicken. Not too bad but not great either. Won't make again.

very close in flavor to authentic but not exact. The texture is good but if you're looking for restaurant style tandoor chicken best go to the restaurant this is not for you.  I added more heat and spice to the recipe since it seemed a bit bland for my liking.

Didn't like this tandoori chicken as much as another one from this site, it was missing a sauce.  Tried to boil the marinade but silly me can't do that to yogurt, it curdles.

the search for a home tandoori marinade goes on:  this was not "It"...authentic it might be, but i want it to taste like the tandoori chicken we used to get at our Balti takeaway place in England...the flavour of this marinade was far too mellow, altho the chicken was nice and moist...so the search continues

Everyone loved the flavor. I did make 2 substitutions. Dairy allergy requires soy yogurt, which seemed to work fine (I just used one plain 8 oz serving) and I added 1/2 t turmeric and 1/4 t. paprika instead of the yellow and red food coloring. (Also allergy problems)Next time I might try saffron for a deeper yellow color.

This was good. I was hoping it would have more flavor since I marinated it for over 24 hours; However, it was still tasty. We baked it at 450 for 20 minutes then lowered to 350 for another 10. As a side dish I made basmati rice to try and have the whole Indian thing continue.

I tried this last night, and although it had a great flavor, it wasn't as "tender" as I expected.  I ended up creating a sauce to drizzle over it (1.5 tsp garam masala, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2-4 TB plain yogurt-or enough to make it saucy, chopped cilantro).. which made it much easier to taste the Indian spices/flavor.  I will try marinating for 24 hours next time, as opposed to 8 hours.  I also recommend mixing the chicken with the yogurt, as opposed to just layering it on top.  Oh, and I ommitted the food coloring.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make.  I followed the recipe as written, but omitted the food coloring since the thought of dyed meat sort of weirded me out.  Anyway, I served it with saffron rice and everyone loved it, even my 3-year-old.

I cut the cayenne in half because I was concerned that it would be too spicy, but I should have left it in! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and put on kabobs, then served them over basmati rice with a little saffron, and Raita and Naan on the side. An additional sauce (such as the cilantro sauce I've had at some Indian restaurants) would have been a nice addition.

This chicken was hot pink. My geusts really enjoyed it, I was hoping for something more spectacular, I think. I'll try it again without the color and with a few more spices.

This was a great tandoori recipe, and the flavor was subtle but wonderful.  If you really want spicy, kick up the cayenne.  I scraped off the marinade and baked at 450 for 30 minutes ( I had 3 lbs of chicken).  Then I broiled for 10 minutes for the grilled effect.  Really would be best on the grill as others had commented.  This will be my go to recipe this summer when I'm looking for a grilled chicken dish that can stand on its own without sauce.

This was okay.  I used the "oven" directions and thought the chicken was a little dry.  I WILL try this again but next time on the grill.  I did some chix breasts and some thighs, hubby said thighs were NOT dry and awesome!

This was super easy and flavorful!  I only had time to marinate for 4-5 hours, so I can't wait to try it after letting it sit for 24 hours!  I also baked mine, but I think grilling would be ideal.

FABULOUS, tasty, moist, and delicious!  It is definitely some of the best grilled chicken we've ever made.  I marinated for 48 hrs (on accident) and hubby and I were both completely impressed with this dish.  Can't wait to make again!

Wasn't sure I'd like this as much as the Americanized versions at first but it was delicious and very authentic tasting.  The chicken was incredibly moist.  Will definitely make again.

I thought this was the best tandoori chicken I've ever had. Hubby and 11 year old thought it was pretty darn good too. 14 year old said "too spicy". Bah, what does he know?! I marinated for about 36 hours. Grilled thin chicken breasts on my George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor Grill. PERFECTION! Made it with the Indian Style Basmati Rice and Naan from this site.

Very good!  Tandoori chicken, because of the way it is traditionally baked (in big clay ovens), is not eaten with sauce so don't let that comment turn you off from trying this marvelous recipe.

This is our new favorite meal!! I'm not sure where the fat comes from in the nutritional info, but I used non-fat plain yogurt and it turned out REALLY yummy. I also used boneless, skinless breasts. I steamed broccoli and squeezed lemon juice over it -- an excellent compliment to the spicy marinade. Jasmine rice made in a rice cooker was great with this meal.

I made this recipe using chicken breast which I cut into pieces and marinated for only 12hrs. I did add an extra garlic clove in the marinate. I then pierced them on skewers and grilled them on the BBQ. Absolutely amazing. The chicken came out tender and tasty. Will add to make favorite recipe box.

this was beyond absolutely amazing.. i used legs and thighs and marinated for close to 24 hours.. unfortunately it started raining when we were planning on grilling so we had to bake it in the oven.. i can't wait to try this on the grill.. i was worried about adding the whole teaspoon of cayenne but it wasn't hot.. i don't carry food coloring in the house so i left that out.. i was more concerned about how it tasted rather than how it looked.. we used a roasting rack in the oven.. ty so much for the recipe.. i can't wait to have it grilled

Great Indian-cooking alternative to curry.  Fun to make the marinade and tastes amazing after outdoor grilling.  I had minor yogurt separation (hard to avoid with yogurt + heat) but it didn't at all hurt the finished recipe unlike other yogurt-based recipes I've tried.  Great stuff!

I tried this recipe with the baked suggestion, and I got dried out, but beautifully colored chicken. Also, the lemon juice made the chicken bitter, and I had to add salt after the chicken was cooked.

I expected the spices to "pop" a little more. It didn't have a nearly as much flavor as I was expecting. I marinated mine for over 24 hrs and grilled it on the grill, and it was good, just not outstanding. If I were to make it again, I would add more spice.

Don't change a thing! I would normally skip artificial color, but I made an exception in this case, and doubled up on red. The food coloring added to the authenticity of this dish, and the first bite took me back to those spring days spent with friends in Lucknow. Too bad we can't get Kingfisher 650ml. Also, if at all possible, use charcoal grill. Little scorch marks add to presentation, and makes for better flavor.

Fantastic recipe!  I doubled the garlic, ginger and the spices and would do so again.  I also skipped the food coloring (??) and used about a tsp of turmeric instead.  I only had time to marinate for about 6 hours but the chicken was extremely flavorful and juicy.  Served with homemade peanut sauce on the side and Onion Rice from this site.

We just used a whole cut up chicken.  thought it was flavorful however I feel the food color is completely unnecessary.  out chicken came out a pinkish color which I am sure is an ode to the original dish but I will be leaving it out next time.

This was an easy, delicious meal.  The chicken was moist, tender and tasty.  I followed the recipe and marinated for about 6 hours.  We grilled it and added the cilantro--wow--everyone loved it.  Thanks, Simmi!

Chicken marinade over night. Spices did no penetrate the chicken very well. The flavor was very mild.

Turned out exactly as I'd hoped. I marinated a split whole chicken for 48 hours, turning over every 12. Roasted it in the oven till 10 degrees below temperature then took to the grill to char and finish cooking.

This is a wonderful recipe! I usually sub tandoori spice for the garam masala, and sometimes add some curry. No need for the artificial dye, of course.

Made this and Diane F.'s tandoori chicken recipes for comparison; I followed the recipes pretty closely.  Simmi's recipe calls for more yogurt than is necessary.  I would recommend only about 3/4 cup of yogurt (for less waste).  I omitted food coloring and used greek yogurt in lieu of regular plain yogurt.  I baked the chicken at 400F for an hour on a rack over a cookie sheet; I used dark meat only with skin on.  I prefer Diane F.'s recipe as it is more flavorful (the cinnamon, clove, and coriander helped amp up flavor and color).  I served chicken with garlic naan from Trader Joe's (frozen section, made in India).  Yum!

I elected to leave the food coloring out because I don't think it is so healthy for people. Also, I cooked this in the oven at 350 for 1.5 hours, as previously suggested. Thanks for this recipe, I will be making it again.

Even though we were having a guest for dinner, I decided to try my hand at Indian food for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  Everyone agreed that my decision paid off, as this chicken turned out great!  Very moist and flavorful.  I cut up 3 boneless breasts, marinated them overnight and then put them on skewers to grill them like kebabs.  Served with basamati rice and grilled vegetables.

This has a very nice flavor and the chopped cilantro sprinkled at the end lends a very nice touch and flavor to the chicken.  I read the recipe and saw the amount of food coloring and thought, "that can't be right!  I usually use only drops at a time."  Well, I started adding drops of food coloring and sure enough, it needs the entire amount that is listed in the recipe in order to get the true tandoori coloring.  This was very good and also good as leftovers, which I had for lunch!

Oh my goodness.  Best chicken I've ever had.  I marinated for just over 48 hours, but my chicken was frozen when I threw it in the marinade (frozen tenderloin strips).  I skipped the food coloring.

Made the chicken with thighs and drumsticks. Followed the recipe exactly, but left out the food colouring. Marinated for 24 hours. The chicken wasn't pink (despite what other reviewers have suggested) and it was delicious off the BBQ :)

I used only chicken thighs with the bone.  Prep was really easy.  I let it marinate about 7 hours.  Absolutely delicious, will definitely make this again.  My husband doesn't like"spicy" food so I cut the cayenne in half, still was very tasty.

For the yellow/orange color you can use turmeric and paprika (authentic tandoori is a burnt reddish/orange).

Really, really good! I used light sour cream instead of yogurt but everything else was followed exactly. Moist and tasty right off the grill. I will make this again and try it in the oven to see if it stays as moist as the grilled version.

This was great!  I followed the recipe, except I forgot to add the fresh garlic!  So I sprinkled garlic powder at the end (still tasted great!).  I omitted the food coloring, you don't need that to taste good and food coloring is not healthy to eat.  When grilling, I spooned the marinade on top, since the marinade tastes so good!  I served it with some dal & rice.  Yum!

Very nice. I skipped the red food coloring and replaced the cayenne pepper with Indian red pepper. The taste wasn't what I anticipated and the gravy was also scanty, but otherwise--I guess it was good!

I made this for a chicken cook off challenge today and it was a major hit. My friends and family had never had Indian food before and really loved this dish. The food coloring really added to the presentation, and reminded me of the tandoori dish I had at an Indian restaurant we go to all the time.

This recipe was okay - we've made it 4 times now - it keeps getting better but it still doesn't have the taste we've come to know as tandoori chicken (like it's served at our favorite Indian restaurant). This is why I am giving it a 3 star rating. We cooked ours in a clay pot (we can't have a grill in our apt) following AMHEINTZ review, but although it was very moist the problem is the overall texture - wet, like BBQ chicken. We like the dry, and slightly leathery texture that only comes from grilled meat. This is a good recipe, but the taste wasn't as flavorful as expected - so my 3 stars stay.

Very good and nicely spiced.  And I vegetarian-nized it using Quorn tenders (chicken-style meat substitute) and it turned out really well!  I'm going to try it next with chicken-style seiten, thanks for the recipe

This was very good.  My kids who are starting to really like Indian food also liked it.  I however did not have the food coloring so omitted it.  If you have not had Tandoori chicken before it probably would not bother you, however it needs the food coloring to have the authentic tandoori chicken appearance.  I will definatly make this again and use the food coloring next time.  I also will put the onions through the food processor.  I chopped them but they just were not fine enough to really stay on the chicken when cooking.

i followed the recipe pretty closely and marinated the chicken overnight but did not add the lemon wedge at the end. i'm not sure it would have helped because the chicken was still fairly bland. could have use some more salt & seasoning...

We're not even done grilling all the meat yet, and we have to give this five stars.  Spicy, peppery and delicious.  We can't wait to sit down with some basmati rice and eat!

This was awesome.  I used cubes of chicken breast and the marinade worked out great.  I will say though, Tandoori is supposed to have a BBQ taste, so I cooked it on some charcoal and it was better than any I've ever had at a restaurant.  Well... because they probably can't BBQ as well as I can at my house, but that's that.  It was awesome.

Absolutely fantastic.  I made this recipe as written marinating it 24 hours.  We grilled the chicken and served with rice.  My roommates who don't venture too far into the foodie world both thought the meat turned out so flavorful.  I cut back quite a bit on the heat for them and it was still what I would expect in a restaurant.  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good but not as good as going out. I used thighs and next time will try breast meat. The flavor is pretty good, its a fantastic dish to make at home and easy. I don't think I can do any better without a Tandoori over. I will be making this again.

This recipe came out perfectly. I didn't have red and yellow food coloring, only had neon pink - that worked beautifully! The color made the chicken look really authentic. Overnight marinade made it a 5 star meal!

This is a very good and easy recipe. I really enjoy the flavor. I just want a little more depth to it. It needs a little bit more of a spice but I haven't quite figured out which one yet. However, this is quite a tasty recipe so glad you shared it with us.

Added a little more pepper to spice it up to where my family love it - only managed to marinade for 4 hours - still perfect (will definitely do the 24hr next time to see if there is much difference)

I ate Chicken Tandoori the other day and just had to find a way to make it at home. The flavor in this recipe to me is a perfect match. I used ground ginger instead of fresh ginger and a pack of about 16 small boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Marinated for 24 hours  and cooked in the oven at 425 for 30 minutes each side.

Added kashmiri chillies and blended the marinade.
Also used chicken breast cubes on wooden skewers - they disappeared coming off the grill

I used plain coconut yogurt as I can't have dairy, and it was really delicious... I'm sure it would have been better if I had actually marinated it, but thought of this about 10 minutes before cooking dinner!  I grilled it, and it just came out very moist and yummy.

Definitely a winner - the star of an Indian food feast served to friends.  Followed the recipe pretty closely, including the food coloring.  I added some turmeric as well - but the color was off enough to persuade me to use the food coloring - and very glad I did, yummy and well seasoned result.  Delicious and very visually appealing after cooked.  Thanks for this recipe - made me look like a gourmet champ.

This recipe was tasty and very simple to prepare. I left out the food colouring (not necessary in my opinion), and I used  my own Garam Masala spice blend.i find it has a much brighter flavour than store bought

My first time trying Tandoori Chicken and it was a hit!  Surprisingly authentic tasting; even with the food colouring.  Followed recipe exactly and made the naan recipe on this site to go with it. Cant believe I did it all myself.  Yummy!! Marinated chicken for 27hrs and recommend marinating for as long as you can- at least overnight.

I found this recipe because my mom makes something similar but I couldn‚Äôt remember how she did it. I followed the recipe except omitted the food coloring and cilantro because I didn‚Äôt have any. I only marinated for 1 hour and definitely plan to marinate overnight next time as you can really taste the difference. This totally hit the spot, but wasn‚Äôt quite as good as mom‚Äôs. As a bonus, my toddler loved it!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I marinated for 24 hours. I took others' advice and was generous with the spices; I used 1/4c. more of yogurt and a little more of each spice. I also used turmeric and paprika instead of food coloring. It did not seem to change the flavor. I topped with more fresh cilantro when serving. I made this with cucumber salad and long grain steamed rice. Yummmmmmmm....

Okay, I followed the recipe exactly except I added more garam masala because I love the flavor and like very flavorful food. The dish tastes delicious. However, the food coloring turned the dish a BRIGHT coral shade (maybe I have extra potent food coloring?) It was without a doubt the MOST unappetizing dish I have ever prepared. The yogurt also curdled and looked gross. I am probably going to try another recipe with the same basic ingredients because even as delicious as it tastes, the appearance made it difficult to eat. I wish I could post a picture. I can't adequately describe how bright pink this chicken turned out.

My family liked the chicken OK, but they thought the spices were a little too much, so that they couldn't taste anything but heat.  However, I did use the leftovers to make chicken enchiladas with (not adding any heat to that recipe), and they liked those just fine.  If I make this again, I will cut back on the heat a bit.

Will make it again.  Used tomato paste instead of red food colouring, turmeric instead of yellow colouring.  Cooked in 225¬∞C oven for 45 mins and think it was just slightly under done.  Perhaps all the marinade sauce kept it from drying out or cooking quickly.  But it was delicious.

This turned out really well and may become my favorite baked chicken recipe. I made several changes, first I used chicken breasts instead of legs, I also opted out of using food coloring, I added a teaspoon of turmeric and paprika instead to give color. I liked the gentle earthiness that turmeric provided to the dish as well. I didn't have lemons on hand either so I gave a small dash of white wine vinegar to the chicken  instead.

I accidentally marinated my chicken for two straight days in the fridge (life got in the way) so it got some series marinating  time which could only have made it more delicious IMO! To cook, I oven baked it at 450 degrees for around 30 - 40 mins and importantly I covered the chicken with a piece of parchment paper - this helped "dry poach" it to seal in moisture, I recommend doing this as oven baked chicken can go from moist to dried out in the blink of an eye. The coloring when it was done was a lovely bright yellow golden, not the traditional red but I preferred it and it tasted wonderful, very very moist.  I only took a star off because even without my own additions, I could tell the flavoring isn't quite the same as a traditional tandoori chicken marinade, not quite sure how it's different though.

I marinated for 24 hours and baked in the oven.  Served with turmeric rice.  The family loved it! Even my super picky 10 yr old went back for seconds!  I will definitely make this again.

Nice moist, flavorful chicken.  Skipped the dyes as I see no need to needless chemicals to my food.  Will definitely make it again!

this was very good.  I used around 3 lbs of chicken and used the same amount of yogurt, but upped the rest of the ingredients by half.  I left out the food coloring.  I left the skin on which in retrospect, I wish I had ripped it off.  The flavor was great, but mostly just in the skin, not the meat :( I marinated it overnight.  I used a combo pack of thighs and drums and bbq'd them over charcoal.  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe! I marinated the meat for a little over a day. Of course, I used more garlic and added salt. i also used a tsp more of garam masala. Definitely worth firing up the grlil. I served w/ grilled corn on the cob, and couscous w/ peas. Definitely, a very authentic taste.  Oh..I used 4 whole chicken breasts with the wings attached. I skinned them and cut them up and had over 10 portions!

Not bad - could have used more spice for sure.  I thought 1 tsp of cayenne would be spicy and I don't like spicy food at all but it wasn't even remotely spicy!!!  Next time I would add some more garam masala and some more cayenne.

Great recipe - my Indian partner was amazed. It has become known as my 'pink chicken' as I didn't have any yellow food colouring but didn't affect the taste. Added extra green chillis to make the grade with fire eating other half.

This was fantastic!  My husband raved about it, as well as my picky 9 year old and the friend she had over for dinner.  Even our 1 year old loved it.  I do wish it had a sauce, but that's just me.  I served it with Naan and curried cauliflower, it was a fantastic Indian meal.

This was so good! I didn't top with the cilantro at the end because it didn't seem necessary. Next time I may add it into the marinade for even more flavor. I let these sit for about 20 hours before grilling.

Delicious- only marinated 6 hours- can imagine it must be divine marinated longer.  Was going to use leftovers to make Indian Butter Chicken- but ended up using the few leftovers I did have to make a spectacular and full of flavor chicken salad for lunch the next day.

Had to quadruple the spices with just a bit more than 2 x the water to coat about 1 1/2 lb. of chicken pieces. Broiled in the oven for approx 5-6 minutes per side. The flavors and spice were scrumptious!

Everyone loved it!  I used really large chicken breasts, and next time I would make sure and butterfly them so they would be thinner.  I only marinated them for 8 hours, and it was still great.  Next time, I would try to marinate overnight for more flavor.  Great recipe!

Yummy. I used food colouring but don't think it did any good. The chicken was a funny colour. I think I'll leave it out next time because it doesn't affect the flavour anyway. But the chicken was delicious. I marinated it for about 20 hours. I cooked it on the George Foreman grill and it was really quick. I don't like cilantro so I used dry parsley because that's what I had on hand. I'm going to try this recipe with drumsticks next time.

This recipe was great.  I love tandoori chicken so I had my fingers crossed.
Watch out for the food coloring.. they're not all created equal.  My chicken was really pink but looked ok after it was cooked.

I'm more then willing to admit I screwed something up while cooking, however I followed this recipe exactly and this didn't come out well at all. I had tandoori chicken for the first time while I was in Iraq, as the cooks were allowed once a week to cook a dish from their homeland. It was delicious, and this was just bland. I didn't use food coloring, and it still looked bland and white. The taste left much to be desired, and if it wasn't for my side of couscous I would have ordered Pizza.

My wife and I enjoyed this dish.  I had to search for a recipie for the spices - which was not hard to find.  Overall tasty with a touch of spice. Very nice.  Only thing I did was cut the chicken into small sizes (like for a stir fry) which i would not do in the future.  try it - its worth the wait.

I followed everything exactly as written except that I only used 1.5lbs of chicken.    I think I did the food coloring part wrong though because my chicken came out a pink color... not sure if that was right.  The chicken definitely tasted really good and it wasn't hard to make.

This recipe is fantastic. Use a charcoal grill for the most authentic flavor. Alternatively you can bake in the oven for a not so authentic, but very easy and satisfying meal when served with rice and veggies.

This was very good.  Not sure if I'll make it again, but it was good.  I had to use up some yogurt and this fit the bill.

This was a very good recipe and turned out OK. I did not use as much food coloring as the recipe calls for as it seemed excessive to me. This tastes like it is lacking "something". I am not really sure what that is yet but overall it is a great recipe.

We have had our share of Indian food where we live overseas. The recipe on the grill was a good substitute for a tandoor oven.  My family likes it very spicy however, and we added an extra teaspoon of cayenne to the recipe, otherwise we followed the directions exactly.  We found our garam masala at Target, but if you have time it is worth making your own.  Recipes are easily found on the internet.  All and all this was a very good and healthy dinner.  Yogurt cucumber, pineapple, onion salad is a nice sidedish to provide cooling.

I used bonless chicken thighs... cheaper than breasts, and I think moister. Also found that the indian spices are much cheaper at local indian stores that the major supermarket chains. Lots of work, but so worth it. I skipped on the cilantro and lemon wedges, but this was eaten up so fast. Thanks for the great recipie.

This was the best chicken recipe I have ever made. (I used boneless breasts, which are normally rather tasteless.) These, however, were moist and smoky, with just the right amount of spice. My picky kids asked for seconds, and even the leftovers were tender and juicy the next day. It was worth the advance preparation!

Good! The night-before preparation took a little time, but the actual cooking of the meal was so quick and easy. We did it on our gas grill, and it came out nice. Was not as good the next day for leftovers, but that's okay. I liked the color of it- I've had Tandoori Chicken before, but this is the first time I've made it at home.
