I was making the other Beer Margartis, and someone else brought this one.  This is the only way I make them now.  No need for mexican beer.  Good ol Miller works just fine,

This recipe was a huge hit with everyone!  I did 10oz tequila + 2oz triple sec.  The triple sec really made it great.

Fantastically tart flavor!!  I used Corona for the beer and a can of frozen margarita mix (Old Orchard).  Kept all the proportions the same and served on the rocks.  Huge hit on Cinco De Mayo!!!  The flavor was refreshingly tart, without that 'syrupy sweetness' you can get with other margarita mixes!  Thanks!!

These are great tasting - refreshing and a nice change.  The only change I made was to add two cans of diet sprite.  My guests loved it - gave the recipe to everyone.

Good Stuff!!!! As we know, tequila definitely has a mind of it's own and coupled with the beer, these can deliciously sneak up on you! I got a margi machine for Christmas so New Years Eve was celebrated by breaking it in! Thanks ChefJeff!!

I'm not typically a fan of margaritas, but I thought this drink was great! I think sometimes margaritas are too limey tasting and I think the beer really  balanced it out. I used a frozen can of margarita mix concentrate instead of the lime aid.

I cut this recipe in half. (To easily reduce the limeade, I took the limeade out of the freezer and cut the frozen container in half with a very sharp knife. I just stuck the remaining half in the freezer in a Ziploc bag.) This surprized the heck out of my husband and I--we loved this drink. Refreshing and absolutely delicious. This is going to be a favorite drink recipe for this summer.

Whoa. My new favorite margarita. It's so much lighter than regular margaritas! I made two changes:
1. Blended the tequila and limeade with ice before adding beer.
2. Added a jigger of triple sec.

This is a great pitcher for a nice summer day!  I'm going to play with the recipe some more I felt that there may have been a little too much limeade however that may be an easy fix by adding another beer or 2!  I also added about 1/4 cup of triple sec.  This is a hit though for sure!

I can't even describe how much the concept of this recipe curls my tastebuds.  However, a tip:

 rather than dirty a measuring cup, just use the container the limeade came in to measure out the tequila.

These were tasty.  I'm not really a beer person but this made the beer really good.  A great summer refresher.  We did cut back on the tequila however, otherwise, I would have been under the table.  A great choice for your next BBQ.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

We make these all the time during the summer as they are so refreshing. We reduce the beer by one bottle/can and add two cans of soda (Sprite, Squirt, 7-Up, etc.). All other proportions are the same.

I really enjoyed these. We made as stated and it made about 8-10 small- med drinks. My husband said after two he couldn't drink more because they were so sweet but I could've drank a few more despite feeling the drink after just one. I liked these better than the other beer margaritas on this site and will use this recipe before that one going forward.

This was a refreshing drink for the summer. I used Corona although any summer blonde or shandy would have worked just as well. Only the two of us so I only used two bottles of beer and cut the tequila to a half cup. We thought the tequila drowned out the taste of the beer so next time I would cut it to a 1/4 cup and possibly add the third bottle of beer.

Well, we love our tequila so these are a good thirst quencher on a nice sunny Sunday afternoon. I like them better than the regular margaritas. We usually add a little more tequila cause we just can't help ourselves!

I make this in the summer all the time.  I call it "Summer Brew."  Sometimes I use Lime flavored vodka instead of tequila and add 2 Corona's & serve it over crushed ice.  YUMMY!
