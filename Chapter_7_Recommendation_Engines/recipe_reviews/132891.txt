Five stars because it was yummy, inexpensive, and soooo easy to make!  The first time I made it, I used dried basil since I didnt have fresh and added spinach for color.  I tried it again with the fresh basil and it was equally as good, so you have a lot of flexibility here! Everyone loved them!

I added salami to this recipe and substituted mozzarella cheese for the feta and it was a big hit to dip in marinara sauce.

These were positively DELICIOUS! I used a crescent roll sheet, deli thin shaved honey ham, the whole container of cheese (5oz.) and dried basil. I made 1 log and cut this in 12 pieces. Excellent recipe! Tasted much like pizza without the sauce.

These were delicious and easy.  The saltiness of the feta combined with the fresh basil and olive oil really is reminiscent of "mediterranean" or greek. Don't skimp on the basil, it's key to the flavor. They're flaky and tender, and the filling just melts in your mouth.  Next time, I will add some chopped sun dried tomato to the filling, not only to enhance taste but to give this appetizer a little pop of color.  Best served warm, and they reheat well.  This is a keeper.

We thought these were delicious. I used seasoned feta (containing basil and sun-dried tomatoes) and thought that additional sun-dried tomatoes would be an excellent addition in the future. However, I have to knock off a star for 2 reasons. #1. It would be extremely hard to get 5 segments from each rectangle; I only got 4, and each of my end pieces was a little skimpy (and I doubled the feta in these). #2. At 375, 16 minutes over-browned mine; I'll use 350 next time. Thanks for the recipe, I'm sure I'll use this, (or some combination of this) again!

Very good, but too salty (and I like salty!).  Maybe it was the prosciutto I used (Canadian-made, as opposed to Italian).  I also think it could have used a little more basil.  I'll try again with a better prosciutto or a low-salt ham.

Pretty, and probably would've been great if they weren't so salty.  It just killed the flavor for me.  Next time I'll try salami and mozzarella and see how they come out, I guess.

Absolutely delicious. Easy to make and my guests absolutely raved about them. I used prosciutto and a flavored feta cheese but am going to experiment using other meats and cheeses. Although I think the feta will be hard to beat.

these are wonderful! i didn't have this screen up when i was in the kitchen so i forgot about the floured surface (that would have made a BIG difference i think) and rolled them from the longside instead of the short. but let me tell you, just like beauty its whats on the inside that counts! YUM i didn't have the feta so i used thin sliced provolone to go with the thin prosciutto and thin hard salami i put in there. and i sprinkled them with dried basil (that's all i had on hand) before i rolled them up.  love this recipe. ty for sharing it.

make sure you bake on the middle/top shelves of oven. The bottom of mine burnt and the top was still doughy, but the ones that did cook thoroughly were great!

These were great, a nice change from the usual tastes on the appetizer table.  I added some chopped black olives to the cheese mixture just because I had some leftover from another receipe and it was a nice addition.

These are amazing!!  I made a few changes that we liked.  I used garlic crescent rolls for extra flavor and instead of fresh basil (its out of season) I used Italian seasoning.  Also, since Prosciutto is so pricey I replaced with pastrami.  I will definitely have these for my next gathering.

I made these exactly as the recipes states and they were little more than pigs in a blanket as far as the taste, really (and much more work!) We dipped them in pizza sauce. They were not bad tasting, but nothing special.
