I grew up on CheezIt chicken as a kid!  I cut chicken breasts into strips, roll in egg, thenthe cheezits and bake at 400 for about 18-20 minutes or til done.  I think they are less fattening than frying.  My kids LOVE them!!!

Simple, seemingly failure-proof.  I added a little bit of cayenne pepper and some onion salt. Came out great for me.

Great recipe!  I didn't have Cheez-its so I used Pizza flavored Goldfish, added some garlic powder,salt and paprika and it turned out great.

My husband who "claims" he is not picky, LOVED IT!  My two youngs boys loved it as well.  It is very yummy! : )  Also I used sunshine Mild Chedder saltine crackers instead of cheezits.  It was what I had but now I know it works and it is less expensive than the other.

Had some cheez it's on hand and decided to make this recipe.  Turned out wonderful!  Will definitely make again.  Also used this recipe on pork chops and also turned out heavenly.  Thank You!

Maybe my Cheez-Its weren't fine enough or something...the taste was pretty good, but the texture of the batter was messy and not crispy at all.

I added a little (1 tsp) cayenne pepper to the coating. I also baked the chicken as suggested by a previous reviewer (400 for 18-20 min).
The chicken was tender and very tasty. 
There was a little work and mess crushing crackers and dipping chicken, but well worth the time!

This was an excellent recipe!  I made the following changes - used pork chops, baked instead of fried (350 for 20 minutes), and added cayenne pepper and omitted the oregano.  It's a great base recipe that can easily be switched around.  Cheez-its are my FAVORITE snack, so this recipe will be used often.

Everything I expected and more!!! I used chicken breasts cut into strips, and used garlic salt instead of celery salt. Since I don't cook with shortening I used butter and olive oil, crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside.

Delicious.  My extremely picky nine year old daughter loved it and ate more chicken than I have ever seen her eat in her life.
