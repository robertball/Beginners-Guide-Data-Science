This is a good basic recipe. I read the reviews and modified as follows:

1. 1/2 diced onion, 1/2 diced bellpepper, 3 diced chicken breasts - saute those 3 ingredients in a few tablespoons of olive oil and add creole seasoning, salt, and pepper to taste. Needs seasonings or it will be bland!

2. Boil 16 oz. egg noodles. Drain and return to pot. Add cream of chkn, cream of mshrm, and 7 oz sour cream. Mix in chicken and onion/peppers. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mixing in the chicken instead of adding it to the top keeps it moist.

3. Put in a baking pan and top with Ritz and butter combo (minus the sour cream). 

Do all that and this is a fantastic dish!

Yummy.  I used 2 lbs of chicken and 16 oz of noodles to better suit our tastes.  I used low sodium soup, low fat sour cream, and reduced fat Ritz. I mixed the sour cream into the body of the casserole instead of into the crumb mixture. For the seasoning, I used some dried herbs, dry mustard, a little curry, and black pepper.  Also added sauteed mushrooms and frozen mixed veg.  A lot of changes, but that's the way I cook -- look for a basic recipe and improvise.  I think this is a very good basic recipe.

I think the recipe was misprinted. It was TOO DRY so maybe it should of said "add sour cream to the chicken mixture", instead of topping.   I will not make again like the recipe indicated but will add veggies and MORE liquid...maybe another can of soup or chicken broth. Also not so much chicken! It had too much meat and not enough noodles.

This was a HUGE hit at my house. I read the reviews and did make a few changes. You must add milk to this or it will be too dry. I will add even more milk next time. I also threw in frozen mixed vegtables which added a ton of color and texture to the dish. I skipped the sour cream and only used half the cracker topping. It was just right. We will make this many more times and would be great if you need something for a potluck. My husband thought is was like a chicken pot pie with noodles. YUMMY!

OK, I made some changes to the recipe...I used low fat soup, fat free sour cream, and low fat towne house crackers (a sleeve and a half). 

I used 6 boneless breasts of chicken cubed and a whole onion chopped while that was cooking I sprinkled about 1 tsp of garlic powder on the mixture. when that was done I mixed everything together in a large mixing bowl...I also added a bag of frozen mixed veggies. *** the one thing I noted in the recipe is that it calls for seasoned salt but it does not tell you when to add it in I added it to everything in the mixing bowl*** 

It was a little bit of work...but worth it, I will definetely make again. Thanks!

This was good.  Made a lot of mess though.  I added the mushrooms and broccoli others suggested.  I also didn't pay attention and ended up adding the sour cream to the casserole rather than the topping.  The casserole is very creamy and had good flavor.  I used two chicken breasts and still thought I had too much meat and not enough noodles.  Next time I will probably use one chicken breast and the same amount of noodles.  I think it is a good basic started and you should feel free to experiment with extras.

This is a great recipe, using the suggestions in the reviews.  The leftovers are great too!  We all could eat it-my 85 yr old Dad, my husband and my teenagers.  Thank you!

It was good but not so good that I would make it again. It seems like the sour cream should have been mixed in with the other ingredients instead of the topping.

WOW - What can I say - COMFORT FOOD PERSONIFIED!!  Very good, but VERY fattening.  What I would change next time:  Omit the sour cream - not needed.  Just do the crushed Ritz w/1/4 c.melted butter for the topping.  Add 1/2 c. milk to the noodle mixture - makes it creamier.  Add 1 can diced waterchestnuts - crunch would be good and possible 1 bag frozen chopped brocolli.  I also added 2 cans of mushroom pieces.  Fun recipe to experiement with.  I'll make again.

We loved this recipe! of course, I did my own alterations to it. I put in onions, celery and carrots as my veggies. And, I know that I messed up on the crust. I had no crackers so I used fine bread crumbs; The bf liked it, but I didn't really give it a chance. I know that the real crust would be amazing by the taste of my pseudo-crust, so I will definitely make this again!

This was a very good casserole.I also used less chicken then the recipe states and I used low fat sour cream and low fat soups. The topping was very tasty. I also added broccoli to the recipe.I will make this again.

This was a great one. The grandkids didn't like it (they liked the jello) but the son-in-law actually complimented. That is a biggie. Thanks

I made the recipe exactly as directed, and it was delicious!  Even my small children (3yo and 18mo) loved it.  My mom used to make this dish when I was young, and she lost her recipe.  We had no idea what it was called.  Imagine my surprise when I randomly made this casserole and realized it was one and the same!  Yum!!  SO glad I found this!

Very tasty, easy to make. I like a real crunchy topping so I might try a different topping other than the crackers but it still has good flavor and I'm sure I'll make again.

This is a good base to a GREAT casserole. The original seemed bland to me.  I made some changes and it was awesome.  This is what I did.  Used 3 breasts of chicken boiled then chopped, half the noodles, small bag of frozen mixed vegetables  (I used broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, beans, red pepper) and I added a lot of spices. Onion powder because I skipped the onion, garlic, seasoning salt, cayenne, and paprika all used liberally.  Like others I found it to be too dry when I mixed all of the above ingredient together so I just added a little chicken broth and an extra can of cream of mushroom soup.  The sour cream cracker topping is amazing.  DOn't skip it!!

I was really impressed with this, it was WAY better than I thought it would be!  Like everyone else, I made some changes; I seasoned the chicken with the seasoned salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning, added fresh mushrooms to the chicken/onion saute, added a bag of frozen green peas to the casserole mixture, and used the sour cream in the casserole part instead of the topping. I used a pound of chicken and about 12oz of egg noodles. I also added about 1/4 cup of milk Wonderful!!! Great comfort food!!

This is great comfort food.  I boiled 3 chicken breasts and cubed.  Added sour cream, canned mushrooms and 1 1/3 cup heavy cream to soups.  I mixed my cooked noodles and chicken with 1/2 soup mixture and put into WELL greased dish.  Topped w/ remaining soup then crackers.  My children 3 & 6 both asked for seconds.  Served w/ corn on the cob and salad. Yum!

The flavor of this dish was great.  It needs some liquid though, maybe 1/2 cup of milk to make it creamy.  It was too dry.  Other than that it was good.

This pleased my family..which is sometimes hard to do. The only changes I made was adding in diced green peppers to the saute, and adding canned shitake mushrooms. It was pretty good.

After I read the reviews and altered the recipe to suit my tastes, this was DELICIOUS!  I used garic pepper, season salt and onion powder in the pan with the chicken.  I used one can of Cream of potato, one can of broccoli cheese soup. I also added a half a bag of frozen broccoli cuts to the mix.  This was fabulous.  Dont let some of the bad reviews discourage you from trying..Create~Imagine~Spruce it up to your tastes!  That is what I do with EVERY recipe I ever use!  I will make this again~Yum

Delicious recipe if you use about half the chicken!  I was questioning the amount when I bought it and realized the absolute enormity of it when we were cutting it!  Use about half the chicken and it turns out great!  Would be extra good with a little bit of cheese in with it too!

This one was a hit with my husband and my 9 month old!  Mixed in sour cream and just put crackers on top.  Definitely a keeper!

Very simple and tasty dinner.  Will make again with some extra flare like peas, broccoli, or red peppers, etc. ... something with color to add spark to the presentation.

It was ok as far as chicken casseroles go.  Next time I'm leaving out the sour cream.  I think that was what threw the taste off a bit.

I LOVED this recipe. I cook it differently every time i make it. I usually just mix the sour cream in with the rest and only put the crackers and butter on top. I like to add mushrooms as well and more noodles! It is EXCELLENT!!!!!

This is a good starter recipe, and we loved the topping, but it needs some veggies in there. I think next time I'd add some mushrooms and some frozen peas.

I've had this recipe in my e-box for several years on this site and it is delicious! I do sub cream of celery for the mushroom and add sour cream to the chicken mixture, otherwise it is perfect as written! Thanks for sharing it.

I made a bunch of cassaroles to freeze one Sunday and this is one of the ones I picked.  This is amazingly simple, yet elegant tasting.  I had my boyfriend try all of them and give me a rating.  I thought I wasn't going to have any of this one left!  He kept saying "I can't tell if I like it yet, I need one more bite" haha, this is a definite keeper.  I boiled the chicken and then diced it up and threw it in with sauteed onions, seasoned with a little Season All and this was delish!!

This is a family favorite and I love it because it is so easy to make!  I don;t put in as much chicken as the recipe calls for.  I do it by sight.  I also use extra cr. of Mushroom to make the noodles more flavorful.  Leftovers are even better!

Just wonderful. :) I mix the sour cream into the noodle mixture instead of the topping.  I also add slices of swiss cheese to the top before putting the cracker topping on.

I have fixed this recipe for a Christmas Bazaar for 4 years now.  We make and serve over 250 servings of this casserole.  If the noodles are cooked properly and and the chicken in not over cooked, the texture is creamy and smooth.  I put about 2/3rds the amount of chicken called for.  The topping of sour cream, butter, and crackers is a perfect topping.  WE get request from people wanting this recipe or a casserole made up for Christmas lunch or dinner.  (27 casseroles were ordered last year)  I think it is nice to add ones own style to a recipe, but this one is great if all the ingredients are prepared correctly.

This recipe needed some tweaking, but was overall good - I especially enjoyed the leftovers!  I did add an extra can of soup because it was dry when I was mixing it.  Also, I thought the sourcream should have been in the casserole, not the crackers, but I did make it the way the recipe said and it just seemed to get really rich on you after a few bites.  If I make this recipe again, I will eliminate the topping altogether, or just sprinkle some seasoned breadcrumbs on top.  Not bad for a hearty meal and plenty of leftovers!

I didn't like this much. It was pretty dry and bland. I think it was the crackers I didn't like, not to mention there's WAY too much chicken. I would recommend using only 2lbs of chicken, adding an additional can of cream of chicken soup and doubling the sour cream. Then add some more spices. This recipe inspired me to create a great recipe of my own! So thank you for that.

I really liked this dish!... I used about 1 1/2 lbs chicken instead of 3 1/2... It sounded like too much meat for us!  I left out the mushroom soup and instead added sour cream and some heavy cream to the cream of chicken soup.  I also added some shredded cheddar/jack cheese.  Like others suggested, I added more seasonings; garlic salt, thyme and black pepper.  Oh, I threw in about a cup of frozen peas and carrots.  I will make this again!

A very good basic recipe that would be easy to customize to individual tastes. I made it as directed except was using leftover chicken so I sauted the onion in a bit of olive oil. When I got to the topping I discovered that I was out of sour cream so I used some french onion chip dip instead. What at lucky mistake! It really added some zing to the topping and the entire casserole. Will be making this one again!

This was great.. I used reduced fat Club crackers (1 sleeve) and reduced fat margarine & sour cream.  I used the 98% fat free soups.  I cooked the onion with the chicken, I thought that the onion would be too crunchy if I didn't.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

With all those changes, it was delicious!!

For how much fat was in this casserole, it didn't taste that great. The recipe wasn't real specific either. If had known this would fill TWO 2 quart casseroles, I would have cut it in half. This was way too much work for such a bland, blah, blah, blah casserole.

Definately add a little milk to the soup mix and cut down on the chicken.  Next time we will also cut down on the onion, but that is just because my husband and I aren't big into onion.  We also added peas to the mix and little cheese on top.  Sounds like alot of changes but all were pretty simple to make.  And the end result was definately worth it.  This was a great recipe!  We will be making it again and again! Thanks!

My family liked this dish well.  I cut all the ingredients down to an 8X8 size dish.  Which basically, cut everything in half...except the chicken, which was way too much to begin with.  I used about 2-3 cups of diced chicken.  I think it needs a little more seasoning, though, so next time I make it, I will add more.  Thank you for sharing!

This was a nice "comfort food" recipe.  The only changees I made was to add some fresh chopped garlic to the chicken as I was cooking and added a little shredded cheddar cheese while baking.  Easy recipe

The topping makes this dish great.My whole family loved it.Following the advice of others that it was a little bland, I browned the chicken and onion in a dutch oven, then added chicken broth to the same pot, replaced the salt with season salt, brought it to a boil and cooked my noodles in the broth with the chicken and onions. After the noodles were cooked drained off the excess broth leaving the flavor behind.

Yum! Zing it up yourself. I added finely chopped onions, garlic salt and plenty of pepper to the crust mixture, as well as seasoned up the chicken/noodles with red pepper, green pepper and sour cream, plus a little milk to creamy it up real good. We dug it! (+ I'll apply the crust to a tuna casserole one day)

This was a very good casserole. It was easy and warm and comforting on a cool night. I had some left over bbq chicken breast. So i used that. The bbq favor was great! I will do this again

I agree with the many others that this recipe is a bit bland. It does have possibilities however.First of all, the sour cream must go. The buttery cracker crumbs will do fine alone. Maybe you can add some french fried onions in with the cracker topping. Definitely need to add milk to make it creamier and less dry. I think maybe some grated cheddar(even a little sharp cheddar) mixed in will add some extra flavor. I might even add some crumbled bacon. Adding some broccoli will make it a "one dish meal". Experiment a little and I'm sure you'll find this recipe does have some potential.I'm giving this one a 3 star just because it could be the start of a good recipe if your not afraid to experiment.

This was a good recipe for a quick dinner, a little bland but has lots of possibilities to add your own touch. Reheats exceptionally well for a brown bag lunch the next day.

This was VERY good. We all liked this meal, 
especially our 18 month old, who had 2 plates full.
I added a can of milk to "loosen" it up
a bit. The topping was a bit much, the next time 
I make it I will skip the sour cream, or just use
bread crumbs.

This came in handy when feeding a few of my nephews friends.  Strapping young men with and appetite so I added 1 lb. of Polish Sausage cut up into about 1/4 ot 1/2 " slices.  The juices from the sausage blended really great with the chicken and noodles.  All the young men raved and asked for seconds.

I have to say, this dish was decent. Not the best I've ever had but decent. Before making it, I suggest reading some of the reviews to see how others modified it a bit. The best modification I tried was from the most helpful positive review at the top. The suggestions they give help this recipe from becoming too dry and adds in some extra flavor. Also, be prepared for things to get  little messy while making it lol. This recipe needs a little tlc but still makes for a good dish.

When i came across this recipe it looked really good... When i was putting it together i put a little extra cream and a tad less meat. When it came to the toppings i put about a cup of crackers and ALOT of sour cream. I got spoon fulls of sour cream and put them all over the top and spread them out and to finish it off i put a little bit of shredded cheese all over it. Next time (and i advise to others making this recipe) to put french fried onions on the top. Thanks for the recipe, its a definite favorite of mine now!!! :)

I followed the recipe with the exception of the sour cream. I added it to the main mixture instead if the cracker topping. My family loved it! I will be adding this to our regular menu.

The first time I made this it was to bland for my family.  Made the following changes and they loved it. Added 8 oz. shredded cheddar cheese, 1 tsp. garlic, 1 tsp. ground pepper blend to 16 0z. sour cream.  Stirred can cream of chicken soup to this mixture, added cooked chicken & the noodles.  Topped all with buttered ritz cracker crumbs.  Baked covered for 30 minutes at 375, uncovered for 10 minutes.  Grand kids love this served with hot bread and a vegetable.

I did a few things differently- I didn't have noodles so used rice, added some Parmesan and milk to the sauce. Lastly, I stirred some chopped walnuts through, and sprinkled some on top with crackers. I'll make this again!

We were underwhelmed with this. I omitted the seasoning salt as most cream soups are salty enough on it's own and added fresh garlic and a couple choice seasonings from the cabinet. We ate it but we're just not into it.

This recipe is excellent! I did two things differently by mistake the first time, but it turned out so well I adapted. I added a splash of milk with condensed soups mixture as well as half the sour cream. And to up the veggies I added a part of a 10 oz pkg of frozen peas, as some other reviewers suggested. All and all a great crowd pleasing recipe, thanks Daniele for sharing.

I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom and seasoned the chicken with Adobo while it was cooking (I only used a pound of chicken).  I also threw in some frozen peas and carrots.  This was a yummy recipe.

My two boys cleaned their dinner plates which is very rare.  Then to my shock and disbelief, my little one asked if we could please have it again.  YIKES!  He is so picky that he even dislikes McDonalds, so you can imagine my delight when he asked for this wonderful casserole again.  Thank you so much for the yummy picky eater recipe.  Patty

Excellent! Our two picky eaters were even fans of this recipe! I would recommend adding more crackers, butter and sour cream to make a little more crust, because it didn't completely cover the top, but it was fantastic, and I have my husband's permission to add it to his list of fav's!

this recipe is fabulous! I made it more like a casserole rather than just pouring the mixture over the noodles and chicken and I think it probably added a lot of moisture to it.  I also added a small amount of chicken broth, milk, and ricotta cheese to it. In addition, I spiced it up a bit with paprika, black pepper, minced garlic, and garli-garni. 
It was so easy and made me love cooking.  Definitely adding this one to my regular rotation.
Enjoy!

I really enjoyed this recipe! Except I added 1/2 red bell pepper to the chicken and onion. Then when i poured it into the baking dish i mixed in 2 small heads of broccoli chopped up. Added more flavor and husband loved it too. I Will definately make it again!

his came out very good, added some garlic, red pepper and Cavenders (greek seasoning). wish I had some broccoli or mixed veggies I think that would have made it even better!

Just okay recipe. I think with 2 cans cream of chicken and some sour cream it would taste really good. I didn't like the mixture with the cream of mushroom. It just tasted gross to me.

This is a great recipe.  My family loves it.  I add canned corn into the chicken and noodles mixture.  This way the kids will eat their veggies. I make this at least once a month.  Very good!

My family went wild for this casserole. I had made a variation before and thought it was too bland. So after checking out some of the reviews I wanted to spice it up a bit too. Instead of seasoning salt I used cajun seasoning on the chicken while it cooked with the onion and a little garlic. I too mixed the sour cream with the soups. I also used more egg noodles. I mixed everything together, tasted and found it needed some more cajun seasoning. I put it in the casserole dish, topped it with cheddar cheese, and then the cracker pieces. I just drizzled the 1/4 cup of butter over the top.
It was wonderful and  not blah at all. It makes alot so be prepared to feed alot or to eat on it for a couple of days. I sent some to my parents and they loved it too.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I thought it was bland. The topping was pretty good. I may use it on other casseroles, but the filling was very blah.

There was no mention of oil or butter in which to saute the chicken. I decided on 2T canola oil which worked out fine. Next time I'll also add some pepper and 1/2 t Tabasco. I followed another reader's suggestion and used a whole pound of noodles, but wound up having to divide the casserole between 2 baking dishes. There was only enough topping for 1 dish. The topping was quite thick and pasty. It was difficult to spread. It took a lot of effort to massage it over the casserole to spread it evenly. Next time, a tablespoon or two of milk might make it more spreadable. The topping was not brown and crispy when the cooking time was through so I opted to turn the oven to the low broiler setting for about 5 minutes to brown the top. 4 stars might be a little high, but my husband and kids liked it, so I think it's a keeper to build upon.

All around a very good casserole.  The family loved it!  I ended up by accident mixing the sour cream into the caserole rather than the crackers, and it turned out great.  Couldn't imagine mixing it with the crumbs.

This is basically tuna casserole made with chicken. I liked it but added the sour cream with the soups and topped it with seasoned bread crumbs. Now, I use less chicken and more "sauce" for a creamier dish. I also added broccoli to the dish but it would also be great with some carrot. Season as you wish - we don't like very bland food. This is a great base recipe you can make anyway you'd like to suit your taste. I will make this again and will try other additions.

My family and I really enjoied this!!  I did make some changes though.  I didn't measure out the chicken, I think I used more like 1.5 lbs., I used amish style noodles, that's just what I had in the house, I added extra season salt and garlic to the chicken saute, used less sour cream plus about a 1/2 cup milk and added it to the soup mixture, I then drained the noodles and put them back in the pot and added everything to it and then put it in a 9X13 in. pan.  I used 1 sleave of crackers and a little less than a 1/2 cup of butter.  Great stuff!

This recipe is awesome... I changed it up a bit... I added southwestern seasoning to the chicken with black pepper and then also mixed some more in with the sour cream... following the advice of others I added the sour cream in with the soup. I used my chopper from pampered chef to chop the chicken up... it was so yummy.

Nice recipe. I used Herb and Garlic Crackers which gave it a great new taste.  I also added the sour cream in when I put the soup in.

This was good. I added more spices, celery salt,onion and garlic powder powder.  I also mixed the soup & sour cream together, by mistake, but the result couldn't have been better.  Will most likely make again.....maybe the right way.

This will be added to my list of favorite comfort foods! I do agree with other reviewers that this is a good basic starter that needs tweeking.I added a can of mushrooms, a can of peas & carrots and a can of cream of celery soup to add creaminess with the extra ingredients. I sauteed the onions with the chicken just for a few minutes and added garlic to the chicken.I took the advise of others and doubled the topping and I'm glad I did.I'm giving this 5 stars because of the killer topping!This will make a great leftover tonight! Kid friendly too!

The most delicious topping ever. I use it on other dishes too. I thought the rest of the recipe was pretty standard though we used less noodles than called for. We like our casseroles creamy.

This was a nice comfort food. It was a bit bland and had too  much onion for my taste. Next time I will cut back on onion and use more spices and sour cream. I DID however use lowfat everything so that could have to do with the blandness. Will make again though. My 18 month old cleared his tray!

This was pretty good; my family did not jump up and down about it,but for a weekday supper it was suitable. I used Mostaccioli noodles and added sour cream to the mixture. I also added black pepper and garlic powder and some mozzarella cheese. I used precooked chicken so it went quicker.Decent supper,just not spectacular.

I almost didn't try this recipe based on the bland reviews, it makes too much, etc. I'm glad I did try it.  I put it in a 9x13, used leftover chicken. I found it to be comforting.  I'll spice it some next time around. Hubby and daughter liked it a lot.

This was a big time consuming, which surprised me. I added additional seasonings: hot sauce, fresh ground black pepper, garlic powder and French tarragon as well as cheddar cheese. My kids renamed this chicken noodle soup casserole. They ate it and appeared to like it but I doubt I will make again. I really did like the crust however.

Not fabulous.  I added 2.5 chicken breasts, plus some garlic and pepper to the chicken/onion while sauteeing.  I'd like to try it again, though, with peas/carrots, and maybe try a low-sodium version of the soup.  I guess it was kind of bland as is.

I halved this recipe since I only had half the amount of chicken left over from another dinner.  This was super easy to prepare.  I used less onion than called for and still tasted it a little more than I would have liked.  Next time I make it I will try some different spices as this was good but needed something.  Maybe some garlic.  The topping was excellent.  After dinner everyone kept picking at the casserole until it was almost gone.

Very tasty.  The only thing I added was peas for color and nutrition.  I will definitely add this recipe to my favorites.

This was pretty tasty. I did make a few changes based on the earlier reviews. I added about 1/4 cup of milk to the chicken mixture, and I added a bit more seasoning (salt and pepper to the chicken while cooking, and garlic in the chicken mixture).

This was GREAT! My husband really liked it. I had some left over and he said not to throw it away he would eat it tomorrow. He hates leftovers. The only thing I did different was I added black pepper and a splash of milk to the soup.

This was a great start for me!  I think I'm the only one who made these few changes, due to my cravings that night!  I used cooked rice, instead of noodles for the base.  Then, used 1 can cream of chick. and 1 can cream of celery, mixed with about 8-10 oz. of sour cream to which I added the chicken and a large head of steamed broccoli.  I didn't add sour cream to crackers and it was great.  I will try it the original way one day, but it was awesome with these changes too!

I really liked this recipe, but cooked some elbow macaroni and mixed in with the ingredients. Then put in the oven. The topping is really yummy. Thanks for a new dinner idea and a great lunch leftover.

Casserole was yummy, although I added some broccoli florets. I wish I had added more noodles and less chicken. I made this dish for company, everyone really loved it.

Maybe I did something wrong, but it didn't turn out the way I thought it would--and I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and kids weren't too crazy about it, so I really don't think I'll make this again.  The flavor was a little "off," though I can't put my finger on it.  On the plus side, it was fairly easy to prepare.  Sorry, Daniele.

I make this recipe at least once a month.  I usually add less chicken than it calls for.  Several reviews said to lose the sour cream in the crust, but that is what makes this recipe different and I love it!

Very good recipe.  I mixed the sour cream in instead of adding it to the crust.  It was such a good dinner.  I prepared it the evening before.  It was so nice to come home and just throw it in the oven.

It was good but missing something. A little dry too. Maybe try adding more soup to the chicken mixture or even water. But I did like the taste of the cracker topping.

You sure do have to eat this while it's still piping hot.  After it cools, even the slightest bit, it will remind you of some kinda paste, in taste and mouth feel.  The topping was the best part, perhaps instead of using three cans of "cream of" soups, you can subtitute a can of chicken broth to thin out the texture.

A very good casserole to carry to Pot Luck Dinner.  Everyone loves it.  I will use this recipe again and again, because it uses items that are always in house ready to be prepared.  Thanks!
