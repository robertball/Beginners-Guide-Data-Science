I would make this with cold-brewed coffee. Also, what sense does it make to use 2% milk & then a gallon of ice cream? How 'bout  just making your own large amount of lightly whipped cream, infused w/ your own dark chocolate/vanilla bean, layered on top? Adjust measurements & methods accordingly. Sweeten with either white sugar or, perhaps pure maple syrup.

My mom made this tonight and I plan on making some tomorrow for my co workers, needless to say I’m in love with it! It’s very similar to a mudslide minus the alcohol. Even my daughter loved it (only a sip for her)

This stuff is divine! My mother-in-law made it for my baby shower and it was DELICIOUS! Everyone had at least 3 glasses of it. The only thing she did differently was use a gallon of vanilla instead of 1/2 gal of vanilla and 1/2 gal of chocolate.

I think when I make it - I am going to try using cold brewed coffee.

This is very delicious! Every time we host any type of shower at our church, I am asked to make this. I don't mind because it is so easy. I start off with half of all ingredients (remainder in freezer/fridge/jar) and as the crowd increases, I simply add the remaining ingredients.  Always a hit!

We make this for family gatherings and it's always been a hit. For daily use at home, I cut the recipe in half and leave the ice cream out.
