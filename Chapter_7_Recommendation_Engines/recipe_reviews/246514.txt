This turned out amazing!!i didn’t have quite as many bananas to use and didn’t have vegan chocolate so I used the coconut milk with cacao and coconut sugar. I had to actually use 1/2 cup of the coconut milk to make it cover the top. Gave it to my mom for her birthday and she said she would buy pay $35 at the store for something this good. I feel like that’s a success.

Made it yesterday for my husband's birthday and he loved it! He said it is better than cheesecake.
