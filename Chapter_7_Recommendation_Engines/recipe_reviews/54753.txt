EXCELLENT sauce, but use half n' half for richer flavor.  Superb with any kind of bread pudding or vanilla ice cream.  And definitely use LIGHT rum.  I used Meyer's Dark Rum, but the color was very unappealing.  Morgan's Spice Rum was the best.  Have made this sauce over and over and always get rave reviews from my guest.

This is a great recipe.  I substituted a tablespoon of vanilla for the rum and came up with an excellent sauce for my bread pudding.

This recipe was fantastic. I did half white sugar and half brown sugar for color and used half and half instead of milk. It got rave reviews.

I really like this recipe, my only things is that you should use white instead of dark rum It makes the sauce a funny color, but it still taste great

A keeper for sure! I added a dash of cinnimon and a half of a chopped apple to the sauce as it boiled. I also soaked about 1/4 cup of raisins in the rum to add in at the end. I served this over vanilla and butter pecan ice cream for a group of friends and they all gave it a thumbs up!

Today for the first time, I made banana bread pudding as its moms favorite dessert.  She raves about bread pudding and "the white sauce" on top.. Clueless as to what it was, I started searching for white (rum) sauce recipes...  Because of a wonderful snow storm, I was limited to ingredients and knew I couldn't pull the sauce off as the recipes I was finding had TONS of ingredients including heavy whipping cream, etc.. I came across this and couldn't believe how easy it was to make!!    I used xylitol instead of sugar (i'm always looking for a sugar alternative) and it was delishhhh!! Mom loved it over the banana bread pudding.  I followed others who said make a double batch, after all.. why limit something as sweet and sinful as this??

Made this sauce this morning for an apple crisp I'm going to make next week for a pig roasting dinner party. I'm here to say, what a great flavor! Can hardly wait until next week to try it on the crisp. Only changes made on a double recipe were: 1, used one cup milk and one cup of heavy cream that had to be used up or loose it. 2, Used seven Tablespoons of Captain Morgan's Spiced rum. Thought about adding raisins like one review mentioned but will save that for Thanksgiving! ***UPDATE*** This sauce is good but tasted even better on the apple crisp from AR. I even caught a couple of ladies eating JUST the sauce! Passed that recipe out to several that night!

Why would someone want a RUM sauce recipe and not use rum? 

This is a very good recipe but I don't use the milk and lit the rum to burn off the alcohol...wonderful sight.

This was great! I didn't have any rum so I substituted 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, and I followed reviewers' suggestions about using half & half in place of milk. Went awesome with the banana bread-bread pudding I made for an XMas gathering.

This is a good recipe.  It was not quite sweet enough for me, so I will adjust the sugar the next time.  I am making it for a bread pudding also on this website, and I'm excited to try it.  Once the sugar is adjusted to my taste, this sauce will be very addictive!!!  Thanks for the recipe KDA949.

Wonderful!!! I loved the suggestion of using a 1 Tbs of vanilla for 1 of the 3 Tbs of rum.  My Fiancee loved the sauce. He almost ate the whole bowl of it.

This rum sauce is so delicious; I could almost drink it!  I make it with Coconut Rum.  Use it to dip Baked Coconut Shrimp in (from this site by girlbob) and you won't ever order it at a restaurant again because you'll know yours is much better and healthier.  The taste of this combination is one of the best things you'll ever put in your mouth! mmmm!  Oh, and just an added note....it's very good with cooked shrimp but much more incredible using raw shrimp.  This is an absolute must try recipe!  You'll wish you tried it sooner!

Great sauce to accompany any bread pudding.  Followed the directions as written and the rum is not over powering.  The texture is awesome.

I LOVED IT and it's very easy/fast to make! I did use half & half instead of milk because I forgot to pick up milk and happen to have half & half on hand instead. I think it came out better with the half & half and a lot of others said they did the same.

Oh...so good.  I made this to go over an apple crisp with ice cream.  I didn't have half and half, so I used what I had, mostly whole milk plus a little coffee creamer.  Hey, it worked.  So so so yummy.

Very good recipe and easy!  It was a nice thick consistency.  I used half the sugar and 1 tbsp of vanilla extract instead of rum for the kiddos.  You don't have to mix the sugar and corn starch together before adding it to the melted butter. Less to clean up. :)

Great base recipe!  I substituted coconut milk instead of regular milk (lactose free).  I used half white sugar half brown, like another reviewer suggested and I used about 1 tsp vanilla and one shot of dark rum.  Delicious.

Absolutely divine recipe! Was great with my bread pudding. Just added a Caribbean twist with vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon and currants in a stew before serving. :)

This is the perfect sauce to go on my bread pudding!! instead of dark rum I used cruzan vanilla rum and a little cinnamon added made it wonderful.

This is a quick and easy sauce to make. I did it exactly as the recipe said. It has a strong rum flavor as it is added at the end. So adjust according to your preference. We enjoyed it. I had bicardi on hand so thats the kind I used.

Excellent and easy Rum Sauce. I made a double recipe, ended up with a quart of sauce, using one cup whole milk and one cup of half and half. It was very sweet, so I added 1/8 teaspoon of salt (double recipe), to cut the sweetness and it was perfect.  The rum that I always use for cooking is Myers Dark Rum, and it was delicious in the sauce. The color of the sauce was a pale creamy color, which was just fine with me. I used it over Paula Deen's Coconut Bread Pudding and it was scrumptious! Can't wait  to use on a good vanilla ice cream, and think I'll put some raisins in additional rum to soften and add them to the top of the ice cream and sauce. GREAT RECIPE!!!

This was fabulous, I did use half heavy cream half milk, 1 T vanilla and only 2 T light rum. Also, I boiled mine to thicken it more and to burn off the alcohol.

Absolutely the best!  I've mde rum sauce for bread pudding over 30 years; this is the easiest and very best. Only suggestion is to be sure to stir before serving.

I used skim milk and splenda and this was great with the rum... You could also use almond flavoring as well.

Such a simple and fantastic sauce! I made the recipe as listed with two small changes. I double the recipes and substituted 1/3 of the rum with vanilla extract. I see others adding 1/2 & 1/2 and heavy cream for richness, but I am not sure that it needed it. Perfectly sweet without being overpowering. Thanks for a great tool in the toolbox!

Excellent recipe.  I have used this drizzled on top of eggnog cheesecake, and it is sooo good.  I have not tried it on anything else, but I'm sure it would be wonderful also.

This sauce is wonderful! I made it at the spare of the moment and did not have any rum, so I used peach liquor and served it over vanilla ice cream. It was so good.

This was wonderful over homemade bread pudding. I halved the recipe, and for the sugar I used half brown and half white. I also used non-dairy creamer in place of the milk. I'm thinking it will be great over vanilla ice cream, too! Easy and delicious!

This was a moment saver when I had no cream or ice cream to put on blackberry cobbler. So quick and easy, and is less rich than heavy cream  or butter based sauces. I've made more sumptuous sauces, but I'll make this over and over again for its ease and lighter goodness. If you like saucy desserts count on six, not ten, servings of 3-4 Tbsp. each.

This is a wonderful recipe! I needed a sauce to serve with the banana bread pudding for our Christmas dessert and this was simple and delicious. This sauce saved Christmas...well, dessert, at least! I look forward to trying the variations mentioned by other reviewers.

This has excellent texture (be sure you cook as long as specified). I used 1 tsp. rum extract in place of the actual rum because I don't keep rum in the house. It was a bit too sweet and the color was very pale. Next time I will half the sugar and use brown sugar instead.

This was delicious.  I served with pumpkin bread from this site and it was a hit!  My changes:  I split the sugar, white and brown...split the milk with half and half and split the rum, light and dark.  This is a keeper!!

Great, easy sauce. I used brown sugar instead of white, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was so good over bread pudding!

Very good sauce for bread pudding.  I used
Dramboui in place of Rum.  I think next
time I will use 1 tbs of Dramboui in the sauce
and put the other two over ice and enjoy!

I used Jimacan rum because that's all I had and it was just too strong.  I will try recipe again but with less rum or using light rum instead.

This sauce was okay.  It wasn't very thick.  Maybe I should have used 2% or whole milk instead of skim milk.  I also used spiced rum as it was going over bread pudding.  The taste was good, but the consistency was not as thick as I would have liked.

This is a great recipe! I used half-and-half instead of milk and used a mix of white sugar and brown sugar, and, because I was serving it with a black russian bundt cake,I put creme de cacao in instead of rum. It was a hit!

Tried this today and it's a keeper.  I grilled sliced fresh pineapple, then poured the sauce on top of the pineapple(I added a little bit of coconut extract, I also used skim milk), then topped with mango sorbet.  yummmmmmm.  I may try it with brown sugar then next time I make it.  But as I made it, it's fairly fat/cholesterol free yet decadent.

I thought it was a very good rum sauce, though not like the one my favorite restaurant uses on their bread pudding, which is what I've been trying to copy. I followed the suggestion from other reviewers to use half and half, and I am glad I did. It kept well in the refrigerator for two weeks.

Made it with Captain Morgan 's spiced rum.  Very good.  Can't wait for the bread pudding to come out of the oven so we can try it on the pudding. Been dipping my spoon in the saucepan and by the time the bread pudding is ready I may be needing to make more sauce!

AH. MAZE. BALLS!  I added about 1/2 - 1 tsp of vanilla too - so I can't say if that made it any MORE amazeballs, but WOOOO! This stuff is CRACK on CRACK!

3 tablespoons of rum was too powerful for me.  I'll halve it next time.

It's delicious, but I cut the milk in half (I'm looking for a rum sauce not a milk sauce, after all) and used brown sugar instead of white. I also used dark spiced rum, and it came out a gorgeous caramel color. I imagine it would've been an odd milky white color with white rum? I won't try it, that seems unappealing to me.

I made it the first time with maple syrup instead of sugar (and 1/2 as much as the recipe calls for) and almond milk instead of milk. It was ok, but I don't prefer my hard sauce made with milk.
The second time, I made it with fresh apple juice instead of milk and added a sprinkle of cinnamon. I liked it much better this time. I think this recipe can be adjusted to fit the dessert it's going on, so I'll continue to use it as a baseline for my hard sauces.

Only change was to substitute half and half for the milk. Awesome flavour! Most definitely making this again.

Made this to use on Pumpkin Bread Pudding; used about 6 oz. half & half, (because I had it), then filled to one cup with milk. Used exact measurements for all ingredients for this first time making the sauce, and used dark rum.  I wouldn't change a thing!  I have always been "afraid" to make a sauce like this, but it was SOOOOO easy. Just make sure and stay with it,  stirring constantly.  Yum!

This is good as is...but I have played with it a few times...I like to use spiced rum or amber rum and I add it with the milk..I also like to add some additional nutmeg.

It was tasty but a bit pale in colour.  I used 2% milk and light rum.

Next time I will use whole milk or half-and-half and I will cook the butter, sugar and cornstarch a little longer to caramelize it before adding the milk.  

It took 10 minutes to thicken up as I kept the heat close to medium but it worked well.

Excellent! Didn't have rum, so used brandy and vanilla. Subbed brown sugar for white. Added the brandy while mixture was boiling to tone down the alcohol taste. Yum! Excited to try over my choc bread pudding.

I am glad I tasted this sauce before I served it.  When making it the directions seemed incorrect but I still followed them. It taste like rum and sugar mixed together. The directions are pretty much backwards and you never get to cook off the alcohal. If you skip the rum and cook the butter and sugar until caramelized then add the milk you get a pretty good butterscotch sauce. if you leave the rum and follow the original  directions you get the perfect rum drink for a 12 year old.

I made this rum sauce for my Christmas/Carrot pudding this year.... actually my daughter made it and she decided it would not make enough for our group and doubled the recipe.  It turned out to be the best rum sauce we have had in a very long time.  I was told to use Lamb's Navy dark rum to give it more flavour and OMG it was awsome!  The guests started drinking it as a liqueur comparing it to Bailey's!

Pretty good, but I thought it needed about twice as much rum.  I like a little bite to my rum sauce, not just a hint of the flavor.

This sauce is amazing.  I used it for bread pudding, however, it could be used for many desserts.  I did choose light rum so that the color was pretty.
