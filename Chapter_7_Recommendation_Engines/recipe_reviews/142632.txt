I have made this recipe twice since I found it and everyone raves about it!  The mustard and ginger are great compliments to the flavor of the salmon without being too over-powering.  I used whipped cream cheese so it was easier to stir and stuff the salmon. The second time I made it, I used half sour cream and half cream cheese and it had a great taste.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves salmon!

We've made this several times already and every time I'm amazed at how good it is.  Last few times my salmon was fairly thin, so I just took the stuffing and spread it on top instead.  This way, you can spread it out and every bite has some of the mixture.  If you feel it's too much, you can easily scrape it off.  I was hesitant about using the sesame seeds but they really compliment the dish.  Will definitely make again!

Wow, my boyfriend and i are generally fish haters but i wanted to try a salmon recipe that completely masks and fishy flavour. This is it! I actually enjoyed a piece of salmon for the first time in my life! I didn't have green onion so i just added a clove of garlic to the cream cheese mizture, so flavourful... i'd probably marinate the salmon for longer next time.

This salmon is the best I have ever had, and I love salmon all different ways. My husband is not a big salmon fan but is always asking me to make this, he LOVES it. I followed the directions exactly and it's amazing. I have given this recipe to so many people and have made this several times for company and it has been a big hit! It is a little rich but so delish.

This was an awesome salmon marinade! I didn't do the stuffing though. I replaced the honey with some brown sugar. I also cooked the salmon in the marinade. And I didn't have scallions. It turned out perfectly and I will make it again, and try the stuffing too.

This is a great recipe for salmon and cheese lovers.  The one thing I changed though was to use about half the cream cheese it called for.  I found the recipe to be a little too rich with the full amount.  I have made this twice and the second time was for company that raved about it.

Great flavors! My salmon filets were not thick enough to stuff so I topped them with a large dollop of the cheese mixture and they turned out just as good. Tasty and robust with the mustard. I realized later I forgot to do the teriyaki and sesame seed basting at the end but we still enjoyed it a lot. Thanks!

Strong flavor, but my husband and son liked it. Next time I will cut the cream cheese mixture back. I think that will make all the difference.

This meal is simply amazing.  We marinated the filets for over 6 hours.  By doing so, the salmon was completely saturated with flavour.  When I piped the cream mixture into the salmon, I made sure not to over fill the steaks so as to not overpower the fish or the marinade.  I also continuously basted the filets while they were baking with the marinade, then for the last 5 mins of cooking I basted the teriyaki/sesame glaze over it in spades.  The result was a rich, full flavoured dish that satisfied even the most discerning palates in our house.

The recipe itself sounds good... It sounds like it would work, but it just didn't for my family.

Too many mix of flavors, I think.

I wouldn't make it again... It wasn't that good, and it had a lot of ingredients that I don't normally buy, that I had to go "out of my way" for, if you will.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I marinated for longer than recommended and it still tasted like salmon and cream cheese.  The flavor was very one-dimensional.  Not a very dynamic dish.

This is an amazing salmon recipe. My husband, who turns his nose up when he sees the salmon thawing in the fridge, loved this.  I've always been a salmon fan, and this is excellent.  The cream cheese compliments the salmon so well.  I've made this at least three times in the last two months. Yum!

It was just okay, in my opinion.  I liked the idea of the cream cheese/green onion stuffing, but the result wasn't really anything special.  The return wasn't worth the extra effort.  However, the marinade was good.

My fiance doesn't like cream cheese, so I made his salmon without it, but used it on mine. I can honestly say this recipe is just as good without the cream cheese filling!

With a few altercations this salmon is a family favorite. This recipe is very good howeve I believe it needs a bit more balance. These modifications are for those who love flavor. First, I added a few dashes of sesame oil, half a lemon for acidity, and about 2 tablespoon of teriyaki to the marinade reserving enough to use on top of the fish oposed to the teriyaki because I'm my opinion the tariyaki is too sweet and the marinade is amazing so might as well put it to use. Next, I added lemon zest, a teaspoon of lemon juice, cilantro, a few grates of ginger, 1 dollop of daisy, and garlic powder to the cream cheese.top it with the remaining marinade instead of the tariyaki add the sesame. Delicious. Top with cilantro and squeezed lemon

Great recipe. I'm a fan of almost every part of this recipe. I usually server it over white rice. 

Changed two small things. Cook with about a quarter of the marinade poured over it. More importantly changed the Teriyaki sauce used to coat it with Teriyaki marinade. Creates a heavier glaze. I make this at least once a month. Sometimes I use more mustard in the filling but its not necessary.

The marinade was very, very tasty - and I especially liked the effect of basting with teriyaki at the end, but the cream cheese was so weird.  It seemed like the filling and the fish belonged on two separate planets, and no one in my family enjoyed them together.  I'd use this marinade again and skip the cream cheese.  (Incidentally, if you refrigerate the cream cheese for too long before filling the salmon, it will be impossible to spread.)

Love it! We're definitely salmon lovers, and I adore cream cheese, so this recipe seemed to be perfect for us. And it was! The only substitution I had to do was a little bit of chili powder instead of red pepper flakes (could have sworn we had some but they were nowhere to be found). And we added some minced garlic to the cream cheese part because we're garlic freaks! Like others, had to spread the cream cheese on top of the salmon instead of stuffing because we got thin salmon, but it works wonderfully that way too!

This recipe is wonderfully creamy and adds a new dimension to salmon. Living in Alaska where salmon are frequently caught by the ton makes me something of an expert on salmon recipes. I have to say that this is one of the most delicious and interesting ways to prepare salmon that I have ever tried. I have substituted thinly sliced onion for the green onion on occasion and it makes very little difference. 

I normally serve this on a bed of sticky rice cooked in a rice cooker with 1Tbsp of chicken bullion mixed into the water. It pairs very nicely with riesling or hard apple cider.

WOW! This salmon is amazing!  A little too much cream cheese though.  I also bake it with the marinade and then pour it over white rice.

delicious! I deboned and skinned salmon steaks, spread cream cheese on one side, rolled them, and secured with toothpicks.  The deboning is a lot of work, but worth it - a great special occasion meal. Baked 10 minutes then put a drizzle of teriyaki sauce on top and baked 10 minutes more.

Delicious BUT do not leave it mainadimg for more than 10 minutes unless you like salty foods. I left mine for the max time and it is super salty! Other than that it was delicious and it tasted like a cooked sushi roll.

Yum yum. Only change was I marinated it for the day. My hubby doesn't like salmon. Says it's too bland. He loved this and asked me to make it again. Top marks.

This recipe was delicious, but a little too rich for me. I will definitely make it again, but with half the cream cheese filling.

Pretty easy to make.  It was a nice change from the Dijon & pecan coated salmon I usually prepare.  We both liked it.

I am not a cook at all and I found this recipe so easy to shop for and to follow. My husband and I both loved it and frankly were surprised I could pull it off. We had pizza identified as a backup plan but there was no need!! :-)

This recipe has become a staple elegant dish in our family. My daughter who “does not eat fish” regularly asks for it and we also serve it to company. I make it as is with the exception of the soy sauce for the marinade ingredients, which I cut in half.

We enjoyed this on Christmas Eve as part of the Polish wigilia dinner.  As others noted, its pretty salty.  I think next time, I'll treat it like a Brine and rinse the fillets well before cooking.  That is what we do before smoking salmon.  I gotta figure out na better way to get the cheese mix in the split.

Filleted a whole salmon (enough for 10 servings), marinated it and baked it with the spread on top instead of slicing a pocket. I personally think the marinade is too strong (even on this whole fish) and masks the natural flavour of the fish.  Everyone liked it but didn't opt for seconds as they have in other recipes I've made.  My major concern is the sodium count; three times the recommended daily intake for one serving!!! It can't be too heart healthy.

I make salmon pretty frequently but this recipe now tops my list!  My whole family loved it!  I did forget the glaze and I spread the mixture on top and rolled the salmon around it but otherwise it was the same. Will cook the marinade next time to serve over rice and veggies.
