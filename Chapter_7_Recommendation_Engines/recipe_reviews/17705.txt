I'm sorry to have to say that this was absolutely awful.  Even picking off the chicken skin, you could still taste it on the chicken.  Warning to all: Do not try this recipe, it is horrible.

This requires too much work for such a sorry dish.  This was way too dry.  I cut it up into smaller pieces of chicken, but it just was not a good recipe.

Tried this once, the chicken was very tender and juicy, however, it's just weird.  The graham crackers make it too sweet for my family's taste.  Sorry, won't be saving this one
