I just wrote thyme in my original post, not dried, I always use fresh.... If you are using dried make sure it is good quality thyme or you will end up with it leaving a bitter taste in your mouth! If you don't like thyme just leave it out or try marjoram or savory instead....the cumin in it gives it that something extra.... I originally got this recipe from a friend who lives in the Greek Islands...For some reason the recipe only says 1/4 cup olive oil, I use 1/2 a cup or even amounts of oil to lemon and vinegar (my friend just uses lemon juice in the original recipe no vinegar, she uses 2 cups of olive oil to 1 cup of fresh lemon juice)

Awesome! My new favorite Greek recipe for summer. I used mushroom, zucchini, onion and red pepper.  The tomatoes I stuffed with a blend of feta, roasted garlic and basil, and served as an appatizer.  I also de-kabobed them and sprinkled with feta, everything better with cheese!  the flavors of the marinade are so amazing they should be brushed on everything.

Excellent! Light, refreshing flavors. I only had time to marinate for about an hour, but the flavor was still great. I added zucchini chunks to the kebabs (garden is overflowing with them!). Served over top of whole wheat pasta. Thanks! :)

Oooh, I made this tonight and it was lovely!  I didn't have the thyme so I used marjoram instead, but mmm mmm!  It is good!  Would definitely make again.  Thanks so much for this Dolce.  I let it marinate for about 8 hours and it was nice and juicy too.

Delicious!! Allergic to tomatoes so I did not use those. I cooked it all together stir-fry style in a skillet because my grill is 'out of order'. Had Tzatziki sauce on the side for dipping. It turned out great, will definitely make again.  Thanks!

These are absolutely delicious! I marinate my chicken overnight to give it even more flavor and it comes out so juicy and tender. It is time consuming to put all the ingredients on the skewer so I would not recommend this for someone in a hurry, but it is worth the time because it is so delicious and healthy!

This recipe is fantastic, I used fresh herbs, and it turned out delicious, I think it might even compete with my dad's bbq, which is a big deal. To the reviewer who thought this made it inedible, the only explanation would be either using bad ingredients or doing it wrong, but honestly it's hard to mess this one up. You can change it up with any type of vinegar, and use fresh hand squeezed lemon. I definitely will be making this one again.

I'll try to be as tactful as I can. The marinating time is too long. This affected the texture of it to the point that we found it inedible. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding fresh rosemary because I like it. It didn't help. The only flavor that came through was the acid. Even after it was grilled. I won't be making this ever again.

great summertime grilling- I sliced the chicken breasts lengthwise like chicken tenders instead of kebabs.  
they could also be grilled skewered like the NYC street vendors.

Great kabobs. I doubled the marinade and used it for the mushrooms too. They were definitely the highlight! Chicken was tasty too, but the mushrooms were fantastic. I love kabobs, and will be doing this one again for sure.

I made this for a camping trip.  It was just perfect.  I ended up letting it marinade for 1.5 days, which may or may not have made a difference.  Regardless, I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I really enjoyed this marinade.  We used basil instead of thyme.  Also, we didnt use  mushrooms, because I don't  like their texture.  Ate it  on greek flatbread with tzatziki, and it was great.  Will definitely make again.

Great flavor!  Made the marinade as written, but wasn't able to marinate for the full 2 hours.  Dipped whole roma tomatoes in the marinade as well and then put them on the grill.  Will definitely make this again.

The marinade in this recipe is fantastic! The flavors from it soaked into the chicken and it was really good! I also had some leftover marinade and decided to put the rest on the grilled veggies.

This was a fantastic dish! We paired it with black rice. The flavors just burst in your mouth and it was easy to make. I have been using left overs mixed with eggs and chia seeds in spinach wraps for breakfast. Or tossing the left overs into a salad. What a great dish to eat throughout the week!

Super easy and super good! All of the ingredients I had on hand! I did however substitute the dried herbs for ground ones and then just halved the amount. I love how its very light but still filling. This is a recipe I'll be keeping!

Excellent recipe. I marinated the chicken overnight and it was exceptionally tender. Other than that, I adhered to the recipe and loved it. Will definitely make it again!

I followed the marinade recipe closely using dried spices. In had one pound of chicken breasts. So, there was plenty of  marinade. I only marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes. I did put the chicken on skewers on the grill along with mushrooms, green pepper and zucchini. The chicken and vegetables cooked quickly on a hot charcoal grill. I kept an eye on it so that nothing burned.  I think this is delicious  and I will definitely make this again. It's a light, healthy meal and easy enough to put together. I really enjoyed this figure-fnriendly meal.

I substituted the chicken for beef and cooked it on the grill for only a few minutes. I made some cucumber sauce and with the pita cooked with olive oil on my griddle for a few minutes, it was as good as any open gyro I've had in any resturant! freezes well!

I liked it very much, but it was dry. So I served it on brown rice then I made the marinade for the chicken and poured it over the vegetables, meat and rice before serving. DELICIOUS!

Did it without the skewers and served with rice.  There were no leftovers from the 40 people I served it to!

I followed the recipe and instructions, but would not make this again as I found it to be a little bland.

Great results!  My family enjoyed it and that was a surprise because I have picky 12 yr old.  I used dry herbs and it was fine. I perfer my meat well done, so I will adjust the cook time to 13-15 mins.   I will make it again for Easter.  Thank you and Happy Easter to you.

Great meal.  Dolce is right about the thyme - if it isn't fresh and you're using dried make sure it's good quality.

The marinade wasn't the best.  I would make tweaks to the marinade so that the chicken comes out with more flavor.

this had very good flavor!!  I just sliced the chicken breasts horizontally to make them thinner, then marinated for a few hours and put on the grill.  Excellent!  I made a sandwich the next day by putting a leftover piece of chicken on a french roll and toasting it, added some fresh tomato and a little basil.  yummy!  will definitely make again!!
