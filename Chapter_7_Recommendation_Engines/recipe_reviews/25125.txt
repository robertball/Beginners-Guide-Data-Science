This is a conditional 5-star recipe, meaning that you have to know what kind of peanut butter cookies you like best in order to LOVE these.  They're more of a "peanut butter sandy"-type cookie, melt-in-your-mouth delicious and very, very peanut buttery, just like the recipe says.  They are NOT soft and chewy (no eggs); they ARE a bit on the delicate side, but I had no problem removing them from my cookie sheet after about 10 minutes and eating them still warm!  I am still in search of my perfect p.b. cookie (I don't care much for the soft ones), and these will do nicely until I find exactly what I'm looking for.  Yummy!

If you don't like these cookies, you're either not doing it right, don't like peanutbutter, or didn't let them cool long enough before removing from cookie sheet.  There is a warning about them being crumbly, they should not be gritty if you follow the recipe correctly, and there is NO way they should not have any taste if you are following the recipe.  If you don't like peanutbutter, don't try these because they are very rich with peanut butter taste.  Similarly, if you are bothered by crumbliness, don't try these.  They are a favorite in my family, but then again, we like peanutbutter (most pb cookies are bland; these are not), and we don't mind them being crumbly (but I ALWAYS let them cool A LOT before removing them from the sheets.)  If you want to try these, I wouldn't listen to the people who gave them bad reviews, but again, I wouldn't try these if you are not a fan of BIG peanutbutter taste OR if your cookies MUST have the perfect texture because these

All the reviews I read didn't prepare me for how truly crumbly these are.  Their texture is more of a sandy type cookie.  I gave it two stars because the taste was not great, very peanutbuttery but not great.  I added an egg and some more flour and they tightened up a little, but it wasn't enough to save them.

Be prepared.  Way too crumbly.  This cookie is not like any cookie I've ever had, even shortbread which tends to "crumbliness".  My teenagers thought they were weird and didn't like the taste.  Threw everything out.

You definetly need to bake these cookies for the full 15 minutes or they are fragile, but they are extremely tasty.  A wonderful rich cookie.

When they say crumbly they mean fragile.  Any little bump while these cookies are cooling will cause them to shatter.  
They are very grainy!  There isn't enough flour and too much sugar for my tastes.  
The kids found them super easy to make, and no eggs means no worries when they try to sneak some of the unclooked dough.
But I more than likely will *not* be making this recipe again.

I've been using this recipe for years, and I get people stalking me for these cookies.  I always use a silpat to keep from having some tragic sugar/burnt/pan accident.  These are not cookies you want to try to eat hot out of the oven! They sizzle in your mouth, and you will stop immediately!  Oh, yeah, they're delicate and they will crumble into soft dust if manhandled.  But after that first bite... they tend to get gobbled up!

I loved this recipe! If you like a noncakey cookie this is the one! I didn't add all that sugar though, the grainy responses scared me so I only added 1C sugar. It didn't fall apart on me like some responses said. Just leave on the sheet until they are COMPLETELY cooled. YUM! Great with a big glass of milk!

I tried this recipe about a year ago and thought it was disgustingly sweet.  However, being the open-minded person that I am, I figured that if it had so many good ratings from other people my initial impression had to be wrong. 

I'm pleased to find that it was.  I used a different peanut butter (Jif rather than Peter Pan) and also slightly increased the amt. of peanut butter.  This was a very rich, decadent cookie.  I don't know if I could make these regularly (none of my clothes would fit!), but they are a rich, buttery treat - almost like a peanut butter shortbread.

OMG these are so yummy!! I halfed the recipe, used margarine, and used chunky peanut butter because that was all I had. These turned out so well! They are just the right amount of chewy and crispy. Not crumbly or dry at all. The nuts in the chunky peanut butter enhanced the cookie! My husband loves them and I do too! I will definitely be making these again! YUMMM!

I will go ahead and give it 5 cause I needed a base recipe since I didn't have egg or milk. I changed my recipe to 1c sugar, 1c brown sugar and used margarine cause thats what I had and had to use 2T shortening to measure 1c. Also went ahead and use 1t vanilla,added 1/2t baking powder and skipped the boiling of h2o. Made sure oven was 350 and bake for full 15 minutes. Let them set for 1 minute before transferring to cooling rack.  A little chewy and crunchy at the same time. Dont over bake.

These cookies were unbelievably easy to make.  I had to use whole wheat flour and low fat peanut butter since that is all I had in the house.  The cookies still came out great.

I was in the mood for a good peanut butter cookie recipe the other day and tried this out.  I worried it would be too much sugar so I tried what one of the reviews said and cut it down to 1½ cups and added an egg.  I had to add a bit of flour at the end to thicken it up a bit for lack of sugar but it turned out soo wonderful!!!

Yum, Yum, Yummy! Thank you so much for this recipe. I am scared to make these again, as I ate almost the entire batch myself! I too have been searching for a peanut butter cookie that I could actually taste! This is it! The buck stops here! I loved these cookies! They were not too brittle. They stayed their shape. They were all around excellent! Thank you so much! YAY!!!

These were hard to put onto the pan and they were way to crumbly. They weren't very good either, so I wouldn't reccommend these unless you like cookies that have no visual appeal and no real taste. They didn't even taste like peanut butter cookies, they tasted like salt more than they tasted like peanut butter! Don't bake these, way to crumbly and no moisture in the taste. Thank you

I am a Reese's Addict.  These helped me greatly through withdrawls.  I had no eggs or milk and was able to find something EASY to make!  Wait until they cool before you remove from sheet.  
They are very DELICATE and texture is so light.  
After making fork marks, I sprinkled mine with chocolate mini chips and butterscotch chips before baking.  TASTES GREAT!

Good cookie, though it needs less sugar to reduce the crumbling and grainy texture.  Reduce sugar to about 1 and 1/4 rather than 2 cups.

I absolutely loved these cookies! I added 1 1/2 cups sugar like a previous member had suggested, and I didn't even notice the talked about crumbling. I let them cool thoroughly on the cookie sheet, and they were PERFECT.  VERY Peanut Buttery flavor, (which I loved) and wonderful texture.  Two thumbs up! ;-)

This cookie is my daughter's favorite peanut butter cookie.  She thinks the crumbliness of the cookie is why she likes it sooooo much.

Yuck!  I am a lover of ALL peanut butter cookies but these are NOT PB cookies.  I tasted the batter and it was really good (I am a vegetarian and thought it was fabulous raw).  But, they just crumbled into pieces when I tried lifting them.  I even tried cooling them on the sheet but no luck.  I got a few off without breaking to pieces.  Those were very grity.  The taste is very good but the recipe needs reworking!

The best part was throwing them away!!  Cooked for twice the amount of time required, but they were not even close to being solid.  Crumbly was an understatement,to say the least.  More flour, less crumble!!

Great cookies in general, very, very peanutbuttery. I replaced half the butter by apple sauce, as someone else suggested, and they weren't crumbly at all. My only complaint is that they were too sweet (and I LOVE sugar, but these are like fudge-sweet, not cookie-sweet) Next time I'll try them with 1 1/2 cup sugar (or maby even just 1 cup).

These have such a great peanut butter flavor!  I made just a few changes to lighten up a little on the sugar and fat.  I used Splenda in place of sugar, and instead of using a cup of butter, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup no-sugar added applesauce.  They turned out delicious!  I didn't have a problem with them crumbling, either.  But then again, they're being eaten as fast as I'm getting them out of the oven!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I LOVE THESE COOKIES!!!  Seriously, if you have made them and they fall apart on you, add 1 egg and they will be chewy as ever!  Also, I let them cool at least 10 minutes or longer before removing them.  One more thing...I made these adding 1 egg, 1 1/2 cups uncooked whole oats and 5 oz. milk chocolate chips and I am a HERO in my house!!!

These were GREAT!! the 1st peanut butter cookie (that I have tried) that tastes like peanut butter. Even though I didn't have the whole 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter.. it was more like 1 cup, I just reduced my flour a bit and I accidentaly put 1tbs instead of 1tsp of boiling water..I was a mess.... but the batter and my cookies were not... took them to my office everyone raved about them!!!
