I did not have milk so I used extra sour cream.  I used melted butter rather than oil. I baked it in a rectangular cake pan for ease, and  I made a lemon glaze rather than the canned frosting.  It's very sweet and moist.  I served it with lightly sweetened whipping cream.  Everyone was gaga.

This cake was amazing...unbelievably moist and full of flavor!  I was a bit skeptical of the ingredients but Iâ€™m glad I tried this recipe.  My only change was that I used lactaid milk and sour cream, but no one could tell that.  The 2 round cake pans cooked much quicker...my cakes were done in 35 minutes.  As ovens vary I would just caution you to check your cake after 30 minutes. My family loved the raspberry cake!  I also added lemon pudding as a filling between the 2 cakes...simply delicious!
