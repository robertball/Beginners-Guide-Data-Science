while baking the batter from a different moon pie recipe, i suddenly realized that i didn't have the incredients for the marshmallow filling.  i didn't want to waste the batter so i searched "all recipes" and found this recipe. i used the filing incredients for my batter and i must say it was very good. my family loved them.  i give the filing part of this recipe 4 stars !!!

Maybe others will have a better result. For me, I found it difficult to follow the directions, particularly after doubling the recipe, but the text of the recipe didn't likewise adjust. The frosting never did come out right, even after 45 minutes of fidgiting with it. I'd be interested in finding out how others have fared with this.

Just o.k. Cookie part was a bit bland and so was the filling. I might try it with butter and see if that helps.

I was looking forward to making this recipe simply because i'm from the south where moonpies are plentiful. This recipe is actually for a whoopie pie. I followed the recipe as is. The cookie was ok a basic chocolate cookie, The frosting was good as well but runny. I'd use a different frosting.

Aren't these whoopie pies...moon pie has graham cookies, using graham flour to make a graham cracker cookie, filled with marshmellow and dipped in chocolate.  That is a moon pie.  These are whoopie pie.
