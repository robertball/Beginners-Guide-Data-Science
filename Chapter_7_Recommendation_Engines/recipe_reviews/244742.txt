This sauce was tasty but extremely spicy. I had to add more honey and coconut sugar to tone it down.  It was good on wings but if you don't like them lightning hot, I would add only one tablespoon of red pepper flakes and less half of the portion of siriacha.

I eyed the measurements and felt they were off. Too hot, even for me. I used all of the ingredients, but to my taste. It ended up delicious! Thank you for the base!
