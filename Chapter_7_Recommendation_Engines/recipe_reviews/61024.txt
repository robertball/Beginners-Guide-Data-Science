Great orange flavor - tastes similar to restaurant Crispy Orange Chicken. The following changes should improve texture...
After frying chicken keep warm on baking sheet in oven. Reduce cornstarch to 2 tsp. and dissolve in 1 Tbsp. water before wisking into boiling sauce. Transfer chicken to serving platter and pour sauce over all.  Don't heat chicken in sauce or crispy coating will flake off into sauce. Broccoli, sweet peppers, carrots, snow peas, and/or scallions would be nice - may need extra sauce if adding veggies.

SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  What I love about this recipe is one can tinker with the marinade by adding more or less of something until satisfied before pouring over the chicken.  I had some leftover pineapple juice so subbed part of that for the water.  I also added 3 cloves crushed garlic, only lightly packed the brown sugar, was 2 tbsp shy of the rice vinegar so added more lemon juice to make up the difference.  I grated the rind of one whole medium orange which equaled 2 tbsp. and put the pulp from that orange into the 'brew'.  Didn't have green onion so subbed some red onion for that.  Thanks for the suggestion of the sesame oil...love that nutty flavor it gives.  I didn't coat the chicken w/flour.  I just heated some wok oil and stir fried it that way.  Added some red pepper chunks to the stirfry for flavor and color(yum) and served over basmati rice. I made the cornstarch slurry using orange juice instead of water. Garnished with cilantro.  This is a definite keeper...wish there were more stars. One of the best Asian dishes I have made so far...not too tart, not too sweet.  Just the right balance.  One would swear this came from the Chinese carry-out.

The only tips I can provide in a recipe like this one is to emphasize the need to -completely- brown the chicken on all sides, keeping stirring to a minimum.  The best option for this would most certainly be to use a wok.  Adding a touch of Sesame oil to the olive oil adds flavor, and doesn't add much cholesterol or fat.  Also, most Chinese restaraunts use batter-dipped chicken as opposed to this recipe's use of marinade and flour, making it a -much- healthier choice than ordering out.  All in all, fantastic variance on the Orange Chicken recipe.

This was great! I've made it twice already and followed suggestions from others like using less cornstarch and subbing pineapple juice for some of the water, also added a little sriracha for a kick and it turned out very flavorful.  However, if you want the breading to stick to the chicken, dip it first in a beaten egg mixed w/ a little bit of water (to thin it out) before rolling in the flour breading, this works really well...re-dip in egg and flour again for a thicker/crispier breading.  It's a little bit more work, but trust me it pays off because this way you can cook the chicken with the sauce at the end without worrying about the breading falling off.

Amazing!  This was so easy to prepare and it tastes even better than what you get in a restaurant.  For the sauce I used 1 c. of water and 1/2 c. of orange juice plus the juice of 1/2 of one small orange and then cut up the other half into small pieces and added that. I didn't have fresh ginger root, so I used powdered ginger and used a bit more garlic.  What I like about this sauce is you can modify it to suite your tastes.  I let the chicken marinate all day. (I might try this one on the grill over the summer).  For the breading I added a little garlic powder to the flour mixture and took the advice of another reviewer and dipped the chicken into egg thinned out with a little water.  The breading stuck to the chicken perfectly and after cooking I removed it then thickened the sauce. (start with a small amount of cornstarch and water 2 tsp. to 1 Tbsp. and thicken desired consistency) I served it over rice, and a vegetable medley of steamed broccoli, red peppers, baby corn, and carrots.

This was very good.  It was a little too strong on the orange flavor.  I think I would reduce the orange zest a bit.  I followed other reviews, and let the chicken stay crisp keep warm in a 200 degree oven after I fryed it.  When everything was ready, I served it family style in a big bowl.  I layered white rice, then a mixture of veggies (pea pods, carrots, broccoli, and mushrooms that I stir-fryed in a little of the sauce), the chicken, then I poured the orange sauce over it.  Finally, I topped with sliced almonds and crispy noodles.  Update:  I've made this again since my 1st review, and we've decided that this is definitly a 5 star recipe instead of the original 4 stars.  I think I finally found a good balance with the orange zest!

just a little note.  You must make sure to mix the water and cornstarch together thoroughly before adding it to the sauce.  If you still find the sauce to be starchy, next time you try it, you can leave 1 tbs of oil in the pan after frying the chicken and add the cornstarch to that and cook stirring frequently for ~5 minutes before adding the rest of the sauce...it will have the same thickening effect.  Hope that helps!

This was very good. I used Panko bread crumbs instead of flour. I also did not add the chicken back to the pan but kept it warm in the oven. I added at least a cup of chicken broth to the sauce into the pan and reduced it before adding in roughly 1 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch (mixed with liquid from pan) to the pan to thicken. Placed the chicken on top of rice then poured the sauce over the rice. There was plenty of sauce for the whole dish. This was soooooooo yummy.

This recipe has a wonderful flavour.  I added a lot more orange zest because I was craving a good orange taste and I also added a few drops of sesame oil as per another reviewers suggestion.  As for the cornstarch problem that everyone had been complaining about, a quick glance at the amount of sauce in the pot told me that the cornstarch measurement was WAY off.  I only used about 2 teaspoons with a bit of water and the thickness of the sauce was perfect.  I also added broccoli which really picked up the orange taste...delicious!!

This was delicious.  I made the mistake of not reading the recipe correctly and could only marinate it for about 30 minutes and it still turned out wonderful.  I also ended up using just a little more brown sugar and ended up grating the ginger.  Didn't measure the orange juice (just eyeballed it) and it was fabulous.  Hubby loved it and said he wouldn't mind eating this again.  Thanks for the post.

I have prepared this many times, talk about Asian comfort food! This is a simple recipe to double or triple when family or friends are coming over. I used a little trick taught to me by my Japanese Aunt many yrs ago, substitute half too all of the flour for corn starch. It makes fried foods much crisper and more true Asian texture wise. Also since I do not like the flavor of olive oil I always use canola or a mixture of canola and or bacon fat depending on what I'm frying, sauteing, or browning. I used all canola with the orange chicken and substituted cut up boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts 2 to 1 since dark meat is my favorite.

I really enjoyed making this. I had never marinated any meat before, but it was so much fun I am going to do it all the time now :-) We liked the taste, it was sour and yet sweet and I liked the fruity flavour of it all. Didn't have any rice vinegar, so used normal instead and it turned out fine. This is definitely going into my recipe collection!

Great recipe.  I used 1/2 pineapple juice and 1/2 water.  I also dipped the raw chicken in flour, then an egg mix ( 1T to one egg) then in the flour again.  I also mixed up some orange slices, rind and all during the last step.  Much better than any takeout.

I have been making this recipe for maybe 10 years, I got it off "Top Secret Recipes" website.  It is awesome. I feel it has way too much sugar though and it can easily be cut to 1/3 cup and reduce water to 3/4 cup and also reduce the lemon and vinegar by half.  Leave everything else the same.  From experience, I have found the marinade (w/the sugar) makes the chicken burn quick and also the oil splatters.  You can eliminate adding the marinade to chicken and instead just put some fresh garlic, ginger and a couple tablespoons soy sauce on the chicken.  Leave it to marinate and then proceed with the rest of the recipe for frying.  The marinade you made earlier is more than enuff to coat the finished chicken plus extra for rice.  Don't forget to reduce that conrstarch a little also before adding to the marinade.  Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onion for a pretty presentation.

OH.MY.GOD. This was absolutely wonderful! Due to time issues, I was only able to marinate the chicken for about a half an hour, so I can only imagine how delicious it would have been if it sat for longer! I used five chicken breasts, so I ended up doubling everything. I had extra sauce left over, and threw it into the freezer for the next time I make this (believe you me..there will be a next time) I didn't measure out the orange zest, instead I zested an entire orange and used that. I used ground ginger instead of ginger root, and it was perfect and easy.  I didn't follow the recipe for the cornstarch, instead I just eyeballed it and thickened it to my liking. There was a bit of flour that went to waste after dredging the chicken, so I think next time the flour mixture could be halved. Lastly, I found I needed more oil than what the recipe called for.  The flour would thicken the oil up, so more oil needed to be added as everything cooked. I kept my bottle of olive oil next to the stove so I could add it as needed. I also kept a baking sheet next to the stove, and as the chicken was done I threw it on there and put it into the oven at 200 degrees.  For about 5-7 minutes right before I went to serve, I cranked the oven up to 500 and let them crisp up again. After that, I threw it into a serving bowl and spooned some of the sauce over the chicken. Much less of a hassle than simmering the chicken in the sauce. It was delicious! I served it over white rice and everyone loved it.

This recipe is VERY GOOD!! I doubled the recipe because my family can put some Orange Chicken away!! Besides that I pretty much stuck exactly to the recipe. I didnt use your measurements on the cornstarch because I always just eyeball it. Also when frying chicken for any Chinese dish I usually use cornstarch instead of flour. It makes a lighter and more crispy coating!! And it also sticks better!! Try it!! I think it makes a huge difference!! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!! The family LOVED it and there wasnt a bite left!!

I made this yesterday but, althoough I adjusted the cornstarch amount, we didn't care that much for the sauce. The marinated chicken was very good but all in all, too much work for the so-so result!

I usually don't review recipes when I had to use a substitute (cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar and chili instead of red pepper flakes) but I just had to RAVE about this recipe. I have never had chicken this tender in my entire life. The acidic marinade made my chicken succulent and gave it a little zing. The sauce was delicious, sticky and sweet and I served it over fried rice. It was to die for! This recipe can definitely compete with chinese takeaway. I've been spending so much money on takeaway because I couldn't find a satisfying recipe to make meals like this at home. I will be making this again and again (and then some)

This was very good. I did change a little, I marinated the chicken in orange juice and soy sauce overnight, then fried up the chicken according to recipe. I then made the sauce (no onion) in the same pan and put chicken in sauce when it was thickened.  Very good

I made this in celebration of Chinese New Year last night and it was fabulous! If you follow the sauce recipe exactly, it will taste just like takeout.  Next time for more of a kick, I will add more lemon juice/vinegar and more pepper flakes for more of a tang and kick!
I have a tip for perfect breading: replace 1/4 c of  breading flour with cornstarch. It adds a little thickness to the sauce, like when you dredge steak for a stew. The result is a restaurant perfect breading that does not flake off in the sauce and has just the right crispy texture. 
I used 3 breasts, fried half at a time, and added them all to the pan at the end. Then I poured SOME of the sauce back into the pan (there was a ton, but I also used the marinade) and simmered until thickened, tossing chicken to coat. The rest of the sauce (1 1/2 cups I would say) I cooked in a little saucepan with a slurry to thicken, then poured over veggies and rice. You've got to try your breading with cornstarch next time! You won't be disappointed!

Overall, I think this is a good recipe with amount modifications. The flour seemed excessive & I used 1/2 cup rather than 1 cup the recipe calls for.  For those that wrote they had difficulty with the breading "sticking" or the amount of oil:  I used a stainless skillet (non-stick will NOT work as well) & used slightly less than the 3 TB of extra virgin olive oil.  Make sure your oil is hot (not smoking) & put the floured chicken in.  You should hear the sizzle if your oil is hot enough.  Let it brown before turning it.  If you crowd the chicken, it will steam rather than saute & your breading will fall apart.  I used a 10" skillet & did not have to add extra oil but I did have to fry the chicken 1/2 at a time.  In addition to the chicken I stir fried carrots, celery, onion & broccoli.  The corn starch slurry measurements are off & if you go by the amounts in the recipe, you'll have something with the consistency of wallpaper paste.  1 TBS of corn starch with equal amounts of water will do the trick.  Pour this into your sauce AFTER it comes to a boil & stir.  It will thicken up nicely.  To sum it up, this is a decent recipe.  I added stir fried broccoli, carrots, onion, & celery & had plenty of sauce.  I served this over brown rice.  By making your own you'll save money & can ensure the quality of your ingredients.

YUCK!  Sorry to be the dissenting opinion, but this was not to our liking.  The sauce was sickly sweet, and tasted of gloppy cornstarch, vinegar, and sugar.  That's it!  My husband (who will eat anything, and is always complimentary) finished his dinner in complete silence.  I knew he was trying to be kind, but I could see that he had trouble choking it down.  My two year old pushed it away saying "Ew".  'Nuff said.

Great orange taste!! I used 1/2c. water, 1/2c. chicken broth and 1/2c. orange juice and the rest of the wet ingred. This was delicious and my husband loved it. Per the reviews I used the egg white before the flour and I used garlic granules in the flour with salt and pepper.  The review that said to reduce the conrstarch was right.  I used 2 1/2 tsps.  I also kept the chicken warm in the oven and made the sauce, then tossed together before serving.  Great recipe.  Thank you Harry.

OMG!!!  This sauce is the best and so easy to make!!  Here's my tweek: Sub broth and/or OJ or pineapple juice for water. I used pulp OJ, as it adds flavor Didn’t measure the orange zest, but I know I didn’t use as much as was called for Used half the brown sugar. Will use honey next time to make it more healthy or even omit Used ginger powder, as good ginger is hard to find here. A few shakes was good for me Used way more garlic and garlic powder (not garlic salt), few shakes at least I used onion powder instead of onion. Didn’t measure, but a few shakes Added just a pinch of salt and pepper as well This made 3 ½ C of marinade  Definitely use 2 t cornstarch and 1T OJ or pineapple juice (instead of water), this was the Right amount to the thicken the sauce just right  For chicken, I used 4 breasts, 3 big and 1 small. I did cut the chicken into chunks instead of strips. I will do strips next time (oops!) I would recommend ¾ C flour. You don’t even really need to coat chicken with anything, it’s healthier to leave it. You could even just stir fry it w/o sauce and add sauce at end  Adding sesame oil to marinade and at the end adds nice flavor  After boiling it at end, I had between 1 C and ¾ C of sauce to pour over chicken and/or veggies (I used what I had: carrots and zucchini. If you have leftovers from a fryer chicken, leftover pork roast, almost any leftover meat (maybe not ham or ground beef!) would be good to use with this sauce. No more throwing out turkey at holidays!!

Delicious.  My tweaks:
Used 1 10.5 ounce chicken breast (only 2 ppl). Still used 1 T zest.  Juice from 2 oranges and 1 lemon (I like it orangier). 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 c water, 1/4 c vinegar, 1 T soy sauce, 1/4 t each garlic & ginger, 1 T onion, 1/4 t red pepper.
For my chicken, I mixed 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 c "00" flour (italian flour) with 1/2 t salt in a zipper bag.  I added my chicken pieces and let sit for 15 mins.
I simmered the sauce, then added 1 T cornstarch and 1 T water slurry to thicken.
Deep-fried chicken then tossed w/sauce and served over sticky rice.
SO crispy, not greasy a bit and perfectly orangey!!
We LOVED this!  Thanks!

This was the recipe that I've been looking for for years. I like to follow a new recipe to the letter so that I can review it honestly, but I did take into consideration the cornstarch issue of many other reviewers, so I added my cornstarch slurry slowly to the sauce til it was the right consistancy. Flavors were superb, just like our local chinese restaurant. Will be making this again, often.

I made a few changes to the recipe out of necessity, but I'm going to rate this recipe anyway, because it was amazing.  I was out of (1/2 tsp) fresh ginger root, so I used 1/4 tsp powdered ginger.  Also do not like heat in my food, so I left out the red pepper flakes.  Those are the only changes I made.  I was worried that the recipe called for too much rice vinegar, but it was great.  I can't get enough of this stuff!

This is another fav that I cook for my family! I slice up oranges and soak them in sugar, then put them in when the dish is served. It just adds that extra flavor. If your sauce is too runny, then simply add an extra pinch of corn starch, after boiled. The ginger adds a great taste! Serve it up on some fried rice with carrots. Sauce is creamy and rich. This is making me hungry. Also, battered my chicken in tempra to give it that authentic Asian feel. You can buy it at your local asian mart.

I cubed up my chicken in bite size pieces, coated them in flour and fryed each batch for 5 mins at med high in the deep fryer.  They turned out perfect, (no soon to be soggy chicken pieces).   I kept them warm in the oven and then poured the sauce over all the pieces once I finished.   This recipe is so good. Orange zest is the key, orange juice alone will not cut it.   If you do not use it, you will not get the good orange flavor everyone raves about.   I used one med. size orange and got all the zest off it I could and added the red pepper flakes to the sauce.   Follow the sauce recipe exactly.   Do not modify and you will not be disappointed.

I made the orange chicken tonight and boy was it a hit.  I was nervous so I followed the reciped exactly (except the green onions) it came out perfectly.  I will DEFINITELY be making it again.  The only thing I would advise other people about is, before I reheated the remaining sauce I strained the bits of ginger out of it.  It was great.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  It's definitley one of my new favorites!

This recipe was perfect on the first attempt. The chicken tastes as if it came from a Chinese restaurant. I had never cooked Chinese food before this meal and I will definitely be cooking this again. It was not difficult to make at all. We served this with white rice and stir fry vegetables, and I feel like we were eating our favorite dish at the restaurant that rhymes with smeeshe shake smactory.

I agree with others that said this was a gloppy mess. I apparently made the same mistakes because the flour on the chicken only served to make the sauce like Jello. It was way too thick and lumpy. The sugar is way too much, the corn starch and/or flour is way too much and I wasn't even a fan of the amount of garlic. I followed the recipe exactly and thought I followed the direction exactly. So I'm not sure what went wrong. I won't be trying this again.

I have made this dozens of time now... we love it in our house! I prepare almost exactly as written.  To make things a touch easier, I just squeeze the juice of the orange I zest, I don't measure the orange juice.   I use a little more than 3tbsp of oil to cook the chicken in.  The LESS you touch/stir the chicken, the better your chance of it turning out crispy.  Mine works out beautifully.  I do not mix the chicken with the sauce, I served it on the side, so people can use as much or little as they want.  Fabulous, easy recipe.

I also have made it last minute (without a chance to marinate the chicken).  I just toss the chicken in a bit of the sauce before I dredge the chicken in the flour.  It still turns out delicious.

WONDERFUL!!! took the advice of previous reviews and was careful about adding the cornstach till i got it to the consistancy that i prefered it. The flavours were wonderful. I made it two nights ago and have already had requests to do it again.

It is time consuming but I loved it and so did my family. I did lessen the zest as others mentioned it may be too sweet. I also saw reviews that combined cornstarch with the flour mixture to coat the chicken, and I did keep it warm in the oven so the breading wouldn't fall off in the sauce....BUT I couldn't resist not putting it back in the sauce, whereas others poured it on top after the fact. I wanted it to absorb the flavour however this does take away from the crispiness, but it's still sooooo tasty. Thanks!!

Made this gluten free by using gluten-free flour and wheat-free soy sauce.  I didn't have any rice-wine vinegar, so I used red-wine vinegar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great!  It has a strong, exotic, sweet, tangy, orange flavor that is better than any orange chicken I've had.  Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I thought the amount of cornstarch was just right.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Overall, the dish was tasty. However, the sauce was a little too thick after adding the corn starch. I would cut back to 1 Tablespoon next time. Also, the breading fell off of the chicken. Dipping the chicken pieces in egg before coating them with batter is probably a good idea.

We loved this.  I didn't marinate the chicken in quite a full cup of the marinade because I wanted plenty left over for the sauce.  I also marinated in a tupperware rather than a bag.  To avoid the problems with the chicken's coating falling off, I mixed the water and cornstarch thoroughly, added the reserved sauce mixture to that, cooked in a small pan long enough to heat through, and then added to the hot skillet with the chicken.  (I used less oil than was called for, so I didn't have any leftover oil in the pan to remove.)  It thickened up perfectly, and got rave reviews from my husband and me.

I gotta say, this was really good.  The kids (9 and 11) liked it better than Panda Express.  I definitely kicked it up a notch though with extra chili pepper flakes and my personal secret hot pepper blend.  Served over a 50/50 rice & orzo blend with diced nectarine cooked into the rice.  Heavenly.  A lot of steps, but something I will certainly make again.  Bravo!

The sauce was really good but the flouring part and cooking times were just off. I didn't like the flavor at all of the flour coating and it was too time consuming for such mediocre results. Plus it took my chicken more time to cook then the alotted time it states in the recipe. Next time I will make the sauce and prepare my chicken some other way.

This was terrific!  I used a bit more orange juice than called for, but left everything else in the ingredient lineup the same.  

Used brown rice and followed instructions of another review and reserved the fried chicken aside.

I sauteed onion, pepper, celery, carrot and turnip greens separately and reserved.

I put rice on the place, sauteed veggies on rice, then chicken.  Top with generous portion of sauce.

Delicious!

EXCELLENT! I couldn't believe that I had actually made what we were eating, it was that good! The only thing I did differently was I used a tangelo instead of an orange for the zest, I added some garlic powder and chili powder to the flour coating for the chicken, and I reduced the cornstarch as other reviewers recommended. The sauce will look thin in the pan but once you add the chicken and simmer it thickens up more so don't be deceived. I made mine too thick, but it was still delicious. Definitely a keeper!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It was very good, but a bit labor intensive. It was pretty sweet, and I personally would have preferred more heat. Still, we live in a place where good Chinese food is hard to come by so we enjoyed it!

Unfortunately we didn't like this! I used two huge chicken breasts and added some peas, yet there was too much sauce. I also only used 1/4 C of sugar as other reviewers suggested, yet it was way too sweet. I'm bummed!

I made this dish not straying very far from the original recipe.  I thought it was delicious and my sister and brother-in-law (both picky eaters) loved it as well!  I will definitely be making this again.

The sauce for this recipe is amazing!! I gave it 4 stars because I agree with most of the other reviewers in that you should NOT add the chicken back to the sauce, but cook it long enough so that it crisps up a bit more, then serve the sauce on top of the chicken.  Amazing recipe!!!

I made this dish gluten free by using gluten free soy sauce and didn' t flour the chicken.  To thicken the sauce, I added corn starch to about 1/2 C of sauce and mixed into the rest of the dish.  I added red and yellow peppers and onions. I didn't have an orange, so I used a mandrin.  My husband's only request was to deep fry chicken next time, but we don't need that!

This dish made me very happy!!! Great orange flavor, but not overpowering.  Perfect texture on the chicken, perfect consistency of the sauce.  So close to restaurant taste without the added MSG we don't need.  Very fresh tasting.  Love the heat.  Kids also loved it, so we will definately be making this again!!  Doubled the sauce, used with about 3 lbs chicken.  Used regular onions minced, and half white sugar.  Thanks Harry for the amazing orange chicken recipe!!! Now to find the perfect general Tsao's chicken that's this easy and without a million ingredients!

I thought the sauce was quite bland. I ended up adding extra soy sauce and some rooster sauce to my serving, and it was much better. I might make this again, but sub something else for the water.

OMG.. So good!.. I added broccoli and carrot at the very end that I steamed.  The subsitutions I made were to add some garlic powder to the flour and I used a tsp. of worcestershire instead of the soy sauce (I'm allergic to the soy sauce)  switch the amounts of orange juice and lemon; I wanted more orange flavor and so glad I did!.. I used chicken broth for the water in the sauce!.. I would have given this 10 stars if I could; it really tasted a lot like the Chinese chain restaurants orange chicken but healthier!  Oh and guess what I only marinated it about 30 min; next time I think I'll ad a bit more red pepper flakes and less corn starch as the sauce was a bit too geletinous  :)

I doubled the recipe and am glad I did. Used the extra sauce to put over stir-fried veggies (snow peas, matchstick carrots, baby corns, and green onion) and Jasmine rice. We prefer chicken crispier, so I did not add the chicken to the sauce: just served on the side, instead. Next time will decrease the lemon juice: was just a little too prominent, for our tastes. Will make again. Thank you, Harry Weitzel for sharing.

I marinated the chicken overnight and I might have also added too much orange zest. (While I was putting the marinade together I anticipated not enough orange flavor) So this came out a little too flavorful for us, but I'm going to blame myself for that. I added blanched broccoli to the stir fry. We'll make this again, but I might try using less sugar next time.

I added a few extra veggies to shine along with rice and paired with fresh "Fava Bean Salad" on this site. Restaurant quality dish. Oh and I didn't marinate the chicken at all, I just made the sauce and cooked the chicken.

I halved the brown sugar and still found this very sweet.  I served it with stir-fried vegetables over white rice.  The chicken itself was very good.  I doubled the sauce, anticipating needing more, but didn't need more sauce.  When I use the remaining sauce I'll use fresh stir-fried vegetables, rather than frozen, and add water chestnuts and thin slices of orange, halved, for more orange taste. Overall, this dish is just too sweet for us.  We enjoyed trying it, though. Thanks for the recipe.

UPDATE: I'M CONTINUING WITH MY MISSION TO GIVE THOSE RECIPES I GAVE SUBPAR REVIEWS A SECOND CHANCE. THIS IS ONE OF THEM. THIS TIME, I MADE A FEW CHANGES. I FRIED MY CHICKEN IN BATCHES (2 TOTAL), CUT THE SAUCE IN HALF AND ADDED A CORNSTARCH SLURRY (I LISTENED TO MY OWN ADVICE LOL). PERFECT! This was just so-so. I've made many Asian dishes over the years, but they never ended up like this. Having said this, I should have fried my chicken in batches, starting with HALF the amount of oil called for and using the rest for the second batch. Some of my chicken fried up nicely, but a lot of the breading fell right off. My second hurdle was with the thickening step. You should NEVER add cornstarch to a boiling mixture! It will clump instantly, even if mixed with water FIRST! You need to add your cornstarch slurry to your sauce, THEN bring to a GENTLE boil, stirring constantly for a couple of minutes until thickened. Not only was my sauce unappetizing because I didn't adhere to my own advice (duh), there was also WAAAY too much of it (my gosh!). The sauce was really good (the best part of the dish, IMHO), but I could have easily used HALF the amount called for and wish I would have. Fried rice, egg rolls and green tea completed our meal. Broccoli would have been a great addition (and would have mopped up some of the sauce), but because my husband has an aversion to it, I didn't add any. A nice attempt, but this totally missed the mark at our house. :( Thanks anyways, Harry.

This was good but the grated orange peel made the sauce a little bitter even though I was careful not to get any pith in it. I felt it also needed salt. We did enjoy it but I have other recipes I like better. It was basically just sweet. The red pepper flakes were nice but it needed something else, I don't know what.

This was really good, however, I made a few changes to suit my family and to accomodate what I had in my kitchen already. With these changes it was fabulous.. 1/8 lemon juice and 1/8 orange juice instead of 1/4 lemon juice, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 teaspoon ginger and completely deleted the red peper. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it, however, you do NOT need to marinate for 2 hours.  I only marinated it for 30 minutes while the rice was cooking.  Just like a restaurant recipe.  Second time I made this, it's lemon season, so I just replaced will all lemon juice.  Used 1/3 cup lemon juice (about juice of one lemon) and used lemon zest.  Yummy!!!

My boys love the orange chicken from Panda Express so when I saw this I thought I'd give it a shot. They loved it. I halved the sugar and I thought it was very sweet. This is why I rated it only 4 stars.  I think with the amount of sugar called for it would be far too sweet. The other change I made was to strain the extra sauce before heating and thickening.  Make sure you use a fresh orange and lemon. It was really good!

Great recipe with room for versatility based on what you have at home.  I second the reviewer to dip in egg prior to the flour; it kept the breading on well.  I should have mixed the cornstarch in the water prior to adding to the mix as it clumped.  Regardless, it tasted delicious - truly like a restaurant dish but healthy & homemade.  Kids liked it as well.

Delicious! Excellent orange chicken recipe. I will minimize the red pepper flakes next time because it was too hot for the kids. Also, I used panko bread crumbs instead of flour and I did soak the chicken pieces in egg wash before coating them with the crumbs.  I did not mix the chicken pieces with the sauce instead pour it at the end while serving. Sauteed broccoli and mushrooms made great sides on our plates. Tasty and yummy!

great recipe ! the only thing i would change is the amount of cornstarch, definitely will put less next time. i had to add about a cup of water to get the consistency of the sauce that i wanted, and the flavor was still potent. other than that it came out great and tastes really good!!

This tasted pretty good - but more like a sweet & sour chicken than an orange chicken you would get in a restaurant.

Lots of steps for this recipe! It was good, but not sure it's worth all the effort. Not very orange-y. I would make it again, but I don't think I would worry about the marinating step next time and just adjust as needed for the sauce.

This was a great dish but next time we are skipping the flouring part. It just came right off and made the sauce weird. But the flavor was perfect!
Yes! Skipped the breading and it was amazing! Made it with Chinese Chicken fried rice II on here. Yeah, highly recomend.

This was delicious. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. The only issue I have with this recipe is that I'm not a big fan of using another bag to store the flour. Just use a bowl to mix the chicken marinade with the flour. It's easier that way.

Had fresh snap peas from the garden and sliced green onions, layed (raw) on top of cooked chicken in the serving bowl. Like other reviewers, I waited to pour on the thickened sauce til I right before serving. I had a little difficulty turning all those pieces of chicken in the pan, but it was worth it. I had bought some boxed frozen orange chicken a month before and it can't even compare to the flavor in this dish.

This recipe was my foundation for a great "quick" orange chicken.  5 star flavor for sure, but easy to tweak for my teenager's love of spicy food.  I made the sauce with a few tweaks: juice of 1 orange and 1 large lemon, little extra rice vinegar, 3/4 c br. sugar, extra garlic, and added both ground red pepper and flakes.  I forgot the ginger, but it was still delicious.  Thickened all the sauce with cornstarch, then spooned half of it over "freezer honey garlic breaded boneless chicken breast bites", and baked at 400 for 10 min, then turned, spooned on a little more sauce, and baked 10 min more.  Total deviation from the recipe, but my daughter declared it the best orange chicken she had ever had.  Served the extra sauce on the side for extra spicy goodness.  Thanks!

I knew this marinade would be good but it turned out amazing! This is a sweet marinade and is nicely flavored with orange zest and juice. I used 1 Navel orange, zested, and its' juice for the 2T of the orange juice called for. I reserved the rest of the juice to add with sauce mixture. Cooling the sauce took me about 30 minutes. Also, the sauce thickened up nicely and I poured it over the chicken with semi-cooked broccoli. Loved the sweetness of orange sauce and the broccoli for added texture. I served it over hot rice. YUM!

I loved the orange in this all the way around.  The chicken was great and the flavor of the sauce was great.  My only issue was that the sauce was way too thick and I had to thin it with about a cup of water.  Next time I will start with just  1Tbsp of cornstarch and add more if needed.

AWESOME!  Followed the directions and the ingredients exactly, (except I omitted the red pepper flakes) and it was perfect.  Oh yeah and I didn't stir in the chicken into the sauce at the end, instead I served the chicken separate with the sauce on the side (kids are picky like that).  It was hit.  Next time I might add just a tad bit more brown sugar (kids liked it but thought it was a bit too tangy for their taste).  However hubby and I thought it was better than Chinese Restaurant style could ever be!  Thanks a bunch!

I have to say this is one of my favorite Asian dishes that I have ever made. I added a little bit more red pepper flakes than called for. I always like to tone down sweet recipes with a little added spice! I also cut the brown sugar to about 1/3 cup and the chicken still turned out very sweet! This chicken goes EXTREMELY well with fried rice and broccoli. The sweetness of the chicken really compliments the saltiness of fried rice. Overall, great dish! I will definitely be making this again.

Husband really loved this.. unusual for him, as he is not crazy about 'new' recipes. I may decrease the OJ just a bit next time- seemed to me a bit more 'orangy' than I like. Otherwise was great, and I will definitely make again.

I am not sure what I did wrong but this turned out a gloppy mess! Thing is I am a cook in a restaurant and when I saw the corn starch to water ratio for the sauce I was concerned. The regular ratio is 1/2 water to 1 tablespoon of cornstarch so when I saw 3 tablespoons of water to 2 tablespoons of cornstarch I was QUITE concerned but thought "well with so many great reviews, maybe it works" The sauce to me was a gloppy mess and way way way too thick. I may try it again but use the corn starch to water ratio we are taught in school and actually fry the chicken pieces like another reviewer said. My chicken didn't have an ounce of breading left on them because the gloppy mess stripped them. Also the sauce was so thick it sat ON TOP of the rice like a custard. Not appetizing to me but again I may have gone wayward somewhere.

I really like orange chicken and have never found a package dinner from the grocery store that has a good flavor. So I thought I would try making it myself and I have to say that the flavor in this recipe is SO good! The only thing that I didn't like was the coating. Maybe it was just my pan, it's an older one and used to be non-stick but probably isn't any more. Anyways, the coating really came off and got mixed into the sauce. It still tasted wonderful but next time I will take the advice of other reviewers. I saw a few reviews that stated this might happen and they also gave a fix. So I'll try that next time. I will for sure make this again, we still all ate it, it just wasn't the best presentation ever :)

Fabulous! Made this on the fly without marinating the chicken and it went over so well that there were no leftovers! 
I fried the chicken then set on a paperbag lined cookie sheet and set in the oven at 350 until it was all done.  Kept it warm and crispy.

My fav takeout has a really strong orange flavor so I did 1 c. oj and 1/2 cup water.  I went  a scant 2 T on the (low sodium) soy and it was just right.

Great recipe- easy to follow.  I followed the advice of others and kept the sauce to pour over the top instead of tossing it to keep the breading on the chicken.  This took a little more time than I like to spend on a weeknight but this is a great weekend meal.

I'm sure this isn't a fair or accurate review, but too bad.  I made just the sauce from this recipe to use as a drizzle.  It didn't thicken up as I hoped it would, and there wasn't a ton of orange flavor.  I ended up using cornstarch to thicken.  Perhaps next time I'll use orange extract and simmer longer.

I didn't realize you had to marinate the chicken before hand, so I basically made it all at once and skipped that marinating part.  This was so good. My hubby thought I bought the sauce from the store.

This was so unbelievably delic! My husband loved it. Made it for fathers day! He always orders either General Tsao's chicken or sweet and sour chicken at the restaurants or takeout and he said this tasted just like a cross between the two. The only thing I did different was added some panko to the mix and added vegetables (broccoli, red pepper, chestunuts and carrots) I also substituted some hot sesami oil for olive oil..gave it a nice kick...I topped mine off with some garlic chili hot sauce! Was soo yummy!

It didn't make it to the plate.  I added more red pepper flakes, and the orange rinds to the sauce.  My husband said it was as close to our favorite place in Seattle as to anywhere we're had in the whole state of Georgia.  Thanks for the recipe.

We LOVED this recipe, and it will go into our rotation.  I read reviews and made the following changes to the original recipe: Used OJ in place of water for the sauce. Changed quantities to: 1 1/2 Tbsp orange zest, 1 tsp minced fresh ginger root, 1 tsp minced garlic, 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes. I used OJ with the cornstarch instead of water, and browned the chicken completely on both sides in equal amounts of vegetable oil and sesame oil.  I placed the cooked chicken in a glass baking dish in a 250 degree oven while cooking the rest of the chicken. I cooked the sauce, but did not add the chicken back to the pan. Instead, I drizzled the sauce over the chicken and then gently mixed it and immediately served it over some fluffy basmati rice. We can't wait for the leftovers!  Delish!

My husband and I love Chinese food, but I don't cook it often.  I made this last night and it was fabulous!  I didn't have any orange zest, so I omitted that.  The ginger I had was ground, not fresh, but that worked just as well.  I doubled the sauce/marinade to have extra for the white rice I served with it.  By doubling the sauce, the original cornstarch measurements were just right...if I only made a single batch of sauce, I would have decreased the cornstarch as others have.  I also coated the chicken in cornstarch seasoned with salt, pepper and more ground ginger.  This turned out just fine and crispy too.  The next time I make this, I will bypass the marinating.  The fact that the sauce is so flavorful really makes the marinade a moot point, I think.  This will cut down on the prep time as well.  I'm also thinking of making just the sauce ahead of time and keep portions in my freezer.  This would really make my cook time come down a lot and with 3 kids under 4, I'm all about the less time I have to spend in the kitchen, the better!  Thanks for the great recipe!

The only change was that dipping the chicken in the flour then egg then flour again. Served with Jasmine Rice recipe from this site. Nice easy dinner.

I absolutely loved this. However, my husband and daughter thought it was too sweet so maybe next time I will cut the brown sugar in half.  I like it sweet, but as to compromise :(  They also thought it was too orangy?? Well I told them IT IS orange chicken!  All the while they were saying it was too sweet and too orangy they kept eating it and there were no leftovers!!!I also did not have an issue with the chicken not staying crispy.  I mixed bread crumbs in with the flour, dredged in flour/breadcrumb mixture, then egg, then flour/breadcrumb mixture again. I used more oil to fry chicken in as to get a good crispy crust. I had to cook the chicken in 3 batches, keeping it warm in the oven in between.  I poured the sauce over the finished chicken before serving. To me it was great.

Well--it DID taste like restaurant Chinese food--very rich and sticky.  The sauce developed nicely--good thickness.  DO NOT use olive oil when cooking the chicken--use sesame or lightly flavored.  The olive is a bit overpowering.

I made a vegan version of this recipe. I substituted the chicken with sliced mushrooms. There isn't a big difference! The sauce was a little too bold for my guests, but I loved it.

Followed this recipe EXACTLY - I always do the first time I make something - and it was nothing at all like orange chicken from Chinese restaurants. My whole family only would eat a bite or two and they all agreed this was bland, the chicken was soggy and it lacked anything at all like what you eat at the restaurant. Cooking the chicken in 3 tb. olive oil made all the coating fall off and stick to the bottom of the pan. It wasn't crispy at all. Will never make this again for all the work and time it took.

This recipe is too time consuming. I gave this a 4 because there is no need to marinate, coat, add corn starch to the sauce, etc. just reduce the amount of water you use and cook the chicken in the sauce in a large saucepan in med high heat  for 15-20 min the sauce will reduce to the perfect glaze and it doesn't require all kinds of prep.

Serve it on vermacelli noodles or with brown rice.  Add veggies (mushrooms, red bell pepper, carrot sticks, celery, and onions).  Add sauce over chicken just before serving.

I made the following changes: 1) I used an egg when coating, and had the best-looking, crunchiest chicken bites ever! 2) I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cups. 3) I used 3 parts water, 2 cornstarch, and not the other way around. 4) Finally, I poured the sauce over the chicken, instead of simmering together. I served it with Chinese chicken fried rice 2 (minus the chicken, of course) from this site, and it was delicious. Thanks, I'll make it again.

I really cheat on this one and buy frozen, breaded chicken bites. Deep fry them, make the orange sauce as directed. And pour the sauce over the chicken and rice/ I also steam veggies in the top of my rice steamer at the same time. Quick meal in less than 1/2 hour and not all the mess of breading the chicken yourself.

This Orange chicken recipe is WONDERFUL! It blows away anything I have ever had for take out. The flavors are all there. I am a well above average cook and this is the best. I did not change a thing and it came out perfect. I served it over white rice. DO NOT change a thing and simply enjoy

I've made this dish time and again and it always impresses. The orange flavor is absolutely wonderful and the sauce is perfect. Followed other suggestions about NOT putting the chicken in with the sauce at the end. I serve it over plain white rice and there are rarely ever any leftovers.

The chicken was very flavorful and tender. I put the chicken back into the sauce and the breading fell off. Next time I will keep it in a warm oven and pour the sauce over before serving as suggested by others.

Very tasty!  Also tried the sauce with 5-Spice powder for a little variation.  Added wonderful depth.  Served with stir-fried broccoli and brown rice.  Even my picky 5-year-old ate every bite!

GREAT dish Harry!! I don't care for orange zest so I left that out, but I did add much more OJ than stated. In lieu of water, I used chicken broth and to make it more of a complete meal, I added broccoli. My youngest daughter is the Asian food queen and she loved it and said it tasted just like take out from our local Chinese restaurant. Thanks so much!

Excellent one here. the only thing i altered was cutting down the vinegar, and instead of pepper flakes i used whole dried red chilies. After smelling the sauce i was sure this would be awful but don;t get discouraged, it all comes together in the and for a spicy citrus treat.

Oh Wow!!! So tasty and flavorful! My husband raved during the entire meal. I added extra orange peel for true orange flavor and I am glad I did! Definitely agree with other reviewers, taste just like Cheesecake Factory's! Yummy. I served with steamed broccoli spears and jasmine rice. Next time, I will double the sauce!

The sauce is really, really good, over the top!  However, the breading for the chicken needs some tweaking.  It either fell off or came out gummy.  I will make this again but only after I fix the breading.

First off I used premade breaded chicken tenders.  I followed the sauce directions exactly.   After deep frying the breaded chicken tenders I drizzeled the sauce over the chicken.  It was wonderful!! I loved it and more important my family loved it!

i had to make this twice today.  once for me for lunch again for my girlfriend when she got home for dinner.  i used to work in a chinnese restaurant so i know a little about cooking asian food.  this was realy good but i made it a little diferent and it came out really good.  i use boneless skinless chicken thighs and battered them with a flour/water/corn starch mixture.  heated up enough oil in a  wok to cover the chicken and dropped them in.  cooked the chicken and removed.  then with just about a tbspn of oil in the pan i put in the garlick, ginger and fresh orange peels and cooked for a minute.  then i added all the ingrediants wich i already had mixed up in a bowl.  i dumped the chicken in with the sauce and thickened it up with a water/corn starch mixture which i already had made to ensure the texture of the sauce came out perfect..!

This was very tasty.  I must have done something wrong because most of the breading fell off in the frying pan, but the taste of the chicken and the sauce was delicious.  

I marinated the chicken for 24 hours, so that might be why it was so good.  I also kept it warm in the oven at 250 degrees while I was making the sauce.  And since most of the breading was off the chicken already, I didn't want to lose any more, so I just poured the sauce on top.  

I'll definitely be making this again.

This was very tasty!  We thought it was a bit too lemony, so I will use more orange juice and less lemon juice next time.  I didn't bread and fry the chicken, just marinated overnight and then cooked in a pan with a small amount of oil.  Thanks!  We will definately have this again.

The recipe was great, but I left out some steps in the interest of time.  Instead of marinating the chicken first I just cut, breaded, and cooked it.  I then added it to the sauce and let it all simmer for the 20 minutes it took to cook a pan of rice.  It still turned out wonderful.

This does taste restaurant quality. Unless you fry the coated chicken in the oil to get it really crispy, it stays soggy. It tastes good without coating the chicken.
It is neither orange or citrus enough for me.

Generally this recipe is pretty tasty and relatively easy.  The issue that I had was with the amount of starch.  3 tablespoon is way too much.  When I followed the recipe it all clogged up so I was able to pour in only a fraction of the 3 TBLS and the sauce became very thick even with that small amount.  Also next time I will not panfry the chicken but place it in as is in order to save the calories and fat.

Yes I made it and I am a huge fan of  Orange chicken especially at a few of my favorite Chinese rest. This recipe is very good. I don't like it spicy so I used 1\4 to of red chili pepper and it was still great. Try it with Jasmine rice for a real treat! Also I use corn starch instead of the flour for the chicken coating....more crunchy and lighter. The Chinese always use corn starch!!

The sauce was terrific with just the right of thickness and amount of orange flavor. 

This rating is just for the sauce portion of the recipe, which I found really nice.

This was good, and with a little tweaking could be great. Next time I plan to decrease the sugar, as we found it too sweet, and would also add more crushed red pepper and possibly sriracha to give it a little more kick. Also, may try some of the other reviews and sub in cornstarch for some or all of the flour. Served over jasmine rice with some broccoli (which we loved dipped in the sauce!)

This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly only I doubled the sauce. I served with steamed broccoli, carrots, and snow pea pods allowing us to mix in the amount of vegetables we want. Thank you so much for an excellent recipe!!! I will definitely be adding this to the regular rotation.

Awesome! We loved it. I was out of cornstarch so I used flower to thicken the sauce. We also cooked the fried rice recipe to go with it. They go well together.

I've made this recipe many times. It is one of my favorites and a staple in our home. I do not marinate my chicken in the sauce. Instead I brown or even flash fry the chicken, transfer to casserole dish and cover with sauce to bake for 30 minutes. The chicken is incredible flavorful. This is a huge crowd pleaser, can be made ahead or reheated in oven and always turns out beautifully.

I saw some comments that the recipe is too time consuming for a "so-so" result. So I  altered it a small amount.

I just battered the chicken pieces in flour, salt, and pepper then fried them. Then I made the sauce separate with about a half cup or more of orange juice added. Then just coat your chicken and some rice in the sauce. All the flavor of this perfect sauce, half the time.  No matter how much of this I make, there's never left overs. Great recipe! Thanks so much!

I've made this twice now.  The first time exactly was written and it was good.  Okay - very good... but I knew it could be better. SO this is what I did:
Substituted Pomegranate juice (POM) for half the water and mixed in 1 TBS of Sriracha sauce for heat.
Instead of the flour to coat chicken I used corn starch (that makes the chicken a whole lot more crispy and you never have to worry about the coating falling off!  I also substituted peanut oil for the olive oil and added a tsp of Sesame seed oil to it for flavor.  Now it's 5 star!

Wonderful, glorious! That said, I don't usually have OJ around, so I bought some frozen and used 1/2 T, didn't have ginger and didn't miss it, and doubled the crushed red peppers (know your audience!). After reading other comments, I started heating the sauce w/cornstarch while the chicken was cooking and poured it over when the meat was done. It thickened up on contact.  My husband said not to change it at all. Thank you, Harry! Even though I played with it a bit, this is exactly what I was looking for with a great balance of citrus, spice and sweet.

The marinade/sauce for this was pretty awesome.  Instead of 2 tbsp OJ, I added the juice from a whole orange, and also added in just a little bit of sesame oil.  Also cut down the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, and it was sweet enough.  I did put in a little more than 1 tbsp orange zest, and the sauce turned out very orangey and tasty.  Also followed suggestions and put in way less cornstarch, about 1 Tbsp.  Sauce thickened up perfectly.
The breading didn't turn out crispy, but might try to cook it on a higher heat then suggested, or not coat it at all.  I didn't feel the coating added anything to the overall dish.
Added in some snow peas and carrots and served over rice.  It was delicious.

Let me begin by saying I really liked this. However I had a few technical issues. For the sauce I used 3 T of carton OJ instead of 2. I zested an orange as directed but instead of wasting the orange, I juiced it into the saucepan. Skipped ginger out of personal preference. When Browning the chicken I found it did not get crispy, but kind of browned. It was gummy on outside when I served. I made the error of putting in the cornstarch slurry all at once to the sauce. Turned my head for a few and it had become solid. Totally my error. It took a bit of working to fix it, but was able to salvage. The flavor in this dish is wonderful. I will make again, but probably try a different route with coating and Browning my chicken. It did go over well with my 12 year old, which is no easy task. Thanks!

We really liked this! My husband is a big fan of a good Orange Chicken and, frankly, I think this was much better than most I have tried in restaurants. 

I made it as written with the exception of the addition of some panko bread crumbs mixed into the seasoned flour and a bit of sesame oil per others' suggestions. Oh, and I served the sauce on the side, just because that's the kind of girl I am. 

By necessity, I made the marinade and marinated the chicken the night before and boy was I glad!! The flavor absolutely permeated the meat and it was fantastic even with no sauce on it at all.

The lemon juice, orange zest, rice vinegar combination is brilliant - the citrus taste holds up much better than orange alone would. 

Next time? Would probably back off a tiny bit on the sugar and double the red pepper flakes. Would use less cornstarch, as others have also noted and be just a bit little freer with the garlic and ginger. All just based on personal preference.  

Thank you very much for sharing this recipe. My family will make good use of it.

Amazing!! I made this for my boyfriend and he ate ALL OF IT, including leftover that night.. It took some time to prepare but was worth it. I did however make a couple changes. I used about 1/2 cup orange marmalade to add some more flavor, only about 1/2 cup brn sugar, instead of all water I sub'd out 1/2 cup for Orange juice, and let my chicken marinade for about 5 hrs. I also doubled my breading and added some garlic salt and toasted sesame seeds, then double dipped my chicken in the flour for better coating. Definitely do not recook the chicken in the sauce, just toss it a little before serving. AMAZING MEAL!!

My kids (8 & 10) and husband RAVED about this meal!!!  This is their new favorite!  I served it with jasmine rice, stir fried veggies, and cream cheese wontons!  Delish!  The only thing I did different was what a few others also changed...I only used 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch and I just poured the sauce over the chicken right before serving instead of adding it to the sauce while cooking so the chicken would stay crispier!  This meal was fabulous!

Love this recipe.  I have been trying to make dishes at home that we usually order as take out and Orange chicken is one of them. This recipe works great. I dont use the flour mixture on the chicken and fry it, I was trying to make it healthier.  So I just put the chicken in a dish and poured some of the sauce over.  I baked at 350 for about 15 mins.  I thickened up the rest of the sauce with the cornstarch and let it cool and thicken.  Then when the chicken was done the extra sauce was perfect to use as a glaze and the chicken was very moist.  Served with rice.  Also added extra red pepper to make it a little spicy. Delicious

Delicious!!!  Had a little trouble getting the chicken to brown evenly in a wok...the wok seemed pretty dry even after adding the oil.  I'm wondering if deep frying the chicken pieces might be worth a try.  Or maybe heating up pre-breaded chicken?  My family loved it anyway and you could have put the sauce on a sponge and it would have been good.  The only thing I omitted was the red pepper flakes, just a matter of taste.  Also, I had forgotten to marinate the chicken ahead of time, so I just let the chicken chunks sit in some orange juice before I coated them with the flour.

Simple and delicious. This has gone into regular rotation, and I can add other fruit juices or whatever I have on hand into the sauce and it deepens the flavor. I tend to vary it according to what I have on hand, and usually double the garlic and halve the sweetener. It has yet to go wrong.

The sauce had a nice orange sweet-sour flavor (a little too sweet for our tastes) with the just the right amount of kick, but it ended up too thick and needed to be thinned out quite a bit.  The cornstarch slurry does not need 3 tbsp of cornstarch, that's just too much, and the end result was a sauce with a very strong lingering cornstarch taste.  Also, the recipe calls for coating the chicken with flour and then browning the chicken in olive oil which gives it a nice crust.  However, when you simmer the chicken in the sauce at the end, the flour breading just falls off and ends up thickening the sauce even more.  This has had great reviews, but I was somewhat disappointed with the way it turned out as well as its presentation which was not very eye-appealing.

Excellent - better than from the restaurant!  Next time I make it, I think I will saute some red bell pepper with the chicken pieces  and reduce the amount of brown sugar.

I have made this recipe several times, both with and without coating the chicken. I highly recommend leaving off the coating. It adds nothing since the sauce makes the coating gooey. The extra step of coating and frying just adds calories and takes time. I also like to add vegetables like carrots, mushrooms, maybe broccoli, so that the dish (with a side of rice) is a complete meal. Also, this recipe calls for a little too much cornstarch.  Add it slowly so that you can stop if it gets too thick for your taste.

This was very orange-y and tasty. Next time I won't waste my time frying the chicken, as it lost all crispiness in the sauce anyways. I will just salt and pepper and cook it in a little oil. I think I'll add a little more ginger and garlic to the sauce, too...it was a little one-dimensional. And some broccoli. Yum!

Great dish.  Delicious!  My picky three year old and my husband both loved it.  As others suggested, I cut down the cornstarch/water ratio 2 tsp/1tbs and it made the sauce a perfect thickness.  I also dipped the chicken in egg with some water before breading in flour mixture.  Otherwise, followed exact directions and it was a hit.

This is actually a really great dish. I tend to improvise just a bit and used some Asian chile garlic sauce instead of red pepper flakes because that's what I had on hand and used more orange juice and zest than it says. I also didn't do any reserving of sauce to marinate the second time around and liked it better. I like the contrast of the chicken vs the sauce instead of all one flavor. I used a micro-planer instead of mincing the ginger root so that there were no chunks at all. A little sesame oil is nice when cooking the chicken too! JUST A LITTLE THOUGH! Pretty yummy!

This was delicious served over rice. I took anothers advice and kept the sauce separate to drizzle on the chicken.  My husband requested it again tonight! The coating did come off when I was cooking the chicken, but aside from that, no complaints here!

My 5 year old told me this was the best chicken ever!! I left out the pepper flakes and ginger (don't care for the taste) and just marinated the chicken while I prepared the rest of the meal and it turned out GREAT!! Wonderful flavor.

I thought that this was delicious.  I used 1 cup water and 1/2 cup OJ, as suggested and I dipped the chicken in flour mix, then egg, then back in the flour mix also as suggested. The chicken was delicious and tender.  Next time I will add some vegetables.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Good food!  I agree with the comment about the cornstratch and water ratio being off as the sauce thickened fairly quickly and was too thick to be a sauce over our rice.  However, it was tasty.  Even my ultra picky 2 year old had a 3rd helping.

Yum!!! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using ground red pepper in place of the flakes.  I also sauteed onions, carrots, and green beans to pair with the chicken and rice.  Leftovers were just as delicious the next day!

My family has a weakness for orange chicken, and they enjoyed this recipe a few times already.  

Preparation time is a bit lengthy, so we make at least enough chicken & sauce for two dinners and freeze the balance for later consumption.  It reheats well if you add a bit of water to thin the sauce and do not bread the chicken.  We save some preparation time by skipping breading the chicken.

If this is your first attempt at Asian take-out recipes, then be prepared to carefully follow the instructions and learn a couple new tricks.  For example, corn starch should be mixed with luke warm water before adding it to a heated sauce for thickening.  Otherwise, the corn starch will immediately form chunks.

This tasty recipe is equal or better than the orange chicken I buy from my favorite local Chinese takeouts.  Preparation time is lengthy, but can be reduced with some tricks.  However, be prepared for a learning curve if you have never cooked Asian take-out.

I'm giving this 3 stars because I followed the recipe exactly well except I only marinated it for 1.5 hrs instead of 2 and it turned out WAYY to orangey. The breading had flaked off and became a mess. And had no other flavor than the strong orange flavor. But, I'm sure this chicken would have tasted much better if I had just marinated it and then baked it in the oven instead of in a pan.

One of the few recipes where I followed the instructions exactly and gave it 5 stars. When it was done and eaten I couldn't think of anything I would change. A little steamed rice and a fortune cookie and you are good to go.

My 13 yr old daughter made this tonight for dinner and it was better than the restaraunt version.  Changes she made:  she only marinated for about 30 minutes and it was plenty; she used splenda brown sugar and skipped the breading; she added carrots and broccoli.  So good.  ******** (adding more stars)

I really like this recipe sauce, but my husband, amazingly, said it needed more orange!  I think it was pretty orange-y.  I also cut the sugar and half, but will probably use 3/4 c next time, as i like it a tad bit sweeter.  I also breaded my chicken with cornstarch and stir fried in a small amt of oil, because it makes it crunchier than some of the other methods.  The sauce got a thumbs up from me!

I used about half the flour to coat the chicken because it sounded like an exorbitant amount; and I thought it was pretty lame and useless because most of it flaked off in my skillet. I also stir-fried 2 broccoli crowns, 3 carrots, 2 handfuls of snow peas, and an onion to go with the meal. I didn't need ANY extra sauce for those veggies, and I have 1 cup or more leftover sauce.

DELICIOUS!
besides 3 tweaks I made according to recipe. I didn't have rice vinegar so I watered down apple cider vinegar. And I cooked the chicken thoroughly, made the sauce (with 2TBSP cornstarch) and then drizzled it on top, rather than cooking together like the recipe stated.

This is fantastic! I only had the juice of a small lemon, so I made up the difference with more orange juice - and it tasted great still! I had to use more oil for the chicken to crisp it up well. I also added broccoli to get some extra vegetables in the dish. We will make this often in our household!

This is a very easy take out menu reproduction. I added a little bit of orange marmalade and I used Ponzu instead of soy sauce and it turned out great! Thanks for posting!

Great recipe with easy ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have any issues with it being a goopy mess, and I loved it and so did my 2 and 4yr old (minus the red pepper flakes) Thanks for a great orange chicken I can do at home!

This was great.  I forgot I was making it, so I didnt get to marinade just all that long, but it was still super delish!  I didnt really measure, I sort of guessed, and I used regular vinegar, and I used ground ginger.  This is definitely staying in the rotation.  My grandson who is 6, said it was "wicked!"  I asked him if it was wicked good, and he said yes!

The chicken was wonderful! Although, I may have added a tad too much ginger and red pepper flakes, my fault. Also, I feel the recipe needs a little less brown sugar and a little more soy sauce. Just to boost the superb flavor! Also, apple cider vinegar is the closest sub for rice vinegar.

This came out great!  My husband loved it and he's not big on chinese food.  I didn't have a fresh orange so I substituted a tablespoon of Orange Extract.  Lots of layers of flavors in this.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was just what I was lookingf for.... Fresh ingredients (I squeezed the oj and lemonade), fairly simple, with great ratings.  BUT it was TOO SWEET!  I read reviews and assumed those who commented on the sweetness were sensitive to sugar.  No!  Cooks take heed - cut the sugar in half (at least)!  I could tell it would have been great without the overwhelming sugar.  Even my kids (3 and 5) thought it was too sweet.  No dessert for us!

This is the second orange chicken sauce I've tried. Still not very good. Even though it calls for an entire cup of brown sugar, it was still bitter. Maybe I just don't like ginger. I used 2-2 TBL water and cornstarch instead of 2-3 ratio. I tried the 2-3 and it made thick white clumps in the sauce and I had to start over. Won't be making this again, so I'm off to continue my search for a delicious sauce!

This was very good! My husband and I ate the entire recipe ourselves with broccoli and rice without any leftovers! I made this too orang-y by adding the cornstarch into extra orange juice, so next time I will definitely not do that, as the flavor was great before and the taste of the marinated chicken was perfect without the extra orange juice. I let chicken marinate overnight and dipped it in thinned egg before putting in the flour mixture and I think both helped the flavor and texture. Very good recipe - my first Asian-inspired recipe was a success. Thanks!

Great flavor.  Did not have fresh ginger, added a little ground.  Used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 splenda (Diabetic in the house).  Did not bread the chicken, saute'd chunks of chicken breast with a little salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Served with some fried rice made with brown rice.  Will definately make this again.

GREAT RECIPE!  Followed everything exactly as far as making it, but when I served it I took the suggestions of others and put chicken over rice and then poured sauce over it all (rather than putting chicken back into sauce)

I made this for my fiance and mother in law who are big on chinese food. They absolutely loved it! I didnt have any ginger or red pepper flakes so i substitued with cayenne and chili powder instead. it ended up tasting really good and having alot of kick to it. the only thing we found was that it was really orangy. next time il use half a tablespoon of orange zest. otherwise overall awesome recipe!

Fantastic!!  I used all the ingredients (except the corn starch), but I'm not a measurer so I just threw stuff in the pan after I browned the pieces of chicken and just let it simmer until reduced.     My boys (10 and 7) raved!  Who knew healthy, inexpensive, homemade "Chinese" food was so easy.  We may never go back to the buffet restaurant again.

Awesome sauce recipe. Cooked it for some neighbors and everyone loved it. I used my deep fryer for the chicken, but otherwise followed to the T and it was great. Be careful how you cook in the sauce (final step) to retain crispiness.

Very easy to prepare, and so tasy! My husband and I LOVE takeout, but are trying to cut back. This hit the spot! I used one of the suggestions that said to dip the chicken in a little beaten egg to help the batter stick. Don't know how it works not using that method, but using it sure worked perfectly! Delicious, and fairly simple. Will make again!

Amazing and easy!!  I forgot to pick up an onion at the store and my husband still loved it. Orange chicken is one of his favorites. He's a chef from Johnson and whales and loved this recipe, and he can be hard to please! I wouldn't know how to make this dish better, except next time I won't forget the green onion! lol

This was excellent and easy to prepare. I made four servings - and the sauce was just a little too thick. The next time I am going to try one tablespoon less cornstarch.

I had been looking for an orange chicken recipe that tasted simmilar to my favorite local restaurant's.  This recipe was VERY close.  I see a lot of people say it was too starchy or the corn starch didnt disolve.  The cornstarch and water need to be pre-mixed together in a bowl and added to the sauce while stiring!    Also for those who like it less sweet, cutting the sugar down a bit and adding a lil more pepper flake should help this. Here are a couple changes I made- 3 TBS of oj instead of 2 (used simply orange brand), reduced water to 1 1/4 cup, double the red pepper flakes (didnt make it hot, just a lil more bite), used 1 cup brown sugar-NOT packed, used ground ginger instead of fresh (local grocery didnt have any in stock).  I also cooked the sauce in a pot and did the chicken seperately.  WHile chicken was cooking- let the sauce simmer. I also found that I needed twice the cornstach water mixture to get it to thicken.  I wasnt 100% pleased with the chicken, the coating seemed to flake and didnt crisp much.  However, I mixed the chicken with the sauce and added a cup of frozen broccoli that i heated in the microwave prior.  Adding them all together worked out well and the chicken tasted rather good, though next time I may try something different with the chicken so its a little more crisp. I served it over plain white rice.  IT was slightly vinegary, not too bad, maybe cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup next time. Overall, great recipe!  I will surely make it again!

Excellent! Just tried making this last night for the first time. The flavor was amazing, really the best Asian chicken dish I've made at home. Tastes just like restaurant orange chicken. I will be adding this to my weekly dinner rotations. My husband loved it to. I think I needed more water- cornstarch ratio than what the recipe called for- next time I will do equal amounts water to cornstarch. Thank for the great recipe!

Was A great meal, especially served with white rice. Be very careful, however,with the red pepper flakes; just a little too much can make this dish very spicy!

I made this last night and it was delicious!  The sauce deserves 5 stars all by it self!   I didn’t have fresh ginger, but had some ground ginger on hand so I used that.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs instead, didn’t have any chicken breast.  I did not have the time to marinate the chicken for 2 hour, so I only marinated it for about 45 minutes in the fridge.  I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil to fry the chicken.  I forgot to add the garlic, but it was still delicious.  Changes that I will make the next time are: I would totally bypass the whole marinating process; the breading does not stick when this is done.  I will reduce the brown sugar and reduce cornstarch.  The brown sugar makes it a little too sweet and cornstarch made the sauce really gummy.  I will definitely dredge the chicken in flour, then in egg wash, then flour again so the chicken would be crispy and the flour can stick to the chicken.  I would also add green and red peppers.  As one reviewer stated, that I think is a good idea, if you are planning on making this again in which I'm definitely am, is to the make extra sauce ahead of time and freezing it.   I served this with the “Fried Rice Restaurant Style” recipe that is on this site, which was also good.

Ah, this was fantastic!! I absolutely loved it! It definitely tastes like restaurant style Asian Orange Chicken! I used half a cup of flour and half a cup of Jungle Oats fine crumbs. Will be a regular in my house!

My group loved this and said it was the BEST orange hicken they have ever had! I changed the sauce up, and did not marinate the chicken in the sauce there was no need. I made a double recipe. I added more oj and lemon juice and used cider vinegar for a more distinct flavor. I changed a few things about the recipe. I did not marinate the  chicken it makes the breading not stick, i dredged the chicken in egg before rolling in flour. We all loved this my 10 mo old son couldn't get enough! GREAT recipe

AMAZING!!!! I tried a few orange chicken recipes from this and other sites but this 1 was by far the BEST! The only thing I did differently was distilled white vinegar instead of the rice vinegar (didn't have any) but it still came out perfectly. I will use this recipe over and over again (on my cheat days only since my husband and I are on a diet) because even the kids loved it. Thanks sooooo much for this recipe!

Overall, good recipe. A little too sweet for my taste, so if I make again, I'd use a lot less brown sugar. I also think in a pinch you could definitely get away with less time to marinade, as the majority of the flavor seems to come from the sauce it's actually cooked in. *I also wonder how this would be without dredging in flour...? A little healthier, that way. Tamed down the sweetness by serving with a basic fried rice.

If I could give it more stars I would. The only thing different I do is use a packet of peppers from the pizza places rather than measure out.

This was way to sweet for us. I think the sugar needs to be cut down to 1/2 cup. Even the kids thought it was to sweet. Not counting the sweetness of it the flavors were nice. The chicken after frying it was really really good. I really wished I would have stopped there. Sorry.

No words can describe what my family and felt as we ate this heavenly food. It took me 5 hours to make it, but SO worth it!!!!!! At 15 years old, and a budding chef, I wanted to try an Orange Chicken recipe that was perfect, and this was it!!!! I didn't have three of the ingredients, so I just left them out- the orange zest, rice vinegar, and the green onions, but it did not make it any worse, I can tell you that!!!!! I also did not have ginger root, so I did powder ginger, and for the garlic, I also used powder, but I'm sure it would still taste AMAZING if you followed the recipe to the letter!! It looked and tasted just like the chicken from the mall!!!!! My 13yr old brother LOVED it, as did my 9yr old brother!!! DEFINITELY will make this again!!! And again, and again, and again!!!!!!

Too much cornstarch. It made the sauce gummy instead of sticky. It could have been okay, especially if the chicken pieces can be deep fried for a crispier texture. Keep working.

Very tasty and very attractive -- especially with red pepper strips, asparagus spears and some pea pods.  The heat from the pepper flakes was intensified in the leftovers the next day.  Definitely will make again and again.

I doubled the sauce for 2 lbs. of chicken breasts.  I only marinated it for 30 minutes in the fridge.  I sauteed the chicken until completely cooked and then poured the thickened sauce on top.  I served it over white rice.  It was delicious.

WOW! WOW! WOW! Absolutely delish! I usually wait till everyone has tried a recipe before I rate it but could not wait on this one. I made the sauce and taste tested it before adding the chicken, I found that it was a bit strong (not for me). I think it would have been a bit too powerful for my 10 yr old and hubby's taste', so I added a little bit of water and let it thicken up again...and it's perfect. Once I got the perfect taste down I added the chicken. I find the more you stir, the flour coating tends to fall off. So, stir gently just until all the chicken is coated and leave it alone and the flour coating will hold just fine. I did not add the ginger root or the corn starch just because I did not have any but its not missing it either.  I used flour in place of the corn starch by sifting it into the sauce to avoid clumping. This recipe is by far my favorite out of everything I have tried from AllRecipes.com.

Very good recipe!  I had to add a little extra OJ to mine.  I used 2 chicken breasts as the recipe stated but ended up with too much sauce and not quite enough chicken.  I would reccommend cutting up another chicken breast as I also had plenty of the breading mixture left over as well.  All in all, I will use this recipe again but add another piece of chicken.  Thanks!

I loved this - of all the Asian recipes I have tried from this site, this is one of my favorites.  I followed the recipe except I did not add the cornstarch (I don't care for the flavor) and decreased the water to one cup, increased the orange juice to four tablespoons, and decreased the brown sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup.  I also added a wee bit of veggies: sliced up some carrots pretty thin, added some snow peas, and just a small handful of sliced mushrooms.  I thought the flavor and texture was very close to what one would get in a Chinese restaurant, but without the MSG or extra calories.  Thanks very much!

Delicious! Just a tad too sweet for my tastes; I'll probably use about 2/3-3/4 of the brown sugar next time. But I'm definitely going to make this again and again!

The whole family LOVED this one - I made a few minor changes (1/4 cup OJ, 2 tbsp lemon juice - just a swap on those ingredient quantities) - omitted green onion & ginger, added a sprinkle of onion powder. My chicken stayed crispy with the flour coating but I cooked the chicken all the way through, added mushrooms, steamed broccoli, and then tossed the mixture in the sauce for just a minute or two. Served over brown rice. Can't wait to make again! One tip if your coating is falling off - don't stir the chicken around the pan continuously. The less you touch it, the better the coating will adhere...

This is easy and good.  The chicken was really flavourful.  I did not have rice vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and it was really good.

So delicious!  I followed the sauce recipe exactly except I substituted ginger powder instead of using the real thing.    I sauteed diced chicken breast in olive oil and garlic, removed it from the pan, added the sauce & cornstarch slurry, and mixed the chicken back in.  There is no need to marinate the meat or even mess around with trying to get it crispy with the flour mixture.  It turned out just as good without doing all that work.   To serve I turned it into a rice bowl with sauteed mushrooms, peppers, and steamed broccoli.  The flavors were so good... we devoured every last bit.

I really liked this orange chicken recipe.  I used orange marmalade instead of OJ and zest.  I also added a little flour to thicken but once you mix it with the chicken that would thicken it.  Added even more hot pepper flakes b/c we like it spicy.

Made this pretty much to the recipe, except that I doubled it, used boneless chicken thighs and added a pack of mixed frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  I fried the chicken in batches, and when done put them in a 350 oven to stay warm and crispy.  With 3 teenagers, by the next morning there was not a piece left.  They all exclaimed how good it was - even better than Chinese takeout.

I have been searching for a good Asian Orange Chicken recipe and this is excellent.  I only changed a few things because of flavors that I like.  I put in Red Chile Sauce for sweet but hotness and I put in more orange zest, juice and ginger for my liking.  You can taste it as you make it, which makes it nice.  I added some veggies to the sauce while it was boiling (5-7 minutes) and then thickened the sauce.  Everyone loved it!

I made this today for my fiance and myself, and I have to say it was great!  The only change I made was I added broccoli to the sauce. In the future l will definitely take the advice of several reviewers to use sesame oil and ALSO I will put the chicken in the oven after frying then pour the sauce on after its cooked so the chicken stays crisp (my only complaint was that the chicken lost all its crispy coating in the sauce). Orange chicken is one of our favorites to order when we go to an asian restaurant and I have to say this recipe is just as good as some of our favs! I should mention that I didn't have enough time to marinate for the full 2 hours, so with just over an hour in the fridge marinating the chicken still soaked up all that great flavor! Not too zesty not too sweet, I will definitely be making this again in the future!

Not bad, but not good either! We could barely taste the orange and the vinegar was the taste and smell that stood out the most. We ate it but I doubt we will make this one again.

This chicken was very good, but if you don't watch the chicken carefully it'll burn and won't taste as good. But make sure you cook the chicken fully. The flavor wasn't quite what I was used to, but was very good in all.

If your looking for restaurant quality orange chicken then you've found it. This recipe was excellent. However I did use less sugar,1tbsp cornstarch, and added lemon zest as I did not have any oranges. My family loved this dinner.

This was okay. If I decide to try this again, I will decrease the amount of brown sugar, increase the amount of red pepper flakes and make it without the breading...and probably throw some broccoli in it too.

Great recipe!  Tangy and delicious.  I double coated the chicken (flour, then egg, then flour again), and cooked it in sesame oil.  It held up wonderfully in the sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

Yes, this is quite sweet, but my family liked it. Didn't have fresh ginger on hand, so I used 1/8 tsp ground ginger. I took another reviewer's suggestion to dredge the chicken pieces first in an egg wash, before adding them to the flour mixture, and the flour adhered well. I also added half of a green pepper (or red, orange, or yellow for colour), chopped into 3/4-in pieces, when browning the chicken. There seems to be a typo with the quantities of the 3:2 cornstarch/water thickener. I suggest reversing these, so as not to get globs. Finally, the directions aren't very clear in step 5 as to whether all of the sauce should be used (ie. including the 1 cup used to marinate the chicken), or if just the reserved sauce should be used. I used both, and it turned out great. Served this with egg-and-chicken fried rice, and some egg rolls. Will make again, but will cut back a bit on the brown sugar.

I had been wanting orange chicken and looked at many recipes before settling on this one.  I knew that I wouldn't have time this evening to fix it as directed, so I threw everything into my crock pot, except the corn starch, before I went to work today.  When I came home, I thickend the sauce and my family loved it!

Move over Chopsticks and Pei Wei there's a new dish in town...
We had a party last night and I decided to make this with a side of Asian salad. I must say that this was by far better than any restaurant orange chicken. I added actually 1 1/2 cups of orange juice to the awaiting sauce (using 1/4 from the orange which we took the zest of) and allowed that to reduce nicely before marinating. After using half a portion of the sauce to marinate the chicken, when it was time to cook the chicken and make the orange glaze, I added two pinches of orange zest and a pinch more of red pepper flakes for that extra heat...And yes before adding the cornstarch dissolve in a few tablespoons of water first or else it will leave clumps. 
Everyone ravved about this and we had to print out the recipe to others. This is one recipe we will be keeping for many years to come. Thanks!

This recipe was very good.  I made it while in Brazil visiting my family and it was requested by my brother.  I couldn't find any rice vinegar there so I had to substitute for white but I don't believe that hurt the recipe.  I will try it again sometime with rice vinegar.  The sauce was excellent.  I did end up having to use more Evoo than the recipe stated though.

I have spent some time trying to find a recipe for orange chicken just like the kind I would find at a Chinese restaurant. I had problems finding any that even came close. When I thought all was lost, I stumbled across this recipe and I loved it. I didn't have much orange zest on hand, so I threw a little orange marmalade into the sauce and it turned out great. I will definitely be making this dish more often.

Awesome recipe, with some adjustments suggested by other reviewers (i.e., keep chicken warm in 200F oven, reduce cornstarch, etc.). Instead of mixing the chicken into the sauce, I served the chicken on plates with rice & stir-fried veggies, then gave everyone individual sauce dishes so that they could add it per their tastes. Some of them just dipped the chicken in the sauce, others poured it over everything the plate! Next time, I'll add some red pepper flakes to kick up the heat. Thanks!

This was wonderful!  It was better than Panda Express's.  The sauce was a little too thick, and left the rice a bit dry, but with a little less cornstarch it would be perfect.  I recommend putting in half or so of the cornstarch first, and then add as needed.

OH MY GOODNESS! This is the best recipe! Orange Chicken is my husband's favorite, so I thought I would surprise him tonight. He said this was the best orange chicken he had ever eaten...quite the compliment! I followed the recipe to a T, other than replacing the rice vinegar with white wine vinegar. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! Made this again, and love it just as much as the first time!

I'll make this again and cut the vinegar WAY down. It was over-powering. On the up side this recipe makes plenty of sauce; usually I have to double to make enough to enjoy on the rice.  I added honey and cut the brown sugar to half.

This was really yummy and I was surprised at how similar it was to something you'd find at a restaurant. When coating the chicken, I used 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/2 cup flour. Instead of warming the coated chicken pieces in the sauce, I heated up the sauce in a small saucepan, pan friend the chicken in a skillet and then poured the sauce in to the skillet on top of the chicken. The coating didn't fall off my chicken that way. I don't believe the recipe specifies to put the crushed red pepper in the sauce so I didn't realize that until the very end. It would've been better if I had used the orange zest because it didn't really taste like Orange Chicken. It tasted more like Citrus Chicken. I served this with white rice and steamed broccoli. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a pretty good recipe but I had some problems when I followed it exactly. I agree with other posters that it's not a good idea to put the cooked chicken in the sauce because the breading becomes all goopy and falls right off. Also, I had a hard time getting the sauce to be the right consistency; it was too watery, and when I added the amount of cornstarch it called for it became chalky and almost the color of gravy - not orange at all. I was also disappointed with the flavor - while it was good, it's just not what you get at a restaurant. I even prefer the Orange chicken out of the box from the store over this recipe. I had high expectations but this one wasn't the winner I was hoping for.

This was EXCELLENT..I made the sauce in a different pan from the chicken so they were cooked at the same time and then just poured over the chicken..would probably make more sauce the next time as it was just so good...definitely make again SOON

Whoa!! That orange flavor was way too strong! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as directed and was really hoping for some great orange chicken, but I was so dissapointed. The sugar and the orange zest completely overpowered any other flavors. You know it's bad when your husband eats some and then asks if he can have some cereal. Sorry.

This is one of the best stir-fry type dishes I've made. I went with what reviewer, Tunisianswife, did and subbed about 1/2c of pineapple juice I had on hand for some of the water, and added extra garlic. Along with the chicken, I tossed in a few drops of toasted sesame oil, some onion chunks, matchstick carrots & red bell pepper, & small broccoli florets; am very glad I did for color and health! I only used about half of the cornstarch mixture and it was plenty thickened with that; I also mixed the cornstarch with OJ rather than water. Next time, I will omit the step of breading the chicken in flour and just saute the marinated chicken as is, and I will also reduce the amount of brown sugar, especially with having used fruit juice in my marinade; it was just a little too sweet.  Very nice dish, Harry.  Thank you!

This is the REAL DEAL! This tasted like the orange chicken you get at all of the famous places. The sauce is immediately hit with the odor and flavor of orange followed by notes of ginger and garlic. The spice is subtle. Perhaps a bit too subtle. I added a bit more pepper flakes as well as orange zest.

I made this last night. It turned out great. I omitted the ginger and green onions because I didn't have any. I did make this once before with all the ingredients and I actually liked it better this time. This is a little time consuming but well worth the effort.

This has great flavor and I will certainly make it again. It smelled so good while marinating - it was torture to have to wait to eat. The recipe calls for WAY to much cornstach though. Be careful when adding it - a little at a time is the best way to go.

This was excellent! It tasted almost exactly like a Chinese restaurant's. I was a bit intimidated by all the ingredients but it really was easy to prepare. Marinating the chicken is a must though. Next time I may even marinate it overnight.

I followed the recipie to the T, but it did not come out at all as I expected.  Not sure where I went wrong with this one...it had a highly acidic taste, chicken was dry, sauce did not coat well. etc., etc.,   A lot of work for no pay off!

Amazing! I had to substitute the Rice Vinegar for Apple Cider Vinegar and it was just fine. Used Mandarin Oranges for the Juice and Zest with a splash of Triple Sec Orange Liquor. 

Definitely recommend like others before me to put the finished sauce on the Chicken AFTER the Chicken has been cooked to ensure the breading remains crisp and in one piece. I Set the Chicken in a baking dish with the sauce drizzled on top with Green Onions (oven at 350) to thoroughly make sure the dish was hot  and crisp when served.

I made a couple alterations for my own. One of the first suggestions I recommend is to substitute a 1/2 cup of water for pineapple juice. Also I am not a fan of an overpowering orange flavor so I used a blood orange and more orange zest to have a nice orange flavor without being too sweet. Secondly, if you want the closest flavor to what you get at a Chinese restaurant I suggest instead of using olive oil you use peanut oil with a dash of sesame oil. Trust me it makes a difference.

It was really good. I only used 1 dl (ca. 2/5 cup) brown sugar and the sweetness was just right. I did not have much time, so I marinated the chicken for one hour only. It tasted good, and the sauce had flavored the chicken. I am sure it tastes even better if you marinate it longer, but if you have limited time, I want you to know that it tastes just fine if you marinate it for 1 hour. I followed the other reviews and used 2 tbs of cornstarch. Everything worked out, and I got a really nice dish.

Very good!  I dissolved the cornstarch in orange juice instead of water.  And we used homemade chicken nuggets instead.  Next time I may put some of the sauce in the chicken nuggets to add extra flavor, but even without doing that it was good.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and added more OJ and some pineapple juice in place of the water.

Because my daughter is allergic to wheat, I used corn starch instead of flour.  I have seen corn starch used in many Chinese recipes as breading.  I oven fried the breaded chicken just turning once to not mess up the breading.  The breading came out perfect.  It was just like the breading I would get with sweet and sour pork at a restaurant.  

The sauce is so deliciously strong.  I think the marination step could be skipped without missing it.  I also did not think the recipe needed less corn starch as others have said.  I tried with a lesser amount first, but thought it was too watery, and added more corn starch up to the full amount.

The sauce portion of the recipe  is fine.  But this dish is far, far better when made with chicken thighs, rather than the virtually flavorless beast meat used here. 
Unfortunately, most of the take-out places around me have also begun using breast meat.

This recipe was good but not amazing. The chicken dredge texture became mushy and started falling off the chicken and clumping together. The sauce was good but I was hoping it would taste like the restaurants. Now I see I should have followed the helpful reviews regarding texture.

This was the best orange chicken ever! My husband gets orange chicken at our local Chinese restaurant all the time and he said this was so much better! I didn't change anything. Delicious the way it is! Will definitely be making again soon.

It  was delicious!  Much better than the   frozen boxed stuff.  Only change  that I  did:   I  used more orange juice and less  water. Will make it again  very  soon.

I made a couple of changes.  I did not flour my chicken.  I cut the chicken in bite size  pieces, seasoned, and cooked them in olive oil.  I made the sauce in a separate pan.  I added a can of crushed pineapple and reduced the amount of water.  Due to time constraints, I did not marinate the chicken. I added the chicken straight to the pan the sauce was in, and allowed it to simmer.   It was fantastic.

Love love love this! I squeeze orange into it...like it better. And I always double the sauce. I use canned garlic and ginger from trader joes. Makes it a quicker meal. We use gluten free flour and it's just as tasty. Love this with arborio white rice and steamed broccoli!

Super delicious! Tastes just as good as any other orange chicken I've had at restaurants. I ended up marinating the chicken for only 1 hour instead of 2 since I was really hungry haha! I substituted the rice vinegar with white vinegar diluted with some water since I didn't have any. I will most definitely be making this again!

This is a definite 'do again and again'. Followed the recipe exactly as written except I added some green bell peppers ( always trying to sneak in extra veggies). Suggest cooking chicken until crispy ( personal preference). Whole family raved about it. Served with fried rice, will try white rice next time maybe add some water chestnuts. Thank you for a really great recipe.

Delicious & easy!
Very easy to put together. I misread the recipe and put in too much corn starch - but I just thinned it with some water and it was fine. Very picky child just devoured it!

This recipe turned out fabulously!  In fact, I had to make it two days in a row at the request of my four daughters.  In my opinion, a lengthy marinade time isn't necessary.  The flavor in the sauce is plenty.

Utterly delicious!  I made it pretty much according to the recipe, and it was fantastic - not too much orange flavor (at least not for me), and more than enough sauce - even had some left over, so I cooked up more chicken the next day to use up the rest of the sauce.  I also like the fact that you can mix the sauce ingredients ahead of time (as much as a day, I suppose) and then heat in a saucepan, thereby saving time on a busy weeknight.

A helpful hint for using fresh ginger: I cut mine into small teaspoon-ish size pieces (don't even bother peeling), wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, and place them in the freezer.  When a recipe calls for minced fresh ginger, I take a piece from the freezer and grate it with a microplane grater.  It takes no time at all, and the ginger just melts into the sauce.

Next time, I may try making more of a tempura-type batter for the chicken (cornstarch/water).  I also think this recipe would be a great base for other flavors - for example, reduce the orange, add some hoisin/sriracha/chili paste/red chiles, and you have General Tso's.  Thank you for sharing - I will definitely be making this again!

Love this!!! The only change I made was to cook the chicken in coconut oil with no breading.  Much healthier and the flavor is excellent.  Next time I will stir fry some broccoli and red pepper in this.

I used to make orange chicken from the Lee Kum Kee packets for my blended family of 6, but always wanted to try it from scratch. I'll admit I was a little skeptical at first but even the sauce alone was tasty. The only tricky part of this recipe (or any orange chicken recipe for that matter) is getting a good fry on your chicken. I wasn't pleased with the way I fried my chicken but my family LOVED it regardless. This is something I will definitely do again...and again...and again! Next time I bread my chicken I will avoid getting the marinade and juices in the flour (my fault) and I will shallow fry it in my pan. Thank you so much chef Wetzel, your recipe has 6 new fans!

My family loved this recipe. I used some of the tips people mentioned and I made it Gluten-Free. Key changes to the sauce: added 3/4 cup of chicken broth, 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup pineapple juice, also added another teaspoon of lemon juice and added 2 tablespoons of dry sherry and 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger and the 3 cloves of minced garlic and didn't pack the brown sugar (and gluten-free soy sauce).  I added some of the pieces of the orange I used and squeezed the juice. I used heated sesame oil and only 1 1/2 teaspoons of corn starch and cooked stirring for 5 minutes and then added the sauce and brought to a boil and this made a nice thickness for the sauce. For gluten-free chicken: I used 1 cup of Quinoa Flour and 1/3 cup potato starch and 1/4 teaspoon of Xantham gum. I also used the egg recommendation with water but dipped the chicken in the flour then in the egg and then back in the flour. I fried the chicken in 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 sunflower oil. My family definitely wants this again and my 2 year old said MMMMM- yummy. The dish bursts with flavor. Note: Definitely double the sauce if you add vegetable or more chicken.

Sooooo good! I added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder to the flour mixture the second time I made this, and it made a huge difference - makes for a more substantial coating. Self-rising flour would yield the same result. The amount of cornstarch is perfect if you add the marinade back to the sauce after transferring the chicken to the flour mixture. (This is safe since the sauce is boiled again.) If you discard the marinade, decrease the amount of cornstarch. Once I brown the chicken, I put the skillet in the oven on the lowest temperature setting (170 degrees) while I finish the sauce separately on the stovetop. Store leftover chicken and sauce separately, per another reviewer's suggestion, and reheat the chicken on a cookie sheet to maintain crispiness. We love this recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

Made it but I bread and baked the pieces instead of flowering and frying for a healthier take. I seasoned he bread crumbs with salt pepper and orange zest. I also substituted half of the brown sugar for coconut sugar and didn't use corn starch since my suave was thick enough without it. Was a hit even with my boyfriend who likes

Turned out great.  Browned the breaded marinated chicken on a cookie sheet after frying to keep the breading.  Served over rice with broccoli and carrots.  Will make again, great orange flavor.  Used dried zest from Spicehouse.

Definitely a keeper! My husband and I are always on the hunt for good asian flavored dinners and are usually disappointed. This one was great! My husband told me over and over how much he liked it. The only things I'll do differently next time is reduce the cornstarch, as the sauce became very thick and chunky, and also slightly reduce the brown sugar as it was a bit on the sweet side. Over all I definitely recommend this dish!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was just too sweet. The flavor is beyond good, and I loved everything about it. I will make it again, but next time I will use less sugar.

This recipe is very.. odd.

#1 - too much vinegar, too little orange juice. Double the juice and cut back to 1/4 cup of rice vinegar.

#2 - the oil in skillet isnt enough for the breast size it recommends. USE A WOK. Get the oil SUPER HOT and drop in the chicken A SMALL AMOUNT AT A TIME. MAKE SURE THERE'S AT LEAST 1/2'' OF OIL AT THE BOTTOM.

#3 - too little water for the starch. Add another 1/2 tbsp.

Once it's all cooked, DO NOT ADD IT TO THE SAUCE. Add alittle sauce TO THE COOKED CHICKEN ON THE SIDE, at a time and toss it to coat. Once done, use alittle more to coat on the plate.

ALSO, MAKE DOUBLE THE SAUCE and keep some on the side. Trust me.

Fantastic!! My boyfriend liked it and he is very hard to please. I put the sauce on the side and let him pour it onto the chicken and he put it in the rice. Another reviewer said that the chicken breading would flake off and I didn't want to take a chance. The instructions on cooking the chicken came out quite nice even without the sauce.

I made this marinade to spice up some leftover homemade chicken strips that we had for dinner last night.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Both of my kids thought that the orange flavor was way too strong and wouldn't eat it.  I thought it was a bit strong as well so I would definitely cut back on the zest (and perhaps leave it out all together) if I make this again.

Made this tonight but reduced the sugar to a scant one quarter cup.  If you are a family that has cut most refined sugar out of your diet you will not miss the sugar at all.  We used a very ripe California orange and thought it was delicious.  Next time we may try even less sugar!  :)

This recipe was easy to follow, but i felt like by simply dipping the chicken in flour, it did not turn out at all like the thick crispy fried outside that i think of when i think of orange chicken. What i did was dip the chicken in flour, then dredge it through some beaten egg whites, then re-dip in flour (mixed with a little cornstarch), then fry. This made a huge difference and made it look more like the chicken in the picture. My husband asked me to throw out the less battered pieces that i made according to the recipe at first. the sauce was pretty good though, i only needed half the cornstarch called for in the sauce, so i just kept pouring it in and stirring till it looked thick enough. i might add some finely diced red jalapenos. and sprinkle with sesame seeds to garnish at the end.

This is a great sauce. We eat mostly vegetarian. I made this sauce to use with broccoli and seitan in a stir fry. It's really yummy. I added quite a bit more garlic, ginger and green onion to suit our taste. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

Pretty good with a strong orange flavor. I made it as directed except added a cornstarch to the flour to get a more tempura vibe. A Chinese recipe I have for Sweet and Sour Pork used just cornstarch as a dredge and it's great. As others suggested, I did not return the chicken to the sauce, but poured the sauce over the chicken. I also recommend Mandarin Fire Oil as a seasoning on top. It brings out the flavor even more so, although sesame oil is a suitable replacement that adds no heat.

They should really have a 4 1/2 rating.  Great recipe. Most of the time for this recipe is making the sauce and the amount of time to marinade.  Make sure to use enough flour or the chicken won't coat properly and will fall off. (Happened to me.)  Everyone loved this.  Made with rice and broccoli.  No leftovers.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is missing a few important tweaks that keep it from being a GREAT recipe. When following the instructions, the sauce turned out really good--I added some more orange juice to boost the "orange" taste. But the chicken was awful. This meal also takes a long time to prepare, which sucks the fun out of it. If I were to do it again, I would follow the recipe's instructions for the orange sauce and used precooked chicken chunks in place of the recipe's suggestion. This would save time, dirty less dishes, make the taste worth the work for me.

Yes, Yes, YES!! THIS was great! Repeated recipe for sure. I initially did this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. It was good, but when I made it with chicken breast, I realized that the breast was definitely the better option.

I made this today and we couldn't stop eating it. I used self rising flour, and didn't have any trouble coating the chicken. Self rising flour gives a nice thick coating to the chicken. This is an excellent recipe. Make it and enjoy!

Loved it.  I was not sure I had enough zest so i just put in a heaping teaspoon of orange marmalade.  I think the real key to this recipe though is the marinating of the chicken.  Next time if I'm also making egg rolls I think I will find a tempura batter and deep fry the chicken so that it is extra crispy.

Great flavors!  I substituted grilled chicken - no breading.  Also for the sauce, increased the amounts by half and used Splenda brown sugar.  Additionally added about 4 cups of lightly steamed veggies - broccoli, spinach, scallions, red and yellow bell peppers and snow peas.  Served over brown rice.  Much more diabetes friendly!

I stumbled upon this recipe while I was looking for ways to use oranges in dishes. Im not an experienced cook, thus i found the recipe easy to follow and the ingredients not hard to find - they were all in my pantry! It is also flexible and can be tweaked to ones preferences. I enjoyed it a lot since trying it last week and Im already preparing another today. This will definitely be a part of my monthly menu.

I made this last night and it was delicous. The only thing I changed was the amount of brown sugar because I like a more spicy than sweet flavor. My girlfriend loved it and I will definitely make it again.

What a delicious recipe!  The sauce is amazing--better than any orange chicken I've ever tasted.

Did the stir fry method as suggested by others. Was a little bland for my taste.....next time more soy, more garlic and ginger, and maybe more red pepper flakes.

Orange Chicken at it's best!! Next time I'm skipping the marinating, using the deep fryer, and then coating in the sauce. Another way would be skip the pan fry and oven bake with just the sauce. Awesome recipe, thank you!

Sauce is way too thick with the 3 tablespoons cornstarch to 2 tablespoons water. Turned out way too thick. Also it is way too sweet. The flour coating on the chicken was disaster!  I think cornstarch would have turned out more crispier.  The flavor however is very orange which appealed to me. My husband told me I was "Chopped"!!!  LOL

This was so Yummy!  I used 1/2 of the red pepper flakes because my kids do not like hot food, otherwise I followed the recipe.  I loved that I could check the flavor before adding the chicken to the marinade.  It was so yummy I knew this was going to be good.  

Wish there was a 4 1/2 star because that is what I would give it.  The only reason I didn't is because some of the breading flaked off in the sauce which made it kind of thick.  I will try the cornstarch breading next time but even without that change I would make this again and again.  

My husband said that he thought that this recipe was even better than the orange chicken that we get from the local Chinese restaurant.  My daughter is allergic to MSG and we LOVE Chinese food.  Thank you for this yummy alternative.

This has to be the best and easiest recipe for Asian Orange Chicken! It wasn't "saucy" enough for me so I double the sauce and the ONLY thing I substitute is the water. I used Orange Juice instead. (as well as when you mix water with cornstarch I use Orange Juice there as well). If I'm crunched for time I will buy chicken tenders *2 lbs for the 4 servings* so I dont have to cut up chicken breasts and leave the thighs intact. We usually have this once a month and it's just as scrumptious as the first time. As for left overs I cant say because even when I double the chicken we still eat it all. 
When I have time I will pair it up with Baked Pork Spring Rolls by Rayna on this site which are fabulous as well.

I have never liked orange chicken no matter where I have eaten it from but I gave this a shot and and I love it!! Been making it for a couple of years now and I have perfected it. I double the sauce because my husband really likes it. I don't let it sit for 2 hrs like the recipe says. I usually do it for 20 min and it turns out great.

I really like this recipe. I listened to the reviews and put about one tablespoon of cornstarch instead of three. I think this is best so you can see how thick you want the sauce to be. I didnt like the pan frying of the chicken. It keeps the marinade on the meat, but it falls off in the pan while frying and on your plate. I'll probably make this again because I really like the flavors. Next time I'll probably bake the chicken instead

The dish turned out totally messed up - the coating sticks to the pan and the chicken remains white. Then 3 tbsp of cornstarch was too much, would switch to 2 tsp. In the end flavorful and soft chicken but terrible appearance.

This was really good! I marinated it over night because I really wanted it to have an orange flavor and I dont know if it helped or not but it came out great! I didnt add the rice vinegar since I didnt have any on hand and it still came out tasting just like the chicken at panda express. Im making this again, thanks for the great recipe!

Too sweet for my tastes.  I substituted orange juice (from the orange, not carton) and halved the sugar.  Even the kids, who only eat plain chicken, liked it (high praise, actually)

The orange flavor was completely overpowering. I couldn't even finish my meal. And trying to cook the flour-coated chicken pieces resulted in a mess with burnt flour stuck to the pan.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was good. However,  I didn't care for the way the breading was on the chicken. We like a thicker, crunchier texture, so next time we'll simply use another breading method from a cashew chicken recipe we have. But the flavor of the orange sauce was really good!

Amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I added a little extra garlic & omitted the green onions since I didn't have any (which it would have been even better with them, I'm sure!) We gobbled it up! It's a million times better than any chinese takout!

It tasted great, just wish it was more crunchie. Next time I will be using the Wok and trying to do it that way to make the chicken more crunchie.

Amazing recipe! Very close to restaurant quality. My family doesn't like spicy hot food, so I omitted the red pepper flakes. My daughter's only complaint was that there wasn't ENOUGH sauce! Served with jasmine rice and broccoli and it was a hit.

My husband doesn't care for Asian food at all so when I told him this was what's for dinner he quickly started looking for pizza take out menu's. Boy Oh Boy was he shocked when he tasted the final product. Told me it was the best thing I'd cooked in a long time! Best thing of all our 3 picky kids (12, 11, 9) ate it and loved it. Thanks for yet another great dinner idea!

I think this is the best Asian recipe I have ever made. I used an orange infused olive oil when frying the chicken, fresh ginger and instead of 1 cup of brown sugar I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup agave nectar. Fantastic!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, omitting the red pepper flakes because I had none.  I tried cooking the chicken as long as possible without letting it burn and it still turned out all mushy and gloppy.  Not like the orange chicken in the mall.  The flavor was also not very "orange."  I think marinating the chicken first is pointless, since you pour the sauce over it at the end as well.  And I think marinating it was the reason the chicken turned out mushy after I cooked it.  I will not be making this one again as I had company over and I was embarrassed to serve this to them!

This recipe was really good! We were so impressed. It does take quite a bit of work, but it is definately worth it. We let the chicken marinate overnight. We didn't mix the sauce with the chicken bc of what other reviewers said. The batter on our chicken was trying to come off so I definately think it's better to dip the chicken or pour the sauce over it last minute. We doubled the sauce just to make sure we had enough. The only other thing that I would suggest is to fry the chicken with egg and flour like you would make fried chicken. We think that would of helped the batter stay on and also to use more oil for frying. Everyone enjoyed it and it was just so yummy! I will definately be making it again using the tips I stated here. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except for the water, I used 1/2 water and 1/2 pineapple juice. Breaded my chicken with cornstarch instead of flour. We liked it ok but weren't completely wowed by it and it was so labor-intensive!  To be honest I'm really not sure the results were worth all the effort. Thanks anyway.
UPDATE:  I made this again using 1 1/2 inch thick boneless pork chops which I marinated for about 4 hours and then cubed and stir fried along with carrots, onions and broccoli  Layered the meat and veggies over rice and just poured the sauce over the top. We enjoyed the pork much more and also prefer no breading on the meat.

My son and Husband Loved this. I did to and I normally do not like this kind of sweet dish. It was perfect only did a 1/2 cup of sugar and add a egg before the second time I battered the chicken. It was amazing served this with brown rice and broccoli on the side. Thank you Harry!!!

I didn't do what others had suggested but breaded the chicken and once it entered the sauce it all came off.  The flavor of the sauce was good, but too much cornstarch the amount of sauce that was left.  I would reduce the cornstarch to 2tbsp and not bread the chicken in the future.  Otherwise it had a good flavor and the family enjoyed it.

Thumbs up all around for this dish.  I didn't bread my chicken, just cooked it up naked to save the calories.  I don't know how much more the breading would have added to the taste, but everyone in the household liked it.  Will make again!!

Awesome!  I've made so many Orange Chicken recipes and they are too overpowering in one flavor or another.  This was the perfect blend of ingredients!  I only had 1 TBS of soy sauce left and it tasted fine.  I also only added 1/2 TBS of rice vinegar.  I always seem to taste the vinegar in any recipe I make, and just don't like it.  I finally have an Orange Chicken recipe I can file away instead of throw away!  Thanks!

I made this exactly as is and it was absolutely delicious. I may skip flouring the chicken and just cook it "naked" next time to save on any of the extra steps and trying to keep it from getting soggy etc. Either way the flavor is amazing and this is a fan favorite in our house! EDITED: I now make this without flouring the chicken. We still love it. Equally delicious, and one less step in the process. :o)

Disappointed in this recipe - it definitely didn't have the "orange" flavor (or color!!!) that I was expecting. Also, it needed to be thicker and "cling" to the chicken.

i did exactly what it says and it turned out way to thick and there was not enough glaze for it. It was like a floury paste. But altogether it turned out alright!! my little brother loved it ?

My boyfriend said to me last night "I think this is my new favorite dish"! I also changed measurments of the cornstarch/water and eyeballed the rest. I made 3 cups of brown rice and sliced up 5 medium chicken breasts and I felt that there was plenty of sauce.

I made this last night. I think I may have either put too much orange zest or the recipe calls for more than our liking. Either way, once I tone down the sweet orange flavor that was over powering to have as a main dish, we will love this. I thought it was fun to make, and it will be one of our favorites. I think I could make this a appetizer and it would of been perfect last night. I tried to put it over rice and just make that our dinner, needed something a bit more salty to go with it. I have to go 4 stars but it has the potential for a 5.

This was fabulous and a keeper for sure.  I did not have orange zest on hand so I substituted a tablespoon or so more of the orange juice and I did not have rice vinegar on hand so I used just a dab of balsamic vinegar and it still turned out wonderful!

This was really delicious! I omitted the breading (mostly because I just plum forgot) and just sauteed the chicken breast pieces and made the sauce, and it was wonderful! Spread it atop the coconut rice recipe, and WOW!

Six stars!! I didn't use orange zest b/c we don't like it, but I doubled the amount of oj. Also used 1/2 cup oj & mixed in 3 Tbsp. of cornstarch, poured into hot sauce to thicken. Put sauteed (in evoo) chix breast tenderloins into thickened sauce, then simmered. Ladled over rice- the best orange chicken EVER! Thank you for this recipe!

I was disappointed, as I thought this would turn out really good. I followed everything to the t, and even took some tips from other reviews such as cutting down on the cornstarch. The sauce probably would be fine without any cornstarch at all. I doubled this recipe for my large family, and only added half the amount of cornstarch and with a 1:1.5 ratio (powder to water). The sauce had a great flavor, but the consistency was like jelly. The breading fell right off when added to the sauce. I would consider making this again without doing any of the breading, and just having the chicken in the sauce.

Needs adjusting but nothing too major. We do love the sauce and thought it was better than the last time we had orange chicken. By the way, I was out of rice vinegar so I used distiller vinegar and didn't add the ginger. We hated how the breaded chicken turned out so next time we are going to fry them.

My chicken needed to be breaded more and deep fried. I didn't have any rice vinegar so I substituted apple cider with a tad of sugar. My cornstarch/water lumped up as soon as I put it in. But my mom said she would never order again from our fav Chinese place! It wasn't that hard once you got it all together. Thanks for the recipe it was great!

My family really liked this recipe. I thought just the chicken by itself without the sauce was pretty good, but the sauce was just a bit much for my taste, but I'm not much on vinegar so that's probably why!

Very good as written.  The only thing I changed was to add sauce without wiping out the pan - just scrape what remains as the sauce cooks.  My "meat and potatoes" husband loved it!

Easy and very tasty.  Reminds me of something you might get at panda express.   My husband really enjoyed it.  I made some asparagus with it and the sauce was great with it.  I think you could use the sauce on pretty much anything.

Amazing! The marinating part was sort of pointless, next time I'd just bread and fry them, then coat them in the delicious sauce. 
I used fresh squeezed orange & lemon juice, cut out the vinegar & green onion. I also used flour to thicken the sauce since I was out of cornstarch. SO GOOD. Definitely a keeper.

Awesome recipe. I made it exactly as written (well minus the red pepper flakes due to personal preference of a certain someone). Easy and quick, already plan on making it again.

was a huge hit!!  A bit time consuming but definitely worth it.  My husband brought leftovers to work the next day and his coworkers were asking him what take out place he got it from.  I did cut the brown sugar down to about 1/4 of a cup though and thought that was perfect. Definitely this recipe is a keeper!

I've made this recipe more times than I can count and it is PHENOMENAL.  So yummy, and way better than anything I've had at a restaurant.  Always gets rave reviews!  Edit: I've been making this for years now and it's always a hit.  I sub OJ for all of the water.

Excellent flavor as is!  I added nothing to the marinade/sauce.  I did add broccoli and bell peppers so I increased the amount of sauce used.  You need to try it!

Super yummy!  I'll have to leave out the red pepper flakes next time because two of my boys couldn't handle the spice, but the rest of us loved it!  I made 50% more sauce because we love sauce!

I just made this dish tonight and it was absolutely delicious. I had to tweak it just a little bit because I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I used ground ginger instead, and I didn't have an orange to use the zest, so I just used more of the frozen concentrate orange pineapple orange juice that I had on hand.

I made a tempura batter and fried the chicken instead of marinating it and I love the way that it turned out. I also added 2 very small cans of diced peaches with the juice and I think it was so good. Next time I make this recipe, I will add just a touch more soy sauce so that it balances out the sweetness. Great recipe.

My husband really liked this recipe.  I, on the other hand, was not too impressed.  I only used 1/3 of the sugar, but was still a bit too sweet.  I doubled the red pepper flakes, but it still needed more.  Decent enough for a homemade orange chicken if you like the orange chicken from the run-of-the-mill Chinese fast foods. I guess I was just spoiled with the most amazing orange chicken ever at a family-owned restaurant I served at for a few years.

I agree with the recommendation for using cornstarch to coat the chicken and 2 tbsp of cornstarch with 2 tbsp of water to thicken the sauce.

Great flavor.  However... considering that 1 cup of sugar has 800 calories, and you're already deep-frying the chicken, I would suggest cutting down on the sugar and adding more only if absolutely necessary.

this was easy and great! I enjoyed it. Completely forgot to double the sauce b/c I doubled the chicken. Hubby and daughter both liked it. Made white rice n steamed broccoli medley to accompany. Will be adding this to my rotation. Something nice to do with chicken, and I was just gonna throw it in the oven...

Excellent - the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I made a few changes.  I omitted the water and lemon juice all together and used 1/3 cup orange juice instead.  Also, reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup which worked out really well.  Like others, I also coated the chicken in cornstarch rather than flour.  Finally, due to time I did not marinade.  Will make again and again ... !

I used the sauce on chicken wings for a Chinese New Year themed Superbowl Party.  I marinated the chicken in about 2/3 of the sauce, and then added some corn starch to the rest and poured it on the chicken after turning them over in the oven.  It was very good! I also added a lot more ginger and orange than it called for.  My only concern is how much sugar is in it! I'd like to figure out a way to cut that down in the future.

Well, I just made this recipe (in honor of Chinese New Year) and it was very good.  I do not like heat of any kind so I did not add the red pepper flakes.  I cut the brown sugar in half and it was still a bit too sweet for me.  When I make it again, I'm going to try 1/3 cup and see how that suits me.  I thought the consistancy of the sauce was perfect and wondered if those of you that thought it was too "sticky" used all of the marinade, including what the chicken was in.  It cooks to a boil so you are cooking the raw juices from the meat.  Plus you cook it for 5 minutes once you have added in the cooked chicken.  Anyway, I served it with Asian veggies and rice.  This is a keeper :o)

have never review a recipe before, but made last night and husband and picky grown son and girlfriend loved it.  Made as recipe called for except had no red pepper flakes and used ground red pepper but halved the amount and it was perfect.  Had trouble browning the chicken think I had too much in skillet but was in a hurry.  I think next time I won't coat the chicken with flour and cook it plain.  Served over rice with snowpeas, carrots, peppers etc.  Will make again.

What a great recipe! The sauce is so flavorful, and very easy to make. I used some panko bread crumbs on the chicken, and it held up very well with the sauce. I'll be making this very often. Thank you for the great recipe, Harry!

I made this with my brother and I agree with a lot of the other comments it's really orangey. I love it though! Thanks for the recipe. I sort of messed it up though because I don't have a zester thing or any pepper flakes. I really enjoyed it though thanks for the recipe!! :D

I stayed pretty true to the recipe, but I had a can of mandarin oranges so I added that to the sauce which gave it a little extra texture. Also I chopped up carrots and green peppers for some crunch and vitamins! Great recipe though, better than take out and just as easy.

Excellent recipe. Three generations of family loved it! I halved the rice vinegar and used Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar (from Trader Joes). I also just baked chicken thighs, sprinkled with salt & pepper and brushed with a light coat of sesame oil. When they were about 3/4 cooked, I brushed them with the orange sauce and broiled them until just crisp on each side. This was easier and healthier than breading and pan frying. Served with sticky rice and broccoli and doused in the orange sause...yummmm!!!

I work doing caterings, this recipe is one of my customers favorites. occasionally i use powdered ginger(1/4 of the fresh). Otherwise it comes out perfect everytime and has an awsome orange smell and taste. Imagine Orange chicken that tastes of oranges,hmmmm:)

This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added more red pepper than it called for--which was a mistake, it was way too spicy for me, although my dad loved it! Besides that, it tasted just like orange chicken from a restaurant, and was not difficult to make--just a little time consuming.

Amazing!  I followed the suggestions of others and fried up the chicken in the sesame oil.  I also used the juice of the orange I zested and added an extra orange and some veggies.  Delicious!

Just a tad bit too orange-y for my taste.  Next time I'll use less than what is called for.  Otherwise, this was good!

Very delicious!  Tastes like Applebees orange sesame chicken bowl.  I sauteed veggies to go along with the chicken and brown rice.  Takes a little extra time to marinate, bread, and fry the chicken... but really worth it!  I also love that I had all the ingredients in the refrig/pantry.  I didn't have rice vinegar... I used white wine vinegar and it was still great.  Will be making again and again.

I would suggest adding about two more tablespoons of orange juice.  Also, toss in some Panko bread crumbs with the chicken.  Mmmmm!

This was just divine!  I followed the recipe as is. I had a few things go wrong:  1. I put the floured chicken pieces in a wok. Actually, they need to go in a flat skillet, and, instead of tossing them around (which makes the batter fall off), I needed to simply fry them on both sides till crispy  2. The taste, while brilliant, was lacking in  garlic/ginger/green onion. I didn't quite have 1 tbls of zest, but it really dominated the flavour in the end.  Re: other reviews. I actually had no problem with the starch. Seemed to be a perfect amount as stated in the recipe. I did not add the chicken to the sauce in the skillet. Put it in the oven to make it even crispier. That was a good move I think.  The end result was just stunning. Took a while (because of the marinading part), but boy was it worth it. Prob won't make it on a work night again though! :)

tasted just like something you would get at a restaurant but healthier!!  I paired this up with whole wheat rice with mixed veggies.  Next time I make this however i will take the advice of someone else and dip each piece in a little egg and water to help the beading stick better to the chicken.

Quite yummy. I used a little bit less cornstarch adn it came out perfectly. I liked the orrange and lemon flavors. I do think this needed some vegetables so I added broccoli, cauliflower, onions, garlic and artichokes and serve this over some lemon shirataki noodles

This was good, but the sauce needed some extra flavour. I added some more red pepper flakes at the end, but it still needed more. I think replacing the water with pineapple juice would make a huge difference. I added steamed carrots and broccoli and served over brown rice to make it more of a meal. Peppers and snow peas would go well with this, too.

Great flavor! I added a bit more orange zest then the recipe required. And only added 1 tablespoon of soy sauce (per another review).

This was so good. Instead of sugar I used honey, but half the amount it asked for. I also added some sauteed carrots, red, green, yellow peppers, and onions. I served it over rice, and for other who were watching their weight Bulgar!! I would make again and again.

Very good recipe but it would be better in a fryer.  I wound up frying just a little bit and then baking for 30 minutes at 375.  This is because I worried about all the chicken not cooking thoroughly in the pan.  I periodically put sauce on the baking chicken and it turned out pretty good.

I have made this recipe a couple of times already and each time, I have made it slightly different. However, the first time I made it was a little goodbye party thing for my cadets in JROTC. I was their company commander and I wanted to give them a thank you for being great kids and so I had them choose between chinese or mexican. They chose chinese and immediately decided on orange chicken. I found this recipe to be the most attractive and I had to triple the measurements to make a huge batch not only for my cadets but the whole battalion. IT WAS DELICIOUS! I did add a little more cornstarch to make it a little thicker for transportation. I did omit the pepper flakes but when I made some for myself, I added a whole tablespoon (I love it spicy!). This is the best orange chicken recipe I have known and will use until I am old and wrinkly.

Boy oh boy oh boy! Was this recipe delicious!!! I have never written a review about a recipe before and I just had to on this one. My husband and I absolutely loved it. I prepared it according to the directions and for sure... this is a keeper.  Can't wait to have leftovers tonight. Next time I'll make the sauce double. Yummy!!!!

I made this recipe twice and it's just not for me. I tried and tried, but each time the breading kept clumping in the sauce. And even when I reduced the orange and lemon juice, it was still overwhelmingly tangy for me. It was good, but I certainly couldn't make it and present it to guests and that's kind of what I was going for.

Sorry, I didn't much care for this recipe.  The breading was just too much (and too gooey).  I followed the directions closely, too.  I did, however, LOVE the sauce.  I will make it next time I make dumplings.

I used to frequent a little place in Louisville, Ky for their Orange Tofu dish. I've tried numerous "Orange" Chinese recipes to replicate that dish and they've all fallen incredibly short.  I've finally found the one. THE recipe that tastes just like that one back in Louisville. Thanks for the golden info!

Good flavor, but, as another user already suggested, I'd recommend not cooking the chicken in the sauce once it's breaded. The coating turned from crispy to gummy. Otherwise it was pretty tasty:)

This was not good. Made as directed in recipe, measurment for the cornstarch way way off. If you like eating orangey thick paste then this is the perfect recipe for you. Will not make again.

Great recipe. Sooo flavorful. Take the advice of other reviewers and only mix the chicken and glaze at the very end (and don't overmix!) or the breading will come off the chicken. The great thing is that the chicken is marinated so it has great flavor even without the glaze.

Okay, I am just reviewing the sauce here...I used my own recipe for the chicken...but OMG - SO good!  My husband and I both agreed it tastes much better than a restaurant's.  Thanks so much for the amazing recipe - we will be making this often!

I love, love this, it tastes just like from a chinese restuarant, i added onion and broccoli, but cook these after cooking chicken, then cook sauce, add chicken and veggies, heat through, yum!!

I have to say after reading a few of the reviews, I was a little concerned, but once I made it as it was called for, I found it to be better than most chinese resturants serves. Being rasied in Hawaii and knowing good asian food is a pasion for me. Let me say this, this was by far one of the best versions of Orange Chicken I have ever experienced. For those who said it had to much orange flavor, remember the second name in the the dish title, it is supose to have a strong orange flavor. GREAT recipe, thanks for sharing.

I have to agree with reviewer "Chairman James" too much cornstarch made it really gummy, I don't think I will be making it again.

I made this tonight and it came out very flavorful. The only thing I changed was reducing the brown sugar and rice vinegar. It really was yummy! Thanks for the recipe, I have never made orange chicken before and I'll be making it again.

My husband LOVED the sauce for this recipe--made exactly to recipe except added cornstarch slowly until the desired consistency was reached and did not add red pepper flakes. I thought it was a little too sweet though. The only trouble I had was getting the breading to stay on. I even took another reviewer's suggestion of dipping the marinated chicken in egg and then in the flour mixture--any suggestions?

This was a great recipe!  My husband really liked it, and that means a lot to me.  I cut back on the orange zest, but would probably cut it out all together next time as it was a bit overpowering for my liking (just personal preference!)  I also reduced the cornstarch so the sauce would be thinner...it was great!  Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good, but next time I'll sub orange juice for the lemon juice.  I served it with asparagus sauteed in sesame oil and a little soy sauce.

Thanks for the recipe.  I'll confess to altering it to suit our personal preferences.    (No red pepper or ginger...Less cornstarch...More orange juice).   Stir fried some vegetables and boiled some rice noodles and added them to the chicken and sauce mixture.

Wonderful recipe! I recommend using the original recipe's cornstarch measurement to create a thicker, gooeyer restaurant quality sauce.

this was excellent!  i followed lots of the suggestions given in other reviews and was very impressed.  i liked that this didn't have to be fryed in oil to the point of being saturated with it.  i stir fried some veggies after i removed all the chicken from the pan, in the leftover oil.  i served everythign seperate, mainly cause our 3 yr old likes everythign that way.  but i liked it this way too! i could control how much sauce i put on my dish and really loaded up on the veggies.  will definitly make this again.

My husband and I love this recipe!!  I do make a few small changes but there small. I leave the oragne zest out (it's just to much orange) and I double the crushed red pepper.  I have just started using tempura for the breading and it much better! Thicker and crisper!

The flavor of this dish was very good, my whole family enjoyed it. Next time I will use lesser amounts of cornstarch as my sauce can out to thick, even after adding more water, plus I will dbl the amount of sauce.

Awesome! I used my FryDaddy for very authentic restaurant results. Served over sticky rice and a stir fry made with store-bought broccoli slaw,  mushrooms, asparagus tips, and red pepper strips. Truly, truly a yummy dinner that wowed my family (and me) :-))))))

Sorry, this got great reviews so I thought I would try it.  My family hated it.  It had too much orange flavor and my house smelled bad afterwards.  I never had that happen before. My family hated it so much they give me a hard time whenever I think about trying a new recipe .

I didn't realize I had to marrinade the chicken until I started cooking.  It turned out pretty good still.  Although I plan to use the recipe exactly the next time around.

This was very very good.  I substituted regular vinegar for rice vinegar because I couldn't find it at the grocery store, and instead of 1.5 cups of water I used 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of pineapple juice.  I cooked the chicken in half peanut oil and half EVOO which added a nuttier flavor.  VERY GOOD.  I served with a side of rice and green and red peppers.

Wow, this was really easy and really good.  I was a little loose with the recipe:  not enough lemon juice in the house, so I finished the 1/4 cup with OJ; regular white vinegar instead of rice vinegar; regular onion instead of green onion; white sugar instead of brown; a little more fresh ginger than it called for.  Usually I like to try a recipe exactly as it is, but I had to use what was in the house.  Also, a previous reviewer mentioned using slices of orange peel instead of just the zest, so I did that and it came out great.  This is a keeper, and next time I would like to add broccoli, as suggested by another reviewer, or maybe bamboo shoots, steamed carrots, or the baby corn.

Today is Christmas and I am about to make this for the third time. This recipes is one the best so far. This time I will mix the flour and cornstarch for the breading, like some others have suggested. I let my meat marinate for 24 hours and I also add broccoli.  I will make shrimp fried rice with the dish. Yummmmy thanks for sharing!

The sauce was spot on, very good. The texture wasn't what I was expecting though, it was really soggy and the breading just kind of fell apart in the process of "frying" the chicken, this could have just been me. But still very good and I will probably make again!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I made exactly as stated - but, as others said the cornstarch to water ratio was off.  I just used the measurements suggested on the side of the cornstarch box.  I did add some Sriracha  hot sauce to the sauce because we like it spicy. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is I thought the recipe was a little sweet - it may have come from too much sugar or by just using the orange zest only.  If you get orange chicken in a restaurant they use some pieces of the rind in the sauce.  I think the bitterness of the rind must counteract some of the sweetness.   I will probably try this next time to see if it balances out the sweetness for me.

I have been making this recipe for years now - It's my daughters favorite!  Thank you Harry!  Sometimes we dip the chicken in panko breadcrumb instead of the flour mix for extra crunch.

Great recipe. I discovered my ginger and lemons were too far gone to use and powdered ginger was fine. I just subbed more OJ in place of the lemon juice. I didn't have time to marinate and it still had great flavor. I use half cornstarch and half flour because it seems to crisp better. As others suggested, I added a drop of sesame oil at the end. Just a drop! Added walnuts, pineapple and waterchestnuts with a sprinkle of sesame seeds on top just before serving. Restaurant quality, for sure.

This was fantastic.  I recommend doubling the sauce so you have extra because it is absolutely delicious and can be used in a multitude of other applications (for chicken, pork, beef, rice, ANYTHING).  Thanks!

Much better than I had anticipated.  I also didn't marinade the chicken.  The sauce was thin so I think I will cut the water in 1/2 and then add as needed next time.  Spicy as written but Delish!

What a great recipe to play around with! After reading the reviews, I decided to kick up the orange flavor- and instead of adding 1.5 c of water I zested 2 oranges and sqeezed their juice into a 1 cup measure...(was about 1/3 cup juice) and then I added the water to top it off.  I still added the 2 tbsp. OJ as well.  I followed everything else as written except I used ground ginger, and reduced the corn starch to 2 tbsp and found the sauce was just right for us. There is a lot of sauce but we found that as it cooled it 'set' a bit more and it was the perfect amount for the left overs!  will use this one again

What a pain.  Okay to taste, but too tricky too make, especially trying to figure out how to keep the chicken crispy...but then again, maybe it's not really supposed to be. For all the work, I'd prefer a stir fry with a simpler sauce and chicken cooking method.

We thought this had great flavor. It was a nice, healthy option when you get that panda orange chicken craving!  I juiced and used the zest from an entire orange. I didn't have rice vinegar so I subbed with white wine. I also used dry powdered ginger only because I didn't have any fresh root on hand. I used 3 cloves garlic (crushed) and quite a bit more green onion to suit our tastes. Definitely try stirring in some veggies (particularly steamed broccoli because it holds the sauce so well) into the sauce before serving. It was yummy and we'll be making this again! :)

We enjoyed this very much, despite the fact that I did not marinate the chicken.  Only needed half the sauce and turned out great.  Will add veggies next time.

Quite nice; but for ours and our kids' taste; needed a bit more brown sugar and orange zest/juice.  Considering the taste and complexity of flavours; though; quite a good recipe; will likely make it again (served it on vermacelli noodles with some added veggies (mushrooms, bell pepperss, carrots, celery, and onions.))  Would probably try it on steamed white rice next time; though.  Thanks for the great base recipe!  Work with it and adjust it to your own tastes...

I have a recipe for orange-beef that I hold in high esteem.  When I saw this recipe, I thought I wouldn't enjoy a chicken version as much.  Wrong-o!  This is really great.  The sauce is fantastic.  I skipped marinating, dredged chix in cornstartch vs. flour, and blanched some cauliflower and red pepper, drained, and added to chix and sauce and served over rice. There is plenty of sauce to add some veggies to if you desire.  Spectacular!

This chicken is amazing.  I added 2 tbs cornstarch and simmered 1/2 lb thawed mixed frozen veggies with the sauce during the simmer time.  I kept the chicken warm in the oven at 200C and then added it to the dish at the very end to avoid losing the breading.  Next time I'll try sticking the breading on with some egg.

I made this while my mother-in-law was visiting and she would not leave until I gave her the recipe.  It was fantastic! I did add a little sesame oil and I serve it with rice that I cooked with orange juice and a a little ginger and a nice garden salad.  I will make this with pork next time because my hubby won't eat chicken and I want him to be able to enjoy it.

This was a great recipe! It took a while to assemble all the ingredients, but it had a wonderful flavor and texture. I used some extra sauce to stir fry red peppers, carrots, and broccoli, and that complimented it really well.  I will definitely make it again sometime :)

This was awesome! I threw in some broccoli, snow peas, carrots, red bell peppers and water chestnuts and served it over brown rice. Next time I will probably just skip the breading because it got a bit mushy for me, but the sauce was great! Thanks!

I ended up adding a few more tablespoons of orange juice, two was definitely not enough. I have a deep fryer, so what I actually did was make a batter and deep fry the chicken pieces, then used just the directions for the sauce from this recipe. I've tried others not nearly as good. After my tweak to the amount of OJ, this sauce was fabulous!

This was a fabulous dinner that my family loved.  My husband always wants orange chicken, but I was tired of buying the frozen stuff from costco or trader joes.  I found this recipe, but decided to skip the flour in order to keep it a bit healthier.  I let the chicken marinade 24 hours.  After cooking the chicken, I set it aside and sauteed some broccoli and carrots in the wok.  Then I put those aside, heated the sauce and corn starch mixture, brought it to a boil, and then added the chicken and veggies to simmer for a few minutes.  The veggies quickly took on the flavor of the ginger, which my family enjoyed.  I left out the green onions and pepper flakes because my family is sensitive to spicy foods, but the flavor was still fabulous! I will definitely cook this again!

This was ok, but definitely too sweet. Reduce the sugar by 1/4-1/2c if you don't like your dinner tasting like dessert.

I don't like my orange chicken tasting too much like orange, so I left out the orange zest.  Additionally, I used half a teaspoon of Sriracha instead of the red pepper flakes.  No ginger.  White onion instead of green.  White vinegar instead of rice vinegar.  Ten chicken nuggets (could have used more) instead of frying the chicken myself.  I added about 1/4 lb of broccoli and half a green pepper.  With all those changes accounted for, this recipe was definitely a keeper.

Very good recipe.  It takes some time but it's worth it.  I had to cut back on the red pepper flakes because although my husband and I thought it was great, the kids complained it was "burning their faces off".  As suggested by another reviewer, I minimized the stirring of the chicken to keep the coating intact and reduced the amount of cornstarch.

I made this using beef instead of chicken so I know my review isn't for the true recipe, but the flavor in this sauce is excellent!  I marinated bite-sized chunks of a chuck roast for 24hrs plus then breaded it as directed.  If I were to do it again I would probably skip that step.  Then cooked as directed.  I stir fried some onion, red pepper, celery, broccoli, and carrots to toss with the meat and served over rice.  I will definitely make again and try it with the chicken.

This recipe is pretty time consuming.  I always take two days, marinating the chicken overnight.  The results are well worth the time.

Just ok - oil amount was not nearly enough to brown the chicken.  Flour amount was way too much to coat chicken.

I did not bread and fry the chicken (neither my husband nor I like breaded food) - I stir-fried it after marinating it (in canola oil with just a touch of sesame oil).  Also added more ginger than called for (just because we really like fresh ginger), as well as double the red pepper flakes.  The combination of the extra ginger and red pepper flakes with the orange was superb - at least to our liking.  This is one of those recipes that you could tinker with each time you make it, and come up with a slightly different and wonderful tasting dish each time.  Thanks for the newest addition to the recipe box!

Wow... this recipe is awesome. If you're looking for Panda Express style Orange Chicken, this in NOT it. I was a little confused on how much chicken it was asking for since some people don't specify if it's halves or whole breasts.  So, 4 halves or 2 whole breasts... go with the smaller sized ones or there will be too much chicken and not enough sauce.  I only gave it a little over an hour to marinade, still was great!  I wish I could have done the full 2 hours or all day, it would've been amazing.  No adjustments needed on ingredients, served with steamed white rice, delicious.  Thanks so much :)

Very good. I use marmalade insead of the orange zest, and I serve it over oven-fried chicken breasts, but it's very good. I've also used the sauce stirred into a casserole made with brown basmatti rice, shredded chicken, and steamed broccoli for a pot luck, and that turned out very well.

Too sweet.  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup for the whole recipe, but other than that, I like the taste of it, plus I add extra red pepper flakes (like it spicy).  Very yummy over white rice.  Oh, and I also cut down on the cornstarch mixture.  3 Tbl just seems a bit unnecessary.

5 stars with using a lot of suggested changes.  You GOTTA dip in egg first before coating, double dipping is better.  and I changed 1/4 cup of water for more OJ, cut the sugar in half, used more chili flakes, and next time will only use 2 TB cornstarch. Perfect.

Easy and very good.  I doubled the recipe leaving out the ginger.  The only problem I had was keeping the batter on the chicken I will try the egg dip next time.

Tasted like authentic classy take out. Very easy.  Followed suggestions: 1) don't simmer chicken pieces in sauce but to poor the sauce over the chicken so it is not soggy. 2) dip chicken in egg with a little water to help it to stick.   Will definately do again. Leftovers just as good as the first time.

Delicious! I substituted onion powder instead of real onions and followed the advice of a fellow reviewer and used an egg/water mixture to coat the chicken. Double coating takes more time, but its worth it! I also tried this using bisquick instead of flour on the chicken, but it distracts from the flavor.

The sauce is pretty good however the breading ended up way to soggy and fell off the chicken. DO NOT cover the chicken with foil after cooking! The steam will cause it to turn to mush. If you're not counting calories, i would also recommend deep frying it to give it that crispy-ness. Good recipe for sauce but not so good cooking directions.

I made this the other night. We loved it. I stir fried broccolli and carrots to go with it. For the chicken I followed the breding recipe for'sweet and sour chicken' on this site. I love the puffyness of the breading. I'll diffently make this again, but I might not use any breading on the chicken next time.

I thought the recipe was tasty, but my kids did not.  I think the cornstarch called for was too much and made the sauce really thick and goopy. I simmered the chicken in the sauce which also made the crispy covering not-so-crispy...if I did this again, I would just pour the sauce over the chicken after it was done.

Excellent orange sauce. Since it called for orange zest, which requires grating the skin of an orange, I used fresh squeezed OJ from the orange which was a little overpowering on the first try. I increased the brown sugar a bit on the next try and it came out perfect.  I've also cooked the chicken in a tempura batter served over rice and used the sauce for dipping or drizzling over the chicken a few times. Very versatile sauce. Added it to my recipe book.

Second try: Delicious! I reduced sugar to 1/3 c. and reduced cornstarch to 1 TB. This solved the problem of it tasting like jelly. I also used 3 TB orange juice concentrate instead of adding lemon juice and orange zest. This was easy and tasted great. 
Old review: I didn't really like this dish but my husband did. It had a good citrus flavor but I found it way too sweet. Also the sauce seemed too thick to me. It was like eating jelly! Next time I will reduce the brown sugar and cornstarch significantly. The chicken was very good, though, and I added stir-fry vegetables to the mix.

I had some chicken and asked my husband how he wanted it cooked. He asked, "How about orange chicken like in the chinese restaurants?" I found this recipe and gave it a try. It came out really good - I was lucky that I had the ingredients on hand; the only thing I will do next time is NOT finish cooking the chicken in the sauce, the sauce gets so thick and if you try stirring the chicken in the sauce all the crispy coating on the chicken sloughs off! I had read this in a previous review but unfortunately I didn't follow the advice. I wish I had listened! But, even still it was so delicious I didn't really care!

The flavors in this recipe are very good, but the sauce is slightly too thick and even too sweet. I'd cut down on the corn starch some, and add more orange and lemon juice. I'd also cut down on the brown sugar some. I used chili red peppers instead of regular red pepper flakes, and it created a little bit of heat to the sauce. Next time I will experiment a bit with the amounts, but overall the recipe is delicious and does indeed nail the restaurant style orange chicken.

I thought this was an incredible recipe!  The only changes I made were not adding in the orange zest (glad I didn't because there was PLENTY of glorious orange flavor already), and I didn't have green onions on hand.  Will try adding onion and green pepper on the next round.  I also did not pan fry the chicken because I knew the coating would never stay put - I used my handy little deep fryer and it came out beautifully.  I poured the sauce over the top and tossed and served over rice.  Everyone was RAVING about it.  Fantastic recipe!

This chicken was excellent! My whole family loved it! I didn't refrigerate the sauce for 2 hours - just let it cool a little while I was working in the kitchen. The sauce was a little thick - less cornstarch would have been fine. Also, as one of the other reviews mentioned, the breading did get pretty soft and start tol fall off, so keeping it on a baking sheet in the oven would have probably helped with that. Other than that it was great!! We will be having this again :)

We really enjoyed this dish - it's a very tasty and healthy alternative to Chinese take-out!  I took into consideration some of the suggestions listed previously: Added a touch of sesame oil to the olive oil, kept the cooked chicken warm in a 200 oven and didn't add it to the sauce until the end to keep it crispy.  Also, I added slightly less cornstarch, although I found that the 2 tsp. suggested by others wasn't quite enough.  At the very end, I added some cooked broccoli, which livened it up and made it a meal.  It's a little extra work over other recipes, but not hard at all.  We'll definitely be making this dish again!

Great flavor!  I didn't have time to marinate the chicken and I also didn't coat the chicken in flour.  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil and poured the sauce over it letting it simmer.  I also added some broccoli while the sauce simmered.  Very good and will make again!

This was ok but had way too much orange flavor.  The orange over powered everything else.  I would say skip the zest in this recipe.

This recipe was great and not so difficult to make at all.  It was quite tasty and was a total hit with my dinner guests.  Even my husband loved it and he isn't a fan of Asian food.  By the end of the evening it was ALL gone!! The only thing I can say is that I did eyeball the ingredients as I'm not the type to measure everything exactly.  You have to experiment with what you like and don't like.  Also if you are doubling the recipe make sure to fry the chicken in small batches as if you put it all in at once it will get muddled together and the pieces won't be as crispy. I recommend a deep fryer for this as the chicken would get more evenly browned.

But overall it was delicious and I can't wait to make it again! :-)

The BEST orange chicken I have ever had!  My husband hated it, but it's not the recipe it's just him! lol....I did follow what the oher users said, instead of putting the chicken on a plate and putting tinfoil over it after it was cooked, I put it in my convection oven on 250 until everything was done and then stirred my chicken into the sauce!  Fantastic....will only make on occations because I am the only one in my house who will eat it....My neighbor loved it too!

I made this tonight for dinner. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of pan frying the chicken...i deep fried it..much easier. I also added more crused pepper to 1/2 the sauce since my husband and I like the heat. Overall it was ok. My 2yr old asked for seconds and my 6yr old did not like the sauce at all...I may make it again.

I love it!  I love the orange flavor and it all came together nicely.  I did not marinate the chicken, I did not have time and we were hungry.  I just served the sauce over the chicken, but the flavors, are fantastic.  You get that orange fragrant with just a hint of a kick from the red pepper.  I will make it again, as I have sauce leftover.  YEA!!  Thank you!  Thanks LB for recommending it. *** UPDATE:  Took leftover sauce, marinated a couple breasts cut into pieces.  I did not have oil so used 2 tbs of butter, fried up chicken and heated rest of sauce made a nice Football treat today.  YEA.. o and I wont skip on marinating the chicken in the sauce before frying again.. Huge difference!!

Honestly, I usually don't give bad reviews, but this was not an impressive recipe, especially not for the time it took to make! It tasted like one of those frozen take home asian entrees. I won't be making this again.

This is a beautiful homemade rendition of the orange chicken 'popular in the mall'.  I used to work in one of those places and yes this is as close as it gets.  I did need to use more oil for frying-you pretty much want to deep fry your chicken pieces.  Cannot wait to share this recipe with friends.

Tasted better than any of the Chinese places around us had. I really like being able to actually taste the orange in it. I added a bit more cornstarch to thicken the sauce, and it stuck much better to the chicken. I recommend this to everyone I come across!

I love orange chicken, this was by far the best recipe ever. the first time i made it i did not make the chicken crispy enough so it was to mushy with the sauce, but even then it was good.

AWESOME! Although I did make a few changes to the recipe based on reviews...(I also skipped the frying/breading part to save calories and time) Here is what I did (I used 3 small chicken breasts, about 1 pound total):
For the Sauce:
-1 and 1/2 cups water
-2 Tablespoons OJ
-1/4 cup lemon juice
-1/3 cup rice vinegar
-2 and 1/2 table soy sauce
-1/3 cup brown sugar
-1 teaspoon ginger
(I did not have onions or garlic or zest so I omitted them)
Follow the directions for step one and heat the ingredients over med heat.  Once it has come to a boil, let it cool for 15 minutes.  (Meanwhile you can cut the chicken up)
Afterwards, place the chicken in a large ziploc bag.  Measure 1 cup of the cooled liquid and pour it over the chicken and seal the bag. *SAVE The remaining sauce
Place the bag into a fridge(try to make it all flat so the liquid can soak into chicken) and marinate over night (I actually kept mine in for 24 hours-I had time)

When it is done marinating, heat a wok over medium heat.  Place 1 teaspoon of olive oil into center and then dump contents of bag into pan.  Cook for about 15 minutes, flipping the chicken so all sides can cook.  Then, add the rest of the sauce bit by bit (I did not end up using all of my saved sauce) in addition to intervals of 1 tablespoon of Cornstarch (I used 2 total). This will thicken the sauce.  Simmer it for a little longer and ENJOY!
*NOTE:  The Sauce smells extremely bad (acidic like vinegar) in the beginning, don't worry!

My three kids loved this chicken. The good thing about separating the orange sacuce is that you can put as much as you want. But my husband would rather have it mixed in. Suggestion: don't use the entire 1 cup of brown sugar. Too sweet. Make sure you have enough time for preparation. I refrigerated with sauce overnight. Then did the last part the following day, it took about an hour. Over all this recipe was yummy.

I have been searching for an orange chicken recipe for a long time and I fell in love with this one.  I followed some earlier advice and cut the sugar by half the first time I made it.  My husband and I loved it so much we made it again the next night but forgot to cut back the sugar.  Still good, but little too sweet.  Half the amount of sugar was perfect.  This recipe will be a regular for us!

GREAT and YUMMY recipe! I used the ideas of cooking the chicken first and then letting it warmed in the oven while I made the sauce. I poured the sauce over the chicken just before serving. Made brown rice and veggies to go along. Good meal..just what I've been looking for. Thanks!

Nice recipe. We loved the way the orange flavor permeated the chicken after marinating, even before we poured on the sauce. (We marinated our chicken for just under the two hours, but it turned out great.) Works well with rice and broccoli.  The broccoli seemed to help counteract the sweetness of the chicken dish, which can be overwhelming if you put too much sauce on your plate!  A little sauce goes a long way.

Harry, I think I'm in love. This was such a delicious dish! I only let my chicken marinate an hour in the sauce, I used dried orange peel in the jar, and used ginger paste in the jar, I didn't have green onion so I tossed in onion powder. The only addition I did was approx. 1/2 tsp orange extract to the sauce. I cut 3 chicken breasts up and had plenty of sauce. I made the sauce separate and just poured it over the prepared chicken a couple of minutes prior to serving. My teen and I loved this dish but my husband did not. He admitted he isn't much of an Asian food fan anyway, so it wasn't the recipe. Thanks again, Harry, with recipes like this I'll never want to go out to eat again!

Very good recipe. Really did taste like the chicken we get at a favorite chinese place. My five year old daughter had three helpings and my husband had two. We will be making this recipe again. I followed the recipe just as written.

Great chicken! The sauce is a little on the potent side so I recommend you serve it on the side. I doubled the recipe since we have a larger family and found that it makes a ton of sauce. Plenty for veggies and rice. I also recommend not heating the chicken in the sauce for the above reason as well as keeping the breading from coming off.

I'd give it more stars if I could!  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  I did substitute white wine vinegar for the rice vinegar, and next time I will do as other reviewers said and save the sauce on the side rather than putting the chicken in it. Still good, but I think we'd enjoy it more with the chicken crispy and not coated in glaze so thickly.

Delicious. I prefer not to have my mouth on fire from the flavors of the food, so next time I will cut the amount of red pepper in half.

This recipe was AWESOME!!! It tasted just as good as our local Chinese restaurant. I love orange chicken so I added a little extra orange zest and orange juice. I didn't have any rice vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead and added just a pinch of sugar to it (as per substitutions I found on the internet). We all thought this recipe was the best and my 4 year old almost ate her weight in chicken. lol! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  :)

This was not good. I had high expectations...but no. The sauce was a bit bitter, and there simply wasn't enough of it anyway. That was really problem, the bitter taste, but it sure ruined a lot of good chicken

Really really good! Luckily I doubled the recipe as some went back for 3rds! I was told to put this in with our favourites and asked to make again tomorrow. Now those are good indications that this is one great recipe. I followed the directions as printed except kept my cooked chicken warming in the oven rather than adding it to the sauce. I will say that it took a little more time than my usual dinner prep time but the great flavours (which were also described to me during dinner)were certainly worth the result. I served over rice with steamed beans that I sauteed quickly in a little Asain Ginger Dressing (also from this site).

Tasted almost exactly like the orange chicken I can get at any restaurant!  VERY time consuming, but that doesn't take away from the flavor. Next time I think I will cheat a little on the chicken, but definitely not the sauce. I made this for my hubby's birthday. Orange Chicken is his favorite, and he was NOT disappointed!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

for the crispy coating, try half flour and half cornstarch and add some ground ginger to the mix.  It tasted more authentic Asian to my family.  The recipe is great the way it is too...

This recipe was fantastic. I made it for my boyfriend and my roommate and they loved it. My boyfriend is very quick to juge if he doesnt like something and he was speachless the whole time! There are two things I would change though. I was add pinnapple slices to it. It would make a nice sweet flavor to go with the sweet orange. Also I would add a little less cornstarch... I would also mix it in water before adding it to the sauce.. All in all this was a great recipe and I know I will be making it again and again!

This recipe was good but it didn't have an asian taste to me. It took awhile to prepare so I was pretty disappointed with the results. No one ate the leftovers and I doubt I'll ever bother to make this again.

This was excellent, I think my husband was a little surprised by the sauce being that I have never attempted anything like it before, but it was a success. My family loves this dish and we will be adding it to the rotation. The only thing that I did differently was I used the zest of 1 medium orange. Also I kept the sauce and chicken seperate until time to eat just to keep it from getting soggy.

I made a few changes to this and it turned out really well.  I forgot to add red pepper flakes and rice vingar to the sauce and I decided to omit the brown sugar and added some hoisin sauce instead.  I poured the sauce over chicken I had cooked in a wok with a little sesame oil.  I served it over white rice.

I made this recipe.  Was worried that the sauce would be too sweet and/or sour.  Modified recipe as follows:  Used 3T orange juice; 1T lemon juice; 1/4 cup rice vinegar; 1 1/2 T soy sauce; sprinkled orange peel and crushed red pepper in the sauce.  I only marinated for 1 hr.  Made chicken by rolling in beaten egg and then flour and cooked in olive oil.  Used sauce for dipping (did not add chicken to sauce). This recipe is execellent.

I LOVE this recipe. I don't really care for the battering, so I just leave the frying step out and my friends are always asking me when I am going to make this again. Definitely let it marinade as long as possible so the chicken stays juicy since it is not being fried.

This is a great recipe,, it has an excellent flavor. The reason that I gave it a 4 is because when I attempted to brown the chicken some of the flour came off, and when I added it back into the sauce it made little doughy blobs. Nest time I will not flour the chicken pieces.

My family and I loved this! The only things I did different is I breaded the chicken with eggs and cornstarch then I had to add a lot more cornstarch and water to the sauce at the end to thicken it up. I don't know how much for sure though... I just kept pouring some in until it was as think as I wanted it. 
Everyone should try this!!!

Quite excellent!  I did make some changes, however.  Instead of the 1 1/2 c water, I subbed in chicken broth.  I didn't have fresh ginger, but I had a very good quality Chinese ginger powder; no scallions, but I finely diced some white onion.  I coated the chicken in cornstarch, not flour.  In the perfect world I think the chicken should be deep fried, but in a sautee pan with hot oil, I was able to obtain very good results.  MOST of the coating stayed on, and the chicken was succulent on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I also added one green pepper and one red pepper, quickly stir fried after the chicken and excess fat were removed.  I removed the peppers to sit with the chicken, and then followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Picky boyfriend LOVES this.  He said "Give it a 5!"  So I did.

The only things I did differently is I put in 2 whole dried peppers in the sauce instead of using red pepper flake, and less cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers.  This was the hit of the party! Update: Having made this several times now, I have used both red pepper flakes and dried peppers. My personal preference is to use the whole peppers - be sure to break them up a bit. I've also made the sauce and put it on cubed chicken that was browned and not breaded.  I've thickened it a little less and used it as a dipping sauce too.

This was soo extremely good! It took a lot of time,but if you want to save time I suggest not frying it and just baking it. I also added hot red pepper and it made it spicy. I recieved a lot of compliments about how much better it was then the local restaurants.

The breading for this chicken is horrible!!! after adding the sauce it became a gooey mess,  the sauce however is very close to the real thing.  I add 2 Tablespoons of orange marmalade to it, and 1/4 teaspoon seracha hot sauce rather than pepper flakes.. Just make your family's favorite fried chicken tenders and toss in the sauce after, the whole marinating is pointless, the sugar burns in the oil.

My entire family loved it. Encluding all 5 kids.The only ingredient I didn't have was fresh ginger so I used my dried ginger. We usually have chinese carryout every friday night. But we are going to Disney World in a couple of weeks. So we cut out eating out for the past month to save money. So I needed to find asian type meals for our friday nights. So far this has been the best. I read several reviews first and did take the advise of cooking/browning the chicken transfered it to a baking dish  and kept it warm in the oven. Then prepared the sauce. I poured the sauce over the chicken and gently toss the chicken in the sauce to cover it.  Then I served it over fried rice.

I was a little unsure of how this recipe would turn out, but I am so glad I tried it!! This tastes just like it would at a resturant! I love this dish! I would definately recommend this to anyone who loves to be able to duplicate restruant dishes!!! Great find!

As good as a restaurant, and I really simplified the recipe, using only powdered ginger and garlic powder instead of laboring over/buying the others. Also omitted the orange zest, but squeezed the orange fresh :)

My family absolutely loved this!!! I used ground ginger and cut the lemon juice and soy sauce in half. I also mixed the cornstarch with orange juice and added it slowly. Since I tripled the batch, I used about 4 to 5 teaspoons of cornstarch. We just finished the leftovers and are already craving this AGAIN!!

This was SO GOOD! I have had to change to a gluten free diet so I made this with GF soy sauce and used rice flour plus a teaspoon of baking powder.  I used 3 breasts and only marinated for 30 min in about 1/2c  of marinade.  I also only used 2T. of corn starch which I thought was a better consistency.  This tasted just like my favorite Chinese hot spot I've had to give up.  Total comfort food!!!

Recipe was good, never made orange chicken, but bf likes it so I tried it. As always I read the reviews first and get ideas etc etc . I used 3 chicken breast doubled the sauce and I did not double the cornstarch , simmered it a bit to see if thickness was what I wanted , didnt need to add more cornstarch. Would use a little less lemon juice, BF isnt big on the lemon juice. I didnt have flour so coated it with cornstarch, and kept chicken in oven on warm until sauce was the consistency I wanted it to be. I like another reviewer had said, made it with basamti rice, and stir fried veggies from the frozen section at store. Topped with some chow mein noodles for some crunch. will make it again for sure, but maybe add it all together and make it as a stir fry.

This was sooooo good! I've tried several different orange chicken recipes, and none have compared to this. This was one of my husband's favorite dishes that I've made so far. I marinated it a bit longer, used a bit more orange juice, and added some mandarin orange segments.  I served it with rice and stir fried veggies. Like others, I also cut down on the cornstarch and put the chicken in the oven while thickening the sauce and then poured on top.

This recipe was FABULOUS! I plan to make it for our next dinner party!! My only suggestion would be to cut the cornstarch way down and watch the heat - too much of both will cut down on the amount of sauce you end up with...

Great flavor...next time I will definitely double the sauce, since the coating of the chicken seemed to absorb a lot of the sauce, and there wasn't too much left-over to  pour over rice.

Used what I had on hand, which is the recipe minus lemon juice (I added more orange juice instead) and substituted white vinegar for rice vinegar and added more garlic.  It turned out very well and I was surprised by how tasty it was!  And yes, it was more like sweet/sour chicken, rather than Asian Orange.  It was also a little bit gloopy, but very tasty!

I loved this chicken, it was so, so good. A little time consuming to prepare, but absolutely delicious to eat in the end. It doesn't taste exactly like the orange chicken I've had at chinese restaurants, but it's great all the same.

Everyone loved this.  I did reduce the cornstarch to 1 tbsp.  I would add broccolli next time and maybe cashews or peanuts.
My 13 yr old son made this (with my help) and the picture is the final product!

The sauce is delicious! Very close to a popular Asian franchise we love. I adjusted the recipe to serve 10, and I think I will only decrease the amount of orange zest for our taste.  I also was only able to marinate the chicken for one hour (family was hungry!), but the flavor was terrific regardless. My flour coating fell off most of the pieces; perhaps next time I'll just saute the pieces without a flour dredging, or I might deep-fry them instead.  I will definately be making this recipe again!  Thank you for sharing.

I thought the flavor was awesome...definetly restaraunt quality.  But not the texture...could be because my pan was too small.  I think the cornstarch ration was too sticky, also.  I like the idea of adding sesame oil to the sauce...that would make it perfect.

This recipe was good. Next time i make it I will use half of the orange juice the recipe calls for. I made sticky white rice and poured the chicken and sauce right over the rice. All in all it was pretty good. Hubby loved it.

I couldn't decide if I should give this 3 or 4 but decided on 4 because the flavor is quite good and I might try it again with some modifications.  Mine turned out quite starchy and soggy too; next time I'll follow some of the suggestions of other reviewers.  Overall pretty good, though, and does taste a lot like orange chicken at that mall restuarant.

This was okay, it may sound silly but it had too much of an orange flavor, it overpowered the rest of the sauce. I am giving it 3 stars because the base of the sauce is wonderful, I think I will experiment with it & leave out the orange next time, I like more of a sweet/spicy sauce. Also I agree with the cornstarch, as soon as I added it, it clumped up into little "dumplings". Overall okay, but my hubby didn't care for it at all!!

Being a vegetarian I substitued Quorn for the chicken, otherwise followed the recipe.  It was great! My husband, who is a picky eater especially when it comes to homemade Asian foods, loved this recipe.  I'll make it again.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I did not pour the sauce over the cooked chicken. I left that in a baking sheet, warming in the oven. I cooked onions, peppers, and broccoli and added the sauce to that mix (I doubled the sauce recipe, but I'm not sure I needed to).  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the sauce. With the veggies and chicken on top of some rice this was an excellent meal. Thanks for the recipe.

The amount of time and attention the chicken required, it was like I was babysitting a toddler. Also the number of pans I had to use made me want to smack myself with one of them.

The sauce was the worst part of my night. It was so thick it threw off the texture of the whole dish. I was excited to taste the hints of flavor in my rice but I could not do so, since this practically seared my taste buds. Also 1 cup of sugar?! WHY.

I would recommend cutting the sugar in half, adding more garlic and ginger, adding a vegetable, and just not making this recipe at all. 

In the end of it all, I ate two plates of it.

This is a really good recipe but using flour to coat the chicken creates more of a sweet and sour chicken style. For the hard coating on orange chicken, I coat the chicken in egg and corn starch (no flour) and fry twice.

I fried the chicken to get a crispier crunch, not healthy, but the family loved it!

My Orange Chicken turned out to be a giant glob stuck together. There were a few things that might have gone wrong, but for starters I, I watched the video and am confused how the cook was able to get 3 TBSP of corn starch and 2 TBSP of water to look liquid? I added an extra TBSP of water and it was still very thick.  Also, the flour did not adhere to my chicken very well, a lot of it fell of while I was heating the chicken in the pan.  Very disappointed in how this turned out, especially with the amount of time that I put into it, waiting for the chicken to marinate.

This was super, and my family enjoyed it very much. I didn't have rice vinegar, so I just used the white wine vinegar I had on hand. I wasn't hyper exact on the measurements of garlic and other spices, but still everything was great. I will definitely make this again!

I thought the flavor was too strong and not enough like sweet orange. My daughter liked it. I will probably look for a different recipe next time.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I only used 2 chicken breasts but kept the amount of the other ingredients the same.  I didn't have Rice Vinegar, so used White Wine Vinegar instead.  I coated the chicken in egg before breading, as was suggested, and kept it warm at 200 degrees after frying, although I wasn't sure the chicken was done, so I did add it back into the sauce.  I added broccoli to the sauce as well.

This was so good! I forgot to add the corn starch and while trying to took a shortcut and marinaded the chicken with about 1/2 cup orange juice, some sprinkles of ginger and garlic, and a handful of brown sugar.

We enjoyed this but prefer the General Tsos II recipe as far as Asian inspired chicken goes. I made the marinade the night before which was helpful time wise.

So I changed a couple of things but it turned out fantastic anyway. We didn't marinate the chicken in the sauce because my planning ahead skills aren't great, instead I patted the chicken dry the spashed some sauce over it before I dredged it through the flour. I also used gluten free "flour" because my son is being evaluated for allergies to gluten, dairy and nuts. He loved this recipe, it's been months since he's had any yummy Chinese.

This was superb,  and as others have noted a little too sweet. Next time I will use half the sugar.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of the wine, and added a half cup of orange juice leaving out the zest. I also used unsalted stock instead of the water and coconut aminos for the soy. It was delicious over rice with a handful of unsalted nuts.

The sauce seems complicated but it tastes amazing so totally worth the effort.  Next time I make it I will leave out the part about coating the chicken with flour. There was more stuck to the pan than on the meat, and I think it will taste fine without it

My family, even my 13 year old grandson,  loved it.  The only change was the marinating for 2 hours.  It was a last minute dinner idea and I didn't have 2 hours so I put it in the freezer for 20 minutes and it worked out fine.   Next time though I will cook the chicken in small batches as it didn't all get as crispy as I would have liked.

Will make it again, but it was way too sweet. Will drop to 1/2 cup brown sugar next time. My daughter got seconds which is a huge win in my book - even if her first serving was only a few bites.

Marinade not required. Dredging works better with a flour and corn starch mix (equal parts). Lemon juice is also not necessary, I prefer more of an orange flavor.

I like my food spicy, so I added a good bit of siracha. I added the cornstarch in the beginning, so the flour didn't stick well. I ended up really enjoying it without the flour, so I will leave that out next time. I am also going to double the sauce,  to mix it in with Jasmin rice. VERY YUMMY!!

Excellent orange chicken, exactly what I was looking for. I deep-fry the chicken pieces so the breading is crisper and stays on better, and sometimes add a little extra red pepper to the sauce. I don't simmer the chicken in the sauce, but instead pour the sauce over it when serving. It's become a favorite among my family.

Solid recipe! I have made this recipe twice now and each time it has been wonderful. Honestly, I think its better than takeout. I do add just tad more red pepper flakes because I love a nice spice but otherwise, I do not adjust the recipe at all!

Nice orange flavor and makes a fantastic glaze. Added bell peppers which worked well. Simple dish to make. Only drawback was the flour coating just wouldnt stick and what did turned mushy. I prefer the cornstarch coating on chicken which seems to fry up lighter and hold better to the chicken.

I made this great recipe. My daughter even took some to work for her lunch. 
Next time I will make the sauce a bit more liquid to cover more of the rice
Will definitely be making this a common meal for the menu!

My biggest difference is I had some leftover already cooked chicken I needed to use up. I made the sauce, with a heavy hand on the garlic, ginger, orange juice and zest, and chopped spring onion and a light hand on the Chile pepper flakes. My wife, who hates spicy food and vinegar, said it smelled delicious. I poured sauce over the cubed chicken and left in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Then I prepared a vegetable stir fry in my electric wok, bean sprouts, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, garlic, ginger and light soy sauce, and steamed some Jasmine rice.  As that cooked, I put the chicken and sauce back in the pan, brought it up to a simmer for a couple of minutes and then served it.  It was almost certainly the best Chinese style meal I have ever cooked. My wife didn’t try it as she had a molar extracted this morning and was on over-cooked Mac and cheese.   :(

I did make this for dinner.  It was very good, and tasted as good if not better than what we can get from take out Chinese place.  The changes I made were to replace 1/2 cup of water with orange juice with pulp, and the lemons I had on hand didn't produce 1/3 cup of juice, so i squeezed in lime juice to make the up the difference.  (oops..recipe called for only a 1/4 cup of lemon juice).  Be careful when cooking sauce, it will boil up an out of the pot quickly. I will be making this again!

I doubled the sauce because I really like having extra sauce for rice and veggies. Because I doubled the sauce, I used 4tbs. of corn starch instead of 6 tbs.

Very good and flavorable.  I would add about 1 up orange juice next time.  Didn't think there was enough orange flavor.  Would substitute 1/2 cup honey for brown sugar.  Otherwise delicious.

I made this about 2 weeks ago. This was a fantastic recipe. I ended up using this as my recipe to last me a couple  days for work. There was quite a bit of lunch jealously towards my orange chicken. Thanks for sharing your recipe Harry Wetzel!

Really liked this!  Didn’t have everything on hand and no time to marinate even.  Used ground ginger, garlic powder, apple cider vinegar, white onion oh my!

The only thing to work on is the chicken was not crispy and I didn’t put it in the sauce.

Otherwise this was great and hubby loved it too!

I made this with my daughters and it turned out delicious!  My only comment would be that the total time it took was much longer than stated. That being said I did double the recipe and used chicken thighs instead of breasts.

I made this but to keep it healthier I did not bread or deep fry the chicken. I also diced 1/3 of the orange and added to the sauce. The orange flavored really popped! It was far and away the tastiest orange chicken I have ever had!! I also made the buffet style green beans to go with it.

Recipe is fantastic! I was determined to make this in as few steps as possible so I skipped the marinading (getting sauce, so might be a superfluous step). Fried up the chicken first, took it out, made the sauce in the same pan and added it back. Also added some veggies (carrots, celery and onion) to make it a full meal served over rice. Delicious!

I've made this twice now and wow! It's amazing and the whole family likes it. I LOVE it and could eat this way more than I should. Some homemade fried rice is perfect with this dish. I added the cornstarch a bit at a time and haven't really needed the full amount. Kinda have to see where your sauce is and how thick you want it. Other than adjusting the cornstarch, I would increase the number of pepper flakes mainly because I like a bit more heat. This recipe is fantastic for any Orange chicken lover. The recipe is great as is so other than watching out for cornstarch levels I'd say give it a shot!

Made last night and family loved it.  Only changes was I used 1 cup water and 1/2 cup orange/mango juice  per other reviews.  Also as a lot of reviews stated, don't use quite so much cornstarch, maybe 2 t. cornstarch to 2 T. water.

DO NOT ZEST YOUR ORANGE OVER THE FRYING PAN MIXTURE!! Do it over a plate or paper towel. If the orange slips out of your hand, as it often does, you will be wearing your sauce or worse.

Make sure that the cornstarch and water is mixed quickly to smooth before adding to the sauce, or it will be lumpy and gross. If you get this step right,  the recipe will taste restaurant-quality great!

I really liked this dish and it was very easy to make.  I took the advice of a few previous reviews (very minor adjustments) but other than that everything else was as stated in the recipe:
1. I kept the chicken warm in the oven after cooking it so as to keep the coating crisp and did NOT add it to the sauce at the end.  I spooned the sauce over the rice and chicken for serving.
2. I used 1/2 flour and 1/2 cornstarch based on experience and a previous reviewer's comment about how cornstarch used in Asian cooking creates a crisp layer.
3. I only added a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce with just enough water to make it a slurry.  (I have a feeling 2 more tablespoons would have been too much.)
4. I stir fried some green beans and carrots to add to the dish.
My 13yo daughter really liked the dish but thought the sauce was just a bit too potent.  I agree in that it has a strong orange taste but I *love* that.  So if you don't like a strong orange flavor probably follow advice from previous reviews as to how to temper it.

It was too sweet for most of our taste but I thought it was just right.  The problem we had with it is when we added the corn starch mixture it instantly got lumpy.  I am sure it is because the sauce was too hot when I added it but I wanted to do it exactly according to the recipe.  If you make this, you should take the sauce off the heat and let it cool for a few before you add the corn starch!!  Otherwise, delicious.  The chicken was awesome before it got put back in the sauce.

I absolutely adore this recipe. My friends and I think this is probably one of the best orange chicken recipe we have ever tried. In my opinion, it's definitely better than the ones you'll have at the buffet or most Chinese take out places. I usually have to double the portion if I want to have seconds.

Amazing recipe, easy to follow with delicious results! I was looking specifically for something similar to Panda Chinese takeaway and this is it x) Instead of rice vinegar I added simple vinegar, worked just fine. And I decided to cover chicken pieces with batter instead of just flour, added there a bit of cornstarch for crispness, didn't regret.

It was wonderful.

Just think the amount of Cornstarch that it asks for was too much, maybe add it as needed; like start with 2 tbsps. then go from there for desired thickness.

I feed 8 people everyday and this recipe was fairly easy to follow.

I made it exactly according to the recipe to give it a fair review, but there were a couple of changes I would make to move this into 5 stars.  First, I would use chicken broth or bone broth instead of water to give the sauce a richer flavor.  I make my own, but you may have to adjust the salt slightly depending on what you use.  Secondly, I would put the chicken in a 50/50 mix of corn starch and flour, dipping it in an egg wash first.  In fact, I would skip the marinating step and do this with a little more salt mixed with the flour.  This was a very good sauce, especially the first night, but think it could improve overall with a couple changes.

My husband loved it,he said he would eat it every day! 
It was a little spicy in my opinion but good.
Instead of wiping off the skillet where I fried the chicken,I started heating the sauce in a different one so both would be done at the same time. 
Next time,I'll add way more oil to fry the chicken and coat the meat with beaten egg,and flour to make the outside crispy.
I  had to use flour instead of corn starch but it worked just as good.
Maybe I'll leave the pepper flakes out and add some more orange juice instead  but I'm definitely making it again.

Great recipe. Followed directions as written except for cutting cornstarch back as other reviewers stated and double breaded chicken with egg wash. Breading still came off chicken when finishing, but tasted great. Made broccoli, carrots, and zucchini to mix in with it. Will be making again!

I made it without the flour by stir-frying the chicken and adding the thickened sauce. I served it with brown rice. Next time, I'll add some green pepper and a bit more ginger and crushed red pepper for more "kick." Very easy to make if you don't bread the chicken.

The sauce is so flavorful.  I agree that the amount of corn starch should be reduced.  Next time, I will use the oven to keep the chicken warm.

After making this I thought that it tasted really good. I didn't follow the instructions exactly, I deep fried the chicken in peanut oil instead of browning it in a pan. I also followed some other comments and reduced the amount of cornstarch, I did 2 tsp of cornstarch to 1 tbsp of water. this didn't thicken the sauce enough so I added another mix of the same measurements and that made the sauce perfect in my opinion. I also strained my sauce so that I didn't have all the pieces of orange and garlic and it made the sauce much more enjoyable. Far better than some other orange chicken I have had.

This was delicious, we are gluten- free, so we used gluten- free flour, but it turned out great! We at  first thought that the sauce was going to be to sweet, but  once we added in the flour coated chicken, the flour soaked it up and it turned out great! This goes very well with rice and peas and corn as sides.

This recipe had a good flavor, but I didn’t care for it because the breading came off most of the chicken as I was stir frying it.  I read most of the reviews and even dipped chicken in an egg-white water mixture before tossing with flour mixture.  If I make again, I will skip breading all together and just stir fry with the marinade.  Thanks for the recipe!  Despite my opinion, my husband went crazy for it!

This dish was wonderful! Very tasty and easier than I thought it would be. I did end substituting a few of the spices because I didn’t have fresh, but it didn’t affect the flavor too much.

Everyone in my house cleaned their plates. This is a BIG DEAL - I have two picky eaters and one of them won’t touch 90% of the chicken dishes I make. I didn’t measure the orange juice or zest, I just squeezed half an orange and zested all of it. I also tossed in cornstarch instead of flour. Will be adding this to our rotation!

Really great flavor! Mine came out way too thick so make mix chicken and flour mixture in a bowl and then pick each piece of meat out so the excess flour doesn't go into the pan.

I cannot say enough about this recipe it was absolutely delicious. I added more orange zest and a few other minor flavour adjustments but they were minor and this was some of best chicken I have had in a while.  Give it a try you will not regret it and your family will think you’re genius cook.

I made this gluten free and without refined sugar by replacing the flour with brown rice flour (could have used 1/2 and 1/2 rice &  almond too just fine, I think or some kind of gluten free flour mix would work too) and replaced the brown sugar with 1/3 cup coconut sugar and 2/3 cup honey.  The taste was great! I also didn't take the time to marinate the chicken and it was still nicely flavored. I also used fresh orange and lemon juice, not the bottled/pasteurized stuff. Yum :)

I give 4 stars because the sauce was thin, even with adding some extra rice flour  once I realized. The honey may have contributed to this, so perhaps a little less water if you use honey. Next time I will try more cornstarch instead of rice flour to thicken. Also, with the instructions provided, the orange chicken had little to no crunch or breading. I will try to per-fect the crunch next time and with that part down, this could definitely be a 5 star recipe! If you like orange chicken, give it a try.

I upped the orange juice to 3/4 cup, used a bit extra orange zest, deleted the pepper flakes because I don't do hot spice, and only used 2/3 cup of the juice mix as a marinade so I had plenty of sauce left to pour over the cooked chicken.  Oh yes, I also used only about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the marinade.  With these changes the flavor was wonderfully orangey and tangy!

The sauce is really really good and quite close to my favorite Chinese food restaurant. Well worth the effort on the sauce. I would recommend buying a bag of frozen breaded chicken to simplify things on a busy night but stick to the sauce recipe. Will definitely be making this again.

This was really good.  I just used frozen popcorn chicken to make it into a quick meal. Yummy!  We will be making this again.

1 10 18 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/61024/asian-orange-chicken/ ... Rating this five stars because it's very good, but not quite perfect. I made minimal changes: subbed homemade chicken broth for water; a quarter t ground ginger for fresh; less cornstarch. 'Think maybe cornstarch was meant to be 3ts, not 3T. Since using broth, thicker, I should've gone with 2t, but used 3t. Thick; not so thick it was ridiculous, but less would be better. K liked; compared to Mongolian Chicken, which I didn't see. The sweetness is slight, balanced well with lemon juice, rice vinegar & ginger. 'Wonder if the ginger amount is for ground, not fresh. I added 1/4t ground, half the amount listed for fresh, & it wasn't detectable. Really glad I tried this. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Harry!

I made this recipe as it was except I left out the onions and hot pepper.  It turned out ridiculously delicious. I was sitting at the kitchen table eating it and my husband said I kept moaning. LOL, Um, I hope not, but I do  have a tendency to do that when I'm really enjoying a meal.  haha, it's not a bad thing. I loved this and will make this over and over. My daughter loves orange chicken, so I will teach her how to make this too.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

This recipe was amazing.  A nice mixture of sweet, sour and spice, something for everyone.  I don't think I would change a thing.  I may have added more water to the cornstarch mixture, but only to have more sauce. Thanks for sharing!

My family absolutely loves this recipe! The only problem is the flour comes off of the chicken while cooking.  Otherwise, it is delicious. The fresh orange zest really gives the chicken a nice kick!

I have made this before and will make it again - my kids LOVE it and not as sweet as one gets in restaurants.  My adjustment, as always, is decreaseing our plastic use is important, so I use any washable tupperware for marinating and flouring.  It is easier in any case.

This sauce is amazing! I followed a few other reviewers suggestions and subbed in cornstarch for the flour. I also cooked the chicken in batches and put it in the oven to keep warm, pouring the sauce over right before serving. The family thanks you for the awesome recipe!

Made exactly  as written and it was perfect!  The only thing I did different is cooked the sauce in one pan at the same time I cooked the chicken so it was done at the same time.

Reduce the amount of cornstarch to 1 tsp, or you'll wind up with enough mortar to help Trump build his wall. Truly, 3 tbsp ruined the sauce and frankly the entire meal. Plate full of goo. DO NOT put the chicken back in the sauce to boil, it just washes off the crust from frying. Also, to my taste, this can do without the pepper flakes entirely and a bit more brown sugar. With modifications, it may be okay. As is, not so much.

This was super tasty! The only changes I made were 1c water and 1c vegetable broth, and I added another tablespoon if orange juice. Next time I will probably lessen the brown sugar and starch and add hot sauce for a kick. Thank you for the recipe! I will be making this again!

Absolutely delicious!! At first I wasn't sure if it was going to turn out ok because it looked sorta liquidy, but I followed the recipe and it really came together beautifully.

P.S. It was 100xs better than buying it! Definitely worth it!

It was good, but I think just okay. I felt too much soy sauce making it somewhat salty so I would definitely cut down on that next time.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe - however I cut back on the sugar significantly.  I only used 1/4 cub brown sugar Spenda instead of the cup of sugar - I tried it both ways and the smaller amount of sugar was much more to my liking.  I also added red bell peppers sliced too for color.

The chicken had good flavor, but we didn't like the sauce. For one, following the directions made it too thick. Needed less cornstarch (I wondered so I didn't put in quite all of it and it still turned out too thick).  And second, the flavoring as a sauce just wasn't that great. 
Will probably make the chicken again, but will find a different sauce for the end result.

I reduced the water to 1/4 cup and increased the orange juice to about 1 1/4 cup, using frozen concentrated orange juice instead.  The total liquids remained the same but I varied the proportions.  I did not add rice vinegar because I didn't have any but it would have been a nice touch.  Including some shredded coconut  and maybe some cashews might be a nice add, too. I'll surely make this again.  Better than the processed stuff I get at the grocery.

I did not dredge the chicken in the flour mixture--I omitted it completely to save a few calories.  Instead, I just stir-fried it without.  The sauce was great!  I also didn't use quite as much brown sugar.  And, I added more ginger because I love ginger. Two of my four kids really liked it.  My husband and I both really liked it.  I will definitely be making this again.

I seasoned my chicken with Adobo, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika before adding the sauce.  It was good but I didn't get the frying part right so the texture was a little softer than I hoped.  I also used a little too much orange grind.  It turned out ok, but it wasn't my best meal.  I might try it again, but it was a lot of work.

It has been the best recipe so for. It had a great taste and I just can not say enough good things about it. The next time I make it I will use less cornstarch and lightly flour the chicken.

This is very good and if you want a crisp chicken piece, add cornstarch to the flour mixture. After floured, let sit for about 15 minutes and they'll be crispy fried! Also, there is a good General Tao recipe here and the frying method makes for crispy chicken too.

Made it as FODMAP Friendly by leaving out the green (spring) onions, using garlic infused oil instead the garlic, and gluten free flour.  Will definitely make this again, everyone loved it!

We doubled the recipe but even though two tablespoons of orange zest we only used 1 1/4 tablespoons. It still had lots of orange flavor  and it might have been too much if we had used the full amount.

Was pleasantly surprised! I've only ever made orange chicken in a slow cooker (disaster!) so I was a little apprehensive about this.  But it came out really good.  I didn't marinate it that long cause I was short on time, but next time I will marinate for longer.

Chicken was not crisp and sauce was a little too sweet.  Needs veggies to make it a meal and take away from the sweet sauce.  And I like sweet mains!

I think it would've been better with the "actual used meat in Chinese restaurants" but it was still good, and I don't think it would actually make it if is had domestic animals on the ingredients.

This was excellent. My partner & I loved it, but my 2 sons thought it had to strong of a citrus flavour and was a little too sweet (my 12-yr-old said it tasted kind of like desert. lol) However, they both had second helpings. I did add o.j. in place of the water to mix with the cornstarch, although I'm not sure that added much extra orange flavour. I personally loved it as is, and will make it again. I'll make more though next time so there's a little more left-overs. I doubled the sauce recipe, as I used about 5 or 6 smallish chicken breasts, and this was enough sauce to serve over the chicken, as well as the broccoli and red pepper I served it with (also very yummy). I would have liked the chicken to have gone a little further though, so will increase it even further next time so there are enough left-overs for at least a couple of servings.

Very good. I would skip the flouring as putting the marinated pieces into the flour made a batter, making it difficult to brown the chicken unless you deep fried it. Also using  1cup of sauce  for marinade didn't leave enough for sauce.

Made this exactly as written except I added some leftover steamed broccoli/cauliflower and sauteed onion and peppers after removing the chicken from the pan & before adding sauce. It was very tasty, sweet with a good hot kick, but it was a little too sweet for us. Some of the flour coating fell off the chicken as I was browning it so once I removed the chicken, I did not add it back to the pan until the very end. The sauce was hot enough to heat the chicken pieces. I served over brown rice. If I make again, I will cut the sugar in half & serve over noodles.

Didn't make any changes , but will definately  make some next time, way too much cornstarch from this one will probably drop the cornstarch to 3 TEASPOONS instead of Tablespoons.

This turned out fantastic. Much better than any restaurant version I've had. I used white wheat flour instead of all purpose, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. I served this with jasmine rice and we had to stop ourselves from eating all of it in one sitting.  It tasted just as good the next day when we had leftovers for lunch.

We liked this dish. The reason I didn't give it a five  is we thought the sauce was  too thick and would ensure it wasn't so thick next time.  Otherwise, quite tasty and enjoyable.

Well worth making but next time will add the green onions  at the final stage as they go a bit mushy when left in the marinate  overnight. 
Will definitely make again.

Unfortunately I discovered that I didn't have all the exact ingredients, but I did have near equivalents in most cases.  If substituting tapioca starch for corn starch, I recommend using half the designated amount, otherwise you will have a thick and gooey sauce.  Despite not having everything perfect, it was an excellent dish.  I look forward to making it again with the correct ingredients.

I liked the taste however with all the flour used on the chicken it just went all soggy and lumpy into the sauce as soon as it was mixed. Nxt time I will try breadcrumbs however the taste was nice

Pretty much followed the recipe plus recommendation to cut back the corn starch. Flavor was right on and my wife loved it. Still working on pan frying the chicken to my liking, but that is my problem. Great base to make this your own with veggies and other spices like sesame seeds.

It was very easy to make. My husband loved it. I thought it was a little too sweet. I added Broccoli, carrots and peppers and served it over fried rice.  I will definitely make this again. To change it up a bit, I might try shrimp instead of chicken.

Lesson learned after first attempt was to not bother coating chicken for frying. Instead I will just cook marinated chicken in a bit of sesame or peanut oil then coat with sauce. Marinade is delicious.

I left out the red pepper flakes and orange zest.  Otherwise followed the rest of the recipe.  It turned out great!  My husband loved it!  We'll definitely be making this again and again and in bigger quantities for awesome leftovers.

This recipe is awful. The result, if one follows the directions implicitly, is one overly sweet gooey mess. The instructions call for the chicken to be cut in 1/2-inch pieces and then after marinating and coating with the flour mixture to brown them on both sides in a large skillet. How can you turn 1/2-inch pieces over to brown on both sides? One has to stir fry them in effect. Why doesn't the recipe say that? I don't believe the cornstarch/water mixture had enough water. when I added it to the hot marinade and turned down the heat, the cornstarch mixture immediately coagulated in lumps rather than thicken the sauce.  The end result was rather disgusting to eat. A complete failure as far as I am concerned. Other recipes using cornstarch usually combine it with more water than called for in this recipe. Suggest you delete this recipe and start over. The idea is good and orange chicken is a popular Asian dish. But no this one.

OMG this is  SO GOOD!  Only changes I made were 1) used juice from freshly squeezed oranges and lemons 2) added  a bit of seame oil in place of  some of the olive oil 3) reduced the amount of cornstarch, and 4) kept the chicken warm on a baking sheet  in the oven and then drizzled the final sauce  overtop, rather than cooking in the pan in the sauce.  Excellent!  Prep takes a bit of time but is worth it! Thanks to the submitter!

I didn't have green onions or ginger root, so I omitted the onions and used ground ginger. I also reduced the brown sugar to a third of a cup. The flavor was amazing, even though the flour coating was a goopy mess. Next time I will take others suggestions and use a wok, reduce the amount of corn starch and add some veggies. I may also just brown the chicken in olive and sesame oil and skip the flour mixture. And I will replace half the water with orange juice and skip the brown sugar altogether

It was OK but not quite the time, effort, and all the varied ingredients it took to make it. Grating orange peel, marinating for two hours, etc -- lots of time and effort for a meal that was a little too sweet and too one note. I *might* make it again but I'd reduce some of the brown sugar and stir in some broccoli or snow peas to give the dish some texture.

A bit more time consuming than I was hoping but it sure did taste good. Far better than the food chain named after a cute bear.  Next time I will use more chicken.

I loved the sauce...absolutely delicious!! The chicken lost that crispy texture it had after frying once I cooked it in the sauce and acquired a slightly mushy texture which was not what I was looking for yet the sauce is really good. This recipe came together quickly despite the list of ingredients and had big flavor. Next time I think I will fry the chicken then add a little bit of sauce and drizzle the remaining sauce over the chicken when I serve it. Various vegetable can be added to enhance this dish; broccoli, snap peas, carrots, etc. Thank you for the great recipe!

I really did love this recipe. The bit of heat from the red pepper flakes was a great addition. I'm using more of the Asian inspired recipes on this site and am thrilled at not having to "take out" anymore because the recipes here are actually better than what comes out of those white boxes.

Not sure why, but this was really not good.  I didn't not have rice vinegar, so I used white vinegar.  Could this have made it really sour with a strong vinegar taste?  That was the result; not flavorful, just really sour and strong vinegar tasting.

I made this tonight by exactly following the recipe.  Below is my reservations to this recipe, I don't think I will make this again, at least without modifying:

1) 1 cup of sugar was too much.  Think about the orange juice which is already very sweet.  After eating, I could feel the level of my blood sugar in my system was way too high that I honestly felt this meal was bad to eat.  2) Marinating chicken with 1 cup of source was too much. My chicken was floating in the sauce liquid. 1 cup of sauce would marinade at least double amount of chicken.  3) after browning chicken, adding the rest of the sauce made flour coating to come off, making the sauce thickened unevenly.  My sauce became like orange version of white sauce.  Adding cornstarch made this sauce unmanageably thick. Coating chicken with flour should have been ok if the chicken was deep fried or baked in my opinion.  Pan-fry will NOT work! Also I would make sauce thickened on its own (without chicken), and then, quickly coat chicken with sauce by pouring sauce over the browned chicken in a large new cold plate or baking pan at the very end.  I will definitely NOT add cornstarch to the pan with chicken!!

Overall, it didn't meet my expectation.  However, I say that the sauce was indeed tasty, so I will just keep the recipe for the sauce.

Orange sauce is tasty, the only thing I may have done differently with that is go a little heavier on the OJ, ginger, and garlic. I also added the cornstarch/water mixture to it slowly and by adding half at a time. I used chicken thigh meat and deep fried them separate with corn starch instead of flour....and I didn't use an entire cup of it (probably a 1/4 of a cup). Dressed it with sauce when I plated it because I love me some crispy chicken. Came out good, the sauce recipe is definitely a keeper for me.

This was a big hit with my family.  It is a very flavorful dish with the orange, ginger and red pepper. I used boneless - skinless thighs as they were the same price.  The dark meat was very juicy and tender. I did not marinate the chicken as I didn't have time. It still came out great.

This was delicious! Definitely orangey and the red pepper flakes give it a little kick. Cooked the chicken pieces on my cast iron and they came out nice and crispy, not soggy at all like other reviews. I like to flatten my chicken a little to break up the proteins with a meat mallet prior to marinating so I get a nice juicy tender chicken. Came out perfect!!
Served over rice and steamed broccoli! 
Would definitely make again!

The only changes? I doubled the sauce since Saucier is always better in our family!  And since I didn't have fresh ginger handy, I used powdered. Two hulking young sons and a food loving husband cleaning seconds and thirds, and voting this into the dinner recipe rotation tell me all I need to know!

'Kay so I'm only giving it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe to a 'T'. It looked awfully over-complicated, so I cut out a few steps. I did not marinate the chicken, nor did I cook the chicken in a skillet.  1.) I coated the chicken in shake & bake and baked it in the oven. 2.) I made rice (throwing in 1 chicken bullion cube in with the water) 3.) For the sauce, I skipped the red pepper flakes and cut the brown sugar in half. (1 cup of B. Sugar would have made it way too sweet in my opinion. Anyone making this for the 1st time should  taste-test the sauce with 1/2 cup brown sugar before adding more.) I also cut the vinegar in half, but my Dad said it could have used just a touch more. 4.) So aside from those changes I mentioned, I followed the sauce pretty much exactly. I then served the shake & bake chicken on a bed of rice and put the sauce on top of it. It was very good; I was quite happy with this recipe. It was basically a sweet and sour orange sauce. 


The recipe the way it is, seemed like too much work. I honestly don't think marinating the chicken would have changed the flavor; and then to take the sauce out of the skillet, put the breaded chicken in the skillet, then take the chicken back out of the skillet and put the sauce back in was way too many unnecessary steps. This can be simplified, and simplifying it is what I did. Also, I would have expected the coating to the fall off the chicken while it was in the skillet, which according to other reviewers thi

Love this recipe! From the marinade, to the sauce, everything was perfect! I did take the advice of some of the reviews and I substituted half the water with orange juice. Pineapple juice would also be good I would think. I was really looking for that citrus flavor. I was also in a rush to make dinner for my family so I skipped marinating it for 2 hours and settled for 30 min. Tastes just as good but I imagine the marinade really sinks in after 2 hours. Lastly, I upped this recipe by quite a bit since I was making dinner for 14 people (big family!) and I mostly improvised by adding water, orange juice, lemon juice, sugar, and cornstarch. I used 4 chicken breasts but i only doubled the liquids and added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. I only added about 1/4 cup more sugar because my parents are fond of overly sweet food. And as a bonus, I took the orange I grated for the zest and squeezed the orange juice out for some fresh flavor. Then I cut up two more oranges and tossed it in with the final product. 

overall- I loved, loved, loved the recipe though I did take quite a liberty with it.

Delicious!  I took other reviewers advice and didn't add the chicken into the sauce, to keep it on the crispier side.  I also added broccolli, and will try other veggies next time, like red peppers, snow peas, and carrots.  I also used only 1/4 cup brown sugar, because we do not like overly sweet sauces.  My husband and I both loved it!

This was so good.  I did not have time to marinate the chicken but it still turned out delicious.  My husband thought the breading on the chicken was a little too heavy, but the next time I make it I will omit the breading and just put the sauce on "naked" chicken.  The sauce was amazing and I served it separately from the chicken and was able to freeze the leftover sauce to use the next time I need to make plain chicken more exciting.

I didn't marinate the chicken ahead of time because I am a mom that makes  dinner at the last minute, but it still turned out wonderful! I added a little more orange juice and less water to the sauce for more orange flavor. I also used a gluten free four (and gf soy sauce) to make this recipe gluten free. It turned out great.

When we go out for Chinese food, most of the time we order orange beef or orange chicken. So glad I can now make it at home and it will taste every bit as good. This dish was fabulous. Could not stop eating it. WIll add some veggies next time.

But I didn't do it with Chicken. I made it with beef strips. Came out as good as any recipe for this that I've tried. Will cut down the amount of corn starch next time. It was a bit thick. Had to add a bit of sherry to loosen it up.  Was good for breakfast two days later also!

I will make this again, for sure.  My husband is a picky eater but he liked the flavour.   I think the cornstarch to water ratio is incorrect.   There was way too MUCH paste on the chicken..  I like the idea of adding pineapple juice!  It will be perfect next time.

Family loved this dish.  Had to substitute orange marmalade for the orange zest and it worked perfectly as a substitute.  No left overs on this dish. I will deep fry the chicken next time to get more crispness.  This is a keeper.  Can't wait until chicken thighs go on sale again.

This was an easy and delicious dish. I modified the base of the sauce by using more orange juice vs. water - it was soooo good!  We made jasmine rice and a side of a brussel sprout and carrot saute.  All yummy!  One note:  I think the cornstarch measure is off - the sauce becomes immediately gloppy with that much cornstarch mixture - using less cornstarch and more water or OJ would make a thick glossy sauce.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe and yes I liked it very much. Most times if I have all the ingredents I try to make it as is. Most of the family enjoyed it. My husband thought it was too much work for a meal. but overlall a hit.

This was so delicious our conversation at the table was about when we could make it again! I followed the original recipe but added more orange juice and less water, using 1 cup water and 1/2 cup OJ.  I wanted to be sure to have enough orange flavor, since I didn't have the zest it called for.
We have wonderful Chinese restaurants in the area where we've enjoyed a similar dish.  This was just like it, with all the flavor, and even more tender chicken!  A keeper for sure!

Great recipe. I tried the method of dipping chicken pieces in egg/water mixture prior to flour. Half held up, the other did not. Even with super gentle handling. Process can be improved but the ingredients and overall recipe is right on. Husband said "its better than PF Changs."

Substituted lemon juice for orange zest, marinated overnight and coated with corn starch instead of flour.  Was a little sweet but very flavorful, next time I will cut down on the sugar.  Second time around, marinated overnight, coated with flour and used half the sugar, put in the oven as others suggested and the end result was fabulous, upgraded to 5 stars!

I love the light and tangy orange flavour against the sweetness of the sauce. I personally added more lime juice to the sauce instead of vinegar on my second batch as the vinegar tends to be too strong. Only recommend to add vinegar if your lemon/lime/orange juice isn't sour enough (but only a little!). Overall it's a great dish. And thanks to whoever recommended to add sesame oil :)

This recipe is AWESOME! It's sauce has great, restaurant-quality flavor! The only thing I would change is the amount of cornstarch; I would reduce it to 1 tablespoon. I saw other people's suggestions for reducing it to 2 teaspoons, but I like this sauce thick. Also, I recommend using 3 chicken breasts rather than 2; there's a lot of extra sauce. You should keep the chicken warm in the oven at 250 degrees (any higher and it might burn), then put one layer of the chicken on a deep-dish plate and pour sauce over, or, if you wanna be REALLY fancy, take a plastic bag and pipe sauce over each piece of chicken. This will reduce the amount of excess sauce. But, you can also just prepare chicken as whole breasts, then pan fry as breasts, then serve as whole breasts. That's great for a family with big appetites. Definitely a keeper!

Followed other advice by using a mixture of cornstarch and flour and keeping the chicken warm in the oven so it stays crispy. Very good.

I have made this recipe more times than I could count and should have submitted a review long ago. 

I always double the recipe but sometimes make some changes. Often, when I double the recipe I will use 3 breasts and about 1 to 2 cups of chick peas. I usually use the dried peas and re-hydrate them first but have used canned.

I have stopped coating the chicken and just cube and cook with salt and pepper. This recipe is so tasty that no one noticed until I told them. I have also just made the sauce and cut up a ready cooked rotisserie chicken.

I will usually cook up rice for my husband but for me and the kids I serve the dish over top of thin/ angle hair whole wheat noodles.

This is an absolute family favorite with all three of my very picky kids. Letting it marinate over night is an absolute must in my opinion. I always serve this over a bed of white rice and I top it with chow mein noodles for crunch. It is a hair bit spicy for my crew so I go easy on the red pepper flakes. I also never use green onion as it is not needed and I use garlic powder and it works.I also use ground ginger (like you find in the spice section). I have made this dish so many times now. It does take a bit of work but it is totally worth it. I like to double the recipe and pour the thickened sauce over each individual plate of chicken and rice. It is one of the best dishes I have ever eaten.

I've made this recipe at least a half dozen times and have not been disappointed! Never have I had the foresight to marinate the chicken. I have skipped step 2 every time. I boil the sauce while cooking the chicken then turn off the heat and combine before serving.  I haven't ever used lemon, either. I've always substituted extra fresh squeezed orange juice. This is definitely a family favorite and I'm so so thankful to have a great recipe for a takeout fave! I double the sauce recipe and we serve it over basmati rice with crushed red pepper for those who like it hot!

This recipe is amazing. It is a family favorite and regularly is on our table. It can make the chicken soggy, so I usually just put the chicken over rice and pour the sauce on top. Delicous!

Great recipe! I did some changes by following some of the people's suggestions which was to reduce the cornstarch amount to 2tsp and dissolve it with 1tbsp of water. That was the only thing I did different and the rest I follow as directed. Thank you, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

The kids and husband asked me to make this again! I was running short of time, so I didn't take the 1 cup of sauce to marinate the chicken. I did like that I had a lot of sauce because of this :) I did however add some garlic powder, onion powder, and Chinese 5 star powder to the flour (to taste) for the chicken. What a great recipe! This will go into rotation.

This was fantastic.  Everyone really liked it.  My son and I made it together and it was fun.  Consider who you serve this to because you might need to reduce the red pepper flakes.

I did follow the recipe, except that I used cider vinegar instead of the rice vinegar. I used less cornstarch also. Next time (and that will be soon according to my husband) I will try 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup of cornstarch, (good idea). I also like to idea of frying up the chicken and keeping it in the oven and then serving with sauce poured over, instead of putting the chicken back in the sauce for 5 mins.

This is a good basic recipe.  I didn't add the orange zest, simply because I don't care for a strong orange flavor.  Also, I just baked the chicken breasts whole after marinating, cut them up, and then added to sauce.  I did not  flour and fry them.  It's a lighter, cleaner tasting dish that way.  I will definitely make this again.  My son was requesting Chinese and this was a great way to satisfy that craving with a healthier option.

Better than the take out variety.    I  used 3/4 c. orange juice and 3/4 cup water.  Also added 1 large, (more than the 1/2 tsp. called for) minced, garlic clove, 2 large green onions, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and lightly packed the brown sugar.  Fried the chicken in 2 tbsps olive oil and 1 tbsp. sesame oil with 1 large clove minced garlic. Set to drain on paper towels.   Sautéed red, yellow and orange pepper, carrot strips, broccoli florets until cooked but still crisp. (could steam the vegetables or microwave to save time)  Added the leftover marinade to the sauce and thickened with 1 tbsp cornstarch and some of the cold marinade.  I  did not cook the chicken in the sauce, but may try that next time.  Served chicken, vegetables and sauce on Jasmine rice topped with chopped green onion. Also served pork egg rolls as a side and used the sauce to dip it in.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.
  Update...It was very good fresh but oh my goodness,  the sauce was fantastic two days later!

I like it though it does take some prep time. I did need to add some Sriracha and a little Sesame Oil. Also added broccoli and carrot for color and benefits.

Delicious! My 9 year old son loved it.  I added broccoli & carrot sticks. Served over rice. A little bit of work but was worth it. My sauce came out a little clumpy but will try some of the  tips next time. Definitely will make again.

I doubled the recipe and as a few other reviewers suggested I added some sesame oil to the pan with the olive oil and dipped the chicken in an egg wash first.  This was absolutely delicious.  My husband and mother-in-law couldn't stop talking about it!  The breading did fall apart slightly in the sauce at the end like others noted, but it was so good I didn't even care and neither did anyone else.  I don't think pouring the sauce over the chicken would be as good though because you really want that breading to soak up all that flavor.  Incredibly delicious!  I will be making this again... and again... and again!

The sauce is perfect but you need to double the amount of orange juice. I completely ignored the chicken instructions and instead cut the chicken into bite sizes, soaked the chicken in milk, placed chicken in a ziplock bag with planko, salt, pepper & shake to coat and fry.

I've never had orange chicken from a restaurant before but I imagine it would taste exactly like this. It was a little sweet for my taste, so if I were to make this again I would increase the red pepper flakes. Also, as other reviews suggested, I would decrease the cornstarch. I added some chives and sesame seeds on top and served it along side teriyaki peppers & pineapple and over rice.

Loved the orange sauce would not change a thing.  Made two extra to freeze so I can make more later.  However would change the chicken.  Instead of breading and pan frying I'll just thrown the marinated cubes into the skillet with pan spray or maybe try baking them.  Then add sauce.  Will save quiet a few calories!  Overall glad I tried it today

Tasted better than most Chinese restaurant orange chicken. Will use less rice vinegar next time. I went according to the recipe and was fairly overwhelmed by the vinegar taste.

Very good! I am trying gluten free so I opted to just cook the chicken in 1 cup of sauce instead of coating it in flour and frying it and then added brocolli to write rice and poured the thickened sauce mixture over it. Yum! a keeper!

This is a good recipe,  a healthier version of orange chicken. The sauce isnt all that tasty sp I added an extra orange and some extra ginger to it.
Overall we were all pretty satisfied.

I followed recommendations from others:  I double coated the chicken, I fried it in Sesame Oil, Used Sriracha and used the left over marinade in the sauce.  I marinaded it in the fridge over night and the following day.  I served the sauce separately so you could have as little or as much as you wanted. I shared it with neighbors who reported that it was "Fricken Delicious!"

We made this a few weeks ago. My teenage daughter actually made the marinade up. She substituted 1/2 the amount of water for pineapple juice as someone else suggested.  It came out so good. Everyone loved it!!

Today I just made the marinade and I forgot to substitute the pineapple juice so instead I just poured a can of pineapple rings with the juice into the done marinade and also sliced up the orange that I used to get the zest from.  Will add the chicken to the marinade once it's cold and let it marinade over night.  Tomorrow I will cook it in the crockpot with carrot chips broccoli, red and green peppers and onions. We will serve it over white rice.  Hoping these changes still yield great results.

This was very good! I will have to tweak the sauce a bit, as it was a tad tart for my taste, but I think it's an easy fix. The chicken alone was delicious and crispy. Will definitely make this again!

This is so good!  Very similar to restaurant without the corn syrup etc that so many use.  I used wheat flour, grape seed oil, coconut aminos, and cane sugar to make it a bit healthier but flavor was still great.  Instead of rice I put chicken on a bed of spinach, kale, and coleslaw mix.  Will make this many more times in the future.

I made this with tofu and it turned out great. Tofu is a little more difficult to coat with the flour mixture, as it can easily break. I would not suggest shaking the tofu in a bag, but rather to coat each piece one by one before adding it to the frying pan. 
Overall, this recipe was rather involved, but the end product turned out with a great taste. Next time, I'll play around with the amount of sugar because it seems like a lot -- I think some honey would have a similar effect.

Great flavor, marinated over night, awesome orange flavor.  the sause could use some extra liquid, a little extra orange juice would make sense if added near the end, haven't tried this moddification but it would both serve to add even more orange flavor andmake the sauce go farther.

YUMMY!!!!!!! This sauce would be fantastic on salmon.  I used half flour and half cornstarch and used one egg with a little water for breading.  I served with stir fry veggies and fried rice...MMMMMM.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing :)

I thought this recipe had good flavor but my boyfriend didn't like it at all. We both agreed that it ended up having a very weird texture once the sauce was mixed with the breaded chicken. After reading other reviews about breading in a different way or simply pouring the sauce over the chicken I strongly suggest this. We felt that IF we happen to make this again we won't even bread the chicken at all. It really was just ok.

This  orange chicken was great I made this for dinner a few minutes ago and we all loved it. I did dip the chicken in the egg wash before  the flour batter. This taste better than Chinese carryout. It is lighter in texture and taste. The only change I made was substituting vinegar for lemon since I did not have on hand. This recipe is a keeper!

5 STARS - awesome as is, but less cornstarch or cooking sauce with starch and then adding to cooked chicken. Added green onion slices on top. Be great with steamed broccoli =)

I have made this recipe on several occasions and every time people rave about it! It has great flavor, is sweet and tangy, and goes great over a rice. Only complaint is I seem to always have trouble getting the breading to stick to the chicken really well - no matter how much oil I put in the pan it still falls off. Other than that, this is an easy recipe loved by even picky eaters (like my brother) who "Don't like Asian foods"!

Was WAY too sour!!! Next time will be adding extra brown sugar to bring out the sweetness of the orange juice.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  Personally, I did not like the vinegar flavor and I think i would have prefered there to be more of an orangey flavor.  The Sauce turned out too solid for me.   However, my family put a star by it and they really enjoyed it.

Tried it. Didn't have enough time to refrigerate for 2 hours. Came out with a little to much vinegar taste, but it was good with rice. Might make this again.

Taste is great if you like sweet. Next time will try coating chicken with egg before breading, use cornstarch instead of flour, and maybe reduce the brown sugar a little. Had to use at least 1T of cornstarch for the sauce because it wasn't thickening but didn't keep track of how much it was. Another reviewer said they left out the pepper flakes because they don't like heat but this dish is very mild. We don't like hot at my house (don't even have a bottle of hot sauce or Sriracha) and have made many dishes spicier than this.

I was hopeful because the reviews on the were great, but we were so disappointed. Everything was going fine until we had to reheat the sauce and add the cornstarch. As soon as put the cornstarch/water mixture into the sauce, it curdled. So we had to pick clumps of cornstarch out. We ended up gradually adding it to the sauce. Then when we added the chicken, all the breading came right off and our Asian Orange Chicken turned into a breading soup of sorts. It was awful. If I had any advice it would be to skip the whole flour process and you might have more luck than we did. The taste was OK, but panda express is still better.

The taste was good. Watch the corn starch when putting it into the sauce. Mine clumped up immediately, and I had to redo the sauce.

Just made this for dinner, though it got good comments from the family it seemed to take a lot of time to make for the end result. As with many other reviews, I used an egg and then corn flour to batter the chicken. As well as not adding as much corn flour to the sauce to thicken it but really I should have as it came out a bit too runny for our liking. Next time I make it I'm debating whether or not to use a deep fat fryer to get the chicken nice and crispy seeing as they weren't that crispy and the batter seemed a bit under cooked. Marinading the chicken for about three hours before hand really helped make the chicken lovely and tender.

The flavor was right on. However I agree with everyone...it's way too much cornstarch. Next time I will only use 2tbsp. I added steamed broccoli and sweet snap peas and toss at the end. I will make again!

This was perfect in every way! Hubby said orange was a tad strong but I added a tad more zest in it. No big deal to adjust flavors! The chicken I found that if I add 1/4 Cup corn starch, I let the chicken sit in the mix until I got ready to fry. VERY crispy! This was WAY better than anything you can get at the store and I felt it was even better than our high end Chinese place up the road. This is a keeper!

I thought the sauce was very good but I found I had to add an extra tablespoon of water to the 3 tablespoons of cornstarch because it was pretty much the texture of icing otherwise and I probably should have browned the chicken a little bit longer because the flower didn't exactly stick too well onto the chicken and wasn't as crisp as I would have liked...but that was my mistake! besides that it was excellent!!

I just made the sauce and served it on the side with my own tempura. Oh my gosh this sauce is amazing!!! I didn't bother to measure the orange and lemon juices, I just squeezed one lemon and one orange.  My picky 11 year old even tried to talk her brother out of his share! I will make this sauce next time we have company.

This was amazing. My guests thought that it tasted better than at the restaurant. The only problem I encountered was the flour (that was coating to the now fried-chicken) came off during the last stage of the process and resulted in a thicker than normal sauce, or paste, which should have only been a glaze. Using a wok would have probably fixed the problem. Oh, and don't be an idiot like me and add the cornstarch before mixing it with water! Lol

I love this recipe. It has a good balance of spicy and sweet. It will also satisfy your taste for orange chicken without paying for take out. I would suggest toning down on the cornstarch. It made the sauce too thick for me.

AWESOME ! I will never buy this at a take out restaurant again, I didn't make many substitutions, had no ginger so used more garlic, no red pepper flakes just used a few dashes of Crystal hot sauce. Served with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. This dish was so good my kids asked for it again tonight for dinner. This is definitely a keeper!

This came out perfectly! The chicken was crispy and the sauce was flavorful even though I had to slightly improvise as I ran out of some ingredients (I doubled the recipe to feed more). It was worth all the work and I'll likely make it again.

Loved this!  Not overly sweet and well balanced.  I didn't bread and fry the chicken and opted to just saute in some peanut oil until cooked through to make it healthier.  Would make again.

Very good recipe with modification.  I used some of her suggestions. I also modify the water/OJ ratio. I used 1 cup of OJ to 1/2 cup of water. Also used orange marmalade. I took the orange along with 3/4 of the sauce and blend it to make it look more like a local eatery. The sauce had a very strong orange flavor which we like and a smooth texture because of the blender.

Loved it! Panfried the chicken with olive and sesame oil and only added them in the sauce just to coat. I also, before adding the chicken cooked snap peas in the sauce then added chicken. Came out delicious.

This is one my family (and friends) favorite meals. It is so flavorful, especially when you let the chicken marinate for 1-2 days.
I make a few changes when I don't have all the ingredients on hand. For example, I use ginger powder instead of fresh ginger.  I'm not a fan of spice so I omit the fed flakes and it still tastes divine. The orange zest, while it makes it taste great can be left out and I often do. 

If you are looking for a lower fat option you can bake the breaded chicken at 375 for about 10 minutes each side. It doesn't get as crispy, but still delicious. Then just add to the sauce when cooked. 
This makes scrumptious left overs.
Put it over rice and some steamed broccoli and you have a fantastic dinner

Perfect. I loved it, but my 4 yr old found it a bit spicy. Since I always leave the sauce off and let each person dictate the amount of sauce, it worked out wonderfully for everyone. Next time I may leave out the red pepper flakes just to tone it down for my 4 yr old, but otherwise it was wonderful!

So good. Time consuming but totally worth it! I recommend double dipping the breaking and then deep frying. Will make this again and again. We love this kind of chicken and now I feel like I can eat it without feeling like its mystery meat :)

LOVED this recipe.  Time intensive, but worth the effort.  I used fresh oranges and lemons for juice.  I also replaced some of the water with pineapple juice and cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  Instead of olive oil, I used sesame oil, instead of corn starch, arrowroot powder.  I made brown rice and stir fried snow peas, broccoli flowers, grated carrots, and diced red peppers.  Rice went on the plate first, followed by the vegies, then the chicken, and last the sauce.  Delish!

Was pretty good, I used 1/2 the sugar which maybe made the taste a little more tart than sweet. 

The dish does look good. Presentation is excellent w/ broccoli or other greens. 

NOTE: Marinade overnight if possible, though I marinated for 20 mins and was still good.

This is my favorite food on earth. This recipe is fabulous. We make this regularly and get great results every time. Here are the adjustments I usually make: I switch the amounts for the lemon and orange juices because I like mine extra orangey. I use less than 1 cup of the liquid to marinade so I have more sauce at the end. I coat the chicken in egg in between marinating and flouring. I also add a bit of corn starch to the flour mixture.

**Here is the secret to getting your breading to stick: Don't crowd the chicken in the pan! If the pieces are too close together, steam gets trapped in between and the breading with fall apart. Cook them in batches. We keep ours warm in the oven on a cooling rack over a jelly roll pan while we do the subsequent batch(es). 

Another note: I find that I use a different amount of cornstarch every single time. I don't know what variables are at play, so I don't add the whole amount at once. Add some, see if the sauce is thick enough; if not, add more, etc. Make sure that you mix your cornstarch thoroughly with cold water before adding to the sauce, otherwise it can clump.

I made this recipe with some rice and stir fry vegetables for dinner it was delicious. The chicken was super citrusy with a little bit of a kick from the red pepper in the marinade. Although I did a few things differently: I put some salt, pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, and powdered ginger in my flour. I used sesame oil to brown my chicken and I substituted ponzu for the soy sauce. (like soy sauce but has a citrus flavour to it)

I put together a variation of the sauce on my first try. I used lime juice, juice from 1 orange and its zest, then 3 tbsp of orange (reduced sugar) marmalade. I was crunched for time so it marinaded for 2 1/2 days. I slowly added the cornstarch and water, and still only used about 1/2 of the slurry. 
When I have a little more time to prep - I'll hand write my grocery list, and get all of these ingredients rather than using the check boxes and getting lost in application codes. That's another post. I digress.
Great ingredients, great mix of take out flavors. I'm taking this to work with me so I don't have to give in to that $$$ plate of orange chicken.

There is no need for one full cup of brown sugar, reduce to 3/4 cup or even less. I also reduced the lemon juice and vinegar by able a tablespoon each. Add sauce right before serving.

Great recipe!  This was my first time making any chinese chicken and this is a keeper. I ended up making a lot of extra sauce which i kept seperate and plan to freeze and use later for either shrimp or pork. I thought the flavors were perfect so only variation I did was light on red pepper for my 4 year old.  Yummy!

This was wonderful! Very forgiving too, I didn't have time to marinate my chicken, so I just made the sauce, browned the chicken, and served, and it still turned out flavorful. Next time I'll plan ahead to marinate and I'm sure it will be even better. Only change I made to the sauce was that I used more orange juice in place of the water. I juiced two lemons, two large oranges, and then added just enough water to make up the difference, about half a cup. I will do this next time too, the flavor was perfectly balanced for our tastes. Thanks for the great recipe!

My apologies, this is not an actual review of the recipe.  It is to tell you what not to do.  I did not want to coat and fry the chicken, so I used this as a marinade and grilled the chicken.  The flavor of the marinade is not quite right for this.  It is a very strong orange flavor.  If breaded and fried I can imagine it quite good.  It was ok but not great.  Just fyi - if you're going to marinade chicken in this, bread and fry it.

This was top notch.  Marinading the chicken prior helps bring that flavor to the dish.  The sauce thickened up nicely.  This barely served 3 of us so maybe double up the recipe for the family.

I'm not a big fan of Chinese food because it's so unhealthy, in my opinion, but my boyfriend loves it so in an attempt to please, I tried this recipe. I followed the recipe, line for line and he LOVED it. The next time I make this, I will pan fry the chicken longer and on a higher heat in order to get crunchier edges.  I served this with the "japanese zucchini and onions" recipe from this site.

I gave this 4 stars because that's how the family rated it.  Sorry to say I would've only given it a 3.  I didn't care for the way the sauce turned out. I followed recipe with exception of 3/4 c brown sugar.  If I were to make it again, I would use less sugar, cornstarch, less lemon juice and more orange juice. I think it was just too sweet for me. I will make it again though because everyone else really enjoyed it. Thanks Harry

This was really good, I didn't put any breading on the chicken to avoid extra cholesterol, and didn't use quite as much sugar/orange zest, and it turned out awesome, although my wife thought it was a bit on the sweet side. Anyway, good recipe!

Delicious! I tried the recipe as written the first time, and it was very tasty. The second time I was in a hurry and opted not to marinade the chicken in the orange sauce, and while the rice cooked, I simply sauteed the chicken, added a couple of cups of broccoli to the pan, let that cook for a few minutes, then served chicken and broccoli over rice, drizzling the sauce on afterwards. This way, you can always add more if it needs it. I highly recommend this!

What a wonderful recipe! I'm so proud to make this for my husband, who absolutely loved it. I've been cooking for some time, and my repertoire is quite diverse, but this recipe is vastly different from everything else I make. I tried my best to follow the recipe, except that I didn't have any lemon so I just added more orange juice. More specifically, I used the juice and zest of one medium orange. I also used coconut palm sugar instead of brown sugar because we don't use any other sweeteners in our home. I used 3/4 cup instead of one cup and I think it was still a little too sweet for my taste. However, my husband thought it was perfect. Next time I'll try a heaping 1/2 cup instead. Instead of flour, I used all cornstarch for the breading along with some salt, pepper and garlic powder.

I sauteed some carrots, green onions, mushrooms, red and green bell peppers, and asparagus on the side. Instead of adding the cooked chicken to the sauce,I added the veggies, chicken and sauce on top of cooked rice. I did this per the suggestions of other reviewers and it was wonderful this way. 

Thank you so much for this beautiful recipe. I will serve it the next time I have dinner guests! And even sooner for my sweet husband!

Wow!!!! This definitely has restaurant quality! Very good! However, I totally by pass the frying chicken part. Just too much work; so, I buy frozen chicken bites, bake them, and, then, coat them with the sauce.

Very good!  I used fresh squeezed oj instead of water in the sauce, omitted the pepper flakes and used dried ginger.  We prepare a lot of Chinese entrees, and this is among the best!  Thanks!

It was delicious, people were going back for seconds and there was NOTHING left! I did make a  change after reading a few reviews; instead of using a cup and a half of water I substituted 1/2 cup water for juice, added 1 cup chopped blanched carrots and completely omitted the breading process, instead I browned the meat alone.

I've used this recipe as a base several times and friends and family come over specifically for it when I'm making it. This is 5 stars with some alterations. It's supposed to be orange chicken, not lemon -that's another recipe. So, no lemon juice. I used orange juice in its stead. If the sauce ends up to thick, or you need more, you can add some juice from a container. I have also used ground ginger and garlic when I was out of fresh. It comes out just as good. I also omitted the green onion and added a bit more brown sugar. I've also made it with and without the peppers. It wasn't to hot with them. With the chicken I tossed it in the flour mixture, then some eggs with milk, then back in the flour mixture. It gave it a much nicer coating. I do this every time. I've tried adding the bread crumbs that other recipes call for and we didn't like it. It was like adding cornmeal...to gritty. With the flour mixture I added ground garlic and onion to it, something I always do. Then fried it in a couple inches of oil, in batches, keeping what was done warm in the oven. SO, as I said, with these changes it was great. Without the additions to the flour, it is bland. It is a must try recipe. I'm sure you could switch it to lemon or lime chicken, instead of orange, quite easily.

I don't know what I did wrong. I followed everything exactly as written. I made sure the chicken was sufficiently cooled. A cup of sauce seemed like a little too much liquid to put in the bag. When I added the flour mixture it just went pasty. When I fried the chicken in the wok it was really clumpy and the coating came off and gooped together...Does anyone have any ideas how to rectify or improve this? I thought the taste was pretty good but I can't help but feel like I wasted 2 premium cuts of chicken breast.

This Orange Chicken recipe has been the best we have tried so far, and it is a keeper.  It is easy to adjust the flavors to your preferences, without compromising the final product.  Note, my marinade was boiling by the time I had the cornstarch mixture put together so it clumped up.  I whisked it out, but next time, I will make that ahead of time.

delicious! I did use a little less brown sugar (3/4 cup) and used flour instead of cornstarch for thickening -- and I let it simmer away for a while because it was still too watery for my tastes. I just wish I had made a double batch, since my currently picky kids even ate the leftovers. will definitely be making this again!

I have tried this recipe.  More lemony than orange.  For orange chicken, add more orange juice and eliminate lemon juice.  Do not need all the coating and cornstarch.  Next time I will try orange chicken stir fry.

My family gobbled this up!  Followed the recipe accept I used cornstarch instead of flour to coat the chicken.  For veggies, I added broccoli and red peppers.  My girls love restaurant orange chicken, but I have not had any success in duplicating it at home.  But this recipe is a keeper!

A little too strong on the orange flavor for me. Plus for some reason, the breading fell off the chicken when I added it to the sauce, making a thick, goopy sauce.

I made this for my family and got raves. I didn't have any green onions so I left onion out and I cut back a little bit on the red pepper flakes. It was so good. I made a mistake and used 1 1/2 cups orange juice so I added about 1 cup of water and cooked it down some. Really good. I also, cut the oil down as we eat very low fat. Loved the suggestion to keep the chicken warm in the oven and use 1/2 corn starch for coating. I served it with brown rice and it was perfect. I didn't have any left overs even though I used 4 chicken breasts. 
I will definitely be making this again.

This is a nice recipe for making orange chicken at home.  I would recommend reducing the amount of cornstarch, even at half the recipe called for it was quite thick.  Also I used about half the recommended red pepper flakes and it was still a bit too hot for the kids.  I actually used leftover chicken instead of cooking raw and it worked out well.  I will make this again.

The coating is tricky.  If you don't feel like dealing with the flour give it a try without.  
Flavor is very good.  Orange flavor was not overpowering.

It was delicious!!! Only modifications: I would use about 2 tablespoons of water per tablespoon of cornstarch, so that the sauce is not as thick or use only 1 tablespoon of cornstarch instead of 3. Also, deep fry the chicken.

I'vev made this recipe several times and always add fresh veggies which adds "healthy" to "scrumptious" and turns an entree into a one dish dinner. Just before cooking the chicken I stir fry bite-sized pieces of broccoli, 1" slices of green onions, chunks of red peppers, sliced carrots, snow peas, and quartered mushrooms in a blend of olive  and sesame oils. Then cook chicken as directed, and add veggies to the sauce when you stir in the chicken. Another tasty substitution is pineapple juice for the water when making the sauce.

I did not have rice wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar.  I juiced oranges, so I added a little extra juice since it was not as strong as store-bought. Reduced cornstarch to 2 tsp. and dissolve in 1 Tbsp. orange juice before wisking into boiling sauce.  Didn't have green onion, so I used yellow onion, and I used ground ginger instead of fresh.  I  threw in some broccoli, and next time I will make more sauce and add even more veggies. Turned out delicious!

Family of picky eaters.  They don't normally like chinese type food.  They loved this!  We are definitely keeping it.

This was a delicious recipe except that the vinegar was way too much. I am going to modify the vinegar to 2-3 tablespoons and see how that tastes. With less vinegar this would be a 5 star recipe

one of the worst dishes ever to come out of my kitchen. the sauce had a raw ginger and garlic taste and it was sweet like a jam. the orange zest added to the taste of disaster. it was acidic and bothering to the taste buds. although i put half the vinegar and more lemon juice, it smelled so bad and it was yucky! the idea with coating the chicken this was is for sure not a winner. all the coating comes off while frying and the rest comes off in the sauce looking very unappealing. chicken was soggy and lacking all touches of a chinese dish. we went to eat out.

I wish I'd read the other tips before I made it because mine was a mushy mess. Something went wrong in the frying; it didn't turn golden, then I added the sauce and that's when it became all mushy. But the flavor was wonderful.

My husband loves orange chicken, and loves this meal.  I usually use ground ginger, don't pack the brown sugar and have used apple cider vinegar (when out of rice vinegar) and it turns out just as good!  The sauce tastes great with some steamed veggies, too.

Amazing!!! I did saute a sweet onion, carrots and broccoli and added them when I added the chicken into the sauce at the very end. I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and that seemed just right for our taste. I also followed the suggestion on previous posts and instead of adding just water I added 1/2 pineapple juice and 1/2 water. I served with brown rice. I will say, the next time I make this it will probably be a weekend dish as it was pretty labor intensive at the end of a work day. The family loved it and so did I. Much better than the local take out place. A keeper!!!

The sauce was excellent - a great combination of spice and citrus.  Everything worked for me except the breading.  This was probably "user error" as I rarely bread anything with flour; I gave up and just browned the chicken with the seasonings but without the flour.  I also stir fried vegetables and added them to the finished dish, served over brown rice.  This dish was a big hit with my family.

I used twice as much red pepper flakes for the sauce because I wanted something with a little sweet heat.  I didn't pack the brown sugar and will probably use even less next time.  I did a breading but used flour, egg wash and flour again, I didn't have any problems with it not sticking.  I also didn't add the chicken to the sauce but rather poured the sauce over top when serving.  This was a hit with everyone including two picky little boys so it will for sure be going into my recipe book!

I confess I tinkered a little with this originally - less lemon juice and more orange, but it was way too sweet the first time.  I will be trying it again for sure, but will cut the sugar by at least half, possibly more.

I typically just use this recipe for the sauce - which I love! Following the recipe as is very good, but I also love tinkering with it. I usually just use orange juice concentrate (for more orange flavor), less brown sugar, and more red pepper flakes. I also like to stir fry veggies and add them to the mixture. I've fried the chicken before and that works well, but for a slightly healthier version, I just pan fry bite size chicken pieces in a little bit of oil (no breading). Still so delicious! 

I've also tried this recipe in the slow cooker - didn't work that well but I plan to try again.

SOOOO good!!! I made have made this several times for my family and they love it! This recipe is as close to Panda Express Orange chicken as you can get. I put garlic chili flake paste in it instead of plain chili flakes. Wonderful recipe!

My family thought this was just a little "Orangey" so I'll cut back on the orange zest next time.  Otherwise we loved it.  I followed Jeanette's comments/suggestions and that helped a lot.  I also agree with another reviewer that found this recipe to be a lot of work for a weeknight but one a cold weekend this would be great!

This sauce is sooo good! The recipe is a bit time-consuming for me on a weeknight, so I would make this again when I wasn't rushed for time. I've also made just the sauce and coated chicken stir-fry with it. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

My husband's favorite, I make it every year on his birthday. I also made it for a dinner party, however, it was a lot of work for a dinner party. One time I added extra orange, and it was just too much. I follow the recipe verbatim.

July 2011 - Very good. I added a bit too much lemon juice but still excellent. Served over brown rice. Did not coat chicken with flour and fry. Just marinated, baked and then added to reserved sauce.

My picky daughter loves the orange chicken at the certain mall restaurant - and she loves this, too!

changes:  I do not put the chicken pieces in the sauce at the end - I like to keep them crisp.

You can add all sorts of veggies - or pineapple.

followed the recipe except i substituted the rice vinegar with apple cider vinegar+some sugar since i didn't have any and lessened the brown sugar to about 1/2 a cup and it was a hit! i did strain the sauce after boiling it to lessen the kick of the red pepper flakes since i wanted my kids to eat it and i did have some sauce left over at the very end--but i'm not complaining since i can save it for other dishes. the only reason i gave it only 4stars is because it was time consuming in my case--if you had the time then this is perfect. in my opinion, marination is key.

I made this for my family and absolutely loved it! It tasted authentic and was pretty easy to do. If you don't have time to marinade, which I didn't, it still tastes wonderful! It works as a main dish, but I thought it would also make a great appitizer if you put it in a decorative bowl with skewers or tooth picks

This is by far the best orange chicken I have ever had! I didn't plan far ahead so I only marinated the chicken for 30-40 minutes, and I could actually taste it.

Modifications: I used a tablespoon of corn starch, the sauce seemed almost perfect. Got a jelly consistency in the fridge, might try a little less next time. I also added a bit of sesame oil.

Problems:  The breading kept coming off in the pan while browning.  I had to add more oil to the pan too, probably because I browned it in three batches.

I made the sauce exactly as directed and LOVED it! I decided to change up the chicken by using the beer batter recipe from the Fish Tacos By: BREESE823 (on this site) and then poured the sauce over the chicken and some instant white rice, results were out of this world! Finally I can make chinese food at home! Going to try this again with some stir fry veggies mixed in! Thank you Harry Wetzel for an excellent orange sauce recipe! Love the way the flavors come together!

this turned out to be a soggy mess. the sauce was good but marinating the chicken then dipping it in flour just made it soggy.

My teenager wasn't too fond, but the husband and I like this.  The sauce is very tasty.  I cubed frozen chicken breasts and let it thaw in the sauce in fridge for 2 days.  I doubled the chicken and tried the flour/cornstarch idea. It was good, but gummed up a bit after the sauce was added.  If I make it again, I am not going to use any breading, just stir fry it.

Wow, this recipe was great! To save time, I added the sauce while it was hot to the chicken and let it marinate for only 15 minutes. I grated a large orange to use as "orange zest" and juiced the orange in substitute for OJ, it gave it a much more natural flavor! Amazing! I took out the rice vinegar and simply doubled the amount of orange and lemon juice and added a tbsp. of molasses. Also 1/2 a cup or 3/4 a cup of brown sugar is more than enough! You want to have a taste of sweet but not overwhelmed with sugar. I served it with stir fry veggies over brown rice. This one's a keeper!

We thought this was really good, and not terribly difficult to make.  I didn't plan ahead to marinate the chicken, so I just let it set for a little while and then cooked the chicken in the marinade, drained the liquid off, then added the chicken back in with some veggies (I cooked them just a little before throwing the chicken in) and the rest of the sauce.  I used snow peas, broccoli, red pepper, and onion and it was delicious served over some steamed white rice!  I did double the sauce, but I don't know that we really needed quite that much - maybe 1 1/2 it?

I was looking for an orange chicken recipe that didn't require eggs because both of my two-year-old twins are allergic to eggs.  This one was a huge hit at our dinner table!  The kids just loved it and kept eating and eating, which made me really happy.  I will be making this regularly.  Thanks for posting it!

Very yummy recipe. I enjoyed the texture and flavors so much. The only changes I made was I only marinated the meat for 30 minutes, and I cooked the chicken in sesame oil instead of olive oil. My guests loved it and there were no leftovers.

YUUMMMM! I made this for a small gathering last evening and it was a hit!  I rated this 5 stars for the sheer taste of it all.  I was a bit put off by the fact the sauce was not nearly enough for the chicken (maybe it's because I hadn't used it to pour over the chicken as others suggested, idk.) I did not have ginger root on hand therefore I used ground ginger.  The sauce is a bit "stinky" while cooking it DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU.  It comes together wonderfully!  My only advice is to Double the sauce.

Excellent flavor.  I fry the chicken without the coating as I find it makes the sauce mushy.  Definitely a keeper!

A KEEPER-I saw this in my daily email from ALLRECIPES and decided I had to try it.  Amazingly I had all the ingredients, so I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I didn't do was marinate the chicken ahead of time because I failed to read the recipe in detail.  It still turned out great!!!!  My family (four girls and hubby) all ate it and asked for more.  That doesn't happen too often.  So thank you for a fabulous recipe.  Next time I might cut back a little on the sugar, but not because I thought it tasted too sweet, just to save some calories.

This was great. The only thing that I changed was substituting pineapple juice for half of the water, as other people had suggested. My daughter loves orange chicken and thought that this was better than take out.

So YUMMY! I live on a small island off the coast of Washington State, and we have no asian food resturants available here. I missed orange chicken the most and this recipe is outstanding! My whole family asks for this dinner once a week.

Great recipe. Was a bit on the sweet side but then again I didn't add the red pepper flakes since the kids were eating it. I did add some Sriracha hot sauce to my own to help balance the sweet and it was great! I also picked up some vegetable fried rice at our local Chinese restaurant to go on the side. Saved time and went perfectly.

Made this as stated (but used canola/sesame oil combination to fry) The taste is amazing.  I let the chicken marinate overnight and it was incredibly tender... the only downside was that as soon as i tossed the chicken in the sauce, the breading came apart... really really good!

I followed a previous tip and coated the chicken with egg before tossing it with flour.  I also marinated the chicken overnight so that it didn't take so long to prepare the meal in one evening.  It came out amazing.

My boyfriend is a very picky eater, I made this for him and he loved it! the sauce is perfect, i love that you can change bits of it to fit your tastes. you can also bread the chicken with bread crumbs or corn mix to give the chicken a crunchier texture.

can't wait to try making this - my mouth is watering. was using a bottled sauce, but.....  love all the great tips. just couldn't wait to add my own:  1) try with shrimp or a mixture of shrimp & chicken for those non-chicken lovers or as a special treat.  2) serve with cashew pieces as a condiment. don't mix in nuts or they will be "soggy."

Very good recipe.  I used flour instead of cornstarch.I will leave out the orange zest next time b/c we are not a huge fan of so much orange taste.  It is a bit time consuming to prepare but so worth having something different for dinner. I think the breading of the chicken could be optional and I think broccoli and carrots would be a good adder.

I tried this recipe today and it was terrific.I made the sesame chicken also and served them on a bed of Basmati rice. Delicious! I think the next time I will add a tad less vinegar depending how I feel that day.

very strong citrus flavor. sauce was sweet and would have been extremely thick if i had added all the cornstarch mixture.

The sauce was amazing. ALL three of my girls loved it, my husband loved it, it was a meal that we all gobbled up. I forgot to add the red pepper flakes, and I just made homemade chicken nuggets (deep fried chicken breasts coated in egg and dipped in flour and a pinch of salt) and combined after they were all cooked. Will totally make again. It was a favorite. Adding it to our monthly rotation.

VERY VERY GOOD!! I only wish I had a deep fryer. The chicken wasn't crispy enough and when it sat in the sauce it soon became soggy but we LOVED it anyway.

This was a great orange chicken recipe! The only problem I had is that you should whisk the cornstarch/water mixture in slowly, or it will clump up.  I also had tons of the orange sauce left.

Very nice!  I did have to tweak the ratios of sweet and sour to come up with a flavor that suited my family's tastes, but it's very good and now I feel more confident about cooking in when we want Chinese!

I had been looking for the best Orange Chicken for years and HERE I am!  The Most delicious recipe ever!  But I prefer not to add an orange zest.  But it was still great!  I would make this again.

This is a GREAT recipe....the only change I made to it was using less sugar than reccomended.....so about 1/2 the amount that is noted in the original recipe. But it's my favorite to make when we're in the mood for asian cuisine!

Delicious! I followed the recipe and found it was just a tad too orangy for us. Like others have mentioned, I will cut down on the zest slightly. Other than that, it was gooey and delicious!

This was excellent!  I coated the chicken with sesame seeds instead of flour before cooking, which gave it a bit of crunch.  I also used sesame instead of olive oil.  Delicious!

One of the best Asian dishes I've made. I've wowed my family, my friends, and my girlfriend with this dish. I usually serve it with jasmine rice cooked in coconut milk and top both the chicken and the rice with unsweetened, shredded coconut.

I'm sooo picky on what chinese food tastes like. I editted the original recipe because I couldn't afford the fancy ingredients - no sesame oil or rice vinegar, you can marinade for 30 mins, not 2 hours. I also used powdered onion and garlic, and flour instead of cornstarch, but 2 tbsp. And veggie oil instead of olive.

Pretty good. I followed others advice on not putting the chicken back in the sauce, poured over top. Good flavor. Ton of sauce, added carrots and there was still too much sauce. I didn't have an orange so I used a little marmalade and less brown sugar. Next time I make it I won't fry chicken.

I didn't have any fresh ginger so I used ground powdered and I added a dash of sesame seed oil.  I skipped the marinade for the chicken and dunked it in egg then bread crumbs and fried it up.  I added veggies onions, broccoli, carrots, green pepper and sugar pea pods.  Excellent meal definitely a keeper.

Awesome!! I was craving Chinese, but didnt want to order in or go out...I wanted Chinese and I wanted to make it. So, I started searching and found this recipe. It was super easy and oh so delicious!!  The only way I changed it, was that I didnt coat the chicken, nor did I use rice vinegar. I didnt have any and really have no idea what it is, so I didnt add it. It was so so yummy! Definitely recommend!!

Very good. tasted very very close to regular chinese food. The only thing wrong with it was it had a very strong, tangy orange taste. Very good and will most likely make it again.

So good.  I didn't bread the chicken just to make it a little healthier, so I used grilled chicken, cut up.  It turned out really delicious and my kids loved it.

This was an awesome recipe.  I followed it exactly, and made fried rice to go with it.  My husband, who has never had orange chicken before said it was really good not only once, but twice while eating it.  This recipe is a keeper.

I was so excited about making this dish for my boyfriend, and although I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee, this dish really let us both down. The orange flavor was strong and overpowered all of the other flavors. The dish didn't make the amount of sugar in it even worth it. I kept other reviews in mind when I chose to use less cornstarch and did not put the chicken back into the sauce. I guess neither of us are big orange chicken fans, so we won't be making this again.

Wow, this is awesome!  We are trying to cut down on fat/calories, so I just cut my chicken into chunks and browned it in a litlle bit of chicken broth.  I also used a brown sugar substitute and a little bit of sugar free maple syrup to sweeten.  I didn't have rice vinegar, so left it out.  I then poured the sauce over the unbreaded chicken and added a bag of frozen asian veggies with rice (60 calories - 0 fat).  Hopefully, that cut the calories and fat, but believe me, it didn't cut the taste.  It was amazing.

I thought this was excellently orange-y, but a little (a lot) too sweet. Next time I'm going to use just a 1/4 of sugar and see how it goes. Also, I only used a dabble of the sauce to marinate my chicken, which was delicious and left more of the sauce to saute the loads of broccoli I used.

Added sauce to chicken at the end all at once, had flour clumps, but soooo flavorful!  What's the flour for?  Next time try without.  WORTH the chicken breasts :)

WOW! I have tried several different recipes on here for similar dishes and didn't like any of them. This one is so good, it really is just like at a Chinese restaurant. I will be adding some peppers next time and maybe a few veggies, just to make it more of a full meal. It is fantastic!

My Whole Family Loved This!! Even The Little Nephews.   I Changed The Recipe Up A Little Bit And Added Some Siracha In It, Added Grapefruit Juice To It (As Well As The Lemon Juice, Replaced The Water With Freshly Squeezed OJ, Added A Lot More Pepper To The Flour Coating And Then Fried The Chicken In Peanut Oil (Also Frying The Chicken A Second Time To Get More Crispy), And Then Spooned The Heated Sauce Over The Chicken.  Added Some Brown Rice And Broccoli With Garlic As Side Plates (Frozen Broc Works Great Especially After All The Prep)  Would Make Again!!

This is excellent! I modified the chicken part by using and egg wash ( I added 3 tablespoons of teriyaki marinate to the egg wash) then added some paprika and cheyanne pepper to the flour. I also cooked it in my fry daddy!! excellent!! I also was missing some ingredience for the sauce. I subed ground ginger for the fresh and I used white sugar in place of the brown sugar. It was still really great. Happy eating!!

Can't give it five stars because it takes too long and is too messy.  My husband would give it TEN! I'll have to try and figure out how to cut some of the time and stickiness as I know I'll be making it again.

Excellent flavor!  I took others advice and kept them warm in the oven so the breading didn't fall off.  There was plenty of sauce for the veggies I added (red pepper and snow peas).  Will definitely make this again!

This didn't turn out that great for me. This was most likely due to user error and lack of time. Definitely not comparable to Chinese take-out.

Delicious! I left out the green onions and only used 1.5 Tablespoons of corn starch. I mixed the corn starch into about 1/2 cup of water and poured that into the reheated sauce mixture. It was the perfect consistency. We also used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2 so we could have leftovers, and we still had plenty of extra sauce. This recipe is really wonderful, I wouldn't change anything else about it. My husband ate every last bite and said it was better than Orange Chicken from a restaurant!

I love the orange sauce in this recipe.  (I used orange juice concentrate and omitted the green onion because my husband doesn't like it.)  The breaded chicken was okay, but I think next time I make this I'll try baking it instead.  Several reviewers mentioned that this recipe called for too much cornstarch, but I don't agree.  I tried reducing the cornstarch and I thought the sauce was too runny.

I'm so sorry, but we did not care for this.  I cook a lot and followed this recipe exactly but it had a bizarre flavor.  My mother-in-law had some and liked it but my husband and I could hardly finish ours.  I may have done something wrong, but I know I wouldn't make this again.

Definitely the most awesome asian dish I've made at home. The sauce tastes like a restaurant's would.  I did reduce the cornstarch a bit, and used 3 chicken breasts (plenty of sauce left!) I also changed the cooking method based on reviews - in three batches, I browned the chicken nicely in very hot olive oil, then placed the chicken in a 220-degree oven while cooking the remaining batches. The chicken was perfectly done yet very juicy inside. I set the chicken pieces on jasmine rice and drizzled with the orange sauce. Sprinkled with sliced green onions and served with steamed edamame. WOW. This will be in my recipe book forever.

My husband loved the way the chicken was prepared for this dish.  Overall, we were very happy.  There were a few changes I would make next time.  I would add another clove of garlic and I would keep the sauce on the side.  It didn't need as much cornstarch either...the sauce got a bit too thick.  There was too much sauce (although yummy) and that was all we could taste.  I would also add some stir fried vegies.

I thought this was really good, and tangier than the "normal" orange chicken you would get at a traditional chinese restaurant.  Maybe the chicken breasts that I used were too big, but there wasn't much sauce once I added the chicken.  I might use less of the cornstarch/water mix.  Overall, it was very tasty, and I will probably use this again.

This was delicious.  I added green and red peppers and put it over rice to make it a complete meal.  I also doubled it.  Unfortunately, I doubled the cornstarch mix too, and it turned out a little gloppy.  Next time I'll be more light-handed with that.  But overall, yummy.

This turned out really good!  I ran out of time to marinaide the chicken so left that part out. Next time I will do that as the chicken lacked a little flavor.  Other than that and doubling the sauce I followed the recipe to a T. I was a little nervous about the amount of some of the ingredients but turned out great.  I think next time I will do different because none of the flour stuck to the chicken.  I think it would be better to thicken the sauce BEFORE you toss with the chicken that was it coats it instead of mixes with it.  My kids and hubby really liked this!  I will for sure make many many many more times!

This was delicious!!  I have to rate it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the difficulty making it.  Coating the marinated chicken with the flour mixture just turned into a big mess.  When I started cooking the chicken, the flour just clumped up and came off the chicken in the pan.  Once I thickened up the sauce with the corn starch it became much thicker and less noticeable that everything had come off.  The sauce is good, if not better than any 'authentic' orange chicken I've had before.  Will do this again but maybe with a whole or half chicken breast to cut down on the mess.

Really liked the recipe except the 3T cornstarch with the water I thought way too thick would like a little more juice. Served over rice.

I have never liked orange chicken until I made this recipe. I left out the orange zest because I find it to be too strong, but I followed everything else exactly. Everyone loved it. Thanks for posting :)

I didn't read the complete directions prior to making it.  So when it came to adding a cup of the liquid to the chicken, flour, salt and pepper and refridge for 2 hours....I totally skipped this part (didn't want to eat @ 9pm). My husband and 4 year really liked the dish.

This was so much easier than I expected.  And I expected it to be easy anyway.  I liked it to be a little more saucey than the way it is written so I just doubled the sauce.  My kids really enjoyed it, even my toddler.  I would highly reccomend it.

Made this last night and loved it.  I substituted Gluten Free Flour (Gluten Free Mama's Almond Blend).  Served it with Chinese mixed veggies and sticky rice.   Steamed the veggies in the microwave.  Mixed the chicken, veggies and sauce and served the rice on the side.  Everyone loved it.

I've been using this site for awhile now and haven't made a bad thing yet thanks to all the helpful reviews so I finally had to review one myself. I made this last night and it was sensational. I would prefer a thicker sauc, thus I will adjust when I make it again. Also, I suggest using panko breading to get a crunchier texture. I do reccomend not skipping the marinated of the chicken but if you're pressed for time it will work just fine without.

Very tasty dish! A little bit of work but totally worth it!  I wonder if it is really necessary to marinate chicken in the sauce for 2 hours though...the sauce itself is very flavorful!  I think just dipping the chicken in eggs and breading it would be fine enough and save you some time!

Very orange-y, not too sweet, though, which was great!  Followed the recipe to a T, and thought the coating was perfect.  I give this four stars if you eat it on the day it's made, 5 stars if you let it rest for one day in the fridge.

1st time I have made Asain food and it turned out fantastic!  The only suggestion I could give is 1 tbsp less corn starch.  My girlfriend was surprised it tasted like restaraunt quility Chinese.  Next on the list, Thai!  Anyone with a good Paneng curry?

This was an interesting recipe! I had fun making it, it wasn't as difficult as I thought it might be. (sometimes chinese recipes are)  I would make a few changes for my personal preference...like adding more orange peel. I added snap peas at the end, the mix was good!!

I would definitely make this again with a few changes to my taste. I thought the orange zest with too overpowering so I'll leave that out. Like another reviewer, I would just pour the sauce over the chicken. The breading kinda fell off the chicken and made the sauce really sticky and it was a glob. But it was still delicious!! Thanks for sharing!!

A++ this was a hit with hubby!  He couldn't believe how exceptional the taste was, he said it was better than going to the restaurant for!  I did double batter the chicken to keep it crispy, although it was work, the end result of compliments was worth it. THANKS

This was a great-tasting recipe! I'll definitely make it again. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the sauce came out WAY too thick for my taste. I think I'll switch the amount of corn starch and water next time.  By the time my husband came home and ate it it was a really thick gel - not even thin enough to pour over top.  I served this along side jasmine rice and steamed broccoli.  It's a good recipe!

Loved this recipe.  I'm always looking for asian type recipes and this was a hit!  Left out the orange zest since I didn't have any oranges and the red pepper flakes and it still came out delicious!  My husband said definitely a keeper!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I'm a HUGE fan of Panda Express's orange chicken, and this imitates those flavors precisely. I added about a half cup extra of brown sugar because I'm a fan of sweeter orange chicken (as opposed to the more vinegary, sour tastes you normally find in orange chicken sauce recipes.) I didn't even cook chicken to go along with it, I just bought frozen chicken nuggets and drizzled this on top. So delish. I recommend it 100%.

Tried this a few times, could not get it to come out well with the coating. Sauce was good though.

This recipe had a great orange flavor that we loved. I only gave it a 4 stars because the sauce was just too thick and chicken was not as crispy as we would have liked it. I followed the recipe with the exception of coating the chicken with flour and cornflakes. I did not cook the chicken in the sauce, instead I combined rice, slivered almonds, rice noodles, pea pods, green pepper (did not have any red pepper), broccoli, (steamed the green pepper, broccoli and pea pods first) chicken and some of the cooked sauce together and served the rest of the sauce on the side. The next time I will use a lot less corn starch and make the sauce soupier ( like Applebee's recipe). I may stir fry the veggies and chicken also. Otherwise very good. Great flavor!

So good.  We didn't marinate the chicken and it still turned out so yummy. I seriously have been craving this dish since we last made it.

This was good but SUPER sweet!  I am a huge fan of sweet Asian/Chinese food but this was a little much for us.  We had to add some more pepper flakes and a little cayenne to try and cut the sweetness.  For veggies I added some carrots and snow peas.

Oh my god- this was absolutely awesome! The flavor was perfect. I added a bit more orange zest then called for and followed others direction by heating the chicken in the oven after browning. I was not able to marinate for the full 2 hours, I only could marinate for about 45 min. I also had a little difficulty keeping the flour mixture on the chicken while browning- I will follow the advice of another by dipping chix in egg before flour to hopefully keep flour mix on. Will def. make again, served over rice & there were no leftovers! Kudos to Harry for posting this recipe!

This was delicious! I used duck instead of chicken, originally when looking through recipies I wanted something for duck and this adapted well. I also added a splash of lime juice and the zest from the lemon as well as the orange. After browning off the duck, I simmered this in my slow cooker as well as duck can be tough if not cooked right. Would definitley recommend this, all my freinds loved it, even the ones who were apprehensive as they hadn't had duck before.

While this had a few steps it was well worth it! My husband loves orange chicken but most recipes I have tried have been very bland. I added garlic salt and pepper into the flour as well as additional in the sauce.   I did the stir fry the chicken in batches and just covered it with a paper towel. This worked out very well. I then just boiled the sauce then turned it off and added in the chicken.   My family have already asked that I make this again.

Really good!  Only problem I had was getting the sauce to be thicker.  I took the advice of others and reduced the amount of cornstarch, but maybe I will add a bit more next time.  Light, healthier version of take out orange chicken!

This was a great meal to make. Very simple to put together. The only thing I didn't like was how sweet it was. Next time I make it, I'll use 1/2 the sugar.

I didn't have rice vinegar so I just used regular vinegar, did everything else the same, and marinated the chicken in the sauce overnight.  Very flavorful and healthy-tasting!  I did try to make the chicken pieces crispy by cooking them separately and then pouring the sauce over them just before serving.  The chicken was a little crispy, but not noticeably.  I'll probably cook it all together next time, and forego the crispiness.

Excellent! Restaurant quality! Did not marinate chicken, and it tasted great. Used 1/2 flour and 1/2 cornstarch - had a tough time getting a crunchy consistency, but the chicken was tender and perfect. I also cut the water in half, and added additional liquid when needed after thickening with the cornstarch slurry.

This was fab, even though I didn't sure the ginger root, the rice vinegar, or green onion.  I did squeeze some fresh orange juice with pulp into it, and it was very, very good with that addition.

Great recipe.  Make the sacue and marinate the chicken the day before for quicker prep.  Stir-fry some broccoli and remove from pan before cooking chicken.  Cook chicken in batches for more browning.  May need to add more brown sugar or even a drizzle of honey to the sauce.

As I was preparing this, I was skeptical, but it actually turned out nice. Next time, I'll cut down on the lemon juice and add a bit more sugar since I'd like to bring out a bit more of the sweet flavor. My breading fell apart when I mixed the chicken into the sauce unfortunately. The chicken even tasted good before rolling it in the sauce!

I don't often make sauces, but this one turned out well for me and my husband thought the flavor was similar to Applebee's orange chicken.   He wished the breading had more substance, but I thought it was good.  Make sure to mince the ginger very small-- I bit into a piece that was a bit too big and wow was that a strong flavor! ;)

This was good but not as good as I had expected given all the great reviews. I made exactly as the recipe was given except I didn't marinate the chicken because I didn't have time. Also I didn't have oj on hand but had some oranges so I made my own. Thinking this would make it better with freshly squeezed oj. I also took other reviewers suggestion & poured the sauce over the chicken when it was done instead of letting the chicken soak in the sauce. I thought it would help keep it crispy if it got poured over the sauce, but honestly the chicken could have used a soaking in the sauce cause it wasn't that much more crispy having the sauce poured over it. Also I should have marinated it, maybe the chicken would have soaked up more flavor. Also I think I would cut down on the lemon juice because it overpowered the orange flavor I was looking for. Not bad, but not quite what I was hoping for. I will have to make some adjustments next time I make it!

Whoa Nelly!  This stuff is good.  If you want to actually know what's in your Chinese food - go with this recipe.  I'm tired of all the MSG and other additives in fast food.  I rated it 4 stars due to the amount of flour for the chicken.  It's not needed.  A slight dusting or none at all would be best.  However, this is by far the best thing to Chinese takeout.  I prefer it over our local restaurant.

this was amazing! i used pineapple juice instead of water and canned ginger instead of fresh. turned out great! make sure to add the cornstarch a little at a time, i had clumps because of adding too much at once. I will double the sauce next time!

This was better than the mall! I stuck to the recipe except I only had 1/2c brown sugar so I added honey. As others suggested, I added the sauce on top of the fully cooked chicken at plating which kept it nice and crispy. I dissolved about 2 tbs+ of cornstarch in 2 tbs more orange juice.

Good, but a little too citrusy for me too.  Definitely reduce cornstarch and cook the chicken separately and just pour the prepared sauce after it's thickened.

Very nice.  Next time I'll a some veggies like others suggested.  I'll probably increase the peppers and top with sesame seeds.

Made a lot of changes, but that's just my way.  To summarize everyone else: don't combine sauce and chicken till the end, cook vegetables separately if wanted (I would), try adding sesame oil (but not more than 1/4 tsp because it's strong), marinading is unnecessary.  Also the amount of lemon juice seemed a little much, so I added about half the amount and it was still too much for my taste.  Besides all that, the sauce was tasty and indicative of the cheap carryout.  Of course it's not going to taste exactly like it because many of those smaller joints deep fry their chicken and use a premade sauce they order from the "Asian Foods" company (which is why it all tastes similar) unless it's a more upscale place.

Yummy!  I think I can skip the marinating time next time I make this to save up on time.  The sauce is flavorful enough for the chicken! :)

We bought some Panda Express Sweet n Sour sauce, so I used this recipe to make orange chicken.  Came out great!  Family really enjoyed it!

Wowzers!! This is soo yummy!  I also added 2 tsp cornstarch with 1 tbls water, and don't heat the chicken in the sauce...! It's best to keep the chicken heated and then add the sauce to coat nicely! You will not be disappointed!

I liked the light breading of this orange chicken but did not particularily like the orange sauce.  The taste was good but I did not think it was as thick or sweet as it should be.  May try this recipe again but look into ways to thicken/sweeten the sauce.

Great flavor, but for some reason the breading did not work at all. We followed the suggestion of using egg before dipping chicken in the flour mix, and the end result was super super gooey. (I never seem to have much luck with breading anyway.) I rated it 5 stars for the great flavor, and since I think the problem was from our alteration. I plan to make this again, but without any alterations. I also accidentally doubled the orange peel and it wasn't noticable.

excellent taste! but next time I think I will skip the flouring part (unless I am pouring the sauce over it in the end instead of tossing, it doesn't make)sense to me to flour it if it will just end up soggy in the end

Ay-yay-yay! Real Orange Chicken and it's better than Panda Express. Did everything it called for except I did not deep fry the chicken. I just browned the chicken in pan and lots of ground black pepper til there's no more pink. The sauce is as is but I found to have the lemon mixed after it's done simmering for 15 mins. Oh and I used 2 med Oranges for the zest and it's juice. Great recipe! Keeper!

This is spot on.  Can't miss!  I often use two heaping spoonfuls of orange marmalade instead of the juice/zest.

I also used more OJ, the juice from half a large orange. I used 2 skinless chicken thighs cut into bite size pieces, breaded, sprayed with cooking spray, and baked at 400 until golden. Oh, and I didnt marinate the chicken, I like lots of sauce, so I used the called-for amt of cornstarch and kept all of sauce for serving. Added some frozen broccoli and served with brown rice. Terrific! Thanks!

Delicious! I will definitely make it again! The only changes that I made were (since I didn't have an orange) took out the orange zest and used 1/4 cup orange juice, and changed the cornstarch to 2 1/2 teaspoons. Excellent recipe!

Amazing Recipe!  I followed the instructions exactly but added double the red pepper flakes.  It tasted like take-out Chinese!  I followed some of the advice in the reviews: heating the chicken in the oven while the sauce cooks and adding the sauce last to prevent the breading on the chicken from coming off.  This will become a family favorite.

Great flavor! We prefer grilled chicken over fried, so we skipped the breading and frying. Then we steamed broccoli and added it with the chicken at the end. We also omitted the green onion (we aren't onion fans). It was fabulous! Our favorite recipe from this site. Thank you!

I thought this was a very good dish. I didn't use red pepper flakes because I didn't have any.Other than that I followed the recipe to the T. Next time I may alter a few things. I like to use the recipe exactly as is the first time because you never know what you might discover you like. Very good!!

Ridiculously good.  Tastes like gourmet Chinese food (it could have come from PF Changs!)  Make sure you shake of the extra flour, and then cook until the coating is crispy.  Not recommended for reheating.  I served it with white rice, and sugar snap peas with sesame seeds & olive oil.

YUM! I followed the recipe exactly... only I didn't have 2 hrs to let it marinate so I only marinated for 1 hr and it was still amazing! Added in some broccoli at the end and put it over white rice, everyone gobbled it up! I can't wait to make it again!

Pretty good, but would be better off putting the chicken in the fridge after flouring to hold the breading...

The sauce has a great flavor but I like my sauce a little thicker so I added 2 more tbsp. of cornstarch. I also tossed in 2 bags of frozen stir fry veggies. Plenty of sauce for 4 breasts and all those veggies. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe last night for my husband and me and all I can say is WOW!!! It was amazingly delicious. I didn't have rice vinegar on hand, so I substituted apple cider vinegar. I also subbed 1/2 C. water with pineapple juice. Served over brown rice with a side of broccoli. Oh my gosh!!

I made this for a bunch of our family with varying tastes and everyone loved it. I made some with chicken and some with tofu for our vegan family.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I make it very often- for myself and also due to numerous requests for that 'amazing orange chicken'.  I usually use about a tbs. more orange juice (squeezed from the oranges I got the zest from) and I put about 3 tbs. more brown sugar in the sauce after I remove some for the marination. It makes it a little less overbearing. If you're in a hurry you can skip the marination and it still turns out really good, but it is worth the wait to have the chicken get that great orange flavour. I highly recommend this recipe!

This was sooooo good, my husband couldn't get enough of it....I will play with the ratio of cornstarch to water.  Mine came out way too thick.....But still delicious....

This is by FAR the BEST recipe I have tried from this site!!! I wouldn't change a thing! (Granted, we did it the more fatty way by deep frying chicken in our fryer) We had company for dinner and this was just absolutely incredible! I can't wait to make it for my parents and parent in laws.

I was at the grocery store today and splurged on dinner from the deli.  I brought home orange chicken and rice but I was disappointed that there was no sauce.  I just needed a little bit of sauce for the two of us so I simmered smaller proportions of the ingredients and it was PERFECT with the store bought orange chicken.  I like Asian food but I've not had much luck in preparing it and I would NEVER have figured out how to make a sauce for orange chicken.  This was super simple and just wonderful.

We had mixed feelings about this dish in our househole. Husband liked it without me adding more to the recipe. I hated it with just the recipe. I think it wasn't orangey enough. Husband said too much orange. Since I'm the cook, I'll rate it 4 stars. After tasting the original recipe and being very disappointed, I added 1 T of honey and 1 T of orange marmalade. After the addition, I gave it 5 stars but husband gave it 3 stars.

Well.....we didn't care for this to much. The sauce consistancy was good, but not the right flavor. Looking for more orange flavor. I doubled the recipe but didn't double the brown sugar, it would of been way to much!!! I was hoping for something better, the search is on.

Loved this recipe except my breading came off the chicken when I added the orange sauce.  Next time, to cut calories, will probably just use unbreaded chicken breasts.  Loved the bit of bite in the sauce!  Also, added red pepper and sliced carrots when frying the chicken.

I followed recipe exactly and I did not like it at all.  It had an orange flavor but other than that I thought it was quite boring.  My guy LOVED it though - so I rate it a 3.  He would have rated it a 5.

This is amazing! I am in LOVE with this recipe it reminds me of a chinese place that served this years ago(it was my all time favorite) and this is just as great if not better!!! If you pay attention and do it right. The ONLY thing I did different was fry my chicken in my deep fryer and kept it warm in the oven until sauce was ready. Oh and only marinated my chicken about 30 mins. Needless to say hubby and I were fighting over the leftovers. Haven't had this dish in at least 15 yrs I am so happy I have found it. Thank you!

Loved it! I've made this twice so far- once with tofu and it picked up the flavor so well even my picky husband liked it.  The whole amount of red pepper is necessary to counter the tangy ness of the vinegar and juices.

I had a little Mother/Daugters Party and served this dish.  My daughters and I thought it was delicious.  We did have trouble with the coating coming off of the chicken though,and I did pour it over the chicken after it was cooked, as others suggested.  We have decided that next time we will buy the popcorn chicken and just make the sauce.

This was DELICIOUS!!!!  At first I was disappointed because it didn't look like the orange chicken from the Chinese restaurants but when we ate it, my family and I couldn't believe how yummy this recipe came out.  The only thing I cut out of the recipe was the soy sauce.  I made the first batch with it and it was to strong.  When I made a second batch, I eliminate the soy sauce and it was GREAT!!  Will definitely make this again!!!

I was excited to try this recipe out, and was slightly disappointed in it.  Some of my disappointment is for sure due to my lack of time and modifying the recipe, but I followed the sauce ingredients to a T and wasn't that thrilled with it.  My picky husband liked it just okay and encouraged me to shop around for another recipe.

Wow! I made this almost exactly as written with two small changes.  I used boneless-skinless thighs and I used powdered ginger instead of fresh.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic.  I served it with some sauteed vegetables (stir fry style using a bit of the marinade) and some steamed white rice.  I'll be making this again when I get that hankering for chinese chicken.

***** I would give this 10 stars if I could!!  It was absolutely the most delicious Orange Chicken I have ever had - - even better than my local Chinese restaurant.  Since I had an orange for the zest, I simply used the freshly squeezed juice from the orange for the sauce and it tasted so fresh and delicious.  Yes, the sauce is sweet, but that's what makes it Orange Chicken!   I served it with snow peas and bean sprouts - - a perfect meal.  Thank you so much, Harry.  This is an absolutely wonderful recipe!

Great sweet/sour recipe.  Adjust the orange to your liking.  My kids thought that it had too strong of an orange flavor, my husband and I thought it was perfect.  I served it with a wild rice mix and broccoli which seamed like a good combo.  This might be good with beef as well.

This sauce was DELICIOUS!  We cut the brown sugar in 1/2 and it was still plenty sweet.  Absolutely in our dinner rotation, albeit a bit time consuming.

Oh, the flavor! Really excellent layers of flavor. It was a big hit with my husband and a guest. I followed it to a T except that I took the advice of some others and only used two tsp of cornstarch mixed in water. I also didn't have enough rice vinegar so I used some white wine vinegar as well. Delicious!

biggest issue? too sweet. the chicken without the sauce was actually quite good alone. if i make this again, i think i'll just marinade the chicken, stir-fry in oil, and serve with rice and veggies.

I thought it was good but the family all said that the orange flavor in the sauce was too strong.  I followed others and cut brown sugar to half cup. If you like crispy chicken then don't add the sauce till the end. Also be sure to mix warm water with the corn starcge before adding to sauce and add gradually because it will turn into a thick gel if you add too much.  I added the chicken to brown rice and poured sauce over all.  If you like to sauce on your rice you may want to make a little extra.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't have time to marinate the chicken for 2 hours - didn't matter.  I tossed some sauce on it and let it sit for 15 minutes and it still came out flavorful and amazing.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it.

This recipe is amazing. I added orange juice concentrate instead of regular to give it a little extra zing. I added the crushed red peppers after I set the chicken to marinade and set some sauce aside for my kids who aren't crazy about spicy but love the orange sauce. I do agree to put the sauce on the chicken right before service to keep it crunchy.  Delicious and I will definitely be making this again.

Yummy! I added 1 cup of chicken broth to the sauce and reduced the cornstarch to 2 TBSP.  The consistency was perfect and we thought that it was better than take-out!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was very very good and quite easy, the only thing I did was cut the brown sugar in half and it was still sweet enough.  I also added vegetables (peppers, onions,carrots) .Cooking them first and removing them and then cooking the meat. I put them all back into the pan together and added the sauce and water cornstarch mixture.  It was a nice all in one pan meal. Another reviewer mentioned adding pineapple juice and removing some of the water, I think that would be a very nice touch as well.

This was great!! I served this for an  Asian Themed "Girls Night In" at my house and everyone loved it!!!  I even had some extra for my husband who said it taste just like the carry out!! I would have to agree the plus is you know it's chicken!! lol... I did take other's advice and deep fried the chicken pieces and it turned out really good.. I think next time I would have to almost triple the sauce recipe because it was soo good I wanted more!!

I used just the orange dressing over boneless chicken wings for an appetizer. I also added 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade. I baked the wings then coated with the sauce and served. This was a huge hit. Next time I am going to use the entire recipe.

This was really good. But I will make some changes next time. After marinating the chicken drain the marinade off then coat with flour. I failed to do this and there was chunks of flour in it. I might also substitute corn starch for flour. The flour did not stick to the chicken. Also I would reduce the amount of sugar to cut back on calories. Also it was a bit too sweet. But I will make it again.

I loved this recipe and so did my boyfriend! I tweaked some things though by adding a bit more brown sugar and red pepper flakes. Also, along with the orange zest I added in some orange slices cut thinly with the peel still on to cook down in the sauce and cooked some broccoli florets in the sauce as well and served it all with rice! My first time ever making orange chicken and I will definitely add this recipe to my list of favorties! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent!  There was not anything left.  We served it over Thai rice and had a side of green peppers, onion and carrots that we sauted in some of the extra marinade.  I will make again soon!!

I can't believe this gem has been in my recipe box for so long without me ever making it!  YUM.  All those nights of me craving orange chicken could have been solved without going to get takeout!  I revised this a little to make it a little healthier by using 3/4 cup of flour instead of 1 cup and 2 tablespoons of oil instead of 3- and it was plenty!  I definitely could have cut back on the sugar too, there is a LOT in there.  Delicious mixed with steamed broccoli!  Make sure you fry the chicken up until it's nice and crispy- yummy!

So, the first time I made this I could not rate it because I completely botched it. I have come to terms with the fact that I just can't bread anything. So, this time I skipped the flour step and just woked the marinated chicken. It rocked!! Will add to my recipe rotation!

Very good.  I felt that it was missing 'something' that would have made the sauce more delicious and complex, but I am not sure what it is.  I gave it a 4 because it is good, but not great..and the fact that it is so time consuming would make it less likely to be in the routine dinner rotation.

This was good.  I followed other reviewers' advice and poured on the sauce at the end.  If you think this is going to taste like Panda Express...it doesn't.  But it's still good.:)

This was the most delicious chicken dish I have ever eaten.  It is even better than the kind you get in the Chinese restaurant.  My family loved it and I will definitely make it again.  The only thing is that it's not for a weeknight dinner because it is time consuming but definitely great to make on the weekend for company.

Very good. I reduced the sugar a little, as it seemed like a ton, and it was still very sweet. The other flavors balanced out the sweetness well, though, and I would make it again. Make sure not to stir or flip the chicken too often or the flour coating will come off. I served this with rice and stir-fried broccoli.

This came out DELICIOUS!! We loved the orangy flavor (I personally liked it better than the local "Express" restaurant). I used two very large chicken breasts, so this was more like six servings. I added extra garlic and orange zest to the sauce, and instead of just coating in flour, I added a 1/4 c. of cornstarch to the coating mix. Also, I took one of the other suggestions and DID NOT simmer the chicken pieces in the sauce, I just poured it over the chicken after it had simmered for 5 min. We had this with frozen stir-fry veggies and rice. My 4-yr-old asked if I could make this every night!

I don't know if my lemons were too tangy or my oranges to orangy, but this was not terrible but wasn't good either. I followed the recipe to the letter but when my bf and I actually ate it, it was too tart-even with all the sugar. I know that this will be a good recipe with the proper adjustments of the juices. I will try again because the other than the extreme tartness I experienced the flavor was good.

Good.  My husband thought it was better than his favorite chinese takeout.I didn't use all the sauce - it would have been too much.  Next time I think I'd add some broccoli or other vegetable for nutrition and to soak up the extra sauce.

This was delicious! I only made a few changes. I doubled the amount of orange juice because I thought it needed more orange flavor. I didn't have brown sugar on hand so I used regular white sugar and that seemed to work out fine. The sauce was a little bit thick for my liking, but other than that, it tasted great. My picky 4 year old loved it. And he usually hates anything with sauce!

It was really good!  There were 2 things I really didn't like about it however.  The first was it had a somewhat sour aftertaste.  I think next time I will use half as much rice vinegar.  I also thought there was too much sauce, but I do not think that I will change the recipe for the sauce.  As others suggested, I used less corn starch.

I wanted to make a healthier version of restaurant-style orange chicken, and this was perfect. I did fry the chicken, then added it to the thickened sauce. However the coating was still very light, not at all deep fried tasting or thick & heavy like fast-food orange chicken. The only other thing I did differently was to use only about a teaspoon of orange zest, however I'm glad I did because it still had a really orange-y taste.

Very good. The entire family enjoyed this, even my husband who usually complains if I make something with Asian flair. I used canola oil to fry the chicken and cut down on the cornstarch a bit. Do not skip marinating the chicken.

Pretty good recipe. I use OJ instead of water, and stir with cornstarch in a mug or small cup before adding to the sauce.

FANTASTIC! I added some stir fry veggies and used brown rice. Tossed the chicken with whole wheat flour, and used canola oil. I didn't make any changes to the orange sauce though, it was so good. I saved a small portion for lunch the next day, and it was even better than the night before. It will be in my rotation!

This dish was super yummy! My breading did not stay on very well, but it didn't matter, it was still super yummy. The only changes I made (as suggested by others) were to use some sesame oil in addition to the olive oil and to only use 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to 1 tablespoon water. And I used ground ginger because I could not find fresh ginger root in the store. 
This one's a keeper!

Delicious recipe!  First time I made orange chicken and it was fab.  It definitely helps to marinate the chicken.  It was sooo moist.  I didn't have vinegar, cornstarch or 100% orange juice and instead used a dash of lemon juice, flour as the thickening agent and orange/pineapple juice.  I also put a few drops of sweet chili sauce.  I reduced the brown sugar a bit. You will need a lot more oil to fry the chicken though. I placed the fried chicken pieces on paper towels while continuing to fry the rest. I did not mix the sauce with the chicken, as I read in the reviews, it gets soggy.  Right before serving, I heated up the sauce and dipped each of the chicken pieces in the sauce.  I think topped it off with chopped green opinions.  Yes, it does take a little more time to do this, but the presentation was lovely and neat.  FYI, it DOES take time to make this recipe.  I had a lot of bowls/plates to clean up after, but it was worth it.  The orange chicken was YUMMY and was a huge hit.  I will definitely make this again!

Yum! Almost exactly like our favorite local Chinese joint. Very tasty, although found the cornstarch to water ratio a little glue-like and clumpy when added to the sauce. At any rate, very yummy, husband loved it - we'll definitely have this again!

I loved this orange chicken recipe. I decided to make this right when I got home from work and didn't have enough time for the chicken to marinate, and it still turned out great. I made it as is and didn't make any changes. Everyone loved it!

This is really good.  I made it for visiting family and they thought it was very tasty.  I omitted the pepper flakes, we don't like spicy orange, but otherwise I followed it exsactly.

Good but not great. Put a little sesame oil in with the olive oil. Flavor was there but needed a bit more - my fault as I didn't marinate long enough. Next time I will and it'll probably be a 4*.

This was an amazing recipe.  I didn't think I would ever be able to make orange chicken with what I already had in my kitchen but.. voila!  Instead of using orange zest I just added another tablespoon of orange juice and it had a good orange zing to it.  Relatively simple, great with fried rice and chow mein which I also made with it :)!

WOW. This was soo good. I would definetly reccomend it and will be making it again and again. I followed the recipe exactly. I left some of the chicken unbreaded and it still tasted GREAT; so I think that I will just skip that step next time. Oh ya, I also just kept the chicken on a baking sheet in the oven until the sauce was ready to pour over it. Thanks!!

chicken tasted great, make sure not to use too much oil while cooking so they can get crispy. I transferred to a cookie sheet and baked at 250 when done to keep warm and crispy.  Next time I will OMIT red pepper flakes all together.  We do not like spice/hot in orange chicken.

I thought this was okay, but not even remotely similar to the orange chicken from that "popular restaurant in the mall." I altered the recipe to use what I had on hand: apple cider vinegar instead of rice, powdered ginger and no green onions. I kept the chicken warm in the oven after pan-frying, but it still didn't stay crispy; if I were to make this again, I would omit the coating altogether. I dissolved 2 teaspoons cornstarch in 1 tbsp water and drizzled it into the sauce while stirring and it did not clump. We managed to finish the dish but "blah" is the word to describe it. But 4 stars to be fair, because I think it's just a matter of personal taste. Citrus in savory dishes just isn't for me...

This was wonderful.  My husband and I usually find recipes lacking in "kick", so I increased the peppper flakes and used concentrated frozen orange juice (undiluted).  The sauce was tasty and had a mildly spicy kick, which was just what we were looking for.  I threw some broccoli florets in while the dish was simmering.  Definitely a keeper.

This tasted very much like the orange chicken from the Chinese restuarant in the food court of our local mall.  It is very easy to prepare and the sauce thickens up beautifully once the cornstarch is added.  I personally thought there was a little too much sauce, but the rest of my family didn't!  I was very pleased with how this turned out.

We LOVED this!  I was searching for recipes that would use ingredients in my house, and came across this one.  My husband is a somewhat picky eater, and he absolutely loved it. I made it almost exactly according to the recipe (cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar was the only change).  This will be added to our regular rotation. It was fairly easy, economical, and delicious!

Wow! This was really good. I only made a few changes to the recipe I did 1 1/2 cups of orange juice, 1/2 cup of water, I increased the soy sauce to a 1/4 cup and add 2 tablespoon of Polaner all fruit orange marmalade. This was wonderful.

I was looking for a new recipe that called for ingredients that I had on hand, and I came across this one. Man, it was great. It was pretty close to dinner time so I could not marinate the full 2 hours, and I made a mistake with the ginger (I grated an inch into the marinade, which is about a tablespoon, something like 6x too much) but we really liked it. In fact I’m going to continue to use that amount of ginger. I was a little surprised that it called for olive oil for pan frying, since that’s not used in Asian cooking – I fried it in peanut oil. Next time I make it, I’m not going to bread it. I’d like to see how it comes out just stir fried (maybe with some broccoli) and the sauce thickened and poured over top, served with rice. My crew is game to try it.

I love this dish. It takes a bit for prep. but I just prep it in the morning and let it marinate all day and by the time I get home there's not much left to do but enjoy the taste. It rivals some of the best orange chicken I've ever had at any restaurant.

My first review - This is a great recipe. I read some people said that it is too "orangy" or sweet. It does have a strong zesty and sweet flavor, but my family and I really enjoyed it. You might want to tone down on the orange and/or sugar if that kind of flavor is not your thing. We followed the recipe pretty closely and I have to say I was very impressed with it.

Only ate it cause I was hungry. Spent over 3 hrs making this and it ended up tasting tooo sour. I had to eat it with huge shovels of rice to balance out the acidic taste. I followed everything but did not bread the chicken due to fat and I cut half the sugar cause people were saying it's too sweet. Even when I added sugar it still tastes really sour. Make sure your orange juice isn't sour and that if you reduce sugar also reduce the vinegar and lemon juice.

All i needed from this recipe is the sauce. It sounded yummy and ended up delicious! I didn't have orange juice or orange zest. I used a whole jar of marmalade instead. I also added 2 Tbsp Seasame seed oil. I browned the chicken with olive oil, added garlic and small baby carrots. Next i added the sauce and simmered for 1 hour. Then i added green onion, Sliced almonds and brocolli florets. Simmered for 20 mins and served over jasmine rice. Tasty!!! My family thanks you for the recipe!

This was not that great. I halved the sugar so sweetness was ok. It seemed too sour and vinegary and just something I would not want to make again.

This was pretty good, but a bit too orangy and a bit too much ginger. Probably won't do again.

I've made this twice and we liked it better when i didn't coat the chicken with flour.  I also tried cutting the brown sugar in half but we didn't like that as much.

I didn't like this recipe very much. Too vinegary and altho I marinated for 2 hours, the flavor was pretty weak.  Also, too much cornstarch.  The sauce was way too thick.  If I have to alter the recipe to make it right, I can't give it a high rating too.  Sorry.

The sauce is awesome, a bit sweet after a day or so of sitting.. but lowering the corstarch is the best thing to do.. not as think makes it better for reheating later.

Close to Asian fast food. I used raw sugar rather than brown, cut out the onions, poured the sauce over the finished chicken rather than cooking them together and sprinkled sesame seeds on top. Also used olive oil to pan fry. Yummy!

OMG!!! SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!! Everyone loved it!  Tastes like the restaurants.  Only things I changed: didnt use the onions & I had no lemons..all i had was 1/3 of the amount of the "fake" lime juice.  Tasted so good.  Cant wait to use real lemons next time.

Mmm this was very good.  I was nervous because I had never made an Asian dish before but this turned out great.  I used brown rice and added steamed broccoli.  The only thing that I changed is, instead of mixing the chicken into the sauce, we kept the sauce separate and poured it on as needed.  We will be making this again.

I prepared this as directed, but I didn't like this orange chicken as much as other Asian dishes I've prepared.  I thought the orange flavoring was a little overpowering.  It was also very sweet.

Have made this a few times now, with a couple of changes. I used the deep fryer for the chicken (despite it being horrible nutritionally), because the chicken has a much tastier, crispy breading. After the first time, I cut back the brown sugar to almost half, because the sauce was so sweet the first time we made it. Turned out great with less sugar, has been put on the dinner rotation.

Not nearly as good as Panda Express like someone had said.  In fact, it tasted nothing like it.  It wasnt bad, but i dont think i will be making it again.  If i want real orange chicken i think i will just order out.

We love orange chicken but I always assumed it would be a lot of work to make my own.  It definitely wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.  I cut the cornstarch in half like others said.  I doubled the orange zest thinking we would like it really orange-y, but it was too much.  Really good, and healthier than most restaurants.

This is very good, but I thought it was a bit sweet. I concur w/ the other ratings to leave the sauce on the side and poor it on as needed.  My husband loved it, so will definately be making again.

The orange sauce/marinade was very, very good!  The marinated chicken would have had an excellent flavor without the frying aspect which I do not recommend. (I used egg, half cornstarch, and half flour, warmed the chicken in the oven and served the sauce on the side based on previous reviews) I will use the sauce recipe again but will grill the chicken or use Tyson popcorn chicken on busy days per one of the other reviews.  Husband commented that it was really good but very similar to the Contessa frozen orange chicken we buy at Wal-mart (which is way easier)!

I would give this 4.5 stars. The sauce was very good, however, I thought it needed more soy sauce to balance out the sweetness. I did not mix the chicken with the sauce in order to keep the chicken crispy. Next time I would make the sauce in a saucepan at the same time the chicken is frying, so the chicken doesn't cool off.

Good but I will give it another try. I cut the chicken into bit size pieces before I marinated it. Next time I will not shake the chicken in the flour but maybe sift flour onto it. The cornstarch did not dissolve into the sauce as I expected so I will try sifting that into the sauce as well.

This recipe is straight out of a Chinese/Oriental restaurant. The chicken was amazing and so was the sauce! Made rice on the side with steamed broccoli and pea pods. And this is how I screwed up the meal. I will swear that the rice cooker doing double time did me in, but I will definetly make this again (without the steamed veggies)!

This is a great tasting recipe.  I have to agree with another review and suggest not heating chicken in the sauce, the coating will fall off. Other than that, this was fantastic and definitely a keeper!

I'm a fair cook, but this is the first thing off of this site that I made that my boyfriend absolutely loved! He doesn't like having the same thing twice in 2 weeks, but he asked for this 2 days later. I followed the recipe almost word for word and it was awesome!

Sauce was thick and gluey, even my kids who love sauce thought it was too much. We were disappointed. I might try again but I'll make some substitutions. I'll tempura the chicken use 1/2 the sauce with 1/2 the orange and much less cornstarch would make this a great dish.

I give it 4,5 stars. My 4-year old son is crazy about orange chicken they make at a local Chinese chain. I've tried to recreate it several times based on different recipes, but never close enough. This recipe is very good - it's sweet and tart at the same time and my son loved it. however, there isn't much of 'orange' in it. I also had tons of sauce left. besides these two points - very easy to make and yum!

It was good but not great! We didn't have rice vinegar so we had to sub with a different variety (wine vingegar). The taste was a bit tart, but it still tasted good, everything else was followed to a tee. We added in broccoli and snow peas at the end. I would consider making this again, served with steamed rice, singapore noodles (from this site) and peanut tofu recipe (from this site).

Great Recipe, but you definitely don't need to add any more spice. Perfect as is. Like others, I waited to add the sauce to the chicken - a good idea to keep the breading intact.   breaded it with half flour/half corn starch - made it crispier!

The family really liked it and I will make again. I had to make several substitutions just so I didn't have to go to the store, but turned out really good anyhow. HAD TO CUT THE CORNSTARH IN HALF AND STILL WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH. Overall really tasty.

This recipe was very good, next time I will do away with the cornstarch or use just a pinch, as it made my sauce too thick and gel like...also I seasoned the chicken with some adobo and cracked black pepper before adding the marinade. And instead of marinating for two hours I am marinating overnite...

We found this quite gingery. Would not do the flour coating step next time as it seemed to burn and yet still taste floury at the same time. Not our favorite Asian chicken recipe.

This recipe was wonderful. I made it with tofu instead of chicking and it was sooo good. I have just recently started cooking with tofu and this is the best it has ever turned out. The marinade really soaks into the tofu. I skipped the step with coating the tofu in flour, and I used lime juice instead of lemon, and red onion instead of green onion (I didn't have any). Next time I will add some veggies. Thanks for an amazing recipe.

I brought this recipe to a potluck, and reserved the sauce until right before everyone was ready to eat. The chicken still got a bit soggy as soon as I poured it on - wasn't crispy at all. I would make it again, but without the breading!

This recipe is fantastic. Based on the other reviews, the only thing my boyfriend and I changed was the amount of cornstarch added to the sauce. We will definitely make this again and again!

Great recipe- my kids loved it.I doubled the recipe and it was enough for a family of 4 good eaters. No more buying orange chicken takeout when you can make it simply with common ingredients at home!  Thanks Harry!

Cut back on the corn starch. It is a tad too much. I cut it down to 1.

I just made this for the second time and it was so much better this time around. I don't think I used much orange zest last time and using the full amount this time made all the difference! I also reduced the sugar to 3/4c and that made it perfect for us.

I thought this dish was too tart & too sticky. The orange flavor over-powered the chicken. I won't be making this again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was AMAZING! The only problem was my cornstarch clumping, next time I would cut down on the amount of cornstarch altogether (I fished most of it out and the sauce was perfect and thick) and add water accordingly. Definitely a keeper and an impressive meal for guests!

This recipe was SOOO good! I ended up just frying the chicken and pouring the sauce over it. Much easier this way in my opinion. 

Super recipe! 5 stars *****

This was an excellent recipe that provided a refreshing change to our usual weekend menus.
I was wondering where to add the red pepper flakes. I just threw them in the sauce at the end. 
I used 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch and 1tbsp of water and it was more than enough. 
I followed another reviewer's suggestion and kept the cooked chicken in a warm oven, then served it over the rice with the sauce poured on top. Kept it crispy.
GREAT recipe when you're in the mood for something different or something tangy.

This chicken is so tasty. I used yellow onion instead of green and added snow peas to the sause in the last few minutes. I also used a four/water mix to thicken. Turned out delish.

This recipe was a comedy of errors for me but was still wonderful. There was a delicately sweet orange taste, a subtle taste of ginger, and a hint of spice. I accidentally added 1C of extra water and accidentally doubled the orange zest. I used bottled lemon juice and bottled ginger (increased to 3/4 tsp because it wasn't fresh). I also used normal onions and plain white sugar because I prob only had an ounce of brown. I strained off the zest, pepper flakes, onion, and garlic and added the corn starch to the liquid. It was divine. I will def try again and perhaps it will be even closer to restaraunt quality (not that it wasnt already worthy).

My family loves this.   Also, I saved some time and used some leftovers(frozen breaded chicken patties).  I heated them and cubed them, then added them to the hot sauce just before putting over rice.  Even my picky 4 and 7 year ate it and asks me to make it.Edit 4/10/09...After making this for a few yearsnow, I now marinate pork loin roast in the cooled unthickened sauce. Then grill or bake.  Family LOVES this on the grill in the summer. I  also use the sauce on whole chickens, then bake .  The only thing I haven't put it on is beef, but definitely will be trying this summer.

This was probably the BEST Asian chicken recipe I have ever tried as far as flavor goes.  Like a few reveiwers before me though, I wish I had read the other reviews first to know that putting the chicken back into the sauce caused that breading to fall off... honestly, I feel like you don't even need the breading and will probably skip it all together the next time.  All in all: wonderful recipe.  THANX!

this was very good, i ran out of rice vinegar so i had to use part cooking sherry, i also had no orange zest but this turned out great. i should  have read the reviews first and following the other suggestions as to not put the chicken back in the sauce as it takes the batter off. still a grat recipe.... thanks for sharing

I liked this, but I did think it was a little to lemony. Next time I'll definitely cut back on the lemon juice. I also was having a problem with my flour staying on my chicken. Allot of it was clumped into my sauce. I should've listened to previous reviews and never put it back into the sauce- rather scoop the sauce over my chicken when served.

The flavor of this chicken is outstanding! It reminded me of the orange chicken that you can get at the Cheesecake Factory. The only suggestion I could make is to skip coating the chicken in flour before cooking. It all just fell off into the sauce and made the sauce cloudy.

I breaded and fried chicken cutlets and set aside.  I made the sauce and left out the green onion, rice vinegar and ginger.  I did add more orange juice.  I poured the sauce over the chicken and garnished with orange slices.  Awesome!  Thank you.

This recipe is great and every time I make it people cannot believe how much it tastes like the orange chicken from a restaurant.  I have made it with the breading and without and can't say I noticed that much of a difference so I usually leave it out.  Definitely on the regular rotation for meals!

Overall it was a good recipe taste like the real thing , I also added some bell peppers, brocoli, and sliced orange pieces like at the restaurants so it looked even more appealing and colorful.  I would add the cornstarch mixture gradually though you don't want to make it thicker than it is juicy.

I liked the orange zest but some thought it was too orangey. I also had to add extra corn starch b'c the sauce wasn't thick enough.

This was good.  My mother-in-law was impressed.  I took the advice and didn't simmer the chicken in the sacue.  I just poured some on top just before I served. it. De-lish!

This recipe is wonderful, with an incredible taste and rivals the "real" thing at Asian restaurants.  I made some minor changes.  I didn't have time to marinade the chicken, so I deleted that step.  Since I had more sauce, the 3 Tbsp corn starch was necessary.  I started with 2 and added more.  I used pineapple/orange/apple juice since that was made in the fridge.  I also used the rind from one medium orange - so it had plenty of orange flavor.  I like things with more flavor, especially garlic and ginger, so I bumped those to 1 tea. each.  I use the grated ginger in a tube, not fresh.  In the breading, I used 1/2 tea. white pepper instead of 1/4 tea black pepper.  For garnish, I added 1 Tbsp of toasted sesame seed.  I served it with ginger/soy noodles with veggies.  I would actually prefer the chicken with tempura batter, so I may try that instead of breading next time.  The extra sauce was a great dipping sauce for our Asian appetizers.  I had enough left to freeze for later use.  Next time I will make about 2/3 the recipe for sauce.

The chicken was delicious.  I helped cook for 12 hungry fraternity brotehrs, and though we were short on time; we improvised on the breading part.  Shorter prep time, but a great dish in the end.  I had some Cara Cara oranges that I used for the zest, and it really brought out the flavor.  Try this recipe!

This was sooooooo good and the left overs are great as well. The only thing i felt to change was it did not need to marinate for 2 hours. Just cook it right on up the sauce is oragney enought you dont need to soak the chicken YUMM!

FABULOUS! I used fresh orange juice instead of concentrate.  I doubled the chicken and only put 1 cup of sauce in with it to marinate.  I drained the chicken before coating it in flour and used less oil.  I used ground pepper instead of flakes, and used fresh OJ instead of water with half the amount of cornstarch.  I added 1+ cup stir-fried veggies in the final step.  My husband said this one is a keeper!  Thanks, Harry!

This was a great marinade but like other reviewers, I had problems with the coating process.  I will use this marinade in the future however I don't think I will use it for this recipe.

This was great.  It's hard to find recipes for chinese food that taste like something from a restaurant, but this one really does!  I left out the ginger (don't care for it) and orange peel (didn't have any).  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

My husband said 3, I said 5, so it gets a 4. It was really good. As per all the  comments, i used a lot less corn starch in the sauce, poured sauce on top of chicken instead of stirring it in. I also fried the chicken in corn starch rather than flour, turned out great!

I did a lot of substitutions in an effort to avoid the grocery store--used white vinegar instead of rice, ground ginger instead of ginger root, and red onion in place of green. I added a chopped onion when cooking the chicken, as well as chopped zucchini and eggplant. I also used less cornstarch (3 tsp dissolved in about 1 1/2 tbsp water). Really great flavor! I threw on a good bit of Sriracha hot sauce for an extra kick and served it with Basmati rice.

I used tofu (cut into little cubes) instead of chicken and added a little bit of cayanne pepper to the sauce at the end right before I put everything together for the final simmer.

this was a decent rendition of the orange chicken we have all tried but i must say that too labor intensive for the results that i got.  somehow the crispiness of the chicken went away after a little time in the oven warming and overall it was okay.

Yummy.  I agree with Jeannette, about the breading crumbling off while trying to stir in the sauce....pouring it over would be better.  Thanks for the tasty recipe Harry!

This tasted wonderful! It was really easy, although it was very time consuming. I took some other suggestions and cut the cornstarch down to 2 tbsp, I omitted the extra salt, and I took the advice to keep it warm in the oven instead of stirring the chicken back into the sauce, to avoid the coating from coming off. It all worked out great.

I made this with a fried rice recipe I found on here and it was really yummy! My husband loved it, and so did some other family members who stopped by over the weekend. The leftovers were even good. Thanks for the recipe! I will make it again!

This is an excellent recipe. The next time I make it I might use a little less orange zest, but that is just my personal taste. I used cornstarch to coat the chicken instead of flour and deep fried the pieces. I will definitely make this many more times.

I would not call this an orange chicken dish simply because it did not taste like any orange chicken I have tasted and I am Asian. It was more of a sweet and sour chicken. When I try out recipes for the first time, I usually follow them to the tee making very few modifications if any to be fair. All in all, I may make this one more time but I probably won't drench in flour next time (just marinade overnight as I did this time)and see if that works better.

I am ecstatic to have found this recipe! I just moved out of state and dearly missed a vegan Chinese restaurant's orange chicken. This is almost exactly like it, if not -- dare I say--  better! I've made this three times in less than two weeks for my boyfriend and myself, substituting the meat with soy chicken. I love it! He loves it too, even as a carnivore. The only thing I changed was instead of lemon juice, I used pineapple because that's all I had. It comes out just how I love it. Fabulous!

Recipe tasted pretty good, but the texture wasn't quite right. Needs to be a little crispier. Will make again and follow previous reviewers suggestion of mixing the sauce and chicken on a platter instead of over heat.
