The recipe was awesome as is.  The instructions are a little unorganized at first, but next time I will have a clearer idea of what to do when.  Next time I will make much more sauce, as it was outstanding mixed with the rice that I served along with it.  We will definitely make this again, but I will just make a much bigger batch of it!

This is a recipe I created for Swanson  but I forgot to mention...please use a non stick skillet or you'll have a hard time with the bacon sticking and the brown sugar from the apples will burn. While I'm here I'll give it 5 Stars...lol!

I love this recipe.  All the different flavors  make your tastebuds dance for joy.  Did not a change a thing except to use rice instead of couscous (none on hand).  Will definitely make again

I made this for dinner tonite using boneless chops, so thicker than they recommended but thought they were delicious.  I reduced the sauce after the chops were done.

My husband really liked this. I didn't change a thing. No problem with sticking pans or not sticking apples. I even used a cast iron skillet!
SuzieQ-The apples simmer so that the flavor of the brown sugar and the apples infuse the juices as well as lightly coating the apples.

This recipe is a good place to start...personal taste, but it seems a bit heavy on lemon juice.  Gave it a sour taste.  To counteract that I added a little more brown sugar to the pan sauce and it was delicious.  We enjoyed it with a vegetable rice pilaf and broccoli.  Love the pork two ways w/the addition of tangy sauce!

An awesome recipe!  So flavorful and moist.  Made teeny tiny changes.  I used thicker cut pork chops that I brined in apple juice with salt, pepper, and crushed garlic overnight, I added NO sugar to the apple, but I added  about 1/8th teaspoon of cinnamon.  Even though I cooked the bacon, it really did not need it for additional flavor. Topped with fresh flat leaf parsley instead of green onions.  I will make this again without the bacon or sugar. Thank you for the delicious recipe.

It turned out good & tasted pretty good. My sister who was over for dinner said it was scrumptious. I Don't know if I'd make it again though, it was a bit challenging for my cooking experience.
Also I prepared the recipe as directed with 3 exceptions. 1. I didn't use Swanson stock, I used a chicken bouillon cube. 2. Didn't have a Braeburn a apple, so I used a Fuji apple. 3. I didn't have any green onions, so I used a small sweet yellow onion diced.
One more thing, I used applewood smoked bacon??

This was delicious, but my apple wasn't tart enough. I think next time I'll try it with pineapple instead of apple.

This one is going in my monthly rotation! My husband loved it and he doesn't like it much when I cook outside his comfort zone. He ate more than I expected and said he'd be happy if I made "that one" again! Yay!! Score! I made a double batch as I am feeding a family of 5, one being a teen aged boy. I did not have fresh scallions on hand so I substituted onion powder and just sprinkled to taste. I did not have a fresh lemon so I used lemon juice instead. I used gala apples as it was all I had on hand. I had vegetable stock so I used that. It was still amazing! I fully intend on having all the ingredients correct next time, but this is a must have!!

This was so, so good. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it seems like it could use some simplifying. As written, its flavor is perfect, but it feels like a lot of work to get there for some reason. I won't let that stop me from making it again though, because really, YUM.

I Think it was really good but 20 minutes is way too long.      I think thicken the sauce before you put that pork chops in and then only put the pork chops in for 5 to 8 minutes tops!

Flavor  was so good! I monitored the pork chops with thermometer so they wouldn't get overdone.  All pork chops are not equal!  Served with brussel sprouts cooked with brown sugar and chicken broth. Brought the whole thing together.  Definitely will  make again

Really liked this recipe, the family loved it. 
I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/3cup. 
I also found they were cooked after about 10 minutes.

I added glazed carrots and fresh parsley in place of green onions but this is an amazingly delicious recipe.  Definitely a new favorite.

This was sooo delicious. I also added italian for the seasoning of the porkchops, and a few spoons of brown sugar and a pinch of salt (because mine turned out a but too sour at first for the sauce)and it turned out amazing. Definitely gonna make this again.

My whole family lived this! We made it just as the recipe was written and it turned out great. We'll definitely make it again!

I thought this was a great recipe and easy to follow. I didn't have green onions so I used a yellow onion instead. The pork chops came out very juicy and favorful. The bacon and apples are a great combo topped on the pork chop. I look forward to making this again and using green onions next time !

It was OK, but simmering the chops for 20 minutes is too long and I used thick pork chops.

They were done after just 10 minutes
