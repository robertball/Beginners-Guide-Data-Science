tried this recipe because i am the daring type and it was unrated and sounded like the perfect pasta dish i was looking for to cook for a girl i was pursueing,her being a pasta fanatic.It did in fact turn out wonderfully and went perfectly with  my boneless orange chicken breast recipe. obviously this meal was inteded for a much bigger group than 2,but leftovers the next evening were still great as freshly made.dont change a thing and enjoy this great pasta recipe.

I'll stick to a more traditional use of saffron next time.

Easy and a good use for cauliflower! To add depth, add garlic,dried red peppers, chives and/or parmesan cheese for a main dish. Serve with salad and a hearty bread...perfect for vegetarians! I bought Mexican saffron from Trader Joe's for around $6.99.....so it is POSSIBLE to find saffron fairly cheap without killing the budget. I really like this one with the add-ins....KEEPER!

This oneâ€™s a keeper! We really liked this combination of flavors. It has a Mediterranean taste with the saffron, nuts, and raisins. I browned the bread crumbs on the stove. I added a generous amount of hot peppers. It makes a beautiful presentation; definitely a company-worthy dish. Thank you for the recipe.
