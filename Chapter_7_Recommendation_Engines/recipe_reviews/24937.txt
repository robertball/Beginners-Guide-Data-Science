After looking at other recipes here, my wife and I decided on this one.  It was very simple to make and didn't require added yeast as many others here do.  
The first time we used it, it wasn't quite right, but we've been using it for about 3 months since then with excellent resuts.  Its got a good flavor and the dough always rises without any help from store-bought yeast.
The starter itself is low maintenance and was completely unphased when I forgot to feed it for 4 weeks.

Well, this starter did not work for me!!  At the start of day 3 the starter was turning a reddish colour, which I learned is not a good thing.  The recipe did not specify to cool off the potato water before adding the other ingredients so perhaps my water was too hot to start with.  If anyone knows what I did wrong, please let me know!!  Thanks.

This starter worked great, and I had a nice starter after letting it sit for 4 days.  I can't wait to let it age and develop even more tasty sourdough flavor!

I started this one and the "No commercial yeast starter" from this site on the same day, and the other one is developing faster. But it's working, and I'll update when I make my first batch of bread with each one. Update: Both of my starters smelled atrocious in less than a week and had to be thrown out.

Worked great, even though I didn't have cheesecloth. I used a loosely woven kitchen towel, and periodically removed it to check on the progress. By the third day I saw a few bubbles; by the fourth day it had a foamy texture when stirring.

This was very easy to start!  It was bubbly and ready to use after only two days.

I prefer to use a potato water based sourdough starter. Maybe it's my Irish background. Mine got it's first "feeding" today. Looking forward to starting the New Year sharing sourdough bread with my friends and neighbors.

I have to be gluten free (wish I had a choice) and I have been missing sour dough scones,pancakes, and bread.  Started this the day after thanksgiving with my potato water I had saved and Bon’s Red Mill cup for cup flour.  I’m super excited because today I am going to have sourdough pancakes for the first time in YEARS.

It looks really good, but  the potato water has separated from the rest of the stuff and has turned a color that looks a lot like black tea.  Is it suppose to do that?

This worked fantastic. It only took 2 days to be ready. Made pancakes for breakfast this am. Made sourdough pizza crusts for supper tonight. This is a keeper.

I mashed one of the potatoes and left it with the starter. After a day it's already smelling like a starter and I can't wait to make some bread.
