After eating TGIF's frozen Creamy Chicken Carbonara I knew I had to get a recipe like this. THANKS 1 000 000 for this EASY recipe without eggs! I used PENNE PASTA heavy cream instead of milk and fresh garlic & fresh sliced mushrooms & it came our fabulous! It will be a side dish for xmas! In the future as an entree I will add ready made charred chichen strips. I followed it to a T otherwise. Thank You!

Very quick and easy just not that much flavor nor was it very creamy. Next time if there is a next time for this one I'll add heavy whipping cream more parmesan and some garlic salt.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and used extra bacon. My bacon was already pre-cooked/crumbled so I just used butter instead of bacon grease. I followed some other reviews and sauteed onion and garlic before adding the other ingredients. I didn't really measure the parm. I just added it until it was the consistancy that I wanted. This came together very nicely and had a great taste. I also added some parsley and black pepper at the end to the sauce for something extra. I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing.:)

Very easy recipe. What I did is instead of using garlic powder I sauted real garlic in the bacon grease & everything else the same. The sauce was thick & i'm guessing its cause it's cheese sauce. Pop's enjoying it now.!

As someone who LOVES carbonara I'm always looking for a easier less fat method of making it. I thought that this was great! Very easy!! I've made it 2 ways once following the recipe as stated and again using 1/3 less fat cream cheese and turkey bacon. I thought both were good!! I did use a little extra parmesan cheese for my own preference. Very yummy!!

This is wonderful and very easy. I doubled the recipe using a pound of pasta. I actually tripled the parmesan to 1 1/2 cups. I didn't drain the bacon grease my bacon was lean so I left it all. I added extra seasoning like black pepper and a few drops of Lousiana hot sauce for flavor. I wasn't fond of the peas in this dish next time I will add sliced mushrooms or maybe chicken instead.

Never made this dish before it was easy and very tasty. I used turkey bacon fresh garlic and neufchatel cheese in place of cream cheese. Added fresh black pepper and red pepper flakes for a bit of zing...yum.

Not good at all! The cream cheese lumped up and after sitting for a few minutes became hard. I followed the recipe exactly but in the end had to throw it out.

I made this recipe the night I returned home from vacation. I wanted something quick and easy made with things that I had in my pantry. This recipe was all of those things. While I knew going into it that I wouldn't get an authentic carbonara flavor this was a little tiresome on the palate - flat and uninteresting. I might tinker with this recipe again to see if I can make it a bit more to our tastes.

This was good. Not great but good. It is great for a quick fix meal. My Significant Other thought it was good. Had it for lunch today. Might be a great base for something. I need to make it again to see.

This was ok. I sauteed some chopped onion and garlic before adding the other ingredients and it was still a bit bland for my taste. But it was a nice easy way to use up some food in my fridge. Husband enjoyed it.

A good base recipe. Like others I doubled this but still found it bland even after adding fresh garlic seasoned salt and pepper. A little more seasoning on the finished dish and it's good but not great.

I love carbonara but most recipes are a pain in the arse. This is as good as what I get at the Cheesecake Factory and if you're worried about tasting cream cheese in the sauce don't it's not detectible. This is a fast easy and cheap weeknight meal.

Turned out very good! I added onions and garlic to the bacon and used more bacon then deglazed the pan with wine before adding in the milk and cream cheese. The cream cheese was lumpy and never did fully melt. An immersion blender would have been great for this. Still was very delicious but quite "heavy" definitely not a guilt free dinner.

Delicious! This was so easy and fast to make for dinner that it is going to be a definite repeat on my menu. I used low fat milk and it came out just fine. Granted it doesn't taste quite like Carbonara sauce nontheless it is perfect (and much easier) this way.

I really liked this recipe. I had to change a few things because I didnt have the right ingredients. I used shrimp instead of chicken and asparragus instead of peas. I also cut the cheese in half and the other half I added heavy cream and not all the milk but some. I made about half of it and my husband loved it!! It was really delish. The bacon really does the trick! Oh and I had ran out of parm cheese so I added some 4 cheese mixture I had:)

Made this exactly as the recipe stated. Family and I didn't care for it. My husband said it tasted unusually tangy. I think it was the cream cheese. Just not as good as a traditional carbonara recipe.

I wouldn't change anything about this dish! It was delicious and simple to make. It takes a short time to make as well. I changed the noodles to farfalle.
