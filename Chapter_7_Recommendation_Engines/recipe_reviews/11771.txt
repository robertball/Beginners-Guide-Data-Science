This is a very good sauce.  I have tried quite a few and this is my husband’s favorite.  I cut the water amount in half because of others recommendations, I highly recommend this or the sauce will be very thin and watery.  I also add a ½ teaspoon of sugar.  We make this now once a week!

Thanks Frank for the recipe......to make it a quick sauce, cut the water down to a cup and the oil down to 1/4 cup......simmer for 15 minutes and add flour to bind the oil, water and tomato and spices......voila! a fast pizza sauce that's ready while your dough is rising!

Excellent!  I always use this recipe when I make my famous homemade pizza.  I make the sauce and dough in the morning and let them both sit on the counter until dinner.  Thus, the sauce has a marvelous flavor and the dough has had time to ferment. When making the sauce, I add less water and oil than the recipe calls for.  This sauce has an incredible flavor!  Thanks for a tremendous recipe.  My family and friends rave about the pizza!

My whole family liked this sauce a lot.  The only thing I did different was I put all the ingredients together and simmered it for about an hour and than I just let it sit for another hour before I made the pizza.  It came out great. Thanks.

Great Sauce!  I used double the garlic for my garlic loving family. I did not have rosemary, so I used Italian Spices instead.  I also only put 1 cup fo water.

Well. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO: Its a great recipe. I tasted it and said yuck..Then it sat in my frige for 4 days. And WOW!! The paste eventually thickens All.  Anyhow, with the time it had all was Delicious. A big factor I think..I used it with Ravioli and was Delish..

This is the best pizza sauce!  I only used 1 cup of water and it was great.  I froze the rest.  Also, I didn't have time to let it sit before using and it still tasted yummy!  Try Jay's Signature Pizza crust on this website.

Easy, yes but way too watery if you follow the recipe.  I adjusted the water down to 2/3 cup and replaced the oil with 2 Tbsp. of wine.  I added a little salt and 1 tsp. of sugar along with a 1/4 tsp. of onion powder and cut back on the oregano, basil and rosemary to taste using a little over 1/4 tsp. each.  Overall, not bad but don't use all that water unless you want a very, very thin sauce.

Goes with Jay's Pizza Crust. We've found it tastes much better if we make it the night before and let the flavors blend in the fridge overnight.

Great sauce. A bit thin for my liking so I added a bit less water than it called for.

SUPER TASTE and was simple and quick. I only used 1 cup of water as suggested by the previous review. I also substituted italian seasonings and added some minced onions and 1 packet of equal.  I used the Pillsbury Pizza in a can with some provolane cheese and it taste juste like LEDOs Pizza!  It's even better the next day- cold.

Delicious!  I decreased the water to 1 cup, and oil to 1/4 cup.  I was a little impatient and tasted it right after mixing in the ingredients so it had that raw tomato paste flavour, but once you let it settle and place it on your pizza, it really is quite tasty!  It is a little bit oily, but I guess that's why it's so good!  This will definitely be in rotation!

This recipe was great.  We used it on "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" from this website and they compliment each other well.  The only thing that we did different was use approx. 1 cup of water, not 1 1/2 cups.  Thanks for an awesome recipe that we will be using again very soon!

1 cup of water was sufficient to get the consistency I wanted. Easy and tasty. This one is a keeper.

this recipe is pretty good, but i found it quite bland. i doubled up on the oregano and garlic, added a tablespoon of garlic powder and a tablespoon of fresh chopped basil and it was still lacking a bit of flavor. i think it may need a bit of sugar, but i'm not quite sure. this is great as a base sauce.

I give this 4 stars because the water and oil amounts were way too much and I had to start all over.  As others mentioned, cut the water down to 1 cup and the oil to 1/4 cup.  This was a good sauce in that you actually taste the toppings you put on instead of the sauce.

Great sauce! Did add less water and oil, added a tsp of sugar to cut some of the acidic taste of the tomato. Will make again. Thanks Frank!

I am hot / cold over this recipe! The hot part is that it is EASY and i had ALL of the ingredients to make my own sauce on hand --- easy is brilliant! the sauce tasted good - but it was not blow your mind outstanding.... would i make it again in a pinch? Yes - i would - but something is missing... It is also a bit sweeter than i would imagine a pizza suace should be - maybe cut the sugar in half. I will have to play with it. Still - for being homeade i cannot complain! thank you ALL RECIPES! BTW - i used fressh oregano and basil from my garden - that flavor was shining thru the recipe. Also, used 3/4 cup water - so it wasn't runny.

The first time I made this I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I didn't add rosemary (I don't like rosemary.)  It was very good only a bit too watery...I like a really thick sauce.  The next few times I made it, I added only 1 cup of water.  What a difference!  The sauce was nice and thick like I like it.  

Today, I was able to make the sauce with fresh basil and oregano from my garden, and the fresh herbs added such a wonderful flavor! If you have the chance to use fresh herbs, you'll be really amazed at the difference!

The recipe stands on it's own as a great recipe..I say try it!  If you make it "as is" you'll have a great pizza sauce.  It's better than the pizza places in my town, and my family prefers homemade to delivery any day! And with a two minute prep time and NO COOKING, who can beat that!?!

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I wasn't overly impressed with this sauce. I thought it had too much oil, and it made the pizza taste too greasy. If I were to try it again, I'd add less oil-I also only used 1/2 c. water, and that made the consistency just right. I may or not make this again-I like store bought pizza sauce better. Thanks though! :)

If you follow this recipe the results will be incredibly watery.  I made this when we had friends over and no one even tried the sauce because of the consistency.  My advice would be to use less water and then see if you need to add more.

Following the directions, this came out much too watery.  I added more tomato paste and ended up with enough to freeze for another 2 or so applications.  Flavour was good though still and you can't beat the ease.  Next time I will adjust the recipe to perhaps half the water.

I made this exactly as listed and it was tasteless and very watery.So to make it worth making pizza ,I  doubled the garlic,added 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of onion powder. I also decided to simmer the sauce on the stove on low for 30 min to cook the sauce.   The sauce tastes raw if it is not cooked. The result , a flavourful sauce worthy of  a pizza.

I naively followed the actual recipe without reading the five star reviews and ended up with enough tomato "soup" for 5 pizzas. Needs way less water.

This was a tasty sauce.  I cut down the water because 1 1/2 cups looked like a little much.  I ended up using 1 cup and Im glad I did.  Thanks for sharing!

Very, very good. Husband and 2 1/2 year old loved the pizza made with this sauce. And the house smelled fantastic while pizza was baking. After reading alot of reviews, I doubled the recipe, but didn't double oil and water- came out great.

Quick, simple, and easy but really, really good!  I followed others advice and reduced the water and I added in a few dashes of Worcestershire Sauc.  I also simmered the sauce for about an hour on low heat with 2 bay leaves.  I used it on Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site.  The pizza was better then delivery!

Definitely better than store bought and alot easier to make than I thought.  My changes: I used only 1 cup of water, 4 tblsp of olive oil and 1 tsp of salt and followed the rest of the recipe.  You must let it sit for at 4 hours to let the flavors marry.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was easy and cheap.  I had all the ingredients on hand accept the 35cent can of tomato paste.  It was far too watery and oily, so I took the advice of another reviewer and simply simmered for awhile until it thickened nicely.  After which I let it sit for a few hours.  It was still a little oily for my taste, but not bad.  In the end it was an easy, cheap sauce to make that was a little bland for my husband's and my tastes.  However this would make a GREAT pizza sauce if you have children, since they almost always prefer milder flavors.

DELICIOUS!  After learning how to make authentic crust, this sauce makes for a wonderful combination!  I set it in the refrigerator over night so the flavors could blend.  I had to use 14 oz. of tomatoe sauce instead of the paste and water and it turned out to be the perfect consistency!  No more store-bought sauce here!

I love this recipe!  I am a personal chef and I have many clients with children.  One of my menu options is "Make Your Own Pizza Night" and this is my go to sauce every time.  I'm always looking for quick easy recipes that are tasty and this one fits the bill!  Don't change a thing!  I agree with some other viewers that it tastes better once it's had time to marinate in the fridge.

Oily & Bland - I already regret wasting the ingredients on it (I could never get the oil incorporated - I tried mixing in some shaker-style parm/romano cheese to absorb the oil).  Maybe my husband can fix it when he gets home...

I just whipped this up tonight when I realized that I didn't have any pizza sauce on hand or even so much as a jar of tomato sauce!  I was about to order pizza online when I decided to check here for a recipe using just tomato paste, since I did have one can of that...and I found this recipe!  I'm SO glad I did! Comes together in seconds and tastes fabulous!  I subbed anchovy paste for the salt and added about a teaspoon (if that) of sugar.

I LOVE THIS SAUCE!  I actually crave it!  Thank you, Frank, for sharing! I have made it dozens of times now and made some of the same changes that others have made (only 1 cup water, tsp. sugar. Also, I never have the spices separately; so, I just use the Italian Seasonings.)  Since I'm always in a hurry, I make mine in the blender and often use it without it sitting.  I also freeze any leftovers.  After making my own pizzas a few times with this sauce, we actually ate one of the "major chain's" pizzas.  I was so disappointed with it after tasting this!  Haven't ordered pizza out since!

Finally found my pizza sauce...yeah!! It was perfect!  I did add about a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce, that is the only thing I did different to the original recipe. I made it in the morning and stuck it in the fridge for the day. Took it out about a half hour before preparing the pizzas. Letting the sauce sit for a few hours or more really allows for all of the ingredients to mesh together. I had enough sauce for two, ten inch pies, plus enough leftover to freeze for two more pies.  This recipe is going in my tried and true recipe box!!

In 4 generations of us, no one has ever made a real pizza restaurant sauce like this. I will never go back to the family way of doing things. My only comments are to go a little lighter on the EVOO.

Very good.  I mixed it in the food processor and added half an onion. Cutting down on the liquids is a good idea. Tasted like the sauce recipe from when I grew up in upstate NY.  

I used a store bought crust mix because I was chicken,  That was a mistake -next time, I'll make Jay's crust.

Excellent!  We like the sauce thin, so I didn't change anything except up the garlic to 5 cloves, and I forgot to make it ahead of time so after combining all of the ingredients I heated it up for one minute in the microwave.  Absolutely delicious, but I'd like to make it again and let it sit for a few days first.  Pizza topped with this sauce, artichokes, fresh tomatoes and goat cheese, the best pizza ever.

Very good pizza sauce.  I did as other reviewers did and only used 1 cup of water and I added a tsp of brown sugar.  This went well over Jay's signature pizza crust.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

What a wonderful souce!!! I made it a few times already and every time it comes out better and better. I'm using only 1/2 cup water and double the garlic (we love garlic). I'm planning to use it as pasta sauce this week... Thank you...

I followed the directions and let the sauce set out for a couple of hours. It was watery, and as written I would have put tomato water on my crust. So I cooked it on the stove, low setting for about an hour. The recipe itself is solid. The flavor combination is perfect. But you do have to simmer the ingredients if you want an actual sauce.

Very good sauce. Don't skip the fresh garlic though. It really makes a difference. Enough for at least two pizzas. I reduced the amount of water to 1C rather than 1 1/2 C.

LOVE it!  I cheated **hides face**.  I just HAD to have a pizza right then, so i nuked the sauce for 2.5 minutes in my microwave.  I'm pizza bound!  
The sauce turned out a nice consistency after the visit to the microwave.  I only used 1 cup of water because it was looking thin, but, based on my rushed calculations, it'd have been fine after sitting for a few hours and waiting.  So, if i have the patience to let it sit, i'd try the full amount of water.  It's an easy fix if it's too runny, just let it simmer for a few minutes, or add flour (1tbsp) and nuke. 
THANKS FRANK!  This is awesome!  :D

Not a bad sauce!  I did lower the water to 1 cup, and the olive oil to 1/4, but added 1/4 cup of red wine for extra flavor.  I simmered for 15 minutes to help all the flavors to blend, let it cool and refrigerated until I was ready to use it.  Really happy with the flavor of this quick and easy sauce.  Oh, I used the roasted garlic tomato paste!

Bravo! Very good sauce! I like many others cut the water in half to 3/4 cup but I kept the oil amount the same and added a tablespoon of sugar. This turned out perfect and has helped make many delicious pizzas in my household!

Easy Pizza Sauce I Haiku: "Oh yes, it's easy! I only reduced water, but kept it the same." Left my sauce to sit for the afternoon b4 spreading on a stellar cauliflower-crust recipe that I found on eat-drink-smile for a truly awesome pizza dinner. Topped w/ spinach and some sauteed veggies, this fool-proof sauce made a great pizza!)

I would give this a 3 star review as is, which is how I tried making it the first time around.  With some tweaking, can definitely go up in rating.  For pizza sauce, this is WAYYYYYY too watery.  Next time I will try using only about 1/2 the water.  And more seasoning.  The recipe is a good starting point though.

Definitely use WAY LESS water. I find that filling the 6 oz tomato paste can is just about right, may need a tad more but it's easy to adjust to the right consistency. The first time I made this I used the full amount stated in the recipe & had to thicken it up with additional tomato paste. However, this is very tasty & easy. I find it to be MUCH better than the jarred sauce I used to keep on hand. It definitely tastes better after sitting for several hours (refrigerated of course). I haven't bought jarred sauce now forever!

Fantastic! I tried it with 1/4 c. olive oil, instead.  I don't think it needs quite as much oil.

THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE PIZZA SAUCE SINCE THE 1ST TIME I FOUND IT 8/2010. It is now from the west to east coast so many friends have asked for it. I use fresh basil and rosemary because i have it available to me and its even better. Thanks so much........

After reading the other reviews, I reduced the water to 1 cup & the olive oil to 1/4 cup. I make it ahead so the ingredients have time to blend. No cooking -  just mix the ingredients together & refridgerate.  The next day, it's ready! We don't like our pizzas swimming in sauce, just a nice flavor base for the other toppings, so this is enough sauce for 2-3 large pizzas.

I prepared this recipe exactly as directed. I felt the final product was too bitter and bland for my taste so I added approx. 1 tsp. of granulated sugar and 1 tsp. of onion powder. With these changes, I would definitely make this again.

This recipe definitely makes enough sauce for several pizzas. I ended up putting 2/3 of a single batch in the freezer for the next couple of times that I make pizza for dinner (there's only 2 of us).

For a chunkier sauce I like to add a can of whole tomatoes. I rinse the seeds out and squish them directly into the sauce. I also like to add a couple tsps of sugar. Delicious.

I used organic tomato paste, doubled the garlic and I added half of a small onion that I minced. Because other reviewers complained the sauce was a little thin, I also cut back on the water. This was a nice basic pizza sauce that was great on our Lunch Box Pizzas and this made enough for our Crescent Pizza Pockets tomorrow night! When I have more time, I think what I'll do next time is make the sauce the day before and let it sit until the next day. I think this is the kind of sauce that it improves when it sits.

I followed the recipe exactly. However, the sauce was so runny it was almost like water. I cooked it to reduce it and had to add another can of paste in order to make it thick enough so it didn't completely soak into the crust. I found another recipe that calls for a can of tomato paste like this one, but no water, just tomato sauce. I will use that one from now on. This recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH WATER in proportion to the amount of tomato paste.

The flavor was good, but the amount of water was too much.  I made it exactly as written, but would use 1/2 cup less water next time.  Will try this again tweaking it with a bit more garlic, oregano and maybe addd some parsley.

Quick and delicious. Be sure to let it stand awhile as recipe indicates -- this thickens the sauce and allows the flavors to meld.

Wonderful flavor, but cut the water in half and/or until you get the consistency you like. I also typically use less oil as well; still tastes great.

This sauce was pretty good. I reduced the water and oil to 1 cup and 1/4th a cup respectively as other reviewers suggested and it was a good consistency. For those complaining about the oil on top, try beating the sauce with a fork (like an egg). You have to mix it really well to distribute the oil throughout the sauce.

I thought this sauce was very good.  I reduced the water by 1/2 cup and I should have reduced the oil down too because it was too much.  I added one more clove of garlic.  I'll still recommend and be using this again.  It's a keeper. Thanks!

This was just okay... I thought it was too thin and too oily.  If I made it again I would cut the water even more than I already did (I cut it by half) and I would probably omit the olive oil entirly.  I just prefer a thicker sauce.  The flavor was pretty good though.  My husband liked it a lot.

I will never have to buy pizza sauce in a jar again!  For the water/tomato paste proportion, I used equal amounts (6 oz).  Also added about 1/2 tsp white sugar.

I love this pizza sauce!  It makes enough for two 14" pizzas.  My family only eats one at a time, so I froze the remainder.  I just used the leftover sauce last night and it was great!!

I cut down the water to 1 cup, as well (given the amount of oil in the recipe, the extra 1/2 cup of water would have made it too runny).

This was an excellent base!!!  I made a lot of changes as far as amounts, but the ingredients themselves were mostly unchanged.  I used 2 cans of tomato paste, reduced the water to 1 cup, and added a full tablespoon each of dried oregano, basil, and rosemary.  I also added a teaspoon each of sugar and dried parsley.  I used it on "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust" from this site, topped it with cheese and crumbled Italian turkey sausage, and it was AWESOME!!

This was an easy, tasty recipe using stuff I always have, and a batch costs about $.50 to make.  The only recommendations I have are: reduce the water to 1 cup and olive oil to 1/4 cup (we like thicker sauce).  I used italian seasoning instead of the herbs because it's all I had.  I put in one clove of garlic but wished I hadn't as that's all we could taste while eating our pizza (and we LOVE garlic).  So next time I make this recipe (and there will be a next time) I'll leave out the garlic.  Thanks!

Great sauce!  My family and I loved it!  I took some other reviewers' advice and put in only 1 cup of water (I originally put half the amount of water in, but added it so that it was 1 cup cause it seemed like it needed a little more).  I let it sit for 3 or 4 hours before I used it and it was really good.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm pretty picky about pizza sauce and this one is perfect.  I too cut the water and added a little sugar but those were the only changes I needed.  If you (like me) have been dinking around trying to tweak your own pizza sauce stop now, you've found the right recipe.

Very tasty sauce packed full of flavor. I used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead and no added water. I only let this stand an hour before use, and it turned out very good. This is a keeper, thanks!

My kids and I love this recipe. I use it for pizza; I use it for spaghetti; I even mix it with ground turkey to stuff mushrooms with....and my kids have no idea that I add a can of mixed veggies and blend with a handblender for a little extra nutrition.

It was okay. I cut the water and olive oil as others suggested. It could've used more garlic (I'm a fan of garlic.) Also, it could've used more of the other seasonsings. It was okay, but not fantastic.

This is a good sauce recipe, but I've made my own alterations. First, I used canned tomato paste that came with its own Italian seasonings. Next, I made the other reviewers' suggested cutbacks on the olive oil and water. I also added about 1 tablespoon of ketchup to sweeten the sauce a little bit. I then added 1/4 tsp of sugar. Finally, I increased the garlic and used a dried Italian seasoning mix of herbs. It comes out tasting close to spaghetti sauce, but it was too bland and bitter without the additions.

Used this last night for French bread pizzas and it was a bit hit!  I did cut down the water and oil and added about a cup of chopped tomatoes I had frozen from our garden.  Also added about half a can of tomato sauce along with the paste.  Increased the amount of spices because of these additions, plus some finely chopped chives.  Simmered on the stove for an hour or so.  Thanks for the recipe -- it's a keeper!!

This took five minutes to put together.  I simmered it for a few minutes instead of waiting.  I used half the oil a little less water as recommended, and I loved the results.  Perfect.  Thanks!

Easy and great.  I used less water and more spices (double).  I made the sauce as I was waiting for the pizza dough yeast to settle.  Then let it sit for one and one half hours while the pizza dough rose.  I made, also from this site, Jays Signature pizza crust and the italian sausage mix.  I froze the leftovers from the pizza dough and sausage mix for another pie.  I am from NJ the home of great Pizza Pie and this was mixture was just as good as we have here.  I will make this again.

I did let mine simmer for a little while, as I believe the flavors come together better that way.  This sauce is awesome!  Smelled like a pizzeria in myhouse while I was simmering it!  Next time I will use a tad less oil, a little bit too greasy, but overall this is awesome.  And very easy to make too!!!

This was a very tasty pizza sauce.  I followed a few suggestions, and cut down on the olive oil and used only 1 cup water.  I made this the day before, and it was just the right consistency.  This is definately a keeper.

I thought the flavoring was good, but I too thought it was a little on the runny side.   I will make it again but only add one cup of water.

This simple recipe is quick and easy to make. I don't usually let it sit and steep - I am sure it would taste even better if I had time to let the flavors mingle. I agree with previous posters that the recipe is better if you cut the water to just one cup. Very good on pizza.

Delicious & Easy!  Read previous reviews and also cut back on water by 1/2 C.  Next time I make it I will also cut back a little on the olive oil by just a little.

Wonderful sauce!  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I mostly use the canned tomato sauce instead of the paste/oil route (due to it being a bit faster) but it's still wonderful!  Thanks!

This was such an easy recipe, I was dissapointed when it wasn't a hit. Nice texture, but it came out rather bland - even though we let it rest in the fridge overnite. I think I'll try it again with more garlic and seasonings, it would sure be a convenient recipe to have!

I made this for family. They said they didn't mind but the overpowering taste and smell of oil was too much for me. Couldn't eat it. Reduce oil to half or less the amount.

Awesome recipe... But I wish I listened to other reviewers and decreased the amount of water and oil... I did simmwr it for 5 min on the stove... But I had to add another 6 oz can of tomato paste to thicken it up. But now that I found this recipe I will never have to spend $8+ on organic pizza sauce! I can make my own.

Our favorite pizza sauce.  I like to add a bit of sugar (about 1 Tablespoon), just for a slight touch of sweetness.  So easy, and make it the day before...it needs some time for the flavors to blend.

I used a microplane for the garlic, so one clove was plenty. Like many others, I used far less water and oil than the recipe calls for. I also added a sprinkle of sugar and a splash of vinegar. And I omitted the rosemary, using a few fennel seeds instead.

I didn't read the reviews that advised to cut the water before I made it so I just simmered it to reduce the liquid.
I also used fresh herbs as that is what I had on hand.
Easy and so economical compared to commercial canned sauces

Loved the flavor, but had to do some quick rescue work because I didn't see the comments about the water amount. Can the ingredients list of this recipe be modified to help others avoid near disaster?

Thank you for the recipe. It was nice to get rid of some tomato paste and now I have a solid base for making my own sauces. However, I think if I had followed the portions exactly, it would have been too watery for a pizza sauce. 

I made the following modifications:
1. I reduced the water to about 3/4 cup
2. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup
3. I combined everything in a sauce pan and heated it up for about 15 minutes
4. I added thyme and sugar to suit my tastes.

Thanks again!

Quick and easy, yes, but it needs more complexity. As written, it is much too watery. This was by far the thinnest sauce I've ever put on a pizza. After letting it sit for 4 hours, I found it much too acidic, so added 2 tsp brown sugar, which helped to mellow it and added another layer of flavor. I still prefer Exquisite Pizza Sauce, which takes only slightly more work, but tastes worlds better.

I made some today, basically I did the taste method when adding the ingredients, I added a little sugar and also some parm cheese and I must say everyone loved it. I didn't have time to let it sit, so I decided to bring to boil and simmer for about an hour. The sauce looks so rich and the only thing I would do different, is using a little less oil.

This was my first time making a pizza sauce. I was in a rush and didn't read the comments ahead of time. The flavor combination is fine but my sauce came out too watery. As long as you make adjustments for that you'll be fine.

I had been looking for an easy homemade sauce to go with my homemade pizza doughs and this one is a winner. It's simple and quick. I found it a little too watery and that was even after i left out the extra half cup of water. I also left out the rosemary since i never have any on hand. Next time, i will cut it down to 3/4 cup water and 1 garlic clove.. too potent with the two but otherwise this was absolutely delicious and such a nice compliment to my from scratch pizzas. My boyfriend and i couldn't shut up about it while we were eating!

Followed the recipe to the letter, but lessened the liquids as other sugested.So I let it sit in my fridge for 2 days, thinking that the flavors needed time to meld. I tried it again, and if anything, it was even worse! NEVER MAKING THIS AGAIN!

This sauce is pretty good, but I made two minor changes. I have a habit of adding citrus juices to anything heavy on tomatoe, as it slightly alters the flavor, so take out about half a cup of water, and add half a cup of orange juice, or another citrus juice. Then, after mixing it all, let it simmer for about an hour. Delicious

This is a good sauce. Very simple too. I added a pinch of sugar because I like a sweeter sauce.  Make sure to let all the spices steep for a couple hours or you can simmer it on the stove.

I really like this sauce!  I always have enough for 4 pizzas or more.  I keep the extra sauce in a tupperware in the frige.  I think the flavors mix better and it's delicious time after time!  Thanks.

I've been making this sauce for quite some time and it always turns out (I make it the day before, tastes amazing 24 hours later).  I use Italian Seasoning in place of the Rosemary.  It freezes nicely as well so I double the recipe for this reason.  Thanks for sharing!

I was making pizza for dinner tonight.  When I took the crust out of the oven, I realized I didn't have any pizza sauce.  So I searched for an easy pizza sauce recipe and found this one that I had all the ingredients for.  I mixed up everything and then tasted it to make sure it tasted okay.  Well, it tasted totally nasty.  I decided to add a packet of sweetener to it.  That only helped a little.  I panicked because I was already late getting dinner on the table, and figured, 'well, I'll just put it on the pizza.  Maybe it will taste better once it cooks.'  Well, I was right.  Once the pizza came out of the oven, every person in my family scarfed it down and asked for seconds.  So in the end, it turned out well.  Next time I might make a few adjustments to the recipe, and definitely add some sweetener.  I just do not recommend tasting the sauce before you cook it.

My go to pizza sauce. Easy and great. Really blends and mellows when it sits for a while. Don't be afraid of lots of herbs/garlic, and I also add a pinch of sugar which really balances the flavor

Great sauce, my family loved it.  I followed advice of some other reviews and used only 1 cup water and added about a teaspoon of sugar. I used it right after making it and it was wonderful without standing.

Everything was great except for the amount of water.  I wish the author could edit the recipe for those of who get in a hurry and don't read the reviews!  I simmered mine sauce for a while to reduce it.

Awesome!  I mix this up 1st so it can sit awhile, using more garlic, only 1 cup of water (thicker) and skipping the rosemary (not our favorite).  Usually have extra sauce which I freeze for the next time. The kids love to make individual pizzas so everyone loves what they have, plus they make cute faces. :)  Use along with Pizza Dough I.

As written, I thought this tasted pretty much just like tomato paste.  Following advice of other reviewers, I used only 1 cup of water, so the consistency was just about perfect.  Just added additional oregano, basil, garlic powder, and a splash of red wine, and it turned out quite well.  Luv the fact that there's no cooking.

Great easy recipe! If creative try 1/2c red Italian or Zinfindel wine, 1/2c water and 1/4c EVO.  Puree onion, garlic, gr. pepper, plus spices as indicated and saute in butter. Add remainder & simmer...not as easy, but interesting.  For a more Mediterranian taste, add 1 tsp smoked oyster liquid. For me, the smoked oysters and fresh tomatoes go on 1/2 the pizza...finish wine with pizza  :)

The only thing I did differently I used about 4-5 tablespoons of olive oil, sautéed minced garlic (2 cloves) and finely chopped white onion (2 slices) for about 5 mins. I did not have a few hours to spare while it sat (like the recipe calls for). So I put the tomato paste in a non-stick frying pan and added water until it was at a consistency I liked and added the rest of the ingredients (including the sautéed onion and garlic) and brought it to a boil and let it simmer for about 30 mins I ended up adding more water occasionally because the longer i let it simmer the thicker the sauce gets. Very Yummy!

LOVE this!!! Now that we've been eating more healthy, this hits the spot! I Let it sit overnight in fridge, stirred right before smoothing over a whole grain wrap, add veggies, low-fat mozzerela and baked at 350ish for 10 minutes.... My husband LOVES it too! Reminds me of the home made pizza sauce mom and dad made when we were growing up... "Pizza Night at Mar-Dan's!"

Very good. I had left over onion & garlic sauce which I wanted to use up. DH is a pizza finatic and was insisted on making our own. I compromised and let him. We followed this as is but added 1tbs of sugar because we found it pretty acidic. Saving and making again and again!!!!!!

I just made this sauce.  It tastes just like the pizza sauce at our local pizza joint.  I didn't let the sauce simmer and it was still good.  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe.

Loved the spice blend in this sauce, it was perfect for me & my husband!  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand and so I used tomato puree instead, leaving out the water & oil.  Because we like our sauces a bit on the sweeter side I added a tablespoon of honey.  This sauce is the only one I'll use from now on!

This is great sauce.  I added a bit of sugar like other reviewers recommended. I also didn't have all the exact ingredients in the house, so I used some Italian Seasoning as well.  It has turned out great the two times I've made it. I usually don't like pizza with too much sauce on it, and I put more than normal on my pizza and still loved it!

The taste was decent - a little oily even with just 3 T oil.  The best part about it is how easy it is!

Only the 2nd recipe that I've commented on. This was so good,it was hard to wait for the crust to be ready. I added 1 tsp of sugar for sweetness, and decreased the water to 1 cup. I used 1/2 of it for one pizza and froze the rest in a ziplock for the next.

I used Whole Foods organic tomato paste and...yum! Great fresh flavor with a nice blend of herbs. I agree that a little less olive oil wouldn't hurt. I did sauté the garlic in a little bit of olive oil until the aroma was released and then I added the ingredients directly to the same pot to heat through before spreading on crust. Topped with organic mozzarella, arugula, gorgonzola and grated parmesan. A big hit with my husband.

Very good, easy sauce.  I had not tomato paste so used 2 8-oz. cans tomato sauce and reduced water to less than 1/2 cup, added spices and it turned out great!  So glad to have this as I don't keep pizza sauce on hand normally.  Thanks.

thats a cool recipe ! I cut down the water to 1 cup and since I don't eat garlic I left that one out and added a good dash of Paprika. I made it the day before and the flavor developed nicely. I made my first ever pizza with it and needless to say it was a raving success! Keep the leftover of the sauce for spreading on tomato & cheese toast and will try it out on my next pasta dish. Thanks, this recipe saves a lot of time and tastes delicious.

Last night, we decided on some quick, cheap pizza. We used ciabatta rolls from the freezer, this sauce and whatever topping lying around (olives, ham, fresh tomatoes, squash, onions, etc.) and made a create your own. OMG! This sauce was superb! I did cook the sauce on the stovetop to speed the flavor melding up a bit. It is definitely something I will make the morning of from now on, and actually plan a pizza night. It was so much fun and my kids loved getting the toppings they wanted. So did I, a mom can only handle so many pepperoni and olives pizzas before she loses it!

I liked this for a pizza sauce to make home made pizza with.  It turned out great.  I think I added a pinch of sugar, and left out the rosemary b/c I didn't have any on hand.  I did like other users, I decreased the water ratio to 3/4 C  it made plent of sauce of a large pizza.  Over all, very good, will use again.

i use only half a can of tomato paste but still its too sour for my liking, maybe its the brand of the paste. I omitted basil as i don't have it. nevertheless they taste good. i simmer it for a while to get a thicker sauce.

I did as other reviewers suggested and only used 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup of olive oil and the consistency came out nicely.  I also used 1 Tbsp of Italian Seasoning instead of the oregano, basil and rosemary just because of my budget.  But the reason that I only give this 3 stars is the oddly sweet taste.  I think it would have been great if I had used tomato sauce instead of the tomato paste.

Very tasty sauce and so simple to make. I took the advice of previous reviewer and cut the water to 1 cup and the olive oil to 3 tablespoons and it was so flavorful and the perfect consistancy. This sauce definately does need to sit for a few hours to get the full flavor, so make it the night before and it will be great!! Thanks for the great sauce!!

Normally I don't like to review on a recipe that I have made alterations to but I thought the small change I made wouldn't have affected the final outcome too much..... I used this recipe as a starting point when I didn't have pizza sauce on hand.  I used Contadina tomato sauce instead of the water and tomato paste and did not use the oil, mostly to make it nonfat.  The rest of the recipe I used as written.  This made a very good sauce. I used this to prepare my pizza pasta bake.  Quick, delicious, and oh so easy.  I don't think I will buy pizza sauce again. This had so much more flavor than store bought pizza sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow - what a great quick, easy, simple, and delicious pizza sauce.  I will never purchase pizza sauce from the store again!!! I did follow the other reviews and used 1 cup of water.  I used little to no garlic (personal preference) but my husband would double it if he had his way.  Strongly recommend this recipe.

I used half the water and my sauce was still very thin. Next time I will only use about a cup or so of water. Very tasty though and you have enough for about two pizzas.

We used this sauce with "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" from this site. I could hardly believe how easy this recipe was to make. I put 1 1/4 cups of water instead of 1 1/2, and it was perfect. I didn't have any rosemary though, but the sauce was great. My adult son loves pizza sauce, so he was my critic, and all he could do was rave about how great the sauce tasted.  I'm thinking about using this recipe with spaghetti next time.

Yum!  I could just eat the sauce by itself.  I added extra spices and garlic and used less water and oil.  Perfect with these changes!

this was pretty good. I added a little Splenda and cooked it on low for about 10 minutes. I let it sit on the stove for about an hour before making the pizzas.

I felt this sauce had too much flavor, I didn't realize that was possible.  I would've given it 2 stars, but my friend liked it.  I think I'll use this recipe again as a base for making a sauce that better suits my tastebuds.

Sorry, I didn't care for the taste at all.  It didn't even make it to the pizza crust. I made it exactly as stated and was really disappointed. I will keep looking for another sauce recipe.

This sauce turned out great. I did take others advice and used only 1 cup of water, and 1/4 cup of oil.

Great flavor, super easy, and darn inexpensive!  I did adjust the water to 3/4 cup and the oil to 1/4 cup to adjust to my personal preferance of a thicker sauce.  Unfortunately I used a store brand envelope of pizza crust that you just add water and stir. The sauce out classed the crust so much it was like wearing pearls with flip flops!

I decided to play it crazy and doubled the garlic on the recipe.  Whoo-boy!  Tasted great, but couldn't talk to other people for 24 for fear they'd keel over.  Great recipe, thanks!

I used 2 cans tomato paste, one with oregano and garlic mixed in, added 1 1/2 cups water, 1/3 oil, and the spices and garlic.  I simmered it on low for about 2 hours while the crust (Jay's pizza crust on this site: wonderful!!) was rising.  The sauce reminded me of spaghetti sauce, so will try something different next time.

I took other reviewers advice and reduced the water to one cup but kept the oil the same. I also didn't add salt but kept everything else the same. I made this first thing in the morning so it was standing for about 11 hours. Great on top of Jay's Signature Pizza Crust. Will use again. Thanks

Wasn't too thrilled with this at first, then took the time to do the recipe as written, absolutely love it!!  I use this recipe all of the time.  It's better if you do let it sit for a while.  I didn't have time at first so just boiled it and added flour for thickness.   Love, love, love this sauce!!!!!!

I used an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce and just a little water - along with the tomato paste. I also added about 1/2 tsp sugar and a tiny bit of lemon juice. It worked well (it was the first pizza I've made since college)and tasted fine - maybe just a little bland. One great thing about a simple sauce like this - it's perfect for experimenting!

This IS  a really good sauce! The first time I made it I followed the ingredients, but the next time I did use a little less water. I also was low on one or two of the spices so I used a tablespoon of pre-mixed Italian seasoning. It turned out just as good!

Awesome!!  I'm not a fan of Rosemary so i omitted that.  I took the advice of a previous review and cut the water to 2/3 and only 2 tbsp olive oil.  Turned out perfect for dipping Mozzarella sticks!

I didn’t read the other reviews before I made this. It is a very runny sauce but it thickened up a little overnight in the fridge.

Read other's reviews about recipe edits! This would be really good if taking the water way down and adding some sweetness... Water should be 1/4-1/3C and slowly add more as desired. I also added 1/2T of sugar. 

I spent 45 minutes simmering down the water content. The oil never fully mixed in. I would think adding vinegar or ketchup would help as an emulsifier.

Overall if you only have tomato paste as I did and not any other tomato product this would work as a sauce, just going expect great results as the recipe stands.

This is a very good sauce, but again, everyone’s taste buds are different. I adjusted the water as well, it was going to be runny if I didn’t, 2/3 cups was plenty, I also doubled the amount of salt and pepper (more pepper than salt - 20 grinds of pink salt and 30 grinds of pepper). Just waiting to put it on pizza, but aroma filled the house and very easy to make!

This could use less water and MORE seasoning! But I love flavorful sauces. Extra sugar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, crushed red pepper flakes and a teaspoon or two of italian seasoning doctored it up.

I am only giving it three stars because I had to tweak it quite a bit. As others suggested I cut the water in half, I'm so glad I did because it would have been super runny. I also reduced the olive oil to 1/4 a cup and added an extra garlic clove. Then, I threw it all in a blender which worked really well. After all these adjustments I can say that my whole family really enjoyed the sauce, my husband especially  :)

This recipe makes a very nice pizza sauce that's really easy too.  I reduce the water a bit and add a bit of brown sugar in there for a bit of sweetness.  I usually make this and use it shortly afterwards but this last time I didn't use the sauce until about a day and half later.  Oh my goodness is it SO delicious after it sits for a while in the fridge!  My husband has gone on and on about it ever since, saying it's the best pizza sauce he's ever had.  So a word to the wise, this recipe is even 10 times better a day later!

I will try again with less water.  I think it's too thin.  I'm going to try heating it for awhile to blend flavors better and hopefully let it thicken.

Love this recipe! Cut the water in half and doubled all other ingredients except for olive oil. Highly recommend. Saving this recipe for future reference!   If you like a lot of thick sauce on your pizza, this is the recipe to try!

Good sauce. I didn't have tomato sauce only paste, so this was perfect. I used only 1 cup water and added little sugar.

It was much too runny for my taste. I would change two things. I would only use a half cup of water, 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil.
I ended up simmering mine to reduce the liquid.

The taste is amazing! I'll never buy pre-made sauce again. I did change the liquid amounts to 2/3 cup of water and 1/4 cup olive oil and that was perfect. Also substituted garlic powder for the cloves.

This sauce is amazing just as it is.  don't use less water, when the sauce mixes with the cheese it is perfect. This is a keeper we will be making it again and again.

My father always made this sauce with beer instead of water.  I like Budweiser beer for this sauce.  It adds just a touch of flavor.  I think it helps mellow out the acidic  tang of the tomato paste and adds just a bit of sweetness to the flavor.  I use the olive oil as noted in the recipe and stir in the beer last  to get the sauce to the right viscosity.  

It's going to firm up in the refrigerator, so you'll need to add enough beer so that's it's saucy when you put it in.  It will be more like a paste when you take it out.  It really should sit for a day to set up, but I have found that a minimum of 6 hours in the refrigerator will get the  sauce  to a reasonable flavor level.  Time is always your friend with tomato/garlic combinations.

Not bad for a such quick pizza sauce !
I cut the water by half and added coupe of pinches of sugar.
Half the recipe is plenty to cover a medium to large pizza.

Great flavor! Used it on my New York style. This covered 4 standard size pizzas. I'm not a pizza expert, but 2 of 2 people have loved it so far. About to make pizza for a get together this weekend and am sticking with this recipe!

I eyeball this recipe.  I make it in a pint-size mason jar.  Add the tomato paste, basil, oregano, garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper to taste and add water to about where the jar starts to curve.  Put the lid on the jar and shake everything up!  I don't even let it sit, I just use it immediately and if there's leftovers, they are already in a container ready for the fridge.  Now I never worry about buying pizza sauce!

I didnt have time to let it sit, so i simmered for 30 mins, and ended up adding a 1.5 tablespoon sugar, thought the sauce was missing something, and the sugar made it to my taste. Spices were on point! Will make again.

I have to agree with the amount of water. I followed the recipe, but added another can of tomato paste and adjusted the amount of dried spices according to taste. I also minced five cloves of garlic.  Can't wait for homemade pizza for dinner tonight!

I always use this recipe when I make pizza at home! the only things I do differently is I start with a can of Tomato Sauce instead of adding water to tomato paste, and I don't like rosemary so that is omitted. I freeze the leftovers in little Tupperware which is perfect for a quick pizza for lunch on naan =)

This turned out fine in a pinch. I needed a sauce right away. I read the reviews and so I only put in 1 c water and 1/4 c oil. I thought the consistency was perfect with those amounts. I used 1/2 t garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I kept all other ingredients the same. I didn't have time to let it sit, and it turned out well on the pizza. My son ate it up with no complaints. I will probably make my own pizza sauce again, but take a look at some different recipes or tweak this one some more.

This sauce made me a star!! Well this sauce and some little tweaks did it. My family and guests raved about the pizza and especially the sauce. No more going out for pizza for us. I reduced the water until the thickness was to my liking and dropped the oil down a bit. I then added about 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder (maybe a little less)!and a dash of McCormick chili powder. I use whole dry spices and grind them myself with a small mortar and pestle but that's my preference. I let it all sit on the counter for about 4 hours. Awesome!

I followed the recommendations of the others and cut the water down to 1 cup and the oil to 1/4 cup. Next time I will reduce the oil a bit more. I simmered the sauce on the stove for about 30 minutes and the oil rose to the surface. I ended up draining off some oil so I will reduce it further next time.

Used 6 oz of water (filled tomato paste can) instead of listed amount. This is a good recipe that I've used many times...although I feel like something is missing from it.  Maybe I will add more garlic next time.

Love this recipe. I cut down the water, as others have mentioned, and let it sit while my pizza dough is rising (about two hours). I am allergic to onions and my boyfriend is a picky eater, so this is a perfect sauce for us. It is easy to adjust to taste, quick and cheap to make.

We liked this sauce. It is super easy and very good.  I just made one pizza so had enough left over to freeze and use on another pizza later.  I cut the water as suggested by some other reviewers to make the sauce a bit thicker... otherwise it would have been to runny for our taste.

Good sauce tried it today for the first time and it was a success . I halved the amount of water added 1 bay leave and instead of rosemary  used thyme and last add 1 tsp of sugar. Will pass this on to my daughters , who's children love home baked Pizza.

After waiting 3 hours I was eating this like a soup!  So much better than any commercial pizza sauce.  I only used 1 cup water and 1 tsp each of basil and oregano; no rosemary at all.  The main thing though to me was combining tomato paste, olive oil and water.  I added 1/2 tsp salt and a small amount of black pepper then tried it and knew right away this would be good.  Use this as a base then season it however you like.  My imagination was stoked as much as my appetite.  I covered the sauce and let it set on the counter for 3 hours.  You could dip hot garlic bread in it or even use it over spaghetti ( I would cut back the oregano maybe for spaghetti).  Thanks for this recipe!

Okay, I should have read the reviews before I made the sauce. WAY too much oil. I think too much water as well, it makes more than one large pizza. The taste is good if you don't drown it in the amount oil the recipe says.

We used this recipe as a great jumping-off point to invent our own pizza sauce.  We've been experimenting for a while and I think this finally helped us make the sauce we like best!

We simply put the tomato paste into a bowl and then mixed in two tablespoons of olive oil.  Add the two cloves garlic, and all the herbs, stir & enjoy.

Definitely don't put in the water or the huge quantity of oil in the original, or you'll end up with running sauce that will ruin your pizza (we used to use watery tomato sauce and botched many a pizza).

This recipe is very good, there's place for making it your own, that's what I like about it, it makes a very good basic. I caramelise 1/2 cup of onions with the olive oil, then I add the garlic cloves, cut in slices. I add a can of whole peeled or diced tomatoes and then I mix the rest in it, I also add a bit of sugar just to break the acid from the tomatoes. Then I blend it a bit, so it stays chunky and you can't see the onions. Delicious, everybody wants more, this is a hit...

this is good and simple. to get what i needed i did decrease the water by 1/2 and added a tsp of sugar to cut the acidity. i needed a thicker pizza sauce for my daughter to have ghetto pizza for lunch this week. ghetto pizza= white bread spread with pizza sauce and topped with parm cheese or mozarella and broiled until the cheese melts. this made enough to fill a small jar and cost half what the already made "pizza quick" costs. impressive and easy.

The sauce is great, but even with the reduced water I think it is still too runny. I recommend using a-lot less oil too. I would make it again, but just tweak it up a little - Kate

The sauce was easy, but not terribly tasty.  It needed some zing, perhaps from sun dried tomatoes or something.  But I made one of the easy crust recipes, which was too bland, and this sauce wasn't enough to overcome the bland crust.  Again, it is an easy sauce, but you really need to find something to add to it, or I think it will be too plain for you, was for me.

Very easy and tastes good. I do not always use the full amount of oil (sometimes I use none) and I add a squirt of honey. You may not need the full amount of water.

Fabulous! This is no doubt the very best homemade pizza sauce ever! I make it in large quantities and vacuum seal in jars to keep in my fridge for use in my homemade pizzas and any recipe calling for pizza sauce! Will NEVER buy a canned or jarred store sauce ever again! This is perfect as is and needs no tweaking. Easy to make and delicious every time! Family loves this one!

Made this for dinner tonight and although not cooked onto pizza yet, tastes wonderful!!  Took the recommendations from others and cut down water to 1 cup and oil down to 1/4 cup.  Consistency is perfect!  I also added a 1/2 tsp of sugar to balance out the acid from the tomatoes.  Can't wait to add it to Ricardo's Pizza Crust!!! YUMMY!!!

Awesome spaghetti sauce. I didn't  have cloves so I used garlic salt. I also add some white sugar to taste, because I don't like the sauce so tart. Next time I'll cut back on the amount of water. (Also, I didn't have time to let it set so used it right away and it still tasted wonderful!)  Thanks for posting.

I just made this sauce and it was fantastic! It wasn't too sweet, though I did take some suggestion from other reviewers and added a little sugar (1t-1T). I also sauteed the garlic and a little leftover white onion in the olive oil before adding the tomato paste and spices. I was all out of basil and I rather liked the sauce without it. This is definitely a keeper!

I doubled the recipe, but kept the oil amount the same. I used 2 1/2 cups of water and tripled the garlic and sauteed it in the olive oil. I added everything together in a pot, brought to a boil, and simmered for 10 minutes. It turned out fantastic.

This is a very good pizza sauce recipe.  It's not over bearing on the pizza or spicy for those of us who just can't eat spicy.  I use 1 batch on an extra large pizza.  1/2 to 3/4 a batch on a reg large pizza, etc.  everyone raves about my pizzas!

Delicious!  I cut back the water to one cup and I used the italian seasoned tomato paste.  Tastes amazing!  I recommend the "master pizza dough" recipe from this site to go with it.

This is a terrific recipe!  It makes my homemade pizza taste just like any of my favorite restaurant pizzas!  Here is what I did a little different:  Cut water down to 1 cup Cut olive oil down to 1/4 cup Added 1-2 T sugar Heated on the stove top at a low-med heat for about 30 - 40 minutes  It is super important to cook and/or let this sit for a while before using it.  It definitely tastes better once the spices have joined together.  Excellent!

I rate this highly because I needed a pizza sauce using only tomato paste (rather than sauce), since that is all I had on hand.  This fit the bill.  Per the reviews, used only 1/2 cup water and just a bit of evoo.  Taste was ok, nothing great, but 4 stars for being exactly what I needed.  Thanks!

Excellent taste and so easy.  I was snowed in and only had tomato paste on hand, so I chose this sauce.  I cut back on the water to 1 cup and everything else as on the recipe.  I didn't have time to let it stand "several hours" so I just simmered it a bit.  I used it on Jay's signature crust for a fantastic totally homemade pizza!

I followed the advice of other members, and only added 1 c. H20. I also trimmed the oregano and basil down a touch, adding 1 tsp of each, as I don't like that strong aftertaste. I also brought it to a boil and simmered about 10 minutes before putting on the dough...amazing flavor!!

I cut back on the water, to one cup... left the olive oil the same, and I'm thinking I should have cut back on that as well.  As another reviewer, I didn't have rosemary, so I subbed Italian Seasoning for all the herbs.  I let this sit for a few hours, and found it to be a little bitter.  I added a packet of Splenda, and now it's too sweet for me, but the kids love it and I'm sure hubby will too.  I'll try again, using half a packet (like one tsp of sugar) next time.

Decreased all of the spices to 1/4 tsp. The olive oil did give it a pizzaria taste so I thought it was great.

I would give this a five star rating, except as it is, I thought the rosemary is a bit over-powering.  So, I decreased the rosemary to 1/4 tsp, and chopped it up with the garlic.  It is a very good recipe for my homemade pizza.  Everyone loves it in my house.

I chose this recipe because it didn't use tomatoes or tomato SAUCE, which I didn't have. Flavor was decent but it was VERY oily(& I halved the evoo). I'll keep looking but glad I tried it-it worked for our lunch today!! Thank you!

As others have mentioned, it definitely needs time for the flavor to develop (I put it in the fridge for at least 24 hours), and I prefer to use 1/2 cup less water. I also thought the basil overpowered the other flavors, so I use about half as much. After making those minor tweaks, I couldn't be happier with this recipe.

The rosemary in this recipe is fantastic.  I can't have pizza sauce now without it.  I have made this with the tomato paste and water and also wit tomato sauce (no water); either way works great for me.

While this was easy and the flavour was good, as written, we found this to be way too oily (it just sat on the top) and way too watery.  I did cut back on the water based on others reviews, but even by doing that, I still needed to play around too much by adding more paste etc. in order to get the consistency right so that it would work well on the crust.  Sorry.

Used this with the "bread machine pizza dough" from this site. Our pizza came out terrific! I only used 1 cup of water though, and I still thought it was too watery for my taste. Will cut down a little more next time. Delish!

I just made this sauce on homemade pizza.  It was WAY to olive oily.  If you love the flavor of olive oil...go for it.  But I wanted the cheese, onions, garlic etc. to be the star, NOT olive oil.  I'll try a different sauce next time that is lower in fat and better tasting.

1st homemade pizza at home!  Kids loved it! Yea!  I paid attention to consistency of sauce, not making it too watery.  It makes enough for about two 12inch pies.  I am going to freeze the rest.  Very easy and will do this again.

Waaaay too runny!!!  Wish I had read the reviews.  Cut back on the water or maybe eliminate it altogether?? Next time I might even consider using 2 cans of tomato paste or adding a little cornstarch to the mixture to thicken it up a bit.

Easy, just like it says, and fast too.  I let it set over night and then used it on Jay's Signature Pizza Crust.  It was a great combination.  Now I keep the sauce on hand in the refrigerator and make flour tortillas pizza's as a quick lunch or snack for the family.

WOW! I just made this for the first time and it has to be the best pizza sauce I ever tasted.  Even better than my favorite pizzeria.  I was not expecting anything because the sauce really didn’t taste good at all when I put it on the pie.  I cut the water down to 3/4 cup as recommended by others.

Quick and simple.  I also cut the water down to 3/4 cup at first to see how thick it was and it was much thicker so I added another 1/4 cup and it was just right.  I will have to try the flour binding recommendation but if you make this sauce in advance, like the night before pizza night, the flavors will be much better.

This sauce is definitely better after it ages a little.  I froze what I didn't use and thought the defrosted sauce was much better than the fresh sauce.  I used less water (1 cup) and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup.  The sauce is an improvement over store bought kinds.

1 1/2 cups of water was too much. And I prefer a sauce with a more cooked tomato flavor. It was better after I cooked and reduced it, but I think I will try a different recipe next time.

I mixed what I had left of the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" with the  "Easy Pizza Sauce I" recipe and it happened to be the best pizza sauce ever. I left out the anchovy paste and the marjoram from the Exquisite Pizza Sauce and the rosemary from the Easy Pizza Sauce I, those where the only modifications that I made. My family was personally very pleased with the results.

Made this sauce with very little water and olive oil as suggested... added a lot more rosemary than called for and it added a superb flavor. This was the best pizza sauce I have ever had! Thanks for the recipe!

this recipe was wonderful.  instead of water i used 1 cup of tomato sauce.  cutting back on the amount made it much thicker.  i also added more basil and a teeny bit of cayenne pepper.  also i only used 1/4 cup of oil.  i might cut back even more next time because the oil taste overpowered the seasonings.  my picky tween and i will be using this as our regular sauce.

My family loved this recipe. It went well with my homemade pizza crust.  I used fresh herbs from my garden and simmered for quite a while to blend the flavors.  Delicious!

This was a really yummy pizza sauce. I did not have tomato sauce on hand so appreciated that this recipe did not call for it. I do think the sauce was very tasty, but a bit oily.  Next time I'll either eliminate the oil or cut it down to a T or 2.  I only used 1/2 c. water and did not add rosemary.  Added 1/2 t. sugar per other reviewer's recommendation.  Very nice.

Good basic recipe.  I added onions and more sugar also some Penzey's pizza seasoning.  Used it the next day baked on top of turkey meatloaf!  Great!

Easy to make!  I only used 1 cup of water and a little less oil.  I also ran out of black pepper so I had to use crushed red pepper.

Really tasty...will be my staple pizza sauce from now on. The only change I will make next time is to reduce the olive oil by half because there was a lot of oil on top of the cooked pizza--now I know why I have to dab off oil when I go to a real pizzaria.  But overalll very tasty!!

Great flavor. I just cut the oil and the water a bit and it came out perfect. Not too spicy, not too sweet. I don't even like a lot of sauce on my pizzas and I completely covered mine in it! Very yummy.

In general, tasty and easy. Had to use 2 tomato paste cans since the original recipe was too thin. Also, a little bit oily, might taste better with half the olive oil.

I used only 9 to 10 oz. of water to my sauce, and I used a can of No Sodium added tomato paste, added a bit of Sugar in the Raw. It was the BEST sauce I have ever made. Used the sauce in Calzones, all made from scratch! Thanks for this recipe.

I've made this 2 times now.  The first time I didn't have time to let it sit, the second time I did.  It definitely is better when letting the herbs mesh with the sauce.  If following this recipe exactly, the sauce ends up too thin in my opinion.  Next time I'd cut the water down to 1 cup.  Maybe even cut down the oil, it is a bit oily.  But very good.  This recipe is easy enough to change to suit your tastes!

The flavor wasn't outstanding, but it was pretty darn good. Plus, I think it would be easy enough to tweak it to suit your own taste. Easy to throw together. Thanks!

Not bad! I took the advice of other reviewers and added only a cup of water and decreased the olive oil. I didn't have all the dried herbs seperate (I was lacking rosemary) so I just did two tablespoons of Italian Seasoning. I also added about 1/4 tsp. of sugar and some onion powder. I haven't let the flavors meld yet, so maybe that will make me think twice about the three stars. Perhaps it gets better!

Very good, fresh taste.  I did find it to be a little oily though.  Will probably try a recipe without the oil next time.

Followed other reviewers' advice and only used 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup olive oil but was still oily and the oil stayed seperated from the rest.  Good taste but will keep looking.

Cheap, easy........what else does one want:). I used slightly lesser water than called for but it was still runny. So, the only thing to be careful of here is the amount of water. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this sauce! I am usually one to not like tomato-based sauces and this was delicous! It baked wonderfully and was excellent on our pizza. We used Jay's Signature Crust from this site -- a mouth-watering combination!!!

Very good.  Cut back on the water by half a cup as suggested.  I didn't have time to let it sit so used immediately after mixing and it tasted great! (I didn't even heat it up.) Not sure how it will taste when I use the sauce tomorrow, but it was great now.  Fiance liked it.

I enjoyed this sauce, but as per others advice, I cut the water back.  I used 2/3 cup and it was about right--I couldn't imagine using the recommended amount, seems like it will be much too watery.

This is my standard pizza sauce recipe. Everyone raves when I tell them I make my own pizza sauce! The only things I do differently is that I add a tsp of brown sugar, use a little less oil and double the dried basil. Perfect every time!

Sauce was good for a first attempt. I also had to cut back on the liquids. I'll add a little something to sweeten it more next time. If you like a strong tomato, leave as is.

Great stuff.  I've made a similar sauce but w/o olive oil - this is better.  I used way less water and didn't measure the oil.  Only had time to let this sit for 45 min., next time I'll make it further ahead.  This sauce would probably freeze well.

This is so much better than store-bought! I followed earlier advice and used 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 1/2 cups. Very easy to make.

It tasted a bit strong and was very acidic.  It was also really thin.  Even still, I couldn't stop myself from liking it.

This is a wonder aromatic pizza sauce. I love that it doesn't have tomato sauce in it at all. The intensity of the tomato paste is wonderful.

This was fabulous!  I didn't change one thing, except I didn't have tomato paste, so I used tomato sauce and left out the water.  We had a pizza party (me and the kids) and they each got to make different kinds of pizza.  They tasted great.  My favorite pizza we made tonight was the vegetarian one (asparagus, marinated artichoke hearts, spinach, onions and mozarella).  I bet this sauce will be great as a marinade too!

I used this quick and easy sauce on a Sunday afternoon when family dropped by unexpectedly.  Five out of five family members agreed that this was a very good sauce.  We enjoyed - - and I have added this one to my personal file!

This is a nice quick recipe for sauce.  We used it to use with calzones.  It was very good!  I was not able to let it sit long enough so it had a little bit of a strange flavor ,but I think it will be better next time.  Thanks

Couldn't ask for a simpler pizza sauce. My daycare kids loved the pizza, they were all drooling waiting for it to come out of the oven.

Great recipe to use in a pinch. 1 1/2 cups of water is way to much. I used 1 cup and was afraid it would be too runny but it came out fine. I would make this recipe again but maybe with a tad more garlic.

This recipe was a big help when I forgot to purchase pizza sauce in a can for another recipe.  It was so easy and tasty that I probably will never buy pizza sauce in a can again.  Try it with the Bread Machine Calzone.  We used it in that recipe and the leftover sauce we used for  for dipping the calzone.

Great pizza sauce!I was hesitant to use the entire sauce recipe on one pizza so I used less and found out it wasn't enough. Next time I will try using the whole batch of sauce.

This sauce is great!  I made it without the rosemary (didn't have any), added an 8 0z. can of tomato sauce, and used only 1 cup of water.  My family said it was better than restaurant pizza.

Very good sauce. Easy to make with a lot of flavor. For a little thicker sauce, I used less water and little less oil.

I made this for my family - it's cheaper 
than store-bought sauce, and although the
garlic can be a litlle overwhelming, it tastes
great!
