I just made this recipe for the first time.  I am an experienced pasta maker, using various machines, rollers etc. This is by far the easiest to handle and has an excellent flavor.  I used a kitchen-aid to mix the dough, but did the final kneading by hand.  I doubled it the first time I used it.  I added 1 tablespoon of olive oil in place of some of the water as well.  After kneading, I covered it in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 15 minutes.  Awesome performance in the rollers, and cutters and a better recipe than the Kitchen-Aid manual which I have always found to be too dry no matter what I do.  This is awesome and now my go to recipe.

I tried this today decreasing the salt to 1/4 tsp. and adding 1 tsp. of olive oil. Most doughs need to rest after being worked so that they will roll out easier and this dough definitely benefitted from resting (to let the gluten relax). 

I doubled the recipe to "play around" and cut fettucine sized strips as well as 1" wide strips. I also cut some wider and tried my hand at a few herb-seasoned ricotta-filled ravioli and then cut some wider still and used that same filling to make some free-form lasagnes. Everything boiled up wonderfully... tender and delicate! Yum! Can't wait to try some of the noodles/pasta in some homemade turkey soup after Thanksgiving!

All I can say, after my first attempt at homemade pasta is you gotta try it! And you DON'T need a pasta machine either! Keep your rolling pin and work surface well-floured, keep a pastry brush handy to brush excess flour off the rolled dough, and keep a stainless steel dough scraper handy just in case you do get a bit of adhering to the work surface.

I have been making homemade pasta for years. If I am going to be serving it the same day, I use cake flour. If I am going to dry it and store it, I add a Â½ cup of semolina flour. I also add one or two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. 
This basic recipe is perfect for beginners to the world of fresh pasta making. For those who have had a difficult time, keep trying. You will improve with practice. The addition of additional ingredients such as different seasons and herbs lends itself very redily to this recipe. The secret to pasta making is simple. LET IT REST!

I've always heard that there's nothing like fresh pasta, I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how true this was:-)It was fun and felt great making fresh pasta. I felt like one of those professional cooks in a fine restaurant:-)I'm glad I read the other reviewer's tips. I let the dough rest about 45 min. Could've let 30 min., but was busy. I think the extra time resting before rolling made dough more easy to work with. I had no trouble working with it. You don't really need a pasta machine unless you want to make spaghetti or some other pasta, etc. This was great for me since I don't have one, but want to defenately buy one now. I have very limited space to work with, my counter is about the width of a regular stovetop, maybe(sp?) smaller. What I would recommend if you have a small workspace is that when you have let the dough rest, whatever amount of servings you are making, divide the dough into that many parts, and work one at a time. Actually think takes less time this way. Another tip: If rolling, to keep even thickness, don't double roll,etc over one part of the dough then continue on to next part,etc. Roll one way one time over whole piece of dough. If dough creates a roll, simply pick up dough and lay back down and continue. I let the dough dry by leaving it spread on the counter. I used a pizza cutter to cut dough. I will make this again.

Wonderful!!

I doubled the recipe and it was a great smooth dense dough..It was good rolling out and yummy  to eat!
I rolled it out and rolled it up like a jelly roll(with out flouer on it) and cut thin strips to make fettichini and dried the strips on a broom stick covered with a towel being held up between 2 chairs, I let them dry totally and pakaged half the amount for storage and boiled the other half and it was VERY GOOD!! Please try it..So easy, fun and so GOOD!!

Thanks!!

Thanks

My first attempt at homemade pasta and it was so easy! I added about 1/2 Tbl olive oil as it seemed to dry without it. I used the kitchenaide dough attachment to mix it. Then let it sit for 45 minutes. I had wrapped it in wax paper and it stuck to the paper! Scraped it off and rolled it out on the floured kitchen table. After that I realized I should have rolled it on a cutting board, so I picked it up and moved it. Once on the cutting board, I used a pizza cutter to make long thin slices. Pizza cutter worked very well - i had various sizes due to not caring about consistency. (My husband said he liked the thinner ones better.) Then I laid them all out on a floured dinner plate and covered it with wax paper until it was time to cook (2 hours later). I should have kept the pieces more separated as some of them got stuck together. Next time I'll leave them on the cutting board but spread them out more and let them dry that way. It was easy to make with just a rolling pin. We're going to use this recipe as a base to make homemade ravioli next!

This was the first time making the pasta from scratch, and I was surprized at how simple it was.  My husband wanted homemade noodles with the homemade chicken soup I made (submitted by Jill), and everyone LOVED it.  We tripled the recipe & added the noodles to the soup, and let them boil for about 15 minuites, and served.  I saved the leftovers, and they tasted even better the second time!!!

We use a pizza cutter to cut the noodles & it works GREAT!!!!!!!!!!

WOW - this was sooooo easy and sooooo good! I had always thought making pasta would be tricky without a pasta maker, but it was really quick and easy and it turned out delicious! I used some olive oil to make the dough easier to work with and I let it sit for about 30 min before cutting it. I will never buy pasta again now that I know how easy it is to make.

Who doesn't love homemade pasta?  This was very simple with the ability to add whatever you want. I added dried basil to the mix and it was very good.  Would also be good with diced up sundried tomatoes.  My first experience with making pasta and it was so fun I plan to do it often!

As a 17-yo, I find myself making "simple" meals... in other words, I live by packaged foods. After a sudden urge, I had the taste for some fresh pasta. I searched through the millions of websites aimlessly until I found this one, that had been rated 4 1/2 stars? It must be good. Simple, quick and BAM... fresh pasta? I'll give it a try.

I followed the directions, with the additions of 1 tsp of olive oil, and less salt (helpful tips from the other reviewers), then I kneaded it for at least 7 minutes until it was smooth; put the dough into a ziplock bag, left to sit for 90 minutes. 

While my dough was relaxing, I made a shockingly wonderful carrot, garlic & feta filling, put that into a ziplock, and popped it into the fridge. As my dough, and filling relaxed.... I opened up a can of tomatoes, and simmered on low.

90 painful minutes later, I rolled out the dough easily, shaped little ovals... stacked two on each other, closed the edges (leaving just a peak open) and filled them with the carrot filling then brushed a little bit of olive oil on top and closed them tightly; boiled for about 5 minutes or until they floated. 

As the ravioli finished cooking, I melted some butter, parsley, and garlic in a large skillet, once melted and bubbly, I dropped the ravioli into the butter and cooked for about 4 minutes. 

MY MY MY... This may be the best ravioli I've ever had! The dough was perfectly cooked and most importantly, fresh. Served under the tomatoes, It was  wonderful.

Wonderfully simple and delicious! My 13 year old granddaughter and I made this recipe together , after reading all of the reviews. The reviews contain great tips on cutting and drying the pasta as well as cooking it. We doubled the recipe but wish we had tripled it. We did not double the salt though and we added fresh chopped basil to the eggs after mixing them inside the "well". I also added olive oil as needed, to make the dough easier to handle and I omitted the water. I prefer the "jellyroll" method of cutting the pasta into noodles. My granddaughter rolled the dough very thin, picking it up once in a while to make sure it wasn't sticking to the pastry mat. We rolled it up from the long side of the rolled dough, let it sit for 20 minutes, and then cut the dough into quarter inch "pinwheels". We then unfurled each section and hung it over the side of a large colander to dry. To cook: We let a large pot of water come to a rolling boil before we added the noodles. We taste-tested the noodles from time to time to determine doneness. The cooking time was around 12 minutes but this can vary by altitude. We made a wonderful homemade sauce to top the noodles. Yummy!

I started with this recipe with no changes. It was dry and course and wouldn't stick together. Then I added some oil and more water (about 5 Tbl) all together. It finally made a dough ball so I let it rest like some of the other reviews said. It was tough to roll out so I couldn't get the dough thin enough. My noodles turned out way too thick. The taste was fine but overall very disappointing. I will continue to buy pasta at the store.

This is exactly how I make my pasta with the exception that I use a little less salt (flavour comes from the sauce). If you use a small or medium egg, then you will use the water at the end to collect the remaining flour. If you use a large or an extra-large egg, chances are that you won't need to add the additional water at the end. To stay true to the recipe's list of ingredients (ie. without adding any oil), after kneading the dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let the dough rest half an hour before rolling by hand or in the pasta machine. By giving the dough time to rest will help relax the gluten and make the dough a lot more manageable and more pleasant to work with. I usually roll this out for lasagna noodles, spaghetti, linguine, ravioli and tortellini. UPDATE (Sep. 4/12): When you hang the pasta and let it dry for 1-2 hours, it will give it more of a bite (chewier) when it is cooked, as opposed to when it's cooked immediately after it's made, it will have a 'softer' texture.

This is perfect dough.  So elastic and easy to work with, very tender when cooked up.  I was a little shocked to see there was no cooking time listed, but it will vary base on the size of the pasta you cut.  We made fettucini, and it boiled for maybe 4 minutes.  yum!  Very tasty, so much better than dried pasta.  Made it for my dad's birthday, and he couldn't stop eating it.

I loved it!  This is the recipe I'm going to use from now on!  I had to add another egg to compensate for the dry climate in which I live, and I mixed it in my food processor - the dough should be in large crumbles (like a pastry crust), not small ones, and should stick together well when pinched.  If not, add a little moisture at a time until it's right.  Don't knead it if you're going to use a pasta roller/cutter set - the rollers do the kneading for you.  Get it as thin as possible (I went to setting 4 or 5), and then cut it.  I made fettuccini noodles and cooked them for exactly 2 minutes....they were incredible!  Tasty and so tender!  I know it's not the traditional method, but I figure grandma wouldn't have worked as hard as she did if she'd had a good mixer!  :)  Peace, love, and pasta!

This was my first experience making fresh pasta and I am surprised how easy it was.I did triple the recipe but doubled would have been enough for me  and hubby. It turned out perfect. .I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix it ,let it set for 20 minutes rolled out in 3 pieces then refrigerated it til ready to cook.I rolled it through my Kitchen Aid attachment wihile the water was boiling.I will definately be making this again.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making pasta.  After reading reviews, I decided to follow DianeF's advice and decrease the salt from 1/2 tsp to 1/4 tsp and add 1 tsp of olive oil.  It turned out perfectly.  My family loved it!

It worked! We also shredded up some spinach and basil, wrung out all the water from it, and added it to the well when mixing it. You may need a bit more flour in this case. To make pretty pasta without a machine: roller pin your dough out into a circle, let it dry for 30 mins, then roll up the circle into a big cigar and then cut across the roll with a sharp knife. Thinner slices for spaghetti, thicker slices for tagliatelle.

This is a simple recipe to follow for all different types of pasta (doing triple the recipe, I made spaghetti, fettucine and lasagna noodles). I made a few changes for a better dough- since I used medium eggs, I added 1 egg for the triple recipe, along with some olive oil. I worked the dough until it was very smooth and somewhat soft (as my grandmother says "until it feels like a baby's bottom"), then let it sit for an hour for the gluten to break down. After rolling and cutting into pasta, I tossed it in a bit of flour and placed in a tea towel to dry overnight. I've noticed that this drying tends to make the best cooked pasta.

I replace half the water for olive oil for Italian meals, and leave all the water for Asian noodles. I haven't bought any pasta since I found this recipe, it is great, thank you so much!!  I make this all the time now. So easy!!  If it's last minute, I have to quadruple  this for my family of 5, and there are always barely any leftovers. I use my KitchenAid mixer with it's pasta roller attachment, so it's SUPER fast.. I make the dough in the morning, in the evening I get the pot of water on, and roll/cut it all before it's to a full boil..  Otherwise I make 18 servings a week in advance, and wrap it up in the fridge or freezer.  I've added fresh garlic, minced basil or spinach, even minced sun dried tomatoes.. Great for having company over because everyone always OoOoo's and Awwww's over homemade pasta.

My husband and I have started making our own pasta.. and this basic recipe is wonderful.. although you really have to flour the SNOT out of it to keep it from sticking into a huge clump.

I just stuffed my face with this pasta and I can barely move.  It was super quick and easy.  I tossed it with some brocolli and peas with a basic romano cheese sauce. SCRUMPDILLYUMPTIOUS.  Just don't forget to dry it a little while b4 cooking....recipe says nothing to that affect.

Italian Flour 
I use the Caputo Tipo 00 flour from Italy..just adding slightly more flour.
I made these Butternut Squash Ravioli.
Use some Amaretti cookies or the Italian style Lady Fingers cookies to keep your butternut squash from being to watery or runny when filling your ravioli.  Just crumble the with your hands...excellent flavor

This recipe was incredibly easy. This was my first time making pasta. Despite the hilarious mess the two of us made- It really was delicious! I let the dough rest a bit before rolling and placing it through the pasta maker. The attachment in my mixer made it easy. At this point we didn't change a thing. Next time we will try adding herbs.

I have made this for years and won't eat "store bought" pasta anymore.  This is especially wonderful in lasagne where you can customize the pasta size to match your pan.  For noodles, substitute the water with milk and don't kneed the dough.

Great basic recipe! I rolled the dough by hand and cut into fettuccine.  My thickness was a tad off in places, but when I got it right these noodles were DELISH. I served with a simple alfredo sauce and they were a hit with my fiance. I will be making these again! They beat dried pasta any day.

FABULOUS!! This was my first time making homemade pasta and using my Atlas pasta roller my mom gave me.  The dough was a perfect consistency, I did end up using the 2 tablespoons of water.  The noodles are fabulous and it was SO EASY!  The only thing I didn't realize is that it only takes about 3-5 minutes to boil the noodles in boiling water, so just make sure you don't over-cook them!

Happy pasta making:)

This turned out so nice.  I doubled the recipe and added a little oil.  I used a pasta machine to roll out and cut the pasta.  The noodles turned out so delicious!  It was nice and soft and easy to put through the pasta roller.

Quick, basic and delicious- so i'm told... I'm a low-carber but i love to cook even if i don't always get to eat it. This recipe (without alterations) was enthusiastically rated *very good* by the rest of my family. I found it very easy to work with and uncomplicated.  I did let it rest on the counter in clingwrap for about an hour or so before rolling it. I had no trouble with running it through my hand-crank Atlas. I will make this again, soon.  Thank you.

I thought homemade pasta was for Italian grandmas and people with fancy pasta machines...until now! I have no machine, no fancy rollers, no stand mixer and no previous experience making pasta, and this turned out AMAZING. I followed other reviewers' examples and let the dough rest for about half an hour after kneading (turns out kneading by hand is a good stress reliever!), then rolled it out thick with a plain old wooden rolling pin and cut into big squares with a pizza roller for chicken pot pie. It was so good I had to call my mom and brag!

i used this recipe for a slightly unusual purpose but it was so wonderful i had to comment.  i triple the recipe and use it as a crust for an italian ricotta cheesecake.  the ends are crispy and the rest is slightly chewy and dense and just like i remember my grandmothers.  it's not your typical crust but for an authentic italian cheesepie, this is a great pasta base to use.  just roll out to fit a 9" pan and bake with the filling.  tripling the recipe yields 2 pies. thanks so much!!!!

I had great success with this recipe.  I added some basil and cracked pepper to the dough while mixing in my Kitchenaid.  The dough rolled out nicely after resting for 20 min or so.  I doubled the recipe so I had to roll it out on my dining table to get it thin enough.  To cut, I roll the dough up and cut with a sharp knife. This method redults in even size noodles, esp if you trim the dough edges before rolling and cutting.  Overall a great recipe worth trying!

A great basic pasta recipe.  If you're making fresh pasta for the first time, USE THIS RECIPE.  Like previous reviewers noted, letting the dough rest is so helpful.  Wrap it in plastic or cover it with a towel and give it a few hours (or a day or more) and it is so much easier to work with.  If it tears apart or is too stiff to roll, add a couple of tablespoons of water and let it rest some more.  The flavor is perfect.  Add or reduce salt as desired.  Personally, I prefer to leave the salt out and just liberally salt the water.  I have used this recipe for thick noodles, thin spaghetti, and lasagna.  I've worked it both by hand and with a mixer with fine results.  I've rolled and cut it both by hand and with a pasta machine and both were fine.  It's really ideal and foolproof.  Try it!

Thanks for this simple yet delicious recipe. The recipe amount was perfect for our family of three. I let the dough rest for 20 minutes as others suggested, and cut into thin strips after rolling out. I think I will invest in a pasta roller! Also, make sure to let the pasta dry for 15-20 minutes - hanging if you can. When you boil it, add a bit of oil to the water to prevent boiling over, as fresh pasta is more likely to do this. For spaghetti size pasta, boil for 5 minutes for al dente. I will make again!

Excellent!! I doubled the recipe, added some olive oil as others suggested and let it rest after kneading, which softened it up quite a bit. Dividing it in two or three before rolling it out worked best. I made fettucine and let the strips dry for half an hour. This was way better than store bought fettucine. I will definitely make this again.

This is the first attempt at pasta making for me.
I used the recipe with veggie oil and the pasta came out perfectly. I made linguine and spaghetti on a hand operated machine. It took about a half hour from start to finish.

Very simple recipe and easy technique that turns out excellent pasta.  You should definitely add the olive oil as suggested in other reviews, and allow it to rest for at least 15 minutes before putting it through your pasta machine.  I added dried basil and garlic powder and the pasta was fantastic.  Try this recpe, and you will be glad you did!

I chose this recipe because of the many stars from so many reviews.  Thank you all!  I tried this last week - my first try at making pasta and everyone in my family loved it!  It's really simple.  I added Italian seasoning in the flour for added flavor and used more olive oil.  I also covered the pasta with water and let it boil for less than 10 mins (stirring it often) before adding it to the rest of the food.

I used 1/2 ap flour and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour.  Added a tbs of olive oil to the water.  It rolled out great...  I used a pasta machinw to make spagetti.  It was not dry.  Easy to work with.  I'll make it again.

I have used a similar recipe for years, and love it.  I use a half eggshell of water for each egg, and use self-rising flour, with no added salt.  I also cut mine with scissors.

This was super simple to make.  I made mine into ravioli and had the same trouble as some others w/out past machines...getting it thin enough!  I'm looking forward to trying this again as another pasta type.

I was another first time pasta maker and this one came out great. My daughter and I made it into cheese and pepperoni ravioli and a small batch of strip noodles. It was cooked about 4-5 minutes although I think a minute or two longer might have been better for my taste; my son thought it was perfectly firm and chewy. I used about 1/2 Tbsp of canola oil (that's all that I had on hand) in addition to the stated ingredients. The dough was mixed in my Kitchenaid (with the flat beater) but kneading was done by hand for about 4 minutes. I expected it to become totally smooth but mine didn't seem to get as smooth as I expected. The recipe was doubled and wrapped loosely in plastic wrap to rest for about 25 minutes. I agree that a REST IS IMPORTANT! If I had tried to roll it out as soon as I was done kneading, I doubt I would have tried making this again as it was not very elastic. After the rest, it was AWESOME and beautifully smooth and easy to work with. I didn't use too much flour, started rolling with a fondant roller and ended with a wooden rolling pin because it was bigger/wider. I will definitely be looking to invest in a pasta attachment for the KA mixer. We WILL be making this again for sure, perhaps adding some herbs and perhaps trying out a whole wheat version.

Just made this as a simple saturday night dish for me and the hubby. Followed the recipe exactly...just had to add a little extra water. Rested dough for abt 45mins....and hand rolled using lots of flour so it was quite easy to get dough very very thin. Made raviolli with it..came out absolutely perfect. Its my first time making pasta and I'm so proud of myself...this recipe is great...dont need the store bought stuff anymore!!!

Great recipe.  Nice and simple, the way I like it.  I definately liked using a little virgin oil like several reviewers suggested. I made a double batch and used it to make a shrimp alfredo.

Awesome!!!!  My first time making this and it turned out awesome.  I used 1/2 ap flour and 1/2 durum flour.  I also added a smidge more water and used evoo in place of 1/2 the water.  I have to admit when I was kneading the dough, it didn't feel like I was hoping it would.  It was a bit coarse (due to the durum flour) and hard to knead.  (so I made a backup batch just using ap flour)  I let the doughs rest for @ 1/2 hour, and used my pasta maker.  Both doughs were great!!!!!!! I actually preferred the durum pasta (with alfredo sauce) but the pasta made with ap flour would be great in soup.

I've used this recipe since my grandmother taught me to cook many decades ago.  The only change I've made in all of those years is to replace the regular flour with white whole wheat flour.  Same great noodles and thanks to my Atlas pasta machine I can whip up a huge batch in no time at all!!  Make extras, allow to dry for several hours, place in a freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 month.

This was a really recipe to do. My first time making home-made pasta. I made ravioli. Rolling out the dough took some time. I used a glass to cut the dough, then placed my filling in the middle, folded in half and sealed with a fork. I will for sure be making this again!

I tripled this recipe and am glad that I did!  I used my kitchen aide to make fettucini noodles and also let the dough rest about an hour before rolling out.  Remember to use extra flour as you roll the dough out so that the pasta does not get sticky.  I also let the pasta dry about 1 hr before cooking

The pasta dough was hard to get thin enough to be consumable. Perhaps if I had a pasta machine this would have been a better recipie. My pasta came out hard and chewy after I spent over an hour working it.

I found this a very easy recipe to follow with great results.

As an opinion statement fresh pasta may not be the work it takes to make but it was very good and is not a reflection on the recipe more on the process.

The measurements of this recipe are foolproof and the steps given are the same I have learned through my chef.
I used 2 eggs,2C of flour(chefs and bakers AP),1 tsp salt,and 3-4 tbs water to make fettuccine noodles for a soup .
Dough was so easy to work with that I even tossed the dough like a pizza after rolling it out and had no tears.
* Let dough rest a room temperature before rolling for flexibility. Also roll thin or face ridiculously thick noodles.

This recipe is so easy.  This was my 1st time making pasta at home and it came out great. I agree w/ The other reviews about dough needing to rest. I separated the dough in two. The 1st piece sat for 15 mins was pretty easy to roll out. The 2nd sat for over 30 min and I def notice a difference once the rolling pin Hit it. I will be making this again and again till I perfect it. Thanks!

Very tasty, will definitely make again and again.  I'm excited to try out other flavors, particularly whole wheat pasta, since that's about all we ever eat.  My only problems were that this dough was VERY hard to roll extremely thin, which is needed for ravioli.  Yes, I let it rest, and it definitely helped, but it was still very difficult.  Whole wheat would make this even harder.  (Um, hubby... can I have a pasta roller?)  The only other thing is that this is a teeny recipe.  I doubled it originally and cannot POSSIBLY see how a double recipe would feed six.  I rolled as thin as possible by hand and got maybe 12-15 large ravioli out of a double recipe.  I had to mix up another double (and I should have tripled it!) batch quickly to use up the rest of my ravioli filling.  Perhaps as spaghetti or some other shape this stretches farther, but as ravioli I would probably quadruple or even quintuple the batch from the get-go.

Great recipe for a beginner like me!  I made a few changes previously suggested.  I used a 1/2 tsp of garlic salt (instead of salt), 1/2 tsp of basil, 1 T olive oil, and 1 T of water.  Tossed with a creamy lemon butter sauce.  Delish!

This was so easy to make!  It tastes so good too!  I highly recommend using some kind of machine (bread maker on the dough cycle) to knead the pasta dough.  I added garlic salt to mine to add flavor.

made this with 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 c white flour and it turned out great. I did need 3T extra water (after the egg) to bring the dough together, maybe the whole wheat flour made it more dry.

My husband made these for our stir fry. He cut them thick and they were very tasty. He did make some changes. He added 3 more tbs of water, 1 tbs olive oil, and 1 tsp of salt.

Very good and light if made with a pasta maker!  Everyone loved it.  I did have to add a bit more liquid than stated though.  Easy to work with and turned out pretty well.

This pasta is amazing -- so much better than dried store-bought. The only problem I had was trying to deal with all the strips once I had them cut. I didn't want to put them directly into the water, because then they wouldn't cook evenly, so I ended up stealing the shower rod from my bathroom, cleaning it well, and putting it between two chairs in my kitchen. I hung the pasta over that and let it dry for a few minutes while I cut the rest (and a bit after that, too -- another 10 minutes or so, turning them over half way, really helps with the problem of the noodles sticking together). Definitely a bit of work, but totally worth it if you have the time.

I've made this twice - noodles and ravioli. I was very pleased with the results. I did have to add some extra liquid but otherwise went by the recipe. I will definitely be making this many times in the future.

I love homemade pasta but have been searching for just the right kind of pasta I want to add to my Italian Wedding Soup to kick it up a notch..this did it!! I made the dough substituting olive oil for some of the water and then refrigerated it until it was nice and cold. I took it out of the fridge and used a normal cheese grater to make little dough crumbs so to speak and boiled them up before adding them to my soup...wow, what a difference it made and I get tons of requests to make my soup now..almost too many LOL!!

My first time making pasta and it came out great.  I doubled the recipe and after reading others reviews replaced half the water with extra virgin olive oil.  This was sooooo easy.  I used my new pasta machine to roll out and cut.  No more boxed pasta for my family.  We all loved this and I had a great time making it with my daughter.

Would give 10 stars if I could.  I followed the ingredients exactly using my food processor.  Put dry ingredients in processor, turned it on, and added beaten egg and water slowly till ball formed.  Rolled out dough thin, rolled up like a jelly roll, and cut thin strips.  They are hanging to dry now but I boiled some of it for about 6 minutes and added mascarpone and colby cheese for a quick 'mac and cheese."  I will try my very hardest not to buy the 'dry' pasta anymore.  LOVED IT!!!!!!

Several of the recipes for noodles on this site are basically the same, but tried this one 2 times now.  Use 1 egg per cup of flour with some salt and milk.  I use my stand mixer with the dough hook, then let the dough rest in the refrigerator.  Onl problem is rolling them out thin enough.  If you don't have one of those pasta machines, I find it very difficult to get them thin enough.  Even after drying the noodles tend to get thicker when boiled in water, so plan accordingly.  Tastes good, just not thin enough for our taste.

I didn't actually get to use this because I don't have a pasta machine or roller. I would highly recommend using a roller or machine, otherwise it can be nearly IMPOSSIBLE to roll the dough out thin enough. Otherwise, I'm sure this would taste lovely- this is the basic recipe my grandmother uses all the time.

This is a great recipe!  Thank you for sharing.  I watched my grandmother make pasta, but she never measured anything so there is no recipe written down.  This tastes a lot like grandma's pasta.  Quick, easy and tastes great too!

Great recipe. I usually quadruple it and make a combination of fettucine and egg noodles.  I have the pasta attachments for my KitchenAid mixer and this is a snap.  I haven't bought boxed pasta in months since learning how to make it fresh!

I am never making this again!  The dough was so stiff that it was so hard to roll.  It was impossible to roll out the dough until it's really thin...unless you have a pasta making.  It did not taste good when cooked.

This was really good. I doubled the recipe and I used a pasta maker. You have to be very patient with the dough, it has to be stiff. As recommended by other I let it sit for about 1 hour before running it through the pasta maker.

I'll be honest - I'm not sure what it was but the texture just seemed off. I make pasta a lot and love trying new recipes but I am not sure on this. I have read other reviews that state they dried it so I may try that. Flavor was good though.

Very easy! I do not have the proper machinery to thin out dough and cut... I have a kitchen-aide mixer so the dough was a success, I rolled and cut thin noodles with a large pizza cutter. It was easy breezy. Think I will go ahead and invest in the pasta hook up for my mixer. All of the needed equipment was why it got a 4, but the noodles were beautiful and tasted great!

A great, easy, fun recipe that works great for thicker pastas like linguine or fettuccine. Spaghetti was a bit too ramen-esque, though it may have been that I didn't knead the dough enough the first time. I kneaded the dough for about 5-7 minutes the 2nd time making this recipe and it was chewy and delicious! A definite hit.

This turned out awesome! I'm making another batch tonight. It's fantastic. Though the olive oil that other's have mentioned does help it a lot.

This recipe was a great basic pasta recipe.  I think I would reduce the amount of salt next time and I added about a tablespoon of oil, maybe a little more, in order to make it pliable.  Without the oil it would've been too flaky to roll out.  I personally would also try adding some herbs or spices to flavor the pasta, but I know that's not what this recipe is about, so I didn't rate on that factor - just a personal taste thing.

Good dough.  Will be my go to pasta dough for now on.  I just started making fresh pasta for my husband and roommate and don't think I'll be using much dried pasta from now on. I did add some olive oil and a bit of chopped fresh basil and parsley for color.  It was a very pretty pasta.  I can't wait to make other varieties like whole wheat and basil. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Very good and easy.  I added 2 T finely chopped basil and needed to add extra olive oil (in addition to the water).  Tasted just like a restaurants I've been to in Italy.

Made this tonight as a trial run for making a bunch to freeze in single serving bags for my pasta loving kids.  I'm usually bored by the bland flavour of stored bought dried pasta, but this was incredible!    I mixed it by hand, not realizing until later that I have a pasta setting on my bread maker.  I rolled it out using a heavy marble rolling pin without any trouble, and used a pizza cutter to cut into strips.  Boiled up a few to sample, and it was absolutely delicious with a dab of butter and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.  I used whole wheat flour and the taste was incredible.  I did have to add a bit more water (didn't see the tips to add EVOO until afterwards), but that might have to do with the WW flour.    Tomorrow, I'm doing up at least 4 batches, and may even try my hand at ravioli.   Do try this!

Just tried this recipe and was very pleased with the results. Good flavor, good texture, and seems to be simple enough to be versatile. I added 1 1/2 tsp of lemon pepper to the second batch and it turned out great. Added sesame oil to the third batch for lo mein noodles. Am looking forward to experimenting some more!

I can't belive that i made my own pasta. I am so proud of myself! I admit that it was quite a bit of work to kneed the dough as it so stiff and alot of work to roll it out thin enough but the end result was worth it. I doubled the recipe and added some basil to half of it. Used a pizza cutter to make nice, even, thin slices. If i decide to make this on a regular basis, i think i would invest in a pasta machine.... or give up my gym membership and use this as my exercise! haha

Delicious!! I made a penne pasta with my new pasta maker and itturned out way better than when i used the one on the box. This recipe is a keeper. Note : When shaping pasta put extra flour on the dough so that it doesn't stick together.

I planned to make homemade ravioli for dinner tonight so I decided to try this recipe for the pasta shell part.  I ended up adding several more tablespoons of water than called for since the dough was all dry and crumbly.  I don't have a pasta machine, so I mixed, rolled, and cut by hand.  After the first single recipe, I made a second batch doubled.  Both times I added in a tbsp of olive oil, too, as some other reviewers had suggested.  I did find that the dough rolled out much easier after resting for about 15 minutes.  I used a glass to cut circles and then rolled each one out a little more to thin the dough even more.  I stuffed with a mix of: 1 egg, 1/2 c parmesan, 1 tsp crushed garlic, and about 1/2 tsp italian seasoning.  I ended up making a double batch of the filling to fill three recipes of the pasta.  I filled each circle as I cut them out, damped the inside edges, folded in half, pressed the edges closed, and crimped with a fork.  I then let the pasta dry out for about an hour or so and then refrigerated until time to cook.  They took probably about 10 minutes to cook (I wanted to make sure that the egg in the filling would be plenty cooked) and actually could probably have used another minute or two as a few of the thicker raviolis were still a little firmer than the rest.  All of the raviolis barely fit in my pot, which also may have accounted for not-quite-even cooking.  So, make sure your pasta has plenty of room to move in the boiling water.  Delicious!

I have used this recipe many times! I like it very well. It seems to be a trend on this site to leave a review after you have changed things. I made this just like it says and really like it!   Although, after my last cholesterol results, I now use egg beaters with the same results!

The first time I attempted this recipe I tripled it...bad choice!  It was almost impossible to work with as it was way too dry.  I couldn't get the dough nearly thin enough at all to make a decent noodle.  It was the first time I had tried making my own pasta so I decided to give it another shot today.  I tried just one batch, with the addition of 1 tbsp olive oil.  I let the dough rest for about 45 minutes.  I rolled it as thin as I could and let the sheet dry for about 15 minutes before cutting into strips.  Boiled for about 5 minutes and it was turned out well, but still had a very difficult time getting thin enough noodles.  A decent basic recipe, nothing spectacular but not bad.

I appreciate taking the time to put together this recipe and post it for those who have not made pasta from scratch before (like me). What I DONT appreciate, is failing to note that oil is required if you are not using a pasta machine. The steps CLEARLY state the use of a rolling pin, yet omit you require oil in the recipe to keep the dough from springing back once rolled out. I learned this AFTER following the recipe as directed, when I had a pot full of doughy strips staring back at me. I would suggest taking the time to be detailed when posting a recipe, as to not waste the time and ingredients of those attempting to follow it.

I was so excited to find an easy handmade pasta recipe, but my pasta came out inedible.

I followed the recipe using the additional tips from DianeF (reduced the salt, added olive oil).

The first problem I encountered was producing a stiff dough--mine came out more like large crumbs/chunks of dough. 

I have arthritis, and I should have used a pasta roller to roll out the dough, as I could not get it thin enough with the rolling pin.

When I finally cooked the pasta--for a long time--it still tasted like flour.  I was very sad. 

I hope I can find a new recipe.

I doubled the recipe, added the olive oil as suggested - 1 tbls, and reduced flour by about 1/2 cup. Started in food processor and then kneaded for about 3 minutes. Wrapped in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 min, then used pasta roller. Turned out perfectly!

Great simple recipe. I mixed it all in the kitchenaid with the dough hook then let it sit for 30 minutes before rolling it out very thin.I used half semolina flour and half white flour which makes an excellent noodle. Also added a tablespoon of avacado oil,(I was out of olive oil). I cut the very thin pasta to the size of spaghetti and linguine, cooked in hot, but not quite boiling water for about 2 minutes. It held up beautifully in carbonara.

was a little dry and clumpy at first, added a bit more egg and water and worked great! Easy and yummy! One note for novice pasta makers - fresh pasta is cooked only for about 3-4 mins in hot, but not boiling water... I slightly overcooked my first batch and was heartbroken after all that work! Definitely worth making again, might add more salt and some garlic or herbs to the pasta next time, live dangerously!

I just made this and it was very good! 

I attempted to double the recipe, but I accidentally forgot to double the flour. So I ended up doubling the salt and eggs, but still used only one cup of flour. I also left out the water and just used a tbsp of oil instead. After I kneaded the dough, I let it sit for about 15 minutes. It probably could have used longer, but I was in a bit of a rush.. Despite my mistake and impatience, it was very good and easy to work with.

I've never been able to successfully make fresh pasta by hand, but with this recipe it isn't necessary to use a pasta maker. I imagine it'd be easier and faster, but you can do it by hand. When rolling it out, I'd divide the dough either into three or four portions. Since I have a smaller kitchen counter, this made it easier for me to roll it out and cut it. Before cutting the pasta, make sure both sides of it are dusted with flour to prevent them sticking together before hitting the water. To cut it, I used a pizza cutter.

When it comes to cooking it, I was pretty unsure of how long to cook it at first. I've seen multiple reviews saying 4 minutes or 12 minutes. Honestly, for fettuccine sized pasta you'll only need about 4 or 5 minutes. Just boil a pot of water enough to cover it, salt it, and carefully place the pasta into the water. Make sure to watch after it and stir it. It was bubbling quite a bit while cooking. If I walked off it probably would've boiled over so just make sure to watch out for that.

My whole family was excited about this, they loved it! I made this especially for my mom who is crazy about homemade pasta and she talked about it for days. I have a family of 9 so it took awhile to make but I love to cook so I had no problem with it, I made 6 batches and it fed us all. The dough actually only takes a few minutes to make! I used more water then it called for and I also used a lot of olive oil and it was nice and smooth and easy to roll out. Definitely good to use a pasta maker. My little siblings had fun running it through the pasta maker and seeing it cut them. I think i'll try semolina next time to see how that goes. I was scared to make this but it was way easier than I thought. Also, it's nice because these cook SUPER fast, like 30 seconds. On a super ambitious day I will try raviolis. Make it, your loved ones will love you even more!

Great easy pasta dough. Started in my kitchen aid stand mixer (add flour mixture to the bowl first then egg to keep from sticking to the bowl), and kneaded on the counter halfway through. I did 4 times the recipe and was no problem at all. Not recommended in the stand mixer unless you double/triple the recipe.

It tastes really good, I also put in a pinch of salt in the  water I boiled the pasta in and I think that made it taste better. I also put in about a tablespoon of olive oil in the pasta. I let it rest for about 45 minutes, and it was not hard at all to roll out, but since I'm not very experienced with making pasta, it was hard getting it to the perfect thickness. I think a millimeter or so is a good thickness; mine were a bit too thick.

I double the recipe; but there still doesn't seem to be quite enough water.  Close though.  I add about 1 tbsp of olive oil and use the 'dough' setting on my bread maker so it does all the hard work.  I let it rest for a few hours and have made ravioli, lasagna noodles and fettucine noodles; all by hand and a rolling pin.  Easiest to use a pizza cutter (wheel).  Great light pasta

I doubled the recipe, added a little olive oil and sweet basil (just a pinch), made sure to let the dough rest, and it came out beautifully as rather oddly-shaped ravioli. Of course, the weird shapes were my fault, but if anyone is wondering whether this works for ravioli, it very much does (with an egg wash). Only one broke in the pot and everyone loved it = )

I can't believe how good these were my first attempt. I added some Epicure Lemon Dilly dip spice. I rolled out by hand then cut thin strips. I found that easier than doing the "jelly roll" method. I can't wait to make more!

This is a good recipe and the noodles tasted great, however, if you are a first time pasta maker the directions are not all that good.  I didn't mix the dough properly and it made it a lot more difficult to knead the dough to the proper consistency.  I ended up adding water and oil until it was right.  I found this video after the fact that shows the directions with a little more detail.

Good recipe.  Easy to remember off the top of your head (great for impressing the relations).  You can crank these noodles out while the water is getting ready to boil.  I run mine through my hand crank pasta machine's lasagna rollers and then run it through the linguini rollers.  One caveat:  Pasta dough needs to be a bit moister and stickier than bread dough or you don't get a nice even noodle through the machine.  Too gooey and you gum up the machine.  A few tries should give you a feel for your machine...or rolling pin.

I just made this pasta for dinner and wow was it great!  My 2 teens and hubby loved it.  I doubled the recipe and if you want left-overs, I'd even triple or quaduple it.  I took the advise of others and used 1/2 water and 1/2 EVOO and added to the dough.  The dough came out perfect.  I let it rest for 1.5 hours before I put in the pasta maker.  Once the noodles were cut I placed them on a cookie sheet that was spread with corn meal.  The taste of these noodles was so incredible and will make over and over!

This is my VERY first review of a recipe, but, I just had to tell you, these are SOOO delicious and so very easy!. Mine have not been really pretty because I do not have a pasta roller or shaper, YET. This recipe is making me want one! I just got to where store bought/affordable pasta tasted aweful. THIS one is affordable, not much work, and WONDERFUL! My husband and 11 year old gobbled it up!! I've served it with several different dishes already.

Really easy and quite tasty.  I did end up letting this one rest for at least an hour before running through the pasta roller - it definitely made all the difference.  Will be making again.  :-)

This was my first time making pasta and it was so yummy! And it really was easy. I just used a rolling pin and pizza cutter. Like most everyone, I did add a TB of Olive Oil and I let the dough rest for about 15 minutes after kneading. It made it much smoother. I didn't even let mine dry for very long, I just plopped it in some boiling water. For my sauce I made the "Lighter Fettuccini Alfredo" from this site. Yum

User erros must have been my downfall. I found the recipe easy enough. I kneaded and rolled by hand. The taste improved as I rolled them thiner. However, I found the egg taste too strong for me.

Very good basic recipe...  As a suggestion. To cut noodles or pasta, Once rolled and left to dry a little, coat liberally in flour, Roll like a Swiss Roll, then cut with a very sharp knife.  Keep the cut bits loose, and toss with a bit more flour and you will end up with more uniform noodles.  Quicker too.

Even though my fettuccine didn't turn out as I wanted, I'm still giving this recipe five stars. The taste was fantastic! And my only problem was that I rolled it out by hand and couldn't achieve thin enough sheets to make the perfect noodle. They were thicker (even rolling out EACH cut strip again). BUT I enjoyed making the dough and eating the thick fettuccine SO much, that I ordered a pasta machine from Amazon 10 min after eating :)

This recipe is a good start. I love added crushed red pepper flakes, or dried basil too. You will need to add about a 1/2 tbs evoo to make it a little less sticky! :)

Tried this one.. very nice :) I've been making fresh pasta all my life. Learned how to make the perfect pasta in prato (tuscany). Most people there just use good eggs and "tipo 00" flower..  Also saw a good recipie on makefreshpasta.com and jamie oliver's website.. Also really nice!

I would give this recipe a 5 based on taste, however, if you don't have some sort of hand pasta maker it can be a very long and tedious process cutting the dough into all those little strips. Never having made pasta by hand I was scared to boil the pasta because I thought it would just fall apart (as it does seem very fragile as you let it dry) but as soon as I slipped my pasta into boiling water it really strengthened it! Also, if you want your pasta to taste really authentic I suggest making the sauce by hand too. I found a very basic alfredo sauce on here and my meal felt like I was eating at olive garden!

Simple and quick! I added a tsp more salt to create more flavor. I also let the pasta rest 20 minutes after kneading. This made the dough alot easier to work with.

Even though I forgot to follow the recommended changes (add olive oil and let the dough rest before rolling) the pasta tasted fabulous.  Can't wait to make again!!

It was hard to get it nice and thin by hand-rolling so making Ravioli with it was difficult. It turned out really well and smooth, if a bit thick. Very easy to make. :D

Pasta tastes great and everyone loved it.  I couldn't get a nice thin pasta due to hand rolling.  With the aid of a pasta machine this would be perfect.

I WAS LOOKING FOR A PASTA RECIPE FOR YEARS AND FINALLY FIND IT.  I RECOMENDED TO DOBLE THE RECIPE BECAUSE THIS  WAS JUST ENOUGH FOR 3 KIDS AND PUT THE PASTA TO DRY OVER NIGHT.
BUSCABA UNA RECETA PARA HACER PASTA POR ANOS Y FINALMENTE LA ENCONTRE.  RECOMIENDO DEJAR SECAR LA PASTA DESDE LA NOCHE ANTERIOR Y DOBLAR LA RECETA POR QUE LA RECETA ORIGINAL SOLO ME DIO PARA 3 NINOS.

Don't bother with this recipe unless you have a pasta maker.  I tried rolling this out with a rolling pin and could not get it thin enough.  The noodles tasted ok but were too thick and chewy.

I have used this recipe every time I make fresh pasta - its always fantastic.  I even subsitute 1/2 whole wheat flour sometimes, and it still turns out fantastic (though you have to add a bit more all purpose flour to reduce the stickiness of the dough).  It rolls out beautifully both by hand and with a machine.  I usually have to add a bit of extra water to get the dough to a smooth consistency, but its likely because I live in Alberta which is usually quite dry.

This was FUN!!!  Very easy to make.  Why on earth would I ever buy noodels from the store again!  My 3 year old cranked the handel on our pasta machine while I fed it through.  He had so much fun making them he ate a TON at dinner!  I will make this all the time.  I also crated a sauce out of veggies from our garden and this was the best spaghetti I have tasted in my entire life.  NO JOKE!  Yummmmmmmmmmyyy!!!!!!!

Made this tonight and loved it! We made it into ravioli, and it was a mess but delicious.  I let the stand mixer do much of the initial heavy mixing work, and then kneaded it a bit more by hand and rolled out by hand (that's why they were a mess).  We can't wait to have this again, but next time we'll try flat noodles.  Great recipe!

Great recipe!  I don't have a pasta machine, so when I rolled it out, it was a little too thick, but I will roll it out even thinner next time.  Fantastic.  I made this the first time with Fettucine Alfredo V (submitted by Greg) from this site and it was very good.  I can't wait to use this for ravioli and other pastas.  Thanks Pat!

Not bad. I used a food processor to mix it up (using the least amount of water possible and checking it often to avoid stickiness) then I used the pasta roller on the KitchenAid. Good recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Pluses: it's fun to make; it's fun to cook; and it's a great blank slate recipe (I used basil as an added seasoning). Minuses: it's tough without a pasta maker, it doesn't look so good and even when hand-cut, and the recipe is dangerously time consuming (I was able to eat it about an hour and a quarter after starting the recipe, with 1/2 of dough-set time included). Overall, a decent recipe, but not for beginners.

This is a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  I've had a pasta maker in my cupboard for ages and I've been too scared to use it.  This recipe worked out wonderfully!  Keep adding flour as it is rolled out - the stiffer the dough the better it will cut.

It's okay, the flavor was nothing special and a little mushy.  If you don't have a pasta machine and have to cut it by hand it is not terribly pretty!

This is a great fresh pasta recipe.  I tripled the recipe and it was very good.  I think I made it a little too moist, because it stuck a little in my pasta machine, but I just dusted each piece with a little flour.

LET IT REST!
It was awesome, I just substituted 1 sp. of water by oil, added more eggs (5 eggs for each 4 cups of flour) & let it rest for at least 30min.

My first attempt at making pasta and the family and I LOVE it.  I read and followed others suggestions.  Thank you all for the helpful hints.  Less salt, olive oil and let it rest.  I bought semolina flour months ago so I could make pasta.  I used half and half, plain flour and semolina.  The recipe and directions are simple and easy.     I made ravioli stuffed with Italian sausage and cheeses.   So good.  I donât have a pasta machine but I will soon.    Using my rolling pin the first time I didnât get the pasta rolled thin enough and my  ravioli were a bit thick and chewy.  I rolled them really thin (pasta swells as cooks) next batch and they were perfect.  This will be my go to recipe.  Most every time I google a recipe, an  All Recipes, recipe is one of the top ones and they are always good.

I added 1/2 cup of homemade basil & spinach pesto, which led to adding about 1/2c. more flour.  It was fantastic!   Served it with Pesto, grilled chicken and garden fresh cherry tomatoes, covered with fresh grated Parm.  It was a smash!

This recipe is amazing. At first it was lumpy but after putting the dough through the pasta machine a few times it was smooth and thin. I use this recipe all the time and have not had one problem with it.

It was very unappetizing because the dough was not smooth; it was lumpy and dry and required that I add much more water than was recommended just to get it to meld together into a dough. It wouldn't cut thru my pasta machine either. My kids ate it bc they love any pasta and just pretended it was a prairie version of noodles.

Excellent pasta! Definitely going to need a machine next time! (I like my pasta thinner which is difficult when rolling it out by hand) I used 1 tbsp extra water at it was a little too dry. But quick and delicious!

Lost my pasta recipe that I used for years and, voila, I found this one.  It's so much better than my old one; no additional flour needed to roll. I used my pasta machine and you really don't want your dough to be the least bit sticky.  Not so with this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to let it rest for 20 minutes; please do it, you will be glad you did. Thanks so much for posting

This morning I was so excited to try this recipe! I was disappointed in the beginning though, due to the fact that it was very dry and crumbly. If I were a "newby" in the kitchen, I would have panicked LoL. However, cooking all my life kept me calm! I just added an extra egg and a drizzle of olive oil. So far so good! Felt great after kneading, firm and elastic like it should.

My husband and I made the recipe just as written. We were wanting to taste his mother's homemade past again. She passed away 10 years ago and we haven't made it until now. We had some trouble with the egg escaping the "volcano" and we didn't have the proper clamp for the pasta machine. But we got thru it! It tasted a lot like hers and was absolutely delish! Thank you for posting it!

Today was the first time that my pasta maker had a handle so I was super excited to try pasta for the first time. I ended up using almost exactly the water recommended, and it was SO easy and straightforward. I don't think I've ever enjoyed spaghetti so much in my life, I can't wait to try flavors and other pasta types, how exciting!

Sorry to be the downer on here, but I just don't think it's worth all the effort involved.  Sure the noodles were nice, but it took a good portion of my day, and nearly all counter space to make them.  I also let them dry for 3 hours like many recipes suggest.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a lazy chef. My kids never ate baby food from a jar and I almost never buy something packaged, if I can easily do it myself, like bread. But this is too much work. Maybe it's because I am more of a sauce person. The noodles are just a way to transport sauce.  And considering I can buy organic egg noodles and dump them in boiling water on the spurr of the moment, I'll stick with that.

Quick and super easy! I followed the suggestions and added a bit of olive oil. Letting it rest was the key. I've made pasta before, but it wasn't this easy...or raved about as much!

This worked out great for us, the secret is definitely letting the dough rest. My son helped make them for his 1st anniversary with his GF. We used the Kitchenaid to mix the dough, and the pasta attachments to roll and then cut into fettuccine noodles. What a special dinner. Thanks for this perfect pasta recipe.

First time making pasta!  Doubled recipe, added a little water plus dribble of olive oil. Used my mixer and hook to mix/knead it and let it rest in the bowl abt 30 mins (while I made a carbonara sauce, yum). I don't have a pasta machine-just used a rolling pin on floured mat to roll super thin.  Then I cut into strips with a pizza cutter.  I worked in batches instead of rolling out the whole ball of dough at once. I piled the strips on a floured paper plate while I finished all the dough and it was fine, did not stick together. This was easier than I thought and had a really good flavor. Boil in salted water for about 30 seconds to 1 minute and it's done!  So good, will make again for sure. Made enough for four good bowls of pasta and sauce.

Doubled for family of 4 - added 2 tbsp olive oil.  First time using my pasta press.  So easy & delicious.  Totally worth the effort!
Made fettuccine and made Meat-Lover's Slow Cooker Spaghetti Sauce earlier in the day to go on top so I could focus on the pasta.

Loved this Recipe.  I am not a cook (I'm a baker!). It was so easy to make.  I did add oil like other people suggested.  I made this with my preschool class and they were able to do it no problem.  So much fun.  Thank you for this wonderful easy to make recipe that is delicious.  My daughters only want homemade pasta now!

Tastes just like real pasta. This video was helpful as well http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ry484ydpU

Try to shape it nicely and don't be afraid to cut the pasta too thin.

Nothing better than fresh pasta, basic proportions are 100g flour to one egg, works every time. also great if you add fresh herbs to the dough.

My first time making fresh pasta- I will never buy it again! It was wonderful! Simple, great tasting, and without fancy tools- Just a rolling pin and pizza cutter. Word of advice- for those(like me) who have tile countertops- fins a flat surface (cutting board, huge cookie sheet, or bakers marble stone) to do this on. It will go much faster, and your pasta will look more like store-bought. Thank you so much! Ohoh- and for those who dont have a lot of time or patience to cut thin little stings of linguini- make farfalle!

I LOVED IT! I'm so thrilled to find a basic pasta recipe. I did NOT do any alterations. The only drawback (which is not the recipes fault) is it took about a good 30 minutes to cut the pasta to make spaghetti. I don't have a pasta maker/KA and pasta attachment so it was me and a pizza slicer. So worth it though and will make over and over again.

This is a great, easy pasta recipe. But let the dough rest as others said. I had a hard time rolling it out by hand since it kept shrinking back! Maybe I'll get a pasta machine. I made Mushroom and Marscapone ravioli with this and it was restaurant quality!

The salt makes it so yummy.  It is a little difficult to get it thin enough when using a rolling pin, but the taste was so good no one minded.  My Dad like it so much he bought me a pasta attachment for my stand mixer!

Beautiful!  Like the other commenters, I added about 1/2 tbsp olive oil and I let the dough rest, covered for a 1/2 hour before putting through the machine.  It kept jamming/stalling in the machine, so I rubbed some water on my hands, then onto the dough and kneaded it for a minute.  Then it worked perfectly.

I made according to the recipe and it was not our favorite.  I did use my pasta machine but I don't feel that would have made a difference.  It just made it easier.  The difference between this recipe and our favorite is to use bread flour or semolina pasta flour or a combination of both.  Also, replace one of the tablespoons of water with olive oil.  Those changes make a delicious pasta.  Also, remember that it only takes a couple minutes to cook fresh pasta.  Will make again with my changes.

As a first time pasta maker, I was shocked at how easy this was to make!  I doubled the recipe, adding about 1 tbs. olive oil and the full amount of water then let the dough rest for 20 minutes.  It was easy to work with, but since I don't have a pasta roller, I had to roll by hand. I thought I had rolled it thin enough, but the ravioli I made were just a little too thick.  I'll definitely try this out again once I procure a pasta roller!  As a side note, a simple egg wash on one side of the ravioli sealed the pasta perfectly and there was no leakage during boiling!  Yay!

VERY good and VERY easy to make!  This was my 1st attempt at making pasta and was surprised to see how easy it was...kinda had me thinking that it wouldnt be that good, BUT boy, was I WRONG!!  I doubled the recipe and used another poster's advice and used 1 TBS olive oil.  The dough was very easy to work with.  I will be making this many times more, I am sure!!  Thanks for the great recipe!  :)

It was my first time and it was fun to make but pretty tricky for a first timer. 

If I make it again i will roll it a lot thinner than i think i'll need. Also - I tried to cut ravioli and cut the pieces too small and they didn't stick together very well.  I think I would try to get a gadget that would help with that. Pretty tasty though!!

I had never made my own pasta before and after a little bit of work, I was really proud of the outcome!  I thought the ingredients were pretty simple and after combining it with some homemade sauce it was really good

i used this recipe to make ravioli! it was fantastic!! i did roll it out a bit too thick though....

i also added olive oil to help it stick together, and only used a pinch of salt....and i recommend leaving it to rest about 45 mins AT LEAST. i halved mine and let half rest for about 45 mins, and used the other half which rested only 30 mins and the dough was a bit too tough to roll out on your own (i didn't use a pasta machine).

Very easy, very cheap, very delicious and, with a simple pasta maker, surprisingly fast to make.  I reduce the water slightly and add a teaspoon or less of olive oil per cup of flour.

Be sure not to overcook the noodles - they cook much faster than commercially dried varieties - and boil in LOTS of water.

This is also a fun item for children to make.

I keep my Atlas pasta maker attached to my island covered with a clean dishcloth and when I make pasta, I set up a dowel resting between the flour bin and paper towel holder, lay the dishcloth over the dowel, and am ready to go in 10 seconds.  

Last night a niece and friend visited unexpectedly, hungry as usual, and they were having fresh homemade fettucini Alfredo within a half hour.  The lack of rest time for the dough didn't seem to matter.

This was soooo yummy. I ran the dough through the pasta roller, and it came out wonderful. I did have to add a little more liquid and a dash of oil to make it all stick together. The taste.....divine.

This didn't turn out great for me.  It was good, but just not great.  I know pasta can be tricky & I have tried it before without success.  I must say this recipe did turn out much better than my previous attempt.  I let the dough rest for about 30-45 mins , as advised by other reviewers, and I rolled it as thin as I could...but the noodles still came out very big/puffy/chewy. My boyfriend thinks it was really good and says the reason it came out this way is because I rolled it by hand. Neither of my kids would eat it though.  I'm giving it 3 stars, but my b/f thinks it deserves 4....I'll try it again, maybe making another shape... then I'll report back!!

My family loves homemade pasta.  It is a little time consuming to make and cut the pasta but it is worth it!  My husband bought me a Kitchen Aid mixer with pasta attachment.  Love that man! This is so quick to make now.

Great pasta recipe, easy to work with just remember to let it rest a bit first if you're rolling it out. I make pilmeni (russian ravioli) with it and it was great. Don't forget to flour your workspace as you go.

My first time ever making homemade pasta! A great success...don't have a pasta crank, so used a small bread roller...cut the pasta into several pieces, rolled out, and cut into fettuccini sized pieces with a pizza cutter.
Had to add an extra egg...but that could be because of the humidity, size of the eggs, or the fact that I tripled the recipe. So easy that I simply told my little sis how to make a few days later and she made a great batch!
A permanant addition to my recipe collection!

I don't have much to compare this to since this was my first time with homemade pasta. i actually did this by hand with no mixer or pasta maker. it was surprisingly easy. i did have to add bit more water (didn't read the tips about olive oil til later). it worked rather well in a humid climate.

I misplaced my pasta book and was in a rush so I did a quick search on allrecipes and found this. I really didn't expect it to turn out as well as it did. This recipe is so incredibly easy and has so much room to work with it. The recipe I was cooking from didn't require my pasta machine, but next time I'll see how it does in the pasta machine. Great recipe!

Excellent pasta!  I usually add about a tablespoon of olive oil like one of the other reviews advised.  Another tip is to use a pizza cutter to cut the pasta into strips, if you don't have a pasta maker; it's so much easier than a knife!

I was scared to try this recipe b/c I didn't have dough hooks on my mixer, but I am so glad I did.  It was wonderful!!!!!  We seasoned it with Italian Seasoning & used it as ravioli sheets.  Absolutely wonderful & super easy --- even without dough hooks!!!

Although this pasta tasted good it did not come together easily.  I would recommend using a bit of olive oil to smooth out the texture.  It rolled out (with my pasta maker) nicely to form the lasagna strips and boiled aldente in about 2 minutes.  I'm not too sure if I will stick to using this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at making fresh pasta, and it was surprisingly easy! I made some delicious ricotta raviolies out of this!! YUM! The only thing that I wish were different about it would be that it need not be so stiff. It was a little difficult to roll out, but totally worth it!! Thanks!

This is my second attempt at making homemade pasta.  My first attempt was a total disaster.  So bad, that it's been a full year before I decided that I should try again.  

This recipe is VERY simple. I don't have a pasta maker so I rolled it out with a wooden roller.  I made them WAY to thick but the flavor was excellent. 

To cook this recipe, I added the fresh pasta to a boiling pot of lightly salted water.  Within 3 minutes they were ready to be eaten.  DELISH!

I donât know what parallel world has this recipe making 3 servings. I doubled it and it wasnât enough for me, my wife, and my 8 & 6 year old sons. Otherwise it seems fine;  first homemade pasta experience

I just made this recipe today and I ended up having to add about 4 tablespoons of water to get it completely mixed and instead of salt I used seasoning salt, after wrapping it in plastic wrap I left it in the fridge for about an hour and a half to firm up a bit. I still have some left over, to make some more tomorrow I ended up only turning about 1/4 of it into pasta today.

four others keep in mind your altitude can affect things with flour in it when it comes to either making cake pies or pasta.

This is a good fundamental recipe to build on with personal preferences and modifications. I made pasta sheets and stuffed, rolled, and cut the into cannelloni al forno (oven baked). I doubled the batch and used 2 tablespoons of EVOO and more water to balance the moisture, and facilitate the compression of the dough. Resting the dough wrapped in plastic is essential, and having the cooked and mixed stuffing made before you fill the pasta sheets is also essential. I blanched the pasta sheets in salted boiling water for 90 seconds, then shocked them in ice water, and patted them dry before stuffing and cutting them. I used commercial General Mills âSperryâ Extra Fancy Durum flour number 57602.

Doubled this recipe and still found it was too dry. I added in some olive oil and an extra egg and it was perfect. Only let it sit for about 10 minutes and it went through the pasta machine really easily!

Will definitely be making again.

I started which a few batches all made different ways. I was surprised on how they all came out great! This recipe is my go-to if I'm low on cash and want a nice easy meal for me or my family. Simple ingredients, multitude of ideas and fashions. I would really recommend just spending a while to get to know the dough. It's easy to start and maintain. As an inexperienced pasta maker, this is my Go-To.

I used my Kitchenaid Mixer dough attachment. I left out the salt and it was fine. This recipe makes the perfect amount for two people and we had some leftover.  I'm going to make it again tonight for homemade ravioli.

This was great! Makes fantastic fettuccine alfredo. Has the same flavor as my favorite box pasta without the hassle of cooking it long enough to make sure the pasta isn't crunchy.

I tried a different recipe last week and thought I wouldn't try again because it was so eggy and chewy.  I tried this one today and it was super easy and delicious.  I used half olive oil and half water and did have to add just a little more water to it.  i boiled the pasta for about 8 minutes.  I melted 1 TBL of butter and squeeze a little garlic paste in the butter.  Added a bag of steamed broccoli florets and the pasta.  I added a little of the pasta broth and added fresh ground pepper to the top.  It was a delicious meal for 1.  For me this recipe makes 2 servings.

Not sure what I did, but made this exactly as written. I got a bunch of crumbly flour that was nowhere near a dough. I added some olive oil, still crumbly, then a tbsp of water, still crumbly. I added a bit more water but was concerned I was going to end up with leaden noodles but nothing I was doing was coming near a dough. I finally doused it with some water knowing I was probably already giving up. Then I had glue, so I threw the wad in the trash. I'm not used to failing in the kitchen, so I'm sort of at a loss on this one.

Delicious! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and doubled the recipe and added a tiny bit of olive oil to the flour, egg, salt & water mixture during kneading. I also let the dough rest for 45 minutes before rolling out by hand and it truly made it easy to work with. Awesome recipe! ??

This one's a keeper. Easy to make, easy to adjust for dryness, easy to calculate larger batches. Would have liked a more assertive taste but it IS only white flour and one egg.

Make sure your dough is quite dry (use a lot of flour) before cutting.  If it is too moist, the strands will stick together.

Being a single, I halved the recipe (and still have lots extra for leftovers!).  I am a good cook, but have never been able to master making pasta...until I fell upon this recipe.  Fantastic results.

Very easy recipe I made it exactly the way the recipe suggested.  I have a pasta machine so rolling it out and then cutting it into spaghetti strips was very easy. I did not let the dough sit at all. I did however hang the strips of spaghetti on a wood pasta dryer for about 15 minutes.  I boiled it one minute, turned off the burner and let the pasta sit in the water for another 30seconds. The quantity was perfect for my husband and I.
I will definitely be making this again !
Oh and I won't be buying spaghetti any time soon!!

I made this with gluten free flour and it was delicious.  I had to add a little more water and a little bit of olive oil to get the right consistency but it was still fast and easy.

This is the first time Iâve made pasta and it turned out fantastic! I did add the 2 tablespoons of water. Although it seemed very crumbly it came together nicely with kneading. Because it was crumbly to start I kneaded it in the bowl I mixed it in just in case it needed more liquid. I let the dough rest in the fridge for about a half hour before rolling it out.

made some great pasta.  I ended up adding a little more water, but not sure if my Semolina flower just took a bit more or what.

I used this recipe to make pasta for my very first time. This was a very easy and simple recipe to follow. I used my bread machin to make the dough and kneed it so I used maybe another tablespoon of water and maybe next time I will use oil instead of that extra water. No changes to the recipe besides extra water, the flavor is mild and tastes way better than store bought pasta.

Perhaps this is a US recipe, but â1 Cupâ of flour translates to the metric system as being 340g. I tried this recipe based on those proportions (1 egg to 340g flour) and it didnât work at all. The dough was far too stiff. After further research I used a recipe based on a ratio of 100g flour per egg (plus a healthy pinch of salt and a glug of olive oil) - a two egg recipe feeds 4 - which was a great success. Although, I might have got the measurement translation completely wrong!

It was fun to make and I made a filling for some of them. I did this because I made raviolis for a few of them for fun.  It was basic ricotta filling with minced garlic and olive oil. I hope this helps anyone who makes this! ~BakingQueen

Dough was slow to come together. Be patient, dry ball, but keep working it. 
Delicious, held together, went well with Baked Salmon II and some grilled zucchini and squash.

Works fine for me! I have to add a smidge additional water b/c I use whole wheat flour, and I let it rest for 1-2 hours. The dough is workable and tastes just fine.

I started using this recipe for a while and started making deviations.  I did spinach and carrot pasta, by adding in cooked and pureed vegetables but needed to add an additional 10% flour.  I replaced 30% of the flour content with semolina and found I needed an additional 10%-20% more water plus the dough was tougher requiring 5 passes in the roller.  Great versatile recipe.

For a beginner this came out better than expected, I have recently bought a pasta roller and was very pleased at how it worked. It is true, fresh made is far better than store bought boxed pasta.

Fabulous and easy!  I made the dough and then refrigerated it for several hours.  That night I took it out and let it warm up for about an hour, then sheeted the dough.  Such great consistency!

I would not consider this recipe a success. I did not have a pasta maker so rolled out and cut the noodles by hand, as the recipe told me I could, and it did not work. I rolled them as thin as I could and they were too thick and didn't really cook right and, probably because of that, they did not taste good. I possibly would make this recipe again IF I had a pasta maker, but definitely not if I didn't have a pasta maker.

I have made this recipe Andre times and I loved it. I did follow what others said about replacing a tablespoon of water with a tablespoon of olive oil. I let the dough ready for about 15 min and it was a lot easier to work with. I have also made this pasta using half cup of flour and half cup of semolina. I prefer the addition of semolina. When using semolina I have added half a tablespoon of olive oil in addition to the water.

This is my first time making pasta.  It was really easy.  I did use the modification that another member suggested.  I used half the amount of salt and used olive oil instead of water.  It seemed to make the texture better.  Resting it is a big help.  The whole family loved the pasta.

I made this per recipe and it turned out quite well. It does seem a bit dry, but after it rests a bit, it fairly manageable. 

Other reviews mentioned that it was too dry and they were unable to roll it thin enough. Pasta isn't like bread dough, or even cookie dough, it needs to be pretty dry. I would recommend a pasta maker, they can be purchased for around $25 and it's very hard to get the dough thin enough otherwise. 

Next time I make this I think I will keep everything the same, except replace the water with an egg yolk, hopefully this will add a bit of flavor and color to the noodles.

Only trouble I had was in using my pasta cutter. I finally realized that working in small batches through the machine was the way to go.

This is only my second time ever making pasta, BUT it worked SO MUCH better than the first time I tried it! With this recipe, I really thought I botched it at first, because it was super dry and clumpy and I could *not* get it to form any sort of dough. But I added 1T of olive oil and 1T of water and got my hands in there and that did the trick. It was still pretty dry after that, but I think that's what made it easy to roll out and cut into strips. (Haha I read reviews about letting it rest... didn't do that, but it was totally still workable) It tasted delicious!!!

I read the previous reviews before making this pasta.  It does require more than the recommended two tablespoons of water.  I ended up using two each of water and olive oil.  It worked well in my pasta roller and on my ravioli press.  I fried the ravioli in butter for my recipe and it really went over well!

I loved this recipe...
I added an extra half cup of flour and a little more water and I used a Ronco Pompeil electric pasta maker and it turns out better than the recommended recipe.
Yes I will use it again, I copied it to my cookbook for future reference.

I used 3 tbsp. Of water and a tbsp. Of olive oil. To feed 4-5 people you definitely need to triple the recipe. I also kneaded the dough for 4-5 minutes and let it set for about 20 before rolling to give it the best texture.

followed the recipe, but it was hard to get it into a ball. I added around an extra tablespoon of water to get it to form together. Everything went smoother after that. I used a machine to flatten it out and just cooked it. I was delicious and was not doughy.

Made recipe as described, then ran it through my hand crank pasta maker to cut spaghetti. The flavor was similar to that of unseasoned Raman noodles (instant packaged), but the texture was awful. The pasta was very, very soft after cooking. I prefer al dente.

Just love this recipe. Have tried a few other recipes for pasta and they were either too dry or not dry enough this is perfect but with a couple of changes on my part. The basic recipe does not really change. I used 00 flour instead of plain flour and also used 1 Tablespoon of olive oil. By far the best and easiest recipe yet. The noodles ran through my kitchen aide paste roller as smoothly as butter.

I took this basic recipe d used it to make gluten free pasta for my family. (My wife and two boys are gluten intolerant) I substituted Pillsbury GF flour and added 4 eggs instead of one. I also added a good tablespoon of olive oil to the mix. It was great. It tastes exceptional. It did take some practice to roll it out thin enough to make lasagna noodles, but I got it after two attempts. My family loves it and says the pasta tastes and eats like the real thing. I just needed a good basic starting point, and this recipe was IT!

This recipe was so easy and tasted good.  For the water I did half water half oil.  Used my Kitchenaid to mix and kneed.  Also used the flat roller and spaghetti roller attachments.  Made it really easy.  Boiled for about 4 min.

This recipe was SO easy, and I didn't even use a pasta machine to roll it out - we hand rolled and cut it ourselves.  My 16 year old said it was the best pasta he's ever had, and this was my first try at making fresh pasta.  Try it, what a difference in taste, this will take your pasta dishes to the next level.

This is a super easy recipe for pasta.  I took other reviewers advice and doubled the recipe, decreased the amount of salt by half, and subbed olive oil for half of the water the recipe called for.  I also subbed out the AP flour and used 00 flour I got from my Italian grocery. I let the dough rest for 30 minutes after forming.  Then I rolled it through my new pasta sheeter and cutter and let it hang dry over a rack while I finished sheeting and cutting.  I dropped it in some boiling, salted water for about 2-3 minutes and it was done!.  It was wonderful.  This was my first time making pasta and it is absolutely worth the time.  Fantastic!

very good pasta recipe. I doubled the recipe, and replaced 1/2 cup ap flour with semolina flour. I also used three large eggs and a couple tablespoons olive oil, as it seemed too dry. Kneading it by hand seemed easier and faster than a mixer, but I rolled and cut it with my kitchenaid, and it went through the rollers very well.

I had trouble using my kitchen aid mixer attachment (spaghetti)  the first time around. Second time I took the advice of previous reviewers and used a bit of olive oil instead of water which made it easier for the dough to go through the machine. I cut up the dough into small 2 inch balls and plopped them into the mixer. Nice strands of spaghetti! I think next time I will try semolina flour since all purpose tastes a little dough-y to me. However, everyone else I served it to loved it.

This is my new favorite fresh pasta recipe! I followed the recipe,  quadrupled it, but substituted about 3 T of the water with olive oil. I used my kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook. Rested it, covered in plastic wrap for about 10 minutes, then rolled in into spaghetti with the kitchenaid attachments.  It was so easy! Besides the resting, the whole process took about 20 minutes.

Everything it promised to be...easy and quick to prepare, easy to roll and press through the machine, and finally, the pasta was fine and smooth.  I've saved this recipe and will always use this as my base.  Thank you!

Basic recipe worked. Added a littlittle  olive oil based on other reviews. Let dough rest for 30 minutes as I started sauce and meatballs. Used Kitchen Aide to blend but also hand kneaded to form dough ball. After resting used pasta machine to make spaghetti.  Started on lowest setting and worked up to 5, then cut. Boiled in salted water but didn't use enough flour while spaghetti strands waited to go swimming and some noodles stuck together. Need to work on technique but flavor was good. Thanks for head start.

Great recipe, very easy with wonderful results. Used my KitchenAide for both mixing & rolling  the pasta.  Took the advice of others & used half water, half olive oil. Also added some dry basil & cracked pepper. Will definitely be making this again & again.

What a great, easy recipe!  I love mixing the dough  bowl.  It is so cleaner and easier.  Also, the pasta (fettucini) took a little over one minute to cook in pre-boiling water.  It was perfect and delicious!  It was enough pasta for two entrÃ©e or four appetizer size portions.

I had never made pasta before, but I love the taste and texture of the homemade pasta that I get at the local Italian restaurant! This recipe was easy to follow, but I did have to add some oil and extra water to the dough to get it to stick together. I took the advice of other cooks and let it rest for 15 min. and cooked it for about 8 minutes. I don't have a pasta roller, so my pasta was thick (more like dumplings, but I like it that way), and it expands a bit while cooking. Topped with melted butter, it's a wonderful comfort food for a stormy evening!

Really easy, and great if you do have a pasta machine.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 TBL olive oil in place of 1 TBL water.  I made lasagna noodles in less than 1/2 hour and far better than anything from the grocery.

I use this recipe to make lasagna or spaghetti, good for all kinds of basic, often I use some olive oil instead of all water. I always double but then rush to work it before it dries out. The trick to making pasta is balance, to have it wet enough that it stretches out and goes through the machine, but not sticky, at all, because it also will mess up in the machine. I've never over worked it, but I have added too much flour before and it got almost too hard to roll (used a rolling pin to assist) .  Here's some tips; portion it out into approx. 2-3 inch balls, flour your board generously, flatten and roll it out a bit with a rolling pin, flour both sides, fold two sides in (so that it is folded into thirds and leaves a nice edge, turn 90degrees  repeat until it's not too sticky to put into the machine, start on the biggest thickness, then middle, then thin, then cutter if desired. Remember, it doubles in size so if you leave it too thick, it's going to be like a steak. If you mess up, too wet let's say, just fold and roll again because it never seems to be effected except if it dries too much. If I'm making spaghetti, I just keep dusting the bowl with flour as the noodles go in, otherwise you need someone to catch them or they clump together and stick.

Great recipe! Followed others' advice and doubled recipe, used 1 Tbsp olive oil to replace some of the water and let it rest at least 30minutes after kneading and before rolling in pasta machine.

It's a long standing tradition passed down in my family to make what we call filled noodles.  Kind of a perogie or ravioli dish, but filled with beef and a couple other ingredients.  Forgetting the original recipe, I've used this one a few times  and loved it.  Since my noodles are filled, with beef, I used a little bit of beef broth instead of the water.  Doing homemade chicken noodle soup, I've also substituted chicken broth for the water.  It makes the noodles much more flavorful...that added little "kick"...as many noodles are pretty bland on their own.  Another option is to use beef or chicken bullion mixed only with enough water to dissolve the cube.  Delicious noodles on their own (as my picky 11 year old likes) or when added to any recipe that calls for homemade noodles.

I have a hand crank pasta machine and have used a similar recipe for years. If you are rolling it by hand, adding oil helps prevent the dough from "springing back" when it's being rolled. Adding a healthy dash of nutmeg adds a nice touch of flavor. Fresh pasta freezes well; just pile it loosely in a plastic bag and boil it while still frozen. It's important to know that fresh pasta cooks in a few minutes, three or four at the most.  I use a wooden pasta dryer, which you might want if you make this often. I was visiting my son in another state and he requested homemade pasta. Since I didn't have a dryer rack, I washed several plastic hangers, loaded them up with the cut pasta and hung them on cabinet knobs. It got a good laugh when they came home from work to find their kitchen decorated with fettuccine.

I wish I would've followed the recipe instead of adding in olive oil. My fault so I won't downgrade the recipe based on my mistake. I will make this again without the olive oil! First time pasta maker and it worked pretty good!

My 12 year old son wanted to learn to make pasta.  We tried this recipe and we found success on the 1st try!  He made this with very little help from me.  Very simple and tasty.  We followed the advice of adding oil and letting the dough rest.  Next time we need to roll it out thinner and cook it a minute longer.  We will be adding this to our dinner menu rotation

It was my first time making my own pasta. My mom used to make homemade pasta for me when I was a little girl on Christmas  so I was looking to replicate it. Like some suggested, I did end up  doubling the recipe and replacing one of the tablespoons of water for oil and I let the dough sit covered for 45 minutes. Very easy to work with. Using a pizza cutter, my pieces came out very uneven, so if I make it again, I will invest in a pasta maker so the noodles are uniform. Otherwise, great recipe.

Use 3 Tbsp of water instead of 2 and add 1 Tsp of oil otherwise it will be crumbly and dry. The kneading was not easy at all, it felt like a cardio work out. The noodles were perfect.

Really easy,  Really Tasty! Only 4 stars because it does need some slight modification. I used about 1Tbs of olive oil to make it easier to work. I needed a smidge over 2Tbs of water for my first batch. I also wrapped in plastic wrap after dough formed for about 30 minutes before rolling and cutting
I highly recommend using a stand mixer if you have one it makes it super easy. 
If cooking for more than one person as a main course will want to at least double the batch size.

This was my first time ever making pasta... I love it! Instead of only adding salt however, for the seasoning I added salt, dried basil, celery salt, and a blend of garlic and parsley salt. I made a new version of Chicken Alfredo, with this Pasta, Alfredo sauce and fried chicken tenders on the side... Its delicious!!

I made this (very) recently and I love the proportions of it. Though I would recommend adding a few teaspoons of olive oil as you knead it. It was a bit gluey as first and the oil just brought it all together. Then, when you're cooking it, add lots of salt to the water. There's not much salt in the recipe and the salt brings out the flavor of the pasta.

Easy recipe that's great!  Changes I've made (made it several times) are:
-Add a little olive oil and a little less water (around 1/2)
-Let dough rest covered for 20 minutes at room temp after kneading
-Roll out dough as thin as you like on a pastry cloth, dust with flour and let sit another 20 minutes uncovered
-Cut with pizza roller or knife
-then cook!

This turned out really good. I wasn't sure if it would work.  It did.  Just added 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon parsley . I let it rest for about 1 hr. I hand rolled it really thin and  I made a mushroom basil sauce to go with it!! Will make again.

This was my first attempt at making homemade pasta, so I wanted an easy recipe.  I followed it with no changes, but the dough was so dry I couldn't even get all the flour to mix in.  So I added the water, and it was still too dry.  I added 2 tbs EVOO (I misread the other comments where they said they added 1/2 tbs), but it turned out fine, and it all held together well.  I don't have a pasta machine so I rolled it out by hand.  As a result, it was kind of thick, but I cut it into strips and cooked it.  The end result was OK.  A little too salty for me, which made me think of the old salt dough we used to make Christmas ornaments out of as kids.  And because of the thickness, some of the pieces were not fully cooked in the middle but the outsides were starting to get slimy.  If I try this one again, I'll cut the salt in half, and add less EVOO to see if that changes the flavor.  I can always add more if needed.  Other recipes I've seen have a higher egg-to-flour ratio so I might try one of those next time.  When I do make pasta again, I'll try and roll it out more evenly so it cooks more evenly.  But for a first attempt, I'm not too disappointed with how it came out, and I'm encouraged to try it again.

I followed the recipe exactly adding 2 T of water to the beaten egg.  I have made pasta so many times and I've always added a little water and olive oil. No oil this time. I have the Atlas machine with a motor attachment and it is wonderful. I bought the motor about one year ago and it's like having a 3rd hand. It's not cheap but it is well worth the price. Always allow the dough to rest in the fridge for at least  minutes. I will cut the sheets into angel hair and it will be delicious. It always is. Olive oil, garlic a little chopped parsley and a light sprinkle of Italian seasoning. No cheese needed for this baby.

I had lost my basic dough recipe so used this for perogies the other night. I also had to add more water not a surpise flour has been very dry lately. Next time i will definitely start with a tablespoon of olive oil and add water as needed to make dough. But it rolled out well with padta roller and sealed well around filling overall I was pleased with end result

I have made pasta noodles in the past with a similar recipe, they came out ok.  This time I followed the advice of others and added 2tbs of olive oil and let the dough rest for about 30 minutes before rolling it out. They came out great! This is definitely a keeper!!

This is great! I needed a bit more water and let it rest on the counter for about an hour while I folded laundry. I rolled it with my pasta roller and it had beautiful stretch to it, which allowed it to get super thin. I used it in a lasagna and it baked up quickly --about 25-30 minutes, but the pasta itself was probably cooked after about 5 minutes in the oven. The noodles didn't overcook or get mushy, though, so it all turned out very well. With the additional water (closer to 4tbsp) I really liked this recipe. I also added about a teaspoon of vegetable oil which I think helped keep it from sticking to my roller. :) All in all very good!

At first I couldn't get the right texture when I rolled it. Someone suggested letting the dough rest for 20 minutes, and it turned out perfect. I didn't add any water as it seemed to make the dough sticky and not easy to roll out.  I used a pasta roller to roll and cut fetuccini. Thanks for the recipe:)

I used a little more water to get this to come together - I also used half oat flour which might have made the need for more water.

Big slimy worms! It was not hard to roll out for me, but I just couldnt get it thin enough. It was also kinda slimy, even after rinsing it with cool water a vigorously straining. It was like giant slimy french fries, but with a different taste. This was my first try ever, not sure if homemade pasta is worth the work. A lot harder than pie crust. The only positive was that I added McCormick Italian Seasoning to the dough which was so delicious, but overall no so great.

I found a pasta machine on clearance yesterday and thought what a great idea! So today was my first attempt at ever making my own. I found this recipe and because of the reviews, I chose this one to be my first. This was so much easier than I ever dreamed it could be. Easy, delicious and perfect the first time! No need to look any further for another recipe.

well it served it's purpose.. i made ravioli out of the dough and i just couldn't get it thin enough.. maybe i'd need one of those pasta machines.. i used a medium egg and needed 4 T of water plus the 1 t of oil i added in order to make it workable.. i let it rest for well over an hour and a half and i know that helped.. i told bf that this is the last time i'm doing this so to enjoy his meal.. maybe making pasta just isn't my thing

Great pasta recipe. I had never made homemade pasta before -- I thought I needed fancy utensils or a pasta machine to do it. This was simple and delicious. I did follow the instructions in one of the reviews and let it dry before I put it in the boiling water. I served it with homemade spaghetti sauce and my family said it was the best pasta they ever had.

I've made a lot of pasta before, mostly with semolina flour, but never heard the tip about letting it rest before rolling and cutting it as your reviewers suggested.  Will try that next time! 

 Also great if the egg is whipped with herbs or vegies to equal the water, in a blender, before adding the flour.

This is so easy and delicious!!!  Thanks a bunch for the recipe.  I had never considered actually making pasta from scratch before I read this recipe, now I may never go back to store-bought!  I followed the directions exactly except that I forgot to add the salt.  I'll be sure to remember it next time, but it tastes great without it.

Yay! I can make my own pasta!!! I took other reviewers' advice and added 1 tbsp of olive oil, and cut back on the salt. I'm thrilled that I got perfect pasta on the first try. I'll be making this again and again, and sharing it far and wide.

This was so easy to make. I followed others' advice and added some olive oil to the recipe. I also decreased the salt the second time I made it because the 1/2 tsp was too salty for my taste. This is the second day in a row that I've made it...definitely a hit!

This was my first time making homemade pasta and it was great!  Much easier than I had thought it would be.  I substituted half of the water with olive oil. I only used half of the recommended salt, which I saw on one of the other reviews, but I will probably add the full amount of salt next time.

I tried to make this recipe last night. I followed the directions as well as some recommendations. I doubled the recipe, used half bread flour and half all purpose,and added some olive oil. I have never had fresh pasta, that I can recall so I'm not sure what this should taste like, DBF is Italian and comes from a family that knows pasta. He said it was off somehow. After I mixed it in my Kitchen Aid mixer, I kneaded it and let it rest for about and hour. It was a little tedious to roll out with a rolling pin, but I think I got it fairly thin. I let the noodles dry for a few minutes before I cooked them. They ended up coming out rather mushy and slimy. I think I may have over cooked them, I really don't know. The sauce I made with it was really good, but the pasta wasn't what I expected. I don't know what I did wrong. Perhaps I will make this again using semolina flour and only boil the pasta for a minute or 2 not the 3 or 4 I did. This was a good recipe to start with and would recommend it to someone who is just starting to make pasta, it seems like it is a good jumping off point.

I used this recipe after discovering I had no spaghetti for my Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce (also found on this site). I added a bit of dried basil to give it more flavor. Although I need to find a uniform way to cut the strips (I used a pizza cutter), they came out great! I think next time I will try using wheat flour (has anyone else tried this?) for a healthier version. Home made pasta tastes so much better than store bought, and cooks much faster! I forgot how great it is, and think I will only go back to store bought in a pinch.

This was a very easy pasta recipe! I ended up needing a bit more water than called for, but other than that I followed exactly. It definitely helps to let the dough relax. I would roll it out, wait a little while, and then roll again until it was nice and thin. I made lasagna noodles. This makes me really want a pasta maker now!

very flavorful. I was looking for a quick recipe for noodles to go with my crock pot beef. These noodles were the pefrect addition. The recipe made about one cup of thinner noodles I needed to double for my family of 4.

I made this recipe tonight for dinnner and used my pasta machine.  It worked out great.  Served with a pork butt cooked in the crock pot with marinara sauce.  I hardly ever get compliments from my husband and he said it wast excellent :0 :)!!
