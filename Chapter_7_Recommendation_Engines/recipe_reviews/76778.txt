Unusual dish! After reading the many conflicting reviews I had to make it. I followed others suggestions and cut the cumin down to 1/2 tbsp. and peanut butter to 1/2 cup.  I also added extra soy sauce.  I thought it was very good and was not put off by the scent or color.  Afterall, it is a peanut butter based sauce. I did add additonal steamed veggies as we are low carb people and avoid rice.  Will definitely make this again.

I don't know if she's right, but my momma said, "Thai don't have crockpots, and they don't slow cook" - I should have heeded her warning.

The recipe strikes me as a dummied down peanut satay.  A more authentic recipe would shish kebab the meat, wouldn't use onions at all (after 5 hours, they melt and make the sauce taste funny), nor bell pepper (contributes no flavor but also melts) and would use coconut milk instead of chicken stock.

Then there's the weirdness in the recipe - you put 3/4 C of fluid along with the chicken in a crockpot, and 5 hours later it's magically the 1 C to be used in step 2?  Huh?

When I discovered how much I didn't like this dish, I separated the chicken, rinsed it out in a colander, and added my own sauce.  This recipe became just a bad memory.

What a tasty dish! As per others' suggestions, I increased the chicken broth to 1 cup; decreased the peanut butter to 1/2 cup, the cumin to 2 tsps, and the crushed pepper to 1/4 tsp (not a big fan of "hot"); and added 1/2 tsp. curry powder. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I found 4-1/2 hours of initial cooking time to be perfect. The sauce was just right, not too spicy, but rich and flavorful, and with a nice consistency that was thick enough to spoon over spaghetti noodles (my substitute for Thai noodles) without being runny. I also disagree with those who said it didn't look appetizing. I sliced the red bell pepper into strips, and they added a nice confetti-like color along with the bright green cilantro garnish. All in all, a winner in my book!

This was very very good, The Chicken Satay is one of my favorites... I love how people change things and then say oh I didn't like this.... Read it first, if you don't like that kind of food don't eat it... I use my Crock Pot for EVERYTHING I can,I even convert alot of things which is very easy to do and they have instructions for that too,... It is very much a time saver for me and being disabled it helps out alot as I can not stand a long time or keep bending...Great flavor and if they want they can skewer the meat after and gee maybe throw it under a broiler for 3 min or so to get a little crispy.... Be inventive people and just because you make changes don't need to be rude about it, after all we all tend to change to our own taste...Thanks for a wonderful recipe great taste and wonderfully easy!!!

I was very disappointed in the nature of some of the reviews.  It does not take an expert cook to read a recipe and know you may not like it based on your personal tastes. This is a recipe exchange community not one for bashing food critic wannabes. First I would recommend as I do with ALL crockpot meat recipes...brown your meat first.  Add veggies mid way through and chop them fairly large.  I also added carrots, peas and celery.  I would say there is one thing missing that would make it great.  I am thinking ginger paste but didn't have any on hand.  Also the lime juice is a must.  My family loved it and as other reviewers said, don't skimp on the garnish.  Thank you for sharing and please ignore the ignorance in some of the reviews.  Please ALL let's keep  site reviews as what works, what doesn't and no matter what be grateful for the those who take the time to share their recipes, without them we wouldn't have such a great site to visit for new ideas.

I tried this recipe mostly out of curiosity and because I already had everything on hand.  I'm not sure if this is authentic or not (have never eaten Thai food) but it sure was good!  I used natural crunchy peanut butter and omitted the chopped peanuts at the end.  After adding the cornstarch, I let it cook about 50 minutes (waiting for my brown rice to cook) and it got a little too thick.  So next time, I would do only 1 TBS cornstarch in and not let it cook as long.  I only put in about half of the red pepper flakes.  My kids (a one-year old and three-year old) loved this and ate tons of it!

This was the best recipe for the slow cooker I have found yet (I've only had it one month).  It tasted like a restaurant made it.  I did use less peanut butter than it called for (only 1/2 cup) and it worked out fine.  I made the change for calorie reasons.  It's spicy and great.

I found this very tasty - OK, not as fabulous as at a Thai gourmet restaurant, but it's a crock pot recipe, for goodness sakes! The KEY is not to omit the garnishes (cilantro, peanuts, and green onions), and I added a lot of additional lime after I dished up each serving.

Different and delicious. I even prepared additional meals in large gallon freezer bags. Now I just pull out a freezer bag and cook it on slow for 10 hours, following step 4 on the day of cooking.

This recipe is good. It is not meant to be authentic thai food. It is meant for someone wanting to use their slow cooker and incorporate thai "like" flavor into a slow cooker meal. People are being too harsh on the recipe. If you have a urge for authentic thai food then  don't look up recipes in the slow cooker category. If you do not like spicy food then adjust the pepper and cumin. The reviews are for ideas and what worked and didnt not to bash it because it is not authentic. It is a good slow cooker meal for people who like pad thai sauce incorporated into a slow cooker meal.

I have to say, that for someone who does NOT like peanut butter, this was pretty darn good! I already had leftover chicken so I used that instead and follow the recipe (except for the 5 hours on the crockpot. Will do that next time because I LOVE my crockpot.. For my own taste, I added more lime juice (about another 1/4 cup) and 1/2 cup more chicken broth. I used Sesame seed oil to warm up the chicken (remember, I didn't do the crockpot part this time). Next time, I will reduce the peanut butter down to 1/2 cup as someone suggested (again, just MY personal preference), to save calories and to make the pb taste a little lighter. It definitely needs enough pepper flakes, but I added that at the end so my 7 year old could eat it and...she loved it! Served it with sesame green beans (green beans cooked with sesame oil, soy sauce and garlic) and coconut rice (rice cooked using 1/2 coconut milk + 1/2 water) and it was a total hit! Authentic or not, this is a keeper!!

Made this today for myself and my parents (husband can't stand peanut butter anything) and I have to say that it was surprisingly good, based on the mixed reviews.  I did cut back on the peanut butter to half a cup and when I thickened the sauce, I started with a tablespoon of corn starch, then cooked on high with the lid off the slow cooker.  Ended up spooning some sauce back out to add about another half tablespoon of corn starch and it was perfect.  I normally am not fond of red peppers, but I think they made this dish fantastic.  I had to give my parents a copy of the recipe before they left this evening, so I would say this one is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing it.

Geez people, I don't understand why so many reviews are so harsh on this recipe. It's good, who cares if it's authentic Thai or not as long as it is healthy with good flavor!!?? I made just as directed with absolutely no changes, served over angel-hair like pasta and my family really enjoyed this nice change of pace. I will make it again!

I hate to give negative reviews but because this is a "slow cooker" meal i dont want anyone to wait with anxious anticipation for hours on end just to experience the same disappointment that I did.  

I had a hard time getting through one plate of this stuff, good thing i halved it because i would have been upset at the thought of wasting anymore food.  

Typical thai food blends sour, sweet, hot this recipe fell short.  

I was very disappointed.

Not rich, not all that peanutty, and not spicy. I followed the recipe exactly. Vegetables were mushy. There would have been absolutely no texture without the peanut garnish. Edible but forgettable. Won't be making again.

Great base to launch a very different dinner. I only changed a little bit too! I didnt have enough lime juice (only 2 limes) so I added a tsp of sesame oil to make it a little more flavorful. Didnt have a red pepper so I used green, thumbs up! I also used a Kg of skinless Chicken THIGHS too, waay cheaper, and so tender! Just pulled the meat off of the bone around the 5 hour mark, took out the bones and added sauce. Oh and I reduced the amount of peanut butter to about 1/2 a cup. I made it with some instant rice spiced up with about a 1/4tsp of minced ginger(just a small squirt from one of those tubes) and 1/2 tsp minced garlic( again, tube stuff). I only had cashews and no green onions but with fresh cilantro from the garden and a few crushed cashews for texture, it was awesome!

I love this recipe! I found this recipe quite a few years ago on this website. I have been making it ever since. The only thing different I do is increase the chicken broth & soy sauce by 1/4 cup each.

We liked this. I added a green pepper in addition to the red and only added an hour before it was finished so they wouldn't get mushy. I found the sauce needed a little something sweet so I added a tablespoon of honey and that helped round out the flavours. The garnishes make a big difference in this dish, I wouldn't leave them out. I'd make this recipe again.

Once I was able to sift through all the criticizing of others and nitpicking and find REAL reviews of the RECIPE, it looks like something I would love to try. Thanks for the tips about liquid quantity and cooking tips. I look forward to making it soon.

I found the chicken gets over-cooked and very dry in the crockpot.  The ingredients should create a wonderful taste but I think the next time I would just do this on the stove and not cook so long.

Very good - quickly became a family favorite.  I left out the bell peppers, and instead added carrots and potatoes.  I also use Thai Garlic chili paste instead of the red pepper flakes.

I normally like anything thai especially anything thai in a peanut sauce so I was so excited that I found this and could do it in my crock pot! This recipe was a complete fail. It didn't smell good while cooking and the finished product was extremely unappealing visually for starters. If you check out some of the photos added for this recipe you will see what I mean. It was also completely lacking in taste. It was salty and way too much peanut butter (I even took into account other peoples posts and put 1/2 cup). The cornstarch turns this dish into a thick sludge type sauce. For anyone planning on trying this dish I would put 1 tablespoon of cornstarch MAX! I would also use a low sodium chicken broth to account for some of the saltiness (I think the soy sauce flavor is needed and should not be omitted to account for the salt content). I will never make this again.

I love Thai peanut sauce and I love slow cooking, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  It was really good and we gobbled it up!  The only changes I made were to increase the chicken broth to 1 cup and decrease the peanut butter to 1/2 cup.  If I make this again, I would probably keep those changes and also cut back on the cumin and add the red bell peppers more towards the end so they don't get mushy.  I know it's not "authentic," but we enjoyed it!

I use my slow cooker a lot, and this is absolutely the best recipe I have!  If you like spicy thai food, this is for you.  I serve it with jasmine rice.

This was wonderful!! we ate it over steamed rice with cilantro, peanuts and scallions, and it was great. By the end, the chicken was tender, the onions and peppers had melded into the sauce, and it was very creamy and flavorful. we like our Thai spicier, though; I think next time I will probably add more red pepper flakes and possible a little hot sauce. This would probably also be good with thigh meat, removing bones and skins prior to adding the sauce mixture at the end.

I had already bought all the ingredients before I read the reviews so I went ahead and made this.  It is NOT good.  I am used to a sweeter Thai sauce and should have been tipped off when the only sweet ingredient was the peanut butter, no coconut milk, etc. My family ate it but I will NEVER make it again.

This was really good, as a fan of peanut sauces it was right up my alley. I made with the full 2/3 cup peanut butter and think it could be good with less, but we really enjoyed it as written. I didn't add red pepper or onion as that long in the slow cooker would mush them up, I just used lots of pepper flakes, cayenne, and onion powder. As written it wasn't very spicy. I also used chicken thighs because I've had breasts dry out in my slow cooker, and threw in a bag of frozen stir fry veggies at the end to make up for the pepper/onion I left out. I made the recipe my own but as written this is a filling and flavorful meal, thanks very much for sharing.

Amazing! I so appreciate everyone's input because it made all the difference.  First, I also increased the broth to 1 cup and decreased the cumin to 2 teaspoons. I also decreased the peanut butter to 1/2 cup.  I also added the veggies with about one hour to go and added 1/2 teaspoon of chili garlic. This was AMAZING.  I served it with steamed broccoli and carrots and jasmine rice. I will DEFINITELY make it again! So wonderful!

I love Thai food and this was like peanutbutter chicken.  I had to freeze it untill I figure out how to make this edible.  I read some reviews and I think I will add coconut milk, red curry paste, snow peas, carrots, and bean spouts.  See how it goes.

We liked this one alot!  I'm not sure how authentic this Thai recipe is, as we've never eaten Thai before...but what a great Crock pot recipe for chicken!  I followed previous posters suggestions to use 1 cup of broth, and only 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  Great Dish

This recipe is fool proof.  I've made it for both sides of the family for family gatherings, and everyone finished it off both times.  It isn't too spicy for those who don't like spice, but it has enough to satisfy for those who do like flavorful food.  The second time I made it without the green onions and I couldn't tell much of a difference.  I do think the cilantro is a must.  I've even tried cooking it on low on the stove and it did fine.  It only cooked for about 4 hours or less instead of 6 (when on the stove).

This is so good. We love peanut chicken. I wasn't sure we would like this recipe. because of being made in the crock pot I was worried it might be a bit bland. but, it was perfect. The cumin gave just the right flavor. I didn't have any cornstarch, but the sauce was just right for us. Also, I used half the chicken and added yams.... yummy with this. Anyway, this is a keeper. thanks!

My family loved this and with 6 of us with varying tastes that is unusual.  We followed recipe but didn't have enough Peanut Butter. Next time we make it we will add some pepper slaw to add some crunch. My kids said the green onions and cilantro finish the dish well.  They all want me to make it again.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. Based on previous reviews, I increased the soy sauce and chicken broth, and added about one Tablespoon of curry powder. I also didn't add the vegetables until the last 30 minutes, and they were just the right texture.

The red bell pepper really added a beautiful color, and the toppings definitely stand out in this dish. I would maybe reduce the cumin next time just a bit, and add more curry.

This is an easy recipe which is nice.  I liked how I could cook a dish with Thai-flavors without a lot of exotic ingredients.  I made the recipe with the suggested reviewers' modifications like 1/2 cup of peanut butter only and used the whole can of chicken broth.    Overall, the dish was just bleh for me.  It was a little too salty but extra lime and the garnish does help.  My niece really liked the dish though and had seconds.  I don't like it enough to make it again or add it to my regular dinner rotation though.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe just wasn't for our family. My husband and I each ate one small serving and threw the rest out. The flavor was bland and the texture had a gritty feel to it. It was an easy recipe to make, but I won't be doing that again.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was so easy and very tasty, although I can't say it is as good as thai peanut chicken I've eaten at authentic thai restaurants.  I upped the chicken broth to 1 cup, reduced the peanut butter to 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 tsp curry and 1 cup of carrots.  The garnishes at the end are a must and the dish would not be good without them.  This was great reheated too.  We served it over brown rice one night and whole wheat spaghetti the next and it was delicious both ways.  I think it's only about 4 servings, though.

This tasted quite yummy (even if not "authentic"). One important point is to not put the peppers in until after the peanut butter, otherwise they literally dissolve. I would also increase by 50% the chicken stock, cumin, soy sauce so that the sauce covers the chicken completely in the crock pot. But the peanut butter/soy sauce flavor was quite good, and the chicken's consistency was equally as good.

This recipe is quite good.  I'm thinking of trying a few things differently next time:  more lime juice, more soy sauce, half of the cumin and some chicken thighs along with the breasts.

My family loved it (even the picky 7 year old).  I think it is important to use NATURAL peanut butter and not the processed sugar added stuff.  Perhaps those of you that hated it used the sweet peanut flavor goop that passes as peanut butter.  Next time I think I will add some lime zest to the final sauce.

It was just okay.  It needed a lot more zest.  Quite bland for my taste.

This is the worst thing I have ever made.  I couldn't even make my family eat it!  We love Thai food and this tastes nothing like Thai.  Sorry.  I should have listened to the other reviews.  I guess I know for next time anwyay.

NOt a favorite. Bummer since I took all the time in prep. The Peanut butter made it pasty and bland - needed more flavor. Won;t make it again.

Also works well with pre-made Thai peanut sauce in the jar that you can buy in the Asian aisle at the grocery store.

I absolutely hated this recipe.  I couldn't even finish my dish, I guess I will be having cereal for dinner tonight.  I love Thai food, so when I read the reviews that only gave it 1 star I thought it was maybe because they hadn't eaten a lot of Thai food.  That wasn't the case at all.  I am not sure why this is rated so high.  Unfortunately for me I didn't listen.  Don't make my mistake.

A good recipe for the slow cooker.  My only complaint was that it wasn't very appealling to the eye.  The red peppers were lost in the sauce and very mushy,  the only colour was added at the end with the cilantro.  But if you can get past how it looks it tastes terrific and I will be making it again.  I will be adding the peppers and onions later in the cooking process so that they don't totally disappear.

The garnishes make this dish!  Must use!  I followed others lead and upped chicken broth to 1 cup and decreased peanute butter to 1/2 cup.  Also added the red pepper 1 hour before finishing and it was great. I tasted the peanut butter sauce before I added it to the chicken - it seemed too strong on the lime.  But after adding it to the chicken mixture it balanced out.  I don't like red pepper flakes, so just didn't add.  Great over jasmine rice.  Next time will add broccoli with the red pepper.

A waste of good peanut butter. I normally love anything with peanut butter, and I have loved all Thai food that I purchased at a restaurant. My taste buds did not like this dish. After reading some of the other reviews I may try this again with less peanut butter.

Pretty good.  It doesn't taste like any Thai I've had, but I haven't had that much Thai so I'm not the best judge.  I thought it was a decent slow cooker meal.  I had a huge cut up chicken so I doubled the sauce and other ingredients and left the slow cooker on low for about 8 hours to make sure it cooked.  The meat just fell off the bone and was pretty good with that sauce.  For some reason I thought the sauce would be really thick, like gravy, but it wasn't--and it was pretty good.  As other reviewers mentioned, the garnishes are pretty important--allows for an extra punch of flavor that this dish needs.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't like this after the first few bites, but my fiance loved it and ate several servings. It's a divisive issue; you'll probably either think it's fantastic or it just won't be your cup of tea.

This was really good! I only added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter and I feel like that was more then enough! I also cooked it on high for 3 hours before making the sauce. I will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe for a busy day, I usually make Thai chicken the slow way. The only thing I changed was some Thai basil instead of cilantro. Serve over sticky or jasmine rice.

I followed the recipe but was in a pinch for time so I cranked my slow cooker up to high for 2-2.5 hours and then added the peanut/starch mix.  It turned out well and had great flavor.

Great, easy dinner...although it's been an hour since I've eaten it and I still feel full and a little weighed down.  Next time I'll know to eat less :)  As a previous reviewer suggested I decreased the peanut butter (I have a peanut allergy so I had to use soy butter) to 1/2 cup, increased the cumin to 2 tsp's and the chicken broth to 1 cup. I found a culinary broth (made by College Inn)called Thai Coconut Curry which I used for the chicken broth and also made the rice with.  I added frozen string beans right before I turned it to high.  It was pretty incredible and I'll be adding it to the monthly dinner rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for supper tonight, and I didn't really care for it, it was like something was missing (maybe the extra pb I left out).  Husband said it was okay. I followed the recipe, but like several had mentioned about the peanut butter, I added only 1/2 cup instead of the 2/3. Not sure what I was expecting, but sorry I wasn't impressed as others were.

Awesome recipe - we loved it! The only change I made was to put in chunky peanut butter (since that's what we buy), eliminating the need to buy peanuts separately. The chicken was very moist and the flavor was so tasty - esp. with the green onions and cilantro thrown in at the end.

Only ok, I also do a Peanut Butter Noodle from this site that is the same basic thing and MUCH better.  To be fair I used lemon instead of lime juice and only used 1/2 cup peanut butter which is why I gave this a 4 star.

I have only recently discovered Thai food, and I love it.  The main criticism of this dish is that it is not "authentic" and that may be, but don't let that keep you from trying it!  I loved this dish and so did my family.  We ate it while watching the Steelers win Superbowl 43!!  I decided to modify it just a little as some other reviewers suggested.  I added a half cup of chicken broth and decreased the peanut butter to a half cup.  I served it with Basmati rice and it was delicious.  I will certainly make this again and probably try to spice it up a little.  I actually started eating it without the garnishes of green onion, peanuts and cilantro and the recipe was a little bland.  I guess I was too into the game but once I realized I left the garnishes off I quickly added them and they make a HUGE difference.

Being married to a Thai, her dislike of a 5 hour slow cooker was apparent at the start But I made it anyway. Used the 14 oz of chicken broth, increased the fresh lime juice, & barely detected the peanut flavor.Added a dollop of sour cream day after & enjoyed it for lunch.May try adding some white wine next time.Not authentic Thai anyway so modify away.

I have not yet made this recipe but it sounds like it could be made (personalized) as one would do when they cook.  I found Sonnybkk's review to be rude and negative. Sonnybkk should not comment on anything unless she has something constructive to contribute...If you have a better way to cook it-DO SHARE! Use a little tact in the future.

I made the recipe just how it was written for an Asian Pot Luck Party.  Some of the people at this party are big time Asian cooks and they all agreed that it tasted great.  I too liked it.  By the end of the party the slow cooker was empty....

I agree, when I READ the recipe, it didn't sound "THAI" but it sounded GOOD (I like peanut butter). And it was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was tender, overall nice and juicy - plenty of sauce to cover the rice I served it over. My sister, who turned up her nose at the idea of it, loved it.

Great recipe, did not have lime juice or green onion, but added instead baby carrots to the crock pot, was wonderful. I also used whole chicken, it fell off the bone.

I enjoyed this. I made a few alternations based upon what I had. I used a powdered peanut butter called PB2 instead of peanut butter to cut the calories and fat and I added water chestnuts and snow peas during the last 45 minutes or so of cooking time. The sauce didn't thicken up for me well in the crockpot so i did that on the stove.  I served this over shirataki noodles and really enjoed my meal

This wasn't bad - upon the advice of others, I cut down the cumin.  For my personal taste, I'd add more spice (I like the Sambal Oelek groud chili paste for a good kick).

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish as it was a nice change of pace and easy to prepare. I added about 1 tablespoon of red curry paste to the mixture at the beginning. The flavors in the dish were excellent!

It was fine, a little on the bland side. Salt to taste helped. Wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be, but I used old-fashioned peanut butter.  Had it with instant brown rice, which went well.

Cumin can be very over powering when used in large amounts. Some individuals may find that this recipe yields even greater results when the cumin is reduced from 1 Tbsp. to 1/2 tsp.

This has to be one of the worst things I have ever made. My husband wouldn't even eat it and he'll eat just about anything.  It tasted like some kind of a spicy, peanut butter   mush.  I definitely don't recommend this one.

This recipe was amazing!  My husband and I both thought that, especially with the fresh garnishes, it was restaurant quality!  I put in a bit of sugar because I used sugarless peanut butter, and also upped the spice.  I also waited to add the pepper until I added the peanut sauce. That way, the pepper stayed a bit crunchier.  Everything was so flavorful, and great over rice!

This recipe is OK.  It is not for everybody.  The texture and looks of the sauce is not very apealing.  The taste is good, but it's needs something.  I'm not sure what it is.

It was OK. Not sure why but I just expected a little bit of sweetness to the sauce or a bit more flavor. I might make it again but not really soon. Chicken was tender though. Not a horrible dish, just not quite what I was looking for.

This was delish!!! Next time I will probably use low sodium chicken broth to cut the saltiness down a little. I also used natural peanut butter, the kind that doesn't have any sugar at all and after adding the lime juice the sauce was a bit too tangy so I had to add quite a bit of sugar to cut the tartness. My picky husband and two year old loved it and I even forgot to put on the garnishes. We will definitely make this again!!

This recipe was really good. I didn't used as much cumin just because someone said in another review that she did not.  I thought I could always add more.  I used chunky peanut butter, so I omitted the peanuts on top as garnish.  I did garnish it with cilantro and green onions.  It was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good warm peanut flavor with subtle undertones of cumin. The lime juice really helps to cut the sweetness of the peanut butter. After cooking in the crockpot for hours, the red chili's didn't have as much spice left as I would have liked. Next time I will be adding more red chili's. Husband approved of this dish... He even had seconds!

This recipe, in my opinion, really is OK.. not great, but not bad. I really do think the slow cooking onions are making it taste off. The flavor tastes more like a chicken, carrot, celery, onion slow cooker meal than what should be in a peanut butter sauce.

I made this tonight and served over rice - delicious!  I used boneless thighs instead of breasts but otherwise followed the recipe as written. The favors are subtle and using the crockpot made this an easy dish I'll make again.

My fiance and I LOVE this recipe, but we made some minor changes. Instead of cumin we used curry powder, mushrooms in place of red peppers and added 1/4 of a cup brown sugar to the peanut butter sauce. He ate this everyday for lunch for a week! It's one of our favorite dishes!

I made this using a roasting chicken and it was great! I did make a few changes... 1. I 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock, 1/2 cup of soy sauce, chilli powder instead of cumin, 1/6 cup of lime juice and 2 tbsp. of peanut butter for the sauce. There was a good taste of peanut butter and spice... overall a great dinner!

I really wanted to like it.  But it was just not right.  I ended up putting honey in it to make it more like satay sauce, and then it was edible.

We loved this, including the two kids under five. I never expect authentic anything from my own kitchen ;) I took the peanut butter down to half a cup, though I think we would have like the 2/3 cup. I added a bit of curry powder and also at the end I threw in a bag of stir fry veggies with the final mixture to add some bulk (I only had 3 chicken breasts). It was great. I will make it again.

This was simple and tasted good. It also reheated well. We added 1 cup of chicken broth, instead of 1/2. Also added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar at the end to cut the cumin and make the dish at little more robust. Also waited to add peppers and onions until about the last 45 minutes as to not overcook.

I have a peanut allergy so we subbed sunbutter and sunflower seeds for the peanutty ingredients, but otherwise made it exactly as listed.  My kids and husband raved about how much they liked it, and asked that this get into the regular menu rotation.

This dish really came out good. I think next time I would like to try it with dark meat maybe thighs. I thought the chicken breasts were a little over cooked.

Definitely a keeper recipe!  We loved it.  I'm so glad that I did not read the negative reviews until after we enjoyed the Thai Chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used chunky peanut butter.  We all thought it needed to be spiced up a notch--perhaps more red pepper flakes.  I'd add more cilantro as well.

I don't know what happened, but this was awful. I did use natural peanut butter, maybe that was the problem. But the peanut/soy ratio just seemed off. We threw it out without even eating one serving. I was quite dissapointed because with the ingredients I thought it was going to be great and I was really looking forward to it.

Finally, an easy to make Thai dish! I love Thai food, and I'm sometimes disappointed when it's not done right. I was skeptical of the recipe, but I was needing to make my own Thai dish without spending a lot of time. I was a little disappointed in the flavor at first. It's not quite as sweet as peanut sauce usually is. I don't have a sweet tooth, but for peanut sauce it should be on the sweet side in my opinion. I added a teaspoon of Peanut Butter to my bowl, and it put it over the top. Very tasty. Next time i will use at least a cup of PB and cut back on the soy sauce.

Really like this recipe, however, I did not have cornstarch and tried to sub flour and I guess I used to much had more of a thick gravy instead of sauce.  But was still good even better the next day.

This was tasty! Even my husband, who doesn't like chicken much, enjoyed it and said he'd eat it again. I followed the recipe exactly (except I added the onion and pepper about half way through, so they wouldn't disappear) and had no complaints! Thanks for sharing this!

This is the most delicious thing I have ever made in the crockpot.  Adding the pepper (I use red or green, or Trader Joe's frozen 3 pepper blend) about an hour before it's done is a good idea so it doesn't break down.  I also don't bother cutting up the chicken, and have even started with rock solid frozen chicken breasts, and it's turned out great.  I usually do reduce the peanut butter to 1/2 cup.  All in all I can't even say how much I love this recipe!!!!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Next time I will not follow the advice to cut the peanut butter, I am a big PB fan and think a more peanuty flavor would be great. Also, I will add a little more chopped peanuts to the garnish. The crunch factor is great. I will also add the red peppers when I add the sauce ingredients so they don't melt away. Tasty!

This tasted alright, but it looked totally unappetizing.  It gets four stars because my husband liked it, but I didn't like it as much as he did.  Next time I would cut almost all of the soy sauce and replace it with stock, and maybe stir in coconut milk at the end.  And cook it less, maybe browning the chicken beforehand.  The vegetables were almost unrecognizable.  It was good over basmati rice.

For a slow cook recipe, it was good.   Increased chicken broth as others suggested. I decreased the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and added more cumin. Also added curry as another reviewer suggested and added extra lime juice in the second phase.  Next time would add more peppers and red peppers.  Also would add some ginger. Also would suggest creaming the peanut butter mixture before adding it back to prevent the breakdown appearance.   Husband preferred the peanut garnish whole rather than crushed. Served over brown rice.  So easy to make.

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  The sauce was great - but only if you like peanut butter.  It was wonderful to come home and have dinner ready to go.  Definitely recommend anyone try it who likes Thai inspired food.

So delicious! And easy. Everyone raves when I serve this. Three times this month. I add lime leaves and (frozen, minced) lemon grass to the slow cooker - because I have it and it adds that little extra flavour.

This was delicious, but next time I think I'll add something for some spice. I threw in a big pile of cilantro instead of just using it for garnish. Will certainly make again!

Interesting.  I love sataay chicken and thought this would be a simple variation on a traditional sataay chicken recipe, however the recipe was missing something.  Next time, I would try pan frying/baking to get a different result.  I made these with the Thai Chicken Balls for a Thai Night.

Here's the key - cook this like real thai food, instead of in the slow cooker. I used a wok, cooked the chicken, took it out, added the onions and peppers and cooked those until translucent, then added the chicken back, along with everything else. It cooked up beautifully, the cilantro was still fresh, the flavors fantastic. I wouldn't cook this in a slow cooker if I were you... I'd get out a big wok!

I was excited about making this dish because it was unlike anything I'd ever tried before.  I'm so glad I did! My family raved about it, I also doubled the sauce.  The chicken and sauce does look a bit unappetizing, but dressed up on a bed of rice with the green onions, cilantro, and roasted peanuts, it was perfect. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great change of pace for a slow cooked meal.  I highly recommend making Asian Coconut Rice with it.  I added fresh ginger to the peanut sauce, but that's the part my kids didn't like (hubby and I did though).  I think the recipe would be fine without the ginger.  I did add more broth (1 cup) and less cumin (2 tsp.) like other reviewers.  Definitely give this one a try.

Thanks for a great recipe!  Next time I will reduce the peanut butter by half as it was a little too much and started to get overpowering the more you ate.   Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe was EXTREMELY too peanutty! The chicken cooked nicely in the slow cooker, however the sauce was just way too overpowering. I felt for a flavor that strong it should have had a little more of a spicy kick to it. Use less peanut butter.

This was a great recipe!  We served it over a bed of brown rice and loved it!  I would only have wished for it to be a little more spicy, so will add more red pepper next time.  Definitely a keeper - thanks!

Very good flavor. I prepared exactly as directed....it was a bit soupy and I probably would cook it a little shorter the next time as the red peppers just sort of blended into the mixture. I served it over egg noodles in a bowl and with the toppings it was delicious. I would make it again. Thanks.

My family loved this!  I'll definitely be making it again.  I added only 1/2 cup PB, instead of 1 cup.  Very tasty!

We (the two adults in the family, the 4 year old did not eat it) really enjoyed this when I took suggestions from some other reviews. I used coconut milk, not chicken broth. I added a bit more garlic. I cut the cumin in half. And, I used chicken thighs (with bone). We cooked enough to have the night of and the next day for lunch, both were fine. I served it with brown rice. I was asked to keep the recipe to make it again.

Don't know why I tried this recipe...don't like the chicken breast, don't like crockpots and cannot eat red bell peppers.  I used the whole thighs, substituted julienned carrots for the peppers and used a large heavy skillet to cook with.  Seared the thighs in a little olive oil then proceeded with the rest of the recipe, simmering for one hour total.  Served over rice noodles and slivered cabbage and carrots.  OMIGOSH...it was incredible!  Hubby loved it!  I did use a few extra red pepper flakes because I love spicy hot and plan to use this recipe many more times with wild duck and pheasant as well.  Thanks for sharing!

Was very good but I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the broth to one cup and decreased the pb to a half a cup.  I used chicken thighs and only took 4 hours to cook.

I did like this recipe, but made an adjustment to the ingredients. I cut back on the peanut butter, to 1/2 cup, no peanuts on top and DID NOT use cornstarch. I really hate cornstarch, I used flour instead. Also, I felt this recipe need something else, so when I served it, I added chopped cucumber with the cilantro, it needed this! Also, do not add any salt, this recipe was too salty with the soy.

People, don't say the recipe is "okay" and then give it 5 stars. What the heck? If its okay, it gets 3 stars at best.  Let's try to use the star system to our advantage.  This was ok, not great, not 5 stars.

I'm still deciding if I liked this sauce or not.  I served it over thin noodles which was nice.  I also followed suggestions by adding the pepper and onion later and they were not too mushy.  It did not have any overpowering flavors and wasn't bad but I doubt I'll ever end up making it again.

I just made this tonight! Yum it was good! I was a little put off by the Peanut Butter and the fact that I have never had Thai food, but it was good. I did increase the Chicken broth to 1 cup, but left everything else the same except for the end with cilantro, green onions and peanuts. I love cilantro, but I'm glad I didn't add it to it. I think it would of changed the taste to much. I served over egg noodles (cooked with water and the rest of the chicken broth), stirfry veges with extra corn added. Thanks for the recipe!- I wont change the stars- but I tried this again and didn't like it at all. I didn't add a cup of chicken broth or serve over noodles so maybe that made the difference or just my taste has changed.

Great recipe! The chicken was a little bland, but the sauce more than made up for it. So tasty! The ingredients are a bit unusual, but once you get past that, the taste is delicious!

I really liked it. 

The sauce came out as a gravy which inspired me to make mashed potatoes with it... with some veggies on the side. 

if you love peanut butter then this dish is for you.

This was just ok.  The idea behind thai food is to balance sweet, salty and spicy and this dish lacked the sweet part.  I added some honey, substituted half the say sauce with fish sauce and instead of chicken stock I used coconut milk.

We did not like it - VERY peanut buttery flavor.  The chicken was a little rubbery - not a good combo.  We deemed this a "non-repeater".

I served this to my Thai mother-in-law who is a very picky eater and she loved it. Instead of cilantro, I used fresh Basil which was delicious and I noticed my MIL added more soy sauce to her serving, so next time I will increase the qty of soy sauce. A great and easy to make recipe!

We really enjoyed this dish. I made it as written and thought it was perfect. The sauce wasn't too thick, wasn't too peanut-buttery (I used Skippy's reduced fat creamy PB), and it just had a hint of spice. I served it on top of steamed rice. As for some of the comments that it looked unappealing, I thought it looked fine... Chicken with a brown sauce (because of the pb)... in addition to the taste, the red bell peppers and cilantro is nice for presentation. I will definitely make this again!

I prepared this exactly as the recipe is written and it was fantastic!  My husband took one bite and exclaimed, "Wow, this is a 'do again' recipe!"  It fit perfectly into my new 2-1/2 quart crock pot.  The only mistake we made was staying home the day it was cooking...the wonderful aroma made it difficult to wait until it was ready to eat.  I served it on brown rice.

This tastes really good! I made several changes though. I only used 3 chicken breast pieces instead of 6, but didn't cut the other ingredients in half. I like a lot of sauce. I added a large carrot, sliced diagonally and increased the chicken broth to one cup. I don't like a lot of cumin - it's very over powering - so I decreased it to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger. I served it over boiled thai rice noodles and it was a hit with my husband who has a bit of a gourmet palate. My 4 year old ate it. I didn't ask her if she liked it, but it wasn't too spicy for her. It made a pretty dish with the addition of whole peanuts, green onion and cilantro (a must). If you can get them, bean sprouts would make a nice addition after the cooking is done.

I needed to add about 1/4 cup of Franks's Red Hot Sauce and it was to die for.  My husband and son didn't appreciate the dish but they're pretty picky. I'm sitting here eating leftovers for lunch (which reminded me to post a review) and I'm still loving it. I would say that it's definitely for the mature taste bud...Thanks DELTAQUEEN

This may be my favorite recipe from this site!  I do love peanut butter, soy sauce and cilantro - the 3 main flavors.  I used 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup peanut better, and omitted the corn starch because, after making this 3 times, I realized I like a thinner sauce.  Served over jasmine rice.  A real family favorite!

I made pretty major changes, so I don't know how fair it is to call this a review...I used a can of chickpeas instead of chicken breasts, twice as much red pepper flakes and a chunk of grated ginger. I served it over brown rice and steamed broccoli and it was really quite good. It would have been better had I not forgotten the green onions and chopped peanuts, but I'll definitely make it again. Tasty tasty.

It was good, but like others also noted, it needed something. I actually added garlic chili sauce (found in the asian aisle) to it to spice it up some more. My husband also found it weird to be served with rice instead of thai noodles. If I make it again, I will replace the rice with thai noodles & spice it up some more. I also was in a time crunch so I cooked it in 1/2 the time w/the crockpot setting on high.

Sometimes slow cooker meals taste a bit blah but not this one.  It had a great sauce and was full of flavor.  Great for a cold winter night!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  I actually started too late in the day to do this in the slow cooker, so I made the sauce on the stove, using all the ingredients in this recipe.  It worked great!  I baked the chicken breasts and steamed the peppers and onions, then tossed it all in the peanut sauce just before serving.  It was delicious over rice, sprinkled with some fresh cilantro.  There is plenty of sauce left over, so I'm sure we'll be enjoying this in a few days, too.

I never had Thai before, it is a good recipe for a change of pace. The chicken stayed quite moist and tender, I added some extra peanuts and served it with white rice. I will probably make this again. I only give it three stars, not because it is a bad dish but it was just good.

Very good Chicken dish. I served with sauteed green beans and Jasmin Rice. Would have liked a slightly less tangy yet slightly sweeter sauce. Oh well... it was still quite good. Will most likely make again.

Turned out great.  Best thai chicken recipe I have tried thus far.  Easy and tasty.  Used frozen chicken tenders (thawed first), and didn't require cooking as long, done in about 4 hours. Also added some bean sprouts and snow pea pods towards the end.  The garnishes set it off.  Highly recommend.  Spicy and delicious.

This was really tasty and easy to make.  I served it with white rice and it went over well.  The peanut butter, peanuts, and cilantro give it an exotic taste.  Chicken breast has a tendency to dry out but this was really moist.

I didn’t have “time” to do this in the slow-cooker (ha!) so I improvised. Made the chicken in the Instant Pot while I prepped the other ingredients and made the sauce and noodles on the stovetop. Delish!

I'm one of the haters of this recipe! I found it uninteresting because it tasted like peanut-butter chicken. However, there appear to be many that liked it so, perhaps you should ignore my review :-)

Made with tofu instead!
Don't add chicken. Cook the veggies and sauce normally. Bake the tofu separately, then add it in with the veggies and sauce for the last ~15 minutes of high cooking with the sauce.

This was delicious. I didn’t have time to slow cook so I modified the times and cooked it on the stove, 20 minutes for the chicken with broth and then 10 more minutes after adding the peanut sauce. I also added zucchini to make it a little heartier.

Very easy and tasty recipe. I didn't have enough peanut butter so I subbed almond butter for 1/2 c total (1/4 each). Based on other reviews, this probably helped it from being overly peanutty. We will make this again.

We really liked this dish!  Didn't add red pepper & used thighs because it's what I had on hand.  Substituted coconut milk & a splash of water for the chicken broth.  Added 1.5 TBS of ginger paste and about a TSP of garlic powder when making the last part with the peanut butter.  YUM!

You know, the first few bites of this I wasn't crazy about, but as I at e more I liked it more!  I did used about 1 cup of chicken broth and then just drizzled more soy sauce in there too.  I reduced the cumin to 1/2 Tbsp and used 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I added broccoli to this, which I'm glad but would actually do it in the last 30-60 minutes next time.  It was pretty mushy.  I did not have any cilantro or green onion, and I know it would have been even better with that.  Really nice recipe!

This is really good IF you remember the garnishes at the end.  For some reason, not adding those makes this taste like peanut butter spread on a piece of chicken, but the garnishes really bring it all together nicely.  Oh.  And DO cut the peanut butter in half.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and I think I'm glad I did.

Terrific easy recipe for Thai food lovers. If you like any heat at all triple the amount of red chili flakes otherwise worked great exactly as listed. On our slow cooker I ran this 2 hours on High then about 4 on Low and came out great.

I was scared to make this because of some of the reviews on here, but I just went for it! I too cut the peanut butter in half (I used natural salted), and cut the cumin in half as well. I used a little extra red pepper flakes, and kept everything else the same. It. Was. FABULOUS! The hubby and I absolutely loved it. We had it over brown rice. It was even better the next day! I'm glad I made it, and I will definitely be making this again.

Loved this dish.  I took the advise of other reviewers and only did the 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  I also added about 1/8 cup of fish sauce that added a great little punch to the meal.

did not have a very good flavor at all. Neither my husband nor me enjoyed this at all. I thought that this would be yummy since I make a similar dish with pork, that it may be good but I was wrong.  not sure what could be done to make this better.

It's made this of course with a few changes, I cooked the chicken with olive oiI, red onions, red peppers and garlic cloves. I didn't use as much soy sauce or peanut butter. I did add a dash of ginger. My family and I loved it. I will definetly make this again!

I made this recipe exactly as directed. It was enjoyable. I wood agree with other reviews to reduce the amount of peanut butter and cumin. This wasn't very spicy. Depending on your taste you may want to kick up the heat a bit with more crushed red pepper.

This dish was extremely tasty, and if there was a downside, it's that it really didn't look at all appetizing - it came out of the crock pot as a mass of beige meat. But the garnishes mostly took care of that problem.

I LOVE it!  I am making it again tonight, and the only change I will make is to add veggies.  Sweet potatoes, cauliflower, zucchini, carrots, green beans - any of them would be great in this dish.  I am diabetic so I don't have it woth rice, but I don't even miss it.  I wouldn't change one thing about the spices and ingredients aside from more veggies.

With rice, serves 8. Kept the spices as written instead of reducing as other reviewers suggested, and it worked great!

The sauce actually had a decent consistency for the ratio of sauce to chicken, but the flavor was so overpowering it was inedible.

My husband really liked this. I thought it was a bit bland. I did a half cup of peanut butter which I thought was perfect but there didn't seem to be the Thai kick that I was looking for. Could be the little amount of red pepper flakes I held back?

This really needs some changes. The bell peppers are complete mush after 5 hrs so they need to be cut very thick or added half way through cooking. Sauce is very sweet something either more lime juice or pepper flakes might help out. I served mine over white rice that helped give the dish a more complete taste.

This is a staple at our house.  We've recently gone mostly meatless so I do it with some veggies and just cook it an hour in the crock.  The only change I made whether meatless or with chicken is that I always add garlic hot pepper sauce.

Awful.  I never give reviews, certainly not negative ones.  I wish I had read the negative reviews beforehand.  I didn't expect gourmet thai from a crockpot but I did expect something edible.

The family loved this!  I served it with Udon noodles and a buffet of toppings- shredded carrots, bean sprouts, blanched snow peas, cilantro, chopped peanuts, green onions. Everyone loved creating their own noodle bowl for dinner.  Also served with a simple side salad of cucumber and red onion with Asian dressing.

Definitely worth trying. I really liked it, but my boyfriend thought it was too salty. Next time I'll cut out the soy sauce, and use more chicken broth instead. Also, I'd recommend adding more veggies-maybe peas. I thought the flavors blended together nicely.

After reading the reviews, and re-reading the recipe, I decided to make some alterations.  I sauteed the chicken and onion in sesame oil, fresh chopped garlic, about 2 tsp. of sesame seeds and 2 tablespoons (yes TABLEspoons) of Thai season which I made from stuff in the pantry.  I added the stock and simmered it for about 2 hours on high.  I added 1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup lemon juice.  I made the peanut sauce with the peanut butter, more lime and lemon juice and soy sauce (scant because it is so salty).  I stirred the bell peppers in and the sauce and simmered another 1/2 hour.  Use the toppings and serve over rice.  Really really delicious.  The homemade thai seasoning had sea salt, black pepper, garlic granules, onion powder, toasted cocoanut, chili pepper, cayenne, crystalized ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and hmmm, oh yeah cumin.  This was good with the adjustments.  I eliminated the cornstarch.  The peanut butter thickens it nicely.

LOVED this, so did my 3 and 4 year old. This tastes as good as the stuff from the best Thai resturant in our city and very close to the stuff from Thiland. I didn't alter the recipie hardly at all The only two changes I made, I had no red pepper flakes so I used a red pepper in it and I only used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch the rest I left alone. I tried to cut back the peanut butter as others had suggested but found that there was too much lime flavor. We will be making this ALOT

My husband LOVES Thai food but he did not love this. He said there was way too much cumin in it(even though I put in less then the recipe calls for). He only ate a few bites and my kids wouldn't go near it.

The sauce was really thick, and a little overwhelming.  If it was thinner, this recipe would be fabulous.

This was a simple recipe to make. My husband said the dish was a "Do not make again" but my four Children said they liked the peanut butter flavor & woulod eat this dish again so I guess our family was a toss up.

Definitely not what we liked.  I had only a couple of bites and my husband was hungry so eat at a little more, but we didn't eat the rest.  Not something I'd make again.

We absolutely loved it!  I followed the suggestion to reduce peanut butter to 1/2 cup and increase broth to 1 cup.  Other than that, I followed recipe as written.  I served it over basmati rice and went heavy with the garnishes.  It was wonderful - perfect for a cold, snowy, Cleveland day.

I made this for a bunch of friends, and they all loved it.  One even said, "if I was going to have an IV of food going in my mouth, I would want it to be this food."  The only changes I made were to add more seasonings-I added a bunch of minced garlic, garlic salt, and Emeril's Original Essence.

This dish (using the recipe as printed) is GREAT! I made this for our super bowl gathering, and all the way from kids to college students to adults like us loved it. The ONLY thing I would do is squeeze some fresh lime juice on top when serving, in addition to the the cilantro and crushed peanuts. I'm eating the leftovers now and I'll definitely be making this again!

I think we are just not in to Thai.  I have never cooked with peanut butter before so I was questioning this recipe from the beginning if this one was for me.

I made this exactly as per the recipe - it was fantastic! The only change I will make next time is to put the capsicum (peppers) in towards the end of the cooking time, probably with some green beans - that would make it 5 stars. I would also call this Satay Chicken rather than Thai Chicken, but I'm not going to quibble when it was so good - it was over 45C (that's 114F!!) today, so it was great to have a tasty meal with so little effort.

This was good.  I gave it four stars because it needs something to offset the sauce. Maybe some veggies or something. Either way, we still ate it two nights in a row, the leftovers were just as good at the first night.

I decided to make this based on the ingredients but was slightly concerned because of the reviews. My family LOVED this dish and it was so easy to make. I did add more broth and less peanut butter like suggested. I also started this meal at 4 pm so I cooked it on HIGH and it was done by 7pm.I cut up the chicken in bite size pieces and served over rice. The key is not to skip the garnish. I chopped lots of cilantro, green onions and some peanuts. I served it with lime wedges on the side. Yum!

I tried this recipe tonight for something different.  We like all kinds of ethnic foods with rich flavor.  I added a tad bit more salt to it, but followed the recipe as it was.  The chicken was very tender and moist.  I served it over pad thai noodles.  I thought it was very good for a crock pot dish.  Thanks.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is a keeper.  Everyone was reluctant with the peanut butter, but it was awesome.  Did it exact to the recipe except my husband added more broth and mushrooms.  Still very good.

If there was an option to give this no stars, I would.  I LOVE Thai food, I make Thai food  I thought maybe the people giving it bad reviews didn't know about real Thai food.  Now I know that the only people who like this are people who either don't know what real Thai food tastes like or they have no taste buds.  I should have known better when I read that you combine peanut butter and red bell peppers in a crockpot.  Should have used fish or peanut sauce and coconut milk.  Actually, should have just make it like I normally do by stir frying the proper way.  Needless to say, I rinsed all the chicken off, stir fried it with some rice noodles, and ate it that way.

I made this recipe primarily as written except some minor adjustments to the amounts based on the amount of chicken I had.  I also added a squirt of sriracha sauce before the final 30 minutes to add some heat.  Turned out great!  I'll definitely be making this again.

My husband liked this, I hated it.  I used low-salt soy sauce and coconut milk instead of chicken stock, but I still found it salty.  The sauce was overpowered by the cumin, I couldn't taste the peanut butter.

This dish has a very unusal flavor.  I have never had much Thai food so I don't really know exactly what it is like, but this was very different.  The first few bites neither my husband or I liked it.  The peanut butter and the lime togther was an odd combination.  After the first few bites though it was good.  A great change of pace.  I will make this agian, but not very often.

The flavor was not what I was expecting it to be.  All I could taste was the red pepper flakes and all of the other flavors got lost.  I wouldn't make this again.

I loved this! We had friends over and they had brought some food with them, which they promptly abandoned to eat my Thai Chicken.  The cilantro and ground peanuts on top gave it an extra oomph.

This was quite tasty.    Didn't have the red pepper so didn't use it and it was fine.  I cooked the peanut sauce on the stove and added the slow cooked chicken to it.  Husband really liked it, the kids just thought it was ok.  You know how kids are.  If it isn't chicken nuggets it's just ok.

I'm afraid that I had a lot of problems with this recipe: the unappetizing color, bland, slightly grainy taste/texture, mushy veggies.... I had to add curry paste, thai fish sauce, and extra garlic to make it passable.

Maybe I set my expectations too high for this recipe. I really did think I'd like it. It was a little too peanutbuttery.. could be the brand I used, not sure. It was just okay for me but my husband just did not like it and I didn't have the heart to make him finish. He ended up at McDonald's for his dinner. *sigh* I've got leftovers for a few days!

I made this for an intimate dinner party and we all loved it!  It did have a rather unattractive brown color, but that didn't stop us from devouring it.  I am already craving it again!

An absolutely delicious dish.  My husband and I both loved it.  We fought over who would take the leftovers to work for lunch.

I liked this one a lot - i had to add more chicken broth and I accidentally put too much lime in it and it made it odd. . . but I would definitly do this one again.

Everyone in the family liked this dish.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which I think worked well.  The only thing is, I wish this had more of a kick to it.  If I do make it again, I'll throw in some red curry paste.  I too used a whole can of chicken broth (we like a lot of sauce), and served over basmati rice.  It thickened a bit too much, but I just added a little bit of water to thin.  The fresh cilantro garnish really brought out the flavor for me.

Everyone loved this dish, but I for one found it a little too peanut-buttery. It didn't have as much of a Thai flavor as I would have liked. I think it needs more of a punch and more color. On that note, it was a hit with my family.

This was very good, but I tweaked it a little.  1/2 tsp. of curry added a nice flavor.  I added two fresh hot peppers from the garden and omitted the red pepper flakes.  Since many reviewers said it was too thick, I added only 1 Tbsp. of cornstarch and used a whole can of chicken broth.  Then to complete the dish, I did not put it back in the crockpot, but put it in the microwave until it got hot and reached a "just right" consistency.  My husband and the kids loved it!

We weren't big fans of this one.  I said it was too salty.  My husband said it had a weird taste.

it was okay.  I thought the chicken got a bit dry, and the sauce wasn't as saucy as I woul've liked.  I served it with basmati rice which added a nice nuttiness to the dish.  I'll make it again, since it's so easy, but I'll probaby play around with the time and liquid amounts.

The flavor was pretty good, but the sauce was way to thick, nearly a paste. Have extra chicken broth on hand to modify the thickness of the sauce.

Absolutely loved this!  I added more garlic and lime juice because I like lots of flavor.  This is one I will be craving.

Excellent! Quick "taste of Thailand" recipe. I used half the chicken for more sauce, used a full teaspoon + of red papper flakes and served with Jasmine rice.

This was just okay...the chicken strips morphed back into a whole chicken while cooking for the first 5 hours, and I had to add another 1/3 cup of soy sauce to bring some life back to the sauce...not horrible, but there are other things that I would cook before this will be served again.

What a great recipe!!!  I improvised a little; we didn't have red peppers.  I also added 6 potatoes cubed instead of using rice, so it was a wonderful stew!  Because of the potatoes, I doubled all of the sauce ingredients.  My husband LOVED it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipie was pretty darn good.  I think it needed quite a bit more of a kick.  I added some Cayenne Pepper it gave the right kick but not the right taste.  I'm not sure what to add to give it a tad more spice.  But all in all it was very good and yes, I would make it again.

Not an authentic Thai dish but easy to make and tasty enough. I quite liked the flavour but my Husband said it was just alright.
