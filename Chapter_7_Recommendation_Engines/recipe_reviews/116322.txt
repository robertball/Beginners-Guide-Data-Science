Yum! I used about 1 1/2 sweet potatoes and mashed everything together. We had it with Chicken and peas. I will make again!

These were great, the topping was perfect...even better the next day reheated.  I wouldn't change a thing.  But as someone suggested I think I am going to try these mashed...yum!

Very good, quick and easy. Forget the foil, just toss the spud on the rack.  Turn after 30 minutes and bake for another 30. Cut end to end and pop out the good stuff. Mash with a fork. Chop up a few pecans and blend into the topping. Spread and enjoy.

First of all, YUM! I never liked sweet potato's before, now I'm eating leftovers like crazy! 
I did make some changes: I added a dash of ground ginger. Since I made this for Thanksgiving dinner I multiplied the recipe by 4 but used 9 medium sweet potato's, I peeled and sliced the potato's and layered them in a 13 x 9 pan then melted the other ingredients in the microwave and poured them over the potato's. Covered the whole thing with foil and baked for 1 hour.

Yummy!  I always just use butter and brown sugar but the honey was a nice addition and the cinnamon was a VERY nice addition.  Thanks!

This is great! I made two potatoes and doubled the topping. I would not do that next time. The amount of topping recommended for one potato is sufficient for two potatoes. Next time, I think I will leave out brown sugar and go with a cinnamon honey butter topping.

Mashed 4 small sweet potatoes and doubled the recipe, mixed it in with the mashed potatoes and it was sooo good! Could have tripled the recipe but I think the sweet potato is sweet enough and didn't need it.

Amazing! I had a huge potato, so I microwaved it and then wrapped it in tinfoil, chucked it on the grill. I topped my potato and it was very tasty.  I may cut the brown sugar a little bit, but the honey and cinnamon really make a nice flavour. Definitely will use this again!

This recipe was quite yummy.  My husband, who is not much of a sweet potato fan, enjoyed this side dish.  His only request was that he wanted more of the topping.  For future meals, I will double the topping recipe per sweet potato.

This was very good and simple to make. I doubled the recipe, but mashed the sweet potatoes and stirred in the remaining ingredients to the mash. I cut the brown sugar down to 7 tsp though. Will make again.

This recipe was so delicious!  I ran out of honey, so I replaced light Karo syrup for 2/3 of the honey but it still turned out great!  I will definitely be making this one again!

You don't even have to bake these in the oven if you don't plan on eating the skin.  Just pop in the micro--same delicious flavor! And you can have them year round and not heat up the house.

I had a couple of small sweet potatoes left from Thanksgiving so I thought this would be a great recipe to use them up.  It was very good!  And easy!  I just put the 2 potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes.

When I decided to make this, I didn't realize it had 2 Tblsp. of butter and 2 Tblsp total of sugar per small sweet potato. I tried it on half of one and it had a good flavor. Once mixed in the potato, it dissapears and just looks like a mashed sweet potato. The only change I made was using butter with canola oil to reduce the saturated fat. I may be a simpleton, but I actually like the taste of sweet potatoes as is. I usually just add a small spoon of butter. I think they are sweet on their own. So, not a repeat recipe, for me, but interesting to try.

So delectable.  Perfect side for Thanksgiving dinner.  In my opinion tastes better and more elegant in presentation than a bowl of candied yams. Be careful not to cut the X opening on top of the potato too deep, otherwise it will not stand as prettily when you mix in the toppings.  I had 5 medium size sweet potatoes and 60 minutes baking time was more than enough.

This is excellent!  Although *small* potato does mean small... we had some jumbo ones and they took about 2 hours to get soft.  But it's great!!

Yummy!  This reminds me of the sweet potato at my favorite steak house.  I sprinkled a little salt on top.  Thanks!

Delicious! The honey is an excellent addition, this is definitely a more decadent baked sweet potato. Walnuts or, ideally, pecans would be an excellent addition. Thanks for sharing!
