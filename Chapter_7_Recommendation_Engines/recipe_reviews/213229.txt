Good base recipe.  What I found to be wrong with these is the recipe does not mention the excess water that comes from baking the mushrooms.  Mushrooms carry so much moisture and they just filled the bottom of the pan with water.  I think if I make these again I will use a rack in the bottom of the pan to keep the mushrooms from the water.  My boyfriend thinks the recipe is worth 4 stars, I said 3.  I will use this again with some changes.

I don't know why cottage cheese is used instead of Ricotta cheese.  Cottage cheese to me is more of a substitute for cream cheese (same type of flavor).  I used Ricotta cheese and it tasted wonderful.  Also, after reading another review, I tried baking this on a rack to drain the mushrooms.  It didn't work because I believe the mushrooms need to be on the pan for the full heat of the pan in order to cook.  I wound up putting them in the microwave for a minute each because the mushrooms weren't cooked and then put them under the broiler with the sauce & cheese as indicated but this time without that rack.  They did release a lot of juice, but I just poured it off.  It was fine.  

1 more thing: if you change the serving amt, do not change the eggs. i.e. if you want 6 servings, the "calculator" will triple all the ingredients.  Do not put in 3 eggs.  You still only need 1 egg.  When I make regular lasagna I only use 1 egg regardless of whether I use 1, 2 or 3 lbs of ricotta.  It's just there for the texture.  3 eggs would be FAR too much.

Thanks for a great alternative to using pasta.  My neighbor is disabled and I cook for her twice a month as a treat and a favor.  She is on a gluten free diet & I was getting tired of just baking chickens with sides of rice & veggies.  What a wonderful alternative this was.  She LOVED it!!  Thank you for posting it.  Without the cottage cheese, I rate this 5 stars.  It's a very delicious recipe!!!

I am eating these right now and they are PHENOMENAL.  I used Ricotta cheese rather than cottage cheese but will try it with cottage cheese another time for sure.  I used portobello mushrooms and this is one of my favourite recipes I have gotten off of web sites.  Thanks!

Restaurant-quality stuffed mushrooms!!  I used cream cheese instead of cottage cheese and added a dash of oregano.  Tip: Before filling the mushrooms, salt the mushroom caps and bake them in the oven for about 5 mins, then drain the excess water.

I used regular white mushrooms because I wanted them to be bite size.  AMAZING!!!!  I used a teaspoon to take the stems out and a frosting bag to pipe in the filling.  WORTH IT!

I had a friend who is allergic to gluten in town last weekend so I tried this recipe. My whole family thought it was delicious and they can picky eaters.  I think garlic would be a great addition to this recipe for a little more flavor.  We also added some extra meat to ours which made it extremely filling.

Edible but no rave reviews.  This sounded like a perfect combo for my family but it just wasnt great.  Almost as much work as regular lasagna and we'd much prefer that anyway.

Yum! Great recipe. A great alternative, to make this more lasagna like, is to cook/add Acini di pepe pasta! I am in love with stuffed mushrooms but am picky about what goes in them... great recipe!

My husband loved this meal!  I too enjoyed it.  However, I think I will cook the mushrooms separately in butter before I put them in the oven.  I haven't tried it yet but I hope it will help and add a little more flavor to the mushroom.

2013.04.01  - These were delicious and made a very filling supper!
Mods:
8 mushrooms (5 for him, 3 for me)
No beef (replaced with mushroom stems)
Dried parsley (don't have fresh)
Cooking onion (no green on hand)
Pizza sauce instead of pasta sauce

Broil only 4 minutes!

2016.01.29 - I have been making these for years now with the same mods (DBF is vegetarian), but I do switch it up between pizza sauce and pasta sauce.  Also, I have started adding a little garlic sometimes.  I like this recipe because it uses up the end of a carton of cottage cheese after I've made vegetarian meatloaf.

I made these as hors d'oeuvres for a wine night with friends. They were a huge hit. I cooked the mushrooms in olive oil on the stove for a couple minutes because they were somewhat large. The only other change I made to the recipe was using ricotta instead of cottage cheese and adding italian seasoning. I will definitely make these again, but I will change the seasoning of the cheese mixture and will add parmesan to the mix. As is, it is a little bland.

Awesome recipe! Baked mushrooms for about 10 minutes before filling them and added a little garlic powder. Big hit!

One of our faves!  We use the large portabella mushrooms and then we can sometimes add some extra veggies.

One thing I would have done before the first round of baking would to sprinkle some salt on the mushrooms before filling them.  The mushrooms themselves seemed like they needed something.

These were really good. I precooked empty mushrooms at 350 for 10 minutes. I substituted beef flavored tvp crumbles for the burger and added garlic and Italian seasoning.  The filling made enough for 20 larger button mushrooms, which I used. These were quick and easy and I'll definitely make again.

I'm docking one star because as written, this would have yielded a pan full of water. But if you follow another reviewer's tip, and bake your mushrooms alone for 5-10 minutes first, and then drain the water out of the pan, and then stuff them, you're golden! Also, this is a must if you're using larger mushrooms, just to make sure they cook all the way through. We devoured these and my husband declared them "AWESOME".

I thought these were really good.  Husband and son just thought they were OK.  Mushrooms needed to be cooked longer.  I did bake them on a wire rack so they would sweat.  If I make again, I will cook the mushroom caps by themselves until they are cooked through and then will stuff with filling

Delicious!  I made two versions, one larger size with portobellos for dinner and the rest with button mushrooms, both were great.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  A definite keeper with changes!

Very good recipe. Family who don't normally eat mushrooms, gave it a thumbs up and had seconds. I added extra seasoning to my taste and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, but next time will try the cottage cheese.

The recipe does not address the problem with excess liquid.  It turned into a soupy mess.  I started over and strained the excess fluid from the meat and cheese mixture, cooked the mushrooms in the oven, alone, for 10 minutes, stuffed them and cooked until heated through.  Too much trouble.

We really loved the taste of these.  I scaled the recipe to 8 servings and used 6 large portabella mushroom caps.  I pierced two cuts on the caps and baked them (15 minutes at 350 degrees) on a baking sheet lined with a rack to let the caps drain. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and only 1 egg and placed this mixture on the caps, added sauce on top and finished with mozzarella cheese.  Then I baked them for an additional 15 minutes until filling was hot.  We will definitely be making these again!

Left out the beef and added spinach.  I also used tomato paste instead of the pasta sauce.  They were great

We liked this. Instead of spreading the pasta sauce on the mushrooms I mixed it into the stuffing. I cooked it longer than the recipe said too and the stuffing was done, but the mushrooms seamed undercooked. I might try to grill them next time.

Love, love, love this recipe. I take it to dinner parties and my family requests it regularly. I have used portabella for main dished and regular brown mushrooms for appetizers. I read all the reviews and spray the outside with olive oil a few times before cooking to keep from drying out. If you have someone who doesn't like mushrooms, simply take the extra (there will be plenty) and put it in an oven safe pirex and cook with others. It's great that way too! Sometimes the mushrooms are still raw in the middle depending on how thick they are but that doesn't bother me. Enjoy!
