The origional pasta puttanesca is supposed to be spicy. Use extra virgin olive oil, use REAL anchovies,and crushed red pepper. No flour. No cheese. It is meant to be a more liquidy dish to be mopped up with fresh crusty bread.Also, there should not be any chicken in this dish, and less capers and olives. And canned tomatoes are definitely the way to go to get the right consistency.Thanks anyways though.

This dish was good, although it cooked fast and I had to add quite a bit more oil since everything wanted to stick to the pan.  I skipped the anchovy paste and this might just have been what was missing.

This tastes like a dish from my favorite Mediterranean restaurant!  The only change I made was replacing fresh tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes.  My husband said,"You can make this again!"

IF you enjoy lemon and tartness go for it, I loves olives and capers and other such ingredients, but could not handle this. I really thought it would be better than it turned out. Sorry, but will not make this again.

Very easy to prepare.  Served to the grandchildren (7-13) and they loved it.  Please use the anchovy paste.  If you can't find paste, just make your own by mashing up a coupe of anchovy's, it makes the dish.

My family thought the recipe was too dry.  Flavor was good.

I was hesitant at first - but this worked out really well - the only thing I would do differently would be to check for good olives no pits, check your pasta and chicken quantities more accurately and make sure you do all of the tomatoes - but otherwise excellent - will do again.

This was a new experience for my "meat and Potato" husband.  He really liked it and even had a second helping.  I have fixed it without the anchovy paste but, I would highly recommend USING it because it seems to completes the dish. I have used a can of diced tomatoes in this recipe and it adds some moisture if you like it less dry.

My husband and I love this!  As everyone does, I alter the recipe a bit; no hot spices, extra capers and olives.  This doesn't feed 4... it feeds 40!!

It's not Puttanesca without garlic and red pepper flakes. I added both. I made this recipe according to taste. Sauteed the chopped garlic first in olive oil, then added the olives and capers, then used a couple cups of Trader Joes Rustica sauce. I cooked two large chicken breasts (without flour) in a grill pan and chopped that up and added it to the sauce and added about 3/4 cup water reserved from cooking the pasta, plus added a generous amount of red pepper flakes. Cooked on the stovetop about 10 more minutes and then added a half package of the cooked pasta. Sprinkled with Romano cheese. It's quite good

I replaced the chicken with mushrooms, anchovies, diced tomatoes, red pepper flakes as well as with some jalapeños, and red wine(Cabernet Sauvignon ) it was amazing I sautéed the mushrooms till they caramelized with the onions and garlic. It was so delicious

I made this a couple days ago and my family loved it, though I personally thought the pasta was very plain and added balsamic vinegar which improved it. I would make it again but, with a few changes.
