Delicious! I like adding lemon juice to cut the bitterness of my fresh basil. I did add extra olive oil on top to get it to the  right consistency because as is it was too dry. But that is my preference. Super easy. My daughter helped make this

I thought my attempt was too salty.  Less cheese next time.

Delicious for my first pesto attempt.   I roasted the garlic and pine nuts before adding.   Yum!

Very tasty!paired this with zebra farfalle and it was gorgeous. Sort of looked like a WICKED themed dish.
