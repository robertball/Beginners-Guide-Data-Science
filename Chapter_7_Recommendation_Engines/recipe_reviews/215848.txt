This recipe was delicious! I did change it a little...I just layed foil on the BBQ and cooked the eggplant that way instead of frying it. I used panko (seasoned with garlic powder, italian seasoning and s&p) instead of bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand. (might try bread crumbs next time to see which is actually better) I used sauce made from my garden tomatoes (eggplant also was from the garden) and instead of angel hair pasta I used a small ziti cause I hate going to the grocery store when I have similar items in the house. The flavors were very complemetary, very good recipe.

flavors were very good though I did not get mine to "roll". Maybe my eggplant was too small. I ended up just making this into a casserole: I put a ricotta layer between 2 eggplant slices since I could not get them to roll and just put them in a layer in the pan. It took 2, not 1, eggs to coat all my eggplant slices and I needed 2 tb per batch, not a total of 2 tb of olive oil to fry em up....so the proportions were off for me but easily fixable. Since I did a casserole and not rollps the strips of prosciutto didn't work well (too hard to cut being a dry meat) so I diced it up and sprinkled it over the top. Overall in the end I used the same ingredients so got the same flavor....just in a not rolled up version.  My husband who does NOT like eggplant deemed it "pretty good".
