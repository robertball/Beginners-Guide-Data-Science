I made these for our open house. I used green olives instead of black and skipped the salt. Thank you for a terrific recipe!

Update: I made these a second time. I used the green olives as I had before, skipped the salt again and tried it with cream cheese because I was out of mayo. Served it on marble rye bread. They were even better!

This is pretty much the  same recipe that my mom used to make, except that she did not add salt or curry, and she used cocktail rye, which makes very nice hors d'oeuvres.  You can actually spread this olive cheese spread on the bread or muffins, and then freeze on a cookie sheet.  Once frozen, store in foil and a Ziploc freezer bag.  All you have to do when company comes is pop them in the oven, and voila!  Instant appetizers!

Fantastic!  So easy to make yet so tasty.  We ate it topped with fresh tomato slices for breakfast on a rainy Sunday.  It was perfect

So glad I found this recipe! My grandma used to make this often!  I omitted the salt and found that the amount of curry powder was right on for my husband and I. I used red onions with good results. Thanks for such a yummy and easy recipe!

Very good.  I had not used curry powder before, so the taste was a little
different from anything I have ever made.  I will make them again sometime
for an appetizer, but I might use less curry powder.

These were VERY well received. I doubled the recipe. It calls for a little more salt than I like, though.

Great taste, interesting mix of flavors. I used a dense multi-grain toast in place of the English muffins. I also added sliced pimento-stuffed green olives, and omitted the salt, as others had suggested (you will not miss it!). I used a low-fat mayo and found the taste to be a bit too sweet and overpowering - I'll use less mayo next time. I was afraid to put too much curry powder, so I only used a tiny pinch, but it can definitely handle more. I'd make these again, but I'll keep tinkering with the ingredients!

Very good.  A little salty...I will leave the extra salt out next time.  I served on 1/2 English muffin with a slice of fresh tomato on the bottom.  I also froze the left over mixture.  I did fine in the freezer.  Next time I will freeze it in ice cube trays so I can thaw just what I need.

This was a fun little recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and used whole grain English muffins, light mayo, and extra sharp Tillamook cheddar.  We had these for dinner with fresh tomato slices and rootbeer floats.

These were just odd tasting to me.  They were best with the cheese quite crispy.  I was basically the only one in the family who ate more then one.

I do this on cocktail rye bread and everyone loves it.  I put the bread on a cookie sheet and lightly toast one side, turn it over, top it, and then bake until melty and brown.  I use chopped olives out of the can, which works just fine.  Takes 2 cans for a recipe!  Extra sharp cheddar is best!  Lots more curry powder and green onion makes it even tastier!

These are fabulous and we could not get enough of them!  I used 6 whole English muffins, so I had 12 halves and had exactly enough topping for each one.  10 minute was the exact time to bake them.  They were nice and warm, the cheese was perfectly melted and the taste was excellent!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe.  I have an old one using store bought tapenade,  ( a mixture of black olives, capers, olive oil, etc) grated swiss cheese and dijon mustard, no salt.   I serve on toasted slices of french baguette topped with fresh diced onion with a squeeze of lemon juice.    Yummy..

This is an awasome idea. I changed a few things, first I used mini bagels and cut out the salt and curry, I used cream cheese instead of mayo and added jalepenos.  Delicious!!

I substituted cream cheese for the mayonnaise and also omitted the salt.  I then spread the cheese on mini rye bread slices and pumpernickel slices.

All the reviews made me think this would be great. I made the recipe to the T and it was not appetizing. The mayo was a lot. I couldn't really taste the curry though. Won't be making again.

I've been making these for over forty years.  They are so great and can be customized in so many ways with cheese, olive and bread varieties, onions, bacon, avacado, tomato, chives, and, of course, in Texas jalapino and/or salsa!  I use a 2C package of shredded cheese and only 1/4 c of Hellman's mayo.  It seems I always have a container of the mixture on hand or in the freezer so we can pop one in the toaster oven at will.  For years it was requested by my staff for every breakfast/brunch function and, even though retired now, they still ask me to join them . . . if I bring the muffins.

Oh, yeah... I love olives, I love sharp Cheddar, I love green onions and I love these. I also live part time in Santa Barbara, where the streets are paved in avocados, so those are a great touch, too. I added a whole, medium, fairly ripe one and it mixed in beautifully. And ridiculously easy doesn't hurt. What a treat!!

I liked the basic idea but it didn't work out all that well. I didn't like the curry flavor with the olives and there was too much mayo. I probably will try it again....with half the mayo and no curry.

I would give this one star, but my family liked it a little better than I did, so I'll bump it up to two.  The odd combination of all the ingredients just didn't work for me.  I won't make it again.  The curry worked against the olives for an odd flavor.

I love olives so this was a no-brainer for me. I ate this both hot and cold and prefer it cold on a toasted muffin. I think a very small amount of fine chopped walnut would be good too.

Good!  Will try a little less mayo next time we make it.  I thought that taste was too strong.

Sensational!  I actually was going to make this the other day, and misplaced the recipe...then forgot what it was called, so I couldn't look it up.  I panicked for a while, and was on a mission to find it; then it showed up!  Like some other folks, I used green olives istead of black.  I think I would leave the salt out completely when using green olives.  This was delish!

I followed this recipe exactly and it just wasn't good to me, if anyone has any suggestions to switch up the recipe a bit and make it better let me know, it seems like a good idea.

Our family has been making these for years, only a simpler version.  no olives, just a bunch of scallions chopped(green and white parts ), mayonaise and shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese.  My son calls them Killer Muffins. It's our favorite appetizer.

Mmm, very tasty! So many ways to change it to personal preference. I used green olives and red onions. I could not taste the curry powder but I could sure smell it. May leave that out next time.

Really tasty. I scaled the recipe all the way back to 2 servings, omitted the green onions, and skipped adding the salt to the mixture. Instead I just sprinkled a little salt and pepper on the tops when they came out of the oven. Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed it :)

Very good. Better with a stronger bread like rye versus sourdough. I tried it with both and disliked the sourdough bread taste although it's my favorite and the rye was better. I won't make this again...sorry.

Oh my, these flavors did not work for me at all. The green onions seemed undercooked in the mixture. There was too many black olives and the mayonnaise curry flavor was just way too strong. I made 1/4 of a recipe to try it for lunch. I tried a curry chicken salad and did not care for it either, so this combination may just really not work for me.

These were good. I didn't use the curry powder and I didn't have green onions. Instead I used diced white onion, added jalapenos, and omitted the salt.

i wasnt overly impressed. Maybe a different kind of cheese, a little less olives and maybe some kind of meat would make these better.

Great appetizer!!  I eliminated the salt and used Colby/Jack cheese instead of Cheddar.  Since I don't usually have mayonnaise on hand, I used Light Miracle Whip instead, it just seem to give them more flavor than the mayo, which I had tried before.

I have been making these for years....without the curry powder. And instead of english muffins, I spread and bake on slices of a french baguette. This is my go-to app that people request that I bring EVERYWHERE!!

I have been making these for years. Important to chop olives by hand.  A friend processed them and this totally changed the end result.  To reviewer who found them difficult to cut - they should be cut before baking.  These are always well received.

I made these, but I used Thomas' reduced fat-high fiber English muffins (not trying to plug a product-I think, reduced fat for me and adding fiber to our diets is critical).  My son doesn't like scallions (green onions), but will eat chives (go figure), so I substituted that as well.  He loved these.  Better than mini pizzas.  I don't fight him if he'll eat it with no problem.  Somehow, I'm going to sneak a vegetable into this somewhere, I'm not sure where or what, but I will.  I must have eaten too many while pregnant.  And if it is green, yellow or red he has an aversion to it.  Meanwhile, we eat all colors of the rainbow.

Made these for Christmas Eve, as written except that I used some mayo and some cream cheese, used green olives instead of black, and did not add the salt.  I also used wheat English muffins.  Pretty good overall; it may have been the taste of the green olives I used, but many said they tasted a bit like McDonald's cheeseburgers...strange, I know.  Next time I will probably only use the cream cheese and skip the mayo, which made them kind of difficult to cut cleanly once out of the oven.

for a beginning cook, very easy and VERY delicious!!! i used half the salt, and substituted things like miracle whip for mayo and italian cheese instead of cheddar, and completely left out the curry powder. I also used one of the suggestions below of adding a slice of tomato before baking it. Turned out AMAZING!!!! Excellent touch.   *if you don't have english muffins, begals also taste great and add more of a "pizza" texture

I  made this for my boyfriend because I am not a fan of olives, but was surprised!  The ingredients really masked the olive taste and they were great quick, light breakfast.  I used whole wheat english muffins and did not have curry powder on hand so I substituted a little paprika and chili powder instead.

You gotta love curry! When I was little my mom cut this recipe out of the food section of our local newspaper and decided to give it a try. Yummy! Now I get to make it for my kids. I leave out the salt though. What a great snack!

Loved 'em!   This is my favorite appetizer.  Quick & easy to make & people always rave.  I make the spread a day in advance and let it sit in the refrigerator over night.  I think the favors melt together and the taste is even better.

We have been making these for 40 years in our family. You really need to toast the muffins before you put the spread on them. They will be mushy otherwise.

I made these for a Happy Hour in my community. They were devoured, while other things remained. What I would change:use 7 English muffins instead of 8 because I didn't have enough to cover all 8, I used granulated garlic salt and omitted regular salt (as per other comments)and  curry powder (because I don't like it and didn't think it really went with the other ingredients). I will probably cut these in half instead of quarters. Will definitely make again!

This was a big hit with the family. The first time I made exactly as the recipe, and though everyone loved it, my husband felt like there was something missing. Next time, I added a little bit of chili powder and used mexican cheese blend instead of plain cheddar cheese. The results were outstanding, though it could be just a family preference. I see serving this on many other types of breads, I will try that out and write a review. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this last night for casual company.  There were 4 of us and everyone liked it.  I only had 3 English muffins left from a package but when split, it gave 6 muffin halves to work with and that was plenty for the 4 of us.  
For extra crispy muffin bottoms (which I feel adds needed texture), first toast them in the toaster before spreading the cheese mixture on top and baking.  Otherwise there's too much mush or softness.  I also added a few strips of bacon, cooked and crumbled to the cheese mixture. I personally never care for curry powder so I omitted it.  These changes made them an enjoyable item to serve along with wine, nuts, and shrimp as appetizers.
I found that a pizza wheel was helpful in cutting them.  I cut them in half, not fourths, as I felt they were a decent size for handling--and the 2 men did not think they were eating "dainty" food-  LOL!

This was delicious.  I used Kalamata olives (my favorite) and used half the mayo and substituted cream cheese.  Also threw in half an avocado and that made it extra rich.  Great recipe!

These were pretty good, but I was not overly impressed.  I will make them again, but do not plan on making them for any parties or events.

Fantastic recipe! It was a nice change. I didn't have black olives, so I tried it with green olives and it came out great :-)

My mother called these "poo poos" and they were a family favorite since the 60's.  My adult kids still beg for them and I can't make them fast enough.  Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser.  Can you put in too much curry?  I never have....yummy.  I'm going to make some right now!

We've got more than our usual supply of olives in the house, so this was the perfect excuse to make this appy for my olive freak hubby. He loved them! I wouldn't suggest adding any salt tho; olives in general have more than their share. Didnt' have any muffins, so I used plain old saltines instead. Yes "ffw", I have to very much agree with you regarding the comment. Thanks so much Kim; good stuff!

I've made these twice and left out the salt the second time around.  They're really great!  I'm confused by the review that was based off the reviewers math skills.  Seems silly to waste time counting numbers on your fingers and toes when you could just be enjoying a great recipe.

Way too much curry - it was overpowering! I used green olives instead of black and omitted the green onions. It was good other than the curry - I'd cut it in half.

Tasty but a bit salty. I thnk there is plenty of sodium in the cheese and olives so next time I will omit the added salt. Made these as an accompaniment to green salad for a litght meal and it was a nice change of pace.

I love these! I had been given the recipe years ago by a colleague but have lost it since.  I decided to punch in the ingredients I remembered & was so, so  excited to find this!! I'm about to make them right now- no joke. Thank you for sharing, Kim!

So easy and delish! I cannot describe how great these are. I remember being a kid and my mom making them. Then I made them as an adult. We've been making these for about 20 years and it's always a hit. Yummy!

I think these would be GREAT, but how did we get a serving sized of 30 from 8 muffins split in half and then split into 1/4.  Is this new math?
