1-13-2017 Certainly easy and inexpensive for gifting, using ingredients I always have in my kitchen. They seemed oily to me, so I think I would prefer to use 1/2 cup butter instead (which would be the recipe for Best Brownies minus the frosting).

I've never had homemade brownies before I tried this recipe. This was last minute as I was making this for my fiance..very easy, SUPER delicious! I did substitute the vegetable oil for applesauce and took them out of the oven a little early because we like them a little gooey. Thank you for the recipe!
