I made this for my 15 year old Smoothie King. He didn't care for it but I thought that it was pretty darn good. I only put one spoonful of sugar in. I think that this could be eliminated altogether. Since our pineapple was in its' own juice and not in syrup I went ahead and threw a bit in. Thanks much for the post!!

I doubled this recipe, added a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract and instead of cubes ice, I used chunked frozen bananas. We loved it, though it was a little sweet. Next time, I'll omit the extra sugar.

I had leftover crushed pineapple and found this recipe (thankfully).  My kids LOVED it.  They love slushies and smoothies so I asked them what they thought of it - 4 stars.  They said it is sweet enough and very delicious.

This is a pretty tasty smoothie, reason for the 4 stars,   if you eliminate the sugar and use OJ with reduced sugar, it will fall a bit more into the healthy category.
