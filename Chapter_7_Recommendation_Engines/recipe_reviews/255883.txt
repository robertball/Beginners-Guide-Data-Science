My first time trying a "refrigerate overnight" oatmeal recipe. Prepared recipe as directed. Recipe is awesome, but I found out rather quickly that I am not a cold uncooked oatmeal fan. Second time: Prepared again with old fashioned (not quick) oatmeal (same as before) and the changes I made were to use a brown sugar blend and unsweetened almond milk. The next morning, I poured this into a microwavable bowl, stirred in an additional  1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk and cook for 3-4 minutes, removed and topped with another 1/4 unsweetened almond milk and added Stevia, to taste. NOW we are in business!!! I definitely will make this again and again, but not as a grab and go breakfast.

I followed the recipe exactly (used quick oats).  I didn't care for the underlying oat flour-y texture/taste.  As with the previous reviewer, I know now I am not a fan of uncooked oatmeal.  I heated it up in the  microwave and it was marginally better after adding more milk and some extra sugar. I  thought the amount of spices was a bit over- powering, in particular the ginger.   FYI, rather than make up all that spice mix and potentially have it sit around for who knows how long, here are the ingredients for one serving: 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon, ginger and allspice, and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and cloves.  Personally I would cut the ginger to 1/8tsp also if I was to make this again.

I am rating this 5 stars for the simplicity of the idea and recipe. I cannot wait to try it in the morning. When I have decided on how the ORIGINAL recipe suits me, I will update my review. Until then, thank you for sharing this!
UPDATE: This was delicious! Not too sweet and just the right amount of seasoning. I did add 2 tsp slivered almonds to it also and the extra crunch was worth it. This was actually about 2 servings too, I couldn't eat it all in one sitting. Very good and worth making!

I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the spice blend in the recipe and it was much more simple. It still turned out amazing and I was so pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of it and the quick prep time. A great option for breakfast on the go! Great option for a low waste and delicious quick breakfast.

I used almonds instead of pecans and added the raisins in the morning (otherwise, it can be too sweet)!

It really tastes like gingerbread!! I added vanilla yogurt to it and it was really good. Next time Iâ€™m gonna cut the gingerbread seasoning by half, a little much for me, but it was still really good!

This is pretty darn good. I love overnight oats and have them every morning, but I wanted a change from my usual recipe. This one is good hot or cold. The spice blend is yummy. The level of sweetness is just right for me, and I love the pecans. My mother in law hates nutmeg but she came into the kitchen asking what smelled so good. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I will make this again but I made changes. I used 1/3 cup steel cut oats instead of rolled oats. I used Almond milk. I added 1/3 cup of Greek yogurt and 1/2 tablespoon flaxseed meal. Your Gingerbread Spice recipe made it mouth watering.
