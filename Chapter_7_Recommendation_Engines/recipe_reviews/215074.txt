This will work well in a slow cooker also. Just wait till the last 45 minutes and add cream and set cooker on high. I like the slow cooker in the hotest summer months. We live in NV where the mid day can be clost to 115 or 120. Have to keep the kitchen COOL.

What a great way to use up that ham bone taking up freezer space!  I didn't have any cream so I used skim milk powder instead.  I don't think anyone noticed the difference because my kids and husband loved it.

I loved this recipe.......I just "tweaked" it a bit to make it my own. I added Chicken boullion,  I used the pre-packaged (8 oz.) chopped ham bits (usually used in omlets) that you find in the dairy section with the cold cuts. I also added a few teaspoons of Oscar Meyer bacon bits. Instead of fresh onions I used seasoned onion flakes from my spice rack.  The broth is thin but oh so good!

This is simply delicious! I made a few changes though. I used ham boullion in the water and used about twice the amount of beans. Also I didn't have enough ham on hand so I threw in some leftover bacon i had in the freezer. At first I thought it was a bit bland, but after sitting for an hour after cooking, the flavors came through a lot more. The broth is really thin so if you like a thicker soup, add more veggies. I will certainly make this again!!!!! You won't be disappointed!

Absolutely loved it.  Read some of the other reviews.  Used 7 cups chicken broth rather than 8 cups water.  I threw in fresh mushrooms.  Used white pepper......it was delicious!!!  Hubby said to make sure this was a "keeper."

Will not make again. Not much taste. Even tried to spice it up after I was done with this, but no use. Just blah. :-(

I love the creamy spin on an old favorite.  I made it with all the veggies from my garden and it was wonderful.
