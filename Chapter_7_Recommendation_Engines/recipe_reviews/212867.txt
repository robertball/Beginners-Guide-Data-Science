This dough can be a bit crumbly, but the cookies are amazing! Well worth the mess. :)

I am the original poster of this recipe. The crumbliness of the dough is what makes the crisp texture of the cookie when it is baked. If you mix the dough when the kitchen is hot,the dough is less crumbly and easier to mix. I usually mix it after I've spent the first part of the day baking other cookies. Then, when baking the butter cookie, I always do it first in the morning, when the kitchen is cold. Hope this helps.

Luckily, I read the reviews before trying this recipe for the first time because I too, had to add another egg and a little more vanilla so that the dough would even stick together. After sticking the slices together, I ended up with only 21 cookies. They would have been big cookies, but I was about to serve them at my Danish grandpa's 98th birthday party. So after cutting them in half to double the batch, they still ended up a nice size. After cooling for only a few minutes, they were unexpectedly slightly crunchy. I'm still not sure why you have to make two separate "logs" and then put the slices together. I'm going to experiment with the next batch and see if they taste the same if I just add a third egg and a little more coarse sugar to all of the dough and just place the pecans on top right before baking. It's too bad this recipe is kind of confusing (88 pecans? Where did that number come from?). But I give it five stars because they taste so delicious. They taste like scones, only better. They go great with coffee!! Oh, and my Danish Grandpa and relatives loved them too!!

Just finished making this recipe. I didn't have a problem with mixing the dough it was the baking that wasn't right. Recommend to bake at 350 for 10 mins then turn cookies over and bake 4 more minutes. Cookie was delicious .

After reading reviews used 2eggs and 3tsp vanilla.  Not sure what went wrong?  The butter just melted onto the cookie sheet!  I will try again without changes. Any suggestions?

The dough was impossibly crumbly to even try to form a ball let alone roll it into a log.  I added an egg and another teaspoon of vanilla and then everything was fine and the cookies were very good.
