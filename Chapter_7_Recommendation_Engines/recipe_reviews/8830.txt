Made a few changes with this recipe.  I used half and half istead of heavy whipping cream.  I also seasoned the flour with Lawrys seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper.  Seasoned the butter too with garlic salt and pepper.  I added the half and half the last 20 minutes of cooking so it would not currdle as it had with another review.  I also sauted the mushrooms along with a yellow onion and a green bell pepper in butter then added them the last 15 minutes.  This is a great recipe.  I will be making again and again!!  Thanks for sharing:)

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I took the advice of others.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and herbs de provence to the flour.  I sauteed the mushrooms with some fresh spinach, fresh garlic, and sherry.  I served over angel hair pasta.  Delicious!

Very easy, simple, but taste is great!
As there is no seasoning on this recipe, I added S&P, garlic powder and onion powder before coating in flour.

Great Recipe! Just my .02, added about 3 cloves of garlic and used Vigo bread crumbs rather than just flour. I would say the garlic is a must though. By far one of the best and easiest dinner I've made from this site.

Great simple recipe! Of course, I wanted a lot more flavor & flaire...I added salt, pepper, garlic powder & herbs du provence in the coating for a little more flavor. I didn't have whole cream on hand, so I replaced it with 1/2 & 1/2. I also sauteed my mushrooms with olive oil, butter & white wine and added it to the oven cooked chicken. Shredded swiss cheese was added at the end and broiled until light brown. Yummy!

Very good, very rich recipe.  My wife made it for me in a larger dish than the recipie calls for.  Perhaps Sam's Club chicken breasts are larger than most.  My wife served it over linguine and I loved it.  She said it was a little bland and added pepper and garlic powder.  We agreed that some milk to thin the cream or half and half instead of cream might make this less fattening.

Here's a little hint.  Marinate your chicken in Zesty Italian dressing for a few hours or overnight.  YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!!  Try it.

Tasty and easy. I used fat-free half and half it was plenty thick and my picky hubby couldn't tell the difference. I also used canned mushrooms, as I forgot to buy fresh - they were fine as well.  I tried to spice it up, but didn't use enough garlic powder and such. I should warn you that this is a truly WHITE dinner. I served it with steamed veggies and put it over rice. It would be good with noodles as well.

Although very good, this needed a bit of spicing up.  I mixed the flour with Italian-style bread crumbs and double-coated the chicken.  I also sprinkled Italian seasoning in the last step for a little extra flavor.  Turned out great!

mmm this turned out perfect. ofcourse i seasoned the flour with garlic and onion powder, italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. after i had the breasts ready to go in the oven in the pan i also sprinkled some more italian seasoning on them. at about the last 5 minutes in the oven i added a small can of sweet pees over them. i don't think they could have come out better!

I don;t usually make recipes unless they have at least a 4.5 star rating, but I made an exception on this one. Wrong. It was bland, boring, and had zero presentation quality. It might be okay with a whole lot of modifications, but as written it falls flat on all counts. The only reason for the two stars instead of one is that the chicken was moist and tender (although flavor-less) from the dredging in butter. If considering this one, move on -- there are too many other wonderful recipes out there to waste your time.

Not one person made this recipe as is...all made very good changes...why would you give it 4 stars?  In my opinion it is bland & boring....the changes are what made it successful.

Although I only thought this recipe deserves a 3-star rating, my family REALLY enjoyed this (except my daughter who picked out the mushrooms) = thus, 4 stars. I too added some onion/garlic powders to the flour for some more spice.  However, I only baked this for 30 min (which was all it needed) but it looked greasy and as it sat, it started to look chunky and curdled...it was NOT creamy as I would have hoped.  Taste wasn't bad but despite my family's approval, I wouldn't make it again.

I was looking for something a bit different and this seemed like a great twist on a favorite.  It came out absolutely amazing!  I used the sauce to top macaroni as a side - it was mouth watering! I posted my pic of this dish as well.  Next time, however, I will just use an egg wash and cut the cream out, need to take the fat n calories down.

I made this for me and my hubby last night and it turned out great! I agree with seasoning the flour. I also used 1/2 and 1/2. I baked the chicken for twenty min before adding the 1/2 and 1/2. As it was baking I sliced some portobello mushroom and sauteed them in a little bit of butter, wine and purple onions. After 30 min I added the mushrooms and the sauce to the chicken and sprinkled mozzarella on top of it all and put it back  in the oven for 8 min. I think next time I will add some artichokes, but otherwise we really like this recipe.

Very good recipe! Like other reviewers, I added S&P, garlic and onion powders, and Italian seasoning.  Sautee'd my fresh mushrooms in cooking wine and olive oil. Added the cream about 20 minutes in, followed 5 minutes later by the mushrooms. Topped it with the grated parmesan when the timer went off, turned off the heat and let it sit a couple minutes before removing from the oven. Served it on a bed of buttered linguini. Next time I'll use a smidge more cream so we'll have more sauce for the noodles.  My family loved it! Will definitely add this to my dinner menu.

The first time I made this, I realized the mushrooms I'd bought had gone bad (procrastinator here LOL).  I actually thinly sliced sweet onions and layered on top of the chicken and it was decent enough.  I made it the next time with mushrooms and it was stupendous!!! I did put garlic powder and basil on the chicken before pouring the cream on it.  This has great flavor and consistency.  I have made it several times and just eat the chicken with veggies of some kind.  No rice or noodles and it's good, although that way would be good, too.  I may try both mushrooms and onions and see how that does.

This was really good! I followed the advice of other readers and added onion powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning to the flour! Also I did not have chicken breast available so I used 8 chicken tenders and it came out so good! My mom said it was the best tasting chicken she had ever tasted. Oh and I also sauteed the mushrooms with some garlic and they came out very flavorful! Also to cut down on some calories I only used 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of olive oil! Thanks for sharing! :)

I made this recipe as is. The flavors from the mushrooms, butter and cream blended so well into the chicken.  The parmesan cheese was the iceing on the cake. I only cooked 3 chicken breast halves, and used everything else as is. This is a keeper for me!    Thanks for sharing a great and quick dish.

Really enjoyed this. But next time I think I will make Lemon Garlic Butter and dredge it in that instead of plain butter. Maybe add some capers too. My husband says it is great the second day as all the flavors blend very well.

I gave this recipe 4 stars only due to the lack of seasonings. Otherwise, it was excellent; a nice pace of pace .I lightly dusted the meat in whole wheat flour and browned it. While camping, I used 1/2" thick turkey cutlets. I sauteed a small onion in some olive oil, then added fresh, sliced baby portobellas seasoned with dried thyme. After removing them from the pan, I browned the cutlets. Next I added a couple splashes of 2% milk and a couple splashes of chicken broth along with the mushrooms. I covered  the pan and let it lightly simmer for about 10 minutes until the cutlets were tender. I added grated Parmesan cheese on top and covered until it melted. This was equally as good.  Be sure to add salt, pepper and garlic powder to the cutlets as well as the flour (or whatever you like) before browning. This recipe was definitely a keeper!  Thanks for a really good, easy and adaptable recipe.

Really easy-- I made it twice now, which is a big deal when my fiance asks for me to make a certain dish again.  I mixed and matched some of the reviewer's ideas.  Since it's the two of us, I only used 4 chicken breasts.  I seasoned each side with black pepper, sea salt, & garlic powder.  I dredged them in melted butter, then Italian breadcrumbs.  Then I browned them in a pan with olive oil on the stovetop.  I put the browned chicken (doesn't have to be completely cooked through, just browned on both sides for 2-3 minutes) into a glass, rectangular baking dish.  Instead of heavy cream or half and half, I used 3 regular sized cans (10 oz?) of cream of mushroom soup to layer on top of the chicken (the third can is for the extra sauce to go on the pasta..).  Then I topped the dish with mushrooms (can or fresh, depending on what we have), grated parmesan cheese, & extra Italian breadcrumbs.  The dish went into the oven for 35 minutes (not too long since it was already browned).  The chicken came out cooked thoroughly and very tender (can even cut with a fork!).  They were served over wide eggless noodles (with extra parmesan cheese sprinkled on top of your plate if desired) and a bowl of salad.  Very yummy, especially if you love mushrooms like we do!  My fiance said there was something still missing.  I think I'll follow that one review and add onions and peppers next time to give it an extra kick.

I made this for the family and husband to take to work.  I found out at the last minute that my husband had finished the mushrooms so I had to chop spinish and add on the top as I read on other reviews. Great flavors and easy to make only probably as husband says that this dish is to eat right there and then not cold and having to heat it up.  I also used ranch style bread crumbs and put in extra seasoning of garlic powder, parmesan cheese and chopped garlic to add those extra flavors. To the butter just added a bit of garlic salt and pepper.

Effortless and Quick.  I'm a single guy (chemist) with no interest in eating like one.  While usually I break out the chemistry skills into a culinary research project, when I'm having a rough week this recipe is one of my go-to solutions.  Quick, effortless and delicious.  I usually use more cream and cheese so I have something to douse my egg noodles in.

delicious and very easy.  Used Half & Half - next time will add late in cooking cycle to prevent curdling.

Thought this dish was wonderful. Like others, I added salt and pepper and even garlic powder. Instead of pasta with it, I did a bed of rice under it. I mixed half of the flour and half bread crumbs for the coating as well. Delicious!

If you make this exactly as written (as I did), you will come out with a very bland dish that needs a lot of tweaking to make it edible.  The butter/flour coating mixed with the heavy whipping cream comes out of the oven with a glue/paste type texture.  It has very little flavor and is unappetizing.  Should you try this recipe, you should brown the chicken first in a skillet and saute the mushrooms before adding them into the baking dish.  I'd also use more Parmesan cheese, too.  Anything else you can think of to add tot he recipe certainly would add to this dish since there's lots of room for improvement.

I took the suggestions from below and used half and half as well as added pepper, salt, garlic powder, and herbs du provence to the flour, but it still seemed fairly basic and not exactly bursting with flavor.  It's fine for your average meal I guess, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I live a high protein life style so I used pork rinds instead of the flour.  That was the only change and the chicken is moist and delicious! This is a very quick recipe and extremely easy to make. Try it! I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.

This was a bust for me. After the butter and flour, without sauteeing it, the flour just stayed on the chicken. Did I do something wrong.

Excellent recipe - like all the other reviews I added my own seasoning to the flour and used an Indian style marinade for the chicken.  Also used half grated parmesan and half grated chedder

I really enjoyed this one. I did make some changes. I left out the whipping cream and all purpose flour and I sauteed the mushrooms and added a little bit of brandy to them. I also added some sharp cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper to the meat along with the parmesan. My husband is picky, but he loved this.

So good. Didn't use cream at all, instead used some chicken stock to cook the mushroom, and then add some full milk. Very yummy and the whole family, including my fussy 3 year old and husband, love it!

By far the best dinner I have ever made. We ate until we were stuffed. My husband loved it too. Followed everything exactly, except used pepper and sprinkled frest basil leaves at the end (while it was on the plate) to give it some color. I also will use peas and maybe a bit of bacon in the future. I will make this again and again, thank you for sharing.

Delish! I too added s&p, garlic powder, a little paprika and parsley to the flour. I used the heavy cream, because it was what I had. Turned out super yummy.

I followed other reviewers and added Lawry's, garlic and pepper to the flour. I also added some breadcrumbs with added parsely to the flour.  I couldn't imagine not adding any flavor! I also sauteed mushrooms with pepper and onion and put in at last 10 minutes. Used 1/2 and 1/2 and added at last 20 minutes. Turned out perfectly, would definitely make again with these changes

Made this with 1/2 & 1/2, seasoned the flour, used less butter added garlic as suggested.  It was good but I'd add even more garlic next time.  The sauce did curdle as it sat, next time I think I'll make a light cream sauce instead just pouring on the 1/2 & 1/2. Good mushroom flavor and very easy.

I took the advice of many others and seasoned the flour (S&P, garlic & onion powder) as well as the chicken (seasoning recipe from this site) which I chose to use skinless/boneless thighs.  One word: superb!

Mmmm, mmm.  I made this and it was so easy.  I deeply browned boneless, skinless chicken thighs first for that extra richness of flavor and used the same pan to put in the oven.  Also, I didn't have mushrooms (dang) so I used broccoli spears instead.  The broccoli got a little overdone but I like it that way.  Next time with mushrooms I'm sure it will be perfect.   I did salt & pepper the chicken before browning.  Served with chicken & mushroom Rice A Roni, yummy.   This is an indulgence I'll definitely use for my next dinner gathering.

6/28/2010 While cooking this recipe, I chose to add a little Mozzarella Cheese and Slice of Tomato to the top to accompany the Mushrooms.  The toppings used during baking engender a succulent, moist piece of chicken that is sensational.  I am unsure as to the neccessity of the Whipping Cream but used it nevertheless. I regaled several guests with this sumptuous meal and they raved about it. Thanks for the tip.  I would suggest to the author to proffer some additional dishes to round out the meal. For example, I added fettucine alfredo and some sweet green peas as side dishes.  Lastly, I would rate the recipe at a 4.5 to a 4.8 rather than what appears on my review above.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!!!  Roary S. Walsh

Chicken in Alfredo sauce, and so simple too. This was easy and fast to put together. The chicken came out very tender and moist too. I sprinkled the chicken with Season All before I breaded it. This turned out wonderful and I will be making this one again. Yum! Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious!!  I did add season salt, garlic powder and pepper.  I also used fresh grated three cheese blend of parmesan, asiago, and romano.  My husband took one bite and looked at me like he was going to eat the plate!!  I will make this for company - we LOVED it!

This recipe was so easy and the chicken turned out great. I followed everyone else's advice and added some seasoning salt to the flour and to lessen the fat content, I used one can of cream of mushroom soup in place of the heavy cream. Very tasty!

AWESOME !!!!!  I followed other reviewers about adding S&P and garlic powder to the flour........ ( I forgot Parmesan cheese has salt in it ) so I ended up putting to much salt to the flour BY ACCIDENT and it came out to salty. I also added bread crumbs to the top 15 minutes into cooking and it gave the top a CRUNCH which was the icing on the cake !!!!!!!   This dish is AWESOME !!!!!  Thank You SO SO SO MUCH !!!!! Next time I will use less salt ...LOL....

This is a tasty and easy to prepare recipe.  Great dish for company dinners.  I cube the chicken and serve it over rice or noodles.  I've even added a little cream cheese or sour cream for variety and it comes out delious every time.  Its a keeper for sure.

5-stars from all 4 of us!  I added garlic salt to the flour and used 2% milk instead, and it was great.  Easy and yummy--thanks for sharing!

Well, let me see here. After having read the reviews of others I kinda combined them and added a few changes of my own. I had a packet of Shake -n- Bake just laying around about to expire so I said, 'why not' and used that mostly in place of flour. I still added a few tablespoons of flour though. Also added some oregano, italian seasonings, garlic powder, and black pepper to the mix and combined them in a bowl. Since I love my foods rich and creamy I decided this needed a sauce. I grabbed a jar of tomato basil pasta sauce, added a large spoonful or two of sour cream and then mixed in the heavy cream with the sauce. I poured it over the chicken and baked it for 20 minutes.  Took it out and addedthe mushrooms and topped with a parmesan and mozzerella cheese combination and baked another 15 min. Absolutely delish!!

This recipe has some issues. First, the flour needs to be seasoned otherwise the chicken is flavorless. Use caution with the amount of salt used - using a salty cheese on top will increase the saltiness of the dish. Second, Parmesan cheese doesn't accent the mushrooms very well - Swiss may be a better option. Finally, the curdling that some people have complained about isn't curdling. It is the flour and cream mixing to form a lumpy "gravy" if you will. In order to prevent the lumpiness, either breadcrumbs should be used as others mentioned or the chicken should be pan fried before the cream and mushrooms are added. I will not be making again, nor would I recommend it. While the flavor is okay, it will take too much effort to tweak the recipe to make it really good.

I made this with alfredo sauce from this site along with fettuccine.  Together I give it fours stars, but each recipe on their own would probably get two stars from me.  As recommended I put garlic, pepper and onion powder in the flour mix.  I also sauteed the mushrooms a little with butter and fresh garlic.  The chicken itself was bland, I think it needs to be marinated, but I'm not sure in what.

This was great, the chicken was so soft and moist,  The sauce was creamy and wonderful, although I could almost feel my arteries hardening with all the cream and cheese.  It is true that the recipe could be enhanced by the addition of a little spice as mentioned previously.

This was delicious!  I had my doubts because it was so easy.  I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream and it was still great.

Just made this again and realized it was 2011 the first time I made it!  I used the changes from another reviewer then and just a couple nights ago.  My son is dieting right now and this was a nice change for him since he's only been eating baked chicken with butter only seasoning.  This is one of the best recipes I have made and would serve this to company in an instant.  It's very easy to make and does not take long at all.  Thank you Pat for this delicious dish.

As I read in a prior review. I also marinated it in zesty Italian dressing for a few hours. it made it juicy. It is a yummy recipe. My husband even commented how good it was. We will be eating this again in the future. Plus it is so easy to make

If I would have read more of the reviews and made their suggested changes, I might have rated this dish a little higher.  Although it was edible, not my favorite recipe from this site.  I used half & half and it got a little curdled and didn't look very appealing.  It also needed seasoning, so I ended up adding some after I had already bit into it.  My husband seemed to love it more than I did though.  I served it over mashed potatoes alongside green beans.

I made a few changes to the recipe since, as posted, it sounded a little bland. I added some minced garlic and garlic salt to the butter before coating the chicken and added some garlic powder to the flour.  Instead of whipping cream, I used half and half.  After baking for 45 mins the sauce was a little thin so I spooned some out to put over whole wheat spaghetti noodles and added more parmesan cheese to thicken it up.  After my alterations, this recipe was great. It tasted a lot like my chicken alfredo without the hassle of being chained to the stovetop. I will definitely make again with my alterations.

I took other reviewers advice and added some oregano, garlic powder, onion powder to the flour. I also didn't have parmeasan so I used shredded mozzerella. I'm still getting rave reviews the next day and requests for me to make it again and again. The best part was that it was quick and easy to make!

I love this and make it at least once a month, just never got around to rating. I HATE changing the recipes listed and don't believe ones who do so much should even rate others, but I did take advice of others and simply season the chicken with salt and pepper and also added garlic salt to flour mixture. It is sooo good this way, this is really awesome!

This recipe had a good taste but it was extremely mild.I also agree with the comment about it coming out curdled. Next time I will heat the cream and cheese (and add some garlic and seasoning) on the stove first to make an alfredo sauce. Then bake the chicken in the sauce with additional cheese on top.

Excellent recipe.  Very tasty.  Just a few minor changes.
I dipped the chicken in a mixture of 3 Tbsp butter and 1 egg before coating in Vigo Italian Style Bread Crumbs (instead of only using butter and coating in flour).
Also, I added a little garlic, salt and pepper to the cream on top as other reviewers suggested.
In addition, I used shredded provolone & mozzarella cheese since I didn't have parmesan cheese.
I will cook this again and again.  Very quick & easy!

Thank you for your recipe.  I've had it printed since 10-4-2001.  I couldn't review it then because I wasn't a member.  It was very well liked by myself and my family.  Your recipe has a happy face drawn on it, that proves to me that is worth 5 stars.  I know I've made it plenty of times and I'll make it again.

Use half and half instead of heavy whipping cream. Season the flour with Lawrys seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper. Season the butter too with garlic salt and pepper. Add the half and half the last 20 minutes of cooking so it will not currdle. Sauté the mushrooms along with a yellow onion and a green bell pepper in butter then add them the last 15 minutes.

Super easy and looks amazing! This dish could easily be adapted for someone who doesn’t like mushrooms. You could add sundried tomatoes or other veggies to create your own version. Love this recipe!

This recipe needed some major tweeks.. Its a good base.. But I would not suggest what it says.  As I read the reviews the last thing I wanted was bland, and from what the directions tell me, it would have been that.  So the changes were as follows 
1. I added panko, parsley, garlic power, S/P,  and some creole seasoning to the the flour and panko mix. 
2.  EXTRA BUTTER!! with some minced garlic in it.  (1 review said LOTS OF GARLIC!! and they were right!!)
3. I sauted the mushrooms in butter, EVOO, minced garlic, salt, pepper, parsley, and white wine.  It turned in to a sauce.  I then melted down more butter, and mixed in the 1cup of cream, and the 1/2 cup Parm Cheese with the mushrooms.. and may I say OMG this stuff tasted YUMMY!! (eat your heart out Olive Garden your fired!!!) and poured it on top of the chicken the last 20 min. and then topped with some mozzarella cheese.   Basically took the base of this and turned it in to Mushroom Alfredo Chicken Parm.

Few changes... I took some olive oil and fried the chicken until it was crispy (still pink in the middle) (I added Italian bread crumbs garlic powder and other spices) that seemed to give the chicken more flavor... another time I used shake and bake and flavored it with other spices... that works really well too instead of just flour. 
I serve it over liptons mushroom rice and fresh spinach... love it!!

Loved it! Did have slight change in the cut of chicken I used. I only had leg quarters, which I skinned. I also used seasoned flour, onions, and garlic. This was a fantastic combination of flavors. Will definitely be making this again.

Made this last night. I am glad to have followed other advice to sauté mushrooms and add onions and spice. We ate it, but I will not make it again. I have never done chicken this way using flour. The only effect flour made was thicken the sauce. Sorry, but only 1 star form me.

Yummy!  I followed the advice of some previous reviewersby adding a generous amount of seasoning to the flour.  I used Tastefully Simple's DRIED TOMATO & GARLIC PESTO MIX.  I also used chicken strips and fried them in a skillet for about 15 seconds each side before putting in the 9x13 dish.  Served over angel hair pasta and it was delish!  I will definitely make this easy dish again.  My daughters did not like the mushrooms but that was my favorite part!

Really delicious and creamy. I added salt and pepper, but everything else followed the recipe. I made baked potatoes with it, and used the "gravy" over mine. Mmmmmmm! So easy, and really tasty!

The only modification I made as suggested was to season the flour lightly with garlic salt and sprinkle the chicken lightly with seasoned salt before flouring.  Otherwise it was awesome!

OMG! This is delicious!  And so easy too!  I absolutely loved this.  I did, however, make just a couple changes.  Instead of flour I used Italian breadcrumbs with some added seasoning which I then cooked for about 1-2 minutes, til slightly browned, on each side in EVOO in a pan...I was worried that if I only used flour it would fall off.  Everything else I did the same, with about 1 Tablespoon minced garlic in the baking pan as well.

My husband wasn't too keen of this recipe when I first tried it, so I spiced the flour up a bit the second time round. I added some chili powder, ground pepper, pinch of salt and sugar, and 1 tsp of parsley flakes along with half a teaspoon of dried fine herbs.

Instead of using just plain butter, I spit it in half with garlic butter.

I served it with cooked spaghetti and steamed asparagus spears

The difference was remarkable. I got rave reviews! Thanks for giving us the foundation for a good recipe that we can play around with.

Wow!! This was delicious. I added/changed a few different things. Instead of using cream I used a can of mushroom soup and added it to baby bella mushrooms and green peppers that I cut up and sauteed. I mixed the sautee and stirred in the mushroom soup. I added the mixture twenty minutes into the cooking process. I also took the other suggestions of seasoning the butter and the flour. In the flour I also added a few leaves of fresh basil. My boyfriend and I love it!! It is always fun to add your own flare to a great recipe. Delicious!!!

This was easy & tasty but the cream curdled so it wasn't very appealing to look at. I'd cook it again in a heartbeat if I knew how to keep it from curdling.
