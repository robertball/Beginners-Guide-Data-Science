This is a great recipe! Quick, easy and yummy! I did end up substituting milk instead of evaporated milk, fresh broccoli and tomatoes, omitting the peppers and adding green onions, simply because that's what I had in the fridge. I'll have to try the original recipe sometime since that sounds pretty good too.

I used fresh cooked broccoli rather than frozen and baked it in a 9 x 9 baking dish for about 60 minutes rather than in muffin cups.  The texture wasn't quite the smooth custard-like texture I expect from a quiche, so in that respect I was a little disappointed.  I'll probably try it again and use individual custard cups to see if that would make any difference, but I suspect it may have been the canned tomatoes.  Even though I drained them well, I wonder if the acidity might have changed the texture from what I'd normally expect.  I have a feeling I might prefer to omit the tomatoes from the quiche mixture and put sliced fresh tomatoes on top instead.  But that will take another test later.

I had to substitute coconut milk for the evaporated milk and it was very "custard" like with the 2 tbls of flour as recipe states.  However, I also used 6 eggs.   I call this my "KITCHEN SINK QUICHE" because I just use up what I have in the kitchen fridge.   I like others baked it i a large pan versus cupcakes and it made 12 generous pieces.  15 grams of carbs and approximately 140 calories.  These are perfect taken from freezer to work and microwave for lunch.  So quick and easy.

Tasty but too not enough custard. Iâ€™d cut the amount of milk and add more eggs. I drained the tomatoes but I suggest leaving them in a colander for a good 10 min. Before adding.

This was pretty good! Not very filling, but a nice side dish to something else small.
I used light cream instead of evaporated milk for a nice smooth texture, and added 1 finely chopped small potato. Make sure the broccoli is very finely chopped as well. No bell pepper for me, but I liked the flavor.
This ended up making 24 egg cups!

Used fresh broccoli that I steamed for about a minute, fresh tomatoes, and added diced mushrooms. Baked them in ramekins greased with butter. The mini quiches came out of the ramekins beautifully. No need to use a spatula. Had to increase the baking time a bit, probably due to the excess liquid of the added/fresh veggies. Will make this again, and will vary veggies, cheese, maybe add bacon or sausage.
