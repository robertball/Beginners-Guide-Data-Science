Let me preface by saying I combined this and the Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Apple recipe because I like apples and pecans :). I started the process on the stove with my cast iron skillet to ensure a caramelized brussels sprout and then moved to my oven for 15-20 minutes. Absolutely delicious, no bitter taste either. Note: next time I will toast the pecans on the stove top because they slightly burned in the oven.

I found this recipe when trying to replicate a restaurant dish.  It was a disappointment - bland result not worth the effort or ingredients.  I think perhaps a generous sprinkling of brown sugar may help tremendously but I'll look first for another recipe.

I made these tonight and substituted slivered almonds. Loved this recipe. I haven't had brussels sprouts in 40 years and was pleasantly surprised that I like them!

I followed this recipe as written, really don't like when people give a review of one they've changed.  My husband loved it, the pecans really gave the sprouts a different flavor.  Would made again in a heartbeat.

Needed more salt so I added Parmesan cheese and they were a little too dry so adjustment is needed on the olive oil

This is such a simple way to fix Brussels sprouts...we love it! I use pecan halves instead of chopping them, and add them about halfway through bake time because they brown too quickly. To those that thought this was too bland, try adding cooked, crumbled bacon before serving. So delicious!

Such an easy and great dish!  I cooked bacon in a cast iron skillet, and crystallized the brussel sprouts, and added the pecans.  I then cooked it in the oven for 15 minutes!  Definitely a keeper!

Rather than olive oil, I used virgin coconut oil and pink salt.  Absolutely delicious.  I generally could not stand Brussels sprouts, but these were delicious!

Hubs liked this; I thought it just tasted like cabbage, but I'm not a brussels sprouts fan by any means.  I used a lot less pecans and added in bacon and some chicken flavored seasoning.  I thought it was still a tad bland, but again, I don't like brussels sprouts so I don't think my opinion should count all that much.  The sprouts didn't really carmelize so maybe a hotter temp or a longer time baking and more seasoning?  Either way, hubs liked it and he will eat the leftovers so it's not all that bad, just not my taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it tonight. Fantastic  If you can't improvise stop cooking.. add a little butter and adjust the oil. Add Seasoning to your choice and enjoy.. Very tasty. Great review with my friends.. a keeper.  Add a couple tablespoons of bacon bits unless you prefer to take time out to cook bacon, if you're diet is willing.. if not, alittle bacon grease added for extra flavor instead of oil goes a long way and as always adds extra good flavor.

We had this as a side dish with roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.  It was perfect. 
It is also good reheated as leftovers.

Super simple dish that was enjoyed by all. Found the sprouts to be a bit dry when they were done so I added a couple Pat's of butter to moisten and enhance the flavor.

No taste and called for way too much pecans.
