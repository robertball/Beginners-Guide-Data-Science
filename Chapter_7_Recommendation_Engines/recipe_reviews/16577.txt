I haven't made this particular recipe, but I make one remarkably similar so thought I might suggest draining the cukes on a paper towel, using 1/2c sour cream & 1/2c yogurt & the ingredient I believe you're missing is sugar (to taste).  You'll be pleasantly surprised at the difference it'll make.  Enjoy.

Runny but tasty, and a bit bland. Needs dill or cayenne or something sprightly. A little anchovy paste would make it Ceasaresque. Fresh savory would be good too. A lot of the runnyness is from *over* blending - stop at the somewhat chunky Gaspacho stage and resist the temptation to hit the liquify button, otherwise you have... By golly, you have liquid cucumbers!

'Sweat' the cucumbers - peel, slice in half _lengthwise_, core, and cut halves into 1" crescents. Toss with a little salt and let pieces sweat in a collandar for a minimum 1 hr. Shake off the sweat (do not rinse, it's not salty any more) and queeze out whatever more water you can. Blend this and it will not be runny.

I did seed the cucumber, which appears to have eliminated the "runny" problem that another person described. 

All in all, I enjoyed this dressing very much.  It's a great, lite summer dressing.

This does turn out rather runny and I'd probably remove the seeds next time.  But it works pretty well if you actually toss the salad in the dressing and coat the vegetables.  Coincedentally, I found out that it's really tasty on potato chips as well.

I thought this recipe sounded great...very summery and light...but was very disappointed. I thought it was quite bland and couldn't quite figure out what it needed. But, to be fair, I did substitute regular pepper for white (didn't have any white on hand)and didn't measure all ingredients exactly. Still, I don't think that would have made a huge difference, as I did use all ingredients listed and used close to the amount recommended.

This dressing was okay, but lacked flavor.  I tried adding various spices, but to no avail.  Even after chilling overnight, the flavor did not intensify.

sorry, but i didn't like this dressing at all.  it was runny, but that makes it easier to use a small amount.  it was gritty and too strong in the pepper and garlic dept.  i will not make this again.

I honestly don't get why so many ppl are complaining about it being too runny and watery, as though it's such a disastrous thing. Yes, it's thin, but the recipe submitter never claimed it would be thick.  Just because it's white, it doesn't mean it's supposed to be thick like a ranch dressing!  I let mine sit overnight in the fridge and it thickened up a bit, but that really didn't bother me at all either way. The flavors really blend and are much stronger the next day. It's very garlicky the longer it sits, so next time I'll use half a clove of garlic. I'll also cut back a bit on the white pepper since it's quite strong. Or I might just use cracked black pepper.  Otherwise, it's a keeper! I love that there's no oil in it, so it's super healthy. I used fat free greek yogurt too. A nice change from the typical vinegar and oil-based dressing.

The taste was pretty good, but mine turned out a little runny as well.  Next time I'll play with the ingredients a little and try not to over blend.

I find this recipe a little bland as is.  To make it really good, I add a tablespoon of fresh grated onion (pref. yellow or white), a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise (helps to thicken it if you find it too thin, plus makes it less yogurty tasting), and about a tablespoon of dried dill.  Sesame seeds can be added for a little texture too -- works well as a dressing for falafel or a veggie wrap.  Note: the white pepper is key to this recipe.  I only use a dash of it because it is strong, but no other pepper will give the same taste.

This dressing tastes kinda like how tzatziki would taste as a salad dressing.  
Three stars as is written.  With modifications it was 5+++.  I followed the other reviewers and seeded the cucumbers.  I added fresh parsley, basil and dill to the food processor.  I made it a nice light green colour.  I also gave it a final drizzle of good olive oil (essential in salad dressing).  Tasted great.

Here's what I did to avoid the runny problem.  I pureed the cucumber and drained it through a small strainer.  I used the liquid part to make cucumber lemonade and used the pulp to make this dressing. I added dill as well and it worked out great!

This dressing indeed turns out runny as suggested by other reviewers, though the taste was good. I could not stop at the right stage when it is nearly at the gazpacho stage.Otherwise ok. Shall attempt again to stop at the right time.

A local restaurant serves a cucumber dressing that I love so I thought I'd give this a try.  Definitely seed the cucumber.  I found this recipe lacky something also as some of the other reviewers did.  I think it needs more salt and I don't know what else.  I will make it again and play with it though.

I made a great cucumber salad with this recipe.  What I did was omit the cukes from the dressing, and just put the dressing over some diced cucumbers.  Not runny at all!  I also used 1/2 Vegenaise (healthy mayo) and 1/2 plain yogurt.

I like the taste of this dressing but it is quite runny...I only had sour cream on hand so I used a cup of that instead of the plain yogurt and I seeded my cucumber as directed by other viewers. I also did not have white pepper so I used 1/4 tsp. of freshly ground black pepper.I will try this again with modifications!!

Reason why it may be runny is that the cuccumber must be squeezed to get all the moisture out.  It's an old trick.  This is truly delicious and you can use as much garlic as you choose.  You can also use jarred garlic.  And sometines I eliminate the lemon.  Don't forget to add powdered mint.  Just rub the dried mint leaves between both palms and that will give you that fine powdered little addition to your creamy cuccumber dressing.

I made this recipe to accompany the Vegetable Biryani from this site as it had essentially the same base as an Indian raita (yogurt dip). I read the reviews before I made it and made modifications accordingly. I added fresh parsley, cilantro, basil and dill to the food processor with the cucumber which I seeded. Instead of lemon I used lime since I had none. I also drizzled a bit of olive oil in at the end. I served this on top of a simple baby spinach salad that had grape tomatoes and red onions in it with the vegetable biryani. I cook Indian food a lot, this was a nice way to incorporate a salad into the meal with  an Indian theme. This would also go well with Mediterranean/Greek/middle eastern cuisine, I would definitley make this again!

The directions should have included to remove seeds from cucumbers and to sweat them.  Something was missing even after I added more spices.  Maybe a lil sugar would help.  I would also use half yogurt and half sour cream.

The only reason this is 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is a bit too runny. I made this tonight and it is AMAZING! I had to leave out the white pepper because I don't have any, but the flavor was fantastic anyway. I also used greek yogurt instead of the more traditional yogurt, which may be why mine was less bland than some of the previous reviews.

This was perfect what what I needed.  I used Greek yogurt and Enlish cucumbers.  The texture was good for the chicken and veggie pita snadwiches we made.

I didn't like the texture of this.  Yogurt is not the right consistency to get a truly "creamy" dressing.  I liked the flavor but next time I make it I will try half yogurt and half mayo to get a creamier texture.  Also, I would recommend straining the yogurt a little over cheesecloth so that the end result was not quite as "thin".

This is a great and (more) tasty change store bought brands!  I used mayo and added a tsp. of dill.  After chopping the cucumbers I drained on a paper towel (as other reviewers did).  This is a keeper and a great way to use my garden cucumbers.

Going from the suggestions of others, I added some fresh dill to the mix, and since I didn't have any plain yogurt on hand, I instead used light sour cream.  The dressing was a little runnier than most people are used to, but I tossed the greens in the dressing instead of just drizzling over top of the salad.  I served it with poached salmon and the combination was delicious!

I added dill to this after tasting it. I think I should have seeded the cucumbers and the texture would have been much nicer.

I expected this dressing to be a bit thicker. But it is very flavorful. It went well with leftover ground lamb. We made pita pockets with red onion, lettuce and tomato.

Added a bit of dill, and replaced regular salt with garlic salt. A bit runny but still tasty. I would suggest removing seeds from the cucumber and blotting it with a paper towel first.

I can't believe how many negative comments there are. It's a lovely light summer dressing you could use in many ways.  I poured it over sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and onion for a cucumber salad. Very nice.
I did thicken with 50/50 yogurt/sour cream. I calculated the calories and it's only 54 per tablespoon using fat free yogurt and fat free sour cream. Lite flavor and lite in calories.

very yummy.  Made this with mayo instead, but next time I would probably half and half. I added some dill and it made such a difference.  We served this with our fried zucchini.  Next time I would shred a little cucumber and add to the sauce.

Wasn't as sweet as I would expect for a dressing but it was wonderful when paired with the gourmet chicken salad recipe.

I gave it the rating I gave it because I used MAYONNAISE instead of yogurt after reading about the poor outcome using yogurt.  I was looking for a salad dressing that wasn't so "vinegary".  This is a good dressing for veggie dips too.  I plan to make it for Super Bowl Sunday.

Many have issues with it being runny. Try using an English cucumber. They are denser than a standard cucumber. You can also squeeze some of the liquid out before adding it to the recipe.

I desperately am looking for a reasonably good homemade creamy or ranch cucumber dressing redipe. This was not close. Too sour, too watery. Not a good flavor at all.

Loved the fresh cucumber taste.  I felt the amount of garlic I used overpowered some of the flavor.  I'll just use a bit less next time.  Nice change of pace dressing.

Used recipe as a guide. Shredded the cuke and wrung out in triple thick paper towels (over sink).  Added 1/2 mayo and 1/2 greek yoghurt and a bit of ginger in addition to spices listed in recipe. Dressing turned out thick and just a bit of a kick to it. Used on BLT pasta salad. Tasty.

Great, use vanilla chobani or a thicker tangy yogurt with a bit of sugar already in it.

very delicious.  Exactly the same as the sauce put on a doner kepab (very popular pork sandwich in germany)
