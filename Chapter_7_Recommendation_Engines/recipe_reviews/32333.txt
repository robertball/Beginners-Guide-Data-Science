Served this at a baby shower, it wasn't too sweet or too tart. Perfect! I used cranberry gingerale which gave the punch a kind of pinkish tint and froze the gingerale in a bundt pan, which made a really pretty ice ring.  Everyone loved it.

I used this recipe for a bridal shower. It met such rave reviews, the bride decided to use it for the wedding. All in attendance at the wedding were very impressed. Using fruit in the icering was pretty and very tasty once the ice melted.

I recently served this punch at a party and it was a big hit!!!  It was easy to prepare.  The ice ring elegant added an elegant touch to my punch bowl.  I had to keep refilling it for my guests which was an indication of how much they liked it.  It was thoroughly enjoyed by all!!!!

I thought this was a great and easy punch and it made a lot.  We ended up with leftovers because we had a small crowd.  My husband and I froze half of a 2L of Ginger Ale in ice cube trays and the other half we left in the bottle and froze.  Then we cut the bottle away and floated that in the punch.  It didn't look as pretty as ring might of, but our round (fluted) cake pan is two parts and we figured the ginger ale would run out.  After the frozen giger ale thawed, it turned the punch slushy and made it even better.  I will definatley make this again!!

I served this at my son's first birthday party yesterday.  I needed a clear punch because of the kids that would be here.  It was perfect... the punch bowl was completely empty at the end of the party! Everyone RAVED & several have already asked me for the recipe... Men & women liked it... not too sweet... just perfect! :-)

I chose to make this for a bridal shower.  I wanted a non-staining punch that was different than the standard slush/punch served at showers.  I also made an ice ring of ginger ale with frozen strawberries.  Everyone loved it.

My best friend and I like it so much that we figured out how to make a pitcher-sized amount for home consumption: 1 litre ginger ale + two 6-oz cans pineapple juice + 1/3 can frozen white grape juice concentrate +  12 oz water.

I picked this recipe recently for my niece's shower because of the lack of color.  My niece's wedding colors are mocha & champagne.  Everyone loved it!  Besides it looking beautiful it was so tasty but not too sweet.  Here in Texas it has been extremely hot this summer so this was a real hit on a very hot day!

It tasted really good too.

Excellent punch. I used sparkling white grape juice for a little more fizz. I also froze the ginger ale in regular ice cube trays with a frozen raspberry in each cube to float in the punch. It looked so pretty. I made this for a bridal shower and it was a definite hit.

I used this recipe for my parent's 50th anniversary party and it turned out great.  The golden color of the punch along with the ice ring made a wonderful presentation.  I will definitely use this recipe again because it was easy to make and tasted great.

First punch i ever made, made it for a bridal shower and the guests kept coming back for more!  Already have requests for it for a bachelorette party next month (only will probably sub real bubbly for the ginger ale here;-P).  very simple and delicious.  I did think it was a bit too pineapple-y so I doubled the grape juice and added more ginger ale.. I used half regular ginger ale, half raspberry ginger ale and floated both real raspberries and raspberries frozen in ice cubes in the punch.  We served it with little scoops of raspbery sorbet using a melon baller.  Yum!

I tried this punch for my best friend's bridal shower.  Everyone loved it.  It wasnt too sweet, and quenched your thirst.  I added strawberries and blueberries to the ice ring.  I would definately use this again.

I made this for my friend's baby shower.  The ice ring was way too big for my punch bowl.  All the ingredients were already chilled so no ice ring was no big deal.  I substituted  sparkling grape juice for half of the white grape juice.  The extra bubbles were fun and the sparkling grape juice isn't as sweet.  All in all the "champagne" was a hit.

I made this at Christmas.  We are diabetic so I used the diet gingerale, Welch's white grape juice is unsweetened and so was the pineapple juice.

Instead of doing the ring, I added a package of Europe's Best frozen berries (blackberries, raspberries, etc.).  I even froze some grapes and dumped them in periodically.

I mixed it all and put some in a ZipLock storage container and froze it then added it to the punch bowl to keep it cold.

I ended up freezing about half of the punch in a few ZipLock storage containers and this made it even better.  The colour of the assorted berries went into the punch.  

Everyone absolutely loved this, especially as the colour deepened as the colour & flavours of the berries set into it.  I will definately make this again.

You can make this ahead of time and take it frozen or partialy defrosted if you're taking it to another location.

I made this for a Halloween party, mainly for drivers and such as an alternative to soda.  However, it was so popular, even among the drinkers (who found it goes really well with coconut rum), that I made another batch and there was hardly any left.  In keeping with the Halloween theme, I floated some wax lips in the punch bowl and added ice cubes made from Hawaiian Punch that sort-of "bled" when they melted. Nice presentation and rave reviews from guests.

Awesome punch!!  I used it for my father-in-laws 85th birthday celebration.  To give it a little more kick, I used Welch's sparkling white grape juice.  I used the party champagne glasses and there were bubbles in every glass, very classy!! I also made six small ice rings done up in muffin tins that floated around the top, very festive!!

This was great.  I used white grape peach juice, ginger ale and pineapple juice.  Everyone really liked it.  A few people even added a little Moscato white wine.

Yummy! I served this at a bridal shower with the theme of "honeymoon". Served in wine glasses, really cute!;) In my ice ring, I froze fresh blueberries (only thing I could find), added a lot to the theme of the party! FUN!

I loved this- quick and oh so easy. I let my 4 young kids try it following the recipe exactly and they thought it was just ok. You know kids can have such a sweet tooth- so the batch I made for a 1st grade Christmas party I substituted 7 up or some lemon-lime soda for the Ginger Ale. That simple change made it a hit for the young ones. (Then again, I preferred it with the Ginger Ale- more of a mock champagne taste, and not as sweet.) So keep in mind who the punch will be serving and tweak the ingredients and items in the ice ring as needed. **Great punch for kids' b-day parties and school parties where you do not want to chance a stained carpets!!!**

This was a HIT at my party.  Instead of an ice ring, I made ice cubes of ginger ale with a strawberry set in each cube.  It looked gorgeous and the drink was gone in literally ten minutes.  Make a large batch!

Yum!  I made this for a baby shower and used cranberry ginger ale since it's pink and the mom is expecting a girl.  It was great!  After the guests left, I added some vodka to the left over punch and it was a much-needed after party drink!

I have to give this 5 stars as everyone drank this up happily, during a Christmas gathering and I didn't get a chance to taste it.  Will make it again this weekend for a family birthday.

This punch was really really good.....I think.  I actually didn't get any though.  I made 4 batches for a wedding with right around 100 guests.  We ran out fast.  When figuring your quantity and using the recipes "40 servings"  keep in mind that those servings are around 5 oz. and that most adults drink more than that especially when served with nuts and cake as frequently the case at showers and receptions.

I got a lot of compliments on this... I didnt make the ring because I dont own a punch bowl (and didnt need 40 servings) so I mixed the white grape juice and the pineapple juice in a pitcher, froze a tall glass of white grape juice and then put it in the mixture.  It lasted for a 4 hour party and I even refilled the pitcher once.  I served with the ginger ale on the side so guests could "mix" their own drink and then garnished with a frozen blackberry.  Very pretty.

This is delicious and refreshing!  This is the third time I've made this and I always get rave reviews.  I have yet to make the ice ring.  I make sure my ingredients are nice and cold and then mix the white grape juice, pineapple juice and 1 bottle of ginger-ale together.  I float raspberries on top and garnish with mint leaves when I can get them.  Very easy and elegant.

This recipe is PERFECT for any afternoon or brunch gathering where you want to serve something that looks special and tastes special...but without the alcohol. I switch up the fruit garnish depending on the color theme of the gathering...blueberries for a boy baby shower...raspberry of strawberry for a girl...pineapple or kiwi for neutral...use your imagination!!

This is the only punch recipe I now use.  Each time I serve it, I have many requests for the recipe.  Kids and adults both seem to like it.  For halloween, I used ice trays with gummy body parts for the ice cubes, where usually I use the ice ring with fruit to make it pretty.  People always like this instead of the standard punch recipe with sherbert, which I never serve b/c I don't care for it.  This seems to please everyone!

I made this for my daughter's wedding shower and everyone loved it!!  I didn't use the pineapple juice, but used cranberry juice instead and it was wonderful.  Everyone that was there has asked me for the recipe and I have used it again and again!  I am the official punch maker of the family now!

Wonderful, very easy punch!  I used diet ginger ale because several at the baby shower were watching calories and you couldn't tell a difference.  It was a hit!  I tripled the recipe and barely had enough!!!

I did make a few changes, but this punch was great!  I just used one can of frozen white grape concentrate and one can of frozen pineapple concentrate and mixed that with 4 liters of ginger ale and ice.  Between only seven people, we drank the entire thing!

Very good and very easy!  I made a raspberry version of this for a bridal shower and everyone loved it.  I substituted raspberry ginger ale for the regular ginger ale and added raspberry sherbert.  It makes a TON, so be sure to use a BIG punch bowl!!  You couldn't really see the lemon and orange slices that I put in the ice ring though (maybe because it was pink?), and remember that the ginger ale will expand some in the freezer so don't fill the ring to the top.  It's easy to replenish the bowl (IF you need seconds) since it takes only one of everything (no need to make more than one ice ring though).  Thanks!  I will definitely make this again.

This was a great deal too sweet for all of us. So for those who want something even remotely reminiscent of a champagne-like tartness and complexity, I do not recommend this. It is probably a good choice for a kid's party though.

I served this at a baby shower in October and everyone loved it and several people have asked for the recipe.  I've served it at 2 baby showers since then and at all of them, there's never a drop left at the end of the shower!!  I didn't change anything about the recipe.  However, some people did add a splash of champagne to their cup to add a little something extra.

This was ok; I didn't make the whole serving, nor did I freeze the ginerale.  I mixed all the ingredients together and served.  My guests drank it, but no one was breaking my door down asking for the recipe.

PERFECT!  This champagne was just the cutest way to start out a baby shower that I hosted!!  When you pour this into a glass it gets the exact same little foamy hed that champagne does.  Also, it was so delicious!  Really light and refreshing, most of my guests enjoyed several glasses of it.  I just chilled all of the ingredients really well before I mixed them into a pitcher and then poured the "champagne" into glasses as guests arrived.  I am going to use it as an alternative to champagne for the next baby shower I am hosting so guests can make Mommymosas!!  How Cute!  This is a wonderful recipe that I plan to use over and over again as a fun alternative for non-drinkers that isn't the typical overly sweet drink.

I made this yesterday for a baby shower.  The guest of honor wanted something sparkling, not too sweet, and simple.  I did not do the ice ring because I did not have time, but it was fine adding regular ice cubes to it.  I used just the one 2-liter of ginger ale in it, and it was delicious!  Everyone loved it, some asked for the recipe.  It was quick and easy and just sweet enough with a touch of fizz.  And one of the guests added a bit of vodka to his glass - said it was terrific that way, too!

I made this for a bridal shower a few months ago and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  Instead of the ice ring, I froze raspberries in ginger ale in ice cube trays.  I'm making it again for a baby shower next month.

Love this mock chamagne! I served it for my baby shower and everyone loved it! I usually don't like punch but this one is perfect- not too sweet. I got tons of compliments and a few people asked for the recipe. Made it with sparkling grape juice and it was perfect. I especially love the ice ring since it doesn't water down the punch. It was all gone before the ring melted anyways :)

I served this for dinner when I made the "Juicy Pork chops".  This drink was fabulous.    I didn't have time for the ice ring.  I just threw the ingredients together and stuck it in the freezer for a few hours.  Still turned out great.

Great punch reciepe.  Something different from your normal punches and so easy, no measuring :)  I like to make the frozen raspeberry ice ring suggested by other users but be aware that fresh raspeberries will change the color a bit while melting.  Love this!

This is a very easy and very tasty punch for parties and showers.  It has become the baby shower standard in our family.  It is nice and light, particularly for summer.  I like to substitute sparkling grape juice for the white grape juice.  Also, to make it easier, I dispense with the complicated ice ring and place a raspberry or strawberry slice into ice cube trays,  fill them with ginger ale and pop the cubes into the punch bowl.

I made this for a baby shower, got many rave reviews. I definitely recommend garnishing with a rasberry or strawberry to give the illusion of champagne. I bought plastic champagne glasses for fun, it was very cute. Instead of an ice ring I made ginger ale ice cubes out of my various shaped ice cube trays.

This is a wonderful non-alcoholic party drink for adults. It taste great rather you use SPARKLING white grape juice or the REGULAR, either way it's delicious and everyone will love it. 
By the way, it will not stain your carpet.

Nice, clean taste, but it didn't receive any rave reviews at a recent baby shower.  Didn't see anyone go back for seconds.  Not that it tasted bad, by any means, it just didn't have much "punch."

Excellent! I used sparkling white grape juice instead of regular (that's why 4 stars, not 5). It was a big hit. Made an ice ring with cocktail cherries frozen in it. I got a lot of compliments and was asked for the recipe by a few people.

This was a nice punch, a tad too sweet for my taste, but went over great at the baby shower I hosted.  I used diet gingerale and unfortunately couldn't make an ice ring as my punch bowl isn't large enough to accomodate one.  Froze some raspberries in gingerale in ice cube trays instead.  Good recipe.

I used sparkling grape juice and put fresh raspberries in the ice ring. It was perfect. Close to real champagne taste, but just sweet enough so that the young girls at the bridal shower enjoyed it too. Everyone commented on how good it tasted and how pretty it looked. I enjoyed how easy it was to put together. What else could I ask for? Thanks for a great recipe; I'm saving this one for all my parties!

I used this punch for a baby shower I just hosted.  The mom's maiden name is Golden and that's exactly the color of this punch!  It was so good I had to have someone go to the store for me so I could make more!  Wasn't sickeningly sweet and doesn't have a ton of sugar.  I had to give out the recipe to several people.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great. I dyed it purple for my best friend's 25th B-day "Purple Party" and served it in martini glasses with purple sugar around the rims. Such a cute effect! Thanks for this easy recipe that allowed me to devote more time to decorating her birthday cake! PS: Leftover "Champagne" was delicious with rum...

This was excellent, but I didn't need it for a crowd, just a small group for a dinner party.  I put about 1/3 pineapple juice, 1/3 white grape juice and ice in a blender for just a minute, then poured into individual glasses adding 1/3 gingerale with a quick stir.  I served it with appetizers.  It was very refreshing.  Everyone loved it.  I put the extra into a small pitcher and set it on the table.  It was empty when we moved from the patio into the dining room for dinner. I will do this again.

I made the punch for a candle party and everyone loved it. I added raspberries, blueberries, and strawberrys in the gingerale ice ring. I also used raspberry gingerale and rasberry sherbert. It gave it a nice flavor and a pink color. Delicious!

Very good, but makes a LOT. My punch bowl holds about 1/3 of the total if I have an ice ring. Suggest mixing ingredients in a huge bowl first, then pouring what you need in and refrigerating the rest. Every time I've made this, it's been gone by the end of the night, it's very good. I personally prefer more fizz, so sometimes I substitute 2 bottles sparkling grape juice for the 1 larger bottle plain juice.

I made this exactly as presented for my daughter's first communion brunch.  It went over well with the adults as well as the children.  As recommended by another reviewer, I made an ice ring in my bundt pan out of an additional 1-liter of ginger ale & apackage of fresh raspberries to keep the punch cold.  I liked this better than "regular" punches with sherbert floating in them.  It has a nice light, crisp taste.

This was very good. I used a sparkling grape juice and didn't bother with the ice ring. I think it's the sweetness from the pineapple juice that makes it taste so good.

I made this punch yesterday for a baptism/christening party. It was a HUGE hit with kids and adults alike. I ended up making a second batch because it was consumed so quickly. I used a bundt cake pan and poured all of the ginger ale in all at once to freeze in to a pretty 'ice' ring.  It came out perfectly. I highly recommend this punch!

This was great. It couldn't have been easier to make- just mix everything into the punch bowl! I made it in 2 batches since my bowl was too small to hold the whole recipe. I floated orange slices on the top and dropped in some marischino cherries for color. We had a party for about 15 people and they drank every last drop. I'll definitely make this again.***I had to come back and add this- my husband isn't big on punches or ginger ale, but he cannot get enough of this! I can't count how many times we've made it since we first tried it. He keeps making it up and keeping it in a jug in the fridge. Thanks for such a great drink!!

I made this punch for a bridal shower and it turned out great. I served it in drink dispensers so instead of a nice ring I used muffins pans to make frozen ginger ale cubes to chill the punch.

Made this for a retirement reception at work and it was perfect! After mixing the grape and pineapple juices, plus one bottle of ginger ale, I tasted it and added a little more soda to reduce the fruitiness.  The melting ice ring also helps with this.  It makes a nice accompaniment to cake/cookies.  You can't go wrong with this one.  Everyone loved it.

Big hit at the Ladies Luncheon on a very hot day. Some mixed the punch with unsweetened tea for a type of "Arnold Palmer". Will definitely make punch and ice ring again.

I made this for my daughter's graduation party two years ago. Children and adults couldn't get enough. I still get requests to make this for family gatherings.

It was good but definitely missing something. I'm not sure what it is. 
I might play around with different juices next time around.

I have made this punch SO many times, and always to rave reviews.  It's so easy and the ingredients are cheap.  Just remember to chill everything very well before mixing.

Excellent.  We used pineapple sherbet instead of an ice ring, and it was really yummy.  I could see how sparkling white grape juice would be good, but we used the regular kind and it was tasty.  Thanks!

This punch was a huge hit!  I made it three times this season - for an ornament swap with my mother's friends, our neighborhood gift swap and a Christmas party with friends - everyone loved it, kids and grown-ups alike.  Thanks!!

Delicious! Great tasting punch and pretty color too. I made an ice ring with pineapples slices and peach slices. (I missed that part on rasberries and only had those fruits on hand.) : ) I also froze a few cups of pinapple juice and used my ice shaver to shave those into the bowl. Made a nice slushy drink!

I served this at a baby shower and it was a success! Note - it makes a LARGE bowl of punch to serve LOTS! The ice ring with raspberries is a nice touch as well.

Tried this for a large retirement party and it was a HUGE hit.  The staff association even asked me for the recipe!  I had one large punch bowl and one small punch bowl so I did the ginger ale ice ring in the large one and a bunch of muffin tin ginger ale ice cubes in the small one.  Worked great!

This was fabulous!  The first time, I made it as-is and the guests at the baby shower were guzzling it!  I froze raspberries in my ginger ale ring and it looked gorgeous floating in the punch.  I made it a second time a few weeks later for a birthday party for my co-worker's elderly parents.  The second time, I used sparkling apple-grape juice and it didn't really affect the taste much but did make it bubblier.  The elderly guests loved it so much that we had to put the punch into a pitcher and walk around refilling because we couldn't scoop it from the punch bowl fast enough!  Great recipe!!

I used this for a baby shower and everyone loved it even the small children. I made small gingerale ice blocks with raspberries in them and added sliced strawberries.  I received many compliments, however it tastes more like a mimosa rather that champagne. and most likley next time i would use sparkling grape juice to make it more bubbly.

Very good! I got many good compliments from it on sunday night at a cmas party I hosted. I used two bottles of sparkling white grape juice and made little ice rings out of ginger ale in a mini bundt pan. I put marashino cherries in the ice ring and the punch.

I used this punch for a baby shower at work.  I was looking for something with simple ingredients and easy to make.  We actually made up a 1/2 recipe, due to our punch bowl being on the small side.  This was a great punch and I'll use it for other occasions as well.

I read the other reviews for this punch so I figured it had to be good!  Boy, was I wrong!  I made this for my sister's wedding reception because we weren't allowed to serve alcoholic beverages and we thought this would make a nice substitute.  It was awful!  I heard MANY people complaining about it throughout the entire reception.  We eventually ended up offering the guests plain ginger ale or grape juice to drink.

I made this for my bridal shower and everyone was so impressed.  I didn't hold back I added a ton of things to the ice ring. I couldn't find any edible flowers so I dressed mine w/ mint leaves and cut up pieces of fruit like pink grapefruit, star fruit, mango, orange slices.  Also, instead of using a plain old bundt cake pan I purchased a decorative one from a specialty store.  It was exceptionally pretty.  I'll definately be making it again .....Maybe for my Baby shower....that remains to be seen!  Thanks

This is so delicious!  Made it exactly as written for a baby shower and it was not nearly enough!  I had many other beverage choices, but it was gone in less than 10 minutes.  Next time I will double or even triple the recipe.  Also, I might try Cranberry Ginger Ale for Mock Pink Champagne!

Yum!  This was a good-tasting punch.  If you like sparkling white grape juice, then you will like this recipe, because that's exactly what it tasted like to me.  I like that it's a simple punch, you don't have to freeze anything beforehand (unless you want an ice ring).  I would make this again.

It was refreshing.  I didn't do the ice rings just mixed it together and put in a pitcher and kept in the fridge.  I added extra ginger ale every so often to bubble it up.

This was the perfect punch.  Perfect for adults my nieces (ages 5 & 7) were not thrilled.  I ended up making an ice ring of pineapples and pineapple juice to put in the bowl I also put in individual frozen strawberries.  and everyone drank up I ended up making about 3 bowls worth of it a definite keeper.

To spring this up higher one must realize that wine has tartare in it. Although one could add cream of tartare  in it,  to really give the punch the added 'punch' use concentrated black tea. For that amount, boil 4 tea bags in 1.5 cup of water for 3-5 min, or till it reduces to a cup  ... chill and add. Also, don't use still grape juice but use sparkling grape juice.  I've had a confirmed alcoholic get high thinking it was the real stuff ... he sobered up when told it had no alcohol!!

This punch was a big hit at my daughter's baby shower - every bit went (and a double batch had been made!). It is now going to be served at my daughter-in-law's baby shower next month. A number of guests had asked for the recipe and were shocked that there were only three simple ingredients!

This is the best punch ever! It is so refreshing! I usually just serve in a dispenser with ginger ale ice cubes. Even the kids love it!

I was plesantly surprised by this recipe. It does resemble champagne and tastes wonderful. I served it in my champagne glasses garnished with an orange wedge and cherry.

A very tasty punch and extremely easy!  I've made this on two separate occasions at work.  Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  My recipe now lives in the punch bowl so it's always ready when needed.

Absolutely delicious!!!  My new favoriate punch.  It was soooo very easy.  I did not make the ice ring; just chilled everything & mixed 1/2 bottle gingerale, 1/2 can pineapple juice, & 1/2 bottle white grape juice because that is all my punch bowl will hold at a time.  KEEP THIS ONE - VERY EASY.
