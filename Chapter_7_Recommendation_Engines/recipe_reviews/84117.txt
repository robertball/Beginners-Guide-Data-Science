I've had a version of this recipe for several years now - the only difference is that mine calls for 2 Tablespoons (instead of 2 teaspoons) of crushed red pepper and an extra 1/3 cup of canola oil.  I guess you can use any amount of pepper, depending on how spicy you want them!  I don't use a jar - I just dump the crackers in a large mixing bowl and pour the dressing over the top, and stir gently every 15 minutes with a large nylon mixing spoon for about an hour until all the oil is absorbed. Store in Ziplock bags.  We call them 'Hot Crackers' ('Firecrackers' at 4th of July) - they are awesome, and people always ask for the recipe!  You definitely can't eat just one!  They also make great gifts in a pretty bag tied with raffia and dried red peppers, and the recipe attached.

Wow, these certainly turned out to be a pleasant surprise! I had never heard of anything like this before and couldn't imagine how they would turn out. I definitely had my doubts, but because I was so intrigued by this recipe I just had to give it a try. Although the recipe states that the crackers would be crispy, I really thought that they would be quite soggy due to the oil. Man, was I ever wrong! Didn't have any dry ranch dressing mix on hand, so I used an Italian blend. And it's true, the longer they sit the better they get. So yummy Yvette and no, I couldn't eat just one!!!!!!! Thanks so much!!!!

We prefer the Chex cereal to the oyster crackers.  If you do use the Chex cereal you need to cut the oil back to about 1/4 cup or it just lays in the bottom of the container and is a greasy mess.  This is a tasty and easy recipe and I make about 3 versions of it a week!  My kids like it better than any other chips I might buy!  Yeah - it is that good!  I get more fiber in them too by using the whole grain Chex cereals BONUS there! Loose the fat and calories, up your fiber and try the Chex whole grains with 1/4 cup of EVOO or canola.  Add half of that to your cereal and blend well.  Add more if you need to but a little at a time.  Once coated- add your dry ingredients.  Love this stuff!!!

We love this recipe.  I changed it up for fun.  I still kept the 1 cup oil.  I added 1/2 cup grated parmesian cheese, and 1/8 cup of garlic powder and some herbs (substitutional)

I also opted for the oyster crackers after reading reviews.  I used olive oil instead and used the leftover crushed red pepper packets from the pizza deliveries along with some parmasean cheese.  Even our 1 year old was addicted, all my husbands student/employees kept going to the bag I sent with him to work and they ate it all!  We will prepare a huge jug bi-weekly for sure.

I have had these crackers twice at Christmas parties where the hostess did not want the recipe known. The ingredients had been revealed to me but not the amounts. They are unusual and delicious and I am overjoyed to have found the recipe here.

I used a large bag of oyster crackers instead of saltines and my own homemade dry ranch seasoning mix. I've always baked these only because I like that oil to really get into the crackers. 250* for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes was just right for me. These turned out really well but I think the oil could be cut back a touch. GREAT movie snack.

I can't stop eating these!  I subbed oyster crackers for saltines (that way they're bite-sized) and used about 2/3 c oil to cut down on fat.  Mixed everything together in a gallon ziploc...YUM!

These are a hit at our house! I don't use crackers, I use pretzels - the kids fight over them at home and at school! The first time I made these I thought it was crazy pouring the oil over (I used pretzels and goldfish crackers that time) and thought it would all go in the garbage. Boy, was I wrong! Do as the recipe states and just keep stirring. These really do get better with time, the heat picks up the longer they sit.  What I do: I put the pepper flakes into the oil ahead of time, so the oil gets infused with the flavor. I then mix in about 3 T. ranch dressing mix (you can buy it in bulk at warehouse stores). I fill my large bowl (I use the largest stainless from Ikea) with pretzels, leaving just enough stirring room. I pour the oil mix over and stir. If it seems too 'wet' I just add more pretzels until there is no oil pooled in the bottom of the bowl. The pretzels (or whatever you are using) will be 'wet' with the oil, but no excess. I usually sprinkle a little more ranch mix as I'm stirring too.  Then, just stir occasionally! I've used pretzels, goldfish, chex cereals, etc. Just toss in whatever you have. Great recipe!!!

An interesting way to spice up plain saltine crackers - the seasoning gives them bite! I think I put in too many chili flakes because mine were a little spicy, but otherwise these were good for a snack, just on their own.

I love these crackers.  My sister in law has been making them for years and I loved them.  I finally wanted to make them myself and found this recipe. Its easy and taste great.  I used wheat crackers, made me think its healthy and I can eat more.

I've been making these for years and the only seasoning that isn't listed here is garlic powder- I wouldn't make these without it.  I've been making these for years with oyster crackers or the mini Premium brand saltines.

These were packed w/ great flavor but I thought they were a little salty. I don't think I will use the entire pkg of ranch mix next time. I did use saltines because that's what I had but I'll use oyster crackers next time. Thanks JDCOMPTON!

Used 1/2 cup oil with 24 oz. of oyster crackers and it was enough to get the spices and cheese to stick. (2 teas. hot pepper flakes, 2 teas. garlic powder, 1/4 cup italian herbs, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese).  A keeper!

This is a great recipe but my only comment is how can it say that the prep time is 5 minutes when the recipe clear says to roll the jar every 5 minutes for about 1 hour?  I think the recipe should be more truthful about the true prep time.

Have made several times, changing around each time.  We like to put about 1 t of onion powder and 1 t garlic powder along with the other stuff.  Sometimes we add extra pepperflakes also.  Totally enjoy!!

My friend and I make something very similar. We use a package of Ranch dip and 2 tbsp of dry dill weed. Put crackers in 2 big brown paper sacks (this allow the oil to soak into the crackers enough to flavor them but you are not left with a glass jar/crackers full of oil at the end). Shake well to coat and leave for 24 hours. Delicious!

I made these will all olive oil.  I won't do that again because although olive oil is flavorful and wonderful, it was just too much.  They will be better with the oil the recipe calls for.

I have made this a few times, the first as written except with about 3 times as much crushed red pepper (we like it spicy).  Since then I've used Chex cereal instead of and in combination with the oyster crackers, both with success. My one suggestion is let this sit for at least a few days before serving.  The spice of the ranch and pepper takes at least that long to blend and absorb into the crackers or cereal.

these were great. I used the little oyster crackers, red chili flakes, white pepper, and garlic powder. Heateed the oil and seasonings in the microwave and tossed with crackers. Great on top of soup or as a snack

Caution - Highly Addictive.  I usually make a double batch of crackers with original amount of oil.  We like to mix oyster crackers with a variety of the flavors of CheezIts such as smokey cheddar, pepper jack, and regular.  We like things spicy too so I double the red pepper flakes and once added Frank's hot sauce to the oil (didn't really like the flavor that added though and won't do again).  Between the salt and the oil, I hate to admit to liking these so much.  Oh well.  Grab a beer and a football game and we're good to go.

These were great. Everybody loved them. I used oyster crackers and the mini saltines combined. I did add parmesan cheese when they were done. I added 1/4 tsp dill weed and a TBS of garlic powder to the dressing mix.

Even my 10&12yo kids enjoyed these! I'm trying a 2nd time using half olive oil and half canola, adding a little Parmesan, the red pepper flakes, and some cayenne. This is the copycat recipe I've been looking for for Texas Firecrackers, which sell for $5.79 for 1/2-pkg at a local store!

I make these using Oyster Crackers to send to the troops overseas with the organization bakinggals.com The guys seem to love them!  When I make them for me I cut the oil by 1/3 and it seems to work just as well.  Thanks DebAC!

Was curious and had to try it. Its tasty. I would have been tastier if I didn't put too much oyster crackers in it. Family liked it too.

These were really good!  I used oyster crackers and red pepper powder as I didn't have any flakes.

These are a huge hit! Made them with oyster crackers the first time and they were gone in a day. On the second batch, I used store brand corn and rice "chex" cereal, pretzels and peanuts.  Delicious! I will cut down on the oil next time, however, as they are pretty greasy.  Thank you for the recipe.

Loved these. I took the advice of others and only used about 1/2 cup of oil. I used 3 different types, canola, grapeseed and safflower.  Very tasty and addicting!  I'll add more chili flakes next time.  I had no packets of dry salad dressing so I just added onion salt, garlic powder and italian herbs. Wonderful!

Love this, family loves it.  I used oyster crackers, Cheese Itz and pretzel sticks instead of just saltines.  The best!  And super easy.

These are great for parties, gifts or for traveling.  I have been making these for years.  You can also use the Fiesta Hidden Valley mix for a spicy cracker.  My family prefers the fiesta flavoring with extra pepper flakes.

These are amazing!   I used Oyster Crackers and Vegatable oil because that's what I hand on hand. They turned out amazing! Increased the red pepper flakes for more spice.

A friend of mine gave me this recipe. I tried it and took it to the school where I teach. They were gone by lunch! Tried it with oyster crackers too. My 13 year old son prefers oyster crackers because they're easier to grab. I'm also going to try it with the mini saltines. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe.  Easy and good.  You can also try varying the spices for different tastes...such as a curry mix, or even sugar and brown sugar for a sweeter flavor...combinations are endless.

i agree that 2 tablespoons of crushed red peppers is more to our liking,  I've been making these for several years now and realy like adding wheat chex, and dried cranberries ,  on occasion if i have a little mixed nuts ,sesame sticks,  wasabi peas, what ever may be hanging out in the cabinet needing used up ,  And since  the oz. size of oyster crackers have decreased this helps round out the measurments .

I love it and will absolutely make it again. The easiest snack I have ever made!!  The only downfall---it's too hard to walk away from!........I really like using oyster crackers. I use 2 packs to one recipe- very good snack for  Saturday football and birthday parties.

I can't make enough!  This is a great snack for any gathering.  It's always a hit and so easy to make.  I use small saltines and let them sit overnight to make sure the mixture is absorbed.  Everyone always asks for the recipe and can't believe it's so simple.

Every holiday and family gathering these are requested by my family!  If they only knew how easy they are!  After many, many batches, my favorite cracker combination is one bag oyster crackers and one box Nabisco Premium Mini Saltines(11oz).  This is more crackers than the recipe calls for, but a splash more oil and seasoning when preparing works out perfectly!  I agree with other reviews, a bit heavy on the red pepper flakes gives it a great kick!  Enjoy!!

These are so good that I finally needed to give some away in order not to eat the whole batch myself!  It didn't stop me from making it again  a month later though.  Yumm-O.  I used the oyster crackers.

Holy Moly!  This is some good stuff.  I added some Cajun spice to it along with the red pepper flakes and it is good heavens good.  Thanks for the recipe.  Taking it a party tomorrow night and I'm sure it will knock their socks off  Thanks again.

I've been making these for a long time for holidays or company.  Now I keep some on hand all the time - excellent, and I think less expensive that most specialty crackers.  I never have a large jar, but large bowl works just fine.

I used a little too much oil. I thought 1 cup was not enough, I was wrong. I recommend sticking to the canola oil as my olive oil was a bit overpowering. Good snack though!

Wow these are good! I made one change and that was using oyster crackers instead of the traditional saltine. Great for munching. I like the idea of calling them "Firecrackers". I'll definitely be making these for 4th of July this year.

This recipe to snazz up a plain cracker is wonderful. I made them for an Holiday Office Food day and they were very popular. This is such a great recipe and there are so many variations to choose.

I was assigned snack items for our thanksgiving gathering and like to try different recipes so i decided to give this a shot.  i thought these were delish as did others.  i would have given it 5 stars if they weren't so oily but that may simply have been the fact that the oz size of the crackers that i used was off by 6 oz.  i used mini saltines and would use them again but maybe lessen the oil amount.  i would prefer more pepper flakes.  I would also suggest preparing it the day before to let them sit n soak up the flavor.

Very tastey and a different idea for bringing a cheese and crackers spread to a party. I would like to find smaller crackers to use - I can never find the mini saltines and my husband doesn't like oyster crackers - and even they are a bit to small.  Regular saltines are just a little big and awkward. Has anyone tried this with Ritz? or is that too buttery?

These are Excellent!  Everybody LOVES them!  So easy too.  My 11-year old daugher and I made these today, except we used 1 1/2 cups canola oil and 2 Tablespoons of red chili flakes, would even add more flakes next time, and next time I'll also split into 2 gallon size ziploc bags, so that the hotness gets everywhere, because the internal crackers don't get as much of the seasonings.

I had these at a work function several years ago and just stumbled upon the recipe. They were as good as I remembered. I just figured out that as one rater had mentioned doing, I added two tablespoons of crushed red pepper instead of teaspoons. As I like things spicy, this was not a problem. So easy and so good; thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!  The only change I made was to reduce the oil to 3/4 cup to cut some calories.  Even with less oil, they are still good!

I, too, made these with oyster crackers.  They were SO GOOD!  I made them on Wednesday evening, and when I came home from work on Thursday afternoon -- they were gone!  Our 15-year-old son had devoured them while home for a snow day.  They are truly addictive!

yum, yum, yum!!!  I eye-balled the ingredients, as I didn't have a full amount of crackers.  I will have to eat only a few at a time....if I can!!  Not something to make all the time, but I can see where this would be a nice treat.
