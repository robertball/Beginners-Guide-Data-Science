I've been making chopped liver for decades and my recipe is similar to this and everyone loves it.  My grandmother was a good friend of Jennie Grossinger and I spent many happy weekends there in my young, single days.

Since I do not keep kosher, I tend to substitute no trans fat margarine for the chicken fat.  I also use about a dozen hard-boiled eggs to one pound of chicken livers to make it taste less like liver, plus it makes a much larger quantity.  For those, like me, who dislike liver of any kind, you may find you enjoy this version.

I made this recipe, including rendering the fat and it was sensational! The only thing I added was a bit of sherry to it and my company loved it even more!
