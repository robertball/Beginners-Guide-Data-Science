Being that a lot of reviews stated that the skins didn't turn out crispy, I decided to spray them with evoo instead and then added several seasonings. With this change they were very crispy and really good. Fantastic  source of potassium and they make a great and healthy snack. Thanks Kelly!

Thanks so much for the idea!  I didn't use salad dressing, but instead olive oil with garlic salt & chardonnay smoked sea salt.  These tasted a lot like Ms Vicky's kettle chips only less hard... great way to use up something I always hated throwing out!

Surprisingly, they were bland...even with loads of Zesty Italian poured over top..and dipped in ranch dressing with green onions afterwards. Nor were they very crispy. My end verdict? Not so yummy after all, I don't recommend them.

I actually completely changed this recipe. I think the idea was great but changed due to personal preference. I lightly coated with E.V. olive oil and seasoned with the following; Ground Cumin, Cayenne Pepper, Seasoned Salt and dried Thyme. Turned out very well.

Update: Tried these again and used zesty Italian and sprinkled sea salt over them and they were actually pretty tasty! Served with ranch dressing. Thanks for the frugal recipe! Original review: No one in my family would eat these. I tried some and they were "ok". Not alot of flavor. Thanks for the "creative" idea, though. Just didn't work for us. ):

This is much blander than thought it would be with the Italian dressing. The recipes for baked skins crisp, then topped with cheese and bacon bits are a lot tastier. And don't forget the sour cream...can't be on a diet with this one tho.

After reading the other reviews I tried to enhance this recipe with zesty italian dressing and some parmesan cheese.  I also sprayed the baking sheets with Pam to prevent sticking.  Unfortunately, these potato skins still weren't that great.  However, we felt very frugal eating them!

This is really good recipe. I also substituted for Sweet Potato skins, olive oil, and sprinkled with salt.

I gave this recipe four stars simply for the creative idea.  Instead of tossing them in salad dressing I used extra virgin olive oil and a pre-made spice mixture used for bread dipping.  If you don't use oil, they won't come crispy.

I used olive oil, rubbed both sides of skins b/w my oiled hands, placed on salted baking sheet, skin side up.
I then dusted the skins with Paprika & Ground Red Pepper.
Popped into the 375 degree oven for 20 minutes.
They turned out similar to potato chips, ranging in texture from crisp to chewy depending on how much potato was left on the skin.
My teenager thinks that potato skins from now on should be made this way and not wasted by going into the compost bin. :)

Yum! Other reviews said it didn't come out crispy, but mine was real crispy. Could be that my potato peels were thinner, because I had to take them out 6 minutes earlier. I also didn't use a bowl for oiling. I just added a few glugs of olive oil based salad dressing when the peels were already on the baking tray and mixed it there.  Also added some sweet pepper powder. 
And ofcourse, a dip! I used a dip recipe from a potato rosti recipe - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/241585/herbed-potato-rosti/ The two just go SUPER together  =D

Try using spray oil ( Pam etc on pan) and spray the potato peels. Use a garlic bread seasoning mix. ( sprinkle liberally).  A tasty use of the peels.

After reading many reviews i would recommend not using the sauce and just sticking to oil and salt with some pepper or seasonings of your choice. The zesty italian sauce was so strong and the flavor was odd.
