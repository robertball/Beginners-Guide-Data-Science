awesome- reliable & delicious. my family finally approves of the bread i made, lol (i.e., not wheat or sourdough or rye- actual white bread.) as fine a white loaf as i've ever tasted, & foolproof (this is the 3rd time i've made it). my husband is very glad he got me a kitchenaid mixer for christmas last year! he is on a low carb diet, & even he eats this bread. i usually just throw it all in the mixer (except for the last cup of flour, which i add gradually if needed); i use a good white bread flour, & knead for about 10 minutes. also, i usually make something else with the extra dough (as it is a two-loaf recipe); it makes fine cinnamon rolls, & this time, hot dog buns. the best review i've ever written here- the best recipe.

This bread bakes wonderfully. I substituted all-purpose flour for some of the bread flour, and I didn't use all of the flour called for (2 1/2 cups bread flour, about 3 cups all purpose). If you put butter on the bread before plopping it in the oven the crust turns out great. Keep the bread warm when it rises and it will bake nicely!

O M G! I'm not really a fan of 'white' bread but made this thinking to use it for homemade Panko bread crumbs. Well, I ended up eating the bread! Yum YUM! I did 1/2 the recipe and used lard vs shortening. Man, I'm making the whole recipe next time...it's that good! I did decrease the sugar a bit and glad I did, it was plenty sweet. I could barely contain the dough it was rising so fast but that's okay. I like the 3 rise method but I think when I go with full recipe I'll use only 1 package of yeast. I'm sure that will be plenty. Anyway...was soooooo good with fresh egg salad or sliced while still warm w/some butter. I may attempt to replace 1 C of white with wheat flour but no more than that. I don't want it to become heavy. Thanks for this recipe...I LOVE IT! Oh, I did add a T of fresh chopped rosemary and I feel you could turn this into any herb flavored bread of your liking. I'm sure this would make awesome dinner rolls or dough for cinnamon rolls.

Thank you SO much!! I love baking but bread has always been my nemesis, I could create Italian and Spanish inspired wonders but the secret to regular bread had eluded me for nearly a year.  This recipe has changed everything!  It turned out amazing, it has a nice flaky crust with a beautiful savoury, buttery flavour.  I halved the recipe, used butter instead of shortening, and for fear of lack of flavour added 1/2 tsp of salt.  This baker is very happy, thanks for giving me confidence with bread again!

Absolutely the best bread recipe I have ever tried.  I did use butter instead of shortening.  I did make rolls instead of a loaf...they melted in my mouth.  I will throw away all my old bread recipes.

Since the weather is starting to cool off, I got a wild idea that it was time to try my hand at baking bread. All I can say is WOW! I am apparently a fabulous baker...or more accurately this recipe is not only easy to follow but fantastic as well. The steps are clear and easy to follow. The only changes I made were using butter instead of shortening (I don't keep it in my house) and using only 1/4 cup of sugar. I decided to share 1/2 a loaf with my parents to get an honest opinion (yes, my mother will tell it like it is and not sugar-coat it) and I got a call this morning asking if I was taking orders because she wanted two more loaves because she couldn't stop eating it. Don't be scared by the number of steps and the length of each because it really is very easy, just takes a while to complete but WELL worth the effort!

Finally a recipe like my Dad used to make when I was a kid.  Real milk, real egg, yeast!  Healthy bread!.  It was so yummy, thank you.  It tasted and smelled like real bread, it was great.

I rarely rate recipes, because I am often dissapointed in even highly rated recipes, but if I could give this more stars, I would!  This is absolutely the best white bread I have ever made or eaten.  My husband loved it as well, and he is strictly a store-bought white bread boy.  ONLY change I made was to substitute butter for the shortening, and added another teaspoon of sugar.  The bread baked up beautifully, had a wonderful fine texture, was very soft and, most importantly, was delicious. I will make this regularly from now on.  Thanks so much for this great recipe; I've tossed all my other white bread recipes!

This is a wonderful recipe but I only needed one loaf of bread so I reduced the original recipe to half so 10 for US measurement rather than 20 as the recipe suggests. I used butter instead of shortening and for the flour, I only used about 2 1/2 cups. Great!

Very good white bread. Very soft. Really easy to work with. I did use butter instead of shortening since that is what I had on hand, also used AP flour. My family loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! I used my kitchen aid. Used 6 1/2 cups of flour, hand kneading in the last 1/2 c. in. My loaves got a little too brown but that was my fault for baking about 40 min and not checking them.

I have made this power the recipe and it's fabulous.  Today i added 3 T ground golden flax seed and 1/2 cup teff flour for a little nutrition, and it's fabulous.  I always use AP flour because that's what I have.   Note for high altitude basers:  baking at over a mile high, you don't knead add long as recipes say.  It toughens the bread.  Just knead until it is elastic and smooth, however long that takes.  A few minutes.

Approximately 40 years ago I use to make  a white bread recipe that was absolutely delicious.  I lost the recipe and have by comparison been disappointed in every white bread recipe I tried.....until now.  This is it!!  Thank you so much RobBob for putting this old recipe out there.  It is a winner!!  I used King Arthur AP flour, lard instead of shortening, and SAF red instant yeast which doesn't need to be proofed, so I added 1/2 cup water to the milk.  Put everything in my bread machine on dough cycle.  Took it out after the first rise, plopped it into a bowl for the second rise, and into my bread pans for last rise.   Perfect and delicious.

I just halved this recipe and made it for rolls for lunch. Very good. Like a previous poster, I used a stand mixer and had to hold back some of the flour to keep it from climbing the dough hooks. (I kneaded this back into it after the first rising.) The crust was a little less crusty than I wanted, but next time I will spray with a bit of water.

I made this bread today in my KitchenAid Artisan stand mixer and it turned out great! I used about 5 1/2 cups of flower in the end. I started by letting the yeast activate directly in the mixing bowl before adding the other ingredients + 2 cups of flower. Once it started to combine, I added more flower 1/2 cup at a time till it came together nicely. Kneaded on speed setting 2 until combined, then another 2 minutes but it started climbing the bread dough. I scraped it down and kneaded it several times, for probably 3-4 minutes kneading total. Next time, per suggestions on other sites, I may try oiling the dough hook first to prevent climbing.

I love this recipe! It does seem to take awhile with all the rising but it's definitely worth it! I cut this recipe in half to make only one loaf, comes out perfect and the taste of this bread is awesome! I'm making another loaf right now, I'm in between one of the risings:)

Honing my break making skills and trying lots of different recipes. This, by far, resulted in my greatest loaves. Thank you for posting!

I was looking for an easy, basic bread recipe to make hot dogs wrapped in bread.   This one fit the bill perfectly.  The bread was very easy to make, it turned out perfectly (even though I used margarine instead of shortening).

Excellent recipe; thank you!  My bread had a lot of lift; made huge loafs.  Not too sweet.  I only used about 6 cups of flour.  I did make one change and substituted butter for the shortening.  I also used a stand mixer.
