I made this recipie in 3/4 proportion.  I used all whole wheat flour (instead of some white, some wheat) and 2 tsp baking powder and 2 tsp baking soda (a little extra to compensate for the whole wheat flour).

It turned out fabulous!

I was happy to find a whole wheat recipe on this site until I saw the ingredients.  Sorry, but to me, it isn't whole wheat unless it's 100%.  I used 4 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (which doesn't even come close to regular whole wheat flour in texture, it is much smoother and softer) and 1 cup soymilk in addition, because anything whole wheat needs more moisture.  I omitted all white flour.  Because whole wheat flour is more dense than white, it is preferable to use less when substituting completely.  I used only 3 eggs, and might even use 2 next time.  6 are really unnecessary.  I also used raw sugar instead of brown in the same amount, only adding 1 tablespoon molasses to mimic the brown sugar flavour and moisture.  Raw sugar is much healthier for you.  I made 21 muffins out of these.  Nice, big plump ones.  They are succulent.  The kind you would pay for.  Just make sure you use pastry flour, because regular flour will make them rock hard if you want them 100% whole wheat.

I would say that with just a few tweaks, this bread is AWESOME! I did find that the bread was too dense so I cut the all-purpose flour down to three cups instead of 4. I thought the sweetness of the bread was right on and in fact, cut the brown sugar down to only 1/2 cup. To save on calories, I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil and then just added 2 tablespoons of oil. I love spice so I also snuck in some nutmeg. Since it makes three loaves, it's been fun giving it away to friends and family and so far, people have loved it and have been asking me for the recipe!

I made this recipe along with a 'regular' zucchini bread, because I was worried that my kids wouldn't like the 'healthier' version.  But this whole wheat bread won hands down! Everyone loved it!  It was much sweeter than what I was expecting, which was good for us, but might not be for some.  But I usually add raisins to my zucchini breads instead of nuts, which could've added to the sweetness. So, if you want something tasty and healthy, this is the recipe to try!

I was looking for something a little more healthy for breakfast. These definitely hit the spot. Very tasty, I halfed the recipe and made muffins instead of bread and they came out great! You could also add a tablespoon of orange zest if you wanted a little zip to them. Don't leave out the walnuts though, I think they are an important component.

Very yummy! I used all 6 cups whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, added some nutmeg and 2 cups zucchini. Because whole wheat flour is denser, I added milk until the desired consistency. So delicious!

Just for you people (like myself) who don't always read through the whole recipe before you start baking away - this requires a pot that can hold a minimum of 12 cups (between the flour, honey, sugar, eggs and zucchini). I ended up with a bunch of bowls that wouldn't fit the entire thing to the end.  Since you are baking 3 loaves at once it gets hard to stir in the end so I used yet another bowl and threw it in my Kitchenaid.  Maybe I am a weakling but then again that's what I bought that. So, can't say it never gets used :)  
The bread was done probably around 40-45 minutes, but I didn't take it out til the timer said at 50 - so note for next time.  
Also - even though there is honey and brown sugar this isn't a sweet bread.  It's good just not sweet. So if you want some more sweetness in it I would replace it with regular sugar.

I liked this recipe very much, but I did make a few small changes.  Following the advice of some other reviewers, I used sugar instead of the honey, as I like the extra sweetness.  I also used sunflower seeds in place of the walnuts, becuase I had them on hand.  I also subbed coconut oil for the oil called for, it adds a rich flavor to baked goods.  Otherwise, the recipe was great, I will definitely make it again!

I don't know what recipe all tghe revuiers used to give it 4 or 5 stars but it wasn't this one. The only two that hit it were Vurtualelse and Susan.B Very bland and no where near enough liquid. I used  a good dark wild honey ( very sweet) and the dark brown sugar no where near enough sweetener. Thank God I have Plenty of sweet Jam & Jellys  :)

My husband and I loved this recipe.  My breads usually sink down, but this kept its shape nicely.  I just gave my copy to my mother-in-law to try, so I'll need to print out a new one.  I made half the recipe, in my Pampered chef stone bread pan. It took a little over an hour.  Delicious and even pretty healthy! Mary

I don't quite know how to rate this. I agree w/ many reviewers who said that a recipe titled Whole Wheat--should be all whole wheat. That said, I followed the changes listed by Kate and this is FABULOUS!! 
4.5 c. whole wheat pastry flour
1c milk
3 eggs
raw sugar + 1 tbs molasses.
Oh, and I added 1 tsp nutmeg.
Thanks to the orginal poster and to Kate.

I made some changes, to make it healthier: First, I cut the recipe down to 2/3.   3 eggs instead of 4  1/2 cup of  unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil 3 cups of whole wheat flour 1 cup of all-purpose flour 1 1/2 tsp baking powder (because I changed the whole wheat flour ratio) 1 1/2 tsp baking soda (same reason as above)  I didn't have brown sugar or molasses. So I used white sugar and about 1/3 cup of milk.  I made this recipe last night, and it gave me 3 loaves, which I cut into about 9 pieces each. In less than 24 hours, I only have 1 loaf left. My family LOVED this. Everyone first cringed at the thought of zucchini "tasting good", but they wouldn't stop eating it! Lightly toast, butter it lightly, and serve!  I'm making this again in a couple days, for sure!

Yummy! Excellent recipe. Changed the flour mixture to half white and half whole wheat and added one cup on plain yogurt.  It was awesome!

I made it according to the recipe, and my batter was much too dry (even though the zucchini was moist).  So I added 1 cup of soy milk, which worked. I put a handful of raisins in and made the 3rd loaf as muffins. Overall good recipe--just needed more liquid. I like this lower fat version.

We love this recipe. The honey and brown sugar are such a nice addition. The first time, I followed the recipe, but did some in muffin tins for about 10 min. Delicious! The second time, I did try half white and half wheat flour and it came out a little dry. Next time, I'll add a little more oil, zucchini, or some apple sauce to compensate.

Soo Good!  I followed "kate"'s changes.  Unbelieveably lite with the whole wheat pastry flour.  Sooo good!  I even used a little less honey about 3/4 cup it was plenty sweet!  THANK YOU!!

Loved that this used up a lot of my giant zucchini. I did halve the brown sugar, and it was just the right sweetness for us. Also did half wheat, half white flour, with a little milk.

Mine came out a litte dry at 55 minutes.  Also, for me the cinnamon was really overpowering.  But a good thick bread for dipping in tomato soup.

This was my first ever attempt at zucchini bread. It turned out amazing. I did swap out the brown sugar for raw sugar. I did not give it 5 stars since I had to add some milk to the recipe since there was not enough moisture.  Also, I used 4 cups whole wheat and 2 cups white flour. Next time I'll buy the pastry flour. I shredded the zucchini rather chunky for some texture since I do not like to add walnuts to my breads. My 10 year-old, who despises zucchini, asked for 3rd and 4th helpings!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I had some left over zucchini from another recipe so I made this. I had to cut it in half because I had 2 cups of zucchini. So it made one good sized loaf and 6 muffins. I liked the muffins so well that next time I will do all muffins.

an even healthier version--
I just made this recipe for the second time and made some serious changes based on what others said. I halved it and used 2 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour, used equal amount raw sugar in place of brown sugar, added some nutmeg, ginger powder, allspice, and almond extract on top of the vanilla, and since I didn't have honey added about 2 tablespoons of molasses and a splash of agave syrup for moisture. I also found that creating a zucchini puree is far easier than grating a full 2 cups-- just chop it into smaller pieces and throw it in the blender with about a 1/4 cup of soymilk. It makes the process a lot quicker and keeps the bread moist. added chopped pecans and oatmeal as well... it came out phenomenal. Even my junkfood junky dad and friends couldn't get enough of it.

I had very good luck with this bread, although I did modify the recipe a bit. I used all whole wheat flour (no white flour). Based on the recommendation of another reviewer, since I was using whole wheat flour, I added 1-cup of skim milk (otherwise the recipe was so dry-I couldn't even mix the ingredients). I also doubled the honey instead of using brown sugar and added more zucchini than asked for. Based on another reviewer, I added slightly more baking powder and baking soda (1/2 tsp more each) since I was using all whole wheat flour. It baked in 55 minutes and came out wonderful.

I used half whole wheat instead of a third and it turned out really well!  Might had coconut or pineapple next time too.  The honey and brown sugar combo was a nice change.

Like other reviewers, I made a few modifications to up the health content even further:  1.  used applesauce instead of oil, 2. used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  Because all of the flour was some form of whole wheat, I added about a teaspoon of vital wheat gluten and everything rose wonderfully.  I also found it necessary to add milk because the mixture was too dry otherwise - added about 3/4 cup almond milk.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and cloves.  YUM!  Made it in loaf size, 9" round cake pan, two mini-muffin trays, and one 6-count regular muffin tray.

This was the 1st recipe I saw.  Looked so good, so I tried it.  Incredible.  I live at 5,000' elevation, so no alterations necessary for high elevation. I liked the alternatives to using wheat & honey.  I can see adding in grated apples or blueberries to this mix.  My husband doesn't care for alternative foods... he's ate half the mini loaf in less than 2 minutes... I'd say this is a WINNER!

I used 1/3 of the recipe and it made 12 just-right muffins. They only took about 20-25 minutes. I was out of AP flour, so I used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. They were fantastic! I ate them for breakfast all week long.

We enjoyed this bread.  Its not too sweet and has a nice heartiness from the wheat flour.  I used 50/50 wheat and all purpose flour and added a little extra zucchini.  I like having extra bread to share with friends/neighbors.

I'm not a regular baker but I found this recipe very easy to make and the results were very good.  I cut two thin slices and butter one side of each slice then pack it away for my two breaks times at work.

Hands down, this is one of my favorite zucchini bread recipes that I have come across.  I made a few slight changes to suit my taste: 2 cups ww flour and 1 cup ap flour, 1.5 tsp baking soda and powder to make up for the additional ww flour and .5 cup chocolate chips.  It turned out moist and just sweet enough.  This has become a family favorite of ours!!

I'm hooked on this Zucchini bread!   My family requested that I make some, and after trying a grossly sweet recipe with poor flavor, I was determined to find something that would yield what everybody was craving. We stumbled upon this, and it sounded delicious. It tastes as delicious as it sounds. I followed the recipe to a tee. The batter looked very thick and like it would end up being a dry bread, but the end result was surprisingly moist, perfectly sweet, and 100% eatable. My new staple zucchini bread recipe for sure!!!

I had to add about 1/2 cup of milk in order to be able to stir the batter. Turned out pretty good though, think next time I'll add raisins :)

Just hot out of the oven! Used all Whole Wheat (Common Spring) flour. Substituted as suggested the applesauce for oil. I packed the zucchini into the measuring cup like brown sugar would be packed.Zucchini is moist so I wanted to see if it would help. I use frozen grated zucchini in recipes and I don"t drain it. No extra moisture was needed fof this recipe. Tastes great! Baked it in 2 long bread pans 12x7 for 1 hour.

I just made this but halved it and did muffins instead.  The only thing I did different was add some chocolate chips so that my kids would eat them, lol.  They are DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe exactly, just adding the choc chips.  Very very good and one I will use again for sure!

Tastes great!  I replaced most of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  I also reversed the amounts of flour (more whole wheat, less all-purpose) and added a bit more baking soda and baking powder, as recommended by a previous poster.

Delicious, moist muffins and loaves. I used 6c. of 100% whole wheat flour without altering anything else, and it turned out perfectly. Baked for 55 minutes for loaves, 25 for large muffins. Thanks!

I give this 3 stars only because I changed the recipe a little bit. I agree with another reviewer that you shouldn't call "whole wheat" what's not truly whole wheat (especially when you are using more white flour than whole wheat four!) I used all whole wheat flour (freshly milled) and used sucanat instead of brown sugar since it's healthier than both brown sugar and white sugar. Everything else I did exactly the same and they turned out great! I made both muffins and loaves and the consistency was nice for both of them. I will use this recipe again, but only with my changes.

I followed the recipe, I did add more zucchini. These were a bit dry. Even with just the one cup of whole wheat flour, I think some applesauce would help these, along with the oil. Whole wheat pastry flour would be beneficial, as well.   I cut recipe in half and then baked into muffins.

This was just what I wanted to show Irish friends the great American tradition of zucchini bread (AKA courgette bread). I also made a few minor alterations: I used all 6 cups "strong" whole wheat bread flour; I used 1 cup of Splenda instead of honey; 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce (made with tart Bramley apples) - instead of most of the oil (Splenda can make things drier); 3 Tbsp. of oil; 1/2 cup of milk; 1 to 1.5 tsps. of nutmeg; 2.5 to 3 tsps. baking powder; 2.5 tsps. baking soda; 1/2 cup flaxseeds; 1.5 tsps. vanilla. Everything else was as in the recipe. Made two loaves and 11 muffins. Moist & sweet.

This recipe makes a beautiful loaf and if fiber is what you are looking for well this is for you. Most Zuccihini Bread is moist and this is far that very dry. I dont know where the sweetness of the Honey and Brown Sugar when but it isnt in this bread. So neadless to say this isnt my new Zucchini Bread Recipe

I made it twice, using shredded carrot and  then shredded apple for part of the zucchini for extra flavour and sweetness.

I am the original recipe-maker and this is still my go-to favorite for zucchini bread. A couple of notes: I do use the large zucchini from the garden that are green and healthy. I peel them and seed them and then shred them in the food processor.  The batter is not very moist until you add the shredded zucchini. I don't worry about adding too much zucchini. Usually I have a food processor full and add it all. It makes the bread very moist and my family and friends all LOVE this quick bread. You can also use up your extra zucchini and bake up a batch of loaves to freeze. I freeze them in gallon freezer bags and take out a loaf whenever we need one.

This recipe would be wonderful with Kamut wheat being it is a sweeter and a milder wheat that's usually what I use when I am making a sweet bread.
