This is the first Chef John recipe that was just OK for us.  This was very acidic.   I used really good balsamic but it was a very strong - overwhelming flavor. Sorry but this wasn't quite to our tastes.

Simple and really tasty! However I have to ask why no salted butter? I get it for this recipe, but it can be pretty darn tasty on toast or a Ritz cracker... Just defending my love for the seasoning of life salt.

I grabbed this last minute and was delighted at the results.  I added a touch more butter and skipped the unsalted butter with no issues; I made up for it by not adding salt later.  I did not have chilies to mince so I added some chili flakes while the balsamic was reducing.  Everyone asked me for the recipe.  Will do this one again. I love balsamic reductions and have done many such as fig, port, brandy, wine, etc.  This one is perfect as a pinch hitter when wanting something elegant without flour.
