This is the recipe I have been looking for for years. This is the one my Mother used to make, but she never used a recipe. This is also very good on cottage cheese as is freshly cooked whole cranberry sauce.
Thank You

Fresh and tasty. I added a lot more honey than the recipe calls for, I have a sweet tooth :) Also left out the walnuts due to an allergy. Get out as much of the white stuff on the oranges as you can, to avoid a bitter taste.

This is such a refreshing salad! I've made this several times now. I have added a couple of ingredients - about a cup of chopped celery and about a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger.  I've put walnuts in it a couple of times and have also done it without them.  I finely chop the apples, oranges and celery by hand and use the food processor for only the cranberries.  I love the crunch!

Delicious. I used pecans. I will definitely make this again. I did not have fresh oranges. I substituted mandarin oranges packed in juice.

I liked it better than the rest of the family, but I cut the sweetness in half, so they might like it better with more honey.
