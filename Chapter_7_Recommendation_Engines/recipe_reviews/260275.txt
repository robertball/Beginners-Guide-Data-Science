Made as written except that I used less oil and less sage. Sage in general is overbearing to me so I subbed parsley for half of it. I really like the punch the lemon gave the soup but I still feel it needed more. I ended up adding Italian seasoning blend to the leftovers and that added a great deal of flavor. I added egg noodles as the recipe submitter suggested but rice would go well in this too. Overall good recipe and true to its title.
