This is a very rich cake, and the person before me was right. It is VERY dry. I added less than 1/4 cup veggie oil and baked at a temp of 350 degrees for 10- 15 minutes longer. It came out very fluffy. I didn't find it too sweet. In fact, most Red Velvet Cake recipes call for 1 and 1/2 cup sugar. I also added another tablespoon of cocoa powder and mixed my ingredients differently so that I could stir less.

It was vary dry and crumbly. I used it for cupcakes and they didn't even come out as on peice. To top it off it was a little too sweet. Will be looking for another recipe.

I added a little bit of oil to make it a little more moist but it was wonderful!

Absolutely the best Red Velvet Cake I have ever put in my mouth. The others must have done something wrong cause the one I made was moist and perfect!!

Cake was very dry, and it needed much more food coloring to achieve a vibrant red color. Will not be using this recipe again.
