Fast, easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe and added a few dashes of hot sauce.  I used left over smoked turkey and the result was outstanding flavor!  The family loved this soup!  I will make this soup again.

This was a quick, easy and good tasting soup.  With cubed, frozen turkey breast from Thanksgiving,  I doubled the recipe. I added a chopped onion to the first process. Using 1 cup regular rice, even threw in 1/2 cup barley; may have been a bit much because I needed to add more broth.  The soup was thick.  I would make this again.

I like this simple, no veggies other than the diced tomatoes.  
Used one Turkey, one chicken Swanson boxed broth for my base with 4 chicken bouillon cubes low sodium, brought to a boiled with the tomatoes and a store rotisserie turkey for 30 minutes then removed Turkey to separate into pieces added 1 bag of boil in the bag rice at the end for ten minutes and made for a perfect bowl of Turkey rice soup.

I made this today with leftover thanksgiving turkey. I only used one can of diced tomatoes and that was thick enough. My diced tomatoes had onions, celery and green peppers in it too. Perfect for added veggies. Great soup!
