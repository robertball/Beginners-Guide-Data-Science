This is a fantastic appetizer for the sashimi tuna lover. I served in clear martini glasses to showcase the beautiful colors and garnished with avocado slices and asian rice crackers.

It was delicious but we had to double if not triple the amount of soy sauce. Being from Louisiana we are a little numb to spice but we couldn't taste the jalape√±o at all. we probably would have doubled that as well if we had another. After all, it was still very good.

My husband caught a couple of bluefins so I decided to try this recipe... absolutely delicious!  I added chopped tomatoes and chopped cilantro before serving, which gave it a different twist in flavor.  I'll send the hubby back out to fish for more bluefin!

I don't know what happened. I love ceviche and don't mind the raw tuna, but this didn't turn out great for me. Maybe marinating it overnight was too long. The texture of everything didn't turn out great. I liked my friend's ceviche better that used fresh cooked shrimp.

Fear not! The lemon (or use lime)literally cooks the fish so it's not raw. If you haven't tried ceviche, now is the time. Scallops are another great option.

I added fresh diced avocado, some fresh lime juice & cilantro just before serving. This was a hit, even in Minnesota with a "non-sushi" crowd.

I've made this dish several times and wanted to give the ones that tried it and didn't like it a few pointers. Use Thai chili pepper or a hot Asian/South Pacific pepper instead of jalapeno. You can find them in Asian markets. Also, I would never marinate the tuna over the 2-3 hour time frame before eating. You don't want the tune to lose its texture completely. This is a very popular dish in South Pacific island countries like Micronesia. Enjoy!

I tried it but I didn't have ginger or jalapeno.  I used tomato and cayenne pepper and it turned out great.  I also added a pinch of sugar as my mother always told me to add to all my savory dishes. Reminds me of poke not ceviche but who cares when its good.
