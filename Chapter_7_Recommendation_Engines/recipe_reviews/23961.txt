Yummmy!  I mixed in a few drops of hot sauce; then spread a very thin layer of the cream cheese onto a small platter.  Because I was having a small dinner party with other appetizers the plate I used was about the size of a salad plate.  Smooth the cream cheese all the way to the 'lip' of the plate (reduced the ingredients).  Spread an even layer of cocktail sauce over the cream cheese; I think this sauce can be overpowering so keep it thin.  Drain frozen baby shrimp well to spread over the top of the cocktail sauce; next, green onions, chpd tomatoes, & finely shredded mozzeralla cheese as suggested by another reviewer.  I also left off the black olives.  This makes a pretty dish and I like the thin layers to scoop up with the thin triangular shaped Triscuit crackers. I served with Cheese Easy Squares, honey roasted peanuts; as well as blue chips with a artichoke salsa.  A hit with my guests!

I have been making this  dip for a long time.  There are always several people who go crazy for it and insist I make it again for them.  I use half cream cheese and half mayonnaise as the base and add a layer of shredded mozarella cheese.  It goes great with Ritz crackers.

I made this last night with rave reviews. I didn't use any green onions and used regular sized shrimp. I layered the cream cheese, cocktail sauce, imitation crab meat that I'd chopped, and then added the shrimp and olives. I sprinkled true lemon packets over the top of it and that added a fabulous taste! I will make this again. :)

This was quick and easy and all of my guests loved it!  I added shredded mozzerella cheese on top and finely chopped red and yellow bell peppers for some extra colour

I've made this before but added a layer of finely chopped tomato, green onion and finely shredded mozerella cheese on the top layer...I left the olives off altogether.  The canned baby shrimp (rinsed) worked great!

This was super easy and really tasty! I used a frozen (thawed) shrimp ring instead of canned baby shrimp and it was delicious! Almost can't stop eating it. Everyone loved it.

I omitted the olives because, although they would have looked pretty, I don't care for them.  I mixed 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1 Tbsp white horseradish, & a drained & rinsed can of crab meat into WHIPPED cream cheese.  This soft cream cheese made it easier to mix & also scoop up when serving.  I cut one pound of shrimp (washed, drained,& dried) into about 1 inch pieces.  I brought the dip, which I'd layered in a glass pie plate & covered with plastic wrap, in a plastic cake carrier to a party last night & it was a huge hit!

Guest loved it! I too used mayo but too tart for my taste.  Still good though! Mayo lovers devoured the dish. I also used parm. cheese as someone did. Used half the jar of sauce. I poured lightly and spreaded lightly. Good idea! I'm making it again and may still add some mayo for a creamier consistency. Used raw shrimp, cooked, cooled, and sliced in half.  Paired this up with assortment of crackers (wheat and buttery) and bought some tortilla chips. Dip tastes better with crackers. (just to save others on the tortilla chips idea) ENJOY!

This is a regular at family holiday get togethers. We usually have it with diced tomatoes, bell peppers, scallions, cheese, and black olives on the top.
