I tried these because they sounded different and unusual. They are really good and definitely one of those "I-Can't-Believe-It" recipes! They are very easy but a little time consuming. I would make them on a day when you have a little time. Since they're kept in the freezer you will have them on hand anytime - especially on those days when you have very little time.

too time consuming, too many calories, and although they have a lot of crunch they do not have much flavor.

for those who are crazy about peanut butter (like me!) and who want something healthy for a snack these are perfect. You can use different kinds of cereal too...several Kashi cereals tasted very good

I didn't enjoy making this - it was a pain. Too much work for nothing special...but...when I told my kids that I was never making this again they all begged me not to throw away the recipe. I will delete this from my recepie box. Sorry kids.
