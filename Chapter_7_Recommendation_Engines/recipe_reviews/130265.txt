This was really, really good served with roasted lamb.  I think it would be good with chicken too! Next time, I'll make sure I have "instant" brown rice, or use basmati, the cooking time will be much less than the 45 minutes it took to cook regular brown rice!  I may try adding a little heat with some red pepper flakes.  Overall, this was great!

It had a weird flavor that didn't seem to be as good as all the ingredients that went into it. The citrus flavor really came through, if that's what your goal is.

A little heavy on the spices, I would scale back on the turmeric and cumin next time or just add more rice to the pot. It took more like 1 hr to prepare. Also, I can't eat onions or MSG (migraines) so I used 4 cups Progresso Tuscany chicken broth, and just omitted the onion. I had ground ginger from another recipe so I didn't buy fresh; I doubt it made a difference. It's wonderful served with harira (soup) and warm batbout (pitas). Everyone complimented me on it when I brought it to Bible study!

This recipe turned out great and I will definitely make it again!!  I did, however make a few changes which I think improved the dish overall:  I added more vegetables - a whole yellow pepper, whole red pepper, both green zucchini and lots of yellow zucchini, sliced leek (I had it on hand) and more mushrooms.  I omitted the lemon - it's not a quite a fit for this dish if you ask me... Plus I added 2 cans of drained garbanzo beans - incredible - and now a complete meal!!  Instead of instant brown rice, I used some already prepared brown rice (I cook big batches and freeze it in small portions);  I used about 3 1/2-4 cups of rice total to absorb the liquid - the rice is wonderful in this dish.  I doubled the cumin and used ground ginger instead of fresh (I got lazy).  A little pepper and (quite a bit) of salt to taste. The pineapple (I used canned instead of fresh) was my husband's favorite part.

I wanted so much to like this recipe since I like everything that went into it- but unfortunately it really didn't work at all for me.  Would not make again.
