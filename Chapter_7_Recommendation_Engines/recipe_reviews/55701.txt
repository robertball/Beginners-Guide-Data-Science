Pretty good. However, I didn't make the orzo or poach the scallops. I just seared them and drizzled them with the vinagrette.

I prepared this as written and was disapponted with the blandness of the viniagrette so I doubled the honey, vinegar & thyme. Better but next time I'll use the oil to soften some finely chopped onions and celery to substitute for the the tomatoes; their flavor overpowered the delicate scallops & orzo. Overall, a good & easy low fat recipe.
