This was GREAT! Very flavorful and a welcome change of pace from "regular" rice. I made some substitutions so I wouldn't have to go to the store, (orange juice instead of apple, dried thyme instead of fresh, and white rice instead of brown) but it still turned out wonderful and my husband and I loved it.  :)

A little on the sweet side, but I like things sweet so I didn't have a problem with it.  I can see why some won't like it though.

Unusual but really good! It will go well with a number of entrees or in a salad bar.

If you like taking your time to cook stuff, this is a good thing to make.  It was very tasty and interesting.  I don't like raisins, so I will omit them next time.  Great for fall time and Thanksgiving!  I made this for my pastor's family along with the Carmel Apple Pork Chop recipe on this site.  Awesome combination.  Everyone loved it!

I used dried cherries instead of raisins and slivered almonds instead of pine nuts.  This was an interesting dish.  I've never had anything like it before, so it takes some getting used to, but it was a lovely accompaniment to a baked citrus chicken and, esp. due to the nutritive value of this recipe, I'll be making this again.

This was a little too sweet for our liking.  Perhaps the fact that I used orange juice instead of apple made a difference; perhaps it is just a personal preference.  In any case, I think the only thing that saved this for us was the pine nuts, as they added a bit of a savory flavor.  I won't be making this again, but thanks anyway...
