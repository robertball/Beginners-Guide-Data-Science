My grandmother used to make this cake every time we visited. Until I found the recipe here I did not realize it was so simple to make. Now I'll continue the tradition!

I made this cake for Easter. Left out the coconut and added pineapple. Made the frosting with 1/2 c. butter, 8 oz. cream cheese and pudding. I think I brought home two pieces. It was so good, will definately make this again and again.

I loved this recipe, added walnuts and next time I will add a coconut topping. This is not one of those super rich, overly sweet desserts that we don't care for. Followed the recipe exactly and this turned out perfect. The frosting is to die for. I will make this many times over. This is pretty easy to make. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This recipe is GREAT. I used nuts, but not coconut. These cakes actually get more moist the longer they sit and are actually better the second or third day.I just made it for the 4th time using funfetti cake and vault as the soda. It really gave it some color and was just as delicious!

I recently experimented and changed the flavors too. We made orange and butterscotch changing both the pudding and the pop.

If you're looking for a great, different, cake to make this is it! I added a half cup of chocolate chips for the kids. We will definitely add this to our list of favorites.

This is very simple and delicious.  I love anything with pistachio pudding and I think I could eat the entire bowl of the topping without even bothering with the cake.  

I did use the coconut and the nuts because the only think I like better than pistachio pudding is coconut... so this is a perfect recipe for me.  I can tell it'd be just fine without those, though.

I'm diabetic, so I couldn't eat it, but my mother asked me for the recipe. It had to have very good or she would have told me.  Most people will say its good to make me feel good, bet she always tells me if it wasn't up to her standards.  EVERYONE loved it.  Will definitely make again, and so will she.  I used Dream Whip instead of frozen topping.

I am a diabetic, so I made it sugar free. I used sugar free yellow cake mix, sugar free puddings, sugar free lemon lime soda, and sugar free whipped topping. It turned out really good. If you did not know about it being sugar free, you never would have guessed.

Delicious and moist is a nice way to describe this cake.  I think using the carbonated beverage makes this cake very moist.  Really like that this is a refrigerated as we really like "cold cake".  I opted to not use the coconut and nuts as my husband and son don't care for them.

My husband and I really enjoyed this cake recipe.  However, neither of us remembered to put the cake in the fridge after serving it at dinner and it sat on the counter over night - which, for most cakes, would have been fine.. But the whipped topping in this one went bad and we had to throw the whole thing away. :(  I plan on making it again though!

i make this as a two layer cake in round cake pans and it stays moist and is better the next day !  if no storage in he fridge for a round two layer cake you can also make it like a truffle. I do omit the coconut and nuts.

Fantastic!  My boyfriend remembered this cake from the 1970's and remembered the name.  I made it for him last night, he LOVED it!  The only changes I made is I made it into a layer cake, used diet Ginger Ale in place of the lemon-lime soda and put in a whole cup of coconut.  This recipe is a keeper!

Even my super critical "baker" sister loved it. She rarely hands out compliments and couldn't get enough of this cake. It's delicious :D

This cake was very good.  I used toasted coconut and left out the nuts due to allergies. This is a very moist cake.  I think next time I'll add some grated lime to the batter to give it a little bit more flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I was happy that this turned out pretty well. (for me that's saying something since I can't seem to cook dessert to save my life, including boxed)  I followed the recipe to a tee, adding the coconut into the mix since my family all LOVE the stuff..(num) The only ingrediant I didn't have was the veggie oil which I subbed for canola.  It left a slight after taste that wasn't entirely pleasent in the uncooked batter and I was pretty worried.  Fortunately, in the finished product, the aftertaste was barely noticable.  For the topping I added two drops of green food coloring just to give it that added springy look to it and sprinkled more coconut across the top.  For the most part, I was really pleased with the results.  The reason I'm giving it three stars, is because for some reason the cake solidified fine in the oven with the exception to one of the sides, which bubbled over the rim.  I have NO idea why it did this, it could just be my oven, however, I had too work around the mess it created and also cook the cake 10 minutes longer then the recipe called for because it was no where near done at that point.  So, the end result was that a small portion of the cake was harder along the rim while the rest of it turned out great.  But that's okay, I'm just glad it's edible at all.  :)  Anyway, it's very sweet and my husband likes this very much so thank you for the recipe.

Moist and tasty. I agree that this gets better as it sits.  Make it a day or two ahead of time, we thought the texture was perfect and the cake was more flavorful after two days.  I will double nuts and coconut next time

This just tasted like a boxed cake with pistachio pudding.  Fine enough for something sweet but nothing special.

We loved the Watergate Salad and the  Watergate Cake as well.  They've both been long-time family favorites at our house.  They are perfect for the Easter season.  Refreshing and delicious!

This is a cake my mom would always make for us on our birthday's growing up, so now I use this recipe whenever there's a special occasion. Except I substitute in hazelnuts for the walnuts. Gives a slightly different flavor. Yum.

Good.  Nothing remarkable but everyone enjoys a baked good!  I toasted extra coconut and sprinkled on top and used diet soda.  Thanks for the recipe!
