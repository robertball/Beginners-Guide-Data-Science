My husband is always asking me to make this recipe, he loves it! If you peel and chop potatoes it comes out more like mashed potatoes. To make it more like potato salad do not chop potatoes. And I never have the olives on hand so I just leave them out.

This is my absolute favorite potato salad recipe, in fact, it's the only potato salad I will actually it.  It's very simple, tasty, and most important, doesn't taste like just potatoes and mayonnaise.

Super easy recipe!! I made this with a few changes: used approx 18 small red potatoes removing the loose skin after boiling & cooling, 1C mayo and 4T spicy brown mustard (otherwise would've been too dry, in my opinion) and no olives.  My 2 year old (who typically doesn't like potatoes) actually loved this potato salad! I really like the mashed aspect compared to potato "chunks"!

we love deviled eggs, so we loved this.  However it took much more dijion/mayo then called for.  also, a few dashes of hot sauce and paprika for the deviled egg flavor!! I like this better than the usual potato salad, not everyone felt the same.

This potato salad isn't too bad-- pretty basic.  I added paprika, dill, and pickle relish to get it closer to a deviled egg taste.  Otherwise, it's just a basic potato salad.  I didn't mash everything--didn't notice that in the directions until later.  I mashed it later, and I liked how it turned out.  Be prepared to modify a bit--add more mayo and mustard and a few more seasonings, but not bad for a basic potato salad.  thanks for the recipe!
