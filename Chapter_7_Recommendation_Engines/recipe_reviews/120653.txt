This was a great recipe!  I actually used it for Easter because I had the ingredients.  It was a hit at church.  It seemed like it would be dry when I put it in the pan but it turned out to be a nice moist cake with great flavor-I loved the topping-you couldn't really tell that it was cranberry with the crumb topping which was delicious!

I needed to use up some bananas and wasn't in the mood to make banana bread so I tried this recipe. I followed the recipe ingredients and instructions exactly and my cake was terribly dry, the main reason for the low rating I give it. It is very hard to check if the cake is done or not with the topping and cranberries covering the surface of the cake, so I followed the low end of the specified cooking time and my cake was overdone. I don't know if it would have been moister if I'd cooked it less. Also, the topping wasn't anything like a crumb topping, it was basically melted brown sugar. I should have known better when melting the butter was called for. Just using softened butter and mixing into the topping ingredients would have probably gotten a crumb-like result, melted butter did not. Lastly, I'm not at all sure I like the flavor combination of banana and cranberry.

I made this with wheat flour and it was probably a little more dense than with white but it was very delicious.  I just used the whole can of cranberry sauce or we would have just thrown it away!  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Quick to make, too, and pretty on the plate. I like how it doesn't puff up really high in the pan, so you get a lot of cranberry and topping flavor in each bite. Some coffee cakes are just a bunch of semisweet dough. Yuk!

This was so easy to make....perfect for that morning when you want something sweet to eat. I didn't have whole berry cranberry sauce, so I used  jelled cranberry sauce instead. This was a big hit with my family!

For the people who found this recipe dry:  When I put the cranberry sauce on top, I swirled it into the batter.  When I made the crumble, I used cranberry sauce mixed in to a part of the crumble mixture. As soon as I took the coffee cake out of the oven, I drizzled it with melted butter and a powdered sugar frosting that I made with more cranberry sauce.  This was not a dry cake at all with those little enhancements.  As a side note, I used pumpkin spice instead of allspice.  We'll definitely make this again.

I folded the cranberry sauce (I used a whole can) in after I added the banana, and I omitted the pecans from the topping, and I added another tablespoon of flour instead.  They said it was moist and tasty.  I would make this again, as a matter of fact, I'll likely be forced to make it again.  Next time, I might double the recipe or make it in a 9x9 square, as I didn't think it was very tall.

My family loved this recipe!  I followed the suggestions that Cristie gave.   At 35 minutes baking time, the coffee cake looked done, so I tested it and it was.  Perhaps those who experienced a dry cake should bake for a shorter time.  This recipe is so good that it would be worth a try!

This cake was excellent. I don't know why so many say it was dry. Mine was moist. The only thing I would change is the topping. Because of the melted butter it clumped instead of crumbled. Next time I will use more brown sugar and no butter or very little. I would rate it 4 1/2 if I could
