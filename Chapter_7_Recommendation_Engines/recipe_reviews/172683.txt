I have to admit, I give these 5 stars because this is my recipe! My original recipe calls for cubing the cheese, not shredding it, so it's your call. Enjoy:-)
UPDATE: Ramon wanted to know how I serve these--I like ranch dressing on mine, my husband prefers Cholula hot sauce on his, and the kids put ketchup on theirs--I have also made these with cooked, crumbled bacon inside, but you can do whatever you want! I usually do use more garlic in mine, too, but most people don't like a lot of garlic, so I toned it down for this recipe.

I was trying to figure out if I liked these or not, when my husband looked at me and said "These taste a little like meatloaf, don't they" - and he was right.  I guess it was the combination of garlic, sausage, egg, and the cheese turned it from a hamburger into a meatloaf type burger.  It tasted good, just not what we were expecting ...I topped with steak sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles - maybe if we had used BBQ sauce.  Thank you so much for recipe....

we really enjoyed these burgers.. unfortunately it's way too hot to be outside grilling so we just pan fried them.. im sure grilling is the way to go with these burgers for that smokey component.. so always using what we have on hand we made the following modifications.. ground turkey for the ground beef.. provolone for the muenster.. and deveined/seeded jalapeno for the anaheim chiles.. scaled this down to two patties so we left out the egg.. we couldn't really detect the chili powder and bf ate his with tabasco sauce.. either way it was tasty.. ty for the recipe

My husband and I made them and loved them! I think if you put too much egg in there it could taste a little bit like meatloaf.  Maybe more worcestershire sauce and less egg but we loved them just as it was and didnâ€™t have a bun nor did we put anything on top. We ate it with a salad.

These burgers were to die for! I made them for a family BBQ they were such a big hit that I will make them every time we grill out.
