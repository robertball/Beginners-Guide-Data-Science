These are great cookies. The secret to keeping them ( or any cookies ) fresh is to place a slice of bread in the storage container.

I wanted to whip up a batch of cookies to give away but didn't have butter so this was the perfect answer.  I should mention that I turned oven oven before I started and by the time I had these whipped up and two cookie sheets prepared, my oven was just finishing the preheating...now that is quick.  Ease of prep and ingredients, as well as versatility make this a great recipe for busy moms....children could make these.  I didn't add the extra water..used a 'golden butter recipe' mix, added butterscotch and white choc. morsels.  The first batch just came out and it is a wonderful tasting combo.  Good to read reviews to find out they dry out quickly...the old slice of bread always does the trick.  Lightly sprayed cookie sheets and would recommend not letting these sit too long before removal or they would stick.

I used applesauce instead of oil for this recipe and it was great.  The flavor is still great, and it seriously cuts down on fat and calories.

Awesome and easy!  I'm a fairly good cook but baking has proven to be more of a challenge to me than I'd expected.  These are idiot proof!  I added an extra egg since it seemed dry and I've read that that'd be good to add an egg for fluff and/or chewieness, and I used 1 1/3 cups white chocolate chips and 1/4 cup chopped amlonds.  Awesome!  I did not make the mistake of overbaking as I usually do, and removed at exactly 10 minutes.  I will sooooooooooooooooo make these again!  Thanks!!

So Easy!  I used Lemon cake mix, added 1 tsp lemon extract and 1 c. fresh cranberries.  Bake 13 min, cool 1 min. before removing.  Wow!  Moist and firm, not crumbly or dry yet.  Made Tb. size- only 24 cookies, could eat all these by myself.  If making the tsp. size cookie there would be only 1 cranberry in each, not a bad idea for presentation.  Excellent recipe, easy to adapt to anything!

Try using cake mix, 1 egg, and an 8 oz. container of Cool Whip.  I think you will find the cookies will keep longer.

This is an excellent recipe and I got it originally from the newspaper.  I use 1/2 cup oil, 2 large eggs (must be large) and 6-8 oz. chocolate chips.  The variety is endless and you can add anything.  Always excellent and always good until the very last one which usually isn't to long.  Ships well too.

Try it with a fudge cake mix, 1/2 cup toffee chips, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/4 cup chopped nuts. It's much better as a chocolate cookie.

I made these using applesauce in place of the oil and Egg Beaters for the eggs.  I used a milk chocolate cake mix and used only 1/2 c. of Reese's Peanut Butter chips.  Baked 10 minutes.  Perfect little treats without the guilt!  Thanks for this recipe Nicole.

these are FANTASTIC!! i substituted applesauce for the oil, and used 1 egg and 1 egg white (ran out of whole eggs). Added 2Tbs water as suggested. I made these with lemon cake mix, a few squirts of lemon juice, a handful of shredded coconut and a handful of white choco chips.  These are so quick and easy- 1 bowl, 10 minutes... what more can you want?!  I dropped these by the Tbs and got about 30 cookies. Can't wait to try this with other cake varieties... YUMMY!

I love cake mix cookies. They are simple to make, which is great if you don't have alot of time to make cookies from scratch. Everyone that tastes my cake mix cookies always ask what my secret is. They come out soft (just leave them in longer if you want them hard), but they are firm cookies so they are easy to decorate with icing... Or you can leave them plain and they taste yummy too! My personal favorite cake mix cookies is the "funfetti" kind (white cake mix with rainbow sprinkes in the mix). They add a cool effect to an otherwise plain sugar cookie.  TIP: Instead of spooning the dough onto the cookie sheet, chill the dough 15 minutes and lay out some wax paper to roll out all the cookie dough... This recipe works great with cookie cutters!

I made these with a lemon cake mix (pudding in the mix type), the oil, and eggs.  I had a lemon so I also squeezed a little fresh lemon juice into the batter. I rolled in balls and flattened slightly and sprinkled with sugar before baking. After they cooled, I glazed them with a glaze of 1 cup powdered sugar and 2-3 T lemon juice. (Could probably cut the glaze in half.)  They are delicious! I am storing them in the freezer and and they are a great consistency pulled right out of the bag--slightly chewy and just enough tartness! Quick and easy variation of the recipe if you like lemon!

I have used a version of this recipe for years.  I almost always have cake mix in the cupboard, so this is a great one to use when you need homemade cookies quickly.  I have used Devil's food and Lemon cake mixes, but have never mixed anything in.  I will have to try that next time.  Roll the balls in powdered sugar before you bake for a nice effect.

I've never been a fan of yellow cake, but this recipe gives me a good reason to keep it around.  These won't pass for 'regular' cookies in my house, but they're sweet and satisfy the cookie craving quickly.  Instead of 2 cups of chips, I did 1 cup of butterscotch chips and 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  They all got eaten.  A good recipe to have on hand when I'm feeling too lazy to make real cookies.

I have been making these for as long as I can remember. I have used many variations, Devils Food with Andy's Mint baking pieces or peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips are two family favorites. I always use 2-3 Tablespoons of water depending on the mix brand. I find some need more water than others to get the consistancy right. Other family favorites include Lemon or French Vanilla with chocolate chips. The only mix I would avoid is carrot due to the fact that the carrots do not completely reconstitute.

Used the same method to make Oatmeal Raisin cookies, and they were excellent!  One package yellow cake mix, 2 cups quick-cooking oats, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup veg oil, 2 large eggs and 1/2 cup each raisins and nuts.  I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of maple extract (instead of vanilla) and walnuts.  Bake on parchment paper, they don't spread out too much and stay soft inside, slightly crisp outside.  My husband loved them, and he "only likes Tollhouse cookies."

I tried this version of cake mix cookies for my first time ever of this type of cookie. It took about 15 minutes to mix up (by hand) and ten minutes to bake. Two dozen cookies in half an hour--perfect. After reading the reviews about dryness and texture, I added an extra egg to keep them moist and give a cakier, chewier, texture. They kept three  days in a thick plastic bread bag.  So far, I twice used a yellow mix with two cups of raisins instead of chips, and once a carrot cake mix with 1 1/2 cups of sweetened, shredded coconut with natural pineapple flavoring from King Arthur. My coworkers loved them. I'm going to try chocolate fudge with raisins to see if I can get a chocolate-covered raisin flavor. (Can you tell I like raisins?)  Another tip about dry cookies/brownies. Most bakers bake them too long, until they're fully set and done. Instead, you should bake them less time because they'll continue to bake after you remove them from the oven. Trust me. I got the tip from Cook's Illustrated.

Your recipe has good flavor, but if you want them to stay moist more than 1-2 days, use 1/2 cup of margarine in place of 1/3 cup vegetable oil.   Oil seems to dry the cookie during baking
rather than keep it moist.

Not bad for a cookie that begins with a cake mix! I used a chocolate cake mix and added 1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and chocolate extract to help disguise any cake mix flavor.  To overcome the dryness some reviewers mentioned, I used 1/2 c. butter and 2 T. oil - and they were wonderfully soft and chewy.  Instead of chocolate chips I threw in a bag of chopped Andes mints.  It was a match made in heaven.  I used a small cookie scoop and did not flatten them, as these do flatten somewhat in the oven.  I had these mixed up and in the oven in just a few minutes and clean-up was a breeze.  It's nice to know I can always rely on these when I need cookies in a hurry!

Made these tonight without the chips as I didn't have any on hand but, I love these cookies! I was srtuck with an inspiratioin. I used a supermoist butter recipe chocolate cake mix. Used a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon to scoop out a well rounded spoonfull of dough. Used a flat bottomed 3inch round glass dipped in sugar and pressed the balls of dough flat, almost to edge of glass. Now the first dip, you will have to smear a little bit of margarine on bottom of glass before dipping it in the sugar. After that just press the glass firmly into the sugar, then onto the cookie dough. They come out a little firmer and very uniform. You must remove the cookies from the pan almost imediately when done. Cool on wire rack. I then used my favorite whipped buttercream frosting to make filled cookies. I used a healthy 1 and 1/2 tablespoon of frosting between two cookies. They put me in mind of those infamous whoopie pies. Yum! Thanks for the recipe Nicole!

French Vanilla with chocolate chips are our favorite.  The variety of cake mixes that can be used is endless!  I rolled the dough of chocolate cake mix balls in icing sugar and it gave it a nice crinkle effect.  (Very pretty)  Thx.

These cookies are great! After reading reviews I used extra large eggs and added a tsp of vanilla and use milk chocolate chips with the yellow cake mix. I too, had trouble with the chips falling out but I just molded them as I scooped the batter on the spoon. Otherwise they taste great!!

These are probably the best cake mix cookie I've tried. I used a strawberry cake mix and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Fantastic! I also kept them covered.

I absolutely love this recipe! These cookies are a hit with all my friends. I like to add only about 1 to 1 1/2 c chocolate chips (mini best) because 2 c is too much.  Plus I add about 2 T milk and a small package of instant vanilla pudding. It makes the cookies much softer. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe...I have a suggestion for the cookies going hard....put them in an airtight container with a slice of bread...somehow the bread gets as hard as a rock but the cookies will stay nice a fresh!

I made these cookies for a work pot-luck - and they were great!  Very fast and easy.
I used chocolate cake mix and they were very tasty.  The only thing I noticed was
the batter was hard to mix, and the chocolote chips really didn't incorporate with
the batter too well - they just fell out.  I found it easier to work the dough with 
my hands and make little balls of dough on the cookie sheet.  
There were chips left in the mixing bowl, about 10 or 15 of them - maybe I will
reduce the amount of chips next time.  But much to my surprise, the cookies came
out just right! I baked them for 10 min. and they were soft in the middle and 
nice and fluffy!  I will save this recipe and certainly make
it again - thanks for sharing.

I 1st tasted these cookies while I was on Jury Duty....they were very delicious.  I really like a soft cookie.  So far I have made these cookies with 3 different cakes flavors.  I did find that the box size was important.  One of my boxes was slightly smaller....so I added some extra flour to make the dough easier to work with.  I rolled the dough into balls and rolled them in sugar before baking.  Yummy.  Going to take some to work today to share!!

5 stars! I was completely impressed with this cookie, it is incredibly easy (I whipped them up in just a few minutes with minimal mess to clean up) and ridiculously tasty! I thought I was going to have to hide them from my boyfriend! They are very rich and you will definately want a glass of milk close by :) I will most definately be making these again :)

We make these several times a week!  Last night we mixed marshmellows and graham crackers in Devil's Food cake for Smores cookies!  Yummy! Never have a problem with them getting hard but I make them bigger and take them out while they are still gooey in the middle!  I highly recommend!

Try using a Devils Food Cake Mix, adding 1 cup of Chocolate Chips, 1/2 cup chopped Macadamia Nuts and 1/2 cup Flaked Coconut.
Nearly a week after making the cookies, the few that are left are still moist and chewy.
Awsome recipe with so many variations, Thanks for posting ...

I left out the chips, made 2 batches using spice cake mix for one and red velvet cake mix for the other since it was Christmas. Then I whipped up some cream cheese filling/frosting (2 cakes of cream cheese, 3 cups of confectioners sugar and 2 tsp of homemade rum vanilla) and piped the filling on one cookie and added another cookie on top.  I made both batches and they were ready to walk out the door with me that afternoon for a party.  The cookies were beautiful, very decadent and lasted much longer without drying out with the cream cheese to keep them moist.  Next time I use the spice cake I will add 2 tsp of ginger to get that very Christmasy flavor. Yummy!!!

These turned out super yummy and addicting!  I didn't have any vegetable oil so I substituted applesauce, which I would do again.  I also used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of white chocolate chips only because I only had half a bag left of each to use.  Worked out perfectly and very easy!

Once I got over the idea that these are not supposed to taste like chocolate chip cookies, I found that I liked them pretty well.  My husband LOVED them.  My main concern is that there's a bit of a fake taste in them.  Fortunately, tons of chocolate chips helped cover it up.  : )  I did add a little bit of water before adding the chocolate chips because it was too pasty.  I think I'd make these again.

I went by the recipe but it was too dry so i added more oil to the first batch which made them greasy. But to the second i added water and oil. But the first batch still came out good. We made chocolate mint and strawberry with white chocolate chips

This recipe is indeed endless..limited only by your imagine of combinations. These will store well if you place them in a sealed container and then lay a piece of wax paper on top of the cookies and then place a slice of soft bread such as Wonder Bread on top of the wax paper. I have even shipped many baked goods including cake mix cookies over seas to our troops and it worked well to keep them fresh and moist.

These were just okay. I wanted a quick-mix cookie to give to someone else, and they don't mind the "chemical" taste that I get whever I use cake mix.  Even a bit of vanilla couldn't take the taste away.  Oh well.  The husband likes 'em, and so will my friend.

This is a fun recipe to play with, I used poppy seeds and a lemon cake mix. I added the 2 tablespoons of water like another person suggested and got out my cake decorating kit to make the swirls to fancy them up. This was fun thanks for the easy inexpensive recipe!

I did not like this recipie with yellow cake.  It just tasted like really sweet cake.  I made them again using the 50% less sugar chocolate cake mix and they were amazing.  They were big and chewy and not too sweet.  I would recomend them, but not with the yellow mix.

These cookies were very good. My son and I used a marble cake mix and made half and half cookies (half yellow/half chocolate). I used a tsp of vanilla and 2 tbsps of water in the yellow batter as others have suggested. We put chocolate chips in both the yellow and chocolate batter. We dropped the yellow batter onto the cookie sheet first. Then we dropped slightly less than an equal amount of chocolate batter on top.  The cookies needed about 10 minutes in my oven (which runs a little hot) and looked beautiful, with the yellow and chocolate cooking into a nice swirl patterned cookie.

As a girl I remember baking orange-chocolate chip cookies with a friend and they were delicious! Years later, I searched for the recipe and thankfully found it here!! I've made three batches already. The orange cake mix was tooooo much orange, but spice cake with raisins and banana with chocolate chips turned out great. Perhaps next time I will bake a couble batch using one orange cake mix and one white to tone it down. The possibilities are endless. Thanks for sharing!

These were such a hit! I used a Betty Crocker devil's food cake, and added 2 TBSP water to get a consistency that I liked. I used a tablespoon cookie cooker instead of a teaspoon as it states in the directions, so it took about 17 minutes for each batch to bake. I also added white chocolate chips. These were the most chocolatey cookies I've made, and sooo easy!!!

The other night my daughter had a craving for cookies at 9:00pm at night.  I told her it was to late to make some.  Then I remembered I had read something about cake mix cookies.  I got online and found this recipe.  It was super easy and tasty too.  The header had advised that they don't store very well.  So, we cooked 1/2 a batch and put the rest in the fridge.  I cooked the rest up a few days later and that worked out great.

2C of add-ins seems way too chunky so I used 3/4C. oats & 1C. M&Ms. Chewy and good, so simple to make! And a great way to use up an old box of cake mix :-)

These are awesome!  There are so many combinations for this!  I tried yellow and chocolate cake mixes.  The yellow cake was softer and puffy where the chocolate was somewhat flat.

SO yummy & SO easy to make! It literally took me about 10 minutes to make the batter. I did however make a few small changes. I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil, and I used a combination of milk chocolate and white chocolate chips. I'll definitely make these again!

I have just discovered cake mix cookies! Our favorite is red velvet with white chocolate chips. Rather than drop the cookies, I form the batter into a roll in wax paper and refrigerate for a few hours until stiff, then cut into 16 slices and cut each slice into half and roll into a ball, place 16 cookies on large cookie sheets lined with parchment paper and flatten the cookies with a glass to

Loved it..I had some candied pineapple, who knows how long or even where I got it. After reading this recipe I used a package of Pineapple Upside Down cake mix and added those candied pineapple chunks.  My family raved about them.

Very quick and easy.  I doubled the recipe and added  chopped pecans and chocolate.  I used one chocolate cake mix and one yellow.  They turned out very tasty.  I did use melted butter in place of the oil.

These are good and super simple!!  Great for kids to make.  I made them with my girls, but substituted applesauce for the oil and used an egg replacement since my son is allergic (1 T. vinegar, 1 T. milk and 1 t. baking powder for each egg - I just used one substitution)  These are good right out of the oven - but do not store well - became chewy and super moist on top - probably from all my substitutions!!  However, cookies don't usually last more than a day at my house anyway!!  Thanks for posting!

if the cookies get hard just put them in the microwave for like 10 sec or less and they will soften up.

This was a really great recipe.  Iused a lemon cake mix with white chocolate chips (1.5 cups). I also dipped the bottom of the cookies into graham cracker crumbs to give a nice juxtaposition between the soft center and the crispy bottom and also made them stick less to the pan.  I added, as others had suggested, 1.5 Tbs of water to make them chewyer. Overall, this recipe yielded great results.

Like the submitter of this recipe, I recieved this recipe from a friend a few days ago, and I just made them for the first time- they are AWESOME!! This recipe is the same as mine, except I add 1 tsp. vanilla. I made a devil's food cake mix with mini choc chips, and peanut butter chips. SO GOOD!! My husband kind of made fun of me making cake mix cookies..."why can't you just make regular choc. chip cookies?" he asked...then ate about 6 of them and made himself sick. ha ha. The beauty of these is that the sky's the limit...next time I am going to use a german choc cake mix, coconut, mini choc chips and walnuts! Yum! great post Nicole!

These cookies are(were) so good!
They almost tasted like a brownie! I got 30 fairly good sized cookies out of the recipe, I used a Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix, and only used 1 cup of chips instead of 2.(Our house is counting calories!) I was out of the kitchen in 30 minutes! THEY WERE SO EASY! They only took 5 minutes to mix and put on the cookie sheets.
I will be making these again! They would be great for people we had small children who wanted to help out in the kitchen!
If you've got a spare cake mix you've got to try these. THANKS NICOLE!

To keep these guys from drying out too much and getting crumbly weird...add 2 oz cream cheese to the batter...cookies get super soft and stay moist and yo can't beat how rich they taste.

German Chocolate cake mix, added 1 extra egg, & did add the extra water. Added 1c shredded coconut, 1/2c chocolate chips, & 1/2c pecan pieces. After cooling, frosted with a dollup of canned Coconut Pecan frosting. Delicious! Everyone raved & plate was empty in minutes.

The secret to keeping these cookies moist is using 1/3 cup mayo in place of the oil. I also soak 1 c of raisins in TWO TABLESPOONS of Vanilla! Mine seemed a little batter-like so I added oatmeal until it more cookie dough-ish! OH, this was with a Pudding in the Carrot Cake Mix and no chocolate chips. People will FIGHT over them, GUARANTEED!!

Yes, VERY easy!  Though I've always used spice cake mix and rolled them in sugar. My recipe say confectioners, but I used raw for a crunchy outside texture :-))

So quick and easy and yummy.  One batch I made was Red Vlevet.  Sprinkled those with powdered sugar.  Another was French Vanilla with sprinkles mixed in.  Last was Devils Food with Andes  mints.  All turned out delish.  The Andes Mints cookies were prob the crowd fav, but I liked them all.

This is a great make-with-your-kids cookie and to make something sweet with the dredges of your pantry, but that's about it. I used devil's food cake mix, butter instead of vegetable oil, organic eggs and M&M's instead of chocolate chips. I've always used a half cup of butter for cake mix cookies and even upping the amount of butter, these still turned out dry. Noone really ate these.

These aren't bad if you need something quick, but you do have to add something to them.  I tried several varieties & only one got a passing grade with my family.  I tried the following add ins:  chocolate chip mint chocolate flavored oatmeal, raisins & nuts (these ended up almost like a sweetbread & were by far the best flavored)

It doesnt get any easier than this unless you are buying pre-packaged!  I used a box of devil's food cake mix and rolled the dough into balls and coated them in powdered sugar for a crinkly effect like another reveiwer suggested and they were perfect!  I also added 2 Tbls. water like suggested.  They were done in exactly 8 minutes!  I can't wait to try more variations!  Perfect cookies for giving away during the Christmas season due to the low cost and ease!  Next, I'm trying the chocolate cake mix with Andes peppermint crunch baking chips!

This is the exact same recipe my mom used when I was growing up, and I still use it today. It's quick and simple, and the cookies are chewy and tasty. I've never had a problem with them hardening up, but then I always undercook my cookies a bit to make them a little chewy. This recipe is great with strawberry cake mix too!

A white cake mix works just fine, too. I also added an extra egg b/c it seemed a bit dry. Next time I would try adding 2 tbs. water instead, as the other reviewers suggest.

These are very easy to make when your in a rush. I chose a strawberry cake mix since I was making them for a Valentines's party.I also chopped up some Hershey's Hugs, the Raspberry White Creme ones and added them. It's a pink cookies with little pieces of white chocolate and milk chocolate in it.The strawberry cake mix is very artificial tasting, I would not recommend using it. It's not the recipes fault,it's my poor judgement. Choose a flavor you know you'll like. They also seemed very oily when making, but they up baked fine. I'm going to reduce the oil to 1/4 cup in my batch of chocolate and see how they turn out.

These cookies were delicious! I am the baker in the family.  The only bad thing about them is that they were hard the next day. I would reccomend them to a friend, though.

Super-easy preparation (you can mix this with your bare hands if you want) and this would be a fun project to do with a young child, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this recipe.  I found the cookies had an overpowering 'cake mix' flavor.  They're greasy and don't store well.  It's well worth the extra effort to make a recipe from scratch.

These are very good.  I found the batter to be too think to even mix the chips in so I added a couple of tablespoons of water.  This seems to have solved the issue.  I used a french vanilla cake mix and dark chocolate raspberry chips.  
I suspect the issues I had with the cookies after baking had to do with the chips.  They were very large and it made the cookies too soft to pick up.  I let them rest for 10 minutes, but this seems to have helped only marginally.

Everyone in my family ate one, and the rest just sat there for days. I followed the recipe to the T, and added the 2 T water as suggested. I wish I'd use the cake mix for a cake (which would have been VERY welcomed by my family!) and a cookie recipie for cookies....

These cookies were just so-so.  The chocolate
chips did not seem to meld well with the batter
(I used a yellow cake mix) and they looked awful going
into the oven.  Edible, but not spectacular.

This recipe was a huge hit with my friends and I've had repeated requests for them.  My favorite options are: 1) white cake mix with large Ghiardelli milk chocolate chips (I use a whole bag but you don't have to) and 2) triple chocolate fudge cake mix with small chocolate chips.  Just make sure to scoop them on the small side so they don't puff up like miniature cakes! :)

I loved how easy it is to make cookies. I have so many ideas and variations to make now. I have always used bread to keep cookies soft but you can also box them up while they are still warm and that helps keep them soft too. I will be buying a lot more cake mixes.

These cookies are just wonderful.  To keep them fresh try putting a piece of bread in the bag with them. It keeps them soft but you do need to change the bread when it gets hard.  Good luck.

Good recipe. A friend puts a Rolo candy in each cookie, rolls the dough in a ball around it, and bakes it.  Caramel in the center of each cookie -- mighty tasty!

OMDelicious!! I have never reviewed a recipe before, but these were so good I HAVE to! I used this recipe over the others because it called for less oil, which wasn't missed at all.  I used a chocolate mix and didn't add any goodies, but I found an old tub of cheap brand vanilla frosting in the fridge so I put that between two cookies and made little "oreos".  I'd made them for the little kids I teach at church, but despite my prejudice against partially hydrogenated soybean oils and modified corn starch, I ate the whole batch!! They were so delicious!!  I couldn't stop myself!

I wanted to make some special cookies for a friend at school and these were the perfect solution! After reading all the reviews for any modifications I decided to use the extra egg (which worked out well)and I used a chocolate fudge cake mix. They do seem to have an issue being made in a mixer since the dough is so thick but seemed the mixer seemed to be okay for the initial mixing (set on low) and then finish stirring by hand to get it all mixed in. I put the chocolate chips in after I mixed everything (I almost forgot to add them at all) and they seemed to mix up just fine. I used a large spoon to scoop them and they expanded to very big cookies when cooking I think I will try a small coffee spoon for the next batch. My oven runs a little on the hot side so I only cook them for 8 min turning them halfway through cooking so that they don't burn and then let them sit for a few min and then onto a cooling rack. My husband and son kept sneaking them all night to munch on so I would say overall a hit with my family.

YUM! I make a mean chocolate chip cookie from scratch, but sometimes I'm just not in the mood! These are SO easy and delicious. And you don't have to have much in your pantry to make them. My first go around was devil's food mix and white chocolate chips. Didn't have to worry about them getting stale, family gobbled them up. Thanks!

I think these came out fantastic for being so quick and easy. I used a butter cake mix and only about 1 and a  Half cups of chips.  Everything else was the same.

They were very tasty. I used French Vanilla and butterscotch chips. They looked like little biscuits, but that happens with my cookies some times. Not sure why. I especially like that they didn't taste like cake mix.

I had to try these as i love soft cookies. I used a cake mix with pudding in the mix and they turned out excellent. I left out the chips and used whipped frosting between two cookies to make little sandwiches. My kids loved them!

I Love making these cookies. They are so easy! The only thing I do differently is use unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. Tastes no different and cancels out alot of the fat

I think if you use butter instead of veggie oil that the cookies seem to stay fresher longer.  I have never used veggie oil...always butter and have never had a problem with them getting tough.  Endless possibilities with this recipe.  We made cotton candy cookies with cotton candy icing when they came out with those little packets of flavor to add to icing...we just used it in the cake mix and icing...they were yummy!

YUMMY! The kids (10 and 11) made these last night with very little help. We used a butter yellow cake mix (pudding inside), 1/3 c veg oil, 2 eggs, a splash of water, and an entire bag of mini m&ms. They baked perfectly at 350 for 10 minutes. I woke up this morning to mouse bites out of the ones I left packaged for their lunch... they must like them.

Love this recipe! I was able to whip these up very quickly and my friends loved them. My only suggestion is to make sure to mix them very well, or they will be a bit grainy (although I was the only one who noticed this)

Absolutely LOVE these. There are so many different variations you can make, and they all turn out great. Like others have stated, the key is to store them in an air tight container. Great, easy, and quick recipe.

These were soooo easy and soooo good!  I love how you can mix up the flavors.  I had devil's food fudge mix on hand and mixed 1/2 of the batter with reeses peanut butter chips and 1/2 the batter with dark chocolate chips/toffee chips.  The peanut butter one was by far my favorite.  Can't wait to play around with other mixes!  I added another egg also because I couldn't seem to get all the cake mix moist with just the two.  Really really good!

Super easy and super yummy! Used Dark Chocolate cake, that's all I had. 4 Tbsp. of water as suggested by others. Very rich! Another review said if cake and brownie came together and had a baby, this is what it tastes like....so true!! Best of both worlds!

I used applesauce instead of oil and spread the batter into a square baking dish. It made really nice bar cookies. I also tried chocolate cake mix and that was awesome. Chocolate, chocolate chip bar cookies!

Usually I'm an only made from scratch kind of girl and don't particularly like using boxed mixes, but my roommate had one and needed to use up some eggs. I added a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract and used white and semi sweet chocolate chips. The cookies came out really fluffy and soft right out of the oven. Honestly, not my favorite thing I've made, but they were easy. I just prefer all traditional homemade baked goods from scratch over boxed stuff any day.

WE ARE HOOKED!!! THEY ARE SUPER EASY AND STAY MOIST AND CHEWY FOR DAYS.  YESTERDAY FOR THE 4TH OF JULY I MADE LEMON COOKIES WITH A LEMON CAKE MIX AND JUST ADDED A LITTLE ORANGE PEEL, WHITE CHOC MAC NUT COOKIES WITH WHITE CAKE MIX, SPICE CAKE COOKIES WITH RAISINS AND COCONUT AND CHOC COOKIES WITH CHOCOLATE CAKE COOKIES.  WE HAD A HUGE GATHERING OF PEOPLE AND THESE WERE THE MOST ASKED FOR RECIPE ALL DAY!!! [AND THERE WAS SOME AWESOME HOMEMADE FOODS THERE]

I love this recipe! After trying several different homemade cookie recipes with varying results, I decided to try this extremely simple recipe. If you like to play around with different flavors this is great because no matter what flavor cake mix or add-ins you use, it always comes out perfect.  My favorite combination so far has been Butter Pecan cake mix with milk chocolate chips and sliced almonds. AMAZING!!! Great to do with kids too!

I have always used 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1/3 cup; much smoother.  This time I used 1 cup caramel morsels, 1/4 cup toffee bits and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chip morsels instead of just the 2 cups semi-sweet chips.

These were quick and easy to make.  I used french vanilla cake mix and only one cup of chocolate chips.  It took about 15 minutes for mine to be done for some reason.  They were very sweet and soft.

I like using lemon cake mix, or a white or yellow cake mix with different flavorings, like orange. Rootbeer flavoring is good too!

Love the soft chewiness. I used devil's food cake mix and added peanut butter chips and chopped walnuts. Go crazy with the goodies you put in! It's also real easy and quick!

Fast, easy and delicous. I brought these to work and they only lasted for about 20 minutes.  I used 1/2 cup melted butter instead of the oil. They do seem to harden quickly, but haven't lasted long enough for me to test the other suggestions on keeping them moist!

I used devils food cake mix and chocolate chips - they came out good but a little bland tasting - could have used a little vanilla extract, or almond.  Also, mix was very dry - another tablespoon of oil or water may have helped.

I used the applesauce, vanilla, and water as suggested.  My cookies needed at least 12 minutes - maybe because I have an old oven.  I used devil's food cake and m&ms, since I didn't have chocolate chips and the dorm only has a vending machine.
