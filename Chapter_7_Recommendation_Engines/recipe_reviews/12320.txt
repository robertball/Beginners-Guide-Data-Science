Very sweet, moist, juicy, and just plain delicious.  The directions in the recipe do not say to pour the contents of the bowl with the peaches over the "dough", it says to spoon the peaches over the dough.  Therefore, do not pour all the liquid from that bowl onto your dough...otherwise it will get sloppy.  When you "spoon" something up, you are suppose to leave the liquid behind.  This is a perfect tasting cobbler.

This will DEFINITELY be the peach cobbler that I make from now on! I did make few changes, though. First, I added more than a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the peach mixture-about 1/4 teaspoon of each. Next, I also added about 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the mixtue. To combat the extra juiciness, I replaced the cornstarch with 6 tablespoons of flour. Then, I scooped out approximately 1/2 cup of the peach mixture liquid. Another key  is allowing the cobbler to "set" after it comes out of the oven. Just let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the juices to thicken. DELICIOUS!

At midnight last night my husband sprang the information of a family get together today.  Our part was to bring a dessert.  Having just been to our local market, I had a nice fresh basket of peaches and some wild blueberries on hand. I whipped this together in no time. In this recipe I did not add any butter to the fruit mix, only the melted butter in the baking pan. I used 4 fresh peaches and about 1 cup of blueberries. After reading previous reviews, I decided to only use 1/4 cup of water. I also used whole wheat instead of all purpose flour. Cooking time for me was only 45 minutes. The result? Yummy, moist, everybody raved!  Personally, I wasn't keen on the whole wheat flour, and I like my cobbler quite cakey, so I'd double the batter next time.  Definitely a big thumbs up here! I will make it again.  Give it a try!

Very yummy peach cobbler!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, using five large fresh peaches instead of canned peaches.  I peeled them and cut into wedges.  I love how the cobbler rises to the top around the peaches!  I did have to cook for 90 minutes instead of 60 minutes, as it was still doughy at the recommended time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have looked for years for the perfect cobbler recipe and believe me this is it!!!  Must confess I read many of the reviews before trying; making few changes.  Added more peaches; substituted 1/2 cup juice for water.  I love spices so added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Mixed spices with cornstarch and heated on low to thicken.  Eliminated salt in batter and added 1-tsp. vanilla.  Reduced size of pan to 8"x11" glass and baked for 45-minutes.  Allowed it to set for 1-hour before serving.  I have just tried a small dish before serving my husband.
It is absolutely "out of this world".  Will never look further for cobbler recipe.  Thanks ever so much.

My family loved it!!  I was out of cornstarch, but I replaced it with 6 Tablespoons of flour.  You can replace flour for cornstarch.  1 teaspoon of cornstarch = 2 Tablespoons of flour.  For the person who used 10 year old Baking powder, you can replace it with...1 teaspoon of baking powder = 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar plus 1/4 teaspoon Baking soda.
  The only thing I would change on this recipe is to double the batter....I perfer more of the cake part of it.
  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

This was just the thing I was looking for.  The "cobbler" part was soft and cakey, and you couldn't tell the peaches were canned. I was confused about whether to add all of the liquid or not, so I just added what looked right (about half), and it turned out great.

This was DELICIOUS - the only peach cobbler recipe I'll use for now on!  I followed others' advice and omited the water and used about half the peach juice, and it turned out perfect.

This was a good recipe but it was a bit on the soggy side even though I baked it longer than an hour. Now that I look at past reviews, I know now not to include the juice with the peaches.

THis recipe is very similar to the cobbler that my Grandmother used to make without a recipe.  It only missed the five star rating as it was a bit runny.  I agree with other reviews to reduced the liquid in the peach mixture and perhaps a slightly smaller dish.  Otherwise it brought back fond memories.

This was very good.  As someone else suggested, remember to spoon in the fruit & don't use all the liquid.  Also, next time I won't use so much butter. You don't need all that butter in the pan...I'd cut it by half.  I found the fruit greasy.

Excellent cobbler.  I just made it.  I did a bit of adjusting.  I added more cinnamon and nutmeg, and added a bit of lemon juice to freshen the taste of the peaches.  Also, once I mixed all of the ingredients for the peaches together, I heated the mixture up and let the peaches cook a bit.  I added the cornstarch to the heated mixture thus removing the too much liquid issue people seemed to have because the juice thickened up before I put it over the batter.  All in all I will probably make this a lot.  Thanks for the recipe.

An awesome cobbler.  Definitely double the cobbler part.  I mixed cinnamon and nutmeg straight into the mixture as well as sprinked a little on top.  The recipe says to use peaches and juice.  Pouring out most of the syrup and only keeping about 1/4 - 1/3 of a cup works beautifully.  I also cut the butter in the pan to a 1/3 cup.  Eat hot with vanilla ice cream.

I have made this several times and today I made a few changes to it.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  I also cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  All I can say is that it was EXCELLENT!

Thanks Jill for submitting this.  I'm from the south and peach cobbler is one of our staple desserts.  My usual recipe calls for refrigerated pie crusts, but this was a nice change of pace. I usually add more liquid than what's called for but only for personal preference...(it's fine as is). Do add a little peach juice and maybe a splash of vanilla...it gives off such a good taste.  I'm wondering how apricots would work in place of peaches?

Very good; just make sure you only spoon the peaches over the batter; added all of the juices will make it a mushy runny mess. I added about a 1/4 cup of the juices becasue I like mine kind of moist. I also added 2 tablespoons of sugar to my peaches...I like things sweet.  My husband was convinced that he didn't like peach cobbler, but he really liked this!!

Delicious! I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and left out the water. I used canned peaches with no sugar added. There was exactly 1/2 peach juice in the can and I dissolved the corn starch in that. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out perfect!

Followed exactly and it ended up being consumed in 6 servings. I found the flavor not too sweet (a plus, IMO) The 'crust' rose to the top and crusted over okay, but I think it was just a bit 'too thin'. I'll increase the flour next time to 1 1/3 cups. The peach mixture was too thin. I think the sliced peaches with juice was too much liquid. Next time I'll decrease it to 1 cup and consider increasing the cornstarch by 30 to 50%. I'll also increase the seasoning in the peaches somewhat. I don't think the 'pinch' of cinnamon and nutmeg was enough. The final change I'll make next time will be to  heat the peach & cornstarch mixture so it thickens. That way I'll know if it the amount of thickening is correct and I won't have to worry about the cornstarch not blending evenly or lumping. The servings listed was 18. I think this is greatly overstated. I served it as dessert after dinner and got 6 servings out of it. We might have managed 8 without having people feel neglected, but there is NO WAY we'd have gotten anywhere near the recommended servings. These changes are minor; I am happy to have found a quick and easy recipe that uses canned peaches (this IS Alaska, after all).

Scrumpdillyishious! I used this recipe with sliced fresh peaches that wouldn't get ripe enough to eat. I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 8" square glass pan,and because I didn't read the directions carefully I mixed all the batter ingredients with melted butter and poured it over the top like most cobblers and baked it for 45 minutes and it turned out great! Eat warm with vanilla ice cream for the best results.

Very good!  Family and friends ate every last bit.  I added an additional 15 ounce can of peaches, though.  The 29 ounces can was going to make the cobbler too skimpy.

I love this recipe. My mom made it when I was a kid and my children and I still make it every summer. I make the cake 1 1/2 times the recipe and have the butter melting in the pan as the oven preheats. It's ready by the time the batter is done. We just put fresh or canned fruit (minus the juice) over the top and sprinkle with sugar, you can add cinnamon  and nutmeg, then bake. Amazing with fresh blackberries.

Awesome Recipe! I made two changes: I added 50% more peaches (but not more juice) and then, when it was half-baked in the oven, I sprinkled crushed pecans on top. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream and it's amazing!!!

I have made this recipe several times.  It is always a hit!  However, this recipe does not serve 18 as stated.  I doubled the amount of peaches and still did not serve 18.  12 people got a tablespoon of cobbler.  If making for a crowd - make several and double the peaches to give more substance.

This is a great recipe.  My changes included using (2) 15oz cans of pears and (1) 15oz can of peaches as that is all I had on hand.  I used extra fruit because I wanted a larger recipe.  I doubled the batter, but still only used 1/2cup butter in the pan.  Instead of topping the fruit/batter with cinnamon and nutmeg, I added them directly to the batter, which made for a nice overall taste.  Like other reviewers, I added about 1/2 of the fruit/cornstarch/cinnamon/nutmeg/butter juice mixture - which worked very well - it wasn't soupy at all.  I did have one question though, the directions say to add the 2 tbsp. melted butter to the fruit juice mixutre - this caused the melted butter to immediately solidify into small 'globs' of butter - I'm assuming this is normal?  It didn't seem to hurt anything, it just looked funny.  Othewise, this recipe, even doubled fit nicely in a 9x13 pan and browned nicely at about 55 min.

Make sure to SPOON peaches onto batter without juice so that cobbler is not soggy (I used a slatted spoon) and you'll enjoy a delicious dessert.  Also, one hour is definitely too long.  I recommend starting to check after 45 minutes in the oven.

I love love love this recipe!  I'm glad I read the reviews first before making it, though. If I hadn't I think I probably would have poured all the juice in, rather than spooning the peaches out and then discarding the remainder of the juice. Everyone loved it and I will definitly be making this one again soon.

THIS IS SOO VERY EASY. I MAKE MINE IN A 9X9 PAN AND DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF PEACHES. SOMETIMES I WILL ALSO SLICE AN APPLE OR TWO AND THROW IT IN, ALONG WITH A LITTLE EXTRA CINNAMON AND VANILLA. VERY GOOD, QUICK, AND SIMPLE! THANKS JILL

This tasted yummy but looked like a gooey mess. Then I re-read some of the other reviews and it hit me that I didn't SPOON the peaches out of the juice as the recipe says. I poured all the juice in too! No wonder it came out all mushy. It really tasted great though!

I took everyone's advice and used less liquid...also drained the peaches. The cobbler was good and old fashioned tasting. Next time though, I'll add more peaches, and maybe something with a little tang, like raspberries. The kids loved this as is though.

I decided to make a peach cobbler especially since they are my husband's favorite.  I am not much of a baker, but decided to have my oldest daughter search for a recipe for me. She came upon this site, and I discovered many choices to pick from, however this seemed to be one of the easiest recipes, so I tried it. Well, my husband and I loved it.  I have even decided to make this my official peach cobbler recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a super cobbler, it is even better if you sprinkle the top with cinnamon/sugar or a little powdered sugar for a crispy top! Yum!

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert and I thought it was fantastic. Everyone loved it! I followed the directions exactly, only I added an extra 16oz can of peaches. Also, I did not dump the entire peach/juice mixture onto the batter, I *spooned* it on. I also ladled just a little bit of the juice over the top for added flavor. My cobbler was not runny at all. It came out absolutely perfect. I will definitely make this again in the future. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe was really good. When i first took it out it looked a little runny, but it thickened up and was even better the next day. Next time i would like to put it in an 8x8 pan to make it thicker slices.

Tasted terrific, but recipe should be altered by stating NOT to add all of the peach juice. Very runny and does not seem to cook all the way. Next time, I would add only a small portion of the juice from the can of peaches.

This recipe was good if you are looking for a cake like cobbler.  I would double up the crust recipe, as I felt my was alittle thin.  I mixed some brown sugar and nutmeg in the batter.  I also used nectarines in place of the peaches.  Yummy!

This is a very good and tasty peach cobbler!  It's very easy to prepare.  The batter makes a delicious crust like cake that's not too sweet (just right).  I also cut the amount of sugar (for the batter) to three-quarter cup and used the juice of the peaches instead of water.  Though the cobbler was alittle watery, next time I'll let the peaches drain on paper towels to rid them of excess juice or cut the amount of juice to one-third cup instead.  Other than that, again I say this is a very good and tasty recipe.  Will make it again!

Yumm!!!  I followed some of the suggestions in the other reviews!  I also added a few TBSP sugur to the batter as well as some cinnamon.  I spooned the peaches and no juice.  Mine was good but could use some more juice..so spoon peaches and add 1/2 cup maybe of juice.  I also think that 9 X 13 is too big.  I doubled recipe and made a 9 X 13 and a 8 X 8.  Try this one it is good!

This is a great recipe but I altered it slightly after reading other reviews and it turned out fabulous.  I took two pans to an office party and they were completely gone in less than 10 minutes with people begging for more.  

Instead of adding water to dissolve the cornstarch, I mixed the cornstarch into the peach syrup.  I added a tablespoon of vanilla to the peaches and when I put the peaches ontop of the batter I used some of the syrup but not all of it.  I also added a pinch of grated orange zest to the batter which added a delightful (very mild but sweet) flavor to the cobbler.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipes was wonderful. The only thing that got me was the spooning the peaches in the batter.  I really didn't know, If I should spoon the peaches out and pour the liquid too, or just the peaches. So I spooned, then I poured the liquid, what a mess when it was finish. But it still was good.  I tried it the next morning, and it was so DELICIOUS. I did not pour the liquid.  I will be cooking this again.

This is a very good cobbler recipe,however,I simply use self-rising flour(elimanating the salt and baking powder)making it even easier.

FINALLY...a moist, cakelike peach cobbler recipe!  I've been looking for a good recipe like this for 16 years (the whole time I've been married) but most cobbler recipes are for the dry, biscuit kind.  Thanks for the great recipe.  My husband told me to be sure not to lose it.

This was GREAT!  I told my partner this morning that the title was Best Peach Cobbler Ever and that it was the truth.  I did follow others advice and omitted the water and cornstarch and it came out perfectly.  I did sprinkle about a teaspoon of flour into the peach mixture to get that jellied consistancy before I spooned onto the batter.  I also used fresh peaches instead of canned.  If it came down to canned peaches I wouldn't even bother to have made it.  I must say that I have never made peach cobbler before so is this REALLY the best ever??  I guess I'll never know because this will be my go to peach cobbler recipe!

I used frozen peaches and this cobbler was the best ever - not at all sloppy.  I also used buttermilk plus 1 tsp. of baking soda instead of fresh milk and baking powder.  I'm not a fan of nutmeg so I substituted 1 tsp. of almond flavoring.  It was delicious - a big hit!

I baked it for 2 hours and it's still just a soupy mess with a few (4?) spots of biscuit that are brown on top and like pudding underneath.  I let it cool for a while but it's basically still full of liquid uncooked biscuit mixed into the peaches.  There was so much butter that I had to use 4 layers of paper towels to soak it all up from the top.  I'm really upset that I used up $10 of nice fresh organic peaches for this mess.  And yes, I've gone back through and confirmed that all the right amounts were put into everything.  I even made sure to spoon the peaches onto the batter so there was juice left behind, as one reviewer said.  I have no idea how other people managed to have success.  Next time, I'm sticking to putting the biscuit mix on top the way I've always done.

Best cobbler I’ve baked; comes close to Mom Hatter’s recipe 50+ years ago. Am sensitive to sugar products so purchased canned peaches in extra light syrup. Drained syrup, then used 1/2 cup in place of water (thanks Shayla). Microwaved juice 20 seconds so cornstarch wouldn’t clump up (it was smooth). Melted 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter in baking dish while oven heated; excellent idea – removed dish before butter burned and set aside. Omitted pinch of salt since I used salted butter. Other than using peach juice for water, I added 1-1/4 teaspoons of sugar (right amount for me) to the additional cinnamon and nutmeg. Baked 50 minutes. When pulled from oven, cobbler was very juicy. However, once cooled down most of the juice had gone into the cobbler "cake". Ate it warm, without ice cream. Like Breebugs, I could have eaten the whole thing but am saving it for the weekend. GREAT TASTE, NOT SWEET (due to extra light syrup). Thanks Jill for sharing.

This really is the best peach cobbler ever! I did make one change though. After reading a few reviews saying it was a bit runny, I decided to leave out the 1/2 cup water and just use 1/2 a cup of the peach juice to dissolve the cornstarch. Worked great!

Very good, My husband thought it was a little doughy. I added fresh peaches to the canned peaches and cut the liquid by half. I didn't think it was too doughy. The kids loved it with vanilla ice cream. I will be making this one again.

It's excited to have a peach cobbler we can make int the winter. My family really enjoyed this. Instead of 1/2 c. butter, I used 1/3 c. oil. I also cut the water to 1/4 c. Even with those changes, I still drained about half the liquid from the peaches, and it's a good thing I did - it was very moist as is, any more liquid would have ruined it. Serve hot, with vanilla ice cream for a real splurge.

A++++ Wow, this actually was the BEST peach cobbler ever! I took the advice of others and sprinkled brown sugar along with cinammon on top.  This created a slightly crunchy crust. Mmmmm! It wasn't runny at all, due to the fact that I remembered to SPOON the peaches into the dough.  I wil be making this for the next potluck! :-)

This was a great quick, easy cobbler and my entire family loved it.  I used peaches in light syrup to cut back on the sweetness.  I served it while it still warm with ice cream, perfect!

This was very good!  It ended up being different from any cobbler I've ever made, but we loved it!  The crust rose to the top and covered the peaches just like it was supposed to. I have an apple cobbler recipe VERY similar, but it ends up being crispy....we loved the doughy/gooey  change.  The flavor was excellent with just the right amount of juice throughout.  It does thicken up after about an hour or so after coming from the oven. My hubby complained of still being full from dinner, but managed to have a second helping with vanilla ice cream :)  I only baked this for 50 minutes and it was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!!

Wow, not sure how this got 5 stars. The batter doesn't cover the peaches, so it is just peaches sitting in some rubbery crust.  I will not be making this again

Very "juicy". Follow others advice to reduce the juice.  However, my husband loved all the juice and served it over ice cream!

On the advice of other reviewers, I made a few alterations.  My peaches were unsweetened so I added 1/3 cup white sugar to them. I cut the water down to 1/4 cup  and left out the final tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I added just a bit of both to the cake mixture. Very, very good, especially warm with a dallop of whipped cream.

I would have gave it a 5 star, but it was to moist almost wet.  I even followed other's reviews and omitted the water from the peach and only used 1/2 the peach juice.  Next time I will only use 1/4 juice.  It was very good, I added added about half the amount more of all the "cake" ingrediants based on others also.  It tasted great.  The nutmeg and cin. on top just went towards the center, don't know if I will do that again. Oh, I cut the peaches in half for more bite size pieces.   But I will sure use this again.

LOVEEEDDDDDD this. it disappeared  15 minutes after i took it out the oven. Word of advice....drain the juice that comes with the peaches, if you forget or you like the extra sweetness; let the liquid cool and get firm by letting it sit for 20 minutes after its cooked.

This really was good.  I did a few things differently.  I used 5 peeled fresh peaches instead of canned.  For the sugar, I did half white, half brown.  I also added one tsp. of vanilla in the crust and a splash in the fruit.  Lastly I baked it an extra five minutes as I wanted to make sure the crust was fully cooked.  Served with ice cream....delicious!!!

I have made this recipe several times. It is such a huge hit. My husband who absolutely loves peach cobbler loves this recipe. Everyone loves it and ask for the recipe. Also, I pour in my peach mixture and then spoon batter on top and it comes out perfect everytime. Never soupy or sloppy

Be sure to pay attention to the above comment regarding "spooning" the peaches. Alternatively, drain the juice from the can of peaches and then you won't have a problem with it coming out soupy. Pretty good recipe though, overall. Those instructions just should be a little bit more clear.

after getting this recipe down i added my own touches to it like adding a dash of vanilla to both batter and peach mixtures. everybody that i have made this for has always came back for more i also found it best to use the cheap disposable aluminum pans to bake it in.

The recipie is not clear on whether or not to use all the liquid when you spoon out the peaches.  I used it all and my cobbler was so watery it looked like soup on top & had a flan-like texture. I cooked it an additional 30 minutes. Believe it or not, it was still delicious!

Next time I'll be leaving out the liquid.

My family really likes this although I still prefer a cobbler with a biscuit-type topping.  The second time I made this I omitted the water in the topping and just mixed the cornstarch with some reserved juice from the peaches.

If you like doughy cobbler like I do and most of the people I make this for you will love this recipe.  Whenever I bring this cobbler to a function it disappears almost instantly. 

I do imagine that it is probably cultural, geographic, etc. as to what people like in a cobbler so those of you who like the liquidy cobblers with the crust on top will probably not like this cobbler.  However, if you love the sweet mushy crust of a good cobbler you will love this recipe because it is a gooey doughy crust throughout the cobbler.

This was just OK (Can you rename it "Just OK Peach Cobbler"?) Next time I will omit the nutmeg and drain the peaches. It did have a strangely sticky consistency, and definitely needs to be topped with either whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

this was VERY tasty.  i agree with many of the others that have tried the recipe though.. their wasnt enough crust!..  i dont know if i used too big of a pan but my peaches didnt even sink to the bottom!   VERY good taste though! the only thing i changed was that i added a bit of vanilla to the crust and i made sure i spooned the peaches and not dump in all the juice

This is absolutely delicious! I have made it twice now. The only thing I added to my fresh peaches was about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. It is way better with fresh peaches! Sooo yummy!

We really like it the first time I made it. I added about a 1/4 cup of suger to the recipe. I didn't add all of the liquid from the peach mixture to the pan. But the second time I made it I did and it wasn't as good. It was alittle to runny the second time. So next time I won't add all the liquid.

I added some frozen blue berries.  Serve this warm with French Vanilla Ice Cream.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of lidquid for a firmer dish and also increase the "batter" for a bigger crust.

This is a GREAT recipe.  The only trouble I had was that the directions, in my opinion, were unclear.  At the point when you spoon the peaches over the batter, use a SLOTTED spoon, otherwise, the cobbler will be "runny."  I will definately make this again!

I was disappointed in this recipe. I didn't expect it to taste so cakey and there weren't enough peaches in it. Also, the juice was a little watery.

This was very good. The first cobbler I ever made! Baked it ahead, and then  rewarmed it later in the day after keeping it at room temperature. I may cut down on the sugar a bit next time. It would be interesting to make this in individual ramekins. Served with lightly sweetened whipped cream. Thanks!

Anyway, I wish I had read the reviews first! Mine turned into a soupy mess, and since I cooked it a bit longer to see if it would firm up, the bottom burned as well. Luckily, I have a non-discriminating crowd to feed who didn't mind the super-sweet peach moosh covered in vanilla ice cream.

I just wasn't impressed. First of all, the amount is insufficient for a 9 x 13 baking pan. You end up with something less than a half-inch deep. I wasn't enamored with the "crust" either. Back to the drawing board on this one.

Since this is my first time making a peach cobbler, i made two batches. the first came out like a sponge cake, that was my bad, i over cooked it. and with that knowledge, the second one came out better. very sweet, for some reason though it kinda tasted like rice pudding... just a tad. but i don't know what peach cobbler taste like, and as long as i tasted the peaches i like it :)

after reading the reviews i kept out the water and added a bit of vanilla. i think things that are going to have cinnamon need a dash of vanilla. thats my own personal taste though

I took suggestions from some of the other posts: I added an extra can of peaches because we like ours with a lot of fruit( I might even add a 3rd can next time) added sugar to the fruit mixture. Every thing else I did according to the original recipe. Then right before I put it in the oven I put cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar on top. It lasted one night. My daughter ate so much she had to lie down. Vanilla ice cream is the perfect topper.

This was the best peach cobbler I have ever made. My daughter even liked it and said, "I don't usually like peach cobbler, but this was delicious!" I do think I will either use more peaches or more cornstarch so it is not quite as juicy. Definitely a keeper, though!

Very good.  I'm sure that mine was runny because I was using peaches I froze myself, and I had no idea how much of the liquid to include.  I probably should have drained more of it off.  This is a delicious recipe that everyone loved, despite the runny texture.

It's quick and easy, but not the style of cobbler I grew up on.  But great for what it is, and seemingly the fluffy cobblers are more the general rule.  It'll definitely be something I'll do when I want something quick & easy.  I did use the juice and the fruit, as we like our cobbler juicy.  I did kind of heap my spoon of corn starch, though, to keep it from being runny. I usually stick to a recipe if I'm going to review it, and I think this one is fine just as it reads.  A winner! I did check it about the time the batter had baked up, and sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on top for it to crisp.

This is THE family potluck dinner peach cobbler recipe. Every dinner in which I have cooked this it has been a hit. Always the first dessert to go with the pan scraped clean. I cannot fathom the poor reviews but I guess to each his own.

I have never made peach cobbler before. This recipe looked easy, so I thought I would try it. I agree with the other reviews, that it is imperative to spoon the peach mixture over the batter. After baking the cobbler, I thought it still looked a little soupy, but I let it set for about an hour and it thickened up. My family loved this dessert, and I will definitely make it again.

much a disapointment. I think with a lot of alterations this recipe might turn out pretty good but I won't be trying it again.

This was very good & different!!
I have never made a cobbler like this before. It was very moist, but did set up after a little time. I will make this again & again :)
In my review I forgot to mention that I used 8 large fresh peaches instead of canned.I also used vanilla soya milk & next time will use less melted butter in the pan.

This cobbler was great & extremely easy to make!!  I used 6 fresh peaches instead of canned and cream instead of milk.  I cut the water back to a shade under 1/4C because the peaches were so juicy.  Wonderful recipe!!

This has become a staple in our house because of my sweets-loving hubby.  He wanted peach cobbler, so I made this one and have been making it often ever since.  I leave out the nutmeg, add a little more cinnamon, and a little vanilla to the batter...happy hubby.

This was ok...it just didn't have much flavor which may have been my fault.  I used lite peaches and added tbsp less of butter.  Will try again.  Very easy.

Excellent!  Peach cobbler is one of my husbands favorites and I have used a lot of different recipes.  This was the easiest and best.  The juice had  smooth consistency/not watery. The crust was great. I did add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the peach mixture prior to spooning over batter, used unsweetened peaches.  I cut butter down to 1 tablespoon in peach mixture and down to 1/4 cup in bottom of pan. My husband says to make sure this one gets in my recipe box.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time I've made peach cobbler, and I think it turned out pretty well!  It had a bit of a bitter taste(not sure if it was really bitter, but a bit off somehow)  I also think this would be better with fresh peaches, as using the canned didn't seem "peachy" enough for me.  But very easy to follow recipe that produces good results!

Hubby sure liked this recipe, I'm not one for peach cobbler.  The crust part was actually pretty good with vanilla ice cream.  He told me next time I made this to put another layer of crust over the peaches.  So I'm going to try that next time.  Overall it was pretty good, and I'm keepin' it!

This recipe was the "bomb."  I made it twice in one week for my husband.  I carefully "spooned" the peaches over the flour mixture and it turned out great both times.  It goes into our permanent recipe collection.

This recipe was a hit for my mentor's last minute going away party (not to mention a first attempt!).  Not being a southerner I was nervous about the reception.  Needless to say, all the "from scratch-ers" wanted the recipe.  Claiming it was one of the best they'd ever had.

I just got married, and this is the first dessert I've tried. It always comes out perfect. My husband loves fruity desserts, so I bake this about twice a week now. He can't get enough...and he said it's better than his moms. That's the best compliment ever!

I tried doubling the batter, but found the cobbler a little too doughy (and 30 minutes longer to cook). I also added raspberries - great suggestion! It was very tasty though, so I'm sure I'll try again - with the original recipe. Great with vanilla sauce or ice cream!

Definitely give this a try !!! I found this recipe back in 2002 or 2003 and here we are going into 2018 and I still use ONLY this recipe for peach cobbler. I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas and have to make 6 pans because I have so many people who like it and my kids of course want a take home pan as well. **only addition i made was I added 1/4 cup light brown sugar to the peach mixture and another 1/4 cup light brown sugar sprinkled on top with the cinnamon and nutmeg.

This is a good peach cobbler, but not the ‘Best Peach Cobbler Ever’ as the title implies.  I thought this recipe was a very thin dessert made in a 13x9 pan.  The next time, I would make it in an 11x7 pan to add thickness and substance to the dessert.  In step number 3 – it does tell you to spoon the peaches over the batter.  It doesn’t say what to do with the juice.  I chose to add the peaches and the juice to the top of the batter.  The top batter did bake up nicely, but, not sure I made the right choice.  I served this warm with vanilla ice cream.  We had company the night I made this, and Ron’s favorite desserts always involve peaches.  He loved this dish and the other liked it very well.  I will try this again, at some point, using a smaller pan and only using the peaches.  At that time, I will update this review.  For now, I will be leaving a 4-star rating as the recipe was good as I made it, but I can see improving it with minor changes.

I have made this many times over the past few years & everytime it's a hit. It is so easy to put together and I never have any complaints. It's the perfect thing to make when I have to bring dessert to a potluck (easy to keep ingredients on hand in pantry)...no changes to recipe required!

I made this peach cobbler using two 28oz. cans of peaches... this was very easy to make. I made this as directed but I did cut the butter. If you really want to  cut the cholesterol use an "i can't believe its not butter" substitute I don't think that will change the flavors at all. I did mix cinnamon in the mixture & didnt' sprinkle the  top w/ sugar  it's sweet enough. This really looks good & taste it's best after cool down served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. However this is not the best cobbler I have ever had my great grandmother made her cobbler & she rolled out a dough & layered it w/ fresh pealed peaches & homemade peach syrup.. it was layered like lasagna with a thin strip of dough between the layers. Its a lot more time consuming but that's the best cobbler I ever had. I wish she was still here

My husband always says he doesn't like peaches.  Well, he couldn't resist this dessert.  He ate two huge helpings.  It is very easy.  When that batter makes it to the top and starts turning golden brown and the butter is bubbling, it is irresistible.

Reduced to 12 servings, used 3 fresh peaches rather than canned, and baked in a 7 x 11 baking dish. Looks odd when it goes into the oven, but ignore the fact that the butter that was in the bottom is now floating on top.  It will be perfect!  Just about right for 4-6 peach cobbler lovers - not 12!

I made this with 3 very ripe peaches and omitted the butter and water in the peach mixture.  Since there was no extra liquid, I dumped the entire mixture into the batter.  I was out of white sugar (darn roommate!) so I substituted with light brown sugar.  Added a little vanilla extract to both mixtures.  This wasn't as sweet as I'm used to, which isn't a bad thing, and definitely tastes delicious with vanilla ice cream.

I made this cobbler for desert after Sunday dinner and it was great. I made twice as much because I have big family and it was a hit. This was my first time making cobbler and I will make it again. It came out just right, I spooned the peaches in and topped with cinnimon and nutmeg. UMMM!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, it was a big hit with my family, it was consumed in no time.  The recipe is very simple an easy to follow.  My only problem was that I spooned the peach mixture onto the batter, I think it would have been a lot better had I poured the entire peach mixture onto the batter.  But I definitely will be making this cobbler again!!!!

This is an awesome recipe! I used Splenda Sugar blend in place of regular sugar, which made this recipe not as sweet. Basically, the sweetness was just right and not overpowering. Instead of scooping the peaches onto the dough, I put everything (the juice and peaches) on the dough, baked it for 1 hour and let it set for 1 hour. It was not runny at all. I also incorporated wheat flour into the recipe w/all purpose flour.  I will definitely make this again!  My family is wanting more!!!

This was a very easy recipe to prepare when short on time. Next time I would cut the amount of sugar probably by 1/2. I found it very sweet, the peaches already have a sweetness to it so adding a cup was too much.

I made this tonight because I had leftover peaches that did not get eaten. I followed the recipe exactly and did use all the peach juice and left in oven for one hour. I admit when I took it out, I thought it was going to be too runny. However, from the other reviews, I did let it sit for an hour and it did set up very well and it was delicious! My husband loved it. The only thing I could imagine this needed was more peaches (without any more liquid). I will be making this one again!

It's okay, nothing spectacular.  The peaches were the best part.  It looks and tastes more like a bread pudding than a cobbler, and my family didn't believe me when I told them it was supposed to be cobbler.  Tasted good, though.

I was looking for a cobbler with more of a buscuit, this seemed more like a dumpling type. Like another review said, it was a flan-like texture. Maybe because of the liquid discrepancy, it just seemed too soupy. But it tasted okay.

Great taste. I will modify the recipe next time I make it. Too much liquid--will use 1/2 the amount of liquid. Had to cook it longer than 1 hr. It needed more peaches.I will us less butter in the pan next time.Will make again.

i experimented with this and one other recipe i pulled from this website and found this one to be the ultimate peach cobbler recipe. 

what made the difference between the two recipe was the placement of the batter in the cooking pan. one called for plopping the batter over the fruit and this recipe calls for placing the batter in the pan BEFORE adding the fruit. the latter worked the best. 

my family went crazy over it. 

btw: the only thing i di different was adding mangos to sweeten it a bit.

Pretty much a disapointment.  Too soggy and the crust never formed even after over baking it.  I should have read the reviews on this one before trying it but I was in a hurry for a good peach cobbler.  My mistake I guess.  I think with a lot of alterations this recipe might turn out pretty good but I won't be trying it again.

I used your recipe for peaches we picked off from the tree, very fresh, I loved this simple recipe for the peaches melted the butter in the microwave poured in the pan and then the batter. Then we liked it so well we used apple's but next time I am going to put more milk in it than it calls for them the apples wasn't as juicy like the peaches.  The pan of peaches was all gone that same night.  I also put SPLENDA instead of sugar, no salt.  Filled the 9x13 pan full after putting the batter on the bottom.  Again the cobbler was great.

Somwhere, I missed the "Cobbler" in this recipe.  It was very much like a peach "cake" with the flour/sugar/cornstarch layer.  The canned peached lost their firmness as they baked.  I was looking for a recipe that would have more of a pastry crust with great peach flavor..and this recipe just wasn't it.  I would not make this recipe again...

It was wonderful!  Everyone loved it.  I sweared it with whiskey sauce instead of ice cream since I took it to work and though ice cream would be too sticky.  YUM!

The only reason this recipe didn't get a 5 star rating was because I used fresh peaches and was not sure of what quantity to use. The finished product was excellent but really needed a lot more peaches.

This recipe is very easy and wonderful. It was a little to watery for my taste so I added less water. Great to make anytime.

I wasn't impressed with this receipe at all.  The batter had a soggy, sticky consistency similar to bread pudding.  I prefer a crunchy oatmeal topping on my fruity cobbler.  Also, it didn't keep well in the fridge - my advice if you make this is to definately eat it right out of the oven.  It was even soggier the second day.

ABSOLUTLY DELICIOUS!!! This cobbler was amazing. The only thing i did different was cook it about 30 min longer, because the middle wasn't done. Other than that it was wonderful. I give this recipe 10 stars.

I made this the other day with huckleberries. That was not my problem. The two of us were on vacation at my family's summer cabin, and the baking powder that I used was TEN YEARS OUT OF DATE! I'm not joking. The end result was this horrible chewy flat pancake thing stuck to the bottom of the pan. It just did not work out, and it tasted awful. The baking powder's fault. Again. However, I am making this again just as soon as I can. And this time I'm going to use peaches. And good baking powder! Thanks for sharing, Jill!

This was absolutely the best peach cobbler.  My kids loved it.  I made the mistake of halving the recipe not knowing how good it was going to be.  Next time I'll make the whole recipe.  Very good thanks.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make, but I thought it was a little too sweet and mooshy.  I prefer my cobbler to be more tart, and I like their to be a difference of textures between the peach mixture and the topping.

The filling is absolutely perfect, with just the right amount of cornstarch for thickening and the right level of sweetness. Just the right amount of fruit, too, for the amount of crust. This is the peach cobbler I grew up with, and I'll definitely make it again!

GREAT RECIPE! the only thing i would change would be to cook it in a smaller pan as it needs more fruit. but that's just a matter of opinions. kids and husbands (like there's a difference) will love it.

Super easy and quick.  Everybody loves this dessert, been baking it for over 10 years, always a hit.  One thing to mention... normally it's gone within 1 day, but if you don't eat it quick, you will have mold in 3 days... EAT IT FAST!!! (which is not hard to do)  Buy a good quality ice cream and ALWAYS a hit!

Easy, but using fresh peaches would be much better. Replace fresh peaches with a  cup of sugar and lemon juice. Put all in sauce pan and stir until sugar melts

This is now my go-to recipe. I sliced 5 large, fresh, unpeeled peaches that were firm, but still full of flavor. Also,  I used 2% lactose free milk, and freshly grated nutmeg. Those were the only changes. It was delicious. I loved how there were little edges that were dark brown and chewy that enhanced the dish. The peaches were the star of the show, and it wasn't too heavy or sweet. Yum! 5 stars because it was easy and quick as well!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it should’ve been clear to only spoon peaches onto the batter wirhout the juice . It is now in the oven  and I am  upset  after following recipe to the T and  now reading previous reviews to find out I am going to have a mushy mess. A waste of time and ingredients.  My own fault though will try again maybe.

I made no changes. I did follow other reviewers advice and only spooned the peaches (and whatever liquid came within them in the spoon) over the batter like the recipe says.  But I saved the extra liquid “just in case” and glad I did. I boiled the leftover liquid to make a syrup and poured to over the finished cobbler.  I have to say this was okay at best. The flavor was good but the batter was spongey and chewy. Do not know how to change that but as far as the liquid part, I would suggest draining the peaches out of the can then mix in the butter and spices and boil it make a thicker syrup, let it cool then put the peaches back in it and pour that over the batter.

I didn't happen to read the other review's so I had added all the juices but ended up forgetting the water anyways luckily because it was a little runny but not horribly runny. I was unaware it meant to only add the peaches and not the juices when it said "to spoon". Still turned out okay, wasn't the sweetest or the best but was okay especially with ice cream on top. I did use 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 of white sugar also.

I had a friend who wanted this for his birthday so I tried it three different ways. The first time I did it I added all the juice and it was way way way too liquidy. But was perfect to put over ice cream. The second time I made it I took out all the liquid and just added the peaches and it was too dry. The third time I made it I had half the liquid triple the cake mix double the peaches. That one came out perfect.

Read the instructions carefully.  It says to spoon “peaches” not “peach mixture”.  I spooned the whole peach mixture and my dessert turned out poorly.  Otherwise, had I read more carefully I’m sure it would have been delicious.  Will attempt again though!

Fortunately I had fresh peaces instead of canned. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was amazing. One slight change is that instead of melted butter in the pan next time I will use non-stick spray.

This was a pretty good basic peach cobbler recipe for when you want peach cobbler but peaches aren't in season. I made the recipe as written using gluten free flour. In the future I would add vanilla and increase the cinnamon a bit and add more peaches.

Delicious recipe!  I used Dole Peaches, which are extra flavorful, added 1/8 more cup flour just for more substance.  I also did not add left over juice/water from peaches so it tastes like a yummy donut!

This was delicious and I will be making it again!!  I used arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch, whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose, and 5 fresh peaches instead of canned.

Made this cobbler and it was Awesome! Of course I read all the reviews...I followed the recipe almost exact, except I added 1/4 tsp of Cinnamon and nutmeg and only added about 1/2 of the juices from the peach mixture.My first peach cobbler turned out great?

Wonderful!  I used 2 cans of peaches also. & the juice instead of the water. Added 5 TBS cornstarch. Added almond extract & cloves. Used half & half instead of milk (didnt have any). Mine only had to bake 50 mins too. A must try.

This was good. A nice change for after dinner dessert. There was alot of liquid in this recipe and it made me leery so I just spooned the peaches on top of the batter mixture in the pan and then added just spoonfuls of the peach liquid then sprinkled more cinnamon all over the top. It baked up pretty good although an hour would have been way too long. We liked this with ice cream. I'll keep this for my recipe box, but will also look for other peach cobbler recipes. This was easy, but not exactly the peach cobbler I remember having.

Wish I would have read some of the reviews before trying this recipe.I agree there is way too much liquid in this recipe and makes the cobbler soggy.It tasted ok but nothing spectacular.I will not be using this recipe again.

I'm still looking for the perfect peach cobbler recipe.  I'm looking for a flakey crust on top - however this recipe is excellent.  I had to use a smaller dish so the dough would stay on top.  It is a very moist and gooey cobbler that is delicous served warm and with vanilla ice cream.  So easy to make too.

This is really good/simple with less water 1/4 cup.But it's perfect if you scale the recipe for 27 servings, and add NO water at all and keep the fruit at 29 oz.,an use brown suger instead of white, and cook 15 minutes longer.

This recipe is also great with crushed pineapple, or 3 mango's slced into chunks added to 1/2 cup apple juice.

This really is a good and easy Peach cobbler.  It looks pretty sloppy going into the oven, but firms up nicely when done.
