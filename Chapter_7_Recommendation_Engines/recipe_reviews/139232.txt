I added a tad of whole wheat flour to my batch, and they came out beautifully! The only suggestion I would make is to wait to dust the semlor with powdered sugar until RIGHT BEFORE you serve them. I dusted mine, stuck them in the fridge for a few hours, and the sugar disappeared as condensation from being chilled appeared. I should know better, but they just looked so cute!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I grew up eating semlor at Easter, and this year tried it myself.  My first attempt was a flop - the traditional Swedish cookbook called for four packets of yeast, and gave vague instructions like add "most" of the flour and "work" the dough.  I came to All Recipes in desperation, found this, and followed it precisely.  The semlor couldn't have come out more perfect.  Tack sa mycket!

Giving this recipe only 4 and not 5 stars due to the fact that authentic 'semlas' have almond paste instead of marizpan in the middle..... Yummy!

I wanted to like this recipe.  I lived in Sweden for a few years and love semlor, but this isn't how I remember them.  I don't know how much of that was my own fault.
The bun tasted right, but was too dense and chewy.
The filling was too diluted by the bread.  The mandel massa flavor was lost.  I added almond extract and sugar to try to restore some of the flavor, but it still tasted too much like soggy bread.
I will compare this with other semlor recipes and try again with some tweaks.  It didn't quite scratch my semlor itch.

Thank you! I made this with my half Swedish boyfriend who remembered his grandmother making these. Easy to follow recipe - adjusting the marzipan mix to taste so lots of marzipan (according to the consultant) grating it first helped followed by electric mixer. We thoroughly enjoyed them:)

Excellent recipe. I've never had Semla, so I can't say whether or not these are authentic, but they sure are good! Only one problem- 375 was too hot! My buns started to get too brown on the bottom at around 10 minutes - before they were golden on the outside or cooked all the way through!

A very good recipe. I made them for my dad as a surprise (he had them all the time as a kid), I was able to use almond paste instead of marzipan (he agreed with a previous poster about it being more authentic), when he bit into it he said "It's a semla!" (I guess he didn't have much faith,) it turned out perfect. WARNING: Only eat one at a time, they are pretty filling.

My grandmother, whose Swedish, loved them.  I certainly did too and it was a great experience discovering a part of the Swedish culture, since I do have that ancestry.  The bread itself is amazing and I might make it plain and eat it the way they do in Sweden, with warmed milk in a bowl.  These Semlor are definitely a keeper in my book.  I dashed mine with both powdered sugar and some cinnamon.

These were great! I grew up in Sweden and have not had a semla in  over 15 years. My whole family loved them. Thanks so much. I love to share the Swedish customs with my kids and husband.

I make this receipe every year for Easter now.  My family loves them.  I suggest making the buns small.  Excellent though, the Swedes make them for Easter I think, that is where I first had them.

Good and easier to make than you would expect.  The marzipan is drowned out by the whipping cream, so I recommend you take this into account when deciding on the ratio of marzipan mix to whipping cream when filling the buns.
