This was surprisingly GREAT!  I guess I say that, because I have had similar ham and potato dishes before, that all kind of came out tasting more or less the same.   But the Red Curry Paste really makes this one stand out with a flavor that is memorable!  I will definitely prepare it again.  Give the recipe a try and you too might be pleasantly surprised.
