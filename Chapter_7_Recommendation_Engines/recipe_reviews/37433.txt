Really good. But i suggest everyone do what i did. I seasoned the flour for the chicken with onion powder,garlic powder,dried parsley and curry the second time i made it and it had ALOT more flavor. Overall very good.

This was delicous! There wasn't enough sauce, so we doubled the portions of it. More curry powder, in my opinion, would make this even better. Chicken breasts work great too!5 stars all the way! I recomend this as a family treat everyone will love.

This was so easy and ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL I didn't think it would taste this great!!!! The simplicity doesn't say anything about the flavor...this was one of the best baked chicken dishes I've ever made!! So tender and the apples with the curry was just so succulent!! My DH was so impressed!!!! So was I!!! And to think the recipe came from the Kraft Kitchens just blows my mind! Thanks so much Kraft! You gotta try this!!!

My family loved this, we do not like coconut so I omitted it and added a bit of fresh ginger to the sauce. We have had it twice now and a repeat appearance is already requested.

mmmmm...this was yummy! I ommitted the coconut and added more curry powder and bit of red pepper. I also followed other reviews and doubled the sauce. I then served it over basmati rice. It was excellent! I will definitely be making this again soon!

A mouth-watering surprise.  I made this to Wolfgang last night and he loved it.  As I mentioned before, he is VERY picky so when I mentioned that I was cooking something with coconut, apples and chicken his face construed into his horrendous puke face.  I went through with the recipe precisely as specified.  After removing the chicken from the oven, I left it on for fear that we would need the warm oven to warm up a frozen pizza for dinner instead.  Wolfgang took the first bite and his puke face transformed into a BIG GRIN!  “THIS IS SOOOO DELICIOUS,” he said.  I would recommend that anyone who makes this dish follow the directions and you will not be disappointed.

This was really superb! I didn't have an apple, so I subbed a pear and it was really good. I love how the coconut atop the chicken gets a little crispy. The sauce tastes wonderful, the chicken is soft and juicy, and over all its a great dinner. I served over jasmine rice. I will make this all the time now.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe! However, I changed a few things to suit my taste. I used chicken breast pieces, no apples and I doubled all the ingredients mentioned in step 3 to make it more saucy. This way I can serve it with rice and it won't be too dry. Overall, DELICIOUS!

This was good, although we've had better curry chicken.  I don't like apples or coconut in our meat dishes, so I omitted that and just doubled the sauce like everyone recommended.  I also took another viewers advice and seasoned the flour with curry, onion salt and garlic powder.  Was good over jasmine rice and broccoli.

This recipe is a winner for me! I love anything with curry and coconut. This is reminiscent of a Thai dish, and is great over hot jasmine rice. Try doubling the sauce mix since it doesn't seem to be enough.

My husband loved this recipe.  I agree with everyone about the doubling almost tripling the recipe to have enough sauce to cover the rice.

The chicken with coconut on it was good, but the sauce didn't have much flavor.  I doubled the sauce, but my husband and I weren't crazy about it, even over basamati rice.

WOW! This was just great! I made a double sauce recipe and put half over chicken for my husband, and half over tofu for me. I added a ton of veges when I put them in to bake and didn't even serve it over rice. It was spectacular!

I thought the sauce came out excellent!  I used chicken breasts instead of the pieces since my family prefers breast meat.  I'd recommend doubling the sauce because it tastes great over rice.  I'll be making this again, that's for sure.

Yummy!  Very good curry.  I just sprinkled coconut at the end instead of adding one cup.  I also added more seasoning  to spice it up and 1/2 sliced hot pepper.  Recipe was fast and easy to make.  I will make this again!

Wow!  This is almost a weekly meal for us.  We omit the coconut.  The kids love it, and my hubby inhales it.  I double the sause because it matures over night in the fridge so make lots of rice and mix all the left over sause in with the rice and any chicken you can find (You won't find much! :) )Than stick it in the fridge.  Warning!:  The family will fight over the leftovers the next day!  Great Recipe!

oh my god, this was delicious. i dont even like curry, but my boyfriend does - we both loved it. i paid attention to other reviews that said it was a bit bland. instead of red chile flakes, i cut up fresh red chili peppers and used extra curry powder in the sauce. as recommended, i used onion powder, garlic powder, dried parsley to season the flour- it turned out hot, hot hot and GOOD. i doubled the sauce recipe, and didnt use any cocunut besides the couple of tablespoons in the sauce. over basmati rice, it was yum yum yum.

My family really liked this recipe, since we are fans of Indian food and curry spice.  I removed the skin to make this dish lower fat.  Still used flour to help the chicken soak up the curry sauce.  I used raisins, for sweetness, as suggested by other reviewers - it's much easier to prepare and measure than cutting up apples.

Very Bummed about this recipe.  It was easy to make and it looked good, yet it lacked a whole lot of flavor.  Would NOT make this again.

Our family thought this recipe was only average. My husband and I thought there was too much coconut. Otherwise the flavor was decent. I don't know what I did wrong;I didn't end up with much sauce.

I skipped on the coconut, added 2 cups carrots,  2 cups raisins, doubled on all the ingredients. It came out great. I liked the Tyson recipe better but this was good for a first try.

For years, my favorite meal was turkey courdon bleu.  This simply blew it away!  I'll be back for more recipes!
