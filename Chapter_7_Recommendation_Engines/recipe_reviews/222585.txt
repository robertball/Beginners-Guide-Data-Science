We loved this (even my veggie-finnickey husband) but I only gave it 4 stars because I believe without the additions I made it wouldn't have been the 5 star dish it turned out to be. I diced up 1 medium onion and 1 red bell pepper and sauteed those with the zucchini and garlic. After sauteing, I added them to the greased dish where I placed a half jar of marinated artichoke hearts in a sparse layer on top (I will use the whole jar next time..they were tasty!). I followed the recipe to a "t" other than that and it turned out great! It really creates its own side, and with all the veggies and the use of olive oil (and I used lite salt) it made for a healthy AND delicious meal!

Wonderful dish with ingredients I often have on hand anyway.  As another commenter mentioned, you can add other vegetables and tweak to your preferences.

Worked great as a last minute meal.  A few changes to make it work with what I had on hand.  Limited time so did everything in my black skillet, seasoning everything with Montery Chicken seasoning and grated parmesan cheese as I went: Cut up the chicken in bite-size pieces, stir fired it in oil and garlic without flouring (I'm going low carbs). Removed from pan then carmelized the onions in more oil and garlic. Added zucchini, browned, added a red bell pepper.  Added back the chicken and then cherry tomatoes, warming and serving.

Baked Chicken & Zucchini Haiku: "Woah man, mind was blown! Made for just myself at lunch, wish that I had more!" Seemed like an elaborate meal for me to make just for myself for lunch but I had 1 small zucchini, 1 chicken breast, and everything else in the ingredient list (minus fresh basil, so I had to use dried; boooo!) and really just wanted something other than my usual salad or sandwich. This recipe did not disappoint, and since having scarfed my single lunch of it down, I've made it w/ the same amount of success for my family, and we've only found that it (namely the veggies) need a little S&P.

This was a wonderful dish and, with a side of fried potatoes, made a filling meal that was easy, delicious, and used up some of the surplus of vegetables we had on hand. Even my young sister loved the meal and scarfed up everything on her plate. We're already planning on making this dish again.

A five star recipe with NO additions!  The number one reviewer of this recipe posts a COMPLETELY different dish.  I am guilty of changing up a recipe to my owns tastes as well and like to read what others have done...but this was great exactly as written. Don't cut the zucchini too thin and use plenty of them. Thank you!

This recipe is unbelievably delicious!!  I only needed 2 large zucchini along with 4 chicken breasts.  I also added a sliced yellow and, pepper and diced onion when sautéing the zucchini.  I added just a bit of dry white wine to the oil b/c the heat was a little high and garlic began to brown too quickly.   I would have never guessed that veggies alone could create such a fantastic sauce.   The fresh basil really adds to the flavor.  Served over pasta and everyone had seconds and thirds!!  New favorite summer recipe!!

My husband loved it. I liked it okay. Did not bread chicken (gluten free). Next time I won't saute the zucchini, it came out a little mushy.

I usually skip breading altogether so next time, I won't bread the chicken (used thighs), but it was very good. Used a can of diced tomatoes (didnt have fresh), added mushrooms and red onion (didn't have enough zucchini), sprinkled crushed red peppers and some more salt and pepper on the veggies.  If you don't add a little salt and pepper to the veggies, it might be a bit bland and I loathe bland veggies. Realized I only had about 1/2 cup of mozzarella but it worked out fine.  Loved the flavor.

Used my cast iron pan to cook and bake in, just remove chicken to a plate while sauteing the vegetables and then adding back. I did add in onions, mushrooms, more garlic and herbs for flavor. Topping tomatoes with fresh basil. I only used 3 zucchini and made zoodles instead of slicing, just mixed them into the sauteed onions, mushrooms and didn't really pre-cook, just warmed them up. Layered in the cast iron as directed, covered with foil and baked 25 minutes at 360° over in-direct heat on the gas grill. Delicious all in one pan meal, we all loved it.

I just made this recipe and it's delicious. I made a few changes; I sautéed onions and added yellow squash as other reviews suggested. I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese over the squash when it calls for dusting with bread crumbs. I think he parmesan added a lot of flavor. I also added italian seasoning on top of the chicken once it was browned.

I used panko bread crumbs and fresh vegetables and basil from my late July garden.  I made it exactly as specified, and it was really delicious.  The chicken was moist, the zucchini properly cooked, and the dish was loved by my family.  I bet it is pretty low cal, too!  I will definitely make this lovely recipe again.

The first day it was amazing, however it did not transfer well to become a leftover.  The flavors changed.  I will just make what I need for the day of in the future.

This recipe is delicious. I changed it up a bit due to my own preferences and the fact that I forgot to buy an ingredient at the store. What I did was use three extra large chicken breasts and trimmed them down into smaller pieces. I used two extra large zucchini (from a neighbor's garden) and two small store bought ones along with six roma tomatoes. I sliced the zucchini in thick slices (roughly 1/3 of an inch or so) and the tomatoes I sliced to about 1/4 an inch.. I increased the garlic to roughly two/three tablespoons and increased the basil to about 1/4 cup. I salt and peppered the chicken on both sides thoroughly and did not dip them into any egg or water, rather dipped them in flour seasoned with Italian seasoning. I followed the recipe from there. Greased two 13x9 pans with olive oil and split the food between them and topped with a full package of pre-shredded mozzarella, roughly a cup I believe. Came out to be absolutely delicious this way.

Excellent recipe!  Very tasty and simple to make.  I used only 2 zucchini and 1 tomato because that is what I had.  Also cut back on the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and it was plenty and I had less to throw out.  Will be making this again and it will be added to my favorites.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing a really good recipe.

Easy, fast, delicious, healthy, inexpensive! I might add a sprinkling of salt to the zucchini next time, but maybe not. The only down side is that my 3 and 5 year old sons needed some convincing to eat the veggies. Ah, well. Not every recipe caters to that crowd. :) Thank you for the recipe!!

Excellent as-is. I guesstimated the breadcrumbs - just used enough to coat the chicken. Very good lower-carb dinner. Will definitely make again.

As written, this was pretty good.  There are a couple of changes that I'll make for next time.  First, I'd leave off the 2 tbsp. of breadcrumbs that you sprinkle on the zucchini.  It just made it mushy.  Also, it doesn't state this, but when you transfer the zucchini to the baking dish from the skillet, DRAIN IT.  I dumped it all in, and it got way to watery and mushy.  Otherwise, the dish had a good flavor.  I used Italian bread crumbs, because it was all I had on hand, I recommend it, and I will either do that again with a little extra basil thrown in, or I may try with Panko.  This recipe is definitely worth a try, but you just may need to tweak it a little to your tastes.

I have used this recipe more than once but it’s bland.  I’d recommend seasoning everything as you go and adding the red pepper, basil, oregano, pepper, garlic...  Italian seasoning!  Add parmesean or Asiago to give it some cup

I really liked this recipe. It's awesome for a lighter meal. My husband and my kids loved it. I only baked it for about 12 minutes though and cooked the chicken in the pan a little longer. I will definitely be putting this on our regular menu!

What a great recipe for garden fresh zukes & tomatoes!  I used panko on my chicken because that's all I had.  The chicken turned out perfectly cooked, nice and moist.  I doubled the garlic and added salt to the zucchini when stir frying it. Also, I subbed Monterey Jack for the mozzarella.  I  was low on ingredients at home and this recipe stood up to all my alterations!  Thank you, Luaucow!

This was okay, except my zucchini ended up being mushy even without sauteing it beforehand, and I had to add extra cheese and a little Italian dressing to make it more flavorful. I'll only make it again if I have leftover zucchini, not worth deliberately buying zucchini for.

Was looking for a recipe to use zucchini, tomatoes and basil from my garden and this is absolutely delicious.  I only had Progresso Italian bread crumbs on hand and will definitely be using them rather than plain bread crumbs. Will be making this one a lot over the summer.

Loved this!!! So delicious, my parents and husband and I thought it was delightful I made a little substitution and used some feta cheese crumbles instead of all mozzarella. But I still used the mozzarella on the top.

Just made this recipe tonight!  After reading reviews, I did add onions when I sautéed the zucchini, and I added marinated artichokes as one review suggested.  One suggestion I have is to use a good olive oil infused with flavor.  I combined garlic olive oil and Tuscan herb, both purchased in an olive oil store in Blue Ridge, Georgia while on vacation.  Other than those changes, I used sea salt, ground pepper, and ground Italian herb seasonings, and I used Italian bread crumbs.    I didn't measure any of those though.  I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and a bottle of wine.  I will definitely add this recipe to my collection.  My husband loved it too :).   I would give the base recipe idea 4 stars but a 5 with the changes.

My family loves this recipe so much that I shared it with my mother, who also likes it a lot. It's super easy to make.  However it does take some time to prep so with little children in the house it does take me longer than the 20 minutes. I started cutting the zucchini, tomatoes and garlic earlier as well as separating the bread crumbs and oil out well before I plan on cooking. Makes it a lot easier with a toddler hanging off my leg! 

I do have to say that I typically use only 3 zucchinis versus the 5 the recipe calls for. I also use an entire bag (8 oz) of shredded Mozzarella and a little more basil than what is called for. Occasionally I use 6 smaller chicken breasts instead of the 4 halves and it works out with the same amount of ingredients. 
Overall this is a great dish, feeds everyone and we never have leftovers! Highly recommend it!!!

Very good dish! I used fresh mozzarella instead of shredded, but I think it would have been good either way. Will definitely make this again.

I didn't change anything this time and my family liked it. Even my daughter who is quite picky. Next time I am going to try lemon juice or lime juice with the zucchini for a little acidic flavor.

I made this last night and thought it was ok.  Flavor was kind of bland.  I think the idea of adding some onion and maybe yellow pepper to the zucchini is a good one. I also think this might be better using tilapia or flounder.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to use some zucchini and found this.  Made it pretty much exactly as printed, with the exception of method. . .Why cook the chicken first if it goes on top of the veggies?  I did a light saute of the zucchini and garlic (also tossed in a bit of onion) and then put them on the bottom of my baking dish.  Then I browned the chicken breasts (using panko breadcrumbs) and continued with the instructions.  Used Italian blend shredded cheese.  Great, light meal!  Thanks.

I made it pretty much as stated except I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of sliced tomatoes and used both zucchini and yellow squash. Oh, and I also added a few mushrooms. Just a few minor changes, lol. It was delicious. I paired it with thin pasta noodles that I tossed with butter and garlic.

Great starter recipe.   Had to add more veggies to suit our taste. 
Preheat oven to 400F. 
II peeled and chopped potatoes, placed into the baking pan, sprinkled with olive oil and garlic salt.  Baked for 20 mins. 
In the meantime, I prepared chicken as per recipe in the frying pan.  I then threw in into the same pan zucchinis and red peppers. After they softened up I placed them in the middle of the pan with potatoes, placed chicken on top - covered with tomatoes and sprinkled with cheese. 25 more mins in the oven and voila!

We really enjoyed this dish. I changed it up a bit though. I used 3 zucchinis, one tomato (my boyfriend doesn't love them), half an onion and bone-in chicken. I salted and peppered the veggies, adding crushed red pepper over the whole dish. I also substituted with sliced pepper jack cheese. I cooked the whole shebang in a cast iron skillet which meant only one dish to wash! The results were fantastic, but since I changed it up so much I gave it 4 stars.

I made this receipe last night and must I say it was a tasty, refreshing dish. My husband loved it! The only thing is my crust didn't come out as crunchy as I would have liked. I think next time I'll take the foil off a bit before it's done to crisp it up a bit. Delicious!!

I don't usually try a new dish out on company, but folks dropped in while I was making this dish. "We want to eat" they said when they saw the prep for this meal. Luckily, the recipe does serve 4.  
My changes: I seasoned the chicken with salt, garlic, pepper, and peeled the tomatoes by placing them in boiling water for 30 seconds, then into an ice bath before peeling and slicing. I did this so the skin wouldn't peel and string after the dish was cooked. I had NO leftovers (I had been hoping for some for lunch the next day!) and everyone raved how fresh and delicious the meal was.

This was delicious! The only thing extra that I added was Parmesan cheese for added flavor in with the chicken & vegetables. I also used a can of stewed tomatoes as that is what I had on hand. I put all the Mozzarella cheese on in the last 10 minutes of baking. Superb!

Excellent easy weeknight dinner! I used seasoned bread crumbs, and double dipped the chicken in the egg and bread crumbs.  I have made this dish twice and loved it both times. The flavors come together nicely, and is pretty healthy!

This is an very easy dish to make. I recommend a deep dish casserole pan because this does make a lot of food. The only thing that is time consuming is cutting the vegetables. I have made this a few times and every time it's a hit.

This was delicious!  I added one sliced yellow squash, sliced baby bella mushrooms and sliced onions. I also used whole wheat panko bread crumbs and the chicken was nice and crunchy. I seasoned the crumb mixture with seasoned salt and Italian seasoning. I would definitely make this again.

Very easy.  I added additional seasonings to suit my personal taste buds.  Served with basmati rice.
Update:  second time around I added a diced shallot and half a red pepper to the zucchini and even more seasonings with a little thicker tomato slices.  I also used a yogurt/cucumber (tzatziki)i dip smeared on the chicken breasts before shaking them in the bread crumbs.  You use what is available in your refrigerator and pantry!  I think it may have resulted in preventing the chicken breasts from drying out.

We loved it! A perfect dish for using our garden vegetables in. I did no sauté the squash first, instead I used spray oil and seasoned with a little sea salt and placed them directly in the pan layering with tomatoes. I cooked the dish for 45 minutes since the zucchini was still raw. Even my kids enjoyed this

I made changes with mine because is use what I have fresh in my garden when possible. With the egg/water mixture, I only use 1 medium size duck egg. My bread crumbs were a mixture of panko, garlic powder, season salt, pepper and paprika. For my vegetables I used summer squash, cherry tomatoes and added mushrooms. I used Romano shredded cheese on top of the mushrooms.

Loved this! I added a few additional favorite veggies and  1/2 tsp Italian seasoning; I eliminated the bread  crumbs and reduced the cheese to 2/3 cup. Next time I may skip sautéing the vegetables so that they'll be crisp-tender out of the oven. Served with a wild rice blend, will definitely make this again

You can cut the zucchinis down to 3 and tomatoes down to 2 and that will give you enough for the dish. At least what I thought to be normal sized. 

I am not a great cook, so when a recipe says to sauté the zucchini for only about 2 minutes, I followed. However, if you like you zucchini to be fully cooked, sauté and cover for a bit longer. At least 5-7 minutes.   

This dish could be much greater with more seasoning. It calls for breadcrumbs. I recommend purchasing seasoned breadcrumbs, and even adding more seasoning to taste.

Turned out great! This is a fairly healthy and delicious meal. Husband loved it. I reversed the stovetop cooking order and began with the veggies first- then the chicken- to ensure the chicken got right into the oven. Also added some white wine when sautéing the vegetables. I used two medium zucchini, one squash, one yellow onion, a clove of garlic minced, and three chicken breast. Turned out perfect! Great summer recipe!

This was fantastic! I cut the zucchini on the bias, and very chunky. Next time I might not pre-cook the zucchini because it came out a little over-done.

The chicken was bland to me. But I did like the taste of the zucchini and tomatoes with the basil. It could use a little salt on the zucchini and more fresh basil, but it was GOOD. I will be making that as a side dish from now on, and cook a chicken dish separately.

I used fresh zucchini from my garden. Wish the tomatoes were ready in my garden too because that would have been heaven!  The only addition I made was a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on the tomato layer and again on top of the chicken layer. My family and I had it one night and again the next day for lunch. It was amazing! I will make it again!

Oh my yumminess! I added mushrooms and onions and only sautéed them (along with the zucchini) about  half way cooked. I added extra garlic and didn't mind the dried basil I had.  I used beef steak tomatoes and cut them thick.  I also used an oven bag verses tinfoil and it really made the chicken tender and moist.  I didn't have an egg to bread the chicken so I substituted a marinade I made out of Dijon mustard, mayo, tiny bit of milk and water,  and some sweet bbq sauce.  I topped everything I baked on angel hair pasta tossed in oil olive, garlic salt and dried basil. This is my new favorite meal!

Good semi healthy recipe for a week night. I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular, which I think added more of a crispy texture. Also, I only added about a 1/3 cup cheese as I wanted to limit the fat, and it still tasted great

This was a good recipe. I feel that the breadcrumbs made it a little heavier than it needed to be since it already has the cheese on it. I think the next time I will omit them.

First of all- the recipe as it is is wonderful. I always make an effort to have at hand what the recipe calls for so I can judge it as it is created. However- I also read the reviews of others before I make it, and with a few grains of salt ( ha!) I may change what others think is worth changing. I have worked in the food business, so I know my way around the kitchen. First of all, prep time will be longer than than 20 minutes. Just the mise-en-place  will take the average cook 20 minutes. Slice the zucchini, tomato, garlic. Chop the basil. Pound out the chicken breasts( which I did and most always do to ensure even cooking), grease the 9x12, and set out the egg wash and bread crumbs. That there is a good 20 minutes, and if you remembered to turn on the sauté pan and put the oil in it, if you start to cook out the chicken as soon as you are done with prep, that will take about another 10 to 20 minutes. Then sauté the zucchini and thats another 10 minutes. See? more than 20 minutes of prep……BUT WORTH IT!!! Now, small "improvements" to original. Do add the onions as other say. double or triple the amount of garlic if you like garlic, and towards the end of the sauté, deglaze the pan a bit with a few glugs of dry white wine. I used Pinot Grigio. Double the Basil, and use seasoned Panko for all. You will not ever regret making this dish, especially the 100th time!

Oh my! What an easy and delicious recipe. Will be making it again. I only used two chicken breasts (2 of us) and cut them into thinner cutlets making about five or six thin cutlets. Did everything else, used two medium zucchini instead of four and two tomatoes, fresh basil..do not cut zuccine too thin (responding to mushy comment) or use the tiny ones.it was outrageous and NOT dried out even though I made cutlets thinner.  What amazing flavor considering so few spices. We absolutely loved it. Leftovers were great, held up like eggplant parm..delicious cold, too!

I found this while looking for an easy recipe to use the last of my zucchini. The recipe was quick and simple with a good tasting end result. I didn't have basil on hand so I just used a bit of generic italian seasoning and it still turned out well. My husband really loved it!

Yummy.  I planned to make something else but when I took the eggplant out of the refrigerator, it was spoiled. So I took stock of what I had-chicken and zucchini and typed it in and this recipe came up.  It was pretty easy. My husband really liked it and so did I.  
I just saved it in my recipe book.  Thanks, Luaucow!

I made this last night and it was  delicious!  I did add some onions to the zucchini mixture like others recommended, and would have liked peppers too but didn't have any on hand.  My picky kids wouldn't eat this and that is why I only gave it 4 stars.  My son ate some of the  chicken, but my daughter only took one or two bites.  The whole family must like it to get five stars!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. I think you could chose to not precook the zucchini and it would turn out just as good. A great guilt-free recipe for a one-dish meal!

1+ zucchini per serving is a lot of zucchini, so I reduced it. I also added onion, and I think both changes worked well.  I've made something similar in the past which had more black pepper in the breading, which I liked, so I will incorporate more next time.

This recipe is very delicious & easy. I made minor changes. I added onion & used Roma cherry tomatoes cut in half.  I also added a little more seasonings.  The family really enjoyed it.  It is very versatile and you could pretty add whatever veggies you like.  Thanks for the recipe! It’s stating in the rotation!

This recipe is awesome! My husband kept saying over and over as he ate that he loved it! I made using a can of fire roasted tomatoes to replace fresh, cut up a red and a yellow bell pepper and small white onion. I sauteed these before the zucchini was sauteed. I also added more mozza, enough to cover all. Thanks for the recipe!! Yum!

I needed to use tomatoes and Summer squash because we have a bumper crop this year.  I also used Italian bread crumbs and tomato and basil feta cheese crumbles. We liked the Mediterranean flavors and enjoyed the dish very much.

It took longer than 25 minutes to reach the 165 degrees however.

I made this for my husband and I.  It was quick easy and so delicious.  We used our garden zucchini and tomatoes.  It was out of this world.  Next time I am going to add some garden peppers and some onions.  It will be so delicious.  I can't wait!!

Great recipe. Grandchildren and my husband loved it! I did add sliced peppers and onions to the veggies. Have also taken it out of oven when done, spooned some jarred pasta sauce over chicken then added reserved mozzarella cheese. This version got rave reviews from the family.

This dish is so good! I have made it several times, and the only changes we make are salt on the veggies, more fresh basil, and Italian style breadcrumbs. (I usually have Italian style breadcrumbs on hand, so I don’t think I have ever made it with regular. I do not find that sautéing the zucchini for a couple of minutes makes it too mushy, as some of the other reviewers have said.) Yum!

Great recipe! I added the onion with zucchini as suggested; added fresh chopped parsley sprinkled over the last application of cheese.
Very delicious, and even greater with fresh vegetables.

Love this! Only change made was in seasonings. I seasoned flour with a garlic sea salt blend along with some red pepper. Dipped chicken in flour, egg and a Panko bread crumb mix. We love the vegetables so I always add extra. Served with a cauliflower rice.

Absolutely amazing!! Being a first time mother and new cook it was a little more time consuming and hard for me personally, but I also have a baby who just learned to walk and a new puppy ?? My family is obsessed, I wouldn’t make one change it’s perfect!

My husband and I loved this dish. I needed to add another 10 minutes to get my chicken done so I left off the foil to get everything a little browned. We then added some shredded Parmesan on our servings. I don’t like tomatoes but I ate every single one in my serving. Delish and it’s definitely a keeper.

Oh it’s so good! I have been making this off and on for a couple years. My kids don’t care for it, because they don’t like anything that’s good. They’re kids, so I’ll let it slide. That’s also why I don’t make it more often: I don’t want to hear the complaints and I refuse to cook a separate meal for the kids. My husband and I both really enjoy it, so we make it on the rare nights the kids are away. This last time I was lazy and skipped the egg wash and didn’t miss it, the bread crumbs stuck beautifully to the chicken and I didn’t waste most of an egg. I also cut the zucchini in slices 1 inch or thicker  because any thinner and it gets all mushy and gross. (The same reason why I’ve NEVER cooked it before putting it in the oven. I like veggies with a little crunch and consistency. Cooking first makes it disintegrate) otherwise I follow the recipe exactly and I’m always surprised at how much flavor it has with next to no spices.

I made this straight up per the recipe. It turned out excellent! A few things to keep in mind.  I ended up with way more vegetables than I was expecting. No problem though as the leftovers go great with other meals. 

I cooked everything in the oven using a lasagna pan. Between this and the extra vegetables cooking time took significantly longer than expected. I used a meat thermometer to get it right. The chicken turned out way more tender than I was expecting.

The whole meal was excellent and I highly recommend it any time of year.

It's a solid start but needs more flavour. For my next time through this recipe, I'll add oregano and use more basil, and pepper. Nice presentation but the zucchini is still a hard sell in my household.

Husband and 11 yr old went back for seconds! I only had panko and cherry tomatoes, but kiddo even wanted more tomatoes. I added artichoke hearts in a corner just for me- will prob season them more next time but yum. Baked at 400 for 25 min with foil but needed another 20 min without for me to feel chicken done enough. Thanks for a yummy recipe with stuff I always have on hand!

OMG--we LOVED this recipe!  After reading some of the reviews I also was skeptical that these simple ingredients would amount to a flavorful meal but, boy, was this good!  I had one huge chicken breast that I cut into 4 larger pieces which I breaded per the recipe.  I probably added a bit more bread crumbs to the whole pan since I didn't want to waste them.  I also fried up the remaining egg mix and added that to the casserole pan.  The fresh tomato and zucchini with the cheese and breadcrumbs was divine after roasting.  I did end up having the dish in the oven for a bit longer than the recipe stated since the thicker piece of chicken breast took longer to reach the 165 F per my  thermometer.  Will definitely make this again!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this! I followed the recipe, except I used dried basil and I didn’t sauté the zucchini. We like our veggies crunchy so I tossed them in the breadcrumbs, olive oil, salt and pepper, and minced garlic and then put them straight on the baking sheet. The chicken was so moist and tasty! I topped it with Swiss cheese instead of more mozzarella because I accidentally bought sliced mozzarella and I couldn’t shred it. I put 3 slices under each chicken breast, but I didn’t want to put more on top and I had sliced Swiss in the fridge. Served it with rice fresh out of the rice cooker. Definitely going to make again!

Made this for dinner last night. My husband and I really liked it a lot. It did take longer to bake than suggested, but it could have been my oven. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did my chicken with gluten-free bread crumbs.
I think next time, I will cut the chicken up into bite-size pieces then bread them. We will be making this while the farm stands are selling their fresh veggies. Thank you for sharing!

Good dinner.  Made as directed and the whole family liked it.  Took a bit longer to cook because chicken breasts were thick, glad I cut veggies thick as they were perfect when meat was done.  I would like a little more flavor in the zucchini so will play around with some herbs next time I make it.

I did half a recipe and used panko bread crumbs. I will make this again, but have the following suggestions because my zucchini was more done than I like and the cheese on top was less done. 1. Slice the zucchini in thick slices—1/2”. 2. If your chicken is thick, pound it so that it will cook quicker and keep the zucchini al dente. 3. Put the chicken under the broiler after you add the cheese at the end so it melts and browns. 4. Use cherry or grape tomatoes rather than the bland grocery store regular tomatoes.

I followed the recipe, I did cut in half  for two people and I used canned diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes.  I served over rice.  (I could have used a little more liquid.  Maybe next  time I will add a quarter cup more liquid.)

This meal is SOOOO delicious!  It really deserves at least ten stars and it is most definitely going to be made frequently around here.  Even our four Afghans teenage refugees, INHALED this.  My husband remarked, "I've never had fish that tastes like this."  I replied, "That's because it is chicken."  Grin.  But he made the comment because the meat was so tender and juicy.  I am an American woman living in a small town (population 6000) in Sweden with my Swedish husband.  This means that I have to "do it myself' when it comes to seasoned bread crumbs.  Last evening I used Panko bread crumbs and blended them with garlic powder, rosemary, oregano and a generous amount of sage and I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because that it what I had.  Plus, because my youths were "desperately" hungry and clamoring for dinner, I shortened the preparations by omitting the egg wash and shaking the individual chicken pieces in the bread crumbs.  Instead I shook approximately half of the bread crumbs over the tomato layer and used more mozzarella than called for (personal preference) and then shook the rest of the bread crumbs over the chicken before covering it with another generous helping of mozzarella.  As I said, this meal was pure delight.  "Sadly" there were no left-overs!!

I will make this again. Good use for extra zucchini and tomatoes. I used less zucchini and tomatoes because I only used 2 chicken breasts. Pretty easy to make. Thanks.

I f I could give this more stars, I would!!!  It was fantastic!

Go light on the oil as the juices from the chicken seep through the zucchini as it bakes.

I didn't add the basil, but served it as a garnish.

Made according to the recipe but follow the advice of others and simply added an onion and red pepper to the zucchini. This dish was amazing. I thought the chicken will be dry but quite the contrary. It was very moist and so flavorful.

This was a very easy and tasty meal.  With  only a few ingredients, shopping was fast and prepping was quick.  I was worried it might be dry, but the tomatoes kept everything super moist!  My husband and loved this dish and I will definitely be making it again!!

It was ok. Kind of bland and would've preferred to put the veggies in half way through the baking process so that the veggies wouldn't be soft.

This chicken dish is amazing!!! Would most definately make again. I was light on the tomatoes but would add more the next time. I also added more seasoning to the chicken while it was in the skillet cooking. I added garlic salt and Italian seasoning.

My family of 4 likes plain cheese pizza on Fridays (no meat or veggie topping), so I'm always looking for a simple but complementary  'side' dish to add more nutrition.  This was perfect!!  I used 1 lb of chicken and three fat 8 inch zucchinis. Seasoned chicken with Mrs. Dash (salt free) before breading. Used unseasoned panko  bread crumbs (Stayed crispy!!) Used olive oil to brown chicken.   Hand sliced the zucchini rather than use mandolin slicer, so that the zucchini slices were thicker than usual. (~1/4 inch).    Added diced medium onion to the sliced zucchini and 2 cloves of garlic. I sauteed the veggies in unsalted butter instead of oil.    Instead of mozzarella, used Reduced Fat 4 Cheese Italian. Used less cheese-- sprinkled the cheese on top of the tomatoes but skipped topping the chicken with cheese.  Used dried basil, and skipped the bread crumbs on the zucchini, too.  My family really enjoyed this dish.   I was surprised how flavorful it was.  It truly was tasty.  So for those of you who completed this meal  with spaghetti or potatoes, might I suggest a cheese pizza instead, lol !!

I followed the recipe but added a couple goodies.  Included some red onion and mushroom slices on top of the tomatoes and again over the chicken.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  Other than omitting the garlic due to an allergy, I don't make any changes to it and  it is delicious.  I serve it on a bed of rice, though I suspect it would be good on angel hair pasta as well.

I'd give this ten stars!  I  pounded chicken breasts to about 3/4" thickness. As suggested by other reviewers, I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion and increased the garlic by a couple cloves. Also added about 1/4 cup parm to the veges after placing the tomatoes in the baking dish.  I added about a half teaspoon of Paula Deen house seasoning (to which I add onion powder in equal proportion to the garlic powder) over the vegetables and tomatoes. I'll be making this again soon!  Update: This was very good leftover!

Delicious. I might add a lot more basil next time. I'd also reduce the zucchini to 2 or 3. I used 4 and I have way too much zucchini and I love vegetables. I also only used 2 tomatoes.

This was fantastic.  My husband used words like awesome, delicious and spectacular.  I did use Italian bread crumbs rather than plain, as that is what I had on hand.  I also topped the zucchini and tomatoes with a blend of shredded Italian cheeses (Romano , Parmesan, Mozzarella, Asiago and Provolone) then, the last few minutes, topped the chicken with fresh mozzarella.  I used fresh zucchini, tomatoes and basil from my garden and, as we like our veggies to still have crunch, I did not sauté the zucchini but, rather, cut them in rounds about a third inch thick and the tomatoes about a quarter inch thick.  After browning the chicken breast medallions that I cut out of the chicken breasts, I put a piece of chicken on each stack of zucchini and tomato and then baked at 400 for about 35 minutes and it was perfect - still firm zucchini and moist chicken.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  My husband was still raving about it the next day.

Really yummy! If I make it again I might add some onions and maybe even some green peppers for a little extra flavor. But overall, really good! Thank you!

My husband loved it! I added onions and peppers to the zucchini. Didn't have fresh basil so used Italian seasoning still tasted good. Next time I'll add more cheese since our family lives cgeese

Very good recipe.  I was searching for a main dish that included zucchini since we have an abundance of it from our garden.  So glad I tried this one...the flavors are delicous.  I did add diced onions when cooking the zucchini as others suggested.  Served with white rice for a complete meal.

Loved this recipe!  We have a garden and are always looking for new  ways to cook our vegetables.  This was very flavorful.  We only used 2 zucchini and that was plenty.  Only change I made was to add poultry seasoning and herb & garlic to Italian breadcrumbs.

Very good. A little incongruous : the "friedness" and the breading didn't seem to complement the fresh vegetables. Next time I'll probably season and grill the chicken and drop the the breading.

My neighbor showed up with 2 massive zucchinis from her garden. I googled recipes and this came up. Looked good. I used sharp cheddar (my favourite cheese) instead of mozzarella but other than that, made it per the recipe.
YUUUUUMMMMMYYYY ! Family demolished it.

Oh MY! I had most of the ingredients and figured...sigh... I'd give it a shot and probably be disappointed. WRONG! It's a keeper!! The only changes I made were to half the recipe and use dried basil leaves plus a sprinkling of some generic dried italian seasoning mix. Dee-lightful flavors! Hubs loved it too so it's going on the regular rotation! Thanks for a winner:)

Excellent recipe!!!   we loved it and will continue to make it again and again.  Changes  I made were to use thin sliced chicken breast (already available at the super market) and 
 since  we do not use salt, I used Mrs. Dash.    I accidentally  sprinkled more Dash in the egg mixture than I should have...probably a teaspoon or more, but it may have added to the flavor.  I also used half yellow squash  and half zucchini  and fresh tomatoes grown in my garden .  The flavor was exceptional!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had a garden full of zucchini, tomatoes  and a pot of fresh basil and wanted a recipe for them.  This one did not disappoint!  I made it as given with the exception of sprinkling my favorite Italian Grinder Seasoning on the veggies.   I used an Italian blend shredded cheese over the veggies and topped with mozzarella.  I will make this again and try adding the onions and peppers  as suggested.

This was pretty good but needed some spice but I did not have any fresh basil so I left it out. Tip: try to use 4 chicken breasts that are the same size. I had a package that had 2 gigantic chicken breasts and 2 smaller chicken breasts and by the time the big ones were done the smaller ones got dried out.

Great recipe!  I added to it though. I added a little Italian dressing on the veggies, fresh parmigian cheese with the mozzarella, onion and mushrooms with the veggies. And cut chicken breast into strips. Also used Italian flavored bread crumbs.  Was very good will definitely make again and again

My husband and I really enjoyed this dinner.  The one thing I would change is I would not cook the zucchini prior to baking.  We prefer our veggies less done and more firm.  However, it didn't take away from enjoying the reciepe.  Will defiantly have this one again!

This tasted GREAT!! I had to take away a star because it had to cook at least twice as long as the recipe said to get the chicken hot enough... This makes the zucchini soggy and really put a damper on my attempt at having dinner ready at a reasonable time. I will make this again but pound the chicken nice and thin first so that it cooks evenly and doesn't take as long. Other than that, we didn't think the recipe needed altering in any way, except to maybe sprinkle more breadcrumbs on the zucchini if you like that sort of thing. Delicious!!

I made exactly as recipe said except I added onions to the zicchini& garlic when sauteeing and  I used dried basil since I had no fresh. I served it over a small serving of bow tie pasta. It was a hit! I will make again.

This was excellent.  Because of a low carb diet, I substituted ground unsalted cashews for the breading.  It worked well.

My family loved this recipe.  I made it as written but I did add about 1/4 cup of onions with the sautéed garlic and zucchini and we added a little Parmesan cheese on the finished meal.  It's a little bit of a labor of love so not really a quick weeknight meal for a busy working mom, or maybe just me.  The fresh basil really makes the dish so flavorful.  Family said it's a keeper.

The dish looked visually very good. However, the recipe lacked flavor and was extremely bland. 
Thank You for Sharing

Sorry

I used frozen Chicken Patties instead of breasts, was faster and took longer to bake. I would make again though.

I made this last night for company. I only had 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  I had a package of French's fried onions so I crushed about a cup of those and mixed with the bread crumbs.  I sautéed the basil with the garlic and zucchini. I used two zucchini and two yellow squash.  You can usually find things in the pantry to substitute if you don't have every ingredient on hand.  This was a delicious meal and I will make it again.

I made this twice. Once as written, and then again with changes. As written, this is a 4+ star recipe. Easily 5 stars with just a few tweaks. I did not saute the zucchini. As other reviewers noted, that made it mushy in the end. I seasoned the raw zucchini and tomatoes generously with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, since I didn't saute the zucchini with minced garlic, as directed. I also did not bread the chicken because I'm trying to keep carbs low. I did season it with salt, pepper, and paprika, and browned it on both sides in a little olive oil before adding to the dish. I also used more basil than called for, and baked for 45 minutes due to the size of the chicken breasts I used. Otherwise, kept it the same. This will be going in our rotation. We all loved it. Thank you!

We are gluten free so we used panic gluten free with seasoned gluten free breadcrumbs.  Made a tasty coating.  We had to use frozen basil cubes as I was out of fresh, added a little salt and pepper as well. We use hot sauce on most foods later on, but in all, a great easy dish.  Thanks!!!

Delish! I added a little diced onion to the frying pan along with the zucchini and garlic. When this was done cooking I added some white wine. Cooked everything in a cast iron skillet and finished off in the oven. Really tasty meal!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! Except for I saute some garlic and I don't pre cook my zucchini or tomatoes. I also use Italian bread crumbs and a lot more mozzarella then it says.

OH MOST EXCELLENT.  This dish is amazing.   I made it as is and did not change a thing.   My husband loved this.  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I cannot wait to try the leftovers.   This is a keeper in the weekly rotation.

My husband and I loved this recipe when I first made it about a week ago.  The only thing I did differently was to add a little parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs.  I needed a recipe to use up some zucchini and chicken breasts and found this keeper.  I'm making it again tonight and will keep it to use regularly.

I loved the base of this recipe. I made some adjustments, three tablespoons of garlic, I salted and peppered the zucchini, I used a 1/4 cup of fresh basil, and I used Italian herb bread crumbs and this was a hit with the family! Thank you for this recipe, YUM!

I chose not to sauté the zucchini and it baked perfectly. I definitely did not need 5 zucchini! Only used 3 big hot house tomatoes. I meant to add additional seasoning to the bread crumbs but forgot to. It was pretty bland in the end, but some Jane's Crazy Mixed-Up Salt fixed that. Would definitely make again.

This was good. Will make again. I did not use the bread crumbs on the chicken. I just browned without them. I added a little onion in with my zucchini. Everything else I kept the same. We really enjoyed this.

The recipe was perfect exactly the way it was written.
The only thing I would change is the prep and baking time. I started at 5 and we ate at 7. Cutting, frying and the fact that I added 10 minutes to the baking time, made the time spent more like 2 hours. But a perfect summer recipe!

I added squash with the zucchini, but kept the recipe the same.  This has become a weekly dinner addition.  In fact, it's on schedule for tomorrow.

Delicious--and perfect for fixing earlier in the day, then putting in the oven when company arrives. Love do ahead menus with no last minute prep. Can add other vegetables if you wish--sliced Portobello mushrooms, onions, etc.

Great recipe! For me, just lacking seasoning. Make sure to season up the zucchini while it's on the stove, and the tomato layer after placing it in the dish. The chicken breasts I used were pretty thick, so I pounded them out before baking so the all cooked evenly. Thanks!

I doubled this recipe dividing ingredients to two casserole dishes. The veggies were layered in each casserole and topped with 4 chicken breast halves in each casserole. I used panko bread crumbs and did not find it was any better than regular bread crumbs. 

I lightly sautéed onion and green peppers as the bottom layer, then added the zucchini and thick sliced tomatoes. Found veggies were too mushy after baking. Next time I will not sauté the veggies before assembling in the casserole for baking.  Next time I will pound out the chicken breasts a bit to make them more even in thickness. By the time the thick chicken was cooked the others were over cooked and tough. 

If the chicken had not been over cooked and the veggies not so mushy my attempt at this dish would have earned 4 stars .

I thought this was very tasty! I cut it roughly in half. I used 2 chicken breasts and eyed the other ingredients. It fit nicely into an 8x8 pan. I infused olive oil with rosemary and sautéed onion with the garlic before adding the zucchini. I followed the other advice and didn't cook the zucchini as long. I also sliced it a little thicker as I wanted it to hold up. No mozzarella on hand so I used Monteray Jack and an Italian cheese blend. I will make again and add even more herbs to it! Might even try blue cheese!!!!!!!!

made it for my 20 something kids.  EVERYBODY loved it.  I did add more salt, pepper and seasonings (really needed it)... threw in a few slices of bell pepper that I had on hand but otherwise followed the direction exactly as it is.   Can't wait to make this again.  No starch was needed at all - it was perfect just the way it is.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was fantastic.  The only thing I changed was I used Italian flavored breadcrumbs and dipped them in the egg and shook them in the breadcrumbs, twice so the chicken would be covered more thoroughly.  This meal didn't need anything else as you have all your vegetables right in the same pan as the chicken breasts.  I will be making this frequently.  It's definitely good enough for company.  Thanks, Luaucow

Really good, though I think perhaps it needs a little more seasoning. Lovely dish, especially in summer with tomatoes, zuccini and basil from the garden. I served with corn on the cob, also from the garden. The chicken was really moist and the zuccini was perfect. (don't saute it too much ahead of baking). my husband said "you can make this again!"

Loved this. I don't give 5 stars. But this.  I used my garden fresh zucchini & tomato's so maybe that pushed it to being so good. Full of flavor. Will be having again.

I made this the other night and it was sooooo good. I added grated parmesan/romano cheese to my breadcrumbs (which I always do for extra flavor), because it will need additional seasoning. Another thing I added was a capful of marsala wine to the zucchini when they were about a minute in. And drizzled marsala wine over the chicken pieces prior to baking. This dish was so good, and so simple. My family devoured it!!!

First run of this dish, done per instructions: Other than leaving out the garlic, the chicken tasted plain and despite adding mushrooms and baby carrots--the veggies simply didn't have that restaurant zing I look for. Suggestions for a better cooking experience: Tenderize / marinade chicken 24 hours prior to cooking. Skillet cook veggies FIRST per recipe instructions THEN skillet cook chicken.

Loved it. I cut it to 2 chicken breasts and used sliced mozzarella (since that is what I had). Added some crispy onions to the last layer of bread crumbs.

Made this for the second time tonight and it came out much better.  The trick is to cook the veggies first, I think.  I sauteed the squash and garlic first.  I also added some orange and red peppers.  I added salt and pepper as well.  I transferred it all to the baking pan, topped it with fresh tomato slices and mozzarella cheese and parsley (we didn't have basil). Then I added a little more salt and pepper.  Then I cooked the chicken.  It came out so much better this time around.  The first time, my garlic burned and the crumbs leftover from the chicken were a little burnt as well.  The peppers also added a much nicer flavor.  It is too plain with just squash and tomatoes.  I think that onions and mushrooms could be a nice addition as well.  I would highly recommend adding some more flavorful veggies as it tasted 100 times better this time around.

I made it just the way it says. Loved that it didn't have loads of oil, loved that it didn't have loads of bread crumbs, and loved that it didn't have loads of cheese. Mind you  I also love all the above but when you're trying to eat healthier it's good to cut back. Zucchini and tomatoes have hardly any calories too! Next time I may try adding some fresh sliced mushrooms.

Despite some of the negative reviews, I thought this recipe may have potential based on the ingredients .  I took other reviewers' advice  and did not cook the zucchini first - it still came out over cooked and mushy.  I also added lots of dried basil, parsley, oregano, thyme, marjoram, salt & pepper to the breadcrumbs (Panko) and covered the tomatoes with a thick layer of fresh whole basil leaves.  Unfortunately it still came out pretty bland although the chicken was very tender and juicy, just lacking flavor.  I will not make this recipe again.

This was so good I changed it a little I added 1 onion chopped it chunky then fried it until golden brown put that in the casserole dish then chopped 1 small zucchini , 1 Chinese eggplant, 1/2 of green pepper fried that then added it to casserole dish. I added a little Parmesan & cheddar cheese on top. Used a large tomato and slice that into 4 slices. The rest I did the same. Don't forget to make a small bed of rice it goes well with the juices this creates.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Everyone loved it and we will be making it again very soon.  I followed the recipe and only added a bit of parm.  Next time I will put 2 layers of zuchinni, everyone wanted more.

I used half chicken breast which was too large and it did not cook in 25 minutes. I cooked it for additional 20 minutes which by then zucchinis became too cooked and – still tasted very good. I will make it again, but will use smaller chicken pieces. ick

This was actually a very quick and easy recipe with lots of flavor.  I rubbed the chicken with McCormick Grillmates Roasted Garlic and Herb and let it set in the refrige for about 6 hours before following the recipe.  I did add fresh oregano too.  Will definately make this again.

Awesome!! This has become a family favorite. It's a very versatile recipe. In addition to the zucchini and tomatoes, I add whatever vegetables I have on hand, onion is a must! The last time I made it I added a layer of baby spinach on top of the tomatoes. ??

Wonderful recipe. I've made it a few times and it's well received in our family. The reason for not giving it a 5 star is that zucchini is a bit too soft for my preference if I follow the recipe and fry it first.

Check out my pics. I altered the recipe. Ditched the tomatoes...added bell peppers (yellow, red, & orange) and ginger to the recipe. Also, I sautéed  the zucchini, peppers, garlic and fresh ginger for about 2 mins more than directed. I took the liberty of squeezing 1 fresh whole lemon on the organic and skinless chicken breasts. I also seasoned the chicken  breasts to my liking before the egg wash and bread crumbs. I would recommend  that. It was perfect. I think the chicken would have been bland without it. Elegant and delicious  dish!

This is an easy and great dish. Have made it as written as well as making changes depending on what I have on hand. 
As others have suggested I usually add a red pepper and small onion. I also have sliced the breasts into cutlets and then fried them for some added crisp

This was wonderful!!!! I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of petite diced tomatoes and sweet onion and I used Italian breadcrumbs. Absolutely fabulous!!!! Served with garlic and buttered angel hair pasta....my family said it was a definite keeper!! Also used chicken thighs instead of breast...the flavor was awesome.

This recipe was pretty good. I will definitely make it again. I made a few changes. I cut my chicken into 8 pieces rather than 4. I also used canned tomatoes, cut down on some of the chopping time. I had 2 large zucchini's and that was more than enough. Lastly, I used the rehydrated fresh basil, the kind that is fresh but you must add water to it. It's just me so I will be eating off this all week but I am okay with that!

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, it is very good but it is unmemorable.  It is exactly what it says it is, breaded and seared chicken over vegetables with cheese.

I just made this with rotini on the side.  I only had one zucchini and one tomato, two pieces of chicken, plenty of garlic and frozen basil and lots of mozzarella.  I had good quality olive oil as well.  The baking dish was too large - a smaller square 9x9 would have been better for my smaller amount, but it was delicious anyway. I can't have gluten so I just oven browned it then added the veg. My husband loved it.  I'll make it again.

This was a great recipe! The only downside was that there was a LOT of tomato. We love tomato and all, but it was too much for the dish. Otherwise, amazing and it doesn't need any kind of changing or tweaking aside from less tomato.

Great dish! Everyone who ate it loved it. I used Italian panko style bread crumbs and serve the dish with Parmesan basil orzo.

Very good.  Halved the chicken, zucchini & tomato so it could fit in "toaster" oven I have in an 8 x 8 glass dish - made this on my porch so I didn't heat up the house w/the regular oven.  Didn't use near as much cheese - just sprinkled some moz & a little parmesan over the zucchini so there was a nice bit, but not heavy.  Added onion and roasted red pepper to the garlic & zuc when I sauteed them.  Used Italian breadcrumbs.  Didn't sprinkle cheese on top.  Was very very good!  Served w/cous cous

This was an awesome dish! This is the type of recipe you can use as is or tweak by adding things. I peeled and diced my zucchini so it wouldn't get mushy being sliced. I also used Wegmans Basting Oil instead of normal oil. Also, way more fresh basil as it's taken over our garden and we love it.

Delicious! I added lots more chopped fresh garlic and used some yellow squash with the zucchini but other than that followed the recipe completely. The whole family loved it! Will definitely be making this recipe again.

Was very tasty. I served with a side of marinara but I didn't use it once. The chicken had so much flavor. I did add salt and pepper as others on here said they did. Will make again.

This was great - I didn't have fresh basil, but I used a good Rosemary seasoning in it.  I also first sauteed the zucchini and garlic, put them in a dish sprayed with olive oil, then did the chicken, so I didn't have to dirty another dish.   I really enjoyed it and will be making it again soon.

Added yellow squash and eggplant to the vegetables. Had to use canned diced tomatoes. Spread it all in a 10x14 pan. Took several steps but worth the effort.

I just made this exactly as written and it was great. Amazing. The only complaint I have is that it seems that 5 zucchinis and 4 tomatoes is a bit much. I did 4 and 4 and had plenty. Highly recommended.

Unbelievable recipe! Your guests will know you are a gourmet cook! I would make sure you add a little extra of oil when cooking chicken & Zucchini, extra sprinkled bread crumbs on the Zucchini after you put it in the casserole dish, added a little more cheese than the recipe & make sure you have a temperature gauge to make the chicken perfect because I had very large chicken breasts. Depending on what you have if you have cooked at all before you can change the recipe a little, but come out with the same awesome result! A+
