I am only giving this a 4 because I tweaked it to our tastes. 
I added no water, because it seemed like it might be too runny and skipped the salt and reduced the bouillon.
I browned the hamburger, onions and 1 heaping TBSP of minced garlic (jar found in produce section) in a fry pan. I added pepper to my taste. (a lot more than called for) I then drained and put in my crock along with 1 lg. can of mushroom soup (instead of mushrooms)and 1 sm. can tomato sauce, (instead of paste)  and 4 bouillon cubes. I also added some paprika. I cooked pasta shells and mixed it in with the stuff in the crock after it was finished cooking on low. (meat mix cooked for 3 hrs on low) I would have used egg noodles, but realized I was out.  This was GREAT!!!!!!!!!  I don't usually like this type of meal, but even I loved it this time. Hubby loves this stuff. I served with grean beans and garlic bread. The mushroom soup made this soooo creamy and yummy. No need for added milk or sour cream.

I picked this recipe because it didn't call for sour cream.. which I didn't have on hand.  I added Worcestershire's from another review, and added real mushrooms instead of canned.  I didn't have tomato paste, so I used a small can of tomato sauce.. Towards the end I thought it needed something else, so I added a can of cream of mushroom... and threw in egg noodles that were cooked 3/4 of the way through.  I let it simmer lightly while I ran to the store for about 20 minutes.  I came back, it was all gone.  My husband had dug into it and thought it was sooooooooo good. He wasn't even all that hungry when he'd came home from work, too.  He told me our 2 year old had two helpings. He left me 2 bites worth.  He thought it was awesome, and I guess my 2 year old did too.  I gave it 4 stars just because I had to tweak it a little bit..

This was very good!  I took it to the picnic too.  It was easy.  I did use 1/2 lb of fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I did it in the crockpot, overnight, and stired in noodles in the morning. That way it made a one pot dinner. I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup. with roasted garlic. Will use this again! And I also figured that the sour cream was left out, so added that. My husband really loved this one.

Very bland. I substututed 1/2 cup of sour cream for the cold water and added 2tbls of worcestershire sauce which greatly improved the taist. My husband who doesn't like anything loved it.

I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of water (no flour).  I used 2-3 tbsp. of tomato paste.  Everything else was just as the recipe called for.

This made my house smell wonderful, and I thought it was very tasty. Hubby only liked it "so-so" and he said it was a glorified version of Hamburger Helper. I, personally thought it was very tasty and it hit the spot. I did mine in the crockpot after browning the meat and sauteeing the onions & garlic. Also took the advice of another poster and used cream of mushroom instead of canned mushrooms. Also added in sour cream at the end. Didn't use the water & flour - and it turned out very well.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it served its purpose!  It was quick, easy, cheap and wholesome.  Yes, it is like hamburger helper but with lots less preservatives and trans fats.  I think the recipe writer left out the sour cream part, but anyone who knows stroganoff knows to add sour cream before serving.  We served over egg noodles like another reviewer suggested and it was a good dinner.  Not gourmet, but is stroganoff ever gourmet?  We will make again definitely!  My husband and 21 month-old toddler loved it.  Great for those quick week-night meals.

I was not impressed.  This is a good "Quick and Dirty" meal for the family, but I would hardly serve it to guests.  It *IS* very tasty, but nothing to rave about.  My husband is a cooking enthusiast (it is is hobby), so I have high standards. I prefer stroganoff to have the creamy texture of REAL cream!  This was far more complicated than a box of Hamburger Helper - for about the same result!

This recipe was very good and so easy. I did make a few changes though. I didn't add the salt,I only added 5 boullion cubes, I added 4 cloves of garlic, and I addded fresh broccoli flowerets. Everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper!

Blech. :( I wasn't at all pleased with the consistency or taste of this. It needed big chunks of something in it - this was more like ground beef soup. Ick! I gave it two stars because it was edible to my hubby, but he didn't like it either.

This dish was a staple in our house when I was growing up. My mother usually made this version with stew beef though, instead of ground beef. When I first started making it myself, it never tasted quite the same, until one day she told me her secret. Use real butter (not oil or margarine) for all the sauteeing. It adds some calories, true, but the flavor will be drastically improved.

To have stroganoff you have to add paprika and sour cream!!!  A little milk or preferably half and half add the right flavor.  NO tomato paste!!!!

This was good but a little too salty. I had to used chicken cubes because that is all that I had. I also added a little more tomato paste to taste. To dull the saltiness, I added some milk.

This was very good and will make it again. I will try the cream of mushroom soup in it next time, but really I don't think it needs it.

I'm surprised by all the great reviews.  I love the ingredients that go into this and I thought for sure I would love it, but I felt like I was eat a sloppy joe on noodles.  My husband said it was fine and it was certainly edible, but I didn't care for it.  The tomato paste is definitely not a good addition.  Sorry

This has become part of the regular menu here in our house! I did change it a bit, using beef broth instead of water and omitting the boullion cubes. Also adding sour cream at the end adds a nice twang to the flavor. I serve this with rice, and the family loves it!

Sorry, but I didn't care for this. I just kept adding stuff to it to make it better, and nothing helped. I'm not sure where stroganoff comes into the recipe. It does not call for sour cream but I see that others did add it. I'm sure that helped a bunch. But I did not have any in the house and that is why I made it. I agree with the poster who said this was sloppy joe mix over noodles.

I exchanged the sour cream for creamcheese bec my family doesn't like sour cream.  I only use 4 beef bouillion cubes and that was plenty. I only gave this 3 stars bec I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and it was still very salty.  I wished I didn't add any salt.  I just used one large onion.  I served it with pasta shells and garlic bread.  I think it would've been 4 stars if it weren't so salty.

Not Stroganoff in my book.  I would rename this Hamburger Helper.  Perhaps make the ground beef into little meat balls (with a few additions), cut the tomato paste and add sour cream at the last minute and serve over egg noodles.  Sorry...everyone is entitled to their opinion and that is mine.

Too salty as others have sad. Yes, real stroganoff does have a little bit of tomato paste in it, about a tablespoon is all. This isn't stroganoff. I don't know what it is, a soup maybe? Stroganoff also needs Worchestershire sauce, and requires sour cream. It's also never made with hamburger or bouillion cubes.

I needed something quick for dinner. I made this tonight using one pound of very lean beef (96/3). I followed other reviewers' suggestions: I sauteed the garlic & onion in a combo of butter, olive oil. I added one 8 oz can of tomato sauce, one 10 3/4 oz can of cream of mushroom soup, some Worcester sauce and about 2 1/4 tsps of beef bouillon granules. Near the end of cooking, it seemed to be missing something. I completely agree that sour cream is needed. However, all I have is milk. I seasoned with salt, pepper, italian seasoning, garlic powder. It smells great. My 3 yr old is licking her lips in anticipation. I am serving it on top of noodles with mixed veggies on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good starter, I made a few changes and I love it! I used a whole small can of tomato paste, fresh mushrooms and add some Worcestershire. After simmering for a little over an hour I added about half a cup of sour cream and then mixed it all together with the egg noodles and it ended up being very tasty. As far as other saying this is just glorified hamburger helper, we then don't make it and just stuck to living out of a box! Thanks for the recipe, my whole family enjoyed it.

When I think of Beef Stroganoff I think creamy--to get the creamy I substituted the 1.5 cups water for milk with the flour mixture. Gave it the creamy texture needed. I'm also a mushroom lover so I added 2 cans of mushrooms. Just beware-this is a meal you will eat with your sense of smell & taste--not sight! Looks like dog food but tastes delish!!

It'OK but it's not beef stroganoff if it doesn't have sour cream in it.

This was not for me, this also had bad side effects for my family.  I used real mushrooms too (don't prefer the canned ones).  Think it had too many beef cubes - maybe try one less?  Still don't know if I would like it though.  I really like cream based mushroom soup type stroganoff but that is NOT the way I would like to make it (that's the reason I tried this recipe) will keep looking.

I actually think this "stroganoff" had a pretty nice flavor, but it just wasn't what I expected. It reminded me more of a meat sauce to put over spaghetti in appearance. I suppose it would have been better with about half as much tomato, in my opinion. I gave it two stars for flavor, but subtracted three, because had I not told anyone what it was supposed to be, no one would have ever guessed it was stroganoff and not just another pasta sauce.

Very good! As suggested, I cut boullion cubes to 4, and since my husband is the only family member who likes mushrooms, I just sauteed them in butter in a pan all by themselves so he could add to his, but the rest of us didn't have to pick them out. Also added sour cream just before serving.  Will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty bland. At the end we added whatever we could think of to spice it up and it was okay, just average.

So easy to make, and very tasty! I cut the recipe in half, and it easily fed my hubby, our adult son, and me. The only addition I would suggest is add 1-2 teaspoons of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato paste. Also, I was out of egg noodles, so I served it over fettuccine noodles instead. YUMMY!

Love this recipe, wouldn't change a thing, but... Maybe it's just that I'm not very culturally aware but this tastes nothing like stroganoff to me.  It tastes like a bolognese, if anything.

But, again, my family loved it, and it's now come to replace my usual (doctored) jar of marinara.

This is like sloppy joe on top of noodles - even with several additions from other reviewers. This is NOT CREAMY stroganoff  like you may expect. I will not be making this again.

This had hardly no taste at all.  Very plain.  I added tomato sauce, oregano, basil, parsley, cheddar cheese and rice.  After all of the additions, everyone at the reunion said it was really good.  I don't know that I will try it again though.

I found this to be easy & very good.  I did take some advice as I'm not a mushroom eater & used cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some sour cream just because I thought it would need it.  Results were fantastic & my children loved it too.

YUM!  I made this as a last minute replacement for something I messed up and I didn't want to run to the store.  It was SO easy, even with an empty fridge I had everything!  My picky husband loved it and my 7 year old son had a FOURTH large helping...it was a hit.  I just served it on spaghetti noodles because that is what I had and I used whole button mushrooms because I had those and was simply to lazy to cut them. But it was really good.  Will DEFINATELY make it again and again!

I feel really bad because I hate to give bad reviews, and normally I just don't bother but this was really really not good, bland and watery. Maybe it's because I tried to make in the slow cooker. At one point my husband looked at me and asked what smelled so bad. I threw it in the garbage because no amount of doctoring could save it. Sorry.

I did a few things differently. We didn't have any onions, so I used celery. It was great!  Also, after making the sauce, I removed from heat and added low fat sour cream.  It was wonderful...next time I will use less salt though.

Very tasty after some tweaked it a bit. Made it the first time exactly to resipe then secon time added more salt, can cream of mushroom and beef broth in a can ( that's all I had) and served with corn bread. That gave it a nice touch. Everyone loved it. We now call it Poor Man's Beef Stoganoff around my house

I looked at this in the crock-pot and thought "this looks disgusting" but oh my goodness, when I tasted it, it was delicious! I didn't add mushrooms because I can't stand them, so I used cream of mushroom soup. I also didn't add quite as much water as the recipe called for. Some of the comments said it didn't have much flavor, I thought it was perfect!

It was an easy quick dinner.  The boys loved it.  Using gluten free flour mix and almond milk doesn't change the taste either.  It would have been good with sour cream at end too.  I used fresh mushcrooms and more fresh garlic too.

This is a very good week night recipe that lends itself well to adaptation. I only had 1.5lbs of ground beef so I also put in a can of tomato's. Used 2 cups beef stock instead of bouillion + water.
Beef, tom sauce, canned toms and pasta were all organic from Costco. Total cost for 4 adults was about 9 bucks which is pretty good for a healthy satisfying dinner. Will make again.

My family really liked this meal, although I did sub fresh mushrooms for canned. I skipped the flour, also, because I forgot it. I used less water and simmered it for 20 minutes, also.

It was a good and easy mid-week meal, which I'm certain I'll repeat.

I make this recipe exactly as it is. Beef stroganoff has been one of my favorite meals for a long time, but both my daughter and fiance are lactose intolerant so I never made it. That is, until I found this recipe. It's the only beef stroganoff recipe I've ever found that doesn't have cream of mushroom soup, or heavy cream, or sour cream, or some other dairy. It's easy, it's delicious, and my whole family can enjoy it. 5 stars from me for sure!

It's fine but the tomato-based sauce is not what I'm used to. I'd prefer a cream-sauce on this.

Well, I made this dish for it to serve 7.  I figure we can have it as leftovers the next evening.  We are a family of 3 ( 2 adults and a 9 yr old.) The next evening I realize my husband liked it soo much that he took the leftovers with him to work!  So I guess this is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very easy to make. But like others had stated it had a very bland taste to it. so I kept adding more seasoning to give it a better flavor. I added more garlic powder, onion powder and onion salt because I didn't have any onions or garlic. I also added some crushed red peppers for a little spice, worchester sauce, ketchup instead of paste (didn't see the point to waste a whole can for just 4 TBSP of paste). I also added some parslry flakes and some sugar to give it that little sweet but spicy taste. I just kept adding ingredients until I felt it was just right. Hope this helps!!  :-)

I read the reviews and thought i'd share how I tweaked it for our tastes..it came out yummy! I sauteed the onions with a tablespoon of minced garlic. Then, when I added the ground beef, I added a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. I left out all the water and used Mushroom soup instead of mushrooms and used tomato sauce (not paste). Then, when i added the mushroom soup to the meat mixture, I put in 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper,teaspoon of black pepper, and 1/2 beef boullion. At last 15 mins I added a teaspoon of cornstarch..simmered and put over fusili pasta...I would definitely make again!

This is not beef stroganoff. I made it almost the same ( used broth instead of boullion) but it came out more like sloppy joes! I knew better than to put the tomato paste but used it anyway and I apologized to my boyfriend over and over again for making something so gross. Luckily he eats anything, but mine went in the trash. Sorry. I think I'll try Beef Stroganoff III from this site next.

I followed the recipe except I didn't have mushrooms, and I only used 3/4 of the bullion cubes. WAY too salty (and I like salt!). So... I added a bunch of water... still too salty... added egg noodles thinking it would even out the flavor... still too salty. So finally I just ladeled out most the broth, and now it tastes great. I'll save the juice to make a soup tomorrow.

This was easy and very good.  I thought it tasted a little bland at the simmer stage so I added about a tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  I also used fresh button and crimini mushrooms. I served it with 'Egg Noodles' from this site.

Awesome...Loved it.  Posted my picture of the finished product.  I read some reviews and made the following changes:    Used 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup. Added sour cream at the end.  It came out WAY too salty so next time I'll reduce the salt and reduce the boullion cubes to 4 instead of 6.

I thought this was a great quick meal.  Easy to prepare with ingredients that I usually have on hand.  I did use cream of mushroom soup in place of the mushrooms and only used 4 bullion cubes. (only used 1 1/4 pound of gr. beef) I added just enough water to get it to a consistancy that I was happy with, and served it with egg noodles.  I am not sure that a true stroganoff lover would like it, I don't like sour cream or creamy meals so I loved it, a purist could always add some sour cream to taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very similar to the Stroganoff I used to make for my family. However, I used no cubes and added sour cream at the end after I removed it from the heat. We served over noodles. It might not be "real" strognaoff, but the idea is that it is easy, tasty, and simple. My family always loved it. I did try this a few weeks ago (?) and found that using the bouillon made it too salty for me, too.

Worse than hamburger helper. It had too much tomato and just was not good. I think the recipe is more of a tomato beef stew than stroganoff. Will not make it again.

This was very good. Instead of tomato paste, I used 3/4 cup tomato sauce. Next time I will use just one onion and two cans of mushrooms. I would recommend this recipe.

Good stuff! Used lots of fresh mushrooms instead of a can. Also sped up the process by adding cornstarch for thickening (which upped the carbs, but oh well). The kids loved it; the dad cooked it. Definitely keeping this one around.

I leave the tomato paste out but add black olives.  I am considering using some sour cream to give it more of a stroganoff taste.  Other than that it is pretty darn good.

EXCELLENT!!  Wow this was so good!  I didn't think it was too salty at all, but I love salt.  I did add a dollop of sour cream at the end just to make it more stroganoff-y.  This was the only good recipe I could find that didn't have a ton of sour cream and cream soup mix in it.  It really gives it a 'from scratch' taste.  I will be making this again for sure!!  I read another reviewer's comments that this was like manwich mix- I might just spice it up and use it for that as well.  Good suggestion!

This recipe was the best-yet on the allrecipes site.  It was very easy to make and tasted superb.  I had a packet of shredded carrots and added about 1/3 cup.  Additionally, I added one & a half teaspoons of worcestershire sauce and this really gave the flavor a boost!  Thanks Luann.

We have made this recipe several times.  It is so easy to make my husband has been able to do it.  We serve it over egg noodles, or our kids like it over spaghetti noodles.  In my book, this is one of the best.

I had to tweak a little and it still wasn't anything special. It was more of a "sloppy joe" than anything else. I have a recipe I use (from this site called Grandma's Sloppy Joe's.) I added the ground cloves as per the sloppy joe recipe that my family loves and VIOLA there you have it.....sloppy joes for supper tonight.

I didnt like this recipe at all.  Very plain...bland.  Perhaps it is because I am used to a very rich and creamier style.  I was actually looking for an idea for lactos-free. For me this was more like slightly seasoned hamberger over noodles.  I won't be making it again.

wow, this was one hot mess.  did not care for it at all & had to throw a bunch of stuff in it to even make it edible.  it was more the consistency of a sauce & i put in quite abit of cornstarch to thicken it up & it was still yuck.  do not add salt with the beef bouillon, way too salty...just pass this recipe by!!

Loved this!! I did follow some of the reviewers suggestions and also added a few other things which is why the 4 stars. I added extra garlic and the Worcestershire which was recommended. I also omitted the flour and only used half the water. Also instead of the sour cream I used about 1/3 a cup of heavy whipping cream. This is tasty and delicious. Probably the higher fat version but very creamy and delicious. Oh and a few dashes of paprika and additional pepper is also a must.

this is the first time i have reviewed something on this site for not being good. i am surprised this gets as many stars as it does. it was way too salty and i agree with everyone else, not like stroganoff at all. i ended up trying to turn it into a spaghetti sauce and it's now edible but definitely not the best.

At the risk of repeating what other have said, there is nothing about this that resembles stroganoff.  It was very soupy, not creamy....just OK.  Not one for the recipe box though.

Had to adjust since I was working with what I had in the kitchen. I halved this recipe and used all ingredients. On canned mushrooms added one can regular and one can portabella also added a can of golden mushroom soup by campbells. Also added more garlic. Quick and easy recipe.

I followed the advise of other reviews and omitted the water and flour. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and about 1/3 cup of sour cream. I didn't let it simmer for an hour either and it turned out pretty good. I would make again for a quick meal.

Tasty and quick.  Made in the crockpot so instead of all the water I added one can of Cream of Mushroom Soup, one can of water. Also put one cup of sour cream in at the end to thicken it up.

I pretty much followed the recipe. I did use organic beef broth instead of the cubes, but it needs something. I just added some garlic/onion salt and more pepper and that seemed to do the trick. Not the best meal ever but atleast you know its pure with no bad stuff like hamburger helper. It was tasty and filling.

I made this recipe using cubed steak instead of the ground beef.  I cut the steak into serving size pieces and browned in a skillet and sat aside.  I then proceeded to cook the onions and other ingredients as directed then added the meat back to the skillet and simmered.  I cooked less than the hour suggested - probably 35 to 40 minutes - just until the cubed steak was done.  I served it over egg noodles.  I thought the sauce/gravy was a bit thin.  Less water would have been better.  I used the leftovers the next day with rice.  The sauce was a bit thicker the second day and was delicious.  My husband loved it.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper" for our family.

EXCELLENT!!  I made this at the last minute, and it was great.  The whole family had seconds, it has a great flavor. The only thing I changed was that I added sour cream at the end. I will be using this one again, thanks for sharing!!

I read all the reviews and only added 3 beef bouillon cubes.  I tasted it after a few hours in the slow cooker and it tasted so bland so I decided to add the rest.  Hoping it'd be a good meal, it was way too salty for even myself.  My toddler loved it though.  My husband did agree with another person who said it tasted like what they had in the military and said the same thing.  I'll never make this again unless someone comes up with one that is less salty.

This turned out a lot better than I expected. I used beef broth instead of bullion because of the salt. I'll definitely make this again.

I was worried this might taste kind of bland so I used a lot of black pepper and also (being a good Hungarian daughter) a lot of paprika in the mix.  I left out the extra boullion and salt.  I let the tomato/boullion mixture simmer and at the end instead of flour+water added a mixture of equal parts half-and-half and sour cream, with 2tbsp of cornstarch.   tasty!

Thank you for this recipe.  It makes enough for my husband and I to have two meal's worth and then I can also take some for lunch!  I tried it both with a spoonful of sour cream as a garnish and without.  Both are great!

This recipe is a new family favorite. My very picky three-year-old loved it.  As suggested, I cut the bouillon down to three cubes and cut out the salt.  I also added exta garlic, a bit more paste, sprinked with 1 tsp garlic powder, 3 tsp cumin, and 1 Tb chili powder.  I mixed in 3 cups cooked elbow noodles for a great meal.

I like it!  The only beef stroganoff I've ever had comes in a frozen box, so I really don't have much of a basis of comparison.  This recipe, however, is simple and delicious.  A great addition to my basic cooking repertoir.

I was not expecting this recipe to be this good! I went with the woman who used Worchestershire Sauce And use 5 garlic cloves and it was great! I prefer more spicy dishes, but my boyfriend likes more bland dishes; this one was a good mix.

This is a tasty, quick meal. I made a few changes. I used NO salt at all and reduced the boullion cubes to four. Like someone else, I added a little sour cream before serving. This recipe was well received by my family.

I took the advice and use half of the salt, the taste is great. I also added carrot & peas because my son like them.
Ground beef is easier to eat for toddlers.

This is one of our family favorites. I never simmer for the full hour and always add a bit of extra flour to thicken it. We like to add a bit of paprika, too. I don’t add salt in the recipe, but we always end up putting a bit of salt and pepper on at the table. Leftovers are excellent!

nice, simple, little prep time recipe but i found it way too salty. usually I'm ok with salt but this was too much. i didnt add any salt as per recipe so it all came from other ingredients. i would recommend eliminating 2 beef buillon cubes and it should be much better. 
otherwise great recipe.

The recipe calls for too much salt and does not include sour cream. Also, 5 cubes of bouillon  was way too much.

Great receipe. I leave the skins on the potatoes adds a bit more flavor. Also season with garlic salt and basil instead of mixing with water I use milk. None the less this is a really great recipe !

Based on some suggestions from others, I made a few changes.  I followed the original recipe but then put in 2Tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce and one can of condensed Cream of Mushroom soup.  I also added egg noodles 20 minutes before the simmering was complete.  

I found the 2tsp of salt and 6 bouillon cubes was too much, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  1tsp should be enough salt and I'd cut the bouillon back to 3 cubes.

Other than that, it came out great and the whole family enjoyed it.

This was delicious. My family loved it and it was super easy to make. I made it a second time and served it over rice. We liked it over rice too.

This is an easy trow together recipe. I didnt have tomato paste or mushrooms or beef. I used ground turkey, creamy tomato soup concentrate and chick stock, I didnt use any water except to make the flour paste mixture. Very good, and easy.

Fairly ordinary.  Also fairly high salt with three boullioun cubes in it.  Not bad but won't make again.  

I've notice a lot of recipes here are salt licks.

This recipe tastes great. I didn't put in the mushrooms, onions or garlic (not my favorites) and I had to add more flour to get the consistency I wanted, but the kids loved it.

It was a quick recipe.  I had to "doctor" it up quite a bit to make it palatable.  I picked this recipe because of its high rating but I should have read the comments more thoroughly before deciding to make this dish.

I have to agree with SHERRIBERRI519 - this is more like ground beef soup. I didn't like the consistency at all. I added more garlic, paprika and a good slosh of Worcestershire sauce because it was so bland. Yes, it's quick and easy but the end result is extremely disappointing. It gets two stars for at least being edible, but I won't be making this again. Sorry.

This was super easy and pretty good. I was looking for a recipe to use up the mushrooms i had and also the tomato paste and ground beef from a chili i made. I didn't give it five just because its not great, just pretty good. i'd make it again just for the ease of it.

This was just OK.  It was easy, but WAY TOO SALTY.  I may try again using only 3 bouillon cubes, and it did need the sour cream.  Also added 2 packets Splenda, which gave it just a touch of sweetness.

Good flavor, kids enjoyed it.  A wholesome, economical homemade version of hamburger helper.
