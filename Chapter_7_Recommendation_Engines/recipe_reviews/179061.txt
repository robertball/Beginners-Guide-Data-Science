Yes! This was a first class rice recipe, nice enough that I served it at easter dinner. I made a few small changes. As I was eating,I did notice that a tiny amount of table salt really brought out the flavor of this one. I don't know that I would add salt into the preparations, just keep it handy at the table. I prefer the taste and texture of brown rice, so I subbed that in place of the white rice. I also think that the longer cooking time needed for  brown rice is appropriate for lentils. I used chicken broth rather than the veg. broth, since that is what I had on hand. Left out the celery and tomatoes, but added about 8 ounces of diced fresh mushrooms when I combined the broth/rice/barley with the other veggies. Definitely needed longer than 20 minutes, but I just kept checking it as I prepared the other dishes. I would consider serving this as a meatless meal, with a tossed salad and bread.

Really tasty. I used brown rice also, so it took almost an hour to cook. The lentils got a little mushy, but everyone who tasted it liked it. I will be making this again. Great way to eat lentils.

It was okay but maybe I just didn't do it right because the Lentils were a little hard while everything else was fine.

A delicious healthy dish. I used brown rice instead of white rice though, so I had trouble the first time because The water ran out before it was done cooking. I tried again using twice the broth and it is delicious.

really blah.  needs more flavor and seasoning.  I doused mine in smoky seasoned salt.  If I were to make it again, i'd cut back on the onion/celery/carrot mixture.

Try frying the veg up in a cast iron pan, then transferring it to the oven when the lentils broth and rice are added. If you have a cast iron without a lid tin foil works fine.

A very nice recipe.  If it is used as a main dish, I would add a bit more salt to your own tasting.  I served it with a rather salty meat and the balance was perfect as it is written.

Very warm and filling. No strong flavors, but still satisfying and healthy.

This was just ok, I don't think I'd make it again.  I soaked the lentils for about an hour and they were fine, not hard.  I added some salt as suggested.

I increased the broth and cooked it for a little longer (used brown rice instead of white).  I also added some curry powder, chili powder, and salt to give it some more flavor.

Very good but added salt and had to cook much longer than stated.
