Good but we didn't care for the basil. The phyllo cups hold VERY little. I ended up w/a huge mess but was able to peel enough cups off the baking sheets for the function I made these for.

I only had flat phyllo sheets so I used a cupcake tin and pressed them down to make cups. Really enjoyed and easy to make!

After about 5 minutes in the oven I smelled something burning. The liquid had run out of the cups and was dripping onto the bottom of the oven.I won't be giving this recipe a second chance.
