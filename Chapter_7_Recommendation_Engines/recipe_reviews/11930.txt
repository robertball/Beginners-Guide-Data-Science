So glad I found this recipe.  Had all the ingredients to make a pizza, and my oven broke!  This is the next best thing.  I used the diced tomatoes with basil and garlic, and added some dried oregano, basil and Italian seasoning.  Topped the whole dish with a mix of grated parmesan and mozzarella.  Thanks for saving supper!

This was pretty good, *definitely* a kid pleaser.  The only thing we changed was after making the sauce and noodles, we mixed it all together and baked it in a lazagna pan with mozzarella and parmesan cheses on top.  It adds about 15 minutes to the prep/cook time, but is well worth it.  Not the healthiest dish in the world, but a great substitution for the friday night pizza!

This is good. I used mushrooms, olives, salami, and hot sausage - then added a little mozzerella and parmesan on top. Thanks for the recipe!

This is so yummy!  Makes a lot, so it's great for functions. I put it in a crockpot to keep it warm. I use one can of Italian tomato paste and one regular. I use one can of diced Italian tomatoes and one regular. I do not simmer it for 2 or 3 hours.

I LOVE this recipe...I first made this after my husband and I were married and it was a hit with all our kids...they munched on it for days afterwards.....I always add some spag. sauce and experiment with other pizza toppings that we like.

This dish had the density of paste.  I followed the instructions, and shouldn't have.  I liked all of the ingredients and thought it would be good...it wasn't. Won't be a next time, but, will create my own version using regular canned tomatoes...not stewed, no paste, and not letting it "simmer for 2 to 3 hours".

I cut the recipe in 1/2 for our family of three.  It's now one of my 14 yr old son's favorite recipes to prepare!

I made half the recipe, and still had leftovers after my husband and I had our portions! I also found making half, I did not have to simmer as long, and only did it for 10 minutes. I left out the mushrooms because we aren't fans. Instead of the fresh basil, which I didn't have on hand, I sprinkled some Italian seasoning on.  Next time I will try with the basil.
