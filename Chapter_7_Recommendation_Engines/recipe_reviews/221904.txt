Made these for my cousin's 80th birthday party.  Very easy to make and delicious.  Got lots of requests for the recipe.  Did add a dash of worcestershire and made the spread about 12 hours before making the sandwiches so flavors could blend.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for a mother's day church tea today and these were a hit! They disappeared in minutes and multiple people asked me for the recipe. I followed the recipe to a t, making the cream cheese mixture the night before and assembling them at church. I made a recipe and a half of the cream cheese mixture hoping it would work for 48 quarters of bread, but it was way too much. I'm using the leftovers for a nice veggie dip and big veggie sandwichs (it is delicious with roasted red peppers). Will make again! Thanks!

I made these sandwiches for a big birthday party.  They were a huge hit and very easy to make.  You can prepare almost everything the day before and then just put them together right before the party.

Perfect! Followed the recipe to a T, and it was flawless. Also, the hit of the party. Bonus tip: I trimmed a loaf of white bread, and the trimmings turned out to be 8 cups: exactly enough to make this stuffing! http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sausage-Stuffing

Very tasty and simple to make.  I was pleased when I made a trial batch. It's also good with plain cream cheese.  I will be making 100 of these for a ladies tea party.

Served this, not open faced but regular 2 piece of bread style sandwich for a group of about 20 people. Everyone loved!!! Even by 12 & 8 year old! I used a combo of light and regular cream cheese as well as a combo of light and regular sour cream to save on calories and it was still good. Also, I didn't have whipped cream cheese with chives so I used some fresh finely chopped green onions. And I forgot the fresh dill...however sandwiches were a hit and there was nothing left over! I served as snack along with the spinach pasta salad recipe from Kim Fusich on this site.

I brought these to a baby shower and they were great!  They were all gone and only had an empty plate to take home.  Very easy and simple to make.

I only used 1 Tablespoon of the Ranch dressing packet. Made it to bring for Easter, and got rave reviews from the guys as well as women.
FYI, whipped cream cheese with chives container is now 7.5 oz.
Easy, easy, easy.

This is so delicious! I used whipped cream cheese, added 1/2 or less cup of mayo, about the same amount of sour cream  and added the powder buttermilk ranch a little at a time to satisfy my taste. I also finely chopped about a teaspoon of fresh dill and stirred that in. I refrigerated it overnight. I used white and wheat bread to make my cucumber sandwiches, cut out in penguin shape. I may not have followed the recipe exactly but I'm thankful that it was available for me to be inspired to try something I thought was only for the tea ladies ??

I made this for a church get-together and everybody loved it, even though I forgot the sour cream! I used dill weed spice in the mixture because I didn't have any fresh dill weed. I will definitely make again, and maybe add a little Worcestershire sauce as someone mentioned.

Never got to the sandwich part.  Made spread and then cut up cucumber and dipped into spread. (skipped the bread)  It was great.

These were a great addition to my recent tea party! I followed the recipe exactly as written. 
They kind of treated like a creamy salad sandwich! Next time I'll try making it without the ranch packet, though. I think they'll be much better with just the Dill and flavored cream cheese. 
I used a Japanese sandwich press to seal the edges of the sandwich and get rid of the crusts. It turned them into a fun sandwich pita!

These were a huge hit with our Zumba ladies!  Such a refreshing taste and did use Outback Steakhouse bread as suggested in other reviews as well as making the cream cheese mixture a day ahead of time.  The sandwiches were liked by all!  Followed the recipe as written but realize there would be calorie savers if used low fat or "light" brands.

These were very yummy! I didn’t keep them open-faced; just used regular white sandwich bread, and cut each sandwich into four smaller squares. However, I still have about 8oz-10oz of the spread left, so I was thinking to pipe it on some crackers and and top it with smoked salmon. What do you all think?

I made these for a party. My guests loved them! 

The sandwiches looked elegant with fresh dill sprinkles and the sauce  had an unexpected tang. I used party-sized pumpernickel bread  and made no changes to the recipe.  I'll make this easy, very popular appetizer again and again.
