This batter bread was okay.  It didn't seem sweet enough and could have used more cinnamon.

Why the rating for this bread is onl three stars is beyond me. For me this bread is fantastic. Soft on the inside crunch on the outside. The only change I made was to add half raisins and half cranraisins. Will be baking this bread again as my wife can't stay away fgrom it.

I made this for some elderly people who have been having a rough time lately.  Valentine's Day was a perfect time to let them know they're still special.  They loved it!  In fact it was so well received I never even got a piece.  Why this poor little recipe has been languishing so long is a mystery to me.  It was so easy to make, I never even pulled out my mixer - I did it all by hand in no time flat.  It took about an hour to rise to the top of the pan but my kitchen was sort of cool.  I did increase the cinnamon to 2 tsp, but that was my only change.  Thank you Annette!

I made this for a special treat at work to serve on our coffee break. I have been searching for some years for Raisin batter bread that I loved as a kid made from the school cafeteria.  This one is still very yummy, but a little different in taste,as I remember the school cafeteria raisin batter bread was more buttery and the glaze was sweeter.I think I will make it for Christmas morning using a orange glaze next time I make it.

I was disappointed in this bread. It was quick and easy to make, but the texture was a little tough. (I did use 1 cup whole wheat flour and the rest white flour). Also it was not vey sweet, and for a raisin bread I would have liked it a little sweeter. I will not be making this again.

This is a delicious recipe. I added a little lemon zest to the batter and drizzled the melted butter on after the rising. I reduced the yeast a little so I could let it rise overnight in a cool room (around 60 degrees). All in all, the rise took 10 hours from the time I put it in the pan until I put it in the oven and it was perfect.  Baked for 36 minutes and we were VERY pleased with this breakfast bread. Will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing the recipe!
