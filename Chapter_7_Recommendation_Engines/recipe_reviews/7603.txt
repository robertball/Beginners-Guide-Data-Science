Excellent recipe. I used my own, frozen, raspberries for the entire recipe (since I didn't have any strawberries on hand). I didn't have any yogurt, either, so I replaced it with sour cream. It came out delicious (albeit with more calories per serving...).

I made the recipe exactly as written, except for reducing the cooking time significantly, as suggested by a previous reviewer. My buckle only needed 50 minutes. The reviewer who disliked this recipe the most thought the batter was too thick, and attempted to thin it out... ignore this suggestion, as buckle batters are generally more thick than most people are used to seeing. Also be sure to use non-expired baking powder or the buckle may collapse when removed from the oven... this would lead to a much less pleasant texture. Beware that the fresh baking powder increases the chances of the buckle overflowing the pan, and using another reviewer's suggesting of a higher-sided springform pan is a great way to avoid that problem.

1/2 butter, 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 3/4 cup plain yogurt, and an egg..... sound dry?  It sure was for me!  It kept crawling up my beaters like a heavy dough... I added about a cup of milk to this "batter" and still had to s-t-r-e-t-c-h it to smooth it in the pan.  The topping was less than thrilling.  The flavour, well, aside from the berries there was no flavour.  This was too dense and was not desert-like enough for me.  I will not make this again.  It wasn't horrible, it was edible and looked ok, but I don't want to have to keep trying different variations.  I will find a similar, but better recipe on this site.  Hubby and I both give it a 3.  Thanks anyway.

I don't know why my experience with this was so much different than most others, but for me this was a total flop on a number of fronts, some I should have anticipated. First, with a glass baking dish as this recipe calls for, the heat is too high - it should be reduced by 25 degrees to 350 degrees. Second, I am quite familar with buckles so I know the batter is thick - but this was even thicker than most, sticky, and difficult to spread. Third, for this size pan two pints of fruit is too much. Were I to make this again (and I'm sure I won't) I would either use half as much fruit, a pan with taller sides, or a larger pan altogether. I don't know if my pints are larger than others' pints, but this overflowed the pan and made a mess in my oven. (The bright side of that is that my oven got cleaned afterward) Finally, the baking time is off, particularly if you're using a glass pan - start checking this at 50 minutes, 25 minutes less than what the recipe states! Finally, the topping, which I assumed would be a streusel, is greasy, even to the touch, and unattractive. I was curious, so after this debacle I checked other, similar, recipes and sure enough, the butter should be HALF the amount called for! This was a disaster but sort of an ugly duckling (I'm wondering if this is why the only picture posted for this to date is by AllRecipes!) because it did taste good. This has potential if you care to work with it, but as written, with no changes, this is a very weak two stars.

This was a very good recipe but I didn't use neither raspberries nor strawberries, I used blueberries.  The only suggestions I have to make is that when you're making the topping do not use a half cup of butter because the topping will come out too moist.  I made several attempts at the topping until I realized that you only need to use a 1/4 cup of butter to get the right consistency for the topping.  Also the recipe says to bake the buckle for an hour and fifteen minutes but you only need to bake it a little over an hour.  Other than the few things I needed to change this was the best buckle recipe that I ever made.

This is the first buckle I've ever made.  It was a little hard to spread the batter, but the recipe is very versitale and I can see any number of fruits being used along with the strawberries and raspberries.  It smelled great in the oven and had a nice flavor - not too sweet.

Very good recipe-would suggest using a bigger baking dish, the one I made overflowed in the oven. Used half of the butter for the topping, raspberries, strawberries and blueberries, and buttermilk instead of yogurt  and it still tasted really good.  Will definitely make again!

Call it buckle, call it coffee cake.  Either way, this is a delicious cake to have for breakfast, with tea, or for dessert.  Only change was to reduce the butter in the topping to 1/4 of a cup.  Turned out perfectly.

I used fat free sour cream in place of the yogurt and raspberries and blueberries for the fruit -- I did not change the topping at all -- I used a springform pan and it was a little tough to spread but tasted delicious when it's done -- going to make another one using peaches this week! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with just fresh strawberries and everyone raved. I used a bundt pan and reversed the order of the layers. I put the crumb topping on the bottom, then the strawberries, and then the batter. I only had to cook it for 40 minutes. I let it cool for 20 minutes then turned the cake upside down on to a plate. Sprinkled powder sugar on top and it look great! Making it again today with mixed berries!

This is the only Buckle I have ever made. I used a 9'' springform pan, and about 1 1/2 pints of raspberries and 1/2 pint strawberries as it was all I had on hand. I was very pleased with the results, although, even cutting back on the butter somewhat, my crumb topping wasn't "crumby", and next time I will only use 1/4 cup. I will definetly be making this again, with the proper revision of 1/4 cup butter I expect 5 star buckle results :) Thanks Jackie!

Tastes delicious, but with that much 
butter it ought to.  It isn't too hard 
to make, just cleaning berries and 
stuff.  I found that cooking it for 
45 minutes was more than sufficient 
time.  The recipe calls for 75 minutes.
My Buckle would have been black by then.

It really is yummy.

So delicious! Even my picky eaters are eating this one! Like others said though, 1 hour 15 min is a bit too long. I should have taken it out after an hour.

I used blueberries and strawberries and prepared this in a springform pan for my sister's baby shower.  Beautiful presentation and tons of requests for the recipe.  Very good.

Fantastic! I loved it just the way it is.  But the best part is that it still tasted good after a few healthier modifications: I used whole wheat flour, halved the sugar and butter, added extra yogurt, and doubled the fruit and eggs and then served it to my kids as a healthy lunch.  It's great with blueberries, too.

This was delicious. Most of the people I served it to had never heard of a buckle, but I quickly converted them to buckle enthusiasts. This recipe is the perfect blend of tartness and sweetness. Really great as a coffee cake or as a dessert.

OMG, this was delicious!!  I had to use blueberries and strawberries instead of raspberries (my raspberries went bad) but it was amazing!  The flavor was superb.  
Thanks for everyone's reviews, I cut the butter in half (1/4c) for the crumble topping and it was perfect.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and cooked the buckle for only an hour.  Perfect!  One additional thing I did was to dust the berries with cinnamon and sugar before I put the crumble on top.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is absolutely delicious! Instead of using a flour crumble on top, we used rolled oats - everything else was the same. We also reduced the cook time to an hour and it turned out wonderfully.
Make this and you won't end up with something that will disappoint you.

Yum! I used this recipe with strawberries and pears, and it is wonderful.   The changes i made:  i used buttermilk instead of yogurt because of what i had available.  I also used a spring form pan since i didn't have the recommended size, and i saw the warnings from other reviewers.  I did use the full 1/2 cup of butter for the topping, and i baked it the full hour and 15 minutes.  After it cooled a few minutes, the spring form released very easily, leaving a very attractive cake.  I've never eaten anything like this, but i'm enjoying it immensely.  The cake is very fluffy and a great contrast to the tart sweetness of the fruit.  Coffee cake?  no, i don't think so.  This is in a class of a its own.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake (as most, with crumble toppings) doesn't look so hot the next day, but I keep toasting a piece and I'm surprised at how much I love it, each time.  Might try strawberries and wild Maine blueberries next time as I am not hot on the raspberry seeds.  This cake almost tastes like it has a little sour cream or cream cheese in it.  A really great coffee cake.  The topping is really good, but I will use 1/2 the butter next time (1/4 cup as previously suggested) - I also had problems with bubbling over and richness.  Really fast and easy to make, to boot!

I used all Strawberries and it turned out pretty good.  Next time I will mix the berries with the dough instead of spreading them on the top.

Great recipe for those summer months when strawberries and raspberries are easy to come buy. The entire office loved it!  I found that the topping wasn't "crumb like" next time I'll try it with less butter too - maybe that will make it drier.

I was skeptical after the reviews but I think this was really good.  I cut it to 8 servings since there’s only 2 of us.  Only real changes I made was called for 1/2 an egg.  I used the whole egg.  Frozen raspberries that I ran hot water onto loosen them up and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter.  Topping I used about 3 Tbsp of butter.  I will make this again!

Do wish I’d thought to place a baking sheet under the baking dish! Juices overflowed and burned in the oven. House filled with smoke. Well, we learned that our smoke alarms don’t work... Will make this again. (Added lemon and orange peel to the dough. Used brown sugar in the cake, white in the topping. Some WW flour in the dough.) Delicious!  (Note: I don’t see a print option on these recipes! Tried on my iPad and laptop. Frustrating!)

Went strawberry picking and had lots of fresh, ripe berries so I made this buckle.  Very easy recipe and suprisingly thick dough. It came out pretty good (the family loved it). I only baked mine 60 minutes and to be honest I think it should have come out even sooner.  Next time I'll start checking it at 50 minutes. I will also add some vanilla to the batter as I think it was missing that.  I followed others instructions to use 1/4 c butter in the topping and that was plenty. Good recipe that I will also try with other fruits. 5/19 made with 1 t vanilla and only baked 50 min it was perfect.

It was very good I added some buttermilk , vanilla, and more fruit to the top and used less butter. I baked mine in a deep round pan and cooked it for 70 min. It was very moist and yummy. I will make it again

I had it in for about 63 minutes and it burnt a little, but it was still very good.  Can't wait to try again with less time in the oven.  (Maybe because of higher altitude)

I followed the advice of one person and cut the butter and sugar in half and then doubled the egg & fruit  and added an extra 1/4 cup of yogurt. I also used whole wheat flour. It tasted good, but I gave it 5 stars because I imagine the way it is written it would be worthy of 5 stars. I give my healthier version 4 stars.

Wonderful recipe. I didn't have yogurt, so I used sour cream instead; and I used all strawberries because I didn't have any other fruit on hand. I made this 'buckle' for a church gathering yesterday and it was gone in seconds.  Everyone loved it and so many people asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing Jackie!

My whole family loved this. We ate it warm with vanilla ice cream. I didn't have strawberries so just doubled the raspberries.  Also, used lowfat vanilla yogurt. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Only cooked it for about 65 minutes and it was perfectly done. Easy as....pie! :)

First buckle cake I've made and tasted wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly as posted (minus the strawberries.. did not have them on hand.) As we waited for it in the oven, the aroma of baked raspberries filled our apartment. The cake was moist and very easy to make! Thanks for posting! :)

The very best! We love this and it is so simple to make. I whip it up whenever fresh berries are on sale and use it for weekend brunches.

Great recipe.  I barely had a chance to taste it, my family ate it all up.  I used less butter too (1/4 cup) also put a full cup of plain yogurt and a full teaspoon of cinnamon.  Also used a bit more flour for the topping (3/4 cup).  Very delicious!
