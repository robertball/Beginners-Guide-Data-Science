These are wonderful cookies.  I had lost my family recipe during a move and no one could tell this was not the genuine...I did have to watch the oven and bake a few minutes more...but that was probaly due to sea level....Try them you'll love them.

As suggested by another member, I used cranberries and pecans when I made this.  Also, I got lazy and made bars instead of cookies.  Baked for 35 minutes and topped with cream cheese frosting.  Delicious!

Just discovered we had some persimmon trees in our yard and was looking for persimmon recipes. Decided to try this one. Wow! They're awesome! I made them a little bigger than it said and they're almost like little muffins but still soooo good. Very simple and easy to make and delicious. And the house smells great!

Wanted to add raisins, but only added chocolate chips.  It was perfect!  Baked 13 minutes for soft cookies.

Although there are 3 or 4 Persimmon cookie recipe's listed, if you look at the ingredients they are almost identical! This one has a picture of the cookies with frosting, but no mention of it in the recipe! I made them, doubled the cinnamon and cloves, very moist, but not very flavorful. I put in lots of raisins and no nuts.  I'm going to try putting some cream cheese frosting on them.

They were ok but I doubt I will ever make them again. Not anything special.

The cookies are nice and soft...which I love. I added a bit more flour because I also added vanilla and a touch of nutmeg.. Next time, I'll add cranberries for more sweetness. I did dust them with powdered sugar, which helped. They would be great with nuts. But my daughter in-law is allergic to tree nuts. Also, this might just be a typo...the ingredients list baking powder, but the instructions don't indicate to add it to the flour mixture. I did, though. :)

This turned out great!  Used golden raisins and they tasted wonderful.
