I do this all the time! Grandma taught me to do this--it works with just about any liquor that you want to use and they always turn out fantastic. You can use a Ball Jar also, if you prefer. I like to use the infused vodka either as a base for drinks (along with the cherries) or as a flavoring for baked goods.

These cherries pack a punch! I tried one this morning, and it was yummy! I plan to bake with them. They'd be great with a pina colada or served over vanilla ice cream! I substituted Amaretto for whiskey because it's what I had on hand and the almond flavor is a good compliment for cherries.

I made my own versions of these for Christmas time. I used my favourite scotch whiskey and another batch using cherry brandy. I used the ones in scotch whiskey on ice cream and the brandy soaked ones in black forest cupcakes in place of the cherry topping which is sometimes "spiked" with kirsch liqueur. This is a nice alternative to plain cherries and can easily work with your favourite liqueurs. But I'd limit the taste combos with certain liqueurs, cause it can be a bad combo or too strong tasting.

Since I'm not much of a whiskey drinker, I use Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum instead. I've already ate one jar myself and made two other jars for co-workers. I have a virgin jar in the fridge calling my name as I type. LOL I think these would also be good with any shnapps flavor. 
I pour out all the juice (I save it in another jar), add the liquor to half full, then add some cherry juice back in. It's the perfect amount of liquor. I plan to use the liquor flavored cherry juice in other drinks after all the cherries are gone.

These are very good and do pack a punch!  They could be used in baked goods, of course in whiskey or other types of drinks and just for a quick treat when you need one! I saved the maraschino juice to experiment with in drink recipes from this site. I can also see trying this with other liqueurs as reviewers have mentioned, such as Amaretto, rum, etc.

Delicious!  ...but even better if you replace the bourbon with a good quality moonshine.
