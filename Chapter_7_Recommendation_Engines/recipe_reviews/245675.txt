Very tasty! I added quartered baby portobello mushrooms  and diced chicken sausage for some protein.  Then I sprinkled crushed red pepper before serving.  Excellent flavor!

This is a simple but delicious meal.  I added some minced garlic to the sautéed veggies for some extra flavor.  This was the first time that I have tried gluten free pasta and was very pleased with it.  My family did not even notice a difference.

I added red pepper flakes and garlic. Any veggie ie broccoli, red or yellow peppers would be great too. One suggestion would be to saute asparagus with the shallots for 4 minutes on med. high and add the tomatoes only for the last minute, since they cook fast. I also added 1/3 cup of pasta water. I'm not much of a meat eater so I really liked this!

Family liked it. I used gluten free pasta for my sensitive ones. I actually meant for this to be a cold salad, then absentmindedly began cooking the veggies and went with the recipe . I am going to try it cold next time!

Have you ever wondered what Italians eat for lunch? Well, look no further than this recipe. The simplicity of sautéed veggies and pasta tossed together are the epitome of Italian food. No extra seasonings or heavy creams here, just taste the fresh, crisp veggies and pasta. The fact that the pasta is gluten free is simply a footnote, a little scribble in the margin. This will please your GF group as well as your wheat eaters. :-) Thank you or the recipe.
