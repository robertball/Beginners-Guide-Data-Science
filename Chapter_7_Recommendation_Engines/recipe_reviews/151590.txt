Yummy! My men were VERY happy with this. I didn't have the roasted garlic mushroom soup so I used the reg CMS but threw in some roasted garlic that I had in the fridge. (I roast garlic by the head, keep it in the fridge and then use the cloves in cooking as needed.)

Good recipe just think boneless pork chops would be better especially when cooing for more than about 6 servings
