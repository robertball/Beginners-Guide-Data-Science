This is the best spinach I've ever tasted. Everyone loves it. I like to add extra garlic. Warming up the milk before you add it will help it to combine with the flour more easily.

This is just like Lawry's spinach at the restaurant.  Not very good for you, but for the holidays, it's a must!!!

This is an easy recipe for making delicious creamed spinach!  I also add Lawry's Seasoned salt to this for the extra Lawry's kick!

Maybe I'm judging this too hard b/c my grandma used to make the best creamed spinach, but I felt this recipe was lacking in flavor.  I even added garlic and more seasoning, but no "wow" factor.
