Indeed, this is exactly like Chevy's!  I was a bit troubled about the lengthy cooking time and knew it could be accomplished in the microwave in a fraction of the time.  These settings and times will differ from microwave to microwave, but I cooked the tomalito, covered, for 7 min. at 30% power and then 4 min. at full power.  It came out awesome after only 11 minutes.  Experiment, because this stellar recipe warrants being made often!  I originally rated this in June 2004 but wanted to make sure new viewers saw my microwave directions because they are soooo easy.

Gorgeous recipe! I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, substituted butter for the margarine, and used previous reviewers' suggestions for microwaving (7 min. at 30%, 4 min. at 100%). Cutting down the sugar lets us use it as a base for toppings (sliced jalapenos or salsa or seasoned meat) or even as a filling for tacos/burritos, without being too sweet. But when we want this for dessert, I bump it up to the 1/3 cup of sugar, and voila! Perfection. Thanks for the great recipe! (Oh, and btw, to other reviewers-- there really is no substitute for masa harina. It makes all the difference in this recipe.)

just like chevy's! i cut down the butter to make it healthier. i found that steaming this in a pie pan over a large soup pot allowed for the most even cooking.

This can also be cooked in the oven!  According to the Chevy's cookbook, you should cover the pan tightly with foil, place in a larger roasting pan, pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach 3/4" depth, and cook their Sweet Corn Tomalito in a 250 degree oven until a thermometer reads 175 degrees F (I assume when placed in the center of the casserole).  For a 13"x9"x2" pan of corn tomalito, this should take 1 1/2 - 2 hours, but it would probably take much less for an 8"x8" pan, I would guess 60-90 minutes.  Cooking over a pot of boiling water seems precarious, and I'm not a fan of cooking in the microwave, so this is the method I'm going to use.

This was SO good!! I used 1/4 c. of sugar and I use sweet frozen corn. It doesn't make much. I had to make a another batch cause the first one went by so fast! Very easy to make... I did it in the microwave. 7 minutes at 30% power, then 4 minutes at 100% power. Came out perfect!!
I also had some left over for the next day and it was a little dry. So I added a tablespoon of water and microwave it for a min and came out perfect again!!

This Recipe was taken an adapted from a Restaurant Called Chevy's original recipe.  Most people get confused with the Masa Harina.  This is simply "Corn Flour" ..  This Recipe is Great! Everyone should try it!  Its the kind of thing that you'll have to make for a large group of people.. consider how often do you use Cornflour and Cornmeal in everyday cooking?

GREAT! I have wanted a recipe for this for a long time.  I have now made it three times: the first was the agonizing steam method. Then I wised up and used the microwave.  A covered dish for 9-10 minutes on 90% gave me a great consistency.  

Wonderful recipe; my kids, including the 9-month-old, just loved it.

Yummy, perfect for a mexican dinner!  I tried the microwave method with wax paper over the top, a little too crumbly, a covered dish would work better to hold in the moisture.

This stuff is great!! Just like what they serve at Chevy's. I used canned corn instead of frozen and it worked just fine. It was a tad sweeter than I like, maybe due to the corn which was itself quite sweet. I'll cut the sugar down next time. I also think I'll cut the butter in half to make it a bit healthier. 5T seemed excessive. Overall a great recipe!

I halved the recipe and cooked it in the microwave using 7 mins at 30% then 4 mins at 100%, as suggested in another review.  That overcooked it and made the tomalito really tough in pockets.  Next time I'll make the full recipe.  This recipe doesn't make enough to warrant halving it.

This recipe was wonderful.  Easy to make, but took a while to cook.  It taste amazing and is a perfect side dish for a fiesta.  My family didn't like the whole corn in it though, so next time I will blend all the corn instead of half to make it smother.  Over all it is to die for!!!

Made this for dinner tonight.  I was skeptical - but I read lots of reviews, and it turned out just like what I get at my neighborhood Chevy's!  I didn't want to run out for masa harina, so I took a chance and used regular ol' flour, and it was fine.  I used 1 can of corn, drained, using the liquid in place of the water.  Cooked in the microwave tightly covered for 3 sets of 3 minutes, stirring really well in between, and then finished in the oven tightly covered for about 10 minutes.  Also used butter and cream for the margarine and milk.  Thanks for a great recipe, we loved this!

Love, love, love it! I served this as a side with beef enchiladas and a salad. I was shocked to find just before dinner that I was out of masa harina, so took a chance and used GF Bisquik. No worries! It was perfect. I followed MCKARIN's method and nuked it. My microwave may have higher wattage (or maybe it was the Bisquik) but I did have to add more milk to keep it from getting too dry. So simple, so tasty, even with my major error. Winner!

I did not understand the cooking directions at all! It sounded like put a pan on top of a pot? So, I then followed the rest of the directions. And, I used a hand-emulsion blender for ease. To cook it I used a water bath method of another similar sweet corn pudding recipe on here. When done baking to thicken it up a little more, I then put it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and microwaved it a tad. It appeared more like what I thought it should, but then it got really "dry." The original directions really need to make this clear on how to cook this! I really like anything corn, but this is just not something I would make again. Although, a lot of people may like it I think sweet corn cake, might just not be for me, as it is too heavy, greasy, and  sweet.

Houston we have a problem... 

This recipe is delicious and so easy to make (maybe too easy!).  

The first time I made the recipe it took about an hour in the steamer to cook.  This morning I made it again using the microwave method to see if the results were different.  They weren't.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and cooked it at 30% for 7 minutes and 100% for 4 minutes.  There was a "soft spot" in the center, maybe it needed 4 1/2 minutes.  I just tossed the mixture with a fork and it was fine.  Loved it with a poached egg for breakfast!

This stuff is phenomenal! My husband and I love Chevy's. We have always loved the tomalito they serve. I was so excited to find this recipe! One thing worth noting: I doubled the recipe amount and I had to steam it for an hour and a half. I also added about 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and it was delicious. I will for sure make this again.

Great recipe! I didn't downsize the amount of sugar because I wanted to see just how sweet it is and I thought that it was perfect! Thank you for sharing! I would and will definitely make this again.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out perfectly, cooked in the microwave as suggested by the other reviewers.  Nice alternative to corn casseroles.

This is an amazing dish.  You can make this to go with amost anything, but it is best with some sort of Mexican dish.  It is easy to do, even for the beginning cook.  It tastes amazing and I got so many compliments about it!

Delicious!  I usually double the recipe & put it into a greased 9x13" glass dish which I set into a 11x17" glass dish filled with hot water.  Then bake at 250 degrees till internal temp is 175 degrees.  Then I cut into squares, cool & freeze.  We can then take out a couple of squares, microwave, and have for lunch usually with a nice salad or cooked veggie - YUM!!

I halved this recipe, as there were only two of us, and it was perfect.  It's very very similar to Chevy's.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Very simple to make.  I was confused about masa harina.  I used what I had, "harina," which was flour-tortilla flour.  It turned out fine.  Very Yummy!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe

This was delicious. I didn't have cornmeal so I made it w/o and it still turned out great. I will definitely be making this again but next time with the cornmeal, a little less sugar and butter instead of margarine. I made it in the oven using the "bath" method and worked great!

I could not wait to try this recipe, as a true Chevy's fan..   I forgot corn at the grocery store, so I did luckily have a can of creamed corn on hand.  I mixed all ingredients and cooked in the microwave w/ tight saran wrap for 4 mins, stirred thoroughly, cooked for another 3 mins, stopped to stir again, then another 2 mins.  It was absolutely PERFECT and hubby said was better than Chevy's!  LOVE this recipe and will w/out a doubt be making it often for our "Mexican Monday" dinners!

WOW! This is so good! I never had the stuff at Chevy's but it reminds me of the tamales at Cheesecake Factory. I drizzled some sour cream on top after scooping it out. It tastes like cornbread pudding. It takes over an hour but it's not constant labor... you just let it sit on the stove. No biggie. IT'S WORTH IT!!

Great recipe! Especially for those of us who have wheat issues! I've gotten where I use masa harina (corn flour) for many wheat substitutions.

I was craving this tonight but the only cornmeal-like ingredient I had was some instant polenta.  I put 4 Tbs butter, 1 c water, 1 c 2% mil, and 1/3 c sugar in a saucepan, brought it to a boil, and slowly mixed in 1/2 c polenta.  Stir constantly over heat until it thickens, then let set in the pan for a few mins.  Not as good as the real thing, but it definitely hit the spot!

I was craving this and did not have masa harina or cornmeal. So I used Trader Joe's cornbread mix. I measured out the mix accordingly in place of all the dry ingredients... as if I was using the harina, cornmeal, sugar, salt, etc. I followed the recipe for the wet ingredients. I also cooked it in the microwave for 7 mins on 30% and 4 mins on 100%. It was great!!! I got my fix. It doesn't have that authentic mexican taste without the harina, but it was good enough for me on this day!

This turned out very good.  My whole family liked it.  I served with carnita tacos.  I too used a pie plate and had to cook for a total of 1 hour 20 minutes as it was not set after one hour.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/4.  Next time I will add some fresh sliced jalapeno. I will for sure make again.

I would give this 5 stars for taste and 1 star for the directions being unclear, so I'm compromising with 3 stars. It tasted great. Nice and light texture, great flavor. But I had no clue what the instructions meant. Was I supposed to put it in a water bath in a skillet on the stove top? Was I supposed to cook it like in a double boiler type set up? Was I supposed to put a rack over a pan of water and put it on the rack? Please make the directions more clear or someone enlighten me.  I ended up putting it in a water bath in the oven at 375 and it was just fine. I'll do that from now on, but I had to do some googling to come to that solution because while I'm not a novice baker, I'm not an expert either. Microwaving is not an option for us.

Over the years, I've tried to locate a recipe for the tomalito they serve at Chevy's, and at last I've found it.  I always asked for a side of tomalito if my dish didn't come with it, so I m just thrilled.  Putting it in the microwave definitely worked and obviously reduces the cooking time considerably.  An excellent recipe and one that I'll make regularly from now on.

As mentioned before, this is an incredible recipe!  The time involved, even for a small group or couple, is well worth the effort.  It is particularly good after sitting the first day.  I own the “Chevy's Cookbook,” and I tried their original recipe.  This one is far superior!

Suggestions:  I add a thimble or two of vanilla for some extra kick.  In addition, I intend on utilizing Splenda sweetener rather than sugar, as my wife is diabetic.

Thanks to the other reviewers for their practical hints!  Get cookin!

I love this dish!  The only change I tried was not thawing the corn, which, for some reason, made it lighter in texture, fluffier.  I won't go back to thawing the corn!  Thanks for the recipe.

Not sure  if it was because I didn't have a double boiler or not and had to improvise, but it took almost 2 hours to cook.  Well worth the wait though it turned out fantastic!

This was absolutely delicious.  I served it as a side dish to Dr. Pepper Pork, a good braised pork recipe on the Pioneer Woman website (pork shoulder braised in chipotles w/adobo sauce, Dr. Pepper & brown sugar, 300* for 7 hours) and it was a wonderful contrast to the spicy pork burritos.  Easy to make, even though I needed to use both my KA and my mini-processor (lots of cleanup!).  The cornmeal mixture in the processor never did become "smooth" (I used a medium coarse cornmeal), but that made no difference.  We all loved it, and I'll make it every time I do a Mexican or Tex-Mex dinner!

Excellent! This has been my most desired recipe for a long time. I used to go to Chevy's just so I could have my Tomalito...Im sure some old employee gave this recipe away.

This dish was delicious.  I didn't do the stove top method.  I put the baking dish in a pan of water in the oven. I stole that idea from a similiar recipe. Seemed easier and cooked great.

This is absolutely delicious!  Soft, warm, sweet....total comfort food~ While I've not made it using the traditional 'steaming' method, I cannot comment on how that turns out vs. the microwave method.  I was completely happy with the texture of the dish and speed microwave cooking, given by the other reviewer. I did cut the sugar to 1/4 c. and it was still satisfyingly sweet!  I also opted for frozen white sweet corn (shoepeg) and used 1/2 c. of lowfat milk instead of water to puree the 1 c of corn.  (I had seen milk used in a recipe from Mexico.)  This recipe is fantastic!

I am always asked either to give the recipe or bring the dish!  I microwave it, or cook, tightly covered in the oven.  I have never steamed it.  I use real butter and canned corn.

Very tasty, indeed! Very similar to Chevy's version.  You can get masa harina (corn flour) in the Hispanic section of any grocery store I've been to. I've made this recipe a few times, the last time I followed it exactly. The amount of sugar is necessary if you want this to be a sweet desert sort of thing.  I think next time I'll cut the margarine in half, though-- it's really not necessary, and it'll be a lot healthier that way. It was slightly overcooked at 7 minutes 30% power, 4 minutes 100% power in my 1100 watt microwave. Next time I'm going to do 7 minutes 30% power, 3 minutes 100%-- I think that will turn out perfectly. Delicious recipe, thanks for posting, TheKirklands!

My husband, children and neighbors all loved it.   Tastes just like the sweet corn cake at ChiChi's.  Excellent side to any mexican meal.  I did not try steaming it on top of the stove, but the microwave hint worked like a charm.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I originally gave this 3 stars, but I'm bumping it to four.  It's really grown on me, thanks to some suggestions.  I cut the butter to 3T, the sugar to 1/4 cup (which still might be too much), skim milk, and I've used a can of creamed corn instead of 2C of frozen whole-kernel.  Microwave method has worked great for me, though I've generally had to keep microwaving at 100% for longer than seven minutes.  I just stir it every minute or so, then pop it back in, until it's the right thickness.

Great! I couldn't find masa at my local grocery store (super duper small town America) so I subbed Jiffy corn muffin mix and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup.  Steamed this for about an hour and a half and it was perfect.

Delicious.

This recipe takes a bit of time and attention.  I had planned on making it for a large party but will defer since the time at the stove is lengthy.

I used fresh corn rather then the frozen as suggested and doubled the recipe.  Everyone loved it.

I'm english and live in england so i'd never heard of this or eaten at Chevys, but having recently discovered cornbread, and creamed corn i thought i'd give this a go.  Personally i thought it was a tad sweet and i'll reduce the sugar next time, but apart from that i could eat this stuff straight out of the bowl with a spoon its so good.  As for cooking, i poured the mixture into a glass bowl, covered it with foil and then placed it into a steamer, as thats how we'd cook a sponge pudding or a christmas pudding here in england.  By steamer i mean a large saucepan or stockpot with a steamer insert and lid. Hope that helps.

I really liked this one- it was the first time I made, but I was pleased w/ the results. I think next tiem though I'd like to add some peppers or something else to add a little zest- and then I'll reduce the sugar content (I already did in this version as well).  Great side dish for shredded beef.

Yummy! I did it in the microwave as others have suggested and it was a bit underdone. Still tasted fantastic, though.

Don't let this prep time fool you as you can cook it in the microwave also. As suggested, I decreased the amount of sugar. It IS a sure hit - and although I am not a known cooker in my circle of friends, this recipe made them think I was!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. I used butter instead of margarine and it turned out wonderful. Can't wait to make it again. Actually went to Chevy's last night and I liked mine (from this recipe) better!

I came across Sweet Corn Tomalitos in a Mexican restaurant and always ordered it as a side when eating there. Imagine my excitement when I found this recipe. I have made the dish on a number of occasions for family and friends now. Everybody loves them and asks for the recipe. Since I can meet my craving for it now at home we also save money by not dining out. Many thanks to the Kirklands

AWESOME!  Just like Chevy's, and trust me, I go to Chevy's twice a month and that's the highlight of my meal.  Thank you to MCKARIN for telling us about making it in the Microwave.  That idea rocks!  Doing it with water is a pain.  Thanks for coming back so many years later so we can all find out!

Very good but next time I think I'll stick to butter (I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and that was all I could taste!) and the cornmeal seemed to make it a little too gritty for me. I think I'll just all masa harina and see how that works out.

This is so good!!!  I followed the recipe exactly (not my normal mode of operation) and it was perfect.  Made the batch for 8 servings and my husband and I inhaled it.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for posting!

The color was a little different than chevy's, but the taste was very similar. I used masa for tamales instead of masa harina, and creamed corn instead of fresh. Followed the microwave instructions, and it was delicious.

Just great. Never made it before, but turned out just like we have had in a favorite Mexican restaurant. Only change was the margarine, only had butter. Darn it! Other than that, followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Delicious. DH would not stop picking at it before dinner! Yes, will make it again.

I used the readers suggestion and cooked mine in the microwave.  The center didn't want to 'firm up' and I ended up having to stir it.  Then it was almost over cooked.  Also I put a diced and seeded jalapeno in the mix.  Not sure I'll make this one again.

¡Fabuloso! I followed the recipe to a T, short of using the microwave method of cooking it (Thank you MCKARIN for the exact directions on that one). This recipe rocks! My whole family—even my 2&1/2 year old—gobbled it up.

Yum- never been to Chevy's but worked at Cheesecake Factory and these are very similar to their Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes.  I have always made this in the microwave and it turns out everytime.

Awesome. I followed the recipe to a T. I didn't use the microwave method as suggested by so many others. I put the tomalito in small casserole pans and put the pans in a larger baking pan filled a quarter of the way with water. The water at the bottom of the large pan helped steam the recipe. The recipe came out perfect. I added a touch of honey butter to the top. Wonderful.

Made a vegan version. Switched margarine to Earth Balance and used soy milk instead and I didn't tell people at the BBQ and they LOVED IT! I'm making it again tonight. Super easy.

This one is a winner!  I followed others advice and did 7 minutes at 30% power and 3 minutes at 100% power while it was covered in saran wrap.  My husband and kids gobbled it up.  I mixed everything in a food processor,  didn't waste time with extra bowls.  Even added the baking powder etc. in the processor at the end and then just folded in the last of the corn.  Hubby and kids thought there was too much extra corn, so the second time I chopped up 1.5 cups and folded in 0.5 cup.  Great recipe!

I thought this was really good...almost as good as Chevy's tomalito.  Mine came out a bit dry, so I might have microwaved it a little too long.  Very good though!

Used the microwave version people suggested.  Can definitely cut a lot of the butter and sugar out and maybe even add more corn for a healthier version and its just as good!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I am a tomalito-only eater at Chevys and I don't think I will ever need to go back now! I tweaked the recipe a bit, based on other reviewers, as well. I like my tomalito wetter and almost raw tasting (like they have it at Chevys). So, I cooked mine on power 3 for 9 minutes and cooked on full power for 1-2 minutes. That gave the best consistency. I also added about 1/4 milk, to make it more moist. And, I also put 3/4 of the corn in the blender, that makes for less corniness. Since I found this recipe, I've tried it 5 times, changing little things here and there. Delicious!

Had some difficulty with cooking it in the micro...  Next time I'll just pop it into the veg steamer or slow cooker.  Got fluffy and cooked on edges...soupy in middle. hmm, tastes wonderful tho!

I really like this...  My husband really doesn't.  I have been making this for years now...  I usually make it to put under chili, but it's almost sweet enough to make into a dessert.  I use the microwave method of cooking, as do others, in a glass lidded casserole dish.  It always turns out moist, with no dry pockets, but I do stir it a bit during cooking.  I sometimes add creamed corn if I have it and cut back on some of the other liquids.  Makes a small enough amount that I don't mind making it even when I know I'll be the only one eating it.

This received rave reviews from everyone at our potluck.  I used the suggested microwave method and was not disappointed.  This was very easy, fast, and quite delicious.  My husband got barely a taste at the potluck, so I made it again the next night, and my family gave it high marks, too.  This is a keeper.

Yes, this was very good with only 1/4 cup sugar.  I also cooked mine in the microwave like some others have suggested, and it was just fine.  Thank you.

Tastes just like the Tomalito I've had at Chevy's! In fact, I love that restaurant for the tomalito in itself! First of all, I doubled the recipe so I'd have plenty left over as well.  I was able to purchase the corn flour at my usual grocery store. I followed the advice of many of the previous posters about using the microwave however, I definitely had to cook mine for longer than was suggested.  I believe you'll just have to play around with whatever works. The end result is a little grainy and a little dry... but quite honestly its delicious! I will definitely be making this again and I'm sure it'll get better the more I learn about my microwave!

The first time I made this, I made it as directed and still wasn't cooked through after 75 minutes.  I had to finish it in the microwave.  The next time I made it, I used the microwave (covered with press n seal).  I set it at 500watts for 5 minutes then full power for 2.5 minutes.  Stirring between cycles.  It's so easy and tastes great.  Never have left overs.

Just like at Chevy's! I used the microwave method (7 mins at 30%, 4 mins at 100%), covering the 8x8 pyrex with saran wrap to keep the moisture in. Ate half the batch in one sitting! Oops!

Much less time consuming if you just microwave it. I wet a paper towel, squeezed the excess water and put it over the 8x8 to create a steaming effect in the microwave. Only took 2-3 minutes after my failed attempts steaming over a boiling pot of water. Very tasty!!!

Just like Chevys'! Perfect. I tried the microwave version mentioned by other reviewers: 7 minutes at 30% power, then 4 minutes at 100% power. The center was still goopy so I stirred it up and cooked it another minute at 30% power and it was just right.  Would definitely make this again... so easy to make!!

Cut the sugar in half, and it was still way too sweet for us. I used the microwave method, and texture-wise, it came out fine.

This is SOOO GOOD!!! Tastes just like Chevy's (why did they all close down?)

I used 1/2 cornmeal and 1/2 flour to make masa harina since I did not have any.

Came out great, Thanks for the great recipe Eric!

This is just like the tomalito at Chevys!  I used Green Giant's Gold & White corn (which is sweeter than most other frozen corn).  Also, I would strongly recommend following the other reviewers' microwave directions.  It's fast and turns out just as well.  Also, I cut the margarine in half.  Great with chicken enchiladas.

Tasted great....just like Chevy's.  My only complaint....it took about twice as long to cook as the recipe suggested.  Other than that, wonderful!

I was really skeptical but it far exceeded my expectations.  The entire family loved it.  Next time, I must double the recipe as we are a family of eight and there was a definitely a need for seconds.  I made the recipe exactly as written.

Yum yum yum! Just like Chevy's. I followed another review that suggested 90% power for 10 minutes in the microwave. Turned out perfectly fluffy and sweet. I will make this again for sure!

This recipe is so good I wanted to eat the entire pan! I did bake it in the oven in a water bathe because I can't be trusted with a double boiler for 60 min. Very easy to make and it reminds me of corn cakes that a Mexican restaruant served before it closed down. So glad to have the recipe, thanks for sharing!

I made this last night as a change from the corn bread that I usually serve when I make black bean soup.  The family loved it and I will definitely make it again sometime.  I did make in the microwave like one of the other reviews said and because I'd doubled the recipe had to cook it longer, but it turned out just fine.  It was probably a touch more dense than the steamed version would be, but it was still tasty.  We had the leftovers for breakfast (warmed with a little milk on top) and it was good as that too.

Better than cornbread, so said my son, and everyone else loved this too!  Served up a small helping on one side of the plate, a large serving of salad on the other side of the plate, placed sliced chicken breasts over the middle of the plate overlapping some of the tomalito and some of the salad, then topped all of that with:  salsa verde, mexican styled carrots, jalapenos and onions like from restaurants, caramlzd onions, fresh sliced grn onions, tom's, chs etc/Made two batches, using less sugar for one batch, and more for the other batch.  We preferred less sugar and, in our home, we do not consider this to be a dessert.  STEAMED ONE BATCH, MICROWAVED THE OTHER -- FOR US, THE STEAMED BATCH WAS BY FAR THE BEST.  It was more of a pudding texture - lighter and airier than cornbread, but still more of a pudding than a bread, while the zapped batch was very much more like a cornbread.  Perhaps if we zapped it way less, it might still be a pudding?, but we only zapped this a total of 6 1/2 minutes?  //  We used a Dutch oven on the stove top - with a solid strainer overturned in the bottom of the Dutch oven in order to lift the casserole off the bottom of the pan.  We put the pudding into a souffle dish and set it on the strainer; then covered with foil.  We put in about 1" of water, checked halfway through and had to add more.  There was time involved, but it was utterly lovely.  Will try in a crockpot next time.  I hope that works well too!  Thanks Kirklands, for a great recipe!

Made this for the first time last night and I'm already planning on making it again! It was wonderful! 

I first used a makeshift double broiler to heat the tomalito, but after an hour, it still wasn't done. I popped it in the microwave for 3 minutes at 100% and it was done! Next time, I'll try cooking the entire thing in the microwave. It will definitely help with the amount of dishes!

This recipe tastes exactly like Chevy's tomalito! I followed MCKARIN's advice and microwaved it in a fraction of the time. The whole family loves it and asks for it often. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  I did make a few changes like others did.  I used 8 oz of frozen corn and one can of creamed corn.  I didn't put the corn in the food processor but left it whole.  I used cream instead of milk and added 1/4 cup of water to it insteadof the 1/2 cup.  I microwaved it and it came out perfect.  So delicious and will def. make it again!!

Delicious and easy! I followed the advice of the previous reviewer who suggested cooking in the microwave for 7 min on 30% power and then 4 minutes on full power. I'll have to add this to my Thanksgiving repertoire. :)

This was excellent! I made it just as listed and everything turned out great. I did have to steam it a bit longer than an hour, but my pan was too big for my pot. Super easy and the best corn pudding I've ever made!

I loved this.  Tastes very authentic.  Like most people I cooked it in the microwave - 7 minutes at 30% and another four minutes at full blast.  Came out absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this again, especially if I'm going for an all-Mexican meal.  Thanks!

There's no way to criticize this one.  I tried it to satisfy our love of the too small of a dolop at Chevy's.  I've made it for our annual camping potlucks, at the neighbors mexican fiesta, for our own gatherings and I have never not had "oh my gosh that's good", and overheard  "did you get some of that" compliments.  People are starting to look for it if the theme is mexican and my double batch is gone FAST.  I know I "better" bring it lol.

I used the microwave method because I wanted to make this quickly.  I was very excited when I first tried it.  This is going to be added to my Taco and nacho nights.  My husband was thrilled because he loves it at Chevy's.  Thanks so much.

Very Good recipe and so easy.  Used others advice and microwaved- it turned out perfectly (7 minutes at 30% and 4 at 100%).  We have already made it two times in three days.  Also...used instant corn flour- it was acould find.  Just like Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes from Cheesecake Factory.

This is SO good and easy to make.  I used other's suggestions to cook in the microwave and did just that.  I had to cook it a little longer than 11 min, but it turned out beautifully!  A big hit at our dinner table.

I can't get enough of this dish! You can also used canned corn (I used sweet, crisp corn), not creamed corn though. I also followed the microwave cooking technique other user's suggested . . . cook for 7 minutes on 30% power and cook for 4 minutes on 100% power. Wonderful and delicious!

I'd never heard of this, but since everyone loves corn I thought I'd try it! It was a really good alternative to plain corn & everyone ate it. Even my picky one tried it. It was nice to try something different. Thank you.

I've never had this at Chevy's, but thought I would try it anyway.  It is delicious!  I will be making this every time I make mexican.  I used the microwave method as described in other reviews, and it worked great.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Cooking method made all the difference for me. The first time I made it, I used the microwave. I wasn't impressed because it was grainy and dry. This time, I placed tin foil in the bottom of a pasta pot, placed the tomalito on top of the foil and then placed the pasta pot into a larger pot with simmering hot water and then covered it with the pan lid. It was moist, cooked well and delicious with the stovetop method. Great recipe!

This was AMAZING! I followed directions exactly except for cooking...I covered with foil, baked in the oven @ 350, for 60 min in a water bath (for 4 servings). It came out perfect! Served with Polenta & Vegetable Casserole, Mexican Rice II, Best Guacamole & of course some Margaritas! Thanks so much for sharing! :)

Great recipe!  I actually baked this in the oven instead of on the stovetop.  I placed my dish inside a larger dish filled with hot water and put foil tightly over the top.  Bake at 250 for 2 hours.  YUM!

This was excellent! Everyone loved it, but I think I might cut down on the sugar a little bit next time since I used sweet white corn. Plus, I had to finish it up in the oven (don't own a microwave). 300 degrees for a few minutes (just check on it every now and then).

Delicious recipe but it takes a long time to steam. Finally, I just took the top off and turned off the heat and it thickened up really quick once I stirred it!

This was really delicous.  Thank you to the earlier reviewer that said Masa Harina was cornflour, without that advice I would not of been able to make this recipe. I also slightly stuffed up by blending all the corn.  The microwave is definatley the way to go.

This was superb. If you use cream-style corn it actually tastes better, a little sweeter and richer.

I wish there was a higher rating than a 5!!!!  This is my new favorite food.  Leftovers are good cold or hot.  My boyfreind was scared to try it, but ended up eating an entire plate full!!!  I tried to convince him it was a side dish, but he loved it too much to just eat a little bit :-D

I previously gave this 4 stars but I made it again and I'm changing my review. I tried the microwave directions posted by another reviewer and it came out wonderfully!! It tastes just as good or better when cooked in the microwave and it took me about 1/10 the time it took me to cook it on the stove. I was concerned when I first took it out of the microwave because the center wasn't quite done but after I stirred it up and it sat for a couple minutes, it was just right. EXCELLENT recipe!

I was THRILLED to find this, as I loved the tomalito served at Chevy's but couldn't find a recipe that matched it in flavor. This has the same sweetness and texture as the tomalito served at Chevy's. Thank you for posting!!

This is absolutely fabulous!!!  It tastes EXACTLY like the side dish served at both Chevy's and Don Pablo's.  I made it for friends when we had a mexican night, and it was the talk of the table.  I will be making this dish again and again.

Whenever I would go to Chevy's (or "Rio Bravo" what I understand the East Coast counterpart is) I would always order extra and for so long I wondered if I could make this myself no thanks to the employees at Chevy's who were always cryptic about even the name. I wish I could "AHA!" them because this recipe is spot on! My big blended family of 7 loves everything corn, we always have Masa (we make a lot of homemade tortillas and sopes), cornmeal, and fresh/canned corn on hand. I don't at all mind the cooking time, its pretty easy to do, and being familiar with a slow cooker makes waiting just over an hour for this chump change. Last night we ate this with a rotisserie chicken and some mashed potatoes and before I could even serve myself it was practically gone. My 10 month old daughter loved it too! I will be making this to accompany many dinners in the future. Thank you thank you thank you THEKIRKLANDS, you are my hero.

(Edit:Also another reviewer mentioned how often do you have cornmeal and masa on hand, well consider adding both to your repetoire because they are exceptionally versatile. Masa makes wonderful homemade tortillas, sopes, and many other imaginitive things up to sweet corn cookies, and cornmeal is great for cornbread, frying fish, and is a great addition to pizza dough.)

Great recipe- very close to Chevy's.  Per advise from another reviewer, I always microwave it.  Takes about 10 minutes, covered with plastic wrap.   I also skip the frozen corn in the food processor bit and instead, use 2 cans of creamed corn, because of this, I omit the water as well.... Perfect!  I have made this several times- everyone loves it!

This has become a staple for Thanksgiving dinner. High honor as the only change in the menu for over 20 years. Be careful not to overlook; it can dry out quickly.

Don't let the long list of ingredients intimidate you! I easily found all the ingredients at local grocey chain store. I don't have a food processor and I do have a blender but it's still in the box and I waas too lazy to get it out because I was in a hurry. I used drained, canned corn and only one can. The microwave directions were perfect. Microwaved it for 9 minutes at 90% power (although my sister inadvertantly set the microwave for 50 minutes which could have been a disaster...)

Only giving it 4 stars b/c it came out a little bitter - not sure if I did something wrong.  Highly possible.  Good texture and overall flavor.  I'll make it and re-rate it again!

This is a DANGEROUS recipe. I followed the directions exactly and my Pyrex 8x8 in pan shifted, fell in the water, destroyed the recipe, and destroyed other recipes I had cooking on the stove at the same time, not to mention burning me. I have made similar recipes in the oven and did not notice this was a no-bake.

Really easy and everyone liked it!  I  make it as a side, and I think I will try to double the recipe next time and hope for leftovers.  
Changes I used:  didn't have corn flour, so I used regular flour, I cooked this in the microwave stirring frequently, I used more of the total corn kernels (canned) in the blender and that left less whole pieces to add in (resulting in a smoother texture), after cooking and cooling a bit I rolled it into balls and rolled the balls in powdered sugar.

This recipe is really quite good, although time consuming when using the steaming process the recipe calls for.   Like another poster said - I used all masa harina instead of adding cornmeal and it turned out very smooth.
My local grocery store only had "instant corn flour" (masa harina instant) and it still worked out.

very good. I used polenta instead of the cornmeal because I was out of it, and sour cream for the milk. Everyone loved it. You don't need much because it is sweet and tasty. I used the microwave version, but I would like to try it in a rice cooker.

love love love it!  i made this recipe twice...once in the microwave and once steamed.  the steamed recipe came out much better...if you can, take the time to steam this.  the texture is so much smoother than when you microwave it.  i would not change a thing!  thanks for a great recipe!!!

Who hoo!  I've been looking for this recipes for years!!  It is exactly how I remember at Mex restaurants and I am sooo happy about that.  I used a can of sweet corn and used the cans water and it came out great.  I like it very corny and sweet. The microwave trick worked just fine. Yum!!!!  Thank you so much.

I've never made anything like this before and was so impressed with how it turned out!  Also, my 15 month old LOVED it!  While the steaming method looks intimidating (at least it did to me!) I went with that since it was my first time with the recipe.  It actually wasn't difficult at all - I used a glass pie dish instead of an 8x8 to fit into my largest frying pan to steam. Love this recipe - it will be a regular side to my chicken enchiladas now!

Pretty darned good!  I microwaved the 7 minutes at 30% power, then 4 minutes at 100% power and it came out perfect.  You don't find this too often here in Florida but in California and Texas it was common to get a dollop of this on the side of a Mexican plate.  Kudos to the previous reviewer for the microwave directions.  Never would have thought of that.

My boyfriend thought that it was an unusual texture at first but he went back for seconds...and thirds.  Very tasty!

My family loved this!  I was a bit suprised with the cooking method but it cooked right up and didn't creat a mess.  It was a fun addition to our dinner.

Mine didn't firm up as nicely as I'd have liked.  The flavor was wonderful.  I'll try cooking it longer next time.  Thank You!

This dish was alright.  I added less sugar but I still found it too sweet for my liking.  As suggested before, I used 1/2 cornmeal + 1/2 flour to make the masa harina as I don't have any.  As well I made this in the microwave rather than steaming.  Won't make this again.

I used creamed corn, and didnt add the extra water. I also cooked it in the microwave, although I may use the oven next time. It was excellent, and comparable to the sweet corn cake I get at Don Pablos or at Chi Chis. Thanks!

Yes, thank you.  It was excatly what I was looking for.  My husband has always loved Chevy's dish so I thought I would surprise him with it.  He loved it!!  I didn't know what masa harina was.  I did find Instant Corn Masa Mix and it worked.  I cooked the Sweet Corn Tomalito in the microwave for the 7 and 4 and it worked very well.  Thanks to all.

Excellent recipe!  It's very similar to the "sweet corn tamale cakes" at the Cheesecake Factory.  Easy, too, in the microwave.  Mine took a little longer than the 11 min. mentioned in the other post.  I did 7 min. at 30% and about 7 on high.  My husband said he would add more sugar or some honey next time.  He wanted it a little sweeter.  We took it to a party and had several requests for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Eric.

This was wonderful!  I used butter, and 1/2 sugar and 1/2 honey.  I also used canned corn and canned cream corn.  Very forgiving recipe with all my changes it was still great.  The only problem I have is that you cant eat more than a scoop - it's sooo rich.  I served it with the famous "burrito pie" also found on this site.  I wonder if it freezes?

Very very good!  I bought masa harina just for this recipe so I'm sure I'll be making it often.  It tasted just like I expected it to after reading all the reviews.  The only thing I did differently was use butter instead of margarine.

SO GOOD! Just like Chevy's! I did make one change, I pureed all of the corn-I don't like the texture with some whole corn kernels. That may just be a "me" thing though....

This was delicious! Just like the tomalito at Chevy's. I didn't have masa harina, and substituted equal amounts of corn meal. I tried the mircowave version, and it worked perfectly. It was like a moist, sweet cornbread. This will definitely do in my recipe collection!

I'm really happy to find this recipe as my husband and I always like the Chevys tomalito. However in my excitement I forgot to measure the butter and instead used one full stick of butter lol. I wasn't afraid of it drying out at this point. I don't like whole pieces of corn so I took a handful and rough chopped it and blended the rest. I use the microwave method and it came out great and saved time which is a necessity with a toddler. I will be making it again and again!

Cooked it in microwave, turned out delicious! Everyone from toddlers to old folks loved it. Pan was scraped clean both times I made the recipe, so not sure how leftovers would taste but I'm guessing they'd be awesome too.

This tastes just like Chevy’s recipe!  I was so happy I could finally make this at home!  I usually talk my kids out of theirs at Chevy’s because it’s my favorite!  Like Mckarin’s review suggested, I followed the microwave instructions, covered for 7 min at 30% power then 4 min at full power, and it turned out perfect in just 11 minutes!

I made this twice and though the taste was good, the texture came out slightly gritty so, not sure what I may have done wrong. I followed the recipe and measurements as listed. I'm wondering if maybe instead of using the Maseca (= name brand) 'MASA instant corn mix flour', I should use the 'Maseca' corn masa flour which is a fine powder (like regular flour). Anyone else have this happen to them?

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked in the microwave. I cooked on low for 7 minutes and on high for 5 1/2 minutes. Sure beats using the stovetop method. Absolutely delicious!

I was looking for the side dish served at Chevys and this was it! Followed recipe as written, but didn't have any foil for steaming so I cooked in microwave... 5 min at 30% and 2 min at full power. Let it sit for a while. Great side!

Used my rice cooker. Varied the recipe by using 2 tablespoons agave nectar instead of white sugar, chopped up some Hatch Chiles finely, coconut oil instead of butter and coconut milk instead of animal.

This was delicious and exactly like Chevys! I followed one reviewer who baked it. I put the mixture in a ceramic dish, covered it tightly with aluminum foil and baked it with a separate container of boiling water for 90 minutes at 250 degrees.

This makes a great side dish for lots of different kinds of meals, and it did not last long at my house! I think I'll be able to get away with a bit less sugar next time, just to make it a bit healthier.

This was delicious!! I used honey in place of the sugar, and did as others suggested, and only used 1/4 cup.  Will definitely be making this again.

My kids love my old-fashioned corn pudding (made only on Thanksgiving).  I'm going to try feeding them this and see if they like it.

These came out awesome - just like Chevy's.  It was very hard to find the masa harina - finally found it in a Mexican grocery store in Coney Island.. I baked in the oven in a water bath at 350.. only problem was I used the corning casserole dish with glass top and I dont think the top was tight enough..next time i'll wrap it tightly in foil. it was a little drier than expected and I think that is why, because the steam was escaping. These were soooooo good though.. next time I'll use a little less whole corn, just my preference though. Thanks for this great recipe!!

Very Good! I wasn't sure about the steaming part, and I did it for the time allotted, but it was too soupy. I put it in the oven for a few extra minutes and it turned out fine.

I was very disappointed in how this turned out. I followed the recipe exactly, yet it took waaay longer to cook then what the recipe states. I thought it tasted too gritty and the flavor just wasn't there. It wasn't gross but definitely not something I'll make again.

This is wonderful!!  Chevy's is no longer in our area and I have missed their tomalito.  This is it!  I use the microwave method and  cut the butter in half.  My husband also loves it.

This was very tasty! I microwaved it foe 10 minutes and it came out perfect, although I would not mind trying to steam it next time to see if it makes a difference in the texture. It also reminded me of the typical corn pudding made with corn bread mix, sour cream, and eggs.  I would make this again. Thanks!

when reducing to 4 servings, the corn in the ingredients column changes but the directions are a bit confusing. The amount of corn to blend doesn't change. I had to go back to eight servings to figure it out. I am making for the 1st x today, can't wait. I've been looking for this recipe for yrs. on all diff. sites!! Thanks Eric!!!

I made this for Cinco de Mayo, and it was delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used a deep dish pie pan that I tightly covered with foil.  I then placed it on a rack in my largest frying pan, using the pans lid to hold in the steam.  It took 60 minutes once the pan started steaming.  This is a very easy recipe, is delicious, and pretty much fool-proof!  Muy Bien! Gracias

This is a great dish I have to say, BUT! I tried the steam thing for over an hour and holy moly it wasn't working for me so I gave up and put it in the microwave for about 6 minutes on high so it would cook! other than that great side for any Mexican Fiesta!  Thanks.

The sweet corn tomalito I made was a strange consistency and tasted too much like the mesa.  I was disappointed.  Wonder if I did something wrong because I thought it would be like what I get at Chevy's.

This was not as great as expected.  I think it was probably the corn meal used.  I used a medium ground.  A finer ground would of made it better texture wise.

This recipe was great. I followed the microwave instructions instead of the stovetop, and it worked out great. Next time I would definitely use a little less margarine though, and I added a bit of hot sauce to give it an extra kick.

Excellent!  This was exactly what I was looking for!  It's the same as the Tomalito served by the famous Chevy's Fresh Mex restaurant.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!  Seerved it for Cinco de Mayo - great hit!
