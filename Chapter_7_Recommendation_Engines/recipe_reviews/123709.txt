I made this bread with left-overs I had from a huge baked butternut dish. So mine was on the salted side - no sugar and seasoned with green onions. I pureed all the wet ingredients and then I added flour.     I used Crisco butter flavored instead of butter.    Yes, the dough is a bit on the sticky side. I mixed everything inside a big tupperware and close the lid. I add a bit more flour to the surface only when I am going to deflate it. This way the dough won't stick to the surface or rolling pin and the bread keeps its  moisture.    Mine was ready in 30 minutes.  This bread has a rich golden tone, it is flaky, light and very flavorful! I found that the raw dough can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.    I have made many variations. I placed the braid in a Bundt pan and baked it. Then- after baking it -  I placed a glass with cranberry sauce extraodinaire(recipe in this site)right in the middle of the braid.It is a perfect combination!    I have also made stuffed bread. I opened the dough and placed ham, ricotta with cilantro, cheddar cheese and artichoke. Then wrap the rectangle and bake it.    I have also made crescent rolls.  This recipe is certainly a keeper!! Thank you!

This bread is very good. The color is pretty and the taste is amazing.  I put all the ingredients in my bread machine on dough cycle and let the machine do the work. Then I formed the braid.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

This bread was delicious!  I made the bread exactly as the recipe stated with no changes.  Not only was it soft and yummy with a slightly sweet taste, but it looked beautiful.  The dough had a pale orange-yellow cast to it and the braid really made it look elegant.  Of course, we ripped it apart eating chunks at a time, so it didn't look nice for long at my house!  Even my anti-squash-in-baking husband loved it.  I will definitely make this again!

One of the most delicious & certainly the most beautiful bread I've ever made. The butternut squash gives such a sweet nutty rich flavor and the color is beautiful. It is tender and reminds me in texture of Hawaiian bread. I will try it as rolls for the holidays.

I thought this turned out pretty good. When hot it didn't seem to have a ton of flavor. However, once it cooled it reminded me of a giant braided yeast roll.  However, it had a very slight squash taste and the color was brilliant. It would make a very nice "fall" bread/sliced roll. I found the recipe when I realized I had some frozen pureeed winter squash in the freezer to use up. After I defrosted it I strained out any extra liquid. I did have to add lots of flour to my hands while kneading the dough to get it to come together, as it was still a little sticky. I definitely wouldn't make this for sandwiches, because of the texture, and it is a slightly sweet kind of a bread. It would be great on a holiday though, with a side of butter, if feeding a lot of people. The directions were very easy to follow. Just make sure you have a pan larger than 18" because of the size.

I made this with 2 cups of whole wheat and 1 cup of all purpose and it turned out great (except for the burnt bottom - I was trying to bake too many things at once and it was down too close to the oven element).  I'll definitely be making it again and will try with 3 cups of whole wheat next time.

EXCELLENT!!! No other word to describe it.  I started making this bread and put too much butternut squash in by mistake.  I had to compensate by putting in more flour as well as the other ingredients.  In the end, I had two large braids both of which came out AWESOME.  I couldn't recommend this recipe highly enough.

This is a light bread, it's not too dense and yucky. I bought squash to use but by the time I was ready to make this it had gone bad. I improvised and used sweet potatoes instead. The bread was beautiful (I made it into a wreath shape) and very delicious!

This bread was great when I baked it two days ago, and it is still great!  I followed the recipe, but had to add a lot more flour to get the dough to a kneadable consistency. It was really beautiful and soft, but I felt like it needed some more salt, so I will probably triple that amount next time.

This was great! I only used about a half a stick of butter because that was all I had in the house, and just put a tiny bit more mashed squash in the dough, and it came out wonderfully.  It also makes great toast.

Excellent recipe! The braid took a bit of time to make but the steps were each easy. It was moist, sweet, and froze very well. It reminds me of the European style sweet breads in the look and taste and I can't wait to make it again next fall.

My guests and even my picky husband loved this bread!  It had a light texture and looked impressive.  It tasted like an egg loaf and no one could really tell there was squash in it.  My only problem was I found the dough was very sticky when I was kneading it so I had to keep adding flour to make it manageable.

Beautiful and delicious.  This was my first time braiding bread and I was a little intimidated but it was very easy.  I baked it on parchment paper to avoid the grease.  I will make this again soon.

This was soooo good. I found myself eating it even after I was stuffed from the Moroccan Stew I served it with! I just smeared it with some plain butter but I think a brown sugar cinnamon butter would be DE-licious with it as well. The only thing I forgot with this was the glaze but I honestly don't think it needed it (beyond an aesthetic quality). As I have about 4 cups leftover of some mashed butternut squash I will probably definitely be making this again. Yummy!!

This was absolutely delicious! I could not really taste the squash but that was the great part because maybe my picky eater will eat it! I used 2 cups ultragrain flour and 1 cup bread flour. I used the dough cycle of my bread machine. I used 1/3 plus 1 T warm milk since I wasn't blooming the yeast (I used rapid rise yeast). I overstretched the dough trying to braid it so I ended up with a ring but it looks so beautiful you can't tell I messed up. Soft, wonderful bread!

This bread is awesome. The only thing I must have done wrong is that it was too sticky to braid so I just made a loaf. It was still delicious and fairly easy to make. I highly recommend it.

The recipe as written needs more salt. I doubled the salt to 1/2 tsp, used salted butter and leftover squash that had some salt in it too. If I use unsalted butter and squash, I would probably put close to a tsp of salt in the bread. Otherwise it's a great recipe.

Everyone loves this. It is a VERY sticky dough. I end up added a lot of extra flour when I am working with the dough just so that it is manageable. To cut down on the stickiness I also let the squash cool before making the bread. It was still quite sticky. I've made this 3 times now with rave reviews.

wonderful bread!! if you let your bread machine do all the work, you only have to braid it and put the finishing touch. It comes out fluffy and orange and definitely appealing!

Bread turned out really good but I'm thinking I didn't add enough flour or maybe I didn't knead it enough b/c when i went to roll and braid it, it was not really rollable and was pretty sticky. (This was my first time making a braided bread) but it still tasted really good even if it didn't look so pretty :)

It was pretty good. I used all-purpose whole wheat flour. It makes for a heavy moist bread. It is almost the consistency of a cupcake.

My husband and toddler both love this bread.  I've made it twice now.  The second time, I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of the white flour and it still turned out great!

Made 3 loaves in one day, 2 to gift. I added the squash seeds on top of the braid after baking. Made one with 2 cups whole wheat flour and one cup all purpose flour. That one also came out well.

Really nice, even better the next day. I did start out thinking I would somehow put this in breadmaker but decided against it and made it by hand.  So easy, I'd forgotten just how easy handmade bread!  Would make again.

Trial run before Thanksgiving.  Used 1 cup canned pumpkin puree that I had frozen.  To try for more flavor I sautéed 1 thin sliced red onion and 3 medium cloves fresh minced garlic in 2 Tablespoons butter and 2 Tablespoons Garlic Olive oil. (In place of recipes ¼ Cup butter)  Then added to the pan the pumpkin puree , brown sugar, milk (I used lowfat buttermilk), & salt, to warm.  Pureed this mixture in food processor, adding room temperature egg slowly to the warm mixture.   I needed a total of 4 Cups all purpose flour for a nice kneading consistency.  (Pumpkin may have more moisture content?)  I also had the extra moisture from the onions, but hoped to balance that by leaving out the initial 2 Tablespoon of water & I just dissolved the yeast into the warm squash mixture before adding the flour. I made 2 smaller braids instead of one large one.  Make sure you don't have any air pockets in your ropes when you roll them.  Also try not to stretch the ropes as you braid them, or when the loaf rises, some portion of the ropes may get tears in them, detracting from a smooth final look. The rise of the braids went quick & I preheated my oven before baking.  Be generous with the egg wash.  Next time I'll try the butternut squash as the recipe calls for. Nice mild taste, dense soft inside, fragrant, rich golden color. Sliced beautifully.

This is so yummy. My kids devoured it, the entire loaf didn't last even an hour and we had already eaten dinner. I followed the recipe almost exactly, I did add a bit of extra flour as I was kneading it because it was a bit sticky but that is the only change I made.  I can't wait to make this for the holidays.

Great Bread! Soft wonderful flavor. I have made this several times. The squash in my garden grows to massive size so I always have leftovers. What better thing to do than use the leftovers for bread the next day. My son and husband love this bread with a nice hot bowl of soup. I often pair it with the Italian Sausage Tortellini Soup also from this site. If you use leftover squash make sure you warm it up before incorporating it into the bread. Also I don't proof the yeast in the water. I just make sure I use good yeast and mix it into the flour and then add the warm squash, milk, egg, etc. Also, I used better for bread flour instead of all-purpose. After kneading the bread and using the full 3 cups of flour, I thought the bread was rather soft and would need more flour, but I followed the recipe and only used 3 cups and it turned out wonderful. Thank you for the recipe Amy.

Excellent recipe! We had leftover mashed sweet potatoes to use up so I made substituted sweet potato for the squash. Soft inside and beautiful color and presentation. Tasted great with the sweeter flavor of the "Slow-Cooked Habanero Chili"! I would like to try this recipe again but instead of braiding it, make rolls.

Whole family loved this, and my five year old must have eaten half the loaf herself.  It was also beautiful!  Will make again.

Delicious! I had so many Delicata Squash left from my co-op basket, I sub'd it for the butternut. Beautiful & delicious. Followed recipe exactly EXCEPT used the bread maker and needed ~ 2-1/2 C flour only, adding the last 3/4 C as the machine was mixing on Dough cycle.

Yummy. I didn't use the glaze. And I must not have put enough salt in, so I'll make sure I measure that next time. But otherwise it was nice and fluffy.

I was actually looking forward to more of a squash flavor because I love squash, but for your picky eaters, this is GREAT!  Good, moist bread!  It did need a little more flour than the recipe called for!  Makes a larger loaf!

Amazing. I had never made bread from scratch before, and I've never made anything I liked in a bread machine. This turned out AMAZING on the first try, and received rave reviews from the rest of the household before it had even cooled.  I had doubts before I put it in the oven, since the loaf was bright orange and seemed small. But it fluffed right up and turned gold in no time, coming out of the oven in perfect condition 23 minutes and 47 seconds later. Bravo. Make no changes to this delicious recipe.

I made this as-written except I substituted whole wheat flour for 1 c of the flour, and I used 'better for bread' all purpose flour.  I thought it was very easy to put together and the loaf came out looking gorgeous.

This bread was amazing as is.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.  My family could not get enough of it and thankfully my squash made 3 cups so I was able to freeze the other 2 for future use.

Fantastic!  Allow a solid 3+ hours from start to finish for this recipe, but well worth the time and effort - serve within an hour of pulling from oven, it was gone inside 15 minutes.  Wow.

This bread did look as pretty as in the pictures but I didn't think it was that much better than any other (non-squash) bread.  Like several other reviewers I had to add more flour and bake a little longer and it was still quite dense and moist inside, which to me are characteristics one seeks more in brownies or cake than in bread.  I think it might have been nicer as a stuffed bread, or crescent rolls, as one other reviewer suggested.

It needed more seasoning, but it was good.Next time I will add either more sugar and cinnamon or more salt.

This was my first ever home-made bread, and it turned out so beautifully. I followed the recipe exactly.  The bread was subtly sweet with a hint of the butternut squash flavor. I don't think I've ever eaten this much bread this fast. Thank you!

This bread was awesome. I made it exactly as the recipe specified and it came out beautiful. At first i was worried because the loaf was huge, but by the end of the night i was sad i hadn't made two because it was gone so fast. Great recipe, am going to try it again with sweet potato.

This bread is very good, but there are a few things that the recipe should mention but doesn't.  When you dissolve the yeast in the water you should add a tsp. or so of the brown sugar and let sit for 5-10 minutes, especially when using active dry yeast.  I also cream the butter and sugar, add the egg then mix in the other ingredients.  If you wanted you could also use half bread flour and half all-purpose.

Not a lot of noticeable squash flavour but very moist and delicious! I made it with all whole wheat flour (this is how I make all my bread) and it was great. Will make again.

Note: this review is based on my changes, not the original recipe. I substituted canned pumpkin for the butternut squash because it's what I had and used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and just under 1 cup of white. (It didn't seem to need anymore flour than that.) The result just ok, in my opinion. Light and soft, yes. But fairly bland. Maybe butternut is more flavorful than pumpkin? I'd add a bit more sugar and some spices next time (cinnamon and nutmeg, maybe.)

Excellent recipe; however, I did need to use a lot more flour to work the dough. The dough is very sticky, so keep loose flour around to use for your hands.

This bread turned out pretty and delicious! I used instant yeast as that is what I had on hand, a box of frozen winter squash which lessened the work for me, and used white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour. This was easy to make!

Loved it. Put all the ingredients into the bread machine and just made a regular loaf.

My husband had a piece and said, "you don't have to look for any more bread recipies.  This one is so great!"  The dough was really sticky and I used my breadmaker to make the dough.

I have never, ever made bread before. I bought all the ingredients, read through the recipe twice and started with bated breath.    First of all, as people have said here before, the dough is very sticky. Like, very, very sticky. I think I left about a slice of bread on my hands before I washed them. So definitely have extra flour.    After looking worried, being relieved when it rose and braiding it easily (that part was not hard!)... I was shocked to find... BREAD coming out of MY oven! Real bread!    Thanks for the great recipe -- tastes great and I don't even like squash. The plan is to try it in the toaster oven with some cream cheese and cinnamon. Thanks again!

I found this recipe when I was looking for a way to use up half of a leftover butternut squash.  Unfortunately, I also found about five other delicious sounding recipes.  I still wanted to try this bread, so I subbed pumpkin for the butternut, because I have a lot of pumpkin in my freezer.  I also replaced the 1/4 c. of butter with 1/4 c. applesauce, used 2 c. of whole wheat and 1 c. of white flour.  Even without any shortening and using mostly whole wheat, this was a deliciously soft bread.  A little too "pumpkin-y" for my tastes but that's my fault.  Butternut would have MADE this bread.  Next time I'll use the real deal!

Absolutely delicious and beautiful! I know it's meant for fall foods, but I just found this recipe and it would look gorgeus on an Eater table. The color is fantastic, but the taste is even better. It took closer to 4 cups of flour for me to not have sticky hands, but I did everything else according to recipe.

Our family loves squash bread.  I made this recipe once as a braid, and once as rolls.  Works beautifully as both.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these into rolls.  Perhaps I handled them too much and it made them more dense, but all in all, I was not impressed.  I could not taste the butternut squash taste.

This is a gorgeous loaf of bread! Even my husband said it was good and he usually doesn't eat butternut squash. I was skeptical about not preheating the oven and about the short baking time, but it really baked up beautifully. I wanted it a little darker, so I turned off the oven after 25 minutes and left the bread in the oven overnight. By morning, it had the sheen golden glow that I was looking for. I did find that 3 cups of flour wasn't enough - the dough was a bit sticky. I added an extra cup of flour plus some for dusting. Other than the extra flour, this recipe is perfect and I'm filing this into my keeper's pile. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, Amy!

Very tasty. I made the bread too big, so I ended up having to cook it much more than the directions indicate, but it still ended up crisp and tasty on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside.

This was so much fun to make. Im always trying to bake new and unique breads. The squash gave the bread a beautiful golden color inside and out. Braiding it was fun and makes the presentation looks so much better. Thanks for this recipe!

This was my fist time making homemade bread not in a machine. I thought it was going to be harder. Was time comsuming but the bread was so moist and great flavor. Didnt even know you were eating squash! Everyone at the party raved over it and gave the recipe out to a lot of people. Will make many more times!

A definite 5 stars!  Squash is in season so I bought a butternut and didn't know what to make with it when I found this recipe. This was my first braid and it was delicious! It takes time to make but is well worth it.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it was perfect.
