I made this when my twin grand daughters were coming over. The girls just loved it, they both had seconds. My husband is a regular fan, I make it a few times a month. Especially during summer. For variety I change the shape of pasta....always a hit,  I did add a green zuchinni cut just like I did the cucumbers..perfect crunch!

This was a nice light pasta salad.  I added shredded romaine and made it with the italian dressing mix recipe off this site as well.  Will definitely make again.

Made this on Valentines Day for my sweetheart using five color heart shaped pasta. This turned out so good that it will go into my TNT folder. Thank you Steph for sharing this recipe.
