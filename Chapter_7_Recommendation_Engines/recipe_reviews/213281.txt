Excellent recipe. Changes I made are minor. Used 1/3 cup honey and Kroger brand hot Picante sauce. Had to make mixture twice for a 3lb bag of wings. Well worth the 1hr cook time.

Super easy and very tasty. I made a mistake and used salsa instead of the Picante Sauce, but it was still very good..Definately should be in everyone's recipe box.

This was a pretty good recipe (and anyway, I needed more practice cutting up chicken wings). I made it exactly as written, except that I let most of the wings cook longer than the 1:05 given. I took 4 pieces out at 1:05 and the sauce was hardly a "glaze" and the wings weren't crispy yet, so I let the rest keep cooking in the cooling oven. I think I took them all out at 1:20 or so. The taste was pretty good, and different. I refrigerated half of the pieces and reheated them in the microwave the next day, and thought I actually preferred the latter. I'm still looking for an amazing wings recipe someday, but this was pretty nice anyway.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to try a different flavor. The recipe exceeds my expectations. The best part is that it is simple to make. I was unable to cut the wing tips and I had to use Pace Chunky Salsa medium....it still came out great!

I didn't care for this recipe.  I mistakenly purchased Picante salsa instead of sauce and I didn't like the tomatoe-y taste that came from the Picante salsa.  Very easy but I probably won't make again.

I have made this recipe many times,its a family favorite. Sometimes I change it up by adding 1 tea. cumin(we really like the flavor). I usually mix up the sauce and let my wings marinate for at least 2 hrs,then make extra sauce and brush on while cooking. But if I don't plan ahead for this,following the recipe instructions works great too.Have also done drumsticks this way. Hubby calls them "Spicy Walkers".

Loved this chicken although it was not spicy at all. I used the mild picante sauce maybe I'll up it next time. My daughter also loved the recipe. i will definitely be making these again.

I tried this recipe the other night and the wings were OK. They did not quite have the right amount of spice or seasoning that I would have liked. Perhaps, for next time, I'll be more generous with the seasonings. The chicken cooked well, however, so that was a plus.

These are now my favorite homemade wings. Very simple with perfect flavor. I did not have picante sauce but medium salsa worked just fine. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made it the second time adding 2T, hoisin sauce and a tsp of soy .  Very yummy and so easy.  A real keeper!!! Update:  have made this several times now and always double recipe to make for the crowd.  A Super bowl party favorite.  They just love it!  I marinated it overnight last time... Great!

Very bland. I don't like spicy so I used mild and it had no flavor. I was expecting tangy and sweet. It was neither.
