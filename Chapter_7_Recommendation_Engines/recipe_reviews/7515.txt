This recipe has been in with my family for quite a few years, and I have a few easier methods to making it--right when you pull the cake out of the oven, take the handle of a wooden spoon and poke holes all over the cake (it doesn't matter if you hit the bottom of the pan or not) and then poor the caramel directly into the holes, then do the same with the condensed milk.  Once the cake cools, top it with the cool whip and then top that with the toffee bars crunched up (Heath & Skor bars seem to work very well).  This is by far the one recipe that I pass along the most--it's awesome!

I read the reviews and made some changes to make a better cake. First I made the devil's food cake and cut the oil in half. It makes a dense cake so it won't get soggy (like everyone complained) and brings out the flavor of the chocolate. After baking I poked holes in the cake with a chopstick (not to the bottom of the pan), poured a jar of caramel over the top at room temperature (I omitted the milk completely because I didn't want it to be soggy)and poured chocolate syrup over the caramel. I broke up two Heath bars and put those on top. Next layer was cool whip and two more candbars. For presentation I added chocolate syrup stripes. It looked great, the cake didn't fall apart and everyone LOVED. Serve immediatley. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet but sweet enough! I love sweets and this was perfect. I'll make it again and again!

Yummy!...I did make a few changes...this is actually a recipe I saw in a magazine(it was called Better than Homework Cake)....the only difference was that this recipe calls for devils food cake and the other one called for german chocolate cake (which I personally dont care for). The changes I made were poking holes in the cake with the back of a wooden spoon instead of making slits...and I used the whole 14 oz. can of condensed milk and doubled the amount of caramel topping....seems like a lot...but it soaks in and makes like a sauce for this cake. Used lite cool whip and pre-packaged chocolate covered toffee pieces. Great flavor...took this to friends house for dessert and everyone loved it.

I have been making this for years, and it has always been a wonderful and dependable standby when I've needed a spur of the moment dessert. My recipe, however, uses the full can of sweetened condensed milk (not heated), followed by a full 15-16 oz. jar of slightly warmed ice cream topping (I like Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch-caramel) Having raised both a son and a daughter, I can tell you that it seems that boys go even more crazy over this dessert than the girls, but maybe that's only because the girls were more concerned about their waistlines!  :) This is outrageously gooey and good, combining two favorite flavors, chocolate and caramel.

Great recipe!  A huge hit with all that have tried it!  I have made this forever, but the way I've always done it seems a bit easier.  Also, I use German Chocolate cake.  Basically I put little holes in the cake and pour the milk on it (straight from the can.  Let it soak, pour the carmel on it (straight from the jar) and let it soak.  Then I add the whipped cream and I buy toffee bits already chopped up (Skor).  I serve it chilled, it seems to be better that way.

This is one of the best desserts I have made. After making it the first time, I have found that the whipping cream seems to detract from the chocolate/carmamel flavor of the cake, so I don't use it. If you want to cut down on some of the sweetness then the whipping cream is not a bad idea. It adds to the presentation as well, but definitely not necessary. I also have found that it is much easier  to microwave the caramel mixture. Try not to use the stove. It can burn easily. Excellent cake!!

This cake is sooo amazing! I have made it 3 times so far. I made it for 2 seperate Christmas parties last year and it was the rave of everyone at the party.  This cake went much faster than all the others.  If you want to be a big hit, make this for dessert.  I do have one tip, be sure to be careful when cutting the slits on the cake.  If you go too deep, the cake is gonna fall apart when serving it.  Also be sure to put the whip cream on after the cake has cooled or else it will melt right off.

Wonderful, very rich cake!  I would suggest not making the slits very deep because the caramel goes to the bottom of the cake, and it's hard to serve. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  I did make several changes based on other comments.  First, I used Duncan Hines (always the best).  I poked the holes with a wooden spoon all the way to the bottom and used a full 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk and a 12 oz. jar of caramel ice cream topping.  I poured in half of each and then repeated the process.  I also used an 8 oz. bag of Heath bits.  I made the cake a day ahead as suggested and added the whipped topping and garnish just prior to serving.  I wasn't totally impressed with the cake until my husband had a leftover piece a day later.  By that time the liquids had been evenly absorbed into the cake and you could taste the caramel, which we couldn't when it was originally served.  So, the secret to developing the best flavor and texture is to make it TWO days in advance.  Just cover it tightly and put it in the refrigerator.  Trust me, you won't be sorry.  It improves with age.

I took this cake to a barbecue over the weekend and everyone enjoyed it.  I definitely will use more toffee bars, perhaps 5 and will not use all of the caramel sauce as it slipped under the cake and made it difficult to serve.  Will definitely make this again.

This cake was good but the caramel layer didn't sink down into the cake. I won't keep it as one of my top 10.

I took this to a party yesterday and the WHOLE thing got eaten.  Everyone was asking "who made that cake?" and asking me what was in it.  I used 4 skor bars, 3 on the cake and 1 on top of the cool whip. 

BTW, for the people that said the whipped topping melted, use cool whip, not the whipped topping out of the spray cans.  The cool whip won't melt.

I made cupcakes (22) with this recipen and they were fantastic!  We are serious chocolate lovers and I added about 6 oz of mini chocolate chips to the batter (request of birthday girl).  I used a thinner caramel sauce that was super sweet, so I did not use the sweetened milk.  Cut a core out of the top of each cupcake, filled with some of the caramel sauce and replaced the cupcake plug.  Regrigerated for a couple of hours then topped with Cool Whip, toffee pieces and drizzled more caramel and chocolate sauce on top.  Next time will add a bit more filling in the middle. Adults and kids fought over the cupcakes and are a new family favorite and have been told they best be on the Thanksgiving menu.  Definitely not diet food but for a special occasion, worth every calorie!  Great recipe, easy to customize for your family's tastes - one of the top 5 recipes I've used on Allrecipes.

I used the recipe on the side of the box to make devils food cake pound cake to make it a little more sturdy and dense. I was also out of caramel so I used the praline sundae topping recipe and left out the pecans. This made the cake so much better that the last time we tried it.

OK..Better Than Sex...NOT.  But a wonderful wonderful treat to have right after :-). No better way to reward yourself after a workout! Five stars for sure with a few minor changes for me.  I too went along with poking holes with the wooden spoon.  I poured on top 3/4 of a can of condensed milk which I did not heat I also zapped in the microwave the caramel topping and also poured about 1/2-3/4 of a jar of that.  I had no toffee bars so subbed snickers cut up nice.  I also am not a fan of cool whip when fresh cream is so easy to make
(2 cups heavy cream, 1 cup conf sugar and a squirt of vanilla-beat on high til nice and formed)  I used that and drizzled fudge and caramel topping over the top and it looked like a masterpiece.  And tasted like one as well!  Don't pass it up.  Great Share.

AMAZING! This cake has been in my family for a while and we LOVE IT! I agree with everyone above. I do the wooden spoon handle method, and I just pour the sweetened condensed milk and caramel across the cake. Much easier! Check out my summer modified version. I made it up and it is JUST as good as the original!

Definitely a make ahead cake.  Not very good the first day but improved tremendously with time as the flavors meld together.  I used all carmel sauce (14oz. Jar) and it was great!

i made this for my step-dad for Father's Day. and he LOVED it, couldn't stay out of it. mmmm..this cake was SO good. it SHOULD be pre-made AT LEAST 2 days before serving it, so it has longer ingredient soak-time. Believe me, i tried it the first day, as well as the third day. OMG it was SOOOO much better the third day, such a difference.. the only did two things differently, i didn't mix the caramel and the condensed milk together, i just alternated pouring both all over the holes i poked in the cake (with a fork) AND i used Butterfinger instead of toffee. this cake was bomb, fire, amazing, and probably better than sex..

Being a true "dessert lover" I read every review of this cake.  Made it last night and sorry to say, I feel the cake is very overrated and found it to be way too sweet.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and cut down on the amount of condensed milk thinking that it would cut down on the sweetness....It didn't......If I do ever try this again I really think I may omit the whipped cream.  I love chocolate, caramel and toffee bits, but the combination of those ingredients, plus condensed milk and whipped cream make this cake for me "way over the top"....My two daughters said they LIKED it, but preferred the dump cake recipe from this site....Me, if I want a chocolate fix really like the "Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies, submitted by Sarah, (I did add semi-sweet chocolate chips to that recipe)...As far as living up to the name????? no way this cake was better than sex.....I will try it again with more alterations...but was disappointed and didn't expect to be after all the reviews....Oh well!!!!

This came out really good. I made it for ladies night at my house. The girls loved. Then my husband came home and he loved it too! I took the advice of another user and added chocolate morsels to the cake batter. Also, I used some of the cake batter to make 12 cupcakes. I omitted the milk because I was concerned about it being too soggy (I'm really picky with textures) and instead I used the handle of my wooden spoon to puncture deep holes through the cake and in the center of each cupcake. Then I filled each hole with caramel syrup, yum! Then I spread the whip cream on top. Topped with the crushed candy and even more chocolate morsels and then drizzled with both caramel and chocolate syrup! Excellent recipe with or without my alterations! thanks for a great recipe!

I've been making this cake using pretty much the same recipe for years and I could not LOVE it more!!! One thing I do differently is to poke holes with a fork all over the cake instead of the slits. I think this helps it sink into the cake but not all the way to the bottom. The secret is to let it cool in the fridge for at least an hour. It lets all the carmel/sweetened condensed milk soak in!

This cake was okay. I thought I would like it better than I did because I love everything in it but it just wasn't exciting to me. I didn't earn any real rave reviews from my guests either but everyone ate it. Certainly not what the name implies in my opinion;)

This recipe has been a hit at multiple parties!  I have to strongly recommend using a box of Vanilla or White Cake instead of the Devil's Food.  I made it once with the Devil's Food and my family could only eat a few bites because it was so rich.  The Vanilla Cake takes an edge out of the richness and is truly divine!!  Make sure to use homemade whip cream instead of cool whip...it brings it to a whole new level.  Happy Eating!!

My daughter brought this to school (8th grade) for a friend's birthday.  Everyone loved it:)  At the end of the day, the school dean was asking for it for her birthday.  I asked my daughter if she told her what the name of the cake was?  She said noooooo.  My husband chimed in that she better call it, "Instead of sex cake"!  It's really delicious -- Don't change a thing!

This cake was good but the sweetened condensed milk and caramel didn't seep through the holes in the top of the cake enough.  So it was a little dry.  I would suggest making the slits or holes larger to let more of the liquid get into the cake.

This is one delicious cake!  So simple to make, and always elicits the oohs and aahs.  I made it for my sister's birthday and everyone raved on and on about it.  I did do mine a bit differently, though.  I baked a Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake in a 9x13 glass dish.  I then omitted the sweetened condensed milk (don't care for it) and instead combined about 16 ounces (a jar and a half) of Smucker's hot fudge topping along with 1/2 a cup of 2% milk in a pan and warmed it on the stove top  for easier spreading.  I took the cake out of the oven and immediately poked holes all over it with a chopstick.  I then poured the hot fudge/milk mixture from the pan all across the cake, spreading it with a spatula to assure even coating.  While it was still hot, I sprinkled bits of crushed Hershey's toffee and almond Symphony candy bar over the hot fudge topping.  I let it cool awhile on a wire rack, then refrigerated it for an hour or so.  When it was cooled off, I frosted it with a tub and a half of Extra Creamy Cool Whip (tastes like homemade whipped cream) and placed the remaining half of the tub of Cool Whip into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and proceeded to make a shell border around the cake.  Afterward, I topped the frosted cake with the remaining crushed candy bar and popped it into the fridge for several hours.  It looked really special and people thought I fussed....but it was really simple.  I will be asked to make this time and again from now on!

I used a chocolate fudge cake mix. Also I used a straw to poke holes in the cake instead of making slits. Also I refrigerated the cake after adding the carmel and toffee pieces to the top, which makes it much easier to cut, it also holds together better for slicing. I wanted to take this cake to a meeting and didn't want to fuss with plates and forks, so after it cooled in refrig. I cut it into diamond pieces and dipped the the bottoms into powdered sugar(prevent sticking) and placed them into cupcake liners and arranged them onto a tray. Deliciously different cake, that is extremely moist. The toffee candy bars melt on the top of the cake and make a nice topping.  With the way I served this I didn't use the whipped topping, and it was great. Thanks, will make it again!

EXCELLENT and EASY!  I didn't even mix the condensed milk and caramel on the stove... I just poured them both on top of the cake without warming them up... the cake had even cooled quite a bit by the time I got around to it... I think that helped it not get overly soggy... I also poked small holes with a birthday candle which was a perfect size... I 'fridgerated it over night and added the cool whip just before serving and all RAVED over it! :)  Will def do again...

This cake is WONDERFUL!  I've had it before, but never made it myself.  I followed some of the suggestions made by others, poking holes with a wooden spoon (make sure cake has cooled somewhat first), and drizzling whith plenty of sauce.  I also used a pint of heavy whipping cream and whipped it up for the topping, adding a couple tablespoons of sugar.  Using this method, and keeping cool while not in use, the whipped topping has stayed PERFECT!  I also substituted toffee bits.  This is a must do again recipe.

This cake got me serious points with the hubby's coworkers!  I made this for them for New Year's Eve (since the poor lot had to work). It was gone in no time flat and everyone absolutely loved it.  Too bad I didn't get to try it though!  I followed the recipe exactly, substituting the caramel and whipped topping with the UK versions (carnation tinned caramel and bird's dream topping) which are just slightly different.

This turned out great!  Poked holes with a spoon instead of slitting the cake.  Also bought a bag of the crushed Heath pieces instead of whole bars, it's cheaper and you get a lot more.

Holy Moly this cake was delicious!  I used the whole container of Sander's Butterscotch Carmel which is more carmel than the recipe called for.  Next time I will prob use less condensed milk and more carmel for a more carmelly flavor.  I also used half the oil for a more dense cake and used a straw to poke out a gazillion holes in it.  It was such a hit and tasted so good and was sooooooo moist, I will make it again for sure!

I had heard several references to Better than Sex Cake.  I figured I should try it.  I am not sure what all the raves were about.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I probably won't bother to make it again.  The caramel topping does keep the cake from drying out, but other than that, it is just a chocolate cake.

It is a very yummy cake! I made it for New Years and it was a big hit! The only thing I found I didn't like was that the the sauce didn't soak into the rest of the cake. I made huge slits but it only soaked in a bit. Next time I am going to heat the sauce more and put it on the cake right out of the oven, plus big slits again and see if that works! But it is still a very yummy cake!

This was very good!  I made chocolate cake from scratch and added the whole can of sweetened condensed milk and 12 oz of caramel like other reviews suggested. I didn't heat up the sw.cond.milk and caramel.  I just made lots of holes in the top of the cake with a fork and poured the caramel sauce over it and then poured the sw.cond.milk over it while the cake was just out of the oven. I also made the whipped cream from scratch which was 16 oz. whipping cream whipped to soft peaks and then adding 6 tbs. powdered sugar and 2 tsp. vanilla and whipping in until it was the right consistency.

I'm giving this a five in honor of my hubby. This is his favorite cake. I find it to be a bit soggy for my taste but I'm pretty picky about texture. He on the other hand, as well as my kids, absolutely love this. I will be using this recipe every year for his birthday lol. Thank you for sharing.

I have made this many times before for get togethers, as it is easy and perfect for large crowds.  This particular time I was making it for a lunch with some ladies.  I chose to bake this in little foil lined square pans, and then after removing them, put all of the gooey delicious toppings on.  They were very cute little cakes, and everyone loved them!

This wasn't a 5 star for me.  I made in a 9x13 pan and the whip cream wasn't enough.  I will make again in a cake pan and use 6 or 7 bars.

Better than sex? MAMA NO!!! I will definately take sex any day over this cake. I bought all the ingredients with excitement to make this for my man's birthday, and ended up so extremely disappoited and frustrated with the outcome. The caramel sauce made this so soggy and the cake tasted like, you guessed it: caramel. It sure looked like devil's food cake, but the flavor had no indication of devil's food cake. The thawed whipped topping would not stay on this cake. I ever tried sitting it in the freezer and it all slid off. So here I am almost an hour into fooling with this cake and almost in tears at this point, being so frustrated. I ended up sopping up all the "whipped topping" and making a chocolate frosting for this cake. It saddens me to relive the moment of making this cake to write this review. I definately will not even try to tweak this recipe.

"Sex in a bowl" is what I call my chocolatey dessert.  Try it this way... 1 box choco cake mix (bake as directed). 5 sm bx choco pudding (mix as directed). 10 bars of skor (chopped). fold the chopped skor into the pudding. once the cake is done... cool completely and crumble. layer the cake and pudding in a large glass bowl. 3 layers of each. top with cool whip. a delicious and easy treat!

I made this cake for a work party and my colleagues just loved it.  I made a few small changes.  Instead of using a rectangular baking dish, I used two 8 inch round pans to create a layer cake.  Since I made the cake the night before the party, I thought it'd be better not to put on the whipped topping - for fear that it would make the cake soggy.  The cake looked so pretty with the caramel and toffee glaze that I decided that I'd rather serve the whipped topping on the side, and let people help themselves.  Several people wanted the recipe.  I'd definitely make this cake again.  It was easy and delicious.

This didn't live up to it's name for me, but hey, with those ingredients, has to be at least *pretty* good, right?! I made my own chocolate cake, using the Chocolate Fudge Cake recipe from this site, and made two layers in round 8-inch cake pans. My family really liked it, I just thought it was a tad boring, but I think maybe I set my expectations high because of the list of ingredients that I love. I'd make again, but first I'd brainstorm ways to jazz it up a little.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe stated and my cake was perfect. I would not change a thing. I cut slits like the recipe called for and in my opinion that was the best way to go. I hate soggy cake and if you put holes in the cake that is what you will get. I will make this cake many, many more times!

Love this! I think it's funny that someone who reviewed this used 14 oz can of sw. cond milk, double the caramel and LITE cool-whip : ) - I used a king-size Heath bar, some of the bagged Heath brickle and got called the next day by a friend who was PMS'ing - "I NEED some more of that cake!!"

This was very well received at my potluck today, along with the "buffalo chicken wing dip" also from this site.

My only issue, it was just slightly goopy!  This is totally my fault, as I added a can of nestle fudge syrup over the 20 oz of caramel syrup and the condensed milk.  I OD'ed, I know.

But, the same cutie pie guy was cleaning the cake pan, so it was a great success.

My GOOD adjustments included:  1)adding fudge syrup to the cool whip.  I don't really like the stark white against chocolate cake ... just an aesthetic preference.  It also cut the artificial flavor of coolwhip.  2) putting a layer of toffee chips *under* the cool whip layer - it sits on the cake overnight and melts into the top, giving an extra dimension of toffee flavor. ;-) 3) addinga little butter to the caramel, per someone's suggestion. 

I could give it 5 stars, maybe, but I slightly flubbed it.  The pan looked incredibly nasty as the cake slices were cut, but it tasted pretty gorgeous! 

i might have added just two too many tablespoons of liquid.

This is very reminiscent of tres leches!

This was one of the most delicious cakes, I have eaten.  I followed the reviews, and used the back of the spoon to make holes.  I used the microwave to mix the caramel and the condensed milk together.  I let the cake sit for a while (at least 1 hr).  The topping seeped through the cake.  This was really moist and yummy.  The only reason why i did not give it 5 stars was because, i think the topping was too sweet, even for my kids.  Next time I will go easy on the topping.

Yea, this is good!  We used a german chocolate cake mix and 2 cans of condensed milk.  I like mine really gooey.  I think we consumed 3 of these cakes in 3 weeks time.  This is good using butterfingers too!

Very good. I used a yellow cake mix instead....seemed to be a better mix with the caramel. I liked the amount of caramel topping and condensed milk that is listed and didn't double it like other reviews. It was the perfect richness by itself. The secret is letting it chill....it grows more moist the longer it sits.

This is a great dessert!! Used one can Low fat Sweetened condensed milk(Canadian can=a little over 10 oz), sugar free caramel topping (I just combined the two and stirred), toffee bits, mini chipits, and fat free whipped topping.  Wow!! So good!! Very moist, next time, there will be a next time, I will reduce the number of eggs in the cake when I make it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!  UPDATE: Made again and everyone loved it!!  Used one less egg (used 2 this time, and cake had more structure, less soggy)!!

Mrs. Richardson's caramel is really the best. The cake is definitely true to its name. Also, i don't cut slits in it; it doesn't let enough of the mixture into the cake. I poke holes (not all the way through) with the end of a wooden spoon.

I must admit it felt a little weird telling my mother I was making a "Better Than Sex Cake" for my little boys 1st birthday, but it was VERY delicious and everyone loved it. I expected it to be more rich but it was surprisingly light tasting (I think it was the whipped topping instead of a regular frosting). I will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

This is one of my all time winners for a decadent dessert cake.  The only thing I change for this recipe is using Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel ice cream topping instead of the caramel and condensed milk.  I figure one ingredient is better than 2!  The butterscotch caramel toppings makes the cake rich, creamy and oh so sweet!

After reading the reviews, I was expecting to be knocked of my feet, however the cake was just ok.  It tasted like a box cake and didn't have a great presentation look.  The topping was good but it never really penetrated the cake even though I had made many slits.

YUMMY!  The next time I make this I'll poke holes in the top rather than cut slits, I think it would allow more of the caramel mixture to sink into the cake.  Very easy and everyone loved it.

I know everyone else raved about this cake but it is just not that good.  I made it once and don't intend to make it again.  This cake is no good the second day because the sweetened condensed milk just turns it into a soggy mess.  There are much better chocolate cake recipes out there.

I'am sorry to say that I don't think this is a good cake at all. Served this to Five people and only one said it was good. She was the Birthday girl so I guess that tells it all. It just seem to be to sweet with not a lot going for it. I  think the name of the cake is what people get carried away with.  WRONG!!

Goodness gracious!  This was a hit at our Christmas dinner yesterday.  My granddaughters groaned and moaned with pleasure while eating it - probably to make my day!  Everyone wants the recipe.  For the toffee part, I used 16 pieces of smashed up Almond Toffee candy that comes in a jar at Costco.

This was amazing!!!!!!!! Absolutely delish! I was worried that it was going to be too sweet (really not a fan of something too sweet)) but it was just perfect! The only changes I've made was that I used kit kat instead of toffee and there were great!!!!

OH MY GOODNESS!! This is delicious!!  I made this for my employees in my office.  Instead of making a big cake, I cut the batter in half and put it into 2 8" round cake pans.  This way I had one pan for the office and one for my husband.  Let me just say that at my office, it was gone before you could write out the recipe.  Everyone LOVED the flavors as they melt in your mouth.  My husband also loved the caramel, toffee mix and the gooey goodness that is in the cake.  I will make this again and again and again!!  Thank you for such a AWESOME recipe, ANGELADY41!!

This is the best cake ever. I put in the whole can of sweetened condensed milk and a whole jar of caramel topping. I mixed them together in a saucepan and heated them until just warm then poured over the cake. I let that soak in overnight and then heated a jar of hot fudge sauce and poured that over the cake. I then topped with a tub of cool whip and heath bars !

My husband really likes this easy cake.  As other reviewers have mentioned rather than the slits I just poke holes using the handle of a wooden spoon.  I also prefer to omit the condensed milk and just use a whole jar of Mrs Richardson's Butterscotch Carmel Sauce.  As far as toppings, I like it with crushed Heath bits, but have also used Butterfinger.  This cake is best when its been sitting for awhile so the carmel sauce has time to really soak into the cake.

I love this cake and always have.  It is one of my faves not only to eat but to make.  So fast and easy.  I so some changes like everyone seems to do.  such as holes with wood spoon (not to bottem) and no milk or jsut 1/2 can. I like to make it in a 9x13x pan just makes it easer to move. I have not warmed to sause and it seems to soke in just fine.

This cake is delicious but the sweetened condensed milk is not necessary- I have never used it on my cake and it is always a crowd pleaser.  We call it "Darn Good Cake" in my family.

I combined the milk with butterscotch topping and poured it on the cake.  I also made my own frosting.  This cake is super sweet and rich.  I also like how versatile this recipe is as you can use any candy and topping you prefer.

This is the best cake ever. I love it. I always got it for my birthday as a child and still love it today. Some alterations to make the cake even better: 1st add the condensed milk while the cake is still hot out of the oven and poke holes in the cake with the end of a wooden spoon(instead of cuts). This will make the condensed milk disperse faster. Once the cake is cool cover with caramel sauce and cool whip. Also, Heath or Score bars are the best for the topping. Put them in a couple of plastic bags and give them a beating with a wooden mallet and sprinkle over top. But I love this dish. It's truly the best. I hope you like my additions and version of doing this cake.

This cake is so GOOD!    My son made this cake for my mother's 72nd birthday and everyone loved it.  Since it is so rich, we cut the pieces very small and it fed about 30 people.

I'm really surprised that I didn't love this cake because I have a huge sweet tooth. I followed the recipe, except I made my own whip cream.  I thought it was way too sweet. It almost made me sick, that's how overly sweet it was. The guys at work ate gobbled it up, so that's something but I doubt I'll make it again.

I didn't read the recipe closely until I actually made this. I thought this was a pudding/cake/whipped topping type dessert. It is more of a *very good chocolate cake* that has been taken up a few notches. Everyone enjoyed the added crunch and creamy whipped-cream with the moist, sweet chocolate cake cake. Will make again, when wanting a very good, moist chocolate cake.

I made this for a get together of mostly men and they couldn't stop complimenting this cake... or eating it!  I used German chocolake cake mix by accident which I won't do next time.  I also followed other reviewers suggestion and used the whole can of condensed milk and extra caramel topping.  This will be a staple for future gatherings!

This is a pretty good recipe- but if you pour the caramel directly on the cake and then beat the eagle brand with 8oz of cream cheese until smooth and use that for another layer... you'll be shocked at the difference it will make.  When I make it I also mix chocolate pudding with the cool whip b/c my husband doesn't like cool whip topping... it really is fabulous, and very hard to beat.

I had higher expectations for this cake based on all the reviews. My cake wasn't as moist as I'd expected, but this may have been due to my fan forced oven. If you also have a fan forced oven, I would suggest using the whole can of sweetened condensed milk (and even adding more caramel, to taste, if you like) to make the cake more dense and rich. I would either try this or using a mud cake as a base, rather than devil's food.

This is one of my favorite cakes to bring to family gatherings/potlucks. I change up the candy bar sometimes and will use chopped Mr. Goodbar and sprinkle
the top with chopped peanuts or use chopped Milky Way/Snickers bars. It really depends on what I have on hand. Want to make it even better? Make homemade whipped cream.

I made this cake for friends when they came for supper and everyone loved it with it disappearing within 30 minutes.  I can never leave a recipe alone so here is how I changed it:
1) the recipe on the box called for 1/3 cup oil--I made it 1/4 cup. Then I added 3/4 cup toffee pieces to the mix
2) I left out the sweetened condensed milk all together
3) I made the holes in the cake with a chop stick and poured 1/2 jar of caramel ice cream topping  and 2/3 jar of warmed hot fudge topping over the top right out of the oven
4) Last I took the rest of the bag of toffee pieces and covered the top  Garnished it with whip cream
The cake was moist but not soggy.  It was sweet but not horrible so.

Oh....this is so good. I made a few changes, based on other reviews.  I used a yellow cake mix, just to be different.  I used about 3/4 of a can of the condensed sweet milk and I used a more of the caramel topping than what's called for in the recipe. I decided to be lazy, so I did use the refridgerated whipped cream.  It turned out great. Served to company and they all enjoyed it.  No doubt, I will make this again.  I may try it with the devil's food cake. That sounds divine.

Great Recipe. I made two small round cakes. Poked holes in first layer poured sauce then toffee crumbles then added second layer poked holes and added toffee crumbles the refrigerated for a bit ( so the cake wouldn't slpit or fall) then iced with whipped topping drizzled caramel and sprinkled toffee bits. It really is beautiful.

I loved this recipe, although, I used HOT FUDGE instead of caramel. . . It turned out perfectly.  I do have to agree with others on here that say it is EXTREMELY rich, as it is, but that just makes me eat less, which is good for my figure!  =) 
All in all, my family loved this recipe and I am actually making it again tonight for a girlfriends birthday - she loves chocolate so I am sure she will love this cake!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was delicious and simple to make.  This recipe is also fun to make with your kids, although we call it Chocolate Caramel Crunch Cake. I made this for my mother's birthday, and everyone loved it!
  I did follow the advice to use a whole can on sweetened condensed milk, and I added 8oz of caramel topping instead of 6oz.  This was the perfect amount of liquid and flavor for my preference.  I also used 4 Skor bars (3 for the cake and 1 for topping), and I smacked them with my rolling pin before opening the wrappers.

DELICIOUS!!!
Use all of the condensed milk and carmel sauce, and buy the fun size Heath Bars to have more.  I crushed about 1/3 of the bag and topped the cake and then would add fresh crushed Heath to each piece just before serving (after a day or so the pieces sitting in the topping start to soften).

I love this cake. I got worried as I was pouring the milk mixture onto the cake because I thought it was going to be soggy. I then let it cool, and refrigerated for 3 hours. I put the cool whip on right before serving. The texture of the cake is wonderful. Very moist, gooey, and rich. But the cool whip "frosting" lightens it up a bit. Great easy cake. And my 6 year old loved helping! A good recipe to get the kids to help with. This will be my "go to" cake recipe from now on when we want cake! And it probably would be great with a homemade cake, but really, I like the ease of boxed and it came out just great. 5 stars!

Loved it.  Have made it twice.  Once with plain cool whip and heath bar, and once with a few alterations...  The one with heath was still great!  But, the next time, I mixed the cool whip with a pkg of instant chocolate pudding and snickers bars.  Follow all the orginal directions, but make these switches.  Incredible... If you LOVE chocolate and caramel!

A friend requested this cake for his birthday and he raved about it.  I made it for my family and they enjoyed it. Stored the remainder of the cake overnight in the fridge and was not as good.  Much better when warm.

Not that I did the dancing, but after two recitals, twelve quick costume changes and cooking all week, I'm beat! My treat to myself was to eat whatever I wanted at our post recital party and after dinner I made sure I ate my share of this amazingly delicious cake. Was it better than sex? Not better, but darn close. Everyone kept coming back for more until there wasn't a morsel left. Thanks a bunch!

This is JUST like my grandmother's cake.  Who god rest her soul, never passed on the recipe before she indeed passed.  It is largely a family favorite and was made for each child on there birthday.  For a less rich version, try using a yellow or white cake.  Also, switch it up by using snickers or butterfinger.  Though Heath makes a lovely already crumbled back of chocolate covered toffee, found in the baking section of your local grocery store.  If not, it is ALWAYS in stock at Walmart.  Thank you for the recipes and all the new memories it will make.  :)

This is my husband's absolute favorite cake.  Like other reviewers I  poked holes in the cake after its baked, before pouring sweetened condensed milk over it. We like to use hot fudge topping instead of caramel, and also like others we use the heath bar toffee bits.  Hubby brought this to work before Christmas for their holiday party, it was devoured, and coworkers were hounding him for the recipe! I don't think we would say the cake quite lives up to its name, but it sure is one delicious cake!!!

This cake was OK, but nothing special. The ingredients sounded great, but the end product just tasted like a moist boxed chocolate cake with cool whip topping. I thought the sweetened condensed milk and caramel flavor would come through, but it didn't, it just made the cake wet. Won't be making this again.

The toffee topping is the best part but i won't make this again. It tastes too much like a "cake in a box", not a great cake for me and not even close to being better than sex.

OUTSTANDING!!!!  I am re-doing my comments with even more praise for this recipe.  I did a little experiment over the weekend and added chocolate pudding to the whipped cream for the topping.  My husband said it was by far the best cake he as ever tasted.  For chocolate lovers, the chocolate pudding in the recipe adds a huge chocolate taste, but surprisingly doesn't make it taste richer.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!  This was easy and INCREDIBLE!  I made if for a friend's birthday and everyone is still talking about it!  I used fat free condensed milk, heath bits and added a bit of vanilla to the whipped topping before spreading it to make it taste a bit more home-made. I will make this over and over!

I made this at Christmas over at my mom's house...We didn't have time to put in in the fridge before serving, but it was delicious anyway. I had some again the next day and wished we waited...it was ten times better. I definitely suggest making it a day ahead so all the caramel can seep in.

I made this before Christmas and told my kids that it was a 'Better than Anything' Cake.  After tasting it, they all agreed.  My 10 year old wants me to make it again as it disappeared too quickly!  
I used Skor English Toffee Bits in place of the chocolate toffee bars to save time.  It was a bit sweet for us, so I will cut back on the toffee bits next time.  I also poked holes in cake instead of just slits and that seemed to work great.  Excellent recipe.

You can't beat this for a quick and easy dessert, but you have to like it sweeeet... My boyfriend thinks this is the best chocolate cake he's ever had, but a few of my friends found it too sweet. I loved it. For those of you who had trouble with the caramel running into the cream, I'd suggest waiting until all the caramel has seeped into the cake (which it will if you make lots of slits), and waiting until the cake has cooled before putting on the whipped topping. I had no problems. It looked gorgeous with extra topped candy on top! Next time I will try this with Butterfingers.

This was absolutely fabulous, and I don't really care for chocolate!  I served this for some friends, and when one guy was asked if it was better than sex, he said "No... OMG it's so moist!"  We all got a pretty good laugh out of it.  I used milky way ice cream topping instead of just the caramel, and topped it with chopped up Heath bars--it was so great!

Phenomenal!!! I made this into a layer cake, and put chocolate mousse in between the layers, and used Milky way Ice cream topping instead of the regular caramel topping. It was to die for!!!!!!

This cake was fabulous.  My boyfriend and I made it last night, and we're definitely not the best bakers, but it came out amazing.  We decided to opt out on the toffee, since I'm not a big fan, and also decided to add whipped topping at serving so that it didn't blend into the cake while warm.  Our suggestion is to use really good chocolate, it's worth it!

Took this cake to a neighborhood block party.  Everyone loved it.  Needless to say, there was none left to take back home. Shucks!!!  I left the chocolate covered toffee bars in bigger chunks as the submitter suggested and I wouldn't do it any other way.  It was Great - My favorite cake.

I didn't really like this cake at all.  The cake seemed to over power all the other flavors, and I regreted that I put the toffee bar on the cake because it was the only thing that tasted good.  To sum it all together, it had a single boring taste, and it wasn't worth getting fat over!

The caramel sauce drizzled-topping bled into the whipped cream by the time the cake was served. Not so pretty. Great taste though.

This was a HIT at the office.  I used time-and-a-half the quantity of condensed milk and caramel, left it overnight and served it on a platter piled high around with strawberries.  They add a nice 'break' to the richness of the cake.  I also used a round ladle handle to make holes - lots of them before saturating the cake. Thanks for making me a hero for the day !

A good cake, but nothing like the name implies.  The sugary sweetness of the caramel and condensed milk is too overpowering for my taste.  The family did like it, however.

I made 4 cakes using this recipe for a function, and every piece was consumed. A very simple recipe, which turns out very good. Rich and moist. Two words of advice -when slicing up the cake for the caramel to drip into, it works better if the cuts are a bit rough. Also, make sure the cake is completely cool before applying the whipped cream, or it has a tendency to melt a bit. (still very good though).

12.13  This recipe was pretty darn good, but next time I will make some minor adjustments...maybe do half fudge and half cream so it doesn't take away from the chocolate flavor as much.  Also, I will make a homemade whipped cream topping.  All in all, everyone loved it!  Thanks!

WONDERFUL, HUGE HIT!  Took it to Bunko and only a few of us were left,(I forgot about it) and someone said where is that cake that is better than sex?? Wwe got it out and fixed some cappacino (don't think that is spelled correctly) and it was SOOOOO good, it was up for debate on whether it was better than sex though, a couple of the girls said it was!!!!! Easy and great to make for a crowd and is better to make it a day or two ahead!!! Plus its always great to have items that can be prepared ahead of time when having a large crowd over . thanks for sharing

This is sooo delicious. One of the best cakes I have ever had in my life. I used the entire can of sweetened condensed milk. Next time I will use the whole 12.25 can of caramel topping. Everyone loved it, but I need to go now. I promised my cousin I would e-mail her the recipe!

This is a great recipe and easy too.
I used a lemon cake mix and a Pampered Chef sauce..Cocnut Lime with the evaporated milk. I also added about 3/4 can of crushed pineapple as I was warming/blending the sauce and the milk.  Used the handle of a small wooden spoon to mKe holes in the top of the cake.
I expected an overly sweet but decadent dessert.  Was I deceived. Everyone loved the result.  No over sweetness. Just a smooth delicious refreshing cake  I will definitely make this one again. The men all had a second piece. Thank you for sharing.  Allrecipes is my go-to recipe site.

I made this recipe as is and it got rave reviews in my household! I did poke holes instead of cut slits and poured the condensed milk/caramel  mixture directly into the holes, then drizzled the remainder over the top of the cake. I personally like the cake to be a little more saturated than dry. I also drizzled chocolate syrup over the top of the cake once all the toppings were on. I will be making this quite a bit more, I'm sure!

Easy to make. Deliciously sinful. I made it for a group of 12 men at hunting camp so I wasn't sure how it would be received. It was a huge hit! Not one piece left in the pan.

This cake was pretty good, but a little too soggy -sweet in my opinion. I altered the recipe on my second cake by not using the milk at all and I used the caramel dipping sauce found in the fruit and veggie aisle. Using the dipping sauce is heavier than ice cream sauce and gave the cake a nice caramel flavor. Since it is heavier, it doesn't get "lost" In the cake.

I actually got the recipes from my cousin a few years ago. But I poke holes in the cake as soon as it comes out the oven and pour the condensed milk on it so it soaks in. I also find if you heat the caramel in microwave first it goes on a lot smoother. And I put hot fudge ice cream topping on it too, which I also heat before spreading. But I'm asked to make this cake for every family event every year. My family loves it.

This cake was perfect! Three things I suggest: 1) when making the cake mix use 1/2 oil & 1/2 applesauce for the amount of oil required on box mix.(makes for a moist cake & no you don't taste it in the cake.) 2)Test for done with toothpick at least 8 min. before suggested baking time. 3) make the day before so dessert mellows & brings out the flavors. I mixed everything as written mixing the milk & caramel on warm in microwave.(defrost) The people who served this & had trouble removing from pan, I think can be a couple of things. 1) served cold from refrigerator & or didn't leave out for about 1 hour before serving. 2) If you mix the caramel & milk as written, the caramel does't get so thick when cold.

Our family has made this recipe for years. We use German Chocolate cake, poke holes with a wooden spoon (as other reviewers have mentioned), and then pour the whole jar of caramel topping into the holes in the warm cake. Then pour the whole can of condensed milk on top of that. Cover and let chill overnight. The top with the cool whip and the crushed toffee. Best cake ever!

I have made this recipe atleast 20 times over the past few years, it is requested at family gatherings and potlocks at work! Hands down best and easiest cake ever. I use a fork to poke my holes, and dont bother with combining the caramel and condensed milk over the stove, that is unnecessary extra work. While the cake is still warm, i poke my holes into my cake, making sure to not reach the bottom of the pan and while the cake is still warm simply pour the condensed milk right the can onto the cake and let it soak for a few minutes then pour the caramel straight from the jar onto the cake and let it soak overnight. I put on my cool whip and chopped heath bars and drizzle with caramel and chocolate sauce to make it pretty right before serving and Whallah! Best cake ever!! "Better than disneyworld cake" to my girls :)

YUMMY! I make other cakes that require adding some kind of filling inside the cake. To make it easier, I bought a plastic container, similar to a ketchup squeeze bottle. I cut the top down to make the opening larger. I filled my bottle with the milk and caramel mixture, took my time and easily filled the holes in the warm cake. I poked holes in the warm cake with a wooden spoon handle and followed a review saying to use the whole can of milk and whole jar of caramel and it was just too wet for me. The second time I watched the video, and used the correct amounts and it was delicious! I frosted with Cool Whipped Frosting. It's sturdier than plain Cool Whip and holds up well when sitting out for a bit, unlike whipped cream. I think I need to save this cake for very special celebrations because it's not exactly lo-cal. Thank you Angelady, I will keep this recipe forever!

I made this for Christmas instead of the ho hum holiday sweets.  It was easy to make and turned out so great that in serving 16 people there was none left.  I made a bundt cake and dug a little (for lack of better words) trench around the bottom surface and poured the caramel/milk mixture in the trench and down the sides.  It was marvelous.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.  Enjoy!

This cake is absolutely amazing! I had always made it with butterfinger candy not toffee and called it butterfinger cake but same basic idea! Only thing I suggest is for visual purposes I always used chocolate syrup on top with the caramel in a zigzag shape. Very yummy!

I really love this recipe and so did everyone who tried it. The only thing I did different is I used german chocolate cake mix instead of devils food cake mix and I think it tastes muchhhh better! Everything else was pretty much exactly like the recipe. I had no problems with the cake being soggy- it was very moist though! Definitely a keeper.

Could you layer this cake? For instance bake the cake in two separate pans, pour condensed milk on both layers and caramel then put one layer on top of the other and cover the whole thing in whipped cream and heath bars?

I love love LOVE this cake. It's very refreshing in the warmer months, and is just so delicious. I usually leave the toffee pieces off because I don't like the crunch, but it's still amazing. Anyone complaining that it's too bland should have their taste buds checked! I always use Hershey's caramel syrup instead of thicker ice cream topping because I think it tastes better. YUM!!!!!

I have to say I was highly disappointed with this cake. I had high expectations because all of the ingredients sounded like they would end up 'better than sex.' But the end product was just OK. It was good, don't get me wrong, but the cake didnt really pick up the flavor of the carmel/condensed milk... it just tasted like a normal chocoalte cake with crushed heathbar on it.

Very good!! Made it for a superbowl party and it was a hit!! The only change I made per other reviews was I used half the oil called for on the box and instead of candy bars I used the Heath chips from the baking isle. Will make again!!

I've been making this cake for a long time, and everyone loves it!  The first times I made it, I didn't read the recipe correctly, and I put the whole can of condensed milk, and a 12 ounce jar of caramel. I still make it this way. Love this cake!!!

My boyfriend is very picky, he won't eat anything his mom doesn't make. I wanted to try and make something he would say was good. I came across this recipe and thought it would be one of a million attempts. As soon as he put it in his mouth he fell in love. He won't stop talking about how good it is. I was so happy that he finally said something I made was good! This cake really is delicious. Everyone who I made try it, said they wanted the recipe or to take some home with them. Its super easy and delicious, what more can you ask for? But I did make one change, I used triple chocolate cake. I suggest this cake!

Turned out great!  only it needed a little more whipped topping and I cooked it in a slightly smaller pan, so the caramel didn't sink all the way to the bottom.

********This is wondeful!!! I made a 9x13 One Bowl Chocolate Cake III (recipe from this site) instead of using a box mix baked at 350 for 40 mins. After pouring the condensed milk/carmel mix on the cake I left it in the frige over night and then I used the rest of the jar of carmel mixed with 2 tbls milk, warmed it up and spead it all over the top of the cake and topped with the crushed choc bars and whipped topping. This was a huge hit at my office. Will make again!

This recipe is so simple and I get asked to make it so often, I can make it from memory now lol.  The only thing I change is that I only use caramel in the holes instead of the sweetened condensed milk mixture.

I have been making this for several years (it was the fad dessert at potlucks about 10 years ago where I live) and it truly is delicious, but very rich.  I make mine with the devil's food cake recipe from this site, poke holes with the bottom of a wooden spoon, then pour a can of sweetened condensed milk on top.  Some times I top with caramel, sometimes chocolate, sometimes I just leave the milk to do its magic.  I usually use 4 heath bars--two on top of the cake, and two more on top of the whipped cream.  I make my own whipped cream with one cup heavy whipping cream, 3 T of powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla whipped at a high speed until stiff peaks.  I drizzle chocolate sauce across the top for elegance and have even topped with strawberries.  I ALWAYS store my cake in the freezer for an added dimension of chewiness--YUM!  Very easy, delicious, and crowd-pleasing dessert.

Excellent.  Only changes I made were to microwave the sweetened condensed milk and caramel and instead of a devil's food, I made a "Black Magic Cake" (recipe on this site) as the base.  I will definitely make this again.

I was pretty impassive about the whole caramel pouring thing. It didn't turn out as planned, but it still made the cake delicious. I designed the beautiful cake and instead of using chocolate toffee, I decided I would just make it an all chocolate cake. I designed it with Hershey's shavings, chunks, and made a crust out of the chocolate. The crust melted around the cake and it looks amazing. Yayy. >;D

I made this for my parents 25th wedding anniversary, and it was a hit! I baked the cake, and poked holes with toothpick, poured the warmed syrup over it (soaks in better) and did the rest as written. AWESOME! Very rich, but really REALLY good. I made mine as 2 tier 9" round cakes. So I poked holes on the bottom layer, poured the 1/2 the milk/caramel mix on it, topped with some crushed skor, put the top cake on, poked holes and poured the sauce on it, and decorated with cool whip, skor bar, and caramel sauce! Looked GOOD and tasted BETTER!

I have been making this cake for a little over seven years now and it disappears everywhere I take it.  I make mine slightly different than what's listed on this particular recipe, but either way will yield the same result I'm sure.  For starters, I poke holes in my cake rather than cut slits, simply because that's the way I learned to make it.  When pouring the condensed milk and caramel I make sure that much of the liquid gets into the holes.  Instead of Devil's Food I use either boxed German Chocolate mix or from-scratch Hershey's Chocolate (any chocolate recipe will work just fine).  I also mix in a box of either chocolate (for richer taste) or French vanilla (for creamier taste) pudding mix in with the dry cake mix ingredients.  As for the wet ingredients I mix in three large eggs, one cup of buttermilk, a quarter cup of warm water, a quarter cup of oil (or melted butter), and half a cup of sour cream.  The addition of sour cream and pudding mix and using buttermilk instead of water make this cake VERY moist and a little heavier, so if you do it this way be sure to keep your cake in the pan you baked it in (don't try to stand it up and frost or anything).  If using boxed cake mix I sometimes use a quarter cup of dry sherry rather than the water to take away from the 'boxed' taste (the sour cream and buttermilk will do that as well).  I then top the cake like the directions say...whipped cream and toffee pieces.  If I have time (and my budget allows), I will make fresh wh

Make it with yellow cake mix instead. Much better.
For show, sprinkle some heath/scor bar on top of the whipped cream!

I love the idea of doctoring up cake mixes to make them taste homemade....but this tastes just like what the ingredients are...a boxed cake with caramel, sweet milk and toffee dumped all over it.  Not that great, but okay. Couldn't get past the overpowering boxed cake flavor (and texture).  There are tons of doctored-up boxed cake recipes from this website that are out of this world, but this is not one of them.  I guess this recipe might be good for a teenager or college student that's just learning how to cook, but I would never make this and serve to guests.

Extreamly SWEET... if i do make this one again, i would try making a HOMEMADE CAKE with No SUGAR! to compensate for the sickly sweet of the condensed milk, caramel and chocolate. Has to be served with unsweeted cream to make it tolerable.

I've made this using the same ingredients but, as others have said, by poking holes in the cake with the back of a wooden spoon before pouring the caramel and condensed milk over it, and then topping with the Cool Whip and toffee pieces. It's a good, quick dessert, but it definitely has a Cool Whip aftertaste which is hard to look past, as it makes the whole thing taste a bit like a "convenience food" to me. Next time I do this I'm going to whip up some cream with a bit of powdered sugar and vanilla flavoring, and hopefully that will do the trick and push this dessert into the 5-star category so many people here seem to think it deserves.

I love this cake!  I use the whole can of milk and also put the carmel sauce in the microwave for a few secs, it makes it easier to pour out.  This is a great cake to bring to a party or for co-works....you can put the cool-whip on once you get this, as to not make a mess in the car.

I have made this several times with the following changes...once the cake comes out of the oven, poke holes with the end of a wooden spoon, then pour the milk (almost the entire can) and caramel (almost the entire jar), let cool then put into the fridge. Spread the whipped topping and then sprinkle the toffee candy on top. I can usually find pre crushed Heath bars at my local Walmart Supercenter. That way all of th ecandy pieces are the same size.

The toppings were just too sweet for me and, believe it or not, for my 3- and 5-year-olds.  And I used real whipped cream, in which I minimized the sugar.  I can only imagine how sweet this recipe must be with whipped topping.  Oh, and I have to say that the cake itself just tasted like a cakemix cake, which makes sense, as that is what it is.

Woohoo! Loved this. I did make a few changes though. I omitted the candy bars and I didn't mix the sweetened condensed milk and caramel togather. I just poured the whole 14 oz can of milk, and the whole 12 oz jar of caramel over the cake. It's sooo gooey and rich.

This was a very good and easy cake to make. I made the following changes from the original recipe: I used 1/2 a can of The Chocolate condensed milk instead of regular. I used Mrs. Richardson's botterscotch carmel sauce, and I used about 7 Heath bars! I took this to a party, so I carried it in a cooler, and topped the cake with a can of real whipped cream from the dairy case, and used the remaining candy bar pieces on top...it was gorgeous! Thanks again for the great recipe.

This was a good cake- however make sure after you cover w/ carmel that you immediately put the topping on while it's hot.

I am a chocolate fan, and to me this is not a real chocolate cake. More like caramel and toffee flavour than chocolate , and it is so sweet. But it is good and has different taste . I made it twice and my family liked it. I gave 4 stars cause chocolate cake is still the best for me.

This is great...  I have made this well over 30 times.... I let the cake cook, and simply pour the carmel (or butterscotch) and condensed milk over the cake... (No need to warm the the topping mixture).  Then I put in the fridge over night.  I then put on the whipped topping just before serving the next day, and break up a "SKOR" candy bar, and drizzle the top with some more carmel/chocolate for that WOW factor. - Always a hit, and they can't believe a BIG DUMB GUY made it.

This cake is ADDICTIVE. I made it for my father using a dark chocolate fudge cake mix as the base. I stole a piece of the finished product before I gave it to him. I had to make a smaller version for myself a few days later(snatching the cake back from my dad would have been a bit tacky). I don't think this cake is better than sex,but it runs a close second.

My husband and I didn't like it, so I gave it to my brother, and he loved it. To me, it was tooth achingly sweet (literally-ouch!) and very soggy. The amount of sauce poured over the cake left it just mushy...but I didn't let it chill before I tried it, so now I'm wondering if that would have firmed it up at all...still, not one I'll bother with perfecting. Thanks though, Elaine.

This cake is easy and delicious!  I decided to make a dessert at the last minute for a dinner party.  I ran to the store to pick up the ingredients and found that I didn't even have time for Cool Whip to thaw. So, I bought white icing instead.  Worked great!  (I can only imagine how good homemade icing would be!)  I took the suggestions below and used a straw to poke holes.  After everyone  moaned about how much better the cake was than sex ;) the first real comment I got was about how moist it was.  Use a straw!  The cake was a huge hit!  So little work for so much taste!

This cake was fairly good.  It reminded me of those Hostess chocolate cupcakes, or a cake made from Ring Dings.  It was pretty good.  And easy to make.  Try making it into a trifle!  Delicious.

This recipe tasted wonderful and got rave reviews.  The only thing I would change is instead of making slits in the cake top, use a straw to poke holes throughout the cake and then pour the caramel mixture on.  It soaks in better that way.  When I did the slits it barely went into the cake and mostly stayed on top, but it still tasted great!  I also used toffee bits instead of the crushed toffee candy.  Again, it was wonderful and decadent!  Enjoy!

This recipe was great. I used Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix instead of Devils Food mix and I also put the 3 Heath bars in the food processor to grind. I'd like to try this recipe with real whipped cream net time.

I have made this cake many times for my friends who love chocolate and it is fantastic and foolproof.  I have used whipped cream a couple of times but I don't really think it needs it.  I loooove the way the chocolate peices melt into a sort of "icing" on top.  A good cake doesn't need to be complicated at all, and this proves it!

I took this cake to work for a potluck and people kept complimenting me on it. I just took a container of Cool Whip that way people could choose to have it with or without. It's great both ways. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday.  After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping for something special.  The cake was ok.  Everyone said it was good, however I had a lot leftover.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I gave the recipe to a co-worker and she said her family thought the cake lived up to its title.

This cake is delicious, although maybe not better than... I used Butterfinger for the crunchy topping instead of the toffee and it was great.  I also used a deep round pan and baked it for a while longer, which I think made it a prettier cake.  All in all, this is a GREAT recipe and it's very easy.  I am definately going to make it again.

I thought this cake was too sweet and sticky, and it still tasted like a mix to me. If I make it again, I would bake my own devils food cake. I used 4 toffee bars. My husband and friends all said they loved it.

Warning: When you make this, Make 2 Pans!!! The first few times i made this, It was gone so quickly that people wanted seconds or it was eaten so fast that some didn't even get to try it!
People keep asking me for this recipe. It is simple and DELICIOUS!

If there was a 10 star rating this recipe would get a 10 from me. This was by far the best chocolate cake I've ever made and very simple. I followed the recipe exactly, I wouldn't change a thing. I will definately make this again and again.

This cake is out of this world. I did it with two round layers instead, and it turned out wonderfully. It isn't called "Better than Sex" for nothing...

i usually like more exciting recipes, but my boyfriend and his friends loved this cake (and the name!).  it is very easy to make.  to reduce fat, i used applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.

So simple to make, but rave reviews from everyone that tries it. I'm up to about 7 Skor bars (save 1 for the topping) and poking holes in it works for me. You have to try this... your friends will love you!

When he asked for something with chocolate and toffee, I found this recipe and made this cake for my husband's birthday.  He absolutely loved it.  I made my own carmel sauce as we like it less sweet and more buttery than the store bought sauces.  I also doubled the toffee bar.  What a hit!

This cake was so easy to make and absolutely delicious. I made it for the first time for a family gathering (informing all that I'd never made it before). It was an instant hit!
Thanx Elaine for a great recipe. This is one I will make again and again!

I made this cake for my grandmother's birthday, and it was a hit!  Most said it was one of the best cakes ther had ever eaten!  Was very moist- wouldn't change a thing except adding maybe 1 more candy bar.  I will make this one again!

Everyone (especially the kids) went wild for this cake at a pool party.  A definate keeper!  I will next time, however, pour more of the carmel sauce into the cake to make it a little more sinful!

This cake was delicious.  I brought it to a fathers day party and everyone scarfed it.  It tastes much like trifle (if you know what it is) but is in cake form and without the liquor.  Will make this one again.

This was extremely good. My best friend's daughter, who does not like chocolate cake, tried it and loved it. Everyone said it was very rich and chocolatey but no one agreed it was better than sex. (Maybe better than sex by yourself)

I'm not much of a cake fan, but based on the reviews, I thought this cake would do it for me...WRONG!  WAY TOO SWEET!  Too many texturesand different flavors mixing.  I thought this cake was kind of gross.  I would definitely not make this again.

i made this cake for my in-laws family for the first time. it turned out great! i think i made a hit with my mother in law, she said she never eats two slices of cake and this was the first time. i broke my 9"x13" pan so i used a bundt cake pan and used a chopstick to make holes on top instead of slits. it turned out great and looked beautiful too after decorating. thanks!!!!

I used 14 oz. sweetened cond. milk, a full jar of Mrs. Richarson butterscotch/caramel topping,and five Heath bars.  Put plenty of perforations through the cake going almost to the bottom.  Pour slowly and allow to absorb before pouring more.

This was a real hit with my dinner guests.  A couple minor tweaks:  Instead of using a saucepan, I stirred the caramel and  condensed milk together in a pyrex measuring cup and microwaved it slightly just to make it a bit more pourable.  I poked holes with a wooden spoon handle instead of carving slits.  I skipped the first layer of toffee bits, and chose to put it only on top of the frosting.  Because my toffee bits had no chocolate in them, I lightly drizzled chocolate syrup over the frosted cake.  A decadent and delicious cake that's a cinch to make.

This cake turned out really well, and everyone really liked it! I don't personally like whipped topping so I just served the cake à la mode. I also substituted the water in the cake mix for coffee to bring out the flavor of the cake more, and make it a moister cake. Along with using coffee I also read that it was better to half the oil for the cake mix to make it a denser cake. To all else who make this cake, enjoy!

It's a great, very rich dessert, but too soggy. I could have done without the sweetened condensed milk altogether and probably had an outstanding cake.

Great simple recipe! I used a tall 9inch diameter circle pan.   I used whipping cream for the topping and made my own condensed milk.   It was moist, yummy and looked great.

I made this as we were having guests for a week and I was bored with the same old, same old, desserts, sssoooo I made this cake.  I was gone in one day and everyone loved it.  I used cool whip as the topping and it tasted great with the heath bar chips.  This is one of the best recipes I have found anywhere.  Thank you for sharing it.

I used a chocolate gluten free cake mix, as my son's girlfriend needs to follow a gluten free diet. She thought she had died & gone to heaven! It was delicious. The Heath bits in the bag, made it even easier to prepare.

I love this cake, however I tweaked it some.  Instead of Devil's food cake, I use Milk Chocolate.  And an easy way to get the crushed chocolate toffee is to buy it already crushed!  It saves time and less mess! You can find it on the backing isle.  It is called Heath Milk Chocolate Toffee Bits with an orange logo on it.  (I use them for so many recipes!) I too use a chop stick....makes the perfect hole.  I share this recipe with so many people....because after they take the first bite....they beg for it!

The cake was delicious and easy to make. It got a little sticky at times ;) But really came out amazing and my room mate and I devoured it! You know it is a good cake when after the first bite, you just cannot stop! I made it again over the holidays, and it was a hit. Then again for dessert after a speech I gave for class. This is just a winner over and over again. I have never had a problem with baking it or making it.

SO amazing! I am not a fan of cake or toffee, but this was moist and really light! I used fresh brewed coffee in place of the water for the cake.

I really feel you need to use the full can of sweetened condensed milk and about twice as much caramel topping. You can get a nice-sized hole with the handle of a wooden spoon.  Don't worry about destroying the top of the cake with holes--it will all be covered with whipped topping in the end anyway!  Try these suggestions and ENJOY!

This cake is SO good! I call it "Candy Bar Cake" because I took it to work all the time, and I didn't want to use this name. (I worked with all men.) Also, they preferred Snicker's bars over Heath. I've made a Reece's Cup one using peanut butter topping instead of caramel. And I made an Oreo cookie one and used chocolate fudge topping. This cake has so many possibilities. Personally, I prefer the original toffee bars.

If this is better than sex, I'd look for a different partner.  It was OK.  Just OK.  Certainly not worthy of the name.

I thought it was edible but I didn't really care for it. I've definitely made better. I think the "chocolate cavity maker cake" recipe from this site is much better. Just pair the cavity maker with some cool whip on the side and voila!!...the easiest, tastiest boxed cake recipe ever! In my opinion the most "pizzazzy" thing about this "better than sex cake" is its name...the flavor is lackluster. I am very disappointed.

This was really, really yummy. I made it for a crowd, and the guests could not stop raving about it. I gave it 4 stars because I was disappointed with the amount of wasted caramel that dripped over the sides of the cake while I was pouring it. The result was a lot of caramel on the wax paper, and a very thin layer of caramel on the actual cake. I'm wondering if I could somehow scrape up the caramel drippings from the wax paper and use a spatula to spread it onto the top of the cake? If I could salvage the wasted caramel, it would probably add a more pronounced caramel flavor/texture to the cake. I would make this again!

I love this recipe for an easy dessert to bring for gatherings or family events. I found the caramel/condensed milk didn't distribute well with the holes from a wooden spoon as others suggested, so for better distribution, I scored the top diagonally from the corners. It's also easier to get it to sink in if you have another person use the bottom of a spoon to direct it into the scores after pouring. I also speed up cooling by putting it in the freezer for 20-30 min. before topping it. It's still really easy and tastes amazing!

I've never had or made this cake before - it was delicious but very sweet.  I used real whipping cream instead of coolwhip on it which has no sweet to it at all and it was still very rich.

Delicious. I altered it slightly (cut up cake, layered the different ingredients, as well as just added condensed milk and caramel as is without heating them together). Brought it for a birthday at work, and a few people said it earned the name. At home we ate the leftovers directly from a serving spoon. It barely lasted the day.

I do what the most helpful reviewer does: Right when I pull the cake out of the oven, I take the handle of a wooden spoon and poke holes all over the cake (it doesn't matter if you hit the bottom of the pan or not). I  then poor the caramel directly into the holes and then do the same with a full can of sweetened condensed milk. Once the cake cools, I top it with the Cool Whip and then top that with the toffee bars crunched up (Heath & Skor bars seem to work very well). I also make this cake 2 days in advance so it will be more moist and gooey.

I've been using this recipe for over five years now.  It's become my signature cake!  A few secrets: Works amazingly well with Duncan Hines' version of Devil's Food Cake. I make this a double layer cake, and only poke holes halfway through each layer.  I only use about half the amount of the caramel/condensed milk mixture for the full cake (so a quarter of it per layer).  I also add some crushed toffee in between the layers, before I frost it.  I drip chocolate sauce across the top instead of caramel, and of course add more crushed toffee bar bits on top as well, and a few strawberries!  Seriously, best. cake. ever.

I haven't made this cake in years.  My son asked about this it and I didn't have a recipe so I used this one.  It was really good but I think next time I will take the advice of other reviewers.  I will use the whole can of sweetened condensed milk & a whole jar of caramel sauce.  It is yummy and I would recommend this delicous cake!

I am the kind of person who enjoys the frosting more than the cake itself.  This type of cake is perfect because the caramel mixture permeates the entire cake, making it hard to taste that "cake-mix" flavor!  I used a chopstick to poke large holes, which I felt helped the cake better absorb the caramel mixture.  I saw that some people complained the cake was too soggy/fell apart - I used Duncan Hines mix, which has no pudding in it and therefore is less prone to sogginess.  I was also careful not to poke the holes completely through the cake.  I had no trouble with cutting and serving this cake.  It was devoured by a small group and I had multiple requests for the recipe!  Will definitely make again.

I poked holes with a fork as soon as it came out of the oven and added the caramel sauce and condensed milk right away then refrigerated added the whipped cream and used butter fingers and more caramel on top. It was so good. My husband told me it was the best cake he ever had!

Great! Used several of the modifications that I read. ie: let cake cool, then poked holes into cake with handle of wooden spoon not quite all the way to bottom. Drizzled 1 can sweetened condensed milk alternating with caramel over top of cake. (I did not warm them first) Sprinkled liberally with candy pieces, then let cool completely. Spread whipped topping over all. Then drizzledd with more caramel, Hershey's chocolate and sprinkled more candy pieces. Refrigerated for a couple of hours before serving.

My family loves this recipe.  I actually poke holes to the bottom as soon as i take the cake out of the over.  I like the gooiness all the way through. I also add hot fudge along with the carmel.  Sooo yummy.

I actually was making this cake as a surprise for a friend who's grandmother used to make this for her.  When she saw it she immediately started crying.  I cried after I tasted it!  It was simply delicious and gooey! The hidden layer of crushed toffee was perfectly enveloped between the cool layer of whip cream and warm layer of cake and sauce.  I wish I could give this more than 5 stars to be honest!

Delicious!!!  I have made this with creamy cool whip and also making my own whip cream using sugar and whipping cream and either way it is amazing!  My fiance isn't a fan of the Heath so I am going to try it with Snickers and maybe Butterfingers sometime.

I'm not a fan of caramel, nor super-rich desserts, but this was light, fluffy, very flavorful and rec'd rave reviews from our dinner party guests. :)

wow very very rich and tasty caramel and chocolate are an excellent combination... this recipe is super easy to make and everyone loves it... the cake mix I had was a little old so it didn't rise like it should have so the cake was more dense... similar to the idea one reviewer had of using half the oil... mine sat in the refridgerator for 24 hours and did not get soggy.. I also melted down carmels mixing them with milk to make the caramel sauce... i made it thicker than the ice cream topping probably is.... turned out good was not soggy at all... only other thing i might do different is make my own whipped topping instead of using cool whip.... great recipe thanks!!

This was an amazing cake.  Served it to our pinochle group and everyone raved.  I do think next time I will use more carmel and condensed milk.  Can't wait to make it again.

I love this & I have made it several times. I had it in one of my cookbooks that I had bought from a collection of recipes put together. I can't find that cookbook now, so I googled it, so I would have the recipe. When I make it, I usually leave out the condensed milk to save calories, it is still delicious! I would give it  6 stars for rating, I could not get the stars to show up.

I had such high hopes for this cake, but once it was done, everything was cooled and the toppings finished it off, I was honestly disappointed when I ate a piece. It was surprisingly...bland. That's ok bc a lot of people reviewed that they liked it, guess it's not for EVERY BODY :-)

Great dessert! I take one to work for 8am and it's usually gone by 11am. I bake the cake with applesauce instead of oil, fat free cool whip, and sugar-free carmel topping. Yummy! : )

My sweet tooth must be horrible because I didn't find this cake as sweet as another Better than Sex cake recipe I've used.  The only thing I did differently with this recipe was use a straw to poke holes in the cake and used toffee chips (in same aisle as chocolate chips)in place of toffee bars.  The other recipe I used called for German Chocolate cake and I liked that better than the Devil's Food cake.  This cake turned out very moist and my family gobbled it up and really enjoyed it.

Very nice moist cake. Like everyone else I added my own twists/variations. I used Carmel and sweetened cond. milk as it said but i just stired them together in a bowl until blened with a spood and poured it on room temp. I did not see the need to heat it. Also, I bought the bag off toffee chips in the baking isle. They do NOT have chocolate so I also added a scant cup of nestle mini chocolate chips with the toffee chips. I suppose if you do not like chocolate so much omit the tiny mini choco chips and if you are a chocolate hound add even more. :)  I stuck it back in the TURNED OFF oven for about 10 mins to let the candies settle then put it in the fridge. I used left over toffee chips/mini chocolate chips and a cpl tablspoons of reserved carmel sauce drizzled over the top of the whipped cream for decor. It looked like a sin, tasted like a big sin and put a smile on every face that seen/tasted it! We also renamed it as we have a 6 month old and a 2 yr old that do not understand such titles! lol We called it Better than cartoons cake! LOL I suppose as kids age the name gets changed to many different things!!!

Yum. I made cake per box. Poked holes in cake with a wooden spoon - per reviews. Drizzled the caramel/milk mixture (using fat free sweetened condensed milk) into the holes. Sprinkled heath crumbs...and then I topped with more heath crumbs mixed in with the cool whip, put stripes of Hershey syrup on top and then pulled a knife through the chocolate in alternating directions. So moist - like dulce de leche cake........our guests loved it!

WOW!  I made this for my husband's birthday party and everyone LOVED it!  I loved it because it was super easy to make on top of tasting amazingly decandent.  (I used chocolate fudge cake mix) I put the candy bars in the freezer while preparing the cake, found this made them easier to break. Also, I put those crushed candy bars all over the sides of the cake: I took handfulls  of candy and pressed it gently aginst the sides of the cake.  A bit of a messy process, but definitely increased the wow factor.

This is a solid chocolate cake recipe. My mom requests this a lot. I've tried using caramel and hot fudge sauce and prefer using the hot fudge :) I prefer Skoar bars over any other type and poke hole in the cake using a large serving fork. Also instead of whipped frozen topping I buy heavy whipping cream and I make my own whipped topping. Really makes this cake.

Cake is awesome.  Of course.  May I recommend, however, that you go ahead and make 2 cakes? Just grab an extra cake mix and a larger container of Cool Whip.  If not, you basically end up throwing away half a jar of caramel and half a can of condensed milk.  May as well take one to work and keep one for the fam!  Another hint: don't worry about cutting nice slits into the cake.  Just tear back small holes and pour in the goodness.  The first time I made it, I cut slits, then poured it over.  Most of it didn't soak into the slits...it just flowed to the sides.  Next time around, I tore small holes back w/a knife while I poured.  Much better!

It was so yummy and super easy to make.  My husband does not like chocolate cake but really enjoyed this...  I did heat the carmel and milk just on a really low heat and glad I did. I just didn't use the whole mixture over cake; afraid that the cake would be too wet.

Everybody loved it. I did follow other reviewers' suggestions and never heated caramel or milk, just straight from the can. Worked great.

I'm going to be the lone dissenter here.  We just thought this cake was ok.  There was nothing wrong with the taste.  We followed the recipe exactly.  Just wasn't our thing.  Thanks for sharing.

This is an awsome recipe but I DID make changes, MOSTLY because the grocer I went to didnt have heath bars, or chocolate bars with toffee. But the base of this recipe is so awsome. I have made it several times over, and each time within no time flat there is no cake left.  These are the changes I made. This is a wonderful recipe, but i kind of took off with it hehe: I used double chocolate cake mix, the whole can of sweetened condensed milk, and instead of candy bars (because the grocer didnt have the right ones), I used chocolate sauce and toffee chips, Fat Free Coolwhip, and to grease the pan I used Coconut Oil (yeah i know its bad for you). After baking the cake and using a wooden spoon handle to poke the holes in several places, I put in a couple toffee chips in each hole, added 1/2 the can of milk, a small drizzle of chocolate, another couple toffee chips, and the rest of the can of milk. drizzled chocolate in a zig-zag over the entire cake, and then let it cool for an hour. Once the cake was cooled I used the coolwhip as the topping, then drizzled more chocolate and then sprinkled toffee over the entire thing.  My mother's husband kind of stole the cake and ate the entire thing over night, and I have made this several times for my friends.  It came out VERY rich, but VERY tasty and sweet, and everyone who has tasted this now requests this every single time I am to bring a cake. Sorry, didnt mean to over-take the recipe, because yours is TRUELY wonderful and VERRRRRRY go

This is such a deliciously decadent desert. To make it even easier, I whisk together the canned milk and carmel topping and pour it directly on the cake while it's still warm.  It's wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.

Yummy dessert that was devoured by everyone!  I did use a full 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk, a full 10 oz. jar of caramel ice cream topping, and Skor bars.  Hubby swears it tasted even better the next day.  :)

I just made this cake and it's AWESOME! My 8 yr old didn't like the name though. :0) So we renamed it a G rated name: Better Then Having to Go to  Bed Cake. lolol I followed the recipe up to the Whipped Topping. My 8 yr old doesn't like it so I substituted it with a jar of marshmallow fluff. I also used a 1/2 bag of Heath broken candy pieces instead of buying the candy bars (less expensive that way). Thanks for sharing!

This is a sure winner.  I add only half the caramel though, because it ends up too sweet for my taste buds.  It's one of those "died and gone to heaven" cakes.

This same recipe can be changed with different flavored cake mixes.  Try caramel cake mix instead of chocolate and use chocolate syrup instead of caramel. I have used strawberry, orange and yellow and changed the toppings for each.  Use your imagination!!!

WOW, this is an awesome cake!  I did cut down on the sweetness by reducing caramel and sweetened milk.  I also omitted whipped topping as I thought it tasted just as good without it.

I've had this recipe sitting around for years and finally tried it. Well worth the wait!  I brought it to a family party, where it was devoured.  I sprinkle choc chips on top halfway through baking for some extra melty goodness, and use a wooden spoon to poke holes in the cake after removing from oven.  Pounr condensed milk on top, let it soak in , then pour caramel sauce (I use the entire bottle).  Sinfully delicious!

This cake is delicious!  (Although I'm not sure if I agree with the title ;-)  I made it into a two-layer 8" cake, putting slits into each layer then using caramel sauce and toffee bits as the filling between the two :-9  I didn't change anything from the recipe other than that.  I think this might be a great way to spice up the from-scratch chocolate cake I usually make!  I'll use it again for sure!

This is such a simple recipe, with spectacular results.  I have made it many times and it is always good.  I prefer to whip up my own whipped cream, rather than using cool whip.  I sweeten it very little, so that the overall cake is not too sweet.

We all love this cake in our family. Our 8 year-old son was mortified at the name, so we call it the "Yummiest Cake Ever" when we make it.

This has always been a favorite of mine, but a few revisions I've made is after the first 10 minutes of baking the cake mix, I sprinkle chocolate chips throughout the cake, then place back into the oven and bake the remainder of the time. Another change is that I use HOMEMADE whipped cream (whipping cream, vanilla & sugar beat @ a high speed)instead of premade whipped topping. SOO much better!!

This cake was absolutely delicious!  Even my brother, who hates cakes, really enjoyed it.  
I did make a couple changes to the recipie. Right when the cake came out I, like others, poked holes in the cake with the back of a wooden spoon.  I filled the holes with carmel.  Then covered the cake with a thin layer of the carmel and condensed milk mixture.
Also, Instead of candy, i cut strawberris thinly and covered the entire cake with a layer of strawberry's, then coverd them with cool whip, and put more strawberries on top and sprinkled it with heath candy pieces.
it was sooo good, the strawberries really add an explovsive taste to the cake.

This is probably my favorite cake!  It is the first time I've made it.  Next time I will use the entire can of sweetened condensed milk and caramel sauce because half just wasn't enough.

Yum!  Made this recipe as is, and it definitely needs some more Heath candy.  Next time I'd use 4 bars on the cake, and one more for on top of the cool whip.  I also think I'd use the whole can of milk and more caramel.  Thanks!

This cake is phenomenal!  I don't care for baking mixes, but this is an exception.  As suggested previously, I always make it a day in advance to let the caramel mixture seep into the cake.  I made this for a family dinner one night and my sister asked for the recipe - she is an incredible cook, so that was a huge compliment!

I made this for our church picnic and EVERYONE wanted the recipe! I did make the changes that were recommended by other reviewers. I used the whole jar of carmel topping, the whole can of condensed milk and three regular size Heath bars that I froze to make breaking them easy. This cake was a crowd pleaser. I would make it again! Thank you!

Loved this cake, and so did my in-laws, and neighbors (who I shared it with).  Used the entire can of sweetened condensed milk, and a large 20-ounce jar of butterscotch caramel topping.  Used light cool whip, and 5 total, regular size Heath bars.  It was perfect this way!  Everyone loved it, as did I!  WONDERFUL!

I've made this cake three times now, and each time it was a big hit. Definitely use an entire can of caramel and an entire can of sweetened condensed milk. I use the caramel that can be heated and heat it up in the microwave for 45 seconds before pouring over the cake. Allow the cake to cool completely before puncturing with a fork and pouring milk and caramel over it and spreading crushed Heath bar over the top, then allow to stand at least an hour before spreading Cool Whip on top. Also, it's paramount that the cake sit in the fridge at least 24 hours before serving to allow the flavors to merge together. I use at six Heath bars crushed for the topping.

I really enjoyed how easy it was, but the whipped topping was extremely complimentary to the moistness of the cake. It was fun to make and everyone that took a bite LOVED it!

excellent. the only thing I changed was instead of cool whip, which I thought would be too sweet, I whipped up some cream- unsweetened and it worked very well with the rest of the cake being so sweet.

This cake is easy and FABULOUS!  I usually buy a bag of Heath Toffee chips (you can find them by the chocolate chips) instead of chopping bars.  This is probably the most requested dessert recipe at my family gatherings!  I like to call it the "Better than my EX cake!" hehehe

Just a tip to change the base cake a little...I added Instant Chocolate pudding mix and sour cream to the cake batter and it makes the cake richer and creamier (reduce the water a bit).

Wow.  Ooey, gooey and delicious. Very quick to prepare also.  I used German Chocolate instead of Devils Food.  I also skipped the toffee.  
This was great and really hit the spot. However, I'm giving it 3 stars because it is a mix cake and does taste like it.

Wow! This was really good & soooo easy. Only thing I did differently was I used a wooden spoon handle to poke holes in the cake instead of slits. This cake disappeared quickly in my tiny household of 3! I really like how the lightness of the whipped cream balanced out the richness of the chocolate & caramel. Yum!

I am still confused as to whether or not I used the right amount of milk.  The recipe says 1/2 can (14 0z) milk.  Does that mean 1/2 of a 14 oz can or is the 14 oz can a smaller version of a more standard 28 oz can.  I checked other recipes to be sure and some said to use 7 oz and some said to use 14 oz.  I decided to use 7 oz.  While I was drizzling the mixture I really felt like I was saturating the cake so I didn't even use the full 7 oz mixture. It still turned out very yummy!  I would recommend that if you like it sweet, use all 7oz or more, if you like it less sweet then use about 3/4 of the 7 oz mixture.  Am I confusing everyone yet?  Bottom line is the cake tastes great there is just confusion, for me, on the ingredients.

I made this for a Mom's Night Out and everyone loved it so much I'm now the official dessert maker!  I followed other suggestions, and used a wooden spoon handle to put holes in cake, and poored milk and caramel in holes.  My family loves this, and I've made it 3 times since the first time 3 weeks ago!  Thanks!

Good tip about breaking the toffee bars into big chunks! It was great! I have no desire to ever marry, as long as I keep making this cake!  Haha!

Everyone seemed to love this cake.  I made it once and it was a hit.  The second time I made it, I think I waited too long before I cut the slits into it, and when I poured the caramel syrup in it, the cake was drowning.  Overall, great cake though.

I made this cake twice thinking I had done something wrong the first time and I wasnt thrilled with either one. It  is a very moist chocolate cake but I was expecting to be able to taste the caramel mixture better. It just blends in and you cant really taste it at all, but it definately makes it moist. Everyone said it tasted  great as a chocolate cake, but the most dominant taste is the toffee bar. I guess I was just expecting something more unique out of the recipe.

It's always nice to have some quick tricks to dress up a box cake.  This was very good, and is a nice alternative to frosting.  I had a bag of Heath bits so I used those instead.  We didn't have any Cool Whip, but I think this tasted fine without it.  To me, not "better than sex", but still very good.  My other favorite way to dress up a boxed cake is with pineapple upside down cake - some butter and brown suger, pineapple rings and maraschino cherries and voila!

Excellent!!!  In all fairness to my husband I have to say this cake is not better than sex, but it is definitely a very close second!  I used the handle of a wooden spoon to make holes instead of slits (like so many others have suggested) and poured the caramel mixture very slowly into each hole to make sure it sinks in.  I made it the day before the party and then put the cool whip and extra candy bar bits on top the morning of, it was fantastic!  Everybody who tried it raved about how moist and delicious it was and insist that I must make this cake for every family function in the future!  Thank you Elaine for this amazing cake recipe!!!

Everyone I served this to thought it was one of the best cakes they've ever had and they all had seconds. I didn't really care for all the whipped topping on it but that's just me. I decorated with swirls of both caramel and chocolate ice cream topping and cut two of the bars in chunks for under the whipped topping and crushed the 3rd into crumbs to sprinkle over the topping. I think it had a really nice appearance this way.

Very delicious - I used Milky Way topping instead of caramel, and you may want to consider the "poke cake" variation where instead of slits in the top of the devil's food cake, you make holes, generally with the "wrong end" of a spoon, that the topping fills up.

This was a great recipe. We brought it to a potluck and there were 6 other cakes and mine was the only one completely gone!  I also drizzled some of the left over caramel on the top of the cake.  I bought Heath bar pieces from the baking section, which saved me some time.

I don't understand what the people who rated this recipe as poor were thinking.  This was unbelievable!!  I made it for a work function and everyone loved it.  I would suggest refrigerating it overnight with the caramel and toffee.  Put the whipped topping on it right before serving.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Wonderful cake! It's dangerous though, I could eat the whole thing!!  I'm a teacher and I recently made this for some of my 7th grade students (of course I didn't tell them the NAME of the cake).  Well, those kids absolutely devoured this cake!  I had to stop some of them from going back for their 4th piece.  I made some variations: added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips into batter, poked holes with skewer and small wooden spoon instead of slits, sprinkled cake with toffee bits and mini chips before frosting with real whipped cream, drizzled top with choc. syrup and mini chips. Let it sit overnight or several hours before serving.

OH WOW!!!  It is better than...!!!  I used a straw to poke holes about 1/2 inch apart, opposed to slitting cake.  I do that with the yellow cake version.  This is an awesome recipe!!!

I made this cake for my hubby's birthday on Xmas Eve and it was wonderful. Everyone liked it and it was pretty simple to make. My only complaint is that it is a very rich and sweet dessert which really isn't a bad thing, just a little more than I, myself, prefer. I am going to make this for my brother in law for his birthday too! He will love this!

This was a fun cake to make, although a bit hard to get things to "sink" into the cake after it was baked.  Also, the finished dessert was VERY sweet.  make sure you have a glass of milk on hand!

Great cake - family and friends loved it. I used Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate Fudge cake and added 1 more Heath bar (two on the cake layer and two over the whipped topping layer) I've been asked for the recipe already - wonderful and easy to make.

Just average, was not overly impressed, not a bad cake I probably just had my expectations raised too high.  I made it 2x and the second time I did not use a cake mix I made the fudge cake from this site and that made it better.  Good cake just not a wonderful cake

I think this cake is great, but instead of mixing the condensed milk and carmel in a pan; I pull the cake out of the oven and let it cool till warm and poke holes into cake without going to the bottom and I pour both items seperate on top of the cake. I think this is easier and then you can decide how much or little. This cake is to die for I know it sounds nuts but its so rich its fantastic.

My family loved this cake.  I didn't put the whipped cream on the cake either.  I gave the option as I sliced it and used the whipped cream in the can instead of cool whip.

THIS IS TOTALLY DELICIOUS!!  Do be patient and wait until the caramel topping has cooled tho before you put on the Cool Whip.  :)

Great recipe!  I used a chocolate butter cake mix, and chocolate mousse for the topping instead of Cool Whip.  Turned out very moist!  Can't wait to try some other variations!  The straw idea worked great!

This cake is just perfect.  I too used a straw to poke holes in the cake.  This allowed the caramel to seep deep into the cake, causing it to be extremely moist.  It is a great recipe for someone who is still new at cooking.  There is no way to really mess up this recipe.  I do suggest adding at least 2 more crushed Health Bars to the top of the cake.  I had a hard time really being able to taste the toffee because of the cool whip on top.  Biggest piece of advise on this cake is to let the cake cool completely otherwise your cool whip will melt. I made it for my neighbors who just had a baby.  They "loved" it.

This is a very rich cake with the whipped topping and the caramel. We will leave off the whipped topping next time. Lots of cake for 2 people! We had it in our fridge for a week.

This recipe was just ok.  I decided to follow this recipe exactly as written, but my instincts were right.  The cake tasted like a boxed cake.  I will definately use my own homemade chocolate cake when or if I make it again.

This was awesome! I've had several requests for this recipe and people think I'm a great baker now. Ha Ha. The only thing different I did was (since my store didn't have any Heath or Skor bars), I used Hershey Symphony Bar with toffee and almonds and I will definitely do it again. Delicious!!!

This cake is great! I bought caramel ice cream topping that was in a squeeze bottle. After I heated the caramel and sweetened condensed milk, I poured it back into the bottle and found it very easy to "squirt" the mixture into the slits. Also, I used a lot more caramel than the recipe called for (you can never have too much) and it was good! I also tried this recipe with a "Butter" cake instead and it was wonderful too!

I don't think 5 stars is enough for this recipe. I brought it to a party and it was the hit of the party. The only thing I changed was I used whipped icing instead of whipped topping. Wow!!Delicious!!!

This cake was too die for!  My guests just raved and I sent the recipe home with them!  I only had one piece left and I was glad to have some leftover for the next day!  Anyone who doesn't like this recipe doesn't know whats good!  What could be bad? Chocolate, Caramel, Heath Bars and Whipped Cream at once!  Yummy!  I would give this recipe more stars if could!

Great, great, great. I made this for a fall party and had awesome reviews. I made some changes though. I added a bit of chocolate frosting to the whipped cream and made two 8 inch cakes instead of one. It was excellent, I will make it again and again!

Absolutely Fabulous!  This cake was so easy to make, even for me.  I substituted the carmel ice cream topping with Dulce de Leche ice cream topping.  Be careful with the whipped topping as it melted in the car on the way there.  Although it didn't look as pretty as it originally started out, no one seemed to mind as it was quickly gone and everyone kept asking for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Elaine.  Simply sinful...

This was really easy to make, which is great, but the taste just wasn't as good as the title makes it out to be.  I'm not real big on chocolate, so maybe I'll try it with a yellow cake next time.

I got this recipe about a year ago, and I have to say it is the most delicious dessert that I have ever made.  I have made it for bake sales at work, holiday parties, and get togethers with my friends.  I have gotten so many praises for this yummy treat.  My only problem now is always having to make everytime I'm invited somewhere!!!

I don't think I agree with the title but it is very good and very easy.  I used caramel syrup instead of the thicker topping and it still worked great.  The toffee pieces were so good.  Rave reviews from my in-laws!

This is a wonderful recipe, I found I liked it much better after it sat in the refridgerator for a day, YUM! My 12 yr old asked me to make this everyday! :-) Of course I had yo rename it to 'Chocolate Toffee Cake' for the kids...

This recipe is FANTASTIC and was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving!  It just gets better day after day and the caramel and condensed milk make it incredibly moist.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and poked holes in the cake with the handle of a wooden spoon and poured the caramel mixture in the holes.  Next time I'm going to try a cake mix with pudding in it!  Mmmmm, I can't wait!

This recipe is soooooooo good! My Mother used to make a similar version to this one.Instead of using caramel sause and toffee bars,she used butterscotch sauce and butterfinger bars! It's great made that way also,but this is even better!

  Thanks,
   Amy

I made this for a family get together and everyone absolutely raved about it.  
My two sons took extra pieces home for a "snack" later.  I made the recipe 
exactly as is except used a chocolate fudge cake mix with the pudding.  It was 
easy to make, tastes great, and just the perfect dessert for a little special treat 
for those rare occassions with you need a treat and can "pretend" the calories 
don't exist.  It's a KEEPER!

This cake didn't quite live up to its reputation, but it's still pretty good.  Note that according to the given weights, the caramel sauce only requires 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 jar of caramel topping.  I definitely recommend making extra topping to swirl on top at the end.  I missed that note, and I think the cake would've been better had I done it!

Followed directions and cake was soggy tasting.   I was very disappointed.  I liked the flavors, but there's no way I would serve this to my family.

I have made this recipe many times.  It can get gooey/ goopy/ soggy and my kids say it's too sweet. However,  many people love the cake for its gooeyness. If you like it less gooey, My fix is to cut the milk down by at least half, if not more (I use approximately 1/3 of a 14 oz can) and do the same thing with the Carmel topping. I then put a spoonful of whip cream on each piece instead of covering the entire cake at once. It still tastes great but not as goopy.

Thank you for such a great and yummy recipe! I am not a fan of cake and neither is my husband. But the both of us loved this and shared with our neighbors so we didn't eat the whole thing! Will definitely make again and poke holes instead of slits.

I made the cake to bring for a dessert for dinner.  I think there was a little too much caramel.  Next time would use less.   I used a package of heath bar  chips from where you would find chocolate chips.    The other people really liked it so would make again just adjusting the caramel.  Make sure also you don't go to deep with the wholes in the cake.

Made this for my wife on Mother’s Day. Didn’t make any significant substitutions. Used the holes rather than cut method. Used Duncan Hines Devil Food Cake, Smucker’s Salted Caramel topping, crushed Heath Bars, & Cool Whip. Pretty sure I used more Heath Bars than the recipe called for.

I made the recipe pretty much as written and suggested.  I used the entire can of condensed milk.  I poked the holes with a swizzle stick.  Did not mix the milk and caramel, just added the caramel and then the milk.  I used 5 Heath bars.  3 under the topping and 2 crushed to garnish.  I added a huge strawberry to garnish the plate and used the remaining caramel (put in a squeeze ketchup bottle) drizzeled on top.  Everyone cleaned their plates!

I thought it was very good the mistake I made was not warming the caramel and milk up before putting it on the warm cake so it never did soak in....even after several days it's still stayed on top of the cake I will definitely make it again for a barbecue

Delicious.  I used less oil than the box mix called for to make the cake a little denser,  used the whole can of condensed milk, used a wooden spoon to make the holes ( about 1-2" apart).  Also used chocolate sauce in addition to the  caramel sauce.  I poured the caramel and chocolate sauces right into the  holes
Made my own whipped cream which I stabilized with  some powdered sugar at the end of the whipping process. 
Made it in the AM and let it all sit in the frig till evening. Company loved it and was still good  the next day

It is delicious. I had this at a birthday party and got the name of it and had to make it myself. When i had it, it was made with crushed butterfingers so that's how i also made it and its perfect like this.

Have had this cake at parties, but this was the first time making. Turned out great! The toffee pieces are a MUST. Didn't have them and tried it without, but it was not the same. Went to the store just to buy Heath bars then crushed and scattered on top. Since this would be eaten over time, I added the whipped topping when serving so it didn't get too wet. YUM!

It looks amazing and i would bake it for thanksgiving, but if i do say that this is on recipe that looks hard but in the end you do get a good cake. if your not sure it not enough caramel ( that what i thought), don't worry you can buy more or it will turn out well. the cake is made by how you want it so that means you can put extra to it. don get made at that person if it doesn't turn out right, unless it but a hole bunch of oil in it or something just be happy that you tried.

Terrific cake if you follow the directions..Because I am a brat, I added crushed dry roasted peanuts to the batter and saved some for the top as well..Be brave and add chocolate chips to the batter..There are no good restaurants in Heaven, so I'm told!

I have made this cake for 20 years but i use butter instead of oil and boiling hot water to wake up the coco in the cake I also use two boxes of fudge 
 in cake mix (because I have a big family) and add 7-8 eggs it makes a more professional bakery like cake..simply delicious. Tip add sweet condensed milk & Carmel while hot. Then let completely cool add cool whip and heath or score candy topping..enjoy,

I have made this cake for many years.  I do all the birthday cakes at work, and this is the number 1 request.  Although too super sweet and soggy for me, they all rave about it.  So for them a five...for me a 3 star.  I don't mix the SC milk and caramel, just do one and then the other.  Best after several hours or overnight.  I also buy the Hershey Milk Chocolate toffee bits and add a few mini semi sweet chocolate chips both over the cake and topping.  A few swirls of chocolate and of caramel syrup make it look perfect!

Excellent! The name lends itself to some interesting conversation starters. The cake is fantastic! I love it as it is. But I've also made it with melted peanut butter and crushed peanut butter cups. It's yummy that way too. You could probably use any candy bar you like and modify the "filling" accordingly.

I made this for a family potluck/Fourth of July cookout and it was a hit. This recipe was delicious as is. I didn't make any changes to it, although next time I might try it with Butterfingers instead of Heath bars just because that sounds yummy, too. :)

In order for the sauce to seep thru use a wooden spoon to poke holes in the cake!  You can also use butter fingers instead.

This is delicious and I was skeptical about this recipe.  I thought pouring the milk and caramel over the cake would make it soggy but it didn't.   I used the full jar of caramel and added chopped pecans on top.

I absolutely LOVE this cake and I'm not even a chocolate fan. I did make a few changes. i seen a lot of others where having trouble getting caramel in the holes good. i used a whole can of the sweetend milk and the caramel it calls for. Make sure the cake is not cooked too too done that it's good an moist but still done for the holes to come out better then instead of just pouring the caramel mixture all over the cake i slowly poured a little mixture into each an every hole and then poured the left over mixture all over the top of the cake. I have made this cake 5 times now and every time the caramel mixture is all through the cake and keeps it moist longer then most cakes. I also used chopped up twix instead! This is my all time favorite cake now. My husband begs me every week to make it. Lol. Thanks all recipies for this wonderful recipe!!

I was disappointed with this cake.  I expected it to be oh so gooey and decadent, but it just tasted like chocolate cake with whipped cream icing.  Was much blander and dryer than I expected

We creating a product inspired by this cake, so I had to do "research". Like many others mentioned, I should have poked holes in the cake with a wooden spoon handle before pouring over the topping.

Instead of opening the sweetened condensed milk and adding caramel topping to it, I poked two tiny holes in the top of the can and boiled in hot water for three hours.  I did use the caramel topping for aesthetic purposes after spreading the whipped cream on the cake.

The cakes was absolutely delicious. I hope our product can live up to its name.

I've been making this cake for years.. but as soon as I take the cake out of the oven I get a fork and poke holes all over immediately then pour my sauce over and top with a crushed up Butterfinger bar.  Put in the refrigerator to cool then top with cool whip and another Butterfinger.  I crush the candy bar in a zip lock bag .

I made this and it was a hit! The one thing I did different I did cool on wire rack, but placed it in a cake carrier before I pored any of the Carmel sauce onto it, and on top after I put the whip topping on, I put the crushed chocolate toffee, and Carmel. I added Hershey's chocolate sauce drizzled on as well.

This is the cake I make for my husband's birthday every year. I use the whole can of condensed milk and the whole jar of caramel sauce. I also cut the cake in every direction possible on the top so the sauce really sinks down into it. No one sees the top once you put the whipped cream on it so go to town with your slices. I also buy toffee chunks and Heath Bar chunks. The more the merrier, right? I layer the chunks on before putting the whipped topping down and then sprinkle more on top of the whipped topping. 

You won't get a frown from anyone who eats this cake! Looking forward to November 30th, lol!

Perfect!  I prefer to follow the given directions.  My husband likes to substitute the caramel for butterscotch.  He also likes to add all of the toffee (heath bar) to the top of the Cool Whip.

Loved this!!!  Very moist, great flavor. We changed nothing! You could add any type of candy bar that you like as a topping.  Might change it next time, but the base of this is perfect!!

Wife requests that I use milk chocolate cake mix instead. "I'm just a milk chocolate person". Don't use too much caramel or sweetened condensed milk either

Used a sugar-free  cake mix, substituted oil with unsweetened apple sauce,  Omitted toffee bars altogether. Instead, I just drizzled a bit of the caramel topping over the whipped cream (replacing Koolwhip).  It was very moist,   plenty sweet and caramelly. Will make it again.   Thanks for a good recipe! And just loved the name! Hahaha!

Such an easy cake that's so delectable! I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and it turned out perfect: I used the end of a wooden spoon to poke holes. I poured the caramel on first, followed by the sweetened condensed milk. Instead of cool whip I made my own whipping cream. And what really made it over the top was I had a mocha Skor-type candy with espresso bits in it... tasted like a Skor bar with a hint of coffee... even the kids loved it. I'll definitely be making this again!

The recipe is alright by it self, but definitely needs changing. I made a real home made cake (boxed cake would have been way to sweet and fluffy- dence, less sweet cake works better) and used a whole can of the milk. You couldn't taste the half can enough. I didn't crumple the candy bits straight on the warm cake because they kind of melt and get sticky. I put them all on top of the whipped topping. I tried the slit method of getting the milk and caramel in the cake but next time I'll definitely do the wooden spoon method.

I made this using yellow cake mix omitting ingredients to make as a cake and using a 15 oz. can of pure pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling) instead,  along with 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  It makes a very thick batter but not to worry, it will be fine.  Baked at 350 degrees for 28 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes then poke holes all over with end of wooden spoon.  Pour sweetened condensed over top being sure to fill holes.  Top with cool whip, 1/2 bag of Heath candy bits, then drizzle with caramel ice cream sauce.  This is awesome for a holiday dessert!

It was OK, I guess I was expecting more. I didn't taste the caramel at all so I would definitely double that next time as well as the whipped topping. I didn't find the cake to be soggy as others noted. It was too much cake and not enough of anything else. Will probably make again with said changes.

It's better to make this cake a day or two ahead of serving.  Like everyone else, I poked holes into the cake instead of slits to pour the caramel topping in.  Very easy and delicious.

I LOVED this cake! My young children also loved it! I did take the suggestions and only use 1/2 of the called for oil in the cake mix. I also poured the caramel and condensed milk straight on to the cake. I put crushed Heath bars on top of the cake, then added the whipped topping, and then more crushed Heath bars with chocolate syrup and caramel syrup swirls. It is by far my now favorite cake!

Delicious! I followed many of the suggestions that I read: cut the oil in half and dumped a whole can of sweetened condensed milk on top. I did half the milk, followed by the caramel, letting each soak in & then repeated. I will definitely make again.

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of taking a short cut and not heating the milk or caramel topping.  I do think that would have helped it soak into the cake more evenly. Everyone loved it.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday cake.  I used the devil's food cake, I used toothpicks, for the caramel, per reviews, I may want to try something with a bigger diameter, because the cake ended up a lil dry the caramel sat on top or seeped in the corners.  Every bite was delicious.  I used crushed butterfinger and heath bites.

My family has made this cake every holiday for as long as i can remember with the name varying depending on ages of kids that are around at the time of talking about it, "BTS cake" is most common. It is amazing but we do it differently. We use German Chocolate cake and, like a previous reviewer, we poke holes with a wooden spoon all over the cake, that is always a fun job for one of the kids to do with adult supervision. We use a lot more sweetened condensed milk and caramel.  We bake it in a big sheet pan and we use 2 full cans of sweetened condensed milk filling all the holes and then we go over it with an entire bottle of caramel ice cream topping, again putting it in every hole. We cool the cake COMPLETELY in the refrigerator and we also top with cool whip or your favorite whipped topping. We use toffee sometimes, and sometimes we use sundae nuts, depends on whether the kids will be there or not. Best cake ever but soooo rich. The long it sits in the refrigerator the better it gets.

Loved loved loved this recipe!!! I have had this cake in the past at a pot luck at work and it was easily one of the best cakes that I had ever had. I hadn't really thought about it until recently as we have pot lucks quite often at my current job... I thought... why not give this recipe a try. Oh em gee! This cake is fantastic!!! It is so moist and gooey, and the crunch from the candy bar and the whipped topping are just the most perfect additions. Everyone, and I mean EVERONE loved this cake. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!

A M A A A A ZING!!! Wow. INCREDIBLE. :):):):) Instead of using a boxed cake I used the "extreme chocolate cake" recipe on this website. Man, I was impressed. Literally one of the TWO cakes (9x9) are gone - within 24 hours! There's only two of us here !!!! :] If you haven't tried this yet, you are missing out. This is the BEST CAKE I've ever had in my life. I baked both in 9x9 pans, put a second pan under each so the cake wouldn't boil over & it didn't. I let them both cool down for 15 minutes or so, poked holes in them ALMOST to the bottom of the cakes but not quite & I poured 11oz caramel & most of the sweetened milk into the holes then I put the cakes in the fridge. I agree, the cake is best the second day after the caramel has sat. I sprinkled some heath in the holes while the cake was cooling & I just add the cool whip whenever someone wants a slice. No changes are necessary unless your a super picky person about texture - this was very moist & delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe!  My sister made it last Thanksgiving, and she received rave reviews from almost all our family members.  It is rich, moist, and delicious.  The cake mix she used looked lighter than this, so I'm not sure it was devil's food cake.  She refrigerated the dessert overnight which made the flavors meld very well together.  Also, she made this recipe into a trifle with two sets of layers.  It was awesome and looked very pretty in a trifle dish!

Amazing!!! I have very picky eaters in my family and tonight the whole family gathered it was so good I feel like I should have made an extra cake because it was gone within 20 minutes and everyone was asking for more. I did however change a few things from the original recipe. I am not a huge fan of devils food cake so I changed it to tripe chocolate and it was perfect. Also I followed other people's suggestions and cut each cake with little slits ( not all the way to the bottom) and poured the caramel and condensed milk over the cake time it came out of the oven to be honest I was a little nervous bc it didn't seem like it would absorb an not leave the top of the cake soggy but I had nothing to worry about it was perfect. I made this cake into a two layer cake I covered each section in crushed Heath bars and the pecans you find in the ice cream topping  and also chopped them finely and covered all with whipped cream then both layers with a decorative layer of chocolate and Caramel. Only pointer I can give you is if u do a double layer cake it remove your cake from the pans and put on cooling rack then put your slits in it and pour over. I did not think to do this and I had a very hard time getting them out of the pan without breaking them. Once they were out I had no problems with stacking them or serving the cake.

I love this recipe. I also poke holes instead of slits. The holes I think works a lot better. I refrigerate at least an hr b4 serving seems to form the cool whip better.

I learned this recipe from my grandmother. Instead of devil's food cake, I use German chocolate cake. I used the end of a wooden spoon to poke holes (hitting the bottom a couple time). I mix the condensed milk and Carmel together in a bowl at room temperature and pour in holes and all over the cake. I cut up Snickers bars instead of chocolate covered toffee. This cake is always a hit!

My boyfriend LOVES this cake! I am a health food nut so I lightened it up by using KEY FOOD brand Devil's food cake Mix which requires no oil- just water and egg- you can use egg beater's substitute as well. I also swapped out and used Fat Free Sweetened Condensed Milk, Smucker's Caramel sundae topping which has NO fat and Fat free Cool Whip. For convenience I used Heath Toffee bits (baking isle) instead of crushing the candy bars. Simple substitutes making a little less guiltless without losing the decadence!

The cake turned out awesome. Made it for a dinner party & everyone loved it. Instead of cutting slits in cake, I made holes with the end of a wooden spoon & poured Carmel milk sauce into them. Will definitely make this again!

Too sweet? Yes. Read the reviews, definitely better on day two. Use cool whip and not real whipped cream. What did I do differently that helps? Made devils food cake in TWO pans for layers. Also made a small batch of cheese cake, halved the amount of sugar in the cheese cake in a third 9" pan. If you grease well, the cheesecake just pops out. Then "glued" the chilled cheesecake to the devils food cake layers on top and bottom with the caramel mixture. AWESOME! The cheesecake actually helps "un-sweeten" the cake a bit, and adds an extra creamy layer. Without this, it was definitely very sweet, and considering that I am not much of a cake person, this helped amp up the overall product. Used heath crumbles as well. Also used Duncan Hines with an extra egg in the mix to make the cake a little denser to hold together better with the three layers. Gave four stars only because it just needed a little help and wasn't perfect without changes. One review suggested to poke holes in the cake with a wooden spoon for the caramel which actually sounds like a great idea as well.

Once a month I try out new dessert recipes on my co-workers, and this one was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it and most went back for seconds.  I did use more than half a can of condensed milk and more caramel topping.  I also used a whole bag of mini heath bars that I chopped up.  Next when I make this, I may had mini chocolate chips to the cake batter to make it taste more chocolatey.

This recipe was awesome and super simple.  The only things I did differently was poke holes in the cake right when it got out of the oven and I poured the caramel and condensed milk right onto the cake without mixing them together on the stove (why create more dirty dishes?).  Took it to a family reunion, it was the only dessert touched.  Definitely will make again!

I loved it only thing is I had to keep the cake in the freezer to keep the whip cream from melting so it'll stay on the top of the cake. and I did chocolate chunks so I can enjoy the chocolate more than the caramel.

This apparently went over well at the girls night dinner I brought it to.  I don't mind it, but I am not a fan of whipped topping.  I do love condensed milk and caramel..but I am also not a fan of chocolate cake.  I did have about 3 pieces over the past 2 days though..and between 6 people the dish was totally gone in 2 days..haha!
I would make it again for a party because it's easy and looks appealing, but I don't particularly care for half of the ingredients.

Simple and fabulous.  This is always a hit and has become my "signature dessert" that is requested by friends whenever we have dinner parties.
I have done some modifications at times pending my mood and added dizzled hot fudge mixed with the caramel both on the cake and as a topping. I have also substituted the toffee for frozen snickers.  Yummm!  :-)

A girlfriend of mine has made this before and made some variations, so when I decided to make it, I too made a few variations and thought it came out just as good as the recipe sounds.  I omitted the condensed milk, only because it would make it too soggy and too sweet for my taste.  I used instead just the caramel topping.  I "poked" holes in the cake immediately after it was baked using a toothpick; kept the caramel at room temperature and poured it over the cake while it cooled down.  I also added a nut topping of peanuts and pecans on top of the caramel sauce, and then added the whip cream and toffee topping.  Refrigerated it overnight, and enjoyed it the next day!

This is one of my favorite cakes to make. I do not think there is any other chocolate cake out there that I like more. It is so simple, and tasty and leaves everyone wanting more. I make this every year for the family party and then for when we have company coming over.

I made this cake last night after dinner, then, after reading several reviews stating how much better the cake is the day after it is made, I held off on serving it until today. My bf and I were excited to try it. I followed the recipe, and believe it turned out the way it was supposed to, but the cake to us is just kind of missing something?? Oh how I really wanted to love it! It is so simple to make! I found similar recipes that call for a german choc. cake mix instead of the devils food so Im not going to give up! The next time I am in the mood to bake it, I think I may try that. Also. I used Ms. Richard(sons?) Butterscotch Caramel syrup because we already had a jar of it, and several reviewers suggested it. I may try just a plain caramel syrup next time. I love trying new recipes so I don't regret making it.

This is the recipe I have loved for years - just as "naples34102", I use the whole can of condensed milk & the entire jar of Ms. Richardson's butterscotch caramel topping.  Regardless of minute changes, it is hard to mess this up.  My favorite dessert, hands down!

Love this cake!  But I am a baking snob... :-)  I made my own cake.  I actually used a chocolate cake recipe and it turned out fabulous.  I poked holes with the wooden spoon and poured the milk in first and then the caramel.  In the oven as I write this is the same cake but made into cupcake forms.  Going to test how this works with cupcakes!

I love this recipe! I do do it a little differently. I make holes instead of slits. I then pour the condensed milk over the cake first (I do no heat it) and let it soak in. I also use fudge topping in here also, makes it richer!! I then microwave the caramel and fudge topping!! Then I do the whipped cream and heath bars. When I'm feeling daring I sometimes use butterfingers or reeses peanut butter cups instead!

This cake is awesome! I followed most of the recipes, but melted down regular caramels with milk to make caramel sauce. Did not have whipped cream, so topped the cake with Triple Chocolate Chip Frosting and sprinkled crushed Butterfingers on top! It is so so RICH! YUM!

Excellent! Made it exactly as the recipe states. It was even better a day after sitting in the fridge. I loved that the bottom got a bit soggy. The texture and flavor were fantastic. It's not too sweet, which is very surprising. Even my husband liked it and he's not a big sweets/chocolate fan.

The cake was a huge hit! Everybody kept going back for more than two slices. They loved it. Need I say more? I followed the recipe. The only thing I added was some crushed M&Ms on top to add some color and less condensed milk and caramel. Other than that, people just LOVED it. Will have to make this and bring to other parties if I run out of ideas or am in charge of dessert.

My boys love this cake! They don't often request sweets as they are all wrestlers and need to make weight....but this is one they always ask for at the end of the season. Since they don't like heath/toffee I crumble KitKat bars on top....yummmmm

Made this recipe tonight and I could only give it 4 stars. There was something about it that I wasn't crazy about even though I followed the directions exactly.  I can't nail down exactly what it was though!  I'm hoping maybe tomorrow it will be a little "wetter" from the condensed milk and caramel. Overall, pretty good.

DELISH! This cake was easy to make and DELISHIOUS!! I boughta bag of the snack size heath bars. It ws the perfect amount for a 13x9 cake. I hit each bar with the hammer while it was still in its package. then I just opened them all inot a big bowl. It worked GREAT for breaking them up. Also, I bought the LARGE container of Cool Whip. The small on would not of covered the whole cake.

I was hoping to impress but was embarassed to share. I thought it was too sweet, too soggy,and the candy bar topping was too crunchy.  May try again but will use Butterfinger or oreo cookies for topping and less sweetened milk.

When I made this cake for a co-worker who was celebrating his 40th birthday, he told me "THIS IS THE BEST CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD!" - and everyone else in the office loved it as well.  I used all the ingredients listed, and then topped my 13x9 with chocolate covered caramels in a unique design!  Highly recommend!  There is also a white cake version of this which uses pineapple and coconut as the "accessories"!

Oh my gosh! This was soooo yummy. I'm making one for a friend and another as a birthday cake for a co-worker.  I used 2 6oz caramel toppings and 5 candy bars just for the extra goo. Please try this. You won't regret it!

This is a really good cake.I use the Heath bar crumbles you get in your baking isle at the store.Down here we call it Heath Bar Cake.I don't put slits in the cake,cause when you put the carmel on while it's still hot it will seep through the cake.You also won't end up with it all at the bottom of the cake.Please add the cool whip to it.It really compliments the cake well.

In have made this cake many many times. There are a few things i do different. First the Heath bars you can find already crunched up in the baking aisles by the choc chips. I put some of the heath bar in my cake so it cooks with it. I made my holes alittle bigger so it goes in the cake & not on the side.

I didn't have a cake cover so mistakenly used Saran Wrap.  The icing stuck to the plastic wrap even though it was loosly applied which altered the pretty appearance of the cake. Aside from my human error, though, a great tasting cake.  Next time I'll add more chocolate/toffee bars (used three Skor bars this time).

This cake turned out great.  I followed the suggestions of some of the other reiveiwers and it held together well.  I did cut the oil in half and omitted the condensed milk.  As soon as it was out of the oven, I poked holes using a chopstick and poured the caramel topping (at room temp) right on the cake.  Once it was cooled completely, I frosted it with Cool Whip and drizzled chocoalate syrup on top.  Everybody at worked loved it!

I just made this cake again, and instead of using chocolate cake, I used a box of yellow cake mix. Also, because the cake is so rich, I cut down the amount of condensed milk, and caramel to half of what the recipe asks for. Also, I mixed the condensed milk, and caramel together in a saucepan, heated up for two seconds, and drizzled over the top of the cake. Also, this cake really tastes so much better, when it is cold!!

I love this cake! My entire family also loves this cake. I usually poke holes with a wooden spoon, because it allows more caramel to seep through the cake, making it very moist. I personally love the way it tastes when it has been in the fridge overnight. The cake is not too sweet, and not too rich. It is perfect! I love it!

Delicious! 
However, I made a mistake by following suggestions that said to use double the amounts of condensed milk and caramel - it came out too soggy, even after 2 days. Next time, I will just use the amounts the recipe gives.

I love making this cake. My recipe is a little different.  Instead of cutting slits I poke the cake with something about the diameter of a chopstick. The more holes the more gooey stuff gets in! I drizzle caramel ice cream topping, sweetened condensed milk, and butterscotch ice cream topping. The rest is the same. I always love big pieces of the candy bar so I just break them up. It is by far the best chocolate cake. It is super moist and delicious.

This recipe was certainly NOT better than sex. I have had other better than sex cakes that I have loved and was really looking forward to trying this, but this is not one of those cakes. I will keep looking to the actual cake that is better than sex.

Amazing. Don't change anything about the ingredients. But do make sure to make big holes in the cake after it comes out of the oven. I used the end of a plastic serving spoon. This helps all the condensed milk and caramel really get soaked up. Delicious! (Next time I would add salted peanuts for a little crunch)

I used 1c caramel topping (microwave 30 sec), then mixed with 1/4c condensed milk & used whole 8-oz bag toffee bits.  Next time I'll heat the caramel mixture 30 sec (for total of 1 min).  Using 2 8-in pans (1 for me & 1 as a gift), making holes instead of slits.  It was hard to serve the first slice (2nd day), but it was wonderful the day after.  Definitely a make ahead cake.

I learned of a modified version of this cake. I used the box cake mix and poked the holes. I combined the sweetened condensed milk and caramel topping, but didn't cook. I poured over the cake. After it cooked, I spread with half a container of light Cool Whip (since I was making 2 cakes.) On the 2nd cake, I used crushed Butterfinger bars. These cakes were gifts to my daughter's teachers so I didn't get to try any... :-(  But I've had before so I know this is a FABULOUS cake!

I LOVE this recipe: so easy, but tastes SOOO good!!! Not very expensive either. This is now a family favorite, in a family that is not generally fond of cakes. We substitute Butterfinger bars (chopped) for the toffee, and you can't really add too much caramel, so we put in extra. We've also found that it tastes GREAT the 2nd day, after the cake has had a chance to "marinate" in the caramel sauce!!

I have lots of requests for this cake and make it often.  The only thing that I do different is that I have not been able to find Heath bars around here but I did find "Heath Bits-o-Brickle" in a bag on the aisle with chocolate chips so this is what I use.

Another option is to use crushed up butterfinger candy bars in place of the toffee bits - YUM! YUM!

I made this cake a loooong time ago when I saw Paula Deen make the recipe.  I can't remember if I used caramel sauce or chocolate syrup, I'm thinking chocolate syrup.  But I know either way is "better than sex".  

This cake is sooo good, and so simple.  I recommend it to any chocolate lover.  5 stars!

This cake was very good and my book club girls gobbled it up. But, take caution as it is very very sweet! I followed other reviewers and put on all the condensed milk and the whole jar of carmel. Unlike everyone else though I found this to give it too much of a carmel taste...I couldn't really taste the chocolate. I did however spread out a whole bag of Heath Toffee chips on the top while the cake was still really warm and it melted and then cooled to a great "crust". Whipped up some real whipping cream and garnished with that and a rolo candy before serving. This is a very good recipe but I do think next time I will cut back on the carmel a bit. And maybe try a different candy like reeses peanut butter cups!

3.5 stars for me. No food is ever better then sex (lol), but.......while this was good, it was too sweet. So the recipe is a 4, but personal preference on taste is a 3, hence the 3.5

This was alright, but it didn't turn out as ooey-gooey as I expected. I think that the cake mix was too fluffy to have the desired effect. I might try it again using more sweetened condensed milk and a brownie mix or cake from scratch. 
Tres Leches cake is a delicious alternative. That would also be good with carmel and toffee!

I've been making this cake for almost 10 years, and there are rarely leftovers. I hadn't made it in quite a while but decided to make it for this weekend. However, I knew I was forgetting one ingredient so I looked on allrecipes. You can find anything here! Anyway, I've never mixed or warmed the condensed milk and caramel. When the cake is still warm I poke holes using the handle of a wooden spoon and I pour the milk over top. After the milk soaks in I pour a whole jar of Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch caramel topping over top. I then put it in the fridge overnight and top it with the cool whip and toffee bits (found in the baking aisle by the chocolate chips) just before serving. I also toss a few mini chocolate chips on top if I have them. Amazing cake!

Everyone loved this cake!  Even I, not a huge chocolate lover, devoured it.  

Instead of crushing up heath bars, I just used a mix of Heath toffee bits (in choc. chip section) and mini chocolate chips.  So great!

Made this for an office party-very easy. Make sure you put it together the night before so it gets extra moist. It was gone in minutes and everyone wants the recipe.

My friend made a cake like this and the first thing I said was, "this is better than sex....and I went for seconds!" What she did though to make it moist was bake for 15min and then pour the condensed milk on it and some caramel. Then she finished baking it. After that, she added the whipped topping, caramel, and toffee bar pieces! I still rave about it.

This has become a family favorite, my mom started making this a few years ago when I was still in high school. After I moved out I had to find the recipe. It's just as decadent and tempting as I remember it.

For my birthday, my boyfriend asked my roommates what my favorite cake was so he could make it for me, and they told him, "Better than Sex Cake." I was so embarassed! Now we've been married for over a year, and it's still my favorite cake, and he still makes it for my birthday every year. You simply have to try it!!!

I made this for my brother to take to his bachelor party.  Unimpressed.  I used a moist cake mix which was good, but the whole thing really didn't WOW me.  This cake is far from being as good as sex.  I can think of a whole lot of other deserts that would be closer to its name sake.  Sorry, not going to make this again.

Awesome cake!  It's always requested by the family.  I just made one to share with my office.  I use the entire can of condensed milk and two whipped cream toppings on a 9x13 sized pan.  Goes further.

I used Rainbow bit cake mix, and instead of crushing skor bars I bought the skor bites and put them in my blender for a few seconds to crush them. Brought it to a church dinner and was a great hit!

This was OK.  I have had this cake b4 made by my aunt.  She uses a whole jar of carmel sauce, now i realize i should have too.  We like the cake to get good and gooey.  Half of the jar just doesnt do it.  Heck, if you like gooey chocolatey cake, use all the caramel and all the SCMilk.

I made this for a group of friends and it was a big hit if you can go by the noises they were making while eating it!  Like previous reviews, I used the end of a wooden spoon and poked holes in the cake and served it still warm from the oven.

If you are looking for "sweet," this is IT! Made it several times for get togethers and the room ALWAYS sounds like an orgy with all the "oohs, ummms and ahhs." Don't usually change a thing, make it exactly like it is - have switched up the cake mix to swiss chocolate or whatever I have on hand.

This was the best. A friend of mine from work prepared it and tried to give me the recipe, i failed miserably. It was too sweet and gooey. But then I made my own adjustments and it was very good. I used Swiss chocolate cake mix which is similar to german choc. cake but had a good taste not as sweet. Secondly, I did use the condensed milk by poking holes in it by holding three toothpicks together (I didn't have what was suggested in the recipe). I did not use it all. I eyeballed it, when the cake looked moist, I added a bit more then stopped. (I let it sit after I added about half of the milk to let it absorb. Then I eyeballed the caramel and drizzled as much as I thought we could stand. I didn't use nearly all of it, this could be why some cakes were too sweet. Then I let it chill in the freezer for about an hour (it could go into the fridge for two hours instead). I then added store bought cream cheese frosting but next time I will make my own. Lastly, I topped it pecans and frozen chopped Snickers pieces (as much as you like). It was gone in just over 24 hours after I made it.

Tried this recipe while I was in Savannah, GA for a scout Blue and Gold dinner.  People were asking for the recipe and it was the first dessert to disappear.

I doubled the recipe for my son's birthday party.  I used dulce du leche topping.
Despite the fact that the party was small, this cake was completely devoured!  It is excellent!  I'm making it again this year.

Delicious!  Next time I might just omit the milk and use all caramel and see how it tastes.  I bought the Heath toffee chips from the baking aisle to save time.  Thanks!

This is really eassy and also VERY good!
I wish I could think of a better way to top it than cool whip even though I SMOTHERED it in the xtra caramel and heath bar bits, it seemed a tad bland for me. Still a great cake though!!

It was really good, but I don't think it's better than sex. I have had better recipes though, so I can't give it a 5. It was really good and probably gave me cavities.

This is the absolute best cake.  Oh my goodness!  Yum!  I make it EXACTLY as written and it's perfect.  The only change I have ever made was to use a butterscotch/caramel ice cream topping and that is what I'll use again.

I have stopped counting how many coworkers have asked me for this recipe. I was so nervous making this for a party for my boss (especially the name) It obviously was a hit. I did also take ALOT of time reading prior reviews and followed the reduced oil and spoon hole suggestions.

I am not a big cake person, and I thought this cake was great!  My 3 year old kept saying "Mmmm" while she was chewing!  Like other reviewers, I used less oil than was called for in the cake, and I poked holes all over the cake rather than slicing it.  I did use the condensed milk/caramel mixture, and I did not find the cake too moist or soggy at all.  In place of the Heath bars, I used 3 Snickers bars chopped up (my grocery store didn't have any Heath's!!)  Next time I make this I will definitely use toffee chips, because I think that would make the cake even better.  I didn't put the whipped topping on top of the cake because I didn't want it to melt (we weren't going to eat the whole cake in one sitting) so I just served it with vanilla ice cream instead.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!

This cake is easy to make and delicious. After reading other reviews, I decided to omit the milk and instead doubled the caramel sauce. I don't know that the caramel adds that much to the cake as far as flavor and I might use fudge sauce or some other kind of sauce next time I make it. I used a regular chocolate cake mix instead of angel food. Very moist and tasty.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I substituted Twix bars for the toffee because of my allergies.  This cake sounded a lot better than it really is - it wasn't what I expected.  Way too sweet and it just wasn't that good.  Will not bake again.

Absolutely wonderful.  I'm not a fan of chocolate cake. I made this for my boyfriend, not thinking I would enjoy it myself.  This cake may convert me to the chocolate cake lover side. I will make this again.

Well I made this cake for my mother and grandmothers boyfriend and it went over very well.  I too used chopsticks for making the whole in the cake.  I also cut the oil in half, which made the cake a little less moist, which my family, but I have to admit this wasn't better than sex! hehe

I made this for my cuz 30th bday. Every1 loved it, espcially her. I found it to be very sweet(which is usally not a prob for me) I brought my piece to work and they loved it too. I poked straw holes in it and I found the sauce makes the cake very moist. I probably won't bake again, if i do I won't include the candy. My cuz wants recipe, though. To each his own :)

This was a very good and very sweet cake.  I used chopstix for the holes. The only thing I didn't care for was the caramel made the cake a bit soggy, and the whipped cream melted within 10 min of serving, so it looked messy.  The best part was the candy bar on top.  All in all pretty good cake not sure if I will make again.

This was very good! I used the handle end of a wooden spoon to make the holes. I think next time I would try a thicker "icing" than the cool whip...maybe whip it together with some cream cheese?? great recipe though...was definitely a hit!

This was a very SWEET cake. We all enjoyed. I did not put slices in the cake, I used the end of a chopstick and poked holes into the cake. It was alot faster and easier. If you are in the mood for a sweet cake, this is it.

I made this cake for my husband who has the most extreme sweet tooth.  He absolutely fell in love with this and has made his friends come over to try this on several different occasions.  It was an absolute hit and needless to say the kids had chocolate smiles for the night!

I made this cake the night before, and brought it to work. A great hit. I wouldn't call it better than sex, but some people did. I guess I'm lucky,ha ha! But a big pleaser. I would cut down on the condensed milk. A little to much. But I will make it again.

Who--ee! this is a doosey!
My personal tips for this cake: You can also use German Choc. Cake Mix.  Instead of slits, poke holes in the cake with the end of a wooden spoon, one hole per inch or so (to taste).  Can substitute fudge or butterscotch topping for caramel.  This cake is great if it sits for an hour or so in the fridge before you top it with whipped cream!  Run a knife around the edges before serving.  Can also be made as a layer cake with whipped topping in the middle.  In fact, there's almost no way to mess this cake up... ;-)
My www.xanga.com/hahruby readers:  Enjoy!

YUM!  This cake was great.  Very rich. I did what some of the other users suggested and bought heath bar bits in the baking section, but I think next time I will actually buy the candy bar and chop it up into chunks.  The bits didn't have chocolate on them and they were too small.  I think the real thing is the best way to go!  Also, I will make this again and try using different candy bars like snickers or caramellos.  Definitely a keeper and a hit at parties!

Wow... talk about good!!  I think the name is slightly misleading (haha) but this cake was awesome.  Everyone enjoyed it, and were very vocal in their appreciation.  I couldn't find the toffee pieces @ Winn Dixie (found them at Walmart, of course) so I used Butterfinger.  I think it will be much better with toffee... but other then those slight snags, WONDERFUL cake!!  Very, very yummy!!  ~Gina

sry - my family did not care for this cake. With 2 teens, cakes usually lasts about an hour.  I actually had to throw some of this one away.  Both kids said it was too rich and just too much chocolate.  I had to agree.

Made this for a family dinner and it disappeared in no time flat.  Only thing I changed was I whipped up 35% cream instead of using the frozen whipped topping.  Will definitely make this again.  Decadent and easy!

I made this cake for a party. And making it two days prior,letting it all the ingredients combine is just amazing. Everybody, even "no thanks, I'm not hungry" people had a full slice after one bite. E did alter the recipe a big by instead of caramel syrup I used Heath brand toffee ice cream syrup and sprinkled Twix chunks on top. Then I used the french vanilla flavored cool whip for the topping. Very addicting and very delicious! One of my favorite cakes I've ever had.

This was a wonderful cake.  I make it for work and everyone loved it.  However, the caramel did not sink into the cake.  Next time I may put holes in with a straw like someone had suggested previously.

I always make birthday cakes for friends and co-workers. I USUALLY make the cakes from scratch, and like to experiment with different recipes. But I saw this well rated treat, was feeling "lazy" and had to try it. I am ashamed to admit that the birthday gal said that I had "outdone myself" with this very easy from the box cake. I must confess: I lied and told everyone it was from scratch. Sorry Betty! (Crocker, that is!)

deeee-licious!  I'm allergice to toffee, so I used crushed butterfingers and the result was amazing.  Plan to make only enough to serve everyone--this stuff's so rich, few people can eat more than one piece, although it keeps fairly well for a few days.  I made a lot of friends taking our leftover cake around a guys' dorm and offering pieces to strangers ;)

make this cake!! i don't usually like chocolate cake but everyone who tried it said it was the best cake they had ever had.  i used 6 or 7 heath bars and i found that the more i used the better it turned out.  it definately is better when it has been in the fridge for awhile, so i would reccommend making it a day or two before serving it. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!!

I had the original cake awhile back and thought it was too soggy. So I make some adjustments and this time it was wonderful. I only had a 9x9 pan so I used 1/4 cup of the milk and 3/4 cup of the caramel. I also used toffee baking chips instead of candy bar and it came out really great. Not to sweet, you can taste the chocolate cake, and not too soggy!

I made this for a carmel-lover's birthday party.  She loved it and so did everyone else at the party.  To make it even simpler (is that possible?!), I used Skor bits instead of Skor bars chopped up.  Also, after putting the Cool Whip on the top, I just grated chocolate chips over the top (using a hand-held cheese grater) and drizzled more of the carmel topping over the top.  SUPER EASY TO MAKE!  And the best part is no one realizes because it looks fantastic!

I baked the cake mix in muffin cups, cut them in half, followed all the directions pertaining to the caramel and toffee toppings, and made small individual portions served in dessert dishes, topped with coolwhip.  They turned out great!

I used triple chocolate fudge cake mix and french vanilla whipped topping. These made it so much better!! I also swirled caramel on top of the whipped topping.

This cake is too bitter for me.  Next time I think I'll try crushed butterfinger instead of heath bars.   My husband gives it three stars, he says it's good but nothing special.. my three year old son screamed I LOVE IT over and over...

I LOVE This cake. It is AWESOME! It is also the cake that all my friends ask for all the time(male and female). I add a little whiskey and a little hot fudge to it along with the candy. I just don't do as much candy.  It is a great recipe. Make it a thousand times over. Trust me. You will LOVE it too.

The cake was very moist, and the topping delicious. My only suggestion is to put enough slits around the entire cake that when you cut a piece to serve, each person recieves a slice that is 'dripping' with caramel.

It is very sweet so beware, but I love it. I added extra Heath bars and I think it could have used more still. It got better over time and when it was cold.

What a wonderful cake. I have had some of the variations before but this is by far my favorite. It is super moist and is even better the second day. I would highly recommend any chocolate lover to make this recipe.

This is very good.  I ended up using a German chocolate cake mix, which had a modified version of this recipe on the box.  I followed its directions instead, which included the whole can of sweetened condensed milk and the whole jar of caramel topping.  In my opinion, the cake ended up too soggy and sweet, but a few people who ate it said it was one of the best cakes they had ever eaten.  I'll follow this recipe instead of the one on the box next time.

So, I decided to make the Better Than Sex 2 cake with the Dark Chocolate Cake 1 as the base.  I wrote down all of the ingredients on a shopping list but lost internet access before I could get the directions.  I also ran out of flour, so I used a little less.  I used milk instead of water.  I make the dark choc cake in two layers.  Unfortunately, I didnt know how to make the better than sex cake topping.  I ended up putting the condensced milk, caramel, whipped topping and half of the toffee candy on the stove and then drizzled it on each layer with some more of the toffee candy sprinkled on top.  The cake ended up very, very rich.  My boyfriend loved it!

I don't like the name, but we loved the cake!!  It is easy and delicious.  I chopped a fourth bar and folded some into the Cool Whip and sprinkled some on top.  The first time I made it, it was an accident - had two recipes printed out and sitting on the counter and looked at this one when I was intending to make the other.  Good mistake!!!  Definitely a keeper!

I really thought this was going to be an amazing cake and while it was good, it wasn't any better than most other cakes I've eaten.  It does stay really moist, though and the whipped topping is a nice change from a thick, heavy frosting.

I loved this cake. I'll definitely make this again. I didn't add more candy bar pieces and caramel after topping the cake with whipped topping. I thought it was sweet enough as it is.

I made this for my husband's birthday. He doesn't like frosting. This doesn't have frosting, but it has all sorts of other yummy, sugary stuff. If you are looking for sweet, you have found it.

This cake melts in your mouth! I have made it so many times I've lost count! To make even more appealing and satisfying, use a homemade chocolate cake recipe baked in two round cake pans. You will need extra whipped cream.

This is a family favorite. So easy and so yummy!  Kids really love this.  The recipe I have calls for chocolate ice cream topping too (extra chocolate, how can you go wrong?).  I highly recommend this recipe.
Thanks for sharing!

Oh, this was so moist and delicious! I made a mistake and used the entire can of condensed milk but no one could tell. Just made it super moist but NOT soggy at all. Everyone loved it. I made it a second time, hoping to give some to my mother and sister, but my husband wouldn't let me. I have to make another one for them. (P.S. Husband does not agree with the name of the recipe, however!)

I usually test a recipe before making it for a crowd, but since this makes so many servings I didn't want to test it with just my husband and I.  I decided to make the cake for Thanksgiving for a crowd of chocolate enthusiasts and everyone loved it.  I have never had so many people go so crazy over one of my desserts.  It was a real treat for everyone.  And the name of the cake provided fuel for many good jokes as well!

I thought this cake was alright, maybe I had high expectations.  Everyone still enjoyed this.  If I make it again, I will probably add more toffee.

I had pretty high hopes for this cake, having made similar ones in the past.  It tasted fine, but not very sweet.  I probably won't make it again.

This cake is delicious! I wanted to make a chocolate cake and a white cake for my daughter's 2nd birthday party. Everyone loved it! I was asked many times if I made the cake myself. My Grandma was shocked! I try to only cook things that look simple since I'm a novice at baking or cooking. This was exteremly easy, and since it's better if prepared the night before it gave me extra time to get things ready for the party the next morning. My fiance ate 3 pieces!!

I thought that this was a very yummy cake. I am not a big chocolate fan, but my husband is, so the toffee was a nice enhancement. I used real whipping cream, because cool whip is just gross! I think next time I will add toffee chunks to the batter and bake as well as sprinkle on top.

This cake was good and very chocolatey. Small slices go a long way with this one.

This cake looked great on paper, but it didn't turn out the way I had hoped.  Maybe it was the brand of caramel I used, or maybe I did something wrong, but it was not even close to being better than sex!  (Maybe mediocre sex)
I'd go with another recipe.

I had another recipe called Better than Sex Cake but this one is even better. I made it for my boyfriend and sent the leftovers home with him and everyone at his house raved about it. Very rich and sure to satisfy choco-holics completely.

I recently made this cake for Thanksgiving with my family. I had such  hard time making everyone believe that I made this cake. Out of all the desserts made mine was the only one touched and it was gone in minutes. It was so easy to make and I promised to make it on all the future family gatherings.....

A great recipe, everyone loved it.  My son ate two pieces before I was even ready to serve it.  I used chocolate fudge cake mix and next time I think I'll use the entire jar of caramel and sweetened condensed milk instead of half as indicated in the recipe.  I'm happy to have this simple yet delicious recipe.

Gooey gooey cake!  I made this for my mom's work - they've requested it four more times so far! Really easy.  I decreased the amt. of condensed milk to about 3-4 oz, making the caramel a little thicker.  If you like rich, sweet, and crunchy caramel, this it it.

I made this cake for a dinner party last night and received a standing ovation.  I was told throughout the evening what a moist, rich, delicious dessert this was.  I did use a Betty Crocker Chocolate Fudge cake mix with pudding in the mix instead of the Devils Food Cake Mix.  Outstanding!  Natalie Machado

I made this cake for my boyfriend with a minor variation.  Instead of whipped topping, I used Starbucks 'Mocha Java Chip' ice cream to spread on the cake.  It was soooooo good!  Everything about the cake was great...it was moist, rich and it was a challenge for us to try and NOT have seconds!!!  The only thing I would do differently the next time is use a little more caramel than the recipe called for.

Excellent.  I've made this twice for my college friends.  They liked it a lot both times.  Unfortunately, the second time I made it I had no sweetened condensed milk on hand, so I used pure caramel sauce.  That made it quite gooey and extraordinarily sweet, but everyone seemed to like it even more than the first time!

I have made this cake several times now.  Most of them for the people from church, so it's a bit embarassing to tell them the name when they ask...so we've code named it BTS cake!  It's a great cake!!  I have had MANY compliments and requests for the recipe.

Simple - no trick stuff here, suspiciously easy
Good - none was left to take home
Conversational - with a name like that, there's no silence during desert, though everyone is curious what "Better Than Sex Cake 1" was like

I once made a Better Than Sex Cake recipe quite like this one.  The only difference was that I used a German chocolate cake mix and Heath Candy chunks.  Poke holes instead of slits for more absorbsion.  VERY VERY YUMMY!!!

Hello everyone!  This cake is great!  I substituted coffee ice cream for the whipped topping and everyone loved it.  The only thing with ice cream is that it takes FOREVER for it to "re-freeze!!"  The cake disappeared in less than 20 minutes!

VERY RICH!  Almost too rich for me to eat, although my husband ate 2 pieces for dessert.  I think next time I will skip the whipped topping.  I think that's what put it over the top for me.  Very easy to make!

So easy, and oh so good!  The cake is a tiny bit dry, I will try using a pudding cake mix next time.  Maybe just adding additional oil to the cake mix would help.  Overall, it is a keeper!!

It was good, NOT the best cake but no one at the party complained. I really didn't like the bits of hard toffee.

Everyone who tried it loved it and I would make it again even though it was not as decadent as I expected. It's a good cake but not as good as it's title! Next time I might try adding Kahlua or Frangelica liqeur for a little different flavor.

Naaahhhh!!  No way.....a little too dry.  I think it would have been much better made with a "pudding added" cake mix, or a butter cake mix instead of the devils food.

I made this for a Christmas party, and I don't know which was a bigger hit - the cake or its name!  We spent a lot of time discussing whether the name was correct, and many seemed to feel it was!!! It's a great cake!

This was definitely a good cake, but just took a bit longer than most cakes.  Also, if in the recipe, they could say the exact kind of candy bar and type of whipped cream, it would be helpful.  As one who does not cook much, I wasn't sure of what to buy.

If it is not better than it's namesake, it's a close second. This is a hit wherever I bring it. I can not keep it in the fridge. I make it at least once a week either for home or to give away. Everyone gets a kick out of the name wheb I tell them.

Simply wonderful!!! My mom always made the one with yellow cake and pinapple, but I love chocolate and had to try it...Check out my new version in the recipe list, I sort of combined the two, and I thought this one was really fabulous!!!!

Though this is a chocolate cake, it also makes a great summer cake to entertain with or take to parties!  I've already shared the recipe with about 10 people!!

Everyone loves this cake!  It's easy and good.  Fattening, but worth every ounce.
