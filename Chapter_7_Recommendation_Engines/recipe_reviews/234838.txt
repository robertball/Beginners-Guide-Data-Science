Had a wonderful flavor but it was too thin. I could not get it to thicken.

Take that Jello! I have searched for years for an egg custard recipe that tastes like Jello's Americana egg custard. This is best one so far.

Since this recipe has such a low ratio of eggs to milk, the custard really doesn't set as a solid.  It combines with fruit & jams really well.

This is similar to an old recipe my Mother used to make.  I adjusted the recipe somewhat to smaller portion.  Instead of a gallon of milk, I used a quart.  If you like the real old fashioned "egg" custard, the ratio of eggs to milk should be about 1 egg to 1 cup of milk.  I also like more nutmeg so more than a pinch was added.

This recipe did not work at all for me.  I feel like a step or some instruction of some sort was missing.  It never thickened for me.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have searched for years for an egg custard recipe that tastes just like Jello brand Americana egg custard. This is it!  I did add 1 egg yolk to the recipe for 4 servings and cooked it longer.

I was hoping for the best with this recipe but it isn't as I hoped. I was expecting it to be thin because of the lack of eggs per the amount of milk but it really didn't turn out very good.  However, if you aren't into 'egg' custard this would probably work for you.

I had a gallon of expired milk, so I decided to use it to make this custard. I could not get it to set either.  I cooked it for a long time. It didn't work. I did find the almost exact recipe, only adding a dash of salt, and 2 quarts of milk instead of a gallon. I will try that one next.

This was the first time I've ever made custard and it came out beautifully. I'm still looking for the perfect recipe to taste like the pie from my favorite bakery. This came very close, but I'm going to keep looking and keep it filed!

This was such a great recipe. It may have taken a while, but it it was a recipe worth cooking.
