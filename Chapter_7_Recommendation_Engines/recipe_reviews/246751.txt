The roasted bok choy tossed in this marinade was perfect and I would happily make that part again, but for us the fish needed some acid and brightness.  Something like rice wine vinegar instead of the mirin and for us it also wanted a bit of heat so we ended up drizzling the fish with some leftover chili mayo.

Didn't have salmon, subbed swordfish. Tasty and so easy.
