The key to success in this one is to use quality beef and quality cheese.  I will use better beef next time. With that being said, this is good. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the onion overpowered. I recommend cutting back on the onion.  I like onion a lot but it should never compete with beef.

I opted for mayo on the bottom buns and kept the horseradish as a side condiment.  Paired with a pineapple coleslaw, it made a simple but filling dinner.  These mini sandwiches would also make a fabulous party food!

Really good and easy sandwiches. The glaze makes them extra tasty. I cut up a block of Swiss cheese, so my sandwiches were extra cheesy.

Huge hit with the family!  I didn't have Hawaiian rolls, but dinner rolls worked great as well!  Great weeknight meal!

These were delicious!  I would use a tad bit less of brown sugar next time. I only made a half batch as there are only a couple of us to eat them but they went over well and I will certainly make them again.

This was a great recipe!  It was easy and I mostly excited because I happened to have everything without shopping.  Guests loved it!  I did brown the beef quickly in a pan before putting it together.  I was not sure it would cook enough because my roast beef was quite rare.  Delicious!

I enjoyed making them because they are quick, easy and very tasty.  My granddaughter loved them too and has asked for them for her Halloween party.
