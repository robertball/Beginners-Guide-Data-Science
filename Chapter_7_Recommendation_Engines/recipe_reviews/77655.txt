These cookies have a great flavor!  I don't recommend rolling out one dough ball and cutting it in half.. trying to roll it up was a pain since the dough seemed too small for the amount of filling to go inside.  The dough on the outside edge of the roll didn't stick to itself so as they baked, the cookies opened up and the filling leaked out and burnt.  Next time, I will divide the dough into 2 or 3 balls, but definately leave 1" of dough without filling on it to make sure the dough sticks to the rest of the roll and we don't lose any goodies.

I followed the recipe except i made 3 balls instead of 4. I want to try dates and other fruits in the future. I also rolled the log in nuts before cutting it.  When removed from the oven I placed a dark chocolate kiss on the top.  I received many compliments at the cookie exchange especially because of the low sogar content.
