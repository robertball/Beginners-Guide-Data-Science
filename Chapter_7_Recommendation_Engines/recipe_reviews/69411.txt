I modified this recipe to be made with pork tenderloin, instead of pork chops, and it was SO good. I butterflied and then pounded the tenderloin until it was a rectangle. Then, sprinkled salt, pepper, and a little sage on the inside in addition to the other fillings. Rolled it up and secured with kitchen twine. Rubbed the outside with olive oil, salt and pepper, and roasted at 400* for about 20 minutes. Delicious.

Ok, so i use this website almost everyday, but i've never felt compelled to write a review...that is until i made this recipe!!!  Sooooo fantastic!  Now i tweaked it a bit.  i used thick boneless centercuts instead of chops.  Gruyere instead of gouda and added diced, skinless apple to the mix.  i seasoned the chops with a little salt, pepper, and spicy mustard.  Heated up an indoor grill and seared them for 7 minutes each side, then broiled them for 3 minutes after topping them with the remaining filling. My boyfriend went crazy over them!!!

I made this in a saute pan instead of on the grill. I used boneless chops as well. 5 minutes per side would have been great. I found that with the cheese and bacon no additional salt was required. Only 1 ounce of cheese was needed. This is delishious. I made a quick pan sauce by deglazing with a bit of left-over champagne, cream and a touch of butter. Yummy.

I'd give TEN STARS if I could! My husband likes smoked Gouda, we tried this  as per the directions. SO EASY to make, SO SIMPLE and yet it TASTE GOURMET!!! Can PLEASE AND IMPRESS anyone you cook it for. Easy to grill! I bet you could switch whichever cheese you prefer and it would still be great! Why did I have to dig for this recipe, this should be the very first one that comes up when you ask for PORK CHOP RECIPES!! YEAH, THIS IS THE BEST!

I added about a quarter of  a chopped apple to  the rest of the ingredients, and really jammed the filling into two very large  boneless chops. ( 2 1/2 ") I secured the chops with a metal pick. I dusted with flour and browned them in the bacon grease, about 3 minutes each side.  Then I put them in the oven , seam side UP and baked about  20  minutes at 350.  I watched them closely.  My chops were very cold when I  put them in the oven.  One chop was enough for the two of us.   The second time I made them, I browned them in a little Olive Oil and then grilled them.  I didn't add apple. I think I liked them grilled a little better, but both  times  5 stars. Both times,  very, very good.  It is an easy recipe. I used good quality smoked Gouda.  Don't substitute the cheese, that is what makes them so good. You can make them ahead of time, refrigerate and  bake later.  A great company dish.

This was SUCH a hit!  We are a part of a monthly dinner club with three other couples and we were responsible for the main dish this last month.  I made these and thought my husband was going to drool all over his plate!  It was too cold to grill so I made some modifications...I used very thick/large boneless pork loins and I pan seared them about 3-4 min per side and then baked them at 350 for about 20/25 minutes.  They were great!  However, I could have used some sort of gravy over the top or maybe some melted cheese - my husband liked them the way they were.

FANTASTIC! I didn't use chops as big as asked for but bought the thick cut chops from the store and had the butchermake the pocket for me. I cooked my bacon crisp and did 6 slices instead of 4. I used a bit more cheese to but other then that did everything as stated. My butcher suggested i use cooking twine and lace it over the tooth picks that i used to seal the slit, i did and it worked out great. I didn't loose any of the goodies from inside the stuffed pocket. Thanks for a great recipe!!

These were the best pork chops I have ever eaten. They were so easy, but elegant! I've made them twice. The first time I grilled them, and the second time I broiled them. I like the grilled way better because of the extra flavor I get from the grill. I was concerned about them not getting done or drying out, but they were cooked to perfection. This is one recipe that I will make until death do us part!!

I make this all the time for company and it is always a crowd pleaser.  I usually use brie, just because I like it better!
Then I make my husband take it out and grill it!Fresh thyme is a great addition.

These are amazing! - I cooked bacon in cast iron, drained grease and then seared the pork chops in the skillet to get browned, then into the oven - great!

Imagine my annoyance with myself when I discovered I had once again failed to read the recipe through, thus never realizing these chops were to be grilled. In this case, thankfully, it wasn’t a huge problem, as I was easily able to bake them in a 375 degree oven, but it underscores the point that one should always carefully read through a recipe before beginning to prepare it!  The “guts” of these chops, as Hubs so eloquently described it, is particularly tasty, even tho’ the cheese mostly oozed out, as I expected it would.  What it left behind, however, was great flavor!  The amount of parsley seemed like overload, but rather than simply reducing it, I mixed in some chopped baby arugula (spinach would have been a fine choice too) – and it was a beautiful and delicious fit!  If I was to make these again, I think I would add some fresh minced garlic to the stuffing, even tho’ it was fine as is.  I served this with baked potatoes and acorn squash, all in the oven together at 375 degrees!  What an easy dinner!

I recently bought a jar of blueberry jalapeno preserves & chose this recipe to use it on so of course I switched things up a bit. I used 1 & 1/2" chops, I sliced my gouda into very thin slices & then stuffed each chop w/ one tiny slice of cheese ( I only used a  total of two oz on 4 chops), about a tbp of real bacon bits (they're leaner & easier than frying it up) & sprinkled each chop w/ fresh ground pepper. I made a sauce out of the blueberry jalapeno preserves by adding a tbp of white wine vinegar & some garlic powder & nuking it for 30 seconds to liquefy it some. We all thought the sauce made the recipe! Without it, the chops were semi-bland. We served this w/ grilled zuchinni & asparagus, sauteed squash, Rainbow Melon Julep (from allrecipes) & Blueberry Jalapeno Mojitos...wonderful patio dinner....thanks!

Very good with some little changes. I started by chopping 1/4 C. red onion and 2 T. garlic then saute in a skillet with a tab of butter.  As soon as the garlic turned slightly brown I scooped out the onion and garlic to reserve.  I then cooked HICKORY SMOKED BACON (1/2 lb.) in the same skillet and then saved the liquid.
 I added the cooked bacon, garlic and onion mix to the chopped parsley but added about 1/8C. chopped fresh basil, 2 tsp. sage and 2 tsp. of ground cayenne pepper.  I increased the gouda to 6 ounces since I was needing to make 4 pork chops.  I omitted the salt as it doesn't need it with the bacon and cheese.  
Also, I cooked the pork chops on a prepared cedar plank on the grill.  YUMMY!  Talk about adding some woodsy and smoked flavors!!

For a sauce, I heated up the skillet with the reserve juices and added about 1/4 C. of Chardonnay to deglaze.  After it bubbled slightly I cooled it down a bit added a tab of butter and 1/4 C. of heavy cream then poured it over the cooked pork chops.  It was a huge hit with my teenager, my 10 year old and my 6 year old.  I think my husband liked it...all he kept saying was mmmm....mmmmmm....mmmmmm!!

While I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I feel it was similar enough to rate!  I followed another reviewer's suggestions and butterflied & pounded thin a 1 lb. pork tenderloin, and then I also added sauteed onions,  mushrooms, and spinach to the mixture.  Rolled up and secured with toothpicks, and then browned in a plan before putting it in the oven at 375 for about 20-25 min.  As written, this recipe is a 4, but with these additional flavors, it is 5!  We loved the Gouda in it.  My fiancee loved it, and we're making it again this week for company.  Thanks!

I had a pork tenderloin in the fridge begging to be turned into something delicious and that's exactly what happened using this recipe.  Normally I don't care for pork and cheese together, but this was quite good.  Good mix of flavors, easy to prepare and using the grill outside kept the house from feeling like a furnace! Thank you Darla for an interesting mix of flavors!

WOW!  These chops were simply delish!  So much richness from the smoked gouda cheese and bacon together.  I mixed up the mixture of cheese, bacon, and parsley in a bowl and I couldnt keep my fingers out of it from eating the combo by itself!  SO GOOD!  I didnt have thick pork chops.  Just thin ones.  I sauteed them in my skillet with the bacon grease and a little butter, just enough to give them a nice brown.  I put them in a casserole dish and just topped them heavily with the cheese/bacon mixture and baked them in the oven at 350 for 15 min.  I did double the cheese and bacon as well.  I made a light coating of sauce with the pan drippings using butter, white wine, and cream.  Next time I will make a little more of the sauce to go with them.  These are sinfully rich, so for side dishes I would serve something a little lighter.  I served mine with the Smoke Cheese Ravioli recipe on the site, since it uses smoked gouda as well, and it was just too heavy along with the chops being so rich.  Great way to spruce up some boring chops that you may have sitting in the freeze.  Thanks for the recipe, I will make again!

After reading many of the reviews, I made this last night.  It is a keeper.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly. However, I did not grill...I browned in the "bacon pan" for just a few minutes, then transferred to a glass pyrex with water in the bottom, baked 350 covered for about 12 minutes, 350 uncovered for another 12 minutes. They were PERFECT. My chops were only a little over an inch thick. Note on the smoked gouda (versus regular gouda)...I had to get the smoked version from the deli counter; it was not prepackaged. Next time I will add apple.

Absolutely fantastic.  I couldn't believe that I wasn't at a 5 star restaurant while eating these.  I would serve these to guests, or a date that you are trying to impress.  :-)
I didn't change a thing.  I did make a white gravy with the bacon drippings.  I made it with a little milk, apple juice and chicken stock.  I added dried basil, dried parsley, minced dried onion, salt, pepper and some diced green apple.  It was delish, but the pork was great all by it's self.

My 100th review and my 3 year anniversary as a member of allrecipes!  So my husband and I give this dish a 4.5 star rating, it was very very good.  I made it exactly as stated except I used boneless chops, which I am glad I did.  I was tempted to pan sear them, but I'm glad I followed the recipe and grilled them because it gave the chops great flavor, and they stayed moist and juicy! I had thick chops, I ended up grilling them about 8 min. per side. I stuffed them to the brim, and 3 toothpicks seemed to hold all the goodies inside.  The only changes I would make next time would buy the best quality gouda I can get (I used a pretty cheap kind) and make some kind of sauce to top off the pork after grilling....maybe with melted gouda to keep consistent with the flavors.  The gouda and bacon are a perfect blend for this dish, I am impressed.  Will definitely make again.  Served with Au Gratin potatoes and it was a very satisfying meal!

OMG! These were amazing! I made them last night and couldn't think of a reason to make pork chops any other way after eating them. Our grill isn't working so I took the advice of other reviewers and seared them (in the same skillet I cooked the bacon in after pouring out some of the grease) and then baked them at 350 for about 30 mins (our pork chops were very thick). They were just right! We will for sure be making these again!

This recipe was really good i must add i can not cook so it is really easy to do. I bought to small of pork chops though so i just put the filling on top when it was about grilled  but it was so amazing the cheese was really good and the bacon who could resist. My boyfriend was so impressed he asked me what restaurant i got this from. He still doesn't believe i cooked them thanks darla. Plus i don't really like pork chops so the filling changed up the flavor

First off I want to say that I only rate recipes based on the original posting and this was wonderful the only change I did was to do it with a pork tenderloin. I had family and friends for dinner and they all raved over this dish so this is what I will do with  a tenderloin from now on. Thanks for the recipe. I'd give this recipe a 10 if I could it's that good.

I am giving this 5 stars because my husband really liked them.  I was a little disappointed.  I will try again but next time I think I will slice the Gouda.  I shredded it and I think it caused the cheese to dry out too much.  My only change was to use dried parsley (its what I had on hand) and sauteed the chops in the bacon grease for flavor.  Covered and baked in 350 degree oven for 15 mins and uncovered last 15 mins per other reviews.  Will try again because my husband liked this dish so much.

Very Very Good!!! My family loved this!!! Even my picky 9 y/o daughter. I did make a few changes to the basic recipe. I seasoned my pork chops with season all, onion powder and garlic powder and sauted them for about 5 minutes on each side to help them cook faster. Instead of grilling them I put the pork chops in the oven on 350 degrees. First I covered the pan with foil for the first 15 minutes, then took the foil off and continued cooking the pork chops for an addt'l 15 minutes.  Note: for the stuffing I added sauted onions and garlic Overall, this dish was wonderful and full of flavor. I will definitely make this again!

I've made these twice so far and I love them.  Instead of grilling them I cooked them in a pan with melted butter until browned on both sides and cooked through. I then made a quick pan sauce my adding some white wine to deglaze the pan and then adding some light cream and a little extra S&P.  These are so good and flavorful, my 8yr old daughter even loves them!

This is a great recipe.  I couldn't find "smoked" gouda so I used aged gouda and it tasted fine.  I overcooked the boneless (vs bone-in) porkchops a little bit so if it seemed a little tough it's probably my fault.  I felt like I'd eaten a basketball after downing a 2.5 inch thick pork chop filled with bacon and cheese so be forewarned to back off on the portion size.  Great recipe, though.

I made this today, but instead of pork chops, I used a 1 pound pork tenderloin. I butterflied the tenderloin, pounded flat, and added half of a diced gala apple to the bacon and gouda filling. I couldn't find any good smoked gouda, but I did find a brick of dutch gouda that I couldn't read anything on the package. I preheated the grill to medium high, and cooked on each side for 8 minutes. Let the meat sit tented in foil for about 10 minutes, cut, and served. Gouda goes perfect with fruit and bacon, so I was easily impressed. I served with zucchini and pasta with Parmesan sauce.

Delish!  I made this last night for my boyfriend and I, (celebrating the anniversary of our first date!).  He often raves about how his ex-wife was an amazing cook, and since I am just a novice I've been looking for recipes that will wow.  THIS DID!  He loved it!  I loved it.  I used bone-in chops that were a little over an inch thick.  Pan-seared them in the bacon pan for a few minutes each side, then popped them in the oven, covered, for 10-12 minutes.  They were perfect.  Served with asparagus sauteed in garlic butter, and risotto.  This is a keeper!

SUPERB!  This was spectacular.  I followed another recommendation of pan searing the chops.  I deglazed the pan with a chardonnay and added some cream, and extra parsley, gouda and bacon with a sprinkle of salt.  This sauce went wonderfully over the chops.  As my husband says, "you can't go wrong with pork wrapped in pork".

We messed up on this because my husband grilled the chops to long (they were dry) & I bought boneless sirloin chops instead of bone in & it was hard to stuff them. My "senior moments" also included no bacon in the house so used what I had left of bacon bites. All in all it was good, & will make again. The smoked gouda cheese gave a great flavor. The recipe gets a 5 star, we get 2 stars for following directions.

With just my husband and me for Christmas dinner this year we opted for a non-traditional menu.  This pork chop recipe could not have been a better choice! We made it in the oven at 425 and just kept an eye on it, turning it once while cooking.  I don't care for parsely, so we used only a pinch of dried. To accompany the main dish, we made Roasted Vegetables  http://christmas.allrecipes.com/AZ/RoastedVegetables.asp and Smothered Green Beans http://sidedish.allrecipes.com/AZ/SmthrdGrnBns.asp.. Perfect dinner!

Very good with thick chops or Pork loin. However, all you cooks, do not add the pepper seasoning until cooking is complete. Pepper burns fast and tastes bitter. Simply season the pepper after removing from the heat source when the pork is resting. Much better flavor.

Awesome recipe.  I did add a few leaves of fresh spinach because I had some I needed to use and I thought the color would be a nice addition. Didn't have smoked gouda so used regular gouda as that is what I had on hand.  Can't wait to try it with the smoked gouda though!  I also made a wine mushroom sauce for the top.  Yes, I know I changed a few things, but I can usually tell whether or not a recipe will be good just by reading it.  This is a winner!!!

Wonderful! I did make some modifications based on what I had and not having use of the grill.  I had 3 small center cut chops.  Cooked my bacon and reserved 2 tbsp of the bacon grease in a saute pan.  Butterflied the pork chops and rubbed with a little bacon grease, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Diced the gouda and mixed with a little minced garlic, pepper and Italian seasoning (as I did not have the parsley) and the chopped bacon.  I sautéed the cops in the bacon grease 2 min each side and moved them to a baking dish. Then I carefully (may be hot) stuffed the stuffing into the chop and secured but then added the remainder of the stuffing on top of the chops. Baked for 12 min. @ 425degrees and they were perfect! The husband was thrilled! Served with Scalloped potatoes and steamed Brussels sprouts with a little butter and lemon.

if you want to impress someone .... make this. it looks and tastes sooo professional. my only suggestion is to go with the gouda. it really makes the flavor! can use parsley, or green onion/chives ..also, these are REALLY FILLING. go light with the side dishes, like steamed veg's or a salad ... EDIT - I usually make these pork chops, recipe as stated, but I had some tenderloin, and wanted to stuff it (was going to do apple), but then I thought of this recipe .. it worked GREAT. lay the 'stuffing' on the tenderloin (I used a bit more bacon for the filling, like 7 or 8 slices), roll it up/tie it .. I then made a mustard maple glaze for the outside: 1/4C. maple syrup (buy a high quality maple syrup, not breakfast/aunt jemima syrup), 1/3. cup dijon mustard, plus 1 tsp balsamic vinegar. brush onto rolled tenderloin w/ pastry brush and I cooked it at 400 degrees F for 35 - 40 min .. took it out halfway through and brushed it with the sauce again .. came out perfect .. insides gooey. served with 'garlic dill new potatoes' from this site, and turkish flatbread bread w/ spinach dip. will do it like this from now on (easier than the chops).. great recipe all around.

Worth a 10-star rating!  My grocery didn't have thick enough chops out so I asked the butcher to cut me these. He also cut the pocket in them for me as well.  I would suggest to maybe only use a 1-3/4" thick as these were very thick and took a little longer to cook.  These flavors were fabulous altogether! The next night I took the leftovers and cut them up in a microwaveable dish, added more shredded smoked gouda, cooked bacon and parsley and microwaved until the cheese was melted.  Made an excellent "casserole".

We had some cooked portabello mushrooms left over from last night's dinner so we diced them up small and put them in the stuffing. I can't imagine making this recipe again without them! We loved it! This is definatly going in the rotation.

I made these for 8 people.  I used half gouda and half smoked gouda, real bacon bits, and spinach. I also used some cooking twine. Grilled them for about 15 minutes then finished them in the oven(about another 15). Everyone loved them!

This recipe is outstanding.  I've been passing it out to everyone.  I had thinner bone-in chops on hand and sliced the pockets before they were completely defrosted - works great!  Second time I made these I added about 1 Tbs of finely minced onion, parmesan, corriander, more bacon; you could really create several variations to this recipe.  I grill these and place them in a metal pan when they look almost done and seal with foil and leave them on the grill to continue cooking and rest - usually with the grill off or on low. Sometimes even put the remaining filling on top to melt. Excellent!!!

My family loved this recipe and it was relatively easy to make! Note: if you can't find thick Pork Chops then you can put the filling on half of the Pork Chop and fold the other half over and simply fasten with some toothpicks. Works great!

I made these pork chops tonight and followed the recipe and cooking directions exactly.  One of the butchers at Wegmans cut my chops to my specifications and also offered to make the pocket for me!  DH isn't a huge fan of pork, but did a good job of cleaning his chop!  We both agreed that we would like to try this stuffing in some chicken breasts as well.  This meal is definitely company-worthy.

This is by far the best pork chop dish I have ever made.  Everyone who has tried it LOVES it!  I tried one of the other reviewers suggestions about making the pan sauce- fantastic.  I didnt have the champagne, so I used white wine, which was also delicious.  I pan seared the pork for 5 min each side on medium, then baked them at 350 for ten minutes more.  PEEEERFECT!!  :)

Man, this was SLAMMING!!!  Used more cheese and bacon but that's strictly your preference if you choose to.  Also did it in the oven;  Didn't feel like messing with the grill.  The toothpicks were all I needed.  In case you may be unaware, 2 1/4 inches is HUGE for the pork chops so it can get costly but worth it.

This recipe was very good!  I usually do not enjoy pork chops but the stuffing made it delicious.  Instead of grilling I dredged the pork chops in flour and then sauteed them in a little olive oil about 5 minutes on each side.  Then I baked them in the oven @ 250 degrees for 15 min or so.  (To hold the pork chops together with the stuffing I wrapped them in a slice of bacon).  Then I deglazed the sautee pan with a little white wine then added half and half and a touch of butter.  I poured the sauce on the pork chops and then served them over warm cous cous.  The dish was a little salty, I may use a different cheese next time.  Overall I loved it!

This is excellent!  My husband smokes his own cheese so he was very excited to have such a great recipe to use his cheese with.  This has become one of our favorites.  Just a side note:  at our house we use pecan branches from our yard to cook in our grill instead of charcoal - mostly.  The pecan gives our food a great smoked taste.  This DOES NOT go good with this recipe.   We made this mistake the other night.  Cooking it like this with the smoked cheese makes it WAY too smokey.  The flavor is best on a gas or charcoal grill.

Oooh, this is too easy and too good!  I had the butcher cut the chops for me.  I seasoned them with salt and pepper and let them pan fry for a little bit with some fine chopped garlic and onions before finishing it off in the oven. Just made the recipe with chicken last night and it was almost as good as the pork.  You can definately serve this for company and noone has to know how easy it is to make.

very good & easy.  I used 1" butterflied chops, cut each in half then created a pocket.  This made just the right size for each of us.  I also added sage to the cheese mixture & sprinkled lightly on the outside.  A lot of flavor!

Very good and a little different from the usual (stuffed or just grilled pork chops). There is enough smoky flavor from the bacon so I would like to try with a creamier cheese;maybe Havarti or Camembert...I just hope it holds up to the grilling and doesn't melt away. Will make again but will experiment with different (not necesarily better) flavors.

This recipe was excellent!  My husband was licking his plate clean, he loved it so much!

I altered the recipe just a tad - because I had some fresh tarragon and fresh basil on hand, I chopped that up and added it to the cheese/bacon mix.  And, I made just a little more of the filling than the recipe called for, reserving it to add to my sauteed mushrooms which I served as a side dish.  Both were delish!

Wonderfully easy and tasty recipe!  Our grocery had only precut ones, so we weren't able to get the thicker cuts which meant there was lots of stuffing left over.  Regardless, this was real simple to make and at the end of dinner, my guest and I were gnawing happily on the bones, LOL!

Can you say Devine!!  This was a fabulous recipe.  The pork chops turn out so moist and flavorful.  I purchased a boneless centercut pork loin.  I sliced off pork chops 1 1/2- 2 inches thick and then butterflied each pieced.  2 toothpicks were sufficient to hold each in place for grilling.  The secret is to grill only until the juices run clear so the pork won't dry out.  This will be on my "company menu"!

Amazing flavor. The only changes I made were to cook mine indoors, starting them on the stove top and then finishing them in the oven, and instead of the olive-oil-salt-pepper combo, I used the grease from the bacon, some liquid smoke, and some steak seasoning. Loved the Gouda and bacon filling - will definitely be making this one again!

These were really good.  What can be better than stuffing your pork with bacon!  It was a lot of work... not something I'd do every day, but will make again, for sure!

I made this using a pork tenderloin. I made a pocket by slicing through the middle and stuffed it with the ingredients stated in the recipe. I coated it with the leftover bacon grease instead of olive oil then seasoned with salt and pepper. I inserted a meat thermometer and took it out of the oven when it read 165 degrees. I baked it at 400 degrees and it came out very moist and deicious.

I thought the flavors if this dish were too simple and I did not like the cheese stuffed into the pork chop.  It wasn't bad, but it definitely left me wanting something more.

Love this recipe and nope... haven't changed a thing. Our local grocery store often has the boneless thick cut chops on sale which work great for this recipe. This is a favorite on the grill and great for having last minute company over for dinner as it is fast and easy.

Wow! Wow! Wow! I'm not even a big pork fan and I LOVED this dish (so did my hubby)! The only thing I did a little differently was put a rub of salt, pepper, rosemary, & thyme on the pork and let it sit in the fridge for the day. I also used turkey bacon. Will DEFINITELY make again!

8-10 minutes cooking on each side? It is almost raw. So, we put it back on the grill for 6 more minutes, 3 for each side. Nope, not done. I gave up. My husband plans to bake his in the oven tomorrow for 20 minutes. My brother grills often and he told me he grills the same stuffed chop, 21/4th to 21/2 inch chop for 40 minutes.

I foolishly tried to use butterflied chops.  They were thick enough, but getting the chop closed around the filling was like holding 30 corks underwater.  I used the bacon grease from the bacon as the external oil.  Really emphasized the bacon taste.  It was a bit of a problem getting the chop done enough near the surface of the filling.

I chose to stuff a 1lb pork tenderloin rather than chops for this recipe. Very rich and delicious. Loved the smoky flavor of the cheese combined with the bacon.

Made this in the oven instead of on the grill and it was delicious! To keep the pork chops moist I put them in a glass pan and put about a 1/2 inch of water in the bottom.Covered it with foil. Also I used thick boneless chops.

So yummy!  We used boneless chops and seared them in the George Forman and finished them off in the oven.  Turned out PERFECT!

A nice change from boring pork chops! I was out of propane for the gas grill so did what others had suggested and seared the chops in the leftover bacon drippings to get some nice color, then popped them into the oven at 350 for about 25-30 minutes. They turned out moist and flavorful! The only change I made was using dried parsley instead of fresh, as I did not have any fresh. Everyone enjoyed them, and asked me to make them again some time soon. Sidenote: I actually used boneless chops from Costco, about 1.5" thick. They worked great! I always have too many of them and we get sick of the same old marinades/recipes... so this hit the spot!

Didn't change a thing except cooked it in the oven.  It was a little salty but everything else was GREAT and easy!   Can't wait to try it on the grill this summer!

Beginners this is an excellent recipe to try, not tough at all and delicious.  I recommend that you get the chops from a butcher, you don’t need 2 ¼ inch chops, 1 ½ will do fine.  Also, ask the butcher to cut the pocket for you, makes life much easier.  I made this recipe for 4 on New Year’s Eve and was a big hit, also made Fettuccini Alfredo from this site to go with, excellent compliment.  Check out that recipe as well and read my review for a tip with that.  If you aren’t sold on the Gouda cheese, try cheddar, which is what I plan to do next time around. 

Happy New Yr’s ’08, and happy cooking…

I've made this recipe twice now- both times I have used boneless, thick cut chops, cut my own pocket with a VERY small opening (requires only 1-2 toothpicks), pan seared in the bacon grease and then baked them, seam side up for about 30 minutes.   The first time I used Gorgonzola cheese and extra bacon- these turned out very good but I discovered I am not a fan of "blue" cheeses...  The second time I used the smoked Gouda, extra bacon and a little diced up apple- THIS WAS DELISH!   The apple with the gouda and pork is the perfect mix.  Both times these stuffed chops have turned out super moist and yummy. This is a definite keeper at the top of our rotation!  Thanks!

I made this recipe tonight for my family. It was wonderful! I decided to pan fry these instead of grilling. The Smoked Gouda is a must. What a great combination with the bacon. Absolutly... will use this recipe again.

This recipe was very tasty.  Make sure that you get bone-in porkchops as they are much juicier and moist.  Be careful not to cook them too long as they will dry out.  If you are a cheese lover, you will love the combination of the bacon bits and gouda cheese.  (I used bacon bits because I didn't have bacon and it turned out wonderful)I've made this recipe twice and am making it a 3rd time this weekend!

I was really disappointed, I didn't like this much at all.  Maybe it's the gouda with the pork that I didn't like, but neither me or my husband were thrilled.

Absolutely delish!  It's a great way to make thick cut pork chops more flavorful, since they tend to be bland no matter how much you spice up the outside.  I made exactly as written, and my fiance and I LOVED it.

My husband made this last night using a small pork tenderloin cut down the center. His last bite was one filled with lots of gouda so we recommend adding more. Also, I told him to use proscuitto instead of bacon. Big mistake. Next time, we will only use the crispiest bacon and not anything else. Finally, I also told him to put some sage in the filling mixutre. This didn't bother him but I didn't like it that much. I had made another dish with pork, sage and proscuitto and thought the flavors would be great together in this dish. I was wrong. It came together very quickly and was pretty to look at.

I cooked this tonight for my husband and I. I thought it was just great ! I have very bad luck with pork chop recipes as they tend to be "tough". I had a bone in chop which is recommended and I gave my husband the butterflied thick boneless chop. I loved it - very tender - he said that the flavor was great but the chop was tough ! Story of my life. I will definitely make this again and next time I will maybe brush a bit of hoisin sauce on it after it is cooked and is resting. Thanks for the recipe - I would serve it to company !

Yumalicious!!  I used boneless and it worked out just fine.  The only change I made was to season the oil I brushed on the chops.  It was also very kid friendly.  This will definately go into the rotation.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used pork loin chops and prepared in a cast iron skillet. Next time I will stop the cooking just after the cheese starts to melt and keep covered during resting time.

I always make a recipe the first time according to the instructions and then tweak it next time.  As written, I found it on the bland side.  It needed a sauce or marinade. The meat itself was juicy because I used thick cut, center cut pork loin chops. I definitely liked the taste of the smoked Gouda.  I did not like the taste of the parsley.  If there is a next time, I will substitute spinach for the parsley, add apples (as others have suggested) and either brush it with a soy sauce marinade like Yoshida's or make a gravy.

The taste was ok. The cheese was overpowering. Maybe I used to much cheese. The cheese and bacon made a little salty. The family ate it; will not be making this again.

Excellent recipe, however, as my family Loves garlic, next time I will add garlic to the stuffing. ALSO ~ a nice dry rub would go really well, give it a bit more flavour.

First of all I love Gouda so I thought how could you go wrong.  Well you can't!  These were amazing.  Like all cooks I made just a few changes.  First it was 20 degrees here so I was not going to grill.  I cooked up the bacon, mixed with cheese and added green apples.  They all go well together then I stuffed and yes then I fried them in the bacon grease.  I also used the extra apples, gouda and bacon and added some milk and butter and made a sauce to top the chops with.  AMAZING!  I was trying to keep my dirty pans so that is why I friend in the bacon grease yeah not healthy but oh so yummy!  I have posted this to facebook that is how good it is and I will be making this again!  Of course next time I hope to use the grill.  Just a little bit of work and you get an amazing dish!  WONDERFUL I cannot say enough about this pair with some pots and peas and you are good to go!

I was searching for a new way to make cheapy porkchops when I came across this recipe; I didn't have gouda cheese so I substituted mozzerella and swiss. It was a-MAY-zing! My husband was very impressed and said I have to make all our porkchops that way from now on.

Awesome recipe.  Possibly the best pork tenderloin I have made yet.  Yes, I used pork tenderloins instead.  As I didn't have any cooking twine I used toothpicks instead.  Make sure you try and pull all of them out after you cook the meat though, which can be somewhat difficult, as the whole is less appealing if you have to keep pulling from your mouth toothpicks.  Also, I smothered the tenderloins in Dijon mustard before I put them on the grill - and I'm glad I did as were my guests!

My boyfriend made this when we had my parents over for dinner. My dad said that had he ordered it at a restaurant, he'd ask the chef to come out so he could compliment him on how good it was.

Yummy! I didn't have the thick chops so I used the 1" chops and topped them with the stuffing.  I took the advice of other reviewers and browner the chops in the bacon grease; then cooked the chops in the 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. (Because they weren't thick and I didn't stuff them.) I just used dried parsley in the stuffing and everything turned out beautifully.  These were the most tender center cut chops ever.  We even used plastic cutlery for this meal with no problems.  Served with spinach and garlic bread.  I was going to use the spinach in the stuffing, but I didn't have time to thaw it and I didn't want my bacon getting soggy. I will definitely make this again even if I don't have the thick chops to stuff.

This is a great recipe! Just like others, I added apples. I also made (up) a spicy strawberry sauce by simmering strawberry jam (I would use strawberry's if I had some), white wine, and red pepper in a pot. It was a perfect topping. Happy eating!

You just can't go wrong with bacon and cheese! This was absolutely delicious. I used less parsley, and used smokehouse bacon...Yummy! Unless you really love the taste of parsley, the recommended amount over powers the dish too much. Believe it or not I cooked this on an indoor Foreman grill...it came out amazing!

This was excellent. I used boneless butterfly pork chops. This made the process of stuffing the chops WAYYYYY easier. All you have to do is throw all your stuffing on one half and then flop the other half over on top and toothpick it shut. Tasted gourmet, but I think next time I will use gruyere or some other cheese. Gouda was good...just not my thing.

fantastic! I used another reviewers idea and dusted them in flour and backed for 22 minutes. No salt needed on the chops, the cheese and bacon are enough. My family loved them!

Eh, I think the parsley is a misstep.  It added an odd flavor to the filling.  If I were to make it again, I'd use spinach instead of parsley.

We found the taste of the parsley was way too overpowering. If I make this again I will use very little parsley. Another issue was we could not taste the cheese at all. I'm sorry but this recipe was just not to our liking. But thank you for posting anyway

This recipe was so good and so easy.  i have never stuffed anything in my life but as long as your knife is sharp it isn't as difficult as you might think.  My husband actually said it was the best thing he'd ever eaten which may be a stretch but was probably true in reference to my kitchen!

AWESOME.  I followed some reviewers comments and browned them in a cast irom skillet, added some white wine to skillet,  then put them in the oven (covered) @350 degrees for 15 minutes.  Moist & delicious.  My daughter had some leftover capers and dijon mustard sauce so I topped the chops with this sauce.  Best stuffed pork chops I have ever had.  The gouda stuffing is out of this world.  I used a microplane to shred the gouda and had no trouble with it melting.  Definitely a favorite in our house.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome, and so easy.  I split some thick butterfly chops and made a pocket in the side.  Used butcher's sting to tie the slit closed. And grilled as directed.  Next time I will slice, not shred the gouda.

When I got to the store to buy what I needed for this recipe, I found they had boneless pork chops on sale, buy 1 get 1 free that were thin. So the only thing I changed was to pound out each chop and put the cheese mix in between 2 chops. I cut the chops in 1/2 so they became 2 thick chops. Then put toothpicks all around them to seal. I put them right over the coals til both sides were nice and brown then I placed them to the side of the coals and let the smoke finish cooking them. They turned out AMAZING!! Thank you so much for this recipe, I am going to try this with chicken breasts next.

This dish was amazing!  I had all the ingredients on hand and thought I'd try it today.  I can't wait to have people over and make this for them.  I added some minced garlic to the cheese and bacon filling and next time will add a little white wine also.  Made it on the grill with some grilled yukon gold potatoes and steemed some fresh green beans and garlic on the grill too!  What a great sunday dinner! Thanks!

Got to be honest, I did not cook the recipe as stated. I did not have any smoked Gouda, so I substituted shredded sharp cheddar for my wife and son and Bleu Cheese for mine. Both variations were great.

These were the best pork chops we have ever made.  They are the most requested recipe we have ever made.  Made them as written and have also made them with blue cheese and they were just as great.

This was really good. Used a pork tenderloin butterflied and pounded down. Added cranberries to the mixture as well. The cranberries made it a little too sweet so next time I'll just skip that. Overall was delish.

This is absolutely my favorite recipe from allrecipes!  I love making it with chopped fresh spinach, too.  Try it with a pork loin roast in the oven sometime, too - YUM!

Truely takes no more than 20 mins to cook in pan.. be careful with over cooking!! I also used the filling as a topping for some thinner cuts of pork chops- delicious!

Delicious!! Used tenderlion & butterflied. Added sauteed onions and mushrooms to mixture. Sprinkled salt, pepper & sage on pork before spreading mixture. Rolled up and used baking rubber bands to secure. Lightly floured the outside and seared in bacon grease. Put in 375 oven for about 15 minutes. Will make this recipe again and again!! Thank you so much.

I thought this was exellent!!  To save time I used maple leaf ready cooked bacon bits and it turned out great.  I didn't have smoked gouda so used regular and i was a little unsure to use it anyway with the kids (they are really picky).  Grilled on BBQ and served with salad (fig and balsamic dressing) which went really well with the pork.

These were very good! My pork chops were super thick so we had to be sure the inside was fully cooked, but the filling was delicious and the chops were pretty tender. For the little prep time and great taste, this is definetly a 5 star recipe :) Thanks!

Pretty good! It was a big hit with my boyfriend's family. I changed the serving calculator to 8; I had four really thick, large boneless chops. I cut each one in half and they were the perfect size for a serving once stuffed with the filling. The filling! Everyone kept eating it out of the bowl before I could finish stuffing the chops! I did have some left over also, the plan is to make scrambled eggs for breakfast tomorrow and use up the extra stuffing on them. Mmm, can't wait!

I cooked these in a skillet. I didn't have gouda cheese but i used colby jack. Still fantastic. Make sure your chops are thick enough though because I had troubled making pockets all the way through, they were a little thinner. Used a few more toothpicks per chop, but they were amazing! Thanks for the recipe. Will be making again very soon. Gourmet Style!!! Yummy!

I've made these fabulous chops twice and want to thank Darla for coming up with such a great recipe.  Both times, my dinner guests raved them and demanded to have the recipe, which I shared, of course.  I followed the recipe as written and didn't change a thing.

Delicious! Love the cheesy bacon flavors! Used boneless pork chops. I didn't use the toothpicks and it was fine. Hubby was just careful when turning them on the grill. I do think some sort of sauce over the top would be good for next time because, while the parts with the stuffing were very good, the bites of meat by itself could have used a little something extra. Good stuff though. We will definitely have these again!

Fantastic! My chops were a little too thin to stuff...so I grilled my chops then topped with the gouda mixture and left it on the grill to melt. It was awesome!

I can't remember ever making stuffed pork chops before. I sometimes buy pork chops in bulk from Costco and they're cut really thick so I decided to give this recipe a try. I'm so glad I did! It was amazing! I only changed a couple of things. First of all, I sauteed some chopped onion and mushrooms in a little of the bacon grease and added those to the cheese, parsley and bacon mixture. I also broiled them because my grill was acting funny. They were perfectly done with 8 minutes on each side. My pork chops were boneless, but they had a nice line of fat on one side so it was easy to cut the pocket without cutting all the way through the chop. I used Everglades Seasoning instead of salt and pepper on the outside of the chops. They turned out excellent! My husband and children all loved them. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was very good.  I had to judge the amount of filling to make.  I used probably 8 or 9 slices of bacon and at least 1/4 pound of cheese.  My pork chops were about 1.5 inches thick and there was barely enough filling for the 2 pounds I had.  I'll make this again and make more.  I forgot to put the pepper in the filling but just salted and peppered the chops.  I seared the chops in some bacon grease and then put the skillet in the oven at 350 until there was no more pink.  I had to keep checking them but don't remember how long it took.  The family loved it but wanted MORE FILLING!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was outstanding...I ended up frying the pork because it was raining outside and we could not set up the grill but they turned out just as good.  I am betting you could probably bake these also to be less fattening.

i loved it. i had huge porkchops so i would have added more cheese though. it made it really easy to create the pocket in the chop because they were so thick.

i used dry parsley cause i didnt have fresh.  i sprinkled a little season salt on the porkchops as well, which gave them more flavor.

my husband and i also cooked them on the grill for 8 minutes rather than 5 on each side because of how large they were.

we wet the toothpicks down before putting them in the porkchops.  the porkchops held together well, we used 2 toothpicks per chop.

i made this for my mom and my husband.  we all loved it!

I'm not a big fan of pork chops, but this recipe is a big reason I keep buying them.  I've made it several times and have occasionally had to adjust to one thing or another lacking in my pantry. When my chops have been too thin to "pocket", I've piled the stuffing on top of the cooked chop and stuck them in the oven to melt.  I've also gotten by with dried parsley and bacon chips when in a hurry.  But these are best when I follow the recipe exactly, and make sure to get stuffing spread well in the pocket.  Give this recipe a shot! You won't be sorry.

Phenomenal.  I made it with butterflied boneless pork chops and cooked it inside in a frying pan with a lid (as a thunderstorm kept me away from the grill that night).

One of my favorite recipes so far on allrecipes.com

Very Very Good!  I pan seared, then baked in 425 oven for 20 min, then a few min under the broiler to brown up a bit.  Looking forward to grilling them outside in decent weather!

Easy and tasty. I served this at a family get together, and got rave reviews. I added extra bacon and cheese for the stuffing, 3 pieces of bacon per chop.

We LOVED this one! It was soooooo gouda! I pan seared them first and then placed them pocket side up and covered them in a casserole dish and cooked on low. Will definately make again. I did add some fresh thyme to the stuffing. I also served it with Apple Pecan Cornbread Dressing from this site. It was a great compliement.

Delicious flavors all blended together make this a yummy dish! I did some alterations - buttefly pork loin chops, stuffed it and folded over and broiled until golden brown. This recipe is one I could entertain with!

My kids said to rate this a 3.  My husband said a 4 and I said a 5.  So, a 4 seems to be fair.  There's really nothing that I would do different.  But something seemed to be missing.  I'll keep this and see what happens.  All in all a very nice change for pork chops!

This was fabulous! My husband and I made this for my parents and they were quite impressed! I added a little more salt, and sprinkled the leftover stuffing mix over the top of the finished pork chops as a garnish and to add a little more flavor. Delicious and very easy!

This recipe was great, but we had a problem getting the meat done because of the thickness.  We wondered if this was a misprint; but other reviews did not mention a problem with thickness.  In looking at other recipes for stuffed pork chops, I found 1-1/4" thickness was common - not 2-1/4".  I believe this would have been adequate, and would have worked much better.  BUT, we will definitely try this again - using 1-1/4" chops!.  Thanks.

I loved this!  I broiled it in the oven on the Low Setting for about 10 minutes on each side.  I could have cut it down to 8 minutes. The meat was almost perfect but I think maybe 2 minutes less would have sufficed.  It was yummy.  I made it with thick boneless cuts and it was beautiful and tasty.

EXCELLENT! I didn't have parsely and it was still good. I used a different kind of smoked cheese since gouda wasn't available. Cooked by broiling about 8 minutes on each side. Also used a non bone-in pork chop and it turned out great. Definitely will be making this again!

Delicious!  These chops were great cooked on the grill.  I will broil them in the oven during cold weather.

I did like this recipe very much, but the bacon was very soggy, even though it was cooked and crumbled before hand.  I do think that I will make again, but I think I might add the bacon to the top and maybe add a creamy wine sauce...just to tinker with it.  Thank you for the post.

Even my picky teens liked it! We didn't have bone in chops so I used sliced pork loin and hammered them out thinnly.  Then I put the mixture between two thin chopsand pinched together. Same great flavor!  MMmmm

It was okay. Not a huge fan of gouda, it just lacked real flavor. I have made it several different ways, but the gouda is the problem I think.

One (boneless) pork chop was more then enough for the hubby and me, because what my butcher cut was more like a mini pork roast...HAHA!  I used smoked Gouda with bacon, but still used the bacon in the recipe; I also used cilantro instead of parsley to add an extra level of flavor, and it was fantastic!  It was snowing so I pan seared each side for 8 minutes in a bit of the bacon drippings in my large cast iron skillet; then popped it in a 400 degree oven, covered, for 20 minutes.  Hubby thought he died and went to heaven....a definite do over!!

Paint me yellow and call me a cab!!! This is exceptional. I did change and add somethings. Including sauteing diced onion and garlic w/ ground fresh Rosemary to stuff the chop as well as the smoked Gouda, Parsley and bacon. I used wet tooth picks to hold the opening closed. Then I added more of the onion and garlic, smoked Gouda, Rosemary, bacon and some cornstarch thickened chicken broth and white wine broth that was in the pan w/ the chops. Put a section of Rosemary on top, poured gravy over it and served it to my elderly folks (95 and 89).

Delicious option for a staple at our house: pork chops! I used large butterflied chops and as I didn't have smoked Gouda, used a combo of shredded mozzarella and finely crumbled seasoned feta. Yum!!! My daughter, the salad queen ate every bit of her serving... And might have asked for more, if there was any to be had... Must have been the bacon ??

PERFECT in the oven as well.   As others said, do not change the cheese.  I dusted w corn starch (Gluten Free) browned 3 min a side, baked in 350 oven 20 minutes. Total keeper.  Easy and so gourmet.

The smoked Gouda makes a creamy, smoky goodness like a sauce inside the chop. I scaled the recipe up to 10 chops but stuffed 12. I had enough extra stuffing to stuff 12 more.

This was just ok for us.  We weren't crazy about the bacon/gouda in our pork chops.  I thought we would.  I had high hopes but it just wasn't for us.  Thank you for your recipe.

New favorite meal!  I did as other reviewers did and added some chopped apple and chopped green onions to the cheese mixture.  I also used toothpicks and twine to close.  Family loved it!  The chops were big enough to share.  I will be making every year for Christmas Eve.

Great recipe. The richness of Gouda and the fattiness of bacon makes this a very interesting dish. The only thing I did differently was baked it instead of grilling it. I baked it at 350 for about 1 hour. But I would actually shorten the time so it doesn't get dried out. Maybe 45 mins. Great dish to try

These were fantastic and oh so easy. I actually grilled them and got a gorgeous grilled sear on them and enjoyed them that way. I subbed in gruyere for the smoked gouda and also added an entire bag of spinach to the bacon cheese mixture. The bacon on its own was also plenty salty so to be on the safe side just seasoned the outside of the pork chops with fresh ground pepper and garlic powder (not salt) and it helped to prevent it from being too salty!

My kids normally don't like pork chops so when I made these, they were sceptical, until they tried them.  Then they annihilated them.  These are good with supermarket pork chops but if there is a farmers market, get them there.  You would not believe the difference.

I also brined the pork chops overnight and baked them (350 for about 45 minutes) instead of grilling them.

The hardest part of this recipe is cutting the pocket in the pork chops.  I have found that a tomato knife (I use a Rada) works extremely well, and makes it almost easy.

I served these pork chops at a Valentine's banquet to 80 people this weekend. Everyone raved about them! I used bone in (t-bone pork chop)slightly over 1 inch thick. My butcher cut the pocket for me. Instead of parsley I used basil pesto. Sesoned with olive oil, sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. Grilled over charcoal for about 5 mintues per side. The chops were not quite done, so we put some back on the grill and some in the oven at 450 F for a few mintues.  To get them done. I served with a spinach strawberry salad, parmesan herb risotto and coconut cake. Awesome dinner!

This recipe is fabulous!  My husband raved!  I also did not want to grill due to weather conditions, so I seared for a few minutes on each side in the bacon grease and baked at 350 for around 20 min, they weren't as thick as called for.  I'm trying to the recipe again tonight with chicken breast... I'll update on the resutls!

We did this with a pork tenderloin and could not be more pleased with the outcome. I know this is one of those recipes where you think "Duh, of course it tastes good, pork and bacon and smoked cheese!" but seriously, it really is even better than expected due to the action of the grill. The cheese kind of caramelizes into something special. Try it, it's worth the exorbitant cost of a bit of Gouda!

Absolutely delicious. I have made these several times never using the parsley. They turn out so beautiful. My young children eat them up and so do grandma and grandpa. It's a big hit with everyone. Smoked gouda makes a big difference, don't settle for regular gouda.

Very yummy.  The grill is out of gas, so I pan-seared these on the stove top. Also didn't have any bacon, so I used some salami lunchmeat and smoked gouda slices. After seasoning with pepper, garlic salt and paprika, I stuffed with salami and cheese. Pan fried with about a tablespoon of butter and fresh garlic.  Made a light sauce by deglazing pan with white wine and some cream.

Loved this. I have made it a few times and used sharp cheddar cheese one time and colby jack another because hubby doesnt like gouda. It was delicious and definitley a favorite for everyone. Made for an extended family dinner and everyone loved it and came back for more. Even the kids loved it. Everyone always wants me to make these or give them the reciepe. Plus its super easy to make. the last time I made these I ran out of propane so I transfered them to a saute pan on the stove and they were great.

I use this website all of the time for ideas but very rarely follow the recipe exactly. This was AMAZING. Very simple and the flavor was "out of bounds." The only modification I had was used a thick center cup chop and cooked it a little longer for the thicker cut of meat. PERFECT. Best thing I've ever made on here.

The recipe & ingredients are excellent.  The cooking time is off.  A 2 1/4 inch BONE IN chop will not cook thoroughly in 5-7 minutes per side.  Not on a grill, in a broiler, pan-seared, oven, NO.  It's impossible.  Call me old-fashioned, I don't eat undercooked pork, the timing's way off, luckily I can cook & adjusted to my chop size.  Maybe next time I'll try boneless because this recipe looks time-friendly, but with the proper size chop it will take up to an hour (with prep).  Still, very yummy!

Wonderful!  My family asks for this often.  The only change I make is Gouda, rather than smoked as it's a bit too salty.

I thought these were excellent!  I had boneless, butterflied chops and baked in the oven. I think it's important to do the recipe as is for ingredients, at least the first time. I was going to try cheddar but was very glad I went with the smoked gouda-just awesome. Also, this is a recipe that lends itself to many variations-really to your taste. Definitely-give it a try!

My husband told me, "This is the best meal you have ever cooked!" Since we don't have a grill, I seared the meat on both sides for a couple minutes each, and then baked in the oven at 350 for 20-22 minutes. I think it could have used an extra 5-7 minutes. At any rate, it was an excellent meal, served with southern green beans and fried okra. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this dish for my kids and my mother (who HATES most cheeses FYI). It was absolutely amazing! I did coat the chop with flour on both sides (lightly) and seared it in the bacon greese, then cooked at 350 for 25 minutes. Just amazing! I am planning on making this for our annual family BBQ on Labor Day! :) AWESOME!

Followed the recipe as directed and it was delicious. We love using the grill every chance we get. The gouda and bacon added a nice smoky flavor. Served with a green salad and mushroom cous cous. Will definitely make this again!

Delicious.  My husband called them the Brontasorus Chops!  Will definitely make again!  Had to cook a little longer than recommended.  Chops were a little TOO pink for our taste. Total cook time for us was about 35-40 minutes on the grill at about 300-400 degrees.  Still came out PERFECT!

Make sure your chops are quite thick. At least 1 & 1/2 inches!  The filling is very tasty but you need enough pork to go with it.

This was an absolute hit at my house. My wife had bought a package of miscellaneous boneless chops that had a couple of thick chops and she said see if you can find a good stuffed chop recipe. Being tour typical male bacon and smoked cheese sounded good to me. She was concerned it might be overpowering but is now telling everyone who visits how good it is

This was AWESOME!!  Only suggestion I have is to add more gouda as it is what made it so good..this recipe is definately a keeper - I made the chops in the oven but will try the grill this summer.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I used boneless chops that were about 1 1/2" thick.  Cooked them on charcoal grill (lid closed and not too thick of a base of coals) 9 minutes on one side and 10 on the other.  After I flipped them I added thinly sliced Roma Tomatoes and sprinkled a little more parsely on top.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  Excellent recipe...I've printed it and it's been added to my book.  Five stars!

Made changes because I didn't have all the same ingredients on hand. I love recipes like this that you can take the basic recipe and have fun with it. Thanks for sharing this recipe. The meat came out so tender,flavorful and juicy.

Good recipe, very easy to make.  I grilled each side for 8 minutes but I probably should have done only 5.  Teenage son loved it though!

I thought this was very easy, tasted good and the presentation was nice.  I must have stuffed too much cheese mixture into the pork chops because the cheese didn't melt.  I cooked them on the stove, but will try the grill next time.  Thanks for a unique twist for pork chops.

This recipe was okay. I accidently used Havarti instead of gouda. This may have been the problem. Overall, the recipe was good but I still feel like it lacked a certain something.

I changed it up just a little bit by pounding out boneless pork and wrapping the Gouda and bacon inside of the pork. Mine were more like roll ups. However this recipe is very delicious and we WILL be having it again! Thank you!

This was pretty good. I marinated the pork chop with a mixture of soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and mustard powder overnight, then eliminated the salt in the stuffing. Served with Peppered Bacon and Tomato Linguine from this site.

Used pork tenderloin because I prefer the cut. Husband made it for my birthday and it was simply AMAZING. Truly, give this a try. Every taste was so flavorful. Definately grill it. SO SO yummy!!! This is going in the SAVE box!!! (I made sandwiches the next day with the leftovers ~~what we didnt devour~~.)

I made this last night and we loved the flavors together. I used the pork loin chops, which were harder to stuff and a little tougher than if I had used the bone in chops as directed. Will make this again and also try with apples as suggested by other reviewers.

I followed Elly's idea and also used the pork tenderloin as I hate thick pork chops for some reason. Took and flattened it out, added the seasonings and goodies, then used twine to tie together. The time to roast took WAY longer for me, little over an hour at 400. While it was very good, I think I should have made a cream sauce to pour over as it was a tad dry....probably to my error in the roasting (: Thanks Darla for a nice recipe.

This was very good.  I preped it the night before and my husband popped it on the grill after work.  I think the Pork cut is a little to thick for my liking.  I had to cook it longer then the recipe called for.  I think I would go with 1 3/4 inch chops instead.  Other than that, it was great.

When I first read the recipe it sounded like a great idea, even after stuffing the chops they looked beautiful, but somehow I kept thinking they were going to be bland. I decided to stuff a couple slices of apple inside as well.  Glad I did, the apple was the only thing that gave these chops that something extra I was looking for.  Won't be making this again.

I used Costco boneless chops and grilled on stovetop to give it color then baked in over for 40 mins. Having never tried gouda before I didn't know what to expect. The cheese is delicious but I may have over stuffed because after a few bites, the cheese was a bit too much for me. Will probably make again but with a different cheese that also melts easier... maybe something simple like monterrey jack. BTW my family was very impressed with me. Hubby thought it was ok, he's picky & didn't care for the cheese. The pork cooked nicely in oven and was super moist.

I was a little skeptical because I had never tried Gouda cheese, but I got some in a Christmas basket, so I didn't want it to go to waste. YUMMMMMMMMMMMM!  Pork chops are one of my least favorite meats, but I make them because my husband loves them...I have no problem making them more often with this recipe!!

This is by far the best pork recipe we have ever had.  I have been cooking this for my family since the summer of 2007 and every time I cook it everyone raves about it as if it were the first time they had ever eaten it!!  I started out preparing this on the grill as stated in the recipe until we had to sell our grill.  Because we love this recipe so much I had to bake it in the oven.  I bake thick cut bone in or boneless pork chops or use the filling to stuff chicken breasts instead on occasion.  In the oven I bake chops at 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes on each side.  So yummy!!  The only thing I do different from the recipe is to add less salt.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Yum!  Both my husband and I loved this recipe.  Super simple to make, cooks perfectly, and has beautiful presentation on the plate.  The taste was fantastic, although we may cut down on the parsley a little next time.  We did it exactly per the instructions, and the recipe was perfect.  Definitely a keeper - thanks!

I have made this three times, all with pork tenderloin, using metal skewers to close the tenderloin, and cooking on the grill.

Excellent!  And beautiful on the plate, sliced into roulades.

My family loved this. My daughter isn't too fond of porkbut ate it and asked me to cook it again. The gouda and bacon really compliment the pork. I couldn't cook it on the grill so I broiled it. It turned out fine but I will try the grill next time around.

I got tired of grilling using the same marinades time and again.  I found this recipe and decided to make it as a surprise supper for my wife.  It was a huge hit!  Both of us love it and it is very easy to make.  If dressed up properly it can impress guests and make for a fancy meal.

These were good and easy to make, just a little time consuming.  I seemed to dirty every pan in my kitchen.  Cooking the bacon, baking the chops - not to mention the dishes to cook the rest of my dinner.  If you inexperienced like me, budget yourself some time to make these.  Excellent pork chops, though!

this was delicious, and very easy to put together.  i sauted some red peppers, onions, garlic and mushrooms in a small amount of the bacon drippings, along with some chicken broth to serve on top. everyone loved it.  simple, but classy enough to serve for company.

Made this last night, it was very tasty.  My chops were too thick to finish on the Foreman so I popped them in the oven until all the pink was gone.  My picky fiance loved them!

This was the first stuffed pork chop recipe we have tried. What a standard to set! It was exceptional! We followed the recipe to the "T". The butcher where we got the chops cut a nice pocket in them and we didn't even need toothpicks. I still can't believe how good these were! Can't wait to make them for company! Thank you!!!

This recipe was AWESOME!!!! It is super good in a thick chicken breast also. What I did so the cheese wouldn't melt out was cooked the meat first then cut the meat so it had a pocket like a pita bread and stuffed everything in there. Yum yum yum.
Would recommend to anyone who loves their gouda!

FAB!!!! I used boneless pork chops and I browned them in a small amount of butter in a pan then simmered them in a white wine/chicken broth mix instead of grilling them. I also made an apple glaze with white wine and apple preserves and thickened it with some cornstarch. I love Gouda and I loved using with this recipe. Thank you! Very easy to make!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I browned the pork chops in the bacon grease first before BBQing per other reviews and the taste was amazing.  The smoked gouda really added a rich flavor.  I think I will try apples next time like the other reviewers suggested.   I will be making this again!

I believe a recipe is a start for a cooking idea. I never follow them exactly; except for baking. I added a large spoonful of cream cheese and some finely chopped garlic chives from my herb garden. Next time, I might even add finely diced apple. This was delicious! Do not add salt, as the gouda and bacon provide plenty.

Mmmmm Gooda!  The fam's fave yet!  I did substitute bacon for spinach because that would have been meat overload for me.  But I can imagine the smoky flavor of the gouda and the bacon coming together nicely.

Good recipe for company.  After making the slit, used my thumbs to "stretch out" the meat and make a little pocket.  Added apples to the stuffing, next time need to dice it smaller. Will use the left over stuffing for chicken.  Kids liked it. Will make again
Add: Still had leftover stuffing and have used it for stuffing mushrooms

Left out the salt otherwise the recipe was followed as written.  Next time I'm adding the apples...this was soooooo good

Very tasty stuffing.  I tried stuffing a tenderloin and roasting it and I'm not sure if that worked as well as pork chops would have, but I enjoyed it nonetheless!  Thank you!

Absolutely adore smoked gouda to begin with. Only change was to use boneless chops maybe an inch thick, and turkey bacon to cut the calories. Incredible mix of flavors. Will do again for sure!

I made this for my brother-in-law for Father's day.  It is a keeper.  What a delicious flavor profile...simple, clean, and very easy to make.  The cheese and bacon give the pork moisture and flavor that is out of this world!  We all loved it!

I used smoked gruyere instead of gouda, but boy was it good! I baked it in the oven instead of grilling, and since I made only one chop, I put the extra stuffing on the top and put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Served it with steamed cauliflower and sauted mushrooms. Mmm, Mmm!

I used 4 ounces of gouda and 3 slices of bacon. Added no salt. Stuffing was extremely salty. Felt that other than the very center, this was just another pork chop. I did brown first in bacon fat and then baked for 30 minutes at 350. I have no desire to have this dish again. Both diners feel the same way.

This was very good! I used feta instead of Gouda. After it was cooked, I sprinkled feta and parsley on top and served it with cheesy rice and extra stuffing.

This filling recipe was great! I would have given this 5 stars but the pork chops were way to thick. I had to cook them more than two times longer than the stated time for them to get done in the middle. Next time i will either get smaller chops or maybe an inch thick and at the end i would put the filling on top of the chops and put under the broiler til melted. Thanks for the great recipe.

My fiance made this for supper one night. He followed the recipe exactly as it states (although we had to get creative with how we stuffed the chops and we broiled instead of grilled)and it was WONDERFUL!! These are by far the best pork chops I have ever had. They were so good, we made them again that same week. :-) This will definitely be a recipe we use again and again and again. Thanks!

Outstanding! Crumbled the bacon in my mini-food processor to get it to the right consistancy.  Didn't have any fresh parsley, so I just used a tsp. of dried parsley.  Came out fantastic on the grill.  This one's a keeper!

Great base recipe that I altered for our taste,used boneless chops pan seared them since don't have a grill right now no added slat like others said with the cheese no added salt was needed I did sprinkle the chops with some pork seasoning I had so that might have had a bit of salt and I also made a cream sauce from the pan drippings, deglaze the pan with some chicken stock and add heavy cream simmer until thickened. YUMMO!!

This recipe was terrible.  Way too salty and the gouda cheese did not go well at all.  We ended up eating pizza instead.

Awesome awesome awesome!  Thank you for the great recipe.  Aside from using boneless pork chops simply for lack of any decent looking bone-in chops at the store, I did not change a thing.  Restaurant quality stuff here.  Use the good smoked Gouda - it adds a wonderful cheesy / buttery / smokey quality to this dish.  Served it with Garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie.  My husband was very impressed.

Must use bone in pork chops.
I added chopped green apple to the mix and I browned the stuffed chops in the bacon grease and then baked them @ 325 until cooked through and then returned them to the skillet to give them a bit of color.  This dish is amazing and so simple!

Very good recipe!  The gouda blends very well with the pork!  Next time I'll make this recipe, I'll include sliced mushrooms and a bit of chopped up jalapeno peppers since I enjoy my food spicy.

Very delicious. My only suggestion is to cut down on the cheese, I personally love cheese and thought it would melt out a little when it cooked but it didn't and when we ate everything it was just a little over cheesy but still delicious.

Great recipe. I made this for a party of 9 during our beach vacation and it was wonderful. I did not have access to a grill, so I browned the pork chops in a pan on the stove and then finished in the oven. Do not overcook , or the pork with be tough.

I made this recipe last night and it turned out excellent.  Instead of bacon, I used some ham and I added onions as well.  Everyone loved it!

Mmmmm...the pork chops were great!  Smoked gouda was perfect with the bacon.  I brushed bacon grease on each side of the chops while they were on the grill for that extra bacon flavor.  :)

My husband, kids and I loved these chops!  My neighbor gave me an enormous bag of apples, so I added about 1/2 of a small one to the stuffing (diced).  Great recipe :)

Excellent!  Easy and quick to prepare, yet looks and tastes gourmet.  Only change I made was adding a little onion to the stuffing.

Great recipe! Cooked close to 8 minutes on each side with medium grill heat. Used a thick cut pork chop. Everything was great. The kids really liked it too.

This was good however I didn't think the flavor of the cheese stood out that much against the pork chop.  I couldn't help but think it might be better with a boneless chicken breast?  I chose to grill my chops a few minutes on each side then transfer to a 425 oven to finish the cooking process.  You really can't take any chances with pork not being fully cooked.  My kids don't think it's pork chops without mushroom gravy and since I didn't have any drippings to cook the gravy in I just used a can of cream of mushroom soup, about 3/4 cup beef broth, added milk till it was a good consistency, a bit of dry sherry and some fresh ground pepper.  Everyone loved it but I'm not sure the stuffing was worth the effort.  I will try with chicken.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I used gruyere instead of gouda and it was fantastic.  Our grill was out of propane so I did these under the broiler for a few minutes per side and they came out perfectly.  Two thumbs up!

Delicous!  The smoked Gouda & bacon add an interesting depth of flavor ~ we used cilantro instead of parseley as neither of us like parsely and it was fantastic!  Will make again!

Used a Rachael Ray trick and instead of buying thick chops, bought thin, stacked them and secured with tooth picks.  This dish did not have the smoke cheese flavor we were looking for.  Maybe we were expecting something else.  Everyone else loved this dish.  To us, it is something we tried and will not make again.

Sooooooooooo delicious and surprisingly easy!!!  The gouda (my husband pronounces it "howda") added such a great flavor.  I bought thick pork chops that were easy to stuff - and kept them closed with two toothpicks each while grilling - excellent recipe!

These are wonderful.... Although, we added some dried minced onions and celery salt to the cheese mixture and then rubbed the outside with some mesquite smoked seasoning.  Also grilled some fresh stuffed mushrooms on the side.  We are already planning to have these again....

Very good! This is an excellent way to stuff your chops. I seasoned w. salt and pepper first, then stuffed. Came out great. Needs a little spice tho, I think Italian Seassonings would go well sprinkled on this.

This was very easy to make for someone like me who doesn't cook much.  I think I would like it better though with 1/2 the amount of cheese mixture.  My husband ate 2 chops and liked it very much (he is an AWESOME cook and doesn't eat anything that doesn't taste great).  Nice recipe.

These were good.  I did have a hard time cutting the pork chops, and just ended up putting the cheese and bacon on top of the pork and melting the cheese in the oven for a few minutes.  Next time I think I will use a different cheese, the gouda was a little strong for my taste.

Easy to make. Go light with the salt because the bacon in the stuffing is salty. Hubby & I thought this was pretty good but not delicious enough to make again.

Had to improvise! We were gonna do the chops on the grill. Weather said "No, too cold". Prepared according to recipe and seared on both sides in a "Cast iron skillet" for 6 minutes each side. Placed in oven at 400* for total of 15 minutes and let it sit for 5 minutes. Turned out 5 star good. Would do again with 1 1/2" chops in skillet again. Less time in oven.

It's delicious.  I think you could use a lot of cheeses, not just gouda.

Wow, super easy as tasty. Changed it up a little for convenience. Pan seared in my cast iron and then finished off in the oven at 350.

Excellent recipe I changed it up due to what I had on hand or could find in our rural country grocery. I did use plain Gouda & tossed it with a generous amount of liquid smoke. I also used venison tenderloin, pounded flat. I both rolled & folded the meat after placing filling it, then secured with toothpicks & baked for 20 at 400 (watched the oven carefully; venison is SO much better cooked at medium - less “gamey” tasting  & much more tender). Was a big hit. Even cold, it was very good

Absolutely delicious! We made a couple slight adjustments. I HIGHLY recommend using thick sliced bacon from your grocers meat department rather than packaged bacon. We cut the bacon into fairly larger pieces (not crumbled). Also, we used a rub on the pork  and pre-cooked it on the grill until it was also done BEFORE stuffing it. Only took a couple minutes for the cheese inside to melt.

Better than expected!  The gouda cheese with the fresh bacon bits added a great flavor. Good note not to over cook, I used slightly thinner chops and cooking time was six minutes per side, and they were done.  Also the gouda cheese didn't run but I used a grill mat, just incase.  Can't wait to serve this disk again.

I made this recipe as written and we loved it, made it several times.  Later I changed it by substituting baby spinach for the parsley and we loved it.  I usually have baby spinach on hand and not parsley except when it is the garden.  Tonight I am making it with the spinach but another change, I was in the hospital last year and was on a low sodium diet so instead of pork bacon I could only have turkey bacon.  That is what we have now because of the low sodium diet.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make and delicious.  Make sure that you don't cut it all the way through like I did.  Otherwise, you will lose some of the filling.

Wow!  This was AMAZING!  Too cold to grill so I baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Otherwise followed recipe as is. My husband is usually ho-hum about pork chops but tonight he gobbled them up!  Definitely a keeper and going into our usual rotation.

Really nice flavour, I added finely chopped raw mushrooms to the cheese and bacon mixture before stuffing - gave it a nice earthy taste that paired well with the smoky flavour of the bacon and cheese.

I have made this recipe twice.  once following the recipe, and another time with a different cheese and cut of pork.  You really can't go wrong here.  if it's winter, just put them under a broiler at low for 8-10 mins per side.

I've made this before using this recipe. This time around I modified it a bit.
I brined the chops for about 2 hours. I did not use the bacon this time as it's salty enough with brine and the gouda. I did add chopped apples (about a 1/3) to have a nice complement to the other ingredients.
Cooked on the stove in a cast iron pan.

The cheese keeps the pork chop moist and tender.  I added Serendipity seasoning to the outside of the chop for added flavor.

Next time the family wants Pork Chops! I made it with a Pork loin and roasted in the oven due to very cold temperatures here in FL(38). So the cheese melted and settled to the bottom of the pan. The flavors were there just a bit unappealing.  Can't wait to try it with the chops on the grill.

Fabulous recipe.  I hate it when people rate recipes they've tweaked but I'm going to do that now.  I brined the pork chops and made them according to the recipe.  It was delish.  I had a couple of brined, uncooked  chops left over and decided to make the recipe again, but this time I used chopped prosciutto instead of the bacon.  It was even better!  Either way, it's a great recipe and my new favorite way to make pork chops.

My partner Jerry said, "This was, hands down, the BEST stuffed pork chop I've ever tasted."  Simply perfect! I didn't change a thing except for baking it in the oven. It's 32°F here and to cold to grill outside. :D

I cooked this in the oven as it was too cold outside to use the grill.  It turned out moist and tender.  However, the smoked gouda and bacon make the pork taste like fish.  Not a good combination, to our family.  I will try it again but with probably a swiss or a nice mild cheese.

An enjoyable , not too difficult to prepare dish that is an instant pleaser.  There are many different stuffings that you can use; we like crab meat.  Also, be careful to use the tooth picks so that the contents do not leak out. This takes some experimentation.  Very savory.  You'll love it!

Loved this recipe as did all my boys.  Used Provolone cheese in place of gouda

This recipe is easy to prepare stuffed pork chops. I made this pork chop along with a different one from this site. My husband loves smoked gouda and had this one. He gives it a rating of 3 stars. Some of the cheese seemed to escape (likely our fault in the sealing of the chops and grilling process) and there wasn't enough balance in flavors for him. Per Mr. Q, it seemed like there was just parsley and bacon, with hints of the Gouda here and there. I also tossed in a little bit of diced apple to the mixture and it didn't add anything other than a nice contrasting texture. The chops were moist/tender, but I did brine the pork chops first for about 6 hours using a recipe from Baking Nana (http://bakingnana.com/to-brine-or-not-to-brine/ ), rinsed the chops, and proceeded to follow this recipe. Per hubs, the brine worked really well with the pork chops flavor wise. We may try this recipe again in the future and ensure using more cheese and sealing them right...use less parsley too or a different herb perhaps. Thanks for the recipe.

LET ME TELL YOU ALL THIS WAS SUCCULENT, SAVORY  & AMAZING!! I did tweak it a bit, just as one of the other lady suggested. I added apples chopped ,  I used maple bacon, and Instead of parsley (b/c I didn't have any) I used Italian seasoning . Pan fried in my cast iron skillet which had some left over chicken grease in it . 3 mins each side then in the oven @ 350 for 30mins . My boyfriend isn't big on cheese but he absolutely loved this. The combination of the smoked cheese and apples with the maple bacon was irresistible. I definitely will be making this again .

Really great! I had used an aged Gouda on sale, and boneless center cut pork chops. This went amazing with some rice pilaf. I will probably make again!

nothing special. fresh parsley is a little overpowering compared to  other ingredients. gouda is probably not the best cheese either.

I used half cream cheese, half sharp cheddar cheese because it's what I had in the fridge. I added a tablespoon of sourcream. It turned out great. No leftovers!

It calls for 2 chops but I had enough stuffing for 3 (So I made 3)!  This recipe came out delicious and the timing was perfect.  For once I didn't over cook pork chops!

Gouda and bacon is a good combo with pork! I think it would be good with chicken, too. I baked in the oven instead of grilling. Tasted delicious!

It was ok. I think I would probably use blue cheese crumbles instead of the gouda to just give it a little oomph

I used boneless pork loin cut into about 2" thick pieces and a Spanish smoked cheese, because I couldn't find smoked gouda. Delicious! My husband loves it and keeps saying we should make this the next time we have guests for a barbecue.

So delicious, even my overly picky teenager said it was good. I fried them in coconut oil for 4-5 minutes per side, then topped them with leftover cheese mix and broiled them for a few minutes. Yum yum

These pork chops were delicious!!  I used very thick boneless chops. I went heavy on the cheese and bacon and added some baby spinach to the filling. Stuffed the chops, secured with a few toothpicks, and seasoned with a tiny bit of salt and plenty of pepper. I seared the chops in the same cast iron skillet I used to cook the bacon, then placed the skillet in the oven to finish cooking, about 20 minutes at 375. Next time I will probably not salt the chops at all.... the cheese and bacon add plenty of salty taste and great flavor!  These are very rich and heavy with the cheese and bacon, so served with Emeril's lemon-garlic roasted cauliflower. Yum!! This recipe is definitely a keeper! :)

Well, I had a hard time splitting the chops due to a dull knife so instead I just seasoned, breaded, fried lightly then laid a slice of Gouda cheese on top and baked in the oven. Flavors were good! The recipe wasn't followed exactly but it gave me good ideas for the flavor combination. I'll make again =)

I followed the recipe except I butterflied a pork tenderloin and stuffed and tied it. Grilled it 10-12 minutes per side. Also added some sautéed garlic and red onion to the stuffing. Very good!

If you're thinking about trying this, don't hesitate!! Absolutely delicious! We don't usually care for pork chops, but these are amazing, we'll be making again soon. The only change I made was to sear both sides in the bacon grease, put in a greased pan and then bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Soooo good!

Mine turned out crappy because I was an idiot and didn't follow directions.  I tried to be extra fancy and threw on a thick glaze that made it tough and charred.  I almost pulled a tooth out because of that stupid idea.  I'm trying it the right way, per recipe.  I'm sure it will be amazing.  I give myself a -2 star rating.  Always follow directions so that you can blame the other person if you hate it .

I made this,  except instead of grilling I baked it, it was amazing!  not super tender but still very tasty. I baked it at 350, then bumped it up to 400 for 5 mins or so to make sure it was cooked through.

It was too cold to grill outside so I used a Horseradish Mustard and spread it on the outside of the pork chops after I'd stuffed them and pressed them into bread crumbs  baked then baked  them in the oven at 400 degrees.  I also found some gouda cheese with bacon in it. They turned out great!  You have to use fresh parsley, too.

Made this last night and everyone loved it. I used Italian Seasoning because I was out of parsley and used more cheese. I also seared the chops before baking at 350 for 10 minutes each side

Followed the recipe except for using garlic salt instead of plain salt for a little more flavor.  Great taste off,the grill.   This is a keeper.

I made no changes to the recipe, but I seared them in my cast iron skillet and finished them in the oven. They turned out perfect! Considering how simple they are, and how much everyone enjoyed them I'll definitely be making these again.

I didn't think the recipe had enough flavor.  The meat was rather bland.  The cheese started oozing out of the pork chop while it was cooking and we ended up loosing a lot of it.

It might be better if the pork chops were marinated first or if a stronger flavored cheese was used.

I made this recipe a few nights ago, and my boyfriend and I LOVED IT. Some slight modifications- I had goat cheese in my fridge, so I used that instead of Gouda, and it was raining outside, so I made them by frying them in some olive oil just to brown the outside, and then placed them in the oven at 350° for 20 minutes with some brown sugar on top for a little sweetness. we were drooling. My only complaint is that I should have made more!

Wonderful!  Added minced garlic into the stuffing for a bit more flavor and sea salt/cracked pepper for the crust.  Personally, I think I over-salted it but reviews were positive.

Delicious and easy, I made this recipe as written. I did use boneless center cut thick pork chops instead of bone-in. I cut pretty deeply into the pork chop to make the pocket, but was afraid to get too close since I didn't have the bone.  Cut as deeply as you can, you want that stuffing in there as close to the end as possible.  The flavors of the Gouda and bacon really complement the pork, and who doesn't love cheesy goodness? Came together very quickly after a long work day and yet is elegant enough to serve to company.  My husband even ate two pork chops!

couldn't make exactly as didn't have big chops and no grill so I rolled the stuffing in a pounded pork loin chop, fastened with toothpicks, brushed with a little mayo and dreged in panko and seared in a little oil to seal edges then baked for an hour at 350 and they were so good, real smokey flavor to the chop and will make again. We had spinach strawberry salad and baked potato with this.

I made this as written except for the parsley. It was yummy! Next time I make it I think I will add mushrooms and maybe a little bit of onion. the only other thing that I did different was that I baked them instead of grilling them.

Delicious!  We bought a 4lb pork loin & watched videos on how to butterfly, stuff & roast it.  We chopped about 20 slices of cooked bacon & placed on the seasoned & butterflied pork. Used 12-16oz smoked Gouda sliced very thin- placed on the bacon pieces. Rolled up & tied the pork loin then baked it at 450 for 15 mins then 325 for about 45 minutes.  Definitely will try this again in the spring with pork chops on the grill, because the cheese & bacon combine beautifully with the pork!

OMIGOSSSSHHHH!!! My dinner guests RAVED and commented that these were the best chops they'd ever eaten! Other than tripling everything and subbing 1 1/4 in. thick center-cut pork chops for thicker cut ones, I made no changes to this recipe. THESE ARE FANTASTIC AS WRITTEN!!! NOTE: The smoked Gouda in this is key. It really enhances the bacon and grill flavors. If you need a perfect entree to wow your guests, these are sure to impress! Thanks for sharing your awesome recipe, Darla! :-)

Oh. My. God. This was absolutely AMAZING. Prepared exactly as instructed with two exceptions. 1. I added fresh minced garlic, and 2. I marinated the chops over night with a marinade recipe also found on this site. Served with grilled asparagus. This tasted like it should have been served at a high-end restaurant. Perfect summer grilling dish! Thank you so much for sharing.

I pan fried these thick, boneless pork chops for about 10 min each side.  But mine were so thick that they were getting too dark but were still not cooked enough (according to a meat thermometer).  So I put them in the oven at 350* for at least 20 min until their temp got to 145*.
Other than this cooking change (we have no grill) I followed the recipe and it was yummy!

Definitely a repeat!   Did not have smoked gouda, which we love!  Used shredded Colby jack cheese, diced onions, mushrooms and crumbled bacon.  My  husband put a bourbon rub on outside and grilled.  Fabulous!

I cooked this for my girlfriend and we both really liked it. I used one of the mini webber grills and the cook time was significantly longer.  Outside of the that it was a great meal and I definitely will cook it again

My whole family loves this recipe, even my kids who are extremely picky. I wanted to grill them like the recipe said but when I went out to grill, I was out of propane. I just threw them on the griddle and they were perfect. The only thing I added was a little more cheese. If you haven't tried it yet, it is definitely worth it.

This was delicious!  My grocery store didn't have the thick cut pork chops, so it was a little tricky cutting a pocket into the thin ones, but it all worked out.

We live in an apartment that doesn't allow grills so I browned the pork chops in the same pan I did the bacon in (4 minutes or so on each side) then baked them at 350° for 45 minutes. They turned out fabulous!!

This recipe is amazing.  My husband said it even beats his mom's pork chops, which is has been his "birthday dinner" for as long as I have known him.  I Added a whole chopped fuji apple with the skin on, and it added the nicest crunch and flavor.  I have used both gruyere and regular gouda and its been a hit both times.  Not a big parsley person, so I used a lot of basil instead.  Yum!

I ussually don't like pork chops but these were amazing. The only thing I did diffrent was I didnt grill them. I put a lil olive oil and little water and some dry white wine in a skillet. About 1/8 cup water & aprox 1/2 cup white wine. Put the pork chops in and covered for about 8 minutes on each side. My guests were begging for more!

I've made these several times and they're always excellent, but tonight I made them with fresh rosemary instead of parsley and they were even better.  Great recipe and not at all difficult.  Goes well with gourmet mushroom risotto, by the way.

This turned out to be a great dinner idea. Only variation I added was throwing crushed red peppers in for some kick. Other then that stuck with the recipe and it turned out delicious!

These Chops ROCK!!! So yummy.  I put frozen drained spinach in my stuffing to add a little more somethin' somethin'! I did not use 2 1/2" chops with bone. They are hard to find. as long as its a thick(er) chop and you dont cut all the way through. The grill adds lots of flavor to them, so use the grill for sure. The gouda is a very flavourful cheese and went perfect. I will be making these again :)

This is a winner! I have made it a few times now, with different cheeses and prosciutto once in place of the bacon, always a hit. Easy, fast, gourmet! What more could you ask for? :)

Made these for dinner because I had extra Gouda and someone from the exchange recommended them. I did them in the oven on 350 for about 20 minutes and they were not only rib-stickin’ good to satisfy the hubby but the prep and presentation still made me feel gourmet. Next time I’ll definitely buy thicker ribs (they only had inch thick available) because it was difficult cutting the pocket. I’m looking forward to making them again

Tried this without any modification, all I have to say is wow. I guess its no surprise when you love pork, smoked gouda, and bacon! I think next time I will add more gouda or melt some on top.

The whole family liked this one. Had some trouble with leakage even with toothpicks.But I did it with a loin end pork chop, was all I had. Seared on top of stove and then put in oven with foil. Next time will definetly use grill.

awesomely divine recipe!  I wanted something different to do with my boneless loin chops and found this...We LOVE smoked gouda and bacon, so what a perfect combo! I agree with another and not use the salt to season as the bacon and gouda give enough salty flavor!

I have made this recipe several times.  It is always delicious.  Cooking it can be tricky because you need to make sure you don't overcook the pork but at the same time get the cheese to melt.  Just make sure to use a medium heat setting on the grill.  My 4 and 6 year old love them too.

Used butterfly'd boneless chops, left out the s&p in the filling.  Sprinkled my pork dry rub on the outside about an hour before grilling.  The smoked gouda sets it off something great.  The filling was just delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

DH and I really enjoyed this recipe.  Living in Iowa, we've had pork chops many different ways, but this is one of my favorites now.  It was very easy to put together and after 7 minutes per side, they were done perfectly.  DH is looking forward to taking them with him on his fishing trips to impress the others.  :)  Thanks for posting!  Will definitely be keeping this one.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Different from the everyday norm.  It was very flavorful and moist (11-12 min total).  I did add diced gala apples to the cheese mixture.  I do believe it will make a monthly rotation at my home.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I used real bacon bits to save on time and seasoned the chops with Adobo before placing on the grill.  I might add diced apples next time to see how that tastes as others have suggested.

These were excellent. Gouda is the perfect cheese because it doesn't ooze when it melts like cheddar does. Stays inside and adds the perfect flavor to pork. Really impressed everyone with this one!

I made these two nights ago and were delicious. I seared stuffed and seared them in a pan then transfered to the oven for 15 minutes at 375. They came out perfect. My boyfriend isn't a fan of pork but he said if he had to eat them, these are the ones to have.

this was awesome I did change slightly I butterflied boneless chops and seasoned with pepper, Italian seasoning and a little bit of Cajun seasoning covered with bacon cut into bits and then put cheese on top and then baked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes I may add some sliced apples under the cheese next time to give the sweet and savory.

WOW!!!  This recipe is awesome. I used boneless pork loin chops and substituted fresh spinach for the parsley. I also cooked the chops in a cast-iron on the stove and cooked them in the fat from the bacon. Yummy. Rave reviews from the men. Clean plate dinner!!!

I just made this last night for my boyfriend, and he loved it.  At the end of the meal, he said, "That was really good.  It was freakin' delicious.  Are you going to finish that?" and finished the last morsel on my plate.  It will become part of our rotation.  To make it more low-fat, I used turkey bacon.  Since I don't have a grill, I pan seared it over high heat in the pan with the bacon grease to give it some color.  I then broiled it about 3 inches from the flame for about 4 minutes per side.  The market didn't have the 2 1/4 inch chops I used 1 inch boneless loins.  Also, I didn't have toothpicks, and it was fine.  Having the filling ooze out of the chops was a nice visual when I served them.  These were served with brown rice and a spring mix salad with pine nuts and balsamic vinagrette.  Yummy!

Instead of cutting a pocket into a porkchop, I used a boneless porkchop pounded thin, then folded over itself to contain the mixture. Also added a little paprika to the outside of the porkchop, turned out fantastic!!!

These were SO yummy! I used pepperjack instead of Gouda(that's what I had on hand.) I sprinkled them with garlic salt, cracked pepper and a tab bit of salt before I seared them in olive oil and butter before putting them in the oven.(350 for about 25 mins) I served them with jalapeno & cheddar mashed potatoes and fiesta corn. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Very yummy! A very nice combination of flavors. I cooked it on the stove, but will grill it next time. Cooking the pork chops on the stove led to a much longer cooking time.

Fabulous! This recipe has now made every member of my household a fan of smoked gouda cheese. Our chops were thick enough to make deep pockets and there was very little leakage (which I was expecting)... I will be making this on a regular basis...

I had a tenderloin, so I tried the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and butterflied it, pounded it out, then stuffed it with the filling.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 45 min. Served with plain white rice. My husband loved it and so did I.

Absolutely wonderful!!  The taste is great and they are visually appealing too.  I did not grill mine.  I seared them in a fry pan then finished them off in the oven.  I simply seasoned the outside with a little garlic pepper, no salt.  I used  boneless loin chops because that is what I had in the freezer.  These were a huge hit with everyone.  Definately company worthy.

These pork chops were very tasty. I used pancetta instead of bacon since I had it on hand and added some chopped chives and grated garlic to the mix. The chops seemed to be extra juicy and flavorful.

Wonderful! I used 2 thinner chops and put filling in between.  Also used sliced smoked gouta instead of shredded.  Seasoned with Montreal spicy seasoning, then coated with olive oil before grilling........absolutley wonderful!!  Quick and easy too.

In my husbands words "this is  good!" This was wonderful, the thick cut chops were moist and tender, the bacon and gouda was an excellent combo.  I used boneless chops a little over 2 inches thick as that's all my butcher had available, a used italian flat leaf parsley (which we felt was a little overpowering and will cut way down next time), and I sprinkled them with a garlic salt seasoning and fresh cracked pepper.  Very yummy and we'll be making these again!  Thank so much for sharing the recipe.

Very impressive.  I like that the stuffing didn't have bread crumbs or other fillers.  Great for low carbers.  I want to try this using chicken breast.

Hubby LOVED this.  I thought it was alright.  Had more fun eating the chuncks of smoked gouda all week lol.  I didn't even need twine or tooth picks.  I guess the ones I got were thick enough and held their own.  Will definitely make this at least once a month or so.  Thanks for the idea :-)

Extremely good and surprisingly juicy. Most pork chops I make are dry. The gouda cheese bacon really make this stand out. It will be served when next I have people over when I'm grilling!

These were by far the best pork chops ever!!  First time I made them I only had monterey jack cheese on hand so I breaded them, fried them, and baked them as others had suggested.  They were awesome!  Next time I followed the recipe and grilled them and they were so good!!  Will definately make again.  Soon!!

We made this exactly as written and it was really, really good.  The only thing holding back a 5 was it was still just a bit bland.  It's definitely a keeper though, so next time I'll just have to throw a little more seasoning on the exterior of the chop. Maybe those suggestions about browning in bacon fat first are the way to go.  Whatever I do next time, there will be a next time!  These were excellent paired with parmesan pasta and asparagus with basalmic butter sauce (recipe from this site).  Yum!

I have been wanting to try these for awhile and finally had the time to grill!  I thought they were pretty good, but when I make them again, I will not add any extra salt.  Salty enough as is without sprinkling it on top.

I thought this was ok. As I was reading reviews someone made a sauce for on top with the juices from cooking this in the pan and not on the grill.  I think I will try that.  The idea sounded so yummy but I wasn't near as impressed with this as I thought I would be although this recipe is worth playing around with.

Made this for Father's Day using two pork tenderloins instead and oven baked after browning them in the bacon fat.  

FANTASTIC recipe.  

I passed it along to my son's teacher along with some other favourite recipes as a Thank You for the end of the year.

Fantastic! First time I made them, I didn't have a grill so tried to cook in the skillet and was kind of a pain.  This time I used the grill and huge, fat boneless chops...heaven!..the cheese and bacon are great!

These were just all right for me.  I think it was a bit too rich for my family's taste, but it was definitely full of flavor and would be a good dinner for a crisp fall evening.

After all the rave reviews I was a little disappointed.  I did use very good Gouda.  I added some diced aplle as a couple of other reviewers suggested.  I did not add anymore salt because I felt the bacon and cheese would be salty enough, and it was.  But really, this was just OK.  I probably won't make it again.

A+++ This was a GREAT dinner!!  Instead of gouda I used pepper jack and I also added some onion to the bacon and cheese mixture.  I read some of the other reviews and I too left out the salt.  After stuffing them I sprinkled some onion powder on each side along with the pepper.  The chops I had were HUGE so I needed to use wooden skewers (which I wet before inserting) instead of toothpicks to secure the pocket.  The cook time I guess varies because I had to cook them about 12 minutes on each side. Definitely will be making these again!!

I made a couple of adjustments to this recipe. I added oregano, crumbled bread, and 4 tbs butter to the stuffing mix. I also just folded over the chops instead of trying to cut an opening in them.  The stuffing was similar to the stuffing they put in the stuffed mushrooms at Olive Garden. My family loved it!

Just made this for dinner. My husband and I loved it. I used pork chops that were a bit thinner, but would try thicker next time. This was so delicious and very easy to put together. I paired it with Easy Grilled Potatoes from this site. Perfection!

Wow!  These were some excellent chops and incredibly easy!  I seared mine in a pan then baked them (Didn't have charcoal). I also had a good bit of cheese left & I put it on top of the chops & broiled them after baking.  My husband told me I need to make them again soon.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. Thought the smoked gouda overpower the pork loin chops. Wouldn't make this again.

This was very good. I used butterflied boneless pork chops and stuffed the mixture on one side, folded over and secured with 4 toothpicks each. The filling did not leak out at all. I used a smoked cheese and I think that is essential, but doesn't really matter what kind of smoked. Give this recipe a try. You won't be disappointed.

This one is a keeper.  I used more bacon than it called for, we like bacon:)  Grilled on charcoal and it gave it wonderful flavor. Even my 3 year old loved it.  I did soak the toothpicks for a couple of hours to help prevent them from burning.  It seemed to have worked.  Will for sure make again.

This was really good.  They did seem a little undercooked, but we had huge pork chops... but I would try to cook them longer next time.  The gouda-bacon-parsley combo though was fantastic... my husband thought it was restaurant-quality.

I followed other reviewers and flattened the chops somewhat before wrapping them around the stuffing. Husband loved these, but they were a bit too dry for me; will work on making them more moist or adding a sauce (or perhaps a saucy side?). Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor was incredible!  This was the first stuffed pork chop recipe, and maybe my last!  I followed the recipe exactly and grilled them on my charcoal grill.  I used the technique for cutting a pocket in the pork chops I found in an old Cook's Illustarted magazine and it kept most of the filling in and only required 1 toothpick per pork chop.  Can't wait to make it again!!!

As a "new" cook, I love to experiment and this was my first time cooking pork chops. I made it for my parents and we all absolutely loved it! I substituted cilantro for the parsley, and it felt so gourmet. Served with salad and rosemary redskin potatoes. Will definitely make this again, maybe next time for my in-laws!

This was one of my favorites, simple but impressive. I did make it in the oven to save a few calories I did not fry it first. It took about 2o minutes.

I was on a fasting diet, so I needed something with not much effort to make for my husband.  This was sooo easy and quick, the grilling time was perfect, and my husband thought they were some of the best pork chops he's ever had.  I didn't change a thing.  I'll definitely make these again when I can eat them.

These were good. My husband loved these alot. I don't have an outdoor grill just a George Foreman. So I sauteed them in a fry pan. They took a loooong time to cook, over 10 mins per side. we took them off when we got sick of waiting for them to cook & they were still a little pink.  I think an easier way to do this is to bake regular pork chops in the oven & when they are almost done add the cheese mixture on top & cook them until it melts. Thanks Darla.

I was actually disappointed in this because it didn't have as rich a taste as I'd like.  I guess I don't like gouda as much as I'd thought.

Great combo of flavors.  My chops were too thin, so I pounded them out and rolled the mixture - then breaded with egg and bread crumbs.  Same concept, just assembled differently!  I like the thyme addition as well.

Husband liked it, but I thouhgt it was just OK for the effort.  I was expecting more flavor -- more of a kick, maybe.  Not bad, but not great. I doubt we'll make this again. Unless we add some other herbs/spices to kick  it up a bit.

Extremely easy and the flavor is wonderful. A great recipe which I have already passed on to friends. When something is this good, you just have to share - thanks

The flavor of these pork chops was great, and they were very easy to make. Great presentation and would be a nice dish to entertain with. Had to make an adjustment on the cooking time to get them cooked all the way through, and they came out a little dry though. Will definitely play with the recipe and try it again.

I had chops cut specifically for this recipe, and couldn't get them to finish on the grill.  I think they ended up being on the grill for almost an hour.

SO GOOD ... as long as you are okay with the attack on your arteries.  This is really rich.  I'm not a big pork fan, but this was a great way to spice that flavor up.  The only trick is stuffing and getting them to stay together correctly.  I had to use a few toothpicks in each.

This is a fabulous recipe.  The only cheese I had was farmers cheese so I added some smokey cumin to the mix and it was great.  Even my super picky husband ate it.  We will be making this again and again!!!

This was fantastic and very easy! We used bone in pork chops and the soft bacon bits instead of real bacon and it was delicious.  I think it could use some kind of sauce or gravy, but other than that...perfect.  Definitely a "keeper".

WOW!! These chops are OUTSTANDING! The smoked gouda cheese gives a great flavor. I had to use more than one toothpick to keep it closed. I broiled them, but will try grilling next time. My husband really enjoyed these!

This was a very beautiful looking dish and tasted good. I made dressing to go with it. I was worried that the pork chops  wouldn't be done enough, so after broiling in the oven I turned it to bake at 350 for 10 minutes.  My husband usually doesn't like pork that much, and he ate it up with no complaints.  I would make it again.

The taste depends a lot on the cut of meat.

Well, I messed around with the recipe and it wasn't wonderful, but it was very tasty, even with my goof.  I used thin sliced pork chops, layered the cheese mixture over then added another thin sliced chop, secured with toothpicks.  It was very tasty although all the cheese gooed out.  Will definitely be making it (the right way!!) again!  THanks.

This receipe was great. Grilling the pork chops gave an excellent flavor to the meat. But, I would add either some cream cheese or sour cream the next time I make it. The Gouda was a little dry.

Excellent!!! Did not change a thing. It does not need a change; great the way it is. My husband and I are doing
low carb and I am always looking for recipes that fit our
diet. This is a great addition to our meal plan. 
Try it, you want be disapointed.
