I made this salad based on how good it sounded and am glad I did. I wound up adding a little bit of sugar and lemon to the dressing, and threw in some bleu cheese (and chicken for my Dad) at the end, but overall I thought this was very good. I wasn't quite sure how the salad was supposed to look so I made it sliced per the description, took a photo, then chopped up the rest and made it like a regular Waldorf. See both photos and make it your own way! Either way, this was a good salad, and more filling than you would think.

I like this recipe! Its much healthier and lighter than the traditional Waldorf Salad. I used  fresh spinach and kale instead of lettuce which was meatier and a bit more filling.
