Although I like the base recipe, it needs improvement.  I added caraway seeds (love them in sauerkraut and Dr. Oz says they help reduce bloating, in case you get that).  I  used Kraft's 1000 island dressing and it just doesn't have enough twang.  Next time I make this  I  will add sauteed onions and perhaps a few shakes of hot sauce.  I used 1/3 pound deli corned beef, about 1 cup of rinsed &  drained sauerkraut because I love the stuff (Libby's), and everything else was unchanged.  Will try this again and let you know how  it is with changes.

I halved the thousand island dressing and still it's flavor was overpowering.  May attempt this one again and omit it all together.

We thought this was good! I really prefer the dips that you mix everything together b/c I feel the flavors are better distributed that way, but this was nice too. Thanks for sharing. ;)

The only thing that I changed was in the preparation of the final product, I added my cheese on top instead of mixing it.
