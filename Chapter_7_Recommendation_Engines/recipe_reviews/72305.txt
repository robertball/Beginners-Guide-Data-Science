Very sharp tasting drink. It's got an edge. Not sure it's one of my favorites, but it's not as sweet as some of the others I've tried. I think it might be just a little better with a little lime squeezed in, just for a little tartness.

This is basically a rye and ginger with grenadine.    In this Canadian's mind, this is no more creative than suggesting that coke and rum would make a good cocktail.

I doubled the recipe because I had just enough whiskey left in a bottle. I also served the drink as mixed shots to my roommates. At first they said it tasted slightly like cough syrup, the mixture of alcohol and grenadine, but then I squeezed in half a lime and it completely changed the taste. Delicious!
