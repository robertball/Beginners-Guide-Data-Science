I liked the idea of this. But I did change it a bit. Instead of using spaghetti sauce from a jar, I made my own with meat. I also used both Parmesan and Romano cheeses because that's what my husband likes. Instead of cottage cheese I used ricotta cheese. I didn't see the point of using eggs at all so I skipped them.  I liked that it was baked. It really brings out the flavor throughout the entire dish.

I am still trying to figure out why people rate a recipe they haven't tried or have tried and rate it low when they change the recipe.  That is considered a new recipe, which they should submit.  This is delicious as is.  It freezes well and is a great dish to use when cooking for others who can keep it frozen until they want to use it.

I used the ricotta cheese based on pooter61's recommendation and this turned out deliciously.

Great, simple recipe. Used with whole wheat pasta. The addition of the egg mixture made the noodles extra rich. Will use again.

I think the picture just doesn't do this recipe justice. I found this recipe the same day I was having family over and desperately searching for a quick, easy recipe. This recipe was perfect. I had a tough crowd and they're pretty opinionated, but everyone LOVED it!!! It was truly delicious. I did make a few minor adjustments. I added 1/4 cup of italian parsley (regular parsley would be great too). I used 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce (the other 1/2 can be used later for a toasted ravioli dinner). And instead of 4 cups mozzarella, I did 2 cups mozzarella and 2 cups italian blend. Based on the picture in this recipe, I was concerned there may be too much cheese and it may taste or look greasy. Not at all. Try it for yourself! :-)

Oh - and I don't like cottage cheese myself, but I DID keep it in the recipe. I couldn't taste it and I think it's important to keep in the recipe.

I would like to try to make this again. I didn't have any cottage cheese, but I did have ricotta so I used that instead (just as I would in lasagna), but my family and I just did not enjoy this. An entire pound of spaghetti noodles was too much, and there wasn't enough of the meat sauce to suit our tastes, so it just seemed like we were eating noodles baked with lots of cheese and a little bit of meat sauce. It didn't have much flavor. Next time I will definitely try it with the cottage cheese, but I think I will also decrease the amount of noodles and add a little extra sauce.

The first time I had this I fell in love with it. I could not get the recipe from the person who made it. Now, a year later, I found this recipe and LOVE it!!! My family loves it too. It certainly isn't health food but it takes the crown for comfort food.

It is delicious. The eggs, cheese and butter with the noodles is a must do, really ups the ante on the whole recipe. "I didn't see the point of using eggs at all" totally jacks up the recipe...do it as written, it is splendid.

My family really liked this recipe. The only thing I changed was subbing sour cream for ricotta or cottage cheese since I cant stand either. When it cooks the sour cream kinda takes on the same texture.

This baked spaghetti is cheesy and delicious! I have made it numerous times and it is always a hit.  The butter, parmesan, and eggs add a nice texture and rich flavor to the noodles. The layers somewhat resemble lasagna.  I have noticed a lot of reviews that suggested changing the recipe, so I wanted to mention that if you follow the recipe exactly, it turns out amazing.  Sometimes if I have other ingredients on hand, I do switch up the cheese or omit the cottage cheese, use sausage instead of hamburger, etc., but if I’m making for a crowd I follow the recipe and it is always GONE!

I followed the recipe (even the egg mix - I was curious about that & also added a little ricotta). I left out the cottage cheese, and made all the changes as Pooter61 recommended. The ricotta is a great addition! Came out fantastic!!! This will be one of my fav dishes I'll be making over & over. Thanks!

This was really delicious.  My boyfriend loves traditional spaghetti, and I'm not a huge fan of it, so I gave this a try.  We both loved it, and so did my teenage son!  I actually cut back a little on the cheese, instead of four cups of mozzarella, I used two cups of mozzarella and about a cup of an Italian cheese blend, because that's what I had on hand.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This is a great recipe for pot lucks. I used Ricotta cheese, but I think I'll try the cottage cheese next time.  My only problem was that I feel the extra 20 minutes for the cheese to melt is too much and made it a little too brown.  Next time I'll just take the foil off earlier.

Lots of raves when I made this for a dinner party this weekend. Made a few edits: no meat, added sauteed bell peppers and mushrooms, replaced seasoned salt with italian seasonings, garlic and onion powder, and a small amount of crushed red pepper, added fresh grated romano with the parmesan cheese and split the mozzarella cheese with italian blend cheese. Also replaced cottage cheese with ricotta. Base was great to work with and will definitely make again. Thanks!

My wife made this last night and the only variation she made was using sour cream instead of cottage cheese because we didn't have any and she used sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella. This is so delicious and so rich that I tried to eat more than my stomach could handle. I told her she was definitely going to have to make this again and I might even make it for our pot luck food day at work next month. I'm actually having the leftovers for dinner tonight.

This was Sooooo good! Step #4 is what makes it a five star recipe. I'm going to make it again & play with it a bit-use up some left over chicken, a few black olives & some chopped up artichoke hearts. Great recipe! Thank you!

Simple to make, tasty, and my husband loved this. I used sour cream instead of cottage cheese and cut the onion down to only a third. The bottom got a little set and harder to cut in some places though. Oh well, it was still good, just a bit dry overall. I'd add quite a bit more sauce the next time I fix this. Thanks Calliko.

NOTE: I am reviewing the original recipe; not a modified version.  Hubby and I enjoyed this baked dish. We made it according to the recipe and it did not need anything additional as is. I am giving it 5-stars because it's easy to put together, it uses readily available ingredients, it is easy to modify, and it tastes good.

This is an easy, quick fun recipe!  And, most importantly, delicious!  A lot of people have used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, creating a somewhat improvised lasagna dish.  I love cottage cheese, but to make it somewhat more incorporated into the dish, I mixed the cottage cheese in with the egg, butter, pasta mix (step 4).  I then limited the cheese layers to "harder" cheeses only (mozzarella, cheddar, and parmesan all work nicely).  Also, be prepared to use extra sauce!

Made this several times. Last version has been best so far. Used half cottage cheese and half ricotta cheese, dash of parsley, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 1 egg, and Kerrygold garlic herb butter instead of regular butter. Everything the same.

I made this for my family and we LOVED it, including my picky 2 year old. I substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese, following some other suggestions, and it was delicious. It tasted like an easy spaghetti lasagna. I baked it in a stoneware dish, which crisped the edges (yum). It's great leftover and makes a large amount; however, it is not great frozen and reheated - very dry when reheated. I would not recommend freezing this one.

I've made this many times for my family, and everyone loves it.  I leave out the cottage cheese, and it's a winner.  My 15 month old is allergic to eggs so I have also been leaving out the eggs and just adding a bit more cheese as an extra binder.

We made a few minor changes but feel we were true to the recipe. We added two cloves of chopped garlic in with the meat and onion. We only had fettucini, so we used that instead of spaghetti. We "bolstered" the cottage cheese with some garlic powder and chopped fresh oregano. 
We mixed the cooked pasta into the cheese mixture and tossed it thoroughly. Our layers then were (from bottom up) pasta/cheese mixture, sauce/meat mixture and the mozzarella. Repeat. Everyone liked it a lot and asked to have it again soon.

Very easy. I made a spaghetti sauce from scratch instead of using a jarred sauce and added a lot of chopped vegetables. The boys ate almost all of it, leaving out a small bowl for someone's lunch tomorrow.

This recipe was awesome!! My family loved it!We had for dinner and leftovers. I have gotten baked spaghetti from an Italian fast food restaurant, thought I loved it, until now. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this recipe! I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I didn't follow directions and mixed it in with the egg mixture, no worries. It came so good and cheesy!

No lie---EVERYONE loved this at a family gathering.  You could hear them all going "Yum..this is soo good.".  "Why is it soo good?".  "It's smooth and yummy.".  
So don't hesitate to make this for a group.  Make it just as stated.  Easy to transport and heat it up at someone else's house.

Came out awesome!! Used Italian sausage and seasoned it separately  and I also sweetened my spaghetti sauce. Used 45oz jar so it would be enough sauce. Was scared to use cottage cheese as I prefer ricotta but it was great and I'm glad I tried.

I have made this recipe exactly as written and it's always a big hit. That said,  I sometimes change the recipe because of what I have on hand. Tonight I didn't have cottage or mozzarella cheese, so I omitted the cottage cheese and used a shredded Italian blend. It was so very good.

My family and I loved this dish. It is very similar to lasagna so I really had no doubts my family would eat it. And I had almost everything on hand! This is now my weekday go-to Lasagna recipe. Thanks for sharing it! The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is I think it is a little too bland. Next time I am going to use more seasoning when cooking the hamburger and add more sauce as it was a little dry for my family's tastes.

I was concerned it might come out dry, so I wrapped the foil real tight, then cooked it ten minutes longer with foil. Then, I turn the oven on broil and put the dish on the highest rung just long enough to brown the cheese.  It worked well. Also used Pooter60's suggestion for the ricotta cheese. Turned out great!

This recipe is awesome! I didn't even use an onion, just the powder and used ricotta cheese...because I love the stuff! This is an easy, great tasting recipe, sure to please everyone!! Thanks so much for sharing! Next time I will try the cottage cheese (not low fat, but the real deal)!!

Great recipe.  The family loved it!  I made the mistake of only buying one bag of grated cheese. (2 cups) and then was so distracted while cooking it that I forgot to add it to the layers. Just put it on top.  Used a 45 oz jar of sauce because it was on sale. It came out perfect.   Will make it again !

Great recipe!  Made this exactly as written and it turned out great.  The butter mixed into the pasta was wonderful!  Next time I'll jazz it up with some italian sausage and ricotta cheese in place of the ground beef and cottage cheese.  This is a keeper!

Wow oh wow! I asked my daughter to make this yesterday while I was at work. She relates that she followed the recipe exactly, and wow oh wow! This recipe is so amazingly good. Everyone at the dinner table loved it. Even though it has similar ingredients to lasagna, it's not spicy or "wet" like lasagna or spaghetti with meat sauce, but it's not dry either. The texture is perfect: creamy but not too rich. This is definitely a keeper. There were four of us at the table but we consumed only about 1/3 of the pan. So I figure it feeds about 12 people. Delicious.

Everyone loved this dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written and served it with extra marinara which my family loved. We like lots of marinara and it would have been too dry without some on the side. The taste was delicious!

The recipe looked good and easy so I decided to give it a try. It was DELICIOUS!!!  I made enough sauce for two casseroles. I'm going to make the second casserole this weekend. It was really easy to put together. We had guests over who are not big eaters and they even asked for a second helping.

I agree completely with BRUMAR11 and others who reviewed yesterday and before.  I made this baked spaghetti last night and we all considered it a delightful meal. Followed the recipe as written and rated it AS WRITTEN.  If I choose to alter it when I make it again I will review it as a new and different recipe.  Thanks for sharing this one.

First time making this and was very good! My son also liked it. You just have to eat it in small portions, it's so thick!  increased the recipe enough to put some away for a quick dinner in the future.  No changes but who knows if I make it again!

This was incredibly easy to make; not to mention cost effective also. I might use a few less spaghetti noodles next time, but that is just my preference. Thanks for such a good recipe!

Made this for my daughter, her hubby and two young toddlers - doubling the recipe for a separate casserole for my husband...Daughter and  fam loved it, as did myself and husband.   Definitely a keeper in my recipe file as a Grammy!  Didn't change/adapt the recipe much,  just extra cheese, which I always do with Italian dishes.  YUMMY!

Really good - I didn't add ricotta because I didn't have any but will definitely add it next time.  I also used frozen meatballs, just added them to the sauce while the spaghetti noodles were boiling.  My husband is looking forward to leftovers tomorrow night!

Whenever I have homemade spaghetti meat sauce leftover I freeze and use to make this baked spaghetti. This recipe has the creamy consistency that I like and is hubby approved too. I have also made with sour cream when I am out of cottage cheese and is just as good.

First time making baked spaghetti. Really liked how simple this recipe was. It came out very delicious. I added sausage to the sauce which was a nice addition. The mixture you add to the noodles was genius. You can taste everything you put into it and very cheesy. Definitely gonna save this recipe

Listen, DON'T CHANGE A THING WITH THIS RECIPE! Over 3K made this dish and over 700 likes means it's good as it is. I made this for a young lady's baby shower and it was a hit. One girl had some of the leftovers and said she wished she had tasted it when it was fresh because the leftovers were good.

This will be a frequent favorite! I did not make any changes to the recipe, (although it took a bit longer for the total cooking time after I let the cheese all get good and toasty!) I did serve it with additional sauce on the side, which everyone opted to use in varying degrees after trying it without the extra sauce first. The flavor was very good and it wasn't actually dry, but the additional sauce did make a difference in the taste and texture. I would not add extra sauce as I don't believe it would hold up and cut as nice if it was incorporated into the recipe. My favorite thing was that I made it in the morning and didn't cook it until evening. All the prep had been done and the dishes were clean, so I only had to throw it in the oven, enjoy my company, and occasionally check on it.  Much cheaper than lasagna, but you get a lot of the same flavor and "ambiance."  This is definitely going to be a favorite! I may try adding Italian sausage (1/2 and 1/2) next time, but there were no leftovers with only 5 people!

This recipe is amazing! The first time i made it  , i made ot exactly by recipe and i personally was a big fan along with my 8 year old. 

My husband had suggested next time i make it to add green pepper and i thought instead of ground beef , let me add italian sausage ground ( i chose sweet flavored so my kid didn't taste any spices) and both them added made for an amazing great taste. 

Niether time did i use cottage cheese. 

I hope you ans you family enjoy this meal as much as mine does

Family LOVED it!
I personally prefer penne instead of spaghetti & ricotta instead of cottage cheese so that's what I used but I have no doubt that using the original ingredients would also warrant 5 stars.

delicious. i used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. didn't use onion, but added garlic powder while browning the ground beef. be sure to add some crushed red pepper to the sauce to give it some heat. great recipe.

Pretty good as is but wasn't a fan of the cottage cheese, would have rather used ricotta. In the future I'll make the ricotta egg mixture from the world's best lasagna recipe in place of the cottage cheese. My favorite part is the egg mixed noodles, made it really hearty and not like spaghetti at all which I was worried about.

I’ve made this 4 times and my family loves it!  Even on busy nights before i start running around, I’ll cook it for 30 minutes, then put it in the warmer on low for a couple hours- kids can pull it out and eat when they need to if we aren’t all home to eat together. (And it doesn’t dry out).   I definitely use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese!

This is my favorite go to meal!! It is worth the time and effort! I make my own sauce, but that's the only difference! Has anyone made and frozen this meal? If so I'd love to know how you did so! I would like to make a double batch and freeze one, but don't know how to go about that!

This is a really easy recipe and my family loves it! Two bonuses in my book. I used 1.5 lbs ground turkey and 1/2 lb sweet Italian  sausage. I used 3 eggs and mixed the ricotta (instead of cottage cheese) in with the egg mixture then tossed the noodles in the egg/ricotta mixture. This is so much easier for me than to try layering the ricotta. Also saves time. This will fit in a large casserole or I have also made this and used 3 pans- 8x8 in size and gave one away.  This recipe is a keeper!

We love this recipe. I’ve made it many times and taken it to many events. It’s always a hit! Once I tried ricotta but it didn’t change it enough to make a difference so I have continued with cottage cheese. I’ve also used gluten free noodles and it’s worked very well. It’s now a standard at least every two weeks!

Came out sooooo good! I will definitely be making this for me and my husband on the regular. I didn’t have ricotta or cottage cheese so I used sour cream instead, and it still came out great! The sour cream takes on the consistency of ricotta when finished. Husband loved it!

No eggs due to an allergy. Buttered 2 pieces of bread and sprinkled with garlic powder. Torn into pieces and covered the top. Turned out great and it stayed together well.

I did make this and while I am a person who always changes recipes to suit my husband and I, on this one I pretty much stuck to the recipe. I rate it as excellent. I did add mushrooms because I really like them in spaghetti sauce.  I would likely have a bit of additional sauce on hand as after warming it as a leftover, it did need a bit of extra sauce.

It is a good base recipe but needs lots more flavor for my family.  I added:

2 tsp. minced garlic, 
2 tsp of salt, (I subtracted the seasoning salt)
1/2 tsp pepper, 
1 tsp of sugar,  
basil to taste, 
tomato paste, 
wine to taste (1/4-1/2 cup)
2 tsp of Worcestershire.   

It makes a lot, so use your deepest 9x13 pan.

I've made this recipe a couple times,  both as written and modified. As written, I don't believe the pasta to sauce ratio is quite right. I prefer a bit more sauce. And I'm not a big fan of the seasoned salt. Overall though, it's tasty and satisfying. If you like to play with recipes, this is a good one to do it with. Change up the seasonings in the sauce. Bulk it up with vegetables or cut out the meat altogether. Play with the cheeses. For example, I added mushrooms to bulk up the veggie content. I used my own combination of spices including Italian seasoning, garlic and red pepper flakes. I didn't have mozzarella, but sharp cheddar worked wonderfully. One tip though: when mixing the noodles with the egg mixture, make sure the pasta cools a bit first or the egg will cook before it fully coats the noodles.

Tasty and flexible recipe, very satisfying and straightforward. The egg step seemed odd, but it came out great. I added minced garlic towards the end of the browning meat/onion step, too.
It's kind of a poor man's lasagna, which is NOT a knock against it.

Yummy almost as-is...We only had a Mexican cheese blend on hand so that's what I used.  Delicious!  And even better as a left-over the next day!

I made the recipe as directed.   Very easy to make.  On eating it and sharing with my neighbor, both of us agreed that it tasted  'flat', no flavor due to no added spices.   As I am a cook who needs recipes to follow, I would make again if there were added spices.  ( Am not sure of what to add or how much).  I would make again if the recipe were updated.  
Otherwise, I cannot recommend as is.
Thank you.

I made this recipe for about 48 people. Everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed was the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese. The meatless spaghetti sauce of my choice is Emerils marinara sauce. The eggs,butter and Parmesan cheese makes this recipe great!! Absolutely wonderful,loved it!!!

Very good recipe. Rather time consuming though. I added four chopped mushrooms and used turkey meat instead of ground beef and it still turned out great! I also lowered the butter to 3 1/2 Tbs instead of 5. Next time I might lower the cheese slightly... It was very good just not healthy! Overall great recipe I will definitely make it again.

Didn't change a thing, made exactly as listed and it turned out great. Tastes very similar to a lasagna so I won't make it within the week of lasagna rotation but adults and my teenage son enjoyed!

I made this for the first time last night and WOW, my family devoured it.  Even my pickier eater cleaned her plate!  They have asked this to be put into our regular menu, and I am happy to oblige.  The only thing I deviated on was substituting ricotta for the cottage cheese, everything else was as written.  So creamy and flavorful, great comfort food!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this for years except instead of cottage cheese, which makes it more like a lasagna, I use a 16 oz container of sour cream in that layer. Very tasty!

This was a nice change from regular lasagna, and easier to put together.  Followed the instructions as is except I substituted Johnsonville ground italian sausage for the ground beef. The entire household enjoyed dinner tonight with some garlic bread and a nice salad.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and I wouldn't alter one ingredient.   It was an instant hit with my family.  My husband actually got thirds.  Seconds simply wasn't enough.  I intend to make this delicious recipe again and again.  P.S.  When layering the ingredients, make sure the mozzarella cheese is last.

I made half of the recipe and put it in the fridge overnight. Don't over cook the pasta. I didn't have enough cottage cheese so I used sour cream (3/1 ratio) to meet the recipe requirements. Only one layer and the last layer was the mozzarella cheese. YUMMY!

I only changed the cottage cheese to ricotta cheese and used 1 1/2 bottle of spaghetti sauce, all else the same (including eggs). My husband loved it. He had to make himself stop eating it. One kid really liked it, the other only ate the cheese topping (the picky eater). I tasted it and it was really good! I couldn't eat it due to the Weight Watchers but the taste was awesome!

I made this exactly as written, except I used a little extra sauce.  It was delicious!  It reminds me a lot of lasagna, but even better! My family loved it and it will be a regular in our rotation!

This is really good - I LOVE recipes that use cottage cheese because it's so healthy for you, and in a pasta casserole, it's virtually always undetectable except for a little creaminess. I loved the egg/parm/butter layer too but it's too rich and the butter makes me feel guilty (though I just remind myself that it's 5 tablespoons spread over so many servings. Might cut back to 1/4 cup next time). Also had a heart attack when mixing the spaghetti into it - it was hot and I was scared it would scramble the eggs, but it seemed to have turned out ok. Forgot to undercook the pasta so it got a little mushier from the sauce and also threw down a layer of meat sauce as others did on top of the first layer of spaghetti.  Really super comforting dish - what sooky said is completely on target 'It certainly isn't health food but it takes the crown for comfort food.' Takes a while to make.

Great, cheesy, delicious, easy, homey dinner! PLEASE, *carefully* read this recipe!! A lot of people seem to be misreading the amount of sauce called for in this recipe. A 32 oz jar of sauce is the BIG one, equivalent to TWO regular jars. If you use one regular jar by not carefully paying attention to the size called for, then yep! Your pasta will be dry!! But don't rate this recipe down for your reading comprehension...this really does call for the right proportion of ingredients that can be altered to taste. I use gluten free rice spaghetti and have no issues with it using this recipe. I make two pans for our two adult household and freeze one for later-YUM!!!

Wow so good!  I decided to use up some ingredients in my refrigerator like olives, mushrooms, and pepperoni by adding to the dish.  It was awesome - you can basically add any pizza type of toppings to the sauce and customize it.  This one is a keeper

This was marvelous. I did toss some dried herbs (basil, rosemary, parsley) with the egg/butter/Parmesan/pasta mixture. Don't skip the eggs -- they really do make this a 5-star dish. Oh yes, and I added diced green peppers and mushrooms to the spaghetti sauce, like I always do. Yummy!

This has now become a family favorite.  I have made a couple changes for personal taste.  I use spicy sausage instead of ground beef and add more sauce.  I usually make my own sauce but either way works great.  Be sure to do the eggs, Parmesan cheese, and butter with your noodles, it really makes the recipe.  My family thinks the left overs are better than the first night but I don't agree. Add a fresh salad and garlic bread and it is a wonderful meal.

Made this today. My boyfriend and I loved it. Made a couple variations: used 2 jars of Bertolli (best spaghetti sauce ever) instead of just one, but we like it a little bit saucier so it worked out well. We also used whole wheat pasta, I added some Italian seasoning along with garlic and onion powder and just a little bit of ground red pepper for spice and it turned out amazing! Next time I make this, I think I may take some readers suggestions and try the ricotta cheese and compare the difference. This recipe is definitely a keeper in our house.

I also made the changes pooter61 suggested and use ricotta in place of cottage cheese. What I did differently was I used 2 jars of sauce instead of one. My husband likes things more on the saucy side. I did have to place the pan on a baking sheet and it bubbled over a little. The pasta absorbed a lot of the sauce and the left overs aren't as dry. My husband said it is his new favorite meal, he loved it as did I! I will definitely make this over and over again.

This was a hit at my husband's birthday lunch! Doubled the recipe. Added some diced tomatoes and mushrooms to the ground beef.  Used less butter too.  Served it with garlic bread.  Will definitely make this again and try ricotta cheese too. Not really healthy but definitely comfort food.

Tried it today and it was awesome!! I did not have all the ingredients (Cottage cheese) and I did not add the seasoned salt. I used both Mozzarella and colby-jack shredded cheese and used Romano in the butter and egg mixture rather than parmesan, beacuse that is what I had on hand. I also sauteed mushrooms and red bell pepper in butter then added it to the Italian sausage and leek mixture.

This was a awesome recipe, I did make some changes to fit my familys style. I added mushrooms an olives to the meat sause, also used Ziti pasta instead of spaghetti noodles. I did not have a the full 2 cups of cottage cheese so use sour cream an cottage cheese mix. My family did not notice the differance. I will be making this again.

This recipe was great!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and probably a little less butter.  I also used some stewed tomatoes along with my jar of sauce and added a bit more seasoning to it.  Definitely a recipe I was use again.

I have to preface this and say that I’m a farmer hand and love recipes that feed the army.  This is one that works!  I made a recipe and a half and was out of grated mozzarella so I subbed some strips of string cheese and used some Costco mixed grated cheese.  Turned out great!  The guys loved it and so did I.  Easy to assemble and throw in the oven. I should say that I personally like baked noodles over something just cooked with sauce poured over.

Absolutely yummy! It's not that meaty, so I add more meat for my carnivore husband. It ends up being heaping in the baking dish, but it tastes perfect!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese because that’s what I had on hand, and I really didn’t want to go to the store. Next time I will use the cottage cheese because the ricotta was difficult to spread evenly on each layer. I did everything else exactly as written, and this was just ooey, gooey, cheesy goodness. It was perfect for a cold winter night. Thank you so much for sharing, and I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious. Added 2 teaspoons chopped garlic to the spaghetti sauce and one jar mushrooms. Used about half spaghetti. Makes lots. Will make again.

This is a recipe everyone in my family loves!  It is a great dish to make ahead and freeze/refrigerate for later use.  I never use the full amount of shredded mozzarella called for as 2 cups is sufficient for us.

Really good. I used broad egg noodles instead and added chopped celery and peppers to the meat and onions before adding the sauce. I used a mix of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream just to use up some partially used containers. A good, hearty, homey meal. i served with a simple spinach salad.

Before making some other All Recipes, I would always read the reviews and use many of the suggestion "to make the recipe better."  Well, after a total flop on a previous recipe, using suggested adjustments, I decided --no more-- I'm going to make it exactly the way it is written.  This recipe was DELICIOUS, so easy, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I was so pleased.  This recipe is a definite keeper--exactly as written.

This is one of 'my' {smiles} most requested recipes by family and friends.  I'm always asked to bring this to get-togethers.  IF there are left-overs ... they disappear quickly the next day.  This is great warmed up!   I've also made ahead, frozen and cooked the day of and it tastes FABULOUS!

I used 2 cans (24 oz) Hunt's 4 Cheese Pasta Sauce to replace jar of meatless spaghetti sauce, plus 1 pkg McCormick's Thick and Zesty Spaghetti Seasoning.  I did away with the "seasoned salt".  
This was an awesome hit for my family!  They said they don't EVER want traditional lasagna again!
The squares cut perfectly and held their shape when serving.  It was amazing!  The leftovers were enjoyed for days.  It just kept getting better and better as days passed.  There was even a little fight over who was getting the last serving in their lunch!

instead of cooking spray on the bottom of the dish, I melted sweet butter and put that down, then I laid a layer of the spaghetti mixture directly on the top of the melted butter and placed six slices of cheddar cheese before adding the rest of the mixture and putting mozzarella on the very top

The meat sauce is pretty basic, but I love the buttery noodles! I'd add some spices, and I did change from cottage cheese to ricotta, but it was not bad!

I made my own spaghetti sauce and used italian sausage instead of hamburger, also I didn’t have spaghetti so used half linguini and half fettuccini, also was low on mozzarella so used half mozzarella and half Monterey Jack. It turned out delicious!

This looked perfect out of the oven, and the whole family loved it. It is now our new favorite baked spaghetti. The egg mixture mixed into the noodles made it even better than we expected. Three teens and two parents didn’t come close to finishing it, so we have more for later. Win, win!

I made it as written and it was one of the best recipes I've ever tried.  My family LOVED IT! The only thing I did differently was break up the spaghetti into 3s before boiling.  I don't know if it was better or worse, but it was very easy to stir into  the egg/parmesan/butter mixture.  GREAT RECIPE!!

Wow this had a lovely flavor, and it made the house smell great!   Perfect for company because you can clean up all of the mess and then just bake the one pan.   

I did have to put a cookie sheet under my 13x9x2 pan because the bubbly-goodness tried to drop out a bit.

This is my "go to" recipe.  I make it at home for my family of course, however, anytime I want to send a meal to a friend in need, this is what I make.  Send it with a bottle of wine, a loaf of bread and a bag of salad, and it easily feeds a large gathering.  Also, it freezes like a dream, and it is so easy to cut a piece of any size, microwave and enjoy anytime. Easy to make, and everyone LOVES it.   The cottage cheese makes it so moist and lighter, than ricotta (in my opinion!)  Sauces generally come in 24 oz, and since this calls for 32 ounces, there's always a little left over from that second jar to add if needed at the end.  I generally go a little lighter on onion but will add some chopped green pepper in the sauce, but I'm not a big onion person.   Only change is that the recipe doesn't mention to save or add a bit more cheese on the top, but that's pretty obvious.  Cheese, parsley, I like a bit of dill, if you like some spice, sprinkle red pepper flakes, whatever. . . ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ! ! !

Oh, and I didn't have cream cheese or sour cream on hand and the recipe still was excellent!

Turned out great!! My husband definitely agrees!! No cottage cheese so I went with the ricotta I already had. Also only had 1/2 a package of spaghetti so it became “Spaguini” instead! Loved

This is really a great recipe. I looked at some reviews on what other comments did or did not do. Usually, I will follow a new recipe for the first time, just the way it is given. I did not change the recipe.  The recipe is really very accurate. I did add more cottage cheese, more sauce, and meat (ground turkey) because I did not want to throw anything away. Next time, I will see how it is with ricotta cheese. I will highly recommend this recipe and use it again. Follow the recipe to the "T". Also, this is a family sized meal. I even gave some away to my in laws. You will be full and fullfilled.

This is wonderful, and I’ve made it several times and my family loves it! Can’t do jar sauce though, always make homemade. We’re Keto now so tonight I’m making it with Keto friendly noodles. I’m sure it will be just as good though!

This was delicious. I'll probably make it a little different every time, but it was amazing and it will probably be good even with tweaks and adding whatever is in my pantry or fridge. We loved it and I have enough for leftovers. This tasted like something you'd get at Cheesecake Factory or Cheddars. Amazing!

I was in search of a recipe I'd made before and came across this one which is very similar. I tweaked it a bit based on ingredients I had on hand that I was trying to use up. I used chicken Italian sausage in place of the ground beef and added a few sliced mushrooms while sautéing the onion. I added 1/2 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp black pepper to the spaghetti/egg mixture. Finally, I sprinkled each layer of the cottage cheese with a parmesan/herb pizza topping mix. No problem with a bland dish as others described!

I like how easy this recipe is; however, I have a couple suggestions for changes: 1/2 stick of butter is enough to coat noodles in egg mixture, and most importantly this recipe needs less noodles and more sauce. Maybe even mix it into the noodles during the layering. The current recipe fills the whole pan, so adjust accordingly. Also, have fun with it- add olives, parsley, Italian sausage, or crushed red pepper to give it add to the flavor profile. Now I have to go figure out how to add more sauce to the pan I just made....

I made this at a recent family reunion and got many compliments about this recipe. This is also my go to recipe bc my husband loves this recipe. I didnt use Riccotta nor cottage cheese for this recipe and I still love it. It's really delicious! When baking, I wrap it with aluminum foil every time to keep it tender and moist

This was really good but I probably will cut down or omit the onions.  It also depends if course on what sauce you use!  Great recipe!

I had always wanted to make this dish, but I added sausage, where I cut it into poker chips, then added it with the beef and onion mix. It was amazing and delicious, my family absolutely loved this dish.

This was very good and I will make it again.  Here are my alterations.  I used 1 1/2 lb hamburger because one reviewer said 1lb was not enough....added garlic powder and oregano and added  a can of mushrooms to the sauce. After I assembled the casserole , I topped it with parmesan cheese.  Vert tasty.

I made the recipe exactly as it's written, and I just wasn't impressed. It was a lot of work for a mediocre and fairly bland pasta dish. Making regular spaghetti would've been easier and tastier.

This is a really yummy recipe!  The step of mixing the cooked pasta with the butter & egg mixture is crucial; don't skip it!  I only made the following (small) changes as per my tastes: I used pepperoni as my meat of choice, and I threw in about 4 cloves of garlic after sauteing the onions.  Truly a wonderful recipe I'll be keeping in my recipe box.  Thank you!

Spagsana - it's like lasagna, but spaghetti. I've made this recipe both as-is as well as with extra sauce and ricotta, and I would suggest adding more of both because the casserole can get a bit dry as a leftover. However, the taste is great either way. Long live spagsana!

I always have a gang of my teenager's friends in the house and I've been looking for meals that are easy to make (because I'm not a great cook) and will feed everyone.           I made this baked spaghetti last night and it was a HUGE success!!  Everyone loved it! I didn't change any of the ingredients and it came out perfect.  I even made a mistake and added the mozzarella in with the egg mixture and it still turned out great.  I'm sure I'll be making this meal a lot!! Thank you!!!

I needed to feed 50.  It was so easy to modify this recipe and the Baked Spaghetti came out wonderful delish!!  Many complements were given! I love getting everything into the baked dish then having time to get the kitchen all cleaned up while it bakes. I will be making this one at home also!

This was okay, but I found it a lot of work, for the result.  It was rather bland, though I did use a fairlyl mild spagetti sauce.  Needs a lot more spices for our taste.
   I wont make again.

I did everything exactly as it was written.  It was just ok.  I thought there was too much pasta and not enough sauce. My family thought the same.  I would recommend a little more than half the amount of pasta.  Then you could appreciate the other ingredients.  Perhaps add some mushrooms and peppers?  I thought the addition of the egg, butter and Parmesan to the cooked pasta was a great addition to the dish.

My family of 4 ate the entire 9x12 pan in one day.  Delish!! I wanted less carbs so I added more meat and topped with more cheese.

Made for my church's outreach ministry. Took a chance since this was my first time making it, and so glad I did!! It was a hit. Since I was also making Lasagna, I substituted the cottage cheese with sour cream and the mozzarella with Monterey jack cheese so the dishes could taste different. Awesome recipe  - will make again, and again, and again!!

Very good. Followed recipe to the T just added a few spices to meat while cooking like garlic and Italian herbs. Most people that say it's not saucey enough should notice most standard jars of spaghetti sauce are not 32oz like this recipe requires. So check your jar sizes. But very yummy. Thick. Creamy.Delicious.

I wanted to cut back on the amount of fat in this dish, so I only used about 2.5 cups of cheese total and only put cottage cheese on top of the first layer. It was still delicious and my family loved it. I will be keeping this recipe to use again.

Loved the meal.

Used only Mozzarella and  Cheddar cheeses, as I couldn't lay hands on any other at that time.

Will try getting the recommended cheeses and try it again.

Made it exactly as written and everyone loved it.  Although the next time I think I'll cut back a bit, maybe 3/4 of the box of spaghetti, to make room for more sauce.

This was a huge hit with my family.  It's very similar to the spaghetti pie I make - but makes way more and I have 4 teenagers that eat a lot.  The only change I made was I used the Hood Cottage Cheese with Chives - and it needed more than 2 cups to get the 2 full layers - I'd say 3 cups.  This would be a great make-ahead meal for a busy day!  Thank you!

Made this in 2018: We both really liked this dish. I subbed Italian sausage, and added finely chopped kale to the sauce, also a little red wine. I don't use mozz, so subbed a combination of cheddar and swiss to good effect. This is going to be great leftovers!  UPDATE 5/3/19: This time I used spaghetti squash and a very good quality jarred marinara, and used ricotta in place of the cottage, since that's what I had on hand. Results: I like the cottage cheese version better. This was a good side to marinated and grilled chicken breast, with salad.

My kids all loved this! I cut it with a heart-shaped cookie cutter for Valentine’s Day. I also stuck a Costco meatball in the middle of each. I made it without the ground beef, and I substituted sour cream for the cottage cheese, because that’s what I had. But I think it would be good as written too.

This recipe is fantastic. So much easier than lasagna or stuffed shells and packed full of flavor. Saw a review where someone said they didn't see the point in the egg mixture, but I couldn't disagree more. That's what takes it from good to great. Quadrupled this recipe and made it for a hospitality room at a high school basketball game. Served 40 people with leftovers. Ingredients cost me 49 bucks at WalMart. I used just a little more sauce, mozzarella and cottage cheese because I didn't want to throw out leftover ingredients and I figured extra sauce might keep it from drying too much in the warmer. It was perfect. I'd follow the recipe to a T if making it at home.

I think the cooking time was a little to long as the bottom layer of noodles are quite firm, otherwise a great recipe, I also added some cheddar cheese on top, personal preference.

First time making baked spaghetti...will definitely make again. Didn’t have an onion so used 4 garlic cloves for flavoring. Will try half sausage half beef next time.

This was a very simple and tasty recipe.  I did doctor up my meat sauce a little with some fresh garlic and some Italian seasoning.  Next time I would use a little more sauce but other than that it was perfect.  Of course as with almost all pasta dishes it was even better the next day.

Solid recipe. It's pretty much lasagna but with spaghetti noodles. It makes a lot, so I'd suggest halving it if you are making for 1-2 people.

AMAZING!! Terrific recipe! The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I made one change and only have one suggestion. Instead of using four bags of shredded mozzarella, i used 2 and a half and it did just fine. The only  problem I had was that the 9 x 13 baking dish was way too small! LOL suffice it to say I had to line the bottom of my oven to contain the quite delectable juices so as to save me an oven cleaning! So use a slightly larger pan  and make sure it’s deep enough! But what a recipe!  YUM!

I will definitely make this again. I would love to freeze some to save for later, but I feed my dad, husband, and two grown sons and there were no leftovers! They are hearty eaters so this was perfect as it makes a large amount. I added canned, sliced mushrooms along with the onion as I browned my ground beef. Everyone liked that modification. Next time I may also add sliced olives. It was delicious! Can't wait to make it for my next pot luck.

I made this recipe and another spaghetti bake to compare. This was my favorite but I agree you must make it as is. Don’t substitute anything. It is absolutely delicious using the original recipe.

My family loves this recipe. I make it at least two times per month. The only change I made was adding a little more butter and one additional egg. When I strictly followed the recipe, it didn’t seem like there was enough butter/egg/Parmesan mixture for a whole pound of spaghetti.

If made by recipe, a larger baking dish will be needed, filled my standard 13” x 9” to overflowing.  Thank goodness for self cleaning ovens.

5 stars! My fiancé isn’t big on spaghetti, but I made this recipe for him to have while I am out of town. He loved it! I browned the ground beef and used Lowrys Garlic salt and some Adobo seasoning. In another skillet, I browned some mushrooms and onions then, added it to the browned meat and tomato sauce. I did not measure out the shredded mozzarella... I just eye balled it. You can never have enough mozzarella! I was in a time crunch so I heated the oven to 420 degrees, cooked covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for 10. It still came out perfectly!

I did not use cottage cheese. I used reduced sodium Prego sauce. I used fiesta blend shredded cheese on the inner layer, then used fiesta blend and three cheddar blend shredded cheese on the top. DELICIOUS!

This was really easy to make. The  pasta was very tender, and I really liked the flavor. This recipe as written makes 8 servings which was way too much for us. I will half this next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

I added a bit more onion, some chopped bell pepper and garlic to the meat. Also some dry spaghetti seasoning to the meat maybe 1 Tbsp. Just helps out the flavor more. Great reviews, everyone wanted this recipe.

I didn't make this exact recipe but one from Taste of Home that is so close it seems identical.  I, however, only use half the spaghetti because that seems  plenty to me.  I also double the Parmesan.  This is so satisfying every one should try it once just to see how you feel about it.  Major comfort food in my book!

Over the past couple of months I have made this twice, AS WRITTEN. Once for my family, once for company (special occasion). Both times got rave reviews, and requests for the recipe from company. The kids loved it, (and they don’t like cottage cheese lol) the hubby loved it, so this went into my favorite category!! In fact I’m making it again this week. No NEED to alter it at all. (unless  you want to for variety).  5 stars from me because this pleased so many different kinds of people and palettes! ??

This is one of my favorite recipes! I like to add more eggs (usually about 5 total) because I really like the way it cooks with the noodles. Sometimes I add an additional can of plain tomato sauce to make sure I have enough, which I mix in with the spaghetti sauce and meat.  Overall its always a huge hit with my family!

This was good, but I really couldn’t tell the difference between this and a traditional spaghetti. Wouldn’t necessarily make again because it’s a lot of work for something that tastes the same. Not bad though.

I don’t like to write a review when I didn’t follow the recipe exactly. I only made changes because I didn’t have the exact ingredients that it called for! I made my one spaghetti sauce and I took the advice of another reviewer and alternated the cheese , sauce and spaghetti. I have made this several times now and it is always , always good. It makes a lot and it keeps well in the fridge. Definetly a keeper!!

I used this recipe to make 12 pans for the homeless ministry I volunteer with, and have made it several times since for my own family.  I prepare it exactly as written, and it's been a huge a hit!  Delicious.

Family liked it but they said regular spaghetti is just as good and 
is quicker to make.  I did make my own spaghetti sauce.   I liked
how it was a little different and it was not hard to make.  I'll probably make it again some time.

This was very good baked spaghetti. However, if I were to make it again, I think I would mix some spaghetti sauce in with the noodles/egg/cheese mixture and then put it in the pan. Putting the sauce on top made the flavor just a bit more bland, but I think if you either use more sauce or mix some sauce in the noodles, that would solve it.

I made this as the recipe suggested & the general consensus from all who ate it was that it needed either less spaghetti or more sauce. Personally I thought it needed more of the cottage cheese. It's a good starting place for the recipe, but I will make changes if I make it again.

It had NO FLAVOR. I had to add basil, oregano, and garlic into the meat sauce to even begin to add flavor (2 cloves of garlic, 2 ½ teaspoons of basil, 1 ½ teaspoons of oregano). I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, which tasted much better than the cottage cheese. Overall, I would make it again in my modified version, but I would never make it based on the recipe.

Instead of cottage cheese I used a combo 4oz cream cheese softened and 4oz sour cream and a mostly sharp cheddar and mozzarella mix shredded. Next time I'll add a few cloves of minced garlic into the butter egg parmesan mixture. Even better the next day! Thanks
Let me know how these changes work for you!.

Loved it!! I made it as directed except, I know, I used sour cream as a substitution to the cottage cheese because that is what I had on hand. I also omitted the 2 cups shredded cheese for layering because I only had 1 bag, but it wasn't missed I promise. The spaghetti was moist and not eggy or taste like sour cream. The cheese on top was very plenty. For those who made their own sauce, weren't you looking for something different than your favorite spaghetti dish? All the ingredients combined made a very good dish that to us didn't taste like a jarred sauce recipe. I will be making this again for sure!

5/5 Will make again! 
Made with elbows rather than spaghetti noodles, ricotta in place of cottage cheese. Awesome recipe, should use a touch more sauce.   Thanks!

Loved this recipe. My family loved it! The only suggestions I would make is to use more sauce. I actually used two jars and it could have used a little more. Other than that it will be a fave at my home!

Excellent!  Just added some mushrooms because I think they make all Italian dishes better and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Will definitely make again.

This was delicious! It was really easy to make but I did make a disaster of my kitchen while doing so. Lol. I made no changes to this recipe with the exception of baking time in the oven. I over cooked my noodles and I didn’t want them to turn to mush, so I popped it into the oven for 30 min without the foil. You could try and make changes to this recipe. I considered swapping ricotta for the cottage cheese but then decided against it. Just make this exactly as it’s written and you won’t be disappointed.

Wonderful! I’ve made a similar version in the past but this was amazing. Recipe was perfect as is (although I did use more cheese and fresh mozzarella pearls bc we can’t get enough cheese around here). Excellent recipe, will now be on our rotation!

I've made this a few times already and will be making it again tonight. Fam loves it.  The only thing I do differently is use Ricotta instead of Cottage cheese (I'm Italian, what can I say) because that's usually what I have on hand and what I prefer. Other than that, I follow the recipe. Tonight I may try it with Bucatini instead of regular spaghetti.

Great hearty dish.  The layering is similar to lasagne but the Parmesan/Butter/egg mixture that the spaghetti is tossed in gives this a special rich flavor.

We used ricotta cheese and only 3 cups of mozzarella. I'm a cheese freak, but 4 would've been too much, in my opinion. We loved it so much! If we didn't have to watch our middle age muffin tops, we'd have it every week. But, alas, 56 years old makes you a little more cautious of calories! We'll probably make this for family gatherings as it makes a boatload for two people!

The family thoroughly enjoyed it, even with the cottage cheese. (They were skeptical about it.  Lol)  It took me longer to prepare but I did double the recipe and jacked up the layering.  Lol.  It was really good though.  In my opinion it could use more meat sauce but we still enjoyed it.

This was GREAT!  The only thing I altered was to use TVP (texturized vegetable protein) instead of ground beef because I’m a vegetarian, but I wanted to make the recipe with the highest review:)  I had never used egg, Parmesan & butter to coat the noodles when I made baked spaghetti, and this made the dish really rich and yummy.  I followed all steps except beef, adding 1 cup dehydrated TVP (with 1 cup hot veggie broth to rehydrate) instead.  That mixed into the sauce was enough for the whole dish. Layering made it more like lasagna and it wasn’t difficult to do. This was a hit at a table where I’m the only vegetarian—the meat lover loved it, too. I’ll definitely make this again!

So I made it according to the directions first and it was great! Although I’m not a big cottage cheese fan. So I made it with cream cheese substitute and it was FANTASTIC. Best baked spaghetti I’ve EVER had!

I made this yesterday but with one slight change. I didn’t have any cottage cheese so I used cream cheese instead. It was a big hit with my family, including the picky eaters.

Great recipe to “play” with. I used corkscrew pasta with the vegetables servings (Tricolor.) Did not include ground beef or onion. Instead, chopped up some slices of turkey pepperoni, and added to the sauce layers. . Smaller amount of all ingredients to fit in casserole. After uncovering, the recipe says to continue baking until cheese is brown, but no cheese on top.  Sauce on top got a bit burnt. Next time I will save some of the shredded cheese to sprinkle on top after uncovering.

Husband and son ( age 30) said recipe was a keeper!

Husband says this is the best thing I’ve made ever.  Made it just as is except used angel hair.  I think I may use a little more sauce next time, but it’s really good as is.

Simple and easy to make. I followed the recipe and found it slightly bland so I added Italian seasoning, and red pepper. Very good overall.

I admit this recipe is great.  I loved it and the 9x13 dish did not last past the meal.  I was asked if I made any changed to the original recipe.  Yes I did.  I added sun-dried tomatoes to it.  But I have a thing for sun-dried tomatoes.  Again I say, the recipe as is is great.  I thank you for sharing and I hope my review helps someone in someway. I made this recipe two times in the span of one week.  Thank you.

I have made this lots of times everyone loves it I’m the only person I the house that eats cottage cheese but they all love this stuff . I have followed the recipe every time but the last time we like a lot of sauce so I have used a sauce from all recipes it’s called bobbies sauce it’s really good . So I also put sauce in the pan under everything that it I loved it before and now I love them both together

Winner, winner spaghetti dinner!!  This was a big hit with my family. It's super easy and quick to put together. I substituted meatballs for ground beef.  I added Trader Joe's party meatballs, cut in half, to my sauce for extra flavor and protein.  The results were delicious. I'm so happy to have found this recipe - it's a keeper!

Yes! I will make it again! This is a great recipe just as written. I kept the base recipe in tact. I realized the egg mixture adds texture and a richness to the noodles. Also, the Parmesan needs something to stick to Lol. I enjoy eating cottage cheese so I had no problem leaving it in. I added a few more seasonings to my meat, including fresh garlic and parsley.  
This dish made my son smile :)

I made a couple of changes. I mixed 4 Tbsp of butter and 2 wedges of light laughing cow swiss with the parmesan cheese ( light also) and eggs. I also omitted the ricotta/cottage cheese since I didn't have any, and I wanted lighten up the recipe.  I used 1 cup part skim mozzarella to put in the layers and on top.  With 10 servings it came up to 10 WW freestyle points. Feels liked cheating! Creamy yummy goodness!

I doubled the tomato sauce because it was a bit dry for my liking. Also I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and used ground Italian sausage in place of ground beef. This made it very flavorful! A good basic recipe to build from.

I made this and divided into a couple different dishes. One for a friend. Turned out delicious. I used some homemade freezer spaghetti sauce I made with tomatoes from out garden and ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I also used a Italian blend of 5 cheeses instead of mozzarella. Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is so good!  I made it years ago and lost the recipe. The version I had was called spaghetti pie, and the only difference was that you pressed the spaghetti/egg mixture up the sides of the pan to make a "pie" crust. Otherwise, this recipe is exactly the same.  It's very good.  I'm so glad I found the recipe here!  Thank you.  Oh... and there is NOT too much cheese.  Is there really such a thing as too much cheese?

I have made this several times now and it is always a hit! Tonight I made a large batch of it with 2 jars of sauce, 1 alfredo and 1 six cheese. I also added fresh garlic, sautéed zucchini and yellow squash to the sauce.  It was yummy! I skipped the cottage cheese because I forgot to buy it, and it wasn't missed at all.

My family really enjoys this recipe!  I use a bit of minced onion with the ground beef, doubled the sauce,  used half cottage cheese/ricotta, and also used half mozzarella/Italian blend.  We also prefer angel hair pasta..  this is really delicious and easy!

I tried this dish out because I saw there were great reviews. I followed everything besides the onion, used half an onion but I think it was too much still. The butter made it taste greasy. Flavor was a little plain. We did not enjoy this dish. I wouldn’t make this again.

This was a big hit with my family.  There were 8 of us for dinner on Halloween and everyone (except the 5 year old) had seconds! The only change I made - and it was made in error - I left out the 5 T's of butter.  This was the first time so I can't say that it would have been better with the butter - hard to imagine!

We changed cheese due to taste differences in the family, other than that it turned out pretty good.

I made it exactly like the recipe, except I used dried chopped onions instead of a raw one. It was delicious, even my picky kids cleaned their plates! I've made it twice for families with new babies and family members in the hospital, and it's been a hit every time.  So good!

I didn't bother to read other reviews and made it as it was wrote .  I have 4 grandchildren that live with us and they all liked it but one.  She doesn't like anything other than chicken nuggets, soft tacos and steak.  But my husband and I both really liked it.  So try it as written ..

10 22 17 ... Welllll, not a good review from me.  I suppose a good beginner recipe?  It makes sooo much, too.  'Not taking points off for that, but it is huge & heavy.  There wasn't enough cheese for all that pasta.  I added about 15oz more sauce & could've probably used more.  So much spaghetti.  Even with good sauce, which I didn't have (I attempted to "fix" World's Best Lasagna sauce to go with this.) this isn't a great recipe.   'Could eat it, but didn't want to.

I did everything to exact recipe except I added 1/2 a green pepper, basil, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder and minced garlic. Next time I make it I will use less butter maybe 3 tablespoons. Also personally I only did two  layers when I feel I should have done atleast 3 with the spaghetti in between being thin so keep that in mine.

Added meatballs. Will make again. 
I will also put on here that the review question asked if I added anything to the recipe and if I would make it again, so I answered. Thank you!

Delicious!  No changes needed.  However, I used egg noodles bc I didn't have spaghetti on hand and I added Italian seasoning to the egg, butter and parmesan cheese mix for the noodles.  Everyone loved it!  Very easy.

Excellent .  This is a keeper .  My whole family enjoyed it and it even tasted better the next day.  I used homemade sauce instead of jarred sauce .. that's the only difference from the original recipe.

Fantastic !! I had a house full of teenagers, mostly vegetarians, I replaced the hamburger with spinach sauteed in garlic and onion. They loved it !!! Pretty easy to make, well worth the time. I only wish I had taken a pic.

I made this last night and it was amazing. I did a couple things different. I  make my own spaghetti sauce first and used that instead of jarred sauce. Also when layering I used cottage cheese &mozzarella on first layer. On the second layer I used ricotta cheese & sharp cheddar cheese. I will definitely make this again.

This is a delicious recipe. For those who find it to be bland, my suggestion is to find a sauce that is more flavorful. I like Classico Spicy Red Pepper, Newman's Sockarooni or almost any Arrabiata sauce. I used to buy sauces that sounded good (such as Four Cheese), but realized that some sauces really tasted special to me  and consistently give a better result.

Good as written. I prefer ricotta cheese and made my own sauce. This would be "da bomb" Manwich sauce.

Made the dish mostly as is. Know before you start that this dish is LARGE. I made a few tweaks.  I used a cup of parmesan and I added more meat, (I used a pound and a half). I did use cottage cheese (2 cups is 28 ounces), but I think ricotta might be a better idea. I omitted salt and used a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. For cheese I used 8 ounce packages of Kraft Italian 5 cheese (1 & 1/2 packages). I was kinda okay with the flavor, but I think this is a one-off recipe for me.

Perfect as written with the exception of the layering:  "Top with half the cottage cheese, mozzarella, and meat sauce. Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.  Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until the cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes longer."  Nowhere does it state to end with cheese.  When I removed it from oven I needed to add cheese, put it back in the oven to finish the cooking.  We loved it and I will make it again.

I like the simplicity of this baked spaghetti recipe. I did make a few changes though. I am not a big fan of cottage cheese, so I used 1 cup of sour cream instead. I also used "Mama Francesca's grated Garlic Parmesan cheese" for the grated parm, and I added shredded jack cheese along with the mozzarella cheese since my husband is a big jack cheese fan.  I got so many compliments on this dish, I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is amazing! I only added a few things. I mixed in 1 pound of Italian sausage and some chopped garlic with the hamburger meat and onions. Once I made the egg mixture I then added Italian seasoning to the mixture before I coated the noodles with it. This makes a ton of food and is perfect for a large dinner party.

I make with 1/2# spaghetti noodles, 2T butter, 1 egg and 2 cups mozzarella. I'm not much of a pasta fan and prefer it saucy. I like this baked spaghetti much, much better than traditional spaghetti.

I used a mix of cheeses instead of using just the mozzarella. I used Asiago,Parmsan and I topped it with Cheddar Jack. But love the recipe. Glad I decided to look online instead of just throwing some spaghetti and sauce in a pan and baking it,lol.

This was really good! My husband loves (his mother's) baked spaghetti so he was the real critic but I made it for a house full of people last night and everyone thought it was great! The cheese on the noodle mixture was delicious! We will definitely be having this again but as some others suggested, we will be adding a second jar of sauce. The sauce to noodle ratio was a little off making it a tad on the dry side but that's personal preference. Very good and easy!

As you stated, I followed the direction as written and was very disappointed. In your layering, I did as specified, "spaghetti, cottage cheese, mix cheese, meat sauce. When completed, there was no cheese melted on top. I'm not happy!

I did not change this recipe and it was phenomenal!!! I served this to my family and they loved it!!! Only critic I had was my mother and she wants me to leave the cottage cheese out. So next time I make one, I will make one for her separately!!! Awesome recipe. Thank you for sharing this!!!

I made it exactly like the recipe and My family loved this recipe.  The secret is in the egg mixture you mix on the noodles.  I also made a batch for a family from church who just had a baby.  Definitely my new goto recipe!

Used a diced clove of garlic, some Italian seasoning and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. 

Also reduced the recipe a bit since it's just me.... 1 egg, less pasta, etc...

Perfection. 

Maybe next time I'll exchange the beef for Italian sausage.

I made this for a crowd and it was a huge hit! I doubled the recipe and followed it almost exactly- just used whole wheat spaghetti, ground turkey and I omitted the onion in one of the dishes (more kid friendly for my bunch). They both turned out great and everyone had seconds! Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious.  Just yum!  I made it exactly as written and it is incredible.  This opinion is seconded by my hubby and my bubba.  Hubby cringed when I put cottage cheese in the cart at the store but after we ate, he said, "Don't change a thing."  We will be making this again...exactly as written.

Heads up for silly people like me.  Followed the recipe and layered in this order: noodles, cottage cheese, mozzarella, and meat sauce.  Then repeat.  However, this does not put cheese on the top to brown like the pic shows.  Oops. .. You'll want to layer it so cheese ends up on top.

I made this after a verrry long day and ended up accidentally mixing everything together instead of layering. It was still great! Use a high quality pasta sauce or make your own and this will be delicious!

Delicious!  Many people have suggested changes to this recipe but I found it to be delicious just the way it is.  Will definitely use this again and again.  I even froze some of it in smaller portions for later.

I have made this recipe for family three times and have received consistent positive feedback. It is my go to receive for Church potlucks. I have not changed the ingredients other than adding cooked mushrooms to taste. I recommend using a deep dish 9 x13. It makes a lot.

I stayed basically true to the recipe except I used my own already prepared sauce with  ground beef, peppers, mushroom & garlic but added the seasoning salt to it- a great touch.  I only had about 1/3 cup sour cream to replace the cottage cheese and found this to be a perfect amount. I made this in the morning, the pasta stayed  moist, the dish was delicious and I'd serve this to company any day. This would also freeze very  well which I'll do next time. Cook once, eat twice!

Fantastic recipe just how it's written!  The seasoning salt is a nice touch. For you cottage cheese haters, my wife won't even look at the stuff. She never noticed it in there. I used an Italian cheese mix instead of mozzarella. Really really tasty.

This is the first time that I have rated a recipe after using this site for more than a year.  With the exception of using my home-made spaghetti sauce and leaving out the onions, as my husband is allergic to them....I loved this recipe.  I made two batches for our 4H dinner.  Mixing and preparing the dishes the night before to allow the flavors to blend and cooking on a lower heat; 300 for 30 minutes then decreasing to 180 for the last two hours before the dinner.   I got a lot of complements and am making it again tonight for our birthday celebration tomorrow.  It's easy, and very tasty, and like other reviews, I found that the egg, butter and parmesan   was not too rich and added layers of flavor to the dish.

I had meat sauce sauce in the freezer so I used that, then cooked the pasta and followed the recipe as posted. The egg butter and Parmesan mixed with the pasta was delicious and made this dish great. My dish boiled over in the oven as it was quite full in a 9x13 dish. The recipe doesn't say to put cheese on top after removing the foil but I think it was supposed too. Served with a salad and garlic toast I feed 8 and had leftovers.

I made this and it is so good!!! I did use two jars of the Spaghetti sauce as it would have been too dry without it. 
I also use ANGEL HAIR Pasta as I just perfer that kind of thin pasta.  Next time I will use black olives in it as I used to use them in plain spaghetti and everyone liked it that way. 
I had my daughter son in law and their 10 & 15 year old over & this recipe made plenty for all six of us and seconds.

I followed the recipe exactly but it needed more meat sauce. Next time I will double the meat sauce mixture. It was too cheesy and 1 lb of meat with 1 jar of sauce was not enough.

Followed the recipe exactly. Not enough sauce for the amount of pasta. For left overs I had to make additional sauce to spoon over so it wouldn't be so dry.  Next time I think I will reduce the pasta and up the sauce a little bit.  Hubby LOVED it! I will make again and try my changes. Great recipe though.

Normally I follow the directions to a tee, but this time I unfortunately did not have Cottage so I also used ricotta and I didn't have mozzarella but I had a blend of and provolone so I use that instead. Looks amazing!!

The only thing I changed instead of hamburger I had a pound of breakfast sausage on hand , used that turned out great. Wife loved it and I sent a care package of leftovers to a family member she liked it too. Definitely will make it again. Maybe with my own sauce and Italian sausage.

I made it today and only made slight changes opting for whole wheat pasta and ground turkey. And my goodness it's delicious. I'm sure it'll taste even better once I have leftovers.

My family really liked this dish and they are hard to please. I will make this again and may even try using ricotta instead of cottage cheese, or sausage instead of hamburger. It would even be good with no meat, if you have a vegetarian in the house. Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this exactly as written except I substituted ground turkey for ground beef. It got rave reviews. Like some others have stated, I really believe the egg/butter/Parmesan cheese mixture on the pasta is what makes this dish stand out from others. It will go into our regular rotation.

Did this almost exactly as the recipe called for, except I baked it for 20 minutes with the foil on, then 20 with the foil off, and it worked great. I also omitted the onions from the ground beef (fiancee hates onions) and substituted some garlic pepper to give it a bit more flavor. Turned out fantastic, will definitely make this again.

was very good as is.  I assumed a box of spaghetti was 16 Oz but realized after it is only 12 Oz so technically I used less noodles but doubt it fundamentally changed anything.  Wife and two picky kids loved it as well.

I made this tonight for my Daughter's Birthday Dinner. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and it was perfect. I used Michigan Brand 4% Cottage cheese, as it is a "drier" texture. I would make this again, and again, and again!

Excellent.  Only change I would suggest making is the order in which the items are placed in the dish.  1.  1/2 of the spaghetti, 2. 1/2 of the cottage cheese.  3.  1/2 meat sauce.  4.  1/2 mozzarella.  Repeat.  Need to finish dish with mozzarella.  I think the author of the recipe followed this sequence as identified by the photo.

This was seriously yummy says EVERYONE in the family.  I made it exactly as is.  I did use extra sauce to warm it up the next day.  WHEN I make it again, I will use a little less noodles.  But this was to die for good!  Thanks for sharing.

I'd give it more than three stars but the commercial sauce is troubling. Flavors can be affected by the differences in sauces and, why not just make your own? Just my opinion but any pasta made with bottled sauce is just plain lazy and not up to par.

Kind of bland for my tastes. Had to add more spaghetti sauce and tobasco when reheating. That way, as a left-over,  it was very nice and worth making again

I thought this was a really good recipe. As with any recipe, you have to season to taste. I used ground turkey and my favorite spaghetti sauce. I added onions, mushrooms and green pepper. Also, instead of spaghetti noodles, I opted for zoodles. It was delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

I used the springs pasta.   It was okay; I would not make it again.  Reminded me of lasagna layers.  If I made it again, I would cut down on the pasta.  Would be best for more than two people.

Hi I made this as it says in recipe and love it. I'm curious if anyone has made it the night before and then baked it just before dinner. We are having company and I'm trying to do as much as I can beforehand.  I am thinking cover with foil in fridge then pop in oven.  Any help or suggestions? Thanks

This is really delicious! I made it according to directions the first time and it barely fit the 9 X 13 baking dish I normally use. Baked it on an aluminum lined cookie sheet to catch spills. Leftovers for lunch the following day were even better. Made it again last night with Ricotta instead of cottage cheese (because it’s what I had) and added about a cup and a half of leftover chopped spinach to the meat mixture (also just because I had it). I also used a 3 inch deep 9 X 13 glass baking dish and that worked out a lot better space wise. The spinach added another layer of tastes and it was also delicious. Looking forward to lunch today.

I didn't have any cottage cheese or ricotta so I skipped it.  It turned out pretty good but wasn't cheesy enough for my daughter.  I'll try it again making it per recipe and see if that satisfies her.

Good recipe.  Only change I made was using Greek yoghurt in place of the curd. Next time, I will use less noodles as I would enjoy more sauce with this dish.

Good, but not great.  The only change I made was substituting ground turkey for the ground beef.  The way the recipe reads, there is no cheese on top, only meat sauce..  Certainly edible, but will seek out another spaghetti casserole recipe in the future.

I made this it with gluten free thin spaghetti and it turned out very nice. My husband said it's a keeper.

Love this dish.  Have also made it substituting sausage or Italian sausage in place of the hamburger.   Gives it a little extra flavor.

Awesome! I used 8oz of shells because  I only had 24oz of sauce. This would be great for company if I used as much as it called for.

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe and my husband, my daughter and I loved it!  It's lighter than a lasagna and we could differentiate the meat from the pasta from the cheese and the tastes were all excellent.  We will definitely make this again!

Made this for dinner and invited friends over. Everyone came back for seconds, my husband had thirds! It was super delicious! Quite a hit and easy to make! The only thing I changed was that I used whole grain spaghetti. Perfect!

Easy & tasty.  I think I would replace the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese next time. The cottage cheese tends to be runnier. Definitely will make again

My family loved this: a spruced up version the very basic version I grew up with.  Even my 10 and 7 year-olds ate it.  I followed the recipe except for using turkey meat with pinch of fennel seed for extra flavor.  Made my own sauce and probably had more than called for.  I thought I could fit it into a 3 quart casserole dish, but had to put half in a second casserole. We'll be making it again and again.

I did not make this, I have a very similar. recipe I make and will stick with it.  Mine has less spaghetti, more of about everything else.  But...I did like the idea this version has of  making 2 layers of spaghetti, etc.  I think I'll try that the next time I make this.

My husband made this dish and it came out amazing. First time we fixed spaghetti like this. Left out the cottage cheese cause it doesn't agree with our stomachs and the recipe still came out great. Loved it and so did my brother n law and his girlfriend. They have been asking for more lol.

Everyone in my house LOVED it! The cottage cheese really gave it a great texture... the only recommendation is to use 1 1/2 puunds of beef (from my meat loving dad). 100% making again

Great recipe. Will use again. The only difference ---instead of using regular ground meat I used Italian sausage made from deer meat. Took it out of its casing.  It was delicious.

Made this last night. I used the exact amounts . It turned out great! Next time I am going to half the recipe and use fettuccine  pasta. But the original recipe would be very good  for pot lucks and parties.

This was a tasty comfort food for my family.  It took a long time to prepare and cook .... one and a half hours!  Don't make this if you are in a hurry.  I did without the cottage cheese and added mozzarella cheese instead.  It was moist and tender and very cheesy!

I skipped the eggs and butter, because it seemed unnecessary.  I also skipped pre-cooking the pasta; I made sure it was covered in sauce before it went into the oven, and it turned out fine. This was delicious. My husband LOVED it and requested that we have it again soon.
Second time I made it I used uncooked rotini (we preferred the spaghetti noodles though) which i mixed with the cheeses and added fresh spinach to the mixture. Spread home made meat sauce into bottom of casserole, added the noodle mixture, poured rest of the sauce over it, topped with mozzarella.

Next time I will use a deeper  dish/lasagna pan as it overflowed when cooking. I also started with a meat layer (like I would lasagna) then noodles, cottage cheese, noodles, meat, mozzarella. Easy and super good!

Followed recipe to letter...okay, I did make one addition and that was to use both ground beef and Italian sweet sausage and it was fab! My husband, who NEVER eats leftovers, actually requested it for dinner the following night!!

Everyone loved it.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Store bought sauce always tastes a little sweet to me but it is part of what makes this recipe so quick and easy.

This was easy to make and was quite a tasty meal.  I used penne pasta instead of spaghetti, and put in a  Pasilla and a Serrano pepper.  It was quite the hit.

My husband and kids loved it.  Which is a great thing because my daughter tends to be a picky eater.  My husband said "we will never buy frozen pasta meals again"  And since it was easy ... he is probably right.

My mother has been making a version of this for almost 40 years. She always made it in a Pyrex dish.  I would split this one between 2 smaller baking dishes and freeze one for later.

Well I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe! I would say I followed the directions to a tee and it turned out yummy! I might have had a little excess on the ingredients, such as more then a pound of hamburger and a smidge more sauce but other then that... spot on! I made everything and put together the night before, that made my cooking time longer but again, turned out great! I will make this again! Great change from "normal" spaghetti!

We love this, make it often and everyone loves it.  We do make the sauce without meat for my vegetarian daughter but keep some meat sauce on the side for the carnivores.  We rarely have leftovers.

My family loved it! I did make a few changes. I don't use jar spagetti sauce so I made my own and I added one cup of cottage cheese using 1 and 1/2 cup per layer. Other than that it was great!! I will be making it again.

I followed the recipe except for the following:  I used 1lb and 10oz of ground beef, 48 oz of Paul Neuman's marinara sauce, 2 regular brown onions, 3/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and 4 eggs. Also I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, and I added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the ground beef.  Oh, and I cooked it about 15 min longer.  It was fantastic!

Great dish, loved having some to freeze for later.  Made the recipe as written...but needed to save a little of the mozzarella cheese to put on top.  I didn't see that in the instructions, and didn't catch it until ready to put in the oven.

Absolutely delicious! Tastes like lasagne but easier to eat. I used Dreamfield spaghetti to cut down on carbs. Only change I made. Will definitely make this for the theatre kids we feed during practices, in lieu of lasagne. I would also serve with optional, additional sauce on the side.

Prepared this for a Framily dinner and it was a hit in spite of me not reading directions.  I actually placed the noodles in with the meat sauce (used 2 full jars of Rao's sauce) and poured the Parmesan, egg, butter mixture in also.  I put half the noodle and sauce mix in a casserole and then all of the cottage cheese in the middle with the 2 cups of cheese and topped with the remaining sauce/noodles and remaining cheese.  I baked as indicated and it set enough to cut in squares.  Served with a spinach salad and cheese rolls...delish!  Next time I will follow the recipe

Absolutely Delicious! Everyone in my family went back for more! Definitely will make this again. The only thing I did differently than the recipe instructed was I added 1/2 cup of parsley to the meat and spaghetti sauce (used 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce).

Great recipe, but it makes a LOT!  The 9x13 was too full.  Next time I'll use a bigger casserole.  I ended with some cheese on top, not meat sauce, but the recipe is awesome.

This is quite a decent dish if made correctly.  If not, you might have a miss on your hands.  The directions leave out a crucial and VERY important point.  You must introduce the egg mixture into the noodles when the noodles are still hot.   You should drain the noodles and put them back in the pan while still hot.  Then quickly whisk in the egg/butter/Parmesan mixture.   If you miss this you will have a "meh" experience with this dish.  Also, if you short cut and mix the cottage cheese in with the egg mixture, you will also ruin this step.  Classic Italian cooks will recognize this as a basic technique and it makes all the difference.   Also, as mentioned by a few others, the sauce amount is 32oz which is more than a standard jar and a careless read could cause the dish to be dry.   When I do this again I will make my own sauce and maybe use ricotta.

Went to dinner at a favorite restaurant and ordered baked spaghetti last night.  It was spaghetti in meat sauce baked with mozzarella melted on top.  I like the dish an order it when there but now I will try adding the eggs mixture to the spaghetti when I make at home.  Do not want to layer it, just bake it altogether.

Chop the onions smaller. Nobody wants a huge piece of onion.
Use sausage if you have it. And definitely use ricotta cheese instead of the cottage.
Instant, easy lasagna.

I used to make this recipe years ago when I lived in an area where ricotta was not available.  We called it fake lasagna--which is basically what it is.  It's an adequate recipe though it needs basil, oregano and parsley added to most commercial sauces.  A little red wine added to the sauce helps too.

I grew up with my mom making a version of this.  My husband and I make this for our family as well with just a slight adjustment.  For ours, we cook the spaghetti and brown italian sausage.  We then mix the pasta, meat, and a jar of sauce in a greased casserole dish.  We sprinkle the top with shredded cheese and bake covered.  Even easier than this recipe and our young adult children are taking this recipe to college with them.

I made this last night and it was pretty tasty.  I used extra ground beef and lactose free cottage cheese.  it baked up nicely but I think it needs a bit more seasoning, maybe some garlic and italian seasoning.  My husband loved it as is.

Really enjoyed this recipe...made as written with the exception used linguine instead of spaghetti pasta . What really appeals to me is the flexibility of this recipe. it is a great base recipe , allowing the cook to add or substitute ingredients to suit their taste. Next time we are going to add sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms...can't wait! Thank you for sharing.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it turned out great. The eggs made it more solid than I thought. I was afraid it would be too much liquid but it turned out just right. I had to use a metal cake pan and I couldn't quite pack it all into it. But it was great. Enough for about 3 meals for us.

Reading the ingredients it sounded like  there would not be enough sauce so I added a can of tomatoes. I also added green pepper and garlic. That was the only variations I made but boy was it dry. Even with the canned tomatoes. Too much spaghetti I think and definitely not enough cottage cheese to make 2 layers.
My husband said he put some salsa on top of it since it was so dry!
There's a lot of leftovers so I can't imagine how dry it's going to be after being in the refrigerator!
I will probably look for another baked spaghetti recipe on here.

I love this recipe! Even my husband asked for thirds. I used my own homemade sauce though. 22 oz. of sauce, half cottage cheese and half sour cream,1 1/2 cups of dry pasta and half the amount of mozzarella and filled up an 8" square baking dish. I mixed the cooked pasta with the eggs, parmesan, cottage cheese, butter and sour cream then layered the pasta, sauce and mozzarella twice. I baked it covered for 20 minutes then uncovered for 20 minutes and it turned out perfect. A hint I got from chefs in a couple of magazines is to use lots of salt when cooking pasta so you don't take away flavor from the sauce. It works very well for me. 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of salt to 3 quarts of water. I hope this helps some of you who said that it was not very tasty.

I made it to recipe aside from exchanging cottage cheese for ricotta. To me it seems dry, like it needs more sauce. I'll serve it onto warmed sauce from what I had leftover in the jar. Very rich & cheesy, though I think I'll go back to plain ol spaghetti for now.

I'm wondering if this could be made ahead and refrigerated, or even frozen, until the selected meal for baking and serving?  Anyone with suggestions!  I had to rate to post this, but I haven't tried the recipe yet.

If you like cheese, you will love this recipe. I'm not a huge red meat person, but the ratio of meat / sauce / cheese is perfect. I had slightly less pasta and sauce than what the recipe called for, but it still worked out just fine.  I used penne and fresh Parmesan. I can't wait to try making this again with fresh homemade sauce!! I did add some extra seasonings and a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity, but  other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing.

This was awesome with rave reviews from the group I cook for. I made enough for 40, and added a layer of ricotta in the middle. Added 4 cans diced tomatoes, 6 cans tomato sauce, 3 Tbsp minced garlic and about another Tbsp Italian seasoning to the sauce. Also subbed out mild Italian sausage for half the hamburger. They told me to put that on the meal rotation and definitely make it again. Some recipes don't do very well when I scale them up. This one was a keeper with my changes. Made 2 steam table size pans.

We are a family of 6, four of whom are teenagers, so I thought I should double the recipe as I do for pretty much everything. That was totally not necessary. One recipe would have easily fed us all. Having said that , everyone's plates were heaping and most went back for seconds, so I'll call it a win! Will definitely make this again. Nice comfort food casserole for a rainy Sunday.

Made as written other than ricotta in place of cottage cheese and less mozz for our taste.  Definitely don't skip the egg, butter, cheese with noodle step as it makes the dish much better.  Maybe will add a bit more sauce next time.

My husband said to add this recipe to my "top5" he loved it so much! The only comments I would make would be that the recipe made so much food that it almost didn't fit in my 9x13 baking dish.  If you have something a little larger it might be worth using a bigger baking dish so you don't risk overflow. The recipe also called for 32 oz of pasta sauce. My local grocery only had 24 oz and 48 oz jars and I don't like anything going to waste so I dumped in all 48 oz and it didn't feel like it was too much. Other than that I followed the recipe to a "T" and it really was delicious.

It really was easy to make and I did enjoy it, although I'll probably make my own sauce the next time; the all natural puttanesca sauce I bought was quite delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I make this all the time and the whole family loves it, even my picky 8 year old who hates spaghetti.  I now prefer to use my homemade sauce and a Parmesan/ricotta blend instead of straight parm cheese.  Also, I substitute olive oil instead of butter.  I typically make this with Italian sausage.  It turns out delicious every time.  This is my go-to dish for family get-togethers.

Made this for dinner tonight! We liked it. I used ground deer instead of hamburger. We are always looking for ways to use up our ground deer in a way that kind of masks the gamey taste. My husband said he couldn't even tell it was deer.

I made it as directed with one substitution. I already made sausage meatballs so I put those in instead of ground beef. This was a hit with my husband, but our toddler refused to eat more than one bite. I think it was more flavorful than he likes his spaghetti to be. But for us, it was delicious! The noodles are rich and flavorful, and the melty cheese is just perfect. I'll make it again and again! Plus we have enough leftovers for several days of lunch.

I made it to the recipe with the exception that I did not use any meat in it.  It turned out very tasty but a little bit dry, something that can be easily cured the next time I make it. (A little more sauce, or perhaps a very little bit of mayonnaise.)

My husband and I loved this. I made it last night. I didn't have cottage cheese so I used Karfts  cheese slices between the layers of spaghetti and meat sauce. It was so good my husband had a second helping and can't wait to have left overs to night.

basically only thing different I did was only 2 cups of mozzarella cheese (leftover mozz. and cheddar I had) and no onion. I added some parmesan cheese after meat sauce layer too. Turned out perfectly! Will make again!

I made thistwo nights ago. I kept everything almost exactly the same, except I used more sauce (48 oz) and ricotta cheese instead of cottage. I hate cottage cheese. lol I also mixed the eggs with the ricotta instead of with the pasta. I definitely think this needs way more tomato sauce than what the recipe calls for.  I think 60 oz would have been a lot better. It was good, but a little dry. My husband and 2 year old like it, though, so I will make it again...with more sauce. :)

This was supper easy, and my family loved it! Including my picky 11 year old daughter. The only thing I did different was, I didn't add the onion to my meat. My husband and daughter don't like onion. I hate cottage cheese and I have to say you don't even taste it! Will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe several times. It's a household fav! The only thing extra I add is pepperoni when layering. In fact just made it for dinner. Love it! ????

Excellent dish.  Quick and easy.  Better than plain spaghetti because of the baked in cheese.  I used the cottage cheese, plus some Parmesan and mozzarella.

I used directions as written except I added garlic to sauce,  because we like garlic.  Yes, it's basically lasagna with spaghetti noodles but the eggs & parm make the difference.  We all love this, thank you for sharing!

The only change I made was no onion. I didn't have one at home so I had to leave it out. This was definitely a hit, and I had leftovers which is nice because there are some week nights I work late and my husband gets home later as well. Leftovers are easy to pop in microwave and eat the next day. I will be making this again! :-)

Wow!  Finally a great baked spaghetti recipe that I will make again and again. I made it exactly as written EXCEPT I forgot the egg! No harm done. I also cut the recipe in half since it's just hubby and me--and it still made a full casserole  dish.  I used whole wheat spaghetti and fat free cottage cheese.  Just superb.  A big THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!

Those of you that have conniptions when a reviewer hasn't followed a recipe exactly will probably want to leave the room or reach for oxygen:
I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and only 15 oz because that's the size that was available.  It was enough, but next time I may consider buying two containers and using the extra.  Ricotta is harder-to-spread than cottage cheese, and the additional cheese wouldn't hurt.  A plus is that ricotta isn't as watery as cottage cheese.  
My preferred pre-made sauce comes in 24 oz. containers; I used two and did not think it was too much.
My son is not a meat-eater, so I did warm the sauce a little before using.
I added broccoli.  I used frozen, but I think the dish cooks long enough that next time I will use fresh because the broccoli was done a little too soft for my preference.
As a rule, I'm not a salter, but I strongly suggest that it not be skipped in this recipe.  I can also see where extra garlic wouldn't hurt.  
I served with sautéed mushrooms.  I didn't add them to the recipe because my son doesn't care for them.
I like this recipe, and will definitely make it again.
It makes a lot!!

I love this recipe - with about 15 minutes left, I sprinkle italian seasoned bread crumbs on the top.  It gives it a nice crunch.

I've made this many times, with both ricotta and cottage cheese, both delicious but I like it with ricotta the best! I've added parsley to the ricotta before, fresh garlic to the onion and meat, etc and that's all good but the recipe is really is terrific as is. The eggs give the noodles an amazing texture and richness, but I will suggest you temper the eggs using the melted butter while it's still hot, I found that adding the very hot noodles to the egg mixtures scrambled my eggs slightly. So now I slowly whisk in the still hot melted butter to the eggs and parm and then all is well when adding the hot noodles! I've made many spaghetti bake recipes and the eggs in this one completely put the flavor and texture over the edge. Love.

Amazing!!! I made this on Mother's Day. I had to use ground turkey for a family member that does not like beef. It still turned out wonderful. I also made a standing rib roast for people that did want beef. The expensive roast remained untouched while everyone was digging in for seconds and thirds on the casserole which cost much less I might add!!

I followed the recipe, but next time would not use cottage cheeseas the texture and flavor did not work well IMO, use the real thing ergo ricotta cheese and it may be different. The eggs give some bind to the dish, maybe will use this recipe again but would have to change it, then it wont be this recipe I guess..........

I have been making this for years.  My daughter hates lasagne, but loves this, so I make this as a lasagne alternative.

I normally don't use egg; I'll have to try that.  I use one whole container of cottage cheese, two blocks of mozzarella (cheaper to grate it myself), and usually one container of Parmesan.  The Parm and half the mozz I stir in to the mixture; the other half of the mozz goes on top.

I know.  It's a lot of cheese.  But it is so yummy!!  I always make a double batch so I can have leftovers the next day.  I never get leftovers; my boys fall on this dish like ravening wolves.

This also works well with half ground beef and half Italian sausage.

I was happy to find this recipe because it is so very much like lasagna but without the lasagna noodle.  My son, because of his restrictive diet, cannot have gluten.  As of yet, I have not found a store brand gluten free lasagna noodle. Following the recipe, I did use spaghetti but it was gluten free.  I also used ricotta cheese instead of the recommended cottage cheese.  The recipe worked out very well to bring an old favorite back.

I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and it was delicious! Also I don't recommend wheat spaghetti noodles, because it gives it a kinda bitter taste.

Great recipe.  I did not make any changes and my family liked it quite a bit.  It also reheats really well for leftovers and to take to work for lunch.  When making it a second time I will adjust for my family's taste preferences, but as it is, this is a keeper!

FINE EASY  I think this was fine. It had the spaghetti feel. There was nothing special about it.  It is great for a one dish taking somewhere or  putting in guickly when you get home. Everyone liked it.

This was a really great meal for us.  I didn't have ground beef or any meat product so I used 3 cups of chopped pan fried cauliflower. I added garlic salt and cayenne pepper. I only used 2 cups of cheese,which was a good amount but could have used more.  I just used a 24oz can of pasta sauce, which was a good amount but could have used more. I added a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes to the spaghetti.  Next time I'm going to add mushrooms green peppers, and spinach. Use more sauce, cheese,  and cauliflower again.

I made this last night. I substituted the cottage cheese with Ricotta and ground beef with ground turkey. I added a quarter cup of parmesan cheese and a dash of dried parsley to the Ricotta cheese. I always season my ground turkey with onion salt and worcestershire sauce to give it more flavor. My picky eater teenager loved this dish. He said it was the best dish I've ever made. Thank you for this recipe!!! I'm definitely adding it to my rotation.

Made this tonight and was shocked how yummy it was! I did cut the butter and just used one tablespoonful to cut fat and calories. Also used low fat cottage cheese and skim milk cheese. So good entire family loved it!

Was good, not sure on the instructions it says to put on for another 20-25 min for the cheese to cook, but at 40 mins the cheese was all cooked.  the picture shows cheese on top but it's not in the instructions for extra cheese on top and I followed instructions as written.  overall the fam liked it.

Followed the recipe and it was great!!!  One word of advice, give yourself a couple of hours to prepare and cook.  It stays 60+ minutes in the oven alone.  Will make again and again.

It was much too dry with little taste. Don't think I'll even try it again with more sauce and spices added. The leftovers just sat.

We used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, substituted ground italian sausage for half of the ground beef, and a mix of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheese for the Parmesan.  This was wonderful and went  well with a spicy italian salad and cannoli poke cake for dessert.

It was delicious. Made it twice. The first time I made it exactly like the recipe said. the only difference is I did not have a dish that was deep enough to layer it, so it was just 1 layer. it still turned out great and the family like it better with the one layer. 
The second version was great also!! I used 1/2 lb of ground turkey and 1/2 lb of sweet Italian sausage. I was out of parmesan so I grated the Asiago I had. Garlic of course. I also grated a thin layer of cheddar habanero cheese over the cottage cheese as we like our Spaghetti kind of spicy. Family loved this version also, more leaned towards the spicy version. 
This was great. I agree you have to make like the original recipe to adequately rate the recipe. Afterwards, you can change all you want!!!

This is a keeper!  I've got one of those type of kids that doesn't like sauce on his spaghetti.  And I can't complain because I remember eating my spaghetti and sauce separate too.  I know , weird!  Anyhoo, he loved this which means this is what I will probably change my spaghetti nights over to.  Okay, my changes due to what I had on hand:  Used a 24oz jar of generic sauce  with a 15oz can of plain tom. sauce.  Added extra oregano & basil to that.  Layered some thin sliced sandwich pepperoni that desperately needed to be used along with about 4oz of cream cheese cubed.  Cleaning out the fridge here.  An 8oz package of sliced mozzarella combined with some Monterey Jack cheese and the parm.  Didn't have any cottage cheese or Romano in the house, but I'm sure that would be delicious!  This is a very forgiving recipe, and believe me, it will be gobbled up!  Thanks CALLIKO!

The only change I made was to use more sauce because I had a large jar in the cupboard.  My family loves this.  This is the fourth or fifth time I have made it.

I made it per the directions, minus topping with a bit of shredded sharp cheddar.  Very good.  My family demolished this one.   The kids and mother-in-law kept talking about how good this was.  Really yummy recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

The first time I make a recipe, I follow it exactly.  I loved it!
I enjoyed the creamy texture of the noodles.  The only thing I would change next time, is to add about 1/2 pound of Italian sausage for a more Italian taste.  Thanks for a great idea!

After making this per the recipe, I would either use less pasta or more sauce. Overall it baked off beautifully and filled the baker. The flavor was mild, so if you like spice....add to it.

I made it to instructions first time and it was good but next time I decided to substitute the cottage cheese with Ricotta and go 1/2 & 1/2 with ground beef and mild Italian sausage.
Those two changes really brought this dish to life!  Highly recommend those changes.

It was absolutely fantastic. We used a cheese blend instead of just the moz, and sans cottage cheese and it was a hit. Kids loved it, the hubs is crazy about it!

I really enjoyed this recipe and the massive amount of cheese involved.  Fattening? Probably.  Delicious? Definitely.  I liked the cottage cheese more than I anticipated, it added some cheesy texture chunks that were awesome.  But I'd like to try it again, with ricotta.

I make this fairly regularly  with wheat spaghetti.  Cook wheat spaghetti for only 6 minutes.  After browning meat, drain, and add. 4 cloves of chopped garlic, 1/2 medium sized jalapeño minced,  1 cup chopped red pepper.  Too much cheese with cottage cheeses.  I use 1 cup mozzarella with 1 cup Italian cheese mix ..  top with a but of crushed red pepper.

Will definitely make again. I added a cup of grated (the powdered kind) parmesan cheese to the egg/butter mixture. It didn't quite look like enough sauce so I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce along with some leftover sauce from the fridge. Also, added a few cloves of garlic and some black pepper and onion powder for seasoning. With the mozz I added some real shredded parmesan. I only had a 1/2 lb of hamburger and that was fine. I also always add a thin layer of sauce to the bottom of the dish before the first layer is added. It was delicious.

I made it exactly how the recipe called for. It was good but could have been better. Next time I will use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, because there was not enough sauce mixture for all of the noodles. I will also use ricotta cheese and add more mozzarella cheese. Next time I will also use half an onion and half a green pepper, a whole onion was too much for me. And last, I will add more seasoning to the meat and maybe add some minced garlic ;)

Made this tonight. The 1 lb ground beef didn't seem like enough with all of the other ingredients - when I do this again I will use 1 1/2 lbs. Otherwise, I skipped the butter to cut down on fat and didn't have the parmesan cheese. Made as written otherwise and it was good. Whole family enjoyed - served with a caesar salad and garlic bread.

I made this exactly as written, there are only 2 of us so I only used 1/2 of all the ingredients, and a little less then half of the spaghetti that was called for and it was plenty. You could not really tell there was any cottage cheese in it and after I took it out of the oven I put some crumbled goat cheese and let it set for about 10 min. It was really good buy very fattening. Not sure if it is worth all the extra calories with 4 different type of cheeses added. Over all it was good and I will make again, but not very often.

This is seriously my go-to recipe! My husband absolutely loves it when I make this and I love how much leftovers it creates!! Only thing I do differently is I add the cottage cheese to the noodle wash instead of using it as a layer. :)

Use no more than half the box of spaghetti. Cook spaghetti in advance to allow to cool down before adding egg mixture.

I am not a fan of using cottage cheese so I did not include that in the ingredients. It still turned out great but recommend having some extra sauce on the side to add over the top.

This is a good idea.  Too much spaghetti for me. I would use half the amount of spaghetti. I put green peppers an  mushrooms in the sauce as well. I thought it tasted great when it came out, just too many noodles.

Love this! I did use less hamburger, about .6 pounds and sliced up a couple links of mozzarella chicken sausage. I also added some spinach to the sauce and meat and let it simmer for a few minutes before layering everything.

So delicious! I made this ahead of time and doubled the recipe for freezer meals. I followed other's advice and made the following changes: 
-¾ spaghetti, ¼ spaghetti squash
-½ cottage cheese ½ ricotta cheese
-added fresh Italian parsley to the cheese mix
Turned out AMAZING!!

I love this recipe!   I did tweak it a bit,I was out of ground beef but I did have a bag of pre cooked  meatballs. What I did was cut each meatball into fourths and added them to the sauce added Italian season and garlic powder. I had sauted green peppers and onions before hand and added the sauce.

It was delish my co workers raved and now I have to bring it to every office event!

We all liked this dish. A couple thought it was a little bland but I did not spread the cottage cheese out enough. So that was my bad. I will make it again with a couple of changes.

My husband loved this recipe!  I will spice it up a bit more next time I make it with more oregano, parsley, basil and fresh garlic and mushrooms.  With those minor changes I know it will be a 5 star recipe and will be a staple in our house - at least once a month.

I cut the servings in half and it fit nicely into an 8x8 glass dish.  Cooked the onion with the meat, but then picked the pieces out to satisfy my wife's preference.  The onion flavor was there without the textures.  The dish was a hit!  We both enjoyed it.

Love this recipe!  Followed the recipe without changes. Made it for my Bunco group and everyone raved about it.  Hubby likes it because the leftovers are even better. (Recommend placing casserole dish on top of cookie sheet due to bubbling.)

Perfect for dinner & easy to pack leftovers for lunch! I used brown rice noodles & morning star crumbles (vegetarian) and it turns out awesome, boyfriend & dad didn't even notice it wasn't real meat. Sour cream works perfectly too if you don't have cottage cheese on hand :)

This was a hit with my family. I didn't have any cottage cheese on hand, but oddly enough I had some Ricotta cheese...about a cup of it left. I mixed the ricotta with a 1/2cup of sour cream and a 1/4 cup of grated parmesean. It was amazing. Thank you for this recipe!

Very good and simple recipe. I spaced adding the season salt and would definitely recommend not forgetting that step. Tasted a little plain but I added garlic salt and it was fantastic. Will definitely do again.

This recipe turned out great for us. My sister and brother-in-law were over for dinner so my sister and I ended up making it together simply because neither of us have ever used a baked spaghetti recipe that layers the ingredients like a lasagna and she wanted to try making it to, so why NOT work together? A few notes. We took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of sauce. This gave us the perfect amount and we both agreed that one jar would definitely not have been enough. We used Ragu brand, one jar of roasted garlic and one jar of super chunky mushroom. To conquer the "bland" or "tasteless" comments of others we added oregano, basil, minced garlic, parsley and a little extra s&p to the sauce. Oh, and we added salt to our pasta water.  We did not have ground beef on hand, but we had frozen meatballs which we defrosted and halved before stirring into the sauce; which we thought was a phenomenal substitution. The butter/egg/parm mixture looks pretty weird and seems weird to add to only the noodles, but IT WORKS. The only thing I will change next time (which was entirely my own fault) is that I will boil the noodles for a shorter amount of time because they were a tad bit overcooked after baking.

With the exception of I used as recommended half of the spaghetti (8oz) also 24oz instead of 32 oz pasta sauce. 
Added sautéed mushrooms in red wine to meat sauce. 
Baked uncovered for 30 min. (internal temp was 165 more than enough for beef, the eggs were pretty much cooked when I added the noodles and whisked it)

This turned out great and had more than enough leftovers for two and adding mom in the picture she gets a couple good fresh meals too.

This. Was. AWESOME! The fiancé loves pasta, so to avoid him going right down the road and ordering a $20 spaghetti dish, I spent $10 on groceries and made this--and it was incredible! I did change the recipe up only a bit--added italian parsley, and went overkill with the cheeses since the guy loves cheese. Other than that, everything remained the same and WOW. I'm on a diet (sad) so I couldn't partake more than just a mouthful, but the fiancé is obsessed. Since the dish makes a very healthy portion of 8 servings (like...a lot of food in one serving if you really divide the dish into 8), he's set for dinner for the week. Sorry, Italian-Restaurant-Down-The-Street...I win! Thanks for the recipe!

I used Italian sausage instead of hamburger and while it was cooking I added 2 tsp of minced garlic, seasoned with Italian seasoning, oregano, season salt (lightly), red pepper flakes and pepper.  I also only baked it another 10 minutes to let the cheese I added to the top melt after removing the foil.  My husband really liked this dish and I now my kids will love it!

I made this recipe for my mother and boyfriend. I followed it exactly as written with one exception, I used ricotta in place of the cottage cheese. This is a filling, delicious dinner that is just as good the next day (and the day after. Thank you Calliko, this will be used over and over!

My whole family LOVES this recipe. This is a great go to dish when you don't know what else to make and don't feel like having plain old spaghetti. I use the cottage cheese just as the recipe calls for, but I used 48 oz of sauce, and used 3 eggs instead of just 2. There are two things I don't like about this dish.  1. I always feel like I use every pan in the cupboard so if you like one pot meals (I do) this isn't a good recipe for you. 2. I timed my prep time today and it took me a full hour to do everything.  I'm not slow and don't know why it takes me longer than 25 minutes, but be prepared. If you want to eat in an hour and a half, don't make this one.

We found this delish! I left out the onion since I despise them. Next time I'll nix the cottage cheese. Not sure if it was supposed to melt or not, but it was still curdy after cooking. I'll either leave it out or swap for ricotta.

This recipe was very easy and might I say very delicious. I was generous with the cheese and our guest really enjoyed it.  I will definitely cook again

This was really good & so easy to make. Kind of like lasagna without all that effort. I used sliced provolone as I did not have shredded mozzarella. Will make again

This was a hit with my picky Dad who doesn't like anything tomato-related. I omitted meat in the sauce mixture and instead used pepperoni in the layers. Cooked a double batch this time! Very easy to make, too.

We  loved it.  It made a lot, but we were able to freeze the leftovers. Making it again  this weekend for several family members.  I did buy a deeper dish  because my dish was running over.

The current recipe is too salty.  I dropped the salt, added 1 t Italian seasoning, dropped the cottage cheese, and added 2 C Monterey Jack cheese, then added 2 cans of mushrooms.  The recipe also overcooked the pasta.  Cook it for only 7 minutes, and it will finish cooking in the dish.  Also, brown the beef by itself, and not with the onion.  Cook the onion with a little garlic for 5 minutes, then assemble the dish, and cook for a total of 40 minutes.

I've made this a few times basically using what I have on hand.  I've used all chopped meat, combo of hot & sweet sausage, combo of meat and sausage.  I've also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and whatever sauce I have.  My favorite sauce is Emeril's Gaahlic. I use smaller pans so I can freeze one of them.  This comes out wonderful no matter what I use and it freezes well.

This was wonderful.  Even my picky eaters are asking me when I'm going to make it again.  I froze some of it and the parts I froze were great when I thawed them and ate them.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Cut back on the spaghetti for sure. 10-12oz is better. Try making this with ricotta or full curd cottage cheese and not low fat. Make your marina sauce too. I don't trust jar spaghetti sauce with tons of salt,sugar, and preservatives and it's too easy to make your own.

Delicious spaghetti! I think I've never tried cottage cheese before but it's great. The other two cheeses are a great addition. Overall the taste of this recipe is delicious, it smells and tastes unique and like it came out of a fine Italian restaurant.

Very good.   I made minor adjustments based on preference but overall followed the recipe for the most part.  I substituted half the hamburger for sausage and added a cup of fresh parsley.  Five stars due to taste,  ease of preparation, could be made ahead or frozen,  and the kids loved it.   Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this.  I did not use cottage cheese because I didn't have any and it turned out great!  I did not use all the butter that it called for and I sprinkled in some dried parsley on the spaghetti noodle mixture.

Overall a pretty easy dish but needs more seasoning.  The season salt added nothing so I'll try garlic powder or maybe cook fresh garlic with the onion and meat next time.

I had such high hopes for this recipe and followed it exactly.  The final product looked good and smelled great, but it was just 'too cheesy for us' ...  I agree with a reviewer who said it had a lot of noodles vs. meat sauce and cheese.  I don't think I'll make it again.  It's a shame as I was looking for a good potluck dish.

Love the recipe,already had leftover sauce with beef and some sausage meat in fridge. Made with ricotta because it was less money than cottage,even used the seasoned salt. Only really important change was the the cooking time of spaghetti. Learned it from years of using oven for pasta. Only cook the spaghetti for 5mins. It continues to cook a little while draining, then continues to cook in oven. If you like a mushy pasta then cook it for the 12min.some folks really do like it very soft.

Made this with chicken sausage and 3/4 lb of hamburger.  9 x 13 deep foil pan for easy clean up.  Cheapest GF spaghetti in the pantry a wee bit under cooked.  Add about 3/4 C extra sauce.  Only used parm and ricotta.  Layers like mac and cheese the Miller way.  Very good.

I have mde a very similar version to this recipe, and it is a great go-to recipe in-and-of-itself.  However, if you like your Italian with more flavor, you might try slicing some black and green olives into the spaghetti sauce, along wit a small can of tomato paste, and can of diced tomatoes.  I grew basil last year, and froze it at the end of the growing season.  One way I froze it was to put the leaves tightly wound into ice cube trays and had just a big of water.  Freeze the cubes,then take out however many cubes you need for a particular dish.  I might also add a little dried Italian seasoning in with the meat mixture for added flavor.  Again, if peole don't like things with a lot of flavor, skip these ideas.  Everybody's tastes are different.  Think it is a great concept and thanks for sharing!

This recipe is delicious! I used gluten free spiral pasta and it turned out great.  I added fresh garlic and topped it with a few sprinkles of parsley.

I did not make this exactly by the recipe because I wanted it healthier. I used Ezekial pasta (sprouted grain), 48 oz of sauce (sugar free), 1 lb grass fed ground beef, 8 oz mozzerella. I also added fresh mushrooms. I left out all of the butter and seasoned salt. I realized when I started eating it that I had forgotten to add the cottage cheese. I was really bummed about that. Next time I will add the cottage cheese and also some fresh herbs like parsley and basil, etc.  Makes a very large dish. I will try freezing it since it is just my husband and me.

I followed the recipe as close as I could based on the ingredients I had on hand, which was pretty close, and this turned out great. The changes I made were that I used 1lb of mild italian sausage instead of ground beef, I added 1/2 cup of diced bell papper, I only had 24oz spagetti sauce, so I added 8oz tomato sauce, 1tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp oregano,1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powderand 1 tsp corn starch (to thicken sauce). I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I have to start out by saying I don't like spaghetti. Last night my mom made a huge pot of it to feed (not tasty) an army for days for 3 people. So she freezes some  (yuck). So I remembered this bake or pie figured what a good way to transform left over spaghetti. loved it. thank you, to the creator of this recipe you saved me.

It was a great hit in my home.  The ONLY thing I did different was add Ricotta ILO cottage cheese, because I didn't have any in the fridge and I used onion powder ILO onions since my son won't eat anything that he can see or taste onions in!  Next time I will try the cottage cheese.  I was really surprised about the eggs, but I wouldn't cook this any other way.  It was definitely the best baked pasta recipe I've ever attempted.

I made this tonight for the first time following the recipe as written, except for the seasoned salt which I overlooked by accident.  I don't know what contribution it made because I didn't miss it at all.  My husband isn't a big fan of lasagne but he loved this.  It was so good, I wished I was still working so I could bring it to a potluck and blow everybody away.  I did use a full 24 oz jar of sauce plus half of another 24 oz jar, just moist enough.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this tonight. Due to ingredients on-hand made lots of changes. Used ground turkey instead of beef: combined a can of crushed tomatoes with a jar of alfredo sauce; used about 4 ounces of chicken stock to provide more moisture; used taco cheese and cheddar cheese along with about 6 ounces of a hard cheese in addition to the grated parmesan cheese. Cooked the whole thing for an hour covered, and then about 20 minutes uncovered. Was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was! Recipe is very flexible and forgiving.

I made this tonight and I thought it was delicious ??. The only thing I changed from the original receipe was I added more spaghetti sauce to make the dish more moist. My kids thought it tasted like lasagna. I did use cottage cheese and thought it was very flavorful.

Me and my family absolutely LOVED this recipe! Just a few minor changes only because I didn't have any cottage cheese and not a huge parmesan fan. I also didn't use the 4 cups of cheese that this recipe called for because it seems a bit excessive. Three was plenty. So for the cottage cheese I substituted light sour cream...and please, don't knock the fact that it is light, it's still good enough to be bad for you. Therefore it must be good right? :) For the parmesan, I just used the same cheese that I used for everything else, which was the Colby and Monterey mixed finely shredded cheese. I'm sure that you can use whatever you'd like, but I think that I would try and stay away from just plain old cheddar cheese...unless that's your thing. The biggest change was the Jimmy Dean regular sausage. Substituted that for the ground beef. Yum Yum! Hopefully you try and love it like we did, and you should get like 10-12 servings out of it. We're a family of 5 and still had over a half of  dish left. Remember that it is not dieting food at all, lol. But it is very good. Just remember to get back on track for the rest of the week...you'll be paying for this one! :)

Update!!! Bought some cottage cheese! 1% small curd low fat cottage cheese and added a little light sour cream for extra body. Awesome awesome, couldn't tell the difference, big calorie difference though.

If you did not use spaghetti sauce or hamburger, but just used bacon instead this would make a nice Carbonara like casserole.

Added diced tomatoes , ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and steak sauce to  meat and onions. Plus a little garlic. All to taste. Used Oregon double cheese red sauce. Used mozzarella and provolone cheese mix. Blended in Colby and pepper jack cheese. Also added feta on top. Turned out amazing.

Delicious! Only alterations were adding 1/4 cup of minced fresh parsley to the meat sauce and a little beef broth to increase the sauce amount as my handy jar of pasta sauce was 8 oz less than the recipe called for. That didn't really work out, because the broth rose to bubble above the top cheese layer while baking. So I was constantly absorbing the excess liquid with a paper towel. Still a great recipe!

This was GOOD! I had to make changes based on what I had in the fridge, and it still came out delectably! I don't eat beef, but the men in my house do. I had 2.25 lbs of hamburger meat and 1 lb of ground turkey, so I tripled everything to make 3 9x12s. Except I only had two eggs, 4 cups of cottaqe cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella and 4 cups of cheddar, so I went with what I had, and am so glad I did! 

I used 3 lbs of spaghetti, 12 tblsp of butter, and 1 cup of parmesan cheese, but only whisked in 2 eggs. Other reviewers are right: that step MAKES this dish, and it didn't hurt a thing that I didn't use enough eggs! 

Because I had bell peppers that needed to be used, I chopped them and sauted with the meat and onion, then added some minced garlic. I put a half cup of the sauce in the bottom of the 9x12 cause I'm used to doing that for lasagna, topped with a good portion of the spaghetti in each dish, spread sauce over the noodles, spooned 1/3 of the 4 cups of cottage cheese onto each dish, sprinkled 1/3 of the cheese available over that, laid the rest of the spaghetti evenly over each dish, and then added the last of the sauce over the top. Covered with foil as directed and baked for 40 minutes. 

It was delicious, even with my modifications! This is a great base recipe that you don't need to be afraid to change up to suit your taste.

This recipe was a hit here at our house! I made two changes to it, based on reviews and personal preference. I subbed the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese and the ground beef with Johnsonville Mild Italian Ground Sausage. This tasted great! The only complaint I have is the recipe calls for too much pasta in my opinion. I'd use maybe half of what it calls for next time.

Loved the way this turned out, subbed ricotta for cottage cheese.  Next time will probably sub ground Italian sausage for beef.

This looks so good, even the title makes my mouth water. I just wish is was vegan friendly. I will have to make this for my family though, it's different and we're always open to trying to new things! :) I'll give it a higher rating after I make it!

so we had this again tonight, I have tried this many ways from every ones comments and I have to say that I prefer it with the egg mixture, and tonight I even added a little cream cheese (I did not have enough ricotta cheese to make it) and still awesome. so go ahead and adjust this recipe to you liking because it is good anyway you fix it.

It was a great recipe! Worth the extra work of not having the same old spaghetti again. As we say in my house, this dish was "restaurant quality".

I thought this spaghetti was really good. I didn't think it could be with all the cheese in the recipe. Typically, this amount of cheese can overpower the flavor of the sauce and everything else for that matter. I am surprised at how delicious it tasted. I don't eat meat so I substituted the ground beef for vegan meatballs but everything else, I followed to the T, including the cottage cheese. I will be saving this to make at my next family function!

This is my quick go to recipe for guests or when making a meal to take to a friend. I do alter it by using ricotta instead of cottage cheese and I use angel hair instead of spaghetti. I also use 2 jars of sauce and mix everything together instead if layering. The extra sauce allows this recipe to stretch to 2 pans so I often freeze one for later.

Really enjoyed this. Substituted ricotta for cottage cheese and used olive oil in place of butter. Also added about a tablespoon of freeze-dried Italian herb blend to egg, parmesan, oil and spaghetti.

My grandsons love this recipe! Thank you Calliko for submitting it.  I omit the onion and use a tad more sauce (for a total of a jar and a half), but that's the only changes to a recipe that's always a hit at our house.
