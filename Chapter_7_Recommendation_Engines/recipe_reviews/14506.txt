I am a corn-on the-cob junkie and this method of preparation is by far the absolute best.  I didn't want to drag out the smoker so I just grilled them for 20 minutes.  I also pulled the husks down to remove the silk, and then just put the husks back in place.  This was just too "DIE" for!!!

Wow! I love cooking with beer and since there's never a shortage of that in this house I thought I'd give this recipe a try...I was pleasantly surprised. This really produces a great tasting BBQ'd corn. So, if you thought cookin' with beer was relegated to just meats - think again. I didn't use the smoker, but grilled it as always over charcoal and this came out fabulous. So, if you can part with your beer give this a try. You'll be glad you did!

We were JUST getting ready to grill when I saw this & it was SO easy!  This recipe helps you get rid of the "black gunk" that can get on corn when you grill - The husks not only protect from the "gunk" but they also hold the moisture in (and the beer helps!) so you get that yummy splash! when you bite into this yummy, crunchy corn! Happy summer!

I took this to our 4th of July party and it got mixed reviews. Some thought it tasted to much like beer. And some thought it was good.

Doug (also known as Kojak) has taught me many tricks with his smoker at his house that I've used on my charcoal grill at home, and this is one of them. If you use the right beer (something real dark, like Guinness Stout), it doesn't even need butter.

Another 5 star creation.  We used the cheapest beer we could find and the corn turned out great.  This is the only way to prepare fresh corn on the cob.

I tried this recipe along with Leslie's Salty Grilled Potatoes for Fathers Day.  I used my grill, using indirect heat by placing the coals along the front and the potatoes and corn in the back.  I started them together about 1 hour before I added more coals to begin cooking the steaks.  Timing was great...everything came out perfect.  For desert, I made grilled peaches marinated in rum, spices and brown sugar (recipe pending).  Excellent meal...Served with a great Shiraz.

I have no idea if the beer sweetened the corn or if it was just extremely good corn.  It was excellent.  I smoked it for 2 hours after overnight "icing."  I don't like to open the smoker and lose heat, so I only turned them once, but they were perfect.

We love beer so this was a great recipe for us to try. I bought hubby a smoker last year and we're always looking for ways to use it. This corn was wonderful and I not only thank you Doug, but "Noble Cook" too for his very informative reviews. Your profile explains it all. I love reading a "Chef's" point of view of various recipes. Hats off to both of you!

I don't like beer flavor so I used between 1/2 and 3/4 of the beer it called for.  But it turned out AWESOME, and everyone at our cookout said how great it was.  We did it on the smoker with the husks on, and it was the most perfectly cooked corn on the cob I have EVER, ever had!  Crisp, but soft enough.  Didn't even need butter or salt!

We usually soak ours for about 2 hours.  Then we take the husks off and wrap in foil with butter and lime!  They take about 20 minutes.  You'll smell the beer while they cook but you won't taste it.  The beer obviously tenderizes the corn.  This is the ONLY way we grill our corn now!

Wish I could say that we enjoyed this, but it just wasn't for us. We love grilled or smoked corn, but we couldn't even taste the smoked flavor because all it tasted like was beer.... and we like our beer! Thanks for sharing with us though :)

The end result was delightful.  Our guests were very impressed with the method, appearance & taste. Thank you.

This is really a good recipe for a big crowd. You won't have many leftovers as
everybody comes back for seconds. This recipe goes good with about anything you grill and is so easy.

I wasn't all that impressed with this recipe. It was okay but the beer didn't seem to add anything to the mix and seemed to me to be a waste of beer. In the past I've used sugar water which seemed to have more punch for the money, sweetness that saturated the corn than the beer.

Next time I am going to follow my gut and take off the husks of the corn.  Also not going to let them soak in the beer but rather dip them.  Way too much beer flavor and the corn was not moist but still crunchy after being on the smoker for almost an hour and a half and being turned every 20 minutes.
