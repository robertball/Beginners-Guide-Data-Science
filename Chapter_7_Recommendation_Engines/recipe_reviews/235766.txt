The dough came out very dry, especially after sitting for 2 days. I believe the dry air in Phoenix, AZ contributed to most of that. I drizzled with water which helped but the cookies did come out fairly dry regardless. They have a very mild flavor and a smidge of sweetness....now if I can figure out how to maintain moisture.
