My 8yo wanted to make these muffins for breakfast this coming week.  She and her dad made them.  So, we sampled them tonight.  They were delicious!  Easy to make and ingredients on hand.  We will be making them again.  Thank you!

Delicious muffins! Since this is the 1st review I'm going to post my experience even though I used a couple different ingredients. To make them vegan I used EnerG eggs instead, used melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and vanilla almond milk (reducing vanilla extract to 1 tsp and omitting the almond extract). These baked beautifully and they are moist and hearty. I suggest you use muffin liners, or grease and flour the nonstick pan, if you don't have cooking spray, since using olive oil made them stick badly in my first batch. The long bake time and 300F temperature worked perfectly. This made 16 normal size muffins for me. I will gladly make these again!
