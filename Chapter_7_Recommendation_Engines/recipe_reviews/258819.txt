2.24.20  I baked half a recipe and ended up with 29 munchies.  The recipe doesn’t tell you how much space to leave in between the cookies, but my recommendation would be no less than 2” or a bit more.  Some of mine did bake together, but that wasn’t a deal breaker.  They’re chewy, chocolaty with a little crunch from the pecans.  Quick, easy, fast cleanup, and I’d make again.  Thanks for sharing.
