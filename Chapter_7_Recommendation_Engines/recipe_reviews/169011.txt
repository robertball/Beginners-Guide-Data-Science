This recipe is great, as written.  I served it over hot thin spaghetti.  I used 10 ounces of spaghetti to feed the family and used only about 1/3 of the sauce.  It coated the spaghetti nicely.  This is like using basil pesto on spaghetti; pesto is also not a cooked sauce.  If you don't like garlic, then I would not make a "garlic sauce."  If it seems too dry for you when you add it to the pasta, you can always save a little bit of the pasta water and add it to the spaghetti after you have coated it with the sauce.  This is like many of the true Sicilian sauces that we serve in our Italian household.  Yum!

YUM! FAST! EASY!  I served the tossed pasta over a bed of saut√©ed veggies. Nice to have something new and garlicky for pasta. Thanks, Linda. Update: I used this for a pasta salad and it was great too! It coats everything with no drip (dry but NOT dry) and even after a few days in the fridge zero excess liquid means NO soggy veggies. The salad was eaten and enjoyed to the last bite instead of getting tossed due to being soggy. Thanks for sharing this gem!

OK I have mixed feelings on this. I agree with previous poster that this sauce benefits from being cooked. I tried it both as written with grilled chicken and hot tossed through spaghetti. The garlic was far too raw tasting & overpowering when not cooked. I ended up adding a lot more basil and topped my 'cooked sauce' with plenty of parma cheese.

This sauce is a long time family favourite from my Sicilian heritage. It can be very mild or very strong, depends on how much garlic you use. Spoon the pureed sauce over fried eggplant slices, top with parmesan cheese and bake OR toss through hot spaghetti OR spread on pizza bases OR use it as a dipping sauce OR on french sticks for toasted garlic bread. A very versatile sauce for lovers of garlic!

I can't believe more people haven't tried this.  It's like a hidden secret.  It has become a regular in my family.  My husband (who's an avid health, nutrition, and fitness advocate and an Italian) eats it by the spoonful.  I ALWAYS have to double it because it goes so fast.  You can add more garlic if you love garlic (like we do) or less garlic if you're a light weight.  There have been times when I forgot or didn't have certain ingredients like - parsley, or Olive oil.  It was still fantastic!  You can adjust this recipe to your likes and I don't think you can go wrong. 

I think it's also a perfect main course recipe for vegans and vegetarians.

Thank you Linda for sharing your recipe!

I doubled this recipe, and then put it over 16 ounces of pasta. I too felt I wouldn't like it cold, so it simmered on the stovetop until the rest of dinner was ready. It smelled great, so I had high hopes! It did not disappoint, it was awesome! Such a nice change to have the nuts in the sauce too! I am looking forward to leftovers tonight!

I didn't like this at all. It would be better if it simmers to let flavors blend better

Awesome! Was looking for a quick olive oil and garlic sauce to make in a hurry and this was even better! Didn't have whole almonds, so I used just under 3/4 of almond meal. Also, the recipe didn't indicate whether to use the juice in the can of tomatoes, but I did and it was perfect. Following other's lead, I cooked it a bit to tame the garlic a little. Served over spinach and cheese ravioli, topped with parmesan. This one is already saved in my recipe box! Thank you!!

Excellent as is.  The only thing I did differently is use half the salt the recipe called for.  I served it over hot spaghetti and it was perfect!

I love, love, love this recipe. Great for vegans too. The only thing I must say is that it is much better served over spinach noodles. Amazing. It is much better heated as well, I feel the ingredients infuse better. Great recipe, thank you!

This sauce has an amazing flavor!  The only thing I did differently was I omitted the canned tomatoes and used two and half large fresh tomatoes instead. This yielded a thicker yet fresher taste. This is a definite keeper, thank you so much for the recipe!

Delicious, quick, and EASY. I loved this, and I appreciate that even if it's high calorie, at least they are nutritious calories from the nuts and EVOO. I didn't add any salt and it honestly didn't need any - the flavor from the garlic was quite enough. I buy elephant garlic so I wasn't sure what the equivalent of seven cloves would be and I just ended up using about 70g of garlic - it was perfect! I like the strong garlic flavor and don't think it needs to be simmered, though I'm sure it's also delicious if you do choose to cook it a bit. I would definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing!

It was very tasty, however 7 cloves of garlic was too much. I love garlic and even this was too much for me. Next time I will cut it down to maybe 5 cloves

Loved the spice of the raw garlic in this sauce! I will definitely make this again. I am also curious as to how a bulb or two of roasted garlic would do in place of the raw. I probably would not try cooking the sauce though because I do not want to mellow the garlic flavor too much. In a garlic sauce the garlic should be the star!

Yummy!  I like that this recipe is vegetarian and healthy.  I tasted the sauce both before and after it was cooked.  Before:  it was spicy, and very strong.  I therefore chose to see how cooking would affect the flavor.  After:  rich, somewhat tangy and much more mellow.  I personally preferred the sauce after cooking.  Hint:  Be careful if cooking the sauce, because I left mine unattended for a quite a few minutes to cook down, and when I checked it the sauce had turned to more of a paste and the almonds had burnt on the bottom of the pan.  Next time I will be more careful to stir frequently.  Still, even with some of the sauce going to waste, it was tasty and I ate the rest.

Wow!  I'm a pretty good cook and I have to say this is one of the most wonderful recipes I have found. I used fresh plum tomatoes because I had so many and very fresh garlic.  You could put this on almost anything!  I'm serving it over cooked salmon and shrimp w/very little pasta.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Debbie

Delicious! I love garlic, but I used half the called for amount and thought it was perfect. The first time I made this, I tried using a hand-blender instead of a food processor, which didn't work. Go straight for the food processor!

Strong flavor but delicious. Easy to make - I was impressed with how good it was, yet very simple. I did simmer the sauce, then served over rotini.
