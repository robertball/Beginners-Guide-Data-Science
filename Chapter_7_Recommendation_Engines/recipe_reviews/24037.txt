I'm giving this five stars for this recipe w/ modifications. I think you will really love this if you try it the way I did!

I seasoned the chops w/ s,p, and garlic powder, then dredged in flour seasoned w/ pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and some Emrils all-purpose seasoning....&
browned in olive oil.

On the stove, I boiled the water w/ one large chicken bouillon cube, then reduced, and added one can of cream of mushroom soup. I wisked together about 4 T flour in some cold water and added it to this saice. I let this simmer a little.
Poured over chops and onions in crock pot. Right before it is finished, or even after it is done, then add 8 oz. sour cream and stir around. 
This was tasty, creamy and great served over wide egg noodles and freshly steamed green beans sprinkled w/ lemon pepper.
Hope this review helps someone. I think the blandness some complained of will be alliviated w/ the extra seasonings in the flour mixture and the cr. of mushroom soup!! Try it!

Being that I saw this recipe at the last minute, I couldn't use my slow cooker, so I just browned my chops in my cast iron skillet with the onions, removed the chops just long enough to make a roux, added two cups of chicken broth instead of the water and simmered for forty five minutes. After they were done I again removed them from the skillet and added the sour cream and cooked for a minute. They came out so tender and the sauce was excellent! Good one Ami!!

absolutly fabulous!  Bear with my changes, but I thought they might help someone else!  I used 5, two inch thick chops, seasoned with s,p,gp (salt, pepper, garlic powder), THEN I dreged them through highly seasoned flour (just use what you like).  I browned them in garlic infused oil.  I then browned the onions and put them on top of chops in crock pot.  For the sauce, I used 2 cups cx. broth, seasoned with fresh garlic, paprika, s,p,gp, and few other random things, and 1 can cream of mushroom soup.  Poured it over chops and cooked on LOW for 5 hours...could have just been 4 hours though.  Last, I added sauteed fresh mushrooms and the sour cream after moving chops to oven.  I think I should have used only 4 oz. sour cream though.  It was perfectly thick and very rich!  We loved it!

I hate when people make so many changes and then rate the recipe. I didn't change a thing. I made the recipe AS IS and it was a really great quick and easy meal. I served it with rice and my family loved it. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a HUGE hit with my family.  I took heed of the reviews that claimed it was low on flavor and added a few changes.  My first change was that I coated the pork chops in roasted garlic and red pepper spice mix and THEN dredeged them in flour and browned them.  Then I cut the onions along with some quartered mushrooms and sliced a red pepper.  I carmelized all of these in a pan with a little olive oil.  YUM.  Then I followed the directions exactly except for the end where I noticed the sauce wasn't as thick as I would like.  I had no cream of mushroom soup so I threw in some cream cheese.  It was thick and flavorful and delicious!

Maybe I shouldn't give this 5 stars, since I changed it so much, but my kids and hubby loved this recipe.  I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I did everything in a skillet on top of the stove.  I used chicken broth rather than bouillon cubes, and I left out the flour.  After simmering for a while, I took off the lid and the sauce thickened up nicely without flour (and since I'm on a low carb diet, it worked better for me).  I browned one chopped onion and a can of mushrooms along with the unbreaded breakfast-style boneless chops in the skillet, drained away what little olive oil I used, then mixed the broth and sour cream along with the spices I usually use for pork chops.  After simmering for about 25 minutes, I added a splash of balsamic vinegar just to deepen the flavors.  There wasn't a drop of this sauce left, or a scrap of meat.

Delicious! The sauce was the best but I did make a few changes. I was crunched for time so just threw the chops, seasonings etc... in the slow cooker without drenching in flour or browning. Later when I made the sauce I just added a little more flour. Didn't really think that extra step was needed.

I have to give this a five star rating, b/c I messed it up and it still came out great! I didnt read the recipe through and started to prepare it at 5pm. Of course, when I got to the crock pot part, I knew I had to change it. I browned the chops as directed and cooked the onions until they were soft. I transfered chops to a glass casserole dish and put onions on each chop. Then I added the bullion/water mixture over all and baked for 30 minutes at 400. After I drained the juice and added to a small pot, stirring in the 2 tbsp of flour and cooking for 5 mins. I poured over chops and my husband thought it was delicious. (he hates sour cream as well but had no idea, like other reviewers families ;)

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  My entire family loved the tenderness of the chops and the richness of the gravy.  After I browned the chops, I poured the water/bullion cube mixture into the pan and stirred up the browned bits.  Hate to waste that extra flavor!  Yum

WOW! My husband and I LOVED these pork chops! I usually go by the recipe exactly the first time I make it but I had to make a couple changes to this one to save time. I did not coat the pork chops in flour and fry them in oil before putting them in the slow cooker, I simply coated them with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder and put them straight in the slow cooker. I followed the rest of the directions and when they were done cooking I did not put them in the oven on 200, that will only dry them out. I put them in a dish with a bit of the juice from the crock pot. Then I took all the juice/onions from the crock pot and put it in a small saucepan and added the flour/sour cream and cooked on medium heat while stirring, this was MUCH quicker than waiting for it to thicken up in the crock pot! I also added some extra seasoning to the sauce. They were delicious! I will be making this recipe on a regular basis!

Slow cooked these with extra can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 # fresh mushroomss,using chicken stock rather than bouillon.  Turned out great. I've been trying different chop recipes since my b/f told me he doesn't like them.  Will make a believer of him yet! Hey, I lived in IOWA....  This is a start. Thanks.

I used McCormic Garlic Pepper to season the chops and fried them lightly without using flour. I cooked them on high in the crock-pot for 4 hours.(They were tender at this point but not falling apart.) I put the pork chops on a plate and then dumped all the liquid from the crock- pot into a sauce pan.  I added a packet of Mushroom gray mix and brought to a boil stirring continuously. After that I put the pork chops back in the crock-pot and poured the sauce over top and cooked on low for another 3 hours. MMMMMMMMMMM - Delicious!  The pork chops fell apart and mixed with the gravy.  I served it over mashed potatoes. My husband made an open-faced sandwhich.  Perfect comfort food for a cold night!

This recipe is great as written!! Most of the time I skip the whole browning process though. I season the chops or pork steaks with salt, pepper, garlic powder, emerils or seasoning salt. I layer the onions starting with onions on the bottom and between the layers of chops. I use chicken broth from a box and pour in without heating. I start it out on high for two or three hours and finish it on low about 5 hours. I remove the chops and keep warm in oven while I prepare the sauce. I strain the broth into a sauce pan then add the sour cream and flour or corn starch and heat and stir until thickened. Comes out beautiful without lumps. I then pour some of the sauce over the chops and save the rest for rice or noodles. I love serving this with rice,  greens, blackeyed peas or beans and corn bread muffins. It is a great comfort food meal with a down home feel!! My whole family loves this!!

Easy! Kids liked, husband liked, I liked!  I did need to add more flour to thicken the sauce but other than that I followed the recipe and won't change a thing next time either.  Chops were so tender!!

I have been making this recipe for years, it's delicious and worth a 5 star rating!  I add a few spices to the sauce because it's a bit bland.  I add ground black pepper and a little garlic powder to the sauce.  Other than that I make it as written.  It's easy and very yummy!

These were super tasty and moist. I followed the ingredient list, but I did have to alter the cooking method. I browned the chops on the stove in some olive oil with the onions. I removed the onions and chops after browning so I could make a rue with 2 tbsp flour and 2 tbsp butter. I then added the pork chops back in with the onions. I then added the chicken bouillon / water mixture. I cooked on the stovetop on medium low for 45 minutes. After finished cooking I removed the chops and added the sour cream to the sauce. Not a single drop of the sauce or chops were left. Very good recipe.

These chops came out absolutely amazing!  It is now one of our favorite dishes.  I also made a few changes based on the other reviews.  I seasoned the pork chops with seasoning salt, dredged in flour and then browned them in a little olive oil and added fresh garlic.  I moved them to the crock pot and threw in chopped onioins, a can of cream of mushroom soup and a combination of chicken and beef broth (2 cups total; didn't have enough of one to do all the same).   I cooked it on high for 6 hrs and then added the light sour cream right in without removing the chops.  I cooked them another 30 mins in the sauce and then served them over egg noodles.  They were moist, flavorful and falling apart.  My husband just raved about them!

This is a wonderful recipe! Good enough for a company dinner. I basically took some of the other suggestions and made them my own. One suggestion is to use boneless pork chops and then to cut all visible fat from them prior to cooking them. The chops become so tender that they do fall right off the bone. Then you are left with all these little bone fragments in the sauce along with the fat that has detached from the meat. Next time I will take care of that in advance by using boneless chops and cutting off fat first. I too seasoned chops. I used Santa Maria Style Seasoning which is just salt, pepper, garlic, and parsley. Then I dredged the chops in flour that I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and paprika. Lightly fried them on each side in a combo of olive oil/butter. Boiled my water and disolved the chicken cube and then added one can cream of mushroom soup to chicken broth. Heated and stirred until creamy. I sliced my onion and sauted it in the pan juices where I had fried the chops after I removed them to the crock pot. Then added the softened onions to the chicken/mushroom soup mixture and stirred until creamy. I then poured the chicken broth/mushroom soup/ onion mixture over the chops in the crock pot and cooked it on low for about 7 hours. They were probably done after about 5 hours. Served over rice. Delicious!

I didn't enjoy the sour cream flavor in this dish,but my bf does. I'll stick to the way I usually make it,with my pork chops breaded,baked,then add cream of mushroom soup and milk the pork chops,then baked again.It's very mouth- watering this way

Easy recipe for a mom on the go.  Started this on my lunch break and was ready by the time I got home.  The kids loved it.  I thought the flavors were fine so long as you season your chops they way you like.  We ate with california blend veggies and brown rice. (didn't have time for mashed potatoes).

Great Recipe....I've never made more tender pork chops EVER!  I loved using my slow cooker and have never used sour cream with pork chops, but our family loved it....including my 5yr old daughter.  The second time I made this I seasoned the chops w/ plenty garlic powder, added  1/4 cup white wine and used only  half the  sour cream and we thought it was AMAZING!      Thanks!

This was the advice I followed from another user!  I'm giving this five stars for this recipe w/ modifications. I think you will really love this if you try it the way I did! I seasoned the chops w/ s,p, and garlic powder, then dredged in flour seasoned w/ pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and some Emrils all-purpose seasoning....& browned in olive oil. On the stove, I boiled the water w/ one large chicken bouillon cube, then reduced, and added one can of cream of mushroom soup. I wisked together about 4 T flour in some cold water and added it to the sauce.  I added it all to the slow cooker with half an onion diced into small pieces.  I also added a can of drained mushrooms.  My family LOVED this one!!

My family was very pleased. I'm a novice "cooker" and this is the first time I successfully made pork chops in the slow cooker. They were very tender, fell apart with just a fork. My gravy was pretty runny, but very flavorful. The next time I make it, I think I'll just transfer the juices to the stovetop to make the gravy. I think that will help thicken it up more. Also, I combined all of the dry ingredients for dredging. I felt like it saved a step and also distributed the flavors. I added dried mustard as well. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Delicious!  And a great way to fix pork chops without thoroughly frying them on stovetop.   I used 8 boneless butterfly chops, slow-cooked them on High for 4 hours, though I think next time, I'll see if they're done at 3 hours.  They were falling-apart tender, but just a wee bit on the dry side, but the gravy was outstanding, and had lots of if (we like a lot of gravy).  I used 2 cups of chicken broth for the bouillon and water, and 3 tbsp flour.  If you like it a bit more tangy, double the sour cream.  We served it with mashed potatoes (put some of the gravy on) and green beans.  There was so much gravy left over after the chops were eaten, my boyfriend sopped it up with some bread and finished it off!  Thanks for a good recipe.

The sauce on these is really good DH and DS loved it!  I didn't use bouillon (not a fan), I just used canned chicken broth instead of bouillon and water, I also mixed it with a can of mushroom soup as recommended by others.  I caramelized my onion before adding it to crock pot, and I sauteed some mushrooms and added them with the flour and sour cream to finish.  I also cooked these for 4 hours on high (didn't get them in earlier), and they turned out great!

I followed advice of other reviewers and spiced up the flour with garlic powder, paprika and pepper. I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the bouillon water and let it thicken before i poured it over the chops. I added an 8 oz. container of sliced fresh mushrooms as well. It was AMAZING! I cooked it for 4 hours on low and 1 hour on high and it was so tender but didn't fall apart so it turned out to be the perfect timing. This is a keeper!

These were so easy and so good.  I did mine in the oven at 400 degrees for about an hour since I didn't plan ahead.  Had company for dinner that night and go rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  A definite keeper!

I've been making this recipe for years, served with mashed potatoes.  Sometimes I change it up by adding the mushroom soup and occasionally I replace a part of the water with sherry.  It's also wonderful with chicken.  My family loves and requests this deliciousness.

Can do stove top; faster - This is a variation of one of my Mother's standard dishes I grew up with. To do stove top, simmer about 45 minutes to one hour or until desired tenderness instead of slow cooker. I use low sodium canned chicken broth. Excellent!!!

I did rate this even tho l have not tried iit yet because  it was the only way I could write my opinion--however after several weeks on this site l have to speak out.  Why does  almost everyone change the recipe into something totally different then have the  nerve to rate it.  There are several recipes made with mushroom soup and pork chops on this site so why change tthis one.  Obviously it was meant to give a different spin on pork chops by the original  submitter .----Just sayin----

Like other reviewers, I added cream of mushroom soup.  I also threw in some mushrooms, as we love them.  I only had about six hours, so I cooked on high for two and then low for four.  My chops were so tender they broke apart.  I mixed half the sauce into rice, put the chops on top, and covered them with more sauce.  My boyfriend had three helpings last night, and then ate more for lunch today!  He's asked me to make this often.  Thanks!  UPDATE:  Since the first time I've made this, I realize that the mushroom soup is completely useless.  The sour cream makes a perfectly creamy sauce all on it's own.  I make only two alterations:  instead of using boiling water and chicken bouillon, I use two cups of hot stock (chicken OR beef, they both work great) and I still add mushrooms.  This is an A+ recipe and works every time!

This was actually very good.  Not too many changes since I prefer to follow the directions as given.  I do like to read other reviews first and then make changes that I think would be beneficial to avoid wasting time (i.e., bland, too watery, etc.).  I  seasoned the flour with a pretty good amount of salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Dredged boneless pork chops (with fat on) in the seasoned flour and cooked in skillet with a little olive oil/butter mix, until lightly browned.  Mixed 1 c. beef broth and 1 c. chicken broth (I think beef broth adds a little more flavor), together with 1/2 to 3/4 can of cream of mushroom soup and added to slow cooker and stirred until smooth.  Add pork  chops.  Then, rather than just add the sliced onions I put them in the same skillet I used to brown the chops and cooked a few minutes until softened (add a tbsp. of broth to loosen any bits of pork still on the bottom of pan).  Add them to the slow cooker, stir, and cook on low for 7-8 hrs.  When finished, I placed the pork chops on a dish and kept warm in the oven.  I then placed the juice from the slow cooker, including onions, into a sauce pan, added approx. 4 oz. sour cream and approx. 2 tbsp. flour and heated until thickened to my liking.   Served with extra wide egg noodles.  Everyone agreed it was very flavorful without being a heavy dish. You can always add additional salt, pepper or garlic powder if needed.  Rather than using the full amount of sour cream, I chose to use half the sour cre

So good! it's just me and my husband so i halved the recipe--three bone-in pork chops plus the recipe as written essentially. I dredged the pork chops with s&p, flour, dried thyme and garlic powder, browned them and cooked for 4 hours on high with an onion and chicken broth (instead of bouillon). I did sub plain Greek yoghurt as we were out of sour cream and added s&p plus some thyme and garlic powder as an earlier taste test seemed a bit bland. Amazing. The pork was SO tender and the sauce was tasty and tangy but nice and smooth. Use a whisk, not a spoon, as my husband was wierded out by any unincorporated yoghurt/sour cream. Highly recommended! We will make again, esp. with mashed potatoes to go with the yummy sauce.

I was not a fan of these pork chops.  The sour cream taste was way too overwhelming, it truly overpowered all other spices.  I would not make this recipe again.

After reading all the reviews I seasoned my pork chops with Tony's, garlic, pepper, sea salt, and onion powder, and used low sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon cube. I cooked these on high for 1 1/2 hours and they were completely cooked. I removed the chops and covered them with foil then added the sour cream. The sauce thickened up after 15 minutes and was very tasty! I served with egg noodles. I guess I expected it to taste different, but it tasted like pork chop stoganoff. It was a hit, but not what I expected as far as flavor.

So, this was a waste of ingriedients... I made this recipe due to the reviews but was really dissapointed the chicken bouillon makes this really salty, but it was salty and bland at the same time due to the lack of flavor/seasoning. My husband said it tasted exactly like an MRE (Meal Ready To Eat which soldiers eat out in the field kind of like canned food- horrible)  :( the only reason i gave it two stars is because the meat was tender.

The sauce was really good, but the meat was still a little tough, even after cooking in the slow cooker.  In response to some reviews, I added about 3 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce to the broth.  I also added seasoning salt to the flour before dredging the pork chops in them.  Finally, I carmelized the onions before adding them.  I liked all of those touches, and the sauce was very good and savory.

Made this yesterday for my family. Based on many reviews I added the can of cream of mushroom soup; otherwise I made no changes. The dish was delicious: creamy but not too rich, filling, and very, very easy. Served it over wide egg noodles. Filled the slow cooker with the browned chops on a Saturday night and set it to simmer on low before leaving for church. Based on many years of using a slow cooker, I reduced the cooking time to about 6 hours and 15 minutes. Even though the crockery was frig cold when I turned it on, the chops came out fork tender but not falling apart in a shredded mess. My family loved this recipe. I will definitely make it again. This is comfort food at its best,  mainly because everyone loved it and it was soooooo easy to make.

bought pork steaks b/c they looked great and were super cheap...but i had no idea what to do with them!  this recipe was perfect. the steaks were fall apart tender - just the way i like them.  added 2 cloves garlic, a half to 1 cup of apple juice and some extra broth in order to make up for the extra #'s of meat.  will def. use the apple juice again!  DH threw out the 5 star rating and that barely ever happens!

I followed the ingredients, but did these on the stove top, simmered on low for a little over an hour, then added the sour cream with flour and thickened and cooked another 10 minutes or so until the gravy was the right thickness. I threw in a can of mushrooms as well. The chops cooked to a perfect tenderness and at the end I added a little more seasoning to the gravy to our taste and it was really delicious and enjoyed by all! :)

So good! My kids ate it up so quick...even the onions which I just put on their plate for the heck of it! I was shocked :). My husband told me to add it to my normal rotation. I served this with green beans and rice pilaf. Great recipe, thanks!!
UPDATE: I made these again leaving out the sour cream, and they were still delicious!  The creamy sauce is great, but we like the simple version as well.

The Pork chops themselves rate 10 stars! Used 6 thick boneless chops, seasoned with garlic salt and lots of pepper, floured and fried till nice and brown. Followed instructions, except added 3 large gloves of chopped minced garlic, from my garden springs of Rosemary, Thyme and Sage. Did not have time to cook on low for 7-8 hours, so I cooked on high for first couple of hours and then turned down to low, cooked for 5 hours total and it was perfect.   Removed the fresh herb sprigs and leaves, and the chops as directed, tasted juices and it was very flavorful, but felt it needed some richness so I added one beef bouillon and it was perfect!   Added the sour cream as directed, thickened to desired thickness. The chops on the plate without the sauce were beautiful and delicious. I wish I had not added the sour cream because the juices were so good without it, I think I would have preferred the simple richness of a good gravy. But then it would not be called Sour Cream Pork Chops!   Overall, the best pork chops I ever made or ever tasted and yes, yes, yes, this will be my basic pork chop recipe forever more! Thank You!

THIS WAS MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED!!! I only had about 2 hours to cook dinner so I skipped the crockpot method and went directly to the stove. I first carmelized the onions, then added sour cream, water, chicken bouillon, and canned mushroom and let simmer until sauce decreased by half. Then I added some cornstarch to thicken sauce. I then seasoned the pork with minced garlic and onion, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. After that, I seared the pork and topped with sauce. Served with noodles. Next time I'll have to use the crockpot because this was SO GOOD even with the modifications. ***UPDATE*** After using the suggested method of cooking, I found the sauce to be bland. Next time, I think I might add some chicken granules or seasong when I'm thickening the sauce.

Wow! We followed directions to a t. The pork chops were unbelievably tender! We served the pork chops over garlic mashed potatoes with the gravy poured over the top! Wonderful! Next time we are going to serve it over pork stuffing! This was very good!

I substituted chicken broth for the water/boullion, otherwise followed exactly. It tasted OK, but was too bland.  My fiance hardly ate his.  I chose not to add the cream soup that others suggested because I was looking for something different (I always do that w/ pork chops in the crock pot)  Not a keeper for me, I threw the leftovers out.

Mine didn't turn out well, but I think it was my fault for leaving in crock pot too long.  My chops were very dry.  Loved the sauce.  Had trouble getting it to thicken.  none-the-less, a good sauce. Wonder if I got to them at the right time if they wouldn't have been dry.

These are amazing. I almost always find pork to be dry or tough, but these were tender and juicy! I served them over rice and can't wait to try them again over egg noodles.

Awesome! I added some breadcrumbs to the flour for a little extra seasoning, and added mushrooms to the gravy.

Husband said five stars. I skipped the browning before putting into the crock pot because I was short on time. I'll brown next time...but the recipe was still good.

My family really liked this and very easy.  Most moist pork roast I've ever had.  I used a frozen pork loin, as I needed it to be able to cook all day while at work as was afraid the chops would dry out.  Seasoned it with old bay, garlic powder, pepper, and onion powder.  Used 1cup chicken broth and a little cooking wine.  Once done, I strained the juice and then added about 4oz sour cream, 1T flour and cooked in a pan.  Awesome over potatoes.

I didn't slow  cook...did it slowly in deep fry pan with high sides.  Delish!!  I put a bit of onion powder into my flour mixture along with salt & pepper.  Cooked on top of stove about 45min plus. Very nice and tender, hubby loved them.  thank you very much.

This was great!  I left it cooking overnight and woke up to delicious smells in my kitchen.  The pork was sooo soft and tender, the flavors were unbelievable.  Next time, i will leave out the sour cream, because it was thick enough and good tasting without it.

I too used mushroom soup, but used Golden Mushroom Soup mixed with about 3/4 can of skim milk and 1/2 cup cream cheese. I sauteed a sliced onion and a small package of Baby Bella mushrooms, put them in the pot first. Seasoned 4 2-inch pork chops with McCormicks Montreal Steak Seasoning and browned them. Added them to the pot, then the sauce over all. After 4 hours (half on high, half on med.) the chops were perfect, but the sauce was too thin, so I scooped most of into a sauce pan and boiled it for 30 minutes with 2 T. flour/water mixture.  That thickened it up nicely, so then I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and back into the pot with the chops.  It was very very tasty, and there is enough sauce left with the 2 extra chops to serve again with noodles or smashed potatoes. Great recipe.

Loved this recipe!! Can't believe the flavor that is achieved with such simple ingredients. The sauce is to die for!! Followed the recipe except I was short on time so I cooked it in my cast iron casserole in the oven. 250 for 3 1/2 hrs. 200 for 1 hour. Got raves!!

These were great, only problem I had was the sauce wouldnt thicken in the crockpot, so i had to put it in a sauce pot with 2 tblspoons of cron starch to make more of a gravy consistency.  Served mashed potatoes on the side, perfect!!

These are soooooo GOOD.  I did add a can of cream of mushrooms and fresh mushrooms.  I think next time I will reduce the water to 1C. so the gravy is thicker! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! You can make this in less than 15 min by using pork cutlets and 1 pan on the stovetop.  Use a plastic bag to combine flour and seasonings, and then shake to coat pork chops.  Brown in pan with cooking spray and a little butter/margarine.  Once browned on both sides, add broth (I used chicken b/c its what I had on hand) and let simmer.  I added mushrooms here too (if using onions, do before). Then pull off heat once chops are cooked and stir in sour cream.  Serve!  PS-save flour from bag and use it to thicken your broth before you stir in sour cream.  Goes grat with crusty bread, rice, or noodles for extra sauce.

UPDATED REVIEW:  I made this recipe again, followed recipe exactly.  I seemed to not care for it the first time I made it.  This time, I upgraded it to 3 stars.  The sauce is indeed lacking of flavor.  Since it is so easy to make, I might try one more time but bump up the salt. The meat fell off the bones again.  OLD REVIEW:  I made recipe as is, and I did not like this at all.  Instead of boullion cubes, I used 2 cups canned low-sodium broth topped off with a splash of white wine and boneless 3/4 inch chops.  The meat was indeed very tender (I turned the crock off after 5 1/2 hours on low given previous comments about the meat falling apart).  Good move.  Though the meat was tender, the sauce was overwhelmingly lacking.  I won't be making this again.  I gave this 2 stars because of how tender the meat was.  Otherwise, I would have given it one star.

I loved it and my husband begs for it regularly! I modified by mixing cream of mushroom soup with chicken broth with some spices and poured it over my browned pork chops and softened onions. I only used 4 ounces of sour cream because it came out so thick! Great served with mashed potatoes and Paula Deen's green beans!

We love this!  I have tried it with the cream of mushroom soup in the gravy and without- I think we like it with as it makes things a bit thicker.  The pork chops are falling off the bone so you do have to be careful transferring them to the oven.  Good over rice or egg noodles and leftovers were wonderful (discarded the bones before I stored the pork with the gravy).

Needed more flavor - I tossed in a few more chicken bullions, extra sour cream, and also some peas.  I served it over white rice.

My family loves this.  They like the way the meat just melts in your mouth.  You can also add mushrooms and green pepper for more flavor, if you like.  I prepare the sauce on the stove instead of waiting for it to cook in the crock pot.  I find I can thicken the sauce better and more quickly that way.

While I ended up with a good result, I think the recipe needs tweaking. I recognize that 'flavor' is subjective and as written this wouldn't have enough for us. I seasoned the flour that I dredged the pork in as well as seasoning the chops themselves. I think the browning step is important because it seals flavor into the meat before adding any liquid to it.  I sliced and added an 8 oz package of crimini mushrooms after an hour of cooking which also added flavor to the sauce as they cooked down. I think the timing in the instructions is way off and would end up overcooking the meat.  I cooked the chops for 4 hours on low. They were tender but still held their shape and were not dry at all. I also think the advice of putting them in the oven is not wise and would result in some drying out. Instead, I piled these on a plate and covered them tightly with foil while thickening the sauce. I chose this recipe specifically because it did NOT call for Cream of Anything soup so I followed the instructions for this part. While my sauce did thicken up, I do understand why you would choose the stove top route if you were in a hurry. I wasn't, so after thickening the sauce I ended up adding a bit more sour cream and a good solid helping of dill weed to give it more flavor. I nestled the chops back in the sauce and left the crock pot on warm for another hour until serving. The sour cream and dill flavor really worked for us - a little reminiscent of a stroganoff.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. I took some advice from other reviews and made a few changes. I added seasoning salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, and cayenne to the flour mixture. I also sauteed the onions before putting them in the crockpot. When I made the sour cream mixture I added a little garlic powder and pepper. The sauce was great over egg noodles. My husband can't stand sour cream and he said this was one of the best meals I've made using pork chops and that he'd eat them again. Definitely a keeper.

I am not a big fan of pork chops myself and this is one of the best chops I have ever had.  I think next time I will let my sauce thicken just a little more.  but I followed the directions exactly but only with 3 pork chops since there is only 3 of us.

YUM!  I didn't have an onion, so I added some onion powder to the flour.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  These were fantastic!  They were perfectly moist, tender and tasty.  I will be making these again.  Thanks, AMI!!

This is similar to a baked Sour Cream Chicken recipe I've used for years. For those who found this pork chop recipe bland, here is the chicken recipe which has a few more flavor ideas you might try: 1 1/2c plain yogurt or sour cream, 1/4 c lemon juice, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1 garlic clove, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper; marinate overnight, coat with bread crumbs and bake at 350 for 45 min.

Yum! I probably shouldn't rate this since I did a few things differently. I pulled what I thought was a small roast out of the freezer and after defrosting I found that it was 3 meaty pork steaks. It was a little late to use the slow cooker so I shook my steaks in a plastic bag with flour and the seasonings. I browned them and the onion in my cast iron skillet and seasoned them again with a garlic herb seasoning. I then added two cans of chicken broth and simmered it for about 45 minutes or so. I removed the meat and I shook in a little of the superfine, quick mixing flour and whisked it along with the sour cream and then put the meat back in. The gravy was excellent! I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. With pork steaks being so fatty, it was so tender and along with the sour cream it wasn't exactly lo-cal but it was delicious and 
so quick and easy. Thank you AMI.

I've just started cooking and eating pork chops after finally recovering from a childhood of dry tough chops.  This was great, my boyfriend loved it.  I added rosemary and thyme after reading reviews that it was a little bland and served over egg noodles.  I will definitely be making this again!

A keeper - will definitely make again!  As a previous reviewer, I only found this recipe a few hours before it was time to cook the chops so no time to use slow cooker.  Following instructions for flouring and browning, then added approx 1 cup of chicken stock (for 4 chops) with a good sprinkling of onion flakes (neither my husband nor I can eat 'real' onion anymore).  Simmered, covered, for 45 minutes on stove, removed the chops to a warm oven and added about 1/2 fat free sour cream and 1 tbsp flour mixed with a little sour cream to the pan.  They turned out wonderfully!  Served the sauce over the chops and potatoes and have enough for another meal.  Much prefer this sauce to ones based on "cream of ..." soups.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Wonderful dinner.  I did not have time to make these in the crock pot so I made them on the stove top.  Followed all directions just used my deep skillet & lid on low heat till cooked.  I do read reviews so for some extra added kick I used Emeril's Essence in the flour dredge, some paprika in the gravy and served over the spaetzle I usually make for chicken paprikash.  Everyone loved it, will certainly make again!

These are so simply and tasty.  Only change was to use half as much onion and added potatoes and carrots for a full meal.  The gravy is very good.  My whole family enjoyed this meal.

Holly Mack these were awesome. Most tender pork chops I ever made they were falling apart. I followe the recipe exact and made rice with it. If you like pork this is a great recipe to make. I think you can use chicken for this recipe as well. Thank you. Judy

AWESOME!!!  So tasty, the more garlic, salt and pepper you season the chops with, the more flavor the sauce will have later.  Tasted like a roast almost!  Never had pork chops this good!  Will make again!

Like some of the other reviewers, I was forced to try this recipe in the oven, due to lack of time.  My chops were thick cut, and 30 minutes at 400 degrees didn't give me the "falling apart" result I was hoping for.  Next time, I'll plan ahead for the slow cooker, or maybe an hour in the oven at 325.  As for taste...EXCELLENT!!!  We don't need a lot of the extra seasoning some people crave...the salt, pepper and garlic powder were enough.  And I was  so surprised at how often during the meal my family complimented the sauce.  I will definitely make this one of my stand-by recipes!

Awesome, awesome, awesome! One of the most simple and easy recipes I have come across in awhile. I have two boys under the age of 3 so this is perfect for me. I did not find it bland at all but did have to add some extra flour to make the sauce thick enough for me. I will be sharing this with all my friends.

Great recipe - even if you don't make the creamy sause to go over chops and noodles, this is a fantastic way to make pork chops so they do not dry out.  Thanks!

This meal was fantastic! It was quick and easy, and was nice to come home to after work. Very hearty, rich and satisfying. And I actually learned something: Who would have thought to mix flour with sour cream? That's just great! The second time I made it, I did make two additions: I'm a huge fan of garlic, so I added 5 smashed cloves to the slow cooker at the start, and sprinkled on some grated Parmesan after plating. These additions really added something.

I never liked pork chops till I tried this recipe. These are the best! I followed the recipe with no modifications and make egg noodles for the extra sauce.

Fantastic! Im not really a pork chop fan bec it always turns out dry. This was my first time making it in the slow-cooker and it was soo tender. The first step I kept the same (except added basil). 2nd I sauted the onion than added the water and cube. Put broth in pot and on low for 4 hours. I took about a cup of broth out of cooker mixed cream of mush,sour cream,mushrooms, squeezed half a lemon and seasoned. Than put on top of chops. I had with mashed potatoes and carrots. I really liked this and am going to make again. I will always do my chops in the slow cooker from now on.:::UPDATE::: Made this again bec I liked it soo much! There was a sale on Pork Chops. I didnt think they differ too much. I bought Sirlion Pork Chops and made this again exactly as stated and It turned out really dry!! Will def never buy Sirlion Chops again:( Im going to stick with bone-in regular Chops!!

I wanted to try this as written even though many of the reviews have added changes.  I think the original recipe is very good . I did season heavily, however.   I found it easier at the end to remove the juices from the crockpot and make the gravy in a pan while keeping the pork warm inside the crockpot.  That way you don't have to wait so long for the gravy to get done.  I think I would also add more flour to the sauce, it was a bit thin.  Very tasty.  Just make sure to use enough seasonings in step 1.

My family wasn't blown away by this recipe. They ate it, but no one had anything (positive or negative) to say about it. I thought it was a little on the boring side, myself. Not something I'd be excited about repeating.

Not only were the pork chops dry and flavorless, but the appearance of the sauce was awful. The sour cream had separated... I won't even tell you what it looked like.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I did not feel that the sauce was bland.  I used fat-free sour cream and the sauce had a tangy light sour cream flavor which was enough for me.  I do not want a sauce that overpowers just compliments.  I did make sure to generously season the pork chops before dredging in the flour.  I did not feel like using my slowcooker so I baked them according to another pork chop recipe I have.  I used 1 can chicken broth instead of the bouillon and baked them for 45 minutes in a 350 oven.  After removing the chops from the broth, I sprinkled some mozzarella cheese on top.  Served noodles and cauliflower on the side.  I spooned some of the sauce over the noodles and since the meal was very white I sprinkled some chives over the noodles.  I really enjoyed this and my husband went back for seconds so I will definitely make this again.  My 2 boys 5 and 3 ate without complaint.

Holy YUMMY!!  I wanted these for dinner tonight, so the 3 kiddies and I ran to the store at 4 and sat down to dinner at 6!  Obviously didn't use the slow cooker, just a cast iron pot, browned them in olive oil and butter, deglazed the pot with a little red wine, more butter, added the water, can of mushroom soup, onion, dumped the chops back in, and simmered while the rest of my meal cooked.  Near the end I took the meat out, added the sour cream, and some flour to thicken it back up, and served over egg noodles, with baked apples and brown sugar and maple carrots!  Awesome meal, I'm for sure gonna have to skip the ice cream tonight!

Yes the pork chops were juicy and tender! However the onions were overpowering for my taste and some still slightly crunchy.
Next time I will brown onions first so they have that carmelized flavor and add fresh garlic. I also added a little green chilies to spice it up a bit.

My husband and I found these chops to be really tasty and tender.  I followed the recipe except used plain yogurt as my spouse does not like sour cream.  It was difficult to blend it into the gravy so I ended up making regular gravy, and it was still delicious next time I will add some of the gravy to the flour mixture to thin it down.  I added paprika to the seasonings sprinkled on the chops and added the same to the flour for dredging.  This will be our favorite pork chop recipe.

I have to say that my very picky husband really liked this recipe! I would have liked a creamier, more gravy-like sauce...mine turned out runny. But served with rice, it was great! I added some sliced mushrooms while making the sauce and a shot of worchestershire, and it was very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

The sauce was watery and lacked any flavor, leaving these nice browned breaded pork chops soggy. My kids pushed there plates away and I have to admit that I didn't blame them. Won't ever make these again. A can of cream of mushroom soup would of been much better than this watery bland sauce.

MY FAMILY LOVES THIS RECIPE!  I USE 
CANNED BEEF BROTH INSTEAD OF BUILLON.  
ADD JUST ENOUGH TO COME TO THE TOP OF THE CHOPS.  I ALSO COOK THE SOURCREAM MIXTURE ON MED-LOW HEAT ON THE STOVE TOP, ADDING JUST ENOUGH BROTH FROM THE CROCK-POT TO GET THE DESIRED RESULTS.  I ALSO SERVE THE "GRAVY" ON THE SIDE INSTEAD OF OVER THE CHOPS.  THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIEST AND BEST TASTING CROCK-POT RECIPES THAT I HAVE EVER MADE.

I disagree with the others reviews.  This recipie is not lacking anything!  The sour cream works perfectly.  This recipie is a new favorite!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  This is so easy and tasty.  I just have one suggestion:  Mix 4 Tablespoons of flour into the sour cream rather than 2 tablespoons.  It really needs the extra flour to help the sauce thicken.  It is SOOOOOOO GOOD.

Allthough this wasn't bad, it needs something. Was a bit boring to the taste buds. The sour cream can't 'pull it off' by itself. Maybe add some cream cheese and/or cream of mushroom soup. Will try again. Ollie

I loved this dish.  There was only one inconsequential change made - I didn't dredge the chops in flour before browning.  I only used onion powder, garlic powder and pepper.  Should have used a bit of salt, too.  It was easy, quick and delicious!  Why anyone would want to add canned soup to this is beyond me.  We were thinking that it might be great with some sliced mushrooms added just before the sour cream/flour mixture.  Served over garlic mashed potatoes with some green beans on the side.  Way yum!

I don't have a big crock pot, so I used just four boneless pork chops and used the remaining ingredients in the quantities indicated in the recipe.  I followed the suggestions and seasoned the flour.  Also boiled the water with the bouillon and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the water/bouillon mixture, and added flour/water to thicken it.  I love mushrooms, so I may add a can of mushrooms next time.  This is really good, and the pork is incredibly tender!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out FABULOUS!! I personally would not make any changes. Served this over rice and the gravy was awesome. Will certainly be doing this one again.

Amazing flavor and easy to make with already on hand ingredients.  It is devine served over mashed potatoes. I made it exactly to the recipe. Highly recommend.

Very tasty! Pork was so tender, it fell apart. Next time, I will not salt the pork chops as the boullion provides enough in itself. Overall, great dish!

I love this site and have used it for years. This is my first and only rating. This is by far the worst thing I've ever made from this site. I followed the recipe to the letter. The pork chops were more than tender, they were mush. Also, I think the mixture of the chicken bouillon with the pork, just didn't mix well for me personally.

So tender! I cut the recipe in half since I was making it for two people. I followed the original recipe, substituting only for the sour cream (I used plain greek yogurt) and I used a cup of chicken stock in place of the bouillon. Turned out perfect. Two thumbs up!

This was super awesome!  I hate crock pot recipes that make me cook before I put things in the crock, so I skipped the browning step like another reviewer did.  Just threw my 6 frozen pork chops in the crock and put in some seasonings on top. I used a LOT of garlic salt, some pepper, and sprinkled in a little flour (although I doubt that made any difference).  Followed all the other directions.  The pork chops were very tender after 8 hours (shocker).  I didn't have a lot of time to waste thickening a sauce in the crock pot, so after I removed the chops, I just poured the broth into a saucepan to thicken with the sour cream and flour.  Served over rice, it was a perfect homey meal that my whole family (including my 19 month old) chowed down.  Next time, the only change I make will be to cook maybe 2 - 3 more chops.  I had lots of extra sauce and no chops to put them on.  There was more than enough broth for a couple more chops.

I like to read reviews before I make anything so with that being said I did what many other suggested buy upping the seasoning.  I added the extra seasoning to the sour cream where I felt like I had more control than in the flour.  I used beef broth because I didn't have any chicken.  Last I added about 2 oz cream cheese with the sour cream, others suggested cream of mushroom but I didn't have any of that either!  Served with steamed fresh broccoli and pasta, my family gobbled it up.

I made it exactly like the recipe since I can't review something if I've changed it like so many others have. The meat was tender, but a bit dry. The sour cream sauce was very thin and I didn't care for it all that much.  For those having an issue with the sour cream curdling - I whisked the sour cream mixture into the pork remains and I didn't have a curdling issue.

We actually liked it quite well with no sour cream. :-) (I was in hurry and forgot to add it at the end).  I also did it in the pan, not the crock pot.

I love these.  They are really easy and the sauce is yummy.  Still good even if you don't have time to brown first.  I have even thrown the chops in frozen.

I was unable to cook these in the slow cooker, instead I cooked them in the frying pan I used to brown them in. After they were browned I removed them from the pan and added the water and bouillon cubed. Once dissolved I put the pork chops back into the pan and topped with onion and cooked covered. They came out very tender.

My husband loved these so much that out of the 8 chops I made he had 7 of them!

This was really yummy, they were so tender they just fell apart. I did transfer my sauce to a pot on the stove and added extra flour. I was really hungry and wanted to speed up the sauce thickning process. Worked well and husband loved!

My dh and I really enjoyed these pork chops.  Per other reviews, I used seasoning salt for the salt, added 1/2 teas. Worcestershire Sauce, 2 cups chicken stock instead of the bouillons and boiling water and added 1 T. Gravy Master along with the flour and sour cream at the end.  I did lightly fry the pork chops per the recipe, but I do not think it is really necessary.  Because my slow cooker can be used on the stove top, I thickened the sauce on the stove instead of taking the extra time for it to thicken in the crock pot.  I would give this 4.5 stars if I could, but since that choice is unavailable, I went on the high end because I would make this again.

It was good but not incredible. I had to really spice up the gravy because I found it to be bland. But it did taste good over the pork chops and mashed potatoes.   However, I will say, my husband really enjoyed it. Probably won't make it again.

I fixed this for dinner last night.  When trying a new recipe I always ask "Should I make this again?". This was squarely in the "Make Again" category.  I basically followed the instructions.  I was very liberal in the use of garlic powder and used Mrs. Dash's poultry seasoning instead of salt.  I figure there was more than enough salt coming from the boullion cubes. I cooked the pork chops for about 6 hrs on low and they were fall-apart tender.  I also ended up transfering the "gravy" mixture to a pot on the stove so it would thinking faster.  I served it with boiled new potatoes and mixed veggies. It is great to find a recipe for the crockpot that doesn't rely on "cream of something" soup.

So very very delicious... exceeded expectation!! That morning, those porkchops were SO OLD and covered in freezer burn. But this recipe really blew my mind! The sauce is perfect! (I transferred it to the stove top though and used corn starch instead of flour.)

these were fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly.  i found that letting the sauce sit for a bit in the crockpot after 30 mins of cook time really helped it to thicken.

These chops come out very tender and tasty. I also added a can of mushroom soup to the liquid. After I took out the chops and mixed in the sour cream I decided to try dumplings on top of the liquid. They took a while to cook in the crock pot but I kept the chops in the oven on warm. Nice combination of flavors, total comfort food!

My husband and kids loved this dish! After I lightly browned the pork chops and put them in the slow cooker then I added cream of mushroom to the bouillon like others had suggested. Also added some additional spices. My husband said this was amazing and to keep it in my "regular/favorites" recipe section!

Excellent recipe. Will make again. Used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cubes.  Also added cream of golden mushroom soup.  Used Mrs. Dash seasoning.  Did not use flour. Everything else the same as recipe.

These pork chops were so good, and my husband especially loved them.  Because of my work schedule, they cooked a little longer than they were supposed to, which made them completely crumble, but the flavor was still good.

I have made this numerous times.  My daughter just love them.  The only alteration I made to the recipe is prior to adding the sour cream I put the broth in my food processor and blend.  I then add one package of organic shitake mushroom gravy mix blend and cook until thickened and then add the sour cream.  The sauce is amazing!!!

My family adored this recipe. I was concerned on the possibility of bland chops because of other reviews so I seasoned the flour very well. Then I browned them nicely in some oil. They were delicious! No flavor issues here. I served them with mushroom rice and some veggies.

We did the searing of the chops in a cast iron skillet, assembled everything there and put it in the oven for 45 minutes.  Delicious--the sauce made it.

I cooked mine for 4 hours on low and then they sat in warm for 2 more hours.  they did fall apart so i am not sure how i would cook them next time - i like tender but i also like having the chop intact for easier serving.  i dredged in flour flavored with Cajun and a little pork chop seasoning (Penseys) . they were ok but we were looking for more flavor.  think i needed to add something to the sour cream to zest them up. i think this is a good starter recipe but needs something more. there are some really amazing chop recipes online that I think are just as easy and more flavorful.

Great recipe.  Didn't have pork chops but I did have a pork tenderloin.  Of course I doubled the rest of the recipe for the weight of the tenderloin.  I also added some extra seasoning Mrs. Dash Southwest and used chicken broth instead of bouillion and water.   It was wonderful.  I will try this with a different cut of meat next time.  Thanks Nancy

Absolutely delicious!  I made a few slight changes/additions based on other reviews...i added a can of cream of mushroom to the bullion cubes and water, added a few extra spices to the flour...Montreal Steak Seasoning (because I love it) and paprika, and last, I poured some chicken broth in the pan to scrape up the drippings from the pork chops and poured that over the chops as well...I loved this!

I've never been a huge fan of pork chops, but this is one of the best things I've ever tasted! I found this about a month ago and I think I've made it 5 times already! Hubby loves it too, thank you so much for this awesome, easy recipe!!

My husband is not much of a fan of pork chops.  He tried this dish and LOVED it! I've never had pork chops so tender and moist and delicious!!  Loved the sauce too, and was great served over egg noodles. Definitely a keeper and a do-again!!

The pork chops were  very tender but very bland.  I'm sure this is a good base recipe but you'd need to add a lot to it to make it good.  I would not make this dish again.  I will be looking for another recipe for crock pot chops that has flavor.

Great recipe, I didn't change a thing.  My family loved these.  In fact, I don't like pork chops, and even I loved these!  I am giving 4 stars, only because mine looked too messy to serve to company (they were so tender they were falling apart).  I will definitely make these again though.

I followed this recipe exactly and there was just too much liquid.  I did use sage for seasoning.  I just thought this should have been more flavoful.  Maybe use real chicken broth instead?

Absolutely amazing! I followed other suggestions and added extra seasonings and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. It turned out soo good. I served it with fresh rolls, potatoes, and salad. I used the sauce as the gravy for the potatoes. My kids even loved it and asked for seconds. This will become a regular in my home from now on. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Saw this as the featured recipe today and decided to give it a try.  I followed the recipe as listed with the following exceptions, I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of cubes, I added extra onions bc we LOVE them, and I placed a few medium sized potatoes in the microwave for 3 minutes and then placed them on top to cook with the meat so I didn't have to make another side dish.  In tasting the gravy I found that after about 4 oz it seemed right to me so we did cut back on that as well.  It is a very good "throw in the crock" and let it cook itself meal that we will try again.  Next time I will season the meat a bit more bc we thought it was missing a little something.

My mom made a similar version of these all her days.  The ONLY difference was no sour cream.  And they always had rave reviews from company - and us.  This is still the most requested dinner by my kids of me.  I will add the sour cream next time.

This was so good.  The sauce didn't thicken up so I made a roux of flour and butter, then added the sauce to that.  That was perfect.

Add chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water. Also mix the flour with 1 tsp each of paprika, garlic powder, freshly ground pepper prior to dredging. Fantastic!

all i can say is wow!  this was incredible.  i mixed in a tablespoon of garlic salt and a tablespoon of paprika to my flour mixture.  as many other reviewers, i didn't realize this was a crockpot recipe until it was too late.  i seared them in the pan and then baked in oven at 400 for 30min exactly as you would make for the crock pot.  i then took the juices, added about 1/4c of flour that was left from dredging (with spices mixed in) and used that to thicken the juices on the stove.  this made plenty of sauce to serve over the chops and egg noodles.  my family devoured this... it was incredibly flavourful.

This recipe turned out very well.  I do however wish there was a way to move the pork chops with out them breaking all apart.  The next time I make this I will just leave the pork chops in the pan and maybe simmer the sour cream and sauce in another pan.

Sorry to say I did not like this at all.  Not worth the trouble.  The only good thing about it was that the meat was very tender.

This is the most delicious pork chop recipe!  It's a hit with my family every time.  I do not brown the chops first - I just throw them in the crock pot, season them, and let them cook.  I also put some small red potatoes and baby carrots in the crockpot to cook along with the chops.  This is a favorite recipe!

Great recipe.  I make this exactly as written and is something I have served for company with many compliments.  I do have to say that I find it important to put the chops in the oven while the sauce is finishing if you are making these in the crockpot. (as the recipe is written) Once I just let them sit out and they got terribly dry, lesson learned!  I have also found that these usually cook up in 5-6 hours for me but I usually use a medium sized chop not the really thick ones.

I, like another reviewer (Linda McLean), didn't make this in the slow cooker, just on the stove top. I followed her instructions - browned the chops, made a roux, simmered in broth and then added the sour cream.  I also cooked some mushrooms and a bit of bacon in butter and then threw those in with the sour cream.  Heavenly!  The chops were SO tender and the sauce excellent!  However, I tasted the sauce *before* adding the sour cream and it was awesome as well, though totally different.  I have made this twice - once without adding the sour cream and just serving with the gravy that was made from the chops, roux and chicken broth and it was wonderful too.  I love recipes that give you completely different results with almost the same ingredients!  I will be making this often, both ways!

Very good. Both I & my husband enjoyed. Found the recipe too late for the crockpot so I made it all in a fry pan. Sauteed onions in butter, browned chops on both sides. Added chicken stock & simmered about 20 min. Added flour & simmered til thickened. Stir in sour cream. Served with mashed potatoes. Yum!

I made this exactly as the recipe directed (didn't change a thing!) and it was wonderful. A very nice homestyle meal for Sunday supper. The sauce is niceley reminiscent of stroganoff.

We thought this was really good.  It's basically pork chops stroganoff.  I browned mine as directed adding Montreal steak seasoning. I omitted the onion and opted for onion soup mix instead.  I only used 1 bullion cube in the 2 cups of water. When the chops were done, I added a little extra cornstarch to the flour to make a thicker sauce, not gravy. I had it in the crock pot on med/med high for about 5 and a half hours.  We enjoyed this and two picky boys even ate it!

This recipe is was surprisingly, fantastically delicious. I admit, I changed three things: 1) did a rub on the chops with a "Jerk" seasoning before dredging... 2) used an envelope of Lipton onion soup instead of bouillon cubes... 3) used only about 1/4 cup sour cream in the sauce. I cooked it on high for about 3.5 hours. We ate it over egg noodles and both wanted three helpings, but stopped at two.

OMG! I really loved this recipe for a couple of reasons.  First, pork chops can be so hum drum and borring.  This is a great way to do something new with your chops.  Also, any recipe this tasty and easy that I can do in the crock pot is a hit with me.  I would only make one change and that is to double the sauce so there is more of the best part to spoon over rice.  This was a big hit with the whole family and I have added it to my favorites.

MMMMMMMMM these were fall of the bone tender and so full of flavor.  I added some garlic pepper and fresh garlic to the pork chops.  I also added white wine and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  The gravy was perfect.  I made this with Collard Greens and Mashed Potatoes.  Will definately make again.

Awesome recipe I didn't have time to slow cook them so I just browned them with the onions and 3 cloves of minced garlic then added the flour. Then 1 can chicken broth in place of the water and builion and simmered for 45 mins. Then added the sour cream and heated it through. I served it over some egg noodles and it was delicious even the kids loved it.

LOVED IT!! Very tender and jucy.  you can cook on High and cut the time in half if rushed and still a GREAT dish, but it is better when on low and done as stated here.

I would give these a 10 rating if I could!  I followed all of the suggestions made by mom200 on 2/23/07, except I used a can of Roasted Garlic Cr. of Mushroom Soup instead of garlic infused oil and reg. cr. mushroom soup. My husband had bought a value pack of very thick cut, boneless chops, and I feared that they would be dry and tough regardless of how I prepared them.  But with this recipe, they were so tender and juicy!  I don't know what happened with those reviewers who had dry chops. As for me, I will use this recipe again & again.  I'm going to try it with rice, noodles and mashed potatoes.  The gravy is to die for, and I can't wait to pair it with all of these!

This was the BEST recipe.  I doubled the juice so that all the pork was covreed.  I loved the recipe and I hope that others will try the recipe it is worth your time.  My husband hates onions, but he ate them with this recipe.

I am not sure what is so wonderful about these chops...not very tender, very bland, and unappetizing to look at. Will not make again.

This was very good! Each bite I took I liked it more. I used a can of veggie broth instead of water and disolved the bouillon cube in there. Then I took the advice of others and added a can of cream of mushroom soup and simmered for a bit. It really helped give the gravy a great taste. Although I wouldn't call the gravy "thick", it was a nice sauce to put over the chops. We served over egg noodles. Great recipe!

Pork chop perfection!

I was looking for a new way to cook chops & I am so glad I came across this recipe.

I followed the steps exactly and it could not have been easier. The pork chops were falling apart & we could cut them with a fork. No knife required! 

The sauce was divine. Served with rice and I had one satisfied boyfriend.

He did say they were a tad bit dry (I didn't notice!) so I will cut the cook time back a little the next time--I used the 8 hour setting.

This is by far my favorite pork chop recipe & I will definitely be making this again & again & again...

This recipe was VERY EASY and VERY GOOD.  I browned the pork chops early in the morning, threw them in the crop pot and started my day.  I did somehow miss the step of dregding in flour, but I don't think it impacted the final product much.  I found it easier to dump the crock contents into a sauce pan and thicken the sauce there.  The Sour Cream had me a little nervous for a bit because it looked a little chunky for a while, but at it cooked, it smoothed out nicely.  I might thicken it a bit next time.  My family liked it... my EXTREMELY PICKY 9 year old daughter even tried the sauce and liked it.  This recipe is a keeper... easy, fast and good.

This was very good. The only one in my home that did not like it was my 6 year old. (but if you can get him to eat your doing great.) thanks for the recipe. I will make this with the cream of mushroom soup like another reviewer did.

This was simple and hearty.  I am glad I read thru the reviews and found another reviewer's advice about how to prepare w/o slow cooker! (Thanks Linda!) Next time I will add mushrooms, and will serve with rice instead of pasta.

This was fabulous!  Even my kids liked them.  I didn't dredge the chops, just seasoned and browned them (personal preference) and it was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

If pork chops completely falling apart is a crime then this recipe is going to jail for sure!  I couldn't believe how tender and delicious it was.  I did end up putting the gravy over the stove top (my crock wouldn't thicken it...couldn't get hot enough I guess)  We had it with curly pasta and greenbeans...delicious!

Loved this recipe!  My husband and kids said this is a keeper.  It took very little preparation.  I did saute my onions first and I made the gravy in a saucepan as directed by other reviewers and this worked well.  I also used thin sliced chops and they were tender after being cooked only 4 hours.  I served it with wild rice.  We will definitely make this again!!

My husband and I love this!  To thicken the sauce I shake up some cold water and flour and whisk into bubbling sauce, and I add some Kitchen Bouquet as well.  Good flavor and very tender.

We loved this! It is an excellant way to serve pork chops and it's quick with bery little clean up. One thing I did alter- was I added less flour and less sour cream just because I didnt want the sauce so thick and I did want my husband to recognize the sour cream *lol* I cook with it all the time and he always loves it even though he claims he can't stand sour cream! *hee hee*

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I used thin pork cutlets and was blown away. The second time I made it I used thicker chops and for some reason just didn't like the dish as much as I remembered. I had trouble with the onions getting completely soft(may be the onion I used?) and the sour cream sauce seemed bland. I'm giving it 5 stars based on my first impression, but I do want to try it again with the thin cutlets and maybe saute the onions a bit before adding to the crockpot and add a bit more seasonings.

We just finished dinner. Nobody here liked this. The gravy never thickened, and it was terribly bland. I used the 2 tbsp flour AND added 4 tbsp additional cornstarch, and it still didn't thicken.   
The recipe didn't specify whether to use boneless or bone-in pork chops.  I used 6 boneless, and there was 10 times the amount of gravy than we needed for the amount of porkchops.  It also didn't tell you whether to replace the lid on the crockpot after adding the sour cream.  Putting the lid on created condensation and made it watery; keeping the lid off didn't allow the crockpot to get hot enough to thicken the gravy.  
This was a waste of good pork chops.

This recipe was surprisingly delicious!  I added parsley and celery flake to the mixture and served over whole wheat rice.  Will definitely be making it again.  
Every time I opened the lid to serve it to someone, my boyfriend had to have a bite because the smell was so amazing!

I followed the recipe, except I used 4 chops instead.  I enjoyed the meal and there may be slight changes the next time.  But, like I say all the time, a recipe is a guideline.  After the first try, you are able to add or take away.

The pork chops were fork tender and the taste was unbelievably great.  The gravy from this dish was absolutely wonderful over white rice.

I made this recipe and didn't make any changes.  My family flipped out over it.  They even ate it for leftovers, which they never do.  This is such a great recipe and I'm so glad I made it.  Will be making this often for the family.

When this recipe came up on my daily email for recipes.com, I thought, ok, I will try it. I never make pork chops, although my family would like me to, so I gave it a try. Outstanding!!!!!  I did although use an alternative cooking method, Clay roaster w/ lid in a 325• oven for 2.5 hours with 7 bone in chops, amazing*****i just floured, browned in olive oil layered in my clay roaster, layered sliced onion in between chops and on top and poured the chicken broth in , covered and when done, all in, about 2.5 hours, I could not believe the finished result!  My family and I will never make pork chops any other way again!!!  Thank you for sharing this super easy and amazing recipe....LOVE!

This was very good but as a working mom, not a very practical weeknight dinner. Tried it second time with large oil-core electric skillet; set chops on covered plate while I made the sauce in skillet and returned them to skillet. Tasted this same with less cleanup. My kids are teens so the time savings didn't necessarily improve their attitude but it helped mine!!

No adjustments were made. This was a delicious dish. My husband loved it. Will definitely make this dish again. The gravy was a bit thin so I advise  to put a little more flour in the gravy. Other than that. It was awesome.

No changes until the sour cream sauce. Added Cream of Mushroom soup. Used my 3 in 1 Ninja slow cooker from start to finish. Very good and we'll received by my family.

I've made this twice now. The meat is so tender it falls apart. I still think it needs more seasoning. Evidently I haven't put enough on to season to my taste. I did use chicken broth instead of H2o & bullion cubes. I also added a little "better then bullion, chicken" & cream of mushroom soup. We had this over noodles with the sour cream gravy. I made enough pork chops so that I could freeze some for a quick meal another day. Fingers crossed they will be just as good.

I usually don't post reviews but I have to say I made it with and without modifications from other reviews. Both ways good original way just follow the recipe the best. I just get sick of eating cream of mushroom soup on everything because I want different flavor. My husband and I LOVED the original flavor with the pork chops. I would say do not change one thing. Good work and thanks for the recipe.

I used a big tenderloin and it just melted in your mouth.  The sauce didn't thicken, so I had to add a little cornstarch so it didn't taste like flour. Very, very good! I will definitely make it again!

Based on reviews, I added some additional seasonings to the flour before dredging - onion powder, seasoning salt and thyme. I also stirred in a bit of cornstarch to the gravy, as it was too thin. It was fabulous and definitely a keeper!

I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic to the sour cream mix and served over buttered garlic egg noodles. Kids were skeptical at first but ended up loving it and telling me it was a definite make again!

The pork chops were very good, but the sauce was too thin and lacked flavor. Definitely needed plenty of salt as it didn't really taste like anything.  I think cream cheese would be a better addition than sour cream.

Wonderful, very moist.  Add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with 2 cups chicken broth, onions, garlic, flax, pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder.  Cook on low for 4 1/ 2. Hours.  Try adding sauted mushrooms. Add much less sour cream, maybe try I large tablespoon.

I have actually been making my pork chops like this for years with a few differences. I use cream of mushroom soup with the chops in the slow cooker after browning both. It makes for a perfect gravy, even if you aren't a mushroom fan ( I hate them). Add mashed potatoes and corn on the side and you have a perfect bite and meal:)

This was ok but not great. Doesn't have much flavor but was an easy way to make pork chops in the crock pot. I did not brown in advance just because I usually skip this step when crock pot cooking. I will probably never make this again.

I created a monster when I made this for my husband, it's all he ever wants.  Instead of adding the flour to the sour cream,  I make a roux in the pan after browning the chops, then use the water and bullion to deglaze the pan.  Delicious.

This recipe is excellent!  The only change I made was to add the seasoning to the flour.  Since I don't function too well in the morning, I floured and browned the chops in the evening and mixed up the chicken bouillon and stored both separately in the refrigerator.  In the morning all I had to do was combine the ingredients and turn on the slow cooker.  Something my fuzzy brain could handle.  Served the chops over rice.  Will definitely make this again.

Have made this per listed recipe and my own take. Both are excellent.  I do prefer my recipe, although it is per each person's taste.  I rate original 4 stars, mine 5.  If monies prevail, please get yourselves a Ninja cooker, it has a stove top and slow. You can brown and then slow cook, same pot. EASY-PEASY. Far less dishes and cleanup is the bomb with a Ninja, you could simply wipe with a paper towel. I have served over noodles and rice, delish both ways. I don't use soups, don't need, have added mushrooms.  I don't use flour after browning, I use a small amount of corn starch mix with water or chicken broth, and WALLA, instant thick. which at that time you switch back to stove cook.  SO so yummy, tender, not dry at all.  Enjoy folks.

I've tried this and love it! The recipe stands good on its own! I'd  like to add a twist. Instead of beef bouillon or broth, try beef consume!  The last time I did this- used beef consume because it was what I had... Gave a wonderful added twist of richness! I use the beef consume in a similar recipe I cook with chicken.

Delicious!  SO impressed with the sauce.  I made this on the stove top as others did, and only used one chicken bouillon and omitted the flour in the sour cream as it didn't need it.  Probably cooked it close to 45 minutes in all, removed the chops and added the sour cream.  Added a little water when the sauce got too thick.  Also seasoned the chops with s&p and garlic pretty good, and seasoned the flour for dredging liberally with Lawry's season salt, garlic powder, and pepper.  I can't imagine mixing in a can of cream of mushroom soup as others did!    Will make again and again I'm sure!  A nice surprise tonight.

This was one of the best dishes I have ever made and I am not a great cook. It was absolutely delicious. I am from Oklahoma, and it really did come out like good old fashioned smothered pork chops. My boyfriend gave me highest marks, saying "these pork chops are on hit!" (that's a good thing) No changes are necessary with this recipe, but I did lower the servings to 4 chops,caramelized the onions in the skillet before adding to the crock pot (although I don't know if that was even necessary since the onions almost completely emulsified during cooking), and used vegetable bouillon vs beef bc that's all I had.Here is a big change I made, I cooked on high for 5 1/2 hours vs on low for 8 to 9 hrs bc I simply didn't have time. Still came out super tender, no knife was necessary! I also poured the crock pot droppings in a sauce pan and made the gravy over the stove with the sour cream and flour, vs in the crock pot - as 1 reviewer said, saves TONS of time, your gravy will be ready in like 4 mins. It was perfectly thick, I did strain it to get the flour lumps out. Use tons of seasoning before browning,it will have great flavor. I also used lean chops which worked well with this dish. I served it with a wild rice and broccoli mix I got from one of those Knorr heat-up "rice sides" bags and a salad. Love the fact that ingredients were simple and all on hand. The only complaint is you end up with tons of dirty pots and pans, which is not normal for a crock pot recipe. But still 5 stars!

Recipe was good, but the sauce was a little thin .. the only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes and water .. will stick to my creamy pork chop recipe

The family truly enjoyed this one.  I realized as I was starting prep I was out of chicken bouillon cubes so I subbed beef since I was time crunched and it was fine.    Family all said this needed to be a repeat.

Sauce was fine but the chop, while tender, was dry. Chops were about 1.5 inches thick.  Ate this entree over white rice - that was good with the sauce/ gravy. I won't make it again.

These were excellent. I basically followed the recipe, adding more spices to fit my tastes, including a quarter packet of onion soup. I seasoned the chops, seasoned some flour, dredged em, browned them in olive oil, and transferred to crock pot. I mixed the 2 cups water and bullion cubes to the pan I cooked the chops in to keep all that yummy goodness. I also pulled the chops out at the end (they really do fall apart) and transferred the liquid and onions into a pan, added the sour cream and flour mixture, and stirred til it thickened.

My man doesn't care much for chops and he went back for thirds on these.

I really enjoyed this one.  Like another reviewer, I found it too late to get into the crockpot, but I did mine on the stovetop, browning thick chops, making a roux, adding the chicken boulion, and returning the chops and simmering covered for about 45 min.  It turned out fantastic.  My sour cream sauce turned out more like a gravy, but it was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I read a lot of reviews, which is why I love this site.  I did add some Lawry's seasoning salt, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I've made many recipes that say the meat is so tender it falls apart, and it never happens. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried to use a fork to transfer the chops from the crockpot to the oven and the first one did indeed fall apart, I switched to a spatula for the remaining chops.  Great recipes.  Thanks for sharing..

Did not change the recipe and everyone was wanting MORE MORE MORE! This recipe is amazing! 1 thing I recommend, is just having the oven preheated to 200, then transferring them into it to keep warm, but turning the oven OFF and keep the door shut til gravy is ready. Otherwise, they tend to brown and dry up if you keep it on.
Everyone absolutely loved this recipe though. I have made it about 3 times already in the past 2 months. Omg so declicious!

Yeah, the pork calls offa the bones as stated but the sauce was a dud. I THINK I made it according to the directions but I had to use a whole lot more flour to get it to thicken enough for my taste. And speaking of taste, it wasn't anything great. The whole thing took eternity to slow cook,which was to be expected, but I guess I just think it wasn't worth the effort. I wouldn't bother with this recipe ever again. Not impressive.

Really enjoyed the ease of this recipe.   The cooking time was a bit long for my crockpot, the meat kind of "dissolved" in your mouth.  Next time I will reduce to about 5 hours.  Great versatile recipe.

My husband loved this!  The pork chops were really tender and it was super easy.  My only adjustment next time will be using a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the sour cream.  I just think it would have a little more flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was wonderful, even as leftovers. I browned mine in a skillet and then put them in my crockpot that was set to 4 hours (this is high mode for this crockpot). After about 3.5 hours I checked on them and they were ready to go. My family absolutely loved them. I served it with some pesto noodles and veggies. Will definitely make again soon.

This was delish in the slow cooker!  I used 4 thick, bone-in chops.  I added garlic to the oil before browning them, mixed in lemon pepper and thyme into the flour, and poured the pan drippings over the chops along with the broth.  I cooked them on low for 3-4 hours and then kept them on warm for a couple more... meat was falling off the bone!

My BF made this for me last night with scalloped potatoes and green beans. He made it exactly as it said to; other than the chicken bouillon because he couldn't find it, so he used beef bouillon instead. Despite that, it turned out really good and we liked it. The chops were so tender and good! Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy, and so good! I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder for a little extra kick. I also put the water in the frying pan I used to brown the pork chops, added the bouillon to that so I was able to get boiling water really fast but also pick up all that flavor that was left in the pan.(I then poured it into the crockpot) At the end, I did something similar--rather than adding the sour cream to the crock pot to thicken, I poured the juices into a frying pan and let it thicken there. Much faster results.

We LOVED this recipe, but I did modify to "our" preferences.  I'm sure it would be great as is but we just like more spice/gravy.

I doubled the recipe as I always do for my "big" eating family!   I browned the prepared and heavily seasoned pork chops and set aside.  I sautéed 4 cloves of fresh garlic with the onion, then poured 1 can of cream of mushroom soup in the same pan mixing in with the brown particles from the pork..YUM.  I then added boiling water/bouillon (probably a bit more than written) and slowly added a mixture of corn starch and water to the mix.  Placed the pork chops on the bottom of my large crock pot and then poured the "gravy" mix over the chops.  Cooked approximately 5 hours on low setting and carefully removed chops to a platter.   Added sautéed "fresh" mushrooms (approx. 16 oz.) and container of sour cream.  Mixed gravy well, then put chops back in to the crock pot and continued to cook maybe an hour longer.  The chops were already done, but we were not ready to eat yet.  The house SMELLED AMAZING!!!!  Served over Polish egg noodles with seasoned fresh green beans.  It is not a pretty dish, but the TASTE IS AMAZING!!!!  My family from ages 8 to 55 LOVED this dish.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!  SOOOOO GOOD!  I used center cut pork chops "with" bone so had to be careful as some small bones were left in sauce.  But that little tid bit didn't bother my family at all.  SMELLS & TASTE AMAZING........sooooo TENDER you will LOVE!

Would give this more than 5 stars if I could! I had to make a couple of modifications because of time and ingredients.  My chops were still frozen and I was running late, so I skipped browning them first - just put them straight into the crockpot and seasoned with the salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I used 2 cups chicken broth instead of bouillon and water.  Didn't have 7-8 hours to allow them to cook so I cooked them on high for about 5 hours.  Instead of turning on the oven, I removed the chops to a plate, poured the liquid into a sauce pan and then put the chops back into the crock pot to stay warm.  I allowed the sauce to cook on top of the stove for about 15 minutes and it thickened nicely.  The pork chops were fork tender and the onions added great flavor.  I served the chops on brown rice and poured the sauce over the top.  Absolutely delicious and I will definitely be making them again - this recipe is perfect as written and doesn't need any ingredient changes.  I don't understand why people drastically modify recipe ingredients and then rate it - just submit your own recipe.

This was really good, and very easy.  Next time I will not season the pork chops with salt, as it was pretty salty.  Also, I had to add some starch to thicken the sauce. I served it with mashed potatoes.  Overall, very good, and something we will definitely make again!

Awesome. Wanted the sauce a little thicker so I added more flour.  I also threw a couple of strips of bacon on top of the onions.

This dish is absolutely delicious! I substituted in wheat flour instead of white flour, used seasoned salt in place of regular salt, browned the chops in fat free cooking spray, sauteed the onion before putting it in the crock pot, used cornstarch to thicken the gravy and added in fresh sliced mushrooms.  Served with mashed red potatoes and asparagus. My BF loved it! Highly recommend!

This was ok.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  The end result was good but a bit bland.  I felt like it was missing something - the sauce needed to be brightened up.  Don't think I will make this again...

My kids loved this. They could not get enough of the reux. I didn't use a slow cooker but used a large pot instead and just fried my pork chops with some olive oil and flour. Scrapped the bottom of the pot and added my onion which I then sauted. I then added 2 cups of bullion and sourcream and put the chops back in. I also did not add more flour. The flour from the pork chops were just right for my reux...perfect. Will definitely make again!

My family loves this recipe. I have made it a few times and it turns out a little different every time. It is amazing and has great taste every time but the meat is always different. Last time I made it the pork was shredded so I cooked up some pasta and we had a very unique but delicious dish. 
This dish also reheats nicely, it has the same flavor and the pork is not dry like it often is when reheated.

this was devine !!!  the only changes i made was using a pork roast without the fat cooked on low for 6 hours also used raw garlic instead of powder - added potato guchi (excuse spelling) about 5 minutes before sauce was cooked but let cook all together for further 20 minutes - died and went to heaven ! thanks so much for a wonderful recipe that i will be using again and again

Pork Chops were VERY tender!  I did not make the sauce.  Simply put in crock pot with onions and broth.  I will not flour next time.  Will just simply sear.

Really really good.  I did put extra seasoning on the pork chops as suggested and it turned out wonderful.  I found thinner boneless pork chops on sale so I used them and it turned out wonderfully and super tender so just know you can use boneless and smaller chops.  Thanks for the post.

This was totally yummy! The kids scarfed it down. Next time I won't bother to do the first step to dredge in flour and brown. I don't think it really made a difference. The sauce seemed to beg for mushrooms so I might try adding those next time near the end. I served with roasted potatoes and steamed mixed veggies. I am my family's culinary hero once again!

I too love this recipe. I make it at least once a month. The flavor is wonderful and I serve it over white rice. The gravy is just fabulous. I mix my flour and sour cream together and then add several spoonsful of the broth to it so it will blend easier once it's all back in the crock pot.

My chops turned out dry like some of the other reviewers. Maybe it's a combination of the meat and what kind of slow cooker you use. It's a great idea if you can get it to turn out. I browned them with well-seasoned flour cooked in chicken broth for 6 hours on low.

This was delicious! I only cooked mine for about 6 hours on low. I also added more spices. I used lemon pepper, paprika, cumin and thyme. It turned out very tender and tasted delicious! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Absolutely amazing! We've never tasted such amazing porkchops before...so tender! The gravy didn't thicken up for me though (I used yogurt), but it tasted fine, so we just used it anyway. Next time I'll do the gravy on the stove instead.

Yummy, but like just about everyone else, I modified the recipe.  Who would make this without mushrooms?  I made a white sauce to pour over the chops and added sautee mushrooms.  So, it was like homeade cream of mushroom soup.  I did add the sour cream and flour at the end, thickened in a pot.  It was a very tasty gravy that had us all licking our plates clean.  But the pork was not as tender as I wanted.  It was a little -dare I say it- dry?   I put it in the crock pot on low for 7 hrs, like the recipe called for.  Maybe too long?

If you like your pork chops to be fall apart tender than you should like this recipe. I however, discovered I don't like pork chops in the slow cooker. I thought the flavor was just okay. I can see how lots of reviewers have tweaked this recipe by adding cream of mushroom and baking in the oven. I have been craving pork chops since I'm pregnant and there are lots of other recipes on AR that are much better (Caramel apple pork chops!) Also this recipe was pretty time consuming considering it is a slow cooker recipe. Oh well, hope you have better luck!

Excellent. Changed sauce to 1 2/3 C unsalted beef broth & 1/3 C sherry with 1/2 can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup. After the chops were cooked, I put the sauce in a pan on the stove top, added the sour cream/flour mixture.  Once that mixture had thickened I added a small package of sliced mushrooms I had previously sauteed in a small amount of butter.  I served the chops & sauce with egg noodles and green beans almondine.  Everyone loved these!  No leftovers.

I don't even like sour cream, but I love this recipe.  I served it with french fries and the sour cream broth sauce made a perfect dipping sauce for the fries.

There ARE really good!  I did everything exactly as the recipe stated except I added about 10 sliced fresh mushrooms!  I think using 1/2 water, 1/2 wine would also be a good twist!  I served the pork chops & gravy with mashed potatoes - I'm sure rice or noodles would also be great!  A keeper!

Add minced garlic when browning chops.  Also add 1 can cream mushroom soup and 1 cup cold water with 4 T flour blended in.

The flavor was OK, but my sauce just didn't get thick. I tried adding an extra 1/2 c. of flour, but to no avail. I don't think I will try this again.

Pretty good. Not spectacular, most meat in the slow cooker is perfect.  But good enough for 4 stars.

Very very good, but he sauce wasn't thick and needed seasoning...  I added some thyme and garlic.  Will definitely make again, but use less stock (water+bouillon) and thicken with cornstarch instead of adding flour to the sour cream.

Lots of potential here.  Pork chops are, as stated, fall apart tender.  It is lacking a bit in the seasoning department.  However, made as written, it's still a really good "comfort food" type recipe.  I served mine over rice, and looking back, I think it would have been better over some good, amish egg noodles.

Very good pork chops!   So very tender!   Used very large pork chops from Costco which required the full time in the crock pot.

This recipe is great!  I have been looking for slow cooker recipies because I am often gone all day long and don't have time to cook supper before 5 pm.  I have never had more tender pork chops.  I will use a different pork chop, as the ones I used were too fatty throughout, but they were so great!  I didn't use the onion because I didn't hve one, so I added crushed garlic cloves.  I will have to try it with onions next time.  I will definitely keep this recipe.

Somehow this was way too salty for me.... maybe because I used garlic salt on pork chops.  Also chciken boullion may have been too much salt in it.  Next time I will use garlic powder and salt separately and I will buy a can of low sodium chicken stock instead of bouillon.

Pretty good.  I used "extra large" bouillon cubes, so I really put in double the amount I was suppose to.  But still good.

4.5 Stars. I made exactly as the recipe said but I think 7 hours was too long for the pork, but it was very tender and the sauce was awesome. I think next time I will try 5 hours for the pork, add extra onion, and finish it as I did this time with a roux in a pan to thicken it and add ground black pepper.

This has to be one of the best pork chop recipes that I've tried.  The pork chops came out incredibly tender, and the sauce was very tasty.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of using slightly less sour cream.  The sauce was still rich and thick.  I served the chops on a bed of brown rice, poured sauce over the top, and topped with steamed asparagus spears--YUM!  It looked and tasted great!

Although this dish didn't "wow" me, it was very tasty and I can't think of any complaints about it or changes I'd make.  I don't have a slow cooker, and I was only cooking one chop for myself, so I put the pork chop into a small pyrex bowl with the broth after seasoning the pork chop w/ salt, pepper & garlic powder.  I added sliced mushrooms on top.  I cooked in the oven covered for 55 minutes at 375 degrees.  When I took it out of the oven, I poured the broth in a saucepan with the sour cream and very little cornstarch and heated through.  I poured this over my pork chop.  Very tasty, very easy, and one of the most tender chops I've had!

These were good, but not my favorite. My husband really liked them. I followed the recipe, except I thicked up the gravy on the stovetop. Mine weren't fall apart tender like the recipe stated but they didn't effect my rating.

Not only was this super easy, it was delicious!  I have never been able to cook pork and not have it turn out dry, but this was amazing.  After reading other reviews, I did take the advice of adding a can of cream of mushroom and I think that did help. I would also suggest adding coarse ground pepper to the flour befor dredging as well as when mixing in the sour cream.  I will definitely make this again!

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  It is amazing.  I added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup and after I took out the chops, I added sauteed mushrooms. This is definitely a keeper!

A HUGE COmpany Favorite! I get alot of compliments on this recipe because everyone comes back for more. I always double the sauce parts of the recipe so there is more gravy and use a handful of diced onions so it's easier to eat and rather disguising to those who claim to hate onions.

This was great.  Make sure you use thick bioneless chops, my thin ones were so tender they completely fell apart and it was hard to visually defferentiate between the bone and the meat.

Yummy! I have made these 2 times already. Nice change from the normal pork chop. I also added a can of mushrooms to the crock pot. Served it with rice and a veggie, Plenty of gravy for the rice also.

My husband had to make this while I was at work on the weekend and as soon as I got home, he complained about all the steps for what he thought would be an 'easy' crockpot recipe (he followed the recipe exactly).  But when we sat down to eat, he said it really wasn't too much trouble and the work was totally worth it because they were the best pork chops we've ever had!  SOOOO tender, the gravy was delicious - we didn't have any leftovers. :)

I liked this recipe. I seared them until brown on both sides, after dusting them with flour and seasoning.  I then made the sauce, returned them to the pan and cooked them through.  They came out very moist and had great flavor.  I put it all on a bed of egg noodles.  I used a roux of a little oil and flour to thicken, and I also used chicken stock, instead of bullion.

Very good recipe!  I didn't have time for the CrockPot, so I did it on the stovetop.  Took about 3 hours.  My kids and hubby LOVED it.  Will make this again, thanks!

A decent "base" recipe, but it would've been quite bland. I added smoked Paprika to the flour mixture and also sprinkled it directly on the meat before I browned it (I used a Pork Shoulder roast) . To the sauce, I added 2 tsp's Worst. sauce and a can of Cream Mush. Soup. When it came time to add the sour cream, I added a tablspoon of cornstarch to the s.c. and while that was in the crock pot, I sliced up the meat, added it back to the sauce and then served over Egg Noodles.  It turned out a lot like a stroganoff.

As reviews before me, I also sauteed onions in same pan chops were browned.  I did cut every bit of fat from chops before browning.  Followed recipe although I did use Penzey's Pork Soup Base rather than chicken boullion then when time to make sour cream sauce or gravy, I moved it from slow cooker to large fry pan to quicken thickening process.  Entire family loved it.  Made me promise to fix again soon.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I'm not generally a fan of pork chops because of how dry they can be.  These were nice and tender and I really enjoyed the flavor that the sour cream combined with bouillon gave it.  Next time I might leave the chops in the slow cooker when I add the sour cream.  They seemed to dry out a bit in the oven for those 15 minutes.  Great over white rice with green beans!!!

Made these tonight and they turned out moist and tender.  I incorporated feedback from others and changed 2 cups. water to 1 cup water, and added 1 cup chix. stock.  I didn't cook in slow cooker because of time, but I did season & flour chops before I browned them in pan with oil, transferred to baking dish, then I put onions in pan to saute', added some sliced mushrooms.  Mixed up sour cream with remaining flour mixture, added water/chix stock and bouillon.  I did taste this and was not pleased, tasted like watered down flour paste, so I added seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder a little white wine, worcestershire) and flavor improved.  Poured this over chops, added onions & mushrooms, put in 350 oven for 1 hour, reduced temp. to 200 for another hour and they tasted great.  I also baked potatoes at the same time.  I'm planning on this for a special dinner tomorrow and can't wait to top my potato with some of the sauce.  I will make these again.

This was totally good as is! Why change everything? The ONLY thing I did differently was I didn't add much onion (boyfriend is funny about onion) and compensated with some minced garlic. Otherwise, the chops and sauce turned out GREAT and totally melted in my mouth. I'll make this one again and again!

Easy to make and my family liked them very well. The sauce didn't thicken, though, so next time I may transfer it to a pot so I can raise the heat more quickly, or use cornstarch instead of flour. Thanks!

OMG i loved this receipe,i just changed a few things. First i used a pork roast instead of pork chops, (you get more meat for your buck and no bones to deal with)  I used 1 bouillon cube with 1cup of water and 1 can of chicken stock.  Then I sauteed my onions in the grease left over from browning the roast, i added about 1/4 c of chicken stock to the onions and let it cook out then poured over the meat and cooked it all day..mmmmm

This is my very favorite pork chop recipe. The chops are always super tender and the gravy it makes is tangy and delicious!! We love this recipe.

I didn't have time to pan fry the chops, so I put them directly imto the crockpot seasoned and added the broth and one can of crm of mush. I followed the remainder of the instructions and they came out beautifully, except that in my error I left them in the oven and they were a bit dry, but next time I will remember. Great pork cop recipe!!

Delicious! Good weekend recipe. Next time I make this recipe (which I definately will) I will probably add mushrooms to the gravy.

Instant classic at our house. Only change I made was spicing up the flour with some white pepper and paprika.  My chops were on the thin side so 4.5 hours in the crockpot on low was plenty. Sauce could have been a bit thicker.  Next time I will either remove some of the broth before adding the flour and sour cream or maybe use more flour. Served this with Peppridge Farm Stuffing and asparagus.  Dinner hit the table 30 minutes after I hit the door.  YAY!!!

After trying a new recipe my Husband and I decide if it's a keeper or not....and this one just isn't. Don't get me wrong this is a great base recipe and that's why I give it 4 stars, but unfortunatly so many modifications need to be done in order to get the flavors to come out. Hubby made me promice I wouldn't make this again but it wasn't a total loss, I learned something new about pork chops!

Amazing!!  My husband was in love with this.  He loved that I combined the sour cream with the pork chops!!  I served them with rice and poured the sour cream sauce overtop the rice.  Wonderful recipe!!

My husband wasn't "in the mood for pork chops" I heard when he got home from work (but he didn't have a choice) At supper, his jaw dropped when the meat just slithered off the bone & fork.  And then, when he ate it, I couldn't get him to shut up about it.  Afterwards, I was informed that he "expected them this way from now on," that nothing could compare after this recipe.  Thank you for an awesome, husband-pleasing meal!

I browned my pork chops in a non stick skillet using pam, seasoning the chops with more spice Tony's.  I didn't have any chicken broth so I used beef broth.  I used 3 cans of mushrooms.  I used 8 oz of reduced fat sour cream.  I also served this with brown rice.  It was excellent and healthy too!

as im writing this my sauce is thickening up. i didnt have the cubes so i used two cups of chicken broth instead of water. i cooked it on high for 4 hours and on low for 1/2 an hour. the chops came out perfect and i can keep myself from sampling it while its keeping warm. i think im going to serve it with mashed potatoes and some kind of veggie. it is so good and my husband will love it for sure! i will be making this probably every week :) thanks for the recipe!! love it!

This has become a weekly in my home. I love it! I serve it over white rice. Im sure noodles would be lovely too. I dont cook mine quite as long but that's only because my crock pot's low setting is not very low. I do stir mine throughout the day as well because sometimes it burns to the sides. But I think that is more an issue with my crock pot. This truly is a wonderful meal.

I am a sour cream freak, so any recipe that includes sour cream will catch my eye. This recipe is very good and easy to make. I had thinner chops than what was listed, so I simmered them for 30 minutes, plus I was really hungry and couldn't wait. I can't imagine that it could be any better, but will follow the recipe next time just to see if it's even possible. I would call this comfort food and can't wait to make it again. Yummy!

My husband loved these, he said it was the perfect dinner to come home to after a hard day of work. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, make sure its the low sodium kind otherwise the sauce can be too salty tasting. I also added some garlic cause my family loves it.

Delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  Make sure to choose thick pork chops or reduce the cooking time as the pork chops may come out dry.  I used the sauce over egg noodle and it was wonderful!

Took the advice to use mushroom soup.  Turned out great!  We even baked in the oven instead of slow cooker - for 40 minutes at 350F.

Loved it - didn't make any modifications except spicing up the flour before dredging the pork - used salt/pepper/paprika/fennel/seasoned salt.  Excellent flavor - perfect with mashed potatoes.  I just took the pork chops out for a few minutes while making the gravy and then put them right back in so I didn't have to put them in the oven and dirty a pan.

The meat literally fell right off the bone. What a great recipe. The flavor of the sauce was a bit intense, but the meat and overall result was great.

This recipe has a lot of potential. I did all the prep work in the morning and the pork browned up beautifully.  However, I was gone for about nine hours which was WAY too long to have these in the slow cooker so by the time I got home the meat was overcooked and there was hardly any liquid left so I had to add a can of crm mushroom soup and some milk. Moral of the story- the pork only needs to cook for about 4-5 hours. Otherwise, the taste was great!

Excellent recipe!  My fiance raved about this one for days and a friend that doesn't care for sour cream asked if he could have the sauce over noodles when his porkchop was gone.
My crockpot is broken right now but I had no problem browning the chops and baking them in the oven.  They would be much more tender in the crock, of course, but baking them works just fine.  Thanks!

It's true these pork chops are very moist and you can cut them with your fork, but the recipe as is, is kinda bland.  I added a good amount of fresh dill and that perked it up and made it more flavorful, and it definitely wouldn't have been the same without it.  They were good, and it was nice to come home to a warm meal, but I'm not sure if I would make them again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  The pork chops were so tender.  I hate to review a recipe and submit my changes, but the only thing I did was add a can of golden mushroom soup.  If I'd had any on hand, I would have added in some mushrooms because my family loves them so much.  I will definitely make this again.  YUM!

This was really good.  I used 2 pork loin chops so they were quite thick.  I followed the recipe otherwise.  The chops were tender but a little dry, which didn't bother me a bit, but for my husband I might try increasing the liquid a little to keep them from drying out as much.  Nonethless, a delicious dish!

This recipe was very tasty.  I did everything just as it was written and the meat was moist and tender.  For people who like tender marbled meat, this dish will be heavenly.

I made a few modifications. I replaced the chicken bouillon with 1 lg ham bouillon cube. I added 8oz sliced fresh mushrooms with the onions. I increased the flour to 3Tbs(I like thicker sauces).

So tasty!  I suggest only cooking the chops for 6 or 7 hrs, otherwise they dry out.  I added more onions and seasoning.  These were truly the best pork chops I've ever made!  Served with mashed potatoes and a salad.  Yum!

YUMMMM!  I am not a fan of pork chops, but this is delicious!  The pork chops are so tender and fall apart.  The gravy is so good over rice or mashed potatoes.  I did have to add about 1/3 cup flour, 2 tbsp was not enough to make it thick.  My husband raved about this.  Can't wait to make it again!

I have to agree with other reviewers.  The meat was falling apart...however, the sauce lacked any flavor.  Personally, I like foods on the blander side, but my husband does not.  He did not like the sauce at all.

Very easy and tasty. I added a bit more flour to get the gravy a little thicker. Serve with some mash potatoes and even the kids will love it.

WOW!  This was terrific!  The fact that it was SO easy to make is a plus.  

My only modifications were that I did not take the chops out of the slow cooker.  I 'made' the sauce while the chops were in there.  If the sauce doesn't thicken enough, you can always add a little more flour.  Another modification is that I added some extra spices into the sauce (paprika, fresh ground pepper, a little more garlic powder).

Really good and EASY recipe- My modifications- didn't have time to slow cook  I didn't have time to slow cook & that is the reason I gave 4stars. I bet using the crock pot the recipe would be a 5 star! Seasoned with my fav seasonings, floured and browned. I used 2 chicken boullins with 2 cups of water but I think chicken broth is the same. I ALSO used cream of mushroom soup to the broth mixture and poured over pork chops and simmered for 45 mins. Then right before they were done, added the sour cream and heated it through. I served it over some egg noodles and it was delicious even my picky husband liked it. He said it was keeper. I would like to try the crock pot method which I think will be the best!

My whole family loved this meal.  I added brown gravy mix to the juice along with the sour cream to make the gravy.  The meat does fall off the bone so be careful.

Very Good - My modifications = boneless pork chops, spiced the flour a bit with garlic salt and onion powder, added garlic and bay leaf to the pot. Then thickened the sour cream with corn starch not flour. Served over rice...

I would have added a bit of paprika too (but I was out)  Very similar to Pleasant Pork Chops from this site- which is a FAVORITE but the pork chop was WAY more tender...and this recipe is must less prep...Yum Yum

AWESOME!!!  This recipe is so easy and the pork chops fall off of the bone; I had to use a spatula to lift them from the slow cooker.  I added mushrooms to my mixture and my family ate until they were stuffed!  Thank you!!

This was an awesome meal!!! Very moist & tasty. I followed it pretty closely, but did add extra seasonings to the flour & chops before browning. Let it cook on low all day & I made some wide egg noodles & put those in the sauce, then put the chops on top of the noodles. My fiance who is soooooo picky & always leery when I try something new, loved this!! He said it was GREAT!! The chops were soooooo moist, yummy!

I loved this recipe! Made it for fiance and future in laws and they loved it. My future father in law said they were the best pork chops ever cooked in his house, and his wife agreed! Definately a repeat recipe. I did make a couple of changes though. In stead of salt and pepper and garlic powder, I used seasoning salt and garlic powder. Instead of 2 bouillon cubes I uased 3. And , I ended up using about a cup more flour when making the gravy to get it to thicken.

The dish was not bad, but not great either. I did add a can of cream of mushroom soup as others mentioned, and added corn starch to give it some thickness. My kids were not fond of it, so for that I probably would not make again. :(

This is a very good recipe. The sour cream sauce is even good by its self. Toast a piece of bread & put some of the sauce on top & it is excellent. I even tried this recipe using boneless, skinless chicken breast & it was excelent also. Try this recipe with pork chops or chicken breast you will love it.

Absolutely easy and delicious.  I took note of other reviews that thought this recipe was slightly bland.  I sprinkled the chops with McCormicks Garlic Salt blend and pepper before dredging in flour.  I also used vegetable broth instead of plain water and added two teaspoons of Chicken Base.  Smelled great while cooking and made a really tender chop.  The gravy is very good also.  The entire family ate this one with no coaxing.

I thought this was a great easy way to make pork chops.  I cooked mine on high for 5 hours instead of on low for 7-8 hours.  It worked just as well.  We liked the recipe without the sour cream topping.  The flavor of the chops alone os good enough.

I was looking for a new and easy pork chop recipe and decided to try this one. I made a few changes. I added garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder to my flour before browning in 1 tsp of olive oil.

I also used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can golden mushroom soup. I mixed them together in a bowl with fresh minced garlic, fresh mushrooms, 1 1/2 cans of milk, dash of garlic salt, and pepper. 

I cooked them on low for 9 hours. The one thing that bothered me was that the gravy or soup mix really stuck to the sides of the crock pot and browned pretty bad. 

The pork chops were very moist they were falling off the bone Next time will use boneless chops. I added 3 tbsp of sour cream to the gravy mix about an hour before serving and it seemd to thicken it up quite a bit.

My husband loved these! The meat was very tender. I found it to be a bit dry, but falvorful. I served this with egg noodles, green beans and a salad.

Next time I think I will cook for a shorter period of time maybe for 6 hours.

Overall great and easy recipe. I love being able to put something together in the morning and being able to walk away from it until later!

Thanks for an easy recipe...my family loved it!

I enjoyed this recipe idea very much, The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because I had to change the recipe a little because of some ingredients I didn't have. I dregded the chops in the flour & seasoning & also added 2 garlic cloves(minced) when browning. In a separate bowl I blended a can of cream of chicken soup & the 8 oz sour cream.(did not have boullion) After chops were done browning I deglazed the pan with some white wine & mixed that in with the soup mixture & poured it on top of the chops in the slow cooker. Followed the rest of the recipe, it was delicious. Mushrooms would also be good in this.

Didn't have 8 hrs so I put them on high for 4hrs - too long. Chops  absolutely fell apart when taking them out for the oven. Suggest 3hr on high. Overall good but lacking a bit in taste as well as (incredibly given the fact they cooked in chicken broth) - they seemed a tad dry!! 8 hrs on low would probably address this - next time!

Family loved this, would use boneless center cut chops next time.
Served it over yellow rice and wished that I had cooked a few more, no leftovers tonight.

Very good recipe!!  Along with a previous reviewer...I got this recipe late in the day today....too late for the crock pot.  SO...I peppered and floured the pork chops (skipped the salt) browned them...then added a can of beef broth, the chopped onions and a packet of beefy onion soup...covered and let simmer for 45 minutes.  Then I took out the pork chops...stirred in the sour cream and it came out fantastic!  I may try low sodium beef broth next time as the gravy was a little salty...but all in all it was perfect!!!  I made mashed potatoes on the side...my picky husband and 4 year old daughter gobbled it up!!  Thanks!

We just finished eating this & it was fabulous!! My husband & kids loved it & so did I.  So easy & delicious -- it seems almost unreal that it was that simple.  I also browned the onions in the same pan as the pork chops.  It gave them really great flavor.  I also made the sauce in a pan on the stovetop instead of the slow cooker.  It only took 5 minutes and I did it as the noodles were boiling.  It was such a hit -- I will absolutely be making this again!  Thanks for sharing!

I did make a mistake and put a whole 16 oz container of sour cream instead of 8 oz. I had to thicken it up with moore flour. I added a little gravy master to give it a browner color. I thought the pork would be more tender. I would try it again.

This is a good weeknight dinner. The only thing I did differently was to brown the onions before adding to the slow cooker. I never care for the flavor of onions put raw into a slow cooker, they seem to get sour and don't taste done to me even though they cooked all day. The sauce is great with egg noodles!

My fiancee and I loved this.  We used boneless pork chops and I served it over noodles.  I used chicken broth instead of bouillon. I also poured the gravy into a pan and thickened it up, it worked better.  Still not real thick, but we liked it that way.  I liked all the gravy (even made double the second time) to use on the leftovers!

Absolutely loved them! I was worried about the gray from other reviews, but I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. The pork chops practically fall apart in your mouth. My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough. It is now a favorite!

Delicioius. I often use chicken broth in place of the boullion cubes for speed and simplicity.  I make this often.

One of our family favorites! I follow the recipe exactly & this comes out perfect every time. I make it twice a month & there are never are never any leftovers. My 15 year old daughter even cooked it a few weeks ago by herself to impress her friends. It was a huge hit! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I used thick boneless pork chops and turned a couple of times to make sure both sides were marinated enough before serving.  I am always looking for new dishes to serve.  Will definitely serve again.  Thanks!

I'm afraid we didn't think much of this recipe.  As others mentioned, the sour cream sauce really lacked flavor.  I tried to season it, but it just didn't work.  A gravy made of cream of mushroom and possibly celery soup would have been much better.  I did add baby carrots to the crockpot with the chops and the onions, and we did think that they added nice color and flavor.

I don't know why I didn't realize until I was putting this meal together that it was basically a stroganoff. I also added a can of mushroom soup for some flavor. It was okay, the kids didn't really care for it. With a few additions it might be really good, so I will keep trying.

This is the best slow-cooker recipe we've ever had.  The pork chops are fork-tender, the gravy very rich, very creamy.  Wonderful served over rice.

I really loved this recipe, it was fast and easy.  My son loved it. I served rice with  it as a side dish and it went really well with the sour cream gravy.

These were very tender, disappeared quickly. I expected the sauce to get thicker although it still had a good flavor.

The pork cops were good, but thank goodness I reduced the cooking time. After 3 hours on low, the chops had reached 170 degrees. If I wouldn't have checked the temperature, they would have been over cooked.

Chops came out dry but the sauce helped a bit. The sour cream mixture didn't make the sauce thick. I had to use cornstarch and water to thicken it

I made this on a night when the temperatures were very cold.  My family like it but it was a bit too bland for us.  I loved how tender the pork chops were and the sauce had good flavor, just too bland.  I will try this one again and add a bit more seasonings.

Rate this like a 3 1/2 because not the whole family liked this. My daughter and her friend devoured it, I also liked it, but my husband and other 2 kids were forced to eat it.  It is better if you add cream of mushroom or chicken to the crockpot while it cooks. The pork was so tender and juicy but maybe the husband thought it wasn't flavorful enough.  If for me and my oldest, it would be a keeper though, oh well!

These pork chops were to die for!    I sauteed the onions first, and used extra sour cream, which made this dish even better;   since I no longer have a slow cooker,  I made these in a skillet....they came out amazing! I also made home made mashed potatoes, which was delish with the gravy.  My roommate, who is very picky with what he eats, even came back for seconds...will definitely make this again!

Almost flavorless meat. Maybe I didn't put enough seasoning on the meat? It was tender but gross flavour. Very disappointing. Easy enough to make. But I'm only giving it 3 stars and the third star is for the sauce. It's the only thing that made the meat edible.

I've made this a few times and it is always a hit! I don't like my meat falling apart so I don't let it cook to that point and I've  done this stove top.  Both ways are delicious!

This was delicious and oh so easy!  I didn't want to cook it for several hours, so I used my instant pot and cooked for an hour instead.  The meat was super tender and very flavorful.  The only "change" I made was that I put the bouillon into chicken stock/broth rather than water.

Very good. Used loin pork with bone in. Similar to pork steaks.  Didn’t brown meat. Just sprinkled with garlic salt, seasoning salt, pepper and marjoram.  Used half carton of chicken broth.  Topped with onions.  Had on low for about 4 hours then turned to high for 3 hours or so.  Fell off the bone.  Strained sauce into pot.  Added cream of mushroom soup, some Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce.  Thickened with cornstarch served over linguine with peas and salad.

This has become my favorite  pork chop recipe.  I used Ky Kernal seasoned flour for the breading and sauce. Also added a. bag of baby carrots  as a side. Chops came out moist and fork tender. Simply  delicious.

This was the first slow cooker recipe I ever made ! It is phenomenal! Absolutely a winner ! I haven’t changed a thing because you don’t fix what  isn’t broken ! ??
 Hint : if you have any sauce left over save it , I used it for stroganoff the next night - total hit ! ??

These pork chops were fantastic!  Very moist and tender!  After removing the browned chops from the skillet, I melted about 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan, added the sliced onions, sprinkled with a little salt, and sauteed them for about 3 - 4 minutes, stirring constantly.  This helped to release the flavor of the onions before adding them to the pork chops in the slow cooker.  I also used low sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon and water.  The chops were perfectly done in about 4 and a half hours. Served with mashed potatoes and the yummy sour cream gravy, my husband said they were the best chops he had ever eaten!

The recipe looked delicious. I bought good pork chops and seasoned them well and let them cook until they fell away from the bone.  The meat and sauce were both bland.

Delicious. Easy to make. The sauce came out perfectly. Paired it with mashed potatoes and used the sauce as a gravy. So good. Totally recommend this.

I took the advice of some others that made it in a pan for 45 minutes instead of a slow cooker.  Next time I'll use my Instant Pot  and probably get it done in 30 minutes.  I used one cup chicken broth and 1 cup mushroom gravy along with  the sautéed onion.  I always substitute greek yogurt for sour  cream to be healthier.  It was fantastic.  You can tweak this recipe  pretty much anyway you want.  Hard to ruin it.

Hubby and I both consider this a keeper. I've made it multiple times. The only change I made was to use canned chicken broth instead of water/bouillon. Tip: Be sure that your slow cooker will return to a boil to thicken the gravy, or transfer it to a sauce pot on the stove.

Used cream of chicken soup after reading others notes. Still felt it was kind of bland.Maybe next time will add garlic in addition to the garlic powder on the meat.

Made with rice pilaf and roasted carrots. The extra sauce was delicious mixed into the rice.

It is delicious! I used chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes.  I mixed the broth, cream of mushroom soup and sour cream in the slow cooker and placed the pork chops in the sauce.  I didn't need to thicken the gravy it was fine without doing that. Will definitely make it again!

Excellent and easy! Like others, don’t know that the browning was necessary and probably won’t do that next time. Also prepared the sauce on the stovetop instead of in the crockpot. Came out a little thinner than I normally like. Nothing a little corn starch can’t help with. Served with rice for wife and mashed potatoes for me. Topped with French’s Original French Fried Onions. Big thumbs up!

Made this today and followed the directions exactly as in the recipe. Maybe my expectations were too high after reading a lot of the reviews, but I was not crazy about this dish. It was just ok and I will probably not be eating the leftovers and will not be making this again.

Because we are a family of 2 with small appetites, I cooked only 2 chops, but I used ½ the sauce. Tender, yes. Succulent? No way. these were REALLY  dry. Neither of us could eat even one. The sauce had nice flavor, but the dry meat was not appetizing.

Love this recipe cuz it's SOOO easy!!! Due to thickness/thinness of 9 chops, only needed 4 hours on low for them to be falling apart. This recipe is one of the BEST ways to do pork chops, I love the flavor  & the sauce. Only changes I made was to add  Sweet Thai basil to sauce, Cavender's Greek Seasoning to the flour for dredging & to mix with sour cream, greek yogurt in my case,  for thickening the sauce. Boyfriend says "This is the way to make pork chops!"

It was Great!  I would add a little more spice was a little bland. Some of my chops we're dry so I would add more liquid to the make sure the ones on top we're covered.

This recipe is awesome. My husband loved it, too. The only thing I did differently was to use 2 cups chicken stock instead of boiling water and chicken bouillon cubes. I will definitely make this again!

Used only 3 pork chops and left liquids as is.  This took only 6 hours in my crockpot so removed to a loaf pan and warmed in the oven.  Wonderful over egg noodles.

I made for family and friends exactly as recipe calls for with one small exception. I used glutin free flour. My wife has some glutin sensitivity.
Will definitely make again.

Even following the reviewers’ suggestions and doubling the seasoning didn’t prevent this dish from turning out as bland as a glass of tepid water. A total waste of primo Berkshire porterhouse pork chops. Whoever posted this recipe must have no taste buds. I won’t make this mistake again.

These are very good. I served them on a bed of rice and grilled red peppers on the side. I browned the chops in a skillet and cooked them in a pressure cooker for 45 minutes instead of the crockpot. They were so tender and delicious. I will make this recipe again!!!

I will definitely make this delicious dish again. I didn’t have time to do it in my slow cooker so I used my Insta pot for sautéing the meat and then just added everything else. I also added some sliced sweet potatoes. Cooking it on high pressure in the Insta pot for 12 minutes was perfect. After I removed the pork chops to keep them warm,  I added the sour cream & thickening agent (I use arrowroot instead of flour).  Then I used the slow cook button on the Insta pot and cooked it for an additional 10 minutes. It was perfect!

I will make this again. The sour cream added a little sweetness to my rice which I like. Since I like onions so much I'm going to make it again using two onions instead of just one. I was surprised how good this turned out.

I made the recipe as written. The pork chops were indeed tender. The sour cream gravy left a lot to be desired. It was runny and a little too sour. Maybe it would have improved the flavor to use half the amount of sour cream and a little more flour to thicken. I served this meal with a side of Yukon gold potatoes and the potatoes were the tastiest part of the meal!

I am being generous at 1. Chops were indeed  tasty and tender but the sauce was a disappointment.

Husband could not stop ummming while eating these. They were in his words...………….. excellent!  Did not have time to use slow cooker so I used stovetop. Ready in 10 minutes. Only difference was I fried the onions after browning the meat. Will be making this again and again!

The chops were  tender, The sour cream gravy was a little too much. The flavor was sharp. Reminded me of stroganof.  Good with rice. Probably a good winter day meal because it was hearty.

It's a little on the "work but we're pretending it's not" dish. Honestly, if I want to spend 20 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes at night fixing dinner, there are better dishes out there.
That said, the family liked it, and the pork was super super tender. I think the extra sauce (and there was a lot of extra sauce) will go great on egg noodles.

I had to change cooking times to just about 4 hours but the chops and sauce were so tasty!  I also had to finish the sour cream sauce on the stove but using the crock to get the chops and onions tender was a time saver!
I seasoned the chops then dredged them in flour.

I seasoned my chops with salt and pepper, then in a large cast iron skillet, added small amount of oil cooked to slightly brown, I use about 10 to 12 ounces of sour cream to cover, the small amount of oil will thin the cream a little cook on medium low, add 1/2 sliced onion cut in half and let simmer about 45 minutes until tender, I added mushrooms the last 10 minutes of cooking. I served hot over rice with a salad on the side

Love it!  My changes:  seasoned with a ton of cracked pepper on both sides before searing on high.  Then pretty much follow the rest exactly as written.  I have made in the oven as well, low heat like 200/250, and cook for 3-4 hours which is fine.  Also, I use thick cut, bone in pork chops for best results.  But, cooking low and slow yields a tender, fall apart chop even if not using a bone-in cut.  I have also made it with mushrooms, and if I didn't have chicken stock or broth, I have used beef or store bought pork.

I rated this a one for the simple fact you don’t have to slow cook these! Follow directions for browning them then take them out of fry pan get rid of brown bits and make the sauce in the fry pan on low so as not to curdle the sourcream! Place pork back in simmer  on low and your done!

Its hard to rag on those that make all manner of changes and then claim its not worthy of a higher rating particularly when the photo shows something additional in the sauce. Possibly mushrooms? At any rate, I followed the recipe and it was quite flavorful. I am sure one can add seasonings to taste and still stay true to the original recipe  A very nice and flavorful change.

I used thin cut pork chops and browned the onions before placing in crock pot. I cut water down to 1 cup but still used the 2 chicken bouillon cubes. Served it over bow tie pasta.

Perhaps not the most intricate or fancy porkchops -- still an instant classic in my mind, deserving of 5 stars for the ease/simplicity to taste/enjoyment ratio. I've made this recipe numerous times now, and am becoming known for it in my family. Many of the suggestions in comments are fantastic -- this recipe is just a simple, solid base for creamy, tender pork chops

The pork chops smelled amazing when frying and were so soft out of the crock pot, but the sauce was really runny and just tasted like watered down sour cream, which diluted the pork flavor and made it more like flavorless chicken.

Wow, this is true comfort food.  Very heavy and very rich.  I reduced the amount of liquid from 2 c. to 1/2 c. for my crock, which actually gains liquid during cooking (don't asking me where it comes from but when done, I had at least 1 1/2 cups of liquid).  I added a little water and made my gravy.  So good.  My b/f who normally picks onions out of anything I cook, ate everything.  Yummo!  This will def fill you up and but good.  Ate this with a side of basil potatoes and cauliflower.  What a meal.

I made this almost to the recipe but since I don't like garlic and onions I omitted those and added some general poultry seasoning along with the salt, pepper, paprika to the flour before dredging the chops.  Everything else was to the letter.  I browned the chops in some oil before putting in the crockpot but I might try skipping this step next time to see if makes much of a difference because it would make it easier to make before running off to work in the morning.  I've never had pork chops so tender before in my life!  I didn't need to use a knife once even after reheating the leftovers the next day in the microwave for lunch!  Served with broccolini and  mashed potatoes.  This makes a lot of sauce (about 2 cups) so we had extra even after adding to the mashed potatoes.  We kept it to use on something else we cook this week because it was good and don't want to waste it!

I made this last night and with the help of a 12 year old positive review and her changes it was a hit with my picky wife. Check out her changes under "Most helpful positive review". I only made two 1 1/2"  thick boneless chops. Because we are on a Keto diet, I served them with steamed veggies. Dyn-O-Mite. Thank you for your suggestions!

This was good. I really liked the process of things, especially the sour cream sauce. My only complaint is, while I loved that the meat was fall off the bone tender, I did not like that the bones fell apart. It was very hard to distinguish between bone and meat just by looking at it...and no matter how careful my husband and I were, we both managed to get a mouthful of smaller bones at least once. Perhaps boneless pork chops would be better but it may compromise the flavor. If I make these again I will keep a better eye on the cooking time. I only cooked for 5.5 hours on low this time. I guess my crock pot cooks faster than average. Flavor was nice though and we ate this over egg noodles with a side of roasted Brussel sprouts.

Have made this recipe twice so far, and really like it.  The pork chops come out very tender.  The second time I added some fresh sliced mushrooms and I think I will do this again. I lightly sauteed the onions and mushrooms before adding them to the slow -cooker.

This was good, but my sauce came out rather thin. There was a lot of juice left over, so it made a ton of sauce, so it probably needed some more flour.

My whole family loved this meal. The only things I did different was to use butter with the oil when browning the pork chops and adding some of the left over oil/butter into the crock pot with the chicken broth. I will definitely be making this again!

This was not for me. My pork chops weren’t super thick so I only cooked in crock pot for 4 hours. They were very tender, but had a rather overlooked  tastelessness. I have trouble adding sour cream to hot sauces. It always breaks up into little “dots” and doesn’t look smooth no matter how long I mix. It was edible but not something I think I’d make again.

This was excellent and my whole house smelled so good!  One big error I made  - I used pork chops bone-in.  They were so tender that the meat fell off the bone and I had to handpick all the bones out (because some were very small).  I will most definitely make this again but with boneless pork chops!

I didn't have time to use a slow cooker and adjusted for 2 servings.  I seared the chops in an iron skillet, covered and put  in a 325 degree oven for 20-25 minutes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  The chops were very flavorful and very tender.  For those who think  some recipes are bland, most specify "or season to taste" after the ingredient.   We enjoyed these chops and will definitely make again.

Very good!  Started late so couldn't use the slow cooker. with the help of some other reviews I made it on the stove top. Browned the chops and removed them using the pan to cook the onions then put the chops  back in with broth. Covered pan and let simmer for forty five minutes. Added the sour cream flour mixture and simmered an additional five minutes. No Change with seasoning. Great taste.

l will make it again, I fiddled with quantities it was just for two and instead of taking chops out of slow cooker I very carefully drained the juices into a pan and left the chops in cooker while I made the sauce. It was delicious.

Although our pork chops came out wonderfully, I am only giving this recipe 4 stars because I deviated so far away from it, but owe my inspiration to the original recipe! Seasoned the chops with S/P, Paprika and  garlic, then seared them on the stove top. placed the onion, chops, and more garlic in Slow Cooker, then covered with Progresso Cream of Mushroom Soup (I am Gluten intolerant and Progresso is the only creamy soup I can find without added flour). Later added about a cup of wine and several drained cans of sliced mushrooms. I have a tendency to sniff herbs combined with the scent of the cooker to evaluate what goes with what , so I added several herbs that seemed to enhance the flavor (can't remember which herbs, but my method does work!) It really made the house smell heavenly. My hubby said it reminded him of "Pork Stroganoff". 4 hours was all that was needed to provide succulent chops that still held together.

Absolutely wonderful. I did add some flour to the sour cream mixture after the pork chops were finished cooking to make a gravy. Put the gravy over the chops and mashed potatoes.  I did add some extra seasonings to it also.

Delicious! I butterflied large boneless center cut chops. seasoned with a garlic powder and a light breadcrumb mix rather than flour. Baked for about 15 min at 350. Made sour cream sauce with onion and mushrooms but also added fresh spinach which I threw in as the sauce thickened.  ladled the sauce over the butterflied chops, popped back in the oven for another 5 min  to marry the flavors. Re topped  chops with a little more sauce.  Served with a side of jasmine rice and fresh green beans.  I'll make this again for pork and also try it with chicken!

This was very delicious! I  added a little paprika and seasoned salt to the chops, and instead of taking them out I just added the sour cream and flour the last hour of cooking and whisked in. It was creamy and not to thin.

This is a new family fave. I modified it and used my pressure cooker instead of a slow cooker.

I made this dish for the first time and it turned out awesome. The gravy was flavorful and the pork chwes were very tender. The only thing I added a package of pork gravy mix to thicken the sauce and served it with mashed potatoes. I will definitely make this dish again.

This was really good but I worked with what I had. 4 - 1 1/2 inch boneless chops. I spiced them and fried them in garlic and white truffle oil enough to brown slightly. Dredged in flower,  placed in crock pot. Fried 1/2 onion and 2 cups leeks in leftover oil. Added 1/2 a can of chicken broth to bottom of crock pot and the rest to the frying pan. After leeks/onion cooked down I added them on top of chops. Cooked on low 4 hours. Last half hour I sprinkled 2 Tlb flower over chops added 1/2 can cream of chicken soup a cup of sour cream. Cooked 1/2 hour. Served over white rice. Yum. Moist and tender creamy.

This was very good. My husband really liked it. I added mushrooms to it which gave it some extra heft which I enjoyed almost more than the pork! I sautéed the onions before adding to the crockpot and I cooked the sauce on the stove top to move things along. Will absolutely make again.

The pork was very tender but the sauce was not flavorful.  It didn't add much to the recipe.  Probably will not make it again.

Delicious! These chops weren't as tender as I would have liked, but that could have been the quality of the  pork and not the recipe. Wonderful combination of flavors.

This recipe was OK.  However, it was bland and truly lacked good flavor.  If I make it again, I will definitely add more seasoning to the pork.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the chops were bland. The sauce never thickened up. I went back and read and reread looking for what went wrong.  I always like to try a recipe as directed first before doctoring it, but this was one I should have  doctored first.  It just missed the mark.

Fabulous!!!  Made this using some of the suggestions of other cooks. We like things to be a little more intense, so I used extra garlic powder and some Cavenders Greek Seasoning to season pork chops before dredging.  Then I did use the mushroom soup as others have suggested.  At the end I also added one pound of sliced mushrooms, just before stirring in the sour cream.  Served over No Yolks noodles, with homemade french bread and a salad.  Wonderful dinner!  I love crock pot meals :)

I took the advice of adding Emeril seasoning in the flour which was great. Instead of bouillon, I used chicken broth. After I browned the chops, I added the chicken broth to deglaze the pan to get all of the dripping flavorings! I then poured the boiling broth into the crock pot. Very tasty!

I modified with extra seasoning and still found it a bit bland.  I added sliced mushrooms and onions with the chops, seasoned the dredging flour, used chicken stock instead of bouillon, plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and cooked for 8 hrs. Next time I will up the seasoning even more and cook for shorter time- they fell apart but seemed a bit chewy. The flavor did seem better eating leftovers- I enjoyed it more the next day.

I followed the basic ingredients but cooked in the oven.  I dredged in the flour and seasoned with garlic salt and pepper, then put in the oven at 350 in a covered dish.  While they were baking, I sautéed the onion along with mushrooms till lightly browned then placed on top of the chops. I then poured warm homemade broth into the pan and continued to bake for about an hour to hour and half.  I removed the chops and made the gravy in the same pan.  It was delicious.

This was great, my entire family loved it. I added a few extra spices to the flour, but cooked the pork exactly as recommended. I accidentally added too much sour cream when making the sauce so I used a can of cream of onion soup to the sauce and cooked a few minutes extra. Delicious! 
Served over egg noodles and it was just perfect. Will make again.

Threw in a little sliced bell pepper since I had it available, and seasoned the chops with a blend... otherwise followed the recipe pretty much as written. Very tender - no knife needed.
I thickened the sauce in a separate pot since that's faster than using a slow cooker, and used Wondra flour to ensure no lumps.
Served over Rice A Roni. Boyfriend gave it a big "Mmmmmm!" and inhaled it.

I loved it. Never had slow cooked pork chops but now it's my favorite way of cooking. I followed the whole thing except the sour cream...=( oops I got health conscious. But next time I will cut in half the stock, the flour, and maybe a few spoons of sour cream.

Incredible dish! I'm not a lover of pork because it can be dry. Not so with this recipe.  I had pork tenderloin on hand so I cut half of it into five pieces and substituted it for the pork chops and served it over buttered noodles.  Fantastic flavors and the pork was so tender you could cut it with a fork. This one is a keeper.

I'll give this recipe 5 stars. I didn't read the recipe all the way through before making this. When it came time to make it I didn't realize it was meant as a crackpot dish. With my guest coming in an hour I made this into an oven dish. I followed recipe as it read. Made minor 
modification to the flour by seasoning it with the seasoing it called for on the chops. 
browned on each side.
added to baking pan and baked on high.
made sauce in baking pan.
sauce came out darker than the pictures but it was flavorful and better than it looked.

I really enjoy this - as does my husband. We have been trying to switch up from chicken recipes all the time. You can do the basic recipe in a pan on the stovetop if you don't have enough time for the crockpot and want these same flavors, but nothing beats the fall-apart texture you can get by slow cooking.

This was so easy. My family said they were the best chops ever.  I paired the dish with a baked potato and the sauce over the potatoes made them on point!  I would cut the sauce in half .

These are extremely tender and have a great flavor. I had to add extra chicken broth to cover 6 pork chops in my crockpot and then the sauce was a little thinner.  I just thickened it up with a little corn starch and it was perfect.

I'm sure this would have been good as is, but I did make some modifications. I added some seasoning (gp, op, and others), as well as some carrots and celery. Turned out great! Would make again.

Not a recipe I'll make again. While the meat is very tender, the flavor is pretty bland.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed other's suggestions and did not brown the pork chops before putting them in the crock pot.  I also made the sauce in a saucepan, not the crock pot, also as suggested by others.  I will definitely make this again!

I made it as is, no changes. Hubby couldn't stop raving about it. The only thing I found was that the sauce didn't thicken enough at the end after adding in the flour and sour cream. Would perhaps use a slurry of cornstarch instead of flour next time. Otherwise, delish !!

I seasoned my chops as I normally would if I were frying them, after browsing on both sides as the recipe directed I followed the rest of the instructions,  served with mashed potatoes and green beans, my husband and kids loved it. Chops were very tender, fell of the bone!

Really 4.5 stars - it is EXCELLENT. It doesn't need the sour cream (which neither added nor detracted from the flavor). It didn't need the mushrooms I added later.  What it could use is a bit of thyme, a few peppercorns, and a bay leaf. It's a lot like the old Coors "Bellycheaters Brisket" recipe, but for pork.  The onions cooking all day really make it, and minor tweaks would round out the profile of the AMAZING sauce.

As the recipe was written, it was very bland as others have stated.  Definitely will try again with others' suggestions of cream of mushroom soup.  The sauce was just meh.  Pork chops were very tender.

This turned out to to be a good recipe. After reading the reviews I made a few changes. I mixed chicken stock, sour cream and a can of cream of celery together. With the pork chops, I did a egg wash and coated with seasoned flour (garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper) and fried in olive oil.  I lined the bottom of the  slow cooker with onions. Then put the chops in added the chicken stock mixture. Cooked for 6 hours on high. 

Before dinner was over everyone said this was a keeper.

I used adobo seasoning in place of garlic powder, salt & pepper.
Otherwise I followed directions.  I served it with stuffing and a salad.
I take care of SEVEN teenage boys, so I have a lot of appetites to contend with.
This was a huge hit !!! I will be adding it to my favorites.
Thank you

Fall off the bone in soft delicious meat bites.  This recipe was super easy.  I think I would amp up the garlic a bit more next time.

It was a nice crockpot recipe and was ready to go when I got home from work.  What I like is that there is NO CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP in it.  I hate that gray can of blop and any recipe that has it in it.  If I added anything to it next time, I would add a bit of Dijon mustard and possibly sauté the onion in pan juices after cooking the chops.  It was very nice as written as well.

I really love this recipe. My pork chops were never tender. I am not a "great"  cook but get by. I never rate a recipe unless I make it as is. I did and the chops were so tender! My husband loved them. What is so great about this recipe is it is also modifiable. I have done tons of different stuff from adding rosemary and thyme to my seasoned flour since I have dried herbs from the garden, mushrooms, pearl onions. I even made it with cubed roast! I used beef broth on that one. I tried the most popular rating and tried cream of mushroom soup too. You do get more sauce but the flour is too much. So try the recipe as is and you will love it! Do as she suggested and season to taste. My next one will be with chicken! Happy cooking!!

Made this. Is absolutely delicious. One of the best new recipes I've made in a long time. I never took the chops out of the slow cooker. Just left them in there and added the sauce right on top of them. Added some frozen peas & carrots the last 30 minutes. That way I didn't have to make any vegetables separately. Cooked the pasta & put it into the slow cooker too at the end. An all in one pot meal. I will definitely be making this again.

Pretty easy to do. Came out great. Made it to the recipe and it was fantastic. Next time, I'll season the flour (helps carry over flavor) and use thinner porkchops so I can do in a pan inst ad of the slow cooker. Very nice recipe as is though.

Excellent! Tender like you wouldn't believe. I made mine on the stove top. Made the recipe as is, the only exception being I cooked them on the stove for oh, and hour and a half I think. Put the chops in the oven while I made the sauce, then added the chops back into the sauce. Fantastic! I love an easy, super tasty dinner. Thanks!

I am not a pork chop fan, mainly because my husband prefers to shake and bake them. But when I saw this, and knew I had all the ingredients, supper was on. This was easy, and it doesn't take 7-8 hours. I put them on HIGH for 3 hours, and they turned out delicious. I thought the dish needed more salt so sprinkled that on my serving. This is tender, succulent, and flavorful- served over mashed potatoes.

Looking for easy, i am not looking to dirty saucepan to cook pork chops, then dirty slow cooker simmering them, then dirty another pan keeping them in the over.
Few ingredients, one cook, is what i am looking for, after 60 years of cooking why complicate things if you dont need to.
I could adjust this recipe to do all in slow cooker and take about half the personal time to prepared.
I love my slow cooker and use it all the time.

As per reviewer; seasoned the chops w/ s,p, & garlic and onion  powder, then dredged in flour seasoned w/ pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and a little cayenne pepper... then browned in a little olive oil.  **OR ---I used 5, 2" thick chops, seasoned with s,p,gp (salt, pepper, garlic powder), THEN I dreged them through highly seasoned flour (just use what you like). I browned them in garlic infused oil. I then browned the onions & put them on top of chops in crock pot. For the sauce, I used 2 cups chicken broth, seasoned w/fresh garlic, paprika, s,p,gp, and few other random things, and 1 can cream of mushroom soup. Poured it over chops & cooked on LOW for 4 hours.  Last, I added sauteed fresh mushrooms & the sour cream AFTER moving chops to oven.  used only 4 oz. sour cream though..  per another reviewer;  I just browned my chops in my cast iron skillet w/onions, removed the chops just long enough to make a roux, added 2 cups of chicken broth instead of the water & simmered for 45  minutes. After they were done I again removed them from the skillet & added the sour cream & cooked for a minute.

I did improvise a little on this recipe, but the foundation of it seemed like a good place to start. I used bone in pork chops. Seasoned my flour generously with seasoned salt, garlic, pepper, some chili powder. Browned the chops in a cast iron, took them out of the skillet, turned down the heat; added butter and then the onions. Turned up the heat; Sautéed the onions until very brown and "smothered" and added them to the chops in the crock pot. I heated up some chicken broth, added a little flour/milk mix and stirred. Added most of this mixture to the crock pot. At the end I added fresh thyme and rosemary to the crock pot then the sour cream mixed with a little of the leftover broth. I made roasted cauliflower and garlic; mashed it up with butter and served it as a low carb side with the chops. It was delicious!!

I love the fact that this recipe dose NOT call for canned soup. Not sure why so many people would try this recipie and dump a can of soup in it. 

I seasoned flour with garlic powder and Baby Bam. Since I didn't want to use my crock pot, I baked my boneless chops for about 15 min at 375. Caramelized my onions and added mushrooms and garlic. Deglazed pan with. 1 c chicken broth and a splash of Worcestershire  sauce and added tyhme. 

Next time I will make a roux after cooking the onions. I think low fat sour cream would work well too.

5-stars with modification - the sauce was too thin, so I added a bit more flour to thicken it up.  Other than that, it was great!  My son doesn't like meat with sauce of any kind, and he ate it all.  I'll be making this again.

This is really great recipe, my family love it.
I made small changes to recipe - I set time to 6 hours only on Slow, and after these six hours, I just removed pork chops a side, blended sourcream and flour into the sauce and returned pork chops back to slowcooker for futher 15 minutes on High temperature...

Since it was too late to make this in the slow cooker, I cooked these in my electric skillet & made the following modifications:
3 bone-in pork chops, approx. 1" thick
2 large onions, sliced
1 14.5oz. can low sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes
1 10 ¾ oz. can cream of mushroom soup
1 small container of sour cream

I browned the chops until very dark in olive oil, sprinkling Lawry's Seasoned Salt, garlic powder & a little paprika on one side, Lawry's Seasoned Pepper & Herbes de Provence (a mixture of rosemary, thyme, basil, marjoram, fennel, sage, & lavender) on the other side while browning; removed chops & 
browned the onions in the same skillet.  Then I added enough flour to make a roux. When the roux had browned sufficiently, I added the mshrm. soup & chicken broth, which I had previously whisked together.  I then put the chops & onions back into the skillet with the liquids & cooked at the lowest heat to keep them cooking until the chops were falling apart. I removed the chops & stirred in the sour cream, heating until hot again.   I served it over rice.  It was absolutely delicious!  My husband said they were the best  chops he has ever eaten in his life (he's 73!) & the 'gravy' was brown & rich.  I will be making this very often.

Added some kitchen boquet for color and added flavor. Also added frozen mushrooms I had stored in freezer. Just threw them on top pork chops in crock pot. Thickened up the gravy and sour cream on the stove like others suggested. My husband went back for seconds!

OMG! I've always liked pork chops but this is in a league of its own. Seriously, no knife required. I actually have to be really careful taking them out of the crock pot because they will fall apart!

I really wanted to like this recipe, basic as it was. I will agree that the pork chops turn out suuuper tender, but these were a little too bland for my taste.

This was really good served on rice. Seasoned the pork chops with Mrs. Dash herb and garlic seasoning and black pepper. Cooked in the slow cooker for about 6 hours on low, and the pork chops were deliciously tender but not falling apart. Will definitely make this again!

I was not a fan of this dish. The pork chops came out a strange texture almost like canned meat. Sort of a bland sauce as well. Not a winner in my books.

These pork chops were indeed tender and juicy. I wish I had measured as I added the seasonings so that I can duplicate or improve next time.  Since I just eyeballed the amounts, that will prove difficult.  I also had an issue with mixing the sour cream in.  No matter how much I stirred, I could still see tiny globules of the sour cream that didn't fully dissolve into the sauce.  Just an aesthetic issue, but if I make it again, will probably try mixing some of the pan juices into the sour cream gradually before dumping it into the pot.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe and we LOVED it.   I don't see the point of reviewing a recipe if you have made a ton of changes to it.  You're not really reviewing the recipe.  

We loved the sauce!  The whole meal paired great with noodles and broccoli.  

I will definitely be making this again

I used pork loin cut into 2" slabs. This cut down on trimming fat off chops and allowed me to used my desired thickness. Maybe a bit healthier that way. Mushrooms would be a simple, nice touch as well. The family and I loved this recipe. I am making it now for the second time this week to use the rest of the loin. 4 year old and 6 year old cleaned plates. It reminds me of a pork stroganoff.

This always turns out great, but I should change the name of it. Not a great fan of sour cream, so I use mascarpone cheese for the sauce. Eight ounces of mascarpone, and two additional of sour cream.  Enough sauce left over for other dishes, or just to use on mashed potatoes later.

Don't need to change anything except maybe a little spices in the flour for coating the pork chops.. Other than that, take it from someone who actually followed the recipe! It's a SIMPLE yet delicious comfort food. I'm eating the leftovers now.. So good. The pork chops are amazingly tender and the sour cream sauce is rich and creamy. I made amish egg noodles and cooked honey carrots with them. I did thicken the sauce at the end in a skillet, because that is a lot faster and we were so hungry! My husband loved the way the kitchen smelled when he got home :) This is a wonderful recipe that I will be making again for sure! Thanks for submission.

Followed the recipe the way it was written. I did sauté a small can of mushrooms bit did not add it to the slow cooker because the wife doesn't like them. I added them to my plate and poured the gravy on them. For a side I did buttered mashed potatoes. This ones a keeper!!!

Pretty good. My bone-in chops were thin so I cut the cooking time to about 4 hrs. I used half as much sour cream, same amount flour mixed in and after thickening a bit, added half can cream of mushroom soup as well as some sliced mushrooms and one sliced Jalapeno for heat. I put a couple smashed cloves of garlic in from the beginning as well. Put this over any starch...rice, pasta, quinoa etc.

I kept the pork chops in. Took out bones. I also added 1 and 1/2 tbsp of stone ground mustard when cooking with the chops and broth. Wonderful addition.

Very tender, tasty and easy to make.  Good as it was, the dish could use a bit more salt and spices. I added curry, but any favorite herb or spice would work.  I thickened the juice/gravy with corn starch.  Now that I have the basic recipe will definitely make again.

This is so easy, and extremely delicious.  I cut potatoes and put the in my cooker for the last hour.  I use my ninja cooking system, so it works as a fry pan, oven and slow cooker.  I put the meat on the wire rack for the last hour while i cooked the potatoes.  I tecommend this to anyone.

My family loved this recipe!  The only thing I did differently was add paprika when seasoning the pork and I browned the onions in the pan after searing the pork chops.  Don't want to leave that tasty flavor in the pan!  This is a definite make again recipe.  I served mine over brown rice.  Yumm! One thing to note....I used the thick cut boneless pork chops and trimmed of fat.  Don't know if it would had turned out differently with bone in or thin chops.

the taste was good, but I had SO much juice in the pot after cooking the chops.  I poured only half of it into a separate pan, thickened it w/flour and sour cream and it came out still very thin.  I cooked it quite a while on the stove and stopped because the sour cream started separating.  It never really got thick.  I might make again, but I won't add 2 cups of water to the crockpot before cooking.  Maybe 1 cup at most.

Love, love, love!  I modified the cooking a bit, since making this in the crockpot doesn't exactly save time or make things any easier... I just cooked the chops as instructed, used chicken broth and made the sauce on the stove, poured over chops, and baked for 1 hour on 350.  A direct quote from my husband:  "Oh my God, this is freaking awesome!" Definitely a keeper!  Will make again for sure and share with friends!  Wish I had leftovers!

I looked forward to this all day long. Followed the recipe. After 6 hours my pork was already 180+ and dry. I love the sour cream sauce but it didn't thicken, still tasty over noodles.

I would use boneless pork chops especially if you have kids.  The sauce takes a long time to thicken in the crock pot and required additional flour or put in a sauce pan on the stove to finish it off.

Made no changes and this recipe was delicious--all three of us eating dinner agreed.   I only cooked it for five hours and that was plenty.  I have searched and searched for a good pork chop recipe, and finally, this is it!  The pork--I cooked very large thick chops-- was falling off the fork tender and succulent.  I think that next time I will try chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes as it was just a little salty.  I am sure cream of mushroom soup instead of sour cream--or half of each--would be great, too.  Mashed potatoes, sauerkraut and cranberry sauce would be good sides to enjoy it with.  Festive enough for company.

Very tasty.  I made two changes, one was recommended by another reviewer which is to make the sour cream sauce on the stovetop vs crockpot.  It thickens up much faster.  The other change was that I added one envelope of onion soup mix.  This added a lot of favor.  I will make this again.  Yummy.

I didn't have time to make this is the crockpot, so I covered the porkchops in garlic, salt, and pepper and dredged in flour. Heated in olive oil until browned. Took them out and put them aside. Added a bit of white wine to get up the brown bits and cooked the onions until softened. Added the chicken broth and porkchops and simmered for about 20 min (I used thin porkchops). Took them out and added about 2 tsp flour and sour cream to the sauce and heated for about 5 minutes and topped the chops. Paired it with asparagus. Was very good.

OMG!  These are good even before you add the sour cream sauce!  Be sure to season them the way you like and you can't go wrong with this recipe.  I used Letfy's Spices Fish and Chicken seasoning.  So yummy!

Made it as written except cut the amounts for fewer people.  So rich and tender.   Definitely going in the keepers pile.

I did not make any changes to this recipe. I don't eat a lot of meat but my kids like to have some from time to time so I tried this out. I thought it was perfect as it was. My kids didn't like all the onions, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I will certainly make this again. Yum!!!

Made this for the first time about a year ago and make it at least once every other week since!  It's a big hit.  We prefer to serve with rice, mixing in the gravy until it's like a risotto.  So good!  Very comforting food.  Can't wait for dinner tonight.  Thanks for the recipe!

New Family Favorite! I threw in a cup of fresh mushrooms along with the sourcream.  Ran short on time, so they cooked on high for 3.75 hours. Turned out a bit tougher than described because of it, but still way better than my usual chops!

I made this for dinner tonight.  I cooked the chops for 7 hours on low in the crockpot as directed.  I then removed the chops and put them in a low heat oven.  I was a bit skeptical about putting only 2 T. of flour with the sour cream in the remaining liquid as there was so much liquid left.  Anyway, I did as directed with the sour cream and the flour and cooked on high in the crockpot for 30 minutes.  It didn't thicken as I wanted it to so I transferred it to a pot, put it on my gas stove and added about 3T of additional flour to thicken the gravy more.  This did the trick!  Overall, we loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

We LOVE these! They are so tender (you really do have to be careful when transferring them to the oven!) and absolutely delicious! I have trouble getting my son to eat "real meat" instead of things like corn dogs and chicken nuggets. He tried this and the first thing he said was "Mmmmmmm!!!!" He devoured it and so did the rest of my family. Wonderful recipe!

I followed suggestions by user ID "hisdrinkoffering", and yes, I would make it again.  The only change I would consider is not cooking the pork chops in crock pot after frying them.  The crock pot cooking removes the crisp coating on the chops.

Tasty, easy and the whole family enjoyed it.  Especially good for those times when you want to have a good meal with little prep.  When it was time to make the gravy, we fixed a pot of noodles and a salad. Great meal.

My entire family loved this recipe.  My two kids are VERY picky eaters and they wanted seconds.  My son did not like the sauce, but the rest of did.  I would recommend!  I did modify by adding more flour and a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  YUMMY!

I followed this almost exactly except I used my favorite bbq rub to season the chops before browning.  I cooked for 7 hours and the chops were tender and juicy.  My only regret is that I didn't make mashed potatoes, because I had more gravy than expected.  Next time I will pour the broth into the skillet to deglaze the pan before pouring the broth into the slow cooker, to add even more flavor.

This pork chop tasted great. I modified a little, I add additional seasoning to the sauce and cooked it in a sauce pan adding 2 tbls of flour to thicken. I also pulled the chops out of the cooker and re seasoned with the seasonings and re browned.

I love this recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing!  ...After eating my "Oma's" pork chops, I decided to also add sauerkraut.  The pork chops are great using either method.

Very interesting flavor!  I was thinking this would be a sauce very similar to paprikash, so I added paprika.  Wow!  The pork fell off the bone and the gravy was an added compliment to it.  I'll definitely be making them again!

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  It was not too bland.  My only trouble was that the sauce did not thicken as quickly as I needed it to.  That was an easy fix.  I put it in a pan and brought it to a boil and all was good.  Yummy!

Absolutely awesome and super easy! You really don’t even need to know how to cook to make this! I only changed a few things, like using fresh garlic and a variety of onions, an assortment of herbs and other seasoning. I did however add half of a packet of sour cream and onion dip mix to the sour cream before whisking in the sour cream to my slow cooker after the chops were done. Amazing! Very tender and super flavorful.

Husband raved about this. I've made it twice in two weeks actually. I am dairy free so I only added the sour cream to half the liquid.  I reserved the other half for myself and it was still delicious without the sour cream. I did add some Cajun seasoning just to spice the dish up.

We really enjoyed this dish. I really enjoyed the various elements, however - not sure if I was completely sold on the crockpot preparation. I did end up making the sauce in a saucepan on the stove while the chops were in the oven. I also felt that the chops were not as juicy and tender as I would have liked. I would be willing to try this again by roasting the chops in the oven and elimintating the crockpot altogether. Overall this was very tasty and I really liked the sour flavors of the sauce - definitely a different flavor profile than what we usually go for (lots of garlic, onion, etc).

This was a very good and very easy recipe. I only made one change and that was adding a can of cream of mushroom soup. Since I am gone during the day for about 11 hours I did not want the chops to dry out and adding the soup worked perfectly!

Made these today per the recipie, only variant being that I used a few cloves of fresh garlic in lieu of garlic powder. Overall pretty good! We LOVED the sour cream sauce! I'm not sure whether browning them really mattered much for the flavors, so might try skipping this step next time. But we will make this again! Thanks for this one!

Bland. I'm not sure where I thought the flavor would come from when I picked this recipe, but it was very bland for my taste. The sour cream didn't even have any flavor after mixing with the onion/meat/broth. It's like everything canceled each other out.

I loved this recipe! I have never been a huge fan of pork chops because i find them to be dry but this recipe was a definite winner with my husband and myself. Will keep it around for sure. The only thing i did different was add an extra bouillon cube and put the seasonings in the flour and on the pork to get more flavor. Also upped the sour cream and flour mixture a little bit to get more thickness. Yummy!

I've made variations of this dish over the years for it was my dad's goto dish when I was a kid.  But although the meat was incredibly tender (as it should be)... I didn't care for the "sauce".  So from now on I will simply stick with the potatoes and cream of mushroom soup... the way my dad made it.  NOTE:  I used both a leaner center cut chop & a fattier shoulder chop... the shoulder is the way to go!!

The only change I made was to season the sauce and added a little more flour to thicken it faster. Otherwise followed the recipe as is and it was good. Pork fell apart it was so tender. My husband never likes my cooking and he said twice it was good!

I've tried this recipe a few times and it is delicious!  I prepared the recipe today using lite sour cream.  I could not tell a difference and I will be using lite sour cream from now on since I'm trying to eat healthier!  I don't always brown the chops before placing into the crock pot and it still turns out great.  Today, I cooked it on high for 3 hours and they were perfect!  I really don't think you can go wrong with this recipe!  It's a keeper in our house!

This is one of my favorite slow cooker meals that I make quite frequently. The pork comes out so tender and the sauce is delicious. Mushrooms would make a great addition to this dish.

This recipe has become a household favorite! I brown the chops on the weekend then freeze them. I put the chops in frozen and it makes for quick preparation before heading of to work.

Using the modifications of the Most Helpful Positive Review by "hisdrinkoffering", it turned out fantastic! We added the spices to taste to the flour mixture, added the can of mushroom soup to cook with, and when doing the gravy, used 4 tablespoons of flour instead of two. The pork was tender, flavorful, and the gravy was great! Ate that over wide egg noodles with a side of green beans--great dinner, very filling!

Very moist tender chops - and I usually can't eat pork chops because of the texture.  I used rotisserie chicken seasoning before dredging the chops, sauteed the onion with garlic in olive oil, and then cooked them for 3 hours on high, 1 hour on low.  Popped them in a 200 degree oven while finishing up the sauce, and they were cooked perfectly.  The sauce really didn't thicken up much, and if I'd had the time, I probably would've added even more flour and cooked it on the stovetop - but it was good anyway.

Update - 1/9/14 - Made these tonight with the changes from the 'most helpful review', and I think it was even better.  Still used the rotisserie chicken seasoning, then threw the chicken broth in the pan to deglaze the pan and scrape up the browned bits.  I mixed in a can of cream of mushroom soup before adding it to the crockpot over the chops.  I sautéed the onion in a little olive oil and added the garlic for a moment at the end, and then added just a bit more chicken broth.  Probably should've added the onions to the crockpot before the broth/soup mix, but it still worked out just fine.  I cooked about an hour on high and 4 hours on low, then removed chops to the oven to keep warm while thickening the sauce.  It made a LOT of sauce - no need to double.

My husband loved this and my neighbor. I thought it was great as well.  I'd probably give what I made a four but I just made it on the stove as well as I could but I'm sure it would be even better in a slow cooker.

This recipe was pretty good. The chops were very tender and moist. Cooked them about 6 1/2 hrs in the crock. My husband loved them! I thought they were a little bland, next time I will spice them up more.  Served with mixed veggies and mashed red potatoes.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've never fed these to anyone who didn't love them.  They're so easy, and go great with mashed potatoes- especially red potatoes.  The sauce makes a delicious gravy, and the onions cook down so they're not at all overwhelming.  I frequently make this for sunday dinner.

I put potatoes and an onion in the crockpot but that's the only changes I made. I thought this was easy and used ingredients typically in one's kitchen - but the chops were tasteless, according to DH and myself, and the gravy appeared lumpy, though it's flavor was delicious.

I've read lots of recipes on AR, but this one I've USED over and over again.  I've made just three pork chops in my little slow-cooker and today I'm making five in a larger one- the recipe works either way.  I like to serve this with Reame's frozen egg noodles.

I did not care for this dish. I cooked as directed but seasoned chops with seasoned salt and garlic powder. The sour cream sauce was ok, but nothing special. It was like chicken paprika without flavor.

Loved it! Followed all the tips others gave and it turned out delicious. I did marinate it w/ some extra spices like onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper and some paprika, a little of everything.

My husband LOVED this. I followed it to a "t" except that I added cream of mushroom, per reviewers  suggestions. I added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic with the onion as well. The sauce was way more than we needed, but better too much than too little! We'll definitely make this again. Thank you!

The whole family really liked these.  It was a nice change to the pork chop norm.  I made as recipe stated, only I cooked on high for an hour, then medium the rest of afternoon...for a total of 4 hours.  Came out so tender too.  The only change I will make next time is to reduce the amount of sour cream...it was just a tad too creamy for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

This ended up reminding me of a pork roast instead of pork chops since it fell of the bone so nicely but the flavor is awesome! Sauce is good on mashed potatoes too! Thanks for the recipe :)

I made this exactly as set out.  I notice some people referring to a rating that claimed it had little flavour, I have to disagree with that.  My family LOVES this recipe!  It's so easy to make, even with the dredging and browning before it goes to the slow cooker.  The chops come out so tender, they fall apart while I'm trying to get them out of the slow cooker.  This is a family favourite that I we will make for years to come.  Hats off to those reviewers that changed it and made it their own, but I really think it's great just the way it is!

Oh my.... I've been eyeing this recipe some time now, and FINALLY decided to give it a try! My fiance can be "picky" sometimes, but usually eats whatever I put in front of him (even if he thinks it's gonna be icky). Tonight was the exception. My fiance ate one pork chop (he will ALWAYS try anything I put in front of him, even the strawberries he's hated since childhood lol) - that's it! It was the gravy that turned him off.... Since I covered our mashed potatoes with it, he wouldn't even eat those!!! I didn't find the gravy "repulsive," but wasn't jumping out of my seat to have seconds either. I pretty much followed Ami's directions exactly, except for subbing seasoned salt for plain table salt and adding all of my spices (i.e. seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder) to my flour to save a step. Dredging my pork chops in a plastic Zip-lock bag made clean-up a breeze. Note: I had to pour my cooked liquid  / sour cream mixture (I mixed my sour cream and flour together before adding) into a saucepan and bring to a boil for several minutes to thicken. My gravy was still thinner than I liked.... I tried the slow cooker method suggested, but my sour cream wouldn't completely melt (looked gross). Oh well! My fiance would give this 0 stars, but to be fair (I thought this was "OK"), I'll give 3. Served with taters, green beans and dinner rolls, this was a filling meal. Thanks for sharing, AMI! :-)

Very easy prep. The pork chops were amazing, moist, fall apart delish. The sour cream sauce needed some doctoring. I added onion powder & Mrs. Dash table blend because I didn't want to add any more salt. The extra spices really helped. Served over noodles but will try rice next time.

I tried the recipe as written and the pork chops actually fell apart when I tried to put them in a pan from the slow cooker.  So I took the pieces of it and put it on some noodles and poured the sour cream mixture over the top.  It was good, but nothing to rave about.  I don't think we'll make it again unless I add some stronger flavors to the "gravy".  I felt like I was missing the mushrooms in a cream of mushroom soup.

VERY yummy!  I happily pleased with how moist and delicious the pork chops turned out!  Definitely going to be making these again!  My only complaint is the sauce.  I wasn't too crazy with how the sour cream sauce stuff turned out.  Kind of an off flavor.  But still, not bad.  yum, yum, yum!

These pork chops are very moist.  I thought the sauce was a little bland, but my husband really liked it.  I have to admit that I usually look for easier dishes to use with the slow cooker (everything in one pot, no browning beforehand or making sides).  But, this is a far superior way to make tender pork chops than any other way I've tried.

These were phenominal!  I followed the recipe exactly exept for small tweeks - I added a generous amt of salt, pepper, garlic powder and sazon to the flour before browning.  To cut down fat, I used fat free sour cream and Pam in place of oil, and it came out perfect.  Very easy and delicious.

These pork chops were delicious and so tender! I've never had pork chops that were this tender before. Also, the recipe was very easy - I followed exactly what the recipe called for, and they turned out perfectly!

Seriously the best port chops I have ever had! These turned out unbelievably tender and really tasty!  I used the bullion cubes and also beef broth instead of the water.  Otherwise followed the recipe as is. My family (including my picky 7-year old) loved them!!

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect!  I know I will be making this over and over.  The pork chops could be eaten with a fork.

Was a little too tangy for my liking, but I did only make two chops. Might attempt again when I have a bigger family to cook for.

This is a definite repeat!  I used Aldi's pork chops and since I ran out of time, I just cooked on top of stove.

We really really enjoyed these.  I cooked in my crockpot on low for about 4 1/2 hours and they were perfect...mine didn't fall apart when I moved them from the crockpot.  The sauce is wonderful - I used light sour cream.  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

I'm giving this 4 stars because even though these are the best pork chops I've ever made, I really think they are better without the sour cream sauce.

I made these exactly as directed and liked them, My husband thought the sauce was too rich, though, and my son just did not care for them. I was hoping they would like them because I did. But I don't suppose I will be able to ake them again.

5 stars coming from a family who do not particularly like pork chops.  Finally a recipe where they don't come out dry AND have flavor. Followed ingrediant list and WAS going to put in slow cooker but a last minute realized my chops were very thin which meant the time would have been cut in half and I wouldn't be home to shut slow cooker or they would have definitely been dried out. So I put them in a ziploc after I seasoned and dredged in flour (added x garlic).  I used the skillet and followed all ingrediant list.  I added the sour cream the last 20-25 minutes.  They simmereed about an hour total.  Served w/rice and a salad.  They EASILY cut with a fork just so moist and flavorful.  Thank you for sharing.

My husband and I aren't big pork fans, but this turns out so tender and delicious, we hardly had any left over! No modifications, delicious as is! I made with mashed potatoes, but it would be better with rice I think.

Yummy!!!  These were very good, I followed some others advice and added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and lots and lots of seasonings garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt, and my very favorite Ms. Dash garlic and herb!!  I give them a five star because not everyone likes a lot of seasoning I just like very seasoned food.  This recipe is perfect just season as desired!!! I will definately make again!!

I changed the serving size to 2. My pork chops were thick and I used a large crock pot. The pork came out dry but still good because of the sauce. I will use my smaller crock pot next time and maybe add  a little bit more broth. I loved how simple it was!

I love this partly because it is so quick and easy, but especially for the great taste.  Everyone loved it.  The chops were not fall apart tender as I expected, but more like tender steaks.  This was fine with me.  The sauce never thickened up but was delicious nonetheless.  Will definately do this again and again.

These chops came out really dry for me, I wish I would have checked them sooner.  They must have over cooked.  We did like the sauce though.  It wasn't super thick but it was flavorful.

This is a great recipe.  I made 4 chops (1 in thickness) and reduced the rest of the ingredients to just 3 servings.  Cooked on low for 7.5 hrs and the meat came out tender.  Served over rice with the sauce and with a side of mixed steam vegetables.  Will be adding it to my list of monthly meals to make!

These are the best pork chops I have ever had! I didn't believe that they would really be tender enough to fall apart but they were. I used light sour cream but otherwise followed as written. I will definitely be making these often. My husband loved them too. Great flavor, easy to make.

To be last post re: how long to cook: The recipe is a SLOW COOKER recipe. You cook for 6 to 7 hrs. in the SLOW COOKER, then you heat the oven to 200 degrees to KEEP THE CHOPS WARM while you are making the sauce.

This recipe is sooooooo good.  They were very juicy and tender.  The sauce is amazing.  The only thing I did different was to prepare them on a simmer on the stove top for 45 min.  Perfect!

This recipe was a family hit!  My 2 boys thoroughly enjoyed it and had several helpings.  I used country style boneless pork ribs and made the sauce on the stovetop and it thickened up nicely.  Served it with cauliflower and egg noodles.  It was on the bland side but perfect for kids.  Delicious!

I cooked it for 2 1/2 hours on low and it was slightly OVER cooked.  So 7-8 hours it would have been very dry.  The flavor was GREAT though.

Simply delicious...but be prepared...the sauce needs thickening if you want a gravy like consistency. Overall, its a great dish with very little effort!

I forgot the dredging in flour step and these still turned out great. The pork was moist and tasty and next time I may add more sour cream and less drippings. We perfer a thicker gravy than this produced. Overall a great fix it and forget it kind of meal.

Wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews.  I made the recipe as is and it was really pretty bland.  The pork chops were very tender, but the sauce was way too runny and really had very little flavor. I will try again, but will definitely incorporate some of the other reviewers changes in.  Thank you!

WOW!  You wouldn't think such simple ingredients would make such a divine dish!  The sauce transforms this from a regular pork chop dish into a dinner party dish!  Thanks for a great recipe!  We will definitely make this again!

Unbelievable recipe. First time followed recipe to a 'T' now we add lots more onion slices - cause we LOVE onion! So flavorful, so very tender. A great company meal, yet easy enough for a week night dinner.

absolutly fabulous! I seasoned chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then I dreged them through highly seasoned flour. I browned them in garlic infused oil, then browned the onions and put in crock pot.  I added cream of mushroom to the broth.  Last, I added sauteed fresh mushrooms and about 4 oz. sour cream after moving chops to oven. It was very very good.

Is this good or what.  I followed the directions, but used loin chops 1" thick for five hours and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce,instead of flour.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was super yummy! The only thing i changed was using 2 cups of stock instead of the water and bouillon. Took only 6 hrs in the slow cooker to become tender. Will definately make again.

I've made many recipes from this site and this is the first time I'm giving a recipe two stars.  This was nothing special at all and my sauce came out very funny and curdled with the sour cream.  I should have added other ingredients but then I wouldn't have been following the recipe and thought it deserved to be simple and easy as indicated.

Thought these were great even though I didn't follow the prep. Didn't have time for the crock pot; browned 4 chops and put in baking dish. Baked, covered for 2 hours at 300 with the onion, 1 cup water and 1 bouillon cube. Stacked them up on one side of the pan and added the sour cream and flour (which I didn't measure). Baked an additional 20 minutes.

These were great!  I was cooking for 6 people and by doing the pork in the slow cooker, I had plenty of time to work on mashed potatoes and slow cooked green beans.  The only thing I did differently is that I used gluten free flower on the pork and corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I used chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes and I strained the broth before adding the sour cream.  When I tasted the sauce, I wasn't sure about it, however, it complimented the pork and mashed potatoes very well.  The entire group loved the pork!  So tender.  I will definitely make this again.

This is delish and it does fall apart.  I used pork chops with bones and the bones just fell out when I transferred the pork to a pan to put in the oven.  The only thing I did different was that I added a bunch of baby carrots.  I wanted a veggie in there.  It was very good!

Awesome! I followed the directions exactly, except for when I removed the chops from the crock pot and mix in the sour cream, I accidentally put the pork chops back in the crock pot! It didn't matter, it turned out great! Saved me a step in putting it in the oven. I have 3 sons, ages 6-15 and they all loved it! Even my very picky husband who hates sour cream,.... but LOVED this. They want this weekly. Thanks for a great recipe!

I seasoned the Pork chops then fried them in extra light olive oil then sautéed onions in the oil. Then I put garlic mushroom soup in the crock pot and place the pork chops on top. Then I layered it with the onions and cooked it on low for 4 hours. After it was cooked I took out the pork chops and then mixed in the sour cream to make a great gravy. Delicious!!

i followed the recipe to a "T" and it was amazing. the only thing i did differently was that i used thin pork chops. this was so good i was disappointed there wasn't more! i will definitely make this again and will be using regular pork chops so that there's more next time!

This recipe was great.. the sour cream sauce was so delicious and goes well over egg noodles.. I didn't have time to do in crock pot so I took some of the advice others did on the stove. Seems like it would be really good in the crock pot (tenderness) but on the stove worked really well..

I loved the pork chops and the broth, but will probably just thicken with flour & make a cream gravy next time.  Though we love sour cream, it just didn't "work" for us in this-- maybe because I used light sour cream... Anyway, I will definitely make this again, just adapt the gravy to better uit my family.  Thanks!

I made this recipe and absolutely loved it, as did my guests.  Like many of the reviewers, I made two substitutions/changes:  First, I used chicken stock instead of the boullion cubes.  Secondly, I threw in an extra half a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, to add some extra creaminess and of course mushrooms.  The one negative I experienced (I am new to cooking so please let me know if you have any recommendations here) is that when carefully removing the pork chops, they were so tender that they did fall off the bone.  Therefore, the sauce had small pieces of bone in it.  Only about 2 or 3 times did I bite into it, but it was a drawback from enjoying the meal.  It tasted AMAZING though and look forward to making it again!

The pork chops were very tender and just fell off the bone.  I did add some extra seasoning in the flour and also into the sour cream mixture.

This is great!  I followed other peoples suggestions and not only added more spices (such as Pork Rub) to the pork chops, but also seasoned my flour as well with op, s&P and the pork rub.  I didn't have garlic powder so I had to use onion powder.  I also carmelized the onions to put on top of the chops.  Used chicken broth, mushroom soup and added a couple tbls of flour and let it simmer with some s&P and op.  Last minute added some sauted mushrooms sauted with chopped garlic.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Very good comfort food for a Sunday Supper.

I did get great reviews on this.  I did take some other's advise and seasoned the flour and also seasoned the pork chops prior to coating in flour mixture.  I simmered some mushrooms when the sauce was cooking & it was a great topper.  The only problem I had was that when I put the chops in the oven they dried out.  Since not everyone likes to have the added calories with the sour cream sauce I just left it on the side.

Very good! I had just bought some chops that was on sale and wanted something new to do with them.  Viola!  I did add a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce and some fresh sliced mushrooms as I love them in good sour cream sauces (this one is good).  The sauce is nice and velvety.  Next time I think I will try a spoonful of good ole "smokey" paprika.  Just for a twist.  I think the sauce could handle just about anything...including a 'rosemary' encounter.

I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and it gives this recipe a distinctive flavor.  This also slightly cuts down on the calorie intake.  Delicious!

Very easy and rather tasty, though my sauce didn't thicken that well even after simmering and some added cornstarch. And I would've liked it to have a bit more flavor even after all the salt & pepper I added!

This recipe was very good and very easy to make. Pork was tender and delicious. Read other reviews and added cream of mushroom soup. Still wasn't enough flavor. So I added some italian seasonings and garlic powder and that gave it the flavor it was otherwise missing. Definitely serve with egg noodles!

The night I made these, I received complaints. Too dry. My pork chops were butterflied so being thinner, didnt take as long to cook so they were dry. My sauce didnt thicken either. I served the leftovers a few nights later and everyone liked them. Maybe since they soaked in the sauce and werent so dry.  I'll try them again. I would warn to not over cook. SO easy to do with pork anyway. I dont know what to suggest about thickening the sauce though.

My family loved this recipe.  We served it over noodles with parsley potatoes and corn.  It was extremely filling and tasted wonderful.  The only thing I want to experiment with is making the gravy a little thicker!  Definitely worth a try though!

I followed the recipe closely except for adding a can of cream of chicken soup, and an extra cup of water. When finished, the liquid was not quite thick enough, so added about 2 tbsp of corn starch. I ended up with tasty, moist chops and one of the most delicious gravies I have ever tasted!! The spices and the sour cream are what made it. Served the chops and gravy with mashed potatoes.  Excellent supper!!

We will definitely have these again, but I did generously season our chops with Traeger's Pork & Poultry Shake before I dipped them in the flour.  I don't think I would have liked them without it...I'm not much for that distinct sour cream taste, so the seasoning is what made it for me.  The meat was so tender, though.  I'm very glad I came across this recipe.  It's a keeper for our family!

I ended up baking the chops in a casserole dish for 30 minutes as 1 of the other reviewers did and didn't put the onions in (I am not a fan of them) and it came out great. my fiance loved them and our roommate who hates sour cream loved it and said he couldn't even taste the sour cream in it. this is a keeper, we will def. be making this again.

This is the best recipe for pork chops that I found so far.  I made this easier by not coating or frying the chops and just adding the sour cream and flour at the end.  Delish!

Really good, my whole house started smelling really yummy, I also added a bit of flavor... dry Italian seasoning mix helped out a lot, and I would recommend more sliced onions. I browned mine first with the pork chops. Serve with mashed potatoes...delicious!

These were very good, I sprinkeled garlic powder on them and seasoned salt, then seared them for about 3 or 4 min. on both sides. No time for the crock pot, so I used my eletric skillet. Simmered them for 45 min. They were jucy and fell apart. Thanks for the recipe!

Without the sauce this would be a very, very bland pork.  With the sauce, however, it is quite tasty.  The meat cooked up very tender which was great and ours definitely was not dry in the least although we used thin loin chops.

Very tasty yet the chops were a little on the dry side. Will probably cut down on the cooking time next time. Will make again often.

I made this when we had a friend over for dinner and I had read the comments beforehand, so I used extra spices and seasonings and I added Cream of Mushroom soup to the pot.  I also used extra sour cream.  It still came out relatively bland.  Wasn't bad, just not as great as I had hoped.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was very good.  I used very thick boneless pork chops and the cooking time was a little too long for my crock pot.  My chops were a little dry.  Thank goodness for the sauce which was excellent.  To my surprise, the kids ate up the onions and wanted more!  We will be making this again!

Had this for dinner this evening. Used Garlic cloves instead of powdered added some mixed herbs. Pork chops were so tender they fell apart. I cooked them for 1 hour on high and four on low served with cheesy mashed potatoes peas and corn. Will definitely do this again

This was da bomb!! Only thing I'll do different next time is to use boneless or thick-cut chops w/one bone. I used chops that had multiple bones...these chops WILL be fall-apart tender, so all of the little bones was kind of a hassle. But believe me...the taste is worth it!!

these were sooo good. we served this over white rice which mixed well with the sauce.  the sauce tastes like a really yummy pork chop gravy.  i may add red peppers or something else to give it a bit of color next time and definitely some sliced mushrooms.  thanks!

Even though I made a few changes, this recipe was delicious and wonderful on a cold night.  I used chicken but followed the recipe as written.  Served with mashed potatoes to which I added onion and California style vegetable mix.  The sauce made a wonder addition to the mashed potatoes and also dipped my veggies in it.  A most enjoyable dinner.

Great slow cooker recipe! All I did to change it was add more seasoning to the slow cooker. More garlic, pepper and season  salt. It turned out perfect!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did use a jar of alfredo sauce instead of the beef bouillon and added fresh button mushrooms, but followed the rest of the recipe.  It was great and I will definitely make it again.  P.S.  My husband told me to be sure to write a great review for this recipe!  That's a compliment!

Yum, yum, yum!  These were loved by the whole family, the one year old on up.  I started them at 2 in the afternoon, cooked them on high, and dinner was done by 5:30.  I used College Inn White wine and Herb Culinary broth for the liquid and went a little heavy on the seasonings and it was super!  Very tender and moist.  We served it over egg noodles and there are no leftovers.  Highly recommend as one of our new favorite recipes.

I am not a pork person and I LOVED this dish.  I did change some things; I added parsley and paprika to the pork seasoning and a packet of onion dip mix to the broth.  I also added a bit more sour cream and flour in the end to help thicken it.

I am always trying to find new ways to liven up pork chops.  This recipe was good, but I felt like it was missing something.  I added a few chopped mushrooms and some cayenne pepper which I am very glad I did, b/c I can't imagine it without them.  Next time I plan to add A LOT more mushrooms for sure and maybe experiment with some different spices.  For two 1.5 inch pork chops I halved everything and cooked on high for the 1st hour and low for the last 3 hours.  Served over egg noodles.

I followed hisdrinkoffering's review as my guide to making this and it came out delicious.  I served over white rice and the flavor combination of the rice, pork chops, and sauce was amazing!!! Got great reviews from my boyfriend and his friends.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

These were great!  Like some others, I did add a can of Cream of Mushroom soup to the sour cream.  I also sprinkled a tiny bit of crushed red pepper to the pork chops.  Thanks for sharing.

SOOOO tender and flavorful. My mother was here for dinner and raved about it. She asked for the recipe and couldn't believe it was a slow cooker recipe. I wish there was a bit more sauce but still 5 stars.

Absolute comfort food.  Didn't have time to slow cook, so I pulled out my electric frying pan and made them in there.  Served over egg noodles.  Delicious!

These were so dang good! I only used about 1/2 cup of onions, which I sauted in butter before adding to the crock pot. The pork was tender, but not fall apart tender like I expected which was ok by me. I couldn't get the sauce to thicken, but it tasted so good over egg noodles that it didn't matter. I'm definitely making this again. Even my husband, who doesn't like sour cream, loved this. And my picky boys did too!

This was ok.  To quote my husband "I am sure it's someone's favorite meal.  Just not mine."  We did it the entire thing and I would make it again.  

I used half chicken stock and half cream of mushroom soup and added mushrooms and garlic to the recipe and served it over brown rice.

Delicious!! The chops were very tender!  I made the recipe for 2 instead of 6 and ended up putting the slow cooker on high for 4 hours (instead of slow for 7-8) and it turned out just as good!

It was pretty good. The pork turned out tender but the sour cream taste was really strong and I like sour cream. I think there was just too much of it. Next time I might cut the sour cream in half and make up the difference with mushroom soup.

One it's own I think this recipe is 3 or maybe 4 stars. With some changes I think it can be 5. Most importantly I think the cook time should be adjusted. I had my chops on low for just under 7 hours, and while the meat did fall apart easily it was a little dry. Secondly is the sauce seasoning. I added about a half packet of onion soup mix and 3 chopped cloves of garlic. At the end when I added the sour cream & flour and turned it up to high it just didn't get hot enough for the sour cream to melt & the sauce to thicken, so I put it in a saucepot on the stove which made a beautiful sauce..and it was very yummy. I will make this again but will reduce the cook time to 4-5 hours on low, and will definitely add the onion soup mix.

I added red pepper flakes, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the flour before dredging the meat (I had pork medallions instead of chops, so I used those).  It was AMAZING!  This will be going in my permanent recipe box.

This recipe was easy and good. I followed it exactly - except the only chops I had on hand were thinly cut. The cooking time was a little too long and they were a bit dry - but the yummy sauce made up for it. They were extremely tender, and it tasted great served with rice.

We tried this recipe last night and it was surprisingly good.  However we omitted the sourcream.  I enjoyed the gravy and it went well with my rice.  I'd say it's more of a 4.5 star recipe.

I really wanted to love these but they were just okay.  I seasoned them well based on others advice.  Still a little bland.  The chops were not as tender as other described.  I used centercut boneless chops.  Maybe another cut of chop would be better.  With so many good reviews, I might try it again.

I took into account what other posters suggested about the flavor so I added a few more seasonings and such.  Oh my gosh-the most moist, flavorful pork chops I have EVER made!  And typically my husband NEEDS a gravy or sauce of some sort and I usually hate gravy/sauce.  This time I LOVED the sauce and my husband refused to put any on because, in his words, "they're so moist and flavorful, they don't need the sauce."  Putting this in my favorite recipes box.  Will make again!

I loved this recipe. Not really a pork fan so was looking for something different. Instead of following the recipe I did my own touches too.  Instead of just plain broth I also added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup. After taking the chops out of the pan I put the onions in to saute them with the soup. I added salt and pepper and the bouillon and water. I poured it over the chops put it on high for 5 hours. Served it over egg noodles. Husband loved it.

The pork chops were amazing, the sauce was a little off.  I tried adding spices but I think that I'm not a sour cream + pork person.

This was absolutely yummy!!
I left the onions out because I'm not crazy about them, and it was STILL flavorful and delicious.

For the chicken boulon I used the jar stuff instead of the cubes.  

This is going to be put in my permanent rotation of dinners !!!!

These came out tender and tasty. My husband doesn't like his food "excessively spiced," as he calls it, so these were perfect for him. In addition to the salt and pepper, I also sprinkled the chops with some Emeril's Original Essence before dredging and browning to give it a little more punch. I will definitely make this one again!

Great flavor, whole family loved it. Made as directed, but only cooked for about half the time. Sauce did not thicken what so ever, but tasted good.

I gave this 4 stars because it is a "good bones" recipe...it needs more seasoning based on ones personal preferences but it supplies a good starting point.  
As other reviewers have noted, the sauce is a bit bland as written, but it is easily tweaked to suit your tastes.

I personally seasoned my chops with salt, pepper, and garlic when browning. I also added a wad of fresh tarragon to the sauce when I stirred in the sour cream.

Any fresh herb will make this a very tasteful dish as well as 'pretty'.

The sauce needed to be a bit thicker for my taste, so I added more flour to the sour cream.

Had to give it five stars because I actually don't know if the original deserves less or not.  I made it using the changes that "hisdrinkoffering" posted on Feb. 9, 2006.  She used cajun seasoning on the chops and cream of mushroom in the slow cooker.  My husband doesn't like sour cream so I left it out.  It was wonderful!  This will be a regular at our house now.

After reading all the reviews I decided to play it straight with this one. I followed the recipe to a T except I added some additional spices to the flour mixture before browning. Nothing spectacular just garlic powder, paprika, cajun seasoning. I didn't have all day to let it sit either, so I stuck the crock pot on high for about 5 hours. The gravy is a total must, it really makes the dish. This is definitely in my dinner rotation. Super easy and tasty. The toddler even ate it!

I've been using this recipe for about a year and a half now and everyone loves it!  People who don't like pork chops love this recipe!  you can also do this in the oven, if you forget to do crock pot in the AM, or decide last minute that you want pork chops for dinner.  They don't fall apart like from the crock pot, but are still very good!

I have kept your recipe for quite awhile. I've only given it 3 stars today.  When I used to make it, I must have goofed up on something.  I will be glad to make it again.

Great for the whole family and a nice company dinner too that is easy!  I also added a can of mushrooms while cooking. My 3 1/2 and 1 1/2 year old along with hubby had seconds!  I had it with garlic mashed potatoes with the sauce as a gravy!  Like others I popped out the pork for a few minutes while I added the sour cream and corn starch, then threw it all back together.  Sooooo much better than breaded pork chops (I used boneless too) dry from the oven.

Oh, so good.  I did modify the recipe by adding 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup to the water/bouillion.  I served this over bow tie pasta.  The sauce was excellent!  My 2 and 5 yr old loved this.

Awesome Simple Recipe.  I didn't transfer the porkchops into a baking dish...I cooked everything together directly in the crockpot and added the sour cream to the pot when the chops were done cooking.  So tender!

I made this easy recipe just like it is and my whole family loved it!  The pork just fell apart and was delicious.  We did thicken the sauce in the microwave when it didn't thicken in the crockpot.  VERY GOOD!

Very tender pork.  Used boneless chops, added a can of cream of mushroom soup, added additional spices (garlic powder, red pepper, poultry seasoning) and thickened sauce on stove with cornstarch instead of flour. Will make again.

This recipe did not go over well in our house.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and found that the pork chops were extremely dry; they had to be saturated in the sauce to eliminate the cardboard effect.  We also found the sauce to have a distinct flour taste to it.  Overall, easy to make, but not that tasty.

I added a dash of Creole seasoning to the chops, substituted low-sodium chicken stock for the boullian, and served the sauce with egg noodles as a side dish. Delicious!

Awesome - I think maybe next time I will add a little more for gravy, and by the way I used a pork tenderloin instead (because it is what I had on hand), everyone loved it.

The chops came out really soft and flavorful.  I added mushrooms and a can of cream of chicken also (didn't have mushroom).  Turned out like a stroganoff that way but still yummy !!  Made alot of sauce.

Make this!!!  I have never tasted pork chops so tender and delicous.  It was amazing how they fell off the bone...I was almost worried that my boyfriend and I were going to swollow a piece of bone while gobbling down our dinner.  I'm not sure if I'm just having beginners luck with the crock pot...but I can't wait to see what other kinds of meat this thing can transform.

Excellent. They were very juicy and tender. I used a half of can of cream of mushroom soup and  a half of can of cream of chicken soup for the pork chops to cook in. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you!

Can't believe some people lower the rating for a recipe because they didn't have the ingredients called for!! I did my pork on top of stove, sliced into strips and dredged in flour and corn starch, and browned the onions along with the strips.  Added chicken broth and simmered covered  a half hour.  Added sour cream at last minute. Only ingredient change was I added dill weed. So quick to prepare and excellent taste.

Absolutely delicious...will cut out the sour cream sauce for a little less fat.  Super tender.  Great with our favorite bar-b-q sauce as well.

These were very good and as the recipe stated, the chops fell apart.  The sauce was good to, as someone before me, I too paired these with egg noodles.  Added a salad and dinner was done.  I love these all day meals, no matter what comes up, your supper is done!

Even though I don't usually try recipes that call for dredging & browning the meat first (I never seem to get it crispy enough), I tried this one and was glad I did.  Served it with egg noodles & it was wonderful.

This is a very good recipe. I did use chicken broth instead of bouillon (didn't have any) but otherwise followed  the instructions. Everyone (including the kids) said "yum." Will make again. Thank you for the recipe!!

I thought this was a really good recipe and my family liked it too.  I used a package of Knorr Leek soup mix, 1.5 cups of milk and 1.5 cups of water instead of the chicken boullion and 2 c water and I think it was a good alternative.

Excellent recipe!  My husband isn't an onion fan, and he still loved this one.  I did 1/2 the ammount of onion called for, though.  We love pork chops done in the crock pot, they are so tender- this is a great new way to fix them.

Perhaps one of the best pork chop slow cooker recipes I have tried.  Served with potatoes on the side for my starch.  The cream created in the pot is fantastic.

These were very nice and tender. I used pork tenderloin instead of pork chops. I also added some cream of mushroom soup to the sour cream mixture which added to the flavor and also added about 1/8 tsp. garlic salt (2 servings). Thanks Ami for sharing!

This was really good!  I did add extra salt, pepper and garlic powder to the flour and I did add minced garlic to the crock pot. I also caramelized the onions before I put them in the crock pot.  Other than that, it is perfect!

Tasty recipe that's ready to go when you get home from work!  I added mushrooms to the gravy -- the gravy was fantastic.  The meat was extremely tender.  I usually steer clear of pork chops because they always seem so dry; this was a refreshing and delicious change.  My 2 and 4 year olds cleaned their plates.

We didn't care for this one very much. I thought it was dry and not very flavorful. With the tweaks that the other reviewers mention I think you can get this up to a 4 star. Thanks for the post.

These were okay...the gravy it made was very good, but it made a TON. I didn't really care for the flavor of the chops. Just personal preference, though, because my husband LOVED them.

I am not a big fan of pork chops but I thought I would give it a try.  Boy, am I glad I did!!!! It is by far the best recipe for pork chops ever.  I usually read most of the reviews before making a dish but I didn't have time to on this one.  I wish I would have though.  Everything turned out great except for the gravy.  It was too runny!!  Now I know what to do next time-Cream of mushroom soup.  We served it over noodles and it was delicious.  I will keep making this over and over again.

This recipe was good.   I don't know if it called for pork chops with the bone in or not.  I used 6 chops (medium thickness) without a bone.  I cooked them for 6 hour on low in the slow cooker.   I don't know what I did wrong but they were a bit dry.  My kids ate them so I will more than likely make these again.

The pork was very tender after being in the crock pot for 6 hours. I liked the way the onions melted and became part of the sauce. The sauce was the only down side. Absolutely needs to be thickened on the stove, very runny otherwise. Good but not a Wow dish.

Very good.  I doubled the sauce so I could use the gravy on mashed potatoes.  at the end I added some cornstarch with water to thicken it up.  My whole family (5) loved this dish, the chops were so tender and the gravy was really very good but i think next time I will have to add something to it to give it the kick I think it's missing.  Not sure what that is yet but there is something.  I sauteed mushrooms which went very well with the pork, would even be great to add them in while cooking.

I made this exactly as stated, only reducing the amounts, since I only made three pork chops.  Used 1 inch chops, and they turned out very tender.  But the flavor just wasn't there - I'm not sure what would have made it better.  But I loved the idea of pork chops in the crock pot.  Thanks for sharing, Ami.

This recipe was excellent. My husband and I loved this. The only thing that I did different is that I added about 1 and 1/2 cubes of chicken bouillon, and alittle bit more water. We love gravy so we poured it over pototoes. The sour cream was a great ending. This is a make again. Thanks for the recipe.. :)

Used thick cut boneless chops....Wow so tender!!! The sauce is just that a sauce not a "gravy".  If you want to thicken it definitely do so on the stovetop.  I will skip the sour cream sauce next time was too much work for not a lot of added taste.

I'm not much of a fan of Stroginoff type of dishes.  The pork was excellent but the sauce was just not to my taste.  My parents however really enjoyed it.  
Basically too much work for a pretty boring dish.

I didn't much care for the taste of this but the rest of the family wolfed it down and said I could make it again so I guess its a keeper.

I have a slow cooker that tends to cook fast or I bought chops that were too thin. I only needed 5-6 hours for cooking on low. They were so tender at that point. Then I just put it on warm for the remaining time, and the chops dried out - my own fault for not just turning the cooker off and warming in the stove before dinner.

This was an incredibly tasty and easy way to do pork chops. It took 10 minutes in the morning to prepare and all I had to do was serve it up when I got home. My dinner party was a huge success!

Made as directed (but used just 2 chops).  Chops did get tender, but sauce wasn't very thick and didn't have enough flavor.  Almost tasted like a thin stroganoff sauce, but without the flavor.  Served over buttered noodles.  Probably wouldn't make again.

This was pretty good but I would definitly suggest watching the salt you use to coat these chops with. The garlic and pepper I used were perfect but the salt was a bit overpowering. Tender they were...to the point I wasn't even sure they were cooked! The kids did not like the sauce but both my husband and I liked it. Next time I think I might add some carrots and potatoes to cook with the chops...a full meal that way with no extra muss.

Yummy (& easy)!  I scaled the recipe for 3 servings, but I had to use the original amounts of the liquids for the gravy.  Still, my family loved it.  A definte keeper!

The porkchops were really tender, and fell off the bones.  The sourcream didn't really work well, I would have used some of the other suggestions like cream of mushroom or celery soup to thicken the gravy.

These chops were pretty good but I agree with others that the sour cream gravy is really lacking something.  I added a can of cream of celery soup, then some paprika and pepper, but that still didn't seem to do the trick.  It also never thickened up.  I would probably make the chops again in the slow cooker, and just skip the gravy part altogether.  They tasted pretty good on their own.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but these chops came out fairly dry.  I expected them to be fall-off-the-bone tender.  Also, the sauce was quite thin.  Maybe I needed to add a thickening agent...
