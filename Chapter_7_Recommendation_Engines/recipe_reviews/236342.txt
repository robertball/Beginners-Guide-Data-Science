There are times when simple is best, and that's the case with this recipe. My hubby (who's a dedicated carnivore) didn't even complain that there was no meat in this.  We both thoroughly enjoyed this for lunch today.  To give this a little punch of flavor, I sauteed the garlic in extra virgin oil with chili, keeping the red pepper flakes as well, and mixed in the chopped parsley at the end to retain its bright green color.  We actually prefer the bold taste of pecorino romano over parmigiano reggiano, so that was a sub I made.  Photo doesn't show this, but it was served with shaved romano on the top.

This is a great lunch or dinner on a day you're running late.  I served it with a green salad and homemade Italian bread.  I wasn't sure how the 4 yr old would like the red pepper but he didn't seem to notice it.  I have been making this for years but this was the first time I added the red pepper and I must say it bumps this up from pretty good to yummy?  Thanks!

This great side dish is made from pantry staples, and it is a nice change from potatoes.  It certainly livened up our leftover chicken, and it was a snap to put together.  I used half a box of spaghetti, but kept everything else the same, adding only a tablespoon of clarified butter after I threw it all together.

This recipe is pretty much the way my Italian MIL taught me to make it. I used fresh parsley and a bit of basil from my garden and my garlic I preferred minced. Quick and simple and so delicious!?#?AllstarsBarilla?

DELICIOUS! Growing up in an Italian household (and not a lot of money), this was something that we enjoyed often. I minced my garlic, but that was my only change. Simple to make and with ingredients that most of us always have on hand. This will continue to be a staple for my family~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a perfect simple dish! This makes for a great side dish for grilled chicken or pair with a nice salad for a complete meal.  A classic that will always be in my dinner rotation!

This recipe made a huge amount.   Thought the flavor was ok.  Needed a little something more.  Added a bit more cheese after it cooled more.  That seemed to help.

Thank you Barilla for this amazing pasta recipe!  I minced the garlic but other than that I followed this recipe to the T...it was outstanding!  I served it with a side of grilled wasabi and toasted sesame seed shrimp!

This was a fast, easy, and delicious recipe! I love how filling it is because of the Barilla Plus pasta. I'd scale this recipe down for a fast lunch for myself or double it to feed a crowd. You really can't go wrong with this dish as long as you like a little bit of heat.

I made this just as directed and thought it was wonderful. After tasting I did add just an extra sprinkle of red pepper flakes to my plate for a bit more of a kick, but that's just personal preference. Served with a side of garlic bread and a green salad, this is a fast, easy to prepare meal that's light but filling.

This is a great recipe for use as a light main dish or a side dish. We made no changes, it's perfect as-is and will certainly make it again!

While it was easy and simple to put together, my family just did not care for it. They do not like the Barilla Plus pasta and thought it would be better with just regular Barilla pasta. My husband wanted more garlic and my daughter thought the noodles were just bland. If I did this again, I would definately add more garlic, more cheese and perhaps some cooked proscuitto.

Tasty pasta dish. Makes a great lunch. I did mince my garlic. Also was out of parsley so I left it out.

I was skeptical about this dish, as we don't normally eat pasta without tomato sauce so I was hoping it wouldn't be too bland, but this exceeded my expectations.  The flavors of the olive oil, garlic, and red pepper blended well together, and the cheese added a light creaminess to the pasta.  In fact, I ate way too much in one sitting!  I didn't change a thing.  This was served as a side to Easy Lemon and Herb Blackened Chicken from this site, since we don't normally eat dinner without a protein.  It only takes 10-15 minutes including prep time, so this was perfect for our weeknight dinner.  Thanks, Barilla!

A great fast and easy dish.  I made the recipe with all the same ingredients but did not saute the parsley, I just stirred the chopped parsley in at the end.  Very easy to customize to your taste.   Delicious and simple too!

Yum, really good comfort food in just 20 minutes with so few,  but well-chosen ingredients.  I am trying to eat healthier so used whole grain thin spaghetti.  Added a bit of salt and pepper to the olive oil mixture and used  ground cayenne since I didn't have red pepper flakes.  Came out great, with just the right mix of flavors. Served with microwavable bag of green beans so it turned out to be a perfect weeknight meal and totally satisfying.  Loved the touch of heat from the red pepper.

Dopeeeee!!! Even though I used parmesan instead of that cheese.. and tripled the amount because cheese, it was still really good. It was really good with red bell pepper! I will try with mushrooms and spinach next time. 10/10+

I'm afraid I'm in the "this was too blah" camp. I think the garlic, red pepper flakes, and cheese all need to be doubled...or maybe even tripled. It is very quick to make though, which is a very good thing.

Honestly, I felt this was fairly blah as written.  I doubled the parmesan, upped the red pepper, added ground black pepper, a little salt, a little onion powder, and a whole diced tomato at the end- perfection with changes!  The best part is that this is the PERFECT accompaniment to pretty much any protein out there.  This would be great with chicken, fish, beef, etc.  Easy and tasty with changes.

Garlicky and delicious. I added a bit more red pepper flakes as I like it a bit spicy. I made this for lunch and served it with a green salad and it was perfect.

A delicious quick dish when you need to get dinner on the table.  It was even faster for me as I used leftover thin spaghetti that was in the refrigerator.  This dish is easy to customize with the amount of garlic or red pepper flakes that you want.  I will be using this recipe again.  This served as the side with 'Fancy Franks' and 'Hot Dog Roll Up' both from AR.

I made this vegan by using unsweetened soy milk in the place of the pasta water and nutritional yeast in the place of the Parmesan.  It was delicious!

The first time I made it, I did it just as it says and it was good.

I like my noodles a little thicker so I usually use linguini or fettuccini.  The only difference is I recommend you remove them from the hot water a minute or so early and let them cook in the saut√© pan with the oil.

Over time I've started playing with the recipe.  The first thing I started doing was using fresh cracked black pepper instead of cheese.  Very good.

The next thing I tried and was GREAT was to toss some shrimp into the oil as it cooked.  There is also a seasoning at Sam's Club that is labeled 6 pepper spice.  It adds more depth of flavor than just red pepper flakes.

This was an easy and tasty dish. The only thing that I did different was to use lots more garlic (just because we like garlic a lot) and I only used half of the pasta called for. It was so yummy. Definitely will make again.

First time making this and I did change it a little bit.  First of all I used Rigatoni and I also used Italian sausage rather than the red pepper flakes.  Someone gave me some quality olive oil so I was looking for a dish to make.  This was pretty simple and pretty good flavor.  Will make it again.  

I browned the ground sausage while cooking the pasta, put the sausage into a strainer to drain the grease, then put into a small bowl.  I then put the oil, parsley and garlic in a sauce pan to brown the garlic a bit.  Then when the pasta was done I drained it and then put the pasta in the sauce pan with the oil, parsley and garlic. I added the 1/3 cup pasta water and mixed, then added the sausage and mixed it then served it up.  Good, quick easy meal paired with a nice salad and some garlic bread sticks.

It was bland.  It needs some salt and I would cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup instead of 1/3, that's just way too much.  I think the next time I'll add Italian Dressing and maybe a little vinegar.

I just made this recipe as a quick dinner meal. We love Garlic, so doubled to 6 cloves (or so). Then added 1 cup chopped mini bell peppers - yellow red and orange. , added in 1 teaspoon each of Oregano and Italian Seasoning. This all added to the olive oil, garlic and pepper flakes. Excellent !! Husband added some chopped bacon to his.

Had this tonight! It was delicious. My daughter really wanted to make pasta with fresh basil so we chose this recipe and added a 1/4 cup fresh basil along with some zucchini we sliced up. Yum! It would also be really good with shrimp or other veggies added.

It makes for a great side dish, but for a lot of people, as the recipe makes a huge volume. It's a little work-intensive for a side dish in terms of large pots/skillets getting used, but it tasted good. I also added more cheese after to it. If it is to be a main dish, I think a hearty sauce works better with this pasta.

An easy and fast pasta dish to prepare for dinner on a busy night. Simple ingredients that make the pasta very enjoyable. Even though I added salt to my cooking pasta water and the parmigiano cheese I had to add some salt to the dish. I mixed the cheese with pasta but I sprinkle some at the top as well.

Everyone in our family of picky eaters just loved this dish! We used it as a side dish and served it with pork chops and roasted broccoli. It was so full of flavor - a great replacement for the plain buttered noodles that my son loves and I get so bored with. It is going in my dinner repertoire for sure!

I'm always looking for tasty quick dinners and this fit the bill perfectly. As a matter of fact this would make a terrific side dish to any meal. This is yummy as is but toss in some grilled chicken and it would be an out of this world delish main dish. I followed the recipe as stated but did add lots more Parmesan (love it!) to suit my tastes.  I couldn't believe it - dinner was actually done in 20 minutes. From start to finish. And simple. It couldn't get more simple. Yummy.

This makes a really big batch (obviously since you use the whole box! :) ) I used minced jarred garlic and dried parsley and otherwise followed the instructions. I thought this was very good, and a perfect side dish for just about anything, and also would be so easy to toss in some veggies or a protein if you want a more complete all in one meal. My 10 month old LOVED these noodles and I will mix in some of her veggie puree into some chopped noodles for her for lunch tomorrow. Very simple, easy to make, comes together quickly and very tasty with just a hint of heat (and I'm a spice wimp - and this was perfect for me).

This recipe is so quick and easy, you might dismiss it as "plain" or "too simple." But this pasta dish is PACKED with big flavors. I used really good, imported Colavita brand EVOO and Barilla Plus! The fortified pasta tastes just like the regular kind. I was delighted with the results. Bravo, Barilla!

We enjoyed this. I would definitely suggest scaling down the recipe -- I cut it in half for the two of us, and there was still way too much pasta. I added a little extra crushed red pepper and sauteed a handful of precooked shrimp in the oil, then tossed it all together. I would definitely add the extra crushed red pepper -- I think it would be bland without it. Thanks!

Comfort food at its simplest and finest!  I followed the directions as written and we were very happy with the results!  When serving, I do recommend adding a little sprinkle more cheese.

I liked this a lot, and I say that even though I had difficulty getting the cheese to stick to the pasta.  The pasta itself is excellent!  I did mince the garlic, and because I didn't have parsley on hand I subbed fresh basil.  My dinner guests and I didn't leave any leftovers of this!  Thanks, Barilla!

Quick and Easy! I have made this dish many times with butter instead of olive oil and it remains a favorite. I did not saut√© my parsley. I threw it in with the cheese at the end. I also used gluten free spaghetti. To serve I like to add park and more red pepper and parsley.

Only because my store didn't have thin spaghetti today, I bought regular spaghetti for tis recipe.   It was so easy to make and it was absolutely delicious.  I served it with a beautiful Mediterranean salad and some bread.    It had just the right amount of garlic and red pepper.   I didn't alter a thing.  Oh, wait, since I was serving the salad which had fresh lemon juice in it's dressing, I gave the pasta a nice squeeze of half a lemon just to give it a bright flavor.   Outstanding!   Thanks Barilla :-)

This turned out great! I did double the red pepper flakes, other than that the only thing this is missing is a big fat piece of garlic bread.
