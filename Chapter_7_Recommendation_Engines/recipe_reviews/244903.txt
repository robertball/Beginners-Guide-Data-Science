I cooked for only 14 minutes and it was burnt to a crisp. I will try it again at a lower temp or less time.

We've made this quite a few times over the past couple months. Excellent recipe, The only change we made was eliminating the red pepper flakes. On occasion I forgot the lemon, but it is really good either way.  My wife and I particularly like to scoop the garlic out and eat that.

I baked at 400 degrees for only 15 minutes and every stem was completely fried to a crisp.  I'll give this recipe another go at a MUCH lower temperature, and I'll watch it like a hawk.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I loved the flavor and I don't even like vegetables.  However, WARNING:  475 degree oven is way too high and 20-25 minutes too long for that high a temperature. When I went to flip the broccolini after 10 minutes it was already on the verge of burning.  Next time I will try 425 degree oven for 15-20 minutes and continue to adjust until I can find the right temperature and time.  I think it is worth the effort. KEEP AN EYE ON IT!

Very nice!  I chopped garlic and sprinkled it on top with pepper flakes.  Then I wrapped everything in foil and put it on BBQ for about 20 mins.  Great tasting.
