Excellent & Delicious!!!This is similar to Avgolemono which is the most popular Greek soup.  I've been making this soup for my whole family over and over again and everyone loves this soup better than chicken noodle.  Even my husband and son love it too!  My husband is always asking the next day, do you have any of that soup left over?  I make it for my in-laws who are Greek and they love it better than the Greek original! They love the the addition of the chicken.  The only thing I do different is add 1 onion and 2 cloves of garlic chopped fine and 2 chicken boullions to a large pot of water, and I use 2 large lemons and 3 eggs.  This is our family's favorite soup!  You just don't know what you're missing until you have tried this soup!!!This recipe should be number one in the top 10. :)

I first rated this soup in December, 2000, and I am still making it today (January, 2011).  I have read all of the reviews and have come to the conclusion that if you want this to be a great soup, you need to start with homemade broth/stock.  Last night, I made the chicken stock for this soup with a Tyson Value pack of chicken, consisting of 3 thighs, 3 chicken backs and two chicken breasts, all with bone and skin.  I boned and skinned the chicken breasts and put the skin and bone in my stock pot, but set the breast meat aside for later use in another recipe.  Here is how I make my stock.  2 quarts of water, the chicken (skin and all) 2 celery stalks, each cut in 4 pieces, a large onion quartered, 5 whole black peppercorns, 3 whole cloves, 3 chicken bouillon cubes. For a clear stock bring almost but not quite to a boil and immediately turn heat down to low simmer .  Simmer for 1 hour.  Pour into a colander and let chicken cool.  In the meantime, put the strained broth in a pot with a lid and place it in the fridge.  I left mine overnight to cool.  Once cool, take the lid off and skim the lovely yellow chicken fat off the top.  Then proceed with the recipe as written.  All the flavor of the celery, onion, pepper and clove will be in the broth, and you won't have to add it.  Quite honestly, you can add any flavorings to the stock...carrots, bay leaf, however you want your soup to taste, but to be true to the recipe, don't add too much or you lose the character of the soup.

This was a very good and different soup.  I made a few alterations...I added chopped fresh spinich just before serving and almost doubled the broth as the lemon flavor was too overpowering, even for a lemon lover like me!  I also cooked the orzo on the side and added to each bowl at serving time.  I find that cooking and storing the pasta on the side eliminates it from soaking up the broth and becoming soggy.  Very good overall and freezes well.

This recipe was just okay.  I read many reviews before I made it, and I took many helpful suggestions from the reviews.  While I was boiling the chicken, I added fresh ginger to the water.  Once I removed the chicken, I added 3 stalks of celery, a handful of diced baby carrots, 4 cloves of pressed garlic,zest of one lemon, and 2 small onions.  At the suggestion of others, I added two more cups of water and only used one lemon.  I also added about a tablespoon of chicken bullion granules.  Once I added everything, it became a 5 star recipe.

Read through many of the reviews for suggestions on how to spice this up; it's a great basic recipe.  You'll need to add salt and/or stock to really get a chicken flavor, and be mindful not to add too many lemons; it can quickly become overwhelming (if you do, try some brown sugar to mellow it).  Consider onions, garlic, ground cloves, spinach, and if presentation is important, think through how to clear the broth (skimming or a cheesecloth to get rid of the fat).  Don't overcook the orzo either or it will turn to mush.  :)

I made this soup exactly as indicated (only I doubled it for a family dinner). It was a big hit and we will definitely have this again. It was not too salty so I assume that it really depends on the brand of chicken soup base you use to make it. DELICIOUS!

Very good!  I ended up making chicken stock the day before like one of the reviews provided instructions for (whole chicken, whole onion, 2 stalks celery, bay leaves, salt, all spice), left overnight in the fridge.  I also removed the meat from the chicken but needed to let it cool for a while first.  The next day, I skimmed the stock and strained through a cheese cloth.  Then I heated the stock, added the chicken and waited for it to boil, then added some elbow macaroni and the egg/lemon/stock mixture.  We've never had this before but will add into our rotation!

This was really good .. I used less chicken - 3 bone-in skinless breasts versus the 4 lbs called for. There was a ton of meat - I only used half and saved the rest. I added half an onion as well. It was a very flavourful soup. The lemon gave it a nice refreshing touch.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have to change a thing about it! The soup became creamy and delicious after the eggs and lemon were added and was so perfect! Definitely don't make this if you don't like lemon - but I'm a lemon lover and it was FANTASTIC!

Was looking for a recipe to use up my orzo I had left ofver and this one fit the bill!  Tasted just like liquid lemon chicken!  I used two chicken breasts and boiled them in the chicken stock and then shredded it.

It was a little too tangy for my husband's taste, but I loved it! Next time I will add a little less lemon. I also used chicken breasts that I cut into 1 inch chunks instead. This is definitely a keeper. Thank you!

This is good.  It only has a few items in the soup so it tastes as if it lacks a little.  It is quick and easy to make.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

Excellent change of pace soup! Quite refreshing and definitely a keeper!  I, too, also added the chicken broth, garlic and onion!  I didnt have the oroz on hand, so I substituted pasta shells. Worked well. Even the kids enjoyed it!  Thank you for sharing!

I added garlic as someone suggested. Needed some seasoning, otherwise very filling and the lemon gives it a fresh taste.

This recipe is easily convertible from stove top to slow cooker. The lemon adds a wonderfully refreshing quality to this soup. Hot summers won't keep me from making it year-round! Unless you like mushy orzo, add/cook the pasta last or as needed for leftovers.

I altered this recipe by using the zest of 1 lemon, and it's juice.  I also sauted an onion and garlic and added 1 package of frozen spinach.  I used leftover rice instead of orzo, and it was great!

Hearty soup, but it is missing something.  I think it needs some herbs (marjoram maybe) & perhaps some onion & garlic, too.  I will have to experiment a bit more with it.  I wound up adding a can of low sodium chicken broth before adding the pasta b/c I didn't think there was enough liquid & I was right.  It does have a bright lemon flavor & you have to like lemon to like this soup. Easy to make, but needs some flavor tweaking.

I was looking for recipes using lemon and stumbled upon this recipe.  I did use chicken broth instead of water.  My whole family enjoyed it very much.  Hubby took the leftovers for lunch today, that's a good sign he really liked it!

Really good.  A new kind of chicken soup, without the noodles and veggies!  It was a little more refreshing than traditional chicken soup, plus lemon is a good source of vitamins when fighting colds.  I will definitely make again.  I did add onion and bouillon.

This was pretty tasty! I did use stock instead of water, and followed another reviewer's suggestion to add some onion and garlic to the broth while cooking. Additionally, I topped with some stewed carrots and celery - to add some color and texture. Next time, i would add some more broth, and cook the pasta separately to keep it from getting mushy. Thanks for the tasty recipe.

My whole family enjoyed this soup.  Its great on a cold day and an excellent break from the usual heavy winter soups.  That tangy-lemony-chickeness is cheerful and warming at the same time.

I really enjoyed this soup.  I added onions and garlic at the beginning - cooked until soft and then added other stuff.  I also cooked with a sprig of rosemary.
As others suggested, I used only 1 lemon, but I couldn't really taste the lemon flavor.  It was still a very nice soup and I will make it again.  Next time I'll play with the lemon.
Thanks for sharing!

I am  not normally a fan of soup, but my boyfriend has been feeling under the weather. I combined this broth with a more traditional chicken soup recipe (turnips, carrots, celery, onion, chicken, rosemary, garlic) and it was fantastic!

I have been making this for my family a lot ... really nice touch for leftover chicken.  They all LOVE it!  I use a high-quality prepared stock and go from there ... though I prepare my orzo separately and add it later.  There is a tendency toward frothing if you cook your pasta in soup, so I cook the pasta in a separate pot, rinse a few times, and then add it to the soup with the chicken.  Makes for a clearer soup.

I was not a fan of this soup.  There is way too much lemon and I didn't care for the texture of the pasta.

I loved this soup.  I added a small chopped onion and a little garlic and threw in some fresh spinach at the end.  Yum!

I thought this recipe was excellent, although I took the advice of many reviewers and added garlic, celery, carrots, onion, and some thyme. I also didnt add as much lemon, but used 1 1.5 lemons instead of two.I also added chicken boullion, with chicken broth in the can for added flavor.  Definately a keeper for my recipe box.

Tired of the same old chicken soup?? Then you need to try this one. Lively and flavorful, it is a hit with my whole family. No small accomplishment when since there are 8 people in my family!!!!

YUUUMMMMMM!!!  This was great!  I used skinless/boneless chicken thighs/breasts, cooked in 8 cups of fat free broth and chopped garlic.  After cooking I skimmed the fat and then added a little water to bring it up to 8 cups again.   I only used 1 and 1/4 lemon and it was really good... not too lemony.  If I had made it just for me I would have used both of the lemons, but my husband doesn't love lemon as much as me!  I also added some frozen spinich at the end.  It was good, and you could definitely taste the spinich.  Next time I make it (and there will be a next time) I probably will not put in spinich, just to see how it tastes.  Lastly, I was worried that there would not be enough of this soup for the 3 of us.  Hah!  It's actually pretty filling and pretty thick.  With an added salad and with a loaf of bread this soup could feed 6 adults comfortably.  ENJOY!

This was very Yummy and easy to make.  I made a few changes;

I sauted skinless/boneless breasts in the pot and once cooked, I removed them and added veggies (onion, peppers, celery, and garlic).  I added the stock, then the cooked chicken.  I added crushed red pepper flakes to kick it up.  I only used one lemon as suggested by others.

This was the best chicken soup I've ever made!

This was a total disappointment. I thought I'd try my hand at this after having the most delicious lemon chicken soup from a nearby Greek restaurant. Sadly, it had the strangest flavor and I ended up throwing the whole thing out. This was after taking other reviewers' advice of adding the onion and garlic. I'm a huge lemon fan, but this was awful.

very bland. Not much flavor. Needs some herbs or spices. Very plain. I paired it with a Chateau Ste Michelle Sweet Riesling and the wine paired well. The wine was excellent but the dish was boring and bland.

I LOVE this soup however, I don't care for it to be thickened so, I've made a few changes. I eliminate the eggs; add a 1/2 chopped onion, and I squeeze the juice of the lemons into the water. I also put a 1/2 a lemon rind in with the water and add 2 Bay leaves. Gives it a nice lemony flavor that tastes even better on Day 2. Lower in Cholesterol too.

I Like the "lemony" flavor.  However my boyfreind did not like the strong lemon taste.  I think I will keep this recipe only keep it down to half the amount of lemon and I am really glad I followed other reviewer's advice and added the spinach and garlic, it would not have been the same without it, very bland.

I made a few variations, but I LOVE the simplicity of this recipe. It is easy, fast and yummy. I used organic chicken stock and then added pre-cooked orzo and roasted chicken. I also added fresh basil to top it off and it was great. Everyone in my family has asked for the recipe!

I followed the recipe as is and I did not care for taste.  I should have added garlic, onions, and bouillon as suggested by other reviewers.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I've been looking for a great egg-lemon soup recipe for years.  I grew up with a Greek next door neighbor and she always made us a yummy pot of this soup and I've been dying to make it ever since we moved.  It's just as I remembered. It will definitely become a regular in our house.  I just have to find something else to substitute the orzo since we've gone low-carb recently.  Thanks again Therese!

I did not enjoy this recipe at all.  The flavor was good but the texture was kinda slimey.  I think I may try it again using rice instead of pasta.
