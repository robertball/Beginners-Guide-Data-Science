I have to admit I was surprised at how well this turned out. I had never heard of mac and cheese soup and mostly tried the recipe out of curiosity but it tasted really great! I'm pretty sure my husband would have eaten the whole pot on his own. I did add a can of tomatoes with green chilies just because it seemed like it needed a little more color. Super easy and pretty tasty!

I was a little skeptical when I first saw this recipe and when I went grocery shopping bought a few things to add to the recipe if I didn't like it. However once I finished the directions I tasted it and fell in love!! I made too much macaroni so it turned out more like actual mac n cheese (and after it set overnight it really WAS) but I adored it. I will definitely be making this again!

I followed the recipe exact only cutting the recipe in half though I did not cut the bacon in half I kept that the same. For us the chicken bouillion made this way too salty. We really could not eat past a couple bites. I'd make this again but omit it all together--I think it would be much better.

My 12-year-old daughter and I made this together. We really liked it though we did make some changes. We didn't have jar cheese sauce so we made "Glen's Cheese Sauce." I think I would always use that as the cheese base instead of something processed. We decided to leave out the bouillon and just added more chicken broth at the end to thin the consistency out a little. We were confused by what "ground red chili pepper" is exactly. We replaced with cayenne pepper. Wow! That was spicy which we both like. But I can't serve it to my son so I think we would reduce that by half or use paprika instead.

I was so excited to try this! I found it to be way too salty. The chicken bouillon I believe put it over the top. I will try this again but lessen the amount of bouillon if not omit it all together. Also may try a low sodium broth. It was very easy to put together and would have tasted great otherwise! Thank you for the recipe.

Thank you Luv2Cook for this quick and satisfying soup recipe! I whipped this up with what I had in my pantry on the fly so had to sub for the jarred cheese sauce. I used one can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup and 4 oz. of Velveeta cheese chunks. Everything else was made per the recipe. Next time I will dial back the chicken bouillon to one tablespoon. We're a little salt/sodium sensitive. Thank you again!

Made this soup for dinner. Only thing I did different was substitute ground beef for the bacon.
