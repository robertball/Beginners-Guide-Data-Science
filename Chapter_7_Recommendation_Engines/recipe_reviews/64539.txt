Great family recipe everybody in the house ate it...even the picky ones! I added chopped jalapeno's to the corn bread part used two boxes of jiffy corn bread mix a 55oz can of Bush's homestyle beans to which I added chopped onion. It also only took about 1 1/2 pkgs of "Beef" hot dogs sliced in about 1/4" slices to cover the top of the beans baked it for 40 mins. in a 9x13 pan and this fed a family of 6. Great Recipe! Tastes like Corn dogs and baked beans!

This was awesome - I don't understand why some people didn't like it. If you like baked beans cornbread and hot dogs (I used veggie hot dogs) you should love this. (If you don't then why are you even considering it?!) One thing though - when she tells you to cover the beans as completely as possible she isn't kidding. I didn't have enough hot dogs and the sauce from the beans bubbled up through the cornbread so it was kind of wet at the bottom and oozed out a little when I cut it into it. I just put it back in the oven for a few minutes and it was fine. But next time I may try that layer of grated cheese another reviewer suggested. As it is my husband and I ate the whole thing!

I noticed some mixed reviews on measurements. I needed the recipe cut in half. I used 7 hot dogs cut up into 1/4" slices 1 - 16.5 ounce can of Bushes original baked beans 1 - 8.5 ounce box of Jiffy corn muffin mix. Cooked at 400 for 23 minutes. I did not cover with foil. Recipe yielded 4 servings. Casserole turned out really well. Husband really liked this recipe and I enjoyed it as well. I will probably use more baked beans next time as I like them alot.

OK I have to admit I ate some of this and it wasn't half bad (really). But it's a huge hit with the kids; and I like it because it's so easy I let them make it themselves. TIP: lean hotdogs are a must for this and adding an egg white to the cornbread lightens it up a bit too.

Super easy...kids loved the ingredients. I did add some brown sugar to the beans and for some reason I thought I needed a 2nd box of corn muffin mix (didn't look like enough). It was way too much! So stick to the one box. Also thought it could use more baked beans. Will definitely make again!!

My family LOVED this! I doctored up the beans to our liking and drained some of the juice off of them. Had no problems with leakage. Kids thought it was fabulous hubby said it was a keeper! I served it with corn on the cob and a green salad. Very good!

Totally pointless recipe. Might as well just make beanie weenie and cornbread save yourself some time and oven energy. By the way it does NOT taste like corndogs and baked beans; the cornbread does not have a strong enough flavor to create that effect. It tastes like beanie weenie. With cornbread. Tastes like a big pile of salt.

I was surprised how good this was! I used turkey hotdogs just to try and make it a little healthier. I really like corndogs and this has a similar taste. However I think I like the casserole even better! I had to race my grandchildren to the dish so that I could get seconds too haha. I may try a little grated cheese in the cornbread mix sometime but that may be too many different flavors.

I liked this casserole a lot despite the weird ingredients. Adding kielbasa instead of just hotdogs adds an extra savory twist.

I made this a lot when I first moved out into my own studio apartment. Only difference was I added Frank's and if I had it cheese and a drained can of corn. This makes a lot and is darn tasty for bein' cheap eats. Plus little ones like it too!

I can't say I was too impressed. It was like eating a soggy corn dog as if the food on your plate was too close together. I did put a layer of cheese down but still kinda icky. On a good note however: the boyfriend loved it and even had seconds. I won't be making this again for myself...but maybe if he requests it again.

This is a lot like a recipe that I've made for years for my kids except I add mustard powder ketchup and minced onion to mine and I cook the bean/hot dog mixture before I add the corn bread mix so that the corn bread cooks on the bottom better. Great recipe though! I love it for cold yucky days.

This was good. Yes it tastes like Beenie-Weenie w/ cornbread on the side but look at the ingredients....what were people expecting?! My 6 year old loved this for leftovers too. I was nervous about the size of the pan but it turned out fine. Next time I will try to add a little onion mixed in.

Can't get any easier than this one! I opted to use a 7x11 instead of the 9x13 and glad I did. I had 1-1/2 pkgs of hot dogs and found it to be plenty. I didn't find the cornbread too dry at all. I did bake it for 35 minutes; next time I'll only bake it for 30 minutes. My hubby really enjoyed this. Will do again!

Was very tasty. We used a large can of baked beans (lightly drained) about 5 hot dogs a sprinkle of cheddar cheese and 1 box of cornbread mix in a 8x8 pan and cooked for 28 minutes at 375F (convection). It was just right (with vegetable sides) for 3 small kids and two adults. A nice recipe change for hot dogs!

Like other reviews this is a new favorite in our home but with the adults! The kids didn't care for it. Maybe in a few years. My "POOR-CHEF" substitutions: I used 4 hot dogs (it was all we had) and it turned out great! We didn't have corn bread mix so I used about two-thirds of this recipe "Corny Corn Bread" (look it up and my review there too) YUM! We had 2 15 oz cans of Baked Beans and I added dark corn syrup cause we had it. Enjoy!!

This sounded so good and I loved the idea so much that I decided to try it but with a few changes (according to what I had on hand & suggestions of others before me). Rather than hot dogs I had a 16 oz pkg. of kielbasa sausage that I sliced and sauted with some chopped onion first. Worried that the bean juice would make the cornbread soggy I sprinkled a layer of shredded cheese over the sausage to create a barrier as someone suggested. I used a 28 oz. can plus a 14 oz. can of Bushes "Touch of Maple Syrup" baked beans and prepared a 16 oz. package of Marie Callendars "just add water" cornbread mix. I added some shredded cheese to my batter plus some chopped jalapenos. I used all but "4 muffins worth" of the cornbread mix. (I baked those separate for tomorrow's black eyed peas). Anyway I baked this for about 40 minutes and the cornbread was baked thru and moist but the beans on the bottom seemed too dry & sticky for some reason. (May have been that "touch of maple"...not sure) Other than that it tasted really good and and my husband liked it so that's all that matters! I highly recommend the kielbasa too. I'll give it another try with the regular ingredients but on a smaller scale next time. Thanks!

The name perfectly describes this casserole! The sweetness was a little off-putting next time I might dice some jalepenos or add some pepper jack to cut the sweetness.

Very good recipe cannot wait to modify it with other ingredients. I used an 8x8 pan slightly drained Homestyle Bush Beans I used 6 cut up Nathan's hot dogs and Jiffy cornbread mix. I cooked it for about 30 minutes at 400 degrees - any longer in the oven and I would have burned the cornbread. My 2 year old went nuts kept asking for more. I dipped my serving in ketchup and mustard - yummy! Fun and easy recipe!

I did as some said and put a small amount of cheddar cheese between the beans and hotdogs. I actually halved the entire recipe and put it in a 8"x8" dish which worked well for my husband & I. SUGGESTION: Try using Chile Beans instead of Baked Beans. Chile beans makes it more like a chile & cornbread meal and just better. I added extra spices to my can of Bush's Chile Beans (cumin chile powder and a little cayenne pepper)... it was good! Nothing I'd make if we had guests coming but totally worth it for about 2 per person! Thanks Xekoliara!

I liked the beans with cornbread part but I think next time I'll cook the hotdogs separately. I used the jiffy mix cornbread but it didn't seem to cover the 9x13 pan. But two boxes probahbly would have been too much. I think I'll try this again in a 11x7 pan. I also added chopped onion. Thanks

This is really easy and it tastes like a corndog. i only made this recipe because im broke and have been making a lot of cheap dishes lately. With that said I say spend an extra 65 cents and throw in an extra can of baked beans... without it the meat to bean ratio is a bit overwhelming. this would be good for a barbecue or an outside covered dish party or if you are entertaining a bunch of five year olds or men who like corndogs.

I cooked it at 400 f as specified and luckily checked it after only 30 minutes. The corn-bread was way too dark almost burnt at that point. Good tasting combination but cooking at 400 for that long isn't right.

When I had my second child a girlfriend suggested that I try this recipe. I'm so glad that we did. My Family loves this. IF I feel like "doctoring" the baked beans I do btu sometimes I don't. I serve this with either fruit slices or green salad. Quick and easy and actually worth eating you can't be that 5 days out of the week!:)

My husband actually wanted to rate this with 28 stars! He loved it. I made a couple of changes. I used an 8x8 pan since it's just the two of us and I used the large can of Maple Baked Beans. I added some onion to this. Then i chopped up 5 to 6 hotdogs on top sprinkled that with shredded cheddar cheese. Then I used a box of honey cornbread mix and baked for about 30 mins! Quick easy and the husband loved it!

Just wanted to add that I have made a similar version using 2 15oz cans of chili instead of the baked beans. We call it Chili Corn Dog Pie. Kids love it. Tonight I will be trying the baked beans version tho since I do have a some I want to use up. Can't wait to try it.:D

Good not great. The cornbread was gritty - maybe I just picked the wrong brand. Hubby said it was better as leftovers and wants it made again this time putting the cornbread on the botom (maybe baking the cornbread first and then baking the beans etc on top?).

For being in the mood for pork and beans (a rarity for me) this totally hit the spot. I used 2 cans of beans (drained one of them so less liquid) 1 package of dogs (the long-as-the-bun size which ended up being just enough to fully cover the beans) and one package of corn muffin mix. Worked like a charm. Probably won't make it for another year since it's not what usually floats my boat but it was great for the craving!

It was really good my whole family loved it. And we actually had left overs because it was so filling. You may want to cook it a bit longer cause with the amount of time they tell you to cook it the cornbread wasn't all the way cooked.

It was as good as a hot dog based casserole could've been. This is a kid pleaser for sure. It's quick easy and cheap. It was a little salty for me but processed meat always tastes that way.

This was good for what it was the kids loved it. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor but there isn't much in it. I would definately make it again and play around with it some (I always doctor my baked beans but just dumped the can in for this). I would definately add some cheese next time too. Over all it was an easy cheap and pretty yummy casserole:).

I was kind of disappointed with this dish. You definitely cannot add two packages of hot dogs in a 9 X 13 inch dish and I had to cook the dish an extra 20 minutes with tin foil on it to make sure the cornbread was done in the middle and not burnt on the outside. Won't be making this again.

MY KIDS DIDNT LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THE CORNBREAD. IT TOOK AN EXTRA 20 MINS TO COOK ALL THE WAY THRU. I DIDNT THINK IT WAS BAD BUT NOT WORTH THE TIME. EASIER ON A ROLL WITH BEANS ON THE SIDE!

I was looking for a way to use up leftover baked beans from a picnic when I came across this recipe. I love how the combining of such simple and familiar foods is what really makes this recipe unique. We all loved this and I will be making it again. The kids and husband topped theirs with shredded cheddar though it is not necessary. I did not need to bake it as long as the recipe said. Very filling and yummy thank you!

I've been an All Recipes user for awhile & this is my FIRST review because it's THAT good! I was hesitant to make it because to me it sounded not so good but my fiance persisted & finally got his way. We both LOVE it! We used barbecue baked beans. It's really very very good! I was surprised! It'll be a regular in our home now.

I thought that this was really tasty and super easy to make. I deviated a bit from the original recipe though. I used 1 package of hot dogs and 1 package of polish sausage. I also used 2 packages of corn bread instead of just 1. I also sprinkled some shredded cheese over the top of it once the rest of it was done baking. I'll also be adding some creamed corn to it the next time that we make it as well as for leftovers this time. It seems a little dry without the creamed corn but otherwise it's excellent!

sooo yummy! it is like eating a great big corn dog! However i did have issues with the 9 by 13 in pan. one package of hot dogs covered the pan. The one pacage of corn bread batter was not enuf to cover the 9 by 13 pan so i made another and that did the trick However this makes it dry to eat with all the bread. Next time i am going to use 3/4 of the beans a smaller pan all the hotdogs stated and then just one package of corn bred.

I cook on Saturdays for the rest of the week. I made this casserole for the first time and served it on Monday and used slices beef smoke sausage instead. It kept very well for 2 days the cornbread wasn't soggy as I had expected and My whole family LOVED it! It was almost too easy! KEEPING this as a family favorite! lol

The recipe title says it all-easy cheap and yummy! I think I only spent like 4.50 total on this meal. I did change the recipe a bit because I wanted to squeeze a veggie in there. I put in 2-28oz cans of Bush's Original Baked Beans then a whole package of sliced hot dogs (8 total). For the topping I mixed two boxes of Jiffy Cornbread mix with one egg 1/3 cup milk and 1 can of creamed corn. I baked it at 400 for about 40 minutes. It was very good! With the top the way I made it it was almost a bit like one of my other favorite recipes from this site Awesome and Easy Corn Casserole. I will definitely make this again!

Like one of the reviewers recommended I also put a layer of cheddar over the layer of beans. It smelled wonderful; I made it for a friend who just had surgery. The next time I make it I plan to add a layer of bacon between the beans and cheddar and also make 1 1/2 boxes of cornbread as the one box didn't coat the entire top of the casserole. It's too heavy for me so I hope my friend and her family enjoyed it.

This recipe was very easy and tasted pretty good. The kids really liked it. I don't know if I'd make it for myself but will certainly be making it for the nephews and grandkids again. NOTE - I used two packages of jiffy corn bread mix and two cans of beans in a 9 x 13 inch pan. I only cooked it at 400 for 30 minutes and the corn bread was brown and done through.

I had to cook it longer to keep it from being doughy and then the top was really hard. I like the adding butter to the top idea. We use chili instead of baked beans and add a bit of cheese to the top too.

The recipe was Very Good!! My husband and 2yr old thought is was good even my teenage stepson went for seconds and that's saying something. I used only one package of bun length hotdogs and that was more than enough. The only thing I would change when I make it again would be to use two boxes of cornbread mix instead of one.

This recipe turned out better than I expected. I made it for a football party. People seemed to like it but they didn't love it. I wanted to post a photo of the recipe but it is not an attractive looking meal. Also the casserole does not reheat well. I used vegetarian hot dogs which worked out well. I will not make this recipe again but I enjoyed trying it out.

I lowered the temp to 375. Added 1/2 chopped onion and a drained can of corn. Drained a little of the sauce from the beans so it wouldn't be that wet. I'm gluten free so used a gluten free cornmeal mix. Also added cheese to the cornbread mix. This turned out wonderfully and will be making this again. It was a big hit. This would be great for a family picnic...........

I made quite a few changes to this recipe so I'm not too sure if my rating still applies. It was good. I added a layer of spinach (27oz can) a layer of shredded parmesan (approx. 3 oz) 3 whole green chiles (minced and combined with spinach prior to cooking a dollop of sour cream to each serving and here is my take: The spinach was a fantastic addition and the can only cost me 75 cents however I don't beleive the parmesan did anything for the meal. The chiles added flavor and took some of the hot dog potency away from the meal. The hot dogs were too much. Next time I make this I would like to use a different meat. And what I think was ther best addition to this meal was the sour cream. Good eatin'!

It is ok for when I am really out of cash. I got tried of the hot dog taste really fast and my son stopped eating it after 5 minutes. Maybe when my husband comes back from deployment he would like it. I paid... Baked Beans 1.70 2 Packages Hot Dog 2.00 1 Box corn bread mix 0.53 Total = 4.23

Fantastic and super easy! I made two different pans of this: One with beef hot dogs and regular baked beans and a smaller one with vegetarian hot dogs and vegetarian baked beans. I used a homemade cornbread recipe to which I added one can of creamed corn and a little asiago cheese and provolone cheese. I covered the bean and hot dogs with the cornbread mixture and sprinkled over the top some sharp cheddar -- not too much but enough to make it crisp up and give a little more texture. Served it with asparagus and both my kids asked for seconds. This is a rarity with a picky eater in the house so this will definitely on our recipe list. Thanks!

I don't like store bought baked beans so I chose to make my own and followed everything else as recipe called. My husband loved it and so did my kids. We usually have it twice a month. It's just a big beenie weenie dish.

Fun cheap and easy as well as yummy. I changed up the recipe a little bit to use up some leftovers I had the night before when I made tacos. I used ground beef seasoned with taco spices in place of the hot dogs and I used a can of refried beans (the mashed kind) in place of the baked beans. I left everything else the same cooked it up then served it topped with sour cream chopped tomatos and shredded lettuce! Delicious!

Kids LOVED it! I tried this out the first time with smoked turkey sausage instead of hot dogs. Added brown sugar and a bit of butter to the beans but doubled the corn bread. Served with corn on a roll (what my kids call corn on the cob) and a side salad. It's truly Dinner. Done!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some chicken hot dogs which my family didn't care for by themselves and this worked great. I used canned chili in place of the baked beans and I sliced my dogs thinner than called for using only 1 package which was perfect. My hubby and 3 teenage boys all liked this a lot. I will definitely make this again and now I have a reason to buy the chicken hot dogs again.:-)

This is exactly like you think it would be - beanie weenies w/ cornbread. Not that this is a bad thing but it's not new either. Of course the daughter and husband LOVED it - about as much as they like regular beanie weenies w/ cornbread on the side.;) But it's a different way to present it and you can add other things like cheese corn onions and/or other veggies that will be covered up by the corn bread. That's a plus for the kids.

This was good but not outstanding like I was expecting from the previous reviews. I altered it to make less: I used a 9x9 pan 1 16 oz. can of original baked beans 1 whole package of regular bun length hotdogs and 1 package of jiffy corn bread (mixed as directed on the box). I layered the beans and then all of the hot dogs cut into 1/4 in slices (it made 2 full layers) and I did not have any problem with the cornbread being soggy. I baked on 400 for 30 minutes and cornbread was a perfect golden brown around the edges. Will make again but may try another flavor of beans.

This recipe is a great base for some very tasty meals. Some simple adjustments can turn this from simply cheap and filling to a much more palate-appeasing dish. Try spreading cheddar cheese on top of the cornbread or mincing up an onion with the hot dogs. There are plenty of minor adjustments that can add a world of flavor to this basic recipe. Love it! Couldn't be easier.

Wow!! This is DELICIOUS!! My family has requested it several times. I add some finely minced onion to the beans and dot the cornbread mixture with butter before baking and it comes out perfect every time. I use only one package of hot dogs and I like to saute them before adding them to the casserole. So easy and sooo good!!

This recipe is great. Very quick simple and cheap to make. All though the cornbread did come out a little too dry-----I just slapped on some butter on top and I fixed that problem. I will surely make this recipe again in the near future.

I was surprised that so few ingedients could yield such a good casserole! The only thing I did that was different from the original recipe was to bake it in a 2 qt. casserole dish instead of a 13x9 pan. The beans didn't dry out and it turned out really well. My (PICKY) husband loved it!

I call this corn dog casserole. My family loves it it's perfect for my picky eaters. I used my own homemade sweet cornbread recipe instead of box mix. I used some leftover baked beans from our cookout and a 22 oz. can of bush's grilling sensation steakhouse beans. Yum. It took forever for me to cook it over an hour. But that was my fault. Since I had less beans I used a 9x9 pan and it ended up filling to the very top with cornbread. I also started the first 45min at 375 degrees b/c that's what my cornbread recipe calls for. It was still liquid so I bumped the temp up to 425 and cooked it for about 20-30 min longer. I also used some shredded cheese it it. I will make this again.

My husband and I made this because we are o.k. a budget and this was wallet friendly. We both agree that it taste like a corndog with baked beans. It was very good given the ingredients. I can see how kids like this as well. We used Bush's Baked Beans in the Burien sugar and maple flavor for added sweetness. We might throw in some brown sugar next time. If you are looking for a cheap and easy recipe this is a great one!

I didn't have baked beans so I substitued with ranch style beans... and like some of the others I put shredded cheddar over the hot dogs... But I can imagine this being really good with the baked beans too... This was great and I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs!! I'm eating this right now as I leave this review and I am already planning on going back for more! I will make this again as it was easy and very yummy! Great recipe! Glad I found it!

Single mom with two teenage boys and they loved it. I only made an 8x8 pan used chili at the bottom since I didnt have beans. Made the cornbread from scratch and it was a huge hit. I'll have to make a larger pan so we have leftovers next time! I'll be using this one over and over again...maybe add cheese to the cornbread!

This was a fun creative and definately low cost meal. The taste was not bad but the texture was a little strange for me. I was careful to layer the hot dogs to make a barrier between the beans and cornbread mis but the cornbread batter does mix some with beans creating a "grainy" texture which did not appeal to me or my family. Perhaps a different cornbread mix would have been better.

To make it a little more hearty I add a pound or two (depending on how many I'm feeding) of cooked ground beef. You don't have to use so many hot dogs with the ground beef.

This was just OK. I fed this to 5 kids and not a single one finished a serving. I used Jennie-O turkey dogs and store brand baked beans. Maybe all beef hotdogs would make it taste better but still wouldn't be worth the calories (not to mention the fat). Darn...I really wanted to like this one:(

Hmmmm. I hate to be the giving a bad rating.... Since my bf was working late I made half of XEKOLIARA's recipe for myself. Being that I am unemployed and on a budget this fit the bill perfectly (all ingredients cost under 5!!!). The fact that this is cheap and easy to prepare is deserving of 5 stars alone but unfortunately I am not rating on these criteria (I am rating on taste as I usually do). My only changes were to use 1 (16 oz.) can of pork & beans (the only other size I could find were Campbell's 11 oz. cans) and the full package of Jiffy cornbread mix (I don't see the point in wasting half of it). Oh and I sprinkled about 1/2 c. of finely shredded cheddar cheese on top of my casserole during the last 5 minutes of baking. I had high hopes but was very disappointed with the end result. This casserole was DRY the hot dogs had a "wierd" texture (almost too soft IMHO) and my cornbread topping was VERY brown despite baking it on the short end of the recommended time. Perhaps using two (11 oz.) cans of beans would help (i.e. add moisture)??? Since I have no kiddos to cook for (and my bf thought this sounded gross...) I won't be making this again. Sorry but not for me!

It seemed like a good idea when I started. The corn bread covered I had no "oozing" of the beans during baking but I did not care for this! The beans hardly had any flavor and I used Bush Beans. They almost disappeared. Maybe if I used a tangier type of hot dog but it was just so bland. I would say I'll try to add things next time to "Perk it up but there will be no next time for this.

Taste is wonderful! The only thing I would suggest would be to double up on the beans. I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was a bit dry. With double the beans it should be perfect! Will definitely make again!! =)

Wow! This lived up to its name! I baked it in a 8x8 pan with only 1 pkg of very thinly cut hot dogs (enough t0 completely layer over the beans twice). And I drained a lot of the juice off the beans so it wasn't so soupy. The casserole turned out perfect! The cornbread stayed where it was supposed to. Even when it was all mixed together it never got mushy. My kids (2.5 and 4.75) and husband loved it and so did I! We will definitely make this one again. My husband calls it "Corn Dog Casserole".

For what it is- cheap and yummy- I rate it 5 stars! It was easy and fun to make and eat. Hubby LOVED it! Kids liked it! Took only 1.5 pack of hot dogs to cover beans...but guess it wouldn't hurt to throw the extras on for heartier recipe or larger family.

Just like it sounds: Hubby liked it 2-year-old liked it I liked it. And it's cheap and OH SO EASY! I used the following: Ball Park franks because the recipe says the cornbread topping should not touch the beans and Ball Park franks "plump when ya cook 'em"; Bush's Original baked beans; and Martha White yellow corn muffin mix which was the only mix I could find that was the right size. While preparing it I thought there would not be enough cornbread topping but it turned out to be just right. We give it four stars only because we thought it was a little bit dry when made as directed in the recipe. Next time I will use more beans or perhaps ones that are a little "juicier " like Van Camp's pork 'n' beans. Also this was not quite as good when reheated as leftovers but that might be because I used the microwave instead of the oven.

been making this for years actually tastes better next day after cornbread has sopped up a little juice. and yes it's similar to beenie weenie but if u use really good baked beans it tastes alot better. My new favorite alternate is using a southwestern style can of grillin beans and chorizo(please precook this well or casserole will be greasy). You can also use plain unsweetened cornbread batter add jalapenos to either variety of cornbread. you can also use any precooked sausage(polish andouille whatever). it's definitely a comfort food. try using chili also. you can skip the added meat with that. it's not fancy but it sure tastes good and could not be ezier to whip together.

This recipe definately needs to be made in a smaller pan! I ended up having to use 2 packages of cornbread mix which over-powered the other ingredients flavor wise and also dried the entire dish out. Otherwise this was a good kid-friendly dish. I might try adding some shredded cheddar between the dogs and cornbread next time.

Easy but not necessarily quick. It takes awhile to slice up the hot dogs and to then carefully arrange the slices so that the beans and cornbread don't touch. Could be a good activity to involve kids in.

This was good and easy I give it 4 stars. We used "Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread" recipe instead of Jiffy mix and I know this made it a LOT better. Don't be afraid to really put a lot of hotdogs in it because once it's done you'll want it kinda meaty. We also put a decent layer of shredded cheddar on top of the hotdogs which helped protect the cornbread mix from getting bean juice on it. Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely very good! You should make sure you cook the corn bread all the way. I read a lot of the reviews before I made it and it came out great. My one complaint was that is (for me) was a bit dry. I added ketchup to my bowl but my husband was fine with it. We both enjoyed it very much and put it together very quickly by working together - practicing sign language while it baked and it was done in NO time flat.

Big hit in my house. We use deer sausage instead of hotdogs only because it's what we have in the freezer. I used a smaller dish because the 1 pkg of cornbread didn't cover the larger dish. Used 2 pkg of cornbread the first time to cover and it was just too much cornbread.

Not bad! I used a smaller can of Hormel chile beans (slightly drained) about 4 turkey hotdogs (diced up) and a box of Jiffy cornbread. I served it with a dollop of sour cream and my older son devoured it! It is cheap and super quick to prepare -I just mixed it all together instead of layering it and baked it off.

I made this casserole for my boyfriend and his guy friends and they loved it! The cornbread did take awhile to bake in the middle while the top was getting more and more brown. Next time I make it I'll use a wider dish so that the cornbread can be a thinner layer. Overall it was really tastey and fast.
