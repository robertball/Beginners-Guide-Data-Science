Ohhh for my love of anything buffalo flavored…I think I found the perfect summertime grilling dish, a spicy buffalo chicken sandwich done in under 20 minutes!  Served with homemade blue cheese dressing and celery sticks.  It doesn’t get any better than this on a weeknight, and it would be perfect for any backyard BBQ!

Just yum!  I actually did this on stovetop and used ranch dressing with blue cheese crumbles added in.  My lettuce was red leaf.  We always use what we have on hand, and this was perfect!  We love this combo!  Thanks, Ball Park Buns!

Delicious sandwich. I added blue cheese crumbles and iceberg lettuce instead of Bibb lettuce. Will make again!

Coated chicken with wing sauce and put in Ziploc in fridge overnight.  Used plain hamburger buns (not toasted).

Otherwise followed directions, and these were GREAT.  Thought they might get too spicy with the overnight wing sauce marinade... but they were just right.

If you like Buffalo wings, you'll love this sandwich.  My family did.  Highly recommended.

Oh mama!! This is amaze-balls!! I love buffalo sauce and this just might be my favorite new way to eat it! I made a blue cheese dressing recipe off of this site to go with it, cooked the chicken breast on the smoker at 375 degrees, basting frequently. Only thing I did differently was to add some mozzarella (because I couldn’t help my freaking self) and some thinly sliced red onion. Un-be-lievable!!! Def a keeper.

I VERY liberally used Frank's Red Hot Hot Sauce as that is my favorite.  I didn't use blue cheese dressing as I didn't have it - I used blue cheese crumbles and some mayo on the bun instead.  This is my current favorite sandwich and will make this whenever we grill chicken!

These turned out pretty good. I did use spinach instead of lettuce because I had some on hand that was needing used.  I also used grape tomatoes because that is the only tomatoes my husband will eat. If you don't  like blue cheese, ranch would work nicely with this too.  Overall good sandwich and one I would definitely make again.

It was a good sandwich but we prefer the dip to the sandwich. I used iceberg lettuce instead of Bib lettuce.
