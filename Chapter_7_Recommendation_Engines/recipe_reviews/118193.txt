One of my girlfriends and I made this soup. We followed the directions pretty closely, but we added roasted red peppers and took care to add the grease from the sausage. Hubby loved it! So did we.

Good work.

A great soup! I added a half can of whole kernel corn; sauteed the sausage/onions in a tblsp. of olive oil and did not drain them; and doubled the garlic. It smelled fabulous while cooking and my family loved it. I can't wait to serve it in a pumpkin for an autumn gathering!

I signed up just to rate this with 5 stars.  It was sooooo good!  I used hot sausage.  I think it might be better called Potato/Sausage soup.  Definite sausage flavor more so than garlic.  This was a definite keeper.  

Also would make a great base for New England Clam Chowder or Cream of Broccoli, just by substituting different things for the sausage.

This is a really good recipe. I did do a few things different, however. First of all, I decided not to use sausage b/c of the grease. Instead, I cooked the onions with the potatoes, carrots, and garlic.  I also doubled the garlic and added a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it.

This soup is creamy and full of flavor.  It taste just like it should.  Want the milk mixture to thicken properly? After you have melted the butter and wisked in the flour add the milk slowly while whisking. Lightly  boil for a few minutes until it coats the back of a wooden spoon.

This soup was very good!  Both my husband and I enjoyed it!  Will definitely add more garlic next time though and maybe add some more sausage.  Really great though!

Made awesome potato soup!  Instead of 8 cups of milk, I used 4 cups milk, 4 cups water.  With the mashed potatoes mixed in, it was plenty creamy.  I also used spicy italian turkey sausages sliced up instead of ground sausage.  Great recipe though!

Absolutely incredible recipe.  I've been known substitute a little of the milk for heavy cream on particularly cold winter nights.

Allow a little extra time for the soup to thicken properly at high altitudes.

Not garlicky - and I automatically doubled the garlic (spanish roja) - so maybe some of the garlic flavor comes from the sausage, which I omitted to make this kosher dairy. To make up for the lost sausage flavor we added tobasco sauce (splashes in individual bowls based on who wanted how mild, so I can't give you an amount) and that added a bisque-y kick that made this very good.

Fantastic - and perfect for the fall weather we've been experiencing here as of late.  My guy was not too impressed when he heard that soup and sammys were on the menu, but I never heard him utter a word after he starting spooning this into his mouth.  Very good, filling and inexpensive which makes me say I'll put this one in the rotation!  Thanks much!

Best potato soup recipe that I have tried.  I forgot to add the garlic but it had just the right flavor anyway.  I might try adding chopped celery next time.

Fantastic recipe!  Just had this for dinner with freshly baked italian herb bread and am still full and happy from it.  I, too, refrained from draining the sausage, and it added great flavor.  Do your best to crumble the sausage finely, as it will mix and stay suspended in the soup better this way.  I never use enough parsley before it goes bad when I buy fresh, so I went with 1/2 tsp of dried, and it worked great.  Thanks for this amazing recipe, Beth!

This is the best soup I've ever had!
I made a substitution: bacon instead of sausage.  Delish!
I added a bit more milk.  It was sooooo good, I would give it 10 stars if I could.
My whole family loved it!

I was looking for a way to use up an abundance of potatoes, both red and russet.  I'm ready to go but I don't know which potato to use.  Can someone help me out with that detail? My real rating will come after I make (with triple garlic!).

I have been making this soup for years.  This is pretty darn good exactly how it written.  You can leave out the sausage for a meatless soup and it is still very tasty.  Add a lbs of crabmeat and cheese for a delicious crab bisque.   Add a little liquid smoke when you add ham to it.  Yummy, the possibilities are endless.

I  made this last week because I was getting a sore throat and needed some comfort food.  THIS WAS PERFECT.  I used hot italian sausage and it added some kick.  It made so much, I took it to a football watch party the next day - added a little more milk because it had thickened - HUGE HIT!!!

Recommended changes: cook some mushrooms in with the sausage, add extra garlic, reduce the amount of liquid unless you like soupy soup, serve with homemade bread. Very good recipe.

This was good but not great. Didn't do too much to alter the recipe other then that we added 1 pound of sausage instead of the 1/2 pound;I think that it gave it more substance. Also, added a few shots of hot sauce prior to serving. Next time we may mess with the seasoning to give it a little more flavor.

I make this recipe for a group of around 40 to 50 employees who work in a cold meat packing company. Everyone loves it!

When I make it at home I use Jennie-O Turkey sausage and skim milk to cut calories. Simple and Delicous.

By itself it is bland. I added rosemary, thyme, garlic salt and probably quadrupled the garlic...and it still could of used more.

This was just amazing!  First of all - I LOVE garlic and I added an entire head of garlic and it still didn't taste overly "garlicky".  I put in about a pound of sausage and I didn't drain the grease from the sausage.  I just added it to the soup.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  It was so delicious.  I will definitely make this one again!

This was great, but I tweaked it a bit.  I added 1 C. of heavy whipping cream because I didn't want the sugar in 8 c. of milk.  Then in exchange I added 7 c. of chicken broth.  I added parsley but I thought it was missing something to seal the deal with the italian sausage so I added Taragon.  Wow......... many, many compliments!

Awesome soup! The first really good potato soup I've been able to make! I changed it a little bit, by not adding the sausage, so it can be basically vegetarian. I also added more garlic than suggested, with a mix of both fresh garlic and garlic granules. Quite a tasty meal, especially for chilly fall or winters day. :)

I was looking for something easy to make with what i had in the fridge and after doing an ingredient search this recipe came up! It was... Okay. Maybe a little better than okay, but not something I'm going to write home about. I make potato and shirmp chowder (very similar) but use cream cheese in the recipe. I think I was expecting it to taste more llike what I am familiar with so that maybe the reason behind my opinion, but all in all it wasn't bad and it satified my family. Maybe ill try this recipe with cream cheese?

Great soup, I made some changes and added some of the water from the boiled potatoes instead of all milk, and also added bacon instead of italian sausage, everyone in my family just loved it!

Very good! Next time I will mash more of the potatoes leaving less chunks (by request of my husband who is a little bit of a picky eater... He LOVED the sausage in it though!). I will also put a little less pepper in it next time.

Great creamy potato soup, however I eliminated the sausage to cut fat and added One and a half cups of cooked Wild Salmon at the end.  I also added an extra 2 cloves of garlic.  Great soup, can't go wrong

This was awesome! a huge hit on a cold winter day. i used whole milk to make it more creamy, doubled the amount of italian sausage (personal preference), and added a can of corn. i will deff make this again!

Great soup!  My kids even loved it and they never like soup, for some reason.  The husband kept coming back for more.  I used chicken and apple sausage to may it a bit healthier and replaced some of the milk with chicken broth for flaver.  Delicious!

i would recommend using spicy italian sausage. this turned out really bland. i ended up adding crushed red pepper and garlic powder. i had to cook it longer to let my added spices blend in. we had to wait longer for dinner which was a little annoying

quick, easy, and delish!  I used hot links instead of italian sausage, and used half soy milk/half 1% milk.  No one could tell the difference :)  I also look forward to trying this w/other meats, like clams.

I made this without the sausage (veg family) which is perhaps why I thought it was really bland.  My 14 month son loved it, though.  Friends over for dinner said it reminded them of grandparents' cooking -- very mellow (bland!) flavor, even with the garlic tripled.  It also took ~1.5 hours with all the peeling and chopping

I made this soup tonight and all of my friends ate it up!!  I did not use any sausage because my friend is a vegetarian and it was pretty good, but I would like to try it again with meat.  I think we were missing some flavor.

Very good soup. However, the sausage dominated over the more subtle potato and butter and milk flavors, so if I make this again, I will probably leave out the sausage and enjoy the soup's already hearty flavor without it.

Overall this is a good recipe but if I had followed this exactly I think it would have been way too thin.  The flavour is very nice though and a soup I will make again.  I used chorizo which went really well with the potato flavour.

I added water up to where I had veggies in the pot as per the recipe but then there was no room for the milk so I just didn't add it in.  The soup was delicious without it!

I was looking for a quick recipe to use up some Italian sausage and came across this one.  It was very tasty soup!  I doubled the garlic and used some leftover mashed potatoes because I discovered I had only two whole potatoes left.  While the recipe did require dirtying several pots/pans, it was still very good soup!

This soup is good, but not great-- which is why the three stars. It was a lot of work. Did anyone else notice that you had to dirty THREE different pans for this? If I ever do it again, I will use the same pot for all three steps.   It's a good thing I made it on a weekend, because I just don't have time for that during the week. It was a little bland, as well. I had to add extra seasoned salt and regular salt. I think I'll stick to my own potato soup base (which is far less work) and add the sausage as a variation.

This soup was really great. I wanted a recipe to move some of the veggies from my hubbys garden and this one hit the spot. I kept things the same but just added the whole pound of sausage that I had. It was perfect, our childen loved it and I had plenty to share with my neighbors too!

Definitely a keeper!  I added some celery that I had on hand and put three garlic cloves in it, but still didn't taste the garlic.  I think next time I will double the garlic.  I left out the seasoned salt because with the boullion it would have been too much salt.  Thanks for sharing!

Sometime you make something or do something that becomes a perfect point of spousal nagging. When I made it, my wife complained that she ate too much. Now she nags because I haven't made it again. Tonight we start again.

Very quick and easy recipe. Instead of 8 cups of milk, for more flavor and a thicker soup, I instead used 3 cups of milk and 3 cups of the vegetable broth.  I used the regular Jimmny Dean sausage, but next time I think I will use the hot and spicy version of this sausage. If you like hot and spicy, try adding a dash or two of cayenne pepper. Excellent!

We loved this recipe, I did tweak, I used the cooking liquid from potatoes as the broth, used 1 cup of left over mashed potatoes instead of breaking up the freshly cooked ones, proceeded with the recipe, the mashed potatoes I had on hand, made for an added thickner, and richer flavor. I will be making again

I'm relatively new to cooking and did not know...but MAKE SURE YOU STIR CONSTANTLY ONCE THE MILK IS IN! I burned the mixture to the bottom, but my hubby was able to rescue the soup by putting it in a big bowl and dumping it back once the pan was clean.  My husband liked this soup, though he usually doesn't like potato soup.  We used a spicy bulk Italian sausage, which is partially why he liked the recipe: more flavor.

Excellent! I added almost a whole bulb of the garlic, and even some garlic powder with the other seasonings. It still wasn't a strong garlic flavor. Next time I'm going to add coarsly chopped garlic the last minute of cooking the sausage mixture. Hopefully that will add the rich garlic flavor I was hoping for. But the sausage with the potato soup was fantastic! I also increased the sausage to a full pound, and added a few more potatos to stretch the soup even further. Thanks for the recipe!

Really rich and yummy - real comfort food.  Had to add 2 tbsp of cornstarch and I used 1.5c of cream and 6.5c of milk.  Would be good with bacon or ham chunks.  Also added a can of drained kernal corn.  Makes a lot of soup( it's more like a chowder) - Next time I will try to half the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did end up adding some garlic salt, but otherwise I found it to be very good. A good hearty, fall soup.

Awesome!  Just what I wanted.  I used nitrate-free turkey lunch meat instead, and used 4 cups 1/2 n 1/2 w/4 cups water.  I didn't even use parsley, just salt & pepper.  Wonderful!

This is a very good soup!! My whole family loved it. The only things I did different was to use skim milk and turkey sausage instead of what it called for. Will definitely make again! My hubby said "It's a good end to a snow filled day!"

Very good soup!  The sausage really makes it though.  My husband talked me in to trying a different type of meat so I tried using chunks of steak.  Not impressive.  Definitely stick with the sausage.
