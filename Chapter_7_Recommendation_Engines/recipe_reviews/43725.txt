I must admit, when I read the recipe I had doubts.  I like mushrooms, but somehow the combination didn't appeal all that much.  On the other hand I had the ingredients on hand and needed a side dish.  Delicous!  We loved it and will use again!

This has the beginnings of a really good dish. I still have to play with it.  

I lowered butter to about 1.5 tbsp, used 1 leek instead of green onions and crimini mushrooms.  

I was a little weirded out by chicken boullion so I used just a little, skipped the almonds and the corn starch, and threw the cooked cauliflower into the pot with the browned mushrooms and leeks.  

Served on the side of turkey blue cheese burgers (from this site) for a great low carb meal.

This is nice, but the bouillion makes it way too salty.  I cooked my cauliflower in the microwave on high for 6 minutes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  If I make it again, I would substitute low sodium canned broth, probably vegetable broth, and use chopped sweet onion in place of the green onions (regular onions leave a bad taste in my mouth). I probably will make this again, because I've been wanting a good way to fix cauliflower.

I used olive oil, and chicken stock.  But I thought that this recipe was wonderful.  I added some garlic salt, and peprika, and I also sprinkled a little bit of parm cheese on top. My friends and children loved it! I will make this again!

The dish is great if you have cauliflower and mushrooms in your refrigerator and you don't know what to do with them. I made this dish according to recipie and it turned out fine, but it lacked  in taste somehow, so we didn't care too much about it. It went good with meat dish we had along. I made it second time hoping it would turn out better but it was same. I also added a small amount of cumin to add some taste to it the second time. But apparently this dish needs something else or some more spices for the right combination.

This was sooo good! I'm always looking for good ways to make cauliflower, and this was wonderful. Even my sons loved it and they would normally never touch cauliflower. I'll definitely be making this on a regular basis.

Delicious as is! It is now my BASIC cauliflower recipe. I have tried others' ideas and just recently, cooked some chopped bacon then proceeded as usual with the mushrooms etc. WOW !  Also, I've added leftover veg like brussel sprouts, peas. Thanks for a great recipe.

Sorry I didn't care for this recipe, it had no flavor. I would have rather just steamed the vegies. Thanks anyways!

I didn't have mushrooms, so left them out.  I used half the bouillon and much less butter.  It turned out just great.  I'll try it with the mushrooms next time.

I used canned mushrooms and regular sliced onions since that's what I had on hand and they worked fine.  Also, I only had one teaspoon of chicken bouillon and that was enough.  My husband, who is "so-so" about cauliflower gave this a "just ok" rating, but I, who loves cauliflower, thought is was great!   The slivered almonds added a very nice finish. I would make again - for myself!

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't feel it was too salty or that it had too much butter.  I thought the mushrooms were especially tasty and was disappointed whenever my forkful only had cauliflower.  So next time, I will double the mushrooms.  I thought there was room for more almonds as well, so next time I will just toss in the entire 1/2 cup package.  The recipe was nice on its own, but it was even better when I put it on top of the leftover Ranch mashed potatoes that I had.

I'm on a veggie tour so for my first recipe I chose this and oh boy am I glad! I steamed my head of cauliflower and used chicken stock; the whole thing thickened up nicely. My wife remained silent for awhile and I asked what she thought... oh yeah - she really, really loved it (she requested a cauliflower recipe and Cauliflower Supreme delivered!)

I added a bit more water to give it more sauce then i put a layer of cooked ground beef, the cauliflower and this sauce over it and it made a great tasting casserole.  It looked ugly so topped it with a bit of cheese to melt, but my family enjoyed the taste!

Loved how easily this all went together.  I haven't eaten it yet though.  However I am salivating to try it (I'm waiting for DH to come home).  I did taste the sauce and it was not lacking flavor as the last rater said...so I'm really excited!

So good and easy! I just microwaved the cauliflower and used margarine and veggie boullion because we are vegetarians. You definitely donâ€™t need to use that much butter. I used 1/3 cup and could prob even use less. Of course I did add a lot of garlic and parkway. This is a keeper!

To me, what does 2 teas spoons of chicken broth have to do making this a great recipe. Instead of water, I used chicken broth, to add flavor.  Also added 1 TBS of garlic..  It turned out good, and will keep for future

Everyone really liked this-even my kids.  I'll defiantly make it again.  (I did make two changes- I just pine nuts instead of almonds and I used half the butter.  There was plenty of sauce.)

I made it as written and found it lacking flavor, but I love cauliflower and mushrooms. I usually prepare them with other flavors as well so I made this once again omitting the chicken broth and replaced it with a can of cream of celery soup and topped the dish with shredded cheddar. I liked that version better.

This was very good.  I used low-sodium chicken broth, flour instead of corn starch as a thickener and, like one other person, used leeks instead of green onion just as a personal preference.

Too much butter (would add 1/2 the amount next time). I added extra vegetable to time down the butter and also added a 1/2 cup of cedar cheese and Parmesan when mixing all together.

This is a wonderful recipe you can use as a starting point. You can always change a few bits and pieces according to your taste. I almost never fallow a recipe by the book. This one is a wonderful idea. You can always add the herbs and spices you like, you us have to use some immagination and to ove cooking. Well done to the person who posted this.

Good side dish or meatless main.  A little heavy on the butter though, so I would probably half it next time.  Also seasoned with a little curry powder.  Delicious combination of flavors.
