I made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  The pineapple taste is very refreshing.  I served it right along-side ordinary pecan pie and it wasn't redundant at all.  I added about 1/3 more pineapple than called for, it's tastier that way.  Yummy!

This is one of the most delicious pies -  Just wonderful.  I used a 10" deep dish pie plate because the filling was spilling over a 9".  Also - I served the pie COLD.  In my opinion, this is a must.    FANTASTIC!  THANKS FOR THIS KEEPER.

This pie was FANTASTIC!!The pineapple was a great twist on the traditional pecan pie. I added about 3/4 cup of pineapple- but next time I would cook it a bit longer, and make sure I drain the pineapple VERY WELL. I just drained it in the can this time, and it came out a bit runny in the middle. Everyone ate it anyway because it tasted wonderful- and I already have requests to make it for Thanksgiving!

This was so delicious! It is now in my husband's top five desserts. I followed the measurements exactly, however, I had way too much pie filling, so I took two crusts and split the filling between the two. It made a nice size piece of pie, and I was able to put one in the freezer for later. Such a yummy pie!

I didn't get to eat a bite of this but took it to a church luncheon and the cooks said that it disappeared so fast they didn't get any either.  Must have been good! I plan to make another soon. Some other reviews mentioned that the top poured over the pecans was too much for a 9 inch pie and it was.  I will cut that in half next time.

Was a bit nervous making this one just because of the combination, but it was fantastic. Followed the recipe to the letter (like I always do for the first time) and I wont change a thing. Thank You Carolyn!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. My mother in law referred to it as a "custard' like flavor with pineapple and pecan pie on top. Don't waste your pecans on this one and just make a regular pecan pie instead.

Very good! The flavors are wonderful. I have made this several times, and the only problem I had was that it is enough for two pies. It also had to cook a bit longer as well.

Delish!!!  My grandmother used to make this pie at Christmas every year.  I have been looking for a recipe that got close to it forever. This hit the nail on the head.  Just as I remembered.

I made this ahead of the 4th of July to take into work. Was looking for something new to make and was craving pineapple. Turned out delicious, though the way I made it seems to have turned out slightly differently than intended. I didnt do as many pecans, instead laying spiraling rings of pecans for style on the top. When I added the glaze/topping most of it just sank into the rest of the pie mix (although I made sure to get all the pecans coated). End result was a delicious pie. Next time I make it I'll do a thicker layer of chopped pecans and see if the coating actually 'floats' on the top or sinks then as well.

I made this last year right before Thanksgiving and it turned out we loved it! I agree it makes a lot and yes, it is "custard like" but that is the beauty of it. Even my hard core pecan pie loving husband asked for more. Will be making this along with traditional pecan pie again this year.

I love this variation of a pecan pie and am asked to make it every Thanksgiving.  To me, it isn't as sweet as a traditional pecan pie , which appeals to me and the pineapple adds a brightness to the recipe.  People always ask me for the recipe.  It's a keeper to add to the pumpkin, pecan pie party gala.

I've been making this pie every Thanksgiving now for 3 years! I'm not allowed to show up without it now :) Everyone who likes/loves pecan pie actually prefers this version because of how refreshing the pineapple is compared to how overly sweet regular pecan pie can be. Just don't forget to drain the pineapple!
