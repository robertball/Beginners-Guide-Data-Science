First time I have ever cooked dried beans n the IP. The bag of dried beans was slightly more than the recipe called for and I used all of them, upped the liquid to keep proper ratio and did without the pasta. This was very tasty and filling.

I used thick bacon and tripled the amount.I also added zucchini from my garden so use whatever you have . The recipe says to make the pasta 1st but there is no reason to. when served I used parmesan cheese and green onions. Oh and a few pepper flakes during cooking.
