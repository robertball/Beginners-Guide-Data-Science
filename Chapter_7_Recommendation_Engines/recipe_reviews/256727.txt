I made this on the stove top in a dutch oven. I make tagine quite often as my husband spent his childhood in Morocco and both of us found this very good. The fennel is unusual in tagine which is why the recipe intrigued me.

This was excellent. I did add a bit of cilantro and that seemed to add to it.

Made this today and it was very good. I did marinade the chicken all day so it would be more flavorful.

This was excellent and authentic. Very lovely and full of flavour. Relatively easy to get good results if you follow the directions. Served it with couscous and a mint-cucumber salad. Thank you so much for this recipe. It was a great way to break in my tagine.

We served the (red) Harissa separately at the table and were careful with the Cayenne (we're Dutch). In stead of couscous we ate wholewheat pittabread with Humous. It was a great meal!

I made some modifications, making it less spicy to accommodate a guest with a nursing infant and added breasts as well as thighs. Turned out amazing! The best part is how the breast was as tender as the thigh meat. The preserved lemon was a must, so if you can’t find it in the store you should make your own. There’s a recipe in this app that I used, was super easy.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the flavor of this dish. It really is very interesting. The recipe is a bit laborious.  I ended up putting it in the oven (my tagine doesn't have a diffuser for the stove-top) at 200°C for about 40 minutes. I used chicken breasts instead of dark meat. Thank you for the recipe.
