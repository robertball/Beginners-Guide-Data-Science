The submitter was right, these should come with a warning: "Highly Addictive"! These were awesome! And they're perfect for when you want french fries withou the "fry"! I added a bit of dried crushed rosemary to the mix and since I didn't have fresh parsley I had to substitute a bit of dried. These smelled great in the oven and tasted even better! When finished I seasoned them with  Parmesan and instead of the seasoned salt I opted for a bit of sea salt. These were the perfect side dish for grilled burgers! Thanks for a great recipe Sarah! One I'm sure we'll make again and again...

Very yummy!  Turned out better the second time than the first because I had to play with the timing somewhat to keep the garlic and parmesan from over-toasting.  I found 25 minutes on the first time in the over and 7 the second time worked perfect.

these were a big hit!!! yumm!! I did not have any garlic so I substituted garlic powder instead & they still turned out very tasty!! I also had to use dried parsley instead of fresh & kraft parmesan cheese but these french fries were very good!!! I will be making them again :)

VERY yummy, though I tried it with red potatoes and mine didn't turn out crispy. I'll have to try it again with russets :) My hubby DEF wants me to make them again!

Make sure to soak the potatoes in salted water for an hour or so for a crispier potato. Soaking allows some of the starches leech out into the water. The starch in potatoes hinders moisture from escaping, which leaves more water in the potato. Make sure to rinse the potatoes well after soaking (to remove the starch) and pat them completely dry before cooking.

We didn't feel like having seasoned fries with our burgers so I just added some freshly ground salt and a dash of garlic powder. They were AMAZING! I've tried doing homemade fries before and mine have never turned out but these cooked perfectly with these directions. The first time I made them I shortened the baking time a bit because I was only using 2 potatoes. So great, I'll never go back to the frozen ones. Thank you so much!!

These were sooooo good. My picky kids and husband couldn't get enough. I didn't even have any leftovers. Nice and golden and crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside. Will make again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly, hoping for a knock em dead french fry recipe that would blow my socks off.  After reading all the reviews I was so psyched to try these.  Call me lazy, but they were an awful lot of work for a less than spectacular result.  I'll stick with my regular roasted potato recipes that are a LOT less labor intensive -all that chopping, turning, recoating... jeesh

Used small white potatoes because that is what I had - cut in half and then into slices - were probaly bigger than 1/4 inch but timing was about the same - didnt really measure, just by sight - were excellent - a nice change up on potato side dishes (since we eat them as sides like every day) - I do not eve like parm cheese and I still found them awesome

These were very good and crunchy.  I used sea salt and did not think it needed more salt.

These were very good! I followed the recipe but I did add a little more season salt after I took them out of the oven. I really liked the parmesan, parsley and garlic combination on fries. Thanks for the recipe Sarah!

My mom is a garlic freak and loved these.  I would like to try them with yukon gold potatoes which are my favorite: not a fan of russet.

Very good, Sarah. I'm a Seattle girl so I used good ol' Johnny's Seasoning Salt and because I did not have fresh parsley, I used dried. I did add more Johnny's than what was called for (to taste really, 1/2 teaspoon total wasn't quite enough) and I think next time, I might add in more garlic and a little onion powder, but that's really just a personal choice. My two sons and husband really liked these. I served them with homemade hot special sauce and the boys ate the snot out of these. This really wasn't any harder than opening a package of frozen fries, IMO and you get a much tastier result.

I can't even remember what seasonings I used, but I loved these.  Putting them in the oil twice I think is what makes these more french-fry-ier than other oven baked fries.  A keeper!  UPDATE: Just made these again - cut them home fry style (bite-size hunks), mixed in with onion chunks, and seasoned with steak seasoning.  Excellent once again.  Slight cooking change -  I cooked 20 min, tossed potatoes in oil bowl, spread potatoes back out in pan and cooked another 20-25 minutes (no flipping taters in oven and it still worked like a charm).  This is how I'll always cook oven fried potatoes from now on - thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  My entire family enjoyed these!  I will be making them again.  I did use a lot less olive oil and a cut back on cheese, and they turned out perfectly for our taste.

I had a craving for garlic-parm fries, but due to all the kids being sick with a cold, haven't been to the store in 2 weeks so my pantry was slim and I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I had to sub garlic powder and dried parsley for the fresh and I only had grated Romano cheese, no parm. Otherwise, I followed this as written. Even though I had to improvise a few of the ingredients, these came out tasting superb. I can't wait to make them again once I do have everything called for.

The trick to crispy fries - after you cut them, dry them individually with a tea towel befor putting them in the bowl and adding the oil. More oil will stick and they will be less soggy!

I heated the sheet pan while preheating the oven then sprayed with Misto before adding potatoes. Cut rounds for ease of flipping. Out of thyme so skipped. Pecorino instead and garlic powder instead. Dd approved which means I'll be making again soon.

I make this very often, and we love it.  I use oregano instead of thyme.  Goes with everything! Yummy and not overly fattening/oily.  Good job!

These are great baked fries though be sure not to cut them too thin.  Mine fell apart a bit when tossing them and they ended up being somewhat mushy instead of crisp.  They still tasted very good though.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh and slightly reduced the Parmesan cheese.

Really good. Loved these with Seasoned turkey Burgers also from this site. I modified them dramatically by using frozen fries, but I used all of the seasonings and the oil and cheese..Same concept.Very good outcome.

These tasted amazing, but were a little soggy for my liking. They needed 5-10 minutes extra in the oven (I made them again.) to give them a nice crisp texture.

Amazing! Never thought such plain flavours would combine so well and make the best potatoes I have had in a long time.

Served these to a group of friends this weekend and everyone loved them.    Followed the basic recipe with a few changes because of what I had on hand.  Used garlic powder, dried parsley, and jarred Parmesan cheese instead of fresh products...it was quicker and the taste was still really good.

Did not have a non-stick sheet pan, lined one with a Silpat and the other with parchment paper.  Parchment is the quicker way to go...no clean up.

The main change I made was to NOT return the fries to the bowl and the olive oil after 15 min.  They still had plenty of oil and were browning nicely.  

I also changed the cooking time/order a bit out of necessity.  I wanted the potatoes to be ready when the burgers came off the grill.  So I pulled the pans after the 30 min cook and sat them aside.  Then just before I was ready to serve them I sprinkled with the seasoned salt and parmesan and put them back in the hot oven for the last 10 min.

I don't know what I did wrong here, but they turned out mushy and greasy, and I followed the recipe pretty closely.  The overall flavor was wonderful, but I think if I made these again, I'd use less oil and less cheese (or more potatoes), cut the potatoes into larger wedges and bake longer, and DEFINITELY use parchment paper when baking.

Very delicious! I made a lot of these layered on top of each other in a pan. Not crunchy, but still great flavor. I want to try spreading them out too.

Very good fries.  I don't think I used enough oil the first time, since I had no oil left in the bowl after spreading out the fries, but I just added a bit more later.  I baked them a bit longer--baked on one side for the 30 mins, flipped and baked for another 10, then added the oil and parmesan.  Worked out perfectly for me, since I prefer crispier fries.  Very easy, and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

For some reason weren't huge fans of these. Maybe I'll try them again later but they seemed a little too oily for my taste. Will definitely lower the amount of oil the next time around.

I made these with sweet potatoes as they were on sale.  I also did not have any Parmesan cheese, but they were still wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will be using this one again soon.

Made these as a side dish for burgers, but they could be used on many other entrees. Will use a Ziplock bag for tossing next time and save a dirty dish. Very tasty and much healthier than other fry recipes we have tried.

The flavor was mundane, and the fries came out soggy mush. I could modify this recipe to make it work though. To fix this, first i would deep fry them. When done I would sprinkle garlic POWDER on them, then the other ingredients, minus the oil.

The fries stuck to the cookie sheet so bad that they were like mashed potatoes. My family inhaled them within 5 minutes so yes they are good.

Yum!  This is my second time fixing these in a week...they are absolutely delicious, and there haven't been ANY fries left either time!  I used sea salt instead of seasoned salt, and I added 5 fresh garlic cloves and a little more salt.  Perfect!  Yes, they are more work than opening a bag of Ore Ida fries, but they are so worth the effort.  These taste like garlic fries from one of my favorite Baltimore restaurants.  Thank you for posting your wonderful recipe!

I really liked this a lot.  I used red potatoes and just sliced them up I did not bother with cutting them like fries.  VERY good will make again.  This is one of those easy recipes that you just keep in the back of your head.  i will not need to refer back to the actual recipe.  I love those recipes!

I added garlic powder instead of fresh, spicy italian herb grinder, chile powder, and some spicy poultry rub mix. Also used basil oil (and enough just to coat). I used red potatoes and they came out very crispy. So yummy! My husband said they were better than the bag fries we usually cook.

Amazing fries! I used Garlic Powder and they still came out great. Only change I made was I used the Broiler a little to Brown the fries in the end and to help melt the cheese a little faster. I will make these again soon. Suggest a french fry cutter because you are going to want to make extra!

The flavor was delicious, but 30 minutes at 425 F burned the fries and the garlic!

These fries are awesome! I made a combo of yellow, red, and sweet potatoes and the whole family just loved them. It has quickly become a regular side dish in our house. Please note... if you use sweet potato, place them on a separate baking sheet because they tend to cook faster than the regular potatoes. I also added a little garlic powder since I was out of fresh garlic. De-lish!

Yummy!  Will use less oil next time.  I added Old Bay seasoning to the parm both times.  Gave it that little extra something.  Forgot to turn the fries during cooking and it didn't matter.  I'll probably make these at least once a week from now on.

These are very easy to make and tasty.  They made the house smell delicious.  One thing is that it makes A LOT of fries, so I would scale back the recipe.  Seems like it made more than 4 servings.

I added some McCormick Perfect Pinch Parmesan Herb season after they were done cooking. That may be a little redundant for some but it took it over the top for me!

Usually I need more garlic, but this recipe doesn't need 3 cloves. Next time I will try powdered garlic. The last ten minutes were unneeded. It does need the powdered parm during the bake time, but you could use shredded to melt at the end.

I made this with dinner, turned out really good!  My wife couldn't stop eating them!  I followed the recipe exactly although it seemed as though they weren't getting done in the amount of time stated so I just turned on the broiler for a few minutes at the end.  I will definitely be making these again.

They were pretty good however I added more seasoning salt  for flavor and put the oven on broil afterwards so I could make them crisper.

used a mandolin to make thick shoestrings, but still too thin.  Next time will cut by hand.   Nice and crispy.

These are by far the very best oven fries I've ever had!!!!  I would even go so far as to say I like them better than regular french fries.  Once you eat one, you're hooked.  My picky great granddaughter even loves them so that's saying a lot.

These are really close to the garlic cheese fries we get at the stadium. The only thing I added was more garlic (our family loves garlic). Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I skipped the Parmesan cheese and this recipe was delicious even without it! I checked the fries halfway through cooking and decided to bump the oven temp up to 450, finished them perfectly.

Baked longer than the recipe stated, but I could not get the fries done.  We all tried them anyway, and none of us liked them.  Surprisingly, they had no flavor.

Good recipe! I didn't have seasoned salt so I used Himalayan pink salt turned out great!  Also only had organic potatoes which are half the size of GMO potatoes, so used 2 organic in place of one regular. Nice and garlicky yum!

These were good, my husband enjoyed them.  I made exactly as written with four russet potatoes, except I substituted dried parsley for fresh.  I thought they were still somewhat mushy though.  Next time I will try turning on the broiler for a few minutes at the end of cooking.

These were great!!!!! I made just as the recipe called for (except not exact  measurements b/c I cook/ bake off hand) AND THESE WERE AMAZING HUBBY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH.  By the time dinner was ready, I had to cook a whole new batch of fries b/c he snuck in the kitchen and ate them all.

Will Definitely be making these again!

I made these fries tonight...because I was craving fries and didn't want to go out in the snow. I made them a little different...i had to use what I had.  I seasoned with garlic, onion,  and sea salt.  I cooked them for 30 min.  then added more olive oil,  cheese, and salt...then I cooked for another 10 min.  these fries were delicious!!!! I'm so glad I found this recipe. I will be making again.

Before I ate them I thought they smelled incredible, but when I tasted them, they were amazing.   I had them with a hamburger and that was a good combination.  But don't use catsup.  That would drown out the flavor.

Perfect texture and robust flavor with the minced garlic. Subbed rosemary for the parsley, and omitted the parmesan since we are eating Whole30 style lately.... great side with our brisket!

The spices and garlic didn't add much flavor to the fries. They were browned but that is not the same as being crisp.

My fries had good flavor, but they were soooo greasy. The flipping and reseasoning and cooking some more was annoying; and an hour to produce these fries makes them impractical during the work/school week. I will keep looking, but thank you for sharing!

I used 1 large russet potato and cut it into rounds.  After cutting the potato, I put the potato in cold water and let it sit for 15 minutes.  After the 15 minutes, I dried the potatoes thoroughly.  I then mixed 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/2 tsp salt and 2 cloves of garlic.  I followed the recipe as written for the rest, except I only used 2 tbs of parmasean and 1/4 tsp of salt for the final step.

I was out of Parmesan, and these were great even without it.  I cut my fries very thin, and they only took about 25 minutes to cook.  My husband said these are his new favorite potato side dish.

Nothing not to like about these fries, they were great.  Mine were perfectly cooked at 40 minutes.

Excellent! These were loved by all.  My kids love anything with Parmesan cheese.  I waited until the very end to add the seasoning and cheese mixture, cuz I was afraid it would burn cooking it for over 30 minutes.  Mine took a little longer to cook (about 40-45 min).  I also used parchment paper so they could not stick to the pan.  Then once the fries were good and crispy, I added the cheese and seasoning mixture, and cooked about another 7-8 minutes.  They were perfect.

These were fantastic!  I didn't find the method to be too overly time consuming.  I used russet and sweet potatoes...the sweet potatoes were the best I've had from the oven.  Really good!!

These were so yummy! I substituted a little oregano for the thyme and used a decent sprinkle of dried parsley instead of fresh. I added garlic salt too. I also left them in the oven a couple minutes longer to get a nice crisp (but I have an older oven). Thanks for the recipe!!

Everyone in my family LOVED these!  I didn't have dried thyme or fresh parsley on hand.  Used 1/2 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning instead - delicious!
