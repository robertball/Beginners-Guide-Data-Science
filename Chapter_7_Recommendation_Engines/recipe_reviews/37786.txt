Rich, creamy.  Served this Christmas Eve and one guest said it was absolutely the best cheesecake he had ever eaten.  Everyone raved about it.

The cheesecake turned out perfect. I think adding more rum would make it even better.

I am surprised that I have not written a review of this recipe in the past.  This is my go to, Christmas Cheesecake Recipe!!  I am the cheesecake maker among my friends and family, and I certainly think that this is one of, if not THE best of all of the recipes that I have come across.  If you are not an eggnog lover, then don't add the rum, or the Nutmeg, and flavor this with something else.  However if you are not adding anything liquid (like rum) please don't add the flour either as that is a counter measure.  You can certainly add more Rum, but if you do, be sure to add equal amount of Rum and Flour to counter balance each other.  I have been making this same recipe for about 10 years now, and have never heard anyone have a bad word to say about it.  Everyone loves it!!  Definitely a keeper, and a favorite at Christmas time in our family!!  I skip the Cool Whip and nutmeg on top, as I like my cheesecake naked!  ;)
