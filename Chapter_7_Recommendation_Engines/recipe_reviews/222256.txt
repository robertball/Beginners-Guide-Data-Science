Recipe submitter here, I didn't realize the recipe had been published until just now!  I think AllRecipes tinkered with my recipe a bit.  A few thoughts from me: 1/2 C oil is more than you will probably need, 1/4 to 1/3 C is more like it.  Also, this may sound obvious, but a good way to tell if you've used enough salt and pepper is just to taste one of the veggie slices!  For cooking times, things like onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper need more time on the grill.  Zucchini needs less time, and the tomatoes even less- you just want the outsides to blister.  For prep, fewer of your veggie pieces will fall through the grate of the grill if you cut them properly.  Slice the bell pepper into long, wide pieces (so maybe just 6 pieces from an entire bell pepper) and cut the zucchini at a 45 degree angle so you have large slices.  Lay them on the grill so the length of the bell pepper slices and zucchini slices are perpendicular to the grate.  You may lose some of the pieces, but not as many!  I would honestly avoid grilling the veggies in a foil packet because they'll end up steamed, which is much less tasty.  Last of all, veggies like asparagus and even broccoli are wonderful grilled.  Try whatever you can think of.  Good luck and happy grilling :)

This is a great way to cook vegetables however, it is less messy and still tastes great if you put everything in foil wrap tight and then place on the grill

Simple is right....this is the way I always love to do my veggies in the warmer months. Last night I grilled red peppers, yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms and tomatoes. Good quality olive oil, sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. Delicious! And I love to make enough for leftovers to make veggie sandwiches or to chop up and throw in a frittata. The ideas are endless for the leftovers. Delicious and thanks!

Made these today on the charcoal grill...added some scallions, mushrooms and greeen peppers with zucchini & yellow squash..tasted great, but the peppers weren't cooked enough & the zucchini was too well done...not the fault of the recipe though...I also added a little fresh rosemary with the oil, salt & pepper and marinated about 30 minutes...I liked this alot!

I have made a variation of this recipe for years, and is a family favorite for even those who don't like zucchini. I use a yellow crook neck squash instead of one of the zucchini, and use orange bell pepper, as that is what we prefer. I use a grill basket with a basket weave lid, chop all veggies into about 3/4" pieces, and toss them into the basket after tossing them with fresh garlic, olive oil, and Spicy Steak Seasoning (The loose herbs in the jar, NOT steak sauce). I place the basket on the grill and shake and flip every 5 minutes or so. The flavor is incredible. If you use a foil packet, all you are doing is steaming the vegetables. A superb way to add extra flavor to veggies.

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy.  I have made this many times and it's always so delicious.
Actually I have cooked this on the stove, as I don't use my grill much any more...I'm  a recent widow :( . It just makes any main dish more interesting, fun Thanks

Very tasty. I do not use foil as I react badly to it. Many of my friends prefer the veg to be cooked without any foil. Will make again

I don't like grilled or cooked tomatoes so will use red bell pepper plus thinly sliced carrots and some potatoes also.

I never knew grilled veggies could be so easy and delicious.  The only thing I did different was add a little garlic powder before grilling the veggies.  I used a pastry brush to get the olive oil evenly and lightly on each veggie.  I didn't cut the vegetables small, I cut the peppers in quarters, the zucchini were 3 inch long wedges, etc. I was afraid of losing the veggies on my grill and by doing so; I didn't lose any.  Will definitely make again.

I added broccoli and used thick-sliced crimini mushrooms instead of the button mushrooms specified because that's what I had on hand. In addition I added a little garlic powder and red pepper flakes before grilling. And I sprinkled on a little lemon juice and Parmesan cheese after grilling.
My food critic (wife) and I both loved it, but I gave it four stars because the recipe itself describes only the obvious things you do to grill vegetables, i.e. there's nothing innovative or non-obvious about it.

Like other folks, Best thing about this recipe is the simplicity. I did zucchini, yellow squash, and onions. And the only thing I would suggest is put the onions on first and let them get some softening because they were a little crunchy other than that perfect love this recipe.

Great build-on recipe or simple as-is. If you'd use meat marinate it separately to avoid cross contamination.
