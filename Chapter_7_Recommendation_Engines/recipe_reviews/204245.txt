This Chinese Chicken Wings recipe was amazing! I am Chinese myself and so is my 12 year old daughter. This recipe was very easy to make. It was so easy my daughter made is all by herself. I recommend this recipe for anyone.

The sauce burned and there wasn't a lot of flavor.

Everything good chicken wings should be : tender, moist, flavorful and addictive.  I marinated the wings for 48 hours.  Although baking times may vary mine were done with 7 minutes to spare and they were fall off the bone pure goodness. I garnished the wings with chopped Chinese parsley.

"Chinese" is kind of a misnomer for these wings. "Soy sauce wings" would be more accurate.  I'm the sort of person who will salt something before I've even tried it because I know it won't be salty enough, and I found these too salty. With the recipe's ratios, the orange juice and other spices are completely masked by an overwhelming taste of soy. I would suggest swapping the two ratios, putting two cups of orange juice in for every cup of soy sauce, and maybe adding some brown sugar or honey.

The flavors were great.  I precooked the wings for 15 minutes to assure they were done well.  Then, I did the marinade overnight.  The balance of the baking was good, but they tended to stick to the foil lined pan.  I would make these again.
