I was skeptical about making this recipe because of the mixed reviews, but I decided to try it and boy am I glad I did. One tip to help eliminate sticking: Get a cold stick of butter and press it into to bottom and sides of your baking dish, making a slightly thick layer of butter. THEN put the bread and mixture in. In the morning, use a flexible spatula and gently insert it underneath the bread to pull it away from the pan. This should definitely minimize any sticking. I always bake my own bread (Amish White Bread submitted by Peg on this site). I then cut it into 1.5 to 1.75 inch thick slices to ensure that all the mixture is absorbed, so make sure you use THICK BREAD. I then cut each slice into four and make French Toast Sticks so that they can be eaten on the run (in the car, at a bus stop, etc). They reheat very well. The recipe I use is as follows: 3 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup cream, 1t Vanilla extract, 1.5t cinnamon, 1T powdered sugar, 3/4 loaf bread. I beat these ingredients well with a mixer.I top it with a heated mixture of 5T butter, 1.5T syrup, and 1/5 cup brown sugar. Don't be dismayed by negative reviews. This recipe CAN and DOES turn out great every time. Follow it as stated in the recipe, and then tweak it like I did until you find what works best for you and your family. This is a staple in our house now. Bake time of 40 minutes is usually dead on (sometimes I go an extra 5 minutes or so). Moist (NOT soggy), tasty, and (if you make sticks) travel friendly.

I decided to give this recipe a second chance with some modifications to make it a much firmer recipe.  I took my loaf of French bread and split it down the middle lengthwise and then cut it into 1 inch slices.  I omitted the half-and-half, used three eggs and halved the remaining ingredients.  All ingredients (except for the topping) went into a big bowl and I mixed them up until all the liquid was soaked up.  After spraying the casserole dish with a cooking spray, the bread was placed in a single layer and the topping was placed on top.  I only cooked the dish for about 30 minutes.  It made about 5 servings this way.  Using this method the recipe is more like sticky rolls than French toast.  Delicious.

My husband is LOVING this dish! He is saying "mmmmm 5, mmmmmmm 5"! Since there are only three of us here today I pulled 6 pieces of Texas Toast out of the freezer. I sprayed the glass pan with Pam, whipped up the egg mixture with 1/2 cup of half and half and 1 cup of milk only. I just put the toast, whole, in the pan. This way, there were two whole pieces for each of us. After placing the dunked pieces in the pan, I sprinkled cinnamon over top. Then I poured the remaining egg mixture over top. This morning, when I pulled the dish out of the fridge it appeared that all of the egg mixture had been absorbed. By the way, I had only put chopped pecans over two pieces of the toast, since hubby is the only one that likes them for breakfast. I didn't have maple syrup so I just used some Aunt Jemima Butter Lite. I baked this for right at 40 minutes and my oven runs hot, so if you have a new oven you might need to go 45 - 50 minutes. As for the finished product, hubby loves it. Naturally, the edges of the toast got done faster than the middle. I think it is crucial to let this sit for the 5 minutes after bake time. I wonder if cutting the amount of butter down a bit would help? It was just a tad soggier in the middle, but overall, this is a wonderful recipe! Next time I will sprinkle powdered sugar over top.

This made our Christmas morning...it was the perfect breakfast to celebrate the holiday.  I used day old french bread from a local bakery and I took other reviewers advice and cut down on the milk to a 1/2 cup.  I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg wash and used pure maple syrup to top it off!

I make this regularly, recipe compliments of Rhona and Leo Lococco of Lococco House B&B in St. Charles, MO - what brings it to life for me is 1 tblsp of concentrated OJ in lieu of the vanilla.  MMM...

i'm wondering if debbie intended to write that we should cut the french bread in 1 inch SLICES and not cubes.  anyway, that's what i did.  u definitely need to lightly grease the pan.  i thought i could get away with just laying foil in the pan, but it ended up becoming a second skin and took forever to peel off.  won't be making that mistake again.  i only had 1/2 cup of pecan chips, so that's all i used, but it really was more than enough.  i doubt i'll be using 1 cup when i make this again.  we're fasting during this month of ramadan and i made this for my hubby and myself for our pre-dawn meal.  it was worth getting up early for!

I was so worried that I would have soggy results, and I almost lost sleep over it, but woke up the next morning, made the sauce, and threw it in the oven... and it came out perfectly... (well one peice of toast stuck to the dish) served it to to a house full of visitors and they all raved... thank you so much!

Lots of reviewers are complaining about this recipe being soggy, but nothing in the recipe says to pour all the remaining liquid over the bread. It just says to dip the bread in liquid. I'm sure it would have been like soup if I had poured all the liquid in the pan. I thought the consistency was great--crispy on the outside, but more like bread pudding on the outside, with a caramel sauce. This is the best french toast recipe I have tried.

My family really enjoyed this recipe on Thanksgiving morning, and I enjoyed not having to spend time cooking breakfast.  Those who do not care for nuts did not care for this though.  It was not soggy at all which I really liked.

This is delicious! My four kids and hubby loved it. I made it for their first day of school, and it started their day our wonderfully. I did add cinnamon to the egg mixture, as I love it. Then I sprinkled a little on the bread before refrigerating it. Delicious!

I made this for Father's Day brunch. I was skeptical too about reading the reviews that the ingredients would stick to the pan. So, I used a glass pyrex 13x19 pan and sprayed the bottom and sides with Mazola cooking spray and then took softened butter and spread a little of that on the botttom and sides as and extra cautionery step. I only put the topping on the bread, as there wasn't enough to let it drip down the sides so that probably worked better and helped with the non-sticking. I did take someone's advice and lifted up the bread the next morning before baking. Nothing stuck - it worked fine.    I followed all the directions and had no issues.  It turned out delicious and was loved by all. I will make this again.

I used only 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 cup milk (as others have suggested) I also added a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  I used challah bread instead of French bread. This was delicious and a big hit at my brunch. I was careful to grease the pan well and not overlap the bread and didn't have any problems with the toast sticking. With the reduced milk and sugar, it was neither too soggy nor too sticky.  Two thumbs up! I will definitely make this again.

Great! We had company over the day after Thanksgiving and everyone just loved it! I used Heavy Whip Cream instead of Half & Half. and I made some with Pecans and some with out. I used 2 9x13 pans single layer. Next time I will try using Cookie Sheets so I can get more on the tray. I could of used a whole loaf of french bread, I had lots of egg mixture left. I am sending 2 pictures of what it looked like. I true HIT!

After reading all the reviews I made a few changes to the recipe and was very pleased with the results.  I used 2 cups of half & half instead of the 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1 cup of half & half.  I cubed the bread and mixed the bread in with the egg,vanilla,half & half mixture before placing it in the baking dish.  I only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar with the butter, maple syrup.  It was not soggy nor to sweet.  I will certainly make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Debbie and also to those who reviewed it.

I have been on a "quest" for the best overnight french toast recipe and I have finally found this one!  Really easy and very tasty.  One of the simplest recipes of this type I have found.  I am going to toss all of my other recipes and use this one.

This turned out great!  Although I did make a few changes, since after reading some of the reviews about it being to soggy and sticking to the pan.  I sliced the loaf of day old French bread thick;  about 1.5 inch slices.  Used skim milk and only half the amount of half and half.  Additionally, I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture.  I dipped each piece of bread in the mix and poured the remaining in the pan.  

The next morning, all of the liquid had been absorbed by the bread.  I flipped each slice over, and sprayed Pam underneath it and spooned the pecan topping mixture over it.  I baked it covered for 20 minutes at 350, then removed the foil and baked for another 30 minutes uncovered.  I had no issues with sogginess or stickiness.  Dusted with powdered sugar after letting it sit for 5 minutes. 

The flavor was great, very sweet, and the crunchiness of the pecans was awesome. Paired with home style potatoes and mimosas this made a great brunch!!  Will definitely make again!

Made it for Easter brunch & it was a hit.   I made a few modifications:   1)  reduced half & half to 1/2 cup, not 1 cup 2)  reduced brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  It was still very sweet ....  next time I'll reduce it to 2/3 cup.     3)  I did not dip the bread slices, instead I poured the egg mixture over the bread.  
4)  I did spray the pan with PAM before adding the bread and I did flip the bread the before baking.  I did not have problems with sticking.   I prepared this at 7:00 pm, but wasn't planning to bake until noon the next day.    I was concerned it would be too long, but it was fine.

so disappointed with this recipe. made it for the first time today hoping for a nice Easter breakfast and the middle of the bread slices were soggy (despite 40 min in the over) and had little to no flavor. should have know when I had so much extra egg batter and nut mixture. will not make again.

This recipe was a delightful surprise!  I've tried so many "make it the night before" french toast recipes, that I just assumed it would be similar.  This was SUPER!!!!  It reminds me of the old caramel pecan rolls I used to get at my favorite bakery.  I didn't have any special bread - just used plain old white and it was perfect!  Thank you!

Great recipe!  You might think that there's not too much there when you first pour it in the pan, but it really plumps up when you start cooking it.

Is it possible to ruin this??  I didn't have Texas toast, so I layered 2 slices of whole wheat bread.  I didn't have half & half, so I substitued buttermilk.  I forgot to add the milk in the mixture for the first few pieces, so they soaked up a lot of the egg, and the remaining pieces were VERY milky.  I used a little non-stick spray because it was almost gone.  It was FABULOUS!!!  No sticking, not soggy--perfect!  This will be a weekend staple in our house!

The pictures shown do not do this recipe justice.
The only modification I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the egg mixture.
This recipe is SO YUMMY! Did I mention...THIS RECIPE IS SO YUMMY AND SO EASY!

YUM-O!  I made this for our Christmas brunch, and it was by far the favorite dish!  Guests were talking about it several days later!!!  I did make some adjustments:  I used the whole loaf of French bread, instead of half - all of the other ingredients remained the same EXCEPT that I added cinnamon to the egg bath and sprinkled a little more on the bread prior to baking.    I did use two 9x13 pans for the whole loaf, and then I poured the remaining egg mixture evenly over each pan after I had dunked and laid out my bread.  In the morning prior to baking, I flipped the bread, baked for 20 minutes, flipped the bread again, added the pecan/maple syrup topping, and baked for the final 20 minutes.  DELICIOUS!

I never thought i could make pastries!  This dish tasted like something I would get from a cafe.  I used egg substitutes and replaced some of the butter and sugar with apple sauce and the dish was perfect!

just came out of the oven - yummy! definitely butter the pan. i had fresh french bread and toasted some of it at 200 for 10 mins like a reviewer suggested, and used some of it as it was - i found that the end result was the same.  i followed the recipe exactly except i used 12 ozs evap. milk & 4 ozs skim milk b/c i forgot to get 1/2 and 1/2, and took the advice of another reviewer and cut back on liquids by 1/2c. it's not AT ALL soggy - in fact, the other 1/2c of liquid prob would've been fine.  i had a lot more bread than space so i made one in a 9x13 and one in an 8x8 - still had egg mixture left over.  used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp grand marnier - can't really tell. i sprinkled cinn sugar on one batch and it tastes like really good cinnamon sugar toast.  cook time is dead on. a great recipe that you can mix up the flavors on and have fun with! happy 2006!

Wow!!  There's nothing like a piping hot, gooey pecan roll in a pan for breakfast!  I used pecan halves so they were easy to remove for my toddler.  The syrup carmalized around the pecans.  Very yummy.  I halved the recipe but made 2/3 of syrup.  Very nice, but I will keep it for special occasions as it is very rich.  Thanks for the yummy breakfast.

Very good, and easy! You do need to make two pans though for the egg mixture, do not just dump it all onto the bread. I doubled the bread, dipped it in the egg mix, then I spread the remaining over the bread. Turned out really good, moist but not mushy.

LOVED this one! It got rave reviews at our house. I lightened it a little by omitting the cream and then using 2 cups whole milk instead of the 1 1/2c 2%milk. I also added some cinnamon to the egg mixture, and poured the leftover mixture over the entire pan of bread after "dipping." Greased the pan with butter, as others suggested. Used 1/3c butter and 3/4c sugar for the topping, and still found it plenty sweet. Thanks!!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! Not sure WHAT other reviewers are talking about that it's just "so soggy?"  Try BAKING IT LONGER. Mine were in the oven for 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES.  Came out crispy and delicious.  Also, if still soggy try spreading them out on a cookie sheet and turning halfway through.
     I didn't make mine the night before (I forgot...go figure!), but instead just dipped my 1 inch French Bread "sticks" in the mixture flipping a few pieces around in it at a time for about 10 seconds(perfect amount of dipping mixture for 1 whole loaf of French Bread...I followed ingredient amounts exactly), and since I was doing French Toast Sticks, I placed them on a cookie sheet, added sugar/butter mixture minus the pecans, and immediately baked them.
 I ended up baking mine for 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES on a COOKIE SHEET lined with parchment paper/lightly sprayed with non-stick spray = NO sticking, and crisp French Toast - VERY TRAVEL FRIENDLY.  Add a sprinkle of cinnamon on the tops of the toast before placing in the oven.   Also, be sure to use SALTED BUTTER....it will not be too sweet!  DELICIOUS!! Thank you Debbie!!

Great recipe! I actually froze it ahead of time and cooked Thanksgiving morning.  I used a loaf of french bread and low fat 1/2 and 1/2.  My only complaint was that the bread got a little hard and was difficult to cut.  Great flavor though! Will make again, maybe adjusting baking time.

First I like to say I made NO changes to the ingredients of this recipe. I did double this recipe and made it for Christmas brunch in my home along with two other breakfast casseroles. One was Chessy Ham and Hash Brown Casserole from Allrecipes (also gave a 5 star rating), Super Sausage Gravy from Allrecipes (also gave a 5 star rating), which we put over my brothers homemade biscuits, and my sister-in-law Vickie's Egg Casserole (that you put together the night before, gosh I love those recipes that you fix ahead of time). I was planning on 15-18 people. When I first made the Make Ahead French Toast it had no topping yet (and of course uncooked) it didn't look good at all. In fact I almost threw it out but I didn't, thank goodness. Once the topping is spooned over the next morning and it is baked to a golden brown it was heaven. Got tons of compliments. I have family members who do not like nuts so I made one side with nuts and the other side without. I ate the nut side and it was fantastic. The bread was fine uncut and I wouldn't neccesarily worry about cutting it up either unless I used a bread with a tough crust. Only dipped bread in liquid long enough to soak it WELL and then I DID NOT pour any remainder of liquid over the casserole. Turn out perfect.  Very rich meal though but I only do it once a year. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Debbie. I WILL be making this again.

We bought a big loaf instead of a baguette so I ended up cutting the french bread into 1-inch pieces.  We dipped them in the milk/egg mixture, refrigerated it overnight...the next morning, added 2/3 cup of remaining milk/egg mixture and baked at 300 for 75 minutes (while we were at church).  When we got home, I melted 3/4 of a stick of unsalted butter, 1 cup of brown sugar, 1t cinnamon, 2T corn syrup and topped the baked bread mixture with it and chopped pecans.  Baked it at 350 for another 20 minutes and it was DELICIOUS!!!  My sister and I have vowed that this dish will be at every family gathering!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is actually my favorite breakfast.  I make it pretty close to the instructions with only the following modifications...  First I use a stick of butter and rub it all over the dish to make a nice slippery coat.  I obviously don't use the whole stick, only about 1 or 2 tablespoons get used.  Second I've done this with both French loaf as well as "Texas" style bread (thick) cut into slices..both work great.  And finally, not only do I dip the bread I also pour the rest of the mixture all over before letting it sit.  By next morning it is ALL soaked up!  I usually serve it with frozen berries (thawed) mixed with orange juice and fine sugar in a food processor (I think somebody in here mentions it).  It doesn't need it, but it's a nice cool fruity touch to a hot dish.

This was an outstanding recipe.  I turned the french toast over half way and they weren't soggy or anything.  My daughter who prefers pancakes ate 3 slices on her own!!

I usually don't like doing things different from what the original recipe says, but I did here. I was feeding quite a few people so I used the whole loaf of French Bread. I buttered my glass dish and dipped the slices not briefly, but for a few seconds on each side so the liquid soaked into the slices. When I layered the slices, I overlapped them slightly so all (except the 2 end pieces)would fit. I then poured the rest of the liquid over. In the morning, I poured the little bit of liquid out of the pan before baking. I used only ¾ cup of brown sugar which was plenty sweet for us. I also used walnuts because that's what I had on hand. I moved the slices apart a little so the topping could run down in between the slices a little. It came out super good. EVERYONE LOVED IT! IT WAS THE BEST BREAKFAST EVER THEY SAID...YOUNG AND OLD! The top was crunchier then at the bottom but that was perfectly alright. And the overlapping prevented the sticking that other reviews have mentioned. No sticking here at all! Try it...it's delicious!

This is very good!! One person said: "Tastes like Pecan Sweet rolls" My co-workers really liked it. Yes I will cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (can use the Splenda/brown sugar) and probably reduce the milk by 1/2 cup.  I added 7 eggs total because the egg mixture seemed so milky.

I work at a Senior's recreation center, and I have used this recipe for many functions, serving up to 150 people.  Everyone loves it, and asks for the recipe.  I have even frozen and reheated leftovers and they were just as good.  Thanks! Bev  Also, upon reading others comments, I will leave the bread soaking overnight then flip it over 1/2 hour before baking, to allow the egg mixture to coat the bread more evenly.  Covering loosely with foil for the first half of baking will keep the top from over-browning.

My husband, 3 year old and I thought this was great. I modified the recipe a bit. Here's what I did. I made a loaf of pillsbury refrigerated french loaf, let it cool and sliced it into slightly more than 1" slices. I sprayed a glass 9x13 pan with Pam. I added cinnamon to the batter. I gave each slice a long dip in the batter on each side and placed it in the pan. I poured more batter over each slice and put a little in the bottom of the pan--enough to coat the entire bottom of the pan. In the morning, all the batter had been soaked up. I flipped each piece and poured the topping over it. I left the pecans out of the topping and cut the sugar in half. I baked it for 37 min and broiled it on high for the last 3 min or so (you have to watch it to make sure it doesn't burn.) I still had enough batter to make at least one more pan full--maybe I'll do that next time. It was delicious--it wasn't soggy and didn't stick to the pan. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious.  I didn't have half and half and just used a C of milk.  Perfect.  I'll try it with the half and half next time.  I tried another similar recipe and this is the one I'll be keeping.  Makes a lot of topping.  (Or crack as my husband called it!  Yum!)

I found this made WAY more liquid than was needed; same for the topping.  I cut both basically in half (3 eggs, half of the other liquid measures) and it was perfect.  In the morning, I flip the bread slices over before adding the topping and baking.  Everyone loved it.

This is a great recipe.. we enjoy it for Christmas Breakfast and Easter Breakfast, and I make it a lot when we have brunches at work.  People always ask me for the recipe.  One thing I do differently, though, is I use the entire loaf of French Bread.  I use the 1-inch slices to cover the bottom, but then I break the remaining bread into 1-inch cubes, dip them, and cover the top with them.  This makes it thicker and it looks more appetizing.

I made this for my boyfriend and his mom and brother one Sunday for brunch. Half of us liked and the other half found it to mushy. I personally thought it had good flavor but it did get a bit soggy.

This recipe was great and very easy to make!!!  It was a bit sweet, so next time i would do 1/2 the amount of sugar.  I used a french loaf of bread and cut about 12 slices (2 inches thick). The bread wasn't too soggy or dry.  Leftovers were even good the next day:)

We had this for breakfast this morning and it was very good.  I didn't make the sauce of the butter/syrup, etc. because hubby is picky about how his french toast tastes.  We will definitely make this again.

Definitely a "keeper".  Not having decided to prepare the recipe until the morning, I found that the recipe worked well without the overnight time in the refrigerator.  I just put the bread slices in a resealable zipper bag with the egg mixture and gently tossed and flipped a couple of times while making the sugar mixture. I used ciabatta bread sliced about 3/4 to 1 inch thick, followed the recipe with DivineHealth7's modifications, and garnished with fresh blueberries and a dusting of powdered sugar.  As an added bonus, putting the thin layer of butter in the bottom of the pan, as recommended by DivineHealth7 (I just used the remainder of the stick after making the sugar topping) created bits of caramel where the brown sugar mixture dripped over the bread, adding a bit of texture and extra richness.

This was DELICIOUS! I put it together 2 hours before Christmas brunch and it came out perfect. I think it would have been too soggy if I left it overnight. I also ran out of 1/2 & 1/2 so I used a mixure of cream and 2% milk. I also poured some of the mixture over the bread and did cut my bread a little thicker then the recipe says and added cinnamon to the batter. My inlaws and husband were very impressed. I served this with a ham, onion and cheese frittata I make. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I've got to tell you that my family just loved loved loved this recipe.  I did make one switch though, I used Challah bread (my favorite for french toast anytime) instead of french bread, and it was wonderful.  I tried it for the first time on Christmas morning (I guess this tells you how my my family liked it as I am writing this Christmas afternoon) for my picky Father-in-Law and even he loved it!!  It will be a holiday staple in my house now!!  Thanks Debbie for the recipe..

This didnt turn out very well for me.  The sauce turned into a hard, candy mess.  Way too sweet for breakfast.  I like the french toast part- but the sauce has got to go. I may try what another reviewer suggested- pour maple syrup on it towards the end.

After I dipped my bread, I poured all of the egg mixture into the pan and let it soak for about 4 hours, the dumped the excess.  I like mine with extra cinnamon, so I sprinkled some over the top before letting it set over night. Turned out great!  One time I even left it in my frig for 4 days before I cooked it (life happens) and it was still wonderful.

I made this for Father's day brunch and it was a hit!  Great flavor.  I too left the pecans in halves so they could be removed for the toddlers.  Also, only used 1 cup of milk for a firmer texture.  Will make it again!  Thanks for the recipe

This is great.  I've made it twice now - both times without the pecans and brown sugar, etc, just pouring the melted butter over it before baking, for a plainer french toast.  I served it on Christmas morning and for a special brunch, and it was a big hit each time. So easy and so good.

After reading the review which said, "nowhere in the recipe does it say to pour the remaining liquid into the pan", I thought, 'Well, right, how could it get soggy if you are just dipping the bread in it?'  So, I made this for our Christmas brunch. I did decrease the milk to 1/2 cup because Debbie (who submitted the recipe) said to do that if you wanted your dish more firm. It turned out fantastic! So tasty and everybody raved about it. Even my husband, who is very particular about his French toast, told me, 'thank you for making this, it is just what I wanted.' I even cooked it in the oven on convection with 3 other dishes and it still was not mushy when eaten.definitely a keeper!

UPDATED:  I had to come and update my review...I started making this when my oldest was about 3.  He is now 14.  When asked what makes Christmas special...it is THIS French Toast.  I've been told that if I don't make it, then Christmas is a bust.  
This is absolutely the easiest french toast to make.  Honestly, I followed the recipe to the T the very first time I made it except I dipped my bread I didn't pour it over the bread.  
It does make a LOT of egg dip if you only dip your bread.  
Pieces of Advice:
1) Do not crowd my baking dishes.  I will cut all of my pieces about 1 inch big.  In my 9x13 glass dishes I get about 8-10 pieces.  In my smaller glass dishes I get less.  I probably make about 2 9x13, 2 7x11, 2 9x9 dishes worth before running out of my egg dipping stuff.  
2) Since I never get to my french toast until about 9:00 pm (at the earliest and usually if I'm honest it isn't going into the fridge until about 11) on Christmas Eve, and I get it out of the fridge around 6:30 (at the latest), it doesn't need any more than 7 hours in the fridge.  BUT, if you don't let it sit in the fridge at least 6 hours, the bread doesn't bake right.  Trust Me...I know...just ask the kids about the failed french toast year (they all can still describe in great detail how I messed up Christmas...oy!)
3) I've made this SO many times...the sweet spot for cooking is 40 minutes in the oven at the recommended temp (so I cook in shifts b/c I don't have that many ovens), 5 minutes on broil (o

I used 2 cups of half and half only and eliminated the milk.  My small town grocery store didn't have french bread so I used English muffin bread instead.  Added 2 tbsp of sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon to milk mix.  Otherwise prepared as written- was absolutely delish!  Thanks for sharing!

Very easy to make.  I used a mixture of leftover bread from a couple of dinners (including some biscuits) and I didn't add the cream b/c I didn't have any, but did not seem to cause a problem  We will be making this again, but I will add cinnamon to the sauce next time.  Kids and hubby all loved it!  Thanks!

Made the first time this morning.  Was Ok...don't think I'll make again.  Or if I do, I will certainly tweek the recipe.  5 eggs-1.2 c. milk?  Really?  I had way too much left over...could have made another + recipe.  Not very cost effective, but had nice flavor.  Liked others much better.

I have made this a number of times. The first time I followed the recipe and it tasted great. Since I make a few variations every time. LOL. Sometimes I'll throw some blueberries on top before baking or add a bit of grated nutmeg to the egg mixture or a bit of cinnamon sprinkled in with the brown sugar and butter. A very versatile recipe and a keeper in this household. Tomorrow I am going to slice an apple to put on top. YUMMIE!!!!!!!!!

This is really delicious! I used Sarah Lee Texas Toast and followed tips from DivineHealth on spices. I used fat free milk and half & half, and used all the eggs in the original recipe. I sprayed the baking pan with Crisco Butter spray, and lifted the slices in the morning to spray the pan again before baking. It was delicious and decadent! My family loved it and it will become a regular for Christmas brunch.

Excellent and so simple to make.   We make this every year for Christmas breakfast, it's nice to have a yummy breakfast and not spend hours in the kitchen missing all the Christmas fun.  I add a little extra egg mixture into the pan the night before and the bread soaks it right up, gives it a little more flavor, is moist on the inside and has a nice candy like coating on the outside once it's baked.

Absolutely wonderful! Someone wrote a review for this stating they made their own bread using the Amish White Bread recipe, so I decided to give that a try. Thick, hearty slices were used. 12 or 13 of them, cut diagonally and layered. Mix was 1/2 cup whole milk, 5 eggs, 1 cup half and half, the vanilla and some cinnamon. Dipped and dunked bread, spread it out in cooking-sprayed 9x13 pan. There was maybe 1/4 cup of mix left that I drizzled over. Baked for about 50 minutes, it was fantastic. I agree that it's not like traditional French toast but it's delicious. You need to try this!

When my MIL tells me "this is gourmet" over and over again during our Christmas day breakfast, it must be unbelievable.  Four of us adults and two teenagers devoured this. If I had made two batches, they would have eaten them.  Followed recipe exactly except cut back on the milk a bit.  This is outstanding.

This really easy and was a huge hit at Christmas. I used 1/2 cup of lowfat milk and put cinnamon and nutmeg in the egg mixture. I did have a lot of egg mixture leftover and tried to use the leftovers for frying pan french toast, but that wasn't as good.

Very good! I love the fact of making night before. I had leftover batter, so I just poured the rest on the bread. I did add a bit of cinnamon to batter. Only just 1/2 cup of brown suger. Tasted great. Family loved it. Just add some fruit and some sausage for a side and wa-la, you have brunch!!

This was good & easy. Ommited the pecans as we don't care for them. Make sure you use THICK slices of bread. Do not layer the bread & try not to overlap it. Thanks.

This is a slam dunk breakfast. So easy to make the night before. It's very sweet, but everyone loved it. I served mine with sausage and fresh fruit. It was a perfect balance. Making again for more company this weekend.

Our new favorite. My daughter and I made this for Father's Day breakfast, and it was quite a hit. I thought it might be overly sweet, but it was perfect. The only change we made was to cut the bread in cubes to ensure even cooking. Served with balsalmic berry compote...scrumptious.

Outcome was good, but next time I would definitely cut back on the amount of liquid used- there was so much left over, I was able to add some sugar and bake it into a custard!  I would also use a texas toast, or heavier regular bread. The hard crust of the French Bread made the slices very hard.  I baked this and brought it to work for a potluck.  People liked it a lot.  Make sure you cover every piece of the bread with the topping to ensure it gets it's fair share of "syrup"!  Hope this helps!

Ignore the negative comments on this recipe & try it! It's exceptionally good in my opinion. There is a lot of batter left over & I'm not sure why, maybe it can make a bigger pan than stated. Anyway, I followed previous suggestions for cutting the sugar in half b/c it was VERY sweet & I used thicker slices of bread to avoid sogginess. TERRIFIC advice! I also used corn syrup & Italian style bread.

This was delicious!  I made this Christmas Eve and baked it Christmas morning and it was fantastic.  I cut my bread a little over 1" and also poured the remaining mixture over the bread and it was all absorbed the next morning.  I used regular Hungry Jack syrup instead of maple and it was fine.  I should have cooked the toast about 45 minutes as the middle was a little soggier than the outer edges but that's probably because I poured the extra over the top but in the end it didn't matter.  I had leftovers and they reheated really well the next day.

This is SOOOOO good!  This recipe always gets many compliments.  Great for special events.  Do keep the slices pretty thick like others suggest, otherwise it will turn out more soggy and not as crispy.  I can't say enough how much I LOVE this meal!!

I made this following the recipe except I used only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and didn't pack it down and I used less pecans.  I put parchment paper on the bottom of the pan and sprayed with Pam spray to keep it from sticking.  I pour all the liquid over the bread and in the morning poured off any that wasn't absorbed.

My husband made the mistake of taking it out too early and gave some to my daughter who hated it.  Well I checked it and it wasn't done yet!  So back in the oven for 15 more minutes.  It really puffed up and I could tell it was done then.  I didn't have a problem with it sticking at all.  

I liked this recipe and the pecan chips really made it special.  It does taste more like bread pudding than french toast, but I did really like it. I froze a small portion of it too see if it freezes well.

This has become a Christmas morning favorite!  The only thing I added to this recipe was a BIG splash of bourbon to the milk/egg/cream mixture.  I make 2 9x13 inch dishes from this recipe, unless I cut the liquids in half, because there's always so much left over.  And I pour the excess over the bread in the pan, as I've read others do.  Yum!

I made this recipe for Mother's Day brunch and got rave reviews from everyone!!  I used 1 cup milk and 3/4 cup of half and half and I still had some leftover, but the french toast came out great- not soggy at all.  I used cinnamon swirl bread and it was commented that it tasted just like Cinnabon.  My family said this recipe  should be a new tradition on Christmas morning.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I made this for my son's first communion brunch and everyone loved it.  I made the recipe as is - I did have just a little dip left over after dipping the bread and spooning some on top of each piece.  I cooked it early in the am and just put it in the oven to heat it up and it was yummy.  I highly recommend this recipe.

OKAY, I'm not rating this one because I'm positive that this came out so bad because of something I did. I didn't have french bread so I just used potato bread like I always do for french toast. Other than changing the bread and omitting the pecans (family's not a nut fan) I followed the recipe exact. The bread stuck so badly to the pan I couldn't get it out. The pieces that I was able to actually scrape out I served to my kids for a "back to school" breakfast. They said it was waaaay to sweet (and it definitely didn't look very appetizing). They wound up having cereal.

First off, this is excellent.  You can't lose with this recipe.  However, my husband and I thought this was more like Bread Pudding than French Toast.  You could serve this to company with a dab of very lightly sweetened whipped cream.  It is the best bread pudding we've ever had.  The bread I used was a loaf of French bread from the bakery section of the grocery store and it was 2 days old.  I used a glass pan and sprayed it with Pam.  The oven was set for only 325 degrees due to the glass.  One final note:  My husband and I ate 1/2 of the 9" X 13" pan and when I commented it was half gone, my husband said, "I'm not done yet!"

Sweet and delicious! The pecans really make the toasts special although it is not a must. I have used sliced and diced french bread for this recipe. Whichever cut you prefer, it was still good. The taste reminds me of cinnamon buns.

I made this for brunch over the holidays and everyone loved it. Versatile too. For instance, I used 8 eggs, a little less milk (about 1-1/4 c.) and thickly sliced italian bread. I used about 1/4 cup less of the syrup too which was plenty. I baked it about 10 min. longer which worked out well cause everyone seemed to love the crusty end pieces the best.  Thanks Debbie - great recipe!!

YUM!  I was trying to find recipes for a brunch and wanted something I could make ahead.  I was skeptical about french toast casseroles, as I thought they would turn out to soggy.  So, I made a test run of this recipe today by halving the recipe and baking it in an 8x8 pan.  I also made it with challah (egg bread), instead of french bread.  It was a winner!  It was delicious, not soggy, and my family loved it.  I'll definitely make it for the brunch.

This was totally different from the french toast I normally make.  It was really sweet in that you did not need syrup.  I will probably make it again.

A Mother's Day brunch was great with the addition of this french toast.  I immediately asked my daughter where she got the recipe, and went directly to the computer to get a copy for myself.  
I highly recommend this recipe.

The end product was EXCELLENT! But the ingredients are ridiculous---WAY too many eggs for this amount of bread! I had so much egg mixture leftover, I used another 18 oz. loaf of bread, AND still shared some of the mixture! The topping was scrumptious! After dipping the bread and placing in 9x13 pan, I sprinkled cinnamon all over...lots of cinnamon!

Flavor was great.  Based on reviews I wasn't quite sure if I should add all the remaining egg liquid after soaking the bread or not so I added half of it.  I used a french loaf that was a day old and soaked the pieces for about 30 sec before adding to the pan.  This didn't seem to be good enough even adding the half of the egg mix over the top.  Some of the bread wasn't soaked through even after over night so was a little dry when cooked.  But, I did use 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy whipping cream so maybe the thickness of the cream kept it from absorbing through. I only used 4 eggs too since there was so much liquid that couldn't possibly be used for the loaf (which I used more than half of).  Sprinkled some cinnamon on top before baking too.  1/3 c. butter and 3/4 c. brown sugar with the syrup with the pecans was plenty sweet for us.  40 min was perfect timing for us.

Used French Baguette.  Used 9x13 pyrextype pan in insulated carrier.  Extra mixture, so poured over bread before placing in Fridge.  Ended up baking 55 minutes; til knife came out clean.  Covered with pecan pieces& brown sugar.  Several people at pot luck did not like the nuts.  So I would just cover half with nuts, so there would not be so much waste.

What a great recipe. Spur of the moment family from out of town stayed with us and I needed a simple yet delicious breakfast for 6 adults and 1 child. I did not have a french bread in the house but I had a lot of leftover hotdog buns in the freezer. I split the hotdog buns apart, dipped in the egg mixture, spread in pan. I followed the recipe. I used enough hot dogs buns until the egg mixture was gone. About 2 layers in a 9x13 aluminum foil pan that I had buttered well. Once I had the hot dogs in the pan I covered it first with plastic wrap and then with aluminum foil and put it in the refrigerator.
In the morning I turned the pan upside down for about 10 minutes while I was getting the rest of the items ready. 
Put pan upright, took plastic and foil off and spread the butter and brown sugar mixture over it. 
This turned out really well and everybody liked it a lot. Thank you!

Made this recipe for Christmas morning and most everyone really liked it. I was looking for a traditional type French Toast recipe. After reading through reviews, I made the recipe as follows. I rubbed the pan with cold butter to prevent sticking. I used most of two 3/4 lb French loaves. I used so much b/c I tried different widths and slanted vs straight cut. Doing it again, I could get by with one loaf. I decided on 1 1/2 inch thick, slanted cuts, and filled up my 9x13 pan. Two inches was taller than the side of my pan and just didn't look like French toast. The French bread itself was very narrow. Next time, I may try a "fatter" bread. I mixed together 3 beaten eggs, 3/4 c. milk and 1/2 c half and half and poured this over the bread to soak overnight (and it soaked it all up). To save time the next morning, I went ahead and mixed together 5 T butter, melted, 1/4 c light brown sugar, and 1/2 T maple syrup. The next morning I reheated this mixture then poured over the French toast before baking. It did not completely cover all the breads, so next time I'll make about 1/4 more. I loosened the bread with a spatula to prevent sticking. I baked it probably a little more than 40 minutes, but in the rush of Christmas morning I can't be sure of the timing. Sorry! I served it with heated real Maple syrup in dipping cups. This was very good and I'll definitely make it again.

I have made this on several occasions, mainly for holidays and it always comes out nice.  Even my picky boys will drop everything to eat it. Tonight, I am incorporating some of the leftover pumpkin pie filling that I always seem to be left with.  It will add so much flavor to the egg/milk mixture.  Just an idea for those of you preparing pumpkin pies the day before.

Followed this exactly and will make it again.  Wasn't sure if I should stack the bread but that's the only way it would all fit. I used real maple syrup.  Absolutely YUMMY!

Very yummy!  
I found the liquid and topping to be enough for TWO pans of bread, though (with half a loaf of french bread in each pan - thick slices in a single layer, otherwise bottom layers don't get topping, which is the best part).  I can't even imagine how soggy on the bottom and sweet on the top it would be to use only half a loaf of bread.  
I made this for christmas morning breakfast and would definitely make again.  I think, because it's so sweet, it would be ideal as just part of a brunch spread, as opposed to the only thing on the table.  But so good.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a graduation party, and everyone liked it. Some people loved it, some thought it was a little too sweet. I used about 1 C less milk, so it wasn't soggy. Next time I would definitely decrease the caramel sauce. But, it was all gobbled up.

This recipe was absolutely outrageous! The only thing I did different was to add 1 teas. cinn. to the egg mix, put under the broiler at the end till a little brown and bubbly and I left off the nuts, only because of the picky kids. They tasted almost like a fresh baked caramel roll....YUMMY! Thank You for this wonderful addition to my cookbook!

This is a good recipe, but they were still a little soggy.  I took them out of the oven and cooked in a skillet until they were done to my liking.

This is the best breakfast I ever had!  I will make it again and again! This recipe is delicious and you don't have to fuss in the kitchen first thing in the day.  My recipe was a bit moist, but I poured all of the remaining egg mixture over the pre-saturated bread.  Next time, I will throw out any mixture left in the bowl and breakfast will be perfect.

Great recipe!  You can use a little more bread than 1/2 pound if you don't SOAK the bread in the milk mixture ("soak" defined as soggy to the point of the bread nearly falling apart).  You would need to use a bigger pan to do this, and I truly believe the french toast would not at all be affected by this, meaning it wouldn't be too dry (there should still be plenty to sufficiently wet the 1/2 pound of bread as called for and extra).

This was delicious. I took it to a baby shower and was repeatedly asked for the recipe. Just a reminder to everyone to grease your dish or the contents will stick horribly! I think I will add fruit the next time I make!

This was so yummy and easy to make! The one thing that I wasn't sure is that it says to dip the bread in the egg mixture, but you really want to pour the egg mixture over the entire pan full of bread and bake it. It was easy and everyone enjoyed it. We even ate it as left overs and it was still delish!

I made cinnamon raisin bread in my bread maker and used this in place of the french bread.  Also, I cut the bread into cubes and mixed the bread with the egg mixture.  It was a huge hit!

Very good - everyone always enjoys this. The only problem I have is that the french toast often sticks to the baking pan. I started putting the bread and egg mixture in a tupperware to soak overnight and then transfer it to a greased baking pan before I'm ready to cook.

Very good and loved the ease of preparation, anything make ahead is a bonus.  I did not need to use 5 eggs, maybe 3.  This one is rich, though so you best not be watching calories.

I love this recipe, it's delicious and a keeper, but I messed it up this past week!  We were vacationing at the beach in a big house with 4 other couples and I remembered this recipe and decided to fix it for everyone.  I bought foil pans to cook it in and ended up having to somewhat layer my bread slices.  Big mistake!  The parts of the bread that were under the other pieces were so soggy I had to cut them off and throw them out.  It turned out I could only keep about half, and I was so sad because it didn't appear to be a hit, and it truly is a wonderful recipe.  So!  Make sure your pan is big enough that you do not have to layer your slices!  I read someones suggestion about breaking it up into cubes or something, that may work well.  You all have to try this, it's awesome.  Just don'et layer your bread!

Without a doubt, the most looked-forward to Christmas breakfast dish.  I've made it for three different gatherings, and everybody has loved it.  I told one guest how to change it for a low-fat version, and she objected, saying 'don't mess with perfection!'

This was good, but not great. I did have slices sticking to each other, and I layered using a whole loaf of french bread. I had sprayed the pan with PAM prior to starting, but it didn't seem to matter. I let the dish stand 5 minutes before serving. Advice would be to remove ALL the slices at that time. I left some stay in the pan since we weren't eating it all at once and when we went back to getting a second helping it was even worse because the topping had turned into a carmel or even toffee-like substance once it cooled making it even harder to remove. I will try this again, maybe in a glass lasagna dish and will work with the amount of liquids.

EXCELLENT!!! I don't know what else to say. I was a little afraid because I have made recipes similar to this before and it came out soggy. Not this one! For one 9x13 pan I used 3 eggs, 1/2c milk, 1/2c half and half but made the full amount of topping. I used non stick spray on the pan before putting it in the fridge and had a little trouble with it sticking, not to bad. I made this christmas morning and my family liked it so much I think I will make it again for new year's morning.

Served it for my family and Mom was very impressed, Hubby loved it, too!  Only substitution was plain yogurt for half-and-half.  Dumped all of the egg mixture in and it wasn't soggy at all!  Just moist - Will make again! **Update: Best with challah and 3/4 c. br sugar.  For those who don't like nuts, omit the pecans and add 2 t. cinnamon.  Delicious!

After reading all the reviews, I felt that most people were disappointed with the consistency of the finished dish. I tried this dish using 5 lg. eggs, 1 c. 1% milk, 1 c. heavy cream (I was out of 1/2 & 1/2), 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract & a dash of cinnamon. I sliced French bread into 1" slices & left it out to dry for several hours, turning slices over after a few hours to dry the other side. I sprayed a 9x13 glass baking dish with Pam (no problems with sticking) and soaked each bread slice well till it had a spongy consistency. I had extra space in my dish & extra egg mixture so I added a couple more slices of bread. I still had some of the egg mixture left and could have probably used a whole 16 oz. loaf of French bread if I had a larger dish. In the morning I combined a stick of butter with a c. of brown sugar & spread this on a couple of slices as my daughter doesn't like nuts, and then combined 3/4 c. of chopped pecans to the remaining butter/sugar mixture over the rest. I cooked for 40 mins. and the dish had puffed up beautifully. However, as other reviewers have noted, the consistency of this dish was more like bread pudding. I will try this again, using less liquid or maybe using chunks of French bread. This dish definitely has potential with the correct liquid to bread ratio. I think the type of bread used makes a difference & this needs to be taken into consideration. Hope this helps others in their attempts to tweak this recipe to their personal liking.

I love this french toast! The pecan topping is the best. I add a little butavon, only because I have it, to the egg mixture. It would taste just as well without it though. It will take 2 9x13 pans, if you make the recipe as stated.

Soooo good!  I left out the pecans and used sourdough bread (wanted bigger slices of bread.) I poured the mixture over the bread slices but had to layer them in the pan to fit everything in.  The exposed slices got nice and brown and those underneath were soft, but that was a good thing, as you got a bit of soft and crunchy in the same piece of bread. There seemed to be a lot of liquid, but it all got absorbed into the bread overnight. Thanks so much for the recipe!

the flavor in these were excellent but I layered it and the bread came out soggy. I would suggest to someone making it to make a single layer.

We thought this was super yummy - especially the little one in the house!  I do think it's a tad too sweet so the next time I would use less brown sugar....and I would also use less egg mixture as I had a ton of it left over (even after using the entire loaf of bread).  We didn't have a problem with sogginess, but I will say that the little buggers stuck to the pan.  Yummy - and ohhhh so simple.  Thanks for the recipe!

yummy!!  Don't skimp on the syrup/butter that goes on top--it makes the recipe!  I forgot to grease my pan and the bread stuck, so don't forget to grease your pan beforehand!  It's a bit sweet for an everyday breakfast, but I'd definitely serve it on the weekend to guests!!  I added a bit of cinnamon, which was great!
EDIT:
I tried this again, and even though it tasted great, AGAIN my bread stuck badly to my dish.  I oiled it well, but I guess next time I'll have to use shortening???

VERY tasty!  I made this for my family on Christmas morning. Based on other reviews I only used 1/2 c milk and 3/4 c brown sugar.  I also only put pecans on half.  It tasted ALOT like pecan rolls.  We all really liked it.  It's pretty rich and sweet. I think it would be a great addition to a buffet or as part of a meal with less rich foods. I'm getting a craving just thinking about it!  Thanks for the recipes!

This was fantastic. I was looking for a lower fat, lower sugar recipe that the one my Dad used to make and I found it. It is definatly less soggy that others I've tried, plus the topping was DELISH !
This will be our new Christmas Morning tradition. This can cook while you open stockings, a true bonus.

This is WONDERFUL!  I made this for and brought it into work and everyone RAVED about it - it is very decadent (just what you want around the holidays!) The only adjustment I made was to add only 1 cup of milk.  I also "buttered" the baking dish and had no problem with anything sticking.  I will definitely make this on Christmas morning!

This is very easy and good! I just dipped the bread in the egg mixture once and spooned just A LITTLE more on top - so the bread wouldn't be soggy.  I also baked on a cookie sheet. I think the biggest tip is to let it "set" before serving...rave reviews at my brunch!

I made this for my husband's birthday breakfast.  It was very good, but I wasn't crazy about the nuts.  Making it ahead of time was very convenient for me though because it meant I didn't have to wake up so early in the morning.

I just made this for an Easter Brunch for all the navy guys in my husbands command.  It was a huge hit! I doubled the recipe and made 3 huge pans of french toast. I got way more then the suggested serving size.  This recipe is great if you don't like soggy french toast.  It came out very crisp and well cooked on the inside.  The topping is so good you don't even need syrup.  Will definatly use again.

To put it mildly, I am NOT a cook.  This Easter I was hosting a brunch and couldn't subject my family to yet another frozen lasagna.  I tried this recipe since it sounded pretty easy and my family absolutely loved it.  They were all exteremely shocked that I actually made something edible all by myself rather than ordering from a restaurant.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is good, but with a little tweaking it would be great! First of all, I doubled the recipe except for the milk, and I only used 2 cups vs. 3 cups. I did one batch without the pecans, and the other one I sprinkled the bread with the pecans. Mine turned out a little soggy, but I had set the oven to cut off after 30 minutes since I was getting ready for church. My hubby thought the texture was fine, but I think 10 more minutes would've helped. I was concerned since a previous reviewer said hers burned. The next time I will reduce the milk further (it may be possible to leave it out since there is so much half-and-half), add a little cinnamon, and cook the full 40 minutes. We definitely did NOT think it was too sweet as some previous reviewers mentioned.

This was well received as part of our Christmas brunch.  I dumped out 1/2 cup of the milk & egg mix before baking and baked it about 10 minutes longer.  It was still a bit wet inside.  Next time I'll add a pinch of salt and use 3/4 cup less milk & egg than the recipe states.  It also would be extra good with a few apples sliced up in it too.

Fabulous and easy.  I did reduce the milk to 1 cup.  It was too sweet for some of our breakfast club folks, but there weren't any leftovers either.

Easy recipe that serves very nicely to a large group.  I didn't know how to lay the bread - flat, layering the bottom of the pan, or stacked like you'd traditionally stack French toast.  So I cut the bread in smaller pieces and laid them flat on the pan.  No wonder I had so much milk left (I didn't use a lot of bread this way!)!  I didn't use all of the milk mixture because of what I read in other posts but next time I will use it all, to make the toast softer.  Next time I will use Texas toast, cut the bread in "boats" (triangles), stack the bread in the pan, use all the milk mixture, because it was fantastic and the large party I served loved it and I could have had more this way.  Tastes like cinnamon rolls - only less mushy!

Easy and delicious.  Just right for a special occasion.  If I make it for a typical breakfast, I will reduce the topping or try it with just maple syrup.  The pecans were delicious.  I did reduce the milk to 1/2 cup, and it was just right.

This was excellent.  Everybody loved it.  I would definately do it again.  I cut the bread into cubes and put it in the dish and poured the eggs on top, it was easier for everyone to serve themselves at brunch.

This is undoubtedly the best recipe I have gotten from this website.  I used day old french bread and cut down on the milk as suggested. Wow! I made it for christmas brunch it was the first to go.  Next time, I will double the recipe.  Will be a family favorite and christmas tradition for years to come. Thank you!

After going thru all these french toast recipes I chose this to try. And a fantastic choice it was! Taste-tested on the family and it was rated 10/10 by all. I added 1 extra egg and the only thing I'd do different is to use lifter in morning when you take out of fridge and just gently lift up each before cooking. (Just because a couple of the corners stuck even with spraying pan first). Super impressive, double recipe for family! So 2-9x13 lasagna pan size.

I just gave this 3 stars because the proportions seemed off. I cut the cream out altogether and I think there was still far too much liquid. I would suggest 4 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk.  Also there is far too much topping for me. I'm a Canadian girl, I would rather just pour maple syrup (real not the Aunt Jemima ) over it and bake it. It baked up so nice though, not soggy at all, much easier than making it piece by piece. I will definitely be making this again.

This was wonderful.  I actually weighed my bread since  that info was given, which I appreciate.  I did tear it into pieces because I had leftover kaisers needing to be used up. I ran a bit shy on milk, maybe 1/8 cup shy. The bread soaked up every bit of liquid an was not at all soggy. I halved  the topping to keep it lighter, and that was more then enough.  I added a tbsp cinnamon because it's a must with French toast. .......To the reviewers that said this was tasteless, your tastebuds are fried ! We will enjoy this again and again. Thank you.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! Didn't change a thing from the original recipie, just took the advise of another reviewer to use cold butter to grease pan. Made this along with quiche for my daughters first communion party, was an absolute hit! Both grandma's asked for the recipie! Thanks so much for sharing!!

Absolutely delicious! Made it for Christmas brunch for five guests. I used Challah bread with raisins so passed on the pecans.Tonight I'm using the same bread but without raisins, so plan to add the pecans. Morning can't come quick enough!

This was a great recipe. It was my first attempt at french toast. I left out the pecans and used the butter layer in the pan to prevent sticking as one reviewer suggested. Delicious!

Love this recipe!!  It has been a tradition for the last  7 or so years to have every Christmas morning with scrambled eggs, apple sausages, bacon and fruit on the French toast with whipped cream and, of course, mimosas!

Amazing! Brought this to a potluck and had so many compliments. I had heavy cream on hand so I used that instead of half and half.  Based on another review, before I put the bread into the pan, I lined the bottom with a thin layer of butter. In the morning, I loosened the bread before coating it. Because there were going to be children at the event, I omitted the nuts.  For cooking time, I was in a bit of a hurry so I used convection for 30 minutes. Lastly, I turned the broiler on for a couple minutes (watching it constantly!) to get a slight crunch to the top.  Really yummy! My husband and kids agreed that we should have this on Christmas morning.

Disappointed.  The worse French Toast I have even made.  I followed the recipe but halved it and baked it in a smaller pan.  I think I'll stick to making French Toast the original way- in a fry pan the morning it's to be eaten.

This is crazy rich and so tasty. I buttered the pan and sliced the bread into 1" slices. Soaked the bread for 20 seconds or so and poured most of the remaining egg mixture on top once all bread was in the pan. All was soaked up the next morning. You must serve bacon, ham or sausage with it to compliment the sweetness of the French toast. All loved it! Thank you for sharing!

Tried this recipe last week.  Was a bit skeptical as well. I generally don't soak french toast for more than a minute because i don't like it too soft.  However, i had some bread slices that were left out and dried and needed to use them up so i figured, French Toast!  I mixed the "soak" as directed but since i like it more on the firm side, I only put in 1/2 cup of the milk. I also added a bit of cinnamon.  The next day i made the glaze.  (again, was skeptical....i mean, i never glazed french toast before) but tried it anyway, baked it and served.  Waited for the reactions and well....it was awesome!  Definitely making this again!

I made this recipe for a family gathering of 24. I also made a few modifications. I cut the bread in slices and let them sit out to get a little stale, then I layered the dipped bread with pecans and cinnamon.   Everyone loved it

Absolutely couldn't be simpler!  I didn't have half and half so I just used 2% milk and it turned out beautifully.  I used 2 whole baguettes because it's what I had in the pantry.  I ended up making 1 1/2 recipes so that I could do some with pecans and some without.  I will definitely be making this in the future.  I will say that it didn't look too appetizing the night before, but once I put the topping on in the morning it looked beautiful.  I reduced the  milk by 1/2 c and it wasn't soggy at all!  Perfect first day of school breakfast!

Wow!  This is definitely the best make-ahead French Toast recipe I've come across.  The secret to its success is in only dipping the bread in the egg mixture, rather than pouring the mixture over top.  It keeps it from getting too soggy.

The recipe's proportions aren't quite right as the quantity of egg mixture easily dips an entire 1lb loaf instead of the half loaf the recipe calls for.  No problem - I just used the whole loaf and made two pans!

I added a layer of fresh sliced peaches over one pan before pouring the caramel sauce.  It was delicious, though that pan was definitely a bit soggy due to the extra juice.

I was also skeptical from previous reviews (would it be too soggy?), but decided to give it a try for New  Years Day. (We've started a tradition where we do a New Year's Day Dash, and while we're out running, our breakfast bakes in the oven, so this recipe fit in perfectly with our tradition!)

I followed the recipe, with a few modifications: added cinnamon to the egg mixture (yum!) and omitted the pecans (allergy).  I made the recipe around noon the day before, tossed it in the fridge, and cleaned up - very quick process (20 min max including washing dishes).

The dish took about 50 minutes in the oven. The first 45 minutes, I had a glass lid on the Corningware dish and for the last 5 minutes, removed the lid to allow the top of the french toast to get golden and a little bit crispy.

My only comment as a "watch for" is that our dish was too sweet. The directions say to "spoon" the butter/brown sugar/syrup mixture over the top before baking, I would recommend "drizzle" so that your dish doesn't get so sweet.

Next year, we will keep the tradition from this year - thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was good. I did decrease the milk.  I like my french toast kindda firm not soggy.   This is perfect for a large crouwd at breaskfast or overnight guest. 
I will definately make again!!!!!!!!!!!
In the future I plan make less of the liquid/batter to dip the bread.  I only needed a half of a loaf and there was enough liquid to do a full french loaf i think.

This is an excellent recipe. We usually fix it for Christmas morning breakfast. One thing that I change is I like to use a bakery loaf of cinnamon bread rather than the French bread. The touch of cinnamon goes so well with the other ingredients.

Worked out wonderfully! I used a bit less milk, and cooked about 50 min. Also added cinnamon, as a personal preferance. The pecans are a must. Baking them with the sugar mixture takes the dish to a whole new level. Even our picky eaters had seconds.

My husband and I LOVED this! I had a leftover french baguette from a party I hosted, and wanted to use it. I thought this sounded good, since it would soften the leftover bread and I could do it ahead of time. I was out of brown sugar so I omitted that, and I just sprinkled a tiny bit confectioners sugar on top (mostly for looks...) before serving with pure maple syrup. My husband said it was the best french toast he ever had. I froze the leftovers, and it was just as good reheated. I will definitely make it again and probably will continue to leave out the brown sugar since it was delicious without it.

Awesome! Made it for Christmas brunch, only difference was cut the milk to 1/2 cup... it was excellent! I cut the bread down the center lengthwise, then into the 1" inch slices to make it "chunky" looking, worked perfectly. Crispy, not soggy at all, tasty, it was the favorite, and sooo easy. Oh I did toast the pecans before adding to the topping mix. Will be making this again soon. Did I mention how easy it was? :) lol I am not the one to pick a recipe with 20 steps and the simplicity, and making it ahead was just ideal. Thanks for a great recipe!

The reason for the 3 stars was because it was much too sweet.  I will have to find a way to cut back on the sugar next time.

I added vanilla, Vietnamese cinnamon and a little sugar to the egg wash. Yummy! The moistness (some would say sogginess) of the bread worked well for a family member who has difficulty swallowing.

awesome.  made in a larger pyrex so used almost the entire loaf of french bread (1 pound).  too much egg mixture so cut down to 4 eggs and 1 1/4 C milk, .90C of 1/2 and 1/2.  Used 1 C of brown sugar, 3 TBS syrup and 1 1/4 cups of pecans.

the trick to non-stick results is to take a cold stick of butter and generously rub it in the pan before putting bread in.  yummy.

I used almost all of the 1 lb. loaf of French bread, and cubed it.  It soaked up all of the sauce and in the morning it cooked up beautifully - crispy on the top and creamy good in the middle.  The cubes remained distinct even after cooking.  This is a winner.

The smell of it cooking brought people wandering out of bed, wrapped in blankets like some corny coffee commercial. Fantastic but I didn't listen to other reviewers about flipping it midway or cutting back on the milk. I like my french toast a bit firmer but this was VERY good. We will make it again, just a little tweaked.

The idea was great but the finished product wasn't as good as I'd hoped. It was soggy and the topping was hard to spread/ drizzle evenly. I also had problems with it sticking to the buttered AND sprayed dish. To avoid the sogginess I will make sure there is only one layer of bread next time and flip halfway, and I think I'll use non stick cookie sheets instead of the glass casserole dish. **I toasted the leftovers in the toaster oven the next day and they were even better. Will try again.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I only used 2 cups of milk total and I also used the whole loaf of French Bread so I would have extra.  Otherwise, I followed it exactly and it turned out great.

I tear my bread into pieces and add enough to fill a 9x13 pan-sometimes that means getting regular old loaf and tearing part of it up too.  It looks so pretty that way.  Also, add cinnamon and nutmeg to liquid mixture.  Next time I might even try throwing a granny smith apple cut up into the mix.  I think that would be wonderful.  All in all, great recipe!

This dish got rave reviews.  I gave it a 4 star rating because it does stick a little to the pan if not well greased.  Otherwise the taste was fabulous.

Awesome recipe!! I've made for several gatherings and everyone always asks for the recipe. The kids love it too! I tend to have a lot of egg mixture. I usually use almost 1lb bread and make 9x13 and 8x8 until the mixture or bread is all gone. Very easy.

I greased my pan, but it still stuck. And some of the topping and some of the egg mixture ended up burning quite a bit in my pan. I'd rather make regular French Toast and top it with syrup rather than using this high calorie topping. (I still added syrup anyway!!) It wasn't too bad tasting as a cold snack though!

This is a GREAT way to use up those few buns at the end of a package that never get used. I throw the last ones in the freezer until I have a bag full, then when slightly thawed, but the "outer crust" off, the unsliced ones make this recipe PERFECT and company swears I made "cinnamin pecan rolls" only better!

I made "Sweet Honey French Bread" for this recipe.
I didn't follow this recipe exactly. For the egg mixture I used: 5 eggs, 1 cup light coconut milk, 1 cup low fat milk, 1/8 cup heavy whipping cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon almond extract.
I checked it after 40 minutes and it was still too moist for me, so I baked it an additional 15 minutes.
This turned out Extremely tasty!  Definitely a keeper, I'm putting this into my hard copy recipe box.

My sister made this for her family for Christmas morning.  I came over to her house on the morning of the 26th and had a piece of the leftovers and it was still amazing.  I can't imagine what it tasted like fresh!  This is a keeper for sure!

This dish is so easy and delicious. I made it for my family the morning after the big "Day After Thanksgiving" shopping trip. The make ahead portion is quick and so is the morning preparation. I was pleasantly surprised that the maple syrup isn't over powering. Basically it makes a carmel sauce, no maple taste at all. I shared this recipe will all that had it as they want to make it for their families too.

this recipe was so easy to make and turned out great.  (i was a little nervous making it for my husband's family the morning after thanksgiving, since i'd never made it before).  but i was really surprised at how easy and delicious it was.  
i listened to the advice from reviewer "Cookin in D Town" from Oct 1st, and added some extra spices, and poured out the extra liquid after turning the bread slices over again before cooking. this was not at all soggy.  perfect! 
i will make this again....and again.

This is a very tasty French Toast.  I agree with other viewers...way too much milk. The next time I make it it will be perfect!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Although it tastes good (very sweet!), it turned out very soft and mushy in the middle, much like bread pudding, so for that reason we do not like it.

This was good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a dash of cinnamon to the mix.  Next time I think I may make less of the liquid mixture and soak it for a few hours rather than overnight.  It was a little too soggy for me.  Also, I think you can get by with using a lot less melted butter.  Yummy!

very good and very easy to make. Didn't have any half and half on hand, so used gingerbread coffee creamer instead. Used pre-sliced Texas Toast.Made approx 16 slices. Reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I would suggest spraying with "Pam". I buttered the pan and it was tough getting the pieces out. Will def. make again!

This recipe is soooo good!  Be careful about the French bread that you buy - mine was two smaller loaves (1 pound each) and they were soooo dense.  Luckily the milk/egg mixture loosened it up a bit.  But the bread chosen should have the texture of white bread or even less dense than that if possible.

After reading a lot of the reviews, I opted to make only half of the liquid portion and used an entire french baguette...worked out perfectly, with nothing to throw away. My husband was really skeptical at first, but luckily he promised to try...Well, he ate 3 servings! Also note, I did not sprinkle cinnamon and I used slivered almonds instead of pecans. So they did not taste like cinnamon buns to me. Great hit! Will definitely try this for larger family gatherings.

I used the ingredients as listed and made no substitutions while making this recipe.  Although, the only thing I will advise for folks to do is use a pyrex glass dish and spray "Pam" on it.  Bake as directed, but instead of allowing the hot dish to wait 5 minutes, serve immediately; not doing so will cause the syrup to thicken on your dish and can be a headache to remove.

It was a great dish and I would even go as far as using this "egg and milk mixture" for your french toast recipe...it's that good...sprinkle your cinnamon and nutmug and delish!!!

It was a good recipe, but I gave it four stars because the title was a little misleading.

Let me first say that it was good. However, it tasted nothing like French Toast. If you are wanting the taste of French Toast then this recipe is not the one. It tasted, like many have said, like cinnamon rolls. For that reason I gave it 3 stars. For me, it is too sweet to eat alone. It would be fine along with some other breakfast foods but not alone. 
I didn't have any problems with sticking as others did. I used Crisco and greased a pyrex dish. I followed the directions to the T except I reduced the milk to one cup. 
I probably won't make again because I just don't care for really sweet breakfast foods.

I used egg beaters rather than eggs, and evaporated milk rather than half-and-half in this recipe in an attempt to lighten it up.  Usually these substitutions work fine, but for whatever reason this recipe didn't work out that great for me.  The taste was nice, but it was very hard to get the  bread out of the pan the next day, and the topping seemed to turn a little crunchy.  Cleaning up the baking dish was a nightmare.

Very good!  I forgot the grease the pan but they were still good and didn't stick to the bottom of the pan too bad. Somehow I had more of the egg mixture left over than I needed but it was still plenty moist.  The topping really makes it.  Mine came out really soft in the middle and crispy and sweet on the outside.  Thanks!

I made this today for Mother's Day brunch. I was a little worried, based on some of the comments that this recipe was turned out soggy. However, mine came out great and eveyone loved it. I did do a few things differently. I added cinnamon and used 2 cups of milk, and the thick French Toast style bread. I greased my baking dish with shortening and then lightly dipped the bread. Based on a tip I saw in another recipe for a smiliar French Toast, I flipped the bread over to the other side and added the topping. I think this eliminated some of sogginess. It crisped up nicely and topping really makes the dish!

I thought this was very tasty and so did my family.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but I had almost half of the egg/milk/cream mixture leftover--even after pouring some on top of the bread after I dipped it.  It seemed like a waste to have to throw it away.  I would definitely cut the ingredients to about half for a 9x13 pan.  Well, not the topping...that was the perfect amount for a 9x13 pan.  You definitely need to use a good thick bread--it would be way too soggy if you didn't.  Turned out very good and I would make again.  Thanks!

There wasn't anything that really made this recipe stand out above the rest as far as french toast recipes. I replaced the pecans with chocolate chips for the kids. They weren't thrilled with the results. I won't be using this again.

This was really good, but I am not sure I would call it French toast.  I think a better phrase would be Cinnamon/Sugar toast (I added the cinnamon myself).  Which I like!  I will make again.

This recipe is great!  I've made it several times now.  The only thing I do is double the topping mixture, as I find the bread cubes make a little more than a 9 x 13 pan.  So, I make another small amount in a 8" square pan.

A Christmas standard....however, I put the butter / sugar mixture in the pan first and add several peeled, sliced Granny Smith apples, cinnamon and raisins, then the bread and milk mixture.  Serve with whipped cream.  Yum!  Convenient because you can prepare it the night before and let it bake while opening presents in the morning!

I thought this recipe was MUCH too sweet.  Mine also turned out soggy.  I probably won't make it again, but if I did, I would use a fraction of the sugar and probably not let it sit in the egg mix too long, as other reviewers have posted.

This was very good!!  I made this for breakfast for a  girlfriend sleepover and it was a hit.  I mistakenly bought heavy whipping cream, instead of half-n-half, and I can't see where that was wrong.  This was just delicious.  Two thumbs up!

This was really good. I dipped the bread in the egg mixture and poured what was left over on top. It did not come out a bit soggy. I also added cinnamon to the egg batter for more flavor.

This is a very good idea and can be a great starter recipe for all types of breakfast casseroles.  I made it plain, just the way the instructions said, and just smushed all the bread into a 9X9 baking dish, poured the mixture over the top and baked it.  It came out very firm, like a bread pudding. Im thinking it would ba good with a spice mixed added to it, like Mrs Dash for a more savory rendetion or pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon for a wintery holiday version.  I also may considering adding  bananas or rasins to it for a fruit nut version.  Since my bread was squeezed into the dish, it made a very nice, sliceable casserole that stood up well.  The extra amount of mixture used in the recipe actually helps keep all the bread soaked during baking and keeps it from getting too hard.  A good recipe, I'll use it again.

Easy to make and my kids loved it. The middle is a little mushy but it firms up if you let it sit before serving. Leftovers are just as good warmed up the next day.

This was wonderful.  I tried it for my mother-in-law.  I used only one cup of milk and with the left over egg mixture I pour approx. 1/4 cup over the already dipped bread in the casserole dish.  **If making for a crowd use 2 loaves (1 pound each) there is enough egg mixture for both.  Will make again especially during school.

I loved this! I altered it a little after reading reviews.  I cut out all the milk and used fat free for the cup of half-and-half. I only had "lite" bread and no pecans. It was so yummy and not too gooey inside.  The only thing I'll change next time is I'll use less brown sugar as it was a little too sweet and I'll use thicker bread just to try it. Oh! And I also did not let it sit overnight, just for 10 minutes actually and it was fine!

This recipe for French Toast is wonderful!  I added only 1 cup of milk and it was perfect!  This is a great dish to make ahead of time for an early breakfast!

I used this french toast as part of a mothers day brunch and it went over very well. It was very easy and convinient to make the night before. I used homemade bread which made it even better.

Sooo good!!  Made for Mothers Day brunch.  I used almost a whole loaf of (3 day old) french bread and cooked in a 10x13 pan.  Cut milk to 1 cup instead of two, still had leftover egg mixture.  I poured some of the leftover egg mixture over top.  Wonderful recipe and easy to make, will make again!

Excellent! I took this to a youth breakfast at church and received rave reviews. After reading others comments here, I made the milk/egg mixture with only 2 cups of milk (no half-and-half). Then I used two loaves of French bread and ended up with 2 9x13 pans and 1 8x8 pan of french toast. In this way, there was not too much egg/milk mixture when it stretched over this much bread. The topping used in this recipe is the clincher. As someone said, it is like pecan sticky buns. I love easy, inexpensive recipes that make you look like a great cook. :-)

I used a whole loaf of french bread and had to divide it between 2 baking dishes.  I used the full amount of milk and eggs and did not have a problem with this being too soggy but mine came out a little on the dry side.  There was no excess moisture so I had to serve this with syrup...which wasn't a bad thing.  I really like the brown sugar topping and wish I would have doubled it.  We enjoyed this Debbie, thanks.

*****+++  This is absolutely the most delicious, sinfully rich, easy to make french toast recipe you will ever come across.  I made it Christmas Eve and finished the preparation on Christmas morning.  Oh my, we couldn't get over how wonderful this recipe was.  Tastes more like a sticky bun than french toast, but who cares?  It was a special treat for a special morning!

Try this one with a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread cubed then just pour in the egg mixture  and soak overnight. Crisp on top and like bread pudding in the middle. Some people just don't care for the texture but that means more for ME! and I can live on this stuff. If you are afraid it might be too sweet ... leave off the sugar topping and either serve with butter and syrup on the side or some sliced fresh strawberries.

Brought this to a Bridal Shower Brunch at work, and it got great reviews.  Very, very good.  Not too sweet, and it wasn't soggy.  However, I drained a bit (less than half a cup) of the egg mixture out of the pan before I went to bed, so I think that helped.

Great with or without nuts! I would not change a thing in this recipe.  I especially like easy one pan dishes because I cook a breakfast or dinner dish for the homeless(#12) once a month. One pan dishes like this make it easy for me and ensures a delightful surprise for them! In turn it makes me feel as though I gave my very best (I never tell how easy)!  Thank you Debbie.

I think the instructions were probably a little too vague on this recipe because there is a LOT of the milk/egg mixture left over.  I used the other half of the loaf of bread in the mixture and then poured the mixture over both pans of bread.  Although the bread got brown, the inside was mushy.  I had high hopes for this recipe but probably won't be making it again.

I doubled the recipe and made one pan with pecans and one pan without.  Both were fantastic!!  Instead of mixing the nuts into the mixture, I just sprinkled them on top of the bread right before I covered it with the butter/syrup.  My family loved it! The one with pecans tasted like pralines. The other was like gourmet french toast! Thanks Debbie-- a great addition to my brunch recipes!!

Oh, YUM! This is just fantastic and EASY. I used Texas Toast and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg wash.  I also used about a half-cup less milk -- I was a little unsure about what to do with the rest of the egg and milk mixture, so I didn't pour all of it over, but I will next time.  My husband LOVED it.  It was even good the day after I made it.

Great! I reduced the milk by a fourth of a cup and also left out the maple syrup.  It turned out great. After dipping the bread in the egg mixture, I had quite a bit left over so I poured most of it over the top of the bread.  I ended up baking mine for around 50-55 min.  Everyone at our family retreat loved it.  The leftovers were great as well.

Everyone loved this recipe and it was SO EASY!  The pecans took on a wonderful flavour after baking with the brown sugar and maple syrup.  Using the advice given by another reviewer, I also used challah (egg bread) and cut it into cubes between 1 and 1 1/2 inches square.  Excellent!

This was very delicious!!! I made it for a Halloween potluck breakfast at work and it was eaten very quickly. I received many requests for the recipe. Next time I probably won't add so many pecans - but just a personal preference. Thanks for the recipe!

I made half a recipe for DH and I -using three eggs and halving the other ingredients. I only used the maple syrup - no brown sugar.  Still plenty sweet.  Only used maybe half the  liquid so bread crisped well and didn’t turn gooey.  Nice Sunday morning bake - leisurely  breakfast.

Our favorite brunch dish for company!   Our only change is not adding the pecans.  We’ve never had problems with the bread being soggy.  Delicious!!!!

Wonderful!!! Quick and easy.  Only change would be to cut back a little on brown sugar topping.

I have been making this on Christmas Eve for Christmas morning breakfast for about ten years now. I don't use nuts because half my family won't eat them. I omit the milk and just the half and half as written. I do flip the bread in the morning and let it bake about 20 minutes before I add the "sauce." I have used franch bread and challah. I liked the challah better but both were good. This is a special recipe for us.

AMAZING french toast... Crunchy on the outside, and soft in the middle!! I made only a couple of small modifications after reading through the reviews... After placing the dipped bread in the greased baking dish I drizzled a SMALL amount of the leftover dipping liquid on each slice of bread. I also flipped each slice of bread over in the morning (before putting the topping on- which I added a tiny bit of nutmeg to). UNBELIEVABLE dish! I will definitely make it again!

This was easy, and really good. I used a whole loaf of French bread , and doubled the amount of topping (I did not double the egg/milk dipping mixture). I added the zest and juice of half an orange before adding the topping, and I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping.

This is more like a dessert than breakfast.  But, if you are looking for a sweet treat that is easy to make and can impress guests, this is it.  You'll need to serve with fruit to balance it out.  And, no syrup required- this is plenty sweet! :)   I only used 3 eggs and half and half.  If you just dip  the bread, and bake for 30+ minutes it will not be soggy.

A cross between French toast and a sticky bun...delicious! The only change I made was that I used only 4 eggs, 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half, and I had just the right amount of liquid to coat half a loaf of French bread (which for me was 8 slices). I will make this again.

I used purchased egg nog instead of the eggs, milk, etc. Made with 4 large slices of French bread, and about 2 cups of egg nog and the full recipe of the syrup mixture. Delicious!

This was extremely yummy. More like a dessert than breakfast. I used 50% wholewheat french loaf. I did cut down on the sugar, cream and butter and it did not affect the dish. I sprayed my glass baking dish first with Pam and had no trouble with sticking. I will make again but for special occasions.

Delicious. Only had enough butter for 1/2 the topping, but it was still so yummy. Didn't really need 5 eggs, better to start with 3 and make more if you need it.

I've made this many times, and fam has always liked. 

I use challa bread instead, cut into 1in thickness. dip & soak overnight is key. next morn, sprinkle the bread w/some cinnamon before drizzle then bake.  
for one loaf challah bread, the sugar mixture is more than enough - even half should be fine.  if prefer, broil bread for last few seconds for crispy edges.

Followed the recipe exactly. Since this bread sets overnight in the fridge and bakes nearly an hour I was expecting it to have a deeper flavor, and chewier bread (due to the milk and egg soaking on the bread all night). The bread was very dry, tasted bad compared to the French toast I can make in 10 minutes on an electric skillet with the same ingredients -- but still edible.

All the bread ended up being a double decker in my pan but that was fine.  I just put 1/2 the pecan mix on the bottom and 1/2 on top.  I cooked it a little longer for a texture that was firmer as someone else suggested.  I also assembled and baked the same day but next time I'll try the overnight method to cut down on time.  It turned out well for Father's day & my family really liked it.  Thx!!

After reading thru reviews I halved the brown sugar and maple
syrup so it wouldn't be overly sweet. Also, omitted the pecans,
I would have like them but family would have picked them off.
I used Texas toast which was just purchased so a little too soft and fresh and which made the finished product just a tad 
soggy. I did add cinnamon to the egg mixture for some added flavor. Overall everyone enjoyed this and will make again but I will make sure I have French bread on hand. I really like the idea of making ahead and popping in the oven the next morning.  Served it with bacon and enjoyed it.

I've made this recipe plenty of times with no changes. Hands down the best french toast I've ever had, and my family will back me on it! We use it every Christmas morning, and have at least 20 people ask for seconds!

I couldn't find unsliced french bread so we used a really nice Egg Bread (From Nino Salvaggios). We were able to squish exactly 6 pieces into the dish and it  was plenty to serve 6 people. We left the sugar/nut mixture off of two pieces to meet the preferences of a few of our guests. Some of the sugary syrup made its way to their bread from the bottom of the dish but not much. This dish really would be great with or with the topping but with the topping it was AMAZING!!!!! We will definitely make this a lot in the future!

This recipe was super easy to make and soooo delicious! I made it for my students for their last morning class and they went crazy for it.  I left out the nuts and it had cooled slightly by the time it was served so it was more like a soft warm finger breakfast! I will definitely make this again!

I haven't had any of the mentioned problems with this recipe. I do sprinkle cinnamon on each slice after dipping  & for a very rich change occasionally I add molasses in addition to the maple syrup just for our particular likes. Also, sometimes we double the topping in order to have half leftover for my ones who love to dip until it's almost pure sugar, haha! My kids (teenagers) & entire family absolutely LOVE it! I bake alot & I always like to have a breakfast casserole ready to pop in the oven on Christmas morning & this one's it now, not to mention all the other times I make it in between to make any day special.

It is simple, feeds many and in terms of taste imagine when you say "I didn't  think I could make something like this on the first try" or you hear after the first bite: "Oooh, this is so good"!
Variations: 
Soaked Italian bread just before making it
Pure maple sugar instead of regular syrup
Chopped cashews 
Left some of the bread without the sugar and added the chopped cashews for a savory option.
Total success!

I did modify this and it was fabulous!!  My family loved it!!  I  added Smirnoff Kissed Caramel Vodka to the egg batter and used Hawaiian Bread, which I cubed, instead of French Bread .  I also added Cinnamon Sugar and Brown sugar on top of the bread prior to covering it the night before.  I will definitely make this again!!!

We made this for Christmas brunch. Everyone loved it. The only modification we made was to use 2 cups of half-and-half in place of the milk. We were able to make a full loaf, with mix left over. Was not soggy, and was deliciously crispy on the outside.

This was amazing!!! All loved it, even though I had to use a crop pot instead of baking it. I highly recommend. It was so delicious with the crumbled topping that I didn't even have to add syrup.

Too much butter. It's all I could taste. I would minimize the brown sugar mixture all together if I chose to make it again. The mixture caramelized and hardened into a candy glaze and whatever you do, make sure you use a nonstick pan. It will burn  any other pan you put it on.

Debbie Tate’s MAKE AHEAD FRENCH TOAST has been a Christmas morning dish for our family the last 10 years.  Also, it's a request from my boys when they have to provide a breakfast dish for their youth Sunday school class.   I pretty much follow her recipe.  After I dip the toast, I stand each piece up like the loaf. I have also found to not soak each piece too long or it may become soggy.  Sometimes I use Italian bread.  I have shared this recipe with other close friends and they too began preparing it for Christmas morning.  It is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!  Children as well as adults will love it.  Thank you Debbie Tate for sharing your recipe.

Came out great and delicious, although I left out the nuts. Actually ended up using twice the amount of french bread than recommended as there was PLENTY of leftover egg mixture

I modified the milk for almod milk, and heavy cream for **Vanilla frnch coffee cream**, and did the6 eggs but half of the eggs were egg white...I sub also for the maple syrup to corn syrup, n heated up the sugar n butter n corn syrup on the stove then toped the french toast with it and continued to bake additional 15 minutes...bombed!

This is a family favorite and we make it on a monthly basis for an easy brunch. I find the egg/liquid quantities listed are more than necessary and make the bread overly soggy for our taste. I use half of the amount for the eggs, half & half, milk, and vanilla, and it is perfect for a moist but firm french toast.

I made this french toast for a recent birthday brunch- it was super easy and tasty (I was unsure about the whole make ahead deal) but nonetheless- 20 of my friends devoured this thing!! I add some cinnamon and cooked for a bit longer than the original recipe calls for...I couldn't tell you the exact time but enough time to let the bread firm/crunch up a bit...I wish I would have made an additional serving...everybody was asking for more! So so good...highly recommend and will definitely be making this again

Fantastic recipe!! I think the only way it wouldn't be a favorite is if someone didn't follow the recipe! It is so good that I have already made another double batch and froze it. The family just takes what they want out of the freezer and pops it in the microwave to eat on the go. Walmart sells sliced french bread which is perfect to use. 2 loaves and double the recipe. I will use this recipe for years to come and have been asked for the recipe!

Made this for a family gathering and got rave reviews from all. The only complaint,why did I not make two pans?
My only changes were walnuts unstead of pecans(had the walnuts) and a light sprinkle of cinnamon over the topbefore pouring thesauce over to bake
Absolutely loved this recipe!

Really good.  Used bread from Costco. Drenched bread the night before and saved leftover liquid.  In the morning I used the leftover liquid to pour back over the bread.  I let it sit out for a bit and then put the topping on and baked it as directed. Made on Christmas morning and everyone liked it- I'll make it next year.

Great recipe. I felt the maple syrup and sugar was to thick and heavy when I spooned over the French Toast. Instead I added a little water to the syrup, mixed and spooned on. Be careful not yo make to runny. Broiled for 5 minutes befre stving. This was outstanding.

I did not let this sit over night. It was delicious!!! The only problem I had with it was that it was too soggy in the middle. So I removed half the batch from the pan, put them on a lightly greased cookie sheet uped the temp to 400 and baked them for 20 extra minutes 10 on each side. They were still a little too soggy but tasted great and well worth the effort. I do not even want to know how much soggier they would have been if I left them to sit over night and soak up the juices.

I halved the liquids in the recipe and it didn't turn soggy at all, not even too moist... I might use the original amount of liquid the next time I make it. It turned out good though.

YUM. I used up a half a loaf of regular potato bread that was getting too crumbly for sandwiches. After dipping all the pieces I thought it would be a shame to pour all the rest of the batter down the drain so I poured it all right over the bread. It baked up fabulous the next morning! Not soggy at all and the pecans got so nice and caramalized and toasty and crunchy. It smelled like pecan pie coming out of the oven. Husband, and 6 & 4 year old girls LOVED it. What a great alternative to frying a couple slices at a time in a skillit. Thanks!

Good french toast, although we didn't find it as sweet as other reviewers.  I used the entire loaf of french bread because there was so much of the egg mixture left over.

Love this recipe.  Used half the amount of liquid still had plenty.  I poured remaining liquid on bread in pan.  Made with day old bread from my bread machine.  Was not soggy at all.  Loved the topping.  Thank you for the great recipe.

DELICIOUS! The only changes I made were to add some ground cinnamon, nutmeg, & cloves to the mix. It came out like a combination of bread pudding, sticky buns, and coffee cake, but oddly enough nothing like french toast. Still-- it was awesome! Will definitely go into "company food" recipe box. :)

This was soo easy and good.  The only subsitution i was made was to use almonds instead of pecans and only half a cup.  I made this for brunch and it was such a big hit, everyone loved it and took all the leftovers home!

FIVE STARS is not enough!!  This tasted so great...tasted kind of like a cinnamon roll.  Course, I sprinkled on some cinnamon after dipping bread... I used 4 eggs, 1 c milk and 1 cup half and half with the vanilla and had just enough to soak about 1 lb of bread quite well.  I made it at about 10:00 AM, and started cooking about 5:30 the same night...it was great!!!  I served with some home fries (pan fried round potatoes) and milk for the kiddos.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!  Can't say enough good about this recipe!!  Easy and tasty!  Thanks

This is the second time I've made this dish and my family seems to love it. I too at first was worried about it being soggy but it turned out great.

I made the recipe exactly as stated, but I poured the rest of the egg mixture over the bread.  It ended up with a good flavor. A little soggy the next morning, but my daughter loved it and keeps asking me to make it, (usually she doesn't like the things I cook.)I guess I will make again.

Very yummy.  I made this for a staff breakfast and every bite was eaten.  People said they liked that it wasn't too sweet.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture, and pour it over top instead of dipping.  Came out great.

I love French Toast off the griddle.  I was hoping to save time on Easter morning with this, but I have to admit I was disappointed...came out like a custard in the middle, dry around edges, and granular from the sugar.  I'll stick to the traditional French Toast.

This is my first time writing a review but I had to write one for this dish. It is SO good! I made it for my playgroup and everyone loved it!  We all went back for seconds. I did cut back the milk to 1 cup and used half the amount of pecans but other than that I followed the directions exactly and it was awesome, not to mention easy!!!  Was not soggy at all!!!  I will definitely make this again!!!

Very, very good!  I made this for Christmas morning brunch and boy was it a hit!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the milk by 1/2 cup as I don't like soggy bread and it turned out wonderful. The pecans really added a nice, nutty flavor that complimented the overall dish so much that you'd really be missing out if you didn't include them.

I used french bread cut into slices and only let it soak for about 30 minutes. That wasn't nearly long enough. Still good though!

This is great recipe and simple! The origianl recipe posted was a little vague making the posted reviews very helpful. I followed advice to cut sugar and replaced the half n' half with 1 cup of milk.

I really wanted to give this 5 stars and the way it sounded made it seem like 10 stars, the truth is, after cooking for 55 minutes, my edges were tough, my top was crispy and my middle was still really soggy.  I might try this again, but after the looks on teh ids faces, I don't know.

This recipe was fantastic!  I used a loaf of challah and after reading other reviews just did a quick dip in the egg mixture to avoid a mushy outcome.  The result was perfect!

Not a fan of this recipe. The french toast didn't cook all the way through and what did cook was gooey and way too sweet. And I normally love anything sweet. I don't recommend it at all.

This was great!!  I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on the bread before putting it in the fridge.  I also baked it on a baking stone.  I got it all ready in the morning and we had it for dinner.  Thanks so much!

I like this recipe alot but sometimes it comes out kind of soggy on the bottom.  I think I might take some advice from other reviewers and not let it sit in the milk/egg mixture overnight - maybe for just and hour or two instead.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and have since made it several times. I have to give the recipe to everyone who tries it! It is absolutely fabulous! I have found that I typically have about a cup of egg mixture left over after dipping all of the slices. It works well for me to refrigerate it along with the toast and pour the remaining mixture over the bread after it has been in the refrigerator for an hour or two.

Very good and so simple. Much better than waiting to cook it slice by slice. I didn't use any half and half, instead using just 2 cups of milk. And I also added some cinnamon. I poured the leftover on top but next time I don't think I will as I found the center kind of soggy. The topping reminded me of cinnamon buns! MMMmmmmm!!

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch.  It was very good--I used the ingredients as they were listed, but I used a loaf Texas toast which soaked up a lot of the egg mixture.  I too spread the toast out on 2 cookie sheets and they were lightly browned when I pulled them out.  The topping mixture did seem to make the toast come out soggy in spots, but no one seemed to mind.  This recipe is a keeper!

The flavor in this dish great, but I had a mess as far as presentation. I had enough egg mixture to make a whole loaf of bread. So I used 2 9 1/2 x11 casserole dishes and 1 8x8. I made the mistake of overlapping the bread slices, which did not serve well. I think next time, I will try it by layering two pieces of bread directly on top of each other and making sure to keep other slices separate, so they will serve as nice (thick) french toast slices. I will definitely try these again.

We tried this just before Easter because we were looking for a quick breakfast/brunch idea to serve company.  It was quick and easy to prepare and tasted wonderful!

Made this for Christmas morning brunch.  It was so nice to have something that you can start preparing the night before.  The family really enjoyed it.  The only problem seemed to be that it didn't cook evenly throughout.  The edges were brown & crispy & close to being burned but the middle was still undercooked.  Will definitely try this one again & alter the cooking time/method.  Also split this into two pans, one with nuts & one without.  Sprinkled with cinnamon before adding brown sugar & nut mixture.  Very good - thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  What a hit for Christmas brunch!  I did reduce the amount of milk & half & half, so that it wouldn't be soggy!  Will make again!

Made with 1 cup of milk & 1 cup of cream & still had so much extra batter that I poured it into the pan to soak all night.  It was all soaked up by morning & tasted wonderful, if a little too sweet for my liking.  It would have been a good side dish instead of the main breakfast item.

Easy to make and very yummy! I made this dish for a party and it turned out wonderful! I got many requests for the recipe.  I made it with texas toast and it was perfect- I did not change a thing! I would make again and again!

Didn't really come out the way I had hoped.  I started out using a 9x13 pan but I don't see how you could fit all the bread in just one pan.  So, I divided it into two pans.  Next time I think I'll try using a large cookie sheet and start checking on the baking 10 minutes into the process. I only gave this recipe 3 stars because it was a bit on the sweet side and the cooking time made it way too crunchy.  Maybe it'll be better next time.

I'm sure that this would have been delicious, had I not burned it.  The inside of the bread(where it wasn't a flaming burnt mess) Was delicious.  It needed no syrup or anything.  I would recommend not cooking it on a black pan, I think that was what caused it to burn. I will definatly try this recipe again.  It was easy to make and I'm sure it will be 5 stars when it isn't burnt!

This turned out perfect the first time I made it.  The second time I made it I forgot the milk so it turned out more like carmel sticky buns, but the same crowd still loved it! I will make it again.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the instructions the first time and found it to be a little too soggy for my taste.  I will definitely make it again as the flavor was delicious, but will reduce the liquid portion.

My family likes this recipe very much. Because  members of my family do not care for nuts I left those out and the recipe was still excellent.  I plan to make this for a two day family reunion because it is so quick and convenient.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I was at the beach with friends when I made this and everyone loved it.  I couldn't find regular french bread, so I bought italian sandwich bread and just ripped it into pieces.  Then, as others suggested, poured the egg mixture over the top.  It was delicious.

My family thought this was really great so I guess I will continue to make it.  I, however, did not care for it at all.  Too sweet for my taste.

This was the best French toast, I've ever had in my entire life.  Initially I used walnuts because I didn’t have any pecans, and it was just ordinary.  Then I purchased some pecans, and it was awesome.  I think I cooked it too long, because it was slightly dry.  The toast stuck to the pan, so I think that you must spray non-stick spray in the pan prior to cooking.  I made this dish for my department retreat on Friday January 17, 2002 and everyone raved about it.  I'm making it again on Monday January 20,2002.

I made this three times recently, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year. It was a big hit everytime. I did not have half-and-half so I substutied heavy whipping cream, and added a little nutmeg and cinnamon to the mixture. For the topping I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and left out the pecans. This is so easy to make and most delicious.

Good!  It's more like dessert for breakfast.  I had to bake mine longer than the recipe recommended.
