These are great cookies!  They're a bit more substantial than a regular macaroon & the Hershey's kiss compliments the taste very nicely.  They also make a nice presentation...were a big hit at my work Christmas party!  The only thing is...I suspect that the measurement for the cream cheese is supposed to be 8oz, not 3 oz. (I used 8oz & it came out great)

Only a few cookies make it to my all-time favorites list, and this is one of them!  They are attractive and oh-so-yummy!  I have also make them using the mini-kisses - I put three on each cookie.  Highly recommended.

These were pretty good.  They are chewy and pretty to look at.  They taste good with or without the chocolate on them.  I didn't have any kisses and so I put three milk chocolate chips on each.  Thanks!

I got this recipe from a co-worker last year and they have become one of our favorites.  My daughter who doesn't care for coconut loves these.  The almond flavor is so good with the coconut.  Made exactly as written except I did have to bake longer.  Must be my oven.

This recipe sounds heavenly, except I need to limit my fats & sugars.  Wonder if you can substitute fat free/egg free/sugar free products without causing a total flop?

These cookies are terrific, they have become one of my all time favorites.  I love that they have a more substantial cookie-ness to them and aren't sickly sweet.

This is our family's favorite macaroon recipe.  I've also made these using a 2 inch cookie scoop, and then I make a large depression in the center of each cookie.  I bake them this way and when cool, place a scoop of ice cream in the depression, and top with hot fudge sauce.  mmmmmmm

LOVE these cookies....  I use regular vanilla and SEMI SWEET choclate stars instead of milk choclate.  These give the cookies a much richer flavor!

These cookies are amazing!!  I used the 3 oz of cream cheese instead of the 8 oz and they were perfect.  An earlier review said maybe it was a mistake?   They taste like Almond Joy candy bars without the nuts....

SICKENINGLY SWEET... The combination of the mounds sweetened coconut and the milk chocolate kisses made these cookies so sweet I threw them out.  My 15 year old daughter and I both found them inedible!  I'll try again using unsweetened coconut and dark chocolate kisses.

i thought these were just okay.  they were definately coconutty, but the cookie part wasn't sweet enough for me.  Very messy to roll the dough & coat w/ coconut.  i doubt i will make this recipe again.
