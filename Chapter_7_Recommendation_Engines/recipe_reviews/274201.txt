So much easier than yeast buns and just delish. I added a cup of raisins to the dry ingredients before adding milk. The family loved it.

I did make a few changes in the amounts of filling and topping.   I used less of each.

No amount of kneeding made the dough workable. It stayed soft and inelastic no matter what i did. I finally spread it on parchment paper--no need for a rolling pin, it was practically self leveling.

The amount of butter in the filling gave me pause, but those star reviews convinced me to try it.  I should have realized from the photo there would be scraps of dough swimming in butter. Also, too much cinnamon! 

By a cunning use of spatulas and extra flour i was able to scrape the dough off the parchment paper and into a "roll" that, because the dough had no elasticity, spread out into a grub-like shape. The butter in the filling never set up, so I wound up rolling the grub into a Bundt pan to make a ring cake.

Which might have worked except for all the butter. The dough cooked to pieces, and the soup that came out couldn't even be called monkey bread. If I could give this recipe fewer stars I would.

Way too much sugar and filling. I would cut the filling in half. If you love a sugar rush, this one is for you. Tastes very good.
