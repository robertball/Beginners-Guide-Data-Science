Very tastey. I had some slightly overripe bananas that I wanted to use up and I wanted something healthier than bread. It came out great. A few changes though: I had no applesauce so I left that out, I used 3 mashed bananas and 1/4th cup honey instead of the sugar, then I added a little nutmeg to the brown sugar/cinnamon mix. Def will keep thisin mind next time I have bananas

Good Stuff!  I added fresh blueberries, dried apples and walnuts, replaced 2% milk with skim and used 2 bananas because I didn't have applesauce.   I had enough to fill the 8x8 and make a few muffins.  They were moist and delicious.   I have tried a few ways to make "healthy" breads from old bananas and so far this is the best.

So good! Tastes like banana bread, but a little more healthy ;-)
Comes out with a cakey consistency, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm!

I really liked this recipe. Instead of using bananas I added diced apples and I really prefer it over the bananas. Very moist and freezes very well.

This was great.  I added 2 bananas because they were small.  This was perfectly sweet for my taste buds.

This recipe has become such a hit in our home! I make it every week. It's such a good hearty, eat while you're heading out the door kind of meal that serves our family well. I added fresh blueberries in my latest batch and it's to die for.

I had recently made Beckys Baked Oatmeal, from this site, and really liked it. I wanted to see if I could find a similar recipe with less sugar. This recipe had half that. It just didnt work for me. Personally, I felt it wasnt quite sweet enough despite finding most foods with sugar too sweet. It also had a more gummy and rubbery texture that was almost slightly eggy tasting. I only have the comparison of the one recipe, though, which went over very well in my home.

Made this for my husband who loves oatmeal. I didnâ€™t have applesauce so I used 3 large very ripe bananas. Then added blueberries like suggested. It turned out wonderful. And make it on Monday and then you have it all week when your trying to get to work.

I followed the recipe to a t and it was very good. I do think in my oven I'll have to increase the cooking time to 40-45 minutes next time. I liked it best warm right out of the oven, but it was still yummy the next day. I'm using as a breakfast bar, but I could see serving it as a dessert too, especially if served warm with a little bit of whipped cream on top.

I added 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 tsp of Allspice.  It came out yummy.  I baked it for the prescribed 35 minutes at 375.  I think maybe needs to go for 40 minutes.

I made this wanting a healthy snack for the morning without too much sugar. I followed the recipe pretty closely only adding some extra cinnamon to the mix. it was fairly bland except for the chocolate chips I added.  Despite saying all that,  I really like the recipe just don't expect a fluffy banana bread made with oats.

Yum! Added blueberries and peanut butter and they totally held up. Not dry and claggy like the baked oatmeal in my college dining hall, yet not runny either.

I used an extra banana instead of the applesauce and added  2 tsp. flax seed in the batter (undetectable but healthy). Also used walnuts with the topping, but I don't recommend that. Notes for Next time: add mini chocolate chips or chopped apples as others suggested. Maybe try baking in a 9x9 pan. I chose this recipe over others because of the fiber content. Family thought it was so-so but I will try it again with changes.  Primarily would like a grab-and-go morning snack. This is a dense consistency as it is Baked Oatmeal, had to increase bake time to 35-40 min.

I will make this again and again. YES I made a change or two. 
1. Used extra banana instead of applesauce
2. used 1tsp Real Vanilla  1tsp Real coconut flavor
3. Used 1/4 cup shaved unsweetened coconut 
4. Used 1/4 cup fine unsweetened coconut
(Wanted a more tropical flavor. May add a bit of canned pineapple in the next batch to try)
Made a double batch and was glad I did they were amazing!!!

Tastes just like banana bread! Both my toddlers like having this for breakfast or a snack. I did have to bake mine for closer to an hour so it wouldn't be so sticky.

I toasted some coconut to add to the mix and added a handful of chocolate chips for my picky-eater toddler.
