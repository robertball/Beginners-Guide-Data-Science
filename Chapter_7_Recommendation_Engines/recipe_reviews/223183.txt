This was so yummy! I doubled the recipe for my July 4th party, and everyone loved it. I wouldn't change a thing.

Very easy to make and was happily surprised to see that it would sit for 24 hours and still be good (in fridge when not being served)

This was very good but next time I will skip the tequila and use something like cointreau to take away the tequila flavor. Otherwise a light & refreshing sangria that is perfect for a summer day. Thanks for sharing.

It was awesome. Instead of tonic water, I use sprite. Taste great. Refreshing.
