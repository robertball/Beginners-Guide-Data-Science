muffin was soft but didn't take 20min at 400 more like 13 min and the muffin itself had no flavor should have taken previous advice and added more spices. wouldn't make again.

I added a dash of the following spices:nutmeg,ginger,cinnamon and clove. The muffins came out great, I think they would have been bland without the spices though. I cut my frozen cranberries in half and coated them in sugar as directed, but they are still quite tart. Overall they were light and fluffy, I would make these again.

These turned out fabulous. I left out the lemon peel because I didn't have any and they still turned out wonderfully. I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe was just okay. It's not very sweet if that's what you're looking for -try a different recipe. I feel that the amount of milk that is called for is waaay off. I had to add about 3/4 c more and they were still dense. I did add cinnamon and vanilla so they taste a bit better. Over all this is a good basic recipe, but I'll be trying a new one in the future.

These are sooo good...I used Orange Juice instead of Milk, not sure you could really taste the difference, but it wasn't bad either!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an Excellent Recipe. I added a extra 1/2 cup of cranberries though as i like the tartness I also added 1/2 teaspoon of Ginger a touch of nutmeg and some cinnamon. Very easy to make. Very Delicious

This is an excellent recipe. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger since I had to leave out the pecans (didn't have any) and the flavour was delicious.       I also had to add an extra splash of milk when I was combining the ingredients (before adding the lemon zest and cranberries) since it was far too dry and not sticking together.      I highly recommend either keeping a close eye on them while they are baking or cooking them at 350 degrees. I cooked mine at 400, took them out after 19 minutes, and the sides and bottoms were all burnt.      Besides this, the muffins were excellent and I am definitely planning on using this recipe again. It made me 20 small/cupcake sized muffins.

These are so yummy and absolutely scrumptious, a big hit in this house, and I wouldn't change a thing!  I had somewhat of a stockpile of frozen cranberries and needed to find a way to start using them up.  This is just the ticket!  I didn't use lemon peel (didn't have any), and I baked the muffins at 350 instead of 400.  Other than these small changes I followed the recipe as written and they came out perfect.  5 stars!

We really enjoyed these muffins.  I followed the suggestion of adding cinnamon (1/2t), nutmeg (1/2t), ginger (1/4t) and cloves (1/4t) and didn't add the lemon zest because I didn't have any.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  The muffin is almost cake-like, very light and so good!!

Really good muffins. I stuck to the recipe including the lemon zest.  I plan on re-using this recipe when holiday company come and I don't think I will change a thing.

Wow! were these ever good.  My husband ate them with applesauce but I liked them with nothing on them.  I will also try the one with the spices but these were great and easy. I put the ingredients together in separate bowls last night and assembled and baked for breakfast.  Very easy and fast.
