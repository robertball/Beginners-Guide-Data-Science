Just tried this recipe using 1/2 of a ham hock I bought at the grocery.  The wine flavor is VERY strong; I might change it to 1c of stock (beef or vegetable) and only 1/2 cup of wine.  It would also probably be good if you added chopped carrots and celery.

I just finished making this - wonderful! The spice mixture is perfect to perk up the beans. I didn't have any meat on the bone to use, so I just used two chicken breasts, using half the spices as a rub for the meat before browning the chicken in a little olive oil on the stovetop. Delicious!

We really enjoyed this soup and will definitely make it again.  I used two smoked turkey legs instead of the beef bone and, based on another reviewer's comments about the wine being overpowering, I reduced the red wine measurement to 3/4 cup, which was perfect.  The cooking time of 3 to 4 hours is nowhere near long enough, though.  I cooked this on low for 10 hours and the beans were just right, except the skins were a bit tough.  Next time I think I'll hold off on adding the salt until about an hour before serving, since adding salt too early when cooking beans can cause the skins to be tough (I totally forgot about this until after I'd already put the salt in).

Prepared this today and it was enjoyed by everyone, including our dogs. I substituted Cranberry juice for the red wine and in place of the roast bone I used an one pound roast, that I broke up four hours into cooking. For the seasoning salt I used Tony Chachere's Salt Free Creole Seasoning. This recipe is a keeper!

This certainly did not come out great at all. Disappointing for sure. I did as stated to let beans soak overnight, but I didn't boil them (as others said I should have). The beans finally softened after 24 hours. The broth was not tasteful to me, somewhat bitter. The beans were bitter before they softened. I added vegetable soup mix. It just did not work for me. Next time I will boil the beans and then let them sit in water overnight.
