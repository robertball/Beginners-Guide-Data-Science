I like putting a handful of my favorite trail mix in my breakfast oatmeal, so I figured I would like this. I would cut back on the maple syrup next time, but that's my preference. I used mixed nuts instead of walnuts because that's what I had. I think the recipe and name are clear since it is made in a bowl. It's kind of like eating a trail mix bar that isn't cooked yet; very tasty. Good for a high energy snack.

Okay, I am slightly confused to what "warm" trail mix means exactly? I think of trail mix as being a dry handheld snack. I made this recipe as follows, just subbing pomengranite juice for the grape. After 30 seconds and even a minute, the ingredients stay wet. Well, it has a good flavor anyhow as it is not too sweet and has a variety of textures. Just plan to eat this mix with a spoon.
