Excellent!!  Looks even better with more whipped cream peaked on top of the chocolate pudding layer and then shaved chocolate curls on top of that.  Have made it 3 times in less than a month and plan on making another for Christmas 2001.  Who doesn't like chocolate!!

This certainly isn't the prettiest pie/dessert I've ever made (three stars for that) but what it lacks in presentation is more than made up for in taste. Hubby, especially, loved this, but we both thought the coffee flavor was a little strong. Would prefer this with less or even without it altogether. This is a light dessert, which might explain why we both went back for seconds.  Or maybe it's just really good! I left the nuts out for hubs' sake and actually I think I liked it better that way anyway. It would seem a shame to destroy that light as a feather, melt in your mouth texture with little crunchy interruptions.  The biggest criticism I have for this is that it's difficult to get out of the pan neatly, in spite of greasing the pan.  I don't know what the solution to that would be, if there even is one, but it sure made a difference in terms of how it looks on the plate when served. But the fact that this "angel" pie really does taste like manna from heaven kind of makes you let its imperfect presentation slide.

I hate to be the one to tell you ... BUT, this pie was being made by my mother Beulah Boswell in her restaurant in Edenton, North Carolina in the 1950's! 
She, eventually began using a commercial product, Rich's Whip Topping as a substitute for the cream in the 1970's.
It truly is sinfully delicious!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The chocolate didnt set and was runny. Couldnt get the meringue out of dish, but the taste was very good
