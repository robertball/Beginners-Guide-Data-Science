salmon and dill...outstanding...I like garlic, but onion is good too.  ONLY cook til opaque...400 for 25 minutes is way long oftimes....use two forks to pull apart at 10 minutes, and likely it is opaque already...if not add 1-2 minutes as needed.  overcooked fish are dry and tasteless.  needs to be cooked very carefully.  The thicker, the longer...tail pieces of salmon are best tasting and cook quicker.  Try sour cream/mayo half and half  plus fresh dill as a sauce, yummm...

I made this with fresh dill (about a ¼ cup or more) and fresh minced sweet onion (Vidalia, ¼ cup), and a lot of lemon, sautéed the butter, dill, onion, lemon quickly first then poured over salmon, served it with a cool cucumber salad and lemon dill rice, everyone was amazed

Delicious! Definitely a restaurant quality meal. I did substitute mayo for the butter. (A tip from another salmon recipe) I also marinaded the salmon in lemon juice for 20 minutes beforehand to cut the strong "fishy" taste. (A tip I learned about today... we found it worked!)
I am going to use this recipe again next week. Thanks!

I love this recipe- I season the salmon with salt and pepper, add some fresh dill (or dried), squirt one lemon juice on it, put the salmon in a foil packet with chopped up onion, a dab of butter, drizzle of olive oil, and the quartered lemon I used for juice. Delicious- great with green peas cooked with olive oil, onion, and garlic and baked sweet potato cubes...

I didn't measure anything and used lemmon pepper. First I sprinkled salt on both sides of the filet, then covered the top evenly with onion powder, dill, and lemon pepper. It turned out fabulous. The flavors of the seasonings are mild enough to really let the taste of the salmon through. I don't know if the butter did anything for the fish though. This tasted wonderful, but it might be because I was using fresh king salmon from Alaska that a fisherman friend of ours brought back for us.

Super recipe. I tried fresh dill the first time but it didn't have much flavor so I made it again and the dried dill was MUCH better. I would make this recipe again. it was great!

Really quick and easy! And DELICIOUS!  LOW FAT option I used was to eliminate the butter and just spray with cooking spray, it still tasted wonderful!  Thanks again for a great recipe!

I used 2 very thick salmon steaks and ended up using just half of the pepper and slightly less onion powder and dill weed than the recipe called for.  Still, the steaks were generously sprinkled with all seasonings and it turned out just perfect.  It was very moist and delicious and my husband even commented that it was the moistest salmon he ever had, better than what he's been served in restaurants (where it was just too dry).  Even my 4 year old had seconds.  We didn't even need the tartar sauce and lemon; it was tasty by itself.  To make the clean-up a breeze too, I lined the baking pan with a sheet of foil.  I will be making this again; thanks!

I enjoyed this. I did a add liberal squeeze of lemon. As for baking time, I always follow Mike Fiction's advice from another salmon recipe on AR: "I would specify that cooking salmon is not as simple as placing in oven for x amount of time. You should cook salmon based on thickness. Bake uncovered in a preheated 450°F oven for 4-6 minutes for each .5 inch of thickness." That advice has never failed me :)

Simple and delicious!  My boyfriend and I made this dish and substituted canola oil for the butter to make it even more heart healthy.

Excellent flavor, easy to prepare.  Like others, I used chopped fresh onion instead of powder. Very moist, wonderful salmon flavor, enhanced but not overpowered by the dill and onion.

Super recipe. But I vote for using fresh onion in place of onion powder.  Also, skip the salt and rub the fish with soy sauce instead.   The rule of thumb for doneness is, 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Salmon fillets or steaks are typically done in less than 20 minutes.

DELICIOUS!  I've never been able to make fish right.  This was easy, fast, and delicious.  Hint to others, soak the salmon in milk first...it takes away any fish odors that may be present.

Not bad-a little dry though, recommend using half the spices indicated in recipe and put tinfoil over the top of the salmon to keep in moisture.

Easy and tasty! I ended up using onion salt since that 's what I had on hand and I already put some salt on the fish, so it was a tad bit salty, but still very good. Next time, I'll omit the salt if I use onion salt! I also cook my fish like other reviewers mentioned, 5-6 minutes per 1/2-inch of thickness at 450 degrees.

I do mine a bit differently.  I rub olive oil on a nice platter, rub the excess on the salmon, sprinkle with a bit of sea salt, fresh cracked pepper, and fresh or dried dill weed, then slow bake it in the oven.  I use the olive oil for a better fat for dietary reasons.

Very simple salmon recipe- and quite delicious. Modifications I made included using olive oil in lieu of butter, and cooking for approx. 10 minutes instead of 20. Also, we sprinkled lemon juice liberally over fillets after cooking. Yum.

Made this exactly the way it says and it came out perfect! I watched the time, as my oven runs hot, but this needed the 25 minutes to my surprise. I do think it matters the thickness of your fish- my fish filets were fairly thick- so always check at the lowest time first :) Excellent recipe! Even my 1 year old ate it...yey!

This recipe is fantastic! I can't believe it took me this long to review it...I've been making it pretty much every week for a couple months :). I have never been a big salmon fan, but I started looking for different salmon recipes to try because I knew it was something we should be eating for the health benefits. After I tried this recipe, I stopped searching & it's now the only one I use. I make a couple of minor changes when I make it...I squirt a little bit of lemon juice on the salmon before seasoning, & instead of using the pats of butter, I just spray some "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray on it after the lemon juice, then add the seasonings, & then cook each fillet individually in a foil packet (keeps it moist & saves clean up!). It is a wonderful recipe that made a salmon lover out of me! :)

Delicious, quick and easy. I marinated my salmon steaks in fresh lemon juice as well, to remove that fishy smell. Instead of onion powder, I diced up a 1/4 of an onion and sauteed it in the 2 tablespoons of butter, add in the dill, too! In the meantime, I salted both sides of the fish and added lemon pepper, too! I drizzled the butter/onion dill mixture over the fish and popped them in the oven for 10 minutes, then broil for 5 to brown the onions on top. YUMM! I have made this two Fridays in a row! LOL

Delicious and easy.  I used fresh dill and added a bit of fresh garlic.  The flavors did not overpower the Salmon and the butter added just the right amount of richness.  Made this as part of our Christmas Eve Feast of the Seven Fishes and everyone enjoyed it.

This was delicious and very easy to make!  Tasted just as good as any restaurant...I followed a few of the suggestions left by other reviewers (mayo, fresh onion, lime) and it turned out great!  It seemed to take a bit longer to cook than others were suggesting.   So you may want to keep an eye on it.  Also made a dill sauce to go along with it.  50/50 sour cream/mayo, plenty of dill, and garlic salt!  Even my 2 yr old son enjoyed it!

Amazing!!! Thank you for giving me a lowfat option that is delicious at the same time.  I used 1/2 fresh chopped onion instead of the onion powder and generously sprinkled all the fillets with lemon juice.  Taste like something you'd get at a restaurant.

This is great, except I have superpowered Dill weed.. lol.  I will have to reduce it next time, but otherwise, it's yummy.  I subsituted fresh chopped onion instead of the onion powder, as I didn't have any (only put in a tiny bit though). Also, I put in a couple of squirts of lemon juice.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Very quick and simple. It gives a lovely added flavour to the salmon.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing John! I think I will try it on the bbq.

Great recipe and very easy!.  Try using dried dill rubbed into fillet and cover fillet with fresh dill.  Use caution when baking to not overcook.  Check after 15 minutes.  use two forks to lift and see if it flakes apart.

This was a very good meal.  You have to be careful not to over cook your salmon however.  My 1.8# salmon only took 14 minutes to cook so I imagine that cooking for the entire time would dry this out. I would recommend adding a little bit of fresh lemon also.  Overall this was good!  I will be making it again.

I haven't cooked fish very many times but a friend gave me some fresh dill and suggested salmon.  This was so good, my husband asked if we could make it for his mother!  I added juice of 1/2 lemon, microwaved it with diced sweet onion & fresh dill before pouring over fish and baking.  Made tartar sauce with homemade Greek yogurt, mayo, relish & dill.  Excellent meal served w/ rice.

This recipe was simple, flavorful and absolutely delicious.  The salmon came out perfectly cooked and paired great with some steamed green beans.  We didn't use butter.  Instead we just sprayed the salmon with butter flavored cooking spray.

I make a similar recipe with drizzled honey mustard then sprinkle with dried dill. Very tastey. The woman who said she soaks her salmon for 20 min. in lemon juice to take out fishy taste before cooking, is  eating bad or old salmon,  it should taste sweet,and fresh it should never be fishy! I feel bad she has not had a "true salmon" experience.

I could not believe how easy this dish was, and how delicious it was too!  I took it to a potluck, and everyone was impressed with it.  Even my room mate who doesn't normally like salmon said it was good.  It is also very healthy, which is a big plus.

I enjoyed this and my family did too. I am on a very strict diet and this fits in it perfectly. I rated it 4 stars because I did not have to cook it nearly as long as the recipe states. It may be because, although I used 1 lb. of fish, it was 5 individual pieces which wouldn't take as long as 1 or 2 large pieces.

This was delicious! I melted the butter in a small skillet and added 2 cloves of minced garlic, plus the dried dill. I cooked this for about 5 minutes at medium temp. I then added the lemon juice and poured it over the salmon. I also basted the fish several times. 18-20 minutes should suffice, 25 is much too long. Save the sauce in the bottom of the pan and pour it over the salmon. Amazing!

Salmon will now be a regular dish in our house because of this recipe!

My modifications: Drizzled olive oil instead of using butter, fresh dill, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder. My fillet was done in about 13 minutes.

Good and easy. We eat alot of salmon, actually it is the only fish my family will eat and coming up with variations is hard. This one hit the spot. Thanks

Made this is for my picky family which consists of my 90 year old Grandma, Mother, Husband & 4 year old daughter. All of them loved it and even had 2nds. It is really hard to please all of these people and this recipe achieved that.

I used garlic powder instead of the onion and I squeeze some fresh lemon after I took it out of the oven. Another time I cook one, I arranged slices of lemon on top of the salmon before I put it in the oven.

Very simple yet super yummy! I used fresh frozen dill, which I'm sure improved the taste even more, but my husband and I both thought this was delicious. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

A nice & simple way to cook a healthy salmon dish - as long as you substitute the butter for lite mayo or marg.  Recommend cooking for 10-15 minutes only (checking for tenderness @ 10 minutes & then every few minutes).

My first time cooking Salmon. Perfect! Better than some I've had in resturaunts. I will probably be making this about once a week. I put in cloves of garlic instead of onion powder. Thank you for this simple and delicious recipe!

This recipe is SOOO good! I have made it a few times, and what I do now is not even measure the ingredients... I just cover the salmon with the butter, and then spinkle the dill and onion powder until it's covered to my liking. Delicious and easy!

This is the way I season salmon except that I use white pepper instead of black and since cooking for one doesn't rate turning on the oven I saute in butter stove-top. EXCELLENT!

Oh my gosh good!!!!! The best salmon I ever had. 
I had very thick steaks, so it took 30 minutes at 400 degrees to get it done. Instead of onion powder I laid fresh onion slices over the top as it baked. I used a drizzle of olive oil instead of butter. And it was great!

I needed something quick for dinner and had a Salmon Fillet. Tried this recipe and was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. The only change I made was I omitted the salt because I'm on a low sodium diet. Thanks.

Absolutely tender, moist and delicious. I did use olive oil instead of butter to moisten on top. Also used Tartar Sauce III (this site).

Very good.  I used onion salt as i didn't have onion powder and then omitted the salt but really it did need it.  May try to marinate in lemon juice just to see how that tastes.  The seasoning was very good.  I used lemon pepper as another person suggested and it was great.

I'm new to salmon making, so i liked the simplicity of this recipe.  Like others have said, it seems like its a LOT of spices and might be too much, but its really not.  This was easy and didn't take very many ingredients, most of which I had on hand which is a plus.  It was SO good.  I added a squeeze of lemon to mine, which really complimented the dill flavor but no tartar sauce.  It was perfect as is.  Great recipe!

I just made this. I followed the directions exactly except brushed mayo on the fish before spices.. I used garlic powder in addition to the others.. I should have used more salt because this was very bland. more salt would have made it better!  I also chopped some onion and put that on top.. pretty good, will make again with more salt and more onion/garlic powder :)

I used the advice of a previous reviewer and only cooked for 10-12 minutes and it came out perfect! Any longer and it would have been dry. Note that the recipe calls for a lot of seasoning and when I was putting it on the fish I thought it was too much... it wasn't! I thought it gave a good flavor... I will definitely use this recipe again!

I love this recipe.  It's so easy to make, but it tastes fantastic.  I bake it wrapped in foil with lemon and onion wedges as another reviewer suggested, and it is so moist it basically falls apart.  Plus, no mess to clean!  I also totally elimated the butter.  It isn't necessary.  This is a staple at our house.

I have been making this recipe for years... since it appeared in an early AllRecipes book.  It's SO easy, fast, and downright delicious!  Guests rave... especially the day I whipped it up after canning jam all afternoon.  Easy.  Only changes I made: (1) always use defrosted fish, (2) used half amt of onion pwd and added same of garlic pwd, (3) melted butter and drizzled over top, (4) baked for 10 min and then checked every 2-5 min after that to see if firm and pretty opaque at thickest parts, (5) removed from oven and covered with foil to steam while finishing rest of dinner prep.  LOVE IT, John!  Thanks for the keeper.

Judging from past experience, the cooking time on this is for frozen (appx 8+ oz) fillets.  Otherwise, shorten cooking time.  Also, use hands to coat with mayonaise instead of butter.  Helps to keep them moist.

This was good, I'll make it again. It tasted just a tad salty to me, I think it was the salt/onion powder combo. Next time I will reduce or omit the salt... it's not necessary.

I made this recipe with only one change, which was adding a small, diced yellow onion instead of the onion powder.  My husband and I really enjoyed it, and we will have this recipe again.

I don't eat Salmon so when I try a new recipe I just pray that it's edible. So when I am told that this was the best Salmon ever it deserves a 5 star rating!

I am just learning to cook. This salmon was awesome! I didn't have onion powder so I used garlic powder. Increased the dill and added lemon afterwards. I might use less salt and butter next time. Will definatly be feeding this to my picky boyfriend!

I know I've rated other salmon recipes 5 stars, but this is one of THE best. I didn't change a thing, and my husband loved it! He kept saying, I love this, I love this...  I did have to cook a few minutes longer because my fillets were a little thick. Great with steamed baby carrots and roasted new red potatoes.

This recipe is not only easy but delicious!!  The only change I made was to squeeze a little lemon juice over the salmon before sprinkling the spices.  It came out wonderful.  Thanks.

This was good, but I added a lot more dill than it calls for.  Make sure you cook it very thoroughly.  It also needed tartar sauce.  I did not think the lemon made much of a difference.

I am a Salmon Conosor.(cant' spell that word:))
and I loved this recipe. Very good. I don't like too much flavor to overpower the salmon itself...so this was good. Thank you!

Don't get me wrong, this recipe is wonderful; the flavor outstanding!  BUT, the stated cook time is so very off.  My filets were almost over done at 10 to 12 minutes.  Check  the reviews, because many agree about the faulty cook time.  I can't rate this with 5 stars as the recipe is written, because of that. (I need to watch my fat intake so I lightly brush with EVOO in place of the butter and it works just fine!)

Absolutely the BEST!!  Not only are the flavors put together perfectly, but the fact I can use the dried spices instead of having to go to the store is absolutely priceless.  I've made this a few times since I first tried it out and haven't made one chage!

I was worried about making this because I never cook fish, but was really happy with how it turned out.  Instead of pepper though, I used lemon pepper. It tasted really good, even my three year old loved it.

This was really good.  I did what another person suggested and set the timer on the oven for 10 min. and kept checking it. My piece was a little over 1lb. and it took almost 20 mins. (Remember that it will continue to cook after you remove it from the oven) and it was perfect! I also mixed 1/2 mayo with 1/2 sour cream and some dried dill together and used as a sauce. This was my first time cooking salmon and it came out really good!

I hate fish - plain and simple, but I make it often for my husband who loves it! This recipe does not disappoint. I had to change two things - fresh onions instead of onion powder and tarragon instead of dill - FABULOUS!  I made my own mustard sauce, and yes, I ate some myself, and for fish, it really was WONDERFUL!  YUM!!

Made this tonight and it was a big hit with my family.  I had to omit the pepper because my husband doesn't like it.  Other than that, I followed this recipe exactly.  Very quick, easy, and delicious meal to make through the work week.  I served rice and steamed green beans with it.  Yummy!

I thought it was good ..... just not great. I followed the recipe exactly ....... with a shorter cook time to avoid drying out the salmon. I think there are other, better, recipes on this site for quick and delicious salmon..... and serving with tartar sauce is just wrong.
UPDATED REVIEW: Tried it again but this time I used several tips from other reviews and it came out really good (not 5 stars, but very good). The changes were: I put fresh lemon juice on it for about 2 hours before cooking. then I put a coating of mayonnaise, followed by a sprinkling of lemon pepper, dill, cayenne, and sea salt. it baked for 20 minutes at 400 and was very moist and tasty. MUCH BETTER this time.

Turned out wonderful.  It always amazes me how a few simple seasonings make something taste so good.  The buttery taste of the salmon was not overpowered by the dill at all.  I will definetly make again.

Absolutely delicious. We used others advice and added garlic powder(and therefore cut onion powder in half.) We realized after we started we didn't have lemons on hand and we don't like tartar sauce...and the dish was still remarkable. It was easy and will be fun to play with. And some others said that 10-15 minutes was enough time. However, we live in high altitudes and checked from 10 minutes beyond. It took the entire 25 minutes to cook. Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmm, I LOVE this. Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out soooo good! I love dill, so smelling the dill as it baked was very very nice, and it gave the fish such a nice flavour.

I really like this recipe.  Since I've discovered it, it's the only way I'll cook salmon.  My whole family loves it, it's easy, fast, and so far has been foolproof--even for a "fish-phobic" cook like me!

EXCELLENT!!  I marinated the salmon in letter juice for about 10 min and also squeezed a lemon on top for extra flavor after it was cooked.  This recipe will definitely be repeated!!!

My husband loves salmon, but usually only likes it grilled.  Since it was raining the night I planned to make salmon, I couldn't grill outside.  So, I found this recipe, and I am glad I did.  It is delicious - so moist and flavorful.  My husband loved it too!  Definitely a keeper.

Note:  I doubled the dill and it was perfect.

This recipe was great!  It was also very easy.  The only thing I changed was the cooking temperature and time.  I changed it to 375* and 15 minutes to match the instructions on the bag of individually wrapped salmon steaks that I bought at Sam's Club.  Excellent!  This will become a regular at our house.

This was great. I didn't have any onion powder, so I substituted a small amount of garlic powder and added 2 green onions and a sprig of fresh lemon thyme (chopped fine). Delicious.

This recipe had three things going for it. Super fast, super easy and super good! The only thing I did differently was I used fresh dill. I'm not really sure how much I used but I put about half of one of those "Melissa's Fresh Herbs" packs on it. My salmon steak was huge so it needed it. Me and one of my daughter's are the only ones that like salmon. More for us. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent mixture of salt, pepper, onion, and dill.  Wow.  I am certainly impressed.  I hate fish, but with these ingredients on top it was sooo yummy.  I will definately be making salmon more, now.  I recommend this for people who want nutrition, but don't appreciate fish.

I prepared 15 pounds of salmon for an engagement party. The only adjustments were to spray the salmon before adding spices with olive oils, omitting the butter and using an outdoor gas grill for baking.  Total preparation time 10 minutes. The results were terrific.

Surprisingly delicious and simple!  This is a great recipe if you're looking to eat tasty salmon without the heavy cream sauce. Feel free to cut back on the butter if you're looking to be healthy.  I'd also recommend sprinkling a layer of the seasoning on the bottom of the pan before laying down the fish (if your fish is skinned on both sides).

I would never bake salmon for 25 minutes, that's way too long. It would be like cardboard. 
I've been making salmon like this for quite awhile, however, I don't add garlic or onion powder to it. 
 I always use salmon filet. On both sides, sprinkle a little Kosher salt, lemon pepper, dill and a sliver of butter and bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Perfect every time. My husband likes it a little crispy, so using the same recipe, I saute the salmon in a pan with just a small amount of butter atop the gas range. Very good either way.

I made this earlier and it turned out very well. My husband was insistent that it was better than any salmon he has tried from the restaurants near us. I will definitely be making this again. The salmon filets I used were fairly thick and cooking them for 25 minutes worked out perfectly. If you're using a thinner filet you may want to cook for slightly less time.

I thought this was a truly excellent salmon recipe, although I baked the salmon for only about 15 minutes as opposed to the 20-25 minutes suggested. The dried dill complimented the fish very well and adding a squeeze of fresh lemon juice when served, took this to "whole nother level". I also scattered a teaspoon of  panko bread crumbs on the fish before baking, to add texture.

This is my kind of recipe! Super simple and if you have good salmon you shouldn't need much in the way of additional flavors. I'll definitely be making this again.

Quick and easy.  Didn't have onion salt so used garlic salt instead.  Turned out yummy.

I omitted the onion powder as a personal preference and used fresh dill as I had it on hand. Fifteen minutes in a glass dish was perfect for me. Always check before the stated time so you won't overcook. I served with frsh green beans and a pumpkin risotto you bake in the oven and don't have to stir

Great salmon recipe! I love salmon!  Anyways, the baking time was a little long, but since i was baking some sweet potatoes to go along with dinner, I just baked for 15 min, and it game out delish.  Definitely will be making again as I try to eat fish once a week.

This is easy, healthy, and tasty.  I don't really feel like I need to measure out any of the ingredients.  I served kale chips on the side for a quick, light dinner.  My husband and daughter approved : )

My husband loved this meal! The dried dill weed really makes it delicious. This was my first time baking salmon, and I was quite please with how easy this recipe is to follow, and it is very quick!

Wow so easy and so good! Substituted olive oil for the butter. It was great by itself, but I served it with a simple hollandaise sauce and it was amazing!

This is very good, made with butter, or, suggested, with mayo. My salmon was in a 1 lb piece, and it did take 25 minutes to cook.

My family raved about this. Even my 3 year-old niece liked it. I skipped the onion powder, and drizzled it with olive oil instead of butter.

First time to cook Salmon and I fell in love with. Never thought dill would ever go well with fish. This recipe is very simple but yet delicious. However, I replaced the butter with olive oil and fried the salmon on a pan. I rubbed the fillets with salt/pepper/dill and olive oil, then placed the skin side directly on a hot pan. PERFECT! 
Then to make a sauce, I added lemon juice, vinegar and a bit of butter to the pan I used to fry the salmon.
Served it with jasmine rice, was a HIT!

This was super delicious!  I took the suggestions of others and just used spray on the salmon instead of the actual better which improve the health of it.  You could use either butter or olive oil spray, I don't think it would matter.  Then I sprinkled on two mixes - one a Pampered Chef Dill mix and one a Garlic Pepper McCormick mix.  I loved it and I'm the salmon eater of the family.

This was excellent.  I only made enough for everyone to have one piece.  I regret I didn't make more.  It was also quick and easy.  Not too many ingredients.  No marinating.  Thanks for sharing.

I wasn't sure if I would love this recipe but decided to try it anyway and boy was I glad! I prefer this recipe over the other two salmon recipes I use all the time. It's so good!!! Try it with the fat free tartar sauce recipe that has 5 stars. That stuff is dang good too!

This was excellent.  Unfortunately my husband would have preferred that the salmon be a bit caramelized on top.  I think that I might stick with doing it in the frying pan for this reason.

I had salmon but didn't really know what to do with it for a quick and easy dinner. So I tried this recipe and will surely make it again. It is delicious!! The only thing I changed was to use a chopped onion because I like to use it. Nevertheless, it was great!

I was a little hesitant because this recipe looked so easy. It turned out to be AMAZING. I added Creamy Dill Dip (found on this website) to the top, and it was perfect! Salmon was done in 12 minutes perfectly. Served with a salad and wild rice.

Wow.. easiest fish dish ever.  You can simply eyeball all the spices, add the butter and be ready.  Dish was ready in 25mins including cooking time and the salmon tasted great!

So good - I used fresh dill, and forgot the onion powder but didn't miss it.  I softened the butter, then mixed in dill, salt, pepper, and my favorite "tuscan" seasoning (rosemary based) and spread it all over the filets and cooked for 12 minutes.  Herb butter pats such as these can also be made in advance and frozen, then thawed/melted to use whenever you want fish.  A good way to tell if salmon is ready is if it starts to "sweat" out the white fats in between the meaty cracks (lol I don't know what else to call them).  This white stuff will start to sort of bubble.  That way you don't mess up a pretty filet by flaking it w/a fork.

Fantastic, very easy recipe.  I couldn't find my onion powder, so I used some garlic powder and dried onion flakes instead, which worked well.  It was a moist, delicately flavored dish that absolutely hit the spot.  My husband, who loves salmon but is picky about how it's prepared, said this was delicious!

This was excellent! I sauteed half of a chopped onion and 1 garlic clove in the butter.  Then stirred in all the spices and poured over the fillets.  Next time I will add lemon juice.  The dill sauce with 1/2 part mayo and 1/2 part sour cream was a great touch, with a tbsp of horseradish and tbsp of dill.

Very, very delicious.  I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was great.  Check the salmon periodically to make sure it doesn't overbake -- should be very moist.  Made with a rice pilaf and fresh green beans.

My mom wanted me to start learning how to cook, so I would be prepared for university when I'll be living on my own. This was an interesting and tasteful meal, and my mom and siblings really liked it and they want me to make it again once my whole family is gathered together. I added a bit of lemon juice at the end, though, to make it tastier. (:

This was awesome! I will definately make it again. It is so easy and comes out so flavorful and pretty. I baked it with lemon slices on top. I served it with the Horseradish Lemon Roasted Potatoes (from this site) and steamed asparagus. A great meal!

Ok, but not great.  The butter is an overkill, just get some marbled salmon and you won't need the butter at all.

I actually like the Grilled Salmon recipe on this site better (the one with brown sugar, soy, etc) but still giving five stars because it was very easy and tasty. Followed recipe pretty closely except added some garlic powder and used the Pampered Chef dill mix instead of plain dill. Also made a homemade dill butter and served with a pat of that on top. Very good.

First, I hate fish - of all kinds.  I never eat it, but my husband loves it and after 6 years together, I decided to finally fix a fish dish (and I vowed to try it).  My husband eats salmon all the time, so with the reviews, thought this would be the first one to try.  Well, it turns out that he only likes smoked salmon - in fact, hates any other salmon.  But, as a good husband, he ate his dinner and was VERY impressed:  "this is probably the best salmon I've ever had...restaurant quality".  The only substitution I made was with the butter...I used the "I can't believe it's not butter" spray on top of the fish instead of regular butter.  Oh, I didn't eat the fish...as I was preparing it, I smelled the 'fishy' smell and couldn't even bring myself to prepare a 2nd fillet for myself.

My entire family really likes this recipe.  To simplify it, I combined several batches of the dill/spice mix in a shaker and just toss it on with the butter whenever I want to make the dish.  It shortens the prep time greatly.  We don't use the tarter sauce...it has plenty of flavor without it.

I liked this better than my husband did.  I'd rather not add butter to a healthy fish recipe unless it really adds significantly to the taste.  I don't think it did in this dish.

I found this to be totally awesome!  I only made one slight adjustment.  I substuted onion powder with garlic powder.  So Yummy!  I baked the fish in an aluminium bag (renyolds makes them).  This helped to keep the fish moist.

So incredibly easy and tasty. I often don't gethome until 10pm, and this recipe helped me have a quick, tasty meal that didn't sit heavy in my stomach at such a late hour. At first I looked at the few seasonings and was a little doubtful that it would be flavorful, but it turned out fabulous. I used garlic powder instead of onion powder, and in my oven, the fish only needed 15 minutes to bake. I'll definately be making it again!

This is such a quick and delicious dinner! Even my 2 and 5 year old boys loved this. I will definitely make it again. Just a reminder to grease your pan and also if you're looking for lower fat, I think the butter could be cut in half. I only used half the amount of butter but basted it a couple times in the juices as it cooked. This is one of those keepers that I could see myself making once a week.

This recipe is simple, yet delicious. I add garlic powder and omit the butter. Excellent!

This was very good and healthy.  I didn't have onion powder, so I finely chopped 1/2 an onion, and baked the fish on top of the onions. My DH loved it, and he's not a big fish eater.

Great recipe.  I cooked a 1 inch thick filet at 450 degrees for 11 minutes.  Probably could have used an extra minute or two.  Also, substituted 1/4 onion instead of powder, sauteed it with butter, lemon, dill, salt, pepper, and a little chardonnay.  Came out delicious.

Excellent but I only baked it for 10 minutes. I know from experience cooking fish like salmon that it only requires 10 minutes at 400.

It was really really good. 400 for 15 min was enough and did not use any butter.  Just sprinkled seasonings on top and made with quinoa and broccoli. Definitely going to make it again!

This recipe was super simple and super delicious.  It doesn't need the tarter sauce at all, it was great on its own.  I now consider this one of my favorite ways to prepare salmon.

This is very good and I am not a huge salmon fan.  My husband, however, is and he loved it, too. I will take a reviewer's suggestion and just spray with cooking spray next time rather than use butter to reduce fat and calories.

Delicious way to bake salmon. Instead of onion I use garlic and 1 or 2 Tbl. of melted light butter, which I brush on lightly before the seasoning.  I don't measure but I'm sure I don't use 1 tsp. of garlic and dill weed as we don't like strong seasonings. I just sprinkle lightly, and also add a little salt.  375 degrees for 30 minutes bakes a 1# salmon filet perfectly.

I needed something that I could prepare with what I had at home plus something that was also quick.  Oh, I'm so glad I tried it!  The salmon was gone before I could take a picture.  I used garlic powder instead of onion powder and Pampered Chef's Dill Weed Mix instead of plain dried dill weed.  Instead of butter, I used a mix of butter with canola oil.  My five-year-old niece gobbled it up, and my picky brother ate it all.  It's a success!

This didn't work well with salmon steaks. I think there wasn't enough surface area for the seasoning to stick to. It would be much better with fillets.

Good recipe.  I put some lemon juice on mine before all the other ingredients and let it sit  for about five minutes then wrapped it in tin foil with a space to vent.  Cooked for 20 then removed tinfoil for a minute or two before removing from the oven.  I ran out of onion powder so just went without but it still turned out pretty good.

This is my absolute favorite way to make salmon. The dill is perfect with the lemon and butter sauce. I seldom ever measure the dill- I just sprinkle it on until it looks good (I love dill).

If you're looking for a very mild seasoning to flavor your salmon, this one is for you.  I added a dash of garlic powder to the spices, mixed them in a bowl, sprinkled on both sides of the fish then drizzled a bit of melted butter on.  I only cooked for 18 minutes and that was too long - make sure to check early.  We will add this to our occasional fish recipes.  A nice change of pace from Asian or heavy sauced fish recipes.

I love this recipe.  I always over- baked salmon and this was so delicious.  The taste, texture was great.  I love the dill and use it often when I make fish. I will use this recipe again.   I was always concerned about purchasing fresh salmon because it is so expensive and until now I ended up giving it to our dog.

This recipe seems way too simple to be this good. I eat a lot of salmon and this is definitely one of my go to's. So many salmon recipes have a sweet flavor that it is also nice to switch it a bit for a more savory flavor.

Update: Often times I will now use Steelhead instead of salmon. Tastes like salmon but generally less "fishy". Cooks secret. People say "this is the best salmon I have ever had, what's your secret?" The secret is, its not salmon.

Really good! I used some alternatives that the other suggested in their comments.
1. Instead of butter I used light mayo (have to cut the calorie intake somehow!)
2. I used dry onion (simply because I didn't have any other option)
3. Instead of Salt I used Soja Sauce. 

Taste? Perfection!
And yes do listen to what the others say: Don't overcook! Mine was just about to get dry when I took it out.

I made this last night and it was delicious.  My family loved it.  One of my daughters just started the Paleo diet and I made a salmon steak with no butter for her.  It was still fantastic!  Defintely adding this to my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this, though I did switch the recipe up a little while keeping the flavors pretty much the same.  I cooked on stovetop rather than baking.  I mixed all seasonings into butter and added 1/2 tsp of lemon butter.  I smeared the seasoned butter over the flesh-side of the salmon while the skin side was down.  After 4 minutes I flipped the salmon to flesh-side down.  Flavor was outstanding.  Update: Made this again, followed same steps as last time but baked as directed and still great!

20 minutes at 400 was too long. I used olive oil on the glass baking pan and brushed the filets with it. I also added capers, chopped fresh green onions, and lemon. It was nice and tart and a great contrast to the steamed rice and veggies I served it with.

The seasoning worked wonderfully, I tried a suggestion on here of cooking with tin foil over the salmon to keep moisture in, but 20 minutes is still too far long for this recipe. Dries out the salmon. Next time I'll have to try it for a shorter time.

This is a great recipe-especialy for a quick week-night meal.   I used dill the first few times and then dedided to experiment.  Found it is great with a sprinkling of French Tarragon as well.  Nice light flavor.

Very easy and delicious! Thank you so much! I cooked 1lb of salmon on a glass pan, baked it on the upper rack of 400F oven for 20 minutes and also cover the salmon with small piece of tinfoil. It came out great! Not too dry and not fishy at all. The only thing I will adjust next time is amount of salt. 1/4 tsp is too salty for me :)

This is my new go-to salmon recipe. The dill compliments the salmon perfectly and baking with butter gives it a nice, crisp skin.

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't have any onion powder, so I substituted garlic powder. The salmon is moist and falls apart on your fork. The flavors are rich and meld well with the natural flavor of the salmon. I cooked approximately 2lbs of salmon, so I doubled the recipe. However, they were large pieces but I still only cooked them for 20 minutes. Keep that in mind for when you time your salmon! I will be making this again for sure!

I absolutely loved this recipe! & so did my husband :) this is my first time actually having success w/ a fish recipe so I am very excited because I really enjoy fish but just can never make it for some reason..i made mine in the oven at 400 & cooked for about 25 minutes covered. I also added some lemon juice and garlic powder to the butter & soy sauce. Yum! Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to make it again :)

We eat salmon a lot. The butter included in this recipe was a bit indulgent for us and we enjoyed every bite.  Only change was the use of fresh dill and not dried. :) thanks John!

Absolutely easy to make!  I didn't have onion powder, I used garlic powder, a generous sprinkling on both sides. I also used a generous sprinkling of dill weed, both sides.  Also, lots of butter.  I went sparingly on the pepper, and I used ground pepper.  I didn't use any salt at all, trying to cut down on salt.  

This is now my number 1 salmon recipe.  Great with steamed asparagus.  

This recipe will encourage me to eat more salmon.

I loved this recipe. I lightly greased the casserole dish with margarine first, didn't measure the spices just coated evenly with them. Then placed a few drops of lemon juice on my fingers and flicked over fillets a few times to sprinkle evenly. Added a small dab of margarine on top and covered dish with foil before cooking. Was moist and very tasty. Plated over rice and served with broccoli florets and lemon wedge, delicious!

Made this recipe as is ... usually play around a little more with dinner, but was feeling crummy and had promised salmon for dinner.  This seemed easy and most likely flavorful.  Yup!  This gets the first 4 stars for taste and the last for being one of the simplest recipes on the planet and yet I still got compliments at the table!  Just stick with what's here this time - don't change it in ANY way.  You will have a simple and tasty dinner quickly, which is always a plus.

This was so good bf requested salmon which I don't cook very often but man oh man did it make me look awesome in the kitchen. I discovered I was out of onion powder but I had some finely minced onion left over from another recipe so I figured it was just meant to be. I mixed the spices with the onions and it made a paste so I just rubbed the steaks with it. Really awesome flavors and super easy to make!

I could only find fresh dill, so I cut it, mixed the seasonings together in a bowl, and let it sit overnight.  I had read that the dried flavor was better, and though it wasn't dry, it was flavorful.  I also rubbed the fish instead of just sprinkling the spices.  It was simple and delicious!

Used olive oil in place of butter and sealed it in aluminum. Baking time was right on for me. Kids loved it, just add a splash of lemon juice and it is great! Will definitely make again!

This was very good.

Generally, salmon isn't my favorite, but this recipe will have me having more.

I used a 1 lb fillet cut in half(shared with the wife). I used a smaller
baking dish 9x9, which helped the fish to stay moist. Also, did it uncovered, for when I started the recipe I wasn't sure if if I should cover it or not. Baked it for 20 minutes and it was perfect.

So basic and simple yet so delicious. Made this several times and it is always my family's favorite salmon recipe. Sometimes I add a thin slice of lemon on top of the salmon to bake.

Great Recipe.  Used Mayo instead of butter and it turned out great!

A simple, but very nice recipe. I made it exactly as written, except that the salmon portions I used added up to almost a pound and a quarter. I might cut the butter in half next time (a little too drippy for me), but otherwise the combination of seasonings was very complementary to the salmon. Worth making again!

I am not a fish lover usually, and I don't eat salmon. A neighbor gave us several huge Alaskan salmon steaks so I thought I would use them up. This was delish! I followed the suggestion to marinate the fish in lime or lemon juice before hand and it made a huge difference! I also melted the butter with fresh green onions, dill, salt and garlic salt. I also added a little sugar too. It turned out amazingly! I would definitely eat this one again, which is saying a lot for a non fish lover like me:)

LOVED this.  Ridiculously easy & fast.  Made with fresh salmon rather than frozen.  Baked 17 min & it was perfect.   Did use butter & also only had onion salt. Didn't use foil, but it was still very moist & good.   Also, I made the serving for 1, which changed the salt to pepper ratio.  Still completely fantastic, easy, and didn't ask for any ingredients I didn't have, which is a plus.  Going in the vault! :)  Thank you!

Very good.  My only problem was that I mixed up all the spices before I realized that I only had one good size salmon filet.  So I went overboard on the amount of spices.  However, the flavor was very nice, just next time I need to adjust the spices to the amount of fish better.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars.  It didn't taste bad, but didn't taste like 4 or 5 stars to me. The salmon tasted a little bland to me.  The recipe is easy and quick to make though.

The only salmon recipe I'll ever need. This salmon tastes amazing and is almost impossible to mess it up (take it from someone who has experience wrecking dishes).

I made this using very little pepper for personal taste reasons and cooked it for 15 minutes because my fillet was thin.

I had never had salmon with dill before but it sounded good, so I decided to give it a shot, and I am so glad I did! I used both garlic powder and onion powder (1/2 tsp of each), and I melted the butter and mixed all the seasonings into it before pouring it on the fish, also added a small bit of lemon juice, and didn't cook it for quite as long as the recipe called for (my pieces of salmon were small). I served it with rice and sugar snap peas. Boyfriend happily took leftovers to work the next day. :) I'll definitely be making this again!

We love salmon and we loved this recipe! I followed advice of another and sauteed the butter with some ev olive oil and white wine and garlic and onions. then poured the mix on top of the salmon after I salted, peppered and thymed the filets! cooked them about 20 mins at 400 degrees. I served it with the dill sauce half mayo-half sour cream and some side noodles-- a quikie box mix "butter and herb" we also enjoyed a nice pinot noir "BlackStone reserve" about $20 it was a wonderful one year anniversary for us and the baby slept the whole time!!!! LOVED IT!!!!

Very good and simple. I used salt, pepper, dill weeds, garlic and onion powder, lemon juice and bay leaves. Salmon has plenty of juice inside so I did not use butter at all. Baked for 15 min. Came out nice.

Excellent! Flavorful without being overpowering. I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers to put a little chopped onion and garlic over top the salmon prior to cooking. I also squeezed fresh lemon juice over the fillets before putting them in the oven. I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe really worked for me.  I used sea salt instead of regular salt.  The recipe calls for onion and dill powder I used real.  The flavors mixed well together and I served them over rice.  Everyone raved.

I had seen, SOMEWHERE, a recipe with Salmon and spinach and could not remember where, so I got on line and found this.  It was perfect and I just put some Green Giant creamed spinach over the top.  Delicious.  Thank you!  DEFINITELY a "keeper"!

My husband really liked this, but I didn't like it that much. I'm not that much of a fish eater though. My kids (4 and 6) ate it. It's a very easy recipe and if you like salmon a lot, it's definitely worth trying.

Like some others, I didn't have any dried onion handy, so I chopped up just about a teaspoon of white onion to put on this.  I also used lemon pepper rather then regular black pepper. I managed to forget the butter until about halfway through cooking, but added it with no problem.  Turned out great and very flavorful.  Might be a little strong for some, but we loved it.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I added a little bit of lemon juice after it was done baking.  This was definitely some of the best salmon I've ever had.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this salmon dish many times and it is always a winner.  My husband and I love fish but didn't think that we could get our 2 and 4 yr. olds to even try it.  They love it and ask me to make it at least once a week.  A definate keeper!!!!

AMAZING! I was totally skeptical at first, just looking at the ingredients, but WOW! This recipe delivers on taste! I patted both sides of the salmon with the spices, and didn't measure anything - just sprinkled on. I was probably a little heavy on the onion powder and dill weed, but nonetheless, it was fantastic as prepared! I also sprinkled on a tad of Old Bay and garlic powder. Used 4T of butter pats. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes and the butter seared the bottom of the salmon perfectly! Served with lime wedges - another WOW! Added a superb subtle flavor! Terrific dish. 10 STARS!!! Company-worthy or just family, this recipe is easy to fix and smelled wonderful while baking. Thanks for the post!

I liked this because it was so simple and quick and lets the flavor of the salmon shine through.  You do have to like dill though.  

My husband likes dill but doesn't like salmon (not into "big protein blocks") and he said this was one of the best ways I've prepared salmon.  
Still, he said he preferred "by a long shot" the potatoes I made with them.  So I guess that means he still isn't wowed by salmon.  I'm rating according to how I like it.  If ease of prep gets a star, it'd be five stars.

Microwaved potatoes lyonnaise (recipe on this site) is another quick and simple recipe that goes well with this dish when you just want to get something quick on the table.

I made this for dinner tonight, and my hubby actually had 2 servings.  Unprecedented, as he kept insisting he didn't like salmon.  Put into man that had tin foil in it, and sprayed Pam on the foil.  To make it, modified it somewhat to be healthier:  Used 1/2 tsp onion granules, 3/4 tsp garlic granules, and the dill weed, salt and pepper, put spices through my mortar and pestle to crush up and combine.  Sprinkled the fish with lemon, then spooned on the spices.  Sprayed Pam on top of the fish fillets, and baked for 28 minutes.  Yummy!!!  My hubby wanted to know what I was going to do with the leftovers, and also said that we would have salmon more often now!!

I have never liked salmon but after trying this recipe it was awesome.  I added a little lemon juice to the salmon and substituted garlic powder for the onion powder. I then added some dried minced onion as I read in some other reviews. As we are dieting I replaced the butter with the I can't believe it's not butter spray.  If your sceptical about salmon I would really give this recipe a try.  Thank you John for this delightful recipe.

This was a really good and light way to make salmon.  I typically use a lemon/basil/butter sauce for my salmon, but am trying to cut back so thought I'd give this a try.  It's very tasty -- dill is the secret tasty ingredient in lots of recipes (especially stroganoff -- try it).  I also added a few seasonings of my own of course, but the basics of this recipe are quite good.

Everyone in the family like this one.  My fillets were a little thick, which concentrated the spices on the fish, and caused me to need longer cook-time.  Otherwise, things turned out well.

Personally, I thought the spices overwhelmed the fish. Next time I'll try fresh dill which is less strong than dried, and maybe minced onion instead of onion powder. The fish was moist and didn't dry out.

My boyfriend is a huge fan of salmon and eats it often.  We bought some salmon and used this recipe. I was shocked when he said it is maybe the best salmon he's ever had.  He said it really lets the flavor of the salmon through but with just enough seasonings.  But you'd better like dill.  I tried it but I don't like salmon.

I agree with some of the others, the cooking time was too long. The recipe was very good and simple to do. i it’s hard to go wrong with salmon and dill.  My kind of recipe these days. This would be perfect with less cooking, maybe 5-10 less time.

By far the best salmon recipe I’ve ever made at home! I didn’t have onion powder so I substituted it with onion salt (which I’ll probably use again the next time I make this) it worked great! Since I added onion salt I didn’t add regular salt. I bought a little more than 2lbs of Atlantic Salmon so I doubled the ingredients and let me tell you it was FABULOUS!! I ate this for dinner with a side of broccoli so TASTY! I highly recommend this recipe. I’ll definitely be making it again.

I added a splash of lemon on top, too. I was worried that I wouldn't like it because I hate a fishy taste. This blend of seasonings made the salmon truly delicious. I mixed all of the seasonings in a ramekin and then sprinkled it over the salmon. I will definitely be making this again!!!

I have used this recipe several times, without much alteration, though I typically use a larger piece of salmon. 
 I simply sprinkle the salmon with the dill, lemon juice, and butter. then wrap it in aluminum foil and bake as directed here.  This is such an easy, tasty recipe, and my friends and family always seem to enjoy it.  Simple and delicious- the best kind of recipe.  I serve it with basmati rice and steamed broccoli.

Simple and very tasty!  I used to serve a dill sauce with broiled salmon, but this recipe puts those great flavors all together so there is no need for the extra effort of making a separate sauce.

In order to keep the fish moist, I tented each fish piece with foil which in effect poached the fish.  Delicious!  20 minutes is long enough.

Delicious!  Didn't change anything.  Made for my boyfriend's son who turns out didn't like salmon, but ate it all and said it was better than the salmon he had on a cruise ship. :)   So now we call it "better than cruise ship salmon".  I've made it several times!

I love this recipe and make it whenever I want fish. I have made slight changes on the recipe tho. I add chopped garlic on the salmon instead of onion powder and use always fresh dill. I don’t add pepper. I find the foil cleaner way to use so I always cook in foil and every time it turns out well cooked delicious dish. I serve with extra lemon juice, chopped onion and cappers to garnish. ??

One of the BEST salmon recipes I've ever had & a high class restaurant quality. After reading the reviews these are the changes I made; drizzled the salmon filets with lemon juice, sprinkled with garlic powder, dried dill, salt & pepper.  Smothered the filets with light mayo. & sprinkled with more dill & 1 cup of chopped green onions. Pressed the mayo, dill & green onions on to the fillets with a back of a spoon to make sure it adhered.  Baked at 400 for 25 min. Served it with baked potatoes, saluted zucchini & green salad.

Made it on Cedar plank on the BBQ, and was great! The only thing I changed where the times, I followed the planks instructions: After the BBQ was pre-heated on high, place the planks on medium for 5 minutes closing the BBQ lid until the planks begin smoking, leave them smoke for a few minutes (have a water spray bottle handy to douse flames in planks), then lower the flames to lowest and leave another 15-18 minutes until salmon flaky with a fork.

I was disappointed that this didn't have more flavor.  It was so simple to make that I will make it again and jazz it up a little.  Also next time I will serve it with tarter sauce as suggested.

We are going through a bad hot spell right now so I do NOT cook inside.  I folded this up into a loose bundle and cooked direct heat on medium on the grill.

What a terrific and easy dish. While the recipe calls for measured ingredients, I basically sprinkled them on "to taste". I covered the dish with foil to keep the fish from drying out and I don't know if my fish was "fatter" than most salmon slices but it took a little longer than the time shown here. It was definitely worth the wait. Will definitely make it again.

Because I like experimenting with seasonings .... I added some garlic powder and some Mexican oregano with the other seasonings and .... rave reviews from my four guests.  I do agree that baking at 400 degrees is a bit much if you have a full sockeye salmon fillet.  It requires tender loving care.  However, this is an excellent recipe for baking salmon.  Will use this again; less heat.

Put a bit of white wine in the bottom of the baking dish and cut a lemon into slices for the top of the fish.  Went VERY lightly on the onion powder.  Basted the fish twice during cooking with liquid from the pan.  Yummy!!!

I have made this several times and I have loved it every single time. I've made it exactly as the recipe is written and I haven't found a reason to modify or change it at all. I will caution that dill is very strong, so, if you're looking for a more subtle flavor you could probably decrease the amount of dill in it.

This was great and easy to make! I mixed all the spices together first and it made a little too much but I put it all on anyways.  Still had a very good taste.  Will make again sometime.

i made this without dill because i forgot that but i baked in foil to keep it moist as others suggested.  it was good i think your result depends highly on the salmon used.  i bought mine at trader joes.  i do not think it was the best salmon ever but it was probably the starting quality.

My only mistake was cooking the salmon just a bit too long.  Oops.  This recipe is now part of my monthly supper rotation.  The only thing I changed was I sprayed my baking dish with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.  My boyfriend thought I was going to over season the fish.  He was completely suprised at how good this dish was.

Flavorful and quick but I prefer fresh ingredients on salmon to make it lighter tasting I.e. Fresh dill and lemon.

Loved this recipe! I only made a few minor changes. I used ghee instead of butter and baked at 400 for 10 minutes covered with aluminum foil, then I removed the skin and continued to cook another 4-7 minutes without the aluminum foil. It was delicious!! I'll definitely make this again!!

I made this with lemon pepper and dill and salt. I did use some butter.  I cooked a thick salmon piece covered with foil for the first 15 min and then uncovered for the next 15 minutes. It was wonderful! I do think that you should adjust cooking time depending on the thickness of your fish. A nice change for us since we've been stuck on the teriyaki glazed salmon. Also great since I had the ingredients readily on hand.

Fixed this exactly as written (with the exception of making it for two people instead of four) and it came out great!  Served it with Asparagus Parmesan (also on this site) for a really satisfying yet light meal.  Will definitely be making this again.

Even with the butter on top, it was kind of dry.  Perhaps I cooked it too long? Not sure.  And I had to add salt after it cooked to bring out more of the flavor.

The dill and onion powder was a great blend of spices.  It took about 20 minutes in the oven at 400 and came out very tender.

Great and easy recipe that does not over flavor the salmon.  I did sprinkle with fresh lemon juice prior to cooking but that was only addition.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again.  I saw another review used mayo instead of butter.  I use mayo on salmon but this recipe is perfect with butter and I would not change.

This was so easy and very good!  I did not use the salt or pepper but sprinkled with lemon pepper instead.  I drizzled EVOO on top in place of the butter.  Finally, I  put thinly sliced lemons on top.  Moist and flavorful!

This had a great flavor and so easy to make.  I made only one change and I used coconut oil instead of butter.  We will keep this one as a favorite.

This is a super-tasty, easy way to bake salmon.  The seasoning was perfect, not overpowering but complimentary.  I didn't use the butter because I forgot but I don't think it's needed....saves a few calories too!  A new favorite way to serve salmon.

Seriously delicious.  First, I marinated the fish in lemon juice while I was prepping everything/preheating the oven.  I used mayo instead of butter and mixed the dill, salt and pepper into it before smearing everything over top the fillets.  Went in for 10 min at 400F.  Awesome :)

Very similar to the dilly chicken breast recipe. I think it's better with chicken.

it was definately good and a welcomed change.  i followed it exact except I used fat free "butter".  I'm sure it would be a lot better with real butter but it certainly was tasty enough without it.  Also used lemon pepper.

I was so happily surprised! I used wild salmon steaks because that's what I had, and spiced both sides. It looked like SO much spice to me but I was delighted that it turned out to be wonderfully delicious and SO easy!! It's rare to see more pepper than salt called for and I did cut the pepper in half because I have a 1- & 3-year-old who wouldn't have gone for that much, but it would also taste great for a teen or adult with the full amount of pepper. The cook time also worked perfectly for the thick steaks that I used. Thanks for this great easy recipe!

I made this recipe tonight, following it exactly.  My husband and I both liked it, but it wasn't totally amazing or anything.   The spices all combined nicely, but we probably didn't need quite so much.  I served a sour cream/mayo/dill sauce on the side and that was a good addition.  All in all, a good recipe.  Thanks.

I didn't measure anything, just sprinkled the seasonings over the fish. I also used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray and just drizzled it. 20 minutes is just about the perfect baking time, as I hate overcooked salmon. I bet garlic would be good with this, too.

This was a great reciepe...I used fresh dill as other people had recommended....I also chopped some fresh onions and put them on top of the salmon right before i placed them in the oven....It is a def. keeper....If you do not have fresh onions use the onion powder...i had both so i used both.,.....

Sorry but I won't make this one again.  The butter (I used light margarine) was overpowering--you could barely taste the salmon.  Although it was quick and easy, I like the Garlic Salmon recipe from this website better.  But then again, I prefer lemon juice over butter.  Also, the onion powder didn't seem to add anything special.  Not a bad recipe especially since you don't have to marinate the salmon but again, it's not memorable enough to make again.

This was very good, especially for someone who is not a huge salmon fan.  I am trying to find recipes that will help me enjoy salmon, as I know it is good for you.  This one is definitely a keeper! A perfect amount of seasoning so that it isn't too fishy.

Simple and very good.  I used garlic powder instead of onion, used olive oil instead of butter and add white wine. Used lemon pepper. very juicy.  it is good on king salmon and local california salmon.  However not so good on coho salmon which turns out dry

DELISH!!
This was the first time I have ever made salmon, but the recipe seemed so easy, that I thought,"How could I fail?!"

And I was right!  The salmon was easy to prepare, and tasted GREAT!  I love salmon and I highly recommend this recipe!  I did use mayo instead of butter because I've seen other recipes using mayo, and it worked!  It just didn't form a crust on the salmon.  But the flavor was perfect!

Good and simple- doesn't take away from the great flavor of salmon.  I used a Copper River fillet and it was delicious.  I do plan on using most of this in Salmon Chowder from this site, I think it will be great.

I thought this was okay.  It was very easy to make, which I appreciated.  And it tasted fine, but it wasn't exciting.  The best thing about it (besides the ease of it) was the additional sauce another reviewer suggested making (half sour cream, half mayo, and some dill).  I'll probably make it again, but not all that often.

This was delicious, and I usually don't care for salmon.  Don't be scared by the fact that you seem to be drowning your fish filets with the seasoning--it turns out almost like a crust and it tastes great!

This was pretty good.  I marinated the salmon for about 30 minutes in lemon juice, as some others suggested.  I used butter spray instead of actual butter and it kind of cooked weird, so next time I'll just go for the real thing!

I'm rating this according to my husband's approval.  Personally, I absolutely hate salmon! Which is almost illegal here in Seattle.  But I made this for my husband son, who usually just puts teriyaki sauce on their salmon before they barbecue.  My husband thought this was way better than the teriyaki, and although my son liked it, he preferred just plain teriyaki.  I then made this for my annual 4th of July party, four large Costo size fillets, and they all got gobbled up in no time.  So I guess it's a keeper and very easy.

This recipe was really wonderful.  The herbs were a wonderful compliment to the salmon and so easy to put together.  I skipped the salt and onion powder and just sprinkled onion salt evenly over the fillets.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I am not a salmon eater but my husband caught a 55 pound salmon so I just took a big chunk of it, and tried this recipe.  I didn't even measure the seasonings but sprinkled them on both sides of the salmon and added as much dabs of margarine that would cover the salmon.  Baked it 400 for 20 minutes and turned the oven off until we were ready to eat.  This was the best salmon I had ever eaten.  It was so moist and flavorful. Thank you for this simple recipe.  I will use it often.

I am no fan of fish, but this is the best fish dish I've had in a LONG time! I used fresh dill, and I was surprised at how UNflavorsome it was. The salmon steaks were quite thick, so I baked Husband's piece for 30 mins, and mine for 40. (I like my fish to be cooked thoroughly) It was absolutely delicious! Thanks so much, John!

FANTASTIC!  When my husband goes back for seconds of FISH then this is a wonderful recipe!  Even my 4 and 2 year old ate some.  The spices add just the right flavor.  I followed the recipe completely changing nothing.  This is definately company worthy.

Overall the flavors were tasty together. Next time less dill and a tiny bit more onion powder. Very simple.

Even my kids like this recipe!  I've made it at least a dozen times.  I've tried reducing the amount of butter, but the salmon comes out dry.  So don't be tooooo stingy just to save a few grams of fat.  And having leftovers is no problem.  Just crumble it up on a salad for a delicious lunch!!

Great recipe!  I would only recommend reducing the amount of spices used.  We had 1.8 lbs of fish and doubled the recipe.  This was a little stronger than we liked, so I would not recommend over-doing it on the spices.

I usually just drizzle a little oil on my salmon and put it under the broiler. This was definitely a nice change. Quick, easy, and delicious.

Fish was good, but salmon almost always is, no matter what you do to it!  The only real flavor seemed to be in the butter.  Maybe fresh dill would've been better.  Just didn't have enough flavor for me, and I even added squeezed lemon juice at the end!

For someone who is trying to learn how to eat more fish, salmon in particular, this was a great first choice!  I was expecting more of a fish taste.  The flavor was great, the texture of the meat will take a bit of getting used to.  I also made a dill sauce but actually prefer to just squeeze fresh lemon over the top.  My 10 and 4 year old daughters also liked it.
