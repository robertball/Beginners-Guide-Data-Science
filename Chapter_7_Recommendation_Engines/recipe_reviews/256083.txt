We are HUGE ham salad fans, but we didn't care for this. I wish I would've went with my instincts and just finely chopped the celery, onions and pickles, b/c  I felt that it gave the ham salad a murky look and made it watery.  The flavor was ok, but by the next day, it had a really strong celery/onion taste, which we did not like. I was glad to try this for something different, but I will not be making this again, sorry.
