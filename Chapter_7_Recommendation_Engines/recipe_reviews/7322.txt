This gingerbread, handsdown, is the best I've ever tasted. I doubled the spices, used a whole cup of robust molasses, and added 1/2 cup applesauce. It turned out moist and absolutely delish. I've made it twice already and even those who swear they hate gingerbread say that this is to die for. Here's a secret idea that I got from a restaurant...Toast a slice in a toaster over then drizzled with caramel sauce (homemade is the best) and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Amazing. I will be making this forever.

I give this recipe 5 stars, but with a disclaimer... it depends on which kind of molasses is used, a triumphant 5 stars using Unsulphured, but a paltry 2 stars using Blackstrap. Here's why: Please remember there are three distinctly different choices when it comes to molasses, as it will impact your recipe's flavor quite a lot. 1) Unsulphured Molasses is the sweetest, with a mild molasses taste.  2) Sulphured Molasses is less sweet, more minerally, with a stronger molasses taste. 3) Blackstrap Molasses is not very sweet at all, has a hard, licorice-like flavor... so choose carefully, your satisfaction will depend on it. And yet how many of these recipes recommend any one kind... they just say molasses...lol, is it just me?

OMG this is probably the BEST cake recipe I've found on this website!!  It tasted much better than I expected.  I doubled all the spices, replaced half of the butter with applesauce, replaced the molassass with 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup honey.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

This is really good.  I recommend increasing the cinnamon and ginger to at least 2 teaspoons each.  I personally like my gingerbread a bit more moist, so I will add a little bit more water next time (maybe an additional 2 tablespoons of water).  I baked in a springform pan as well (9 1/2 ") and it was really pretty.  You can sprinkle powdered sugar over the top for a nice presentation.

We loved this moist gingerbread.  I put it in a loaf pan, which worked out great.  A creamcheese with orange peel frosting tops this well. Especially when you're sharing it with the office! They raved about it!
I added 2 tsp. of ginger, but kept everything else as Charles submitted it.  It has a lot of flavor and the texture was light and moist.  Great with a rich cup of coffee!

Great basic.  Tripled the ginger, cinnamon, and clove.  1/2 cup of apple sauce.  Rest as is with whip cream.  Next time, I might try the darkest molasses I can find.  Unsalted butter please.

Delicious gingerbread.  Will make again.  Especially good with ice cream.  In my oven, the 1 hour cooking time was too much-it started to scorch at 50 mins.  Will begin checking at 45 mins next time.  Thank you!

This is a very dense gingerbread, just what I was looking for.  The only thing I changed was I increased the spices a bit as we like things a bit spicer.  I found this recipe to be plenty moist but I didn't cook it quite as long as the recipe called for, only about 45 minutes, but that could just be my oven.  This cake gets better with age so make it a couple of days before you need it, the flavours seem to mellow.  I served it with warm brandy sauce for our family dinner and it was delicious.

great texture- moist and substantial. BUT lacked any oomph whatsoever.  I increased ginger and cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp each, but definitely should've atleast doubled, as per some other reviewers' suggestions.  May make again.

Made this nostalgic gingerbread for a gathering of 35 home school kids. Out of the 35 only three didn't care for it. Since molasses has a rather strong taste I was a bit surprised that so many kids loved it, but it brought requests for seconds! Several Mom's asked for the recipe which I gladly shared. I made 3 slight changes. I added about 3 T home made applesauce, 1/4 C sour cream and added a bit more of each spice. I baked this in 2 medium loaf pans, sliced when cool and then sprinkled with powdered sugar.

This recipe is SO Good! Amazing tasting Gingerbread.  I too upped the spices as per other reviews.  I doubled the cinnamon and cloves and brought the ginger right up to one tablespoon.  I also added a 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for extra moisture.  My husband hates gingerbread and even he thought it was delicious.  Usually when I make a loaf cake I give most of it away because I lose interest after the first slice-not this time.  I will definitely make again, and soon!  I used a cream cheese icing on top and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and some minced crystalized ginger.  Decadent and so far beyond the Starbucks version (which is what I was trying to achieve) it's unreal.  Never again will I consider spending $3.00 on one slice of that loaf when I can make this far superior one anytime.  EXCELLENT.

Very good.  I was looking for a plain spice cake when I read all the good reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  The only thing I did different was I added rasins and nuts.  Thank you Charles

I had a SERIOUS craving for some Gingerbread Cake and this is my second time making this. Didn't feel like rating last time. The first time I made just as specified. Totally satisfied but could have been a bit more spicey but that's just me. 4 stars in it's original state. This time for experimental purposes, I was going to follow 'Francine76' (first review) with an addition of 1/2 cup of Applesauce but dang it--my mouth was watering so bad to get it in the pan that I forgot it. Oh well...The cake STILL came out tasty, moist and flavorful. Nice deep color too! This recipe is highly adaptable to your favorite spices and substitutions so I did change up or double my spices. I used 2 t of ginger, 1 1/2 t of cinnamon, 1/2 t of mace, 1/2 t of allspice, 1/2 t of cloves and a NICE pinch of cayenne pepper to give it a 'fly' kick. I also used 1/4 c ea. brown & wht sugars (to use up remaining small amount of brown left in bag) & because my butter was still too cold and my mouth was starting to turn into a swimming pool...I used 1/2 cup of 'Butter Flavor Crisco'. I also simmered 3 T of golden raisins in a 1/2 cup of Brandy, 1 t vanilla & 2 tsp of sugar for 5 minutes, drained (save liquid) & added to batter. Took liquid and added hot water to make 1 cup and added that to the batter before putting into pan. Pulling cake 10 minutes early, cake baked up just as delicious and beautiful. I love Gingerbread Cake & this recipe always make me feel realize with guilt I should make it more often.

I changed the cinnamon and ginger to 2 tsp. and the cloves to 1 tsp. Flavor is excellent but next time I will add 1/2 c. applesauce to add a little moisture.  Will definitely make again.

The aroma alone is well worth 5 stars. I used Splenda, added 1/2 cup applesauce and doubled the spices. I used a 9" square baking pan, oven temp set at 350 and the gingerbread was perfecttly done in 35 minutes.  I can see whay other reviewers complained of the gingerbread being dry and suggested adding applesauce for extra moistness.  So, be sure to check for doneness after 35 minutes or it could be way overbaked at 60 minutes. This will definitely be a recipe I use often.

This was also my great grandmother's recipe, and dates back to the 1920s.  The difference in her version is that instead of 1/2 C butter, the recipe says 1/2 C butter and lard mixture and requires "Brer Rabbit" Molasses.

It also says to cook in a moderate oven for 35 minutes, so maybe that's why some were having trouble when cooking it for an hour.

I made this gingerbread for our Thanksgiving dessert.  My sister wanted to make a box gingerbread, but I knew it would be better from scratch.  Following advice, I did double all the spices, used unsulphured light molasses, added 2 tablespoons of oil and half a cup of applesauce.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of crystallized ginger I bought at a specialty spice store, and I think it made all the difference.  I baked in an 8x8 pan for 50 min.  It came out perfect!  It was starting to burn the littlest bit on the top though, so definitely start watching it closely after 40 minutes or so.  It was so good, I made it again for the holiday party we threw at our house, and I'm making it again on Christmas Day!  I served it with a semi-homemade pumpkin gingersnap ice cream: Heat a can of pumpkin and the same spices used in the gingerbread in a sauce pan for about 5 minutes.  Cool in the freezer in a shallow dish.  When it is cool, mix with vanilla ice cream that is softened, either leave it out for an hour or microwave it a little.  Mix the pumpkin in with the ice cream, and then mix in 20 crushed gingersnap cookies.  Place back in the freezer for about an hour.  Serve within 3 hours to ensure the cookies stay crisp.  HEAVENLY with this gingerbread.  My entire family agree this was one of the best Thanksgiving desserts in history!

This was a fantastic recipe.  Followed it to a tee except went heavy on ginger...1 tablespoon.  Added a little extra of the other spices too.  We like it spicy!!  Added a teaspoon of nutmeg!  Wonderful!!!  The house smelled wonderful my husband said I have to make one everyday to make the house smell that good!  My nine year old loved it too.  Sprinkled it with powdered sugar and served it with whipped cream!  This was my first gingerbread but I won't be trying any other recipes...this one nails it!!  Easy, moist and delicious!

Excellent old fashioned gingerbread. The only flaw is that the bake time is too long. Mine was done in 45 minutes. You should start checking at 40 minutes. Be sure to check with a knife, not a toothpick because the moist cake will stick to the wood. I also reccomend doubling the spices.

Very tasty, not to over powering with the ginger flavor, didn't add clover, added nutmeg instead & a small box of raisins.  Melted some lemon curd for topping, oh so good.

Doubled the spices as recommended by other reviewers and it made a dark, spicy, moist gingerbread that tasted even better the day after I baked it.  Served with fresh whipped cream.  We loved it!

I thought this was delicious.  I doubled the spices and took it out of the oven 5 minutes early (usually they are more moist that way).  I would try adding applesauce to give it more moisture.  I see a lot of reviews that say the molasses taste is too strong.  I tasted the cake right after baking and thought so too.  But after I left it overnight, the flavor mellowed out and it's perfect!  Using a bundt cake pan would probably make it even more attractive.  Try it warmed up with whipped cream!

I place pear slices on the bottom of a round pan, sprinkle with candied ginger and then pour the batter on top.  After baking, I turn it over so the pears are on top.  Once it is cooled, I sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Have to double spices, I used half molasses half raw honey. Turned out beautifully as three mini loaves, took about 45 minutes to bake. perfect with hard sauce. Our guests were thrilled to eat a couple of slices and then take a mini loaf home. Batter seems runny but bakes up nicely.

I just took this out of my oven about an hour ago. My neighbor smelled the aroma out at her mailbox and stopped by to ask what I was baking.  I did increase the ginger to 2 teaspoons and while the cake was still warm cut into it to find a moist, not too dense, exceptionally flavored gingerbread.  I've made a peach compote to go with for dessert tonight.  I am very pleased and will absolutely make this again if for no other reason than to make my home smell like Christmas of years past.  P.S.  My neighbor also has a copy of your recipe.  Thank you!!

Delicious! I tested this recipe out as a potential dessert for my Christmas party. I took other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the spices (cinnamon, ginger and cloves). I made it in a Bundt pan and 45 minutes was perfect!! Don't be afraid of the strange consistency when you add the hot water. It was very watery, with clumps of dough in it, but it baked perfectly. I just sprinkled powdered sugar on it before serving. Delicious recipe, and I'm looking forward to making it again for my guests! *** UPDATE 12/25/2010: I made this again and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. DELICIOUS ADDITION!! I may add up to 1.5 cups next time. Again made in a Bundt as written above, with a dusting of powdered sugar. Guests loved it! ***

I doubled the spices as others suggested and although the taste was great, I found that it dried out pretty quickly which I don't find when I use an oil based bread recipe.  Maybe I can substitute oil next time.

Loved this. Delicious, moist and easy to make. Will be making this again soon. 1 hr baking time is to long. Mine was done in 40 mins. (good thing i checked on it!) it would have been overbaked and dry if i kept it in there for the entire 1 hr. Will be making this again soon :)

I will never try another gingerbread recipe again, this is really the one! It is very moist and cake-like, not too dense and heavy like bread. I doubled the spices like others have recommended, plus I love these spices. I baked this at 350 for 45 minutes and it was done. You can easily top this with a vanilla glaze, whipped cream, or powdered sugar.

I don't normally rate recipes, but felt compelled to grade this one.. 'cause, honestly, it was like trying to eat a molasses brick. Despite following the recipe exactly and cooking in a properly working oven, the crumb and crust were not tender and the cake, as a whole, was far too dense. The molasses overwhelmed the other flavors, although that could be 'cause I used Brer Rabbit full flavor style ( I do love molasses!). Will not try this recipe again.

Very good, but I like VERY intense gingerbread.  I doubled all the spices, used a full cup of molasses, substituted 1/4 c of applesauce for 1/4 c of butter, and baked for 45 min.  Very moist.  Some reviewers said the spciy taste intensifies the next day so maybe better tomorrow.  ****I changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  The next day the spices intensified and the cake was dense and gooey-- just how I like it!*********

I baked this to take to the preschool when we were learning about the letter G and gingerbread was our theme.  Most of the 3-year olds liked it to my surprise, since most kids don't like things that are heavily spiced.  The other teachers raved about this bread and wanted the recipe. I made it twice and it actually turned out better the second time. The first time I used 1 12 teaspoons ginger based on some of the other revies, and I thought it was a little too gingery. The second time I used spiced exactly as called for and I liked it much better.  I also used a 9x13-inch pan the second time because I thought the bread was too "thick" the first time and was rather messy and crumbly.  Using the larger pan, it only took about 35 minutes in my oven and it was still plenty thick, but more manageable as finger-food.  I thought it was good and I am not a huge fan of gingerbread, gingersnaps or anything with molasses in it.  I would definitely make this again and I am considering making this in mini-loaves for Christmas gifts in addition to pumpkin bread.

Favorite indeed! Tripled the spices, added some nutmeg - the taste is exquisite, texture too, moist & nice and it rose beautifully. The only mistake I made was to take it out of the pan before it cooled completely, so it cracked slightly:-) Still, it was gone in one evening:-)

Exactly what I was looking for! I only realised I didn't have any molasses after I started. So I substituted 1 cup molasses with 1/2 cup golden syrup and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. Also, as per the suggestions of other reviewers (and since I wanted to make sure this was spicy), I used 2 teaspoons of ginger powder, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon powder and a little less than 1 teaspoon of cloves powder. Also, ensure that the hot water is stirred in by hand coz I think it makes a difference if you allow the water to seep into your batter and get incorporated by stirring rather than using a machine to do it. Do keep an eye on your oven while this is baking coz this took me only 35 minutes to bake contrary to everybody elses 45-60 minutes. I've used confectioners' sugar to sprinkle over it since I'm adding this to my Holiday platters but if you were serving this as a dessert, I'd suggest topping with lemon glaze/lemon curd/ whipped cream/caramel sauce or serving ice cream when serving it hot! Thank you Charles! I really and truly love this and I'm quite sure this is going to become an all-round the year cake coz everybody seems to simply LOVE this!! :) :) Also I MUST add, baking this has made my house smell so YUM AND COZY!! :D

Pumpkin!  I've made this several times and loved it, but my favorite batch was when I added just over 1/2 cup pumpkin to it.  The pumpkin makes it so nice and moist as well as gives it a firm texture.  I doubled the spices with the pumpkin and it is just right.  I will definitely add pumpkin every time.

3 points:  1. I used whole spices (except ginger) and ground them fresh for the recipe; the amounts given were very good and the results flavorful. But I can see pre-ground spices would be very bland, in the amounts given.  2. the seasoning was OK, but not well rounded. The second time, I added 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper and 1 Tbl orange zest. Much better. In the future, I'll also add a 1/4 tsp orange essence or oil.  3. Pan size is all wrong. The batter filled 9" square pan within 1/2" of the rim. I scraped it into a 9"x13" pan and it still baked up 2" thick. (Of course, the recipe does call for an unusually large amount of leavening; a more normal amount would be 1/2 tsp soda.)     I had no problem with dryness, which I find interesting considering the larger pan and how frothy the batter is. FYI, I baked it 40 minutes.

Quite simply, absolutely fabulous!  I increased the ground ginger and ground cinnamon to 1-1/2 tsp. each, but otherwise, kept the recipe as-is.  Deep, rich flavor, nice texture to the cake, and wonderful served (as I did) with caramelized peaches and homemade whipped cream.  Thanks so much, Charles!

a lovely bread/cake as is, but needed double the spices to get a true gingerbread flavour for me.  I made my version (a little bit more) diabetic-friendly by substituting Splenda granulated for the sugar, applesauce for the butter, and EggBeaters for the egg.  Came out heavy, dense, moist and rich---my favourite kind of gingerbread!!!  Thank you!

YUM, YUM, yummy or to put it in my nine month old daughter's words.... MORE!!! I was orignal looking for a gingerbread recipe to make gingerbread and a gingerbread house with. This more of a spice cake and does would not work has a gingerbread or  gingerbread person recipe. Neverless it is a delicious, yummy, seasonal cake.... I read the reviews and made the following changes instead of a cup of hot water; I used 1 1/4 cup of hot water per suggestion and 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and ginger. ANd made a simple butter frosting to glaze the cake with, since the cake byself is unbelivable yummy.... Between my 9 month daughter, my husand and myself it was gone by the end of the next day....

This is a wonderful gingerbread. I have made many times. I am making it today for my anniversary as my husband loves gingerbread. Thanks for the recipe.

Not sure when I sent in the the first review but my husband passed away over four years ago. I am still making it and now I add 1/3 cup of sour cream to it. The grandchildren love it.  It is still the best.

I made this recipe exactly as written and found the spice quantities perfect for us.  I have learned that most spice cake recipes taste better the next day after the spices have had the time to meld and develop.  If you don’t like molasses, this may not be the recipe for you however.  The next time I make it I will reduce the baking time and start checking the cake starting at 45 minutes. The cake had a great texture but was a little dry which could be my oven, not the recipe.   The added bonus of making this recipe -  the house smells phenomenal!

I made this dec.10,2010. I did add double cinnamon, cloves and ginger. I did add 1/2c. applesauce and 2 ozs .cream cheese and doubled the recipe, added only 1 cup hot water, since I added applesauce and cream cheese. It came out so excellent, very moist,and I made cream cheese frosting.

Took the advice of others and doubled all spices.  To cut calories I substituted splenda for the sugar and used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup butter instead of the 1/2 cup butter.  Had a nice flavor when served with cool whip.  Very easy.  Did it in a loaf pan and came out looking very nice.

This is very similar to my Irish grandmother's recipe.  She used dark brown sugar in place of the white and always swore the "secret" was to use one cup of very strong, black tea, instead of plain old water.  I've used Chai tea, steeped well, with great success.  The added flavor from the tea gave it a bit of a spicier kick.  For a moister, denser cake, I use 1/4 butter and 1/4 low-fat sour cream instead of 1/2 cup butter.  Overall, still my favorite "gingerbread" recipe!

Love it! I, too, doubled the spices, added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and used hot coffee instead of water. And baked it for 45 mins. It is wonderful! The ladies from my Bible study loved it too!! Great with whip cream.

Really, really liked this. Took the advice of several reviewers and doubled the spices, seemed to be the perfect amount. Cooked it in a bundt pan and was done at 43 min.

This is 5 stars with my modifications but I'm sure it would have been just as good without.  However if you want to make something REALLY good & pretty with this recipe, here's what I did - I served this at family Christmas reunion and everyone loved it.  First of all, use a 9" springform pan.  REPLACE half of the molasses with unsweetened pumpkin puree; DOUBLE the cinnamon and ginger; ADD about a cup of chopped walnuts.  Then I covered it with pumpkin spiced whipped cream - the recipe goes like this: 2 cups heavy whipping cream / ½ cup sugar (or less, to taste) / pinch salt / 2 tsp vanilla extract / 1 cup pumpkin puree / 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg / 1 tsp ground cinnamon / 1 tsp ground ginger / 1/2 tsp ground allspice.  WHIP the cream separately with the sugar, and mix together all the other ingredients.  Fold in.  This makes a truly beautiful and very tasty cake that everyone will love!!

I wound up with a 9X9 brick. In actuality this is a spice/molasses cake that is overcooked.  In no way is it a gingerbread cake.  Sorry.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve in 2009. I did double the spices and added one half cup of apple sauce. I baked this recipe in the Williams Sonoma Nordic Ware Christmas houses pan. It makes six individual houses - a perfect serving size! I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and served with freshly whipped cream. WOW! My family loved it! Cakes were wonderfully moist and "gingery." This year I plan to double the recipe and add the Christmas train to the Christmas houses. Hopefully it will last long enough for me to take a picture!!!

I doubled the cinnamon and ginger but followed the rest of the recipe. I baked in an 8x8 pan but it only took about 45 minutes. Very strong, spicy taste and not too sweet, so if that's your thing, you'll love this one!

The best gingerbread I've ever had, hands down. Only change I made was to add half a cup of apple sauce.

DO NOT BAKE FOR 1 HOUR!!!!!  (It only needs 35-40 minutes)  For spicy dark bread, use twice the amount of molasses, and add 1/4 cup freshly/finely shredded ginger... YUM!!!  VERY Good recipe, but wrong bake time for tender bread.

I personally loved this recipe. I used blackstrap molasses and I swear the finished product tasted like
a rich dark chocolate cake. The cake was light and yet very dense. My dad also liked this recipe. 
The only thing I would change is to add more ginger. This is gingerbread after all, and I coudn't taste 
the teaspoon that I put in. Also, caution to the bakers, if you don't like molasses this recipe is not for you.
If you do though, this recipe is heavenly.

I think there may be an error with the cooking time; one hour seems way too long. Mine came out terribly dry and burnt around the edges. I followed the recipe exactly but added extra cinnamon. I wanted to like it, but it was terrible.

This is fabulous. I would recommend a good cream cheese swirl topping after cutting into servings. Other then that, the cake was moist, spicy and delicious. My husband couldn't get enough and asked me to make more so we could take them up to his shop on the base for the guys that couldn't go home for the holidays.

Baking time of one hour appears to be a typo. Checked 3 other similar recipes that gave time as 30-to-35 minutes. I baked for 42 minutes and the cake was well done and a little too well done on the outer edges. The cake was still very tasty with good old-fashioned spicy flavors.

I have never made gingerbread before and used this as a dessert over the holidays - it was WONDERFUL! This amount fit well into an 8-9 cup antique bundt pan I have - sprinkled with confectioners sugar, it was lovely to look at as well as delicious.  What a nice, old fashioned dessert - will be serving this often at my B&B from now on!
(I did increase all the spices by about 50% since I like things spicier and it was recommended by many other reviewers)

I disagree with most of the reviewers about the spice amounts. I doubled them as most people recommended, but it was too overpowering for my tastes. If you are going for a heavy spice flavor, I would plan on making some kind of sweet frosting or glaze.

Great recipe!  Adding about 1/2 cup of applesauce was the only change I made.  Also, when making this again, I think I'd only cook for about 55 minutes or so---it came out a tad try after a full hour.

This was very good - and yes - very easy!  I read the reviews before making, and did make a couple minor adjustments.  1)  I used brown sugar, not white  2) added 2 additional tbsp of molasses  3)upped the cinnamon to 2 1/2 tsp and 4) added 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Made this into cupcakes, and baked for about 25 minutes at 350F.  Frosted them with  Molasses-Cinnamon Love Glaze, (my personal recipe) and topped with raisins.  I will definitely be making this one again.

Great basic. I used a very dark molasses and  doubled the ginger, cinnamon, and clove. I also added 1/2 cup of apple sauce. Rest as per recipe.  Topped with warm applesauce and whipped cream.

A very good gingerbread recipe.  I give it four stars and not five for a few fairly minor reasons.  I found the gingerbread to not be as spicy and I would have liked, this is my first time making this recipe, so next time I'll add larger amounts of the spices.  My main reason for only giving the recipe four stars is that I found the baking time to be very incorrect.  I used the size baking pan that the recipe suggested, however I found the gingerbread baked in about half the time the recipe directed.  (I used a dark pan.)

Very intense, rich flavor!  Really loved it.  The cake was very dense and moist.  On the advice of others, I also added extra ginger.

I really liked this recipe; it's  a rich and dense gingerbread cake...great with whipped topping.  I used a bit more ginger than the recipe called for.  My kid hasn't developed a taste for ginger, yet...otherwise I'm sure he'd like it too.  Thanks!

I have now tried this recipe two times and all i can say is it comes out dry, burnt on the edges before its even close to cooked on the inside, and flavorless. With all the reviews saying they needed to add or change the spice levels I am amazed so many gave it 5 stars. DO NOT MAKE THIS GINGERBREAD!

This gingerbread was just like my grandmother used to make - full of flavor and moist and sticky. Fantastic.
I followed the ingredients, but didn't have a 9" square pan so used an 8" which worked great. Lined the bottom of pan with silicone paper which was a good idea I feel.  Only baked for 50 minutes as per other reviews and this was spot on. The house smelt wonderful after it came out of the oven. Definitely keeping this recipe and will make time and time again. Delicious!!!!!

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written and found it to be great as is. I did make Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting to top the gingerbread, which made it even better.

Excellent gingerbread; although, like many others, I did not make this 'as is.' I needed it gluten free, so I used 1/2 -all purpose gluten-free flour and 1/2 Millet flour instead of regular flour, used 1/4c of applesauce in place of 1/2 the butter, as others did, and 1/4c brown sugar for 1/2 of the molasses (used un-sulfered molasses per other reviewer recommendations), doubled the cinnamon, cloves, and ginger (per other reviewer recommendations), and the rest as is. Baked it in regular loaf pan, for 1 hr 3 minutes so the middle passed the 'knife test', let cool and sprinkled with powdered confectioners sugar, and served still warm...SOOOO good and spicy! Perfect for Christmas gifts!

This was so yummy!  It's light and has a deep flavour.  The only thing I changed was to use 2t of ginger, next time I might up it to 3t as we like it strong.  I didn't have the right molasses so I made it up with golden syrup and brown sugar, and I didn't have cloves so I used a little allspice instead and it wasn't worse off for the changes.

This is a GREAT recipe! I actually used this for cupcakes and it worked wonderfully! I added a half cup of applesauce to make the cake more moist. 
For a filling, I caramelized some pears (cored the center of the cakes and filled with pears). To top them, I made a marscarpone frosting and finished with a little drop of caramelized pears on top.
They were a big hit!
I would have given this recipe 5 stars if I didn't have to make an adjustment. I will make this again (i'm sure several times ;)

Adding 1/2+ apple sauce, doubling the spices and switching to 1/4c dark brown sugar 1/4c sugar this was a very delicious gingerbread! We will be making this many times over I think!

This bread should be called 'Molassesbread.' The one positive thing about this bread is the texture: very moist.  And that's about it.  It was inedible because of its overpowering molasses taste. This is a subjective statement, of course. If you like molasses, a lot, go for it.  If you want a traditional gingerbread that tastes not only like molasses, don't bake this bread.

Delicious! Doubled all spices and pulled a trick I use when baking brownies and chocolate cakes: coffee.  Instead of 1 C hot water I used 1/3 C coffee (french roast) from this morning, microwaved, then added 2/3 C hot water.  If I had the time I would have made an espresso instead (Dancing Deer - best gingerbread ever - adds espresso powder to theirs).  Something about coffee makes complex baked goods taste richer.  So coffee, organic unsulphered blackstrap molasses, evaporated cane juice sugar, and double spices make a deep dark moist gingerbread.  Like my grandma used to make!

I have to admit, I didn't try this recipe as is- hence the 4 star rating as I feel like that it what it would have been had I followed the recipe exactly.  I read reviews and decided to use 1/4 c butter and a 1/2 c apple sauce, cut the molasses to 3/4 cup and only added 3/4 cup water, used 1/2 c brown sugar instead of white sugar, and I doubled all spices and added a tsp of nutmeg.  These changes gave the gingerbread a strong, bold flavor while still being moist.  I also had to adjust the baking time- I baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  Any longer, and I would have had a dry/burnt disaster.

This was a heavenly cake!  I did follow the advice of other users and doubled the ginger and cinnamon,
added 1/2 cup applesauce to make the cake extra moist, and checked it after 45 min to make sure it didn't burn.  I won't ever use another recipe!  This was the base for my Pumpkin Gingerbread Trifle-gingerbread cake, pumpkin custard and fresh whipped cream!  YUM!  I love the fall!

Very Easy to Bake But Bland    This cake is a snap to make and bake, and it bakes up fluffy and light.  It is excellent with whipped cream or ice cream, but this cake is really too plain and bland to be worthwhile without the extra oomph from those items.

This recipe is really delicous! I was surprised that it didn't call for any milk in this recipe. It turned out so moist and rich. The only thing I did different was added a Tbsp of cinnamon instead of a tsp, but kept everything else the same. I definitely will make it again! Next time I think I'll add in some dried cranberries to make it a little more Christmasy.

This was my first time making gingerbread, and it turned out great! I took many reviewers' suggestions and doubled the spices. I also switched up the flour--used 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour, and the remaining cup was all purpose. I made a simple glaze to pour on top(while still warm) of 3 tbsp. lemon juice and 2/3 cup of powdered sugar. The glaze sets while the bread cools and nicely complements the gingerbread flavor. It would be great with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream on top as well. I'll definitely be making this again, it's the perfect treat to enjoy around Christmastime!

I made this bread in small loaf pans and placed them in clear winter-themed bags tied with ribbon as our annual Christmas dessert.  The gingerbread smelled wonderful with all the spices.  They rose beautifully in the oven and came out moist.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top for a snowy decoration, but that is a no-no.  Unless you powder and serve the bread right away, the moisture from the molasses will melt the confectioner's sugar and leave an ugly mess on top.  P.s. It was the first time I used molasses and boy did it stink!  It did wonders for the gingerbread, though.  We received many compliments.

This gingerbread is the best I've made, but I must confess I did double the spices as spices vary from brand to brand.  I also used Brer Rabbit unsulphured molasses and started checking the baking time at 40 minutes. With my oven, the gingerbread was finished in 43 minutes. We enjoyed this with topped whipping cream.  Thanks for sharing.  It is now my favorite as it is flavorful, but not an over-powering gingerbread.

Like the other reviewers I doubled the spices.  I also baked in a bundt pan - baked for 45 minutes rather than 1 hour.  Perfectly done.  After the cake cooled, I dusted with powdered sugar.    Beautiful and tasty!

Great gingerbread.  Definitely improves with age, so make it a few days ahead. You may have to hide it though.  Increased the spices by about 1/2 and used hot milk instead of water.

A excellent gingerbread recipe.  I love to use it like a shortcake, using juicy peaches and whipping cream.  Yummy!

This is the BEST gingerbread!  This is the exact recipe my grandma always used (I compared ingredients and all were the same - measurements and all - only exception was hers called for shortening instead of butter).  We always put a dallop of Cool Whip on it and then sprinkled with powdered sugar. Glad to see it posted to allrecipes! Thanks :0)

Delicious gingerbread.  I made this recipe for my husband for Valentine's Day.  Not only did he eat the entire thing by the next day, he made himself another one - and he does NOT like to cook.  That makes it a winner in my book!
Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent gingerbread.  My brother (who works at Starbucks) and my husband both devour by the pound the Starbucks gingerbread and gave this one rave reviews.  My father was excited because it smelled and tasted just like a childhood recipe from Holland called Tuf Tuf.  Will be making on a regular basis!

We have been using this recipe as a quick snack ever since the weather turned cold. It is so quick and simple to make and really has the best flavor. Add a dollop of whipped cream to the cake while it is warm and it's the perfect winter night dessert.

Easy to make and delicious cake.  A sure keeper - and will be one of my Xmas cakes. I added 5 teaspoons of ginger for an really strong gingery taste.

A wonderful, moist, dense cake. Not sweet, goes great with ice cream.  Lots of flavor. Quick to prepare. Springform pan works great for easy removal to serve warm.

The recipe is a good place to start.  Followed some of the suggestions by reviewers:  doubled all spices, added a half cup of applesauce, used half brown and half white sugar, used coffee for water, and put in a teaspoon of nutmeg.  I do agree that an hour is too long to bake.  Mine took about 45 minutes, but it helps to check very often after 35 or 40 minutes in a square Pyrex pan, with a knife during the last ten minutes, as it can get "done" all of a sudden.  Glazed with a lemon juice and powdered sugar glaze and served with whipped cream.  It was simply the best gingerbread I have ever tasted--dense, moist, spicy, and received rave reviews from all family members--and we generally like fairly intense flavors.  Some folks don't.  Personally, I don't think that recipes like this need to be made into a "new" recipe when alterations are made.  It's a very nice basic recipe, and changes can lead cooks in many directions and encourage experimentation.  This ended up a real winner!

I just finished my second piece of this gingerbread!  It is too good to have just one...easy to make, and easier to enjoy.  I'd give it 10 stars plus a gold medal.  Yummy...

The amount of molasses in this is overpowering. As written here, the gingerbread has a flavor of molasses and nothing else. Further, an hour is far too long as baking time for this.

in a 9x13 and pour a delicious Lemon Sauce over. This is a great

I read some other reviewers and took their recommendations; use UNSULPHERED molasses, I doubled and may triple the cinnamon, ginger and clove next time and used 1/2 cup applesauce.  I had to bake about 70 minutes which is not unusual for my oven for some reason and it may have something to do with being at 7,500 feet although I am not certain.  I did not have applesauce so I put a large apple and some water in a blender.

Wonderful! I doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup applesauce. I'll definitely make this again! I made so many things for Christmas but this was one of my favorites. Next time I think I would try half molasses with half honey. I think that would be better for my taste. I used unsulphured molasses as someone suggested.

This is the recipe my mother used over 60 years ago and it's still a winner!  I did not need to add or substitute anything because I used all fresh spices - if you use old spice, then you need to add more to get the same flavor.  Thanks to Charles for sharing this with us.

I made this recipe exactly as listed and this does not taste like the homemade gingerbread that i grew up on.  It had practically no ginger flavor.  Essentially, it tasted like Molasses Bread.   I'm afraid to make it with more ginger because I don't know how much more I would need to add to make it taste like gingerbread.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this had very little flavor, and after baking for an hour was a tad dry. We were unimpressed...Would not make again, sorry.

A-. Recipe is good as is, however I baked in a bundt cake pan and 40 mins was sufficient. Any more time and it would've been burnt. Thanks

It was dry for me.  Luckily I served it with homemade whipped cream and my guests thought it was wonderful.  I can't tell if I overcooked it because the cake was done when I checked it after only 30 minutes of baking.  I was shocked that my knife came out clean...good thing I checked it!  Not sure why this recipe states it takes 1 hour to bake, but I guess I should check my oven now to make sure the temperature is correct because mine cooked in literally half the time and probably was done sooner...hence my dry cake.

Perfect dense gingerbread- just cook it only 35-40 minutes. I have made this many times and it has never come out dry and I don't add applesauce. I do add extra spices though because we prefer it that way. I have made this many times and love it! Thanks!

So, so, so good.  I added 1/2 cup of apple butter and doubled the cinnamon and ginger.  Came out with a really deep spice flavor and it's very moist.  Next time I'll cut the white sugar in half - I don't think it needs it.  

I made the vanilla sauce from this site to pour over it - it turned out just like I remember from when I was a kid.  Delicious - thank you!

Nice moist cake. A bit too much molasses for my taste, will cut back next time. I used heaping measurements for spices as other reviewers suggested it needed more spice. I also decreased baking time, just over 35 mins. but I have a hot oven.

This was really easy to make and tasty. For some reason I feel like there is something missing. Maybe next time I will make it with orange juice and add a bit of apple sauce or something to make it a little bit more moist. Otherwise, the flavours were great.

Truly was the best gingerbread I've ever made. I too increased the cinnamon and ginger. Absolutely delicious. Nice soft, chewy texture.

Made this with double the cinnamon and ginger. cut the water by a 1/4 cup and replaced with oil. Baked in a bundt for 45 minutes. Cake came out moist and full of flavor. Was better the next day, still moist. Great warm with coffee. Will make again

Delicious! Mine was done in 40-45 minutes, didn't take a full hour. Made it "as is", but would be even better with more spices.

This gingerbread is absolutely delicious. If you like it spicy, then spice it up - I tried it both with extra spices and without and loved both versions.

Oh my heavens, this is divine!  Doubled spices as some had suggested and mine was done in 45 minutes.  Drizzled a light lemon glaze over the cooled cake.  Such a great autumn treat!

I've made this several times and its always amazing. What a wonderful recipe! I took the advice of another review and add 1/2 cup of applesauce. Then I just dust the cake with powdered sugar and serve with cream. WONDERFUL recipe.

I saw Foodlover's review yesterday and then couldn't shake the desire to make gingerbread  Others recommended increasing the amount of ginger, which I increased to 2 tsp., and I'm glad I did.  I would add even more next time.  The gingerbread is very moist, and it rises well.  I recommend it!

I make this in a shaped bundt pan and dust with powder sugar (to highlight the design).  I had more compliments from this cake than any other dessert I made over the holidays (and I make a lot).  Absolutely wonderful, moist gingerbread - best you will try.

I don't get it. I must have done something wrong but I don't what, I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out very heavy and very dense. I'll stick with my traditional Betty Crocker recipe which is MUCH better.

Oh wow this is so soo yummy!!!  I bake all the time, but this was my first time making gingerbread, and my dad who loves gingerbread raved about it!  I doubled the spices, used white whole wheat flour, added 1/2 cup of applesauce. I can't stop eating it:)

I really wanted this to come out perfect but it ended up being dry baked for an hour... I should have read the other reviews but I was actually letting my 13 year old help me bake this... It smelled so heavenly while baking, we served with whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon on top! :)

We made this to the letter, except we had to use margarine instead of butter for a lactose intolerant person.  I was concerned that this might cause the cake to be dry but that was not the case.  This cake is outstanding, but you have to like the flavor of molasses and gingerbread in general!  This particular recipe creates a slightly crispy crust on top that everyone fought to get!  Thanks!

This was delicious! I doubled up on the spices as others suggested and it came out great. The first time I made it, it came out sort of dry because one hour in my oven was too long. The next time I made it I used hot carnation milk instead of hot water and I let it bake for only 40 minutes. It was melt in your mouth good. I sent it to my relatives on the east coast and they loved it. This is definitely a keeper!

Easy to make but somewhat bland.  I like flavorful, robust food and am not afraid of a little spice.  In keeping with other reviewer's suggestions, I added extra cinnamon and ginger plus added nutmeg.  The end result is quite good but not the rich, zesty gingerbread I was hoping for.  Also, I had no problem with the bake time.  I checked it after 45 minutes but it wasn't done all the way so I baked it for the recommended hour and it came out fine.

I might make this again because of how easy it is to prepare but I will keep searching for a recipe that yields the strong gingerbread flavor that I am looking for.

Delicious, but start checking after 40 minutes. I have made it twice. The first time I baked if for 55 minutes and it was a little dry. The second time I baked it for 47 minutes and it was still a little dry. Nrxt time I'm going to try 40 minutes.

This is GREAT! I made it just as directed for the ingredients, but I baked this in an 8x8 clear glass baking dish, at 350' F for 30 minutes, lowered the temp to 325' F and let it bake 30 more minutes (until a knife came out clean) and covered it with parchment so it wouldn't get dark too fast (but that sort of stuck to it, so...). This came out perfect! Flavor, texture and moisture wise, it's just right! I topped this with fresh whipped cream. This will be my go to recipe for now on.

This was great.  I took the advice of a few other reviewers and added a bit more spice (1 1/2 tsps ginger and 2 tsp cinnamon) and could have even added a bit more.  The molasses really came through and it smelled delicious while baking! I ended up running out of all-purpose flour and had to use cake flour instead (I just added less baking soda and less salt) and it still turned out.  It's fragrant, moist and tasty!

Dry. Nobody would eat it either. I gave a big chunk of it to my brother and his girlfriend and they were all excited (or so they said) to dig into it. Well...
A week later I was at their house and there on the microwave sat the gingerbread, still untouched. I won't make this again.

out of all the gingerbread recipes on allrecipes, i chose this one because of it being so basic. it is a wonderful recipe. i made no changes or add on's except i did take the advise of a few reviewers to double the cinnamon and ginger. it came out very moist, despite what some viewers said. just a all around wonderful spicey cake. very pleased. will keep this as my gingerbread recipe.

Omigosh! Delicious! However, I did change the recipe a bit. I used 2 tbl butter and 1/2c and 2tbl applesauce to make it low fat, used 40g honey and 40g sugar instead of molasses, and only 2tbl white sugar. However, the bread was still pretty sweet! I also added 50g walnuts, 30g raisins, and 30g craisins. I also aded 2tsp ginger and 1.5tsp cinnamon and no cloves. I also reduced the salt a bit. I baked at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. The bread was moist and delicious!  Next time, I think I will add more nuts. But the backbone of this recipe was GREAT!

Wonderful recipe!

I doubled the cinnamon and clove.  I added the recommended amount of ground ginger but then I also added 6tsp of freshly grated ginger root.
Baked it in a loaf pan instead of the 9x9 square.  It was delicious with a spoonful of whipped cream.

The taste is great, spicy. I added more cinnamon but did not double the spices.  I did add 2/3 cu apple sauce-- the batter had the consistency of glue. Not good. I added water but cut back a little to compensate for extra applesauce. The consistency got better. I baked it and it cracked like the Arizona desert- I mean big cracks! Baked in convection oven for 50 minutes and checked. The top was leathery, the upper most layer good cake-like, the middle layer more like pudding. I used a 9x5 silicon bake-ware. What went wrong? The convection oven? Should I have used regular oven instead? Too much appleasauce? Too much water? Someone please help me!!:(
I will try and post of picture of my Arizona Desert Old Fashioned Gingerbread.

I took the suggestion to triple the spice and add 1/2c apple sauce I also used light corn syrup instead of molasses as my husband isn't a huge fan of it. I also added lemon extract to make the ginger pop.the cake turned out awesome moist and lots of flavor served with baked apples and whip cream a huge hit! thanks

Great flavor and very easy recipe!  I doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup applesauce. For some reason, it was done about 20 minutes before the recipe called for (my oven usually bakes fast, though).  The bread was still a little drier than I wanted, but much better than other gingerbread recipes I've tried... especially with some cold whipped cream on top!

Very good and my cake was (and is still) very moistorous. 

I thought adding spices to the dough, but didn't do that in practise. Should have. So I noticed too that doubling or triplening cinnamon and clove would be good. But the structure's wonderful, so soft and springy. Whipped cream was used now, but I must try this also with vanilla icecream. 

I made my cake from glutenfree flours with half a teaspoon of xanthan gum. Worked perfectly.

I'll do again some year with extra spices. And the using of the fresh ginger sounded really like a thing just waiting to be tried. I guess that with a little variation this will turn out as a five star recipe.

This has too much molasses for my taste! I prefer the pumpkin gingerbread recipe to this one. It has that nice spice taste w/o being so dark. Also, check after 50 min. as it burned a bit on the bottom at an hour.

Incredible!!!  My husband is a huge fan of gingerbread and said this was "PERFECT"  He was worried when I said I was making it from scratch.  I did take the advice of other reviews and doubled the spices, used 2/3 c of full flavor molasses and added 1/4 cup sour cream for moistness.  It was amazing.... the BEST we've ever had.  It was done in 25 mins.  Thanks so much for this incredible recipe... We will be making for the remainder of our lives.... Hubby can't quit smiling!!!!

Taste was outstanding! Went perfectly at our Tudor feast with applesauce.

Would recommend using 1/2 of the molasses when using the dark molasses.

I left the recipe as it was written. I didn't have a sifter, so I used a metal mesh drainer, and put the dry ingredients in it, over a bowl, and then using a table knife, stirred until they fell through. I also used a 7x11 glass oblong pan, sprayed with cooking spray instead of grease and flour. I baked it for 40 minutes, and it was perfect. We let it cool slightly and served with whipped cream. It was great. The cake lasted a day and a half and my family is begging me for more. Mmmm. Great recipe, Charles. You're the Gingerbread Man!

This has turned into my most requested dessert!  I made it in a 9" sprinform pan, and it looked gorgeous on a plate that way.  I serve it with vanilla frozen yogurt, and homemade caramel sauce.

Made according to directions.  However, followed the advice of other reviewer's and double the spices. I wish I had not done that because the flavor was too intense for me. I intend  to make the recipe again but this time follow the recipe exactly.

5 stars with modifications mentioned by multiple reviewers.  Increase cinnamon to 2 tsp, increase ginger to 1.5 tsp, add 1/2 cup of applesauce.  Cooks faster than 1 hour (done in 45 minutes).  Very important note: 1 star if you use blackstrap molasses (not sweet at all).  You need to use unsulfered molasses.

I accidentally omitted the water the first time I made this and the results were really awesome!  It was like a dense gingerbread chewy brownie!  Please try it with a little less water and with double spices, it's really great BUT it might burn out your electric mixer because it's super dense!

Perfect Christmas Day dessert - I doubled the spices as others suggested, except for the cloves which I used just a rounded 1/2 t. and the salt I kept as listed.  I cut out 2 tablespoons of the butter and put in 3/4 cup of applesauce.  It was perfect.  I used a 9 inch round cake pan, started checking at 40min.  I ended up cutting the temp to 335 as it was getting overdone on the outside and underdone in center.  Total cooking time was 46 minutes.  Since the pan was dark/coated I should have kept the cooking temp down from the beginning. Excellent recipe, didn't need icing, served w/ vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.

This has become my favorite gingerbread recipe. Everyone who has tried this has LOVED it. I doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup of applesauce to the recipe as the comments have recommended and I definitely agree it makes for a more flavorful bread. I have used this recipe to make one big loaf, mini loafs, muffins, mini muffins. The muffins do not need nearly as long to bake so you have to watch them or they will come out dry.

This recipe uses too much molasses. It baked nicely and it was moist.  But the taste was bitter and tasted like you were drinking molasses out of the bottle. a shame because it looked beautiful.

Perfect! I loved this recipe! Exactly like my mom used to make when I was a child. I followed the advice of some and doubled the cinnamon and ginger, but I really didn't need to, it would've been fine and next time I won't. Not dry at all, I think people might be used to really moist (almost damp) cakes these days. One other thing that might affect dryness is that an hour is a long time to cook depending on you oven, check at 45 minutes, and every 5 mins thereafter. I cooked this in my brand new Nordicware Yule Log pan, and it fit perfectly and was absolutely beautiful! Sprinkled it with a little powdered sugar to look like a dusting of snow, and served with whip cream (or cool whip) and our gingerbread Yule Log is a new tree decorating and Christmas Eve tradition for us! Thanks for sharing.

Quintessential (and by that I mean perfect!) gingerbread. As is my wont when making most anything "spicy," I doubled the callled-for spices, added a dash (about an eighth of a teaspoon) of white pepper, and a splash (couple of tablespoons ... all I had left over from breakfast) of black coffee (as a part of the called-for hot water).

So good and warming on a chilly November morning! Thanks, Charles!

Moist, flavourful and highly requested!!! I made this for Thanksgiving dessert and it was a huge hit. I didn't have an egg, so I used 1/4 c of pumpkin purée instead, doubled the spices and it was only 50 min in my oven.  So moist and delicious - definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

This cake was a bit dry and blander than I was going for as is. Made it again with a few changes...

Use brown sugar, not white.
Use hot coffee instead of hot water.
Double the spices (but maybe not the cloves, depending on your preferences!).
Add 1/2 c. of Greek yogurt or apple sauce for moisture.

Bake 50-55 mins instead of 60, just until toothpick comes out clean.

The cake was good as written, but exceptional with the above changes! Served with a homemade caramel sauce (butter, cream, sugar, vanilla, salt - easy to find a simple recipe) and perhaps a bit of vanilla bean ice cream or whipped cream, takes the cake from incredibly delicious to over-the-top good! I'll be making this again and again once the cooler weather hits.

Truth be told I have a really hard time following recipes and with baking I know it is essential. Using a few tips from other reviews, a moist and perfectly flavored cake emerged out of the oven. Using an additional 1/2 cup of applesauce and 2tsp each of cinnamon and pumpkin spice was the perfect balance.  
Now for another confession....the topping was another story. I began with a cup(ish) of heavy whipping cream, added 3 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. The finished product was a velvety, creamy, lightly sweetened topping. Woohoo! I will now have beautiful and yummy dreams of one fabulous cake. ;-)

It had a good texture, but the only flavour it had was of molasses. I didn't even use fancy or black strap, just regular molasses, and it was still overwhelming. Luckily, the men in the family loved it, but the women thought it was pretty gross except for the cream cheese frosting. Next time I will cut the molasses with maple syrup and double the spices.

I made fantastic mini muffins using this recipe and some of the reviews.  I did not double molasses as even with 1 cup the molasses flavor is quite strong. I did double the spices and I replaced the cup of hot water with a cup of applesauce. I cooked the muffins at 350 for 16 minutes.

Made this today for a group dessert.  Substituted brown sugar & used about 1 &1/4 cups - I had no molasses in the house.  Added vanilla & used milk mixed w organic yogurt for the liquid.  Smelled & tasted WUNDERBAR !!  Adults & kids both ate it up :)
Great winter-time treat.  Yes, we have winter in Texas too.

Really delicious and moist. My only critic is that it needs more spice. I used unprocessed Marri honey instead of molasses and it was to die for. Added 3 heaped tsp of fresh grated ginger, 3tsp mixed spice and 2 tsp of garam marsala (may seem like an odd addition but I didn't have ground cloves and I love it's spiciness.). That might seem like a lot of spice but I love the sweet, spicy and gingery flavour. Baked it in a 9inch square tin and it was done after 45mins.

I was really disappointed with this recipe, and after reading the reviews realized that it was because I had used blackstrap molasses. The texture was amazing and it was lovely and moist but I think that it's important to specify in the recipe what kind of molasses should be used for the best result. Blackstrap is vile.

I followed other reviews and doubled the spices, turned out delicious! When it comes to the baking time, I find it's best to cover the cake half way through baking time with tin foil to prevent over-browning. I took the cake out of the oven when the toothpick inserted in the center had a few moist crumbs attached. The cake was fluffy and moist. I will be making this again.

This is a good basic recipe but seems to need a lot of revisions. I took the advice of the reviewers and doubled the spices, and used 1 3/4 water. I also used unsulphured molasses as another reviewer recommended.  The gingerbread was very moist and had a nice dark color, but was on the bitter side, although my six year old did still like it. Next time we'll reduce the molasses to try and reduce the bitterness (we used the full 1 cup), and will probably try and add a sweet lemon glaze, or cream cheese as others recommended to balance out the taste or something else to balance out (this is not a sweet gingerbread recipe so good if you're looking for something less sweet but some sweetness will be complimentary).  Might also consider tripling the cinnamon as one of the reviewers recommended.  We did not try the applesauce.  We found it was ready in slightly less than 1 hr.

Super good with doubling the spices and adding half cup of apple sauce to make it more moist. My cake did split a little at the top, but don't worry. I also turned down the heat to 425 from other reviews and cut off a few minutes. 
I will be making this again for the holidays.

This gingerbread came out perfect texture and flavor! Thank sooo much for sharing this! it was my first time making a gingerbread and I will certainly do it again! I doubled the spices, used 3/4cup of UNSULPHERED  molasses and added 1/2cup of applesauce as suggested by others. I also substituted the 1/2cup of white sugar for 1/2 cup of pure maple syrup and WOW was it incredible! I chose to do this because maple syrup is a better alternative to refined table sugar (easier for the body to break down). Thanks again!!!!! :D

I thought this recipe was great as is. I made it exactly as written except I bake it in cupcake pans. I baked them for about 15 minutes. They were mild, moist, and enjoyed by everyone who tried them. This recipe will enter my tried-and-true collection!

I made the recipe as listed and holy molasses! Overwhelming molasses flavor. I made it again, used 1/2 cup molasses and 1/2 cup brown sugar and it was much sweeter and less intense. I also upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons and the ground ginger to 3 teaspoons. It was a much bigger hit in my home this time. My pregnant wife ate the whole loaf!

This is one of those reliable and almost never fail recipes.  Wonderful with lemon sauce or whipped cream.    Adjust spices to taste.   If someone tried this with blackstap molasses am not sure the results would be good.......nearly always if a recipe calls for molasses blackstrap is clearly stated.  So....if it is not a success it would be better to make as the contributor printed it.

Excellent! I added just a splash of vegetable oil, and doubled all seasonings, except the salt.  Tastes great with powdered sugar, whipped cream, or trader joe's cookie butter.

Delicious! I doubled the ginger and cloves--I was using an extra strong cinnamon so I added about 2/3 tsp extra of that as well. The flavor was rich and delicious--you could SMELL how delightfully spicy this was.

I used a pan to make little gingerbread man cakes and it worked beautifully. Am looking forward to making this into a regular sized cake and topping it with whipped cream or ice cream.

just had a piece, even with my changes this is awesome. the reason i'm giving it 3 stars is because i had to make changes to make this awesome. it's so good it made me curse lol i've been looking for a gingerbread recipe, buying it at starbucks adds up & theirs is full of who knows what so i like to make stuff instead.  anyway when i read through this recipe i knew that there was no way in the world that it would be enough "spice/ginger" to make this taste like a gingerbread.  my changes. i used oat flour, kept the butter & also added some applesauce. i also used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 2 teaspoons of ginger, a little bit more cloves, also added a dash or two of nutmeg  i ran out of molasses so i only wound up using a half cup since that's all i had left, this is so good, nice & moist & since i added more spices, gingery. once i get to the store tomorrow to get more molasses i will be baking it again:) if i use the applesauce again i'll do half sauce & half butter

very good with double the spices except the cloves and it doesn't need the applesauce unless you are replacing the butter with the applesauce.  I have not tried that yet.

Very good recipe, the cake came out very moist and had an excellent spiced taste.  I would recommend doing a Glaze (1/2 cup powder sugar +2-3 tbsp hot water).  It complements the spice flavor real well.

this was the first time I ate gingerbread in the form of a loaf and the first time I made it. It seemed like a lot of molasses. I might cut the molasses in half next time. Anyone else find the molasses to be too much?

Amazing! As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the spices--and added a 1/4 cup of applesauce, since I was nervous about adding too much liquid. Made an orange/vanilla glaze, topped with pecans and it was absolutely amazing.

I have made a similar version with 1/3 c cocoa added for a delish chocolate twist :) [I did reduce flour by 1/4 c when I added cocoa tho]
I do add 1 tsp ginger for every cup of flour, so this had 2.5 tsp ginger; and I used brown sugar because we don't get molasses and it still tasted great!
I've also made it with oil (just reduce the quantity of butter a little because of the water content)

This was my first time making gingerbread from scratch. It is airy and cake like than if you were to make an actual dense loaf, although it is also quite moist. I used an 8x11 pan and coated with non stick spray. I would highly recommend using a thick coat of butter and possibly a light dust of flour. The molasses makes the batter very sticky. I read the reviews on doubling the spices after I had already put the pan in the oven. I actually think it has great flavor as is. I think anymore spice would be too over powering. I used the exact measurements of ginger and cinnamon. I don't like cloves so the only change I made was that instead of cloves I used about 1 tbs of Penzey's Cake Spice. (it contains clove and anise and other spices). I baked my bread for about 40-45 minutes in a gas oven. I think 1 hour is too long as my edges were already starting to almost burn. Over all this was a great and easy gingerbread to make in a pinch. I will be putting this into regular rotation!

This turned out wonderfully moist and absolutely delicious! I doubled the spices and it turned out with a deep dark rich flavor. I used a 9" springform pan and ended up with a nice tall cake. It was done perfectly in about 45 minutes. I will definitely be making this again.

This is best served warm with whip cream and caramel sauce. A tad dry, should have added applesauce. Overall, everyone raves about it!

This gingerbread recipe is WONDERFUL... dense and flavorful and exactly the way my grandma used to make it! Like other reviewers I also doubled up on the spices, and only cooked it for 45 minutes in a loaf pan... it was perfect. I'll never search for another gingerbread recipe again, this one is IT! Thanks for sharing.

This gingerbread recipe is WONDERFUL... dense and flavorful and exactly the way my grandma used to make it! Like other reviewers I also doubled up on the spices, and only cooked it for 45 minutes in a loaf pan... it was perfect. I'll never search for another gingerbread recipe again, this one is IT! Thanks for sharing.

This is the best gingerbread I have ever made. I used 1 1/2tsp. cinnamon and ginger, instead of 1tsp. Any other recipe I have will be put in recycle.

This was very good gingerbread just as it was.  Next time I will increase the spices as some other reviewers suggested and I think that will make it absolutely wonderful.

This cake is VERY moist.  It has nice flavor, but it is not spicy, so I can see that doubling the spices would be a good idea on this one and I'll try that next time.  Overall, very nice cake and could be very versatile with toppings/sauces, etc.  Mine was done at 45 mins.

Rating this exactly as written.  There is not a strong enough ginger taste- the molasses overpowers all the spices.  This is the second time I've made it.  The first time I think I must have read the reviews and tossed in extra spices because I LOVED the results, but this time I measured everything exactly and it just wasn't that great.  I also made muffins and got 24, which I will be taking to work, even though they don't taste that great.  Definitely worth making, just make sure to multiply the spices.

Dark, moist and tasty. We couldn't stop eating it.
And it was easy. I predict I'll be making this a lot.
I didn't have cloves and I changed the cinnamon and ginger to 1 1/2 teaspoons as others had recommended. A keeper.

I used 1/4 C. White Sugar + 1/4 C. Brown Sugar and 1/2 C. shortening rather than butter.  Upped the Cinnamon & Ginger to 1 1/2 t. each.  Used 8 X 8 glass pan & baked at 325 degrees for one hour.  The cake was perfectly moist and rose to the top of the glass pan - dusted each piece of the cake with sifted confectioners sugar - YUMMY even on day two as the cake is slightly more moist.  My Fiance' who does not like Molasses LOVED THIS CAKE !!

I'm not a uge gingerbread fan, but I wanted to make this as a gift.  I made it as a loaf, which was fine, but I think this needed to be a little lighter on the molasses.  Next time, I'm going use half a cup of molasses and substitute the other half cup with light corn syrup.

This was by far one of the best gingerbreads I have ever had.  I did double the spices as suggested by another reviewer, but that was all I changed.  It was just what we needed on a snowy morning.  It occurred to me once I tasted it, that if raisins were added to it, it would be like eating homemade hermits.  Definitely five stars.

I really love this, but I did change the recipe based on other reviews and what I had on hand.  I only had 1/4 cup butter, so I used that plus 1/2 cup applesauce.  I didn't have molasses, so I used 1/2 cup brown sugar plus 1/2 cup honey.  I doubled the cinnamon and ginger to 2 teaspoons each, didn't have cloves, and put in a generous splash of pumpkin pie spice.  The batter was very runny, but the end result was delicious.  I used a 9x5 loaf pan.  Served it with honey nut cream cheese - yum!

I doubled the spices and added a half cup of apple sauce per others suggestions and baked in an 8x8 pan (instead of 9x9) with no issues. Make sure not to over-bake. Tastes amazing warmed up with home made whipped cream. Next time I'll try ice cream!

This was super easy to make and it tastes great. Not really for kids or many younger people I know but most adults love it. Real gingerbread just screams Christmas to me. I didn't quite double the spice as some people suggested and I still found it to be quite flavouful. It was very moist as well.

This is delicious! I followed the recipe to a T except that I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I added a 1/4 cup of pumpkin puree that I was trying to use up. So good! I hope there's some left for the rest of the family by the time they get home.

This is way too spicy for me and is very heavy on the molasses.  I will decrease the spices and molasses by half next time and use applesauce to make up for it.  The molasses actually leaves wet residue on the plate.

OK, now this rocks. I served it at a tea party fresh out of the oven and everyone raved and raved. It melts in your mouth! I used about 1/4 cup fresh ground ginger and doubled all other spices. Added a little more hot water too....about 1 1/8 cup

I doubled the spices in this recipe, but I still found it to be bland tasting. It isn't a bad recipe, but it seems to be missing something that will bring out the flavor of the ginger. It did, however, come out very moist, and the texture was wonderful!

I tried making this a couple of times but each time the gingerbread comes out more like a tan/khaki color rather than dark brown. I followed the recipe exactly except I used oil instead of butter. What am I doing wrong? How do I get it to be as dark brown as it in in the pictures?

WATCH OUT!  The reviewer on Nov. 14/2010 is right!  Be aware of the type of molasses you use.  I had the unsulphured, but it was Blackstrap, and the cake turned out VERY bitter.  I liked the consistency, moistness, height, but heeded previous reviewers and added 2 TB vegetable oil plus mixed cream with the water, and it could still stand a little more fat.  I also doubled the spices, and used half brown sugar/half white.  Baked for 55min at 325 in 8 x 11 GLASS pan.  Was very molasses-y, so would probably cut that back to 3/4 cup too, and will try again with a lighter molasses...but the house smelled good!

I love the smell of gingerbread.  This recipe comes out perfect every time.  I add a bit of fresh whipped heavy cream and viola!

delicious and moist! not a super-sweet gingerbread, which I love--more spicy than sweet. I went heavy on the spices as most of the people that reviewed this recipe did. I suggest mixing it as little as possible for optimal softness--the second time I made this I mixed the batter a bit too long and it turned out a bit tough. Otherwise PERFECT! **delicious topped with lemon curd**

This is delicious.  I used my gluten free flour and added 1/2 Cup applesauce (because making things gluten free can often make them dry) and it turned out great!  Very moist.  I would definitely make this again.

What a lovely cake.  You need to be a little heavy handed with your spices, which is key to this cake.  I wanted it to be moist, so I subbed heavy cream for the hot water, but I like another reviewer's suggestion about using orange juice instead.  Definitely halve the molasses - I used half the amount, and although I could taste it, it wasn't overwhelming.  I can't imagine how strong it would've been had I used the whole 1 cup.  Use brown sugar instead of white.  Also, 1 hour of baking would've been way too long.  I think 45 minutes is more appropriate (at least for my oven).

Excellent recipe!!  Although modifications are definitely recommended.  As suggested in previous reviews, doubling the spices is the way to go.  I saw one or two suggestions for replacing the hot water with coffee.  I took that a step further and replaced it with chicory coffee.  The spiciness of the chicory really gave it some fantastic flavor.    **Note! The first time I made this I made it with chicory coffee and blackstrap molasses.  Holy moly!!  It was one super rich and dark gingerbread!! I didn't care for it and would suggest using normal molasses, but my wife loved it, so if you think that might be your thing, give it a shot!

I tried baking this in a muffin tin and then frosting with cream cheese frosting.  I followed others' advice to double the spices and add half a cup of applesauce to make it more moist.  Even so, I would say this is too dry and bready to make a good cupcake.  This is the sort of quickbread that should be baked in a loaf pan and sliced for brunch.

I don't know if I have ever had gingerbread before making this recipe. I did enjoy it very much. If you like a spicier cake, you might want to double the spices as many have recommended. I baked mine in a 10" springform pan and it took about 45 minutes. I am wondering if this cake should be baked at a lower temperature. Many posters mention that theirs started to burn. I ended up putting foil over the top of mine after 30 minutes. Not sure if it is the molasses that makes it burn. However, do keep watch on this cake. I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and served with a high quality ice cream. Delicious!!!

You really have to like the taste of 'gingerbread' or molasse to enjoy this recipe. If not, skip and get another recipe.  It wasn't as moist as many claim....nor was it five star worthy.

I did this: 1/2 c white sugar 1/2 c salted butter 1 egg 2 1/2 c flour 1 1/2 tsp. flour 2 tsp. cinnamon 1 1/2 tsp. ginger 1/2 tsp (heaping) clove 1 tsp vanilla 1 c. hot water 3/4 c. Molasses  (I ran out, and used honey to fill the gap) 1/4 c. honey     Baked for about 40 minutes in my large spring form pan.   Cake is beautifully moist and light, spices are absolutely there, with a slow heat that creeps up but it is not overly spiced. It *could* have a bit more clove, but this is great.  Not too sweet, not too much Molasses.  I have a feeling that those complaining about Molasses might be using a different brand than some of us. I attempted to find out which molasses I was using but the garbage has already been taken out. :( sorry!  I will definitely use this recipe again! Thank you for sharing it, and thank you to all of you reviewers who came before me! :D

Doubling all spices is a must.  Used Brer Rabbit molasses, it has a nice strong flavor.  Added 1/2T of vanilla.  Also agree with less cooking time.  Mine was done in 45 min. Tasted fantastic, my kids loved it.

This was a waste of the ingredients and I didn't eat most of the batch.   It calls for way too much molasses, which overpowers all the other flavors (even with doubled spices), and it was too deep for the pan, so it dries out before it's cooked through.  Have the positive reviewers of this recipe not ever had great gingerbread before?

Fan-flippin'-tastic! I doubled the spices, added 1/4 cup of chopped crystalized ginger, made it in a bundt pan and glazed it with a vanilla glaze and oh man, was it ever awesome. It's 25 below 0 here, and this cake is perfect on a winter day - nice and spicy, warm, dense and moist. My mother-in-law said it was just like her nana used to make! Quite the compliment!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good! Make sure you use a good-sized pan, this will overflow (it really puffs up!). Mine was in the oven for 50 mins. when I pulled it, and it's crispy on the bottom and sides. I might bake at a lower temp. next time. I used blackstrap molasses (so VERY rich and healthy, it has 25% of your daily iron intake in 1 Tablespoon!), it's delicious in this cake. I also upped all the spices by doubling, and trust me you won't regret doing that. It's a pleasant, warm/spicy kind of cake. Perfect for the holidays!

This was very good! I made some changes to make it lower in fat. I used 1/2 corn oil and 1/2 applesauce instead of butter. I didn't have any molasses so I used lite pancake syrup. I also used dark brown sugar instead of white. I doubled the spices as suggested by another member and I agree that it needed it. I also agree to bake it for 45 minutes instead of 1 hour. It was perfectly moist enough. It sliced up beautifully. I topped it with my own recipe for a spiced drizzle.

This isn't too bad, but I'm not sure about it.  The molasses taste is strong, almost too strong for me, and I didn't have enough molasses and subbed the rest with honey.  Maybe I'm just not a huge molasses fan?  It seemed a bit bitter to me.  With whipped topping, though, I believe it will be fine.  It just doesn't have a lot of oomph to it though.  I love cloves, but I don't taste them all that much.  It also bakes up big pieces--I'd almost rather have made it in a 9X13 pan for smaller pieces. Thanks for sharing.

Very, very good!!
I followed the recipe exactly, then doubled all the spices. 
I baked it in my loaf pan for an hour & 10 mins and it turned out perfectly!!!
It is soooo moist & flavourful. 
We ate half plain, and half with an orange cream cheese sweet icing.
Very yummy!!
Will make this again.

This had a nice flavor but was very, very dry.  I cooked for 50 min.  I probably will try a different recipe next time.

I made this as written so I could give it a fair review, it was a decent cake but I wholeheartdly agree that 1 hour was WAY too long mine was done in 45 minutes, and it needs more ginger and spice to get more of a gingerbread flavor.  I made a simple glaze of butter and powdered sugar.  Next time I may use brown sugar instead of white.

This is a 5 star recipe, but only if you reduce the cooking time.  I'm so glad that I checked on the cake before an hour was up because after 45 minutes the bottom was a little darker than it should have been.  I think that a more accurate cooking time would be about 35-40 minutes.  It tastes great, but watch the cooking time for the best results.

I didn't have enough molasses, so I ended up using only about 1/2 cup, maybe a little more.  I also added some leftover canned pumpkin, about 1/2 cup. I baked mine for about 40 minutes.  It turned out great, very moist and flavorful.

Yum! I made this as written, except I increased the cinnamon and ginger to 2tsp each, and added 1/2 cup pumpkin puree just after beating in the egg. The result was moist, light and flavourful! I served it to my family with vanilla ice cream and butterscotch sauce. My brother has said he plans on finishing the cake tomorrow... he's probably not kidding, though there's more than half left!

I thought this was really good, the amount of molasses was fine. If anything you could probably skimp a tiny bit on the sugar. I made mine into cupcakes,used paper liners and got 20 good size, took about 22min to bake...could've gotten 24 if you like flat top cupcakes. I decorated with a little rosette of cream cheese frosting and some cute gingerbread men sprinkles. My hubby and son loved them.

Very good...our friends, some of whom had never had gingerbread, and all our kids couldn't stop eating it. We added 3/4 cup applesauce and it came out quite light and cakey. Next time I will leave it out as I prefer dense gingerbread. An 11x7 pan and doubling the spices was perfect, and i am going to add some other spices next time for a more complex taste.

I was looking for a gingerbread like one an old German bakery in my hometown used to make This recipe had my favorite cloves and convinced me to try it. IT WAS AWESOME! I didn't change anything. It took apx 20 mins more to bake in my speed oven than what I thought it should but it came out very moist and the flavor was superb. Everyone loved it and I am keeping this in the recipe box for definite future use.

as per the suggestions of others, i added applesauce and doubled the spices. i thought it was wonderful, very moist and flavorful -- i can't imagine this recipe without the doubled spices at least, since it seems to me it would have been very bland without them, perhaps accounting for the "too molassesy" comments. my 4-year-old son helped me make it, and gobbled it up. i will make this again.

Excellent and easy to make with just the right amount of spice. I served it with "eggnog" whipped cream - homemade whipped cream with a splash of rum and a pinch of nutmeg. It was very moist the first day but we had a leftover piece that dried out a little by the next day. My boyfriend suggested heating the cake and pouring hot custard on it (I used a can of Ambrosia custard available from UK specialty shops). This was a great pairing of flavors and made the cake perfectly moist again.

I don't like to give a bad review unless it is really really bad. But this gets 1 star. We like gingerbread, but I don't know what happened with this recipe,  it was so bad i threw the whole batch right into garbage while it was still warm! I followed recipe to a T but it tasted really awful. Very flat and left bad after taste. It was moist but the flavor wasn't like gingerbread. It may have been the cook but i won't be making this again!

My hubby made gingerbread last year and it was dry and flavorless.  He tried this recipe and it was WONDERFUL!  It was moist, full of flavor, but not too sweet.  It was good with sweetened whipped cream.  Wouldn't change a thing!

I made this and it turned out wonderful..and this is saying something as 75% of the stuff I bake is not edible!  I doubled up on the spices, however I still found it to be a bit bland (still good) but next time I will triple the measurements for that extra spicy goodness!  I added half a cup of applesauce and really think it helped with the moistness! Very yummy recipe indeed..

MMMMMM. I took another reviewer's suggestions and cut back slightly on the molasses, added sour cream and doubled the spices. It was moist and de-licious. Everyone just loved it warm and topped with whipped cream. This will be a holiday tradition for us from now on. Do NOT overbake. I baked mine for only 45 minutes and the edges were still a tad too done. I want to see if it will bake properly if I double the recipe in a 13x9" pan. This really is wonderful. Thank you so much all!

Thanks for the opportunity to try this, but it didn't go over so well on Christmas morning, since none of us finished a piece. But in the recipe's defense, I was trying to compare to the southern spicyness and moistness my family has always had. Hoping to run across the recipe I'm looking for one day! If you go with this, be sure to add extra spices, and perhaps a weak molasses.

This is a nice moist cake.  After reading the reviews I was a bit afraid of the overpowering molasses so I addid 3/4 Cup molasses and 1/4 Cup light corn syrup to take a bit of the strength away.  I also doubled the ginger and cinnamon could possibly add a bit more sugar or definatly use icing. I will make this again.

Great recipe!!  It needed more ginger in my opinion. I used 1 1/2 tsp and next time I might try 2 tsp.  I like a strong ginger flavor! Very moist and delicious!!

This is the best gingerbread I've had since my Grandma's! I doubled the cinnamon and ginger as suggested by others. I did have to watch it after 45 minutes as the edges started to brown quickly towards the end of the baking time. I serve it with a warm lemon sauce. Yum!

Simply delicious! Very moist. Personally I like the stronger flavour - used a "robust" molasses, and it was very savoury.

I was not 100% satisfied with my results with this
recipe but I think it may have been better if I had used milder molasses.  The cake was very "strong" and not as sweet as I had hoped.

I really loved how easy this cake was to make.  It went together very quickly.  Taking others suggestion, I tripled the spices.  The clove really set it off and kept it from tasting like a regular spice cake.  My cake was completely baked in 45 mins, and my oven is quite accurate.  I found that the top was just a tiny bit hard.  Perhaps from baking it on too high a rack.  Next time, I will spritz the top of the cake with some water after baking to keep the top moist.  Insulating the sides of the baking tin is a good idea to keep it from doming in the middle.  However, that's not really a problem, especially if you serve it with whipped cream or ice cream.  .Next time, I may try this using a low and slow method for cake baking, baking it around 300 degrees, like the professional bakeries do.

If you want old fashion Gingerbread this is it!!! OMG its sooooo good.  Now I read all the reviews and additions.  I did make a few  changes.   I used Splenda for white sugar.  I added 1/2 c of unsweetened applesauce in addition to the 1/2 c butter.  I did not have molasses so I used 1/2 c dark maple syrup and 1/2 c  packed dark brown sugar.  I doubled the ground cinnamon and ground ginger to 2 tsp, used 1/4 tsp of cloves and 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  For the hot water I used 1/2 c water and 1/2 c orange juice.   I mixed those together and heated in the microwave for about 45 seconds.  I am going to make more tomorrow and add 1 c chopped walnuts, 1/2 c golden raisins in one batch and 1 c Hershey's special dark chocolate  chips. I will let you know how that tastes.  Enjoy this wonderful recipe its a KEEPER!! Thank you for sharing.

This is very similar to "Favorite Gingerbread" found in the old Betty Crocker cookbooks and that is the recipe I use.  Theirs calls for boiling water, a little less flour, and dark molasses is their term.  I use Grandma's brand Molasses.  States it is unsulphured.   I absolutely LOVE  gingerbread!

Made the recipe exactly as directed except for adding 1/2c of chopped dates. The house filled with an amazing aroma and even my 2 month old grandson became hungry again! This bread was a rich molasses color and the flavor was outstanding! Dusted it with a bit of powdered sugar and wasn't a bit surprised to find the pan 1/2 empty before it had cooled. Thinking about making another pan for coffee in the morning. Thank you for an easy yummy Christmas recipe:-)

Adjust your recipe (as almost everyone in reviews agreed) by doubling the spices, adding 1/2 cup applesauce for moisture, DO NOT use BLACK STRAP MOLASSES (which dee dee pointed out the difference in the types of Molasses) because my cake had an overwhelming strong, not sweet taste of Molasses, and cook for 40 minutes - not 1 hour - my cake was burnt and extremely dry with the 1 hour cooking time. Biggest advise? Use an unsulphered Molasses - the black strap kind was horrible and drowned out the spice flavors completely. I will try again with the adjustments above. Good luck - I am sure the changes will make the cake a favorite next time.

My goodness...I just love this recipe. Had a sweet tooth and didn't have anything in the house to fix. Being so late at night, I just looked to see if I could possibly bake a gingerbread cake and this came out so marvelous. So moist. Had to eat a piece before it had cooled off. Like the others stated, I did double up on the spices and it made it scrumptious. Also used a cup and 1/4 of water. And only let it stay in for 40 min. Stuck knife in to test and it came out clean. Will definitely be making it again...*as I head in there for my 2nd piece

A very light cake in texture. It smelled so good in the oven, I could hardly wait to take it out, cool it a bit and try a piece.  I cooked mine with a shallow pan of water on the shelf underneath the gingerbread pan because I'd had bad experiences with dryness before with other gingerbread recipes. (Note to self - this was done at 45 mins.) This is a delicious recipe. Thanks, Charles!

Perfect!  I finally found this, and I'm so glad -- it's what I believe was my Irish grandma's recipe, more or less. I increased the spices and used reheated coffee instead of hot water, as my mother used to -- you know, those folk who came up during the Depression didn't waste anything.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious! Make a mistake and used an 8" pan instead and it bubbled over into my oven. Make sure you use a 9" pan ??
I will make this again in the near future and use it as a go to recipe for the holidays!!

THIS cake is amazing ...really really. If your looking for an old fashioned style gingerbread cake, this it it. I did (as others suggested) double the spices and you could even triple them, but the double amount was perfect for me. I did NOT cook it an hour, more around 40 minutes or so. It's tender and not dry at all, so I'm not sure where some bakers that reviewed it went wrong. May have cooked it the entire hour?
Also note, I used the super heavy molasses that has almost no sweetness to it; but I like the way it tastes so it is fine for me (and warmed it slightly in the microwave to get it into the batter easier)..
I topped it with a cream cheese icing, but it's actually better with nothing or maybe the whipped cream suggested on the site, simply because the cake is not real dense, more fluffyish, BUT I used actual hot water, not tepid or warm. It probably caused the soda to kick in quickly and the cake rose significantly.
I'll be making this from now and throughout December and am thinking about soaking some raisins in bourbon (or maybe Disaronno) and spices and adding them... just to see what's up. I'll add the leftover alcohol to the water. Maybe a little orange zest too.
Anyway, don't hesitate, it's totally worth it and easy to throw together.

This is my new "go to" gingerbread recipe! I took FRANCINE76's recommendation and added 1/2 cup applesauce, using my home bottled sauce from last year's apple crop (we have 5 apple trees). I also added an extra egg, increased the water by 2 tablespoons and upped the spices by 50%. I believe the extra egg and water contributed to its cake-like texture and moisture level. More spices amped up that wonderful Autumnal flavor we all love. My husband, our dinner guest and I were all very pleased.

I usually don't review something if I don't follow the recipe exactly as written. But, so many reviewers suggested doubling the spices and adding 1/2 cup of applesauce so I did. It was wonderful! I brought it to a birthday party and there wasn't a piece left. Out of the 27 adults there I had 11 people ask for the recipe. Will make again and again.

Very disappointed. What a waste.

I agree with another reviewer that the recipe needs too much tweaking to have such a high rating.  

Yes, if I doubled the spices and used a different molasses, the recipe would have been wonderful, but I shouldn't have to do so.

Great recipe. I've made it as written and I have also added to the recipe. It is better if you double the cinnamon and ginger. I have also made it using 1/2c molasses and 1/2c sorghum. The sorghum gives it a rich sweet "what is that" taste. Also try adding 1/4c of raisins to the batter.

I wasn't impressed with the cake. Was too dry even with the addition of apple sauce.

Disappointed, very dry. Needs applesauce or more liquid. Good flavor just dry.

4 stars as it is; 5 stars if you serve it with lemon curd.  Or lemon curd and whipped cream together.  First time making gingerbread and it was a bit hit at a group pot luck.

Amazing.  I made it with Francine76's suggestions (double the spices, add 1/2 c. applesauce), with Pamela's Gluten Free Baking mix, and it turned out absolutely perfect - and made the house smell like Christmas in the bargain.
Warmed, with vanilla ice cream - decadence itself!

Made this exactly as recipe stated. I found the molasses to be a bit strong, but others liked it very much. Next time I will double the spices. I had no trouble with it being moist however, mine was done in 45 minutes instead of an hour. So I would suggest to check it after 40 minutes. Maybe that is why some bakers were having trouble with it being dry.

I followed the recipe exactly and we loved it! Moist with a crunchy top. Just the right balance of molasses and ginger. Used Grandmas brand unsulfured molasses.  Topped it with homemade whip cream and sliced bananas.  We baked some in cupcake liners as an experiment and liked how that turned out (about 25 minutes at 350*).  This has become the favored birthday treat for one of our December birthdays. Met with the approval of the 5yo birthday boy and the rest of the family and guests too.

I have been making a recipe extremely close to this for years & it is ALWAYS a hit, even to people who say they don't like gingerbread. I always use "Grandma's" brand of molasses, but recently tried Aldi's & couldn't tell a difference. You can also make this in muffin tins & freeze the muffins to enjoy at a later date.

I have no idea if this is good, sounds like it is.  This is in response to Chez about freezing for later use.  I freeze cakes all the time.  Bake it, let it cool, and I remove it from the original pan, wrap securely, then freeze and let defrost when needed.  You probably could freeze it in the pan, I've just never tried it. Definitely bake it before you freeze!

I made this in a 2-piece tube pan and baked for 45 minutes. It was perfect! I did use extra cinnamon and ginger as others suggested and it was by far the best gingerbread I've ever made or eaten. I will be making this several times during the holidays this year! This is definitely my new go-to gingerbread recipe.

This is absolutely delicious!  I read the reviews before trying it and I used some of the suggestions. Thank you all. I doubled all the spices and instead of all molasses, I used half robust molasses and half light brown sugar. I also added one half cup homemade, unsweetened applesauce. This reminds me of when I was a little girl and my mom used to make this. So, so good! Thank you!

I love gingerbread. Double the spices and this is the best. I make small loaves to give as Christmas gifts and get lots of compliments. A couple of slices with butter and a cup of coffee is heaven. Also freezes really well.

2016/01/03 Update: Didn't have time for so much baking this year so I increased the recipe by 50% and made it in a bundt pan. Baked at 300F for 1 hour 20 minutes. It was perfect!

Cooking time is way off. Luckily someone said to check it at 40 minutes... I suggest checking it at 30-35 because my oven always takes longer than most ovens and it was perfect at 40 minutes, so your oven will probably cook it faster. I STILL rate this as 5 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for. I followed the recipe exactly except cooking time. Most people will probably want more spice but this was perfect for me.
Handy note to those who realize they only have frozen butter: Cut the butter into small pieces and it is ready in 15-20 minutes.

Oh wow!  It tastes just like gingerbread cookies...in cake form.  Yum!  I did double the cinnamon and ginger though, and baked it in an 8x8 pan. Baked for 1hr exact.  I served it warm (and cooled) with warmed homemade caramel sauce and whipped cream.  It would be tasty served with vanilla ice cream as well, or perhaps a smidge of cream? My boyfriend loved it as well.

I made this for dessert on Christmas day.  Made 1.5 times the recipe to fill a 9x13 pan, but I increased the spices to 2x (instead of 1.5) based on other reviews.  It was delicious.  I served it with a caramel sauce drizzled over it, and a tiny bit of whipped cream to top it off.  Would have given it five stars if I didn't have to increase spices from original recipe.

This was very delicious. I doubled the spices, used half applesauce and half oil (in place of butter). Becomes incredibly moist especially if frozen and then defrosted!

I added allspice and anise plus golden raisins and chopped candied ginger to the recipe.   Also at high altitude, 45 minutes was more than enough time in the oven.   Very good recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I think this gingerbread is far too strong with the molasses flavour. The molasses needs to be knocked back to allow the flavours of the spices to fully develop, as it is overpowering. I suggest replacing half the molasses with corn syrup, or simply using a different recipe. A good gingerbread is balanced in flavour, with each of the triad of spices and the molasses playing well together, and allowing for the spices to develop into a nice gingerbread flavour. This recipe does not.

I followed the last two reviews' recommendations on doubling the spices, it worked as told. I plan on baking this cake at least once more this season and annually thereafter. Thank you to the owner of this recipe. Yay! ??

This smells really good when baking, but I think the time is off, if you cook it for an hour you will have an extremely dry cake. I checked at 50 minutes and it was already over done.  May try again, but will have to check a lot earlier on the time. I was surprised that everyone says it is moist, because it is not if baked as the recipe says.  Gingerbread should be moist.  This is not.

I read the reviews first and double the spice quantities. My bake time was 43 minutes....at 350*. So glad I did not cook the whole hour.
The results were wonderful.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  Thank you so much for posting it.  Personally, I add raisins to my gingerbread.  They add a lot to the recipe...and I just like raisins. :D

Flavor was great, but it was a bit too dry. I followed other people's suggestion and doubled the spices which was a great choice. Next time I will add more water, butter, and cook less to make it moist.

Very nice! I added extra cinnamon and used a little less butter and it came out really good. I'll definitely make one more before Christmas.

We loved this recipe - pure indulgence! Soft and full of molasses and yummy Chrismas spices. I added some more ginger (maybe 2-3 times the amount - but this was based on my taste preference), a dash more cloves, a good dash of nutmeg and a little less sugar - I figured the molasses would make up and it would still be sweet. I baked it in a 9inch springform pan and put some foil paper over it about 30mins into baking time to prevent any burning. It was easy to slide off the springform base and place onto a cake server. I also dusted a light amount of confectioners sugar. I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream - we live in the South... :-) This is a favorite recipe now and will be made again and again...

I tried this recipe and loved it! BUT I did listen to those who did it before me and so I added 1/3 cup sour cream (to make it more moist), used 1/2 cup less four, and added more ginger and spices -cause I like to have a stronger flavor. Ended up giving the (adapted)recipe to people at work because they all wanted it.

I used Crisco instead of butter and I omitted the cloves (we don't care for them), added 11/2 tsps of the ginger and cinnamon as we like it spicier.  I only baked it for 30 mins in a 9x13 pan and it was perfect moist and spicy.  Loved it!

Delicious. I made this as a dessert for Thanksgiving, and added homemade whipped cream on top. I added a little more cinnamon & ginger, but this is a great recipe to begin with. Thanks!

This was VERY GOOD! My 8 y/o especially liked it. I made it exactly according to recipe. Only alteration was baking time. I set timer for 45 min, but it was a bit overbaked. I would recommend starting to check for doneness at 30-35 min.

Loved this!  I did double the spices, and used half cup of unsulphured molasses and half cup applesauce.  It was fantastic with whipped cream.

This is an excellent gingerbread recipe!  Even my non-ginger loving husband liked it.  I did double the spices (except for the salt) and I used unsulphured molasses.  The second time I made it into cupcakes - and added raisins (kind of like a hermit cupcake).  I serve with lemon sauce (see the Lemon Sauce I recipe - YUM!)

The texture of this is wonderful - moist, substantial, with a bit of a gooey layer on top as the pic shows.  But as others have said, it is not sweet enough and doesn't really have a gingerbread flavor.  I'm giving it 5 stars though, since I think with more sugar (I'm thinking of subsstituting honey for some of the molasses) and way more spice, I think it will be dee-lish.  I'm making it for Valentine's day  - my sweetie doesn't like really sweet desserts and I think this will be perfect.  I just won't tell him how much butter there is in it :-)

Excellent! Definitely double all the spices, and a delicious topping would be a cream cheese frosting. A nice small recipe for frosting is: 2 oz butter, softened; 2 oz cream cheese, softened; 1 cup powdered sugar; 1/2 tsp vanilla. Beat together the butter and cream cheese with electric mixer and on a lower speed, add in powdered sugar & vanilla. Delicious!

YUM!!!  This gingerbread is excellent served slightly warm with some whipped cream.  

This is the exact same recipe my grandmother (my dad's mom) used to make.  She had titled it "Anna's Gingerbread".  Her handwritten recipe is old, and I know that it dates back *at least* to the 1950's (probably even earlier).  I have no idea where Grandma's friend Anna got the recipe, but it sure makes WONDERFUL gingerbread.  

A big thank you to Charles for posting this recipe!  That makes it easy to share, and I know right where to find it in case anything ever happens to Grandma's handwritten one.

Wish I had read more reviews and this could have been awesome rather than good.  I found it had a bit too strong molasses flavour, so I would reduce that a little. I used an 8 inch pan and mine fell in the middle...  ??  After 60 minutes, it was overdone and almost burnt on the corners - should have checked it earlier!  My guests did enjoy it, though, and asked for seconds.  Add whip cream and caramel sauce!

I was so disappointed after reading all the good reviews of this recipe.  I followed the recipe meticulously with the exception that I doubled the spices as recommended by other reviewers. The cake was terribly dry and, despite careful attention to the greasing/flouring of the pan, it stuck.  In addition to being so dry my kids would only eat it with ice cream, the product does not taste anything like gingerbread. It is more like a spice cake...a dry, dry spice cake.  Next time I'll go with the old Betty Crocker recipe!

I doubled the spices as suggested and the flavor was very good. It was quite dry however and I prefer a moister gingerbread so this recipe isn't quite what I was seeking.

Great tasting! The spices are just right and even though we ended up over-baking it (which was entirely our fault), it still turned out really moist inside. It is not overly sweet and the balance of spices is just awesome! Definitely a keeper!

I haven't tasted it baked yet, but the batter tastes great.  I doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup veg oil.  Also ran out of molasses so used about 1/2 of maple syrup.

It was so delicious. I followed the suggestions to increase the cinnamon and ginger to 1 1/2 tsp but that is the only change I made. 

I topped it with lemon cream cheese frosting, made with 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, zest of 1 lemon, 1 tsp lemon juice and 2/3 cup icing sugar. It was a great combination. Compliments from all my friends! :)

This was really moist cake, but it isn't the traditional flavor of gingerbread to me. I should have excluded the ground cloves from this since they are a very strong spice. This is what ruined it for me. I will try this easy recipe again, but without the cloves.

i used organic sugar for the white sugar, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, a half a cup of applesauce, 1/2 a pack of ginger tea instead of ground ginger, and 2 teaspoons ground allspice instead of ground cloves. this cake is moist and delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. it is easy to put together and lovely to make. definitely a favorite.

I just took my first bite of this "cake", with a few adjustments and it is FANTABULOUS!!! I added 1/2 cup of applesauce, 2 tbs of veggie oil, 3 tbs of xtra water, a lil more then doubled the spices, 1 and 1/4 cups of molasses. It is so moist, tasty, just the right amount of spice and will certainly become a favorite here. Think I am going to make a cream cheese, whipped cream with grated apples and some lemon juice for the icing. OH and I used brown sugar all the way.

This gingerbread cake was AMAZING! I made it for a get together and everyone loved it, especially my 12 year old son who wanted take some for his friends at school! My guests are already asking for the recipe! The only changes I made were some of the ones suggested by other reviewers - I doubled the spices, added 1/2 cup of applesauce, baked it in a 9x13 in pan (which only required 30min baking time), frosted it with butter cream icing (Duncan Hines, but don't tell anyone! LOL) and grated grystallized ginger over top. YUMMM!!!!

This was incredible! The only thing I did was double the spices and cut baking time to 50 minutes. The top had a little crust and the cake inside was moist and delicious. I will definately make this again!!

We added red hots (cinnamon imperials) before baking.  They added a wonderful flavor!  However, they sunk to the bottom and melted.  Next time I'll wait until halfway through baking time and then adding them.

I made this and followed the advice to double the spices and add applesauce. Not good! I found it way too spicy but the applesauce was a good idea. It was very moist but if I ever make it again I will follow the original recipe but still add the applesauce.

This was indeed a moist cake!  The flavor however was a bit off.  There is a bit of a bitter aftertaste perhaps from the table molasses I used.  Could use more sweetness too.  I may try this recipe again using all natural molasses (no sulfur) and add more sugar to sweeten it.

I too doubled the cinnamon and ground ginger but I should h ave checked the cake after 45 minutes or so because 55 minutes was too long in my oven (not the recipe's fault).  Everyone liked it with whipped cream and a dusting of fresh grated nutmeg on top.  Definitely serve warm as it smells fantastic.

Doubled the ginger and cinnamon. Used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 all-purpose.  Used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce. Still nice and moist. Used a 9 inch metal springform and cooked for only 45 minutes and it almost burned. Infact, I had to cut the bottom off when I served it. It got too dark. This has a very rich classic gingerbread flavor and I only used a mild molasses. Easy to do and much better than the boxed mixes.  Served with warmed carmel sauce and whipping cream.

I've made it as is, and with a few changes. The changes make it 5 stars. Double the spices. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup full flavored molasses. 3/4 cup hot water, 1/2 cup milk and an extra egg to make it moister, some people complained of it being dry. Served with vanilla ice cream.

I doubled the cinnamon and ginger and used unsulphered molassas as other viewers suggested but all I could taste in this was molasses.  If you really, really like molassas you will probably like this cake.  I don't hate molasses but I don't want something to taste like I'm drinking pure molasses out of the bottle either.  It did look nice and was a good consistancy but me nor anyone else at Christmas liked how it tasted.  I made it in two loaf pans for 35 minutes and it was baked nicely.

The one hour cook time was too long...I'd recommend checking the bread at 45 minutes, as suggested previously.   I used a very bold, full flavor molassess, which was a bit much for the bread.

This is a great recipe! The only alteration I made was to use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup apple sauce. To make is spicier, next time I'll double the spices, but it was great as it was! I also had to adjust the temperature to 300F and cook for 55 minutes for my convection oven (I checked it at 55 minutes and it was ready though I had intended on cooking it for 1 hour). Will most definitely make it again!

1st gingerbread cake I ever baked. I followed the recipe, except doubling the cinnamon and ginger amounts as suggested in earlier reviews.  This was good advice as the taste would've been too bland.  A day later, the cake still retains it's moistness and texture. I gave some away to relatives for Xmas.  As reported by others, the cooking time was around 45 minutes, not 60 minutes.  I think this gingerbread could use a frosting, but I didn't make one, trying to be healthy. A simple dusting of powdered sugar might've done the trick. This was a good starter recipe for gingerbread as it's simple and easy to make.

Delicious flavors, I agree with the recommendation to double the spices. I substituted apple sauce for the butter, which I would not recommend (the cake was good but very spongey, bordering on dry). I would definitely make this again!

This is delicious, and so fast to whip up...I also  double this recipe, make one in a 9x9 pan and two smaller loaves....I slice the loaves when cool, like bread, then I use it for an extra special french toast...when dredging in the egg mixture, just lightly run it through and not soak it...absolutely delicious served with a little whipped cream dusted with cinnamon.

Wonderful texture and flavor! I accidentally left out half the butter called for and it was still moist-will probably be even better with the full amount next time. I doubled the spices and substituted nutmeg for the cloves as a personal preference. This may be just a bit too molassesy for my taste so next time I may use 3/4 c molasses and 1/4 c applesauce. I baked it in four mini loaf pans for 30 minutes for perfect moist doneness.

My husband usually doesn't complain about my cooking. He loves gingerbread, but he had almost convinced me to give up on trying to make it from scratch since it was always dry, and I just couldn't get it to taste like the boxed mixes, not matter how much I improvised. Then I tried this recipe, and he was satisfied. It was moist, chewy, spicey, everything gingerbread should be. I am so glad I found this recipe!!!  Moral: Old-fashioned recipes are always better!

Not sure if I did something wrong here but it was WAY too sweet and sickly tasting. If I was to make again I would definitely cut the molasses down by half. It was also very dry. Maybe it's just not the recipe for me, as I can see so many other people liked it!

This was a wonderful gingerbread!!  I did not add any more spices than the recipe called for.  I liked it as is.  On the second go around I substitued 1/4 cup of the water for 1/4 cup applesauce, and it came out a little moister.  I made it as a bundt cake, using the same baking time and it turned out perfect both times.  I topped it with a pear/cranberry sauce and whipped cream and it was the hit of my ladies' night gathering.

Not bad! I doubled the spices. Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. Increased recipe from 12 servings to 16 servings to better fit my 13x9 inch pan, which was ready in 30 mins baking time at 350 degrees. However, I will continue searching for a recipe for  a deeper, denser, chewier Gingerbread, like Dancing Deer's Dark Gingerbread sold in Wholefoods (the best gingerbread that I have ever eaten). This recipe doesn't make a gingerbread like Dancing Deer's.

I should have read some of the reviews first before making this.  Although it wasn't too strong, the molasses was a little bit overpowering.  Maybe if I make this again, I would cut it down to maybe 1/2 - 3/4 cup molasses.  I cut the cloves down to just under 1/4 tsp, because I don't like a strong clove taste. I  baked this in an 8x11 pan.  It still came out pretty thick, I think the 9x9 it would nearly overflow?  In the 8x11 pan it took about 35 mins to bake.

I doubled the spices, the kiddos loved it I just thought it was a bit dry. I did use whole wheat flour, could have been the cause. Next time I'll add a 1/2 cup apple sauce to see if that will help. And I only cooked mine for 45 minutes it started burning the edges, next time I'll try cooking it more like 35-40 minutes. Oh and like another reviewer said the molasses flavor was really strong, I'll try the 1/2 cup as well next time.

Excellent! I followed others' suggestions and doubled the spices and added a half cup applesauce. I covered it with foil after about 30 min and baked it for about 50 min. Served with homemade whipped cream.

I found the cake flavour to be overpowering. I think the recipe calls for too much molasses - it overpowers the cake. I would likely cut the molasses in half, if I were to make this cake again.

We enjoyed this on Christmas Eve- it's tradition to have it with warm applesauce and whipped cream!  I doubled the cinnamon and ginger.  It turned out really moist when baked.  If you make this the day ahead, don't put any foil or saran wrap directly on top of the gingerbread- mine stuck!

Great recipe overall. I took some of the suggestions other reviewers suggested-- honey and brown sugar instead of molasses, 1/2 C of applesauce, and doubling cinnamon and ginger-- and they worked very well. I topped our cake with whipped cream, which made it a huge hit.  This cake, obviously, has a heavy spice taste to it, so it's a little bit of an acquired taste, but my family seemed to like it well.

Followed recipe and it is not good - I have never made gingerbread before, so to be fair if you like gingerbread then maybe it is a good recipe for you. But for our family... it tasted like straight molasses, it had an after taste.

I wanted to make a pumpkin gingerbread trifle so I used this recipe for the bread. A review said it was moist so I'm making  it a couple of days before I need it. Added a little extra spice as some suggested

3 stars based on original recipe. I love spicy gingerbread. With a few changes it was perfect. I doubled the spices, added 2 tsp fresh ginger,used brown sugar instead of white,added 1/2 cup applesauce, and heated up orange juice instead of water. I used a bundt pan and baked for 45 minutes. Perfect!!

Very nice! I love this recipe. I did alter it slightly; I doubled the cinnamon and ginger and added 1/2 cup apple sauce. It turned out with great flavor and was very moist. I will serve it with cinnamon whipped cream at Christmas!

This is a really tasty recipe and adaptable to giving as a "Jar Gift" for friends for Christmas. I am giving this to friends with the dry ingredients layered in a mason jar. I will include a jar of molasses, a jar of lemon curd, and holiday pot holders in a 9 inch square pan with directions for baking. Holiday tissue paper and ribbon will make it "gift ready".  I practiced, increasing cinnamon and ginger to 2 tsp. as suggested by others and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg as well. This makes a very hearty gingerbread, not too sweet, that is really yummy with the sweet and tart flavor of lemon curd. Cake was done at 45 minutes so don't wait for 1 hour to check!

Great recipe! Used the applesauce and doubled the spices per other reviewers (still could've used more cinnamon for our tastes) and the cake turned out brilliant. Simple and delicious. I have been informed that I should make this every day until Christmas!

I've make this cake several times, I doubled the spice as others suggest.  The only change I made was to use eggnog instead of hot water (I needed to use some up).  This cake improves over a few days becoming wonderfully moist.  Thanks Charles

I have rated this 4* as I have made a few changes as suggested by other members.  The cake baked to perfection in 45 minutes.  The outside was nice and chewy with the inside being moist.  I doubled all the spices and used fresh fine grated ginger.  Delicious with a big dollop of cream!

I've never liked gingerbread, but I thought that this recipe was outstanding. It tastes similar to the molasses cookies that I remember from when I was a kid, only in cake form. If you like a strong ginger flavor, though, you should probably add more ginger than this recipe calls for. The ginger flavor in this recipe is rather mild. Tastes great warm with whipped cream on top. Tastes even better the next day!  UPDATE** Baked in 9" pan at 350 for 45-50 minutes. Any longer and it would have burned.

I'm in the habit of substituting healthier ingredients and these came out fantastic!  First I used 1C whole wheat pastry flour and 1.5C white; 1/4 dark brown sugar and 1/4 c Splenda; Sunsweet Lighter Bake in place of the butter and I cut the molasses back to just over 1/2c.  Keep an eye on the bake time too.  i used an 8x8 glass pan and they were done (almost too done) at 30 min.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was dry.  I don't think I overbaked it...but it sure didn't live up to the reviews.  I'll try it again to be sure but for now, it only gets 2 stars from me.

This turned out great. I think I was feeling reckless while making it, because I added probably 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt and a bit of almond extract for no good reason at all. But it's delicious! I also took suggestions and added more of all the spices, and also added nutmeg.

Just made this for my husband who recently had heart surgery and is very conscious about what he eats.  He loves gingerbread and ginger snaps and I wanted to make him something he liked but felt OK about eating.  The changes I made were to increase the spices (esp the ginger) as others have mentioned, replaced the sugar with Splenda and the flour with King Arthur's whole wheat flour. He loves it!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a rockstar. Simple easy and full of flavour in my opinion. I had a number of compliments on it. I will make it again for its easiness and great flavour! I used a smaller pan 8x8 still worked out great. I didn't bake it the full time either...just 45 or 50 minutes

I found it bland and disappointing since I wanted to sink my teeth into moist  but dense gingerbread. It lacked the intensity I was looking for.  I did add chocolate at the end as a marble effect one poured into the tin.  Maybe black treacle instead of molasses would be better.

This recipe was perfect for Christmas and was perfect for the train mold from Williams & Sonoma. I served each with powdered sugar and homemade vanilla ice cream... I'm sure that caramel drizzled would be excellent as well.

This was the first time I made gingerbread. I felt that the molasses was too overpowering and it did not taste right. Also, the cake was dry and harden after sitting in refrigerator for a few days. This was not what I had expected and I will not make this again.

I made this in a bundt pan, and it looked pretty AND tasted great! I doubled the spices and added a small box of vanilla pudding mix to the batter. We topped it with whipped cream and cinnamon/sugar. The cake was very moist and delicious!

I've made this 4 times. After a few adjustments, I've found a keeper. I omit the spices in the recipe and add 2 Tbs. Trader Joe's Pumpkin spice with 1 tsp.ginger. Add 1/2 cup hot water, 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce. Then bake for 40 minutes for the 9X9 pan. More moist with a ginger snap flavor. mmmmmm

***Taste great!! Unfortunately I ate most of it myself and I made it last night.  I'm definetly making another one over the weekend.  I doubled the spices making the flavor just right.  Next time I will try adding a little applesauce.*******I tried it with applesauce and it gave it a more cake like consistency.  I prefer it without the applesauce.  This ginger bread is perfect with a cup of coffee.

To die for! My first homemade gingerbread and it was outstanding....very moist, texture was great, spices were perfect....my only lil issue was that I only had 1/2c of molasses left....so I added 1/2c. light corn syrup to it to get the full cup. I made this in a bundt pan, served with some whipped cream, and cinnamon sprinkled on top. Will most definately make again!

The only thing I changed is that I doubled the spices. Baked in a 9" springform pan for about the whole hour required.  Pricked and topped with a butter, brown sugar, and lemon glaze. This is so good! Moist, dense, and flavorful!

My rating isn't totally fair because I altered it. I tripled the spices and it ended up tasting kind of burnt, I'm not sure why. Also, mine only needed to cook for 45 minutes. I will try this again following the recipe. The texture was great.

Here are all my substitutions, which still led to a great-tasting and moist gingerbread: 7.5 tablespoons vegetable oil instead of butter, 3/4 cup of brown sugar + 1 tablespoon water instead of molasses, 3 tablespoons mayonnaise instead of egg, no cloves, and about a tablespoon of fresh ginger, finely minced.  I poured it in a 3 by 7 bread pan, filled it halfway, and baked it for about 40 minutes.  Thought it was delicious!

This is easy and delicious. The first time I made it, it turned out level in the pan. The second time I thought I followed the recipe exactly but it puffed up a lot in the center. Maybe I accidently added too much baking agent. But it was good both times and not too dry.

I thought this was going to be a great recipe from reading the ratings. I was so very wrong. 1 cup of molasses was WAY too much. It overpowered the entire cake. I may try the recipe again with 1/2 a cup instead. I even doubled the spices and it didn't help.

added half a cup of honey and doubled the spices (gave it lots of moisture)...took this to a potluck and someone actually STOLE the half eaten pan before I left and gave me back the clean empty dish a week later, they liked it so much!!

A great recipe! Kids love it and is so easy. I steer clear of pre-packaged boxes of cake mixes (almost all have partially hydrogenated oils!) and have looked for a fool-proof gingerbread recipe, this is the one!

Wow! Fabulous recipe as is. Just like my own German Grandma would have made. SO moist, and perfect blend of spices. I put the powdered sugar on top as photo shows to give it that pretty 'bling'. Thanks! Kathy - owner of Capt. Dan's Pirate Pastry Shop on the Oregon Coast

This is VERY forgiving (and fabulous). I forgot the the cup of hot water! I over-baked it (distracted by guests). I did double the spices-- it was INTENSE and fantastic!!!!!! Like a flour-less cake. We all loved it (with vanilla ice cream). I love my clove/ginger/molasses type flavors so all you whiners go make a lemon cake if you think it's "too molassey." Charles deserves a medal for this yummy gingerbread.

I liked this dessert; it reminded me of the gingerbread at a favorite tavern of mine.  I doubled the spices and added a half-cup of applesauce for a little lightness.  It cam out a little dry, so maybe more applesauce next time.  
I think I will pair this with a hard sauce next time.

Too much molasses-- the flavor was overpowering and I generally love all things gingerbread.  I get a strong molasses aftertaste.  Next time I would put in much less and add more sugar instead.  I followed other reviewers and was more generous with the spices.  That was a good tip.  I also cut out some butter, added a bit of oil and put in 1/2 cup applesauce (trying to trim the fat).  What I got turned out to be a nice dense bread.  Will def keep in my recipe box and tinker with it again.

Thank You, Charles, for reviving a recipe from my youth; my mother used a recipe like this and I'm thankful to have it once again.  I just finished baking it, for the fourth time, and am going to serve it, as she did, with peaches on top, vanilla ice cream around the sides and a big dollop of whipped cream over all!  It's fantastic.

I so wanted this recipe to work. I have actually made it twice now. The last result was better than the first but still not good. The batter is fabulous! My daughter loved licking the bowl. I am not sure if I am doing something wrong but I am following the recipe to a T and getting a very dense gingerbread. The first time the cake went sad...I thought it had to be something that I had done, made it again it didn't look sad but it made me very sad to eat it! My husband is a huge fan of gingerbread and he even threw this out. Smells great, batter tastes great, cake is well below great.

The cake was okay, a little disappointed though.  I have never tried gingerbread so I have nothing to compare but no one at the party ate more than a bite or two.  If I decided to try it again, I think I would make in a bundt cake pan and drizzle with icing before serving.

Excellent!  I didn't have molasses, unfortunately.  So, I used brown sugar and cream of tartar (I checked the "common substitutions" article found here on allrecipes.com) in it's place.  I also didn't have cloves!  I used nutmeg instead.  I think it still came out delicious.  Of course, I will try again when I have all of the ingredients, but honestly, I thought it was wonderful!

I tried to find molasses here in the UK but couldn't.  I used dark treacle and it worked for the most part.  I thought the treacle had a stronger taste than the molasses would have so I think next time, I would reduce the amount of treacle and perhaps add a bit more sugar.  However, the strong taste was offset by eating the cake with vanilla ice cream.

Pretty good - no one touched it on Christmas Day though.  Maybe because there were many other desserts and this one didn't look very special.   I thought it tasted good.  I took the suggestion of others and added about 1/2 cup of apple sauce and doubled the spices.

Wonderful!  My house smells so good.  This bread is best the next day after being wrapped in plasic wrap over night, this really brings the moistness back.  I added 1/3 cup of mayo to the batter with the egg to add a little more moistness since some said it was dry.  Over all a great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I love this gingerbread recipe!  I've made it several times now and it always turns out perfectly- moist and springy, delicately spicy and completely delicious.  This is a holiday favorite that I plan to continue making year after year.

I have made this 3 times already this season, rave reviews each time.  I have made it in a bundt cake pan, and only bak efor about 45 min.  I then top with a cream cheese frosting (when it's cooled) and sprinkle with chopped cran berries.  It's a hit everywhere.

It is a good recipe but gingerbread is not very sweet so it would be better if it had a purpose other than just plain gingerbread.

Really dissapointed in this recipe.  I've been searching for sooo long for a great gingerbread recipe and will have to keep looking. Tried the recipe "as is"...bland and dry.  Doubled the spices and added a cup of applesauce per the suggestions and it was just alright. I doubt we'll finish eating it and I know we won't make it again.  Sorry

Heavenly. A pleasure to make, to watch cook and to eat. I've never tasted gingerbread where the flavours were light but still rich. I'm slowly building a holiday recipe list and I KNOW that this is one that will have everyone praising my baking skills. :)

You can't beat a good gingerbread recipe.  To kick it up another notch I made some homeade applesauce and served it warm over the gingerbread and topped with fresh whipped cream.

As suggested by other users, I doubled the spices and this recipe really needs that. I made this in a loaf pan and it was in the oven for more than an hour.

I planned on adding the sour cream, but when I prepared the batter, it was quite thin so I didn't think that it needed it. Afterwards, I wish that I had added it because it is quite dry and probably won't keep very well.

I served it with homemade vanilla whipped cream and it was a very delicious fall dessert!

Wow! This was so good. I used 1/2 cup molasses and doubled the cinnamon and ginger. I also used 1/4 cup extra sugar, and 1/2 cup sour cream like others have suggested. AMAZING! This is my new holiday bread recipe. Thanks Charles!!!

This was awesome!  The only change I made was to double the spices like everyone suggested.  I am sure that I will make this many, many more times in the future.  I baked it in two loaf pans.  Yummy!

I cut back on the molasses as some people suggested and it still tasted like too much.  It was pretty bitter even with the vanilla glaze that someone else suggested on it.  I'd make this again and sweeten it a little more.

Wonderful flavor & made the house smell great, too! Followed recipe, except I used 2/3 c. water & 1/3 c. sour cream. Cake very moist & flavorful. I used this recipe to make small loaves of Christmas bread for friend & drizzled with vanilla glaze (2 Tbsp. margarine-melted, 1 c. powdered sugar, 3/4 tsp. vanilla & 1-2 Tbsp hot water. Stir until smooth.)and it turned out great. My mom even asked ME for this recipe!

Excellent recipe--easy to make, very rich and moist.  I used two teaspoons of ginger and baked in a springform pan.  I made it to share with a few friends and they thought it was perfect, especially with cinnamon ice cream from a local dairy.  Thanks!

I gave this only three stars because even though I like it, my husband won't eat it. He generally doesn't like things with these kind of spices, so that's not a big surprise. I made an orange glaze to put on this, since it's not very moist. Normally I would make lemon glaze for gingerbread, but I didn't have any lemons.

If you are a true gingerbread person, DO NOT cut back on the molasses. This is great cake just the way it is. My whole family loved it with a dollop of whipped cream.

Got great compliments.  However I did make some changes I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white. I also cut the ground ginger down to 1 heaping tsp. and added 2 1/2 tsp fresh ginger root finely chopped. turned out fantastic.  Even better with warm lemon suace!!

Perfect! I did cut the sugar to 1/4 though. Don't like things too sweet. I didn't have any butter on hand so used shortening. Turned out fine.

This recipe was easy and quick. I divided the batter between two 9" round cake pans and it came out perfectly; puffy and moist. However, the molasses taste was too strong for my liking; I would try a light flavored molasses next time and/or use less molasses. It also wasn't very sweet; tasted better with some icing.  I like a really spicy cake so I doubled all of the spices--still wasn't enough for me!

I pinned this recipe because the gingerbread is moist and flavorful and the recipe is easy and quick. I wish that the bread was a bit denser though. But I do recommend it. Yum-my.

First I want to say that the gingerbread is Very good as far as the taste is concerned & it was fun to make. 
The Cooking Time is an Error! Please don’t cook this gingerbread for more than 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees. The recipe called for Cooking time of 1 hour....Please No!!! 
While it was cooking I read some of the reviews and I read the one about overcooked and dry. Well I raced to the kitchen and saved it just in time at 35 minutes ( it was still a little more  “Done” than I like,  but still Very Good with fresh whipped cream....Please Reduce the Cooking Time to 25-30 Minutes...

I like the flavor, but it seems a bit dry. I followed the recipe exactly, even checked my oven temp, which is actually a bit lower, so I don't think that's it. My pan has a dark finish, so maybe that's it? I've seen gingerbread recipes that use applesauce for moistness, but I think that changes the concept too much. Would appreciate any ideas of how to get a more moist gingerbread.

Easy to make. Smells fantastic and is very tasty. I sifted powdered sugar on top before serving.

I liked it, husband thought it was dry. Made lemon curd to serve on top, super. I was afraid to add too much spice so maybe did 1 1/2 times. Go for 2 times! I used fresh and powdered ginger. Baking time is a little to long. Ran out of lemon curd and still have cake so will frost with cream cheese frosting. I love ginger.

Wowza! Delicious! Dense, rich, and just what I was looking for. Doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup applesauce to the mix as others suggested. This will be a new Christmas tradition.

I wish I had added applesauce because mine was a little dry but had good flavor. It didnt take an hour 25 minutes to be exact.

Very good. I upped the ginger and cinnamon to 2 tsp. I also added about 1/4 tsp of allspice.  I baked for 37 minutes. Cake was done just right but the bottom was a bit scorched. May be because I used a very dark pan.

This is a very dark gingerbread because of the molasses.  We did not like it at all.  I may try it again and substitute something for the molasses.

Thank you for the reviewer that gave me the education on molasses. I don’t bake except for Christmas time. I used the unsulphured, doubled the spices and added a pinch of cayenne. A must when you use cinnamon, in anything! I also baked them in a cupcake pan for pretty individual cakes. Iced them with a drizzle of eggnog and powdered sugar icing. They were dense and rich and perfect,

I always read reviews and suggestions so I felt comfortable doubling the spices and adding 1/4 c. applesauce. Rave reviews! Made it for work. Baked in a bundt pan, liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar and filled the center with sugared cranberries. Not even one cranberry was left!

The texture of the bread was good, but it needed a little less molasses, more spices and a bit more sweetness. Also, I think the recipe should clarify which molasses to use. In this case I think robust molasses is far too bitter - you need a lighter molasses like Grandma’s.

I have made this 3-4 times a year for several years now.  Like other reviewers I double the spices except for the cloves. I generally find it  is done cooking earlier than the 1 hour - do a test at 45 minutes to avoid over-cooking.  I find making  it the day before  results in a cake that tastes better and is moister. 
It is to die for with cream cheese icing and some warm caramel sauce.  People who love gingerbread LOVE this recipe.

I definitely followed the suggestions to double the spices, I like a very gingery gingerbread! I tasted great! I forgot to add the applesauce that was also suggested, but I think it was fine without it. I will do that next time and see what the difference is. The cake also cooked faster than the recommended time, but as per the comments I checked it early. I will definitely make this again.

FINALLY! A German-style gingerbread recipe that has the pungent spice flavor i’ve been trying to replicate!——————-——————————————————————-
A note interestingly reading a comment below about the use of blackstrap molasses. We used unsulphered* blackstrap molasses, and found it to be perfect. In fact the German style ginger bread I like  has a slight licorice note to it which I always assumed was anise or star Anise, which is common in German Christmas baking. The use of blackstrap molasses would accomplish the same, and ironically this is probably was been missing from my other attempted gingerbread recipes.——————————————————————————————

* We used the Plantation brand unsulphered blackstrap molasses, purchased at The Fresh Market.————————————-————————————————-

Modifications    ——————————————————————
- Tripled the spices, as spice loses his pungency when exposed to heat. But if you want the sharpness of the uncooked batter in the output, you probably need to use five or six times the spices. We’re going to play around with this in future batches.————————————————————-

- Added a generous tablespoon of McKays ginger preserve, a Scottish ginger marmalade, to boost the ginger flavor and sharpness. I think I would even add twice this much in the next batch, as we really liked the flavor. I would probably reduce the amount of sugar a bit in that case.———————————————————

- we used organic Valley cultured unsalted butter, which has a slightly tangy flavor compared to non-cultured but

Be careful what kind of molasses you use!  I didn't even know that there were different kinds until I started reading the reviews.  The bottle just said molasses, but I'm guessing it must have been blackstrap.  My cake came out almost black in color and was so bitter.  The texture was wonderful but sadly, it ended up in the trash.  It also cooked in 50 minutes, not 60.

This recipe came out quite well. I ended up using whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, so I upped the baking soda by another half teaspoon. I also upped the spices by about 25%.

It is quite fluffy and it tastes good. I would say it's actually quite a mild taste, if you want something more exciting you could easily double the amount of spices and I think it'd still taste great. 

I was very happy because as I was mixing it, the smell of the molasses was almost overpowering and unpleasant and made me worry that the taste was going to be awful, but it seems like the smell cooked off and left the bread smelling nice. I would suggest going with less molasses rather than more. 

Rated 4 rather than 5 stars because if made with the listed quantity of spice I think it would not taste like anything.

I used to use the box mix for gingerbread, but couldn't find it any more.  Good thing because this recipe is scrumptious.  I doubled the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves as many suggested and it was fantastic.  I had everything on hand, which is a huge plus.  It seemed there was too much batter for my 8 inch pan, so I put half in two loaf pans and baked for 30 min. and it was great.  Now I am finished with searching for gingerbread recipes as this one can't be beat.

This is truly a traditional gingerbread cake. It is not the moist type of cake so be prepared for that traditional density of a European gingerbread cake. I doubled the spices as some reviewers suggested as I know our family likes heavy spice flavouring so I think that is an individual preference. It was delicious! I served it with a cinnamon whipped cream. So yummy. Thank you for an awesome truly traditional recipe.

It was good, but it got burnt on the edges and I only put in for 45 minutes. I would recommend putting it in for less time. Overall it tasted great.

OMG! This was delicious! I made some changes as recommended by others: doubled spices (except S&P) and added 1/2C apple sauce. Easy and a big hit with my guests. Baked it in a spring form pan for a nice presentation. Served with whipped cream and raspberries. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was wonderful but I have to admit when I tried it the first day I thought I had over spiced it.  I had doubled the spices and ued a half cup of applesauce, lemon  juice and used the springform pan.

Very good.  Oddly, I found it was better as a stand alone.  With whipped cream or ice cream, I found the molasses flavor overpowered the other flavor, rather than compliment it as I expected.

Brought back childhood memories.  Omitted cinnamon because husband is allergic and used a small amount of cloves instead.

It was a good cake, very moist. However, it had a very strong molasses flavour. If I made it again I would add much more of the spices. Not sure if I still would just prefer a recipe with less molasses flavour that tastes a little more of the spices in it?

Bake time for me was WAY off.  I checked it at 45 mins and it was slightly over baked. I did use a dark pan, which makes a difference.

It's amazing! So moist and perfectly balanced. I did double the spices because I love a heavier spiced gingerbread. I used sulfered molasses and it was a good call. I will absolutely be making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas and just.... Any other number of things probably haha. It's only been out of the oven an hour and my family has already devoured all but three pieces.

I will definitely make again. Grew up on box mixed gingerbread so this is amazing. I also went heavier on the spices. I really just added to taste. I also added about 1/4 cup sugar.

I made this for the first time, no way do you bake it for 60 minutes, it was extremely over cooked, watch it after 40 minutes!  I would double the spices though like some reviewers.

Yes and yes! I have made it twice. It was yummy both times. However, the second time I combined about a half teaspoon of each of the spices with about a tablespoon of additional sugar and sifted  the additional ingredients over the batter once it was in the pan and lightly spreadrd it over the top. It created a delicious crispy top, similar to brownies. By the way, I substiutrd the clover with allspice both times because I didn't have any cloves. Yummy

I made it and it was delicious, but I have an idea to kick it up a notch. Simmer 2 cups of water and 3/4 cup of thinly sliced fresh ginger for 5-10 minutes. Strain  into a measuring cup to the 1cup mark and add that instead of ground ginger. Put another 1-1/2 cups of water in the saucepan and simmer another 5 minutes. This makes a delicious ginger tea. No need to peel the ginger. Just wash it off and slice it, skin and all.

Didn't have white sugar so used brown. Also didn't have a 9inch square cake tin, but it filled two regular loaf tins and baked for 40 mins. 
Agree with other reviews that doubling spices is a must. Very light cakey texture when just out the oven. Definitely better on day 2+. 
Looking forward to trying it again.

This recipe never grows old, I have used that for years! Its best gingerbread recipe, and very simple with great outcome. True the spice can be adapted  to taste and low calorie version by using applesauce  as substitute for the butter. It's the same recipe my mother use's as well as my grandmother.

This gingerbread is delicious! I did make it a bit more heart and waist size healthy. I substituted half the butter for unsweetened applesauce, all the sugar for Splenda, replaced 2 cups of flour with almond flour and doubled all the spices except for the salt. The resulting gingerbread is moist and tasty!

I didn't make any changes but if I make it again I will cook it for less than the allotted hour. Cooking it that long made it a little dryer than I would have like but I really think it was just over cooked and would have been great otherwise

One of my very favorite recipes! I make a vegan version with Earth Balance vegan butter replacer and Ener-G egg replacer and love it.  One of my go-to recipes for potlucks, parties and for having with coffee.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing! Everyone that ate some, including myself ABSOLUTELY loved this recipe. It reminds me of my Grammy's molasses cookies. Has a nice spicey taste and the molasses make it perfect. Will make this many times over.

Great cake, it came out super moist. I doubled the spices and baked it in my Ninja Foodie pressure cooker for 30 minutes. I used a small bunt cake pan to make 2 cakes. I will make it again.

Made this for the first time, to take to the in-laws. Turned out great! I did use Aluminium Foil when baking, to keep the moisture in. It was a nice balance of flavour! I will definitely be making this again!

Prepared it exactly how the recipe is written. Everybody who got some loved it!! I made it at xams time instead of cookies, some relatives have a chewing problem so wanting to lay the gingerbread flavor on them at xmas plus having a very tender baked good, this got the job done!!

On a cold winter night not long ago I was craving a traditional gingerbread loaf similar to what my grandmother used to make and this recipe hit the spot. I did as other reviewers suggested and tripled the spices but holy moly was it delicious. Whenever I was ready for a slice, I would warm it up for about ten seconds in the microwave and add a dollop of whipped cream and a little sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg on top. The gingerbread also pairs wonderfully with a mug of coffee or hot cocoa. I am so happy I found this recipe and know that I will be making it again many more times in the future.

Very moist and flavorful.  Yum!! My kids bought me a bundt pan for Christmas so I baked it in that. It baked up perfectly in 40 minutes on 350. Drizzled a powdered sugar + butter icing over the top for flare and fun. Will go great tomorrow morning with coffee. ;)

Tasted good, but was very dry.  I even added in 1/2 cup of applesauce as others had suggested, but was still so dry we ended up not eating it.  And 1 hr of cooking time would have burned it.  Checked around 45 min and it was done.

I served this with warm rum sauce. Big yummy. I altered the recipe for high altitude - more flour and water, less leavening and butter, and I beefed up the spices. Darn good.

Ive made this several years now and I have got it just right.  Add 1 cup off raisins and 1/2 cup chopped crystallized ginger. Also add 1/3 cup more water as the raisins and ginger will absorb some.  Also double the cinnamon and add a pinch of clove.

Delicious !  As  suggested by other reviews I cut the butter by half and supplemented with a half cup of apple sauce.  Additionally, I increased the cinnamon and cloves by a half of teaspoon.

We used almost double the spices as recommended by other reviewers, and I rather wish we had stuck to the original recipe.  That being said, it was still really great, and delicious with coffee.  We sprinkled powdered sugar over the cake for added sweetness and decoration.

Really liked this cake. I also doubled the spices. I didn't have apple sauce like some suggested so I added a cup of finely chopped raisins for body and moisture. It worked.

I followed the recipe exactly except kept watch for doneness after 40 minutes.  50 minutes in my 9X7 glass pan was perfect.
I served it next day with a hot clear lemon sauce - just like my Nova Scotia relatives.  Delicious!

It was dense, and too much molasses flavor overpowered the ginger even though I doubled the ginger. So I am still on the lookout for a good gingerbread recipe. Something a little more lighter in texture than this one.

This gingerbread was very good, except next time I would definitely put more of the spices in and use a little less molasses, as it was slightly overpowering.

Made it with no changes. Baked it in smaller pans which cut down on the oven time. Was just like my Mum use to make. Whole family loved it.

I took the suggestion of adding the 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also made it gluten free, using 25 cups of a gluten free flour blend  (1.5 C sorghum flour, 1 cup Coconut flour, 1.5 cups tapioca flour and 1 t guar gum)

This gingerbread is my traditional Christmas dinner dessert. It bakes up beautifully into a dense cake easily three inches tall in the middle.

A few notes:

1) As others have said, I double the spices. If you prefer a mildly spiced flavour, leave it as is--otherwise, add more.

2) Also, yes it does not need to be baked for an hour. Start checking it at half an hour, and it should be done before 45 minutes are up. Pull it out when it is just slightly gooey in the middle still. It will set up in the pan, and that way you don't burn the bottom or the edges.

3) I doubled the recipe this year and put it in a 9x13 pan. The cake was even taller than usual--four inches in the middle! It was harder to get it to cook evenly, though.  I think I could have followed my tip about pulling it out a little earlier and letting it set up on the stove.

4) I serve it with whipped cream made with cinnamon.  Garnishing with cinnamon is fun too, but putting it in the whipped cream gives it a little more flavour.

Love this recipe! Like other bakers, I doubled the spices. Only had whole cloves, so ground those fresh. Also added 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground anise and a 1/2 tablespoon fresh finely grated ginger. Topped with a cream cheese egg nog frosting. It's a wonderful, festive, warm and spicy cake! Added extra tablespoon of avocado oil, but next time will try adding applesauce for even more moistness.

For high elevation baking be sure to check on this starting around 45 minutes. I baked the full hour and the sides were burnt and had to be trimmed off. The taste and texture otherwise was great.

Forgot the cloves, but still works. Best next day, mellows out the molasses flavour, which is quite strong the same day. Only took 30 mins in bundt pan. Just like my Nanny used to make. Delicious.

Good for decorating, was a sturdy cake... would probably use less molasses next time, and more spices... in my opinion it was too bitter, but my family seemed to love it, it goes well with buttercream :)

I bake all the time, and followed this recipe exactly.  If you leave it in the oven for an hour, you will have a burnt brick.  I luckily checked on mine after a half hour, and it was starting turn black on the sides.  The cake was fine, but I can't imagine baking it for an hour.

I managed to burn this--baked it for 47 minutes in a 9" round--and it was still delicious.  I made a basic rum sauce to go with it.  Definitely will be baking this again.

I made this cake on 12/14/18 for our annual church Christmas dinner. I am the "cake lady" and make the desserts all year round for the church dinners each month. This was my first attempt at a Ginger bread cake. I followed the recipe exactly, making no changes. I baked it in a 9x9 pan. It came out perfectly beautiful. I topped it with homemade whipped cream. Unfortunately, it did not get rave reviews. People who tasted it were polite and said it was ok, but as I looked around the room, I noticed many people left it on their plate, half eaten. Then I tasted a piece, for myself. It was very spicy - so I would cut back on the the spices a bit. It was also very dense. Too heavy for dessert after a full meal. Not a keeper for my recipe portfolio.

I LOVE spiced cake and ginger bread. A little too much clove for me. So I added an icing sugar drizzle and fixed it right up. Came out very moist, tastes great. I didnt have enough molasses so I had to use a 1/3 cup sugar cane syrup.

Love this cake! Even just making it makes me happy. I use Fancy Molasses and I triple the spices it calls for. If I can smell them, it's strong enough. So good!
Topped with icing sugar, and peppermint schnaps soaked maraschino cherries ;-)

The other half doesn't even like gingerbread, yet he LOVED this cake! I doubled the recipe as it was for a party, which made a TON of cake. Way more than necessary. 

I made two changes. 1. I used half butter and half canola oil since I didn't have enough better. It made the cake really moist. 1. I added vanilla. Because vanilla is delicious. It was just the right amount of gingeryness. Yum! I also made a little vanilla drizzle to go on top which added to the yumminess.

This is a very good cake.  Easy to put together and delicious.  Like others suggested I doubled all the spices, except for the cloves which I find can be a bit overwhelming.  I also added nutmeg and vanilla .  I topped it with a cream cheese frosting with a bit of orange zest (another good idea I saw in the reviews).  Baked in a 9x9 in pan this cake only took 45 minutes at 350 f.

Just finished my second batch. I followed other readers suggestions, and have landed on these modifications: one and a half teaspoons cinnamon, 2 tsp ginger; boil half a cup of raisins in one cup of water, a tsp sugar and vanilla, and a splash of brandy for 5 minutes.  When adding hot water, use the raisin water and top up to make 1 and 1/2 cups hot water.  Stir in the raisins and half a cup of chopped walnuts at the end. Also ensured I used Unsulphered molasses; I used 2 loaf pans, it was done in about 45 minutes.

5 stars cause the basic recipe is great, but ditto to everyone else, at least double the ginger and cinnamon and add the .5 cups of applesauce!

I added extra tsp of cinnamon and ginger per reviews and 1/2 cup of applesauce. The flavor was there but the recommended baking time of 60 mins is way too long! I checked it 3 mins before the timer was to go off and it was burnt. I tasted it and the flavor was very good but it's super dry as a result of cooking it too long. I will check on it at 40 mins next time.

I couldn't get enough of it. Though it was not spicy enough for me, I'll increase the amount of spices in the next batch.

This is pretty good.  The cook time is way too long; I took it out after checking it at 45 minutes, and it was already done and even a bit dry on the edges.  The flavor is good, though, and the middle is nice and moist.  I think I'd start checking it around 40 minutes next time.

This is really good. The reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is, the spice level wasn’t quite high enough for me. The flavor was good, but for my taste I would have preferred it to be a little stronger, so I will definitely double the spices next time as others have suggested. It does have a wonderfully moist, soft texture. It is especially good served warm and spread with lemon curd. I doubled the recipe and baked it in 8 mini loaf pans (about 40 mins at 350) to give away as holiday gifts.

Family loved it. I always use less sugar, but in this case only slightly less as I used black strap molasses. Otherwise followed it and it was very nice... Now to make some lemon curd.....

It took 30 minutes to bake. It tastes a lot better 2 days later after baking in an airtight container. On the first day it was bitter with an aftertaste which progressed down to the stomach and gave it an ache. It was a bit dry too. On day 3 it was moist and the bitterness and aftertaste was gone and it tasted really good!

I made it in a bundt pan, and only baked it for 45 minutes, and it was still a little dry. Next time I'm cutting the time down, and also adding a cup of chopped crystalized ginger to make it more moist. I doubled the cinnamon and ginger, and was happy with the flavor.

Two stars because of adaptions needed.  I found this to be dry and with only a 45 minute cook time.  I was very careful to not use too much flour... and feel the recipe should instruct SIFTED flour which yields a different amount than measuring prior to sifting.  In addition, I am happy I read the reviews and tripled my spices.   Only thing I did different than what others suggested (as far as I read)... I used strong coffee instead of water.  If the dryness, cook time and spice level can be adapted... it would be good.  Ginger bread is suppose to be moist and spicy with a GOOD bite of ginger.  This is more like a cake.

I read the review suggestions and doubled the spices. So glad I did. Also ,  I baked it for 40 minutes, which was about 10 minutes too long. I think 30 - 35 minutes is long enough. Great bread.

This came out tasting very good. I doubled the spices and think I may triple them the next time, as I like it well seasoned. It was also rather dense, but for the purpose just right. My 2 yo. grandson and 7yo nephew for whom the cake was intended were both pleased, as was the rest of the family.

I made this twice in two days. Following the recommendations here, I doubled the spice. My first loaf came out great,  it a bit too “clovey” for my taste (but my coworkers loved it). For my next try, I substituted nutmeg for the cloves and liked that better. But that’s a me issue. Next time I’m going to try with brown sugar instead of molasses just to see the difference. 

Question: I’m using a brown square backing pan and my loaf kind of blooms large in the middle. What causes that? Do I need to use a larger pan or something obvious like that?

A true "old fashioned" gingerbread- moist, robust, flavorful. I added an extra tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, as we like our gingerbread spicy, and it's perfect!

I doubled the spices as instructed and added the half a cup of applesauce, but rather than bake it in a conventional oven I decided to put it in a small cake pan and put it in my round crockpot and bake on high til a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Set it and forget it! Makes the house smell wonderful.

This turned out great! I was concerned because I didn’t have room temp butter,so of course went to far warming it up,and it melted. I stuck it outside (19*) and it got pretty solid. Oops! But continued on hoping it was ok, and it was! It was delish-I served with rum raisin ice cream, which was perfect. I also did not have 8x8 pan, used an oblong 7x10 glass. So yummy, also  I couldn’t stop eating the edges-they were like a crispy but soft hermit.

YUM!!! Followed others advice. Double the spices. Be sure to use unsulphured molasses. I added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce to the moist ingredients. Baked for about 35 minutes. Perfect!!!

I will try using applesauce or adding some oil next time as it's not as moist as id like. I doubled all the spices, and that is a must. I have way had better- this was just ok for me.

I have always used the Meta Givens recipe for gingerbread and it is fantastic.  Recently moved and have not found that cookbook yet.  This was very similar from my recollection.  I did double spices as many have written and added 1/4 c of canola oil.   My family likes spicy and moist cakes.  This was excellent.  Served with whipped cream with 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 T of finely chopped candied ginger.

I rated this 5 star because it was good and it came out beautifully but, I guess I do not like gingerbread very much. This was the very first time I have tried gingerbread, I have never even had the cookies.... I won't rate less stars because it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. So, for people who do enjoy gingerbread, I do recommend this cake.

Totally messed up this recipe and it still came out "Gooda than Good".
I added the sugar to the other dry ingredients so I did not have anything to add to the butter except the egg and molesses.  I than added the dry indegrients  and hot water (which I microwaved for 5 minutes, it was boiling).
I baked it in a 350 oven for 50 minutes and to my surprise it had the house stanky good.  It was very delicious and I will make again, hopefully following the recipe to the tee.

The 1/2 cup sugar did not balance the overwhelming flavor of 1 cup molasses. I used organic, because it's all I have access to here in Costa Rica, but it was far too pungent. I had to add another cup of sugar just to make it palatable. This, of course, changed the consistency. It was okay, but really dark and robust. A bit strong for my taste. I'll play with this recipe and probably cut back on the molasses so I don't need to use as much sugar and see what happens.

I doubled the spices and also added half a cup of applesauce like a previous reviewer recommended. But then I also added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder. I doubled the entire recipe and turned it into a 6 layer cake with Cinnamon Cream Cheese frosting. It was a hit.

I followed some others’ recommendations and doubled spices. I shouldn’t have. I do think I’ll try subbing applesauce for half the butter next time for moisture.

Very dense cake; definitely needs more spice flavour; maybe I used the wrong molasses - I used fancy molasses. I will look for a recipe that is more fluffy cake-like.

I made some changes to the recipe .  I doubled the spices and added nutmeg as well.  I did use blackstrap molasses but I added some honey and about 1/4 cup white sugar, maybe a tablespoon of oil (I only had olive oil so I used that) and  1/2 cup of pumpkin puree and then some. I baked for about 45 minutes give or take. I also added vanilla.   I checked the oven at about 40 plus minutes. The gingerbread came out wonderfully moist and topped with whip cream and I can't stop eating it.I didn't have any fruit or nuts handy but that would make a good addition.

I followed several posters advice...used a 9 x 13 pan, cut back on the time to 35 minutes; used butter flavored Crisco in place of butter, and added 1/4 cup or so of applesauce for moisture; also used double the amount of spices. And lastly, and probably most important, did NOT use the strong blackstrap molasses, but rather used a sugar cane molasses. With these changes, this is worthy of ten stars!!! Will be serving for Thanksgiving tomorrow....yum.....

I made this gingerbread for a neighbor who complained her mom's was really dry. I used a cup of dark molasses and as another reviewer suggested, added applesauce (1/2 cup) and as others suggested, doubled all the spices. I gave it to 6 people the same night, and everyone loved it. I'll make it again the same way the next time my neighbor asks for it. I am debating on making it in a loaf pan as it would be easier for giveaways and slicing.

I did set my timer for about 45 minutes and when I checked it at a little over 39 a wooden skewer came out clean.  I would recommend checking it earlier than the hour for sure if you want a moist gingerbread.

I gave it 5 stars because I am an outsider where I live, and my neighbors liking what I make is a big plus for me socially.

Thank you to the previous reviewers who noted baking time of 1 hour being way too long. 

45 minutes was appropriate. In a dark or nonstick pan decrease baking temperature to 325. At a minimum double the spices. 

It was ok with these alterations.

My first time making gingerbread from scratch for my husband's birthday.  I read a handful of reviews and took the popular suggestion of doubling the cinnamon, ginger and clove.  I also went heavy on the hot water.  Turned out perfect!  Everyone loved it.  Easy to make, made it with my young grandsons.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the directions exactly, but was suspicious of the 1 hour bake time. I set a timer for 40 minutes- the knife came out clean but I kept baking anyway- probably a total of 52 minutes- and it was great. The texture is nice and light. Next time I make it, I would reduce the ginger and increase the sugar- just my preference.

Love it!  I followed the review advice and double the spices and checked it at 45 minutes. It was done perfectly. I also added some candied ginger to further boost the flavor. It was quick and easy.

Tasted it before it was baked, just right for me using double spices and brown sugar and applesauce instead of white sugar and butter. pancake mix instead of flour. used Grandma's molasses and baked it in a bundt pan 40 minutes at 375°.

This was very good. I followed directions exactly except I doubled the ginger & cinnamon. I do not have a 9x9 pan so I used 2 8x5 loaf pans and baked for only 40 minutes. The loaves came out perfect. I served thick slices with vanilla ice cream and it was yummy. I think it would be really scrumptious with a cream cheese frosting (and would not need ice cream or whipped cream). Highly recommend!

The recipe is very good, with all the changes noted by others.  I imagine without those changes however, it would have been a very bland and dry cake indeed.  

I was looking for a fluffy, moist, molasses based dark ginger cake to reproduce something I have had at a local coffee shop.  This is close but does require changes.  

First, I doubled the recipe to make two casserole pan approximately 8x12 cakes.
Second, I doubled the spices except ginger...I used two table spoons powdered ginger and an entire small- medium sized grated root equalling perhaps 1/4-1/2 cup grated ginger which is quite a great deal more than this recipe called for.
Third, I added an entire cup of oil for moistness as was recommended by another user.

The cake is very good!  I have to agree with another user who rated it 1 star though.  They recommend reposting the recipe with all the changes others have made.  Clearly it is desired since everyone has made the changes.  I really wasn't sure what I was going to end up with (felt safe enough with my changes but...)  it would be nice to have a recipe that is what people like to start with so we can build from there.

As I was making 2 cakes and needed to double everything, for all the spices I did 2 1/2 times the amount called for.  It made for just the right amount of spice between the 2 cakes.  For one cake I would add more of each spice as well.  Also it says it makes 9 servings, makes for very large slice of cake, mine were round pans and I got 16 slices of very decent size.

Excellent recipe; I made this for Christmas dinner & it was a hit!!!! I followed the advice of the previous reviews of doubling some of the spice measurements, and I also used Jamaican molasses (Blue Mountain brand) which also gave it a nice flavor and nice, deep color reminiscent of a Caribbean black run cake. The recipe is definitely a keeper!!!!

This was a disaster.....not sure what went wrong....I forgot the salt but the molasses flavour was exceptionally strong and it truly tasted synthetic.  I actually threw it out before serving it to any guests....

This is a good basic recipe.  I think since we all have different experiences - expectations are different (obviously).  To me, gingerbread is a dense moist cake w/a lot of flavor.  Not a light fluffy cake.  This recipe is a good starting point - but I double the spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves).  I use Grandma's brand unsulphured molasses.  I use a bundt pan that I HEAVILY butter, and then I dust it with a little of the flour mixture (firmly tapping out excess).  I bake for 33 minutes in my oven and it comes out perfectly.  I cool it in the pan on a rack for about 10 minutes, and then tap it out onto a serving plate to cool completely.  My family enjoys it with lemon curd.

It was delicious and just like my Mom used to make.  It might be my oven but at 50 minutes it was more than ready to come out. Recommend seething a timer for 45 minutes to check in it!

I have made this recipe multiple times, and I love it! It is moist and has a little bit of a sharpness, from the molasses and spices. 

I have been experimenting with different types of molasses, which has been interesting. Each type changes the taste slightly--I was hunting for strong, warm flavor, without too much sharpness. My favorite molasses to use has been Golden Barrel Unsulphured Premier Baking Molasses, which I found on Amazon.

I've made this twice now and the dish you cook it in and the amoutn of molasses makes a big difference. The first time I put it in mini bread loaf tins - it filled 3 - and it was really dense and dark and molasses-y - so strong that it knocked you out. We loved it! The second time I put it in a big bread loaf pan and couldn't squeeze the last 1/8-1/4 cup of molasses out of the narrow necked bottle, and it came out less strong and airier, breadier. I liked that less. So I guess with regards to the density/moistness/strength thing, just pay attention to your pan shape and size and molasses amount??

We loved this!! Other than bumping the cloves up to 1 tsp I made this as directed. It brought back great memories of my Grandmother's kitchen and the wonderful smells at Christmas. Amazing  flavour and so very moist. It was ready in just under an hour and I served it with fresh strawberries. Thank you Charles.

Turned out delicious. Added half cup of apple sauce and a bit of oil for moistness. Also doubled cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice. Put it in two 9 inch pans and topped off with vanilla icing and caramel drizzle. Sooooo good.

Turned out delicious. Added half cup of apple sauce and a bit of oil for moistness. Also doubled cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice. Put it in two 9 inch pans and topped off with vanilla icing and caramel drizzle. Sooooo good.

Delicious! I have this exact same recipe in a cookbook (Great-grandmother's Gingerbread) and the only difference is to cook for 35 min. So maybe that's why everyone has dried out gingerbread! I doubled the spices like many others (my husband always requests this) and cooked it in a bundt pan, 350 for 35 min. It was moist and delicious!

Tastes good when straight from the oven.  Not as light or moist as I was hoping and I did add 1/2 cup applesauce as suggested by others and doubled the spices.  Will try another version.

This is the second time I made this Gingerbread.  It took a lot less than an hour to bake. When it starts smelling good, check it. It's a  fabulous recipe! Thanks Charles! Merry Christmas!

Help help - I've just finished my third piece and I'm afraid I won't stop eating it!  This is amazingly good gingerbread loaf and I will never buy it again.  I made it with the recommended doubling of spices and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce, and managed to leave it for a day before cutting my first (second and third) slice.  Thanks Charles.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe to the letter because I wanted a cake that wouldn't over power the ice cream that I had chosen to serve it with.  Yummy, perfect! Thanks!

I doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup applesauce, as another user recommended. I made this for Christmas dessert a few days ahead of time and wrapped it in plastic wrap and froze it. I thawed it out the morning of our dinner and served it with roasted apples, salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was amazing! Super moist and full of flavor on it's own...and the apples and salty caramel complemented it perfectly.

I will make this again!  I changed a few things because of my personal preferences.  Used pure sorghum (not sorghum pancake syrup, which has other ingredients), instead of molasses, because I don't care for molasses.  Other reviewers increased the spices, so I gave it a try and liked it.  2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1, 1 TB ginger instead of 1 tsp, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp mace, 1/4 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp coriander.  Saw a reviewer that added applesauce, so I added 1/2 cup home canned, unsweetened applesauce.  I used my tube springform pan, and the gingerbread tested done in 40 min.  I cut the bread in half and froze one half for the Christmas morning table.  The other half lasted less than a day.  I had lots of taste testers!  This gingerbread differs from the French Pain d'épices in that it uses molasses (I used sorghum) instead of honey.  I just may try it with honey sometime.

Great recipe. I ran out of molasses due to to a last minute decision to doube the recipe and had kings syrup on hand and used it to make up the difference. I like molasses so I will have to make again to observe the effect of that change. I also doubled the spices and added 4 ounces of Apple sauce as suggested by others in a double recipe. Adding water was scary. I rinsed my molasses jars and used the water from the rinse and added a pumpkin chai tea bag to give the water some flavor. These were delicious!

Great gingerbread and I love that it is only an 8x8 pan.  I didn't have quite enough molasses so I topped it up with maple syrup.  Wonderful

5 stars with the changes. (It may be 5 stars even without the changes,  but I have not made it exactly as directed)   
Add a 1/2 cup  applesauce.  Double the ginger and cinnamon.  We had it with a drizzle of caramel sauce and whipped cream.  DEADLY!  :)

As written, this recipe isn't ideal. Make these changes and it will be. 1) Double the spices. I did that the first time I made it, and it was really good. Next time, I will triple them. But start with doubling and then increase next time if that's to your taste. 2) Start checking the cake after 35 minutes in the oven. Mine was perfectly done at 45 minutes. Use a metal spoon or testing stick, not a wooden toothpick as anything sticks to the wooden toothpick. 3) Don't use blackstrap molasses. Use either Fancy Molasses or Unsulphured Molasses only. Really.

I liked the original recipes but took the time to read many of the reviews and I followed along changing some of the ingredients:  1/2 Cup Honey and 1/2 Cup Unsulphured Molasses.  Unsulphured are the sweetest, sulphured less so and blackstrap is licorice like.  I also substituted 1/4 Cup fresh ginger for the ground and used a dash of cloves instead of what is called for.    That of course changes the recipe greatly so I am now honestly reviewing my own rendition of a Gingerbread.  Whatever - we liked it very much and I made another one in 2 or 3 days for an office potluck my husband had to go to and it got great reviews there too!

Beautiful, fragrant, not dense.  This is also called "Pain d'epices", or "Spice Bread".  Four stars because of my alterations.  Followed the changes of some others here by adding 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, upping the amounts of spices-- 1 TB ground ginger, 2 tsp cinnamon;  kept the cloves at 1/2 tsp.  Improvised from my spice cupboard: 1/2 tsp mace, 1/4 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp coriander.  Used 1 cup of sorghum instead of molasses.

Baked the bread in a springform pan with a center tube, which would explain why the bread took only 40 minutes to test done with a wooden skewer.

Will make this bread again.

The only changes I made were 1/2 cup veg oil for butter, and 1T ground flax mixed with 3T water to make it vegan. I also upped the spices-- When I share a recipe I err on the side of too little- you can always taste the batter and add, but you can't them out!
I loved this gingerbread. I almost added the applesauce as some recommended, but glad I didn't. It was perfectly moist, and not too dense. I thought I would make a sauce for it, but it really doesn't need one. 
I did have unsulphured molasses and thanks to the person who recommended that! Blackstrap is too strong for my tastes. I will be making this often.
I did put the cake pan in a pan of hot water. Don't know how much it did for it, I just remembered doing that before for gingerbread.

I doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. Also frosted with a cream cheese frosting and added bits of candied ginger on top. It was good, but a little dry. I would add a TBSP of vegetable oil as someone else recommended.

Outstanding! I also used 1/2 cup of applesauce and doubled the spices. I also used fresh ginger! Whenever I make cakes that need to have a greased and floured pan, I also use cinnamon sugar as the "flour" instead of flour. It makes a crunchy little crust to whatever you're making. I will make this often!

Not very cake like or fluffy. It's pretty dense. I loved the spice but don't double up on spices or its too spicy.  Was looking for a more cake like recipe. I am still looking for a better recipe.. I made a delicious frosting to put on top made with softened cream cheese , vanilla, cinnamon, ground cloves and Ginger and agave syrup since I was out of confectionery sugar. The  frosting was the kids favorite. More like Ginger bread bars.

I was surprised at how easy to make this gingerbread was - no strenuous mixing. The hot water really helps, it all mixes pretty easy. I am glad it used molasses as it is very nutritional.  It comes out rich and delicious with good texture and moisture.

It was dry and left an after taste. I would never make it again.

Because I think I know what I'm doing some days, I wanted to make changes based on experience & reviews, but wasn't up to the mental challenge of figuring out what I'd like to do so pretty much followed the recipe - only changes out f necessity; okay, one from a review.  :D  'Ran out of molasses so only half cup.  Added a quarter cup dark corn syrup & quarter cup applesauce to "fill in" for the other half molasses.   Wow.  That's it.  'Think more spices - especially ginger - are called for, but this is still good, just not spicy enough for my taste. Perhaps a bit less sugar, too. I had an 8x8 & it was done in 50 minutes.  'Could've been before then, but that's when I checked.  'Fit the bill for a quicktogetintheoven small cake.  :)

Oddly flavorless.  I tripled the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves as some have said to do, but it still comes out with very little flavor. There isn't a lot of sugar in this recipe, and while I don't need my gingerbread to be extremely sweet, I think the amount of sugar needs to be upped a bit. (I also used 1/2 white sugar, and 1/2 brown.) I may put a bit of butter on this to see if it helps with the flavor. If it doesn't, this recipe won't be made again.

Increase spices by a LOT. Add 1/2 or 3/4 cup apple sauce  and 1 hour is maybe too long by 10-15 minutes   but very good.

It was my first time making gingerbread! Came out pretty good. I used double the amount of cinnomen and ginger as recommended i would say triple the amount to give it that kick. It was like something was missing but on the other hand  it was mild which was nice. Obviously in the future I will add and tweak  to make it my own. I find adding the 1/2 cup of applesauce as suggested by others made it very moist and soft. And added extra water just a mil more . Overall great recipe to follow. Will try again.

Great recipe! It is very easy to throw together; I only wish it didn't take an hour to bake. I made it gluten free, but forgot the xanthan gum, so if it doesn't come out right I'm not going to blame the recipe for it. It's in the oven now so I haven't tried it but I tasted the batter and it was pretty good. A bit of a spicy kick, but still good. Will probably make again.

I upped the spices, except for the cloves.  About double for the cinnamon and maybe 1/4 tsp more for the ginger (I was nearly out and just used the rest of what I had).  I also added in about 1/4 cup of applesauce (I used one single-serve cup of applesauce) and cut the salt in half.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  It was delicious!

Very good.  I doubled the spices in it. I also cut up candied ginger  And added a cup of applesauce.  Next time I make it I will reduce the amount of ginger as it was a little to strong.

It was burned on the top, too chewy round the sides, and had a layer of slightly undercooked mixture in the middle. But it tasted DELICIOUS! If it doesn't work out first time, eat the evidence and try again!

I didn't check the reviews before following the recipe. The recipe creates a dry but flavorful bread. I wish I had added applesauce. Thankfully, I added more hot water at the end when the dough seemed gummy. It still came out dry and stiff.

Absolutely moist and flavorful, taste like the gingerbread my mother used to make. I added raisins .  I had to find the recipe to make again today.  My husband would not let me take it out of the house.

A heavenly spice cake!  I doubled the cloves and cinnamon and used fresh, grated ginger instead of ground.  I was boiling water with grated ginger for tea, so used a cup of that instead of plain water.  Just added a bit extra till the batter was just the right consistency, as I saw other reviews saying it was dry.  Made it in a bundt pan and it came out beautifully.  Would definitely make it again!

First, the only changes I made were I added 1/2 cup greek vanilla yogurt and doubled the spices. 

The flavor is really good, I'm giving it 3 stars because the baking time is way off. I set it for 45 minutes, and ended up pulling it five minutes before the timer went off and it's still way too dark on the edges.  Next time I'll start checking at 30 minutes. 

Other than that it's a good recipe.

This was very good and thick! Everyone liked it. Think next time I might use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar or just all brown sugar may make the sweetness a little smoother.

My sons loves gingerbread so gave it a try.  He didn't really like it too much.  Shared it - as I don't like gingerbread - and was told it was too strong.   Don't think I will make again.

I'm glad I read previous reviews,  because doubling the spices really helped. Also when I checked the bread after 35 minutes of baking it was completely done.  If I had left it in for an hour it would have been burned! It was delicious and moist. I will definitely make this again.

Gingerbread is such a comfort bread.  This was a great recipe.  I use to use a box mix till I found this a couple years ago.  I made it today & OMG my kitchen smelt so good.
I used a spring form 9 inch square & did find that the edge started to burn but caught it in time.
50 min. is good for my oven & my pan.  it was moist and delicious.  Especially with  whipped cream.  Yum
Thanks Allrecipes for  another great recipe!!!

This cake was moist and flavourful with a tiny hint of bitterness from the molasses. I increased the amount of each spice by 1/2 teaspoon and replaced the egg with 1/2  cup mayo (I was out of eggs!).  I used fancy molasses.  Also, I baked it in a 10" round aluminum pan for about 40 min. It was very much enjoyed by the children and adults alike. I will definitely make again, maybe with a bit of orange or brown sugar icing. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this today for our Christmas Eve dinner. I added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce made in my Vitamix. I used a bundt pan and dusted with powdered sugar.  It was quite tasty some whip cream on top. I will definitely make this again and maybe try a glaze next time. Thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Does the 350 degrees F refer to an electric oven or convection oven?  I use a convection oven and the cake started to burn within 10 minutes.

I made this for Christmas dessert and everyone loved it.  I however found the molasses flavour stronger than I like.  I used Fancy Molasses and next time will try a lighter molasses or half molasses and honey as some suggested.  As others had suggested, I doubled the spices and will triple the ginger next time.  I doubled the receipe and it made enough for a 9x13 and 8x8 cake.  The 8x8 took 30 minutes to bake; the 9x13 -  40 minutes.  I will try this again with the mentionned adjustments.  I served it with whipped cream and a rum sauce.  The rum sauce really makes it!

Took the advice of previous reviewers and doubled up on the spices.  Turned out really well except that I should have taken it out of the oven at 50-55 minutes rather than leaving it in for the full hour.  May be just my oven.  Will definitely trying this one again!

I thought this was great! I saw all the reviews talking about doubling the spices so I did do that.  I also  saw reviews about dryness and scorching so I added about 1/3 cup of plain Greek yogurt and turned the heat back to 325F as my electric oven runs hot. After 1 hr it was just perfect!

I made this for my father in law. I added raisins and topped with chocolate frosting. He and the kids really liked it. I'm not a gingerbread fan but it was easy to make.

I think people are forgetting if you sift flour, you're expanding it, whereas if you just mix it with a whisk, you don't.  This makes a difference in drying out the dough.  I liked the cake, but increased the spices based on my own preference.

Fantastic! I made it as is and while it tastes on the mild side in terms of the spices added, I made a cream cheese buttercream icing to spread on it, as well as a Buddha's Hand simple syrup (fingered citron, like lemon) and it enhanced the flavor fantastically. The next time I make it, I might try to double the spices--particularly cinnamon and ginger.

Perfect.  I doubled the ginger and cinnamon but kept everything else the same.  Used hot tea for the water because I always have a pot going. I beat the sugar and butter and egg but was careful not to over mix after that.  Baked 35 minutes in convection oven.  (Don't overtake.)  Didn't look done but tested done. Delicious !

My own recipes are boxed up ready for my next move so I decided to try a new gingerbread recipe this year.  This recipe wasn't bad but I'd never make it again.  I followed everything precisely but the cake was not moist despite not being overcooked.  The spice mix was not that great either.

Amazing just as it is.  Very thick/tall. I'm used to it not so thick when I get it from a box mix. This was my first time making it from scratch.  Loved it!

I'd definitely make this again (I followed the recipe exactly), BUT the bottom of my cake was burned :( I baked it for exactly an hour, so I'll try 50 minutes next time.

This is one of our top 3 favorite gingerbread cake recipes. A few notes if helpful. 1 hour at 350 seems to be for a non convection oven method. If you grind your cinnamon and cloves instead of jarred spices the amounts work well. Unsalted butter and un-sulphured molasses work best. Great recipe and worth experimenting with your favorite toppings/icings.

This turned out so moist and delicious! I told my husband that I was going to make cream cheese frosting, or whipped cream for it, and he said it doesn't need it. I was out of eggs, so I made a chia egg with one tablespoon chia seeds and three tablespoons of water whisked together and allowed to stand for 5-10 minutes. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder just to make sure my egg substitute wasn't going to fail. Great!

I love this recipe! It came out perfectly. I baked it in a doughnut pan and a muffin pan, yielding 12 doughnuts and 12 muffins. The doughnuts baked for 8 minutes, and the muffins took 20 minutes. They came out light and perfect, with just the right level of spiciness.
Regarding the reviews complaining about the level of spice or the flavour, ingredients make a large impact on the finished product. Good quality spices that are reasonably fresh will give the best results. Old spices have less flavour. The rule I learned was that spices should be less than a year old when one uses them. Likewise, there are several varieties of molasses. Each behaves differently in this recipe.

This was awesome.  My gingerbread before was dry and this was perfect!!  I just added 2 extra tbls of water and doubled the spices after reading the reviews.  I don't believe that's changing the recipe much from the original.   It was done after 45 min. so I'm glad I had read that in a review too.   I used regular molasses because that's all the store had.   Try this....you won't be disappointed!!

Delicious and easy, I doubled the spices as others had suggested and I added 1/2 c of vanilla Greek yogurt.  Baked for 55 mins in a glass 8 x8 square pan.  Guests and my teens all loved it.  It will be my go to favorite!

Even adding extra ginger and cinnamon, it had no flavor. I didn't get adding the water, it seemed like a decent batter thickness, ...but I did add some of it and the end product was gooey. I'll be trying a different one next time.

i doubled the ginger and cinnamon. will probably tripple the ginger next time. I also baked it in 2 loaf pans. It cut the cooking time nearly in half...good choice since I can be impatient when it comes to my sweets. I used Grandmas unsulphered Molasses as well. Served it with lemon whipped cream and it was to die for.

We made this recipe tonight based on the excellent reviews.  I did double the spices, as others recommended, it could have used a bit more.  I did cut back a bit on the molasses as I didn't have quite as much as the recipe called for, so maybe that was some of the lack of flavor.  Still, it was good.

I didn't use the applesauce, but would add it next time to add moistness.  It wasn't terribly dry, but we favor moist breads, cakes, etc.

Overall, it makes an excellent bread, and even that much better when some minor adjustments are made.

The best ginger cake i've ever made!!!!!!So moist and yummy
I halve the white sugar, replaced molasses with brown sugar and golden syrup. Triple the cinnamon and ginger and cut the ground cloves. Works out perfect.

Great gingerbread.  As others have already commented, however, I increased the amount of spices by 50% and also added 1 tsp. of ground nutmeg.  I cut the butter to 1/4 c. and added 1/4 c. of canola oil.  I also added 1/2 c. of unsweetened applesauce.  Finally, I replaced the hot water with hot coffee.  I baked it in a gingerbread man shaped pan for 30 minutes.  It was a hit with a house full of people.

This was a good and simple recipe.  Definitely up the spices a little if you like more kick.  Only took 45 minutes to cook.  Will make again.

Moistilicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the amount of spices (especially the cloves) and added about 1tsp of vegetable oil for extra moistness as I used GF flour which tends to be drying in and of itself. The result was 5 mini loaves--4 for gifting and one for me. I sliced off a piece to try. So moist and flavorful. The next piece I heated in a pan with butter...Bliss!
I will be making this again this winter.

Lost a star for number of adjustments needed. However, if you make the suggested adjustments it is a massive hit. I tried this recipe (doubled it) to make 6 mini loafs with cream cheese frosting. I adjusted the sugar, Doubling it, and added ginger and Pumpkin pie spice until it tasted right. I think the hot water makes this. Our tap water is extremely hot, I would suggest boiling water if your tap water doesn't get too hot. It makes a textural difference. I baked, at 320 and it had an awesome texture, I like this cook better than 350.
I will make this again with adjustments. I would like a less molassesy taste so I'll use unsulphered next time. I used cooking molasses, might try to find light molasses next year. Huge hit at the party.

I was so looking forwards to this cake, however its the driest cake I have ever had.  I made it exactly as directed and am not a novice cook, not ready for my own food network show, but I know my way around the kitchen.  This was a huge disappointment.

Didn't care for the strong flavor of the molasses.  It also had a slightly scorched taste on the crust even though it was just done in the center.  Think  maybe it has too much molasses for my family.

Great recipe, however, as others reviewed, I would definitely double all of the spices and triple the ginger. I also used two extra Tbs of sugar.  It came out very moist and delicious.

I doubled the spices and added 1/4 cup of applesauce like people suggested. 
I used light molasses(schenkstroop in Holland). I topped it with a lemon glaze...hmmm 
It's a perfect winter cake! Lovely!

1. As other reviewers have mentioned, double the spices.  At a minimum, double the cinnamon.  

2.  Butter substitutes:   shortening works well.  Too much richness is lost when applesauce is used as a sub (although I know applesauce is healthier). 

3.  Eggs:  I have been happy using one large or extra large egg, instead of two.

This is excellent, moist and spicy.  I followed the comments of many reviewers and doubled the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.  I used a tube pan and it was done in 40 minutes.  In addition to whipped cream and ice cream, it also goes well with lemon curd.

This gingerbread is amazing! I made it for my boyfriend who had never been a fan of gingerbread before, but he completely changed his mind after he tried this recipe. Now he's constantly begging me to make it again. It will even be made for Thanksgiving with his mom. It's best served warm with whipped cream.

It definitely needed double the spices. Taste was fine and was moist but agree it's a 45-50 min bake time not an hour. I do think that the molasses overpowers next time will cut it in half with honey. I used a very good quality unsulphured molasses too. But very strong !

Paula up  there obviously didn't make it according to the recipe or had substituted something. This recipe is excellent, it's very old as I had found this recipe almost exactly in a 5 roses cookbook that was from the 50's. I must admit however that it should say fancy molasses.... not blackstrap. Mind you black strap has been used in a pumpkin pie and it tasted excellent as well.

Worst ginger cake recipe that I have tried, and I have been baking for around  50 years. No real taste , except for the cloves. It needs more ginger, no cloves or cinnamon and then perhaps it might be edible. Sorry but I will keep to my old recipe in future.

Something happened! The batter was a bit salty, not overwhelmingly so, but it didn't have the sweet taste I expected! Any advice?

This was amazing! I made it today and took the advice of some other members and doubled the spices. I ended up not having enough molasses by about 1/4 cup but it turned out fine and I thought there was enough molasses taste. I made these in cupcake form to bring to school and everyone loved them!

Really good recipe. I baked it as it read. Heated it a bit in microwave and served it with a caramel sauce and fresh whipping cream.

Wonderful recipe.  I altered things to make it healthier - all brown sugar for more flavor, 1 c whole wheat flour substituted for 1 c of the white, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of any butter.  And I guesstimated the spices.  I come from a high-cholesterol family, so I like to up the nutrition of any recipe!  I will make it again, probably tonight if it disappears this fast!

I did it exactly as written and found that there wasn't enough ginger for my tastes. Next time I will double it. Also found that baking for an hour was too long. Otherwise came out tasty.

I give this recipe four stars because of the adjustments to the original recipe. I read the reviews before proceeding and agree with the increase in spice quantities although I would not increase the cloves.  I  also cut the butter in half substituting a1/2 cup of applesauce to cut the fat content and keep it moist.  I also found 45 minutes ample time to bake.  Interestingly, I live at 7600 ft altitude and made no adjustments to the recipe and it turned out perfectly.   Delicious!  

One more thing, why only make this at Christmas?  It's perfect Fall through Winter as a desert or as an alternative side with soups and stews.

Wonderful Gingerbread!! Reminds me of my childhood. Moist with Robust flavor. PERFECT as written. I baked in a Snowflake pan & dusted with Powdered sugar for Christmas centerpiece. Served with Mom's lemon sauce & Whipped Cream on side.

Followed the recipe *almost* exactly. By the time I was at 48 minutes in the oven, I was starting to wonder what in the world would take an hour at 350, so I checked it and it was absolutely DONE. Any longer, and we'd have been in burnt territory. Not sure how it turns out for others with that extra time in the oven.

The flavor was great, but I'll be following everyone else's lead by doubling the spice.

Super simple. The guests were pleased.

This is delicious.  The 9" pan was too small.....I would use a 9x13". The cake mushroomed over the pan....other than that wonderful balanced gingerbread.

This was excellent gingerbread!!! I used this recipe for my first attempt at making gingerbread over the holidays and it worked out flawlessly. Didn't change anything when making it. I will come back to this again and again. Love to serve it with a rum-sauce and a dollop of whip cream.

I love molasses, but this cake came out tasting only like molasses, IMO.  Granted, my oven is off, but this baking time was waaaay too long in my glass pan.  (no metal cake pans on hand)  I was hoping for a moist quick-bread type of cake, and it wasn't.  Everyone else really enjoyed it, but it wasn't my best dessert effort.

My family really enjoyed this cake.  We did double the molasses, but left everything else the same.  It was moist, tender and full of flavor without being over powering.  I wanted for something. .  I'm not sure what.  Maybe a pinch of nutmeg next time?  Otherwise, five stars.

I made this a few weeks ago, following the recipe exactly as is.  It was delicious!  Just like my grandmother use to make.  I served it with a warm caramel sauce.  We all decided it would be the perfect dessert for Christmas dinner!  This has definitely become a family favorite!

As written this is just so so... pretty bland- definitely not a gingerbread cake- more of a molasses cake. Texture was fine- moist, dark and dense- but NOT enough ginger and spice to be a gingerbread cake.  I made it a second time and doubled the spices- left all other ingredients and measurements as written and still the [unsulfured] molasses was the predominant flavor. Not a bad cake. Both times served with vanilla ice cream - it would not have been good on it's own.

Per previous reviews, I doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also did not set the timer for
1 hour and then walk away. I checked the cake from time to time until it was just about done and then took it out. This is absolutely delicious!!! My only frustration with it is that, as written, the cake overflows the pan. Maybe it's my altitude; I don't know. So instead of a lovely gingerbread smell filling my house, it smells like a campfire. :) Nevertheless, the gingerbread comes out tasting like Christmas and making you crave more. My recommendation is to use a 9X13 instead of a 9-inch square pan if you find that the batter comes almost all the way to the top of the pan. If I need to double the recipe, I'm not sure what I'll use that's larger than a 9X13 and deep enough, but it will definitely be worth finding out. This recipe's a keeper!

Why did mine not rise?  Flat and gooey in the middle - hard as a rock on the edges.  Nice flavor, but serious problem with consistency.  Elevation?  We are at 6400'.

Just like my Grandma used to make-even using the water! I didn't change any ingredients and it came out moist and delicious. The one thing I did change was the baking time. I could smell the wonderful scent at 25 minutes - after testing it was done. Others may have found it dry because they baked it too long. Doesn't take an hour. Served warm with slightly sweetened fresh whipped cream. Just perfect!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, but slightly increased the spices.  Moist and perfect.

I kept all the ingredients as is except I substituted the sugar for Ideal sweetener and it came out delicious! I made a vanilla frosting with Xylitol powdered sugar and spread it on the gingerbread once it was cool....very tasty. I do like whipped cream, but I prefer frosting on my gingerbread.

I made this after reading the suggestions!!  I doubled the ginger and cinnamon, used real butter, and added a 1/2 cup of applesauce!!  I'm making it again today!! Just came over here for the recipe!!!  And it is better if you make it a day ahead!! more mellow! I just put whipped topping on it!!  no need for sauces!  they just take away from the wonderful flavor!

This was great, very moist, though I did use the suggestions for adding applesauce and doubling the spices. It kept very. well also.

Good place to start. So glad I found this recipe.   Followed suggestions and added a couple of my own.    Added the 1/2 c applesauce + 2 Tbs oil.   Used the mild unsulphered molasses.   Spices - 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 Tbs ginger, 1.5 tsp cloves.   Makes a huge difference to use brand name spices like McCormick!   The generic store brands just don't have that robust kick.  Also used a bundt pan in a 350 oven for 50 mins.  Perfect!   Let cool then dump out.   Also added 1 Tbs cocoa for a deeper color.

Tried this recipe for a group of about 50 kids and 5 adults and only one person didn't like it.(And that person just didn't like molasses.) I personally loved it and I will definitely make it again! I added a teaspoon of vanilla, two pinches of nutmeg and a very thin layer of powdered sugar on top before baking, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe, besides a reduction of 2 minutes in cooking time. Amazing recipe and a very good take on one of my favorite recipes.

Just made this for my family and it came out very nicely. I did add a lil too much ground cloves, but its definitely a easy & tasty recipe next time though I'll remember to make sure I have some powder sugar on hand for garnishing. Love it it came out moist and so yummy!

I've been looking for a gingerbread recipe like my Mom's for a while now, and this is it! I doubled the spices and it was AMAZING! I only had to cook it for 23-27 mins though as opposed to the hour it states in the recipe. I'd recommend this to ANYONE! Throw some cool whip on top when it's just a little warm and it's AMAZING! The whole family loved it! Thank you!!

Delicious! I have always loved gingerbread but never tried to make my own. I LOVE this recipe. It's exactly the right taste and texture --moist but still cakey. The only thing I did was increase the ginger a little since all the other reviews suggested it. This was wonderful warm from the oven, but I loved it even more the next day at room temperature.

This gingerbread is amazing! It is really moist and rich. I doubled the spices like some of the other reviews suggested and i added 1/3 cup of apple sauce to keep it from drying out. I thought it was a bit too strong of a molasses flavor so I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to mellow it out. It was perfect! I made cinnamon whipped cream to go with it.

Very strong molasses flavor. I love molasses. Be prepared for that. I was thinking of a spice bread when I made this. Definitely a strong gingerbread flavor. Very good. Chock full of iron I am sure.

This cake came out very good.  I changed a few things- used canola oil instead of butter (I was out). I needed to replace the egg because of an allergy, so I used 1/4 cup applesauce mixed with 1 teaspoon of baking powder, set aside to activate and then added when the egg was supposed to be added. I followed one reviewer's suggestion of using a cup of hot chai tea instead of plain hot water.  The cake only baked for 45 minutes and that was almost too long.  Nice flavor and came up nice and spongy- in my opinion, the perfect cake texture!  Tasted great warm with vanilla ice cream!

I have never been a huge molasses fan, but this cake was delish.  I used a 1/2 C of canola oil versus butter and I used an 8x8 pan.  I baked it for an hour exactly and it turned out great!  I tried a little bit the night I baked it and the flavor is definitely better the next day.  More mellow and the flavors have all mingled together, plus the texture is better.

I did as others suggested and doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I should have done as one reviewer suggested and not used blackstrap molasses.  It was all I had, and I hoped it wouldn't make a difference...but it did.  It made the cake very bitter, and I would not use that form of molasses in the future.  My husband thinks the cake is fine, and I made it for him, so it's all good.

I tripled the ginger, and could have even put in more. Definitely up the spices when you make this!

Everyone loved it though. I cooked this the night before and think it dried out a bit over that time before serving: it went from moist to more of a with-coffee-at-breakfast bread.

I made this for dessert tonight and it was a huge hit.  I used 1\2 c prune puree in place of the oil, and doubled the cinnamon and ginger.  Everything else was the same.  It was very moist even without the oil.  Its just about gone!

Really scrumptious cake - I always put raisins in which works well as adds a sweet contrast to the slight bitterness of the molasses.

I needed some gingerbread to make a Paula Deen Gingerbread Pumpkin Trifle and I forgot to grab a mix from store (as the recipe suggested.) So I came a'hunting for a from-scratch recipe.  This gingerbread is unbelievably delicious-- I'm not usually a big fan of gingerbread or ginger cookies, etc... (I'd eat it if it was offered to me, but I'd never crave it.)  I'm changing my mind, big time.  I can't stop eating the pieces that didn't make it into the trifle.  The texture, moistness, and flavor are perfect.  

BTW... I did follow the recommendations to double the spices & add applesauce.

This is very good. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because it seemed incomplete. I made a Dark Rum Caramel Pear sauce with fresh poached Pears and poured it on top and then added a spoonful of whip cream. This really completed the recipe and sent it over the top. Without the sauce the cake just seemed a little dry and half made. Served it after Easter dinner and even though everyone said they were to full for dessert, they all had a piece and most couldn't resist coming back for seconds.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. It's the traditional gingerbread recipe I've been searching for. Like most spicy breads, it tastes best the day after baking.

Great, moist gingerbread! Doubled the ginger, used dark chocolate syrup instead of molasses and just for the chocolate overkill I tossed some semisweet chocolate chips in as well. Good for attacking that chocolate craving and getting a nice ginger kick.

Moist and delicious! I doubled the spices as per many reviewers' suggestions and opted to use warmed beer (Guinness, to be exact) instead of the hot water. I would either increase the spices a little more or add some others (like cardamom, allspice or nutmeg) next time. I think the stout gave it a slight chocolate undertone and only added to the flavour. Great lightly dusted with confectioner's sugar or whipped cream.

Not bad, just not sure if it is a remaker.  Doubled seasoning except cloves which I think is a must.  Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 apple sauce.  Again not bad but not great.

Very good! I did take a suggestion to double the spices, which sounds like a lot, but it actually worked well. I also added 1/3 c softened currants, a personal choice. We had it with our morning coffee, the holiday flavors was delicious (:

This was very good. It was a tad dry for my taste but not bad by any means. I'd rather have it be a tad dry then not cooked. Also, I have a gas oven and I probably should have slightly lowered the baking temp. as it does have a tendency to cook at a higher temperature than a comparable electric oven. I would definitely recommend trying these and possibly add a some extra spices to make it stand out a little more. I wonder if fresh grated ginger would be appropriate in this application? But seriously, Do try:-)

I should have read more of the reviews...mine only needed 30 min. or less in oven...if you overbake and you love gingerbread and lemon sauce...cut your bread into small pieces and put in an airtight container.  Make your lemon sauce or use Jello lemon pie filling and serve warm over warmed gingerbread pieces...so yummmmmy...I trippled all spices plus I added 1 tsp nutmeg also used 1/2 bsugar 1/2 honey to replace molasses and 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 butter...worked out great...sprayed my pan w/pam and sprinkled w/cin. and cloves....the only problem I had was dryness...I believe that was due to overbaking...great flavor...will def. bake again...but I will watch it closer and maybe add more applesauce.  THANKS for the reciepe.

I'm basing my three stars on the original recipe.  I used heaping measures for the spices but still thought it was kind of bland.  It was also a little dry.  If I make this again I will probably at least double - if not triple - the spices and maybe add a tablespoon of veggie oil.  As a base, I guess it was ok.

very easy to make...tasted pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of molasses, but it did not have a bitter taste to it at all.  I didn't have the full tsp of ginger so I know it could have used more.  Didn't have time to make gingerbread men, so this was a nice replacement.

I have been looking for YEARS for a great Gingerbread recipe.  I've made so many that did not come close to my memory of what it should taste like.  I made it exactly as recipe stated with only the doubling of the cinnamon.  AMAZING, FANTASTIC the moistest, most flavorful recipe.  I have stopped searching.  THIS RECIPE is IT!!!!!!

I really loved this recipe. I made changes to compensate for what ingredients I had on hand. I used both whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour (equal parts) because I didn't have enough of all-purpose flour. I used unrefined (raw) sugar, brown sugar and honey (1/2 c each) in place of the white sugar and molasses. I also used candied (crystallized) ginger (a generous tablespoon instead of a teaspoon). Lastly I added a smidgen of allspice. I also topped it with a melted douse of buttercream. It was soooooo yummy! Thank you so much for this recipe. I'll make it as much as I can this holiday season! I can't get enough. Oh and my hubby (who only likes chocolate) LOVED it.

Used splenda instead of sugar, and only about 3/4 cup of molasses since all I had was blackstrap and it can be a bit stronger.  However loved this!  Will try the applesauce next time, just to see how it comes out.  Everyone in the house had to sit in the kitchen with hot cocoa and wait for it to be done!  I didn't have to worry about it drying out - caught my hubby snatching the last piece just before bed!

fair flavor, but it was only moist the first day, after that it was not nice. Really should consider if you can eat it quickly when making it as it expires quickly.

The cake tasted good, I followed advice and doubled the spices.  It could have been more moist, but I'll try it again.

I was never a fan of gingerbread cake until this recipe! Love it and so did everyone who had some! I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled all the spices. Definitely one of my favorite recipes.

I LOVE gingerbread and couldn't wait to give this a try.  I didn't have quite enough molasses for the recipe, but I think the full amount would be WAY too much - the molasses flavor was a bit strong.  I really enjoyed the gingerbread though.  It seems to be an acquired taste, as none of my family or friends wanted to try it!

This recipe is fantastic and makes a beautiful dark gingerbread with excellent flavor. I lost count of how many times I had to forward the recipe after I made mini-loaves for friends and family at Christmasstime. I serve it warm with fresh sliced bananas, whipped cream, and a sprinkling of cinnamon and mmm is it ever great!

Great recipe!!! I doubled the spices per other reviews.  I cut the amount of butter in half and added a half-cup of applesauce.  It came out moist and tasty.  I was done in 50 minutes.  My friends really liked it.  I will make this one again.

Doubled spices, added 1/2 cup of applesauce and baked in a Bundt pan.  Went over quite well at a Christmas party.

I thought this was very yummy. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing is that 1 hour in my oven would have been way too long.

I made this yesterday, and am now a big fan of this easy recipe.  It yields a very nice, mild gingerbread.  I don't care for very strong gingerbread, so I found this perfect just as it is written.  But you do have to watch it carefully toward the end of the cooking time.  An hour would have been too long in my oven; it was done in 50 minutes.

Texture was good - light and moist, but very, very bland.  I doubled the spices and it was still very mild tasting.  It's a good gingerbread for those who want more of a spice cake vs. true gingerbread, but for all that fat, there are better recipes out there.

Good recipe.  I did double the cinnamon/ginger/cloves as other reviewers suggested and it was great. It is a mild tasty bread vs. a desert. Although one could dress it up with icing and it would definitely fall into dessert category. Good recipe.

I've made this twice, both times adding about 1/2 cup chopped candied ginger to boost the ginger bite. The first time, it was perfect.  The second time, I only had "light" molasses and the cake was not quite sweet enough--my fault entirely and I will bear it in mind next time.

Very adaptable recipe! Instead of flour I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free flour and 1 1/4 teaspoons of xanthan gum.  I also doubled the spices using a coffee grinder to grind my whole cloves into powder.  My friends were amazed

I was looking for an upside down gingerbread pear cake recipe, but the only one I could find on this site (gingerbread pear cake) called for a cake mix. So I used this recipe instead of a cake mix and baked it in a springform pan. Delicious and pretty- highly recommended.

Maybe it's because I didn't have molasses and used honey and a little brown sugar instead, but this recipe was just alright. An OK starting place if you are feeling holiday-ish. I think if I tried again (other than wanting to have molasses) I'll follow the advice of others and at least double the spices.

This is hands-down the best ever gingerbread recipe out there!    I more than doubled the spices used, added some nutmeg, and then made a glaze for the top using powdered sugar, orange zest, and orange juice.  It's AMAZING!

My boss is OBSESSED with gingerbread everything.  So I found this recipe when I wanted to make her a birthday cake last year.  She loved it.  She requested it again once fall came around and I'm sure she'll be dropping some hints come her birthday again!  I make homemade whipped cream cheese frosting to top it with and I double the spices to taste.

Very good!  However, I added a little more ginger (it needed extra kick) and about 1/8 cup rum and 7/8 cup water.

I also doubled the spices, which was fantastic. I didn't have a 9 inch pan, so I used a 2 L one instead, where it only took 40 min to bake.

As far as taste, I didn't care for this. But if you take my personal preference out of the equation I would rate this recipe a success. I added 1/2 c applesauce and doubled the spices like others mentioned. The cake was very moist and had a great texture and color. Turns out I'm just not a fan of gingerbread "bread"- but I do love the cookies! Go figure!

Delish!  I used a loaf pan and still cooked for just 45 minutes, and served with nutmeg whipped cream... the cake texture is moist, and the flavor is soooo wonderful.  I followed other reviewers, and added double the spices-- and am glad I did!

It's a good starter recipe but even after doubling the spices it still tasted like it was missing something. I think it tasted more like cake than moist and more dense gingerbread I've had before. I might try it again and add vanilla pudding or something to give it a little more oomph.

This was quite yummy, but, definitely not spicy enough, and it could use a glaze.  These are how I modified the recipe:  I doubled it and put it in 2 loaf pans.  Because of these alterations, I thought it might be too dense, so I sifted the flour.  I also added chocolate chips, which I was leery about but which worked out beautifully.  Lastly, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar instead of 1/2 c. white sugar b/c I was out!  I would make this again.  Yummy!

I added more spices and not quite as much molasses as it called for.  It was good but next time I think I'll make it with a brandy sauce.

Awesome!  As other reviewers, I increased the amount of several spices and used hot coffee in place of the water, turned out moist and flavorful.  This will go into my recipe file.

Very tasty cake.  I didn't have any ground cloves, but I added a little extra ground ginger for flavor.  The cake tasted great except for the fact that it was a little burnt around the edges and the bottom.  1 hour is too long, next time I will check it at 40 minutes, that should be enough.  I think next time I will add some cream cheese frosting on top.

Made this for a birthday dinner and was great!!  Very moist and I also doubled the spices.  I tried while it was mixing and thought had too much ginger (thinking oh no! I have to make another cake) but when it baked it was perfect.  Loved this recipe!

This recipe reminded me of the recipe my mom used in the 40's, very delicious. I added the 1/2 cup applesauce like a couple of the gals recommended, unfortunately I didn't decrease the water.  The center of the cake didn't get done, just the outer edges.  (I baked it 10 minutes longer too) If I make it again, I'll decrease the water to 1/2 cup. It was very moist and I double all the spices except the cloves. Do not double the cloves, it gets much too strong.

Tasty, tender and fragrant.  A little too much for my pan, it overflowed.  Luckily, I had put a cookie sheet underneath.  Even what ended up on the cookie sheet was tasty.

Very Good light and moist. I took sugestions from other reviews and it turned out wonderful. Didn't have ginger but did add the sour cream and doubled the cinnamon and cloves. Made a lemon sauce and my husband loved it.

This is an excellent recipe. I have a Brer Rabbit cookbook from way back and this is the exact same recipe! I loved it :)

I've never had gingerbread, but my boyfriend wanted some so I tried this recipe. I've never cooked with molasses - man, it smells awful! But it makes a nice little cake. After reading reviews, I doubled the spices, and cut the baking time to about 45 min. Didn't change anything else. Yum!

I forgot to put the baking soda in (it was sitting on the counter RIGHT IN FRONT of me, too!) So it turned out flatter than I might have wanted but it was still good. It is not as pretty (because of the lack of baking powder) so we did not use it for gifts but enjoyed it all the same.

very tasty.  I did double the spices as suggested by other reviewers (might do a little less clove next time), and I was out of baking soda, so I used 2 Tablespoons baking powder (1 portion baking soda approximates 4 portions baking powder).  Baked in a 9" round springform, puffed up beautifully, cake-like texture.  Only took about 30-40 minutes bake time, nowhere near an hour!

I altered the recipe like many others have: doubled the spices, added a bit of oil, substituted hot soy milk for water. I also didn't have molasses on hand so I used 1/2 cup maple syrup, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and a splash of honey. It turned out pretty delicious! Very moist and flavorful. Can't wait to have some with a hot cup of coffee.

This was an excellent gingerbread recipe.  Thanks for the post!  I did follow some of the suggestions of other reviewers.  I doubled all the spices and added a 1/2 cup of apple sauce.  Unfortunately my husband accidentally turned off the timer in the middle of baking, so it was slightly overdone.  Next time I will bake for only 50 minutes and I'm sure it will be moist.

Turned out great.  I doubled the spices as everyone suggested.  Next time I'd just double the cinnamon and ginger and leave the cloves as is.  It was rather spicy!

One of THE best gingerbreasd recipes I've tried! I did this one in a tube pan and it came out beautiful! Its a mild gingerbread so if you like it spicy, just double the amount of spices.

I didn't care for this cake very much, I thought it came out dry and tough - My husband said that it would taste bette dipped in milk. I followed the directions, except for using pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, cloves and ginger. I also made this in (2) 8 inch rounds and frosted it with whipped cream frosting. The flavors were strong, but still very tasty.

Followed recipe exactly, and turned out very good. I don't have much experience with quick breads, but I've never added hot water to a batter...I'm not sure what it did, but the gingerbread was moist and delicious! Frosted with home made cream cheese frosting - yum!

I have tried many recipes on this site and this is the 1st one I have felt compelled to review. 
Absolutely fantastic!
have made this 3 times in 2 weeks, (husband keeps taking some into work for his mates)
only suggestion is to double up on the spices.

Giving 5 stars despite some modifications.  I used 1/2 c shortening plus 3 T. butter - I like my gingerbread rich.  Doubled the cinnamon and ginger per other reviews.  Added 1/2 tsp allspice.  Baked approx 40 minutes in a 9 inch round pan (watch the bake time - the time stated on the recipe is really too long).  Cut into wedges, served w/brandy sauce - excellent. Great dessert for cool weather and keeps well.

Definately a first rate recipe. I followed some earlier suggestions and instead of butter used half oil and half applesause and for the spices, I doubled them all for an excellent gingerbread. My husband just loves it. We will keep this as a favorite family recipe.

Pretty good, but not as flavorful as the gingerbread of my childhood--and I did increase the spices, used full-flavor molasses.  Something's missing, and I prefer it less tall so will use a larger pan next time ... but I'm enjoying eating it, and hubby insists that it's not gingerbread.  I's Ginger Cake! LOL!!!

I made the following changes:

Molasses substitution: 1/3 molasses, 1/3 brown sugar, 1/3 honey

Added nutmeg, extra cinnamon by eye

This was light, flavorful, yummy! I tripled the recipe. It made eighteen cupcakes, one 9 inch round cake, and one 4 inch cereal bowl cake. The cupcakes were frosted with white butter cream and topped with marshmallow snowmen from the Family Fun site. My son's Kindergarten class loved it, and the other cakes make good gifts for the secretaries and teachers.

Sadly only giving 4 stars.  I made this for a co-worker.  I took the advice of others and doubled all spices, it was a bit much for her and her daughters, but the husband loved it.  I have tried it 2 days later and I loved it.  I used 3/4 cup molasses and 1/2 cup applesauce.  It was very good and I will make again.  Thanks!

I needed a gingerbread cake for book club and tried this one.  My trial run followed the recipe but double spiced and was ok but too much molassas.  For the event, I used 2/3 c molassas and 1/2 cup applesauce, double spice and liked it better.   Cooking time was closer to 35 min than 1 hour.  Served with strawberries and whipped cream as in the book we read!

Very good.  It wasn't as moist as I had expected but that could have been my oven's fault.  We added whipped cream on top which made it perfect.  Good flavor.

I didn't change a thing and I loved it.  It is exactly like the recipe I made as a young girl.  Aunt Rosas' Gingerbread, the best ever.

Tasted wonderful, especially with custard. Reminds of the ginger cake we used to get a school. Great recipe. Thanks

I made this for Christmas dessert and everyone loved it! It was delicious, and it really was pretty simple to make. In addition, it made the house smell amazing. I just sprinkled it with powdered sugar before serving. I made it exactly as written. I didn't feel it needed extra spices; it tasted like I expected it to taste, but I can understand how some people might prefer it to be "more ginger-y." This will definitely become a Christmas tradition.

My husband went wild over this one.  It's quite heavy [I don't own a sifter] and has a strong flavor, but you KNOW you have eaten gingerbread!  I made a lemon/powdered sugar glaze to put over it.  On the other hand, my grandson didn't like it.  Probably the strong taste of molasses.  Still, I will make it again!  A KEEPER!
