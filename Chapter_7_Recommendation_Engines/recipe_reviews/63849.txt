I sprinkled the potatoes with a little Johnny's seasoning salt (instead of regular salt) and fresh ground pepper but other than that, I followed the recipe exact. Delicious. I made these to go along chili dogs. My husband said this is exactly how HIS dad made home fries.

Delicious! These "Kentucky style" home fries were very easy to prepare and very good. I cut the recipe in half and partially microwaved my potaotes to cut down on cooking time. The bacon drippings while I admit aren't the most "healthy" really gave the home fries a nice flavor. All I added a little garlic, a bit of salt and peper with a dash of paprika and they were perfect with eggs, bacon and toast. What more could you want for breakfast?

These are wonderful. I have been making them just this way for years. Sometimes I like to add just a touch of garlic. I also like to cover mine between stirring to help soften up the potatoes.

I cook the potatoes for about 10 minutes first, then add the onions and peppers and cook for another 10 minutes... it keeps the onions from burning.

WOnderful! This is just how I grew up eating my fried potatoes. It doesn't matter whether you slice them, chunk them, quarter them, or shred them, they are awesome. These must be done in a cast iron skillet, it just isn't the same in any other pan. I add lots of black pepper to mine as well. This is my favorite, but really unhealthy, way to eat potatoes. Wrap these in a flour tortilla with scrambled egg and serve with hot sauce, yummy! Great for breakfast or dinner as a side dish. Good Southern cooking.

This has been my favorite Texas food since childhood.  
I love to eat the hot potatoes/onions with cold ketchup. There have to be some extra-crispy areas on the taters.
Maybe we should just say it's great home cooking with working class roots?

Don't know why they are called Kentucky Home Fries, you can get this in any diner in Pennsylvania!  But, they are very good, I usually add some garlic powder as well, and at times I use them to make what I call a "Garbage Plate".  Scrambled eggs, home fries, cheese, and bacon all mixed together--now that's good!!

Very good potatoes. Not something we can get away with eating every day, but a special treat once in a while. I partially pre-cook the potatoes in the microwave (or use leftovers) so they cook up quicker and splatter less in the pan.

This is an old recipe. My mom used it 60 years ago or more. She would slice the potatoes in rounds. Fattening yes. High in carbs. Yes. But oh so good.

These are the same potatoes I've eaten for the past 52 years ... just plain 'ol southern country cooking.  Here's a yummy tip ... cover your skillet and cook on medium, turning every few minutes to keep the potatoes from burning until the potatoes are soft then uncover, turn up the heat and brown til they're nice & crispy on the bottom.  I also liberally add onion powder w/the salt & pepper.

Don't know why they're called "Kentucky" homefries.  I've always made them this way and am Canadian.  (I also cook my pancakes in a small amount of bacon fat.)   As suggested, I add onions half-way through.  I don't any any salt, pepper, garlic granules or spices (summer savoury is my choice) until the last few minutes; otherwise, they burn and don't add much flavour. I don't recommend covering with a lid as someone suggested; they'll be soggy because they'll be steamed! If we have leftover steak from the night before, I slice and add for the last 5 minutes.

These are the best fried potatoes you'll ever make. My mom made this recipe when I was a child, and she called them "American Fried Potatoes." The secret is the bacon drippings!!! If you use any other kind of oil, your results will be mediocre at best. I use more onion than this recipe calls for, and more bacon drippings too. I also add garlic powder. I add potatoes to the heated drippings/skillet, cover, cook ten minutes on one side, flip potatoes over and cook another ten minutes. Perfection!

I'm over 65 and my mom used to make potatoes like this.  We just called these Fried Potatoes, I'm from PA and we were Italian so this isn't just Southern or Kentucky cooking - I think it's good old American cooking.  Yummy - especially when the slices on the bottom of the pan get nice and crunchy.  I agree with another reviewer who said you need an iron skillet for these - that what my mom and grandmother used!  I don't make these often but now and then as a special treat.

This is what my dad made for breakfast on the weekends as a side to eggs and bacon, we called it "farm food".  He's from Missouri, I think this dish happens anywhere there's German influence. MO, PA, TX, etc.  as it vaguely resembles a German potato salad.  Anyway, it's the greatest of breakfast comfort foods.

I grew up with these potatoes and still make them this way for my family.  They're the best but even better with more onion and some garlic salt.  Cayenne pepper makes them really special.

These were very delicious.  I used a shallot because I didn't have an onion on hand.  I also added garlic salt and montreal steak seasoning.  Thanks!

Like many here I have made this type of potato all my life but they were never quite right.  These were outstanding.  I loved the bacon grease.  I used a mandolin so had even, thin sliced potatoes and I didn't cover them on the advice of one of the readers.  I used onion powder this time.  They were great and I can hardly wait to make them again.  It will be a regular now.

With butter, this was pretty heavy, would probably be heavier with bacon grease.

These are good.  We just call them fired potatoes.  I have eaten them all my life and have prepared them this way all 34 yrs I have been married.

They are probably called Kentucky Home Fries because of the bacon, back in the day...everything would have been cooked in bacon grease, plentiful and very yummy.

One of DH's specialties- He spices them up a little with some grill seasoning and garlic powder. Love 'em!

This is a good, basic home fries recipe. I gave the potatoes a head start in the microwave and then finished in my cast iron skillet.  They came out wonderfully.

Delicious home fries! Bacon grease makes everything better, right? We omitted the onion as we had friends coming over and some don't care for it. I also used baked potatoes to start the recipe to make sure they were cooked all the way through since I'm not the best cook of home fries.

Added more seasonings and like Chellebelle, I pre-cooked my potatoes. Went nicely with our chicken last evening. Thanks!

Can't go wrong with something as simple as this. I do like to add the green pepper sometimes. Very hearty.
