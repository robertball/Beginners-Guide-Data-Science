Very good gluten free pancakes, better than any mix I've tried.  I used agave syrup instead of honey and milk instead of water.  Since there is sugar in the batter I recommend cooking then at a lower temperature, medium low setting, to avoid burning them.

One of the best gluten free pancake recipes I've made. I used 2 whole eggs and 1/4 cup of almond milk instead of water. Also cooked them on lower heat and made smaller pancakes for easy flipping. Next time I'll double the recipe!

With a few changes, these are wonderful, grain free pancakes. My changes: 2 whole eggs, 1/4 cup yogurt. 1 TB Butter,  and 1TB coconut oil melted. Cook at 350 F - 375 too high. I served with bananas & whip cream. So yummy, does not need syrup. Makes 4 pancakes enough for 2 persons with the addition of a fried egg and bacon. Recipe is a keeper.

These pancakes are delicate in flavour and bite but have a sturdy enough texture to hold up to syrup. I think the temperature recommended here is too high because my first batch almost burned outside yet undone on the inside. Turning down the heat helped get a crisp outside and a soft inside. I used agave and flax seed milk instead of honey and water. I only needed about 3 Tbsp of liquid. To get a fluffy pancake don't let the batter get too thin, so add your liquid Tbsp by Tbsp to control the consistency better. Thank you, Craig, for the recipe.

This is the easiest Paleo pancake recipe and it is delicious! I added a little more water than 1/4 c. to get the right consistency. I also added fresh blueberries to the batter! This recipe makes four smaller sized pancakes. Double the recipe for bigger sized pancakes.

I subbed the honey with pure maple syrup and used egg replacer for the eggs. First of all they burned because the heat was too high. Secondly, the taste was not very good. If you are gluten-free and vegan like me you should try the recipe for "Gluten-free waffles" here on Allrecipes. I have made them several times and subbed out the milk with almond milk, the eggs with egg replacer and used applesauce in place of the oil. They are amazing! I know it says waffles but you can make pancakes as well.

Quick, easy and delicious! I took other's advice and substituted 2 eggs, agave and almond milk. Definitely keep the burners on low. If you make regular size-pancakes, this yielded 6 perfectly.

I had to tweak the recipe for people who cannot eat sugar or sweeteners of any kind. Everyone can still enjoy them by adding maple syrup or icing sugar afterwards individually. This is what I did differently. I preheated the griddle to 275 degrees. I added 2 eggs and 1 egg white. Zero sugar or sweetener of any kind. 1 tsp cinnamon. I used a few tbsp more than 1/4 cup milk with a dash of apple cider vinegar and a dash of almond flavouring and a dash of rose water, instead of water. 3 tbsp unsweetened toasted coconut (350 degree oven for 2 mins)and 1/4 unsweetened chocolate baking square, chopped, which i stirred in at the end of whisking everything else together. I used 1tbsp organic extra virgin coconut oil spread on my griddle for frying. I dropped them by 1 tbsp and spread the batter out onto the griddle. Made 18-20 smaller pancakes. They turned out light and fluffy and tasty by themselves. I wrapped them and kept them in the fridge for a week and reheated them for 20-30 seconds in the microwave and they were just as good as fresh. Hope you enjoy my twist :)

Delicious! At first we were a little skeptical about this being four servings, but they were very filling. Nice texture (not too eggy as many Paleo pancakes can be). We omitted the chocolate chips and sprinkled with some chopped macadamia nuts. Served with a little leftover Christmas ham. Yummy!

Very easy to make . I substituted the water for unsweetened almond milk.  And I also added a teaspoon of chia seeds . They didn't fall apart like other recipes and will definitely be making these again! No syrup needed.

While these are not a substitute for a “pancake house” style pancake, they definitely fulfill my pancake crave! We will definitely make them again and would highly recommend them for someone on a lower carb lifestyle diet.

For being paleo friendly and gluten free, these pancakes were amazing! I added two tablespoons of coconut sugar to the batter and grilled with coconut oil & ghee on medium heat. They got a little crispy on the edges, but were still amazing. I topped with a little bit of coconut oil and pure maple syrup. It yielded 6 pancakes exactly. Made the whole batch and saved 3 pancakes for breakfast tomorrow morning. Will definitely make again!

Unfortunately, this is yet another gluten~free pancake that doesn’t flip with grace and ease, leaving the chef frustrated.  Taste is decent, if you’re ok eating scrambled pancakes.  My search continues....

These are delicious, and you don’t need to do all these fancy tweaks I see in the comments. No need to complicate it. They’re seriously delicious. I was making these during my pregnancy to be healthier, and I’ve continued making them after pregnancy because they’re that good. Topping with real maple syrup makes these even better.

These are the best pancakes I have ever eaten and I am not gluten free. My husband loves them. I will never make wheat based pancakes again. I modified the recipe to use what I had on hand. I use 2 whole eggs, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and add raisins, chopped nuts for crunch. I don't have any milks in the house, but this morning I used 1/4 c sour cream and 1/4 water. It made them a little more tender and I will use that ingredient going forward. I used 1 T maple syrup for the sweetener. Use low heat to cook.  I also use an infrared temperature gun to monitor doneness. I flip when the centers register 135 and pull them when the centers are 175 and outer edges are 195.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

I used 2 whole eggs and added 2 Tbs of half and half. I cooked them on medium low just as I would regular pancakes. These are my first almond flour pancakes and I think they are delicious. They are a good substitute if you can’t have regular pancakes but  certainly have a different texture. Very hearty and pleasant flavor.

Loved this recipe. I opted not to use the chocolate chips and used xyla instead of honey. It was delicious! I will definitely be making these again.

These were really good. However in order to cook evenly, heat your griddle at 325 degrees. They are more dense and take longer to cook.

Best paleo recipe ever. I added a tad more liquid (almond milk) cooked it with coconut oil and earth balance. Nice to have real pancakes again!! This recipe is a keeper.  Oh no chocolate chips for me. Blueberries all the way. Oh my end result.

I found this receipt amazing, and you can add so many other things to make it just wat you want.

I do know there’s a conversion when going from wheat flour to almond, and almond flour also burns and browns easier, so if making  these, or cookies  keep this in mind, and don’t feel like you’ve burned anything just because  whatever you’ve made is more browned than you are used to.

I found my almond flour conversion chart in the internet, and basically it’s double or more to whatever your ratio of wheat flour is supposed to be.  My oatmeal chocolate chip, and peanut butter cookies were a huge success as well as these pancakes! 

Good luck to everyone!

This would get 5 stars if it didn't state to cook at 375.  I followed other reviews and cooked at 300-325.  Even then, they got a bit dark.  I followed everything else to a tea on the recipe.   That all being said, it will definitely be in a rotation of meals for me.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved these!  The almond flour does give it a somewhat crumbly texture, but it tasted like cookie pancakes. We left out the chocolate chips and substituted sugar free honey.

DH liked them, which is a high recommendation. They cooked up easily. I’m not paleo so I did use milk in place of water. Yummy!

Finally an almond flour recipe that takes like pancakes and not eggs.  I used almond milk like many other reviewers and added a scoop of protein powder.  My teenage daughter loved them too who is very picky about  "healthy" food.  Thanks for sharing!

The whole family loved them. Used 1 Tbsp Swerve and water instead for a keto pancake. Cooked at lower temp to avoid burning, sometimes it take less liquid, depending of the eggs and flour brand. Thanks for sharing :)

I made these twice for my 8 month old and he loved them. first time I made as written and they were super hard to flip because they didn't set quite right, but ended up tasting good in the end so I guess thats what matters. Second time I used 2 whole eggs, almond milk instead of water, and also added a bit of Greek yogurt and quick oats to help it hold better and it did the trick BUT then ended up a tad dry. My son still loves them so Ill keep making them for him. Thanks for the recipe!

I took others' advice and used 2 whole eggs, beaten up, and almond milk. I cooked them at med-low for about 6 mins a side. They made 8 two to three inch wide pancakes. Enough for 2. 
They taste like everything made with almond meal - that is to say, they taste like almond meal. I used SF syrup and butter and they tasted 90% correct. Just darker. 
I added cinnamon but will add nutmeg as well the next time.

I chose to use two normal eggs and replaced the water with unsweetened almond milk. This recipe was  fluffy and moist.  Also I added  couples slices of bananas to each pancake. I finished it off with fresh blueberries and honey. It was so so delicious and healthy and went along with my lifestyle perfectly. These were also super filling. I will definitely be making these again!

Thanks for sharing! These are a go-to for breakfast in my house..my toddler approves as well!! I use blueberries more then chocolate chips. I also had to tweak it and only use 1/4 tsp of vanilla..when I made them for the first time and used 2 tsp they had an overwhelming vanilla extract taste and we didn't like them. Now we love them!

Delicious, fluffy pancakes. I followed the exact recipe however I did not add any chips to it. They brown up quickly on the griddle so they have to be watched closely. These are a hit!

Turned out great and tastes really good. High temp to cook isn't a great option almost burned them. I used a little more cinnamon and honey but they were great overall.

these are great maybe better then real pancakes. Usually use maple syrup over honey. they are best with jam I think.  Have made them with hazelnut flour and they are even better. trying cashew flour next.

Worked well.  My family prefers blanched almond flour.  I used almond extract rather than vanilla.  The batter was too thick for our taste, so thinned it with water one time and milk the next.  Both produced good results.  I didn't use the chocolate chips.

The pancakes have great flavor. One note: make small, dollar size pancakes. They do no sit up as much as regular and so they are floppy when you flip them.

New to grain free eating. First time making pancake alternative. Not a fan. Chose this one because  it specifically mentioned others being too eggy so I figured that meant this one would not be. It was eggy to me. Perhaps less than others? .. but still eggy. Reminded me of french toast, of which I'm not a fan. I'm funny about textures. This was just a little too on the soft/wet side for me. It was edible. I had a filling breakfast. But I'll keep searching.

Great recipe for paleo pancakes. I was looking for a recipe that did not call for almond milk because I didn't have any on hand. This recipe fit the bill. As previous reviewers have mentioned, cook at a lower temperature to avoid burning. Easy and delicious. *Edit- I’ve been making these pancakes often and I use two egg instead of one egg and one egg white. Also maple syrup instead of honey.  Sometimes I mix up the dry ingredients in a baggie and store it in the fridge then prepare with the wet ingredients when the mood for pancakes strikes.

Very tasty! My kids loved them and asked for more. Definitely cook on a lower heat than recommended, otherwise you will get a slightly burnt pancake. Vanilla extract and flax meal (about a tablespoon) made them quite yummy!

My kids are picky. They loved these. We made no changes except we left out the chocolate.

I used two eggs, omitted the chocolate chips and added a small ripe banana.

I've been trying GF pancakes in my cast iron pan with zero success for a couple of years! This one worked out great! Didn't stick to my cast iron pan!

You nailed it Craig!  First time I made it they were perfect. Not eggy like some of the Paleo pancakes my family and I have had.
Second time I made them I put way too much water so I thickened them up w/a tablespoon of coconut flour. They turned out pretty good too. However, I will stick to the original recipe because they rocked!

This was good. I subbed stevia for honey since I would be topping with maple syrup. I also subbed low sodium chicken stock for water and left out the salt. Looks like a pancake, texture is close, taste is close enough once you top with syrup.
