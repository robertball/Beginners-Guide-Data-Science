Made this for a friend who loves pineapple anything! I changed up the recipe a bit by using jumbo flake biscuits and used crushed pineapple instead. Also I went with other reviewers tips and poured some of the brown sugar glaze and pineapple in between the layers of biscuits .. Very tasty and moist. (Even made a toasted coconut dip on the side for a little pi√±a colada taste!)

The topping of pineapple, brown sugar and butter was delicious, but below the top layer, the sugar coated biscuits weren't so good.  It was a little dry.  If I make it again, I'll add a butter-brown sugar mixture throughout all the biscuits

I messed up and only used one can of biscuits, way to sweet and it was to hard in places, so I will try to do right next time, I was tired and I know better then to bake when I am tired.

yummy variation of the usual monkey bread or the pineapple upside down cake.  I like that it isn't as sweet as a cake would be.  Using dough in a canister makes this very easy.

I made this and it turned out great! I put a couple dashes of cinnamon in the white sugar before tossing the dough chunks. I also drained out as much liquid as I could from the pineapple. I loved all 900 calories of it!!!!
