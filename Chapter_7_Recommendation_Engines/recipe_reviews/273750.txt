Turned out well but the recommended seasoning is a little take. The pork cooked for 6 hours, mixed beautifully. The texture is very good. Warm the tortillas and then fry. Splendid, Iâ€™ll make it again. My guys liked it a lot.

I used shredded beef, packaged, and it was good but I think pork would be better. I will be making this often.
