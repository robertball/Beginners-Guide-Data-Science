I used Israeli couscous because I couldn't find sorghum when I wanted to make this.  I am not s fan of kale but thought in the soup I wouldn't really taste it.  This was awesome!  Easy to make.  I added pecorino Parmesan cheese and it added just the right top layer of taste!  I would make this again for sure!

The soup was great. The sorghum added a nice chew to a meatless recipe. Had to order whole grain sorgham on Amazon. Couldn't find it locally.  Leftovers were also great. Will make again.
