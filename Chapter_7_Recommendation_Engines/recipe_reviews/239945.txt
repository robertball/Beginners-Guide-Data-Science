Initially, I found that the caramel dripped right off, so I lined a second cookie sheet with wax paper and stuck it in the freezer.  After I dipped the apples in caramel and rolled them in nuts I sometimes had to pat them a little so they formed right and stuck better.  Then I put them in the freezer right away, where they shaped up pretty well!  Also, I had to reheat the caramel a few times.

I made this & followed the recipe exactly. I put the apples in the freezer for a bit then tried to dip them in the caramel at different temperatures but the caramel won't stick. I buttered the wax paper, I put them in the freezer after dipping them in caramel, it's a gooey mess. These are ok if you eat them immediately because the uncovered part of the apple turns yellow. I really wish they had worked out.

I was so disappointed with result. I did everything meticulously including drying the apples multiple time. The result was the Carmel all slipped off the apple. The apple balls sat in a puddle of Carmel in the mini paper cups. A lot of work & time put into a huge disaster.

The caramel didn't stick. Like, at all. Maybe the milk makes it too thin? The nuts definitely weighed it down, and I think caused it to drop more. Half way through, realizing this was not going to work, I made a few without nuts. I "ribboned" the caramel from the spoon onto the apples and twirled it. Then proceeded to blow on it and kept swirling. Once I laid it on the paper, it didn't drop as much, but definitely still dropped. I made sure the apples were extremely dry also. 

Once it "hardened", I tried to manually squeeze the caramel around the apple with my hands, but alas, my efforts just made them a big sticky mess. 

Giving up, I just stuck one in my mouth, just to see how it tastes. And  if it wasn't delicious. Someone needs to figure out how to make the caramel stick! It will be delicious!

The caramel ran off of my apple balls while in the refrigerator. I also had trouble getting the caramel to stick to the apples, even after drying each ball prior to dipping.
