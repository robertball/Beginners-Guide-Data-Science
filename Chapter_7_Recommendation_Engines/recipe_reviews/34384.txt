My husband is an avid hunter, and we cook venison year round. My husband, nephew, sons, and I all agree this is the best recipe we have ever tasted with deer meat. The meat was soooo tender. I would not change a thing, but
I will say- I never brown the chops. I browned them the first time, then did not have time the second time-could not tell the difference. 
Now that makes it a really fast and easy recipe- even better!

Great recipe!  I didn't brown the chops, just tossed everything in the crockpot.  Second time I made it, I used steaks because there weren't any more chops in the freezer.  The family loved it just the same!

This was delicious!  It's easy and used just a few ingredients that are usually on hand.  I served it with white rice, but my husband says it's just like the way his mother used to make it and she served it with egg noodles.  For those who don't like venison, they probably wouldn't be able to tell it's not beef.  A+ recipe--a keeper!

This was really tasty. I, too, am not the biggest fan of deer meat, but the venison was absolutely delicious. My husband works hard to get his deer, so I try to find various ways to use it and this was excellent.

We really liked this.  I used hot and spicy ketchup, and since I was very low on onions, I also mixed in garlic.  Didn't have onion soup mix either, so I used garlic and herbs soup mix.  Very tasty!

I too am not a huge game meat fan, but this recipe certainly did the trick.  And my finace raved and has asked tha I make this once a week until the deer is gone.  I am happy to oblige since it is so easy and because I don't mind eating too!

DELISH!! I have NEVER liked venison but I recently killed my first nice buck in WY so since I killed it, I'm gunna eat it :) and this recipe shocked me! 
I changed it up a bit. I used beef broth instead of water and I sauteed the onions before putting them in. I also added a couple squirts of BBQ sauce. 
It turned out awesome! For a side dish I had cut bite size baby red potatoes with garlic butter and Italian seasoning. The whole meal was awesome :) I will definitely make this again. :D

I've now made this recipe a few times.  Our family really does enjoy it.  We've served it over rice and over egg noodles.  We greatly prefer it over the noodles.  Like so many though, the original recipe is way too sweet (and not initially enjoyed by the family).  Changes I've made include cutting brown sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup (or less), adding 1/4 cup vinegar (malt or cider), a clove of minced garlic, a few splashes of soy sauce, and some salt/pepper.  Because I added more liquid, 30 mins before serving I added some mixed corn starch/water to thicken.  The sauce comes out more gravy-like.  Next time I'll chop and add 3 or 4 potatoes to the mix as an test.  Overall, good recipe.

This was incredible!  I followed the ingredients exactly, except I used about 1/8 cup of dehydrated onions in place of the onion (it was all I had left in the kitchen).  As I fried up the meat in the skillet, I decided to try doing the whole thing on the stovetop; I mixed up the sauce, spread it on top of the meat in the skillet, and covered the skillet.  I turned the heat down to 5, and let it cook for about 20 minutes without stirring.  The sauce thickened up wonderfully, and I didn't have to wait the long hour to get it done in the oven!

This recipes was very good.  I normally don't eat the dear chops, but I couldn't taste the game flavor at all with this recipe.  This is nice because we always have the ingredients on hand.  Very easy, too!

A little too sweet, would have been great over egg noodles to tone that down though!

Pretty good, tastes like my grandmas swiss steak. I think that 6 hrs is WAY too long if you slice it in thin strips. It was dried out. Other that that it tasted great.

This was very sweet (and I used less than the packed 1/2 cup it called for).  A surprise to the taste buds when it looks like a gravy.  Served over mashed potatoes, and with leftovers made a shephard's pie.  Next time I would leave out, or use very little, of the sugar

This recipe is very yummy.  I just gave it 4 stars because i've had better...  I took a few other suggestions and added mushrooms, fresh garlic and worchestshire.  I added the chops frozen and everything else at the same time.  Then I cooked it for 3 hrs, took out the chops, and cut them up in slices(it practically came apart itself!)  I served it over beef rice mix.  I would make this again!!!

This is a fantastic recipe! I tried it with tough meat from the shoulder and it still came out tender!  I also used BBQ sauce in place of ketchup.  Will definetly use again.

This was terrific!  I did use deer stew meat because that's all I had on-hand and left it in for about 7.5 hrs (that's how long I was away) and it turned out great!  I served it over egg noodles like stroganoff and my oldest who SWEARS she will never "eat bambi" ate TWO helpings!  (No, I didn't tell her what it was!)  Great recipe and we will make it again!

The best chop recipe I have found. I did add 1 tbsp of Montral Steak for an added kick. My entire family loved it. I think that sauce would be good on a variety of meats.

This was great! The only problem I had with it was cooking it in the oven for an hour. I did this, and the meat was over cooked and turned dry, even in the liquid. If I cook this in the oven again, I will start at 30 min and go from there.

This was really good! I followed recipe almost exactly, just substituting the onion for a chopped clove of garlic ( we dont like onions that much), and decided to stick it in a crock pit low for 5-6 horus. The meat was extremely tender and delicious! The only thing is the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. So I would probably do more like 1/4-1/3 of a cup of brown sugar next time. I didn;t brown meat first, so this recipe literally took less than 5 minutes to prepare. Very good over a bed of rice!Actually would be good shredded and on a toasted bun. Thanks, can never have enough venison recipes with hunter hubbys :-)

We like deer meat; I made this for the first time and we all think it is EXCELLENT! I didn't brown the chops, just put them in a covered dish in the oven for about 2 1/2 hours; I did add a few tablespoons of butter. So very tender and flavorful.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!  I love venison even with a little of the 'gamey' taste but I honestly not tell the difference between deer and beef with this recipe.  I will be making this again and sharing with others!!! Great job on this one:-)

Everyone in my house loved this wild game dish--including myself who usually can't tolerate the gaminess of deer. The meat was so tender and moist with no gaminess.

Wow, so good for deer meat!  And so easy!  I added 2 packs of frozen deer chops (about 3lbs) to a crockpot.  No slicing, no browning.  Added 1 can beef au jus, 3 slicced scallions, 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 chopped red pepper, a half jalopeno pepper, only 1/4 c brown sugar, ketchup and a packet of onion soup mix.  Turned on high for about an hour, then mixed all up and then turned on low.  After about 5-6 hours, shredded with 2 forks, and continued to cook another hour or so.  Served over noodles seasoned with butter, garlic powder and fresh parsley.  So good and tender.  And I don't like deer meat!  Next time I will add more red peppers and jalpenos.  My son had 2 friends over and they all went back for 2 servings.

LOVED this! I had the gamey taste of deer but your couldnt tell the difference between venison or beef! I cut the recipe in half added a whole packet of onion soup and an extra 1/2c water because it was very dry. Served over rice and a side of broccoli. I WILL make this again! Thank you!

This tasted fantastic as is, we really enjoyed it.  However I found it a bit sweet so next time (there will be a next time!) I will probably cut back on the sugar and maybe ad a couple Tbs. of apple cider vinegar, just to suite my tastes better.  We served over buttered egg noodles and buns.

I am not a venison fan. I've never liked the gaming dryness of it. My husband however is a huge fan of venison, so we have a freezer full of it. This recipe was wonderful! You couldn't taste the gaminess of the meat at all, it was super easy, and was definitely a winner! My husband raved about it and when my parents came over my dad tried it and he loved it too. Terrific recipe! Thank you for sharing it here. :)

Im not sure why this has such high reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, the only reason we ate it is because I dont like to throw away venison.  Will not make this again.

I have used this sauce recipe minus the fresh onion for years when baking pork chops or chicken. It never occured to me to try it on deer. THANK YOU! It is sure a nice change from the breaded and fried chops!

Way too sweet. I put in only a quarter cup of brown sugar and added about a tablespoon of Spice Exchange chipotle mexican style sauce and marinade. It gave it a smoky flavor, but the sweetness was just too much for us. Super easy to make. If you don't mind the sweetness, it is perfect. I made mashed potatoes and green beans for side dishes and they didn't compliment the dish at all. Not sure what would.

I have eaten wild game most of my life but this recipe will appeal to even the most finicky of eaters. The meat is so tender and tasty, most would not even know they are eating wild game. We use this recipe at my house over and over.

Mmmm!  Very good!  My husband who always claims to "hate" deer chops loved them this  way!  We ate it with mashed potatoes the first night and then the little bit of leftovers we had on buns with melted chedder cheese under the broiler - VERY good on the bun!

I used antelope chops, did not brown the meat first as other reviewers indicated it wasn't necessary, and added some fresh mushrooms.  It turned into a ragu-type of dish, so I served it over garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about easy and delicious!

Excellent recipe.  You don't even know that it is venison.  It has a nice barbecue taste.  My husband is not a fan of venison but loves this recipe.  Highly recommend and it is easy to make.

I must say this is an awesome quick recipe that I've made many times already.  I've never had venison before trying this recipe as a friend gave us some fresh venison meat so I had to do something with it.  My husband loves it and the first time I tried it not knowing what to expect with the taste, wow it was amazing.  Thanks for this recipe........ Cheers!

The first time I made this dish it was a hit.  The second time I made it I used the sauce added a little more brown sugar, and added it to canned venison that I had shredded and mixed it all together and served it as venison BBQ on buns, it was an even bigger hit!!!!

I made this with top round steak instead of venison meat.  It was delicious.  It was just a tad sweeter than I like, so I think next time I'll use a little less than the 1/2 c of brown sugar...just my preference.  I will definitely make this again.  And I did it in the oven rather than the crockpot.  I will try it with deer next time.

This was excellent. Deer chops are not my favorite cut, because they taste metallic and are a little tougher. This was so amazing. I did it in my instant pot though. Sauted the meat with garlic, since I didn't have an onion, and pressure cooked it for 30 minutes. It turned out perfectly. I added some Worcestershire sauce as well, but just a splash. I served it over white rice, but other people have mentioned egg noodles, and I bet that would be awesome.

added 6 potatoes sliced and and 1 pd of carrots and fresh garlic, and this recipe turned out great.  The wife doesn't care for venison but she really likes this recipes. Great over rice or noodles. With added ingredients  serves 6 to 8 easily. Very good.

This was sweet, but the meat was not gamey at all. My meat was a little dry though. Served over rice. Next time I will cut the sugar in half and not brown meat in skillet first and see how it goes.

I made this using small cutlets of deer meat, similar to beef stew meat.  I had to double the sauce to put in it but thankfully I realized that when I had made the first batch and poured over the meat like the recipe instructed.  I also baked it in a 325* oven for about an hour and a half.  I served it over rice, which was ok.  The meat tasted like beef jerky.  And the sauce was similar to a bbq sauce, I only put 1/3 cup of brown sugar because I didn't want the meat to have a sweet taste like other reviewers have stated when made like the recipe suggested. I cook for 6 kids every night and occasionally 9 kids plus myself and husband, they are all ours the older ones just don't eat at home some nights. The kids that ate this were 14, 13, 8, two 6 year olds, 4, and 3. All but the 13 year old liked it ok. They all said it tasted like deer jerky, but two of the kids ate a second helping. My husband didn't like it but ate it anyways. I liked the first 5 bites, but will not be making this again.

We were looking for a way to cook some venison chops that were given to us by a family member. Followed the recipe exactly other than chopped an apple with the onion and threw it in because it sounded good. It was a hit, even with a finicky 9 year old. My wife mentioned the leftovers she took for her lunch were kind of sweet so will probably reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 or 1/3 cup next time. Also plan to throw some cut up potatoes in the last few hours next time to complete the meal. I think this would work well with multiple types of meat not just venison. Thanks for a great recipe!

Came out great.  I'm not a fan of onions, but they tasted great in this recipe.  I put it over some brown rice.  Next time I think I'd serve up with some steamed potatoes and carrots.

This was excellent and didn't taste gamey at all.  I browned on stove although I don't think that I would have needed to (my deer chops were butterflied by the way).  I then put all the rest of the ingredients on top of the chops that were in a cast iron skillet and covered with aluminum foil and baked in oven a little over an hour, maybe an hour, ten minutes.  Could have gone even slightly longer.

I have never cooked deer meat before so I thought by cooking it in the crock pot, there would be less room for error. I thought it turned out great. It had a lot of flavor and made quite a bit of gravy. It does kinda remind me of beef stroganoff. This is good with mashed potatoes or stroganoff noodle or just plain egg noodles.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. Instead of using all ketchup, I added in about 3/4 cup of tomato sauce that I had sitting in the fridge and top it off to 1 cup with ketchup. I added about 1/4 cup of vinegar, since I used less ketchup. I only used 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar, since I'm not too fond of sweets. I also added a bell pepper and a small can of mushrooms that I wanted to use up. I served it over rice and all in all, it was very good. I kept going back to the slow cooker to get more.

This was good. My husband and friends enjoyed it served over rice. I did make a tiny change because I didn't have brown sugar, so I used 1/2C granulated sugar and a tbsp of molasses for substitute, I also didn't brown the meat, I just threw everything together in the crock and set it on low for the whole day. It came out great and the aroma that filled the house was "wow". The only complaint I have is that it was a bit too sweet for my liking (though the others seemed to have loved it that way). Maybe I'll cut back on sugar next time. Thank you for this easy and conventional recipe. cheers!

This was my very first time making venison, my husband normally always cooks it. This was beyond a success!! Melt in your mouth!! My husband and 3 year old loved it!! The only thing I will change next time is to double the sauce, we're a saucy kind of family! I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you!!

i didn't know what to do with the venison chops we got from our deer.  These are amazing!  Absolutely wonderful taste.  Would never know they are venison.  Put in crock pot on high about 4 hours ago and they are tender and delicious!

This was an easy and tasty way to use up venison, which I love but my husband doesn't care for the taste. This has a great BBQ flavor that completely camoflauges the game meat. Next time, I will follow other reviewers' advice and skip frying the meat, I now think it was unnecessary. I also agree that the cooking time can be shortened somewhat, mine was almost overdone at 5 hours. I will also try substituting the hot & spicy ketchup to give it that little extra kick to make it perfect!

It tastes like swiss steak. I added a little bit more brown surgar though and put the hurry over some white rice. It's really good! I make this same stuff with chicken as well.

I'm married to an avid deer hunter (and have a generous father-in-law deer hunter). So venison shows up at least once or twice a week in my meal planning. I'm always looking for simple recipes to fix instead of roasts and fried steaks. This dish is definitely going into my keeper recipes. 

Like a lot of others, I took a couple shortcuts. I used sliced backstrap that was thawed just enough to get the pack off. It went straight into my slow cooker, bypassing the pan fried stage. I was also out of onion soup mix. The first result of a quick Google led me to a make-your-own version that I had all  the ingredients for on my spice shelf. I also added a small can of chopped mushrooms, just because, and a tad bit of beef boullion. (I worried that the amount of ketchup would make it wangy, but it doesn't.) I set my slow cooker to high and it was ready to devour in 3.5 hours. 

I spooned it on top of some instant potatoes with some garlic bread (the fancy kind made from light bread, butter, and powder ;) ). Super-simple, but so hearty and it absolutely tasted like a gourmet meal. I loved it and so did my mountain-man husband. 

Thanks so much for sharing your recipe for this.

I love venison, but the chops are my least favorite cut.  I usually marinade and grill them and they are "ok".  I made this recipe in my instant pot and the sauce is delicious.   The meat was tender but not amazingly tender.  Might have needed to leave in instant pot longer, but it was tender enough.  I will definitely use this as my first recipe for deer chops going forward.  My wife and stepson who do not  are much for venison both ate seconds of this.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. My husband & son took the left overs to work for lunch the next day & they anxiously awaited lunch time to arrive.  Served it over white sticky rice. My family can't wait to have this dish for dinner again!

Followed the recipe pretty close: I added a little extra water along with some garlic and Worcestershire sauce.  The result was extremely flavorful just not something we liked very much.  I used moose meat and it definitely disguised the flavor of it so if you are looking for a recipe that does that this one will be a winner.  However, in my opinion, it just ended up tasting like a strong, ketchupy, bbq sauce.  I don't want to give it too poor of a rating because the recipe itself, I think, is something that a lot of people may like, just not us.  Also, mine was done and super tender after about 3 hrs on low in the crock pot so definitely watch the cooking time.

My kids ate seconds! I served it over buttered egg noodles. Next time i make it tho i will use less brown sugar. It is very sweet. I used jack daniels bbq sauce instead of catsup and added a splash of soy sauce. I put the shoulder roast in it frozen. After a couple hours i pulled it out,cubed it and then put it back. Started at 10am and ate by 5pm :-) tender and delicious!

There was nothing wrong with this recipe, but it was not spicy enough for my tastes. If you don't like spicy, you will probably like it. Going in, I figured this would be the case. I made it exactly as directed just to see. Had to give it some zing by pouring off the liquid and adding homemade BBQ sauce. I would recommend adding Montreal Steak seasoning and red pepper flakes if you prefer hot and spicy.

I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 only because my husband liked the deer meat with this recipe. I don't like the smell or the taste of deer meat but after reading some of the reviews I thought this recipe would help mask the smell and taste. WRONG! This recipe caused the whole house to smell awful for hours because the ketchup and onion mix made the deer smell so much worse! I couldn't even try it when it was done. Because of this I use a different recipe now that's much better.

I never really liked deer meat, but my husband got his 1st one this year and it would be wrong not to cook and eat it.  Sooo I came across this recipe and I will say my entire family loved it.  I ate it and found it very tolerable and will make it again soon. Which for me makes it 2 thumbs up since I hated deer before!

Yum! I hadn't had deer since I was a little girl.  My husband, for the first time in his life, went hunting.  I had no clue what to do with the meat until I found this.  It is DELICIOUS!!! I've served it at small gatherings at our home and everyone says it tastes like bbq sauce.  A DEFINATE keeper!!!  I also made it with and with out the medium onion, great either way!

This was probably one of the best recipes I have used off here. So easy and so melt in your mouth. My husband even liked it when all he usually like is venison fried. I did do the browning of the steak, though I debated whether to skip that step.

I am not a fan of venison but since I have it in the freezer, I wanted to use it up.  This recipe is so good and I could not tell that it was venison at all.  The sauce was pretty sweet but we used red onion too so that just added to it.  I am glad that I have more chops to fix now! Thank you.

This tasted really good!! I had some elk stew in the freezer, thawed it out night before. Put everything in the slow cooker all day. I decided not to brown the meat first. 30 min. before I was ready to serve dinner, I boiled some egg noodles til just tender, drained, tossed it in slow cooker with the meat for 30 min. Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing.

Well, I'd give it more stars but first I need to try it again.  I baked mine in the oven too long for too high.  It didn't look like the picture at all.  It looked and tasted more like a bbq sauce.  I was thinking it would be saucy but it wasn't cause I'd overcooked it.  I'll try it again another time and put it in the crockpot.  It was very tender but not the best I've had.

Great recipe had to end up cutting into bite size pieces.  Had with egg noodles but would work better with rice to soak up the sauce.

This recipe has a disgusting odor and my kids prefered the deer meat fried with butter, salt and pepper better.  In fact that very night we tried the deer meat fried bbq'd and roasted and everyone prefered the deer meat fried.  The men thought it was ok.

Loved this!! So easy to make and it tastes great!  We served it over rice and then served the leftover with leftover whole wheat spaghetti noodles.  Delicious both times!

This was a great way to use our deer chops!! My husband and I really want to like venison, but haven't found many recipes that we all enjoy!! This was soooo tasty, and the meat was so tender. It was even easy to cut with a fork!! It could be used as a shredded meat sandwich too! Great!

I hate deer meat, but we had a few packages in the freezer so I found this recipe and decided to try it.  I left my meat in apple cider for 2 days, then I trimmed it and cut into strips.  Put everything in the crock-pot, added some other stuff and some BBQ sauce.  Made into BBQ's and served on buns.  No-one but me could tell it was deer meat.

This is a good recipe but it calls for too much ketchup. We still ate it since we love trying new recipes for venison. I'll make it again, just with less ketchup next time. Thanks for the recipe and keep 'em coming!

I sure feel like the odd ball out....this was edible but not preferred by any of our family.  It was also very gamey still....I've had better recipes.  I cooked exactly as written and in the crockpot for 4 hours or so.  Will not be making again, sorry.

Sorry for all of you hunters out there...but I an not the biggest fan of deer meat. However, I tried this recipe and both my husband and I loved it!  It's kind of sweet and savory. I would suggest also cooking some rice on the side, to serve it with. It makes a yummy sauce. I am so glad that I found a deer recipe I like!

Until this recipe came along, I would always choose moose over deer because I find most deer meat to be rather gamey.  This recipe completely zaps the gaminess out of the meat and creates a dish that  tastes amazing.  Great with rice or heaped onto kaiser buns.  Thanks so much for posting this one!

I have a friend that has never liked venison...that is until she tried this recipe.  I clean up the vension so its pure meat, no fat which helps avoid the gamey taste. It's amazing - try it!  Enjoy!

Yummy.  My husband, who hates slow cooker 'roast'-type foods, had thirds and asked me to make more!  It is similar to bbq beef.

I thought this was a great recipe, but I like venison.  I added a little more ketchup because it was too oniony for my husband. Even better as leftovers and served on a bun!!

This is an excellent recipe for deer and am anxious to try it with other game meat.
