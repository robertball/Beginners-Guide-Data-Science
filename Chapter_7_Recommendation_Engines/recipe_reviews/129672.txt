As you mix these up you'll wonder how the dough will ever hold together.  It's like lots of "stuff" with a little bit of cookie dough.  Skeptical as I was, I plodded on, and was rewarded with a real treat.  I used a mixed berry blend for the dried cranberries, only because it's what I had on hand. I used a premium white chocolate which I believe makes an incredible difference, as does toasting the pecans (350 degrees, about 5 minutes - really worth this extra step). Beautiful, colorful, buttery rich and delicious cookie, loaded with chunks of creamy white chocolate, red berries (whatever kind you decide to use) and the toasted pecans. Baker's, you've come up with another good one!

I've been making these cookies for awhile now and thay are great just as the recipe is. But if you want them to be SUPERB, try adding the zest of one orange and 1c. quick oats. I also just use a bag of white chocolate chips instead of chopping chunks, saves time and I like the chunks to be more uniform. I have never made these and not gotten multiple requests for the recipe. Definately a family favorite in our house!!

Excellent recipe!  I used white chocolate chips to avoid having to chop squares.  I used a dark non stick coated cookie pan, and I should have turned the heat down by 10 degrees as my first batch was overdone a little.  The second batch I cooked at 365 and moved the oven rack one up from the middle and they were perfect.  I used walnuts and they were good, I'll try pecans next time - if they're on sale that is!  The cookies don't spread as much as I thought they would, so you can put a little closer together.

My favorite homemade cookies! Usually make exactly to recipe but also sometimes substitute whole wheat flour, vegan "butter", etc and they're still yummy. Great mix of flavors and they're good chewy or crispy.

These are perfect holiday cookies.    Very good with lots of cranberries, chips, and nuts.  Toasting the nuts is key and watch them so you don't overbake.  Right out of the oven they just melt in your mouth.

Wonderful cookies!  I cut the recipe in half, used white chocolate chips, walnuts vs. pecans, added 2 tbsp. of orange juice and some orange zest. These were so buttery, crispy and packed full of holiday flavor!

definitely a keeper and not just for the holidays!  I get a two thumbs up everytime I bake it. I just have to learn to make smaller cookies as I never get 72 of them out of the batter.  

My only suggestion is to use a dough hook when you are ready to put in the flower as it is very heavy.

Made as written except I used 6oz of white chips, I always use half of the chips a recipe calls for, just a personal preference. I also only used 1 1/2 c. cranberries, because that's all I had, they are delish!

I found these cookies easy to make and delicious. The cranberry tartness goes wonderfully with the sweet white chocolate. The pecans add a great texture. I will definitely make again.

Yum, these were good cookies. I have been wanting to try these for sometime with the good reviews. Problem is, I don't care much for white chocolate. So, I decided to just subtitute dark chocolate chips. That worked fine. I used juice sweetened cranberries, and the only other change I made was halving them due to finding dried fruit dominant tasting in recipes and the cost. The base of the cookie was soft, chewy, and crispy. They do tan up for some reason. I took them out after ten minutes as the outsides were turning golden. However, the whole cookie turns like that upon cooling. It doesn't seem to affect the flavor though. Mine didn't quite look like the picture, but more like a chunky chocolate chip cookie. I made a 1/2 recipe, for a cookie tray, and got 36 cookies. I would make these again for a holiday.

This recipe is awesome.  Always a crowd pleaser any time of year.  I used half as much white chocolate chips and I used 6 oz of semi sweet chips.  I also used mixed dried fruits instead of just all dried cranberries.  The family loves this one.

My husband doesn't even like cookies (can anyone imagine that???) and he gobbled these things down, saying, "These are the best cookies EVER" --next batch was requested without nuts, add extra cherries, he inhaled them.  The kids had to fight to get at the cookie plate. Great gift cookies, very pretty, too.

Do not care for nuts in baked goods so left those out and added about 1 C dark choc chips instead.  Delicious.  Temp seems too high though -- first 2 batches were very flat.  Turned (gas oven) down to 350 and baked 10 min and they were perfect.

Great recipe! I always love the combo of white chocolate & cranberries--the TOASTED pecans are a great addition. Other than using Nestle Christmas-colored swirl white chips, I followed the recipe and ended up with some great-tasting AND great-looking cookies. Hopefully they survive their 2-day shipment to the recipients =) as I know they will be a hit!

These are quite good. I made a few minor changes, I used raisins because that's what I had and I used pecans and white chocolate chips because it was easier. They are a bit harder then I would have liked but still extremely good.

A really great cookie! I used all milk chocolate chips instead of cranberries and white chocolate, but can't wait to make these with the cranberries etc. I used a really good vanilla and this was devine! My new cookie recipe (: Hubby gave 2 thumbs up and I think there are only four cookies left (I halved the recipe just to try it).

I cut this in half but I followed recipe exact. I almost wish I hadn't cut this in half. Very, very good. 350* for ten minutes made for a soft and just done cookie. Very Christmas-y. NOTE: I think these would be outstanding with orange zest. I'll try that next time. Half of a batch of these didn't last 24 hours in this house.

i originally got these cookies off kraftfoods.com and even though i'm a milk/dark chocolate lover, i LOVE these cookies!! I get requests every Christmas and can't wait to make them again this season! Make sure to have the full amount of mix ins... Otherwise towards the end of the dough the cookies will be very flat

These turned out great.  I carefully watched the first two cookie sheets, as I was unsure about the appropriate cooking time for my oven.  After success, I proceeded with the last sheet of cookie dough.   The moral of the story is don't bake these too long.  Watch these closely and as the the directions state...bake until lightly brown.   Lesson learned.  My bad.  At least I had 50 cookies that were baked to perfection.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Very good cookies!  I forgot to toast the pecans and must say that they were still good but I bet would be even better if I'd actually followed the instructions!  I like the combo of white chocolate and cranberries, which I've certainly had before, so I was pretty sure I'd like it.  I used white chocolate chips, though, partly out of laziness and partly bc that's all I had.  It all worked fine.  9 minutes was a perfect time for my oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

My new favorite Christmas cookie! I LOVE white chocolate, so I was intrigued by this recipe and decided to try it out for Christmas. It turned out GREAT. It does make a rather large batch and I doubled it (I have a big family). I am sure this will be one of everyone's favorites

I just made these and they are awesome!  I did not change a thing!  These will definitely be a huge hit at our family get-togethers. The flavor from the toasted pecans put them over the top!  I will never skip that step in any of my other cookie recipes calling for pecans....I can't believe the difference!

I had many rave reviews about these cookies after I made them. The dough is very nice, but the white chocolate is just not my favourite, next time I will cut back on the amount of chocolate.

I made them with toasted Almond Slivers, cranberries and white chocolate, one batch cooked in only 6 min
