I really liked this recipe.  At first I was scared to add the cream cheese, I thought it would get all grainy.  I added it to a small scoopful though and it blended right in.  I was also forced based on my cupboard to make a few substitutions: I substituted kidney beans for black beans, regular corn for mexicorn and threw in a few spare jalapeno peppers.  It was still delicious!  
I have a hard time eating venison sometimes due to its gamey flavor--this recipe helped it along nicely.  Would also be good without the tortillas as a chili.

I am the submitter of this recipe. I just want to make a couple notes. Make sure you use THREE (3) ounces of cream cheese, not the full 8 ounce block. Also, the mexican cheese blend is optional. Enjoy!

My husband is also an avid hunter. I love that this recipe using the tough steaks because those are the only ones that I usually have trouble enjoying. This was very yummy and the whole family really enjoyed it. I will be making it again!

I had it without the shredded cheese and it was awesome. A very easy to prepare one dish meal and can feed quite a large family. One was filling enough that I didn't overeat. Quite a nice meal.

O.k., I have never entertained writing a review but WOW, this was good!!  I do NOT like the taste of venison, but my husband is an avid hunter, and we have a freezer full.  This was really good!!  The kids ate it, I would've never known, and there are NO leftovers!!  Awesome recipe!!!!

Excellent Recipe.  I also made this with chicken as I didn't have any venison in the fridge. The chicken came out very tender.   I made only a few modifications:  I added one 10 oz can of mexican diced tomatoes drained and then 6 oz of salsa so as not to use up all of my salsa.  I also put in regular corn but then added 2 tbs of thick gourmet salsa with a red pepper base. I added a 10 oz can of refried beans and I also used 4 oz of cream cheese as to get the consistency I wanted in the end.

Great way to use round steak!  I used chili beans instead of black beans and served the mixture over rice.  My family liked this recipe.  Thanks!

This was a really good way to use up some venison.  I didn't have a jar of salsa, nor the Mexicorn, so I improvised.  I made my own salsa (tastes better than the jarred stuff).  Mexicorn is just corn with red and green peppers in it, so I used a can of regular corn and added a little bit of chopped red and green peppers .  Everything else I did as the recipe states.  This made the house smell great.  We let it cool off quite a bit before we attempted to roll it into burritos, as mine was just a little 'soupier' than I would have liked.  (probably because I made my own salsa, and it gives off more juice when cooked)  I drained a little of the extra juices off and put them in with my rice dish.  We served this with Spanish rice and a salad.  Big hit!  Saving it to my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this exactly to the recipe.  It was absolutely AMAZING! My venison was kind of tough so I cut it into strips before I put it in the crock pot and they were easier to break apart.  Very creamy and the mexicorn added a lot of flavor.  After my first burrito I added some habanero sauce to it.  Made it extra spicy.  Simply awesome.

Very good!  I used beef round steak this time but will definitely use this recipe on venison.  I made almost exactly as the recipe states except I added about a tablespoon of taco seasoning after adding the cream chease and I threw in a half cup of instant rice about 45 min before I was ready to make the burritos to soak up a little of the juice.  I think a nice, "strong" salsa would make this dish a little more flavorful- I used a generic (what I had on hand) but next time I think I will either get a better brand of salsa or add half to start and half later in the cooking time.

Took more like 8-9 hours to cook, and the beans and corn got way too done (would add them more toward the last two hours of cooking). Was very watery and needed to be strained before the cream cheese was added. That being said, everyone LOVED the burritos. The slow cook with the salsa did make the meat very tasty! Would make it again with the modifications above.

I have to say that I was surprised with this recipe.  I did not use the cream cheese, because I am not a big fan.  Instead I took long cooking rice with beef broth and cilantro 1 cup of uncooked rice and cooked it and addeded it to the meat mixture.  It seems to add a little more flavor and makes it stretch a little more.  I ended up freezing some and they come out great also.

I used chicken because I couldn't find venison at our market - they were SO good.  My fiance doesn't even care for Mexican food and he loved them!  We ate them 2 days in a row!!

I loved this recipe.  Great way to use gamey tough cut.  Tenderized and flavored it wonderfully.  Family didn't have a clue what kind of meat it was.  This is a keeper for my recipe box.

I must confess I didn't make this recipe exactly as written but rather used it as a guideline. I used a venison roast and seasoned it with taco seasoning (made from this site) then added salsa, corn and black beans. I chose not to add the cream cheese in order to reduce the fat. The result was fantastic and leftovers didn't last long. Definitely recommend it!

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I was able to prep everything in less than 10 mins and walk away. It was perfect. I used a roast instead of steak and the meat came out just fine. this is going to be become one of our staple recipes.

The deer chops end up falling apart they are so tender. I was a little unsure of adding the cream cheese at the end but it made it creamier and I didn't need sour cream. This is a great recipe.

This was Yummy! Great dish and no gamey taste.  I skipped the last 3 ingredients.  I steamed white rice and served this over it with a dollup of hot salsa and shredded medium chedder cheese sprinkled on it. Was a chilly day and this warmed us right up.

really very good, couldnt find the mexicorn, regular corn worked just fine.  I did add a little salt and cumin toward the end.  Great new way to get rid of the multiple "deer roasts" in the freezer!

Fantastic recipe! I grew up on venison, not beef, and I've never had it quite like this. I used stew meat because I didn't have any round steaks left, and regular corn. I also halved the recipe and it turned out perfect.

Quite tasty!  I didn't have Mexicorn, so used regular.  I also used elk steaks instead of venison and I really couldn't tell the difference.  There were lots of leftovers which were great to eat with tortilla chips.  Unfortunately with just two to feed we didn't make it through all the leftovers.  I'll probably cut the recipe in half if I do it again.  Thanks for a great idea to feed a husband who loves Mexican food!

This was a hit at my house! Couldn't even tell it was venision. I topped mine with some sour cream and cilantro but the rest of my bunch ate it per the recipe. Definitely something I'll make again.

This was very good. I personally don't like the gamey flavor of venison, which is why I'm giving it only 4 stars. It's partially my fault because I usually soak my venison in milk for 3 days, which really cuts down the gaminess, but I was in a rush and had only soaked it for about 2 hours. But, my 3 and 5 year-old liked it a lot and my husband loved it! I will make this again, but I will definitely soak in milk a lot longer next time. Thanks for sharing a great way to change up the venison dishes.

Very good recipe. Yes, as others have stated you are not able to tell it is venison used in this dish. That can be good, for those who are not partial to venison, or not so good, for those who enjoy the flavor of venison. My husband loves venison and said it was just okay, nothing special. My son and I, however, do not like the flavor of venison when it is too strong of a flavor and we found that the flavors complimented each other very nicely without any one flavor overpowering another. I also served the burritos with shredded lettuce inside which added a nice cool crisp crunch!

Had some venison round steaks and came across this recipe. Never made burritos before so wasn't sure about adding corn but this was delicious! I used a can of drained red kidney beans and added a heaping tsp of taco mix. Cooked on high for 4.5 hours. Thanks for a keeper.
12/15/18 I have to say this is a regular rotation item for us. It is simple, easy and so tasty!!! I use any beans that I have on hand and it doesn't matter. So good.

Really good! I used a can of cumin spiced black beans and left out the cream cheese for dairy sensitive friends, but it was still great! Everyone had seconds! Easy recipe. Will use again and again.

Since we canned a lot of venison this year I get to skip the slow cooker step! I add the ingredients and heat thoroughly on the stove. I confess I like extra shredded cheese - yummy!

Tasted awesome!! The venison was so render and just fell apart. I used light cream cheese and Chi-Chi salsa. I also used fresh sweet corn of the ear instead of Mexicorn. Came out great! A little juicy though. Could've gone without the extra black bean juice I think.

Amazing!!!! I love these and so does anyone I cook them for. You can't tell they are made with wild game and my kids even like them! We make these a lot and they are good with elk meat too.

These are fantastic, I've made them a bunch of times.  What a great way to use up venison; it really gets rid of the gamey taste.

I don't like venison. But I like wasting food less. Sooo my brother in law was going to throw away some 2 YEAR OLD FROZEN VENISON and I had to take it and at least try to find a way to use it. Well, this made that old, freezer burnt venison taste AMAZING!!!!!! Like I said, I don't even like venison and I crave these things. Not gamey. AT ALL. I will be making these for the rest of my life. Thank you Lori!!!

Really good flavor.  I did leave the corn out just because I'm not a big fan of corn in my burritos. Nice recipe for venison.
