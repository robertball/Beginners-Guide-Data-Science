It was okay. Very bland as is, I added quite a bit more of the spices to make it edible. Also, it has to simmer much longer than 10 mins. At 10 mins it tasted like raw pumpkin. I'd also suggest using less stock/broth...it became very thin!

This is a nice, thick, comforting soup. I just had to add some more spices for our tastes. I tripled the curry and added cayenne pepper, hot sauce and onion powder. The sour cream contrasted nicely with the cayenne that I added to it.

Lunch on the table in 10 mins! This soup comes together so quickly and you can customize the spices to your personal preference.  I added a bit of cinnamon.  I also used heavy cream instead of half and half to better suit my keto diet. To add a touch of sweetness, I used about a tablespoon of Lankanto golden monk fruit (sugar-free brown sugar substitute). I didn't have chives.  Delicious as written though! I'll be making this one again!

This was very easy to make, however I cooked it for way longer than 10 minutes.  Didn't have any nutmeg so I used all spice instead.  Also, used my own soup broth. We thought it was very nice.

I made this soup again two years later, and even though I liked it the first time, I decided to play with it and add cinnamon and sweetener as another reviewer did. It was good this time too! I like playing with the flavors.   12-16-2016 This is definitely an easy, savory soup. I used my bone broth I had made and frozen, so finding the right amount of salt took several taste tests. I'm not that fond of nutmeg, but again tasted it before adding any, after adding only half the recommended amount, and finally after adding it all in. I liked it better with the nutmeg. I enjoyed eating something different for a change.

It needed WAY more than 10 minutes to cook. After the suggested time it tasted like raw pumpkin. I won't be adding to my favs.

Excellent recipe, wonderful flavor.  As a vegetarian, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Also I used fat free milk instead of the half and half and it was still a big hit.  I've made this three times now and

I have made this soup twice and have been satisfied both times. The second time I added sausage which altered the flavor quite a bit so I added fresh rosemary to balance the flavor. Super yummy. I will also use plain yogurt in place of the sour creme next time. But this is definitely a family favorite.( Except my youngest, she only like Mac and Cheese.)

Fast, easy, and super delicious soup. We had this for our evening meal on Christmas because we wanted something light yet filling. This was perfect. The flavours are smooth, creamy,  and perfectly balanced. Thank you for the recipe.
