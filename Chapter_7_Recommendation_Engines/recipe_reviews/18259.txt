I thought this was really good.  It was a bit too sweet for me so the next time I make it I'm going to cut down on the sugar.

Yummy...great comfort food! For a healthier version, I cut way back on the sugar and butter and replaced the half and half with soy milk. Oh, I also used long grain brown rice, instead of white. It was still delicious!

This recipe tasted quite strange to me and the rest of my family. It was strange to eat something milky and sweet with carrots in it. We will not try it again.

I was weary because of the mixed reviews, but I'm afraid I must side with those who said this was an odd dish.  I had cut back on the sugar as others suggested, but it was still a dish confused between a veggie side and a dessert.  Carrots and onion do not go well with sugar and cream.  IF I make this again, I will skip the sugar completely, add more carrots, use chicken stock instead of water and turn it into a savory side.

Wonderful!  Though I did cut back on the sugar a bit (1/4C).  We enjoyed this very much and it went great with a pork roast.

Make no mistake, this is rice pudding with carrots in it. The taste was fine actually, but as several other reviewers commented, the result was very "weird". The name is very misleading. This recipe is much more about the rice than the carrots. I'm not sure whether to eat this as a dessert or as a side dish. I am really surprised that this recipe still has such high ratings. If you make this recipe, consider it a variation of rice pudding with carrots and onion added as opposed to the more traditional raisins.

Yuck! This should have more carrots and onions, less rice and no sugar! I only added a 1/4 cup (sugar) like the other comments said and it was way overpowering.

Like another reviewer, my husband and I found this "weird."  Not bad weird though, but even while we were eating it, we weren't sure about this one.  I did make minor changes to cut fat.  I used milk and only about 6 T of butter...  but I am just not sure we like this much sweet with our rice and veggies.  We have both decided to try it again tomorrow (LOTS of leftovers) and decide if we want to make it again in the future.

Very tasty, but next time I'd cut back on the 1/2 cup of sugar.  Maybe 1/4 cup?  Others may like it that sweet (my husband does), but I think it needs a little less.  Thanks for the great recipe, though!

This is a great dish!  Everyone in my family loved it when I made it as a festive side dish.  This will be a life-long favorite.

This is a good side dish recipe. I made adjustments based on other reviewers and my allergy to onion. I left out the sugar altogether and cooked brown rice in chicken broth. It was really tasty. The creamy texture of the half and half was perfect with chicken.

This was good, but very sweet.  My husband did not like it at all.  It goes good with something spicy.

Good for a quick side dish, but quite sweet.  I served this with savory chicken, which was a good complement to the meal.

My family liked this dish. I did cut back on the sugar and butter and added more onion. It was a great contrast for the spicy pork roast that I served with it. I will be serving this again.

I Love making this!! I have made it multiple times already.

Changes I made: About a pound of carrots sliced, and instead of using half and half I used canned coconut milk.

Wow loved this recipe.  Once the rice in half.  To one half I did nothing to the other half added the sugar and milk (also halved this).  Both were great.  DH who does not enjoy rice pudding type rice said that the small amount he tried was actually really good.  Will be making again.

My family liked this rice dish.  It was easy to make but a bit too sweet.  I will cut back the sugar next time.  It was a great accompaniment to our family dinner.  Thank you!
