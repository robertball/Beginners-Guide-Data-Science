Yummy!  Easy to make, my two daughters loved it!

I didn't have half & half, so I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream with 1 cup of whole milk.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because it got mixed reviews in my house.  I really didn't like it - I think I just didn't like the lack of eggs - if you are looking for a light ice cream, this might be for you.  My husband, who does not like chocolate ice cream, ate it, saying that it tastes like the milkshakes he had in school that he always thought weren't actually ice cream.  My three year old said it was better than the last recipe (which she really didn't like).

WOW is right! I did use the cinnamon. (yum) I made it in an electric ice cream maker, but we couldn't wait any longer than 30 minutes! We ate it soft serve & it was great. I put the rest in a plastic container in the freezer, & the next day it was PERFECT!!! Looked like "real" ice cream! Love how it has no eggs in it. (gross) Thanks Morton!

WOW... awesome chocolate ice cream!  I have tried several recipes, and though they were all okay, this one will end my search for the best.  And this is so easy, you can't mess it up!  My 3 and 2 year olds "helped" and it came out smooth, rich, and yummy.  It's a keeper!
