Good stuff.  By the by, seriously?  Giving a recipe a one-star rating because you haven't heard of a couple of the ingredients--or, better, something mentioned in a comment? Search engines are a wonderful tool.

Made this for the second time tonight and liked it a lot.  Be sure to use the full amount of butter- it is not that much and it helps the seasonings stick to the freshly popped kernels.  I had to go to a specialty spice shop to find the zaâ€™atar, but they also sell it on amazon. Thanks for the unusual yet yummy snack.

This is quite good. After I researched what za'atar is (which I don't have), in it's place I added a  light touch of dried oregano, cumin, salt and pepper along with the nutritional yeast. The next time, I will try replacing the butter with coconut oil. Kind of addictive.
