This was amazing! I cooked this up for my husband and I, using fresh Little-necks from the seafood counter and we loved it! Great combination of flavors!  Since we dont keep wine in the house, I used veggy broth with a teaspoon of lemon. I'll certainly make this again!

I thought this was excellent!  I would just suggest more clams and cook them longer.

Amazing! I added 1/2 pound of bay scallops to it as well and it turned out great!

I made this last night and it was absolutely amazing! I only did 1 1/2 lbs of clams and added shrimp & scallops and it was so delicious! Great blend of flavors! I agree with a little more time for the clams but other than that, gold stars all the way!

I *love* this recipe. It's definitely a keeper. I ended up making this with broccoli instead of celery, and with shelled clams; and it was phenomenal. My husband suggested we try it again with whitefish (although I think that's because he doesn't want to shell the clams!).

this ROCKED our socks off! I specifically picked this recipe to showcase the local manila clams we had access to by our campsite in Dosewallips Washington. We added about 50 more clams than the recipe called for, but it didn't matter, we just upped all the other ingredients.. served the clams creole over linguine. We're making this one again! So great!

Very tasty, though I had to use canned clams.  I can only imagine how divine this would be with fresh.  I knocked one star off because I needed to add a couple of dashes of creole seasoning - the veggies by themselves were a little bland for my taste.

We enjoyed this recipe. It was tasty and very healthy, my husband was certain there was much oil or butter in the recipe.  I did add some red pepper flakes, and used fresh tomato and jalape√±o instead of canned.  I would give 4 stars now, but it could very well be 5 with some tweaking.

If it's Creole you need to hit it with some red peppa man!   I let it reduce and then mixed in some spiralized squash and red pepper.
