With the revised recipe to show the 1 1/8 cup of butter this recipe is outstanding!  I have cookies very similar to these in bakeries.  I might use almond extract as recommended by another reviewer, but it's light and buttery as is.

The amount of butter in this recipe is inadequate.  When I made it using 1/2
 cup butter, it was so dry I could not get it to stick together.  I added another
 1/2 cup butter and they turned out OK.  I made it again, and used 1 1/2 cups
 butter; had to put it directly into wax paper, as it was too buttery to knead.
They tasted great.  What is the proper amount of butter? This could be a 
fantastic recipe.  I also added almond extract.

This recipe makes excellent cookies. You can vary as you please. I made the 'meal' by putting whole almonds in the blender. Then I mixed slivered almonds into the dough. I whisked all the dry ingredients together before blending with the creamed butter. These are the best shortbread cookies I've ever made. They'd be good with macadamia nuts.

Lovely cookies! I have made these a couple of times. They would be perfect with afternoon tea but do well all on their own too. Just the right amount of nuttyness, nice texture and just a little addicting!! They taste even better after sitting a day or two and freeze wonderfully. Definitely a recipe worth keeping.

If you like short bread you will love these cookies.  The addition of the almond meal takes it to a wonderful new level.  I didn't know what almond meal was so I took a half cup of whole almonds and whizzed them up in the Vitamix and turned it into flour.  The recipe doesn't say when to add the almond meal so I added it with the flour.  A really great short bread cookie.

I added some almond extract and thought the cookies were tasty and light. I do understand what the person was saying about the cornstarch--I plan to cut back on the cornstarch to 1/2 cup and up the flour to 1 1/2 cup. For those who grind their own Almonds, don't grind it too fine for this recipe.

Blah. I had high hopes for this recipe because of the almond meal, but I think the cornstarch gives them an almost dusty mouth-feel. I wouldn't waste your time with this; traditional shortbread is much better and simpler.

The recipe was very good if you like melt-in-your-mouth shortbread. My husband thought they were dry, but I loved the delicate cookies.  The instructions were remiss where the the almond meal should be incorporated. I guessed it was with the latter dry incredients. Will make it again with something separate for my incultured husband. :-)

Awful...please donâ€™t waste your good butter or almond flour on this recipe.  The cornstarch overwhelms the recipe so badly that the cookie leaves a starch film in your mouth.  I tried adding almond extract, like some suggested, no change.
