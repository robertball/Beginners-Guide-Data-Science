I tried this recipe because the combination of shrimp and sausages looked interesting.  However, the cooking times for each ingredient are totally different.  I’m not sure if there is a error in this recipe that you should be using precooked sausages.  In any case, I used precooked sausages and then gave them a head start on the grill before adding it to the shrimp.   I cooked the skewers a few minutes per side until the shrimp was cooked and turned pink.  I think grilling shrimp for 15 minutes would result in a tough and rubbery shrimp.  Please note that I removed the shell from the shrimp for marinating.  It just didn’t make sense to me to marinate the shrimp with the shells on.  What can I say?  We all have our idiosyncrasies.

Great recipe. In order to not over cook or undercook anything, I sliced the sausage and cooked it in a fry pan until done. I was too lazy to put them on skewers and grill so I just cooked the shrimp in the fry pan as well. Delish! I served with salad greens and caprese salad. I will make it again.

Hi everyone!  I wrote this recipe and I feel the need to clarify a couple of things.
1.  I used raw Italian sausages that were split lengthwise 
2. I used the large shrimp 16/20 and cooked them on the cooler side of the grill, yes they do cook quicker than the sausages, so add them when the sausage is half way or a little more to being done.
3.  I did not skewer them, I served on a platter with the shrimp in the center surrounded by the sausages.
I hope this helps!  Thank you for trying the recipe!

I used jalepeno sausage. I didn't really measure anything for the shrimp marinade, but I used EVOO, fresh lemon juice, lots of minced garlic, some salt, and some Cholula hot sauce. It marinated for about 30 minutes before we put them on the skewers with the sausage and grilled them. YUMMMMM... we could not get over how delicious this was. Thank you for an awesome recipe! I can't add a photo because we ate them too fast. My husband, son, and brother visiting from out of town all thought they were wonderful. Oh- my shrimp was small and already peeled and deveined. It did not dry out in the short time it was on the medium-high heat  to warm and slightly char the sausage. So so good!

Excellent recipe! Grilled the sausage a bit prior to adding the shrimp, then spinkled with Old Bay. Again, diced up and made street tacos for some and others on a bed of rice. Thanks a bunch!
