The shrimp in this dish was absolutely delicious but the spaghetti squash was a little bland. I would suggest doubling the shrimp sauce to add to the spaghetti squash. As written there was not enough leaving the squash dry & bland. I would also add 2 tablespoons butter, salt, pepper, garlic and parsley to the spaghetti squash as well. Being it’s 9 degrees out I had to use dry parsley instead of fresh but even with the dry herbs the shrimp was very good! Thank you Barbra for a healthy quick and easy dinner!

The spaghetti squash and shrimp together was too soft and mushy, bringing only one note into the dish. I recommend adding asparagus or other veggies to bring more depth to this dish.

We are doing Whole30 and I needed recipes.  I like spaghetti squash so this was good for me.  My spouse doesn't.  I juiced and zester 1 full lemon for a great tangy flavor and it was good for 2 of us.

I wasn’t sure how this would turn out. I’ve never cooked a spaghetti squash in my life. But this was awesome! We love seasoned food. So, I’m always adding extra seasonings to everything. This dish was no different! 
Before I baked the squash, I rubbed a bit of olive oil on the cut sides. Then sprinkled with the salt / pepper... then added Italian seasoning & garlic power. 
After the squash came out of the oven& was cooling... I sautéed an onion with the garlic.... then added the shrimp with 1/2 of a chopped green pepper & 1/2 of a red bell pepper. ( this added more flavor, crunch & color)
I then added the crushed red peppers,  & more Italian seasoning. 
After I scooped out the squash with a fork, i drizzled a little of the lemon juice on it. 
I did not mix it all together... we did it ourselves on our plates. I did sprinkle with fresh parsley & a little chopped ( food chopper) pram. cheese. ( only because I had some in the frig) once on our plates.

Delicious. No white wine on hand so I used chicken stock. Rest of the recipe was followed as written.  Family requested repeats of this dish.

Always a fan of Spaghetti Squash.  I added Spinach to the mix for color.  Nothing overwelling for spices. flavor of shrimp and squash were perfect.

It was just meh... The family ate it but it was nothing to rave about. Too lemony and I did what others suggested on doubling up the sauce. I won’t be making it again.

This was great! I added extra everything: salt, coarse ground pepper, pepper flakes, lemon. We could care less about parsley, so I left that out and used diced celery. I also steamed some snow peas to go with the dish. I will make this again!

This dish was a total surprise. I made it thinking it wasn't going to be anything incredible because of the spaghetti squash. Following one of the reviewers advice though I added steamed asparagus for some color. This was a wonderful dish! Besides the baking time for the squash the dish comes together very quickly. I will definitely make this again.

We had mixed reviews. Those that didn't mind spaghetti squash loved it and those not a fan loved the shrimp part. I'd still make it again.

I added asparagus, changed the order of things by cooking the vegetables in the oil first then added the shrimp. Added a little butter at the end of sautéing then add the lemon juice and squash. Very good!!
