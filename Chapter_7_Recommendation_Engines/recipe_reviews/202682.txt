Outstanding! Full of flavor. The only thing I changed is I used a red bell pepper instead of a green. Loved it!

Had a bag of spinach and this was a great way to use it.  I added water chestnuts, canned mushrooms, and celery and a tablespoon of oyster sauce.  It was something that even the kids enjoyed.

Very Yummy.  My skirt steak was a bit tough, but probably because I only marinated about 3 hours.  Supper easy, but probably took 20-30 min to cook in a smallish skillet.

I make this stir fry quite frequently. I add rice to it as well and place the spinach and everything else on top with a drizzle of the vinigarette. It's fantastic.

It was OK but could use a little more flavor. All in all I enjoyed it and will make again, but with a few added ingredients.
