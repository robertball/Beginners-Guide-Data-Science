This dough (or should I say batter?) is way too wet.  I had to add almost an extra cup of flour.  The recipe says to pour dough onto a floured board and shape into a loaf.  After chasing the batter around the board for five minutes while adding flour to give it body, I was finally able to "pick it up" and put it in the pan.  I will try this recipe again but cut back on the buttermilk.

I found this recipe for irish soda bread to be very easy to prepare and very tasty. I added my own variation by using a combination of golden and dark rasins along with a very small amount of lemon rind. My whole family just loved it!

Very delicious, I used golden raisins and also added 1/4 cup of dried cranberries, which made it beautiful too.  Nice texture and crunchy crust.

The bread was excellent. The hit of the dinner. Dense but not tough at all. Made without raisins or caraway and was still excelent. Also good dipped in coffee.

Too much wet stuff.  No soda.  It's soda bread.  I changed baking powder for soda, used half the buttermilk and it was better.

My recommendation is to skip the part about putting it onto the board.  Scoop this right from bowl into the springform pan.  It was delicious, moist, fast, and very easy.

I love this recipe!  So easy and raises really high if you put it in a loaf pan.  I made these modifications tho:  I use 1 cup of plain yogurt & 1/2 cup of milk and substituted honey for the sugar and no raisins.  Makes a very moist bread.  Very filling tho.

I absolutely love this bread!  I did find it too wet the first time I made it, so I added 1/2 cup more flour and it handled much better.  No kneading. I baked it on a cookie sheet and it baked evenly with a nice golden, crispy crust.  Since I make my own baking powder fresh (cream of tartar/baking soda/cornstarch) it had plenty of soda in it to make it a true soda bread.  I substituted currants for the raisins.  Not a fan of caraway so I left them out.  The second time around was perfect!

This is not a dough but a batter.  I did not add additional flour but simply poured it into a springform pan.  It came out beautifully!  I loved the sweetness and the caraway flavor.

Wonderful recipe!  It was very easy to make and is not at all dry. I would recommend this recipe to anyone, even people who aren't usually too successful at making bread.

Made this recipe but added 3 teaspoons of baking powder and 2 teaspoons of baking soda.  Also made one with chocolate chips and another with walnuts.  The other was plain.  I don't like raisins and cant eat caraway seeds.  It came out delicious.  My husband loved it. It reminded him of his great grandma's recipe.

The batter was very wet; I just dumped it out on the pan and it still worked out well.  Used an extra 1/4 cup of raisins and no caraway seeds.  Very good.

Irish Soda Bread is a breakfast item; one does not serve it with corned beef and cabbage (in fact, corned beef and cabbage is not a common meal in Ireland).

I added about 1/2 cup more flour and 1 tsp of baking powder. I just poured into the springform pan - no shaping needed. Also lowered the temp to 325 and baked for 45 minutes. It was really tasty!

WAY too wet!  I added extra flour, to thicken it up, but it came out really flat and crispy, and within half the time the recipe said.

I, too, wondered about the omission of baking soda, but I went ahead and tried this recipe as written.  The "dough" was more like pancake batter.  I had to add at least a cup of flour - probably more like two.  All that kneading (to incorporate the flour) made the end result tough, but the flavor was good.  This is my first attempt at homemade soda bread, so I haven't got anything of my own to compare it to, but the soda bread I've had in restaurants was lighter.  I wouldn't make this again without serious modifications.

There is something wrong with the proportions of this recipe.  Too much liquid for the amount of flour -- it doesn't hold shape.  I also think it has too much sugar. I tried it as written and fed the results to the geese. Then I tried it with 4 cups of flour, added a little baking soda (it is after all, "soda" bread), and reserved a little of the egg for an egg-wash of the top.  Much closer to the wonderful Irish soda bread I remember from my childhood -- cooked by neighborhood moms who were born in Ireland.  Enjoy!

This was very good.  I planned to serve with a main dish of mussels, so I omitted the raisins and caraway.  Was only in the oven for 50 minutes and was done...maybe the size of my pan cut down the bake time.  Bread was great for dipping in the broth, and toasted well the next morning for breakfast.  Will make again!

I agree w/everyone. Way too wet of a batter. I added an extra 1cup of flour and just poured it into a cake pan (like cake batter). It turned out a little rubbery-flavor not that great. It definitely needs baking soda. I would not recommend this recipe.

It looked easy to prepare, so I tried, but I found it odd for a soda bread without soda and way too wet, I added a cup more of flour. Was it really intended to be that wet more of a batter than dough. The taste was great though.

I really like the flavor.  Like some other reviewers I had to increase the amount of flour and decrease the amount of buttermilk a bit to get the right consistency.  I put mine in a small cast iron skillet and get a great bottom crust.

I added 1cup of raisins.  Very good and will make it again.  I've used this recipe for years successfully, and lost the recipe,delighted to find it again.  Excellent toasted.

I made it to go with the Irish stew tonight. I had to use more flour to the recipe and currants rather than raisins. Super yummy will make again.....

I made a gluten-free version of this recipe.  I used 2 Cups of rice flour and 1 cup of corn starch.  I added 3 teaspoons of xanthum gum.  I did what one reviewer mentioned, I just put it in the pan and baked it.  This bread came out perfect - although a little sweet for me.  Next time I will use a little less sugar.

Wonderful!!! It's easy, moist and delicious. I agree with the reviewer who said to skip the part about putting it onto a board. This dough is more like a cross between muffin and scone batter. Turning it onto the board might tempt you to add too much flour and overwork the dough, resulting in a tough loaf.
