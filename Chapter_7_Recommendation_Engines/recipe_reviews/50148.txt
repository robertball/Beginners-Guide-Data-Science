I used this at a birthday party and all the kids really got a kick out of this.  You do have to make sure that every child gets one of the "beetles" (cherries)in his or her cup; they really love 'em!

Nice flavor. Be sure to make this right before drinking, as ginger-ale will lose it's fizz. Also, cherries don't float on the top, they will be at the bottom.
