Very simple, needs just a few tweaks to this recipe to make it better. Letting the steaks sit on the counter for 2 hours can be dicey, depending on weather and kitchen conditions; I think 30-40 minutes is probably safe. Not everyone on this site is a professional chef and gets food safety. Frying for 3-4 minutes per side on a medium-hot cast iron and not touching it, moving it,  poking it, lifting it, or otherwise molesting it so it cooks and gets golden is key to medium rare and a beautiful steak. Honor your loved ones; serve them the best looking and tasting food! At the last minute of cooking time, adding a mixture of 1/4 tsp thyme, 1 minced clove fresh garlic and upping the butter to 1-1/2 tbsp, letting it melt into the pan, then spooning the butter over the cooked steaks, lifting the pan and swirling it around them as they stand in the pan for 3 minutes after cooking is complete (removed from the burner, but still in the cast iron pan) is the way to go. Let them stand covered in the pan for another 2 or 3 minutes while you plate up the sides and then serve right away.

Just made these tonight for my husband's birthday and they were a huge hit! I was able to fit 3 large steaks in my 10 inch cast iron skillet. While the steaks were resting I sautéed some sliced carrots in the drippings left in the skillet. perfection! Also, I wasn't able to get the steaks 2 days ahead, so I salted them this morning, about 10 hours ahead of cooking and let them sit on the counter 2 hours before cooking. I have 2 preschoolers, so I let their steak go an extra 2 minutes in the skillet. ours were medium well following the recipe and the kids' was between that and well done. My husband is a steak guy all around and said it was the best steak he had ever had. Thanks for making me a success tonight! :)

OH MY GOSH. 
I thought this was going to be a boring steak, however, it was in fact the best steak I've ever eaten. So moist, flavorful. Sometimes simpler really is better. 
I let the steaks bring for 2-3 days. I will do this again. My husband and my new favorite way of making steaks!

These steaks were incredible. My brother declared it to be "the best steak he had ever eaten" and we were beef farmers growing up. I had made t-bones from the same cow a week prior and they were terrible in comparison. I am excited to try cook the t-bones with this ribeye recipe. After covering the steaks in salt I stuck them single layer in a 1 gallon zip lock bag, sucked the air out, and let them sit in the fridge as instructed. I also used a thermometer and pulled them off right at 125 degrees. They were PEFERCTLY medium rare.

The steak was out of the refrigerator for a couple hours. I put the salt and pepper on and rubbed it in. Added a little garlic powder, and let stand for  30 minutes, then followed the directions. 
This was delicious. And so easy.

Love Rib Eyes and this compliments the Steaks beyond belief, made as directed and melted butter with herbs and garlic then refroze it and than used on the Steaks ...... Awesome! Caramelized 4 medium onions and chopped up cilantro for some steak street tacos!

Made this exactly per recipe and it was the best steak ever!  So tender and juicy and the best part, so simple to make.  Will repeat this for New Year's Eve.  We don't have steak often, but this will be our go to recipe from now on.

I like mine medium well, and brining for two days helped tenderize it. Liked that it was simple and not "overthought". Made with fries. Yum!

Simple, fast, and delicious!  I pounded the steaks thin, and reduced the time.  I also patted the steaks dry before putting them in the pan, to maximize browning.  The best way to cook steaks if you can't get outside to grill (like during a Nor-Easter)!

lol, I wouldn't call it the best steak I've ever had.  I did the whole 48 hours thing with salt and pepper like it said. Room temp, about 3 min on one side, flipped it over, butter, that was about it. Yeah, simple but not something to write home about.  For people who thought it was the best thing ever I guess they don't get out.

This is always how I make my ribeye steaks and it’s always soooo good. Good job to the original poster of this recipe for getting it out there that less is more and a steak sometimes has WAY more flavor with good ol’ salt and pepper and always butter! Just to be clear here because I read the reviews on this recipe, the instructions never said to leave the meat out for 2 hours or frankly any longer  than “30 minutes prior to cooking” - you’ll always get good flavor with brine/seasoning/marinating THEN refrigerating! If too salty, just use less salt next time! I prefer to finish my ribeyes in the oven after a good browning on both sides (usually 3-4 mins MAX) and occasionally like to add rosemary sprigs on top when butter is melting :)

My son and husband loved it.  First time I've ever cooked a steak on anything other than a grill.  Perfect steaks!
