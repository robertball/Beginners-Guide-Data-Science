This is the first time I've rated a recipe on this site and I'm disappointed to say that I have to give this one the very big thumbs down.  The muffins didn't rise, the taste was almost non-existant and they just wouldn't cook.  I ended up coating them with honey, sprinkling them with a load of sugar and rebaking them just to get some sort of taste.

A little bland, but otherwise not bad. I subbed sour cream for the yogurt as I didn't have any, and used egg whites for the whole egg. I got 16 normal sized muffins out of this recipe and I'd probably make them again if I upped the spices heavily. A really good 'no sugar added' muffin, to be fair.

To be fair, I deviated from this quite a bit, but overall it was great inspiration and a good guide for me. I wanted a sweet option to use up some steel-cut oats; omitted rice flour, flax seeds, arrowroot powder, butter, and cranberry juice. Used unsweetened applesauce, about 1 c unbleached wheat flour and 1/2 c bread flour, added 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves, and about 1 c. of shredded carrots and 1/4 c. orange-mango 100% juice blend. Before baking, I topped them with a third/third/third mix of brown sugar/crushed almonds/cinnamon (total of about 1/8 c. topping). These were VERY moist, and delicious when I drizzled the tops with some cream cheese icing. Very easy recipe to modify, probably nice as written, too!

i don't think its fair for anyone who can eat wheat to rate this recipe.  you will never get the same fluffy yummy consistency without wheat flour.  I have a daughter who is severely allergic, and this is the first baked item she has loved with rice flour as a base.  I say thats fantastic!  
I altered it by subbing 1/4 c. applesauce for the egg, also necessarily doubling the leavening baking soda ( i added a tsp of homemade baking powder (1/2 and 1/2 cream of tarter and baking soda), and instead of juice I added 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/3 c. water (more water is needed without the egg).  They turned out the best i have ever made with rice flour of anything.  yay!

My family is gluten free, and my kids have never eaten tons of sugar anyway.  We LOVE this recipe!  Of course, they are not like traditional muffins with wheat flour and they're not loaded up with sugar.  That's exactly why we like them.  I've made it with berries, apples, apricots, and bananas! I actually bake the entire dough in an oven dish and spoon it out.  It's easier to eat when it's not baked in paper muffin cups.

My husband who is a diabetic loved these! I added pecans. I also added just a small amount of turbinado sugar because I was using tart apples. I used cooked steel cuts (can't imagine cooking with them raw). I only had 3/4 c white rice flour so I added 1/4 c WW. My homemade pumpkin pie spice (lots of it) and Diet Ginger Ale in place of the Cranberry Juice. Didn't have any arrowroot. Thanks for the recipe, I had no idea what to use the white rice flour in.

Thank you for a great healthier version muffin.  Other health aware cooks out there need to rate this recipe for it has been unfairly rated by people comparing it to unhealthy muffins.

They were ok, needed more spices.  Husband and kids wouldn't touch 'em until I put honey on top and sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on top and re-baked for a few minutes.

too moist with too little body/structure to it. the flavor wasn't terrible (apples=NOM), but they barely rised and were not dense enough to support all the appley goodness.  i'll try again, but probably use less apple (or sauce one of them?)

Our first foray into "wheat free" -- no complaints from my 4 kids!  The muffins were light and moist, though a little bland.  We sprinkled a little sugar on top to sweeten them up a bit.  I used cider in place of cranberry juice, and rolled oats instead of steel cut.  Next time I'll add a little sugar.

I doubled the recipe and got approximately 20 muffins.  I think "6 large" means those monster size muffins you can buy.
These came out of my silicone baking cups like a dream.

For a wheat and sugar free muffin, these are outstanding!

A small hint of flavor, but overall pretty bland. My kids would not touch them.

All I added was 1/2 C sugar to a double batch of these. But I subbed the flour for Oat Flour and steel cut oats for rolled oats. Otherwise, these were minor adjustments due to what I had in the house and my own sweetness preference. We loved them!??

Exactly what I expected and wanted. Very plain muffin but perfect for breakfast. I followed the recipe word for word and they didn't really rise but the apple kept them nice and moist. I cut the apple a little chunky and didn't bake for the full 30 minutes.

Because it's not made with wheat flour, it isn't quite like traditional muffins. That said, because it's not made with wheat flour, my gluten intolerant belly loves it! Very apple-y. I made it just as written, except i left the peels on the apples, made a powdered sugar glaze, and poured the batter in an 8x8 pan. It baked in about 25 minutes. The cake doesn't cut very prettily, but it was delicious scooped out of the pan wit a glass of lactose free milk.

Should have had some salt in the recipe, as the flavor was very bland. I added a little sugar, but it wasn't enough to provide flavor. I added 2/3 tsp of xanthan and I thought the texture was great. It was my first attempt at gluten free baking.
