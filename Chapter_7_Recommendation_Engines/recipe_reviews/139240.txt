Made this for Christmas Dinner, turned out fabulous!  It was even better the second night. I did season the meat first though w/salt pepper and garlic pwdr. Gonna try cooking it in Crockpot next time.

I was out of cherry preserves the second time I made this and used strawberry instead. Sweeter sauce but the family still loved it and the stawberry was much less expensive than the cherry preserves.
