I don't see how you won't eat any other sugar cookie ... you must eat no sugar cookies.  I wasted a lot of time and effort on this.  I could not roll it out at all ... not after fridge, flour, and freezer.  It is Valentine's day, and I was hoping to make something for my fiance.  All I got was a mess.  Maybe it is the humidity or something ... but I found this recipe impossible and am sorely disappointed.

No offense, but these were the worst sugar cookies I have ever tasted.  The dough was a sticky, gooey mess, even after chilling for several hours.  The tablespoon of vinegar should have tipped me off, however I thought I would at least try it. Never have I had a cookie with vinegar, even this small amount. My little niece took two bites and started to gag.  Needless to say, the recipe was shredded....

No offense, ladies, but I tried this recipe and it turned out perfectly for me so you must've done something wrong.  I'm 18 years old...this was my very first try. I think it's better to knead the dough and add a little more flour as you go along.  Also, dont put both the sugar and brown sugar in at the same time.  It'll make it all gooey.  I added the brown sugar last, kneaded it and then rolled it out.  It was fantastic.

These cookies are the worst I have ever tried to make.  The dough never becomes workable.  It just stays like a chocolate chip cookie dough, not matter how much flour or refrigeration used.  When they did make it into the oven they took 20 minutes to bake.

This recipe was disgusting.  Sugar cookies are not supposed to be spicy.  The nutmeg makes it taste gross.  I waisted a lot of ingredients on this lousy recipe.

I made these cookies last Christmas, and they were the most popular food item there.  My extended family expects them for every occaision.  The are big , soft (never get hard), and very tasty.  The dough is VERY difficult to work with, though, so I keep it in the freezer and only role out a small amount at a time with lots of flour.  It's worth it, though.

Yeah, it's hard to work with, but most recipes are. If you're substituting, remember that butter is different than shortening and they write the recipe specifically for shortening or butter, not the other way around. I liked these cookies, and all the people that tried them agreed.

I didn't care for the dry, cakey texture. Also, I prefer a sugar cookie made with real butter. These didn't taste homemade because of the shortening.

I like to try new things, so gave this recipe a try. I've never made sugar cookies with buttermilk in them...the dough was really hard to work with, which is the main reason I will likely never make them again. If you are making this recipe, set aside time to chill them, which I did not have. I used lots of flour (added an extra half cup to the dough before even attempting to roll them out) and a spatula to transfer the cuts, as the dough was too soft to hold shape on it's own. The cookies puff up nice and big and thick, which is great. The flavor is not really sugar cookie, not really spice cookie; good, just don't expect sugar cookie flavor with all the nutmeg. My son said the taste was 4 stars (especially with the Sugar Cookie Frosting), and I docked a star for 'ease of use' or lack thereof. So, worth a try, probably won't make it again :) Thanks for the recipe though!

The dough on this recipe was WAY too sticky even after I chilled it for a couple hours...so I had to add about 2 cups of flour...and they turned out WAY too soft after they were cooked...and they didn't really taste like sugar cookies...I will not use this recipe again.

My 9 year old and I found this recipe because she loves to bake. For us the cookies turned out fine. The shortening works good - she did all the measuring and I watched as she pretty much "packed" the flour into the measuring cup, so maybe that was the trick. 
We had no problems with the dough being too sticky, just refloured the board about 3 times as we kneaded the dough.
They do need icing or something. My daughter dipped hers in maple syrup and loved them.

The nutmeg gives this cookie a commercial flavor--I think it tastes a lot like the refridgerated pre-made cookie dough.  These cookies get absolutely HUGE so use a smaller-sized cutter, unless you want cookies the size of your hand (or bigger!).  Additionally, the cookies have an airy texture too them, I prefer my sugar cookies to be dense, thick, and faintly lemony.  This is a good recipe, however, next time I will reduce the leavening and substitute some lemon juice and lemon zest for vanilla and nutmeg.

These cookies are excellent! A little harder to work with than most dough, you have to make sure it's well refridgerated before you roll out, but well worth the extra effort. Also, I didn't like the way the nutmeg made it taste, so I skipped that ingredient.

I love these big soft sugar cookies! The only thing that I would change is to make them a little sweeter, but since they are always served with frosting, it balances out.

As you can see by the prior reviews, making the cookies is difficult I will admit. But all there is to it is to just add more flour (like 2 cups or more) or even chill in the fridge for a few hrs. Bu my cookies came out nicely puffy, soft, and flavorful. The cookies do rise and expand like 2/3 the origional size, so they're not good for decorating much. I added colorful christmas sugar and cut them into star shapes. They looked and tasted great! The cookie's nutmeg flavor might not be to everyone's liking so I recommend skipping the nutmeg and/or adding a personal flavor to the recipe. But they are definately good tasting and soooo soft!

Really good recipe. I will omit the nutmeg next time. I loved it. The kids didn't but requested them again "plain". I did add more flour but I only rolled them into balls and pressed with a glass to flatten slightly.

I found this recipe useful.  It took a bit more work than i had expected but a good cook/baker always knows how to fix something this is not going his/her way.  I wouldn't bother chilling it because you can chill the thing for a year and it's not going to get any more workable for you.  I found that the key to making this thing turn out right was tons and tons of flour.  Once you have your dough ready and your getting ready to roll it out, grab a huge hanful of the dough and a huge handful of flour.  Put the two together and start working them.  Than make it into a ball like your gonna roll a pizza out and throw more flour all over it.  Than flour up your folling pin and start rolling.  In the middle of rolling if the dough starts to stick to your rolling pin, than throw some more flour over the dough and continue to roll.  As long as you have flour on hand you should be safe.  I think next time i will try another recipe but only because i've never made soft sugar cookies before and i'd like to know if it was supposed to be that intense to roll out and cut up.

My whole family loved these cookies. They are big, soft and so delicious. They are well worth the time it takes to make them. Make sure when you make these great cookies you also use the sugar cookie frosting recipe submitted by the same person that submitted this recipe.

I wasted a lot of time and ingredients on these. 
I cut down on the milk so I didn't have to add extra flour, but these cookies had way too much baking soda and baking powder in them. They smelled and tasted like pancakes because of it. I also cut down on the salt to 1/2 tsp.

These weren't as soft as I hoped and could have used more flavor. I ended up putting cinnamon and sugar on the top of each cookie before baking them.

This recipe was ok. I wasn't sure if I wanted to add the milk and vinegar mix, but I did and it made it super runny, so I added almost 2 more cups of flour, which made the cookies really fluffy, almost like cakies. They don't really look or taste like sugar cookies either... Other than that, the cookies really need icing otherwise they are a little boring, probably wouldn't  use that much nutmeg either.

I don't like to write a bad review, but this recipe did not work for us at all.  The consistency was right for making cookies before I added in the milk - which I 'soured' with lemon juice instead of vinegar - but was more like cake batter after.  I also used butter instead of shortening.  After refrigerating for hours, I' dropped' a dozen on a cookie sheet because they would not roll and cut out.  They spread out flat (the butter)and did not cook through in 12 minutes. I gave two stars because the taste had potential.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.  Yes the dough is sticky, but you just need to use alot of flour when rolling them out.  I omitted the nutmeg and we all loved them.

Great cookies! I made my first sugar cookies with this recipe. Yes the dough was hard to work with, but it was worth it. It has been a week and are still soft.

These are great cookies ... not too sweet, "puffy", and perfect for decorating large shapes.  Not too good for detailed work, but one that we come back to often.  Thanks!

This made big soft cookies with a hint of flavour. I decided to use cinnamon instead of nutmeg just due to preferences. These are a bit of hard work but definitely worth it. Will make again.

Never written a review on all recipes.com but I always read them.  I saw many negative reviews on this recipe for the dough consistency.  When you look at the recipe though it is a drop cookie meets a buttermilk biscuit  so I had to give it a try .  With that in mind I used plenty of flour like I would for biscuits probably one and a half to 2 cups more while kneading it and  Rolling it out. Make sure to keep it thick like the recipes says 1/2 Inch. I decreased the salt and the Nutmeg  to half of what it said other than that I followed it exactly  and it was wonderful.  not a traditional American sugar cookie but it had almost an  Old world taste.

This recipe was alright. Even after refridgerating the dough for several hours it was way too soft and sticky to work with for rolling and cutting out the cookies. I had to knead in a LOT of extra flour to get it a good consistency to work with. Other than that it's a pretty good recipe.
