this is officially my new favorite recipe! i did make a few changes to improve it slightly in my book. i used extra crispy tater tots (instead of regular tots), used fat free knudsens brand sour cream and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. i used sharp cheddar 
and doubled the recommended amount (i love cheese!). i also bought the larger can of french fried onions and mixed 1/2 in with the soup, sc, and cheese mixture. once the mixture is spread over the tots, i sprinkled with garlic powder and finished it off with the last of the ff onions. super easy and heats up great for leftovers! yummmm....

This will replace my tater-tot casserole recipe after adding a few things to the original recipe.  Since it's not a main dish in this household if there's no meat, I added a pound of hambuger browned with some onions.  I mixed in a can of green beans, cut the sour cream in half, and added some garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  I also used 2 cups of sharp cheddar instead of just one.  I was a little skeptical of putting the tater-tots on the bottom, but they crisped up nicely.  My friend and her mom who were over for dinner couldn't stop eating it!  Yum!

Very easy, and surprisingly good.
When I put a layer of frozen tater tots on the bottom of the pan, and this gloopy mess that was supposed to turn into "sauce" on the top, I had my doubts.  I wasn't sure it would really turn into a casserole.  But it came out great.  Tasty, very filling, and it makes a LOT.  Would be a great dish for feeding a large group.
I followed the recipe, but added an extra cup of cheese to the sauce mixture. I used non-fat sour cream. I also added some chopped red bell pepper, some cooked and chopped up sausage, (veggie sausage that is - 1 pkg MorningStar Farms brand veggie sausage patties,)and one bag frozen broccoli florets.
I was very good, and the FF onions, (which I almost omitted, since they don't seem much like a real food item to me) actually add some great texture and flavor.

This casserole if a family favorite! I add a can of peas, a small onion, and 1 pound of cooked hamburger and use a little more sour cream and a little milk so it's not so thick. FABOULOUS! I make it a couple times a month by request

NOTE: My rating is based on the modifications I made as follows:

1) I didn't have the fried onions so I used about a cup of raw onion diced and added it to the sour cream/soup/cheese mixture.

2) I ended up almost doubling the cheese and put some of it on top of the casserole before baking it.

3) I let it bake an extra 20 minutes

This recipe was better tasting to me than the traditional cheesey potatoes we make using southern style hash browns.  I was surprised at this and at how the tater tots break apart into smaller pieces so that the cheese/soup/sour cream mixture blends in throughout the casserole.

VERY teenage friendly!  I used cream of chicken soup instead and it was awesome!!  My husband & I liked it but it was my 3 teens that gobbled this down.  The ONLY problem I had was not "oiling" my casserole dish down as suggested and I used Pam spray instead.  Next time I'll use cooking oil.

Super easy & surprisingly very good!  The tator tots/rounds crisp up nicely & the sauce is very creamy.  I would definitely double the amount of cheese though!

This recipe was very good. I used half the sour cream, and added red peppers and chopped broccoli.

My husband loved it and requested it again.

The ultimate in comfort food! This dish brings me back to my childhood...even my college sorority cook made this. This version is definitely better. After finding this recipe and making this many, many times now, I make the following changes: brown a pound of 93/7 hamburger, seasoned with garlic powder, pepper, and half an onion; no grease to drain! I brown an entire bag of crispy crowns instead of regular tots. I layer the hamburger meat over the crispy crowns, then spread the soup mixture, which incorporates the top reviewer's suggestion to add more sharp cheddar than called for, some French fried onions, and I also season the mixture with additional spices to my liking (garlic & onion powders, a little paprika and pepper). I also use the Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup and the entire 16 oz container of sour cream. It's thick and creamy and using the back of a spoon, it spreads easier than you think. So what if the hamburger is mixed in? Top that with some additional cheese and bake 35-40 minutes at 350. 1-2 minutes before it's done, I sprinkle a few more French fried onions on the top and turn the oven to broil. After taking it out, let it sit for 10 minutes. Perfection! Now, if only my husband would let me add some green beans to the mix....

My kids will actually eat this, and my husband likes to fry up the leftovers the next morning with a few eggs. It sounds strange, but it is delicious as well.

What a great base to use as a quick meal. I changed it up to meet my needs, but found it to be quite helpful. I added a lb of ground beef (cooked) and added string beans. I used only 8oz of sour cream and used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery. I used 2 cups of shredded cheese and put the tater tots on the bottom and on top. (loved how the tots at the bottom form a hashbrown type layer and the top ones kept their form and crisped up a bit) The possibilities are endless and fool proof. I so can see this as being something I will use again and again with different vegetables and protein. Thanks for posting:)

This is probably the stupidest question...I'm a new cook ;) Do we cook the tots FIRST before placing them in the dish? Or do you place them in the dish just thawed and uncooked?

My kids loved this.  I added a little milk to thin out the topping and I crushed a few sour cream and onion potato chips on the top.  I think you could add chicken and brocolli to it also and make a more complete meal

Alrighty so I loved this recipe! I made this for my family. It was quick and easy to assemble! I made a change of my own. I added a pound of hamburger meat. I browned my meat and added garlic salt and pepper to taste. Then set asside. I put my tater tots in the bottom of my pan. Added mushroom soup mixure then put my hamburger meat. sprinkled a little of the onions over. then put more of the soup mix then onions and then topped off with tatertots!:) It came out delicious!:) I recommend this to anyone who has kids, can be assembled in the day time then pop it in the oven after kids are out of school or when ever!   Enjoy!*:]

My family LOVED it! It was a little salty, but I will adjust next time with a little more sour cream. Such a warm comfort food. We opted out of the french fried onions- not a kid friendly food, and Im glad i did since it was salty. Actually going to make this for our "after" thanksgiving dinner, dinner. :)  Thank you KPETERS74!!

My husband prefers tatertots crispy on top but I think this is great.  I added ground beef cooked in onion.  This is easy to make.  I actually just added all the ingreedients into the pan with the meat/onion and then poured over tots.

I made it for a potluck for work. I thought it was ok, my co-workers seemed to like it a lot more than I did. I followed the directions but the sauce mixture sat on top of the tots so I had to mix it together and rebake. I also thought it was a little bland....

I had my 12 year old put  this meal together and put it in the oven before we got home.  The outcome was delicious, however not the healthiest meal in the world!  Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll add 1/4C of milk to the soup/sour cream (to start) because the soup/sour cream mixture was quite thick and, once it started cooling down on the table, it started to congeal.  My husband LOVED this which is weird b/c he doesn't "love" any food and in particular he's not much of a sour cream fan (he had no idea there was sour cream in this dish).  I served w/a fried swiss chard & spinach mixture and I'm glad I did because all the richness needed a counterpoint.  A salad would be good to serve with this also... this would also be a good side (except it makes a LOT) to a (healthy) meal.  Very good!

This was a great base casserole recipe! My husband was wanting a tater tot casserole that his mom used to make and this seemed to be close. The only thing that I added a pound of ground beef, browned and drained. Then I mixed everything together and put it into the casserole, rather than putting the tater tots in first and everything on top of it. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe! :)

wow wow! what a great recipe, I've made it exactly how the recipe called but did add a handful of potato chips to the top along with the fried onions, 1 of the best dishes I have ever made and it was a hit with everybody including a picky teenager.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe in my recipe box and making it again.  definitely a 5 star recipe

This was great!  I've had it at Church and this was better.  I did use 2 cups of cheese, about 10 oz of sour cream.  I don't eat onion, so that means neither does anyone I cook for.  So on top, I cut up tater tots and cooked them on top.  About 5 mins before removing from the oven, I spinkled cheese on top for looks.  Thanks for sharing!

You can't go wrong with tater tots.  This recipe made it legal to be the main dish.  Loved it.

I have been cutting back on eating meat and this recipe was a perfect non-meat recipe. My kids loved it. My daughter said it was the best thing she had ever eaten.  It was rich, but comfort food at its best.

This is a fast & delicious recipe that we really enjoyed.  Only change would be to add the french fried onions at the end, about 15 minutes before finished, as mine started to burn & I had to cover the dish with foil. I added a pound of sauteed hamburger & a chopped onion to make this a main dish.  I will definitely make this again. It would be great to double or triple the amount for a large party.  So good!

With a little bit of ground beef, this dish is great. My boyfriend and best friend devoured it! The best part is that it is extremely filling so one serving goes a long way. Will use again- such a different, yummy recipe!

This was a great side at our cookout.  I didn't have the French-fried onions, so I didn't mix the cheese in with the other ingredients but used it as a topping.  I also didn't use the whole 16 oz of sour cream...probably more like 8 oz.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

Like alot of other reviewers on here, I added a layer of hamburger meat.  To give some added flavor, I added an envelope of Lipton's Onion Soup Mix to my hamburger meat as it was cooking and it turned out delicious!!!!!

This turned out great. I too added a few things to the mix. I cooked up a pound of hamburger with a little bit of diced onion. I also upped the cheese to 2 cups and added some frozen peas to the sace mixture. I was going to use cheese flavored French-fried onions, but the store that I go to only carrys them during the holidays. Will try them the next time. My husband loved it. It is definetely a keeper recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

Very good. I added 1 lb. chopped meat, 3/4 tsp. garlic salt & half a diced onion to the bottom of the pan without greasing. I think next time I will use only 1/2 the sour cream & add a little milk to thin out the sauce. I will also use more cheese, maybe another cup to the top before adding the French-fried onions. Very good basic recipe that I will make again.*****edited to 5 stars from 4 with these changes****I put the browned chopped meat w/1/4 small sauteed onion & garlic salt on top of tater tots in greased casserole dish. I used only 1/2 the sour cream (8 oz) and added an additional cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese to the top before adding French fried onions and baking. With these small changes, this was definitely a 5 star recipe. My family devoured this!

Super good!  I did add hamburger/onion/corn to the mix.  LOVE the french fried onions on top.  Although my husband said he preferred my standard tater tot casserole.  I will be definitely making this one again!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great base recipe for Tater Tot Casserole. The first time I made it as it is written, and it was a solid four stars. With some tweaking for taste, however, it quickly becomes five stars. It can be a bit heavy on the sour cream, so I either add more cheese or reduce the amount to only 8 oz. Both worked well, but I preferred more cheese because I'm a huge fan of cheese. I have added a pound of cooked hamburger, browned with the onions and other seasonings, and this gives the recipe a good balance. So I recommend trying it and playing with it to get it to suit your families tastes. Thanks for submitting this, KPeters74!

I love Tater Tot Casserole! I made this without the onions and it was a huge hit. The picky 8 year old ate two plates! So easy to make. I did put some of the soup and sour cream in the bottom so its smooth all the way through and then put the cheese on the top. Baked it with foil for 45 minutes then without for 15. Sooo good!

I made this for a group while we were on vacation.  Everyone loved it! You could add cooked sausage or bacon if you wanted it to be a complete breakfast casserole.  I made it as listed with the addition of a little more cheddar cheese and I used the seasoned tater tots.  You could spice it up really easiely.  I am going to make it for a cook out next time.  Thanks for sharing.  This one is a keeper!

Loved it! And the only thing I changed was that I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom (that was all I had and I figured ... what the heck?). Great recipe and my DH even said it was fantastic!

This recipe is one of my favorites, albeit a guilty one. I use double the cheese and half the sour cream, and I add half the onions to the sour cream mix and sprinkle the other half on top at the last 15 minutes of cooking. The taste is fantastic, the texture is great, and it even reheats well (mushy but yummy). Try it once and you'll be hooked!

This recipe is excellent. I have made it a few times and keep coming back to it. As written and tweaked, this recipe is excellent. You can add or subtract for taste which makes it a versatile yummy recipe. The left overs if any are always eaten. Most recently I added ground turkey browned with onion and then extra green onions and real bacon bits. So yummy! Thanks for sharing this gem!

My family really enjoys this simple comfort food. Easy to put together on a weeknight. Can be a little greasy, but reheats well.

Very tasty, in a heavy comfort food sort of way. I used 98% fat free cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and left off the fried onions since I'm not a huge fan. I used fat free sour cream, but I agree that the recipe called for too much. Next time I would use about 3/4 of the package. Even using the low fat ingredients, this was tasty. I also added about 1/3 cup of salsa just to give it a little spice. Overall, a very easy dish. It would also be good with hamburger mixed in.

This wasn't bad, but I would make some changes next time. I think I'd cut down on the sour cream and increase the soup if needed. I love sour cream, but it was a bit too much in this. I also omitted the onions on top and just sprinkled more cheese.

This is absolutely the easiest, quickest dish I have ever made.  I would say prep time is more like 3 minutes!  I made it for a party I was having and it was delicious, everyone loved it.  Would also be good served w/breakfast.

Changes I made were sauteing fresh mushrooms in a combination of olive oil and butter, adding about 2 TBS of flour to the mixture once the mushrooms were brown and adding milk until thick. As for the rest of the recipe I followed to the letter, The whole family loved it eve my picky eater.

my family loved this twist on a old favorite. The only things I did different was I browned a pound of hamburger with a little chopped onion before mixing in the soup,sour cream and cheese. After putting the mixture on top of the tater tots, I sprinkled more cheese on top and then the French fried onions. I will definitely be making this recipe again. This recipe has replaced my old tater tot casserole recipe for sure ! loved it !

We added boca burger to this dish. We also substituted plain Greek yogurt for sour cream. We did not have fried onions either but it tastes great with sautéed yellow cooking onions. Will make this again!

This is my basic tater tot casserole recipe.  I switch it up by adding ground turkey, ground beef or today, ground hot pork sausage.  I replace the sour cream and soup with French onion dip.

How my husband made it through a 1970s childhood without trying this dish is beyond me!  I just made him his first Tater Tot Casserole yesterday, using this recipe.   I lined the dish with parchment paper, then warmed half the tater tots and smashed them in the bottom of the casserole dish to make a solid potato layer.  I added a pound of already browned meat and onions, then a cup of cheese, a sprinkling of the French Fried onions, then the cream sauce.  I topped the cream sauce with the remaining tots, the rest of the shredded cheese, and some more French Fried onions.  He LOVED it.  Thanks for the great improvements on what was always a childhood favorite of mine!

I made this last night. Used cream of celery though. Put kielbasa chunks in and mixed veggies. Like others I put twice the cheese. My picky eater gobbled this up, veggies and all. Would actually double by putting another layer of food,tater tots,veggies ,kielbasa, seasonings,sour cream/soup mixture next time. My husband wanted leftovers of this.:) This seems like a great dish to take to a potluck.

I followed the other reviews and added an extra cup of cheese and ground beef to make it a meal. I mixed the browned and spiced up ground beef with the soup, cheese and sour cream and topped it with a little extra cheese before putting the French fried onions on. It was a big hit. Everyone licked their plates clean. Thanks for this recipe!

I added cooked ground turkey sausage to the recipe and towards the end of cooking I topped it with the french fried onions and covered the top with shredded cheddar cheese. This one of my most favorite recipes! It's so delicious!

I made this for my sister's baby shower ("Tot" casserole!) and it was a hit! It was all gone between only 7 people. I baked it in a stoneware dish for the full hour and it was just right. Next time I'm going to try adding ground beef or chilli and having it as a meal through the week...Not the healthiest, but it is really good!!

My family and I LOVED it, esp my kids!  I used sharp cheddar instead and doubled it (doubling it is necessary).  I also mixed in half the FF Onions with the mix before spreading it on top, then poured the rest on top of the whole mix (along with some garlic powder) to top it off.  Last but not least, I diced up some onion and mixed it in as well.  AMAZING!  The leftovers are even better :)

This was SO GOOD.  Kids weren't too thrilled when they heard what we were having for dinner, but they did a complete 180 once they tried it.  I followed the recipe, but wanted to turn it into more of a meal, so I added a pound of ground beef (browned it and sprinkled it on top) and mixed in a can of green beans with the soup, sour cream, and cheese.  Came out fantastic, I think my kids will be asking for this one regularly.

If you are looking for comfort food this is the jackpot! The recipe was simple so I picked it out for a night my boyfriend was going to be cooking. It turned out great! We both really liked it the first and second time around. Many have reviewed with changes they have made. It is one of those recipes that you could really add just about anything you like to and it would still taste great!

I made the 8x8" version of this (3 serving calculation).  It was perfect with no changes.  We did not find the sour cream overpowering.  We did not find the cheese lacking.  I did add 1/2 pound of ground beef to the recipe.  This took about 55 mins to cook, I might try another reviewers suggestion of cooking for 35 mins at 425 next time.  SO GOOD.

Okay, I DID like this recipe, but I will follow it 100% next time, even if I only use it as a side dish.  I tried to make it a main meal as some others have suggested.  I browned 1lb of beef with some onion and added more cheese.  The flavor was great, but the tots fell apart and the consitancy was closer to something like rice.  Again, this was my own fault for not following the recipe that I see would yeild crispy tots next time.

This was the first tater tot casserole recipe I've ever tried and it was a hit!   The only change I made was adding a layer of browned ground beef (1 lb) at the bottom, topped with an additional 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese. From there, I followed the recipe closely and it came out great!  The next time I make it, I'll probably add in a green vegetable layer. I was thinking peas, green beans, or even asparagus.

This recipe was so easy and was a huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner this year!  The only thing I did differently is I added 1 cup extra cheddar cheese and I used Cheddar French-Friend onions.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Made it exactly as written and it was fabulous. It will replace our hashbrown casserole going forward.  I'll try putting some of the fried onions in the sauce as well as topping the casserole with them as another reviewer suggested.

Yum yum yum. This was absolutely delicious. I did make a couple changes out of necessity. I only had cream of celery, not cream of mushroom soup and I didn't have any french fried onions.  Also, like a couple other reviewers I added 1lb of ground turkey which I added a diced onion too while cooking. This is a great "base recipe", and deliciously homey :)

This was suprisingly excellent considering its simplicity!  We loved it.  I did add some ground beef to make it more of a main dish, but otherwise made exactly as written. You really don't need to change a thing.  We'll be making this one again!

I love this recipe.  I usually put the tator tots on top instead of the bottom, and add the onions to the top about 5 minutes before I take it out of the oven.  I also usually throw in a few extra spices (garlic powder, red pepper flake, basil) and use the half the cheese in the sauce as suggested by another review.  Delicious!

I made this tonight with a few changes based on suggestions from other reviewers: 1) I browned ground beef with a diced onion and layered this over the tater tots 2) In the soup mixture, I added a can of french cut green beans, halved the sour cream to 8 oz (and glad I did! There was still a pretty distinct sour cream taste so I can imagine if i'd used the whole 16 oz), used 2 cups instead of 1 of shredded cheese and mixed in half a big can of ff onions 3) in the last 10 mins, put the other half of the ff onions over the top. Also, I baked for 35 mins at 425 bc I wanted to make sure the tater tots stayed crispy and it was perfect. The casserole was really tasty and filling! My boyfriend agreed. Loved the crunch of the ff onions. I wish I could taste the crm of mushroom more than the sc but that wasn't a huge issue. I'll be making this again!

I went with some of the above ideas and added a lb of lean ground turkey.. I mixed it with the soup and sour cream (I used Tofutti dairy free sour cream, susbsituted cream of chicken soup and left out the cheese). I pour the meat/soup/sour cream mix, topped with taters, added s &p on 1/2 I added smoked cheddar, chili power and chives! It was a Hit!

My husband LOVED this.  I would give it a five star rating for that alone (he's picky), but I thought the recipe as written, putting all tots on the bottom and then sauce on top, was less than desirable in the end.  The tots at the bottom of the dish got no "love" from the above sauce that stayed put on the top, so they were very bland.  However, I will try this recipe again, using frozen hash browns instead of tots and then MIXING the gooey mixture with the potatoes before cooking.

I made this last night for a birthday cookout. I am currently living in Germany, so my ingredients may have differed slightly (had to use a make package of cream mushroom soup instead of the usual can of cream of soups that are found easily in the US.. and instead of French Fried Onions, I used crushed up "Onion Ring" chips). This was the one thing out of everything that was brought that was COMPLETELY gone at the end of the night. Hence why I gave it a 5 star rating.  I was afraid it might be bland from what I had read, so I added salt/pepper and some Garlic Salt to the mix. Turned out great. The only bad thing I would say is that it turned out to be on the mushy side--similar to mashed potatoes. Still really good, but I would have like my tots to have maintained their crispiness, which I am sure is hard to do with the liquid mix that goes on top. Oh well. Still really tasty and I would make this again.

This dish was a decadent crowd pleaser, but I do need to offer a few words of caution.  When it says it serves 6, they must mean 6 people who havent eaten in days or who just swam hundreds of laps!  In anticipation of the 40 or so people at the potluck I made it for I doubled the recipe. Big mistake- it weighed about 10 pounds, was loved by all, and about half of it remains!  I'd say this recipe serves at least 10 as a main course and up to 20 as a side.

This is dangerous and amazing. Dangerous because it's pretty unhealthy, but that will not stop me from eating it. Definitely worth the calories. I made it exactly as stated, but threw in a bag of frozen broccoli. Simply amazing.

Very good, but very rich!  I added 1/2 of bacon and that made it a bit too salty.  It seemed like it needed some broccoli or something to lighten it up.  However, pretty cheap and super yummy overall!

Delicious! The sour cream made this dish, so don't leave it out if your thinking about it. I added hamburger to mine as my husband doesn't consider it a meal if there's no meat:) I've made this several times and used low fat ingredients verse full fat ingredients & you can't tell the difference. So if you're dieting this is a good casserole for substituting as well.

My husband wanted me to make this and he really enjoyed it.  I didn't care for it much, but just because I'm not a huge fan of tater tots.  I added 1 lb of seasoned ground beef, and put it on top of the tots.  Easy, and inexpensive.  4 stars because hubby devoured it :)

I used hash browns instead of tater tots and I couldn't find french fried onions at my grocery store so I just chopped some onions and put them on top. I couldn't even taste the soup which is good because I hate mushrooms. My kids DEVOURED this for breakfast with some ketchup!

This recipe is ok.  You really have to be careful with the taters or they will not be crispy enough.

This was an excellent recipe!  Instead of the usual tater tots, I used the smaller coin sized tater tots.  I also added a pound of ground turkey like others suggested.

I LOVED this recipe!  I didn't use the french onions b/c I couldn't find them in the store.  So I used shredded cheese instead as the topping.  I also only used 1/2 a container of sour cream.  I took the dish to work for a party and it was devoured in less than 10 minutes!  They were scraping the dish and everyone was commenting on how awesome it was and asking for the recipe!  It was such a hit, I'm actually taking it this Sunday for our Easter dinner!  :)  YUMMM!

My family LOVED this recipe and my husband added it to his all time favorite side dish! I served it as a side dish and I followed the recipe closely only adding more cheese, a little garlic powder, and bacon bits to the mixture. The results were wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe...my family loved it. I added cooked ground beef on top of the potatoes and extra cheese on the top of the soup mix because I didn't have the ff onions. I also cooked it at 425 for about 40 min.  yummmyyy I will make again.

I tried this recipe with cream of chicken soup, and half of the french fried onions mixed into the sour cream/cheese/soup topping. (Like another reviewer suggested.) It was pretty good! I think I will try it with the cream of mushroom soup next time. My father enjoyed it immensely, and asked for me to make it again in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

I actually find myself craving this.  I made it as written and it was a little bland, so I usually add a little garlic powder or Tony Chachere to the sour cream mix before I spread it on top of the tater tots.  Strangely, it's fantastic with some garlic chili sauce (the one that's kind of like sriracha, but w/ visible chili seeds in it).

My three picky eaters loved this casserole! I liked the quick prep.

I added about a cup of chopped rottiserie chicken breast that I had on hand and a cup of frozen green beans. Like other reviewers, I added about a half cup more cheese.

So good!  I added just a little garlic powder to the mix and used an extra 1/2 cup of cheese.  There was a little too much sauce for my taste, I think the sour cream should be reduced by about a cup.

Well I followed the recipe the only change I made was to reduce sour cream per other reviews. I was glad I did. This tasted like sourcream and onion chips. Will not make again

I forgot that I didn't like sour cream much before I made this, so it wasn't my cup of tea. But my boyfried really liked it, He said it could have been better if the tater tots were some how crunchy (maybe cooked on top) instead of squishy.

I put less sour cream in it as well due to all of the other reviews.  I wish there were more than 5 stars!! Overall, this receipe was absolutely FANTASTIC.  My husband went back for fourths!!  I had my doubts with the sour cream, but it was absolutely delicious and reheated up very nicely.

Was looking for something different and this fit the bill. I used fat free sour cream, lowfat cheese and healthy request mushroom soup. I omitted the french fried onions (kids dont like), but added freeze dried onions to mixture. (kids cant see) :)

Easy, easy, easy. This was good. I cut the sour cream down to  1 1/4 C due to people's comments. I used cream of onion soup instead of cream of mushroom since we don't like mushrooms. I added   1 lb. of cooked ground beef over the tator tots then topped it with the sour cream mixture. I took it out at 45 mins because the onions on top were starting to burn. It really could have used more time since parts of it were cold. I would say add the fried onions halfway. This was so simple to make. Thanks Karin.

a good base recipe.  Here's an idea for kicking up the recipe, to keep it from being bland:  Instead of sour cream and cheese, put in a jar of (Tostito's brand) Salsa Con Queso, Medium spicy.  My husband thought that made it really good.  I didn't have but 26 oz of frozen tater tots, so 1 jar was plenty when mixed with 1 can cream of mushroom soup.

This was very easy to make and very good.  I added a little bit of garlic powder and season salt to the sour cream mixture and did not use all of the onions.  I took it to a tailgate party and it was gone it minutes.  Very good and I will definitely make this again.

It was ok. I think the sour cream and the friend onions made it. Although it did taste better reheated. Clever idea, I must say...to use tater tots, makes it nice and easy.

Everyone in the house loved this dish. Instead of using french fried onions, half way through I put more tater tots on top.  I've also tried it using french cut green beans, that wasn't bad.  I put way more cheese in than asked but thats because we love cheese.

Sorry, but we didn't like this at all. There was to much sour cream and the sauce sat on top of the tator tots. The tator tots were not crispy as we like them.  I won't be making this again.

My husband and my two toddlers absolutely loved this casserole. I believe my husband even had three helpings.

I added extra cheese on top before the fried onions because we love cheese. I also added in frozen broccoli for some veggies. This was so good with ketchup (in my house we love ketchup too). 

It is extremely rich and heavy but so good. I would pair it with a salad or steamed veggies or even some grilled chicken.

When I make it again, which I will, instead of just pouring the mixture on top, I will mix it into the tater tots because some of the bottom ones weren’t smothered.

love this recipe! I went from never having it before to eating it 2x in the last month. we add a 1 lb cooked ground beef to throw in some protein since it's the main dish. and we aren't big sour cream people, so I substitute it for milk and it works great.

Loved it and so did others! Just added another cup of  cheese, and half of the French onions with about 1/4 water to the mixture. Then sprinkled the remaining onion an ontop and a little more cheese. Super fast and easy! Great comfort food!

Made it! However, I added chili with no beans and chopped up white onion to the mixture and added chopped up chives to the top. Another time I cooked this dish, I used broccoli and cheese tater tots (check out your local health food store) and cream of broccoli instead of mushroom.

I made this exactly as directed in the recipe. While it is good, it does seem to need something extra. I think that this could be a 5 star recipe just by adding an ingredient of personal preference as many other reviewers have done.  I’ll try adding beans and or cheese next time. I also will wait to sprinkle the onion on top until the last 15 minutes of cooking to prevent over browning.  I will make this again with a few modifications. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I only made one change... I substituted plain Greek yogurt for about half of the sour cream. Their consistency is so similar and the yogurt adds protein. It was fantastic!  And so easy to put together! Next time I plan to bake at 400 instead of 350. I thought it cooled down very quickly.

This was stellar.  The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that there was some modifications required.  First off:  Brown a pound of burger with some onions.  I used a third of a red onion and that was enough.  Double the cheese in the mix in the bowl.  I used probably 2/3 of the recommended amount of sour cream.  Use more or less.  Either way will be fine.

Drop the burger in the bowl and stir.  Add 1/2 the french fried onions when done mixing the burger in the bowl.  Spoon and spread the mix in the pan and cover the tots.  Spread the remaining FF onions over the top.  Sixty minutes plus 10 was required at 350.  Make this.  You will not regret it!

I liked this as a base and added more cheese than it suggested just because we like lots of cheese. I do think I would look to add some other things to it in the future, maybe mushrooms or peppers, maybe some additional spices. It was easy and we enjoyed it.

I will definitely make this again! I followed the original directions, except I added a pound of deer burger. I cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes and it turned out great. My husband had 2 bowls for dinner and he's kinda picky :-D

This is a keeper! Thank you for sharing this recipe. Made tonight. My teens loved it! The only change I made was adding an extra cup of cheese. Yes, we are cheese heads. l think this will be a wonderful casserole to take to family functions. Again, thank you!

This recipe was a good idea to start with since I was looking for a recipe to use my homemade hashbrowns  which I had alot of. I'm usually not one to make alot of substitutions because then it becomes another recipe?  But I did, and it turned out great! The only ingredient I didn't change because I had on hand was the cheddar cheese. My subs were, Greek yogurt for the sour cream, cream of chicken for the mushroom, homemade caramelized onions for the French fried onions,  and French's crispy jalapeños just because.
It was delicious and I intend to make the original next time! Thanks for the idea!

I found this to be bland and flavorless.  It was gloppy and tots were mushy.  It was horrible.  I followed the directions but added a dash of garlic powder.  Nothing could help this dish.  Cannot understand the great reviews.

I made the recipe as written.  It was very good and similar to a recipe that I make with hash browns so I thought I would be good.  I would make it again.  I made it on National Tator Tot Day!

This is one of my favorite “I don’t wanna cook” recipes to make.  It’s so easy to make it takes about two minutes to prep. After some attempts I swapped out the cream of mushroom for a good, buttermilk-based ranch (Ocharleys or litehouse) and added a layer of American Cheese over the top (before adding the onions).  I feel like there is a lot you could do to this (bacon, broccoli, shredded chicken or beef) but it’s perfectly great as is.  This doubles as a good family comfort meal or the office/church potluck hit.

I have made this many times since discovering the recipe. It is great as is but usually I add or substitute a few things. I use onion flavored tater tots for a little extra oomph to the dish. For the cream of mushroom soup I have used cream of chicken, celery or onion on occasion. They all tasted fantastic! I also add a can of french sliced green beans (drained) to the sauce mix. It lets me imagine that its a little bit healthier and the flavors go well together! I also add a tiny bit of milk to thin the sauce out just a bit so it can get inbetween all the tater tots and not sit on top of them. Overall an awesome recipe!

I swapped regular onions for crunchy onions.  So when it cooked, it was extra delicious and the onions soften also and have tons of flavor.

Loved it.  I didn't thin we would like it as much as we did.  Used it as a side for vegetarian sloppy joes.  There was a lot left over but it didn't last long.  Followed the recipe to the T except added a little more cheese.

Great flavor.  If making for kids leave off the onions...they think it's a suspicious smell.  Just toss some cheese on top.  But the adults loved it.

It was good, but not satisfying. Personally, I think it needed salt, pepper and garlic powder.  my son liked it a lot.  I also think the sauce to potato ratio is a bit large, so maybe cut down on the sour cream and calories at the same time. I think I would make it again if I had the ingredients, but probably would have to improvise a little

This is one of my most favorite recipes! Especially perfect for those freezing cold nights like tonight but anytime is a good time for it. I do add a pound of browned ground beef and that turns it into a meal. Also, I double the soup needed but leave everything else the same. It's so easy and delicious.

Cream of chicken solves all the problems with taste.  It is easy and a good comfort type food.  High fat and calories!  Yum when you need it!!!

If you read a previous review under my "name"? That wasn't me. I have no idea how that got there. Anyway, I did really like this dish. Although, I'm not a fan of sour cream. So, next time I will use less. I did use a double batch of "Mexican" mix shredded cheese. I don't think it would make all that much of a difference in the taste. Many reviews have said to/and have used double the amount;but I would go as far as using triple amount with the last "cup" spread over the top.

Yummy! Took to a potluck and it was a huge hit! I replaced the mushroom soup with cream of chicken and the cheddar with Colby/Monterey Jack. Next time I am going to top it with bacon pieces:) Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very hearty, filling comfort food.  I used low-fat sour cream and added a bag of frozen mixed veggies and it turned out good.  Next time I'll use half the sour cream, or just cut sour cream altogether and use two cans of soup and a splash of milk.  I'll also mix in half the fried onions with the soup and veg.

This is so good! I reduced the sour cream to 12 oz, increased the cheese to 1 1/2 cups (colby jack that I chopped up), added a can of corn, and sprinkled garlic powder on top. Yum!

I usually don't like potatoes that are made this way, but there is something about this recipe that I really liked.  It will be my recipe to use when I make this type of potato again.

We love this recipe here!! I followed suggestions of some of the PPs and added a lb of ground beef and a dash of garlic powder. I also added a dash of pepper and used about 1.5 cups of cheese. Excellent!! Will definitely be one of our new regulars.

The only thing I did diffrent is add the French-fried onions on at the end, maybe 10 minutes before it was done.
I also added some frozen veggies, peas, green beans.

Yum! This was easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, I think I will sprinkle some bacon bits on top. It reminded me of a loaded baked potato. I served it with a salad and nobody missed meat.

The sour cream mixture just sits on top of the tater tots.  It never melts down or incorporates.  Also, it's very heavy and just.... not very good at all.

This is a great recipe with the following modifications: 1. I also used an extra cup of Sharp Cheddar Cheese. 2. I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of the mushroom soup. 3. I added some shredded rotisserie chicken to the soup mixture (we need meat in order to call it a meal) along with a medium onion diced. 4. I didn't have French-fried onions, so I crumbled cheezits and sprinkled them on top after it had already baked for 25 minutes. ENJOY!

Very unsophisticated, but very very tasty. Easy to whip up after a long day and pleases even the picky ones (which would actually be me). A tad bit salty, though, so no need to add any. Yummy.

Very quick meal to prepare, would be ideal for a babysitter or a freezer meal because it's so simple to put together and toss in the oven.  I thought it tasted ok, but was wayyyyy too salty for my tastes.  If I could figure out a way to lower the salt, it would be perfect.  My husband loved this though, so we'll keep it for nights I'm out of town.

I'm only giving this 3 stars, I thought it had to much of a sour cream taste. I didnt really like it but my wife did.  I put a 6 oz cup of pop corn chicken in it and put cheese on top. I'm going to make it one more time, and this time make a few more changes with some different spices.

YUM! I needed a super cheap dinner idea for my family on a tight tight budget - and this one popped up. My husband and 4 year old daughter devoured it, and the hubby had thirds, and brought some for lunch today! The only thing I did differently was used 2 cans of mushroom soup, and added another 1/4 cup of sour cream. We like extra creamy - and this did the trick. I'd also recommend getting seasoned tater tots - it adds a kick of flavor! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very good recipe.  I didn't have french fried onions so I used corn flakes.  I also added some dried mustard and sprinkled onion powder and celery salt on top of the corn flakes. I was very happy with it and my husband loved it.

This was wonderful - my whole family loved it (even the one who doesn't usually like things with sour cream : ).  I only had a few fried onions to put on top - but it would have been even better if I had put plenty more on top.  This is def replacing my old tater tot casserole recipe!  I actually doubled the sr.cream/soup/cheese but with the same amount of tater tots - fabulous!

This casserole was very easy to put together and tasted pretty good.  My husband and sons ate it up.  Very rich and filling, which makes it a perfect comfort food.  I added ground beef and corn to the soup/sour cream mixture along with a splash of milk (I did this to make it a one dish dinner).  I will make this again.

I made this recipe as stated, and did not care for it. It had the tendency to be a really good recipe but all of the sour cream ruined it. No one in family liked it.  Just made again tonight with just a few table spoons of sour cream and it turned out great.  Also used ground beef.  So I would suggest to cut down the sour cream!

I liked it, I don't suggest adding any garlic.  I added some fresh garlic, not much, and it was too strong.  I also added some green beans and peas.  I can't eat chedder, so I replaced it with Colby, and it was still very good, just too much garlic.   I would cook it for maybe half an hour before adding the onions.  they got too brown on top while the tots were still cold on the bottom. Overall I would make it again.

My rating is based on my modifications. I too, used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. I also doubled the cheese amount, and used half the sour cream. I thought it was delicious!! I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit. I think next time I need to cook it closer to 60 minutes.

Good, but I added four cups of frozen veggies and some soy crumbles, halved the sour cream, and skipped the fried onions. I also accidentally bought the flat tots rather than the cylindrical tots, so I put half on the bottom, then the other ingredients mixed together, and topped with the remaining tots. It also needs salt, pepper, and garlic. But really good with those changes!

My family LOVES this.  I only used the onions on about half, but both sides were very good.  My sister, who pretty much doesn't pay much attention to food unless it has beef, even raved about it.

This recipe is great and served to me as a guide to make my version. I used ground beef on the bottom layer with onion and garlic powder. Then I topped with a cream cheese, cream of chicken, and mozzerella mixture. Then the tator tots on top of that. Last minute, throw on some shredded cheddar and it is sooo good. I put a dollup of sour cream on top when it's ready to eat!

Fair.  The sour cream and mushroom soup were overpowering even after doubling the cheese.  I only had half a bag of onions and it turned out that the bits with the onions were the best part so that may have been part of the issue.

This recipe was delicious. Although I recommend cooking it for about 2 hours at 350 degrees to get the tots nice and crispy. I also added half an onion and tsp of pepper for extra flavor.

This recipe didn't really do it for me and my family.  I followed the recipe exactly... I baked for an hour at 350 degrees and the middle of the casserole was just warm.  This recipe was also lacking in flavor.

I made this tonight, adding a small, eyeballed amount of black pepper, italian seasonings, minced garlic and garlic powder (we LOVE garlic in this household!).  I cut the sour cream in half, as suggested by other reviewers, and added some half & half to thin the sauce up.  After 50 minutes in the oven, the sauce mixture on top was piping hot but the tots on the bottom were still cold, so I had to mash it all up together and pop it back in for another 25 minutes.  Next time I think I will brown them slightly before cooking.  Otherwise, the recipe was a hit!  Very flavorful.

This turned out really well, however I did make some changes.  I added 1 pound of browned ground beef, I used cream of chicken soup with 1/2 the amount of sour cream called for, a splash of milk, 2 cups of cheese instead of one, and I threw in a packet of Onion soup mix.  I think it turned out a tad salty, so next time I make this I will use 1/2 packet of soup mix.  I was the only one who said it was salty, so maybe it was just me.  Kids and husband loved it.  Hard to find something they all eat, so this is nice!

I took this to a neighborhood gathering and let me tell you, it was the only thing that completely disappeared!  More of a comfort food than healthy dish, this one really delivers when it comes to flavor.  I made the recipe as written and will continue to serve this one time and time again.

I am constantly trying meatless versions of my favorite foods so I can introduce them to my vegetarian girlfriend.  Well, she absolutely LOVES this recipe!  I thoroughly enjoyed it as well, but it's just not the same without the ground beef!  It is a very good compromise, though.

I didn't think this dish tasted all that good.  I used Cream of Celery soup, as someone had suggested, and only half the onions.  It tasted like tater tots with sour cream and onions on top; no blended taste.

We loved this! This was part of our make ahead menu for a weekend get-away to the PA mts. Our place has been winterized so no water for dirty dishes. I made this at home along with some crock pot chili.I left the onions off till the last 10 minutes of cooking. It was so good with chili, beleve it or not! Good left-over too! I may try adding browned ground beef and green beans for a one dish meal and doubeling the sauce.

Awesome!!  I have a hashbrown casserole recipe that is similar to this, but this is sooo much easier to make and tastes just as good, maybe better.  Definitely one of my favorite comfort foods.

Reminded me a lot of a baked potatoe except using tater tots. I had no problems with soggyness or anything else I just threw it together baked it for an hour and viola it was perfectly done :) I did add bacon bits on top to give it even more of a baked potatoe type taste and I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom just becasue of personal preference :) very filling and satisfying for me and my husband :)

After reading the reviews I cut down on the sour cream and added a little extra cheese. I added bacon bits to the top (I'm a vegetarian, but the kids are not so bb was the compromise!) I also used minced onion flakes instead of the ff onions b/c that's what I had on hand. I think it would taste better with fresh chopped onions and some veggies too. Overall I liked well enough, and 2 out of 3 kids absolutely loved!

I thought this was pretty good. But my husband loved it. I'm only giving it a 4 b/c it was pretty mushy. Also, my taste buds might have been off when I made it b/c I had a sinus infection. I'll make it again w/ the extra crispy tots!

EXCELLENT MAN AND KID RECIPE!!  BASED ON OTHER SUGGESTIONS (THANX GUYS)- I ADDED A COOKED POUND OF GROUND BEEF WITH A SMALL ONION CHOPPED AND COOKED IN IT TO THE TATOR TOTS- I USED HALF SOUR CREAM AND HALF MAYO- I DOUBLED THE CHEESE- ADDING 1/4 CUP CHEESE OVER THE MEAT AND  TOTS- 1 CUP IN SOURCREAM/ SOUP MIX AND THE OTHER 1/4 CUP ON TOP BEFORE PUTTING ON THE FRIED ONIONS- I ONLY HAD THE SMALL CAN OF ONIONS- NOT THE BIG ONE IT CALLED FOR AND IT WORKED PERFECT- I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE TOO MUCH SINCE I HAD THE X-TRA CHEESE ON TOP-  IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL AND APPETIZING LOOKING CASSEROLE- DEFINITELY A GOOD CASSEROLE FOR KIDS AND HUSBANDS/BOYFRIENDS!!!!!!!!!  OH YEAH- TASTES BETTER NEXT DAY AND DEFINITELY TASTES BETTER IF IT SITS A WHILE AFTER REMOVED FROM OVEN!! I NEEDED TO TEST DRIVE IT COZ I NEED A FAMILY TYPE CASSEROLE FOR A FAMILY REUNION NEXT WEEK- IT IS PERFECT FOR THAT!!!

This recipe needs a few changes. I added a lb of seasoned up hamburger meat, cut the sour cream in half, added a cup or so of cheese, used extra crispy tots, added a small amount of milk, and waited until the last 20 minutes to add the french fried onions to the top. This required about 90 minutes of cooking time for me. The tots just weren't getting done. It needs some garlic powder and onion powder and you could add some veggies to it as well. Good dish. I can't wait to fry some up with some eggs later tonight.

Prepared this for dinner lastnight along with steamed broccoli.
My husband and oldest loved it, but my youngest just picked out the tater tots. 
I used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular, and baked it for only 45min although my husband stated that it could have used another 5min or so.

This was an excellent recipe both my boyfriend and myself loved it. I will deffinently make some changes next time we make it though like I will add broccli and musrooms into it and I will also mix the french fried onions into the soup/cheese/sourcream mix because they were a little burnt by the time the casserole was fully cooked. Overall though it was great and after these tweaks will definently be a keeper!

This was delicious, if not so good for you.  I used leftover spinach dip instead of the sour cream, and skipped the onion topping, just letting the top of the casserole brown up a little at the end.  I also combined the tots with the sauce before pouring it into the baking dish. Be sure to bake it a good hour.  Even though I had let the tots defrost before assembling it, some were barely done after an hour. Wonderful with our leftover Christmas ham and some asparagus.

This a good easy recipe!  I did add a pound of ground turkey in with the mix.  Also, didn't have any fried onions so I just chopped up a fresh onion and cooked it when I browned the meat.  Added a second cup of cheese on top of it towards the end of the baking time.  Tater tots were crunchy and mmm mmm good!

French-fried onions were out of season so I had to make them myself which added to the prep time.  To make your OWN french-fried onions, thinly slice about 3-onions, dip in 1/2 cup milk mixed with 1 egg.  Then dig into gluten-free flour.  Fry in hot oil for about 5 minutes.  Drain on paper-towels.

I also added some sharp cheddar and broccoli.  I still thought it was a bit rich and would cut down on the sour cream next time.  The casserole didn't hold together too well until the next day when re-heated but then the fried-onions weren't as good.  Quite filling!

The flavor was good, but it was too rich for us.  I won't make it again.

This was ok.  Per other reviewers, I used half the sour cream called for.  I would have preferred a little more zing to it.  If I ever make it again, I will probably mix the onions in with the soup mixture.

This recipe was good but I thought it would be creamier.  It came out awfully dry.  I would make again but hubby and kids said "no thanks".

This is a very creamy, cheesy casserole.  I really enjoyed it and it's incredibly easy to make.  Thank you.

So easy to prepare!  Per other reviews, I only used about 1 1/2 cups of sour cream.  I served for dinner with a side of green beans and it was satisfying.  I plan on making for a MOPS side dish for breakfast.

It was a delicious quick and easy meal. I added 1 lb of ground turkey and green beans to make it an all in one dinner.

The flavors are ok, but my dish was dry---I expected it to be moist and somewhat saucy, but the soup, sour cream and cheese just "sat" on top of my tater tots....and I used full-fat ingredients, too.  This also does not re-heat well for a possible second-day appearance on the table.

I absolutely LOVE this dish.  I'm the only person in the house and leftovers usually get thrown away but I ate all of this over several days.  I even took it to work and it reheated really well in the microwave.  I am definitely going to make it again and try some of the variations that others came up with.

I think this recipe is great---and it's mainly because it is so easy to prepare.  Just throw everything in the pan and bake.  I think there is way too much sour cream in it though, so I decided to substitute extra mushroom soup for half the sour cream.  I also might try adding a veggie like peas or green beans next time!  Very yummy!

The results were just what I expected, unoffensive, reliable, tasty, traditional.  My husband loved it.  The only problem (and this explains the 4 stars instead of 5) was that it didn't reheat well, the tater tots fell apart. Next time I'll use a larger baking dish, to crisp the taters more.  Good stuff inspite of that one flaw.

I would say this is your basic recipe but plan on adding your own touches.  I doubled the cheese, mixed in chopped broccoli with the tater tots,  added enouch cajun spice to my liking.  Sprinkled the top with bacon bits and nothing else.  I didn't have mushroom soup availble so I used cream of chicken.  The kids loved it.

We thought this was good, but a bit heavy on the sour cream taste.  If we make it again I will cut the sour cream, and possible add more cream of mushroom!  I guess it is all in what you like to taste the most, and I'd rather not have that strong sour cream taste.

This was a wonderful easy recipe.  Good comfort food.  I have made it a coule of times.  
Sometimes I didn't use the onions, just because they are expensive, and it's still good.
I recommend this to go with any main dish, or by itself.  Husband loved it also.
