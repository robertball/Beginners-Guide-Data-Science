This is an awesome base recipe for either tuna or seafood pasta salad. I use it for both and adjust/lower the amount of seasoned salt with Old Bay, smoked paprika, and whatever else I feel it needs after melding in the fridge. I add sweet peas and diced celery for crunch, (no cukes) , onion always and a good imitation crab for the seafood version. Thanks for sharing

Probably the best tasting tuna mac salad I've had in a while. The addition of the baby shrimp adds just the right bit of extra flavor. Easy to make.
The recipe does make a large amount - I doubled it for a party and had two lasagna aluminum pans full!

It turned out good!! I did not use as much Mayo, only 2 cups instead of 2 1/2. I also used a smaller amount of Vinegar and cooked with Penne noodles. Family loved it

Really good! Just made and just had a bowl so I can't wait to taste later or even tomorrow as the cooks notes state it's better the next day.

Our family loves this recipe!  I send it in our kids lunches, and  make it going into busy weekends.  I do add 8oz frozen peas, and all tuna (no shrimp) just because itâ€™s more convenient.  The cucumber is really awesome.
