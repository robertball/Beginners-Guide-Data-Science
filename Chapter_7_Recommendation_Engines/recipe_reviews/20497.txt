Good dip. I had to use what I had in the house, so any change to the ingredients works fine. I chose to spread the finished dish in a cassarole dish and layer with cheeses and black olives. Quite hardy.

I though the flavor was a little bland so I added chili powder and red pepper flakes and it turned out to be a pretty good hit.  I will make again

I used leftover seasoned taco meat in this recipe and only one can of black beans because that was all I had on hand. I did go light on the hot sauce because I was serving my husband and two kids. They made quick work of this dip and a bag of tortilla chips, I swear it was inhaled in 15 minutes.
