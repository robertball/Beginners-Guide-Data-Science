I hate to say this about someone's recipe but this was absolutely horrible! I made to go along with "Asian Lettuce Wraps" and after tasting it I threw it away before it even got to the table and made "Oriental Dipping Sauce" from this site instead which was great!  This had WAY too much rice vinegar it just did not taste good at all to me way too overpowering.  Sorry for the terrible review but I've got to be honest.

OK, here's the scoop. My SIL is Phillipino and when she or we make her egg roll recipe, all we use to dip them in is vinegar. We love it which is the reason I'm rating this a five. So, for eggrolls, this recipe is perfect for us. However, tonight I made this for Asian Lettuce Wraps and I have to agree with Matt in that there was too much vinegar for what we were using it for. I only used a tablespoon and it was perfect. I also subbed Hoisin Sauce for the honey.
Thank you Greg!

I made this sauce for some chinese dumplings and it was a great compliment.  Looking back over the comments, I agree that it was probably a little too much vinegar.  Other than that, though, I enjoyed it.

I did not have any sesame seeds or sesame oil, but I think it was fine without them. We dipped traditional pot stickers from this website in the sauce and I was pretty impressed with the authenticity!

Proving that everyone has different tastes, I didn't find this too vinegary at all. I actually added a splash more rice vinegar after I tasted the sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This was perfect as a dipping sauce for steamed pork and shrimp dumplings.

This was really good! I followed the recipe and added about a cup of packed brown sugar to cut the vinegar. I didn't have fresh ginger but powdered tasted great. I spooned it over a stir-fry, asian pork, and jasmine rice and it was awesome! Thanks!

Yum! I didn't find the vinegar at all overpowering, unlike some other reviewers. It all worked very well together. Served as a dipping sauce for Edamame-Stuffed Wontons from this site. Thanks :)

Used this to marinate a pork loin for a few hours then simmered the pork loin in the sauce until done. Was very good and not too sweet like teriyaki can be sometimes.

This is a great, simple sauce. So easy to make. If you want to give it a little zing, just add some red pepper flakes like I did. I don't think it will be good with lettuce wraps, but for gyoza or egg rolls, or anything fried it is great.

11.2.18  A little on the sweet side for us, so I’d cut the honey at least in half (maybe even more) in the future.   To offset the sweetness this time around, I did add some Hoisin sauce.  That distracted the sweet flavor a little and, also, thickened it a bit which was good because I used it for egg rolls.

Read some of the other reviews where people were complaining about there being too much vinegar. It's supposed to be like that, it's perfect for things like dumplings/wontons/gyoza, and especially sashimi. I would omit the ginger though, and add thin slices of raw white onion in nice bite size pieces. You can grab them with chopsticks while dipping.

Made this tonight. Super easy and quick to prepare. I did mix all ingredients in a small saucepan and heated for about 5 minutes until well blended and warm. Excellent with fried wontons.

I halved the rice vinegar after reading reviews. It was still a bit too vinegary for me, but otherwise very nice. I used low sodium soy sauce and substituted one tablespoon of brown sugar for honey, which I didn't have.  Everything else was according to the recipe. Very fast and easy to make.

I halved the recipe ; only used 1 tsp of vinegar ( was enough) for my taste buds. Kept the rest the same. Was delish with pot stickers and rice.

I searched this up quickly while my mother-in-law was making fried spring rolls for her prayer meeting tonight. I was thinking the sweet n spicy sauce is boring. I halfed the ingredients, though, and shredded the ginger, then I added cut up green onions. It was perfect, not only for the spring rolls! We also had grilled fish, and it made the course all the more oriental. ;) Definitely a perfect recipe for a quick sauce.

Enjoyed this as-is as a dipping sauce (halved the vinegar) but also modified to use with leftover chicken and rice.  Added a cube of chicken bouillon, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 3 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 cup chopped green onion.  Cut leftover chicken into bite-size pieces and added to sauce, served over jasmine rice.

This is really good!  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground instead (I think fresh would have been better).  I also added some red pepper flakes.  This sauce is GREAT with pot stickers!

It's good. I added a little bit of honey to balance the soy and vinegar.

Quick (I don't even think it took the 15 minutes noted), easy and a great compliment to the lettuce wraps we dipped in it. I did scale back the vinegar quite a bit in this using not quite a 1/4 cup, and we thought it was fabulous!

Made this to go with cherry chicken lettuce wraps from this site.  It was the perfect complement.  A little on the salty side so I did cut it with a little water.  I think if I use low sodium soy sauce it would be fine.  I also cut back on the vinegar just a tad b/c of the other reviews.

Too much vinegar. I cut back based on other reviews and it was still too overpowering, even with 2x the amount of honey.

This sauce made my dish the hit of the party. Paired with steamed vegetable dumplings from the freezer section of my favorite Asian grocery store, mine was the first dish finished at a potluck of 50 plus people. I skipped the sesame seeds and pounded the garlic and ginger in a  mortar and pestle, wow!

Tried it.  Way too much soy sauce, vinegar and sesame oil.  Disappointed.

Made my own version with 2T rice wine vinegar, 2T soy, honey to taste, 1/4 cup water, 3 T orange ginger sauce, dash of sesame oil.  Perfect.

The recipe is fine but how the sauce turns out has a lot to do with the quality of one's ingredients. It's hard to find decent soy sauce in Milwaukee for instance or rice wine vinegar either and what type of honey is fairly critical.  Obviously the exact proportions of the ingredients should be adjusted to taste.

Very Good!  
I made this when I discovered my cooking potstickers had no sauce, so I used this recipe...
  My only changes were powdered garlic, powdered ginger and in place of the sugar, I used sweet chili dipping sauce...
  Good stuff, better than most that I've had in restaurants.

Easy and delicious.  I used 1/2 tsp powdered ginger and omitted sesame oil as I did not have any but still turned out great.  Family loved it both over ramen noodles with veggies as well as dumplings.  Will definitely make again.

I love any version of dumpling sauce. This one is quite easy to whip up in a jif. I replaced the honey with 1 tbsp of agave nector. My honey was too crystalized for blending, great substitute. Overall a quick and easy recipe with all the ingredients usually on hand. Who's ever recipe it is,  Thanks.

It was too much vinegar!  Next time I will add the vinegar a teaspoon at a time until I find the correct amount for my palate.
