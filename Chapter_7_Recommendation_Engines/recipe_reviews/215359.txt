I've been making this recipe for years, although slightly different/simpler.  I use just straight goat cheese (not crumbled, found in 'tubes-like' packaging) to wrap the grapes. Instead of almonds to roll them in, I use crushed candied pecans (pecan pieces mixed within egg white, brown sugar & vanilla. baked for 15 at 325- cooled and crushed)   That's it!   It's a delicious variation enjoyed by my family every holiday season!

This is a nice, mild appetizer to serve with others on a tray.  Save labor by using a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop (the kind with a lever) to portion the cheese mixture.  Pressing the grape right into the scoop the cheese will ooze up around the grape and you can pat it to cover completely and then just pop it onto a plate.  Wear light-weight food service gloves and it's quick and clean!  I used grapes that were quite large, so needed to double the recipe to yield about 30.  Fun to make and good eating!

This is a good recipe. To save time I chopped up the grapes and mixed them into the cheese and then rolled everything into one giant cheese ball. I also tossed in a little garlic.

This was fun to make, and really good. The combination was fantastic! I didn't change a thing, except I don't use alcohol, so I used apple cider vinegar, and it worked perfectly, I wish I had made a bigger batch! It was a big hit at the dinner party I went to! The plastic glove suggestion made it very easy. It did take a while to make, but it was worth it! This will be a standard when I go to parties this year! Thank you!

I make these, but instead of port wine I use whatever red wine I have around and add some sugar to it. I also use the ends of green onions because I cannot get chives where I live. I also put the cheese mixture in the freezer before balling it around the grapes. Helps a lot - less mess. This is my favorite recipe to bring to parties.

These were good.  They were better the first day they were made, lost a little bit on the second day.  I gave it three stars because they were a pain to make and chevre and grapes are expensive.

To simplify, chop everything up & use as a cheese spread. I substituted Framboise for the port wine. Great with crackers, vegetables, or on sandwiches.

These are quite tasty little balls of yum.  However, they are vastly impractical, leading to my poor rating.  I think I paid around $12-13 for all the ingredients for this recipe (and omitted the port because I am not buying a whole bottle for 2 tbsp), and only got 11 little truffles.  Not to mention they are labor intensive and messy!  I do like other reviewers ideas of making this into a cheese ball, however.

And this is just an opinion - not to offend the foodies - but I really think this might be just as tasty with plain cream cheese.  If you really want to try this one out, skip the $20/lb chevre and go for the Philly.

This is a good and simple recipe for cocktail party snacks.  The 1oz spring-loaded cookie scoop trick works like a charm!  I thought the cheese mixture was a little mild.  I'll probably ad some garlic or cayenne pepper the next time.  I'm also thinking this would be a good model to use for a sweet bit, replacing the chevre with mascarpone, and adding a little confectioner's sugar, replacing the chives with chopped dried cranberries...

These were terrible. Made them exactly as recipe was stated. Decided not to take them to the Christmas lunch I made them for. Maybe they would be better without the chives. Won't ever make them again because the ingredients were too expensive for such a weird tasting appetizer. Didn't like them at all

Messy as all get out to make- but delicious.  I used pistachios instead of almonds.  Very well received.

I made these for a christmas party because they sound really good.  I don't think I will use this recipe again because they were very labor intensive to make, and they were not a big hit.  People said they were "different" and there was half the plate left over.  Not a terrible recipe... but maybe a little weird.

I couldn't wait to try this recipe!  I made these for two separate parties on the same weekend and everyone LOVED them!  I didn't use the plastic wrap as suggested so fingers got a little messy but they were so worth every bit of the mess!!  My husband and I love different types of wine and these paired with either red or white are absolutely delicious.  Eating them right after they are refrigerated is best...biting into the truffle and finding the cold grape center.....YUM!!!  The crunchiness of the toasted almonds compliments the smoothness of the cheeses and with the grape, the tastes and flavors burst in your mouth!  I will be making  these for a long, long time.   I haven't tried the other suggestions in some of the reviews (different type of nuts, etc.) but I will try them next time!  If you like goat cheese and wine....you'll love these!

I've made these before....they're a bit tedious, but worth it! Make them way ahead of when you need them so you're not all stressed & in a hurry....or you'll be doing lots of cussing while you're rolling the cheese around the grape! I didn't use plastic wrap. I just put some of the cheese mixture into the palm of my hand and rolled it around with the palm of my opposite hand to make a little ball, then dropped them onto a pie plate that had the finely chopped nuts so I could get them coated with those. Wear gloves if you don't want you're hands messy! You can omit the chives if you'd like. I always used red grapes, the firmer the better and make sure they are VERY dry after you wash them or the cheese won't stick to the grape! I've used pistachios before and their greenish hue looked very pretty. Store them in the fridge until ready to serve! People are always super surprised when they bite into one of these if they don't know what they are. They'll create plenty of chatter at your next gathering & lots of recipe requests!

These were a very expensive appetizer that were also quite time-consuming.  Combining both of those issues with the fact that they were not gobbled up by my house guests makes this a recipe that I will not be making again.  Personally, I though they tasted fine, but they did not blow me away.

So simple to make.  I followed the exact recipe and it was outstanding!!  Everyone loved it!  It looked as good as it tasted.   There were no leftovers.  I will be making this recipe again!
