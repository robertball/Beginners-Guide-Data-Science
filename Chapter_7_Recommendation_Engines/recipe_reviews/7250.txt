Help! My cake fell, and tasted like solid grease. Are you sure it takes 1 cup of oil? I thought that seemed like a lot. The outside of the cake is beautiful, but the inside is pure grease....Judging by the other reviews, I must have done something wrong..

Very moist cake with a  light lemon flavor. I made it in a 13X9 pan & baked it about 35 mins. It is so tasty, it didn't even need frosting! A keeper.

this has got to be the best cake recipe I have tried anywhere. It was super moist and came out beautiful and cut like a dream.  I couldnt believe how great tasting it was.  Usually I find pound cakes a bit dry or have to much butter taste--this didnt.   I made the following substitutions: I used orange extract (we were out of lemon) in the following measures: 1 tablespoon and another 1 teaspoon of orange flavor extract, and one tsp.of almond extract and  1tsp of butter extract.  I used a french vanilla cake mix-we had it on hand.  I used half regular sour cream and half fat free-because both were leftover and I didn't have anything else on hand.  I made sure I did not use a pudding mix cake mix or a butter recipe cake mix -sometimes these can come out oily and don't rise when you use substitutions (at least that has been my luck anyway).  I used a spice cake mix and half a tbsp of Orange and another half tablespoons Jamaican rum flavour and it came out great. For those with oily or fallen cakes, make sure to use just under a cup of oil and just under a cup of sour cream. Be sure to beat exactly the full four minutes but not over or it will fall. Be sure the cake doesn't look shiny in spots or its not done.

As another reviewer did, I used what I had on hand...French Vanilla cake mix and almond extract.  The cake had a good flavor to it, but to me it wasn't as moist and dense as a pound cake should be.  The texture was closer to an angel food cake.  Still good taste and easy to make.

Great cake!  I left out the lemon extract and made two 9 inch rounds.  They came out wonderful and I halved each round for a four layer cake, filled with cool whip mixed with vanilla pudding mix and fresh strawberries and blueberries, topped with blueberries and raspberries to make a flag cake for the 4th of July.

Not sure what happened, followed the directions to a "T" and the cake fell in the middle.  The only thing different is I cooked it in a convection oven.

Great cake...though at 325 degrees the cake would not have been done in the 45 minutes shown on the recipe.  Again an easy cake to make and with great taste when finished.

This cake was the result of a craving to bake but no supplies in the house. It certaintly filled that itch because it took 60 minutes, 60 Minutes!, in the oven. I like the dense texture and how it's less crumby like regular box mix. I added a squeezed lime and subsituted the sour cream for creamcheese along with a tad bit of water and it came out great, this recipe is definately part of the book.

Great cake for strawberries!!  We loved it.  We baked it in a 9x13 pan, the cake was really moist, flavorful, and the edges were crispy.  The only thing was that I had to cover the top with aluminum foil when 10 minutes were left beacause it was getting really brown.

I didn't have a yellow cake mix on hand, so I used a French Vanilla mix, and used fresh lemon zest and juice to punch up the lemon flavor. It's a great and easy recipe, which I needed for a last minute gift.

This was pretty good for using a boxed cake mix.  I don't usually use mixed but for some reason I had one in the cupboard and searched for a recipe that I could use it in.  Tastes much better if you let it sit (removed from the pan and covered of course) overnight. I used a couple drops of butter flavor and a 1/2 teaspoon of rum extract for flavoring instead of the lemon and it was delicious! Husband and toddler loved it for dessert :)

My cake fell as soon as I took it out of the oven, I was left with a greasy mess that tasted slightly like pound cake.

Donna, I just can't STOP making this wonderful Pound Cake! I absolutely love it.  (Today, I tried adding the pineapple to the batter) and I did not like it.  I have learned my lesson and will stick to your recipe.  My friends and neighbors are already asking for it for Thanksgiving.  It is moist, moist, and just perfect and let me not forget easy to make.  I will keep close to you for more wonderful things to bake.  Thanks a million!!!!!!!

Very nice, dense, moist pound cake.  I don't buy treat and desserts for my kids lunches so I'm always looking for something different that I can make and freeze or divide up between their lunches and desserts for home.  This was excellent!!  I hesitate to make "homemade" goodies with boxed mixes but I was in a hurry and this really didn't taste boxed when it was done.  My daughter doesn't like lemon, so I substituted the lemon extract with orange and it was a hit!  Thanks!
