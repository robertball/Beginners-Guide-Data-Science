Oh YUM! This is a great drink! I used Chambord a common substitute for creme de cassis. Everything else is just as written. One ounce equals two tablespoons. You can decorate your drink with the orange slice and maraschino cherries as you wish---leaves you open for a little artistry! Thanks for the drink Chris! Skol!
