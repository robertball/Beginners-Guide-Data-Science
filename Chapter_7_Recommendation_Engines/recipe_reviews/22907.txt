This cake is not a "wow" but it sure is very good.  I reduced the sugar, and used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of splenda.  The splenda does not affect the taste of the cake at all, so this is a good recipe for diabetics.  I also baked 3/4 of the batter in a cake pan and the remaining 1/4 in 2 ramekins.  Both version turned out well.  Best served right out of the steamer :) I will be making this again.

This tasted like the recipe for Chinese steamed cake (on this website). I used one cup of white sugar. I didn't have any black sesame seeds, but it was delicious anyways.

Brilliant. not greasy and fluffy. the only thing is i dont know how to fold the white to the yolk mixture, i have to MIX it. theres several parts of the yolk mixture that doesnt really mixed well with the white and it turns dense ( not fluffy) next time i'll add pinch of salt and double the green tea.
and i dont know how to make a preety cake like yours, mine stick to the metal container. i'll use parchment paper next time. we call this cake "kue bolu" in indonesia. they use small cup ( much like muffin cup) lined with parchment paper and fill it with cake batter and steam it. the taste is pretty much the same. i love this comfort food and this is a good option when you are ill.

This was surprisingly easy to make. I used my B&D Electric Steamer. I poured most of the recipe into the oval plastic container and the rest into 4 ramekins. It took about 15 minutes for the ramekins and 20 for the oval plastic container to steam fully. Thanks for the recipe. I was skeptical about folding in the egg whites, but it worked. It was very fluffy and not dense for me. Would go well with cream cheese icing. In my opinion, most things go well with cream cheese.

it tastes great. the only problem i have with it is that it's a little dry. it's really good to eat with milk. =D i've made it several times now and it's definitely a favorite.

The only way I could get this cake to cook was to put the batter onto wax paper, and place that directly onto the bamboo steamer. Served with light whipped and frozen raspberries. Was the perfect compliment. VERY HEALTHY!

The first time I made this, I followed the instructions exactly and found it was very hard to fold the batter. The flour mixture was too dense, and I had to add a splash of milk. Even with that, the cake ended up lumpy. However, the flavour was really nice, so I made it again but reduced the flour by 1/3 (used 1 cup instead of 1.5 cups). I also sifted the flour into the yolk mixture first,  and then folded the beaten egg whites into the batter. As a preference I also used less sugar (between 0.75 cup to 1 cup, no more) in the yolk mixture. With these changes the cake was perfect--smooth, spongy, and very lightly sweet (if you like sweet stuff, you can probably use the full amount of sugar--but I think 1 cup is plenty).  Cooking time is accurate.

The ratio of flour to egg whites is WAY too high. Cut back on flour by at least 50%.

Really light, interesting texture - like an angel food cake. I might use more green tea next time for a more obvious flavor. I had to finish baking it in the oven because the bamboo steamer was not getting the job done. Really good served with Greek vanilla honey caramel frozen yogurt, to compensate for a slight dryness.
