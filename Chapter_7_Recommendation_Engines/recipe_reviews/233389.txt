Substituted sardines for anchovies and left out the feta. Yum.  Used the feta in a second batch, without the fish, both were yummy. But... even though I'm not a big fish fan, the sardines added to the recipe.   More depth.

Up in the recipe description the submitter says you can leave the feta out since it is not traditional. I did leave it out but not on purpose. I totally forgot it  but it my opinion I don't think it needed it. It was plenty salty (almost too much) without it. I used green olives with pimentos for some color. I really likes this but you really have to like olives. It was pretty potent.
