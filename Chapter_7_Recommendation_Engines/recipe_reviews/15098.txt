I have used this recipe many times, and it is my husband's favorite. Two tips: use less dates, two cups at most, or they are too rich. Also, toast your walnuts before chopping them for the crust. The combo of toasted walnuts, butter, dates - SO good, and very similar to those my mom used to make. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe! Look no further for a recipe producing that old-fashioned oatmeal wdates and nuts flavors without the hassle of making individual cookies! The filling is very rich (and there was plenty of it), so I cut the bars thin and had far more than 24. Deducted one star only because I had a hard time putting the top half of the pastry in place. Guess I need practice. Thanks Holly!

These cookies are SO good!  I wish I could give them 10 stars.  And not too hard to make!  A spatula works best for spreading the layers.  Thank you!

This is the best recipe for Date Bars I've ever tried - and I've tasted many.  Worth the effort.

I used the recipe for the filling only and made hamantaschen.  Excellent!  Delicious and the cookies baked up quite nicely.

my oven might be off, but they needed another 12-15 minutes of cooking time....
I noticed there is no egg, and that may be why...all in all happy to have another recipe easily converted to a gluten-free dessert...I subbed the flour, combined rice, almond and gluten free flour....I always add a TBL of molasses to remove the aftertaste of the sourghum---it works every time!

Clearly the photo does not go with the directions. However, I made a couple of stylistic changes to accommodate family members' taste bud issues. Pulverized oats in blender to be coarse flour. No nuts were on hand, so I did without them. Instead of dates, I made an apple-carmel filling (had apples passed their prime). And WAALAA. Wonderful taste/texture. And the family didn't even realize there were oats in the cookies. Thanks for the recipe.

The easiest way to put on the top layer is to crumble it over the top in two passes.  Then gently pat together.  

This is exactly the recipe that I was looking for.  Delicious.  My husband is making friends in our high rise giving samples out to the neighbors.

These were easy to make as the instructions were easy to follow.  The cookie part was very tasty and had a nice texture - buttery, crunchy b/c of the walnuts and kind of roasted and chewy because of the oatmeal.  I only made one change and that was to add 1 teaspoon of ground cardamom along w/ the 1 tsp cinnamon.  The date filling had a nice texture.  I had never had date bars and was actually skeptical of the recipe but I ended up really liking them.  Oh, and the lemon and orange zest really adds a great flavor.  Everyone who tried them loved them, and most of them said that it was not too sweet.

I wanted something special to serve at Bunco. The ladies like sweet and gooey, I wanted healthy. Got both in this recipe. I added orange juice instead of water to date mixture. Very tasty.

Incredibly misleading picture to recipe! This is for date squares/ bars not date filled cookies.
