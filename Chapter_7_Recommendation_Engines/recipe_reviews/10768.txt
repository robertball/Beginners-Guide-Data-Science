I made these when I lived in Sweden. I would serve them with ice cream or whipped cream. Great Recipe

Yummy - I used one heaped TS of ground almonds instead of the bitter almonds. I only got 20 cookies out of this recipe.

I love these little cookies, They are so simple to make and super fast.  I did substitute pecans instead of the almonds. You really do need to watch the first batch to be sure your oven temp and time is right for them. They can burn easy. I used the smallest cookie scoop and got 36 cookies.

My daughter and I (and then just my daughter herself) made these and they are so yummy. We follwed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding about a capful of almond extract. Can't get bitter almond in the US but the extract had bitter almond. My family loved it, and so did a classroom full of teenagers.

The flavor is good.  Can't get bitter almonds here, so substituted regular almonds.  Bake time was too hot, so reduced the temp to 375 and baked longer.

These are so good! Hubby & I were going to have oatmeal for breakfast. I always roast slivered almonds and wanted something different instead of oatmeal with raisins and almonds. Did this recipe adding both those extra ingredients.  Will do again.
