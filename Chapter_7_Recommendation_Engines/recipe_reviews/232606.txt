I am trying to eat healthier and increase fruits and veg. This recipe is fantastic, make sure you use real lime, makes this whole recipe. The family said it is the best fruit salad they ever had. I might try fresh pineapple next time. The only down side is you have to eat this right away or the fruit gets mushy..bummer since this would be great at a picnic or pot luck...I did have next morning for breakfast, was still good but not the same as fresh. Will make this again for sure, you have to try this.

Really good. I loved how it used all natural ingredients. This makes a wonderful desert. The kids couldn't get enough of it. Not too sweet and not too tart. The perfect fruit salad.

This was AWESOME. It had just a hint of lime that wasn't overpowering and just delicious! Super easy too!

This was good, I enjoyed that I didn't have to use any extra ingredients with added sugars, or add any sugar to the fruit.  I used sliced fresh oranges rather than the mandarin oranges and omitted the strawberries and cut up a mango instead, added an extra banana, and used fresh cut pineapple rather than canned.  It was tasty, but the lime to honey ratio might be off a bit, this made me pucker!

Only changes for me was no good kiwi were to be found so they didnâ€™t make the bowl.  And I had fresh oranges instead of canned mandarins. The honey-lime dressing is genius so that will be on any fruit salad I make in the future no matter what the combination of fruits find their way into the bowl.

Refreshing...I skipped the banana because they always turn brown. I did add some blueberries and fresh pineapple. The honey and lime was a very good idea.

This fruit salad was DELICIOUS!  I also added some Casaba Melon I had on hand along with a mango and blueberries.  The additional fruits really gave the salad a wonderful variety.  The only thing I would do different is maybe eliminate the kiwis because they were a little sour - I guess not quite ripe enough.  Had friends visiting and served for dessert - and one of them is diabetic.  He wants his wife to make it for him all the time when they return home.  Simple to make and yummy to eat.
