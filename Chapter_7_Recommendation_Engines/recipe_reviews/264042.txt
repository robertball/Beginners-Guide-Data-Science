No changes. Very easy to make and very delicious. I will definitely make it again. It’s a great desert to serve company. Top with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Serve warm if you like. Awesome.

I've now made this 3 times and it still amazes me how good it turns out each time. I think the type of cake mix has a lot to do with it. I've never used the Duncan Hines mixes, but have opted for either a vanilla cake mix from Trader Joes or a cinnamon crumb/coffee cake mix from my local supermarket. I used 1 can of sliced peaches in light syrup and then frozen fresh peach slices (not thawed) to fill the bottom of the baking dish (the cake mixes have enough sugar that no extra sugar is needed). And I also sprinkled vanilla extract over the top of the cake mix before the melted butter. Delicious!!!

Love this easy recipe but I used fresh peaches from my tree. Added a little sugar.  I used a 9x9 dish and sprinkled enough cake mix to cover where you don’t see peaches. The 2/3 stick of melted butter and bake. Best thing is adding fresh whipped cream!!

I put a can of blueberry pie filling on the bottom of the dish and covered that with sliced peaches, then covered with a yellow cake mix, butter patts. When almost done, I added cinnamon and brown sugar mixed and sprinklered over for the last ten minutes of bake time.

This came out like uncooked cake mix and peaches. I think half cake mix placed first in baking dish, then add peaches with liquid then the last half of cake mix topped with melted butter may turn out more like  a cobbler.  Anyway the taste was great. Just a little embarrassed how it looked. Glad it was just family.

I added the usual to the peaches, brown sugar,  vanilla extract ,  lemon,  nutmeg , & cinnamon then I put the cake mix on top and then the butter.  It turned out extra yummy, I will definitely be making this again.

I added a tsp vanilla, about 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 1 tsp lemon juice. I also stirred all ingredients until cake mix was wet. Husband loved it!

People thought it was great
 I made the apple one, too. I liked it best. Peaches, w/syrup was too sweet for me. No one else seemed to agree with me.

Best Peach Cobbler Ever, truly. Easy to follow directions and the dessert was fantastic!  I made it for dinner guests and I’m making it again this weekend for house guests.  I will double it next time because I want to have more “leftover”

I have been making this for years, and everyone loves it!  I actually prefer this at room temp rather than right out of the oven.  It is probably the easiest recipe I’ve ever used but one of the best!
