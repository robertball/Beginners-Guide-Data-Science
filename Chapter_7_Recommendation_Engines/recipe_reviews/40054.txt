These didn't rise much at all and are pretty bland. The glaze is just sugar rather than having a flavor and needs vanilla or something. They had a cakelike texture which is not what I was going for. If you like cake doughnuts and put a good frosting or glaze on these they would be fine. If you are looking for a glazed doughnut like you can get at your local doughnut shop, this is definitely not the recipe for you.

Good recipe. I was a Navy cook for 8 years and we had a similar recipe. This is a very easy recipe. The dough itself is not very sweet, which can be nice so they are not too sweet. I also added a little bit of sugar with the yeast and water to allow the yeast to activate a little faster. My kids and I had a lot of fun rolling and cutting these out. Will make again. I covered mine with melted chocolate and powdered sugar! They were really good!

My husband and I made them on a date night together and were both surprised about how easy these were to make.  They took time to rise, but goodness was it worth it!  Thanks Sanah!  :)
*P.S...chocolate glaze is wonderful on them!*

I hate giving bad reviews, but I did not care for this recipe.  The doughnuts were light and fluffy, but there wasn't a taste to the dough.  It was beyond bland, and had a bad aftertaste. The glaze didn't help, it had a very chalky taste.  I will continue to search for a better recipe.

these doughnuts were very easy to make.  They were light and fluffy but they lacked taste.  I would sugguest adding the nutmeg or vanilla extract to give it some flavoring.  I topped them with icing glaze containing confectioner's sugar , milk and vanilla extract to give the icing some vanilla flavor.

Basically a good, serviceable recipe. The nutmeg, however, is way, WAY off. Too much, so that spice overpowers and dominates the flavor. About 1/4 tsp gives you that nice little hint of taste. In no case, however, would I ever put in more than 1/2 tsp, and that's if you really like nutmeg. If allowed to rise properly, then slid into the oil with the exposed side down you will have lovely, puffy, light treats. Just take care not to be too impatient and fry the cut donuts without waiting for them to rise sufficiently. That second rise can make the difference between light donuts and "sinkers."

Delicious! Add sprinkles for extra cha-zing! The only reason this is four stars instead of five is because we accidently overcooked some! Practically 5 stars! yyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy

These have the texture of a doughnut- lightly crisp on the outside, soft and warm in the middle. They have no doughnut flavor. They taste like a fabulous bread stick. In fact, I may keep this recipe to make breadsticks (use 1/2 white/ 1/2 wheat flour, cook in rectangles and then sprinkle with garlic and parmesan). Vanilla would help tremendously for a doughnut flavor. This glaze is horrible. I used another recipe for icing (divided into 3rds and made chocolate, vanilla, and butterscotch, and some powder sugar doughnut holes), and the doughnuts all of a sudden tasted like doughnuts. With a rich glaze, I am glad the doughnuts don't have as much sugar. They just need the addition of vanilla to differentiate doughnut from breadstick.

I may be a man of simple tastes, but I love my donuts (or doughnuts if you prefer). This is probably the best recipe I have tried on allrecipes.com. Usually recipes try to form a veritable gestalt upon the taste buds with too much sugar or other similar issues, but this recipe is right on for an easily made donut that I might venture to call fluffy little delightful morsels of happiness. It is fantastic with a dusting of cinnamon & suguar, powdered/confectioners sugar, glaze, frosting, sprinkles, and/or chocolate. There isn't much not to like about this recipe. Hats off to the contributor.

great glaze recipe! I used (Pilsbury Big Grand Biscuts) and used an old salt shaker to cut out holes and then deep fried the donuts and holes but used the glaze and top mine with cin-sugar mix.....GREAT!

I followed the recipe without the nutmeg and it was fantastic!   I have been adding different icing to these as well, and cream cheese is my favourite.  I only made a couple doughnuts, after that I made all "timbit" sizes and they seem to freeze really well for better portion control.

these are really, really good!!  I added vanilla to the milk before I scorched it, and I only used 1/2 a tsp of nutmeg.  Also, instead of glazing the doughnuts, I tossed them in cinnamon and confectionery sugar.  These doughnuts were so light and fluffy!!  you just have to know what you are doing to get them right.... if your doughnuts came out dense or flat you are doing something wrong.
my only hangup (and the reason I gave them four stars instead of five) is that they absolutely have to be eaten fresh.  the next day they are dry and hard :(  
eat them when they are still warm, and you'll die and go to heaven!

I was surprised how fast and easy these were to make!  A review said they were flavourless so I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  The second time I made them I added 1/4 tsp of each vanilla, lemon extract and coconut extract.  Yummy!

These were ok. I baked them instead of fried them, which actually worked very well. The only problem was that they were too dense and I also thought the nutmeg was a little strong. You just want a hint of it, not for it to be over-powering.

Well these were easy enough to make and I used a regular sugar glaze cooked over the stove because I didn't have enough powdered sugar.  Will make again!  Whoever had flat donuts was doing something wrong.  Mine turned out fine.  I used dinosaur, flower, star, heart, teddy bear, butterfly, and round cutters.  Picture provided if you want to see finished product.

Pretty durn good! (I)Didn't add the nutmeg and I made half of the icing chocolate, using just shy of 3 to 1 cocoa.  My yeast was out of date but rose just fine. 
Note: Careful tending in the oil because they will cook fast.  Good luck! (shouldn't be any leftovers)

I would highly NOT recommend this recipe. I followed the instructions, but omitted the nutmeg becuase I did not have any on hand. I was really looking forward to this recipe because of the high ratings and great reviews. I noticed that some reviewers mentioned the "bland" taste and said they were going to add vanilla extract next time. I added 1/2 teaspoon (I was using half the recipe), yet still the dough was very bland. I have also followed the recipe stating "knead for 3-4 mins" I kneaded mine no longer than the given time, and my donuts came out tough. I am never making this donut again! I'm sure there is better recipes out there for this.

Ok, I was looking for a nice light and chewy donut, like the kind we can get at a bakery or the grocery store bakery.  These were very dense and not like donuts.  Even with the chocolate glaze (Easy Chocolate bundt cake glaze - from this site, which is awesome!)
It really wasn't a donut, very bread like.  I did not use the nutmeg.  ********** However, I did end up using the other half of the donut dough and baked them plain, instead of frying and made bagels!  So, this recipe makes a good baked bagel that I made into breakfast sandwichs.  To make bagels, just follow the recipe and bake them.  Then split them in half and you have homemade bagels!

try using powdered milk and adding hot water instead of scalding your milk. it will improve on the texture of the dough. i like fresh yeast instead of dry yeast as well, it just responds better and with the frosting add just a spot of vanilla and almond extract. bland sugar frosting is very unappealing. otherwise a fair recipe

Edible, but not good by any means! It has the consistency and taste of bread, very bland bread. I coated most of the doughnuts in cinnamon-sugar [1/2 c. sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, pinch of salt], those were much better than the glazed ones. The glaze just didn't add enough sweetness. Plus the cinnamon helped with the blandness issue. I followed some of the other review's advice and only put in 1/2 tsp nutmeg - I didn't taste it at all, so I would put in a whole tsp. But I would highly suggest eating them warm and the same day you make them! The outside gets kind of mushy the next day.

these didn't taste too much like donuts you would buy in a shop, but nonetheless they still had a very delicious home-cooked flavor.  The only problem i encountered was that my frying oil could have been possibly to hot so the outsides browned while the insides of the donuts still remained raw. make sure your oil isn't too hot!

I have never made doughnuts before. These turned out pretty good. Very good with a vanilla glaze.

I did not care for this recipe. They tasted like fried white bread. The recipe could easily support a teaspoon of salt and 2/3 cups sugar. We're going to stick to store-bought donuts. They taste great, are inexpensive, and you're house won't smell. Also much less work and clean up.

I've used this recipe several times both as a full and half batch.  It works exceptionally well in a bread machine.  I think the frying oil temp is a bit too hot at 375.  I put mine down at 300F and they don't brown as quickly.  The second rise is the most important one.  When they're big and light, you drop them into the oil.  Some of mine have almost doubled in size!  I've also substituted butter flavored shortening in a pinch, they were still tasty.

Aside from being really easy, they are easily flavored to your own taste. The batch I just made I cut without the center holes so I could fill them with preserves. I also did some rolled in cinnamon and sugar and others with a maple glaze. MUST EAT FRESH!!
I have to agree with a previous post, if they turned out like hockey pucks, you did something completely wrong, and as far as flavor, if it's too bland add your own flavoring, or fillings/glazes.

I made a double batch, and while they were OK, I personally thought that they were a little bland. I used almond extract instead of nutmeg, don't care for that taste and iced them with Chocolate. I think the donut needed more sugar.

Good---almost a cake-like donut. Someone else said biscuit-like, and I would agree with that! We skipped making the glaze and dipped them in Eagle Brand. My 6 year old loved them! Not a healthy snack, but we had so much fun making them! Thanks for the post!

I have tried many doughnut recipes and have been baking and cooking for many years, and I say that this recipes makes a great doughnut! They rose very well, were light and fluffy and the recipe was quick to make. For those who rated this recipe poorly, I'm wondering if they didn't knned the dough long enough, or let it rise long enough, thus the cake like texture. As for them not having enough flavor, doughnuts are not very sweet on their own, and unless you are making a flavored doughnut, you get flavor from whatever topping you put on the doughnut,frosting, sugar, etc. If you are new to cooking, don't be afraid to alter the simple glaze with flavor extracts or other ingredients to get the flavor you like. I will say that I opted to not add nutmeg to this recipe, but as stated, this was optional. If you are looking for a spice doughnut recipe, you could add apple pie spice or pumkin pie spice to the mix or just plain cinnemon.

This was almost flavorless--as I baked and didn't fry the donuts--but the texture was wonderful!

Since I loved the texture and consistency of these donuts so much, I'm going to tweak this recipe a bit until I get a truly fabulous baked yeast donut!  (I don't eat fried foods).  Below are some tips I've come up with for more flavor next time around:
1) If baking, pre-heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and then bake donuts for 10 minutes.  Donut holes will need to bake for 12 minutes.

2) Use 1 Cup scolded milk with 1/4 C. instant coffee, instant cappuccino or flavored liqueur mixed in.  

3) Add 1/2 C. chopped, toasted nuts or pieces of chocolate to the tops of the donuts after you cut them from the dough and you proof them for a second time.  *Please note, only add these items if baking the donuts or else the nuts or chocolate will burn.

I hope some of these ideas help!

My younger brother has made these doughnuts a trademark of his among his friends, and I thought I'd give it a whirl.  They turned out great, but the method doesn't make much sense unless you are using a kitchen-aid mixer with a dough hook.  As I do not own one, I had some trouble getting the yeast-water, eggs and butter to mix into the already doughy milk-flour mix. (I ended up using my hand beaters, which made  a bit of a mess, but got things to mix).  But like I said, the recipe makes a great doughnut!

Dough took longer to rise than noted.  Had to put in a warm place to rise what little it did.  Finished product was tasteless and somewhat bisquit like.  Not quite what I am looking for.  If I use this recipe again I will increase yeast, add vanilla or someother flavor, and increase milk in mixture as the dough was too dry.  If you like bisquit like doughnuts, you might like these.  For the time invested, not a five star recipe.

The donuts did rise but it was a cake-like interior not fluffy.  I believe they needed more yeast and also the glaze is just pure sugar tasting.  Not the donuts from the bakery style.

It was a total fail. I don't know what I did wrong but the dough didn't rise and they were hard after they cooled down. They were more like cake doughnuts which I do not like.

This recipe is a good one. For those that say the doughnuts didn't rise you didn't go thru the directions correctly. As for those that say they are bland. Understand this is a basic recipe. Which means you can make changes to it. like reducing the sugar content or raising it so it is as sweet as you want. The glaze is a basic glace. Taste is simple. Add vinella or orange or maple extract. For those that like filled puffs this recipe works well just make or get the stuff you want in yours.
If you have a bread machine then this can be done in it. I use powered milk and water and it came out great...I use my dough recipe for cinnimon rolls and once the dough is finished mixing I put it in a greased or ooiled bowl to rise. I then knock it down and roll it out jst like these doughnuts are done. All it takes in a little thinking and some common sense....

This recipe was edible but more like a dinner roll than donut.  Could easily use twice the sugar and definitely double if not triple the amount of yeast.  We did let them rise till more than double on both proofings and they were still a bit dense. Flavor was ok but added some vanilla could have used more also a great use for pumpkin pie spice as sub for nutmeg adds a little more complex flavor profile.

These were easy to make and tasty enough. I followed others advice an added a teaspoon of vanilla to the milk to add a little more flavor. I rolled the dough out too thin - make sure it’s at least a half inch. When you cut the doughnuts they should look fairly thick. They also need some type of topping- we used a chocolate glaze and cinnamon sugar.

Delicious!  This recipe definitely delivers on The doughy part of doughnuts.  I baked them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. The flavour mostly comes from the toppings—I dipped them in melted butter and then into a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.  I had one 3 days later and it was still great after toasting it up.

Very easy to make.  They were heavy and had the consistency of a cake doughnut.  They were tasty, but I was expecting a lighter doughnut since it was a yeast raised recipe.

Not good enough to serve for Christmas breakfast.  You could probably serve these to kids, and they'd like them well enough.  But for my purposes, these aren't good enough.  I can't serve these to my family.  They are not light and fluffy.  They a denser than frying pillsbury biscuits, and they are extremely bland (kinda like if you fried a plain biscuit), even if you add the optional nutmeg.  They just don't turn out like you would expect doughnuts to turn out.  And I did a chocolate glaze not the milk and sugar glaze and that makes them palatable, but if you are looking for a traditional yeast doughnut, you're not going to like these.

I’m a newbie at baking. I tried this recipe twice and the second time came out divine after I learned some lessons after my first try. The first batch turned out good but the second was WAY more tasty. After doing some reading of other recipes I made some minor alterations. The second batch came out fluffy and very tasty! I used good quality salted butter bc that’s all I had so I skipped addding the salt. I cut the butter into bite size pieces and once I finished warming up the milk I poured the warm milk into the bowl of butter and sugar. This made the butter soften but did not liquify. I added good vanilla extract to the eggs when I whisked them. Like the recipe said, I added a few dashes of nutmeg to the flour but I also added a light dash of cinnamon. I used canola oil the second time around instead of vegetable oil which made a HUGE difference  for the better as well. I made half the dough and it yielded 8 doughnuts plus some holes.  I think this donut is best tossed in sugar and cinnamon rather than glaze. My whole house smelled just like Donkin Donuts! This recipe is very simple and easy.  I didn’t even use a mixer, I just used a dinner spoon to mix! The best part is that I put the other batch of dough in the fridge and made more donuts the next day and it came out just as good!!

Dough did not rise very much and was very bland (I didn't use nutmeg). Overall pretty disappointed. It was a lot of work for something that wasn't as fluffy and yummy as I was hoping.

I am unsure of why these did not turn out fluffier than was shown in the picture. They had great flavor, as they are all gone now, but they did not have the fluffy texture of the store bought glazed donuts that I was hoping for. Maybe my yeast was older, they did not rise much. They did in the bowl, but not after they were cut into donut shapes on the table. These were closer to cake donuts instead of the fluffy glazed ones.  I will look for a different recipe next time.

I did try this, and the temp is too high. It should be around 350, and it would have a better taste if the dough had time overnight in the fridge, so that the yeast will have time to eat a lot slower. Just as with any dough, the slower the yeast grows, the more flavor the dough should have. Over all the recipe is good, thanks. 
  P.S. I fried three, and put the rest in the fridge covered, and will fry them tomorrow, and I added a little vanilla to the glaze.

The recipe was easy to follow and prepare. The doughnuts looked beautiful once done however the taste was very disappointing. They were very bland. Once I put the glaze on it was like eating puffy cardboard with wet powdered sugar.

I used this recipe for the first time and it will now be my only doughnut recipe! I added nutmeg and did little doughnut holes and rolled them in icing sugar. Be sure your holes are only about 1 inch in diameter as they will puff up twice their size. 5 minutes in a deep fryer and cool. There is so much flavour, you do not need any glaze. They were a HUGE hit! Thank you for sharing!

It was very good! We all loved it and some say it tastes better than Shiply's! A little less nutmeg for glazed, but for all the others we tasted (chocolate, cinnamon, and sugar) it was great!

I love this recipe!! It is my go to recipe with a few of my own tweaks. I add a cinnamon stick to the scalding milk that way I get a delicious cinnamon flavor. After the milk has scalded I add vanilla extract  and mix it up. Once the milk has cooled a bit, but still warm, I temper my yeast in that. The recipe doesn't really need that last bit of water unless you really feel it does, but the milk can hold the recipe together just fine. Finally I do add the bit of nutmeg to the flour just to have 'hm is there nutmeg in this?'.

I loved this doughnut! It came out very light and I now make them all the time. the only adjustment i make is a little vanilla and orange extract in the glaze. Its the recipe ill stick to, because its simple.

This recipe was really good.  A lot better than the last recipe i tried. The only thing i did was add vanilla to the recipe.

These are pretty good and easy to make.. just make sure you don't overhead your oil or they will brown way too fast on the outside. These are best fresh, they're not quite as good the next day. Over all pretty good, my husband loved them.

4 Stars for being a recipe my kids loved =) The doughnuts were not exactly what I wanted but will make some changes next time.
