I made then recipe as written and this is a keeper! As someone with an autoimmune disease looking to make better choices this is perfect! The taste reminds me of a tangy honey mustard dressing. We not only put this on our salads but roasted vegetables too.

This recipe is a great base for all kinds of delicious dressings! I thought that the final product was a little heavy on olive oil flavor and mouthfeel, and that there wasn't enough avocado. Both easily fixable! Tasted great and a beautiful color!

I was skeptical of a 5 star rating with only two reviews, but this is my new favorite dressing! Tangy, sweet and spicy. I sub'ed vegannaise for the avocado and added black pepper. The lemon zest gives it amazing flavor.

I thought it was very good.   I put half an avacado in recipe.
