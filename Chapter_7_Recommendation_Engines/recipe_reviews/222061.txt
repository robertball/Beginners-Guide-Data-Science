This was yummo! Add ice to the mix and you'll have a 5 star smoothie (so much better ice cold). Thanks for a nice combo of flavors!

First time trying a smoothie - not a big fruit eater and thought would be a good way to add fruit and have for breakfast.  I used Flax seed instead as that is what i had on hand.  Neighbor gave me a couple mangos from her tree so that also inspired me to try this smoothie.  Really nice flavor - will definitely make again.

Great smoothie!  I love that it has Chia seeds in it but you will not taste them.
