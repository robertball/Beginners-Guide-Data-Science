WOW talk about EASY and extremely tasty!!! Our family absolutely loved this satay recipe!! I didn't think 15 minutes of marinating time would be enough but it was very good!! We love spiced up food so next time I might marinate it even longer. We used our George Foreman grill and since it cooks both sides at the same time we just grilled it for 5 minutes and it came out great!!! Thanks Estherlita...this is wonderful!

These were a positive hit at my dinner event.  Even with my substitutions, they were delicious.  I used pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce, and olive oil for the peanut oil.  I also, shocked by how liquidy my peanut sauce was turning out, doubled the peanut butter to 1 cup.  I'm used to a thicker sauce, and this turned out just how I wanted it.  A restaurant-quality recipe - thank you.

Oh my God! This is fabulous...It has alot of ingredients, but is worth the effort I made this as written. If you are not going to make it as written and you don't like it then you shouldn't rate it.

I loved this dish as did my family. I did spice up the peanut sauce with a bit of red pepper flakes as was suggested by other reviewers. Otherwise, the recipe was perfect. Served with basmati rice and a side of broccoli. Delish!

Delicious, easy and visually appealing makes this a perfect appetizer for company.  I made the following modifications:  halved the marinade for one chicken breast; substituted ketchup for tomato sauce; added a pinch of red pepper flakes; flattened chicken before cutting into strips; marinaded chicken in a bag for four hours; soaked skewers for at least two hours; grilled on my Cuisinart griddler.  I did not make the peanut sauce.  I look forward to trying this again with a fattier cut of chicken like the thigh, as well as with pork, beef and prawns.  This is a wonderful recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Thank you Estherlita!  My 6 year old daughter couldn't get enough - she ate more than my husband and myself.  I accidentally opened up tomatoe soup and used that instead of the tomatoe sauce and it still turned out great.  Thanks for this recipe - a definite do again.

Fantastic! As good as any restaurant.  I left it to marinade about 1 hour.  This would be just as good made with chicken thighs.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great chicken!  Didn't care for the dipping sauce...too peanuty.  I had chicken satay at a party recently and the sauce had a bit of curry, maybe?  The marinade is great and I'll definitely use it again.  I did add a bit of chili paste to the marinade to give it a little zip.  Thanks Estherlita for sharing!

I ended up marinating the chicken for about an hour.  Fabulous taste!!  I also added red pepper flakes for a little heat.  The peanut sauce was especially good.  My husband didn't like the sauce so much, I ended up cutting the sauce recipe in half.  It makes quite a bit.

This is a review for the sauce ONLY.  I used natural creamy peanut butter, because I had no chunky, but I doubt it changes the flavor.  The sauce was AWESOME.  It went really well with another chicken satay that I made.

Very good. Chicken came out very moist. Marinated for 1 hour and baked in oven on a rack placed on cookie sheet at 375F for 18 minutes, turning occasionaly. Will make again. Thank you.

I have to confess to not being much of a cook, buy my daughter and I, who is 7, made a pact to cook meals from various locations around the world.  We decided our first would be an Indonesian meal of sorts.  I probably just got lucky but this was restuarant style chicken, some of the best I have ever had.  I will definitely be adding this recipe to my personal fav list.

Just to note I marinated overnight and through most of the next day until cooking time, about 20 hours in all, and everything turned out just fine.  The marinade is simply a fantastic taste, flavor, and consistency.

The only aspect of the recipe I might try to improve on next time around is the dipping sauce.  It wasnt that it was awful, in fact it was pretty good and went quite well with the chicken, but I might play around with a few more spices and flavorings and definitely cut down on the amount of peanut butter used--maybe 1/4 cup next time.

I would recommend this recipe to anyone, or to impress relatives or friends coming in for the weekend.  Two big thumbs up.  Indonesian rice compliments this quite well.

Final note--probably a piece of chicken, or two skewers of chicken per person would be a good estimate.  I had three pieces of chicken breast cut in long halves to make 6 and it didnt quite feed 3 adults and 2 children.

I made this for a family dinner and everyone really enjoyed it - even the kids!  The marinade was not too spicy but very flavorable and the peanut sauce was fabulous.  I usually change recipes slightly to adjust for my taste but no adjustment was needed on this one.  I got raves from the in-laws which is not always heard of.

I was so excited to see that an Indonesian posted this recipe : ) You can't get more authentic than this!! This is the best tasting satay I've ever had outside of Indonesia and my friends, who've also had this in Indonesia, RAVED about it. It's a must try!

Excellent!  Ours cooked in 5 minutes total and certainly did not need the peanut sauce.  I did make a peanut sauce that I put over cooked rice noodles and heated frozen stir-fry vegetables.  For my peanut sauce I used about 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter then added to taste somewhere around 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce, 2 tables spoons of white sugar, a tablespoon of rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon of chili oil, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder, and about 1/2 cup warm water.

This is easy and tasty!  I used Ketchup for the tomato sauce, sesame oil instead of peanut oil (I don't have any), marinated in the fridge for 5 hours.  Turned out great with Korean rice on the side.

Wonderful! This recipe was simple to prepare and garnered rave reviews from our dinner guests. No hard-to-find ingredients or complicated cooking procedures, just pure and simple deliciousness. I did slightly increase the amount of peanut butter in the sauce, and next time I make it I will probably also increase the onion slightly as well. I served this with plain steamed rice and Hot-and-Sour Slaw (you can find the recipe here)... all in all, a wonderful Indonesian-inspired meal.

Go ahead and try this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and we loved it.  I broiled the chicken skewers and I can't wait to try it on the grill for the added flavor.  I let the peanut sauce cook down a bit to get a thicker consistency.  I served this with a sweet and sour style cucumber salad and that was a fabulous compliment to the chicken.

I used the marinade on both chicken (as called for in the recipe) and tenderized cubes of beef, and it was wonderful.  The sauce was good too, I doubled the amount of peanut butter.  They didn't last long on the platter!

Wow! I've never made a satay before but you can bet I'll be making this again and again now. My husband and I loved it! We were torn between eating just the marinated chicken and dipping it in the sauce - both were so great. I did marinate the chicken for 4 hours which made it very tender.

This was good and not too hard to make, but it was just okay. The sauce was better with a bit more peanut butter. I didn't have peanut oil, so I used sesame oil to still give it that nutty flavor. Overall, the marinade for the chicken just didn't go with the peanut sauce. My boyfriend hated it, but thought it was okay and would give it a 4. I feel like if I could still use the peanut sauce, but I wouldn't use the marinade again.

it was really good.. everybody loved it! i added grated ginger and melted butter. since i dont have grill, i put the satay in the oven for 5 mins each side and i cooked it using cast iron frying pan. for the sauce, i like it better without onion and sugar, instead i used sweet soy sauce.

So easy to make and delicous! Im a huge fan of satays and I am always looking for new ideas. I added some Siracha chillie sauce  and lime zest to peaut sauce for a little twist. Goes great with a side of noodles and veggies.....all could be done in less than and hr. easy, quick, and flavorful.

The peanut sauce didn't do it for me, but holy moly the chicken is incredible! I marinated it for an hour, and it was perfect. Next time, I will skip the sauce...there is more than enough flavor in the dish already.

Absolutely fantastic recipe - the peanut sauce is brilliant, as tasty as (if not more so) than the satay sauces you get in restaurants!  A total favourite, everyone I make it for (and believe it if I can make it then I will make it!) loves this.

Thanks so much for sharing it Stephanie!

Excellent recipe.  I, too, added more peanut butter to make it thicker.  I also added ALOT of red pepper flakes to make is more spicy.

Excellent recipe- satisfied the whole family. Used a package of thin-sliced chicken breast and it grilled up very quickly.  I would recommend cutting the peanut sauce recipe in half, we had quite a bit left.

Love this wonderful recipe.  Too cold to grill so I broiled them.  I used extra chunky peanut butter.  I subbed ketchup for the tomato sauce, out of peanut oil so I used 1 teaspoon sesame oil and 2 teaspoons canola oil. Served with Basmati rice and peas. This will be made often!

To make the peanut sauce another authentic version, add a little milk and stir it on the stove to thicken it.  Also, my Indonesian husband adds a spice packet, that, among other things, has shallot, powered coriander seed and lemon (grass?) in it.  Give those ingredients a try for an authentic and unique flavor!      When I've eaten satay sitting on the floor of a little on the roadside warung in Indo, they serve it with fresh limes, little green chiles and shallots to chomp on.  Taste explosion.      By the way it is usually threaded on very thin sticks and about 12 sticks per person on a plate with tons of peanut sauce dripping over it. It is sometimes made with rabbit as well as chicken.    Serve with homemade deep fried tempeh  yummmmm

I did not have any peanut oil so I susbtituted sesame oil in the marinade and let it go for about 6 hours, this worked great I would have even gone 8 hours if I had the time!  I thought the taste was subtle but appreciated my 3 year old LOVED them and my 1 year old could not get enough of the sauce, which by the way extremely good.

I wouldn't change a thing! Everyone loved this satay - from my 18 month old, to my 6 year old who eats nothing, to my satay-snob husband who "only eats the good stuff". I worried that there wasn't enough marinade for my huge bowl of cubed chicken, and I worried that 15 minutes wouldn't be long enough for a good marinade, but I am happy to say my worries were unfounded! I ended up marinating for an hour, and that was more than plenty of time. The chicken was flavorful, tender and moist - even without the peanut sauce, which was awesome too. GREAT recipe, thanks Estherlita!

This was really good.   I have been trying to find a good Peanut sauce recipe for some time and this is definitely the one now.  The chicken was awesome too, I added a bit of Cayenne to kick them up a bit.

Great Recipe!  Thanks

This was great. I tried both a chicken and prawns version. Even without barbequing it, it was very tasty stir-fried.  Next time I'll add a few vegies too.

This is a fabulous dish! We don't have a grill so just did the satays in the oven. Still great. Our kids didn't like them, but they are very picky eaters so that was no surprise. Will be making these often! Thank-you Estherlita!

Although I didn't have a grill, the chicken still tasted great. I did fry them in peanut oil to give it  more of a peanut taste since I couldn't have the charcoal taste. My only problem with this recipe is the sauce. It was too runny for my taste and not enough peanut flavor. I think I'll use the chicken marinade but continue using the peanut sauce I grew up with. Served with rice and cucumber salad.

Chicken needed to be marinated longer, tasted very bland. The peanut sauce was different however I thought it was missing something, not quite sure what it could be!! Maybe just salt!

I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, but kept everything else the same. The recipe made WAY too much sauce, I could have made a quarter recipe and been fine.

Tonight the only thing my 6 year old wanted for dinner was ramen noodles (a rare delicacy to him) so I made him this with a side of ramen. Much to my surprise, the only thing left on his plate at the end of dinner was the ramen. He then proceeded to tell me how "yummy" the chicken was. He's right. It's very yummy... and I love how easy and quick it is to make. Thanks for the recipe!

Truely authentic taste made just the way it states! Just like our fav Indonesian restaurant. The only difference I made in the recipe was used lime juice instead of lemon, I didn't have lemons. And creamy peanut butter for the sauce, didn't have crunchy. We loved it!

real good marinate (I let it sit longer) - very yum. Doesn't even need the dip. I liked the dip, my husband doesn't think chicken & peanut butter have much in common.

This is a great recipe! I added extra peanut butter because it was too watery at first and I let it simmer for a while to thicken up. I also added a little dash of red pepper flakes to give it a little heat. I marinated the chicken for about 30 min instead of the recommended 15 min and it turned out great. There was a lot of flavor and the peanut sauce was excellent!

I used this recipe only for the peanut butter sauce.  I used Adam's chunky peanut butter and it was delicious.  My fiance couldn't get enough.

This was ok but I was expecting a little more based on prior reviews.  The marinade was quite good, however the peanut butter sauce just didn't seem to go well with this chicken.  Worth trying once, but probably won't make again.

Yow-zah, what a recipe! The marinade for the chicken was delightful! And I love it that you don't have to marinate it for hours on end. I am not always so good at planning dinner a day in advance so this recipe was perfect for me. And even with the short marinating time, there is NO scrimping on the taste! Oh and did I mention how heavenly the peanut sauce is? My husband said that he has had lots of good chicken skewers at restaurants but none of them even compare to these! This is definately a keeper. Absolutely delicious! Thank you!!

I did not care for this at all. The chicken turned out dry (I'm assuming from the peanut butter). It was very messy and it had too much of a peanut taste to it. Maybe I let it marinade too long (2 days). I will not make it again though.

We absolutely loved this, cooked on the charcoal grill--outstanding.  This satay is a hundred times better than what we've had at a local French-Vietnamese restaurant.  I served with the Indonesian Spiced Rice and Asian slaw (both on this site).  What a great meal!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes!  Parents, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, friends, husband and children all eat this and love it!  We love the peanut sauce too, and I always double it.  Add more tabasco to the sauce for some kick.  I make this all the time and it is always fantastic, regardless of how long it marinates (a few hours or overnight), how much I make (I have quadrupled it for a party for 80 people and it was gobbled up with people begging for more!), or whether it is broiled in the oven or grilled outside.  We love this!

The chicken was really moist and easy to eat off of the skewers (I used water soaked wood skewers). The sauce was good, but rather thin. I was hoping for a thicker sauce. I also made Fresh Spring Rolls with Thai Dipping Sauce from this site to accompany the satay. These are good as an appetizer, however because it only consists of chicken, they aren't so good as a main meal. I scaled the recipe in half, yet still used 5 skewers worth of chicken (I only loaded the top half of the skewers with chicken to make a sort of chicken popsicle). Great for cookouts.

I made this without the peanut sauce, but it still came out great. The chicken was very tender. I didn't have cumin, so I added the same amount of sage instead. I boiled the leftover marinade and used some of it to spoon over the chicken after in was on the plates. Even my husband, who doesn't care for chicken liked this.

I made this recipe for a party of almost thirty people, and there wasnt a single skewer left at the end of the night. The meat came out very tender, and the marinade added just the right flavor to the chicken. I did make the peanut sauce, and thought it was not good at all, so I didnt encourage my guests to try it. Luckily, the chicken stood alone, and didnt need a dipping sauce. I'll make the marinade again, and keep searching for another peanut sauce recipe.

This turned out great and pretty easy to make. Definitely don't marinate too long- I marinated for about 3 hours and it was almost too salty/strong. My husband loved them, too.

During our yearly outing to Cedar Point, a group of us (17 people) all contribute to a pot luck for the 3 nights of meals. I made this Indonesian Satay and it went over big time! I made a big batch and used some pork along with the chicken since one of the people was not fond of chicken. Was a great change from the standard hamburgers or steaks and was easy to make ahead of the trip so little prep was needed away from the fun. Would absolutely make again.

I, too, loved the marinade! It's so good, you don't even need the sauce. My sauce was too thick and not my taste, so I'll keep looking for a sauce. I'll use the marinade again and again.

This recipe is SO simple and delicious.  Chicken satay is one of my absolute favorite things and I have been searching for a really long time for the perfect peanut sauce recipe.  The marinade makes this chicken so delicious and flavorful that you don't even need the peanut sauce, but putting the chicken on jasmine rice with the peanut sauce gets RAVE reviews every time.

The chicken was wonderfully moist and flavorful but I wasn't really a big fan of the dipping sauce. I may browse for another recipe for that. I will definitely be making the chicken again though. Delicious. Thank you so much for sharing.

Just what I was looking for! I sliced the chicken breasts in strips, gave 'em a couple of whacks with the mallet, then threaded them onto the skewers. I don't have an outdoor grill, so I just popped them on the Foreman for 2 minutes a side and VOILA! Thanks Stephanie!

Yum... This was different for me. I didn't have any peanut oil so I just used vegetable oil, everything else was exactly as the recipe called for. I grilled on med-high heat though, as I have a tendancy to burn things on a propane grill. I definatly recommend you try this.

This chicken was great although less spicy than I expected.  Next time I will give it a kick and marinate for more than 15 min.

I turned out horrible but it was my fault. here are some tips for you so that you don't make the same mistakes as me. I was out of propane so I used the broiler in the oven. It overcooked the chicken horribly. Use a grill if you can. Don't leave in the marinade too long either, it will dry the chicken. If you are going to err to either side of the cooking spectrum, undercook these, then finish them in a warm oven if they are too pink. 
The peanut sauce was incredible. I will make this again, but do it right next time. Here's five stars, because you weren't at my house the night that I ruined a perfectly good recipe.

This is soooo good. I've already used this recipe several times. Following the exact recipe makes good results. What I do different, however, is I add a teaspoon or so of red pepper flakes for that extra kick. I also sprinkle finely chopped cilantro over it after cooking (yum, yum!) Also, I've tried it with smooth peanut butter and that works fine, too. When I don't have time to grill, I pan fry the marinated chicken then toss it in the peanut sauce. I loooove this recipe!!!

The chicken was awesome, I was not that impressed with the peanut sauce. If I make it again, I will use creamy peanut butter and make a significantly smaller amount - we had cups and cups of peanut sauce I ended up throwing out.

WONDERFUL!  My dad was born in Indonesia and I ate these growing up as a child.  I did add 1/2 tsp of Red Pepper Flakes to the marinade and marinated for most of the day.  I also cut the water back on the peanut sauce to 1/2 cup as others recommended - it was awesome...!

This recipe is amazing!  I used this for a catering event and it got rave reviews.   People were eating the Peanut Sauce with some of our other menu items.  If you're lucky enough to have any leftovers...it's great in a tortilla with ranch dressing and topped with the peanut sauce.  I added a bit of cayenne to the peanut sauce to spice it up a bit.

This is exellent, the peanut sauce is wonderful, but the recipe makes lots. Also, I saute the onion and garlic in sesame oil and add a litle to the sauce to give it a little taste and it is very good this way. I have made this many times and it alsways a HIT!

This is one of the best recipes I have tried on this site.  Instead of barbecueing the chicken I sauteed it on the stove in a non-stick pan.  I poured the sauce over the chicken which I served over stir-fried veggies and small seashell pasta.  It was phenomenal.

My husband enjoyed this.  I thought the sauce could have used a bit more of a kick, maybe ginger or cayenne or pepper flakes or something.  Perhaps it would have been better with a little less water.

Very good, and easy.  I had to use cashew butter because of a peanut allergy in my house, and it tasted great even with the different nut-flavor.  Also I cooked the chicken strips under the broiler since my bbq wasn't working.  Very rich and filling.

Wonderful, easy & tasty!  The tomato sauce adds an extra tang not found in other satay recipes.

This Indonesian Satay recipe was so delicious! I was surprised that the very-simple-to-prepare soy-tomato-cumin marinade for the chicken tasted so exotic. My husband thought that the chicken tasted excellent on its own without the peanut sauce, and in fact he packed the leftovers for his lunch that way. I thought the peanut sauce tasted good without the sugar, but my husband didn't agree. The only change I made to this recipe was to substitute the 2 tablespoons of sugar with 1 tablespoon of honey. We will definitely be making this recipe again many, many more times. Thank you Estherlita Suryoputro for introducing us to Indonesian Satay.

The chicken was OK, and the sauce was bland. The recipe sounded so good and I really thought I would love it.

This was delicious!!! It is one of the rare dishes that gets five-stars from all members of the family: from the picky 6-year old to the picky 48-year old and the two epicurians in between. I marinated the chicken for 20 minutes and did not have tomato sauce but the marinated chicken alone was wonderful. The peanut sauce gave it the wow. I ate mine with a little cilantro on top. Fabulous and easy.

If you don't have tomato sauce you can use ketchup and it tastes the same!  I also used sesame oil instead of peanut b/c that is what I had.  It was delicious!

A great recipe! I make this once a week. I don't make the peanut sauce. I'm not a fan of it. It just tastes like peanut butter, and I can't taste any of the other flavours so I don't make it. 
The marinade for the chicken is amazing! I would give it 5 stars alone! I usually let it marinade for 4 hours but I've even done 24 hrs while taking it camping.  I make it as written but I use toasted sesame seed oil instead of peanut oil and I add red chili peppers bc we like a little heat. I bbq the chicken or I'll make it on the stove as a stir fry. I like to serve this on top of sticky rice or along a salad.

Really good and easy to do! Didn't have tomato sauce, so I used ketchup instead. Also added a pinch of garlic powder, gala powder, and salt.

The peanut sauce is great. I wasn't sure of the minced onion, but it made the sauce more "hearty." Also added red pepper flakes, and simmered for a thicker consistency.

delish - made it exactly as written except with chicken tenders instead of cubes.  Didn't know how I felt about the tomato sauce in the marinade, but it made a really delicious tender chicken.  The sauce made my kids really happy - they said it tasted just like the sauce at the thai restaurant they like!  I would make this again with no changes, it was really good!

I added more garlic to the marinade, and more soy sauce to the peanut sauce, used creamy instead of chunky peanut butter and the pureed it in a food processor because the chopped onion made it more chunky than my kids would eat. EXCELLENT recipe!

This was good.  I marinated for about an hour.  Hubby thought it was fantastic.  I had enough chicken left over to make big salads the next night, and it was super yummy that way too.  Will put this in my rotation!

I thought the chicken turned out delicious and the peanut sauce was tasty, but the flavors didn't meld that well for me compared to other satay recipes.  The chicken was really some of the best I've had and will probably make this recipe again.

Peanut sauce needs less water (try 1/2 cup next time) and a few dashes of curry powder to give the sauce a nice undertone.  Otherwise, very good recipe!

This recipe is soooo good!  I made a few alterations.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, left them whole and put them on skewers.  Because the pieces were larger than the recipe calls for, I let them grill a bit longer to ensure that they were cooked through.  The sauce is wonderful!  We like things spicy so I added heat with dried red pepper flakes.  I served it over white rice and poured the sauce over the skewered chicken, that way the sauce could drip down into the rice.  I will make this again and again...it is very tasty!

This marinade is simply amazing! It is so simple and doesn't require having special exotic ingredients on hand. I substituted regular canola oil for the peanut oil and made my own tomato sauce using a squeeze of tube tomato paste and water. It still tastes just wonderful. I also added some red pepper flakes for heat. I'm also surprised how much flavor this gives the chicken without a very long marinade time.

Yeah! Another dish my picky daughter enjoyed! We had fun preparing it together and she enjoyed eating it as well. The only thing is she would prefer non chunky peanut butter...I enjoyed the chunky peanut butter though. We will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe.  My daughter loves it too.  I love the way it presents.  I have always been a huge fan of peanut sauce and have tried making several versions, this one came out perfect.  I did make a few alterations...I used olive oil instead of peanut oil. I also didn't have chunky so I used smooth, as well no tomato sauce, but did have a can of very bland spaghetti sauce.  Low sodium soy sauce, stevia instead of sugar, and didn't have lemon juice, thought about using the lime I had, but the sauce was already great without it.  Added a tad more cumin than called for. Cooked in the oven on a grilling pan.  Served with steamed broccoli and brown rice.

'just finished making this.  The tastes are rather bland for both marinade and sauce.  I added honey and another pinch of cumin and some salt.  (Next time I'll use much more cumin.)  I cubed the chicken.  Before bringing it to a neighborhood gathering, I'll add red pepper flakes to the dipping sauce and thicken it.   WITHOUT USING THE DIPPING SAUCE, this cubed satay chicken would go great atop a salad for lunch....it's easy and quick to make and can be made beforehand.

So good!  The marinade on the chicken is wonderful by itself; very flavorful.  But we loved the satay sauce too.  I cut the chicken in strips and threaded onto skewers for the grill.  Fast, easy and yummy!  Thanks!

Maybe the use of peanut butter not right for this recipe. Because it's butter, the taste and the texture doesn't match the original taste of indonesian satay. Try the original peanut sauce recipe: blend with dry mill about 9 ounces fried peanut, 1 inch fried turmeric, 6 red chillies, 2 clove of fried garlic, and 1 ounce palm sugar. Wet this peanut paste with 100 ml warm water. Sprinkle it with fried onion slices.

The marinade was awesome, though I think you should add some blended onions/lemon grass with water to it. The sauce was awesome, needed less water as I had to boil the mixture for a minute and add some cornstarch so that it didn't end up looking like soup

The chicken came out great, but the sauce was a little dull. I did use an organic peanut butter, so maybe some more sugar would have helped the taste/consistency.

This was excellent!  I read most of the reviews, and many of them said they didn't care for the peanut sauce, so I used a different recipe for that.  However, I followed the marinade recipe to the T, and oh my God...  It didn't even need the dipping sauce!  So quick and easy.  We'll definitely be eating this on a regular basis.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I doubled this recipe and brought it to a party. After I put it out to serve, I went into the other room for a second; when I came back it was all gone! I will definitely make this again.

Amazing!  Had guests over and did a few chicken skewers for appetizers - absolutely delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing and we will certainly be making this again!  Peanut sauce was wonderful.

This was easy and delicious.  I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours in a plastic bag and added about 1/4 tsp. cumin.  I decreased the amount of water and soy sauce in the peanut sauce so that it wouldn't be too watery/too salty.  I probably wouldn't make the dip again because my family wasn't really crazy about it.

Excellent. I used my George Forman grill cooked in 5 minutes. Tender, juicy chicken. Recipe makes you look like a master chef. My man was very pleased. I prefer Olive oil to vegetable oil and brown sugar to white sugar. I also increased the soy sauce in the peanut sauce to decrease the peanut butter flavor. I might toy with using half the peanut butter next time but dinner was a big hit! If you are looking for another variation to the 365 days of chicken this is it!

This is now among my top favorite grilled chicken recipes! Big hit. I got ahead of myself and skipped the step of sauteeing the garlic & onions, etc. I just put everything in the marinade and only marinated for 20 min. I added a pinch of Korean red pepper powder and it really added a subtle punch.

IMPORTANT!!! Do NOT use natural peanut butter! I used a mixture of natural and jiffy peanut butter (to finish one jar) and the natural did not mix/melt well. 
Despite my ignorance, this meal turned out extremely brilliant-thank you very much!

This is good. A really delicious mix of flavors. I made it twice. I loke warmer dishes so the second time I added 1/4 cup of Frank's red hot because I like a tangy kick as well. Either way...it is really delicious. Bon a` Petite!

This was a great dinner served with brown rice.  All ages from 9-46 loved it.  I doubled the sauce and loved the chunky peanut butter in it. The marinade was excellent and would even try it using whole chicken breasts.

Tastes just like the satay I enjoyed while living in The Netherlands, where Indonesian food is quite common. My husband and I are were close friends with an Indonesian man there and this reminds me of the many meals we shared with him and his Dutch wife. Satay was often on the menu, along with rice of course. The only difference is that this satay was very tender and moist, and the satay you'd get in the little Indonesian restarants was often dry and tough. This is a great recipe.

Really good, and very family friendly.  I followed some other suggestions and cut the water in half, but the sauce came out much thicker than I anticipated.

I just made the peanut sauce to go with another recipe.  I have yet to make the meat component, but let me say that the dipping sauce was FANTASTIC...I could of eaten it with a spoon (and I did)).  I added extra peanut butter to make it thick.  GREAT dipping sauce, and I look forward to making the remainder of this dish.

Hands down THE BEST SATAY recipe I have tried. This is the closest I've had to when I travelled in SE Asia. So authentic. The chicken marinade is so good that the chicken is DELISH even without the to-die-for peanut sauce. I like to garnish with some fresh cilantro. Use leftovers for an Asian Chicken Salad. Yum!

not a bad recipe, but not great either. The chicken was bland, and the peanut sauce was thicker than I prefer for satay dipping and the peanut smell and flavor was a bit overpowering, but I'm more used to Vietnamese style peanut sauce. However, this recipe is easy to make and the chicken remained moist, so give it a try. Thanks for sharing.

I made the satay with chicken breasts and chicken legs and they turned out yummy. Although this isn't the best satay I've ever had and the peanut sauce isn't that great but I'm quite satisfied with the result :) Thanks for sharing !! :) Cheers :)

This was a very easy recipe to make.  The peanut sauce tasted too sweet when first prepared, but I made it a few hours ahead, and by the time I served it, the peanut sauce was delicious and not too sweet. 
I thought the marinade would flavor the chicken more, but the chicken was a little bland.

I once tried a homemade peanut sauce and have not been able to even smell peanuts since.  So I made this recipe without the peanut sauce.  This was very good chicken.  The kids and my husband devoured it.  I would agree that this dish is best with a short marinade time.

It was very nice - although not the best satay I've had I'll most likely make it again some time.  I made it with chicken drumsticks (no skewers) and it worked out fine.  I would however recommend that you don't thicken up the sauce as some reviewers recommend, as it became somewhat overpowering with cornflour in it - I think a thinner sauce would allow the more subtle flavours to come through, not just peanut butter.  Overall a great recipe.

I only ever tried the marinade (I use a different peanut sauce to save time,) but this recipe turned out really well and I have made it more than once. The tomato sauce adds an interesting dimension but does not make it too tomato-y. I do add some crushed red pepper to the marinade as I like things a little spicy, but that's about it.

This was very good, but like other reviewers I found the sauce to be too watery. Next time I will definitely cut down on the amount of water. Good otherwise.

I used thin steak instead of chicken and cut it into narrow strips.  Marinated for about 4 hours.  I didn't have any cumin, so I subsituted about 1/8 tsp curry powder. 
Unlike many other reviewers, I made the sauce exactly as called for, and it was remarkably similar to the dipping sauce from our local Indonesian restaurant.  Loved it!
Definitely will make this again! Next time I will try it with chicken, pork, AND steak just like our favorite combo at Surabaya. 
Thanks for a great recipe!

I found this recipe because a few people who reviewd my recipe for "the best thai peanut sauce" on this site said they used my peanut sauce to go with this dish.  It was in fact terrific.  I used tomato paste instead of sauce because that's what I had on hand and I thinned it down with a bit of water.  I also cut the chicken in 1 inch wide stips and skewerred it lenghtwise.  Even my husband, who does not like chicken, liked this.  I will definatly make this again, it was easy and tasted great.

Very simple and delicious recipe. I cut the recipe in half and used only 2 pieces of chicken breast. I did not make the peanut butter sauce. I used a "no cook" sauce found in this website. Will make this recipe again!

Faaaantastic chicken!  I sliced the chicken breasts into strips, marinated overnight, and threaded them onto skewers for my George Foreman grill.  I served this at a birthday party and there were no leftovers.  I didn't make the peanut sauce, and no one seemed to miss it.

I never tried Indonesian food. This is easy and the flavor burst is wonderful. I loved the peanut sauce ,but added a little more soy sauce to it. My husband didn't care for the peanut sauce, however, he really liked the flavor of the chicken. We will be making this again.

The chicken marinade is great, but the sauce was a little too peanut-buttery for me (I guess I was expecting the kind of peanut sauce from Thai restaurants that I love so much).  I would make this again if I could find a sweeter, lighter sauce to dip with instead.  I cooked these on the indoor grill for 6 minutes and they turned out well.

5 Stars!  Recipe is "Company-worthy"...Excellent taste and presentation.  I found peanut sauce thickened over time on stove, but I might cut the water to 1/2 cup next time....  Thanks Estherlita for the fine recipe!

Excellent recipe - a little mild for our taste, but I will add some more hot sauce for next time! I also found the sauce a little thin for my taste and will reduce the amount of water to 1/2 cup.

Fantastic! A wonderful flavourful dish made with the commonest ingredients (well, ok, I left out the peanut oil since I didn't have any, and it still turned out great) that prompted my mom to say, "I never want to go to a restaurant again!" The marinade is excellent, the peanut dipping sauce is wonderful ("I'd eat this by itself on white rice") and the recipe is easy-easy and quick-quick.

BLAND and BORING, that's how the marinade tasted.
I even marinated it all day instead of the recommended 15 minutes but it didn't help.
The peanut sauce was okay but not good enough to make it again.

What a wonderful recipe!!!  I used the thin sliced chicken breast and left it whole.  I did not skewer these.  I loved the sauce but my kids did not.  The left over chicken was great sliced thin and placed on top of a salad!  Also leftover as a sandwich!!!  Just wonderful Thank You!

I made this recipe twice over our Canadian May long weekend.  It received rave reviews from my family...especially my picky 10 year old!  They begged me to make it again, so I did.  My oldest daughter and I liked the Peanut sauce, the rest of my family did not.  The second time I made it, I did not make the sauce.  It was still SCRUPMTIOUS without.  The chicken is so tender...it literally falls off the BBQ skewers.  Thanks so much for this recipe! **I did not have any tomato sauce on hand, so I just substituted Ketchup...it was great.

Add me to the raves. This is a great "pantry meal" if you keep frozen chicken breasts on hand. It's so easy and no unusual ingredients - I had everything on hand.

We loved this!  Marinated about 45 minutes.  Used regular, not chunky peanut butter for the sauce; left out the onions but included a little onion powder.  Served over fried rice.  To make for 2 of us, I used 8 oz. chicken and cut the marinade and sauce recipe in half.  Next time will probably make less sauce, as there was a lot left over, but will probably serve it with grilled pork chops tomorrow.  Never had Satay before, but will definitely have it again!

This was ok, marinade was good and simple but the sauce was pretty bland and tasted to much like peanut butter. I will be sure to add some extra spices next time.

The chicken is amazing and so is the sauce! The flavors in the sauce go together perfectly although the marinated chicken tastes so good it doesn't really need a sauce! I had success using chicken thighs instead of breasts and cooked the chicken with the George foreman. I served it over rice with some steamed broccoli

I normally don't bother rating these, but this one was so good I had to chime in.  I followed the recipe as-is and it was fantastic!  I only marinaded for about an hour but that was plenty of time.  It does make a lot of the dipping sauce, so if you're doubling up, no need to do it for the sauce.  Easy and very tasty.

Excellent recipe !! Easy to make and delicious to eat !! Pretty much went by the recipe with the only change in adding a little bit more peanut butter to the dipping sauce. Meat and dipping sauce were very tasty ! Chicken very moist. Thanks !!

I made this recipe exactly as written and everyone loved it.  For those of you who find the sauce too thin, reduce the amount of water added!  You don't need more peanut butter and you don't need to cook it down, just add the water at the end of your ingredients in small amounts up to a cup until you have reached the right level of thickness for you.  We all found it flavorful and although I  love spicy food, I didn't see the need for adding pepper flakes.  Thanks for a really easy, tasty recipe!

Wow! Made this for dinner tonight and I couldn't get enough of it. Increased the amount of cumin in the marinade, marinaded for 1 hour, and decided not to make the peanut sauce tonight, but I will try it next time I make this. Because we don't have a grill and I didn't want it to burn on the george foreman, I put it under the broiler for eight minutes per side-- juicy, flavorful, and delicious! Not a perfect recipe, but for ease of preparation, you can't beat it.

I lived in Indonesia for eight years, and this peanut sauce is great. It also works well on blanched vegetables (like gado-gado), and a little extra heat from some chilies doesn't hurt it at all!  Estherlita, this recipe has gone all over the world because I have been making it and giving out the recipe since 2004 (2005?). I have served it in Texas, Alaska, Azerbaijan and Turkey.  I have sent the recipe link to friends in Norway and the UK. It's popular everywhere. Thanks for sharing.

I give the chicken a 5* but the sauce a 3*.  The chicken was really good and I would for sure make the chicken again.  I marinated for a few hours and it had a wonderful flavor.  The sauce was as thin as water and did not have very much flavor at all.  When I make this again I wont make the sauce.  I seved the is homeade wonton soup and lettuce wraps... what a great meal!

Family went crazy over the chicken, not so much the peanut sauce. The sauce just tasted like melted peanut butter to me; I couldn't taste anything but that. Might try some other sauce next time. On the whole, this was a big hit, and I will be making this again. It is a little work intensive first time making it, but I figure next time will be easier, and it was well worth the applause I got at dinner!

The marinade was pretty tasty though I only let it sit for about 20 minutes. Next time I'll let it sit a little longer. The peanut sauce was just too peanuty. All it tasted like was peanut. So, I added a little bit more soy sauce and lemon juice (just a little ) and some ginger, cayenne, and sesame oil and it was better. Still not as good as restaurant quality peanut sauce, but it was a little spicier/tangier.

Estherlita - this recipe is spot on - allthough i normally marinate the meat in ketchap manis (sweeet indonesian soy sauce) just to cut a few corners when making dinner. 

Thanks a mill for sharing - I've made this dish using this recipe now umpteen times and cannot praise it enough.

This is so good, the flavors are amazing. I didn't cube my chicken, I sliced each breast into thick strips and marinated for a few hours.  The only change I made was to use more PB as the sauce was too thin for our tastes. I just stirred in extra PB and let it melt in the warm sauce until it was the way we like, maybe another3/4 cup. My husband could not get enough of this! Served this over basmati rice with green onions and with sesame green beans. I'll be making this one again soon!

I enjoyed the "peanut satay" so much while I was in the Dutch Antilles and have been trying different recipes which have all been disappointing.  This one is killer!  There is so much delicious flavor in the marinade and the dipping sauce.  I used natural peanut butter.  I may play with it and change it up but it gets 5 stars from me as is.  Also, I have never rated a recipe on here in about 5 years of use and this one was so good I just had to let you all know!

Really good marinade! My my is an Indo, and this tastes so much like the way my mom and my aunts used to make it. Yummy! I haven't tried the peanut sauce, my family typically makes one using galangaal, but I'm sure this recipe is good too.

We tried this recipe, as my son is preparing to go to Indonesia for the next 2 years.  It was very simple to make and it tasted really good.  Even my picky daughter liked it.  I only marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes.  I used chicken tenders because that's what I had, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken was delicious by itself, but if you are a peanut sauce lover it was delicious.

This was just okay. I marinated for way longer than 15 minutes, but the chicken didn't have much flavor. I did like the sauce but my husband thought it just tasted like straight peanut butter.

I lived in Indonesia for several years. My whole kitchen smelled like the streets of Java after I made this. I grilled the chicken and it still turned out great.  Very authentic. Easy to make. Loved it!

This was good.  I marinated for at least 2 to 3 hours but didn't really taste much on the chicken.  Maybe it's supposed to be a subtle taste?  The peanut sauce was very good too.  I added a little bit of cayenne pepper and I think I will do this the next time to, maybe even a little more, to give it a little of a kick!  Good tender chicken though.

Very good.  I did add some hot curry powder...I don't like chunky peanut butter, so I used creamy....Also, I added extra garlic...I think it would be really good with some hot pepper flakes....It was unusual and yet I really enjoyed it and so did my dinner company!

DELICIOUS!!!! The whole family liked it! I marinated for maybe 40 minutes, and only had smart balance oil instead of peanut oil, everything else I did just like the recipe said! I'm sure I'll be making this at least a few times a month! sooooo goood

This is one of the very few recipes I've given 5 stars to.  I could have eaten this all day.  I made a huge batch so that I'd have leftovers but the 5 in our family gobbled almost all of it up.  The chicken with the peanut sauce is just delish.  I also used a lime - no other changes.  THANKS ESTHERLITA!!!

This was very yummy. I just cooked the chicken in a pan because it was too cold outside for the grill. I also had  an emergency in the middle of marinating, so it marinated for about 4-5 hours and was still delish. The peanut butter sauce was yummy too!

I loved this recipe. The chicken was very tender and the sauce had a fantastic taste. The only (very small) issue for me was that the sauce was a little too thin, so next time I will reduce the water to 3/4 of a cup or so.

I was surprised at how good the chicken tasted given the simplicity of the marinade, but it turned out very flavorful and moist. I just put whole chicken tenders on the skewers instead of cubing and used my indoor grill plate. The chicken came out great, but I didn't enjoy the peanut butter sauce, which you really don't need anyway because the chicken is good on its own.

I made the marinade as is, but only used 1 Tbsp soy sauce in the peanut butter sauce.  Grilled the chicken on an indoor grill.  My kids liked the chicken without the pb sauce, my husband and I enjoyed it with the sauce. Served with butter chickpea curry from this site.

Very similar to what you'd get if you ordered peanuty chicken satay at a restaurant.  The chicken wasn't overly flavorful, but that is what the peanut sauce is for.

I wish this site would allow you to give 1/2 stars.  This recipe has been in my box for a while.  It is really delicious.  I did not cut it into strips, but left the chicken whole.  The peanut sauce was great.  I used smooth instead of chunky because I didn't have chunky peanut butter.  Very good and tasty.  I will make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is wonderful!  I added a little cumin, ginger, cayenne pepper and a little extra peanut butter to the peanut butter sauce.  The chicken with the marinade alone was delicious though we loved the sauce with the chicken, as well as rice and broccoli.  Thanks for a great recipe!

this is unbeleivable if you like peanut sauce.  I add tabasco to the sauce because I like it spicy.  It is absolutely a must to cook over barbecue.  Love it ! Love it ! Love it !

Delicious and authentic.  My family couldn't get enough.  I was lazy, so I just used whole chicken tenders and marinated them longer (1 hour). This worked great.

Pretty mild flavor. I would probably make it again as it was enjoyable. Not the best I've had but pretty good.

Tasty recipe. Like other reviewers I ommited making the peanut sauce and opted instead to make a sub out of the chicken, with fresh cilantro, cucumbers and thai garlic chili hot sauce. Will definetly make again.

Very good, and easy.  In response to the reviwer who cautioned against natural peanut butter...that is all I use and it worked fine.  It wasn't mixing well at the beginning, but use a whisk and there is no problem.

Don't know what all the rave reviews are all about. The peanut sauce was terrible.  The marinade for the chicken was just okay. I've had better. I wound up making plain shish-ka-bobs with the chicken with yellow peppers and onions.

All I can say is "WOW". This recipe was great. I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breast because they are juicier. But I will keep this recipe close at hand. Thank you for sharing. Dawn

Did two chicken breasts so cut everything to 1/3. Marinated for only about 15 mins and it was very good. Quick, no planning needed... will definately make again!

I only did the marinade portion of this recipe...and it was absolutely wonderful! I marinated the chicken for several hours and skewered it just before grilling. Not a drop left! I do think I will up the spice next time as we like our satay pretty perky, but it is great as is.

I substituted sesame oil for the peanut oil and chinese five spice for cumin. Also instead of cubing the chicken I cut it in strips. It was tasty, i just wasn't crazy about the peanut sauce.

I added a little more ketchup for a touch more sweetness, and marinated it for about 2 hours. Cooked them on the Foreman grill, and they turned out great. The peanut sauce was ok but not great. I've had better. Thanks!

Yum, the chicken was wonderful--even my children loved it!! We didn't use the peanut sauce though, instead used Best Peanut Sauce (which wasn't a big hit with my family, thank goodness it was just dip on the side).

Thank you!  This was excellent, and even my husband said it was a keeper.  He loves satay and thought this was really good.  I even messed up and added the lemon juice to the sauce during cooking, and it didn't seem to matter.  We might add a little chili paste next time for a some kick.

I felt there was a flavour missing in the satay sauce. Maybe it's because I am used to having a more Thai style satay sauce made with coconut milk & ginger. That aside it was still a very tasty satay recipe.

Thank you for sharing this receipe!  As a couple of other reviewers mentioned, I added a TBS. of Peanut butter to the marinade to enhance that great peanut flavor.  The meal was wonderful and I will definately make this again.  Even if you chose to not make/serve the peanut sauce-- the marinade is wonderful by itself.  It left the chicken moist and flavorful.

The 5 stars is for the fantastic marinade.  My husband is allergic to chicken so I cubed some pork tenderloin.  It was amazing.  I'm sure the whole neighborhood was salivating.  The peanut sauce wasn't really to my taste, but peanut sauce is highly subjective.

We thought this was excellent.  I made it while camping a few weeks ago and we cooked the skewers over the open flame.  YUMMY!  It was so good I made it again the following weekend when my son & daughter-in-law came for dinner.  THANKS for the recipe!

This is a good recipe, but it was really no different than some of the Thai chicken recipes that I already have.  It's a good peanut chicken recipe if you don't already have one though.

It's pretty good. Not the best satay I had ever tried, but close enough. The peanut sauce is passable. Coming from Singapore (now living in FL), I prefer the traditional sauce using roasted peanuts.

This recipe is one of the very few chicken breast recipes I actually like.  The chicken becomes very tender and not dry.  This dish will appear on my table when guests arrive.  Thank you for sharing.

This was very tasty!  Did't have tomato sauce so used about 1/2 cup tomato juice instead in the marinade.  Also used rice vinegar instead of lemon juice in sauce.  Next time will use low sodium soy sauce and a little less garlic as it was a little salty for our taste and there was more garlic flavor than we prefer.  Loved the sauce!  Will definitely make again with those changes.

The chicken was REALLY good.  This only gets two stars because of the peanut sauce.  We had the sauce with dinner but threw it away.  I suggest making the chicken exactly as stated but use a different peanut sause.  Make the sauce from the chicken satay recipe from this site and use it for dipping.

I made this twice last year, and while I loved the chicken, I was not so crazy about the sauce.  It was OK, but not great.  I recently came across Stephanie M's "The Best Thai Peanut Sauce" recipe, and I used that in a stir fry...the sauce was just perfect, truly wonderful.

So, the perfect marriage is this chicken marinade and "The Best Thai Peanut Sauce".  

I actually came here to post this, and I saw that Stephanie basically said the same thing the other day!

Made the marinaded chicken skewers for dinner tonight and my boyfriend and I LOVED it. The chicken was perfect: moist, flavorful, just right. IMPORTANT: One reviewer noted that it's important to SOAK SKEWERS prior to grilling/broiling. I soaked mine for ten minutes before threading the chicken, but when I put the chicken under the broiler the ends still charred and made an unpleasant smell. It turns out you're supposed to soak wood skewers for FOR 2 HOURS! I'll definitely be doing that next time.

Just made this last night and it was fantastic. I only used 3 chicken breasts, but we made everything else as though we were using the full recipe. The peanut dipping sauce was so good we ate all of it! Instead of grilling, we put on a rack, on a baking sheet and put it under the broiler. The chicken was moist and tasty.

Really good and immensely enjoyed by company AND kids. If you use wooden skewers, BE SURE TO SOAK THEM IN WATER or they will burn and char and be very unappetizing.

I would have given this 5 stars, but personally I like my food spicy.  Next time I will add some red pepper flakes or thai sauce to the marinade to heat it up. Otherwise a fantastic recipe!

I made this recipe for a party I was catering, and I got rave reviews on how everyone loved my chicken!  I did add some Tabasco and fish sauce to give the marinade a little more kick, but other than that I stuck with the recipe.  I do agree it makes tons of peanut sauce though.  I have lots left over, but I figure I'll use what I can now and stick the rest in the freezer.  All in all, great!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I too spiced up the chicken with red pepper and let it marinate for an hour.  I would probably let it marinade longer next time.  The peanut sauce was good, but I had another taste in mind - a little too thick and I reduced the water as other reviewers suggested.  I also added some cayenne to the peanut sauce to spicen it up a bit.  Very good - will definitely make it again!

Wonderful is all I can say! Even the kids loved it with the dipping sauce. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours and grilled it on the BBQ. We like spicy food so next time I might add a few hot pepper flakes to the marinade or the sauce. Thank you Estherlita! We will certainly enjoy this recipe time and time again!

Out of preference for dark meat, I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs for this yummy recipe. Due to a busy schedule, the meat marinaded all day and was then cooked on a George Foreman Grill.  Absolutely delicious, and very tender.  My husband said he could eat it every day for a week!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great! I love the sauce and how flavorful it was. I marinated the chicken longer because I really wanted the flavor through and through; this did not disappoint! I was a bit scared because the breast is not my favorite cut, but this was very nice. Thank you for sharing!

Í have made this one so many times and people love it every time. Since we don’t eat meat anymore I swapped the chicken for white fish. The fish must be a bit firm and it’s even better if it’s a bit fatty. With the fish I never bother with the sticks. I also use normal neutral oil instead of the peanut oil, since I always forget to buy it.

It saucy was very tasty but the chicken needs a little more flavour so that if someone is eating it alone it would have flavour.

Wow! I served this with a load of stir fried vegetables and wholewheat noodles. Such a tasty, health meal. Totally cured my cravings for a delivery and cheaper and tastier. Thank you, this recipe is a keeper! We let the peanut sauce down with fat free plain yogurt, which gave it a little more sharpness.

I haven't tried this yet but I'm thinking it sounds good. I will probably add a little heat in the form of some sambal mixed with the peanut butter. Yumm! Who's hungry?

For years I have been searching for a recipe to mimic the satay my childhood friend’s mother would make. She was originally from Indonesia and this recipe as written perfectly resembles that memory. Delicious on chicken, beef and shrimp.

the satay peanut sauce was way too sweet.  try starting with one teaspoon and work up from there.  I also added some red curry paste to the peanut sauce to give it a little kick. also, i would suggest lime juice instead of lemon...it is more authentic tasting that way.   overall, the marinade and the chicken turned out delicious!   good dish with some tweaks

Everyone loved this. The marinade was the perfect amount, the chicken was tender, and the peanut sauce is yummy. I made this on a cold snowy day, so used a contact grill. I used the leftover sauce (my daughter ate the chicken w/o sauce) for Delicious Pan-Fried Baka Bana on this site.

Wonderful recipe and I followed the directions exactly, except used lower sodium soy sauce. Thanks to the author for submitting this simple but delicious dish. I made Indian seasoned rice to go with it.

This recipe was awesome! I made this with pork and doubled the marinade so we could have plenty of leftovers. Will definitely make this again.

So good!  I, too, like a thicker peanut sauce so I halved the amount of water. This is a keeper for sure.

This is amazing - it got rave reviews. The sauce was a hit and folks were surprised by how moist the chicken was. Will definitely make again. Very simple, even for a person with minimal cooking experience like me. Only modification was low sodium soy sauce.

This recipe was super simple and absolutely delicious! I added a few healthy shakes of red pepper flakes to the sauce for a kick . Also, I let the sauce simmer to thicken up, stirring frequently, as the sauce is thinner than I prefer. I let the chicken marinate for 1-1/2 hours. Served it with jasmine rice and Asian grilled vegetables (sesame oil, rice vinegar, salt and pepper). Thank you Bunda Esterlita Suryoputro!!! I will be making this regularly!

Only made the sauce - very good but I did thicken it with some extra peanut butter and added some Tobasco cause I didn't have any hot sauce.  Will be making it again.

I broiled because it was cold outside. This is so good. If you make extra sauce you use it on grilled vegatables.

OH MY. THIS IS AWESOME.  I always order Chicken Satay when we are at a Thai restaurant.  I didn't know I could make it at home and the peanut dipping sauce would taste EXACTLY like the restaurant.   I didn't have peanut oil so used vegetable oil and it was fantastic. LOVED it. I'll be making this again and again.

Followed the recipe exactly.  I guess I'm not very familiar with satay sauce, it was very, very thick. I had a very nice teriyaki sauce on hand so took a portion of each with a piece of the chicken, which by the way, was very good.

At this point I should rate this recipe. I have made it at least 15-20 times. It is a huge hit. The only change I made and have always suck with, is using sesame oil in marinade. I do not always cube/skewer it. A lot of times I marinate whole breasts and grill them.

Excellent. Used with super firm tofu that I baked. My husband asked if there was meat in it!  He couldn't believe it was tofu! I marinated tofu and then baked at 375F for 30 min, turning over at 15 min.

Amazing! I was on my own for dinner because my wife was at a baby shower. I was in the mood for some Asian food and had a boneless skinless chicken breast at my disposal, so I searched All recipes and came across this one. I've been wanting to try a satay recipe for a while and had all the ingredients for this one so I decided to give it a shot. Best decision I've made all day! I started off scaling the recipe down for 2 since I was solo, but when I had the marinade mixed it didn't look like enough, so I doubled it and ended up using the recipe scaled to 4 servings. It was the perfect amount for the very large club-store chicken breast I had. I got the chicken marinating, lit the grill, and started on the dipping sauce. It turned out a bit thinner than I wanted it, so I thickened it with a little corn starch.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper for a little heat. By the time I finished the sauce, the chicken was done marinating and the grill was ready to go. I was very pleased with how this turned out and will definitely be making this again.

I love this recipe because it's easy, fast, and delicious. I don't have a grill so I skip the skewers and cook these in a non-stick frying pan. Yummy!

Good flavor to the marinade
Likewise for the Peanut Sauce......  added 1/2 tsp chili oil - 'cause we like our food with a bit of spicyness to it.
(if you like a lot sauce make extra, you won't be sorry - it does thicken up.....  I needed to add some water before serving since I'd made it ahead)

Wonderful chicken satay with no major changes.  I marinaded strips from four chicken breasts for about 3 hours and it was quite flavorful and tender - not darkened at all.  I then grilled skewers on a George Foreman grill (it’s January) for @5 minutes for juicy tender result.  The dipping sauce was easy to put together and flavorful - but not spicy enough for my group of 8 friends so added a couple good shakes of cayenne and it just hit the heat spot.  I served this with a vegan version of Thai Noodle Salad from this site.  Thank you for this recipe - the whole group was well pleased.

*5 for being DELICIOUS

*5 for being EASY

I made it according to the recipe other than adding about 1 tsp cayenne to the satay sauce, just for a little warmth. We had it with steamed broccoli and coconut basmati rice (just replace about half the water with light coconut milk). We agreed, this recipe is in the dinner rotation!

Love love love it! I grew up in Holland eating Indonesian Satay every week and have not found any place that comes close in the U.S. This recipe is the best I've found. I used olive oil in place of peanut oil. I marinated the chicken for 30 minutes. And instead of peanut butter I added about a half a cup of PB2 peanut butter powder so cut down on the calories and fat. Amazing for a delicious and healthy recipe!!

This was a wonderful chicken feast!  I put the meat on a bed of rice and let people put as much peanut sauce on as they liked.  Everyone loved it!  The only downside, if you can call it that, is that it wasn't as spicy as a real Indonesian Satay.  The only reason I know that is we had an Indonesian student with us that night and he was disappointed with how mild it was to him.  It was just right for me tho!

I tried this recipe for the first time over the 4th of July holiday with my family.   It was a great hit!  Everyone from my 9 yr old son to his grandparents enjoyed this flavorful chicken recipe.  It is easier to do than some other marinades since you don't have to let it set for so long.  It was great!  The mix of soy sauce and spices with peanut butter was great.   My mother told me later that when she heard crunchy peanut butter was in it, she wasn't sure.   But she asked for the recipe when we were done!

Good but boring.  Followed the recipe except used smooth PB instead of chunky.  Marinated the chicken for approximately 4 hours but it still wasn't super flavorful, though it was good.  Most of my family didn't like the peanut sauce, but my hubby thought it was okay and he usually hates peanut sauces.

I made this last night and it was fantastic!  The chicken was very tender and delicious and the sauce was amazing!  I used organic chicken breast tenders--very easy to place on the skewers and marinated for about an hour or so.  I agree that the this is right up there with your favorite restaurant satay.  I used all natural chunky peanut butter and there was plenty of sauce--about a soup bowl amount.  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!

This dish is simply amazing!! Next time I will definitely add some red pepper flakes. It was a last minute meal idea so I only marinated chicken for about 30 minutes but it still turned out great. We also grilled some pineapple with it!! Very good!

Loved this recipe! I didn't change a thing. It was also super easy to make. The peanut sauce seemed a little runny but it was delicious.

Excellent recipe, enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it. My only advice is to increase the amount of marination and leave it for a longer time than the 15 minutes mentioned in the recipe. I left mine about 3 hours and it didn't darken the meat. I also marinated some carrots and mushrooms with the chicken and used it in the skewers. I used sesame oil instead of peanut oil (I didn't have any) and it worked just fine. I used the sesame oil in the preparation of the satay sauce also.

It was good but you cant brine for just 10 minutes. i'll try this one again and try to impart more flavor into the bird not the skin.

Peanut sauce a little rich but the marinate was excellent! Will alter the peanut sauce, maybe a little less peanut butter and give it another shot!  I froze the left over dipping sauce and will try it over rice noodles...

This was a real winner.  I marinated about 2 hours, and the cook time on a hot grill was correct, resulting in flavorful but moist chicken.  The peanut sauce was the best I have tasted.  I added the water gradually since some reviewers said it was too thin, but 1 cup of water turned out a perfect consistency for dipping.

Wow, so quick and delicious -  I doubled the recipe for a group of 8 and everyone loved it!!  Someone said it was up there with the stuff they have ordered at restaurants.  Served with white rice and broccoli to make it a full meal.  Only thing that was changed was that we grilled it on a nonstick grill pan on the BBQ.  It came out super moist and delicious!

Cut the recipe in half as I was cooking for two. It's not like me to completely follow a recipe, but this time I did! This chicken recipe is awesome!! I didn't make the peanut sauce as I think it's the first time in 40 yrs. I was out of peanut butter:-( I will be making this again very soon.. we both loved it!! Thank you for sharing!!

YUM!!  I read the reviews and couldn't wait to try this.  It is simple, has ingredients that are already at hand , AND it is so good!  I took one of the review suggestions and used ketchup instead of tomato sauce and it worked very well.  My kids were leery of trying something new, but after they tasted this they said they want me to make it at least once a week!  They next time I make it, I think I will kick it up a notch with some cayenne

Really liked this. Made it just as written. I liked the sauce, my kids ate it without and thought the chicken with the marinade was excellent 'as is' even without the sauce. Marinated it about 5 hours, and it was very tender. Will make this one again.

Really good chicken recipe! I used my indoor grill pan because it was raining outside. Chicken came out perfectly juicy and not dry at all. Loved the marinade. The peanut dipping sauce was good, but I made it even better by the addition of some Sriracha.

Delicious!  I marinated the chicken for about an hour.   I absolutely loved the peanut sauce.  I made it at the same time as the marinade and it came to room temperature which thickened the sauce.  I served the chicken over rice and stir fried vegetables.

The family loved it. Five stars.

I was distressed to find I was out of tomato sauce so (blush) used ketchup in an emergency. Turned out fine, even so. Thanks for sharing the deliciousness!

I've made it twice for company and it's a hit.  I served it for appetizers tonight.  I marinaded the chicken for about 30 minutes, then cooked it on the charcoal grill.  The chicken breast is tender and juicy.  Everyone loved the peanut sauce.  This is a winner.

Very good. However, the chicken came out a little dry... wondering if it should be basted over the course of grilling them... Also, for added heat, I included cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes in the peanut sauce. Good fix for authentic satay craving!

This was delicious!  I marinated it for about 3 hours.  I made 3 different dipping sauces to go with this so the kids had some choices (peanut-from my own recipe, sweet chile, and honey mustard) and there was not a single piece of chicken left!

Very yummy. However, we all felt the dipping sauce was way too thin.  Next time I will use only 1/2 cup of water instead of a whole cup.
