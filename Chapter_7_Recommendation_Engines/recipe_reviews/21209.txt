So sorry for a low rating but we just didn't like this. Butternut is my favorite squash and this wasn't a recipe for us. I omitted onion and used less mayo as others stated and used 1 cup crackers and 6 T parmesan. I do have an easier way to peel butternut squash for all you lovers out there. Wash and pat dry your squash. Take a fork and pierce the skin many times all around. Place in microwave and nuke for 8 to 10 minutes. Depending on size. Remove using a pot holder because it will be extremely hot. Let cool a few minutes before peeling, it's easier to slice too, it works great! Then procede with whatever recipe your making. Hope this helps.

The recipe is a good start but needs some modifications.  I did the following:
1. Don't add the onions.  They don't fit in this recipe.
2. Replace the mayonnaise with vanilla yogurt and make it slightly less than 1/2 cup.  You could also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract.
3. Replace the saltine crackers with Graham crackers
The result is a sweet, vanilla flavored dish that lets the natural butternut squash flavor come through!

My family absolutely detests squash, but I love it, AND it's good for you.. so here I went, and tried yet another squash recipe.. *you should have seen the look in my husbands eyes*... and to top it off I didn't realize that the friends we had over for dinner also disliked squash.. well.. they all tried it just to please me... and they LOVED IT! I didn't use the FULL amount of mayo, just cause someone said they thought it was too much.. but OH MY! yummy! Nice for haters and lovers of squash.. definately a winner! THANKS!

Wow, this is great! i used vanilla yogurt instead of mayo as another reviewer suggested, and bread crumbs instead of the crackers.  I also did double the topping and saute the onions in a bit of butter before, but everything else just as is.  My roommate can't stop eating it!  I seriously think she ate half of the dish!  A great way to use up butternut.  oh, and i did bake the squash in halves in 350 degree oven for 1 hour before, scooped it out, and beat everything together with a hand-held mixer to combine.  Great recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year in order to use up a couple of butternut squash I had laying around.  I used non-fat plain yogurt instead of the mayo and made lots and lots of topping!  It was a hit! Everyone loved it and scraped the bowl clean! It even traveled the 60+ miles and reheated well.  Definately a keeper! Thanks

I also halved the mayonnaise and doubled the cracker & cheese mix. The reviews are right - peeling the squash after boiling is a LOT easier.

This recipe is excellent.  Very tasty and easy to make.  I made it exactly as suggested, and wouldn't change anything the next time I make it. The ingredients aren't typical, but really add to the squash, and make a great complimentary side dish.  Thanks.

We all really enjoyed this recipe.  I used vanilla yogurt in place of the mayo, and cooked the 1/2 cup of onions a little before adding.  And of course I added more crunchy topping as everyone suggested.  We'll definitely try this one again!

FANTASTIC!!  I have served this twice to guests and several times to family and everybody loves it!  I have added more crackers and parmesan to the topping but other than that the recipe is perfect!  I have passed this recipe on to all my friends.  Tony, 24, Scotland, UK.

This was delicious!  My first experience with butternut squash.  It was a chore to make...you need a sharp knife to cut the squash into pieces, then it's a pain to peel (I peeled it after I cooked it, which made it easier).  Worth the effort, though.

FYI If you have trouble cutting up the squash, just cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, place in glass baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave 5 or 6 minutes or until tender. Then you can just scoop the flesh out of the shell and use as directed in recipe.

Very good!  Used the squash from my garden, and happy to find a new recipe to use them in!  Although; I added a touch of fresh grated nutmeg, substitued light sour cream (1/4 c) for mayo, and used panko (instead of crackers) for a "classier" crunch and taste.  This excellent side worked very well with our favorite pork tenderloin recipe.

this was pretty good and there are about a billion different ways to make it your own and just the way your family likes it, but to make peeling even easier do this:  Slice the squash in half lengthwise and place cut side down on a parchment paper lined baking dish, drizzle with a little olive oil and bake for about 45 minutes at 350 or until tender when pierced with a knife.  Allow to cool slightly and its easy to peel and slice or cube.  Can also be done in the microwave but add about 1/4 cup water to pan before microcooking for 10-15 minutes.

Really good!  Used sour cream instead of mayo cause that's what I had.  

I doubled the topping.  If you want a complete crust over the top, double the topping.  I would have been fine with it as written.  I also used shredded Parmesan, not the powered shaker cheese.  And I cooked the onions first.  

My two and three year old toddlers ate it and asked for more. So, five stars from us!!

OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The people who gave it a bad rating obviously did something wrong.  This was to die for and I will be making again.  and again.  and again.  I didn't change a thing other than I used light mayo, I sauteed the onions beforehand like most others say to do, I added a little garlic powder and I used Keebler butter crackers (not saltines).  I also added pank crumbs with some basil and oregano.  Next time I will use Greek Yogurt in lieu of the mayo to be healthier!  SO GOOD.

I hate squash.  It's mealy and insipid and yukky.  But THIS is wonderful!  I will gladly eat squash from now on if it's cooked like this.  The onion was a nice flavor.  I accidentally left out the brown sugar and my husband still thought it was too sweet (squash is naturally sweet).  No way to change that!  I get the impression from comments that people want this to be sweeter and don't like the onion....well....that would be trying to make this taste like candied sweet potatoes.  And it's not that kind of dish at all.  Try it as written, or even leave out the sugar.    Oh, one more thing...I didn't have saltines.  I just crushed up some bran cereal flakes instead.  Worked just fine.

Loved this.  It isn't easy to find a butternut squash recipe that is savory.  This one is really nice.  The onion and parmesan cheese give it a great rich flavor, and best of all, it doesn't taste like dessert!

Delicious savory way to enjoy butternut squash.  I roasted the squash in the oven (sliced squash in half lengthwise after I scooped out seeds, face down on a cookie sheet at 400 deg for 40 mins) and that made it easy to scoop the flesh away from the skin and mix up the rest of the ingred.  Also used half the mayo and substituted plain yogurt.  Doubled the topping.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

BIG HIT! I did suauted the onions before adding them and cut the mayo in half as suggested. Also, in an attampt to be a little healthier, I used light mayo, whole wheat ritz crackers and smart balance light. butter. I did, however,  used 1 & 1/2 topping as also suggested. It was full of flavor and delicious. The whole family loved it :)

We had 20 people for Thanksgiving dinner. NO ONE but my oldest daughter and I eat squash-however, decided to make this. I was  intrigued by the cheese - I changed the saltine to Panko bread crumbs and also added a layer of crushed pecans to the topping. The casserole was just about empty!  so much for just the two of us eating it.  Thank you for another wonderful Holiday favorite!

A great way to prepare the squash is to simply bake at 350 for an hour, cool, cut in 1/2 and scoop the squash out of the peel :)

With squash taking over our garden, I was looking for something new.  My Husband prefers savory over sweet, so this looked like a good bet.  My squash was a little small so I halved the mayo (used Light)and after reading reviews decided to saute' the onions. We both really enjoyed it, nice flavor. I think it also might be good with a bit of cooked ground sausage if you wanted a main dish.

This dish was exactly the type of squash dish I was longing to try!  We are trying to cut back on our sugar use and most recipes using butternut squash are loaded with it!  This not only fit our new guidlines but it tasted so yummy. I just baked it in a 10" pie plate and it was a wonderful addition to our dinner table.  Thanks for submitting!

Yummy! A few changes - omitted onion (didn't have), cut brown sugar to 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp minced garlic, replaced cracker crumbs with same amount of panko crumbs, added dashes of salt and pepper after baked, to season.

My family does not enjoy sweet side dishes, so this savory one seemed to be worth a try, since I really like butternut squash and wanted to find a recipe the rest of the family could appreciate.  Well, this one fit the bill - unusual, savory, and delicious.  We had it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Definitely try it!

During the last month, I've made this recipe twice for guests and both times, I was asked for the recipe. We liked that it was more savory than sweet. I made it with a little less onion (maybe 1/3 cup) and used whole wheat crackers instead of saltines.  Delicious!

This is pretty good. Make sure your onions are cut fine or they won't get soft in the oven. It is a really rich dish, but we liked it. (Double the topping)

Yummy recipe for squash.  I've made it three different times with three different squash.  The first time I used butternut and used crushed pita chips instead of saltines.  Second time, used kabocha pumpkin and crushed pita chips.  Third time for Thanksgiving yesterday - used queensland squash (had to double the recipe because I had a lot of squash) and used crushed cheez it crackers in the topping.  Tasty!  Agree double the topping recipe.  I also used ground flax seed in the mix and the topping.  It's definitely a fave!

Very good, but savory-not sweet.  Used 1/4 c mayo and onions, and doubled the topping.  Used ritz instead of saltines.  Makes about 6 servings. Add more brown sugar.

I am dieting, and this is a perfect side dish - instead of mashed taters or mac and cheese. I did as some others suggested and added more onions and grilled them. I also had some leftover sweet potato and added that into the mix.    A very good recipe that I will continue to use.

I loved this dish! I made it as a main course and even my meat and potatoes husband loved it. I would caution about the onions, though. I would have enjoyed this better if they hadn't been raw. I suggest sauteing them a little until they soften and become a little sweet so they aren't so harsh againsed the creamy, sweet squash. And do make lots of extra topping! Fantastic!

This truly is amazing. Instead of stuggling with the peeling and chopping of the squash I roast it and scoop out the cooked flesh.

Because I decided on Acorn Squash for this recipe, there was no need for the sugar as this particular squash boasts of its natural sweetness. Read many, many reviews with outstanding results, so I knew that I could play around. I only used about a tablespoon of lite mayo and a few of lite sour cream. This side was so incredibly good Hope and thankfully there's a bit leftover for me to have for lunch tomorrow! Thanks so much!

This is excellent.. the only thing I did differently was that I saute'd the onions in butter before adding them. 
But I have been looking for such a long time for a savory or even semi savory recipe for Butternut squash. yum.

This is total fall comfort food.  I've made it two times in as many weeks for my husband and I, and I'm now buying butternut squash every time I go to the grocery store.  To make the squash easier to peel and cube, I put it in the microwave for a few minutes, turning what side is touching the plate (as that side gets soft quickly).  Then I have to wait quite a while for it to cool down enough to peel it, but it's pretty fast work after that.  The substitutions I made were Splenda for the brown sugar and croutons or bagel chips for the saltines.  Agree with others who said to double topping.  Only downside to this dish is the amount of work and time it is for such a small amount of food.  I've found canned butternut squash puree at a fine foods store, and will try that next time to make it quicker.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  Of course the picky eaters didn't care for it. All the others seemed to have enjoyed it.  I cut the squash lengthwise, put them on a cookie sheet face down, baked at 350 for 45 minutes, waited for them to cool and then scooped the squash out.  It's easier than cutting it into pieces.  I think next time I would use less onions.

This was a pretty good dish.  Fairly easy to make, although it did make quite a bit. 
The only complaints I had were that it was a bit rich and sweet, and not enough cheese.
I now cut the mayo in half and triple the cracker-cheese topping.  I also use 
mozarella instead of parmesan as I don't like parmesan.

This recipe is great.  My 13-year-old son found it and has made it several times.  We usually use less onion, substitute egg whites for the eggs, and use either fat free yogurt or light mayo to make it healthier.

Totally failed to see what all the hoopla was about this recipe. The only positive was that it was a different way to serve butternut squash. Using raw onion was a huge mistake...the whole dish tasked like onions. The only change I made was I used nonfat plain greek yogurt instead of mayo and it didn't change the taste at all. Overall, this was disappointing. Will not make again.

I had to make substitutions, i used green onions, ritz crackers and the powder style Parmesan cheese. So although I didn't use the same ingrediants, nor have I made it with those for a comparison; this version was absolutely delicious. A definite keeper.

I used sour cream because we don't like mayo, I think  also used more than 1/2 cup. No sugar either.  It was delicious. Definitely a keeper. I was glad to find it.

I really didn't care for this dish. The mayo was a gross addition. And the flavor of the squash was completely overwhelmed.

Delicious!  Definitely a savory squash dish that has the fluffy qualities of a quiche.  Didn't think either the mayo or onion was overwhelming.  I did double the topping and was really glad i did!  Will definitely make again.

I am a fan of Butternut Squash, this was a simple recipe. My husband that isn't a fan of squash on principle liked this recipe well my version of it. i added a little garlic to the squash and onion mixture. I didn't boil the squash, I steamed it in the microwave for about 8 minutes with the onion and garlic. I used a little more brown sugar. I didn't have any saltines but I did have some pretzel/crackers and used them instead, it turned out very tastee!

This was delicious!  Just made a couple changes for my diabetic husband.  I sweetened with stevia to taste instead of brown sugar.  Also used wholewheat bread crumbs for topping instead of saltine crackers and doubled amount.  It's a keeper!

I'm going to simplify this, according to what I have done with it, almost by accident.  I microwaved the 1 to 1 1/2 lb squash for about 10 -12 minutes, until soft enough to scoop away from the peel. I added 1/4 cup of butter-type margerine, 1 tsp of salt, 1 generous tsp of black pepper, 1 generous tsp of garlic powder, and a generous tblsp of dark brown sugar. I mashed and mixed this all thoroughly, and served it alongside some really good roast chicken, on the plate.  The flavor and taste of the squash was delightful! I have eaten lots of butternut, but never any that was more delicious than this.  Maybe I lucked out.

I have to disagree with some previous reviewers --  do, Do, DO use the onion.  I personally really like onion with squash, especially red onions, which I use in several of my favorite recipes.  Although I'm sure the sweeter take on it is good too, shun not the onion!  Also, I might steal the idea of using yogurt -- for me plain -- instead of mayo for decreased sodium.

My family and I LOVED this recipe.  I knew nothing about butternut squash but found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Sending a big thank you to the reviewer who suggested quartering the squash, boiling until soft, and then scooping the soft cooked squash away from the peeling.  This was a life saver, I could never have peeled the hard raw squash, it was all I could do to just get it cut into quarters.  But it was worth the trouble.  Delish!!!

I really liked this dish. It was creamy and flavorful. I actually cut the squash into quarters and boiled it with the skin on and then scooped out the flesh into a bowl. I was weary using Mayonaise because I thought it wouldn't taste good but it did. I would also recommend using way less mayo than recommended, maybe a 1/4 cup, depending on the size of the squash?  I would like to have tried heavy cream instead, seems like a good substitute. I also added fresh shredded parmesan instead of grated and used more of it and it tasted great.

I threw this recipe together for a last minute dinner party- I substituted Club crackers for the saltines (which probably didn't make a difference).

I have a lot of squash critics and everyone loved this recipe- had good onion flavor- might add more parmesan next time around.  I also baked it for about an hour... the texture was outstanding.  I will add this one to my cookbook!!

Amazing is right!  I loved this dish, eating the leftovers right out of the pan.  I too doubled the topping - nice and crunchy and yummy.  The saltiness of the crackers contrasts so well with the sweetness of the squash.  Delicious!!

The ingredients in this recipe delicously highlight the naturally fresh taste of the squash while adding more complexity to the taste pallet. An easy, can't miss recipe. I did substitute the crackers for breadcrumbs, but either way is great.

I'm surprised anyone would want to change this at all!  Removing the onions or the mayo makes it bland and I can't stand the idea of making it sweeter!  I did double the topping though just because I love that crunch.  Anyway, I tried this recipe and brought it to a family dinner and everyone loved it!  I'm pretty sure my mom might have licked her plate clean she loved it so much.  I've had nothing but good reviews from this recipe since.  It's definitely become a family favorite!

I Think that I crushed the crackers too much on the topping. Courser crackers would have been better I think. This will become one of my regular recipes. It is wonderful.

I have made this 3 times now and love it.  It is onerous to peel and chop, but is worth it in the end.  I would definitely recommend using a thicker pan to cook it in as it was spread too thin in a baker and dried out a bit.  Overall a great side to serve with many dishes (we have done lamb and now turkey).

I made this last year for Thanksgiving. I had never made squash of any kind before, but my mom asked me to bring something "different".  It was a huge hit! I have just been asked to make it again this year.  The only change I made was to double the topping (it's that good).  Also I cheated a little.  My local store offers the squash already peeled and cubed so the prep time is much faster.  Thanks for sharing this.  I am pretty sure this will be my dish to bring every year now.

I really liked the topping and will use this idea for other recipes.  The squash had a nice fluffy texture (used my immersion blender as a previous reviewer suggested), but not a whole lot in the way of flavor.  There really wasn't anything to suggest it was butternut squash and my guests were not able to identify it.  I like having colorful food to round out a meals appearance, though, and will try this again with more seasonings.  UPDATE:  A second attempt with 1 t. poultry seasoning and some garlic powder came out much better.  I just used a fork to mash this time and used maybe 1 1/2 C. onions.  I liked the texture either way, fluffy and slightly denser.

This is great using half the mayo.
Time Saving Tip:  Microwave the squash whole 6-9 minutes, cut in half and scoop out.  I also put everything, except the topping, in the food processor.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

I'm very sorry but I was not amazed.  I'm a big squash fan too.  I'm not sure what was so disagreable to me.  Maybe and combo of onion/egg.  When I tested for seasoning b4 baking I thought it was great/but after it was baked I really didn't care for this at all.

I don't cook much, but was given the chore of Sunday meal for my family.  Since I don't cook much and have never worked with butternut squash, I found it a chore to peel, seed and cube it.  After the hard work was done, the recipe went along well and tastes *wonderful*!  Well worth the effort.

I found this recipe quick and easy to make and it really tastes great.  I found it a good substitute for white potatoes or rice.  And, instead of preparing it all at one time I peeled and cooked the squash one night and prepared the rest the next.

This dish was really tasty.  I made it with buttery, round crackers instead of soda crackers.  I found peeling, seeding and cubing the squash a bit difficult.

Nice change from the typical supersweet recipes for squash.  Made just as directed--very happy, especially my husband who won't eat squash "sweet." If you want sweet squash with brown sugar and maple syrup, etc. this isn't it! :)  As a savory dish--really good just as written.

I left out the onion and doubled the topping ingredients and kept everything else as listed on the original recipe. The mayo, I think, gives it an unexpected zing! Very yummy!

After trying too many butternut squash recipes that taste more like desserts than vegetables, this one is a winner. It has a fluffy texture with a nice savory flavor. I only used 1/4 cup mayo, but I'd adjust based on the size of your squash. I also finely minced the onion and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines, which I didn't have. I recommend using freshly grated cheese. I will be making this again.

I bought some butternut squash and was not sure how best to prepare besides my same old roasted with butter and brown sugar.  This recipe was IT!  Amazing flavor and so easy.  I doubled the topping as some others suggested and that is was makes this dish great!  Will most definitly make this again.

Reading through the reviews I just couldn't get a feel for how this squash tastes. Sweet? Savory? Honestly i didn't find it to be either. It was just kind of...blah... I made it exactly according to the recipe except I used pretzels for the topping because I didn't have saltines. Not my best decision. My Dad is a squash fan and really liked it, I am not a huge squash fan and this didn't change my feelings about it. We both agreed we have had better.  I wish my criticism could be more constructive other than to say it wasn't sweet enough to be good, or savory enough to be good. Having now made this, I would make it again by following another user's idea of exchanging vanilla yogurt for the mayo and using graham crackers for the topping. I think this would make it just sweet enough to bring out the flavor of the squash without making it too sweet.

I just recently became a vegetarian and have been looking for some different and interesting recipes to try. I had never cooked a butternut squash before, but it turned out AMAZING! So simple and so delicious! I will definitely be making this again for family and friends!

We all loved this, but I will definately halve the mayonnais when I make it for TG.  The onions were a great added flavor and I put more in then it called for. I used Ritz as I didn't have any saltines and it was a great crunch.

I have made this several times and just love it.  I cut the onions small and carmelize them.  We also throw some of the parmesan in with the squash.

I've learned to kind of go by eye with the mayo and egg depending on how much squash I have and sometimes it is waterier than others.  Makes the house smell so good.

I also use ritzs for the topping and double it at least depending on the dish I am using.

I typically cook the squash most of the way with out the topping, that way if it is too loose I don't have to worry about the topping getting too dark. I cut parchment paper and press right on top of the squash.  Once it is done to where it is pretty firm I  remove the parchment and add the topping.

This dish was delicious.  I didn't have enough mayonaise so I used half the mayo and the other half garden vegetable cream cheese.  I also used ritz crackers instead of saltines.  It reminded me of cottage potatoes, one of my favorites!

I used Greek vanilla yogurt instead of the mayo, as was suggested by other reviewers, so it felt much healthier, but it was pretty bland.  My daughter, who really liks butternut squash, felt like it was neither sweet nor savory and she didn't finish her portion.  My husband and I liked it more than she did but it did seem to need "something".  I ended up putting some maple syrup on it and it actually improved it a great deal.  I'm not sure I'll make this again since its a bit labor intensive but we like very flavorful and spicy foods so we might not be the best judges.

This will be one of my new favorite squash recipes. I made it with acorn squash, 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of actual onion, bread crumbs instead of crackers, and shredded cheese blend instead of parmesan(ran out) and it still came out great. Thanks for this very yummy recipe!

This has become a tradition for our Thanksgiving dinner.  It has such a delicious flavor and texture that it became an instant favorite.  We do like it best with the onion diced very small. One year we made the onion pieces too big and it overwhelmed the dish.

I'm not brave enough to try the mayonnaise thing in squash, so instead I substituted with an extra egg an 1/4 cup safflower oil. I know it's essentially the same thing, but without the salt and vinegar or lemon. It rose up a little in the oven (almost like a souffle!) and had a really nice flavor and texture.

I have never eaten butternut squash before, so this was my first time to cook it.  I followed the recipe but doubled the topping as other reviewers suggested.  I liked the squash but did not like the topping.  The parmesan cheese overpowered the taste of the squash. I may make this again but without the topping.

I'm not crazy about squash, but it's inexpensive and nutritious so I always cook it throughout the winter. I made this recipe exactly as directed. This was dynamite! Don't think I'll ever cook squash any other way again!!

Yummy, yummy!  Just made this for a ladies cooking club and we all loved it - even those who weren't butternut squash fans.  I definitely will make it again.

What are saltine cookies? As an English member I don't have a clue what they are. The recipes sound brilliant but so often we can't get the ingredients needed, or at least they are called something different here. Is it possible to have the English alternative listed?

My husband is a meat and potatoes guy. Not big on veggies, but he LOVED this. Next time, I will try sauteing the onions for a minute or two first to soften them up a bit. Like other reviewers, I doubled the topping. Also used whole wheat butter crackers-- fantastic!

This worked out well... I tweaked it a little, using a LARGE squash, half the onion, less mayo (I did not use hellmans and would definitely try that next time as I am not a big fan of other mayo), added some butter (1-2TBS) to make up for the mayo, and eyeballed the brown sugar (probably added more than called for).  Since I put butter in the squash I just left it out of the topping.  This was pretty easy and my husband ate about half the pan.

I can't say this was great but I'm not having any trouble eating the whole batch (my husband doesn't eat squash).  I did make a few modifications that might help others - I used 2 squash, 2 egg whites (vs. 1 whole egg), a little less mayo and probably twice the topping (seemed necessary for coverage in an 8x8 pan).  I thought the mayo/egg/onion mix would be too dominant with just the one squash I was planning on using and that might be what some folks are finding objectionable (not enough squash to balance the other flavors).   Then again it might also be helpful for someone to quantify the actual amount of squash this recipe needs ( x cups mashed etc.) I'm not sure what the brown sugar does for the recipe - I'll probably try it without next time.  If you are generally a squash person this recipe will probably be fine for you - sort of half way between sweet and savory.

I used slightly less than 1 whole squash, 1/3C plain fat free yogurt, 1/2tsp brown sugar, and 1 egg, left out the onion, then put it in a pie dish.  Even so, it was very shallow.  I used 1/3C crushed corn flakes instead of crackers for the topping.  I thought this was excellent.  Next time I might double the whole thing- more squash, more yummy topping.  One note- I used the shaved kind of parmesean instead of the powdery king, and some of it was hard and crunchy (not melty).

Tasty and easy to make - though it did take some prep time.  I had no mayo so I used ranch dressing and milk.  It worked out well, and gave the squash some kick!  Everyone loved it.

A friend gave me a butternut squash from their garden, and I had never made squash before...so I came online to find a recipe for it and give it a try.  This was delicious and I had everything I needed for it lying around in the house.  I mixed all the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid mixer and the texture was creamy and melted in your mouth.  I will definitely make it again.  The family loved it!

This was great; tasted wonderful and very easy to cook.  Instead of boiling the squash, if I make this again I'll bake it first to give it a roasted flavor.  Regardless, very good.

This recipe is very good, and simple to make. I served it for dinner even though I wasn't sure if the guys would like it, but they did -- and everyone had seconds.  The taste is mild, and I think even people who may not like squash will like this one.

I didn't care for this at all.  My husband thought it was ok, otherwise I'd give it one star.  Just kind of a weird mix of ingredients.  I'm not a huge butternut squash fan, so those who like it may enjoy this recipe.  I will not make it again.

I love butternut squash but was not at all impressed with this recipe. I think I would rather just eat it plain. I didn't get much feedback either when I prepared it as a  Thanksgiving side dish. But for those willing to try it, you can save alot of time by microwaving the squash.

This came out so yummy!  I didn't have saltine crackers, so I used Sour Cream and Onion flavored "Cheese-It's" instead - perfect!!!  It's still sweet without all the sugar that you normally put in butternut squash.  Definitely a keeper!

This dish was easy to put together I had such hope for this recipe as something different and new to serve.  But it was a dissapointment. The onions and mayo were way too much and the cheese/cracker mixture way too little. I should have tried this first before serving it to company.

The final result is great, but the prep time takes a while. It makes a lot, but I just kept out enough for two dinners and froze the rest uncooked for when we have guests. Would not make it every day, but good for special occasions.

I made this, but did not have crackers, so used plain Panko! Yummy! The second time, I added a little more dark brown sugar and some cinnamon and it was equally as yummy! Will be making this for Thanksgiving as I got two very large butternuts for the occasion!

I just microwave cut in half squash, in a glass pie plate with a little water, till tender. Then scoop out of skin. Followed recipe exactly. This is a great side dish, not too sweet and a unique flavor.

i was looking for an easy recipe that used items i already had in the house. this was the one for me. the only exchange i made was crushed cheese-its for the topping in place of the saltine crackers (because i didnt have those in the house). i also doubled (maybe even quadrupled) the topping. my family loved it, i loved it, and i gladly ate the leftovers twice! thanks for sharing this recipe. i will use it again and again

I had plenty of sweet-type recipes for butternut squash and was looking for something savory.  I need simple, and I need gluten-free so thank you for this recipe as it made a great jumping-off point.  Here's what I did after looking over the recipe: I sauteed celery and carrots and a tiny bit of onion on low heat w/ some butter.  Once those softened a bit, then I added cubes of butternut squash (from Costco) and continued to cook until the squash was soft and caramelized. Since I can't have saltines, I just liberally added the Parm cheese.  No mayo, no brown sugar, and no egg.  My two teens ate it without any encouragement - amazing.

perfect the way it's stated.. it can fit in a 9" pie dish.

I did use more parmesean.. I would use more butter too for the topping.

At the time I made this, I didn't have a real onion, so I substituted dried chopped onion. I made sure to measure in the equivalent to 1/2 cup onion. However, all I could taste is the onion. I'd definitely use much less onion - it overpowered everything else.

Meh.  Maybe cooking the onions first or using less of them would help, but when made as directed we thought the onions really overpowered the squash.  Adding more topping might help, but that too would kill the flavor of the squash.  No wonder people have said, "My family that usually hates squash loved this."  The squash flavor is, pardon the pun, squashed.

Since the recipe didn't mention the amount of squash to use, we settled on using 2 pounds. We changed the amount of mayonnaise to 3/4 c, and doubled the amounts of crackers, Parmesan and butter. It was delicious and we will definitely have it again!

Overall it was a good dish for being squash. I had a winter squash that I used instead of butternut so maybe that had something to do with it. It was good but not great. Not sure if I would make it again of if I did I might tweak it to add more brown sugar.

Delish!  I substituted a container of 0% Fage plain yogurt for the mayo and I used a little more brown sugar used Ritz crackers (about 15) instead of saltine cause I didn't have any and a little more parmesan cheese and it came out fab.  This is definitely a keeper in my recipe file and much healthier without the saturated fat in the mayo!

Simply delicious.  The only problem was removing the skin but tacked that even being partially paralyzed.  Placed squash in microwave wrapped in paper towels for about 3 minutes and the outer covering was much easier to remove.  Otherwise, enjoyed this recipe and will make again.

I peel the squash using a regular vegetable peeler... it works quite well. I thought this recipee was great but I also love butternut just plain roasted. I cube it, toss with some olive oil, S&P, and sage... Takes about 40 minutes at 400 degrees. You can add other veggies.

I found this to be really good! Very quick, simple & easy! I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the mayo and also honey for the brown sugar. Little bit oniony if you have a picky eater who doesn't much care for onions, but good side dish.  I do not have a lot of experience w/ butternut squash, but really very quick & simple with the Trader Joe's pureed but. squash. Simple ingredients also make this a great choice. Give this a try!  I also cooked into a muffin cake pan as I live in a studio &  lack many baking dishes.  Turned out great!

This was a great dish.  I made it at thanksgiving and my sister-in-law loved it.  So much that she wanted the recipe.  I will not give it to her.  So she has bugged me for two months now to make it and today is the day.  She still has no clue but I am enjoying all of the fun.  Excellent recipe and Merry Christmas to you all!!!!!

This was great! After I made it my boyfriend and roommate could not get enough! I, like others, substituted mayo for yogurt and caramelized the onions and doubled the topping portions. I also suggest doubling the recipe because everyone will want seconds! Yum!!

Followed other reviewers advice and subbed yogurt for the mayo.  Also, boiled/steamed squash (after halving lengthwise) in microwave.  Easier to scoop the squash out this way.  My family enjoyed this.  Be warned, it is slightly sweet but the savory topping goes well with it.

I decided to try this recipe vs the brown sugar/graham cracker version listed in the reviews. For half of the squash I followed the original recipe, except for sauteing the onions and doubling the topping as so many suggested. It was wonderful! The onions melted away and the ingredients did combine well--meant to take a picture, but ate the thing too fast. For the other half of the squash, I followed the directions for the brown sugar and graham cracker version (listed in the recs). Compared to the original recipe, it wasn't appetizing at all. Tasted too sweet and vanilla-y for the squash. Unusual for me since I'm known for my sweet tooth. Definitely sticking to the original.

I used Ritz.  This was amazing and was a great side dish to Thanksgiving.  I liked this much better than a yam dish.

This dish was so easy, and very delicious.  I doubled the topping and used Ritz crackers, because that is what I had.  I also used the vanilla yogurt suggestion, I do think the mayo would be great too, give it a nice richer flavor.  Thanks again

Um, sorry, but we really did not like this at all.  This was our first time cooking and eatin squash, and none of us liked it much.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and thought it was a lot of work (peeling and chopping the squash) for the taste.  Sorry, just our opinion:)

This was a big hit at my Christmas dinner. The people who were only being  polite and tried the dish were very vocal at their surprise in how much they liked it. Used the advice of a previouse reviewer and used vanilla as well as cinnamon and graham cracker topping. YUMMY

This was just so-so. I would not make it again.  My husband liked it and he is an excellent cook. He rated it on a scale of 1 to 5 as a 4 pretending to be an 8; meaning it's missing something, wasn't hearty enough for him.  I didn't think it was that good and I think it was because of the onions.  They didn't seem to belong, or perhaps I didn't mince them fine enough.  I am a huge onion fan, but did not like them in this dish.  Also, I did not like the texture of this, it was too moist, even after baking.  And it only tasted alright if you took a bite with some of the topping.  Perhaps carmelizing the onions or using shallots instead might be better.  Overall, very blah - certainly not "amazing" as the recipe title states.

yummy.  my husband and I aren't big squash fans, so we were very happy to find that we liked this... I used a medium-large sized squash, doubled the amount of onion and added more cheese too.  I also added almost twice as much sugar.  ****ok, I made it again for Thanksgiving.  I almost feel like the portions don't matter.  I used 2 big and 1 small squash and didn't change any of the measurements except for doubling the sugar and it was still good!  I added freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon too. yum!

This was a very easy and very tasty recipe!   The only thing I would change is to add a little less mayo, as I found the taste slightly overpowering (but then again, I'm not a huge fan of mayo).  I will definitely make this again for the holidays!

This was alright as a side dish. Wasn't a big fan of the mayo in it...I think for something savoury, rather than sweet I'd leave it out, add sour cream as another reviewer suggested as well as some sage or other spices.

This was very good. Had to modify slightly because I did not have enough squash on hand or mayo. Took another reveiewers suggestion and added light sour cream. I was afraid my fiance, who does not like onions, would think it was too onion-y but he ate it up. I will be making this again!

I used seasoned breadcrumbs rather than saltines, and less parmesan. Either straight from the oven, or as chilled leftovers for lunch the next day, its a great 'pick me up', as its both soothingly sweet and surprisingly tart...

This recipe was great with a little tweaking-I used about a half cup yogurt as suggested, left out the onion, used about half a cup of brown sugar, and used animal crackers for the topping because I didn't have saltines or graham crackers(ahh, the joys of having kids!).  Turned out delicious!

I made this to bring to several holiday events- it was so easy and everyone loved it- even a few people who I did not expect to even try it! After softening the squash, I put it right into a food processor--- then added the rest of the ingrediants into the food processor(minus the cheese and crackers). So easy!

WOW!! This is good.  This is the first time Ihave had butternut squash and it was great.  This recipe is different because it isn't so sweet.  It was a nice change for squash.  I also sauted the onions before putting them in with the squash to soften them up a little and also used ritz crackers.  YUMYUMYUM..

The combination of the ingredients makes a nice, smooth taste.  I followed other suggestions and cut down on the amount of onions.  I thought there were still too many, but my husband loved it and literally ate half of the squash while standing at the stove.

Very interesting way to make squash!  Try using graham crackers instead of saltines.  It gives it a very nice flavor, sort of "graham-y".  BTW--I added cinnamon, I mean what's squash without cinnamon!!  ;)

Not bad at all...everyone was impressed!  I did vary the recipe by adding a 1/4 cup of real bacon bits and about a tablespoon of the drippings instead of the butter on top.  We all agreed it gave a wonderful flavour to it!

Horrible, I took the suggestion to use a lot less onion. So I put 1Tbsp of onions and it still tasted to strong. The flavor was bland. No one in my family liked, and I love squash. Very disappointed. I did use less mayo and it seemed to limit the overpowering taste of mayo others have noted.

We tried this recipe recently with a home grown butternut squash. It is pretty good. If I make it again I will use only 2 tbsp of onion and low fat mayo. 1/2 cup of onion overpowers the squash.

My first attempt at baking a squash dish. I think I used a larger squash than the recipe could support. Needed more topping and definately more salt! Baking in a bowl rather than a flat dish was a mistake. (I'm not Emeril) The flavor was good and prep was easy other than preparing the squash. I had no idea they were so hard to peel!

I liked it, but my husband and best friend were not impressed. Peeling and removing the seeds of a butternut squash are time-consuming, so I will keep looking for a recipe for this main ingredient. (The aforementioned friend brings me lots of squash, so I am always looking for squash recipes.)

Amazing is a high bar to set.  This is definitely better than just squash with butter and salt and pepper.   If you're a fan of butternut squash you'll like this recipe.  But if you're not a fan, this is not the recipe that will change your opinion of the vegetable.   Always be wary, of someone who ends their recipe description with,  "please try it. " Haha

VERY GOOD EASY.  Nice simple recipe. I softened first
in micro till able to cut then roasted with olive oil and 
brown sugar. Then carried on from the mashing. 
Sautéed mushrooms once. Whatever you have time for.
Will make again.

Have made this a couple of times now for Thanksgiving and everyone loves it.   I like that it can be made ahead of time and even frozen.  The flavors all blend together well and it is not too sweet like many other squash recipes.

Great recipe! I changed a couple of things, subbed sour cream for the mayo because I didn’t have any and vegetable Bretons for the ‘saltines’ as I didn’t have that either. I added a bit of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg and it turned out awesome.  Though next time I think I will use the more powdered-like Parmesan cheese as the shredded turned out a bit too crunchy for me...

Made it just as per the posted recipe, and it was very tasty, enjoyed by everyone. Next time will double the topping, but all the other quantities turned out just fine for the size of squash I had.

This dish was amazing and I got so many compliments from my family!! Here are the changes I made:
1- I boiled the squash in veggie broth (not just plain water)
2- I omitted the onions
3- I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise

The only change I made was to use breadcrumbs instead of cracker crumbs.  I loved the recipe!!  Can't wait to make it again!  And I baked the squash whole .... It takes over an hour, but there is no peeling and it is sooooo easy to cut and scoop out when it's done.

I was looking for a savory way to prepare squash and this was a great way to start. I took the advice of other reviewers and swapped out the mayonnaise for lite sour cream and omitted the brown sugar. I used green onions and added fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden.  Doubled the flavorful topping. It was delicious and pretty with the bits of green. My husband loved it.

Recipe doesn't specify the amount of butternut squash so I started with 1 pound.  After adding the egg, onion, and mayo, I decided to add another pound of squash.  Other than that, followed the recipe....too much onion, onion was raw, and flavor was disappointing.

I've made this recipe repeatedly because it is a unique way to present butternut squash and tastes good, too!  Based on suggestions from others, I cut the mayonnaise down to about 1/4 of what the recipe calls for and substituted the rest with full-fat greek yogurt.  I like a little more seasoning, too, so I've been sprinkling the final product with some "Emeril's Original Essence" seasoning.  I've always omitted the brown sugar and never felt like I was missing anything.  If you simply follow the recipe, it is a little bland, but if you doctor it up as I suggested, it's quite good!

I made a few changes to the recipe.  
Instead of 1/2 cup chopped onions I did a mix of onion, shallot, garlic and jalapeno (1/2 cup).
I doubled the topping using panko bread crumbs and added chopped pecans.  It is highly seasoned and i might try use 2 butternut squash without adding any additional ingredients.

Very good balance of flavors and texture.  Easy to make ahead.  I mixed everything except the topping in the Cuisinart.  Baked 3/4 time, then mixed the topping in the Cuisinart.  Finished baking.  Easy, peasy. Perfect.

I omitted the onion the second time I made this. I switched the mayo out for Greek yogurt (no fat). I added a little of the pumpkin type spices. It's now a standard recipe in our home.

I really like this recipe. Always looking for squash recipes. I will be making this again. Instead of buying the whole squash, I bought the butternut squash that was cut up and cleaned and microwaved it for 10 minutes with a little water in it.

I would definitely make this again. I made it for Christmas and it got rave reviews. Personally I would add a bit less mayonnaise in order to have more of a squash flavor. It was very creamy!

I loved this recipe. I followed it exactly, except for the topping I used panko crumbs instead of cracker. I will make it again &again.

It was good but in doubling the topping it somehow got dry on top. I think the secret woul be more squash. I also used Panko for the topping, so I'm not sure if that made a difference.  I sautéed the onions and used sour cream in the squash (instead of mayonnaise) and that part was delicious. I will try again but alter the topping ingredients.

I loved this! The first time I forgot to add the add, and it didn't make much of a difference. 
I have made this about 4 or 5 times now because my husband and I are addicted to it. I double the amount of onions, as well as the topping.

Very tasty! I did double the topping and subbed in panko for the crackers (didn't want to make a trip to the store just for saltines). This is very tasty. Enjoyed by all at dinner that night. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I found 1/2 c. Mayo a bit too much. 1/4 c. Better. Also I saluted the onions first. Ingredients sounded a bit crazy at first but all came together deliciously!

Omitted the onions and doubled the parmesan cheese and bread crumbs (instead of crackers).  My husband said it was THE BEST side dish I've ever made.  I will definitely be making it again.

The only change I made was to substitute corn Chex for the crackers to make it gluten free.  Not sure why some other reviews were hating on the mayo and/or onions.  Aside from the Chex, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect!  Was a great hit for tonight's dinner.

I roasted the squash at 350 for 45 min instead of boiling it in the first step and used wheat thins instead of saltines because it was all I had on hand. Came out great!

Just tried this and it was a hit. I used a little bit less mayo (1/3cup) and went light on the sugar. I used twice the amount of topping and found it to be scrumptious..also baked the squash in the oven with olive oil for about 45 mins to soften it up. I was very happy with the end result and my picky children and hubby enjoyed it so much! It's a must try in my book(;

My family loves this casserole.  We don't change a thing except to put a little extra topping.  It is nice to have a savory squash dish instead of the usual sweet ones.

I added shredded cheese to the squash before baking.  I love the onion flavor but I reduced the amount so it wouldn't be overwhelming.  Then I used crushed Ritz crackers and mixed it with more shredded cheese for the topping.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago for my husband and myself. We both loved it! So I decided to add it to my Thanksgiving menu. The mayo gives it a nice rich flavor, as do the onions (I used dried, minced). That, with the Parmesan on top, really makes it nice and savory for a great side dish. Thanks for this one!

My partner loved this recipe. She says it tastes a little like scalloped potatoes with butternut squash. I definitely liked it, but I'd try some of the other alterations next time. I'd like it less savory and a little more sweet.

We love this recipe.  I find it easier to cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, salt & pepper and a little drizzle of olive oil and bake flesh side down on a baking sheet until soft. So much easier than peeling and it provides a richer taste.
I also caramelize the onions (I just use a whole onion) and double the topping.  
This is a SAVORY recipe.  Everyone omitting the onions and substituting vanilla yogurt makes it sweet.   
Thank you, LHBLIQUID!  This has been a staple on our Thanksgiving table for years!

amazing! I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise, and added extra croutons. Didn't have crackers on hand so I used croutons, also didn't have any parmesan so I used mozzarella,. still turned out much better than expected :)

This was pretty good. I expected it to be sweeter than it was. I used vanilla yogurt instead of mayo for more sweetness and less calories. I think next time I would omit the onions and add more brown sugar.

This is one of my Favs! The only change I make is instead of the topping the recipe calls for, I lightly crush up some French Fried Onions and toss in some panko bread crumbs and a pinch of garlic powder. I just do it to taste, so I don't have measurements. Still use the butter and cheese too (but just a little cheese.)I make about 3/4 cup topping (I like it crispy on top.) Oh, and I use Miracle Whip instead of Mayo for the tang. Works out great IMO!

I used this recipe for my first time making butternut squash and it was a HIT!  I quickly realized that I didn't have a very large squash, so I ended up filling 2 medium sized ramekins - 1 for me and 1 for my fiance.  I followed the recipe almost exactly - I cut down on the mayo a bit, doubled the topping, and used panko instead of saltines.  The topping did get a bit brown (I kept it in for 35 minutes).  But we don't mind it a little crunchy like that.

This was pretty good.  I'm sure others might find the flavor combination a hit and interesting.   I added brown sugar to it when I was eating the dish, which helped it for me.  Also, perhaps doubling the cracker mix so that it covered more of the surface might have helped, then I might not have needed the extra brown sugar.

This is AMAZING! I also used 1/2 the mayo called for. Boiled the sqaush whole and peeling it was a breeze! Did not have saltine crackers and used Ritz low sodium instead. I didn't even use salt or pepper! It was perfect for us!

This was outstanding.  I'm not sure I really have ever had butternut squash before, so it was mostly an experiment and a very delicious one at that!  I was surpised how much flavor this dish has.  My husband and I ate it ALL.  A+

This is absolutly my favorite side dish of all time! I did add a little more brown sugar because I have a major sweet tooth. The mayo was fine but i will try it next time with yogurt just so it will be a little healthier. And i want to try to eliminate the onions because my dad will not try it with onions and i want him too ... will this ruin the recipe or can i subsitutite with something else?? Let me know!

I still prefer the old method of cooking and smashing with brown sugar and butter.  This seemed to not have a lot of flavor.  The texture was good.  Loved the topping.  But I'll stick to the simple old fashioned way.

My family had never tried butternut squash before and we loved this recipe.  I made several substitutions and it was fabulous.  I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, slightly reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 tsp, used grape nuts cereal on top instead of saltines (healthier and tastes better) and I added 1 minced garlic clove and a pinch of red pepper flake to give it some extra "oomph".  This dish will definately be on my Thanksgiving table this year!

I did substitute yogurt for mayo, and didn't use half a cup of onions since I had a small squash. The consistancy was right, and it looked nice. We didn't gag, but it definately wasn't something I'd want to make again. The taste reminded me of a hashbrown casserole (onions, cheese, potatoes, sourcream) but with a twangy sweetness.

A cool twist on butternut squash.  I took the advice of others and added more onion with a little garlic salt for flavor, egg to make it stiffer, and I added 1/4 cup of chopped mixed nuts for texture and taste to the squash.  I also mixed 1/4 cup of the chopped nuts to the topping which I doubled according to others' suggestions.

Not sure I'll make it again.  I read the comments and thought I'd give them the benefit of doubt.  I think I prefer sweet instead of savory.  The topping was nice and I did double it.

I made a few changes as well.  I used less mayo and also used panko instead of the saltine crackers. I also put some dried rosemary in and eliminated the brown sugar.  I thought it was still a little too sweet, and there were no sweet ingredients.  I liked it, but my husband did not.  It was quick and very easy though!

I've made this for potlucks and everyone loves it!!!  Even the girl who can't stand onions still liked this dish.  I like using my immersion blender to make it light and creamy (also easy cleanup).  I got the recipe a year ago, and couldn't find it today, so I just spent awhile seeking it out specifically to make with dinner tonight.  It's that good!

Very tasty and a wonderful fall side dish!  I did make some modifications:  I sauteed the onions is butter as when I read some of the other reviews, I was concerned they might overpower the dish if added raw.  I think it helped mellow their flavor.  I also used only 1/4 cup of mayonnaise and I baked the squash instead of boiling it.

I baked the squash to make it WAY easier to peel & mash and keep more of the vitamins (and taste!)  I thought it was still too much work for such a so-so taste.

I made this with 3 servings.  I used miracle whip instead of mayo and added a little more brown suger than the recipe called for.  It's quite a sweet treat and good fall recipe, though some might find the mayo overpowering if you add too much.

I didn't prefer this.  It has the texture of souffle with crackers on top. The ingredients are not expensive, so I wasn't out very much monetarily.  However, I could hardly taste the flavor of the squash....I mainly tasted sweet, mayonaisse, onion flavored crackers. I was disappointed considering the positive reviews on this one.  I'd past one it.

This was awesome. I made a few minor alterations based upon what was in the kitchen. Instead of full fat mayo, I used fat free. I also used crushed vegetable crackers instead of saltines and fresh parmesan instead of canned. Oh I also left off the butter on top. This tasted wonderful.  A perfect fall comfort food. Ill make this many times over the next few months I am sure

I was hoping this really would be "amazing" because of its title and rating.  However, my roommate and I simply couldn't appreciate the strong mayo flavor.  It was more fun to prepare and make than it was to eat.  Probably something my mom would like better than I did.
