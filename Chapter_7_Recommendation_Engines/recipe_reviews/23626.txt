Delicious chicken dish. Be sure to pound the chicken breasts very thin, it makes rolling them up much easier.

I diced up the jalapenos, and ended up not making the sauce (ran out of time).  The chicken/pepper/cheese/bacon combination was WONDERFUL!  My husband and I both loved it.  This is a new family favorite for sure!

Edit:  My hubby and I still love this recipe, but I've made some modifications so it's quicker to make.  I've still not made the sauce because the chicken by itself is so good.  What I do now is dice the chicken and cook in a pan with a little bit of oil.  Then I sprinkle on cooked crumbled bacon, the chopped jalapenos (I use jarred), and the shredded cheese.  Put the lid on and let it cook till the cheese melts.  It takes a fraction of the time but still tastes delicious!

Really good! I baked the chicken instead of cooking it in a skillet, and I didn't bother with the corn chips. I also microwaved the bacon for a couple of minutes prior to wrapping it round the chicken, so that it crisped up nicely in the oven. Next time, I'll add some fresh cilantro to the corn/bell pepper mixture. Good stuff! Thanks, Sophie!

This was very good.  I used turkey bacon instead to make it a little more low fat.  I used diced green chilies in place of the jalapenos.l  I also left out the pepper and corn at the end.  It didn't really seem necessary.  I served it over yellow rice.  When the husband says "you should make this again" I know it was good!

This is a fairly easy recipe to make. The jalapenos gave it a nice spicy taste. I ruined my sauce, so I can't tell you what that was like. It's a very colorful dish which makes a nice presentation for your dish. I will make it again and hopefully I won't ruin my sauce.

This is my husbands  new favorite dish.  I have already made this multiple times.  It looks great as far as plate presentation.  Tastes great, and really was easy.  It took about 40 minutes for me to get this all together. We love it.  I would definitely recomend this!

A decent go-to recipe. I gave it four stars because it wasn't "amazing" in my opinion.

The gravy turned out a hot mess, but the chicken was wonderful.

I didn't have bacon in the house at the time, and i didn't have the time for the sauce. My husband really hated it. It was bland. After rereading the recipe i realize what a difference the bacon would have made, i will remake this again, and let you guys know how it turns out.

My friends sons made this a few day ago and invited my family. I wasn't sure my husband or my 10 y.o.would like it.They used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and the sauce was to be doubled. I told the boys to add some chicken broth and not use the doubled amount of flour, it would be too much. They ended up ony needing a few TBS of flour.They also put the chicken under the broiler to crisp up the bacon. The first thing my husband said was "This is GOOD" after a few more bites he said it was the best chicken he ever had. He took the jalapenos out but liked the flavor they left behind. My 10 year old really liked it too, it was a great meal.

Used Monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar and a can of green chiles instead of jalapeno rings. Very flavorful. Nice presentation. Only made the chicken breasts.

Great recipe--1st time I made it with Sauvignon Blanc it was delicious! Second time made it with Chardonnay and green chiles, which left a bitter aftertaste.
