This is the best lasagna recipe I have made yet! I used liquid egg whites instead of regular eggs because that is what I had and I added some fresh spinach to the recipe. The second time I made it I added some broccoli and pre-cut matchstick carrots to make it a veggie lasagna. I typically cut this recipe in half. My picky husband was pleased with this recipe.

I made some major changes and it turned out AMAZING.  I left out the ricotta cheese and used 2 bags of shredded mozarella and 1.5 cups of fresh parmesan.  I also added steamed broccoli to the sauce and cooked for 45 minutes plus an extra 10 after topping it off with the extra mozarella.  I also made it 4 layers just by adding more sauce, etc.  It was very delicious and my husband who doesn't usually like lasagna was loving it!

I added and changed a few things.  I used the Five-Cheese flavor of Bertolli sauce, because that's my favorite.  I used whole wheat lasagna noodles.  I used cottage cheese in place of ricotta, because I like it a lot better.  I put the cottage cheese mixture into a food processor to mince the curds.  I sauteed a small chopped onion and a pound of ground beef in a pan then added the sauce to that.  This was as good a lasagna as any, in my opinion.  Good recipe.

This recipe actually worked for me. I usually add my own spices to make foods tastier. I also added ground turkey and as I cooked the meat, I seasoned it with taco seasoning. It may sound a little weird but it added great flavor. It worked and it is so delish!

Too much sauce. I will not be making this recipe again.
