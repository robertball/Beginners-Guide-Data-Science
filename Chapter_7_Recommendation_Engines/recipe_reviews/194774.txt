I could not find Strawberry pudding at the store I went to.  I substituted with Chocolate.  Also, the Chocolate came in a little bit larger of a box, so a tad more milk is needed so it is not too thick.  I also did 1 1/2x the amount of crust, as it seemed too thin to me.  Also, instead of serving 12, I cut them to serve 24 and used mini-marshmallows instead of full sized, to make the flowers smaller and able to fit on the smaller cut pieces. I personally did not taste these, but made these for Easter to take to my family's and a friend's.  They were a huge hit at both houses, everyone especially loved how pretty it was!  My Aunt has asked me to make them again for our Mother's Day get-together this weekend.
