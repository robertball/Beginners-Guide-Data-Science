YUMMYLICIOUS!  The first two times  I made it, I inadvertedly used baking soda instead of baking powder.  I rectified my mistake   next time I baked it and used baking powder as the recipe calls for.  I found that the soda works SO MUCH BETTER.  I also add nutmeg, cloves, ginger and raisins.  I have an apple tree that has given me abundant fruit so I have baked this cobbler MANY, MANY TIMES.  I get nothing but raves.

A very good recipe!  I doubled it and put it in a 9 x 13 pan, and baked
it 10 min. longer and it turned out perfect.   So easy to make and was
to die for.  Thanks!

I used half whole wheat flour, half white flour, brown sugar instead of white, and I only had skim milk.  This came out great. So delicious and moist.

Outstanding.  I didn't have evaporated milk, so I substituted a can of sweetened condensed milk for the evaporated milk and 1 cup sugar.  Fabulous!!

What a wonderful treat this was! I did find that it does have more of a cake like texture as another reviewer mentioned though. I had to omit the nuts for my daughter and I used half white sugar and half light brown sugar with a tsp of vanilla and some extra cinnamon and then did a very light drizzle of maple syrup over the apple before I added the flour mix. I think that maybe 55 minute was a bit to long for my oven. Next time i will start checking it after 45 or so. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

this recipe is excellent. the only change we made was to add the juice of 1 lemon to the apples, it helps with the browning of the apples and tastes great. i would highly recommend this recipe.

I made this yesterday, and I have to say this is the bomb-diggity!  I have no changes whatsoever, except maybe enjoy with a couple bottles of wine! As my grandpappy used to say, "It's so good, it'll make yer tongue slap yer brains out!"

I don't know whether it's a real cobbler or not but it is amazing! I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and doubled the quantities for the dough, as suggested by other reviewers. Too bad I didn't have enough pecans to sprinkle some on the top too...

DELICIOUS!  This has become my favorite cobbler recipe.  Followed the directions exactly but had a little more apples than it called for so I put it all in a 9x13 pan.  Family raved over it!
Thanks for sharing!

This recipe melts in your mouth.  It really is to die for!  Can be made without pecans if your guests do not like nuts, but the pecans really are the crowning jewel.  You can feel confident making this recipe for any occasion.  Enjoy!

Wow, this was good. I made these this afternoon. I had 5 medium gala apples that needed to be used. After reading a lot of reviews I had mixed feelings, but decided to try it anyway. I'm glad I did. I didn't measure the apples. I used all 5 apples I had which was more or less close to 4 cups. I was skeptic about adding a full cup of sugar in the batter, which seemed a lot for only 1 cup of flour, so I cut back to 1/2 cup suggested by some reviewers. I'm so glad I did. One cup would have been way to much. The only other change I made was adding more cinnamon (about 1/4 teas) and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and sprinkled on top of the apples. I baked it for about 1 hour and 5 mins. I served each of us a piece after dinner. The first bite was delish. My family loved it. I thought it was great but a little to sweet. Everyone else thought it was perfect. This wasn't really a cobbler texture, more cake like. The pecans did it for me. Overall, it was worth all 5 stars. Next time I will add 5 cup of apples, more cinnamon, 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar and remain 1/2 cup of white sugar in the batter. Everything else was perfect. My hubby is eating the last piece as I type this. I will definitely make this again.

When I was small, my grandmother would make apple cobbler all the time, as they had an apple orchard at their disposal.  It became something of a tradition to have it when we went to visit.  Three weeks ago, we lost my grandma. Using baking as a means of therapy, I made this about two weeks ago.  It tasted exactly like Grandma used to make.  I was able to sit at my table, taste this cobbler and look back on memories of doing the same with Grandma.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, and for the healing aid. :)

This was SO good! Tasted like a cross between deep dish apple pie and bread pudding. I served it with scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and my guests loved it! The recipe is pretty close to perfect -- only made a couple minor changes: added 1/2 cup more apple slices and 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, and to the batter I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 3 more tbsp evaporated milk. I will use this recipe again and again -- thanks!

This was AMAZING! My husband eats anything but rarely Raves!! He called his friends over to eat this! I modified it a little, because, frankly, that's what I do, cooking is like art, you have to modify! I added 1/2 c Melted butter to the apple mixture on the bottom in addition to the butter in the batter. Also, I added a few more pecans, cause well, they're good. I added some nutmeg and cinnamon for flavor and I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar (Splenda) for the batter instead of all white sugar. I will definately make this again! For apples, make sure you use something firm and tart. I used Jonathans they were good!

I followed this recipe exactly.  The baking time of 55 minutes is too long.  The apples were way too soft.  The top of the cobbler had cracks on the top of it.

Super easy.  Although I found that 4 cups of apples wasn't enough for the amount of thick, cakey, dough topping.  I will definitely make it again but double the apples.

My husband and I thought this was amazing!!  Who cares if it isn't exactly a cobbler--the point is that it tastes great!  The only change that I made was to double the pecan/cinnamon/sugar mixture and put in a 9x13 pan. I didn't really measure the apples--I just used 5 McIntosh apples.  Can't wait to make it again!

Made this for my husband's birthday (not a big cake eater!) and forgot to add the cup of sugar to the top layer of crust...just sprinkled on some cinnamon and sugar when I took it out of the oven and it came out delicious.  A full cup of sugar would be way too much.  Very tasty and the kitchen smelled great.

I made this recipe for Easter, and it was a huge hit!  I think next time, though, I'm going to use brown sugar in the topping instead of white.

I just made this for a company dessert for tomorrow night.  However, my husband & I tested a small bit of it with vanella ice cream.   It was just soooo good.  I did cut back on the sugar to a little less the 1/2 cup  & added more cinnamon.  Also I cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup in the mix.  I used granny apples.  I may try adding some raisens or fresh cranberries the next time.  Hubby & I decided that this was a fine dessert for company.  :)  It was so good. Thank you again Allrecipe. Happy Cooking.... Nana

This is not a traditional cobbler, but definitely try because with a little sweet cream or ice cream it is yummy. It is almost an apple cake.

This recipe is awesome and oh-so-easy!  I substituted light brown sugar in the sugar/cinnamon mix and used 1/2 C of white sugar and 1/2 C of light brown sugar in the flour mix.  It was delicious!!

I thought this would be wonderful, but it turned out to be very bland! If I make it again I am going to have to add some creativity to give it more flavor and oomph!  And it is VERY dry.

Mmmm this was absolutely heavenly. I took this to a potluck and it was cleaned up within minutes. Everyone raved about it. I did enjoy the topping as it was not too hard, sweet or runny. The whole dessert was well balanced and I did not find it too sweet. I will be trying this agian with other fruit and nut combinations.

Wow!  This was a great dessert.  I used 4 apples and layer them twice with the cinnamon mixture, then put the cobbler and pecans on top.  Took longer to bake, maybe cause my pan was deeper.

This was PERFECT! I followed another posters suggestion to use baking soda instead of powder and it was awesome. I would call this a cake and I have been trying for years to make an apple cake just like this.I did leave out the pecans because I did not have any.

I made this recipe when we had friends over for dinner and it was a hit! Baked it in an 8x8 pan, and it turned out very moist and juicy, very similar to a traditional cobbler. I did use 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar instead of the full 1 C white sugar for the cake mixture. Overall, a great recipe. Serving with vanilla ice cream is a MUST!!

Best cobbler in the world! Served this for dessert and now it's all anyone wants. Lady or Rome apples seem to taste the best in this recipe. Outrageous served warm w/ vanilla ice-cream.

I really liked this recipe! I reduced the sugar by a small amount and mixed everything together at the end. It came out really good, and the other reviewers who have mentioned a cake like consistency are right. most cobblers are just dustings of flour, sugar, cinnamon etc over fruit but this one has a nice cake-meets-cobbler consistency. Loved it!

I didn't really care for the pecans in this which is odd because I usually enjoy the combination of apples and nuts.  The cobbler part was also more cakey than I prefer, but thanks for sharing!

I made this up...(it's so easy!)...took it to work and I am not kidding, they were just about licking the bowl clean!  They loved it!  They only thing I would do differently is to add more cinnamon.  I love the stuff!  I made this for the first time yesterday and I went and bought more apples on my way home from work to make some more today for my husband.  I made this exactly according to the recipe the first time.  Add a little bit of vanilla ice cream...YUM!

Call it cake, call it cobbler. Who cares? It's delicious! I increased it and used a 9x13 pan. I used half and half instead of evaporated milk and pecan halves on the apples, none on top of the batter. Mine wasn't at all dry as some reviewers stated, but I used more liquid (half & half) than called for. Mine looked exactly like the picture on the recipe page!

My family devoured this poor pan of Apple Cobbler.  We made it EXACTLY as written but doubled it.  Yumm-O!  We served it hot with vanilla ice cream and it tasted like an apple dumpling. It is so easy my 6 & 8 year old daughters made the whole thing.  Try this, it's very good.

very good recipe.....But had to give it a little twist as I added a splash of vanilla to the wet ingredients, and a little nutmeg to the dry ingredients before combining....turned out awesome! (especially with a heaping scoop of butter pecan ice cream)  Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making it again.

Wonderful!! This is winner with my family.  I changed it by using Self Rising flour instead of All Purpose, and omitted the salt & baking powder. I made this while making lunch it was so easy to do. It will be a gift to other places and going to carry recipe with me overseas to cook for them.

This was good, but (for us) not off the charts great. It was average, and I guess I was hoping for something really deeeeeelicious!! It was fast and easy, but nothing too spectacular. I did put in a hint of Mexican vanilla, and I'm really glad I did that. IF IF IF I was to make this again I believe I would gently stir some of the apples "up" a little into the cobbler batter after you pour it over the top of them. I think if some of the apple pieces were baked up in the batter people would feel it was a bit more moist.

I was going to give this desert a 4 but then the guilt set in. It does taste delicious but I agree with several other reviewers that it's a little too dry. I will make it again this weekend for a clam bake. I may try cooking it at 350 degrees for a shorter time. Don't let my comments stoop you from making this because it really is a delicious desert.

Did it precisely by what was on the recipe, and it turned out perfectly!  Took it to a dinner party and all of my friends loved it and now think I'm the best cake-maker ever, if only they knew how easy it really was!

I used Gala apples and this was delicious! The only thing I did differently was add a few more pecans because I love them. I'll be making this a regular in my house.

This recipe is really easy and tasty, however I found the dough topping to be a bit too sweet and it overpowers the taste of the apple mixture.  I will try it again but with less sugar.

looked beautiful, easy to make and was delicious.  I did add some cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and clove to the sauce and during the last 10 minutes, I brushed the pie crust with milk and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.

I tried this recipe thinking I could make it as a dessert for Thanksgiving.  It was good, but certainly not Thanksgiving-worthy.  I thought the name "cobbler" was misleading...I thought it would be a little more liquidy.  It was more like a layer of apples with a layer of cake on top.  Tasted fine, but it didn't blow us away and it wasn't what I expected.

I'm sorry but this recipe I did not enjoy.  It was very dry and there was nothing juicy about it.  It was apples with a biscuit on top.  I thought cobbler was supposed to have some kind of juice in it.  MOIST?????  Well it didn't work for me and I followed the instructions.

Would not make it again...flavor is good but has a wet bready texture that I didn't care for. Peacans that are mixed with the apple mixture are soft and spongy.

I made this dish one time. It is very good in every way but next time I think I will cut back on the pecans. I will not cook it as long as I did the first one. It needs to be a little bit juicy. Ice cream goes well with this dish also.

This is terrific! But don't wait til fall to try it! I usually make Apple Crisp, and was looking for a different apple recipe. I've made it twice this week, and my family can't get enough of it! Very nice dessert. I also used walnuts the first time, and it was fine, but I think the pecans lend a better flavor to the dish. Thanks, Lori!

I love apples so I had to try this and was not disappointed. I did alter it a bit because I think that's the purpose of reading user reviews. I used brown sugar in the apples (3 granny's and 2 golden delicious) and some maple syrup, a little bit of water and flour plus the cinnamon and mixed the apples up before adding the topping. I decreased the sugar in the batter and used 1/3 cup of white and 1/3 cup of brown and added 2 more tbsp of evaporated milk. I also added the pecans (finely chopped, just a personal preference) to the batter instead. I meant to add vanilla but completely forgot and I think it turned out fine without it. The cooking time was pretty accurate for my oven. I love what one reviewer said, "Call it cake, call it cobbler. Who cares? It's delicious!" Agreed!

Marvelously delicious cobbler.  Like another poster, I doubled the recipe, cooked it an additional ten minutes in a 13x9 dish, and it was perfect.  I reduced the total sugar by about 1/2 cup, and I'll reduce it a little more next time.  I like to taste the tartness of the apples.  The pecans (my favorite nut!) add a delightful crunch to the cobbler, too.  If you like a lot of cinnamon, you might add more than the recipe calls for, but I found the amount in the recipe perfect as I don't like the cinnamon to overpower the flavor of the apples.  I will be making this again tonight to bring in to my coworkers tomorrow.  It's delicious!

Great recipe! very easy! the only modification I made is I poured a little maple syrup over the apples (always my secret for apple pies!) and I added 1 tsp vanilla to the egg/milk mixture and about 1 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture. I baked it in a deeper dish and the middle wasn't very done, so next time I'll use a more shallow pan. Thanks, Lori, for a wonderful go-to recipe!!

I don't know if this can be called an authentic cobbler or not, but it is delicious!  I didn't have pecans on hands, so I used walnuts instead.  The recipe received rave reviews.  The only reason I even got a piece was because I set mine aside first!

Easy recipe. A little too dry. More cake like than a cobbler.

My family loved the recipe.  The pecans add something special to the cobbler.  My only mistake was with the apples I used.  Should have used something a little more tart.

I followed the recipe and didn't like the results.  It was more like an   apple cake and it was dry.

This was a nice change from the usual apple crumble. I doubled the cake part but reduced the sugar a bit. Only used one layer of pecans. Served with vanilla ice cream.

This was awesome. I did not use pecans because we just don't like nuts in our food. Also did cut back on the sugar in the mixture to 3/4 cup and will try cutting back even farther as well and did use some brown sugar and white sugar combination. I used four apples as well. My husband went crazy over this and so did I. It was even better the next day wiht coffee, yum!

Excellent flavors, I liked the cakeyness of the topping.  I would have to lower the temp and bake longer.  It was to well done on the outside and almost not enough on the inside.

A winner! I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added 1 tsp of vanilla, a tad more milk and used brown sugar for 1/2 of the sugar called for in the cake portion. So moist and delicious. I will definitely make again.

This was fantastic. My husband is a diabetic so I used Splenda in place of the 1 cup of sugar. I also added a teaspoon allspice. I added some brown sugar with the 1/4 cup of pecans for the topping. Fast, easy and delicious.  How can you go wrong with that?  Yummer.  Thanks, Lori. I will be making this often.

I think it is a keeper, not fantastic but good.  Better the next day. Drier than cobbler which is a change.  I only changed  by using Splenda.  A cup of sugar is about 790 cal. a cup of Splenda is 95 cal.  So I saved 1185 calories.  Splenda is a little less sweet than sugar, so if you thought it was too sweet with sugar it well be just right.

I have made this recipe with rhubarb, with blackberries and with apples, and it is astoundingly delicious, especially with ice cream.  I never have evaporated milk so I used 1/2 and 1/2 or milk, it works fine.  The pecan give it a nice character and set it apart from the ordinary.

This dish tasted AMAZING! But that's not the best part, it was so easy to make!!

One side note: I changed the baking time from 55 minutes to 45 minutes, and it was perfect.

I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the instructions exactly.  I did not like the bread/cake like texture.  It was not at all like the rich flaky cobbler crust that I was expecting.  The flavor was ok.  I will try another apple recipe and leave this one alone.  3 stars for being edible.

I made this cobbler for a Christmas breakfast party and it got rave reviews.  This one is a keeper.  I know I will make it many times.  The only changes I made was to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup since so many reviewers made that suggestion and I increased to cinnamon to 1 tsp. Pat Muso

Just made this cobbler from the fresh apples we picked this weekend.  Followed the receipe and it came out great.  If baking in a glass dish, you might need to reduce the time in the oven as edges begin to brown too much.  Served to the kids with Fat Free whipped cream and they LOVED IT!

This was delicious!  I had gotten some apples from a friend and needed to use them up, so I decided to look for a good all purpose apple recipe.  I noticed there were several good reviews for this recipe, so I tried it.  I used Granny Smith and Fuji apples (about 5 of them) so the sugar measurement was perfect-off set the tartness of the Granny Smith's.  I also used a few more pecans than called for, just because I love pecans!  This was a hit a work and I think that I will be making it for Thanksgiving.  Thanks Lori for the great recipe-this will be s standard for me from now on!!!

This is the best home-made apple pie a have ever  made at home. It was delicious, juicy, moist, soft. 
I doubled the recipe and baked it in big 15-11 baking dish. Also I put some apple pieces to batter, mixed it and poured it to the layer of apples in the dish, so the apples would be not only on the bottom of the pie. It came out really good, more moisture, more flavor, more apples.

Outstanding!! Didn't have pecans since I live in China where those stuff are impossible to find, but it was delicious enough that my family enjoyed it. But wish I had some pecans, 'cause that'll most definately make these taste even better!! I'll have to make them with pecans when I get back home;) Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

We went apple picking and I had 30 pounds of apples to use up.  I wanted to get a little more creative than just making a bunch of pies.  There were so many great reviews for this, I decided to give it a try- I didn't see what was so great.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wasn't impressed.  The "cake" on top of the apples was too dense, the apples just didn't taste right, etc.  I gave it two stars because it was edible, but I feel like it was a waste of my apples.  I should have stuck with pies.

Solid, basic recipe, but did need some oomph.  I added nutmeg and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  I grated about 1/2 tsp fresh ginger into the melted butter to infuse it.  Be sure to use real butter.  Also, before you get everything assembled, check the gadget drawer to make sure you have one of those pointy can poker-openers.  I had one heck of a time getting the evap milk can open!!

this is really good! I ate it at room temp this mornign with my coffee yum! If I were you I would add alot more pecans, especially to the topping. I cut down th sugar and it was still great! Made personal sized portions and gave them 300 in th oven for about th same time as th original recipe suggests. Even my anti-apple friend said it was really good :) :) :)

AMAZING!  Very easy to make and well worth the effort.  What a wonderful treat!  I didn't change anything on the recipe.  We put a scoop of butter pecan ice cream on top when we ate it.  Yummy!

Made this for friends last weekend.  They all raved. Only change was subbing walnuts for pecans because I had them leftover from Christmas baking.  My friend's husband said it was the best Apple Cobbler he'd ever had...ever!  Quite a compliment!  Will def. make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I took this to a dinner party and it was a hit.  Since one review mentioned that it didn't come out of the pan well I put a streusel layer at the bottom and baked it first.  Then went on with the recipe.  I did have to add more liquid to the batter as I found it was too thick.  I also had some dried cherries so I chopped them and added them to the apples.  We are gluten free and I substituted a g/f flour mixture and no one knew!  I will make this again!  Jo Hills

Took this to a barbaque and everyone loved it! The only change I made was instead of pecan topping, I used a pie crumb topping (1 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup diced butter) and it turned out so yummy! Add a scoop of vanilla icecream and its pure bliss!

Love this recipe.  I did quite a lot of substituting due to not checking the cupboard first before starting the cobbler.  I used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated.  I also used brown sugar in the middle section and white (vanilla bean pod flavored) sugar for the top. I also had no pecans, so used raisins in the middle section and almonds on top.  I also put a bit of vanilla in the top batter.  It was great!!!!  Going for a second piece now.

Very good!  I like to use brown sugar in the apples, it makes  a beautiful caramel color and taste.  I also doubled the cinnamon and added a pinch of nutmeg. For the cake I had to use skim milk, it was perfect.  Will make this one again.

loved it! quick and easy.  Needs a bit more spice than calls for in the recipe. I used about 50% more cinnamon and added nutmeg and it could have used more.  Next time I'll include the lemon zest and juice as recommended by other reviewers and maybe add some currants.  This is great basic recipe that can easily be tweaked to ones personal taste.

Really nice. Followed the recipe exactly except not enough pecans for the top of the cobbler. This was my first cobbler and I am quite pleased with the outcome. WARNING Do not leave out the pecans!  It really brings  it together. Will make again. UPDATE! OMG - Even better the next day! The texture's softened and just come together so well. Didn't even need whipped cream, just PERFECT.

While this was tasty, I really thought it was missing something. I followed the recipe exactly, and just felt like it wasn't nearly as tasty as an apple crisp. I think maybe the cobbler part was what killed it for me. I did like the pecans in it though, and might have to try adding those to my crisp recipe.

Serve with vanilla ice cream hot from the oven or eat cold. Wonderful both ways. I doubled the recipe and put it into a 9 x 13 glass pan.

I loved it and all of my guests seemed to as well.  Some even asked for the recipe.  The only thing I would do different is to peel the apples...the recipe didn't say to but maybe that was supposed to be a given...anyhow, the peels made it very difficult to cut.

Way yummy!  To the cobbler/cake debate i'd say it's somewhere in the middle, closer to cobbler than to cake I think due to the volume of fruit. Whatever you call it, it's really delicious. I brought it to a potluck tonight and got compliments on it and when I got home ate a bit of the leftovers and wow!  it's good. I will be definitely making this again, probably later this week or early next week as I'm sure my family will feel there is not enough leftover for them! As per earlier reviews I cut back the sugar by maybe 1/4 or so, and very slightly increased the evaporated milk. I would make it the same way again, was perfect as far as I was concerned.

I made this last night and had it again for breakfast.  It was great!  I will definitely make it again.  i used 3 apples and an 8x8 pan and followed all of the rest of the recipe as written.  I baked for about 50 minutes.  Yumm!

Hmmm - can't imagine what was going on with the people who said this was not like a cobbler. I used a 7 x 11 glass pan, and used brown sugar for the topping on the apples and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the evaporated milk. The recipe cooked up just like an apple cobbler- maybe a tad too sweet, but very tasty with vanilla ice cream. The pecans added a great touch - I will be saving this recipe to make again!

This is so easy to make. I brought it to a party and it went very quickly and got rave reviews. I followed the exact recipe for the first one and substituted soy milk and decreased the sugar for the next one, both turned out great!

This recipe was VERY easy, and so delicious. My husband could not stop raving about it and ate like five servings. I'm forwarding this recipe to lots of my friends who like great and less-labour-intensive recipes. Thank you for sharing!

NOT your traditional cobbler!  Omitted pecans in apple mix.  Used walnuts instead on top of cake.  Next time I'll add a streusel topping. My husband said, "Ilove apple cobbler."  I responded that it was really more of an apple cake.  His response?  "Then I love apple cake!"

Good, but had to make adjustments.  I doubled the batter recipe from advice of other raters - I'm glad I did as it was necessary for a 2quart dish.  I substituted light brown sugar for half of white (I'd run out) and it gave it a lovely flavour.  I also added some flour to the fruit mixture to help with the moisture.  This is a lovely mixture and a great flavour if you get the right quantities.

Yummy. This wasn't quite what I thought it would be, a little bit too cake like for a cobbler..followed the recipe exactly as it was.. however it is delicious! The hubby didn't care about the texture..he just loved it, goes great w/vanilla ice cream. Will save the recipe.

This was OK.  It is more cake-like than like a cobbler.  I probably won't make it again, but look for something more special instead.

I chose this recipe because I already had most of the ingredients.  No one likes to buy ingredients you only use once.  It tasted great, was very simple and reheated wonderfully!

Excellent recipe. I received great compliments on how yummy it was. I used the honey crisp apples thinly sliced for the recipe and added just a little nutmeg and vanilla. Great with vanilla bean ice cream:)

Even tho I used tart apples, this was too sweet for us. If I make it again, I will use less sugar on the apples. Also, I will use more apples--too much "dough" compared to apples.  Not a great cobbler recipe.

This recipe is outstanding!  Just made it again yesterday, and finally got it perfect.  For me the secret was getting the apple slices perfectly thin, and then I sliced them in half.  I baked this in a 9X11 glass baking dish, and it came out perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked it for exactly 55 minutes.  I live in the mountains in New Mexico, and some times baking times need to be altered slightly.  But this one worked out just fine as written.  So far this is my husband's favorite recipe that I've tried from the AllRecipe's site.  Thank you so much, Lori Smith for sharing it!

My daughter loves apple pie but this cobbler is now her favorite.  I followed directions as written and used Fuji apples.  Served this with vanilla ice cream.  This was so good, thanks for sharing.

This is the third time I have made this.  Use a little more milk and pecans and a squeeze of fresh lemon on the apples.( I've used Granny and Gala, Gala being the best for us) It's super delicious with vanilla ice cream. Warm is the best!!!

It was delicious but I wasn't certain I followed the recipe correctly. The batter didn't pour, it was thick like an eclair dough that had to be spooned on in blobs. I found it too sweet and would add more cinnamon, but my guests loved it and it was devoured in no time.

I doubled the recipe for all the ingredients except for sugar. I used 1/4 cup to coat the apples and 1 cup for the topping. I found this to be sweet enough, especially if served with ice cream.

Sinfully delicious! Just took mine out of the oven and my husband can't stay out of the kitchen. Super Yummy! I added 2tsp of vanilla, used brown sugar and white sugar, and baked for 45 mins instead of 55.

I was given some apples for baking and wanted something quick and lite. So I actually halved ingredients that I could as I didn't have enough for the 8 servings. It was great. Topped it with whip cream! I added a 1/2 T of vanilla..just a twist. Thanks for the recipe. I used a 1/1/2 qt baking dish. And baked in convection for 45 min.

This was great served with vanilla bean ice cream!  I made a few changes to accommodate my kitchen: I used 1/2 regular milk and 1/2 greek yogurt as a substitute for the evaporated milk; used a "pumpkin pie mix" of spices I put together: cinnamon, allspice, clove, ginger; and cut the sugar in the batter in half.  I also used brown sugar over the apples.
A total winner, and much easier than the pie I was considering...

LOVE IT! This recipe deserves an extra star. I've followed the instructions exactly with great success at least half a dozen times now. It's delicious and everyone always loves it. The only deviation I've made is using less pecans, but only bc I was running low.

I made this exactly as written except that I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 pan.  We all loved it, and it is as good if not better cold the next day.  It is definitely a keeper as we say in our family!

This was a really good, easy recipe.  The only thing I would change next time is I will increase the apples and sugar portion and decrease the breaded topping a little.  But that is just my personal preference, it was also great as is.

I used 1% milk and did not put pecans in. It came out great. My consistency was a little bit on the most side and less on the cake like side, but delicious none the less.

Awesome dish, thanks!   I ended up using buttermilk instead of evaporated milk, because I had it on hand, and it came out beautifully. Also, we're pecan lover, so I covered the entire top with whole pecans.  We loved it.

Sooooo very very yummy!!!  I doubled the recipe.  The only thing I would do personally is cut the sugar down on the apples.  My family didn't think so....was a huge hit!!

It was okay.  Didn't really taste like a traditional cobbler - the "crust" was more like cake sitting on the apples.  Also rather dry.  The pecans tasted great, and if you had it with vanilla ice cream it was overall a good dessert, but not exactly what I was looking for.

This is truly one of the best recipes I have ever tasted.  Mine didn't come out quite like the picture - the batter was pretty thick and sat atop the apples, not nestled down in them, but it was still fantastic!  Taste, texture and appearance were all excellent.  I have always made apple crisp in the fall, but I think our fall tradition has changed now to this recipe!  Definitely a "must try"!

I have to totally disagree with Emax503.  I've made this cobbler twice and am actually making it again tomorror for a family potluck.  Each time it has turned out AMAZING!!  It got rave reviews at our church potluck last month.  Tons of ladies wanted the recipe because it turned out so amazing.  Not dry at all and I used fresh apples, not canned.  And mine looked as yummy as the picture shown.  Great recipe Lori!!  This is a keeper and one I'll make very often!

I really love this recipe. So easy and simple and even a little forgiving (I used regular milk and walnuts instead of pecans) and it came out simply delicious and perfectly right on all quantities (sweet enough as is!). The bottom does come appart so I am plannig to make some crust for the bottom, lay the apples and top as per recipe. Otherwise, I would totally make this again!

Was a bit more dry than I'd have liked (the topping I mean, the apples made good juices). Mine looks NOTHING like the photo by SunFlower. Mine will NOT slice like that. I'm pretty sure that, for me, it's worth the effort to just make a pie crust next time. My batter for the topping would not have poured. I added fat-free half and half in small amounts until it was vaguely pourable, then smoothed it over the top.

We used apple pie filling instead, which still came out REALLY good. Four stars only b/c the cobbler turned out nothing like what it shows, definitely more cake/bread-like. But we still gobbled it up!

Wow! This was absolutely delicious! I also doubled the batch and cooked it in a 10x13" pan but it took 20 minutes longer to cook. I used 100% whole wheat white flour, 1/2 raw and 1/2 organic sugar.

This was easy and VERY Yummy! Unfortunatly I didnt have any pacans to put in. It was good without them, but I felt it needed that crunch. After it was done, It didnt last but a couple of hours in my household. My husband told me this is definatly a keeper.

Made this for a dinner party on vacation in Connecicut after we'd picked apples in a local orchard. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!! Perfect combo of fresh-picked apples and cool fall weather! :-D I sliced the apples very thin and used several different types. Thanks for a truly memorable dessert!

I made this last night.  One reviewer mentioned that her cobbler was done on top but not finished cooking in the middle.  I had the same problem.  It still tasted alright though.  Plus, one of my house guests said it was the best apple dish that he had eaten in a long time.  Maybe he was just being polite. :)  Who knows!  Next time if I make it, I will cook it a little bit longer and see if that improves it.

This was great!  I loved the sweet cake topping. Depending on the apples used, the filling could be a bit watery.  Adding a couple of tablespoons of flour might help thicken the apple filling. Excellent regardless.

This is really good.  I used apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon.  I tossed the apples with the apple pie spice/sugar mixture.  I omitted the pecans (didn't have any) and added a little vanilla to the batter.  This smelled wonderful baking and wss so tasty.  I topped the warm cobbler with homemade vanilla ice cream, which made it even better.

Excellent recipe!  I added vanilla as suggested by others.  The only thing I'll change next time: instead of putting 1 layer of each, I'll do 2 layers (with same amount of ingredients).  So it'll look like: apples|sugar crumbs|batter|apples|sugar crumbs|batter

Well received.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake-like mix, mixed the apples, sugar, cinn, and pecans along with two dashes of nutmeg before placing in dish, added all of the pecans to the original mixture rather than putting some on top and baked in a square pan.  Yummy!

I baked this in a round 10 x 1 ceramic quiche pan.  There was slighly too much batter for that size dish. I made the following changes: Used vanilla soymilk in place of the condensed milk. Used 1/3c. whole wheat flour and 2/3c. white flour. Reduced the sugar in the dough to 2/3 cup, using brown sugar for half of it. Added 1 tsp. vanilla to dough. Used pecan halves instead of chopped pecans for topping. This is a quick, simple, homestyle dessert that doesn't require any equipment (mixer, food processor), so clean-up is easy. It's quite yummy - and the pecans are great in it - but it's not wildly exciting as far as desserts go. I'd like to try this recipe again using some different fruits, or maybe adding a handful of frozen raspberries in with the apples.

Very good recipe.  I followed it as is and it turned out pretty good.  My guests certainly enjoyed it.  There was none left.  I'll use this one again.

I followed the recipe as written and it was GREAT!  Everyone loved it.  I used 3 apples and baked it in a round enameled cast iron pan which worked out perfectly.  It was nice and brown and ready in 45 minutes (10 less than stated).

This was good. I usually cut the sugar back, but could have cut more as it was really sweet. And yes, as others have stated it is more cake and dry like. But the picture sure looks good!

We had bought a large amount of apples from the orchard last week.  I was looking for a recipe for something other than apple dumplings.  We overdid it on the apple dumplings!  This cobbler was awesome!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I am going to make it using splenda tomorrow.  Thank you for putting this recipe up.  I loved it!

The recipe turned out to be OK. My husband did not particularly care for it, being that it came out more like a bread pudding than a cobbler. I read the other reviews that said it was not that moist. So I tried adding more buttermilk. That still did not help. THe overall taste is great; although I was looking for something a little more juicy. I also think that there are a little too many pecans in the recipe.

I made this for my husband's birthday dessert.  He loved it and ate almost half the pan.  I thought the texture was a little doughy--definitely not like cobblers I'd made in the past.  Also, I used all Granny Smith apples so it was definitely not too sweet.  Definitely need to include the pecans to give it some crunch.

This is going into my all-time favorites.  I love pecans and any recipe calling for them I am natually attracted to.  I only used whole pecans my boyfreind is a walnut fan.  With the whole pecans he could see better and move around them however he did come back for seconds.

WOW! This is the best Apple Cobbler I've ever eaten.  I've been looking for a good Apple Cobbler recipe for a couple years, and now my search is finally over.  I followed the recipe exactly, but left out the pecans since I didn't have any on hand.  It turned out just perfect.  This is a keeper that I will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing Lori!

Cherries are so good right now (It's June) that I substituted them for the apples.  Delicious!  My husband doesn't even like Cherries, but loved this.  Serve it warm and top it with some ice cream.

This was a fantastic recipe.  The pecans really add a lot.  I made it for a luncheon at our Senior's club, and many people asked me for the recipe.  Everyone loved it!  I did serve it with whipped cream that was flavored with cider mulling spice.  A nice addition!

I made this cobbler with hand-picked fresh apples.  Talk about good!  My only issue with this recipe was that it wasn't very moist - I'm not sure what to change to make it moister - maybe a little more milk and/or butter.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make but tasted rather bland. I even increased the amount of cinnamon and also added nutmeg to increase flavor but was still kind of bland. But everyone who tried it thought it was great! husband ate almost one pan by himself

Very tasty! I wouldn't really call it a cobbler though. It was definitely more cake like. A few changes I will make next time. I would recommend using 6-7 apples instead of 4. I used pretty decent sized apples and it was about 75% cake and 25% apples. I added additional cinnamon and coated the pecans on top in some butter and brown sugar before sprinkling. Overall it was a big hit on Christmas Eve!

Delicious!!! I decided to double the batter recipe. I goofed and ended up not having evaporated milk. So I used some old buttermilk which almost turned to a "clotting" disaster saved by adding about 1/4 cup of whole milk to the final batter mixture. I also added 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and almond extract to the wet ingredients. I know I don't like things too sweet, so I only used about a 1/4 cup sugar with the apples (4 medium to large Fuji) and 1 cup of sugar to the batter (again I was doubling the batter; all the batter ingredients were doubled except the butter, I used a whole stick). Still came out sweet. This has go to be the best dessert I've made, and I do make some great banana bread. Even my kid says this is better. A winner for sure. I'll be sure to stock up on evaporated milk from now on?? (I usually don't like nuts in my food, so I used 1/4 cup of pecan pieces (for cookies) over the apples, and didn't add any on top of the batter; I used a 13*9 pan). Enjoy!

Delicious, but def not a cobbler in my experience. Was more like an apple cake. Again, delicious, but my southern family and friends shared that was definitely not a cobbler.

It was an okay recipe. I did reduce the sugar in the cake part in half and added vanilla and cinnamon as others suggested. It still didn’t have much flavor. It’s ok with a light cake on top of apples.  I would not make it again.  I’d rather make an apple crisp .

Wow! Just incredible. Made it exactly as written except I sprinkled about 2/3 cup of pecans on top instead of 1/4 cup. Everyone raved. One of the best desserts I’ve ever made. Used honeycrisp apples. Yum!

This is a wonderful dessert! Made as is except for no pecans. I substituted Rice Krispies to cover it, about 1 cup. Adds a nice crunch to the top and does not burn.

Not quite a cobbler, pie or cake but it is good.  I used a combination of sweet and tart apples and it turned out really well.

I did not make any changes, but I would make an extra amount of the biscuit mixture, maybe 1/2 more to cover all of the apples.  Also it needs to bake way longer than the recipe calls for to ensure the topping is done.

I made this according to the recipe.  However, I did use a 9X13 dish versus a 2 quart casserole bowl.  It was thin but delicious.  Next time I will double the batter for this size dish.

This wasn't what I consider a "cobbler." Based upon other comments, I substituted half the white sugar with light brown, added a tiny bit of lemon juice to keep the apple color, and added a dash each of nutmeg and clove.  Since others commented on a cake-like texture, I used baking soda rather than powder. Also, I only had walnuts, with which I subbed the pecans. Usually, walnuts combine well with apple. The final product was less than desirable, but a rebake without my changes could prove this recipe's worth, I suppose.

This was really good!   I did make some minor changes to the recipe.   I roasted the pecans before adding to the mixture and I only used about half of the sugar cinnamon mix.   It turned out really great!!   Hit of the house tonight!

Okay but not as good as I thought It would be after all the good ratings. The family got board of eating it so threw out the last 1/4. Don't bother making this recipe, you will be disappointed.

This was delicious! I served it at a brunch and everyone loved it! I am gluten and lactose intolerant so I used all-purpose gluten free flour and unsweetened almond milk. I also left out the pecans because I didn't have them. Turned out great and I will definitely make it again!

I followed the recipe and added  one additional ingredient  (1 teaspoon vanilla)
The cobbler was delicious! We ate it with whip cream. Next time we'll have it with vanilla ice cream ?? Thank you for the yummy recipe!

Overall a delicious cobbler, but my wife and I both thought that there was too much breading compared to the amount of apples. We might try making it again with less of the bread mixture on top.

I followed the suggestions of several others and reduced  the sugar by 1/2 cup. Someone also suggested doubling the amount of dough, but I don't understand why because I believe there is too much dough in the original recipe. There's about two times more dough then there is fruit. I thought this wasn't sweet enough and I should've gone with the original one cup of sugar on the fruit. I thought the dough was bland  and that was way too much of it and it was heavy. I don't think I would make this again.

Gluten Free!! I made this recipe substituting Namaste Gluten Free Perfect Flour Blend for the wheat flour and  almond milk for the evaporated milk. I  cut the sugar amounts in half and  used a 50/50 blend of Xylitol/White sugar. I used baking soda instead of baking powder as recommended by others. I also added   extra pecans (we love pecans) and some fresh grated nutmeg to the apple mixture and flour mixture. The results were delicious and plenty sweet for us!!

Wonderful.  At an evening gathering of friends, I encouraged them to take seconds and 6 of 7 did!  Even the one who doesn't normally eat desserts.  

(I did reduce the sugar by about half.)

I can't honestly critique the recipe as such because I'm sure it is fine and I followed it to a tee.  It just didn't knock my socks off but the others who ate it with me said it was excellent.  I'm certain there is a better than good chance that others will love it if they try it.  I'm more of a crumble or pie person,  I think.
I recommend at least giving it a try.

Easy as can be and SO TASTY!  This is a winner of a dessert!  We had fresh apples we picked at an orchard, so that was a plus up, but I will definitely make this again! I doubled the cinnamon and needed another quarter cup pecans for the top, otherwise made it just as written. I found the baking time to be spot on at 55 minutes.  A WINNER!

This was an ok apple treat but I would have called it something other than a cobbler. The cake like topping was good, it just doesn't make me think cobbler.

Oh my, this was wonderful.  I made it with Jonathon apples otherwise everything was the same.  It had the perfect amount of cinnamon.  I will make this again and again.

This is good, but it comes out very cake-like. I prefer something more pie- or crisp-like.

Everyone really enjoyed this cobbler. It was a little too sweet for us, so next time I will half the sugar. We added more cinnamon and changed the baking powder to baking soda as stated in other reviews, but otherwise kept the recipe as written. It only needed to bake for 45 minutes and turned out great.

Loved this recipe and followed it exactly as written but added sliced almonds instead of pecans and it was delish! If you have a newer oven start checking it around the 45 min mark though. The top does have a cake like texture to it but over all I'm for sure going to make this again!

The flavor was very good but my batter was dry and crumbly.  I kept looking at the recipe directions wondering where more liquid would be introduced.  If I make this again, I'll add some milk or water to thin out the batter and get more of a cake than a crumble.  Other people's pictures make it seem like a cake but the topping was crumbly and dry after baking.  The recipe yielded enough for 2 pie pans.

This recipe was fantastic! I made it as the recipe stated except gluten free, using Pamela's bread mix in place of 1 cup flour and an extra egg.  It was fantastic.  The un-gluten free people in my family said, 'this doesn't even taste like gluten free'

The flavor was good but it was dry like an apple cake rather than moist lik a cobbler but was great with ice cream. I would add more cinnamon next time.

Made this recipe for supper - according to the reviews that I read, it sounded pretty awesome.  It was OK but wasn't impressed with the results.  Was too dry, probably the cooking time was too much.  Will try this recipe again - loved the taste of the apples and cinnamon, though

This was a beautiful cobbler!  I made a few adjustments using only 3/4 c splenda total to replace the sugar..it was plenty sweet, I used all whole wheat flour for the crust, I didn't have any evaporate milk so I used fat free half & half.  I replaced half the butter with canola oil.  The amount of sugar would depend on the apples you use.  I used fresh honey crisp apples from the tree.  If you use splenda in the recipe for the crust( I used 1/4 cup) you have to broil it at the end for approx. 3-5 mins. to brown it, but watch it closely.  I will make this again and again...loved it!

Sorry, we were disappointed with this. We are apple dessert lovers and with the tremendous amount of great apple desserts out there, this would not be my choice of desserts. The texture of the topping wasn't bad, but the really wasn't a lot of flavor to the cake. Won't be making this again.

My issue with the desert is that it's dry. If you are using canned apples use some of the juice.  Mine also didn't look anything like the picture SunFlower took.  I wasn't impressed and I was excited to be making this desert because of the great reviews.

It was good. It was very flavorful. The cream cheese icing was great. It had a cake like texture. The apples were soft and tasty. "Make you wanna slap yo mama!" 6th period.

I LOVE this recipe.  It doesn't have as many "juices" as other cobblers so if you are a fan of that then you might not like it though.  I serve with caramel/pecans drizzled on top and serve with vanilla ice cream.  YUM!

I made this last weekend & it was just ok.  it definitely is more doughy than most cobblers I'm  use to.  I did think the nuts gave it a nice twist but I'll keep searching to find just the right recipe.

This recipe is good. I prefer my apple cobbler to be a bit sweeter so next time I will add more sugar. Other than that, it was pretty good with vanilla icecream.

Nothing like a cobbler at all. This has more of a cake like textue. I had a hard time getting mine done, the top was brown, but the center was mush. Don't think I'll try this one again.

Simple recipe, delivers on taste, texture and smell... a hit with everyone here.  Of course, I doubled it, (I double everything with 4 guys to feed) Subbed some brown sugar and and added a dash of vanilla.  Very good!

This was excellent!  The only change I made was using 1/2 cup of pecans instead of the 1/4 cup it called for with the mixture to place on the top.  Absolutely loved it!

I loved this recipe! I made it for my in-laws and the next day my mother-in-law called me up needing the recipe. This recipe is a total keeper. I added more pecans on top because my family really likes pecan. Great recipe and easy to make!

Very, very good.  Made this as a last minute dessert last Sunday.  Slicing the apples was time consuming, but overall the recipe was easy with great results.  I used a mix of granny smith and fuji apples.

This is the best apple cobbler I've ever made or eaten!  It was absolutely delicious.  The right amount of pecans with a hint of cinnamon!!  Absolutely heavenly!  Sometimes I take out the pecans because my husband doesn't like them and it is still pretty good.  But personally the pecans are what make it.  It is pretty easy to throw together, too!

I am only rating this a four star because to me this is not a cobbler.  It is more of a cake than anything, but it is delicious.  Everyone liked it and it's great when your looking for something easy and a little different.

This cobbler had a wonderful flavor, but I felt the crust mixture was too thick.  Next time, I'll double the apple mixture and it should turn out just right.  The pecans are a wonderful touch.

Made this recipe twice in one weeks time; once with pecans and once without.  Each time I made it the texture was different and I followed the recipe both times.  Loved both!!!

This is also good with fresh pears, but you need less sugar.  It's one of the best recipes I've used for apple cobblers.  However, I don't think it worked as well when I used the recipe for blackberries.

This was a very easy recipe. The topping turned out more like a pound cake than a cobbler. The pecans do give it a lot of flavor so don't skip this ingredient. All in all this cobbler was ordinary.

Yum... this was wonderful.  My boyfriend requested an apple cobbler for Thanksgiving (coming up next week now) and I gave it a trial run this past weekend- he gave it a "perfect" rating!  I baked the cobbler in a 1 1/2 quart round baking dish and didn't use all of the nuts, I didn't want to overpower the apples.  I also didn't use all of the mixture over the apples, since I baked it in a smaller dish.  I can't wait to take this to our family Thanksgiving.  Thanks, Lori!

I'm not a big apple pie fan so was somewhat reluctant to try this taste-treat. I was pleasantly surprised, it was pretty good. Thanks for sharing.

These are very tasty.  I used walnuts instead of Pecans and it turned out delicious.  Definately a recipe to keep on hand when trying to use up your fall apples.

Very "soul-warming" dish.  Although, I like my cobblers a little runnier. May tweak it a little next time to get that affect.  Otherwise, what a yummy way to use those fall apples!
