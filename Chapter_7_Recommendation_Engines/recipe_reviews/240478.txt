A very nice recipe although not much different than Oatmeal Cookies with Chocolate Chips.  I was hoping the browned butter would have a more pronounced taste.  They hold their shape well.  Thanks!

These are really good, crispy and buttery. I bake half and freeze the rest for great cookies in a jiffy.
