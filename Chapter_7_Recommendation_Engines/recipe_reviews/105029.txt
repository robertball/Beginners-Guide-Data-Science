downright awful.  does not taste like cream or garlic.  it is totally overpowered by parmesean cheese.  i would omit the cheese entirely, or at least reduce it by 75% if I were to try again.  However, this did not show enough promise to try again.

I thought this came out perfect consistency wise. I did add 2 additional cloves of garlic (for a total of 6), but felt it could still use two more. Also, with the sweetness from the taragon, cream, and garlic all working together I felt like perhaps 1/2 tsp. of cayenne might be in order next time. All in all though ...it's a keeper. Ready to eat in 30 minutes tops - always need those recipes! Thanks Icy!

Overall, a good sauce.  Used butter and cut onions in half and eliminated the tarragon, as I don't care for the flavor.  I would prefer a stronger garlic flavor, so next time, I'll double it.  I was worried about the Parmesan based on another reviewer, so I cut that in half.  It needs the full amount.

I love the taste of tarragon, especially with chicken. Very flavorful, didn't find a thing wrong with the taste. It is very thick and heavy and would have worked great on pasta! I was looking for a sauce for chicken the night I made this and it was a little too thick for what I was looking for. I needed to get dinner on the table or would have tried to thin it a bit. Couldn't beat it for the flavor though! Thanks for the recipe!

I had to change a few things because I used this as pizza sauce. I have confidence that is it a good sauce 'as is' on pasta or over chicken, but it worked out good for pizza too! I made my own chicken garlic pizza with half this recipe. I omitted tarragon (don't like it anyway), doubled the garlic (it needed it), used cream instead of half & half, and used chicken stock instead of wine. Oh, and I use only butter, never margarine. It turned out well.

This was a tasty cream sauce.  Very heavy but definitely tasty!  I was concerned with the tarragon reviews so I just omitted that, and the over all flavor was very good.  I used butter instead of margarine and used one large shallot instead of the onion.

It was really good - a keeper!  I used fresh tarragon, since I had it.  I love tarragon, so not sure why so many others don't and left it out - it was just right. My vegetarian (not vegan) daughter loved it.  The only "problem" is that I made 1/2 the recipe for 3 of us with tortellinis, and had a huge amount of sauce.  I used about 1/3 of the sauce.  I suggest always making 1/2 and saving some (I am freezing to see if that works).

Delicious! The tarragon flavor is not overpowering at all. After reading reviews I halved the recipe, and it still made plenty of sauce. I love garlic so I didn't cut that in half, and I think it still could have used a touch more. Will definitely make again!

I find it ironic that people that don't like tarragon would make a recipe that specifically says tarragon in the name of the recipe. I am not much for margarine over butter and so I substitute that out. Over all a great recipe and so many variations can be done with it. Tarragon is a distinct and strong flavor. It can easily be overused but in this case I thought it was perfect.

Whoever said this recipe was bad must have messed something up on their end.  I omitted the tarragon because of personal taste, but left everything else the same.  Served it over ravioli and chicken, and loved it.
