Agree it is a quick and tasty meal. a great alternative to dairy. this was my first time cooking with nutritional yeast. I will be looking to make more dishes like this. chicken was very moist too. ..I am surprised more have not reviewed this recipe. thanks for sharing!...I put thawed chicken breasts into slow cooker (kitchen aid brand) and cooked on high for approximately 2 hrs. any longer, I think the quinoa may have crusted on the sides of the pot.

Was very good, I used chicken legs & thighs, it did not take as long in the slow cooker.  My husband  really like it.  Will definitely make again.

I use this a lot for a quick family meal. Flavorful for the little prep required & good way to use some chicken from the freezer.

Not at all what I expected. Consistency did not match photos. Too salty, I thought. Won’t make it again.

Meh. I felt like I measured out and put a lot of ingredients in there, but in the end, it was flavorless. Half tempted to try again, but double up on seasonings, and maybe mix some of the mustard in the quinoa...or maybe just use brown rice instead? The chicken was good though!

I have to say I was very excited to make this recipe, but was so disappointed when I ate it.  The only thing I changed was dijon mustard in place of spicy brown, (only because I didn’t have any).  I found it to be very salty tasting for some reason.  If anyone has any ideas about why that would be, I’d love to know.  I have never used nutritional yeast before, could that be it?
One thing that made me happy was that my husband really liked it.  Oh, and the chicken was great, nice and tender.

Flavor was good. I used bouillon with the water and didn't have spicy mustard so made my own spices to add some heat. Turned out well but I'm going to keep playing with it to find the perfect balance.

I was pretty disappointed in it. Seemed to be flavorless and mushy. If I try this again, I'm going to season chicken breasts with salt/pepper and instead of using water, use chicken stock.

Quinoa came out mushy but YUMMY. Cooked low 6 hours with frozen chicken breasts - came out dry, and quinoa mix slightly burnt on sides of the crock pot. May try with fresh chicken on low for 3-4 hours next time.

This is really good and simple! One change: I used ground almonds instead of nutritional yeast. (I didn't have any.)

This was yummy. My chicken breasts were not frozen so I adjusted the cooking time and temp.. Otherwise I made as per the recipe. The quinoa got a little on the soft side, so I would suggest checking the dish a little sooner than you think it might be done. So much variation in crockpot temps.. not the recipes issue.. equipment!
