SO good - and fairly healthy, w/ less butter (recommend melting & brushing on w/ pastry brush so you use a lot less) & low-fat cheese.  Served w/ brown rice mixed w/ salsa & low-fat sour cream on the side to dip the wrap.  Definitely a keeper!  ............... also, to fold a wrap, lay it flat, put everything in the middle, fold left & right side into the middle, hold in place w/ your fingers while you use your thumbs to fold in the edge that is closest to you, press & start to roll the wrap away from you, keeping the sides tucked as you roll. You can use a little bit of cheese as "glue" on the edge that folds over (ends up being on the bottom as you roll.)  Works best when you cook the side w/ the folds first, otherwise it opens up too easily when you try to flip it.

Easy and delicious, with room for personal taste adjustment. What more do you need? Don't add too much filling or it will be impossible to roll, but if the wrap starts to open on the pan, don't panic; nudge it back as best you can (it will be hot!), press it down with a spatula, and when the tortilla cools it will be quite stiff. I brushed a small amount of butter over the up-side of the wrap, rather than add it awkwardly to the pan, and they came out crisp and delicious. Also, I only had dried cilantro, so don't let that stop you from trying this.
UPDATE 5/12: Use butter spray like Parkay or something to make this WAY easier. I also like to add some dried cumin seed and garlic powder. I tried no-salt-added beans and did not like it nearly as much. I've made this with and without some ingredients on hand, and ultimately it's just best with the tomato and green onion, but extra chunky salsa can be added if you're out of tomato and desperate for a quick lunch.

Delicious!!  I added chicken to mine.  I will buy the bigger tortillas next time as regular sized seemed a bit small.

This was yummy! I used organic black beans, homemade salsa, doubled the cilantro and I used less cheese on mine than I did my husband. I added just a little of my casa dressing in with the black bean mash. I did not need the butter or margerine. GREAT pantry-on-hand lunch.

I attempted to cut fat by using olive oil spray instead of butter, which I do not recommend as the tortilla stuck to the pan and the wrap started to fall apart. Fail! Nonetheless, I was able to cram everything back in, and it did get a little crispy and tasted good. Next time I'll try to wrap it in foil and bake it, as someone else suggested, to save the calories for the cheese only.

I halved this recipe and followed it with just one substitution - I only had a Monterey Jack/Cheddar blend. The trick is to fry the first side long enough to ensure they don't fall apart. These are good, but I needed extra salsa on top for the full effect. Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe!

I thought the ingredients were a bit lopsided and also that there wasn't near enough filling.  So I doubled the first four ingredients.  And then used only 2 of the larger side flour tortillas.  (This might be equivalent to 5 or 6 of those small ones.)  I also did not cook them for very long, just enough to heat them up and melt the cheese.  They were pretty good, but not very filling.  I'd have to consider this more like 2 servings.

This was really good - it reminded me of Chipotle's burritos somewhat.  I had some extra orange bell pepper and cooked white rice I needed to get rid of, so i threw that into the mix as well.  Instead of grilling it in a skillet, I just wrapped the filled tortillas in tin foil and put them in the oven on 325 for 10 minutes to get them warmed up (because I always make a mess when trying to do stuff like this on the stove).  I may try adding some sort of meat next time.  Great base recipe!

I was looking for a way to use shredded roast beef from a not-so-successful recipe.  So, I subbed the roast beef for the black beans.  I didn't add the salsa to the meat, used it as a condiment instead.  Really yummy - although I haven't had one in years, it reminded me a bit of a really light version of a chimichanga.  We liked this.
