I thought this recipe was too good to be true.  It just sounded too easy and is so inexpensive to make.  It didn't look so great while it was cooking either. I'm not going to lie...it is incredible! It is so flavorful and tender. I cook for two men...my husband and my brother in law, both firefighers, and both good cooks themselves.  They just loved this and can't wait to cook it at work.  I served it with sushi rice and plain sauted zuchini...which complimented the recipe perfectly. The only thing I altered...I filled the chicken cavity with onion and doubled the liquid.  So good!

Reading the recipe and reviews I did notice one thing WAS missing...PEPPER. I modified the recipe for a 5 lb chicken (changed serving size to 10) and then added 1 tbsp pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.) I skinned the chicken and put all the modified ingredients in the crock pot itself, and then mixed them right there in the pot, then I put the chicken in and turned it over a couple times to get the mixture all over it and cooked it breast side down. It was wonderful! My son even asked for seconds and usually doesn't like eating chicken. Served it with rice cooked with the rest of the chicken broth (1 cup left from can) and some herbs de province in the rice cooker. Will definately be made again

Talk about fall off the bone! I used a 3 lb chicken and will cook it for less time in the future.  I substituted lime juice for the lemon (didn't have lemon), increased the garlic, added onion powder & pepper and decreased the olive oil, as suggested. Instead of removing the skin completely, I loosed it all around the breast and back and marinated the chicken inside the crock for about an hour before I turned it on. I also turned the chicken a few times while cooking. It came out super tender and flavorful. I made cocnut rice and green beans to go with. Yummy!

I made this for my boyfriend tonight.  He loved it and so did I.  I only made one change to the recipe.  I did not have honey, so I used some real maple syrup I had.  It was delicious.  To go along with it I made some white rice, and instead of using water I used some of the slow cooker juice, some chicken broth and a little water to cook the rice.  Then I stir fried the rice after it was done with fresh mushrooms and topped with some green onions.  (I added some butter and more slow cooker juice in with the stir fry) Then I put the chicken on top.  He loved it and he can be a critical SOB (lol).

This recipe was delicious however there was way too much oil.  It only needs about 1 tablespoon of oil not the 1/3 cup called for in the recipe.  To try to correct the amount of oil called for I added more soy sauce & chicken broth. I had to add more soy sauce & chicken broth.  I omitted the sesame oil as I am not a big fan & put in about a teaspoon of fresh ginger.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!!! Used half the olive oil and no sesame oil.  Added more honey and veggies, and used skinless boneless chicken thighs.  Also made the sauce thicker with cornstarch.  Cooked on low for 2 1/2 hours in small crockpot.  Ate with Jasmine Rice...leftovers were even better!!!

I've been looking for a whole chicken recipe (got a couple birds in the deep freeze) and this tasted great.  The meat was very tender (I put it breast side down).  I kinda guessed at the amount of garlic; I crushed 6 cloves and threw a couple whole into the cavity for good measure--still could have used more.  I will definitely make this again, tweaking the spices a little to suit my taste.

I followed other suggestions and decreased the amount of olive oil, but only a little.  I put the chicken in breast side down to make sure that part stayed moist since it was submerged in the liquid.  I also basted the chicken ~ 30 mins or so.  My husband loved it and at almost the whole chicken by himself.  Definately will make this again.

This was delicious! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it was a big hit with my family. the sauce is delicious served over rice. I usually add my own touches to a recipe , but I followed this one exactly and it was great! Next time I might try adding some broccolli or carrots just for added nutrition.

I liked the flavor of this and I think making sure you use the sesame oil is important because it was a lot of the flavor.  I did make the mistake of using boneless skinless breasts which I think is why mine wasn't oily like some people mentioned, but that said, it took a lot longer to cook for mine to fall apart.

I actually followed the advice of number of reviewers. The one review that struck me is the one whereby fresh minced ginger and fish sauce were added. I did double the recipe sauce. However, I left out the olive oil, and kept in the sesame oil. Sesame oil is phenomenal in Asian cooking--it's a staple in my house. (You must purchase at an Asian Market-like store. Incredibly cheap and you get 8 times more than you get at a chain grocer. The main grocery chains will gouge you on price. I pay $12 bucks for a 56 oz. can!) Anyhow, I added a Tbl. of fresh minced ginger, 1 rounded tsp. of red pepper flakes, and 1 Tbl. of fish sauce. I also used 3 Tbl. brown sugar instead of honey. But honey is great too. I also pre-wok fried the whole chicken in Olive Oil before putting it in the crock pot. I stuffed it with 1/2 of a fresh lemon, some fresh leeks for a mild onion flavor, and fresh cilantro. I also added 1 tsp. of ground pepper to the doubled sauce. OMG! To die for delicious! I served it next to a lg. serving of mushroom and crab fried rice (I keep all of these foody things on hand), and egg rolls with Sweet & Sour sauce or Hoisen Sauce. Buy the egg rolls at the Asian Market too (36 homemade pork egg rolls frozen is $7 bucks!). Thanks for everyone's suggestions. My friends still ask me for this recipe for dinner parties or work events. It's a knockout recipe!

This is very similar to Chinese Steeped Chicken.  I've made that in a pot on the stove, so I wanted to try this in the slow cooker.  It was tender and tasty, and as one person said, even better the next day; however, the presentation was blah.  Fall-off-the-bone tender means I served a pile of chicken chunks.  That is fine for the 2nd day, but on the first day I like to present a whole chicken.  In Steeped Chicken, they keep the skin on and simmer the chicken (breast side up, with sauce barely shimmering, NOT boiling) for 15 minutes.  Then you turn off the heat, put the chicken breast side down, cover the pot and let the chicken finish cooking while it steeps in the sauce.  After an hour it will be done.  I often move the pot to the fridge and let it steep overnight, to serve later.  Before serving, I put it in a HOT 550 degree oven for about 7 minutes to crisp the skin.  It comes out with crispy skin and tender, flavorful, juicy meat.

I originally thought to give this recipe 1 star because, the first time I made it, it wasn't as tasty as everyone claimed in the reviews.  In fact, it was downright awful.  I am a fairly good cook so I made a few modifications.  First, instead of chicken I used the other white meat, tilapia, and I substituted the Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, and lemon juice with a bold, red Malbec from Australia.  I cooked it in a dutch oven on the stove because I didn't want to use a crockpot and, I added potatoes, pearl onions, turnips, and brussel sprouts for more flavor.  The tilapia essentially cooked away and the vegetables didn't cook at all thus, this recipe was a total bust.  

JUST KIDDING!  We followed this recipe to the letter and ended up with the best slow cooker chicken dinner we've ever made.  I suggest pairing with a SOUR CREAM FAN ROLL (recipe by Carrie Ormsby) and the Malbec.  :)

I cook this chicken once a week! I only cook whole chickens these days because they are so much cheaper than breasts and you get so much more! This recipe is the only one I use! It combines so many different flavors and the chicken turns out so juicy. I usually use the meat to make chicken salad, enchiladas et all. I usually stuff a whole chopped onion in the cavity and a few sprigs of rosemary or thyme. Delicious EVERY TIME!

This was my first attempt at making a whole chicken in the slow cooker.  I was rather nervous, but it was very good.  I will say though, it is difficult to skin a whole chicken.  I cooked my chicken on high for 3 hours then let it sit in the warm setting for another 30 minutes while I finished dinner.  The only complaint I had was it was slightly dried out, not to the point of being inedible, but it was dry.  This however could be due to my slow cooker as it over cooks everything.  I only put in about a tablespoon of olive oil, as it was all I had.  I also used the juice of half a lemon, I am not sure what it measured to.  I cooked the chicken with the breast down and based the back about every 30 minutes.  I reduced about a cup of the liquid from the chicken for a gravy, that I served over mashed potatoes.  The sauce has a slightly oriental flavor, although not strong, with a hint of citrus.  It was very good.  I really liked it as did my husband and daughter.  We also had with broccoli and salad.

This was amazing. I marinated the chicken in the soy sauce/honey mixture overnight as some said it lacked flavor. Marinating was perfect! I quartered some yukon golds and placed them in the crock and used them sort of as a baking "rack". The chicken came out fall of the bone tender. The potatoes reminded of sweet potatoes and were cooked perfectly. I did leave out the chicken broth and just added the sauce mixture to the crockpot with the chicken. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Whole family loved it. No need to skin the chicken, just skim the fat off the gravy. I thickened the gravy in a saucepan with cornstarch slurry. Served with coconut jasmine rice. Great!!

Wow, this was wonderful!  I followed the recipe almost exactly - just subbed lime juice for lemon because that's all I had, and I didn't use the sesame oil because I didn't have any (I can say it probably would have been even better with it).  It is important to skin the chicken as instructed--I couldn't get all my skin off, and it made a bit of a mess for clean-up.  After the chicken was done, I reduced the sauce a little to enhance the flavor and served it over steamed veggies (broccoli, carrots, sugar snap peas and water chestnuts).  I also used some of the sauce to make my rice (subbed it for half the water)--yummy!  Great recipe - thanks!

Mild flavours & tasty.  Very good :)  Omitted olive oil, and used 2T sesame seed oil--was still on the 'oily' side probably due to the dark meat.  Cooked on high (breast down) for 4 hours, then turned to 'warm' until we ate 1+ hour later.  Tender meat which fell off the bones, breasts weren't dry--may be due to having been cooked on the
'downside,' or because I didn't uncover the cooker until we were ready to dine.

I used one cup of broth, cut down on the oil as others suggested and used white cooking wine instead of vinegar.  Chicken turned out great!!  Served with rice and a side salad.

Yum! So easy, and the chicken was so moist and tender. I stuffed the bird with a couple chunks of onion and celery as well. Only problem with this was that it actually cooked a lot faster than the recipe suggested (about 3 hours on high, not four, and that was starting with a bigger bird that was partly frozen). According to my slow cooker manual, stuff cooks faster if the crock isn't at least half full, and this recipe doesn't make enough liquid to fill my cooler that much. Not really a problem with the recipe per se, but bear this in mind if your cooker is on the bigger side.

Hands down, this recipe makes the best chicken you will ever eat - especially tasty with homegrown chickens that require stewing.  As suggested, I replaced the honey with maple syrup.  I didn't bother taking off the skin (I wanted to preserve as much moisture as possible and it gives some flavor).  I added whole can of chicken broth, 1.5 times the soy sauce, and 1.5 times the garlic and a dash of ginger. - 4.5 hours later (on high setting), I had tender flavorful chicken falling off the bone - even the leftovers disappeared quickly!

We thought this was quite good.  I followed others advice to not use as much oil because the chicken has a great amount in it even after skinning.  My chicken was almost 5 pounds and I cooked for 5 1/2 hours on low and then turned over and cooked for 1/2 hour on high.  Removed from the pot and let it set while the broth cooled enough to let the excess fat rise to the top in a fat skimmer.  The broth plus some cornstarch for thickening (minus the fat) made excellent gravy for rice.  I will definitely make this again.

I tried something different with this recipe and wow was it a hit..!  I happened to come on about ten sets of chicken drumsticks and thighs and did not know quite what I was going to do with them.  I had been saving this recipe and thought why not try this in the slow cooker with all these chicken pieces.  I prepared all the pieces just as instructed for the original whole chicken recipe, and made quite a bit of extra sauce.  I cooked the chicken pieces for about 7 to 7 1/2 hours, by which time the meat was falling off the bone.  Then I shredded all that chicken meat and saved it for chicken tacos, or fajitas or to put over rice.  I have several bags in my freezer to use as needed.  The flavor is absolutely  magnificent.  My husband and I just love it.  It was a bit difficult to pick the chicken out of all those bones, but it was so tender that it did not really take very long. I will definitely use this recipe on a whole chicken as written originally, and will also use this sauce on other items as well.  It sounds as if it would work well on pork too.  Thanks so much to Kathy for sharing it.

Following the advice of others, I only threw in a splash of olive oil. I also double the rest of the liquid because I'm typically serving a bigger family and thus cook a larger chicken.  Because of this, we usually need the full eight hours on low, but if cooking a smaller bird it would probably be less as others have mentioned.

This recipe is easily amended to taste.  For ours, we stuff the cavity with a quartered onion and garlic cloves. Sometimes we want more of a citrus flavour and throw in a whole lemon or orange, sliced.  Other times we like something more spicy and kick it up with some hot peppers and ginger root. Either way, it's amazing when served with broccoli, garlic, onions, carrots, and water chestnuts.

Thanks, Kathy, for sharing this recipe.  What a treat!!!

I had a whole chicken that needed cooking on a 110 degree day and even though I had my doubts initially as to putting it in the crockpot, the idea of not having to turn on the oven really appealed to me so I took a chance. This turned out so amazingly tender, juicy and flavorful, just the two of us gobbled it down in no time at all. Served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. This is a recipe we will definitely be having again. Thanks for sharing!

This chicken was outstanding! I was excited to make it so by the time I did I think I'd read every review! I ended up doubling the mixture (except the oil) and marinating in a freezer ziplock bag for about 7 hours. I cut one onion into quarters and stuffed the cavity of the chicken with that and 4 cloves of garlic. I also sprinkled pepper on the bird itself. I cooked (breast side down) on high for one hour and on low for 3 1/2. Next time ill keep it on low the whole time because it was the tiniest bit dry. I also flipped it over one time for about 20 min. At one point but flipped it back to the breast side for fear of it drying out to much. GREAT RECIPE! Was not disappointed at all. As for the reviewers who said it had no flavor.... try marinating next time and its also important to get as much skin off as possible so the meat can absorb the flavor!

Wonderful recipe! Made a 6 lb. chicken. I seasoned the inside cavity with regualr salt and rubbed olive oil on the entire bird, used 1 can Swanson's chicken broth, used only 1/4 olive oil for the juice, used regular vinegar and no sesame oil. For the best seasoning: use McCormick's Lemon Pepper seasoning - just lightly shake on top of chicken and add 4-5 dries basil leaves, 1/2 tsp. onion powder (to juice mix), and 1 tsp. dried celery! Cooked on low for 9 hours. Perfect and great gravy too :) served with wild rice! Added a picture as well. Thanks Kathy!

I liked the flavors in this recipes.  Although, I did make some alterations:  I used 5 pounds of chicken thighs with the skins removed and trimmed of fat.  We prefer the dark meat and it stays moist in the crock pot.  My chicken was done in 3 1/2 hours on high.  I also doubled the sauce- cept that I used less olive oil as other reviewers suggested.  This way all of the chicken was covered and able to soak up the flavors.  I also added some red pepper flake for some kick.  The chicken came out moist but the flavors were not so strong.  I think next time I will use more honey and cut 
back on the amount of broth and lemon juice as it made the sauce thin and a bit too tangy.

Wow - this really turned out well!  The chicken literally fell off the bone... as in - I couldn't get it out of the pot.  But the flavor was fabulous.  I used a 4 pound chicken and doubled the liquid (everything else in the recipe), and cooked for 8-9 hrs on low.    I left out sesame oil because I didn't have any on hand.  I minced about 20 pods of garlic to equal 4 tbsp.  I made a chicken broth using Better than Bullion concentrate - and heated all the liquids together on the stove before pouring over the chicken.  SO EASY - and the result was fabulous.

We followed another reviewer's suggestion to double the liquid, but that was too much for my slow cooker.  I recommend starting with the beginning measurements.  We stuffed a chopped up onion and the garlic under the skin.

awesome chicken, the whole family loved it but i could have eaten the whole chicken myself. I followed other suggestions and reduced the oil. I also added a little ginger and a spice rub on the chicken. I even made a gravy which was very tasty. I will definetly make this again.

My husband watched me mix the ingredient "coctail" for this recipe, and thought I was nuts! When I got home about 5 hours later, he said he tried to lift the bird to flip it with tongs and it completely fell off the bone. Let me just summarize by telling you that my family will definitely be using this recipe in years to come. One little bit of advice is to make sure the breast meat is down in the crock pot so that it is as tender as possible. Enjoy!

This chicken was so good and so easy! I cooked a 6 lb. chicken for 4 hours on high, and it was perfect.  I had a little trouble getting the bird out, but I had used a crock pot liner, so I just gathered it at the top and lifted the whole works out. I cut the bottom (over the sink) and drained the juices into a bowl, put the chicken on the platter and slid it out of the bag. The wings fell off in the process, but they made a nice little snack for the cook while I finished the rest of the dinner. I also didn't skin the chicken, as I was concerned that it might be needed to prevent dryness. This recipe is a keeper - thanks, Kathy!

Everyone loved this in my house. I thought it was okay but that is because I'm not a fan of whole chicken cooked in the crockpot. But you can't beat a recipe that you mix a few things together, forget about it then eat it for supper!

I roast a chicken in the crock pot just about every Friday.  I thought I would try something new and found this.  It's really very good.  My family really loved it and it will certainly make a return visit to our Friday night menu soon!

I used chicken pieces.  I am also very lazy - I did not skin the pieces, thus left out the olive oil completely.  (Keep the sesame oil!)  I threw in 4 crushed garlic cloves, rest of the ingredients, and layered sliced onions below the pieces.  Low setting on 8 hours for chicken pieces will dry it out, especially if using white meat.  Using low heat, I threw in some carrots at 3 hours, and at 4 hours, I threw in some broccoli.  After another 30 minutes (4.5 hours total), it was ready!  Even better the next day!

Kathy, you have come up with an amazing original recipe. I would give it more stars if I could. I made a few minor changes - used 1 cup broth, used garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and I added some red pepper flakes. A 3.5 pound chicken was done in six hours on low. I took the chicken out mid-afternoon, let it cool a bit and refrigerated it. Then I let the sauce continue to cook, and added some cornstarch. About a half hour before we ate, I put the breast meat into the sauce and let it heat up, then I served it over rice with some green onion garnish. This chicken melted in our mouths. Absolutely wonderful recipe, and I'll make it again and again. Thanks!

I'm sorry but this was awful. Very oily , needed salt or something as well. We didn't enjoy dealing with all the bones either. I agree with a few of the others, followed the recipe to the tee and was very dissapointed because it was also very dry. Not worth making again.

This was exactly what I was looking for. Whole chickens are so much cheaper. And even though I live by myself, being able to cook a whole chicken without much work, yields this busy lady alot of ready-to-go meals. This chicken fell off the bones (which I kept for stock) then I shredded it and divided it into 3 one-pound freezer containers. Makes late night dinner prep a breeze!!! Enchiladas tonight, chicken salad for lunch. Soup on Sunday. You can stretch one chicken a long way!

I followed the recipe except for omitting the sesame oil (did not have on hand).  I loved the flavor and found the chicken to be very tender.  Could have been a little moister, but I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  I made gravy from the remaining liquid and it was delicious!  And the smell in the house while it cooked...wonderful!

Just had this for dinner. Only change I made was coconut oil instead of sesame Oil (didn't have any). Did leave skin on chicken after reading reviews with some dry meat issues. Used a 5 pound chicken. It cooked in 4 hours on high. More time would have dried out breast. My hubby and I really enjoyed the flavor. Hubby said "great dinner". Used drippings as gravy on meat and wild rice. I will make this again.

I followed recipe to a T. After 8 hours on Low my chicken was dry & tasteless. (It was probably done after about 5 hours, but I was out all day & could not check on it). The meat had fallen off the bones and swimming in an oily watery liquid - which was NOT very good spooned over the rice. I was very disappointed in this recipe.  After reading the many positive reviews I expected much better.

Recipe is very good.  A simple meal that is waiting for you when you come home.  I'm always careful to cut down the time the cooker runs for though, or the chicken can be overdone - especially if it sits for a while before you get home.  I think we cooked this on low for about 5 hours.

This is very good. However, I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons-1)8 hours is WAY too long!! My chicken was 3.73 lbs. and was done (on low) with 3 hours to spare...2) I doubled the sauce (except for the olive oil...I left that at 1/3 cup)-next time I will triple it because the sauce only covered 1/2 the chicken, so after a few hours the top half of the chicken was white as can be (and TOTALLY unappetizing {sp?} looking)and the breast side had soaked up alot of sauce and looked yummy- I flipped it, but like I said-I'll make enough sauce next time to cover the chicken- or will be sure to baste it throughout the cooking process. Other than that, It is tasty and tender! Will make again!

This falls off the bone when done, so if you're looking for something crisp, or with the skin on it, then don't use this recipe.  The flavors are great though.

We're not huge fans of whole chicken, so what I did was use 4 chicken breasts on 3 1/2 hours on low and they were tender and juicy!

I chose this recipe due to the easiness of it. However, there was no flavor to it at all. If you want a boiled chicken flavor then this is the recipe for you.  I will for sure NOT make it again.

I've used All Recipes for a long while now and I've learned to trust the reviews.  I made this chicken as directed but with about 1/8 cup olive oil and no sesame oil but instead replaced the difference with chicken broth. Once the chicken was at the end of the schedule I took 1 cup of the sauce from the crock pot and another cup of chicken broth for 2 cups of dry rice and orzo. Everything was AMAZING! The chicken fell off the bones and was absolutely delicious, even my picky daughters liked it! I will be making it again!

Yum!  Good flavor combination. After the 8 hours, I set the chicken in a pan and broiled it for about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, I thickened the juice with cornstarch to make a sauce for the meat and the noodles.  Big hit with the whole family.

I love this chicken! It has become a big hit in my house! It is hard for me to find a 3 pound chicken and usually end up with one that is around 4.5 pounds, therefore, cooking on high usually takes around 5 hours. I've cooked this recipe with the skin on and off the chicken and it is great both ways! Definitely tender and delicious! My boyfriend asks me to cook this for dinner every week!

Pretty good, but bottom of the chicken was "soggier" than the rest - next time I'll try flipping it.

My family LOVES this recipe so much that I make it at least once a month, if not more. I leave out the balsamic vinegar and sesame oil and sometimes I use water if I don't have chicken broth in the house. It always comes out fantastic!

This is easier than standing in line and buying a rotisserie chicken! Just as yummy, too. I love that it takes only 3-4 hours on high and I can start it in the afternoon rather than in the busy morning. My family of 5 ate this entire 4+ lb chicken tonight. Everybody liked it. As other reviewers said, it may not take as long as the recipe stated. My larger bird was falling off the bone after only about three hours on high. I cooked mine in a large rectangular crockpot. The breast was definitely tender enough, but next time I think I will cook it with the breast side down. I did not add any extra liquid to mine, and I did use less oil (2 tsp sesame, 2 tsp olive oil). I also left out the worchester sauce since I am trying to serve more "real" foods. I used organic soy sauce.

I didn't expect to love this recipe but I was pleasantly surprised!  The meat falls right off the bones and is so full flavored, it's very tasty.  I'm trying to learn to enjoy dark meat, since most non-genetically-modified chickens have smaller breast, darn it all!  and this recipe has helped me with that task.  I've got the crock pot churning away in the kitchen on this one right now.  Love it!

I changed this recipe up a little, and it was wonderful! I used boneless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken (I used two, but I think you could do three or maybe even four with this much liquid), and I cut up big chunks of potatoes, carrots, and fresh green beans and put those in as well. It came out tasting like the comfort and warmth of pot roast, but made with chicken! We LOVED it!

Loved this recipe, but did take advice of other reviewers and decreased the amount of olive oil.  Also followed recommendations of "Aedos."  As leftovers, we made lettuce wraps which consisted of chopped water chestnuts, white rice, the chicken, and hoisin sauce.  It was amazing!  You can also use spring roll skin/rice paper (cheapest at Asian stores).

This was delicious chicken.  I put the veggies in the bottom of the crockpot instead of foil.  I'll make this again.  The only thing keeping it from being a 5-star recipe is that the skin of the chicken looks pretty unappetizing, so I probably wouldn't serve this for comany, but for a family dinner it is perfect (I skinned it after cooking).

Six hours on low produced a moist and very delicious chicken that was enjoyed by all. I have a lot of sauce leftover which won't go to waste as I'll freeze it to use with stir fry's. Served this placing the chicken pieces over ramen noodles and steamed broccoli. Thank you so much Kathy!

Cooking time is way too long; meat was tender, but dry.  Flavor was ok.  Try Foster Farm's Simmered Chinese Chicken instead.

This was a good starter recipe for me. I doubled the liquid ingredients and cooked breast side down. The breast definately had the most flavor. Mine was a tad dry at 4 hours on high even for an almost 4lb bird. Next time I will put some onions and garlic in the cavity and leave some of the skin on the breast to keep it more moist. I also may use my injector to get a bit more of the flavor into the meat.

I was hesitant to make this recipe based on some of the negative reviews, but it turned out delicious. I thicken the sauce with cornstarch and it made a very good gravy. I cooked my chicken on high until the temperature was at 180F and it was perfectly down.

This is a great recipe. Cook on high for about 3 hours and low for 30 minutes and it comes out perfectly juicy and flavorful! If you like Asian flavors, this is great. The only people who don't seem to like the recipe are people from the midwest! Things like soy sauce or sesame oil aren't "fancy" or "new-fangled". If your chicken isn't really fresh, then you'll have a difficult time skinning it, otherwise it's incredibly simple. If there's too much oil, put the remaining liquid in a fat separator and let it sit for a few minutes and then make a sauce out of the dark liquid, discarding the light oily liquid.

Yum! We all loved this. Following reviews, I omitted the sesame oil and cut the olive oil to  2 T. I cooked the chicken on high for two hours and on low for four - which was a tad too long. During the last hour and a half, I added a cup of brown rice and another cup of broth and it came out incredible.

I followed some of the other reviewers comments and cut the oil in half.  The smell of this dish made everyone in the house hungry.  It had sensational flavor.  It's definitely a keeper.  I did thicken the sauce to make a gravy.  Next time I think I'll leave it as is.  I think it needs a thinner sauce.  Mine got too heavy.  Anyway this was fast easy and soooo delicious!!

Sorry but I ended up throwing out the whole thing before anybody even tasted it.  I thought it was me at first but nobody liked the way the chicken looked or smelled.  Probably would not attempt again.  Thanks anyway

I used a 7lb. chicken so I doubled everything except the soy. Took 6 hours on high. I cooked it breast side down, which I recommend. Think next time I will nake w/ breasts or other pieces instead of a whole bird.

My family loved this chicken! The kids even wanted more. I used a whole chicken but I cut the chicken piece up so that I didn't have to worry about try to get the whole chicken out and then cutting it up. I added onions and some spices- pepper, garlic powder and red pepper. And I didn't put that much oil in there. I left some of the skin in the pan so that it would flavor it. Once the chicken was done (very moist) I took it out and thickened the juices so we could pour it over the chicken and white rice. We ate teh entire chicken for dinner. I will make this again.

This turned out to be really good; however, when I made it exactly as the directions said, the sauce tasty like grease, and none of the other flavors came out until I tripled them to compete with the oil.  We will make it again, but we will not add as much oil next time.  I also like the way it tasted with white meat instead of dark meat so next time, I am just going to use chicken breasts

Wonderful flavor, the whole family loved it.  The chicken just fell off the bone and nice and moist.  I did double the sauce and served over brown rice with shitaki mushrooms and asparagus as the side.  I also served small slices of ciabatta bread to lap up the delicious sauce.  I didn't bother mixing the sauce in a bowl I just mixed in the crock pot and then added the chicken and turned the chicken several times before and during cooking.

Trid this out the other day, and LOVED IT!! Read reviews, and opted to use less olive oil (the evoo I used was a carmalized garlic infused oil), increased the sesame oil (for taste), used lime juice rather than lemon (it was all I had), and used a chicken fresh from the hutterite colony that sells produce/meat at local farmers market. Stuffed the cavity with a bunch of quartered onion also. Absolutely divine!! Meat was fall apart/off the bone at 7hrs, so turned off crockpot and left lid on for last 30mins. Paired with corn and jasmine rice, and mixed drippings with cornstarch to make a delectable gravy. Eating on second day was almost better than the first! Will make again, no question!

I tried this recipe a couple months ago after receiving my first slow cooker. My husband really enjoyed it and asks me to make it quite often. I have a hard time trying to describe the taste of it but it comes out so tender and flavorful. I serve it with white rice which absorbs the sauce nicely. I have even made this chicken without some of the ingredients like the lemon juice and chicken broth (didn't have them on hand) or using garlic powder rather than minced and it still turns out yummy!

Great flavor and a perfect meal when it is too hot to bake in the oven.  I'll make this again soon.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband. I skinned a 5# fresh, whole organic chicken, except for the wings and placed it in a cup of clear chicken broth, breast down into the crock pot. Put a whole quartered large onion and large halfed garlic clove inside the cavity. I did double the broth recipe except for the olive oil and poured this over the chicken, added some baby carrots and cooked it on high for 5 hours. The broth of this recipe is amazing and we will probably get a couple of more meals from it! I would recommend this recipe for a dinner party too.(Always nice to have time to pick up while the main course is cooking) I served with sauteed green beans and portabella mushrooms as the veggie. Also steamed jasmine rice. Yummy :) Soup Fiend

Great chicken.  I used bone-in skinned chicken thighs and followed recipe exactly except I used 1/2 cup of honey, which cut the acidity and it was perfect.  Sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and served over rice with pork egg rolls.  This is a winner!

It was definitely fall off the bone chicken! I didn't have the vinegar or sesame oil, so I left them out completely, I added more garlic, and didn't use as much soy sauce. I left the skin on, but patted it dry. It came out pretty good, a little dry, because I think it may have cooked too long, but I used the juices to flavor the white rice and it was fantastic. :) Nice recipe, but I think I'll be adding some spices next time.

Talk about FAll off the bone, this was amazing.  We do not make a lot of whole chickens here so I will probably use chicken breasts next time, but this was great.

This was awesome and my whole family loved it.  I made it exactly as written.  I did put the chicken breast side down in the crock pot because I wanted the marinate to soak into the meat.  I also made a gravy out of the juice with a little bit of cornstarch and served over rice.  LOVED IT and will make again.

Mine came out tasteless and oily. The chicken fell to pieces and was judged uneatable by my whole household. No one liked it but it did make great chicken burritos two days later.

I served this for friends and everyone really enjoyed it!  The flavor was great and very different from other slow cooker chicken recipes I've tried.  It created a wonderfully moist chicken.  It was very easy!  I used an oven stuffer roaster chicken which was about 8lbs, so I tripled the recipe.  I also put it in the slow cooker breast side down to ensure moist meat.

This was ok, not great. Followed the recipe exactly (except for the amount of oil), it was just average. I think I'll use the slow cooker to make shredded chicken for other dishes.

This was delicious, although my husband thought it was too sweet (my kids and I liked it as-is). I followed the reviewers, and doubled all the liquids. I reduced the olive oil to a couple of tablespoons, and that was plenty. I also lined the bottom of the crockpot with carrots, celery and onions. The tip to cook it breast-side down was a good one, and the meat was moist and tender. Since it was falling off the bone, I pulled it out, removed the meat, then stuck it back into the pot. I added some stock mixed with cornstarch to thicken it, and let it simmer on high in the crockpot for a little while longer. We had ours with mashed broccoli-potatoes, and it was tasty.

Really tasty!! For 4-5 lbs of chicken (any type--I prefer skinless thigh with bone), I recommend the following:  1. SAUCE. Double the ingredients for the sauce. Do NOT use any olive oil! Use reduced-sodium chicken broth and low-sodium soy sauce. To the doubled recipe, add 1 T. ginger paste, 1 T. crushed red pepper, and 1 T. fish sauce. I also replaced the honey with 3 T. brown sugar (doubled recipe).  2. TO COOK. In a large skillet over medium heat, quickly brown the chicken in a little olive oil on both sides. Transfer to crockpot and add the sauce. Cover and cook on high for 1 hour. Reduce heat to low and cook 4-5 hours longer or until the meat juices run clear--usually closer to 4 hours. Yummy Yum Yums!!

I would give it a lower score if I could.  I skinned the chicken, but it was still oily.  No one like the combination of flavor at all.

This was just great.  I used a large (6.5 lb) roaster chicken.  I didn't skin it and cooked it breast side down.  It was so moist and tender.  Used some left over chicken last night for another dish and it was still great.  I didn't change a thing except cooked for one hour on high and then turned to low, it only took about 5 hours to cook.

This was mediocre at best. The chicken was overcooked and the taste was just not pleasing to us. We did end up making soup from the leftover broth and chicken so it wasn't wasted.

This is a tasty dish but I've prepared slow cooker chicken many times and this one is just average compared to other similar meals.   The soy sauce and sesame oil is really unnecessary and skinning the chicken, a whole chicken mind you is just a ridiculous idea.  I will stick to my other recipes in the future.

Like many of the other reviewers, I thought this recipe was good. I personally would cut back on the soy sauce. I doubled the sauce, like many other reviewers, but I would definitely cut back on the soy sauce.

I used two skinless leg quarters instead of a whole chicken and completely omitted the oil. This turned out so tender and yummy. I poured the juice over rice and that was delicious too. I will definitely put this into the regular rotation. Very easy and quick prep. Some veggies thrown in would work well too.

The chicken had delicious flavor! This recipe turned out great. I gave four stars because I had to alter it quite a bit. I have a very new crock pot, so the cooking time took 4.5 hours on LOW for a 4.5 pound bird. As some other reviewers suggested, I tripled the sauce, didn't add any olive oil, and used more than half a bulb of an elephant garlic. I used Bragg's liquid amino instead of soy sauce (as I often do) and used half real maple syrup because I was low on honey. I also put a sliced onion, carrots and parsnips at the bottom. I made sure to turn the breast a couple of times just to make sure all sides were covered. The meat fell of of the bones just fine with 4.5 hours on LOW! The carrots needed more time than the chicken! I used the sauce to make gravy, and had compliments from my friends as well as their children who are 4 and 6. I'm still a novice with my slow cooker (just so used to the stove) and I will make this one again. Thanks!

This Chicken is fantastic!  And so very easy to make.  I followed a couple suggestions such as cutting the olive oil down to just about a tablespoon (I could probably just leave it out entirly) and I omitted the Seasame Oil because I didn't have any on hand.  Also I used the liquid from the crock pot after the chicken was completely cooked to make rice and it was amazing!  My husband loved it and so did my picky 3 year old!

My family LOVED this chicken.  I especially loved that there was no guess work.  I like to buy whole chicken because it's so much cheaper but my biggest fear with preparing it is giving everyone food poisoning because there is such a fine line between perfectly baked and totally dried out.  With the slow cooker I didn't have to worry about it drying out.  I put it on low at 11 and by 4:30 it was falling off the bone.  I marinated it overnight and the soy flavor was INTENSE throughout the bird.  I actually prepared the chicken several days ago but I shredded the leftovers, put them in baggies of meal size portions, and stuck them in the freezer.   I used a baggie of shredded chicken for dinner tonight in a quick skillet meal.  The flavor was so enhanced by the chicken that it tasted like it took me hours when I really only spent 15 minutes tossing things together.  I'm glad I tried this one!!

I thought this was fabulous, and the sauce was great over rice. My slow cooker has a temperature probe so I couldn't overcook it. A 5 lb chicken cooked for 5 1/2 hours on low. This was the most flavorful and best-cooked chicken I've made.

Skinning a whole chicken is a pain.  I cut the wings off at the joint and used them to make the broth, along with the skin and the neck.  Cooked a 5# chicken on LO for 10 hours - way too long and it fell off the bone trying to remove from the pot.  Used toasted sesame oil and olive oil.  I agree with other reviewers - could probably reduce the olive oil by atleast half.  Next time I will try not to overcook.  Good flavor though, better than most crockpot whole chicken recipes I've tried.

I have made this chicken several times now.  The first time I made it I was so put off by skinning the chicken that I decided I would probably not make it again.  Once I had a taste I completely changed my mind.  Now I will use boneless skinless chicken thighs and serve it over rice.  Reminds me a lot of the Hawaiian dish Shoyu chicken.

Absolutely delicious blend of flavors.  Chicken so tender it fell off the bones.  Removing skin not a big problem, and allowed flavor to really infuse meat, as well as cut way back on fat.  Thanks for a great new way to slow-cook chicken!

Very tasty and very easy to make. Instead of using a slow cooker I used a dutch oven. I baked the 5lb chicken at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 45 mins and it was delicious! The chicken was so tender it fell right off the bone. I will definitely keep this recipe in my box. Thanks!!!

This was very tasty!  As we don't much like whole chickens, I made this with boneless mini breast fillets, which I trimmed and cut in half.  Since I was making less chicken, I added chunks of carrots to the crockpot along with the chicken.  I made the sauce exactly as stated in the recipe.  I cooked for about five hours on low.  With about a half hour left of cooking time, I tossed in some chopped red bell pepper and a can of drained water chestnuts.  When it was finished cooking, I added a handful of chopped green onion and then  served over rice.  The chicken and carrots came out moist and tender!

This made for a yummy chicken dinner last night--wasn't sure how it would turn out while it cooked.  My 9 yo said it "smelled delicious".  In the end, all 3 of my kids LOVED it and asked that I make it again.  Even my husband (who cringes whenever I dig out my crock pot!) liked it.  The worst part was skinning the chicken--I ended up Lysoling half my kitchen!  But after that, it was easy.  I doubled the ingredients (except for the oil, which I left as stated) because I had a 7 lb chicken and cooked on High for 6 hours.  It fell apart as I was getting it out, so we used a slotted spoon to get out the big pieces...I liked it with some of the sauce over it because it was a little dry, but tasty!  Will be making this again.

The 4 is because prep time for me was around 30 min ,not 15 . To skin the chick took more time.  Otherwise easy put together ! Also allow extra time to remove meat from bones prior to serving to small children . !  ages 8 and 6 liked it as a sandwitch . Hubby & I thought meat was very soft . This does have an unfamilar , yet familar taste. I cann't put me finger on it !4 lb chick , on high 1 hr, then low 3 more hrs. Added larger amount of spices. Did not have chic broth so , I just used 1 cup of water.  this is a keeper !

Although my children loved the chicken, I found it overcooked.  The flavour was quite good, but if I did make it again, I would thicken the sauce.  I would also use boneless chicken breasts only because it was not pleasant when the chicken fell into a million pieces.  This recipe has potential, but you may have to play with it a bit.

Fantastic recipe and super easy to make.  Like other users - I omitted sesame oil.  I probably used more honey then called for!  I had my husband baste the chicken while cooking!  Very good flavor - the house still smells yummy!  Thanks!

I loved this chicken recipe.  It was delicious and easy.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I didn't have any honey so I threw in some brown sugar.  I also didn't have sesame oil.  It came out great anyway.  I'll definitely make this again.

I was so looking forward to this because I thought it looked like an interesting and good combination of ingredients for the sauce.  I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed in it.  The sauce had a lot of flavor, I just didn't LIKE the flavor.  The chicken was very tender and not at all dry.  I just didn't care for the taste.

Very good. I also added onions. Served over Basmati rice. The sauce had to be thickened on the stove and even still I didnt like it. I had to use soy sauce on my rice. I will make again though.

My chicken was done in WAY less than 8 hours on low--it was ready in about four and it was a 5lb chicken! I was really dry.  I'm sure it was my crockpot.  The flavor was awesome--I used some of the juices and made rice with it--that was beyond awesome!  Once I get a new crockpot, I'll make this recipe again.

High fives to Kathy for this one.  It's similar to Kona Chicken, which can also be found on the allrecipes website.  As usual, my new crockpot completed the cooking far faster than the recipe called for (done on LOW in 2 1/2 hours!).  The flavor of the sauce was excellent--just splendid.  I served the dish with instant brown rice and "Sweet and Crunchy Salad" (perfect compliment to the sweet chicken and sauce) and "Reduced Fat Potato Soup," both from this website.  Come to think of it, I guess I had an allrecipes dinner!  I  wouldn't change a thing on this one.  The recipe is excellent just as it is.

I made this recipe tonight, and it was really good.  My 17 yr old is very picky and he even liked it! I will make it again.
Taking the advice of many others, I omitted the sesame oil.  I used half of the olive oil and added chunks of onion, pepper, garlic powder and red pepper.  My slow cooker is not the average size, so it only took 2-1/2 hrs to cook.  Thanks Kathy!

This chicken is absolutely delicious (as the title implies). It was not at all greasy as some other reviewers had said -- maybe they did not remove the skin? I will definitely make this again!

I used this recipe as a jumping off point.  I put an onion cut in chunky bits at the bottom of the pan, rubbed the chicken with chinese five spice powder before adding it to the pan - and used white wine instead of broth.  I also reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons(because of what other reviewers have said) THEN I added four star anises and four cloves to the liquid.  The chicken was cooked in 3 and a half hours and was infused with a delicate chinese flavour.  I strained and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  It was a memorable but cheap meal - definitely a keeper.

This was great. I cut boneless chicken breasts into bites and cooked it for 4 hours and the bites were so so tender! The sauce was great over jasmine rice. I might use a little less oil next time.

I normally wouldn't bother writing a review, but the fact that this recipe has such high ratings overall, combined with the fact that I just simply could not salvage it, makes me feel the need to review it.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of the lemon juice, because when I was picking up the ingredients I forgot to get that.  When I came in that evening, the apartment smelled good, although the soy sauce scent was somewhat overwhelming.  I thought, with as strongly as it smelled, surely the dish would be flavorful.  However, it was completely bland and dry.  I tried fixing it by adding in flavors similar to the original recipe, but everything I tried just made it taste worse.  Not to mention mixing in the seasonings made the chicken fall into a million pieces, and because of the soy sauce, every part, meat and bone alike, were the exact same color and nearly impossible to tell apart without biting into chicken vertebrae.  Not remotely appetizing.  Needless to say, I won't be making it again, and I hope maybe I can save someone else the trouble.

Excellent flavor but mine turned out a bit dry too after 3.5 hours on low in the slow cooker.  Does it get more moist if you leave it all day as the recipe suggests?

This was exactly the type of recipe I was looking for to make a whole chicken in the slow cooker! It was sooooo delicious! My husband couldn't stop praising it and has generously given me permission to make it every week!

This chicken was delicious! My whole family loved it! I omitted the olive oil and sesame oil as others suggested and I am glad I did because the sauce is perfect. I did double all the ingredients because my chicken was double the size (about 6 lbs). Will definitely make again!

I wasn't wild about the flavor of the sauce, but a good technique.  I will play around with seasonings and be sure to put 3 balls of aluminum foil in the bottom of the crock pot so the chicken on the bottom doesn't get too soggy.

Followed this recipe exactly.  Tasted it an hour before done and thought it was a little bland.  I shredded it, cooked it in the juice a bit longer.  I served it as a sandwich with au juice like a French dip.  It was delicious.

I thought this recipe tasted exactly like VH® Garlic Rib Cooking Sauce. I omitted the oil and used maple syrup instead of honey. I also coarsly chopped a sweet onion and placed the chicken on top. The sauce is delicious but I don't think it should be done with a whole chicken. I think it would be best with skinless boneless chicken thighs. The meat would really absord the sauce in that case.

I actually had this in my slow cooker but somehow it came unplugged...hmmm....clumsy husband? In any case when I walked in the door after work I knew something was wrong when I smelled nothing delicious in the air. That's when I discovered the unplugged slow cooker. In a frenzy and a panic at 5:15 in the evening (I had set the slow cooker keep going until 6) I threw everything into my pressure cooker. And man oh man alive! Did it turn out GREAT! AND it was still ready at 6 !!!! I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone, slow cooker OR pressure cooker! DELISH!

This literally fell off the bones!  It was delicious!  I did a 5lb chicken and, on low heat, it was done after 6 hours (may be my slow cooker?).  I used half the olive oil it called for and realized I was out of worcestershire sauce so I added a little extra chicken broth to make up for those  two things.  I will make this one again!

The sauce was delish.  I have a large slow cooker so I split the chicken down the backbone and flattened it so that all parts would touch the liquid.  The chicken was fall apart tender.  Let it cool slightly in the liquid before serving and the meat absorbs it and becomes very moist.  Next time I would reduce the cooking time doing this technique.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it smelled great while cooking. The end result, though, wasn't very impressive. The breast was dry (cooked breast down) and the flavor was just okay. Would def not make it again.

I made this recipe and it is so easy to prepare. The chicken was tasted great.  I made a few changes that some of the other reviewers suggested.  I used 1 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 cup chicken broth, and 1/4 cup olive oil.  I reserved 1 cup of the mixture and put the rest into the slow cooker.  Added the chicken and turned to coat and placed the breast side down in the slow cooker.  I poured the remaining mixture over the chicken.  I will make this recipe again soon.  I think this mixture could be used as a marinate for chicken breast.  Put the mixture into a zip-lock bag and add the chicken breast.  Marinate over night.  Then grill or bake the chicken breast.

I was really excited about this recipe when I read all the comments.  I followed it to the tee and then stuffed the cavity with a chopped yellow onion. It smelled delicious as it was cooking. When the timer on my crock pot when off after 8 hours on low, it was super, super dried out. I was so bummed. :-( my husband ended up eating it with BBQ sauce just so he could swallow it... So sad. I'll make it again but place it breast down and I'll have to watch it more closely. (kinda defeating the purpose of having dinner cook in the crockpot all day)

I did not care for this recipe. It created too much liquid and basically boiled the chicken, boiling away any flavor. The resulting juice was bland and the chicken fell apart and I had to fish out all the bones. I could have added salt and pretended it was a soup, but it tasted icky.

This is a tasty, succulent recipe.  I noticed I had run out of Worcestershire Sauce (very angry at myself lol) but it was still great - substituted garlic powder because I had no more fresh garlic either.  I also sprinkled some cardamom, coriander, and ginger on the chicken.  We devoured that chicken.

I enjoyed this recipe. My husband thought the meat needed salting, but I disagreed so I still gave it 5 star. We served it over some yakisoba noodles that we threw in the slow cooker about 5-10 minutes before and it was a great compliment. thanks!

I used all the ingredients save for the chicken broth.  I find that there usually is more than enough moisture.  I got confused between this and another recipe and placed the chicken upon 4 aluminum foil balls. The chicken was fall of the bone but still had a firm texture.  The breast was a bit dry but I cooked it on low for 6 hours and then kept warm for 4. The leftover juices make a terrific gravy once thickened.  Definitely a make again.

Yummy, taste just like my friend's Chicken Adobo!  I skipped the sesame oil & worcestershire sauce because I did not have any.  I added about 2 tsp crushed bay leaves, tablespoon whole peppercorns, a green bell pepper & half yellow onion cut in chunks.  The chicken fell off the bone!  Served with Jasmine rice.  Will be making again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy, very tasty. I made it pretty much as this recipe indicates and found (as did others) that 1/3 cup of olive oil is too much. In fact, the recipe calls for entirely too much liquid. I have a large sized slow cooker and half way through cooking, the bird was nearly submerged in liquid and was basically being boiled. I drained off all of the liquid and allowed the cooking to continue. After 3 hours on high, it was done, essentially falling off the bone (too much so) and I had started with a frozen whole chicken thinking that would help. That may be why I had to drain off the liquid. Nonetheless, it was delicious. And by the way, I made a great tasting gravy from all the liquid I drained off!

Sooooo moist and delicious, literally meat fell off the bone.  Word to the wise...take all the skin off.  I was lazy and only removed about 3/4 of it which made it difficult after it was finished cooking.

This was too sweet for me.  I had to add more lemon juice at the end to balance out the honey.  I also added pepper, ginger and lemon grass at the end to give more flavour.  I cooked on high for 1 hour then switched to low for 3 and it could maybe have cooked a little less.  I left out the olive oil altogether after reading other reviews and there was still plenty of fat in there.

I was glad to find a recipe for a whole chicken in the crock pot. I thought it was good, but the cooking time was too long so some of the meat was a little dry. But, I made the sauce into gravy which was good, And I put the pulled off meat in some sauce to moisten it while waiting for hubby to arrive home. I would make it again, but cook it shorter time. I used a 5 pound chicken and it cooked the whole time I was at work fro 8 hours on low.

Really excellent and easy recipe. I had never made a whole chicken in the crockpot before and was surprised at how tasty it was. We'll do this one again for sure.

I really liked the sauce before I poured it over the chicken, but it seemed to lose some of its freshness and verve in the cooking.  The chicken was incredibly tender, though, and I used all of the cooking juices as the liquid in a pot of brown rice.  I caramelized a pan of onions, and served the rice over the chicken with the onions on top.  The combination was pretty incredible, and I think I'll repeat it, but experiment a little with the marinade (perhaps more citrus?) to see if I can retain the amazing flavor before it was cooked.

This recipe is delicious.  I wasn't too strict about my measurements, and added a little more chicken broth because my chicken was just over 5 lbs.  Surprisingly, it only took 3 hours on low, and 1 hr on high to cook, which makes me think my slow cooker is a little too powerful.  After the meat was cooked, I put it in the oven broiler for a few minutes to get the skin crispy, which I left on as per some of the reviews.  The skin turned out crispy, and the meat was still beautifully juicy.  I made gravy with the leftover juices.  My husband loved it.

Yum yum yum... excellent, easy way to cook a whole chicken for a slightly ADD couple on a busy Saturday. We found the flavor to be awesome the first day, but WAY to strong the second day on its own - so we made sandwiches, which were also awesome. In the future, however, we'll go lighter on the Worchestire & Soy sauces so that the leftovers are more user-friendly.

Easy! Put it in frozen and took the innerds out after about 2 hours in the crockpot.  The chicken was in the crockpot for about 4 1/2 hrs on high. Used the left-overs for teriyaki chicken & rice the next night.

I took the advice of a previous poster and halved the oil. I thought it was still a bit much so next time I would reduce the sesame oil also. That's not why I gave it 3 stars though.  My main concern was the garlic. There was way too much garlic. If anyone is trying this recipe and has issues with indigestion / heartburn, be aware. Next time I would use 2/3 tbsp instead of 2 tbsp. I was unable to taste any of the other ingredients.  On the positive side, I was drawn to this recipe because it is simple and can be done with stuff I already have in the kitchen. The meat was juicy and had soft texture.  I added veggies with about 2 hours remaining. That seemed about right to cook them w/o getting too soft (8 hour cook time on the meat). They did seem to hold more oil than the meat. Maybe someone has an idea to balance that better?  I hope this is helpful. Good luck on your chefing endeavors.

The flavor on this was excellent!  It made a lot of sauce, which was nice for dipping bread in later but we still threw a lot of it away.  Maybe next time I'd add some flour to the sauce to thicken it and serve it over rice or over the chicken.

I don't really see what's not to like about this recipe. It's simple and full of flavor. I eyeballed it, which worked out fine and I had to use red wine vinegar, b/c i was out of balsamic and garlic powder for the same reason. Also, I used some white cooking wine instead of stock. Only complaint is that I was cooking a 4+ lb bird and this thing was fully done to perfection after 4.5 hours. I turned it off, but in the hours until dinner time it dried out a bit. I also used less olive oil, as suggested to keep it light.. I whisked everything right in the crockpot and dipped the bird around a few times. It might seem like I changed up the recipe a bit, but i really didn't. It wasn't beautiful, but it was easy and  tasty. Great standard marinade and the juice made a great gravy that we put on all the side dishes!

Very tasty- I never remove the skin usually but really thought it made the taste.  Didn't have balsamic so used red wine vinegar, and didn't have sesame oil so just left it out.  Added a little extra garlic because I love it- was very good!

I almost didn't want to review this one but I believe that even the bad reviews can benefit someone out there. I followed the recipe except for the garlic. I didn't have any. Something about the flavor just didn't appeal to us. My hubby and I ended up drowning our chicken in some BBQ sauce. Sorry for the 3 stars, Kathy. This just didn't work for us, though my dog loved it--I found an empty plate of chicken I had forgot about out on the counter in the kitchen floor the next morning! I can only hope he survives the chicken bones....

I don't really like to do whole chicken in the slow cooker because of the bones factor, so I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts. I marinated them in the refrigerator in the sauce overnight and placed them on potatoes cut in half, poured the sauce over them and cooked in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low. There was not much aroma when I came home from work, but the flavor turned out to be wonderful. The potatoes were delicious too. My husband and I both declared this recipe a keeper!

Excellent!  This is nearly identical to a recipe my mother-in-law created for chicken breasts.  For just breasts, put them in a casserole, coat them with soysauce, drizzle generously with honey and sprinkle with your preferred amount of chopped garlic. Bake until done.  Simple and brilliant!

I stuffed the chicken with two onions and some fresh basil from the garden.  It was so tender and the "gravy" was awesome on the rice.  The leftover meat is going to work with hubby for lunch sandwiches.  Easy and yummy!

Delicious and thrifty (except the sesame oil, ouch that was expensive!)  We will make again, definitely.  I used an almost 5lb chicken and cooked breast side down, as the chicken was not completely covered by liquid.  For the future, it really needs to be.  It was so tender I had trouble getting it out of the crockpot - it just fell all apart.  Great reheated the next day too.  Not quite 5 stars - it needs a little extra "oomph" but I haven't figured out quite what it needs.

This was big hit.  The chicken fell apart. I was really moist.  I thickened the broth to make a sauce.  My 3 boys and hubby loved it.

I don't get all of the high marks for this.  I followed the recipe, even cut back on the oils as suggested, and it came out a greasy mess.  Also, it was dry and overcooked, but it was falling off the bone.  I left it in there for 7 1/2 hours on low.  Oh, I did add some quartered oranges in the cavity for an extra layer of flavor, and even that was lost in the blah.  I was grossed out.

This recipe was great!! I was tired of the boring whole chicken recipes and wanted something different. Love the zing!  I did as others had mentioned, I changed the oil to 2 Tbsp instead of 1/3 cup. Since there was still a bit of fat on my chicken, I thought it was a good idea. I didn't have any lemon, so next time I'll use it with it to see how different it tastes!  Seeing my health-conscience hubby actually use the sauce as gravy gladdened my soul!  Great recipe!

We were not impressed with this recipe.  The chicken got real tender...it completely fell of the carcass but it was really dry.  I cooked it for the 8 hours on low like the recipe said but I guess that was too long.  I won't be making this again.

Very easy to prepare - I had all the ingredients right in my pantry. I used boneless chicken breasts and tossed in a few yellow onions the last half hour. Tasted good over rice!

Smelled fantastic when I got home from work and fell off the bone.  Was good but I was expecting more flavor from the stron smell.  I will try this again but will add brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit and more garlic I think!

Followed the recipe exactly.  It smelled great all day long, but when we sat down to eat, we were very disappointed. It had little flavor and the appearance was less than appetizing.   Sorry.

This was very  good, left out oil, no need for it.  I seasoned chicken before hand w/salt, pepper, chicken seasoning and follow the recipe as written, served w/mashed potatoes, corn on the cob.  DH went out on the town w/this--no left  overs!!  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!!!

Tried this recipe, althought I did change it to a can of chicken broth. The chicken sauce was great over the Jasmine rice. My child who hates everything LOVED it.

I was super excited to make this recipe after reading all the wonderful reviews. It smelled pretty good, but was VERY dry and fairly tasteless. I cooked it for 10 hours on the "keep warm" setting of my crock pot. I realize that this is longer than the recipe states, but I lowered the temperature and my chicken weighed 8 lbs while the recipe called for a 3 pounder. I would not make this recipe again. I gave it 2 stars because it was still edible even if it wasn't very good. We made the leftovers into chicken and buiscuits. Adding gravy helped this chicken a lot.

I used a 5lb. chicken and doubled the sauce.  I added one whole onion--chopped, but other than that I cooked it as is--on low all day.  Served it on a bed of long rain and wild rice with the drippings.  I think I will cut back on the oil just a bit next time, but my husband, licking his fingers, said it was just right. The chicken just fell off the bone.  All it lacked was a sprinkle of salt and pepper.  All in all a fantastic, quick, inexpensive, and easy meal that everyone enjoyed.  Thanks for sharing.

Super delicious! This is a very good recipe. 1) Easy to make. Strip chicken, plop in crock pot, pour ingredients-TAHDAH! 2) My kids loved it and gobbled it up with jasmine rice cooked in a little chicken broth and butter with broccoli 3) Easy clean up. Did I mention this makes a wonderful aromatic, sweet, succulent juicy chicken that falls off the bone ? Great!

Made this yesterday and thought it was very good, had a nice flavor.  I did add some red pepper flakes to the sauce, and sprinkled a little S and P over the chicken before putting it in.  My bird was 6lbs, so I doubled the recipe, but should not have doubled the olive oil, cause I was skimming the oil off the top before it was all done.  I also added onion slices on the bottom of the crock pot to cushion the bird a bit, and they ended up really tasty.  I made it in a round slow cooker, and don't know if this helped it stay moist from being almost submerged in the juice the whole time.  Flipped it over about halfway through, and it was definitely done quicker than the suggested cooking time.  Thanks!

8 hours on low is way to long, the crockpot started to create to much water which I'm sure made a lot of the flavor go away. It would have been done at 5 hours and I probably would have liked it.

My family loved this chicken.  It was very easy to make from ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have any lemon juice or sesame oil, but the flavor was great just the same.  I didn't get it going until noon, so I cooked it on high 2 hours then turned it down to low until we got back from Nordic Ski Club shortly before six.  The meat fell off the bone and was flavorul through and through.  I served it with rice pilaf, petite broccoli florettes and corn bread.  I plan to use the left-over chicken, broccoli and strained sauce for fried rice in a day or two.

The flavor combinations are very good in this recipe. Skinning a whole chicken was very interesting! Since the meat does fall off the bone, I think I will try this recipe next with a cut up chicken - I think the pieces would be easier to skin. I ended up taking all the meat off the bones and serving it over rice. I thickened the sauce a little at the end with some  corn starch. I also read the previous reviews, and decided to try the recipe without the oils, and that was fine. I did cook it breast down in the slow cooker, and all the meat was moist. I have enjoyed the leftovers on tortillas as well. Thanks for the recipe.

We did not like this recipe at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and to us it was very bland.  I even seasoned the chicken directly prior to pouring in the sauce and still no taste.  The chicken was very soft and moist, but didn't really taste like anything.  I won't try this recipe again.

This was pretty good.  My 7 year old gave it all fingers and toes up(a lot better than thumbs up!!)  I did not use any of the sesame oil and it came out ok!!  I also added a couple shakes of cayenne pepper.  Did make a gravy from the remaining juice.  Important note:  Cooked for 3 1/2 hours on high, 30 minutes on low.  Could have probably shaved off 30 minutes on high, it was just a tad bit dry....but still tasty!

I took some of the advice of the other reviews, and cut the olive oil in half. I also added some salt and pepper, as well as oregano to the recipe. I cooked it breast down, and it turned out perfectly. I then made a gravy out of the remaining juices in the pan, and it was delivious. I highly recommend this recipe.

While this was tasty & differant, my chicken did end up dry when cooked on low for 8 hours, so maybe check the internal temperature of the chicken after 6 hours next time.  The only hard thing to prepare this recipe was definately skinning that whole chicken! What a hassle. Otherwise, it's a tasty & pleasantly differant slightly asian flavored chicken that is pretty easy overall to prepare. My husband & brother-in-law both liked it quite well, as did I.  May just use liquid combo to overnight marinate chicken breasts to BBQ next time I pull this recipe out.

This is not bad... but not worth skinning a chicken.  There may be an easy way of doing it... and I don't know how. I cooked mine 4lb chicken 2 hrs on high and 2 on low and it could have went longer.  The sauce was delicious thougha and made a wonderful gray for over rice or noodles.

The chicken fell of the bone, which usually is a good thing, but we could hardly put pieces on our plate without it breaking the pieces.  I didn't care for the flavor either.

I recently made this, I followed the directions with the exception of the sesame oil ( did not feel like shopping around for considered sesame seeds but, didn’t) My 15 yr old son, his friend and husband loved this, my very picky mother -in-law also thought it was “good” (she is an exceptional cook so I did good!!)  The only thing I added was some corn start to make juice a bit thicker. I sent this to 4 ladies that I work with an all are going to try it..

Wow!  My husband and I both loved this recipe!  I used real maple syrup instead of honey and it turned out great.  Great for the teriyaki fan, and the sauce left over is great over plain rice!

I didn't have a whole chicken lieing around so I used breasts and (tried to) take the skin off ( that was a bear, no wonder the charge more for skinless), any way the flavor was GREAT, however some of my breasts were above the liquid, so were sort of bland.

I love this recipe.  The chicken is so tender.  One of the other ladies at work and I discussed it and decided it would be great with boneless pork as well or boneless chix thighs and breasts cooked for less time. Because it is so tender everything falls apart and there are a lot of bones.  Per prior reviews definitely cut back on the olive oil and remember to take the skin off. Definitely a crock pot keeper.

The flavor was good and the chicken was tender. Skinning the chicken was a beast! And the meat was dark brown, looked like bbq pork. Just okay.

This was a fantastic recipe! I suggest cookingthe chicken with the breast down. That way the best meat will caramalize. I used a cheap fryer chicken with this recipe and it still tasted great. I will make again and again.

This was good. I thought it tasted like teriyaki chicken. I shredded the chicken beforehand and thickened the sauce and served with stir fried vegetables and rice.

Everyone in my family ate it (including the kids) without any complaints but it was just ok.  Used only 1/2 the oil, anymore would be too much and added a few grinds of black pepper.

This turned out beautifully! I used 6 bone-in skinless chicken breasts and the meat simply fell off the bones. We made about 4 meals for our family of five out of the chicken. A wonderful recipe to keep around to cook the chicken to use as a base for other recipe. We had chicken breast with rice the first night and still had 4 breasts left. One breast went into a great chicken salad. I removed the bones and shredded the chicken breasts, keeping the sauce from the crock pot, added one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken soup. This made a great chicken sloppy joe!! A real winner with the kids! :)

Excellent.  Easy to prepare.  I left the skin on and reduced the amount of oil - sorta evened out with the chicken fat.  I did add black pepper to the recipe.  All in all, a great "oriental" chicken meal.  One reviewer said her's was sorta dry - but she also indicated she uncovered the cooker to baste hourly.  Just leave the bird alone covered for 8 hours - uncovering only allows the steam out.  Slow cookers tend to "self baste."  Definitely will make often.

Meh. This was ok but there wasn't really a huge flavour kick, and the "sauce" was more like soup. I made stir fry veggies on the side and thickened the sauce over then. But It needed def more sugar imo - and maybe some spice?

The chicken was so so tender, the flavor wasn't so great, yes I agree too much oil, chicken lacked flavor must season the entire chicken, I even rotated the chicken half way to hopefully get a flavorful chicken, didn't work I even added carrots & mushrooms to the recipe which was good

We cooked the chicken for only 7 hours and it was so overcooked it was hard to eat. The spices were okay, DH loved it but I wasn't a big fan. I think it was missing something but can't put my finger on what. If we make it again we won't let it cook more than 6 hours.

Amazing!  I had a 5lb chicken, I didn't take the skin off, I did only 1Tbs of oil and 2 cups of chicken broth, everything else I doubled.  The gravy from the broth was wonderful on boiled potatoes and carrots and the chicken itself was perfect.  I will be making this often. :)

This is a keeper. I did change a few things.I took the others advice and even though I doubled the ingredients because I had a 6lb chicken I only added 1/4cup of olive oil and a tsp of sesame oil. I cooked this for 5 hours on high and this was a little to much the chicken came out a little dry but I liked the flavor of the marinade so I reduced it on the stove to about half then added just enough cornstarch to where it wasn't runny and spread that over the chicken. This really brought out the flavors it was the easiest way I have ever cooked a whole chicken it just fell off the bone. Thanks

It's been way too hot to use the oven lately, so I've been making different slow cooker recipe for the past few weeks. This recipe turned out quite well!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I would definitely marinate the chicken overnight, because the leftover chicken tasted more flavourful the next day.   The problem is with slow cooker chicken recipes, is that they don't get crispy and caramalized like they do when when roasted in the oven.  The meat is definitely moist and tender though.   I would definitely try this again in the oven, when it isn't so hot out.

Delicious, the best chicken ever! Great, easy, and very tasty recipe! I made only slight modifications; I added 1 tsp chicken seasonings and fresh rosemary. Red wine vinegar instead of balsamic and no sezame oil. I cooked it 8h on low. The whole house smells great and meat falls off the bones!

We just thought this recipe was so-so. Tender chicken, yes, but not all that flavorful. Needed pepper, as others have said, or maybe fresh ginger. I love Asian flavors, so I thought I would like this recipe more. Probably won't make this again.

this was delicious!  my only changes were that i did not add any olive oil or the chicken broth and also added carrots and potatoes to the bottom of the crockpot.  other than those changes i followed the recipe exact.  i cooked the chicken (4.5 lbs) for 5 hours on low.  my family enjoyed this!

Cutting, trimming the skin off the chicken was a major pain.....then significant prep effort, and finally chicken felll apart leaving bones in the serverings.....not a happy cooling experience.

I followed the recipe as written but did sprinkle pepper and fresh parsley on the chicken. It's one of the best chicken recipes I have tried.  It just fell off the bone and was so yummy, I could have eaten it just standing over the slow cooker! I agree with another viewer that it was a bit too oily so I will reduce the olive oil by half next time.  But it's definately worth 5 stars as it was so easy to make and so very delicious!

I was so excited about this recipe and followed it to the tee. The recipe said to cook the chicken at low for 8 hours. I set my timer and got home an hour early, checked the chicken and WOW it was super overdone! Almost unsalvageable! Such a bummer!

This is awesome! I started with a frozen bird, cut in half and let it rip.  Fall off the bone delicious in 5 hours.  I will make this again but I will cook on low.  The broth will make a wonderful gravy.  This is the first time I have rated a receipe and this one so deserves the 5 star.

My husband didn't really care for the taste or the look of the chicken.  The balsamic made the meat dark and not at all appetizing.

Sorry, but the combination of flavors used in the sauce/marinade did not work at all for my family. I used chicken breasts instead, as I'm not a fan of whole chickens with the skin, bones, etc. Based on other reviews to greatly reduce the oil, I only used 2 T and scaled my cooking time down considerably since I was only using breasts, knowing they would dry out rather quickly. I also threw in some potatoes and onions as well to round out the meal. This won't be a repeat, sorry to say, but thanks for the submission nonetheless!

I made this chickenbut did not have sesame oil so I used more olive oil.  I also didn't use much soy sauce.  This had great flavor.  I would make it again. My husband really raved about it.

AMAZING - it literally all fell right off the bones and was a big hit - I omitted the sesame oil although I thin next time I will be sure to add it - along with a teaspoon of minced ginger.  So, so good and a bit hit at my house.

I prepared this just as written and found the chicken to be dried out, and literally in shreds.  Cooked too long I guess, and although the sauce ws good, the flavor wasn't very strong when finished.  Won't make again, and will have to use this in enchiladas, or a wrap or something.

Served this to my guests and everyone enjoyed it.  I thought the timing was wrong, it was cooked a lot quicker than the recipe suggests.  By the time I'd taken it out of the slow cooker and served it was a bit dried out.  Next time I will cook it on low for 6 hours.

One of the best recipes on here. I make this all the time and there is no one who doesn't enjoy it. Even the pickiest eaters. Men especially love this chicken! I don't have sesame oil so I never have made it using it. I also like to drizzle honey half way through and cook with half a lemon in the cavity. Yums!

I made this for my family of 7.  So I had to make 2 chickens.  I didn't put as much olive oil as someone had suggested.  I had quite a bit of chicken leftover and the juice.  I made soup by sauteing thinly sliced celery, chopped onion and shredded carrot in a small amount of butter till crisp-tender.  Then I added a small can of chicken broth and simmered until the veggies were tender.  I added the leftover chicken, cut up, the leftover rice, and the leftover juice, with the fat skimmed off.  It seemed to be missing something, so I added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  I simmered this for about a half hour.  My family LOVED it!  I really like the original recipe and the remaining soup was great!

I thought this was really good. I used a 4.5 lb chicken, so I did double the recipe. The chicken came out very tender and really did fall off the bone. However, the cooking time in the recipe is way too long. I cooked mine on low for 4 1/2 hours and it was perfect.

I had high hopes from the other reviews, but this chicken was... blah. It had no taste and the texture was mealy, almost paste-like. It did fall off the bone, so that was good. We didn't even keep the leftovers.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY, and found it to be edible but nothing special. I cooked it on high for four hours, and by that time it was falling off the bone. The texture of the meat was a bit chalky and it wasn't really flavorful.

Recipe was a hit for dinner.  I made a few alterations.  Used about a 5 lb. bird.  Doubled all of the liquid ( & garlic) except for the oil.  I followed the other reviewers suggestion and put a quartered onion in the cavity.  I also didn't waste the time struggling to get the skin off of the wings.  I will shorten the cooking time next time I make it; he ended up to be a little dry.  Following another reviewer's suggestion I used the juice from the crock-pot as the liquid for my rice, it was really good also.

We really enjoyed this and it was SUPER easy!  I followed the recommendations of many reviewers and used just a small amount of olive oil.  Added extra chicken broth, used real maple syrup instead of honey (since that's what I had).  It was wonderful!  Next time, I'll add the carrots, etc right to it so they absorb some of the yummy flavor!

I love this recipe! Every time I make it, I like it even more! I usually serve it with basmati rice. Leftover chicken makes great sandwiches too.

It was very tender. In fact, the entire chicken fell apart in the crock pot.  That made it difficult to separate the small bone pieces from the meat, but the flavor was good. Everyone in the family liked it, but nobody loved it.

This turned out on the drier side. At least that is how I feel all long cooked chicken comes out...maybe it's me! The flavor was good, similar to a teriaki. May try again and turn them off a little sooner.

I made this to a tee yesterday.  8 hours on low is waaaay too long for a 3 lb chicken.  I took mine out of the slow cooker at about 6 1/2 hours and it was already starting to dry out.  But - the flavor was great and I will definitely make it again, but will cook it for 6 hours instead.

Not that great, it was just alright, pretty oily. I did not care for the sesame oil flavor. Served with brown rice and broccoli and my daughter loved it. I, on the other hand, didn't. Definitely won't be making this one again...sorry!

I've made this one a few times now, too. Word to the wise: do NOT let this cook too long! There is a fine line between wonderful and flavourful and overdone. I've made both, and when I did this right, it was DEE-licious! My whole family gobbled it up, and the slow cooker just seeps the flavours in. Again, I've used the sauce in soups the day after and it added so much great flavour!

The sauce is rather sweet, and low on flavor, also the chicken was definitely overcooked and a bit dry.  I used a 4.5 lb. chicken, cooked on high 4 hours and low for 1 more hour.  I followed recipe to a tee, and was surprised there was not more flavor given the ingredients.  The kids liked it, my husband did not, and I thought it was just so-so.

This dish is amazing!!  I followed the recipe minus the sesame oil and I just added a touch of olive oil instead of the recommended amount.  I also added fresh ginger root.  The chicken is soooo moist and it falls right off the bone!  I also added onions, potatoes and mushrooms that I coated on the bottom of the crock pot, and they all suck up the juices and are delicious!!  I used the extra juice as a topping for white rice as my side and I even topped off my dog's food with the juice, and she loooved it!!  I have extra chicken left over from this and I am making a pot pie with it tomorrow!

Excellent! My boyfriend LOVED it and wanted to take some leftovers for lunch the next day. :P I followed the recipe to the T. I just added double the amount of stock, and some crushed pepper and chopped green chili (I love spicy food). The meat was super-tender and juicy. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not enjoy this dish. I usually can salvage things that I don't like at first but I could do nothing with this dish.  There seemed to be too much soy and I did not even use the whole 1/3 cup.  The soy soaked through every bit and destroyed the flavor... I felt like I wasted a perfectly good chicken

This was ok. I followed the recipe except for adding sesame oil - because I didn't have any. You know what I found odd - the sauce part didn't have enough salt in it even though it contains 1/3 cup soy sauce.  I think I used the low salt chicken broth though so maybe that was why but I ended up salting the chicken more after cooking it.  The flavor almost tastes teriyaki like.  My whole chicken was 3 pounds and I planned on cooking it on the 4 hour high setting but mine was done after 3 hours. So check the chicken plenty of time before you think it will be done.  This is the first time I've cooked a whole chicken in the crock pot and it was indeed very easy but I think I might have to find another recipe.  This one isn't bad but it's not exciting either.

Just OK and the timing is ALL wrong. I cooked a 5 1/2 lb chicken and it only took 3 1/2 hours on LOW. This totally ruined dinner. Flavor was decent but not the best I've ever tasted.

My husband said that this was the best chicken I've ever made. I agree. We all had seconds. It had a teriyaki kind of flavor. I reduced the olive oil by half according to most reviews and think I could have reduced it even more (I did remove as much skin from the chicken as possible). Watch the cooking time! I had a 5 pd. chicken (adjusted the ingredients for 10 servings) which was partially immersed in the sauce and it was done after 4 hours. I found sesame oil at Fresh and Easy for only $2.99! Will definitely make again.

The sauce for this recipe is fabulous. I had all the ingredients except a whole chicken and about 6 minutes before going to work. My husband doesn't like anything with bones in it, plus he loves onions. So I layered the bottom of the crock pot with frozen minced onions, placed 3 large frozen chicken breasts on top of the onions, and then followed the rest of the recipe except for the minced garlic (extra powdered garlic instead).  8 hours on low - served it with brussel sprouts and brown and wild rice, garnished with the onions and sauce from the crock pot. He insisted that I post this! We're going to use the remaining chicken breast for a chicken Caesar salad.  Thanks, Kathy

This was fall off the bone tender.  I doubled the liquid as suggested.  I also substitued maple syrup for the honey.  I used extra garlic and added pepper.  My husband, who can be picky when it comes to trying new things, thought it was great.  We had the chicken over rice with fresh green beans...dinner was great.

This was a good recipe, and we may make it again, it just wasn't great.  The chicken was sweet and moist.  I doubled the liquids and cooked breast side down.  It fell off the bone, so it wasn't the prettiest chicken ever.

I followed the recipe as noted,I doubled the recipe, except I used 1/3 c of olive oil,my chicken weighed 5 lbs,the aroma incredibly sweet in nature, but the taste did not compare to the aroma,not not much flavor, I also included fresh tarragon/sage/rosemary/apple/onion which was in cavity, I ended up adding some brown sugar in the mix,and flipped the chicken half way through the process, the chicken is moist. I plan on making brown rice and whole wheat pasta, will try again in the future and tweak a few things.....

I followed the recipe exactly.  Came out very flavorful, but over cooked.  I wouldn't leave it in for so long next time.  I used the meat for fried rice and chicken salad (not presentable for dinner plate).

definitely smelled wonderful while cooking - did taste good, but after reading the reviews I expected more - next time I will try on low for 8 hours instead of 4 hours on high to see if the flavor infuses any better

I've made my fair share of whole chickens in the crock pot so was intrigued by this recipe.  Frankly, even at low temp for 8 hours the chicken was over cooked.  This is not a recipe to start when you are leaving for an 8 hour day of work.  It takes less time.   I think part of the problem is that the salty soy sauce forces the chicken to cook faster.  Next time, I'll cook it for less time and cut back on the soy sauce.  The only modifications I made were what others suggested.  I substituted white wine for the balsamic vinegar. Like others, I cut back on the oils.  Even after skinning the chicken, it was plenty oily enough. Also, I wasn't in the mood to squeeze a lemon, so added a splash of OJ instead.  I also loaded the cavity with onions.  I might try quartered oranges next time.  Personally, I think this is an interesting base recipe, and I plan to experiment with it again, hence the four stars.

I have done this a couple of times now and both times it has been great. It is so tender and it is a gentle flavour. Doing it in the slow cooker takes the thought out of it. My husband thinks it is the best way to cook a whole chicken. I certainly won't do it any other way.

This was a very good and easy recipe. The chicken didn't have to cook very long to have a great flavor...mine cooked too long and came apart when trying to remove it from the pot. I added some quartered potatoes and whole baby carrots..I also quartered an onion and put it in the cavity of the chicken like another reviewer suggested.  It was a great meal 2 nights in a row!

I'm on a slow cooker kick and this was a very simple recipe and easy to throw together before leaving for work. I followed the recipe to a "T" and agree with one of the reviewers who found that there might be too much oil. (Could also be that I was too lazy to de-skin the bird and that added to the greasiness.) Pepper and ginger would probably add a little zing. Overall, the bird turned out delicious and even better, it was easy!

My husband and I were looking for a good way to slow cook our whole chicken, and this was DELICIOUS!  Since our grocery store doesn't have many smaller chickens, we used a 7-pound bird, doubled all the sauce ingredients, and cooked it breast side down for 6 hrs 30 mins on high.  We also threw some sliced mushrooms in with it and cut the oil, as many others did (we used 1/4 cup for a double batch of sauce).  It turned out perfectly, and was SO easy to prepare for the slow cooker!  We're definitely making this again next time we have a whole chicken to prepare!

It was pretty good.  SUPER tender, I could barely get it out without it falling apart.  I omitted the lemon juice and sesame oil because I didn't have them and it was OK.  It tasted alright but didn't have much pizazz.  Tasted great as leftovers in stir-fry.

This was sooooooooo good. The smallest chicken I could find was a 4lb. I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup, other than that I followed the recipe.

the only reason i rate this a 3 is b/c it was very easy to assemble as i didn't skin it first.  otherwise i was not impressed at all.  it was very bland, even with basting.  i doubled the liquids, but only used a TB of olive oil, and cooked a 4.5lb. bird on high for 4hrs.  it was very moist, just no taste.  and the sauce wasn't that great either.  this recipe can't seem to make up it's mind on whether it's chicken adobo or chicken teriyaki.  i'm going to try and salvage the meat and use the leftover chicken to make wonton soup.

Wow, I loved how easy and delicious this was. I was out of a few ingrediants so I had to sub corn syrup for honey, white vinegar for balsamic, and olive oil for sesame oil, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and the chicken still turned out beyond delicious, I love it! Thank you!

My family thought this was delicious!  I used a 5lb skinned, whole chicken but didn't quite double the sauce.  I used a few tablespoons of oil, per other readers suggestions and cooked it breast down for just over 3 hours on high.  When I tried to take it out, it was falling apart and perfect.  I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and served it with rice and broccoli - not a morsel was left.

Whole family loved it. It was done quickly on high. My crockpot has the ability to turn it up to 375 degrees, so i browned it first and then slow cooked it on low and it was very moist.

This just didn't turn out great for me despite other good reviews. Some of the chicken was dry even though I used more liquid per other reviews. The flavor of the sauce is nice, but the chicken didn't taste that great.

Delightfully moist, with good flavor. I was out of soy, but had Teriyaki sauce on hand and it worked. The chicken was so falling-off-the-bones tender that the biggest problem was getting it out of the crock pot :-)

Served it over Basmati rice with a generous ladle of the juice and it made a hit with hubby.

I made this with Cornish hens, and I was disappointed. There really was hardly any flavor at all. I cooked them on low for 4 hours, and they were pretty tender, but there was only the slightest hint of flavor. Thanks anyway.

Very good chicken.  I doubled the ingredients because I had a bigger whole chicken.  I think that if I had bothered to make gravy out of the liquid it would have been wonderful, but I wasn't in the mood to do that last night.  It certainly makes  a lot, but that is good because I can use the chicken and broth for soup or something else!

Used chicken thighs.  I also cooked them on the stove top.  Browned the flour-coated chicken and sliced onions.  Simmered with the rest of the sauce ingredients for about 45 mins. Might want to reduce the soy sauce a bit; it can be a little salty.  Great with rice.

I made this with the setting on low for 6 hours and the chicken was more than ready.  It was almost a little dry and chewy.  The bones and meat were all jumbled together because it was so tender.  I think the scent & aroma from the sauce was better than how it really tasted.  Not horrible, but nothing i'd make again.

With all the flavorful ingredients, this didn't have much flavor.  The chicken was tender, but somewhat bland.

Tried it yesterday - this chicken should come with a warning label!  It turned out great...wonderful flavor, I couldn't stop eating it while I was trying to get it onto a plate :-).  I placed the chicken breast side down and made sure the entire chicken was covered with liquid by making more of the marinade than called for in the recipe.  I cooked it for almost 8 hours on low, but didn't have any problems with dryness.  The meat turned out very moist and tender.  I also added some fresh rosemary halfway through.  I used the leftover chicken broth and some of the marinade to make basmati rice to serve with the chicken.  Excellent!

Really nice flavors in this. I up'd everything a bit, except the oil, and did add some cornstarch at the end to thicken. Everyone loved this over mashed potatoes. Makes a lovely gravy. I also added red pepper flakes to spice it up.

I chose the 8-hour low cooking option and my chicken came out pretty dry.  The flavor was good but not mindblowing.

This recipe was perfect because I actually had almost everything on hand.  I had to make a substitution for the balsamic vinegar  (red wine vinegar and sugar), though.  The chicken turned out perfect and the sauce was just delicious!  My boyfriend loved it too.  I'll definitely be keeping this recipe nearby :)  Thank you, Kathy! :)

Delicious chicken! I had never skinned a whole chicken before, but it was easier than I thought. The honey with the soy sauce and other ingredients made a wonderful tasting sauce and it tasted great spooned over rice. My children, ages 5 and 7, gave it a big thumbs up.

The flavor was delicious and the chicken was incredibly moist.  Too moist.  The chicken just fell apart when you tried to take it out of the crockpot, so it was pretty messy.  In all fairness, I let it cook a bit longer than the recipe called for, so that may have been part of the problem.

The chicken was quite dry and fell apart when I tried to remove it from the crock pot.  The flavor was ok (but I did switch the honey for brown sugar and the balsamic vinegar for rice vinegar).  Don't think I will be making this again.

Wasn't overly impressed with this one. It is a very easy recipe, but it turned out a bit dry and the flavour was seemed a bit off. There is a possibility that I would give this a second chance though.

Eight hours may have been a bit too long. I found the chicken to be somewhat dry, which was surprising.

I made this in my 3 quart slow cooker. The chicken came out darker from the soy. It was very soft and moist, and of course tasty. My husband loved this chicken. He said it was the best yet! I will be making this again.

The chicken had a delicious flavor and was very tender. I added a little chili oil and an extra tablespoon of fresh garlic. It was great served over basmati rice.  Next time I'll try adding a vegetable for some color, maybe peas.

Oh my! This was great! I used a 6 lb. chicken so I doubled the sauce etc and cooked for 5 hours on high, which was TOO LONG. I omitted the sesame oil and added onion chunks and red pepper. It was NOT greasy and fell apart it was so tender. The outside of the chicken got this wonderful carmelized taste as well. I took some of the sauce and stir fried it with some veggies and served it over rice. Just perfect! Will definately make again! Next time, I might use chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken just to save time.

This recipe was wonderful. I substituted 2 cornish game hen for the 3lbs. of chicken. It tasted a lot like a korean dish called kalbi gim....Wonderful. Not too sweet at all and perfect with plain short grain white rice. Great recipe! I'll use it for years!

Oh my goodness!! I made it yesterday and it was so good but very different. My boyfriend told me it is different but not used to the taste. My 4 years old son won't eat it but after 10 minutes later he ate them all! I added black peppers and red cheyenne pepper to kick in some flavor and it turned out great! I will make it again! Thanks for sharing this great recipes!!!

Did not care for this at all. Very greasy, had to keep skimming out oil.  My husband thought it was ok.  I wouldn't recommend using a whole chicken, it falls apart and bones can be dangerous for little ones. I do think it might be better with chicken pieces.

Wonderful! I cooked it 4 hours on high and then took the chicken out, thickened the sauce with cornstarch, and then put the meat from the chicken back in and served it over rice. I also added pepper, and rubbed it all over the chicken before putting it in the crock. This is going into the regular rotation.

Interesting recipe.  I thought it was pretty good, but it seemed to me like it was missing something.  My partner raved about it and loved it just the way it was though!  I will keep this one around for a while, but I think that I need to give it a few tweaks still...

I served it over white rice that I made with the extra chicken broth that was left over in place of some of the water.

I wasn't too sure how this would turn out but everyone in my family really liked it.  My husband asked me to make it again today.  It is very easy since it's done in the crock-pot.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I love this recipe and use it often, and I don't change a thing except that I use whatever chicken pieces I have, not a whole.  Removing the skin (and all that fat) and still yielding wonderfully tender and tasty chicken is why this one's at the top of my list for chicken.  Thanks Kathy, for updating my former recipe with a healthier version.

Great, easy recipe and delicious, delicious, delicious to boot!  Good for working women to put in the crockpot before heading for work and when they come home in the evening the delicious smell in the kitchen permiates the air.

Yuck, worst thing I ever made I’m my crockpot. Wasted a perfectly good chicken. It was dry, don’t know how that could happen. I did leave the skin on don’t know why that would make a difference.  Bleccch.

This is my go-to whole chicken recipe. I throw everything in the crockpot before work and its done when I get home. I've even made this with leg quarters, cutting the cooking time in half. This recipe does not disappoint!

Well, I kind of made it!  Used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken otherwise it's too much for my husband and me.   I let the chicken sit in the marinade for a couple of hours and then baked at 350 for about an hour.  Very glad to have the inspiration Kathy!

I'll reduce olive oil next time and make up the difference by adding more sesame oil, which we love.  Doubled balsamic vinegar and Worcester sauce because we like the flavor.  Also stuffed lightly salted onion quarters in the cavity and placed bird in cooker meat side down.  Stayed moist and had super flavor.  Husband told me to throw away the other whole chicken recipes...this one is a winner!

This was delicious! I used my pressure cooker for 50 min (3.5#) maybe could have gone less, but was tender and easy to shred. Removing the skin made leftovers so easy and less fat in drippings..

Made 3 times in eight weeks (July-August 2018).  The whole family loved it.  Chicken falls off the bone.   Delicious part-Asian flavor has potential for other recipes and cooking methods (Pork, stir fries, fish -although I've not yet tried them yet).  The one downside is for our family, it's too salty as written.  

I'll use low sodium soy sauce or cut back on the soy amount next time I cook it,  and I  guarantee there will be a next time!  

Thanks, Kathy for an easy and tasty low-stress family meal!

this recipe is one of our family's favorites. We make it quite often and the kids always request it. To avoid dealing with the bones and skin, I substitute boneless skinless chicken thighs for the whole chicken.   the flavor is great either way.

Flavor was delicious and both my wife and I agreed that we would make this again but try it with chicken breasts or thighs. We found the chicken fell apart badly and made it necessary to "bone hunt" before each bite.

I have made this dish several times. First time I used a whole chicken and the chicken disintegrated in my crockpot. So many bones to pick out. Now I use either chicken thighs boneless or chicken breast boneless. I find that works much better. It is so easy and served  over rice it is a wonderful dish.  I have also served it over noodles.

Two changes:  I used chicken pieces with skin and bones: breasts, thighs and legs.  And I cooked this in my new  Instant Pot, using the slow cooker setting.  I kept the ingredients the same, but using slightly less soy sauce ( didn't have enough ) and slightly less honey (didn't want it too sweet, you can always add more.... ).  This was really good, everyone really liked it and I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for posting!

I brined the chicken the day before.   Rinsed and placed in slow cooker breast side down.  Turned several times during the 5 hours on slow setting.   Made marinade without Olive Oil.

Yes. I used a ginger marinade, 1 T. Of A1. Didn't have Worcester sauce put  olive oil instead of the specialty oil. We just ate it again for the second time and it was terrific.

Very easy recipe to follow and make.  Had all ingredients at home.  The only thing I changed was that I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper prior to placing in the slow cooker.  Everyone liked it (husband and 3 kids - 2 teens and 1 child).  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  Used a 6 lb chicken and doubled the sauce recipe.  Because of the size of the chicken, I cooked for 1-1/2 hours on high and switched to low for another 3-4 hours.  It was a bit overdone and that might have been because of the size of the chicken and doubling the sauce brought the liquid up so high that only the top of the breast was showing.  Was more like stewing than braising but it was delicious.  A keeper.

This was delicious!  I did double the liquid, to keep moist and added a quartered onion inside the chicken cavity!  So tender and will make again!

I used this recipe since I wanted to slow cook something for the DH and me for our Christmas dinner. I threw everything together according to the recipe and we went out and about for the day. When we came back, we were overwhelmed by the stench in our apartment... To be fair, the chicken was tender and fell off the bone, but the smell was so off-putting neither of us could eat it. I was deeply disappointed with this recipe.

This turned out great! Fell off the bone tender and flavorful. I cooked it in my crock pot on low for about 5 hours. My family loved it and are already requesting it again. I thought that there could have been a lot less oil used and more broth. Also, I think next time, I'll add in some veggies.

I had a 5 lb bird, still quite chilled, and it still came out overcooked. Even sitting in the sauce! That was pretty disappointing. The sauce itself was good, but no one was raving about it.

So simple and so delicious.  The chicken falls off  the bones and it's like pulled pork but with chicken.  Zesty and tangy.  I thumbs up from all 4 members of my family, a rarity.

Very easy recipe.  Eight hours in a Crock Pot left the chicken falling-off-the-bone tender but dry.  Next time I'll cook it for five or six hours max.  Made a roux from margarine and flour cooked to a golden brown, then stirred in the liquid from the Crock Pot to make gravy and served it over mashed potatoes.  The gravy was slightly sweet, probably from the honey, but everybody liked it.

So very good! Worth the extra work to skin the whole chicken before placing in crock pot. I may do a few (3-4lbs worth) chicken breasts next time to be an even simpler recipe.

I've mad this numerous times with a whole chicken, chicken breast or precooked shredded chicken.  
The only change I've made is to reduce the olive oil to 1tbsp.  My husband loves this and if you have frozen precooked chicken it's a great way to use it up and have a delicious, healthy meal.  I strongly recommend trying this recipe

Followed the recipe, but we did not like the way the meat or sauce tasted. My husband offered to buy pizza...

Will try to use the leftovers in tacos (with a good deal of modification to the seasonings), but not confident of that meal either.

I made this overnight using a 3.5-4 lb whole chicken. Cooked on low for just over 6 hours, and chicken is falling off the bone! I opted to leave the skin on only because I have arthritis in my hands and fingers.  

I read through many of the reviews, and I tweaked the original recipe a little.  I used 1 TBSP of olive oil, eliminated the sesame oil, used 1 cup chicken stock, and doubled everything else.  I'm not sure what kind of ingredients others used who said it came out tasteless, because this chicken has a great flavor!  I will have it over brown rice for dinner tonight!

I made this yesterday and my husband and I LOVED it. Very juicy and and great flavor combination. I used some of the recommendations from other reviewers and used 1/2 the amount of Olive Oil. I also placed the chicken breast side down. The only reason I am holding back on a 5 star review was because I wouldn't necessarily use the liquid as a sauce to ladle on top of the chicken with rice (which is how I served It). It just seemed to oily to do so, but I do think the oil is necessary for the cooking process and for the juicy and tender result. This is definitely a keeper!

I used chicken pieces (wings and drumsticks) and it was very good. I started on low for about an hour or two, then turned it up to high for three hours.  It smelled great!

Was so easy and delicious. The chicken was falling off the bone. This one is defiantly a keeper.

Good flavor! I cut the olive oil down to maybe 1 Tbsp, omitted the sesame oil because I didn't have any, and stuffed the inside of the chicken with onion wedges, as recommended by other reviewers. Cooked on low and it was very moist.

Came across this recipe by accident. I had 2 whole chickens in my freezer, and went looking for a roasting recipe when this caught my eye. Been going through a slow cooker phase, so thought this would be great to try. It was one of the most flavorful chickens I've ever made. The chicken was about 6 lbs, and fit perfectly in my 6-quart cooker. I doubled all the liquid except the oil, which I kept the same. I didn't use the sesame oil, since I didn't have any on hand. Did 4 hours on high, since I was short on time. It came out great. Falling off the bone, and so much flavor! When we'd finished with dinner, I took the leftover meat off the bones and into a plastic container, and bagged all the bones which I put in the freezer to make stock with later. The next day, the meat was even better. I ground some up, added a little mayo and sweet relish to make an excellent chicken salad. Thinking I'll make that second chicken using this same recipe next week. Definitely a winner.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I doubled the liquid and did not skin the chicken, but used less oil.  The breast meat surprisingly still came out dry, while the dark meat and wings were amazing.  I also took it out of the sauce (it did fall apart) and placed it under the broiler for just 1 minute or so to crispen up the skin.  The flavor was great, I will just amend the cooking time next time, or maybe just use this with leg quarters instead of a whole chicken.

I had high hopes for this chicken based on the other reviews.  I was somewhat disappointed.  Tasted like just very plain chicken and I do mean very plain.  This recipe needs something to spice it up.  Maybe I did not use enough garlic.  Maybe 10x more would help.  Maybe 11 herbs and spices.

Great recipe.  Flavorful and unique.  It's a much needed and welcome departure from my regularly seasoned crock pot - whole chicken recipe. 
I omitted the chicken broth, as I thought it really wasn't  entirely necessary.    I added a splash of sherry wine, curry, green onion and some ginger to kick it up a notch.  Serve with a good quality rice like jasmine.  It hits the spot.  ;o)

I read a few reviews and made some modifications based on these. First I omitted the olive oil as I did not want it to be greasy. I reduced the cooking time a lot: 2hours on low, then flipped the chicken over for another 2 hours on low. The chicken turned out flavourful and not too dry.

Made this tonight using my 2.5 lb turkey breast which is the only alteration made even though balsamic vinegar & soy sauce seemed an odd combination but wanted to rate this honestly and honestly, hubby who js picky gave ut a 5 star!  He always finds room to improve most recipes but this one is perfect as is.   Made it with vegetable fried rice and japanese  zucchini & onions.

This is fabulous. I gave the recipe to some of my slow cooker friends and they loved it too..they served with Korean potato noodles. My husband is not a big chicken fan and he raved about it. A definite keeper.

I left the skin on my chicken and left out the olive oil.  It came out so tender and juicy.

I tried this recipe. All of the ingredients sounded amazing. Our family of 4 adults said that it was good but not great. The meat did fall off the bone, and the only thing I wasn't able to add was the sesame oil. Maybe that's what might have made the difference. I will not try this again, on to another recipe for the crock pot whole chicken.

Well...this is the first recipe that I did not like on here. I was so excited to try it too.  I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was very dry and had no flavor. I had to dip the chicken into the extra sauce to have some taste. Don't get me wrong the sauce wasn't bad but I wouldn't make it again. Everything else I put in the slow cooker comes out great and juicy... I'm not sure what went wrong. There are plenty of other recipes to chose from. Win some lose some.

This was great!  My husband loved the meat, but thought the sauce was a bit sweet; our daughter & I enjoyed it!
I did do things a bit differently - but not by much.  My "chicken" turned out to be a 7.6 # turkey!  I ran out of time, so seared it in the oven @ 500 before finishing it at 325.  Also, I salted the cavity & added some white pepper, then stuffed it with dried shallots & leafy celery hearts.  I use about 1/3 pinot grigio white wine in place of some of the chicken broth.  It came out so tender!  :)  We served it with a recipe of 'coconut rice' by Emma Maher and steamed broccoli.  Thanks, Kathy!!!  :)

We used the pressure cooker instead of the crock pot, and it worked out great. I suggest not to skip the sesame oil--it adds such great flavor. We did cut the olive oil in half as other reviewers suggested. I think if we had let it marinate in the sauce mixture before cooking this would have been even better. The dark meat was awesome, it had great flavor. So tender and juicy! White meat wasn't as impressive, so will definitely marinade it next time and see if that helps.

Not bad, if I were to make it again, I would probably marinate the chicken in the sauce, and put the marinade and chicken directly in the slow cooker.  The recipe could use a little bit of a kick as well.

I made this for my family and everyone loved it. I cooked it for 6 hours instead of 8. It was a hit with my family.

the flavor of the chicken was really tasty,, next time i may scoop some of the liquid out, put it in a saucepan and make a thicker gravy with it, i think shortening the time to possibly six hours may help the texture of the chicken but that is usually what happens with chicken in the crock pot,, flavorwise though this was really really good

I can not believe how good this was! I had never skinned a chicken before, it was easy (except for the wings, I just left the skin on them). I followed the recipe exactly excepting that since I had a 5 1/2 pound chicken, I cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours. Careful taking it out of the slow cooker, the chicken is so tender, it falls apart. I had roasted brussel sprouts and Orzo with Parmesan and Basil as side dishes (all from this site). I will do again!

Very good! I used a 5 pound chicken, but placed it in slow cooker breast side down so it was immersed in the liquid the whole time. Excellent! Next time, I will take time to reduce and thicken sauce with cornstarch to make a thicker gravy. Served with sticky white rice, everyone licked the bowl!!

I followed the recipe exactly and found it  not to be as flavorful as the other reviews.  Also it was on the dry side, perhaps because the skin was removed.  I'll stick to roasting a chicken in the oven.

I had a 5.5 lb whole chicken, so this is what I used. I doubled the sauce. The flavor was fantastic. This recipe is definitely a keeper for us.
For our family (not that this was a bad recipe,) I would make this again, but I'd try 6 chicken breast halves instead. Reason- we didn't like all the bones and other 'stuff' in this dish.
Would love to know if anyone has altered this recipe for anything other than a whole chicken, including other kinds of meat... anyone?

I was really excited about making this, and I followed the recipe exactly, but it just didn't turn out well. It was overly greasy, overcooked and bland. The blandness really surprised me, given all of the flavorful ingredients. Something is definitely missing. I won't be making it again.

This is the best chicken I have ever had - cooked it in a 350 deg. oven for 4 hrs. in a cast iron pot with lid  but it didn't need that long. The sauce was delicious and thick - served it over rice.  Good enough for company!

This recipe is incredible and for sure a keeper!  Makes 6 servings, but I'm bummed I can't eat it all myself!  The only thing I did differently, was I added the whole can of chicken broths which was 2 cups because I wouldn't have used up the broth with any other recipes, then I upped the other ingredients also to compensate.  The chicken is so tender and the sauce so tasty- it will make an excellent gravy.

Not really happy with this recipe.  Skinning the chicken, and resulting sauce just didn't live up to other "allrecipes".  Resulting chicken will go into soup, sauce was too oily even though we used less olive oil.

I will not make this again. I used this recipe to save time, but will be spending extra time to make this into a casserole or salad, because it's not acceptable for a main dish as is.  I cooked on low setting for only about 4 1/2 hours, and it was already falling apart but the meat was extremely dry.  

Based on other reviews, I made some modifications.  I used apple juice in addition to chicken broth, eliminated the honey, balsamic, and sesame oil; I reduced the soy sauce, used very little olive oil, and added salt, pepper, garlic, and onion to both the chicken itself and the liquid.

Made this recipe with a 5lb. chicken and upped the ingredients for the larger bird. I also increased the time from 4 hrs on high to 6 hrs on high. Five hours would have been plenty for this size bird. The flavor is fantastic, and it is so tender. Love this recipe and shared it with others.

This was the first time for me to cook in a slow cooker. I love to cook, and had to do a slow cooker.  All the reviews helped me make an amazing dinner for my family.  Thank you for making my life easier. I am now making another recipe off this site with my slow cooker.

Only cooked for 5 hours and it still had dried out chicken breasts and inedible "gravy"!

This was alright.  I think it turns out dry for those who use the high option, it is better to slow cook it on low.  I wasn't completely impressed with this recipe, but it was tasty enough to enjoy.  I only made it for myself, and I think that was a good choice rather than making it for others.  I followed the directions precisely, maybe I need to try some of the suggested improvements as it lacks a real distinct and memorable flavor.

I made this recipe the other night.  After reading the reviews, I added 1/4 t pepper and I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup.  This was the most tender chicken I have ever cooked.  It had great flavor.  My husband loved it and so did the kids.  I will say that I think there was still to much oil.  However, I think the oil is what helps make it so tender.  I am going to reduce the oil to 1/8 cup next time.  I tried making gravy with it and it was really hard to do with all of the oil in it.  However, it still came out good.  I will definitely make this again.  My whole house smelled awesome all day, and this is a good "presentation" chicken for company because cooking it in the sauce gives it a nice golden brown color.  I would definitely make this for company and I know it looks good on the table and I will impress company with how tender this chicken is.  Thank you for the recipe.

Loved it!!!  I left skin on because I'm lazy.  When the chicken was cooked the skin just fell off took 2 minutes to get rid of.  I reduced olive oil to 2 tablespoons.  And I changed honey for splenda as I eat low carb but next time I'm going to miss it all together.  The chicken was amazing.  So easy to prepare and serve.  My husband and my 3 year old boy loved it.  Thanks for the fab recipe!!

Simple and yummy - I skinned my chicken threw in the sauce mix (I doubled it - won't next time) and flipped the chicken twice during the cooking. I didn't use sesame oil - only because I have never had a recipe calling for it before and a bottle was around $8.00.  I had tons of flavor and will make again someday. I also made brown rice - and saute'd zucchini and onions. Great meal. Thanks Kathy!

What a success. Just become owner of a Morphy Richard 3.5 oval ceramic slow cooker. Never done a whole chicken in a slow cooker before. Cooked it 6 hours on medium. Result - tender and tasty. Had the ingredients for the sauce but guessed at measurements not being used to "cups". Must have done something right. Really added to the flavour. Will most certainly do it again. So easy.

Just finished cooking this, and I'm sorry to say it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The combination of ingredients gives it a weird taste to me...almost like using italian dressing salad.  Definitely will not make this again.

Very good. My husband doesn't like it when I do whole chicken in the slow cooker and he really liked this! I found out too late that I was out of honey and used Maple Syrup. It was yummy but I could see how honey would be better with the other ingredients. I used the bones and left over meat to make a rich broth that was great for lentil soup the next day. So good!

I was hesitant to make this recipe at first but I gave it a try. I had used a 6lb chicken and increased everything. I thought it was a little on the dry side but my company thought it was fine. I had it cooking on low for 8.5 hours because I could not shut it off any sooner. I think next time I will try to turn it off much sooner. I will use less sesame oil as well, it seemed to overwhelm it a bit. It literally does fall off the bone and makes a great gravy. I served this with rice.

had very good flavor.  Was a little too watery for the end product.  I used cornish hens ( I didn't have a chicken on hand).

This was amazingly delicious.  We cooked a 3-lb. whole chicken in the slow cooker while we were out for 4-hours, and ended up inviting another couple to join us for dinner.  We were all impressed with the great taste.  We served it with rice and used the marinade to top the rice, and also served a refreshing garden salad.  Be sure to use the sesame oil as it is so flavorful.  This is definitely a keeper!

The meat was tender and fell off the bone but it essentially had no flavor.  I was disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.

good recipe when youre feeling too lazy to cook but want something relatively fancy. my only complaint is that parts of the chicken came out a bit dry (mostly the breast). the leftover sauce makes for a good gravy when mixed with some cornstarch!

This was DEEEElicious!  I couldn't get enough of the chicken or the sauce -- even the white meat parts, which I generally dislike because it's usually so dry, but not so with this dish!  I will definitely make this again next time a whole bird is on sale.  (I had a 5 lb bird and inputed "10 servings" to get the right ratio.  Next time, I might add a little more chicken broth than recommended so that more of the bird is covered in liquid.  I also added black pepper and cayenne pepper and omitted Worcestershire, and it tasted great!)

This recipe was so easy!  I let it marinate in the crock pot/slow cooker over night and Sunday morning, put it on high; it was ready for Sunday dinner when we got home from church!  I added some ginger and used fresh garlic cloves.  It just fell apart and was so good!  Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious! My husband finds it quite terrible looking, but enjoys the flavor.  My entire family enjoys it and the leftovers are almost better than the original.  The flavors combine so well togther and it is such an easy dish to make.  For someone as busy as I am, I really appreciate the crockpot recipes!

Not such a great recipe. Made it exactly as it said and the chicken didn't have much flavor and was a bit rubbery. I would not recommend this recipe....

My family loved this. It was a bit dry, but I feel like it's impossible not to be when cooking a whole skinless chicken. Will make it again for sure. We had tons of juice left over-an suggestions? I hate to throw it away!

I had a couple of chicken legs I need to use up, so I tried this recipe. I thought it was just good but the Hubby really loved it. I reduced the oil in the sauce to 2 tablespoons, I can't see why it would have needed 1/3 of a cup. When it was done, I removed the chicken and added some cornstarch mixed with cold water to the sauce to thicken it. I served over brown rice. I'll probably make it again.

Fabulous!  I added a ton of garlic powder but otherwise follwed the directions exactly.  With the left over chicken we made an amazing Pesto chicken pizza and chicken noodle soup.  SO GOOD

I wasn't a fan. The chicken turned out very sticky chewy. It is likely because I have a small crock pot so the chicken was totally submerged in liquid and was just boiled, bleh. I won't make it again.

Tonight was the second time I tried this recipe. The first time it was without a doubt the best chicken recipe I had tried, I just didn't like how only the lower half of the chicken absorbed the juices. Tonight I decided to try it with boneless skinless chicken breasts instead...big mistake! The chicken did absorb the juices, but way too much. For some reason the sauce tasted too salty, but when I did it the first time it seemed sweeter. I also agree with other reviews, saying that the sauce is too oily. Cut down the olive oil.

Had all the ingredients on hand. Didn't like the flavor and I love oriental flavors. Also, cooked for less time stated and it still was over done. Meat did fall of the bone, but the texture was dry. Too much trouble to remove skin, and it was still oily. Won't be doing this again.

Did not follow this recipe since I worked with what I had in the kitchen. I used Kens steak house Tomato vinaigrette dressing instead of balsamic vinegar and I used sesame seeds instead of sesame oil. Turned out ok, liked the flavor, but removing the skin from a whole chicken is not some thing I will be doing again. I usually use boneless and skinless chicken breasts and when I do use a whole chicken it is with skin on.

The chicken was done in exactly the time frame the recipe called for, and it really was fall off the bone delish.  Fiance and I ate it up!  I doubled the liquid part, but next time will double the liquid EXCEPT the oil.  There really is too much.  Excellent choice, and very easy to make.  Enjoy!

What an awesome and easy recipe!  And so delicious!  We even cut a little bit of the sugar for dietary reasons.  I like the fact that the skin comes off and it is still juicy and tender.  Yummm!

I have made this a few times now and it is absolutely delicious!  I have the advantage of checking it while it's cooking, but it's easy to see when it's ready because it just falls of the bone.  I use more garlic cloves, so tasty.  My husband loves it and uses the leftovers for sandwiches throughout the week.

Excellent and easy! Great for a busy working mom! I added four halved russet potatoes and put them cut side down on the chicken and they were great.  My husband loved it and said he didn't even need butter on the potatoes.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious flavor... I would double the sauce recipe next time though, because I added the rice to the slow cooker about an hour before chicken was done, and the rice cooked in all the delicious juice. I just needed more rice!

I left the skin on (but pulled it out when done cooking), just loosened it on the bird so the flavors could get in. Turned it a few times while cooking. The chicken literally fell right off the bone for a shredded effect. Amazing flavor! Served it over white rice. Will make this again!

Excellent flavor. I used chicken breasts instead of whole chicken, added a jar of mushrooms the last hour. When finished cooking, took a couple of cups of the sauce and thickened with some corn starch, made a very good sauce. Served chicken and mushrooms over rice, again excellent flavor. Thanks!!

This meal was actually pretty good. The end resault is a tender chicken with a flavorful sauce that has a slight Asian theme to it. I personalized it with my favorite pot roast vegies, fresh mushrooms, green and red pepper, and onions.  I served it over rice and enjoyed it. My husband did too...he asked for the leftovers!

After years of not owning a slow cooker I decided to try this as the first chicken recipe in my new pot. I followed the recipe exactly, even as to coincidently plating it with jasmine rice and green beans as in the picture! However, the results were not to our liking. I had a five-pound bird (a little difficult to skin), and it was literally falling off the bone at 5 hours looking woefully pale. I ended up taking the cooking juice from the crock pot, adding some mushrooms. sliced red pepper and hoisin sauce and boiling it down to a light syrupy consistency and spooning it over the rice and meat. I also found it extremely salty. I would try using the same marinade ingredients again, but roast it in the oven for a brown, crispy (skin on) bird.

Made this recipe with no changes and it was delicious!  I used a 4 lb. chicken and cooked on low for 9 hours due to my schedule. It fell apart as I took it out of the slow cooker but was delicious and tender and the sauce was very tasty.

YUM YUM YUM!!!!  Juicy, flavorful and E A S Y to make!  The hint of honey is really wonderful.  The only change was the addition of some fresh ginger.  Great recipe!

This was great.  I used a 5 1/2 lb chicken, so I doubled the recipie.  It was fantastic.  It tasted similar to chicken adobo, but not as tangy.  It is now in my whole chicken rotation.  Thanks.

I'm rating this a low 3 stars. I used chicken leg quarters. My only ingredient differences was half honey + half syrup. I did not use any olive oil in the crock pot since most commented it was too oily. I had it on low for 8 hours and it was tender but the taste didn't particularly appeal to me. I'd rather try other chicken slow cooker recipes.

I found it extremely difficult to remove the skin of a whole, raw chicken (but I'm still new to cooking.) So, I just pulled most of it off, and left some on that wouldn't budge! I also think I should probably heat up the honey next time before I mix it in, because it was very difficult to get it to blend together with the other ingredients. Also, I think I might have overcooked the chicken, as it was in my slow cooker for almost 11 hours. I rated the recipe very high, though, because the flavors were excellent! I will definitely make this again, but I will be better prepared next time.

I don't know if I own the hottest slowcooker known to man, but after 3 hours on high I could smell that the chicken was getting overcooked.  And it was.  Flavor was fine, but not sure I'll try tweaking it next time.

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  The chicken stayed juicy and had loads of flavor.  It fell apart though when removing from the crockpot so don't plan on presenting it whole - but's that's okay for me!  My whole family enjoyed it!

This was the first time I cooked in a slow cooker and it was AWESOME! My family loved it and I have very picky eaters. They loved this recipe and want me to make it more often. I followed it to a T. It was excellent! I so love to cook now!

I'd recommend this for anyone who hasn't cooked a whole chicken before and needs a tasty but easy place to start. I'm just out of college and made this for my mom for Mothers' Day- my first "real" meal for her, and my first chicken. It was perfect. I followed the advice of other reviews and doubled the liquid while halving the olive oil and it was great! My small bird was from the farmers' market and wasn't marked with poundage, so I just watched it carefully. I ended up going 3 hours on high and 45 minutes on low and it was just right.

I doubled the sauce. It was very yummy. Next time I think I will try taking the skin off to give all the chicken a chance at the flavor.

The chicken just fell off the bone.  I'll use this whenever I need shredded chicken I think.  It tasted good too.  I usually make recipes with boneless chicken just because that is easier to deal with, but this was so easy to get off the bone.

Used a 4.5 lb chicken and let it go 5hrs on low. Was still a little dry, could probably have used 1/2 hr less. Flavor was good though, not overpowering, but not too bland. Will try again with a little tweaking.

The chicken was great.  I didn't have sesame oil & didn't want to lug my kids out to get it so I left it out & used a little it of olive oil instead.  I was delicious though.  I didn't want to take the time to take off the skin either so I left it on.  It was quick & easy & made great leftovers.

This chicken dish was so tasty.  The meat was falling off the bone...very tender.  I loved how easy it was to prepare - just toss it all into the slow cooker and turn it on.  I will definitely use this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my husband and our neighbor...we all thought it was delicious! It was so easy to make. I did put slices of butter into the chicken before I put it into the slow cooker..it made it so moist! I also basted the chicken with the juice throughout the day.

This was pretty tasty.  It had a very nice flavor, but I am trying to try healthier options and this was quite greasy.  However, like I said, it had a very nice flavor and I also spooned some of the sauce over rice.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe for when I just need to throw something together! I reduced the amount of olive oil per everyone's suggestions, and I think I would use even less next time. With a couple tweeks for personal taste, I will definitely make this again!

Loved this chicken, but I also had to cut back on cooking time as it would have been overdone. I reduced the sauce on the stove for about 20-25 minutes, and covered the chicken with it - DELICIOUS! I also added the leftover sauce to my stir-fry and it was great. I will make this chicken again!

This was OK.  To be fair, I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken.  Maybe the flavor would have been different with a whole chicken.  It's just that no flavor really stood out.  Not something I'd make again.

I was hopeful for this recipe with all of the awesome ingredients, but it just didn't have enough oomph for me. Wish more of the flavors had cooked into the chicken. It wasn't terrible, but I won't be making this one again.

Reasonable flavour, but 8 hours is to long to cook a bird the breast was so dry they were inedible. Will try again much less cooking time (2 hrs)

The flavor was great but the chicken was very dry. I ended up shredding the chicken, thickening the sauce slightly, and making sandwiches.

This was the most delicious chicken I ever had.  I cooked it for 4 hours on high and when it was done the meat literally fell off the bone.  My DH loved it and so did my kids.  It was delicious.  Thank you.

My husband and I did not care for the flavor of this chicken.  Although we like all of the ingredients separately, the combination tasted strange to us.  We both agreed that with so many wonderful ways to cook chicken, we would not make this one again.

My family loved this.  I made a sauce out of some of the extra liquid and put it on rice.  Excellent recipe and easy.

The chicken was a little dry.  Other than that it was easy to make and delicious.

It was easy enough to make, but the flavor just didn't impress me.  It was just kind of odd.  Probably will not make again.

This was okay but the chicken turned out really dry which is weird for a crock pot recipe.

This is a great recipe. Have never made chicken in a crock pot before and was a little skeptical about it but this is so wonderful. My picky hubby even loved it and he's kinda hard to cook for. The chicken turned out perfect. Thank you so much for sharing this terrific recipe.

I don't know, maybe it was the quality of the chicken, but I did not like this at all.  I think the sauce was fine, but I think I'm going to start eating organic chicken because lately the other stuff tastes horrible.  I couldn't eat this dish.

5 *'s because this a a good tasting (not as a bland as most)crock pot recipe.  Of course,if it was an oven recipe you would expect more flavor.  However, there are ways to add more flavor, such as adding black pepper and red pepper (thanks wattyz for that suggestion) and to all the others who recommended less oil.  I added more of a kick by using HOT sesame oil, instead of regular sesame oil.  Be creative, there is also Ginger flavored sesame oil.

We LOVED this chicken.  Even my picky 9 year old loved it and had seconds!  The meat has an amazing flavor and it just falls off the bone.  A++++

This recipe was so easy and it tasted delicious.  The meat was tender and juicy.  I used the leftover sauce to add flavor to my jasmine rice.  It was a big hit with my husband.  He has requested that I do not loose this recipe.

Interesting flavors, but it is a bit oily.  Wasn't bad, but probably won't make again.

This chicken was soooo yummy!! I can't quite explain the melding of the flavors, but I can say that anyone who make this will not be disappointed. I made it with a green slsad and crusty bread with butter and it was a hit. My hubby, who only eats dark meat, encroached on my white meat and scarfed it all for lunch the next day before I could scavenge some for my lunch. :)

Followed the recipe exactly, but this turned out awful for me.  Tasteless, bland, mushy, greasy chicken.  Don't know what I could have done wrong.

would be great with all dark meat. I made with bone in chicken breasts. Meat just fell off the bone. Whole chicken would be great.

What a great receipe! Makes and excellent gravy/sauce too. I baked it at 375 for 2 hours and everyone raved. In a slow cooker or Croc Pot this would be even better.
