DELICIOUS. I'm not even a huge fan of fish, but we had some salmon in the fridge that needed to be used, and I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  The leeks really absorb and retain the flavor of the wine and butter, and the sauce was just the right amount of 'creamy'.  I used spinach pasta noodles instead of regular spaghetti, and served it with a side of garlic asparagus, and my boyfriend and I both loved it.  I can't believe nobody else has rated this recipe yet!  Will definitely be making it again.

Thank you Chef John!!!!   Absolutely scrumptious.   I will cut back on the lemon next time, I found it just a touch too sour.  So easy but very  decadent.
I watched the video just before making, it gave me great confidence. (I even donned an apron and sipped on wine whilst making).
Made it a second time and added a few other left over veggies and some capers.  This is an easy 30 minute or less meal.  

Addendum:  I made this again tonight.  Fabulous, other than I forgot my own advice to cut back on the lemon.  Halve the amount folks.    Yummy and easy recipe.  Again, thanks Chef John!!!

This was like eating in a fine dining restaurant. I couldn't believe it came out of my kitchen. I made it according to the recipe.

Update: I've made this a second time and have to say that I think it's key to use the creme fraiche and a good white wine that you enjoy drinking. Here in BC the creme fraiche is available in Save On Foods and is produced by Liberte. It's a little tough to find on the shelf though.

I love lemon and considered adding the whole lemon...glad I didn't because the flavor is just right as is.

I used basil rather than cilantro but think that fresh dill would work well too. I also think you could substitute shrimp and/or scallops for the salmon. Once again this was a delicious meal!

I would say this errs on the "too heavy" side, personally. I will definitely make it lighter next time. The flavors are really tasty and complex, though. The Dijon is a must. I don't usually really like cilantro, but I thought it worked well in this dish. As far as the amount of pasta suggested, I believe this means to call for "8 ounces" or "1/2 package," not "half of an 8oz pkg." You will probably have leftovers if you make this for 2.

Delicious and super easy! Make sure to cut back on the lemon just a tad! No creme fraiche, but used heavy creme instead, next time i'll find creme fraiche and try that but without = still delicious.

Very Tasty. I didn't have creme fraiche, used a non dairy sour creme and a little non dairy cremer. It came at great. I also use mini shell pasta. I would highly recommend this recipe and don't be afraid to make it your own.

I too found it a bit too sour.  Wish I'd read the previous reviews!  Will make again with a bit less lemon.

Incredible.  A few thoughts,

1.  Make sure to use creme fraiche. 
2. Do not skip on Tarragon-Dijon. I used 1 Tsp. Dijon + 1 Tsp. Minced tarragon. It worked very well.

I liked this - it was a basic creamy sauce for noodles with salmon, nothing super special but I liked the addition of the mustard. Not everyone in my family liked the wine/lemon flavor, some thought it was too much but I was good with it. I did add capers because I think they always go with salmon.

I really loved this! In fact, I'm eating the leftovers for lunch today and it reheats very well!I read the reviews, but got so excited about trying this that I forgot to decrease the lemon juice. It was a bit sour so I added maybe up to 1/4 cup of heavy cream and it worked to take the sour taste out. I also cut my salmon into bite sized pieces before cooking to make sure the salmon cooked at the same time. As always, Chef John gave us another winner!

This is pretty yummy.  It's quick and easy.  This can be served for week night dinner, but  it's elegant enough for nice weekend dinner with guests.

I used fat-free sour creme instead of the creme fraiche and it turned out great. I just had to thin the sauce with skim milk so it flowed nicely.

Deeeelicious. Was looking for a Tilapia recipe, didn't like what I saw  and then I found this. Fantastic. The leek and fish took on the blend of flavours perfectly. Can't wait to try it with salmon. Will definitely add this to the menu for dinner parties. Thanks Chef John!

We thought this was really good!  I used capellini because that's what I had on hand.  I had to add fresh tarragon to the Dijon because I didn't have that style of mustard.  Otherwise, this was a perfect dish.  Next time I'll make sure to use a sturdier pasta (spaghetti) and make Chef John's Creme Fraiche (delicious recipe).  This will be repeated for sure!  Thank you for this recipe!

Loved, loved, loved this!  I added a touch of garlic and some asparagus, and I used penne instead of spaghetti.  Next time I think I will add less lemon juice, it was a bit too tangy.  Delish!

Made it last night, and it really helped watching the video. Such a great, delicate balance of flavor. Go with the creme fraiche, it adds a tanginess you can't get with heavy cream. If you can't get it in the store, make your own a day ahead. Trust me, it really brings it all together. I will use this recipe many times

Great recipe. The key things to modify for those who failed (too runny, to sour, etc) is to not over do creme Fraiche and lemon juice. I ended up using just half of the recommended amount (after reading the bad reviews)  and modify at the end to suit my taste and style. It comes out fantastically every single time. Highly recommended.

I thought the flavors were great. I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the Creme fraiche and I need to pay better attention when I’m buying leeks and I left off the cilantro. I read that Greek yogurt can be heated but at a low temp and it worked just fine.

I made this dish for dinner tonight and I was blown away by how delicious it was! I did use canned salmon because I had it on hand, and I omitted the cilantro. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely be making this again and will likely double it next time. Thanks for sharing it!

This one is really tasty and wasn't nearly as difficult as I was afraid of. I did double it since it was for three people and I could probably have added even more salmon. Probably would have tasted good with shrimp too, so I may have to try that next time.

I thought this was a good flavorful recipe, but the sauce was too thick for me. The next time I make it I will add some of the pasta water to the sauce mixture before adding the pasta.  I also used sour cream (with a 1/2 tsp of sugar)  instead of creme fraiche, which made it a little more tart that I was expecting, but it was still quite good.

Delicious (as most of chef John's recipes are). I know they say it's not a perfect sub but had to use sour cream instead of creme fraiche and still tasted great. Also used honey Dijon mustard and added dry tarragon. Doubled the spaghetti, wine and the salmon because I bought too much salmon and felt there was plenty of sauce.

My wife loves this dish. I buy a few packages of vacuum packed smoked salmon and keep it on hand for this dish. The smoked salmon brings a bit more flavor and I also use about 12 ozs. The only problem is I’ve got to drive 6 miles to get cream fraiche. Thanks Chef John!

My entire family LOVED this recipe! I added broccoli for color and dill because we aren't fans of cilantro,  but the amount of lemon,  and the use of creme fraiche made the meal SUPERB! Thank you again Chef John!

We made the home made crème fraiche as per CJ. That was then used to make this superb recipe. One of our favorites.

I should have known being a Chef John recipe that I should have stayed away...his recipes are always disasters///but this sounded interesting. Thank God I didn't waste any slamon on this, just made the pasta. It was bland, the flavors clashed, and it ended up in the trash. Stay away from this one.

This is a winner.  Even with previously frozen wild salmon during the months when fresh is not available.  With fresh, it is truly sublime.  A perfect early summer dish, when fresh wild salmon starts to become available.

I was trapped at home during the blizzard a la Jonas.  All takeout spots surrounding me were closed! So I was forced to cook.  Luckily I had all these ingredients in my fridge.  The only thing I was missing was creme fraiche.  But no worries, sour cream was used and created an equally delicious dish.  Super simple and yummy.  Used maybe 8 ounces of salmon instead of 6 so the ratio of pasta to salmon was 1 to 1.  JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT

This is very good.  I took the hint that others gave about it being too sour.  I didn't have creme fraiche so I substituted sour cream.  Since sour cream is more sour than creme fraiche, I omitted the lemon juice altogether.  I also added a sprinkle of tarragon because I only had regular dijon mustard.  My family loved it.

AMAZING! Thank you, Chef John, for such a wonderful recipe! Followed the recipe almost exactly but did cut the cilantro to about a 1/4 cup. Also, the salmon we had had skin on it so rather than try to remove the skin from the raw fish which I find difficult, we cooked the salmon on the grill and then added it to the sauce after it was done cooking. I also only had dijon mustard (not tarragon dijon) and that worked great. Will definitely be making this again. Still can't believe how good this was.

It was fine for me, but my husband said it too sour. Plus I prefer  more of sause on my spaghetti. I won't cook it again, unless I can use a cup of single cream instead of cream fraiche and less of lemon juice which i can sprinkle over afterwards.

Really liked the results. I had smoked salmon that had to be used and only had angel hair spaghetti but it worked very well!  Used 1/2 of the lemon for juice - great, the cayenne gave it a bit of pzazz, maybe I got carried away?

Very good recipe. Followed recommendation to use less lemon.  Also substituted leftover baked salmon for fresh and plain greek yogurt for creme fraiche. Will definitely make this again.

I found this recipe to be excellent in flavor. I only wish it was less sinful in the amount of fat being used. But if there was a recipe to achieve this then there would be less flavor. Loved this recipe so much it would be one I would cook for guests; the top of my recipe list.
