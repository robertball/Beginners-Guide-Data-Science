Simple and straight forward with excellent flavor. Made as written and grilled them as the recipe submitter mentioned. If using the frozen ground turkey in the tube I have a tip for you. Even when thawed it holds a lot more moisture than fresh ground turkey so when using that the patties are too soft to go on the grill. Stick them on a paper plate and pop them in the freezer for 20 minutes and they will stay together perfectly for you. This is a great recipe and one I recommend.

We had half a pound of ground hot Italian sausage (instead of chorizo) and I used olive oil (instead of buttery spread). Everything else was the same down to cooking time. I would definitely make this again. Iâ€™m excited for leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Excellent turkey burger, I used wild boar chorizo and they were absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to make them again,
