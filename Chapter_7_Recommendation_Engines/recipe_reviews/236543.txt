I was hesitant to try this with only one review, but I really enjoyed it!

This was incredibly tasty!! I altered the recipe by adding 5 gloves of garlic, and 3 tsp of cilantro. I didn't have French onion soup but added about 3 cups of water to a pouch of dried onion soup mix. The fam LOVED IT, even the picky teenager :)

This was absolutely delicious. I used my Cajun seasoning and the Webbers New Orleans seasoning for a kick. It reminds me of etoufee  but was absolutely wonderful. I use mostly green onions because I forgot to buy a white one. I also used red bell pepper in addition to the green because I forgot to buy that too. But overall the dish was great.

This was delicious. Rice needs to be cooked first or time to bake is much longer than stated. I also added one tablespoon of Old Bay Shrimp seasoning to kick up the spice a bit. My husband loved it.

We love this.  I changed it slightly by adding a little Cajun seasoning and cutting the rice in half.

I made no changes but if I make it again I'll use at least 1/2 cup less rice.

Really great recipe!  Reheats nicely for a work week. I added a bit of Old Bay along with the shrimp. Tasty and easy!

I made it exactly according to the instructions. It was easy, quick and delicious! I was unsure about the rice, so I did cook the rice first and I think that was the correct way to do it. My husband loved it - will definitely be making this again!
