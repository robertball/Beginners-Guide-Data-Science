Heya Folks...this is my recipe (courtesy of Mary Schmidt over 10 years ago!) and 2 corrections are needed that were not mentioned.  1. As this concoction boils, I skim off any foam that forms on the top. 2. I add only the zest of 1 orange, not the flesh of the orange itself.

This was my first time making sauce from scratch, and the end product was fantastic! I did indeed snitch bites from the fridge.

Delicious!  Added a tbs. of organic honey to cooked mixture.  Still tart but not as tart.  Will definitely make this again.
