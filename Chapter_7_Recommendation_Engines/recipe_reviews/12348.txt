I don't like egg custard pie, and was only making it as a Valentine's Day gift for the boyfriend (who specifically requested it).  I don't know if I'm just too dumb to make this recipe correctly (I don't think I am), but it was an absolute disaster from the time I turned on the mixer.  First of all, I didn't know what speed to use.  I used a KitchenAid mixer with the wire whisk attachment, and tried to ascertain from its directions what speed to use (based on other, similar recipes), but that was not helpful. The mixture looked too thin in the beginning, so I tried mixing it at a higher speed.  Then the butter never mixed in (it floated on the top in clumps), and finally I ended up with a bunch of little wads of . . . butter?  egg? floating on the top of the liquid.  When I took it out of the oven, it looked like an oil slick--the top moved when I tilted the pan.  I have obviously done something wrong, because everyone else who rated this recipe thinks it's perfect.

Delicious! This recipe has been in my family for many generations and it's a no-fail recipe but I think the key is to use a BLENDER, not a mixer.  It will turn out perfect every time.

We made this pie for Mother's Day and my mom enjoyed it. We added a bit of cinnamon along with the nutmeg and she said it had a creme brulee flavor. Thank you for a nice recipe that is very easy to make.

This is a great basic recipe for a quick dessert, especially when lemon or orange zest and juice is added. Or,  by leaving out the sugar and adding savoury ingredients, it makes an excellent pastryless quiche.

This is great recipe because it involves only five minutes for preparation.  Easy to make and delicious!  I add just a dash of salt to neutralize the sweetness.

Wonderful!!! Family members BEG me to bring this one to "get-togethers."  This recipe is exactly like the one my great-grandmother used to make!  And it's so easy!  Sometimes I do change it up a bit by sprinkling a little cinnamon on top, or a little nutmeg.  But it's perfect as is!! I would give it 10 stars if I could.

Very good.  Egg custard is my favorite dessert. I sometimes add another egg yolk to the ingredients and cook it in a water bath to improve the texture.

The taste was ok, but the consistency left something to be desired.  I have made egg custard many times, and every recipe I know uses scalded milk and a pie shell.  This recipe seemed simple so I thought I would give it a try.  The body of the custard was gooey, almost lumpy and there was excess liquid around the outside of it.  The taste was pretty good, although I think the evaporated milk covered up that good egg flavor somewhat.  I think I'll just stick to my grandmother's old fashioned egg custard recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I made sure to blend all the ingredients in a blender for a more consistent mix as was suggested by another review.  My husband also really enjoyed this custard pie and that's saying something since he is a very skilled cook and has excellent taste :)

Very simple and delicious.  We ate half of it while it was still warm.  Looking forward to devouring the rest chilled. I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg togive it a bit more depth.

This pie is so amazing. My Grandmother use to make this before she passed. Even though I can't get close to perfecting it like her I do my best and it brings back memories. I add a little nutmeg for taste.

This reminds me of the egg custard that my grandmother used to make. Very tasty and easy to make. I saw where some people complained that the butter never mixed in. The butter is for the pie pan to assure that it does not stick not mixed in the recipe.

In following the directions, please note that the flour and butter are not to be blended with the custard mix but used in the pie dish. The directions don't specify.

This literally took me five minutes to put together.  Everything in my Vitamix, blended for 30 seconds on high, and poured into the prepared pan.  I did sub buttermilk for the evaporated (as I had some on hand that needed to be used up).  I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top before baking.  I needed to bake mine more like 40 minutes.  It will still look like it's bubbling, but it sets up as it cools.  Delicious topped with some fresh berries and a dollop of whip cream!  Yum!

I made this pie for unexpected company b/c it was so quick to put together with things I had on hand.  I was very pleased with the results.  In no time, the whole pie was gone!!  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is presentation.  It is not a beautiful pie, but once you bite into it that really doesn't matter.

This is not close to the traditional southern egg custard pie.  I did add nutmeg to mine and baked it in a pie crust.  It has a good texture and nice taste.  It is darker than a creamy egg custard.  Once again, this is not the traditional egg custard but worth a try!

The recipe was pretty easy to follow. However, I did make a few alterations. First, instead of putting the butter directly in, I melted it first. Secondly, I used gluten free all purpose flour instead of wheat flour. Lastly, I also added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of orange peel.

Overall, it was a quick and easy recipe that made for a good dessert.

Made this recipe exactly as written.  It is way too sweet with a cup of sugar.  I also ended up with the "oil slick" on the surface of the baked pie.  If I were to make it again, I would cut back on the sugar and omit the 3 tablespoons of butter.

I loved it, came out perfectly. Reminds me of my Grandmother's pie, but lacks something. I think it is the love, or the 50+ years since I ate it.

Made this pie for my Dad for Easter. He loves custard pies but is not crazy about crust. He really liked it. I will definitely make it for him again.

I absolutely love making this! I hear some people are having problems with the butter separating. I melt the butter and mix it with the sugar and flour before-hand, and then strain the mixture before putting it into the pie pan. I also like to add cinnamon and/or orange peel to the mixture depending on what people like. Another thing you can do is bake it in a water bath to achieve a different texture and help it set up faster, although it's not necessary

I decided to use a crust for this and it turned out horribly.  It wouldn't set properly at all and is still very runny in the middle even though I cooked it a bit longer to see if it would.  I'll go back to recipes where the milk is boiled.

I converted this to a diabetic recipe substituting stevia for white sugar and adding  1/2 cup of cocount to mix. My husband, being a diabetic and very sensitive to carbohydrates  raved about this pie  and it didn't affect his blood sugar as with a traditional pie crust. This is bookmarked in my all recipes box.

It does taste pretty good. Mine actually turned out exactly like the other woman who was making it for her boyfriend's custard turned out. It was quite wobbly coming out of the oven. But after letting it cool a bit it solidified. I added some nutmeg and cinnamon on top!

Tried this receipe but changed a couple things I added diced strawberries and I scarlded my milk which helped to give it a more thicker texture. The batter is watery but adding all purpose flour also helps thicken mixture.

I have made this twice in as many weeks. My husbands friend had half of the first pie and hinted for another taste! I was gobsmacked at how easy and delicious this is. I followed the recipe slavishly much to everyone's delight! Thank you Donna!!!

I wasn't keen on the texture and it was way to sweet for me.  But I did like the ease of the recipe.  However I think the instructions were to simplistic for beginning cooks.  I melted my butter but let it cool and mixed the flour in the sugar before adding.

Hmmm...no, not really a true egg custard.  Totally ignore the picture with the recipe.  

Bakes up a bit darker in color (almost more like a pumpkin pie color)  and has a more caramelized flavor and a more pudding-like texture than a custard.  Gets more granular in texture as it cools...and the butter starts to separate out.  Still sorta tasty...but best eaten without looking at it, lol.

Very simple to prepare (5 minutes!) but it tastes only good, but great -- and presentation-wise, definitely not for company.

I LOVE EGG CUSTARD PIE! Since I'm really just a beginner in cooking and everything else that comes with it, I'm always looking for something as simple as this to make. This really comes in handy too since I love the pie but never learned how to make it. Since it seems so simple, I'll be making it very soon. Thanks for sharing!!
