This was a wonderfully refreshing, less sweet, dessert.  Kids and hubby loved it.  I adjusted the amount of simple syrup based on the sweetness of the strawberries.  I also served it with a dollop of whipped cream on top.  Again, not too sweet . . .  Very light and something I will definitely make again.

I loved this! I couldn't help myself and I ate it as soon as I was done blending it. I'm sure it would be even better had I chilled it. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I used 1 Tbs Agave syrup instead of the 2Tbs simple syrup, and it was perfect. Refreshing and not overly sweet. We had it before dinner, but it would be great after dinner too.

Simply delicious!!
I substituted low-fat sour cream for the yogurt. The texture was awesome.

Yummy.  I had frozen strawberries and plums from my summer harvest and used coconut milk, mango juice and bottled lemon juice.  I didn't measure just blended until it reached the consistency I wanted.  Delicious!

Really enjoyed this, but if I were to make it again, I'd exclude the lemon juice. ( I might've just used an excessively large lemon) It was very tart.
