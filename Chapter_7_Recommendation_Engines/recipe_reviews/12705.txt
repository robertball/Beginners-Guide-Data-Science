I was intrigued by the odd combination of ingredients in this recipe, and though skeptical, the reviews convinced me to try it.  I'm glad I did - the results were surprisingly tasty!  I omitted the boiled eggs (I'm not a fan) and chilled it overnight as recommended.  I served the salad over baby spinach dressed lightly with olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Awesome!  I would never have thought to combine these ingredients, but I will definitely make this again.

The reviews for this are so good, I'm inclined to think I got the wrong kind of Creamy Italian Dressing.

Here's what happened: since I was making this for just my husband and me, I cut the recipe in half, counting on leftovers. I confess I've never sliced cauliflower before and thus wound up with large slices of 2 dimensional tree-looking pieces and a bunch of crumbs. Next time I'd slice each of the smaller "flowers". 

I happened to have frozen shrimp, which I soaked in water until it was defrosted. Worked perfectly. I also mixed the mayo and salad dressing separately, as directed. This was when a "kitchen instinct" told me to taste the mayo/dressing mix with a bit of the salad before I poured it all in. And that's when I knew it wasn't going to work. 

The sharp flavor of the Italian dressing (creamy though it was) was too overwhelming for the other flavors to come through. So I switched gears and used Ranch dressing (without mixing it with mayo). It's good enough to eat, but not what I'd bring to a pot luck. It would help if the author specified the brand of dressing, since I'm not the only one to be put off by it. It's very possible I missed a great salad here... the ingredients are healthy and look pretty together. But the dressing — at least my version of it — would have ruined this for me.

This recipe is a hit. I made it for the first time, took it to a church fellowship, they loved it. I had to make another batch to keep at home. It's really very good. It is best to make it the day before as suggested.

Okay, but it needs a more flavorful dressing than the bottled one I used.  Also, too much green onion for my taste.  I liked the combination of salad ingredients, but I need a good salad dressing recipe to go with this instead of using a bottled one.

This is a fantastic recipe: It has so much texture and flavor.  I made this recipe yesterday for a large gathering, and I was repeatedly complimented on this recipe as well as asked for the recipe. I referred those individuals to allrecipes.com! Thanks, Amy!

A quick easy recipe to make when unexpected guests stop by on a hot summer day.  You can stretch how many the recipe will feed by serving the salad over a bed of lettuce.  Add some crusty bread and you have a light summer dinner.

I took this to a family potluck. All the women liked it but not many of the men. It only chilled in the fridge for an hour or so before serving. It probably would have tasted even better if it was refrigerated over night. I also used a fat free salad dressing which tasted pretty good still. I will try this recipe again by chopping the cauliflower smaller, using regular dressing and refridgerating over night.

For this family, it was neither distasteful, nor outstanding.  Everyone ate it, including my husband and 7 & 9 year old girls.  I used Marie's Creamy Italian Garlic for the dressing choice.  The only switch I made was using chives because I didn't have green onions.  The whole dish was a nice change and had some lovely flavours, but I just did not consider it a *WOW* 5 Star kind of dish and will more then likely not be making it again.

I wasnt real crazy about this.  I did change the recipe a little however.  The olives didnt appeal to me, so I left those out. I also added a small amount of chopped celery and some frozen green peas.  It wasnt bad, and my Mother liked it quite a bit and ended up taking the majority of the bowl home.  A little bland.

This was ok.  It was edible, but for me, it wasn't a GREAT recipe.  It wasn't bland, like some have said, it just didn't do it for me, flavor-wise.  I probably won't make this again.

This is a great recipe. I prepared it as a main dish, so I used a small head of cauliflower and doubled the eggs and the shrimp. My husband is not a huge cauliflower fan, but he ate this up and raved about it. I will definitely make it again.

This is my new favorite salad recipe. My husband hates cauliflower but couldn’t stop eating this!  It’s a healthy alternative potato salad especially if you’re watching your carbs.    I didn’t have Italian dressing so used a couple tablespoons of homemade balsamic vinaigrette and left out the olives and pimiento because it was too late to go to the store. I also used half mayo and half Greek yogurt.  Sooo yummy!
