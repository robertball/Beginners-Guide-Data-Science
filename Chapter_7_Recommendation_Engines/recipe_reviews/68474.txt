Now this stuff is awesome! I have always been a white chocolate fan. I also love cayenne pepper. I never would have dreamed of ever having the two together. I can't say enough good about it. Best hot chocolate I ever had! Beware though! Do not drink too much! This will do to you the same as eating too much candy will do to you. You stomach will not feel well, trust me. You can have too much of a good thing. Still 5 stars for sure! Emailing this one all over the place!

This was nice twist on regular hot chocolate. I didn't have any cayenne papper on hand so I substituted chili powder instead and it was still pretty good. You may want to strain it before you drink it if you don't like little bits of floating spices.

Cayanne Pepper in white hot chocolate?  I said no way.  But then I tasted it.  YES WAY!  Its amazing! You can not taste it, only feel the warmth and spicyness. I added more.  Everyone who tasted it couldn't get enough and no one could tell what the secret ingredient was- although they knew it was there.  I made four batches last night and can't wait to make more! Add a little aged rum and WOW (look for a # on the bottle or "anejo" for aged rum).  To the person who used Chilli powder- that's not even close.  Cayanne give heat, not flavor. Chilli peppers do the opposite.  I bet with Chilli it was gross.  You should try it again with Cayenne, you'll love it.

Yum! I have been waiting to try this and this morning it was finally cold enough! The pepper freaked me out a little but once I tasted it...no more! On the reheat I did add about a tsp of vanilla which made it even more tasty. Thanks!

My new favorite hot chocolate.  I'm afraid to add the egg, but it's still great without it.  If you want to go hotter, just add more pepper and cinnamon.  Fantastic.

mmmm, yummy. I think the egg overpowers the drink a little, but the cayenne pepper definitely adds a kick and warms your throat quickly. Delicious!

This was very good.  I've been wanting to make this recipe for a long time, and finally did today- it's freezing outside and there is snow everywhere.  A good day to stay inside, be cozy and drink hot chocolate.  This recipe took a little time to make- melting the chocolate, adding the egg, then the milk and heating it slowly.  But it's worth it.  I used a Pyrex bowl on top of a pan of simmering water and did the whole recipe in the bowl.  My husband was on hand to help me make this, and I was glad when I got to the adding milk to egg part.  Two pairs of hands are helpful there.  I only added a dash of cayenne.  The whole family enjoyed this- the babies had thiers with a candy cane stirrer.

Pretty good. I think it's just a little too eggy for me, though. It's got a oldfashioned custard taste to it.

Wow.  I cut down the amount of cayenne just a bit because my family is a little wimpy about that kind of heat, but if you like spicy, go for it!  Other than that I suggest making this EXACTLY as directed!  Do not leave out the eggs, do not change a thing.  The combination of flavors is exquisite! It's hands-down the most delicious hot chocolate I have ever tasted, and my family agrees!  A new Christmas morning tradition has been born!

Great beverage.  Love the effect of the cayenne pepper.  I added a shot of espresso to it to see how it would be as more of a white mocha.  Definitely worth trying out.

This was soooo good. I also didn't use the egg because it scared me, but it is still AMAZING without it. I don't think I used enough cayenne, though, so next time, I won't eyeball it. I also didn't do well with the cinnamon garnish, so I think next time, I'll just use a cinnamon stick. And I only had red chocolate melts on hand from valentines day, so not only is it spicy, but it's red. Love it.

Only my 2nd ever review, but I HAD to offer my opinion of this. Incredibly delicious! Hot OR cold. For me, the egg is absolutely neccesary! I didn't have cayenne so I added a T. or 2 of DiSarrono Amaretto....OH MY!!!!

We really liked this. It was different than our normal boring "brown" hot chocolate. The amount of spice was great. I topped ours with a liitle whip cream sprinkled with nutmeg. It was great. Thanks!

I do not like hot chocolate, so I thought I would like it better if I made it myself and it was a different flavor.  I ended up using what I had on hand.  I used skim milk, added almost an ounce more of white chocolate, and I didn't have any cayenne pepper.  But instead I added some peppermint extract, which gave it a really good flavor.  I was very pleased with it.  And as someone who doesn't like hot chocolate, I'd make it again.  And I think I'd switch out the white chocolate with all sorts of various chocolates.  I think it was a pretty good starting point.

A great twist on hot chocolate. I enjoyed this beverage at a party & had to have it alongside my dessert for Christmas. Needless to say, it was a hit! I made this for 7 servings & next time I'll use less cayenne pepper & egg. It's good as a cold beverage too!!

Just not for our taste. Too spicy, too sweet (I added some vanilla extract, as suggested by some reviewers - maybe I shouldn't have had). Interesting combination of flavors, though.

Good. Reminded me of hot egg nog though, in a good way.  I am used to starbucks white hot chocolate, and they do not use egg, so it was different than expected, but still yummy.  I think I will try it w/o the egg next time.

This is the best hot chocolate you'll find! It has Very strong flavors though. Next time I'll add a little more milk to dilute it. I used Ghirardelli White Chocolate for Baking. A must try! You'll love it.

This was pretty good.  I used white chocolate chips that one would put in cookies--which I think was why this turned out really really sweet--too sugary.  Perhaps white chocolate baking squares would have been best. I also added a touch of peppermint schnapps which added a minty warm twist!

This hot chocolate is awesome!! I love white chocolate and the cayenne just adds that kick.  I will definately be making this again and won't change a thing.  Don't leave out the egg, it really makes a difference.

This is delicious. My kids love white chocolate and although they enjoyed this I'll be reducing or omitting the cayenne pepper next time at their request. I also increased the amount of white chocolate.

Could not recommend enough!!!! Very delicious, but you can leave out the spices - they are a bit too powerful unless you love spicy food. You can also use milk chocolate instead of white, as I did once.

I didn't really like this recipe. It had to much cinnamon. I thought it was going to be similar to the Dunkin' Donuts white hot chocolate. And with the egg it just wasn't that good. Nice try though. If you are going to use this recipe and you want white hot chocolate, do not use the cinnamon or pepper.

This recipe was amazingly yummy!! I made it for myself and my daughter. We both LOVED it. We had some leftover and heated it up the next day. It was still super good! I highly recommend.

Didn't use cayenne pepper, and only had 2 cups of milk (equal parts evaporated milk and water), with the original amounts of the rest of the ingredients, and it turned out really nice!! My dad, who doesn't like milk, LOVED it.

This recipe came out very well. I did not add the pepper when I made the this. My boyfriend enjoyed it very much. From how similar the ingredients are, I am thinking of making white chocolate ice cream sometime.

I love this recipe! I like the chocolate flavor but it could be a bit thicker; I added some caramel I made earlier today by putting sweetened condensed milk in boiling water for 2 hours. I could barely taste the caramel. Overall I think you could take out the half cup of milk and add 1/2 cup of cream.

Add a little Chambord to this to add a litle raspberry flavor. Then top with homemade whip cream and everyone will love this drink even more.

My kids liked it! I added half of the cayenne pepper for their sake.
