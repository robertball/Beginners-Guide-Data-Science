I added 1 10oz pkg of frozen spinach, some cayenne pepper, and chilli powder to give it an extra kick. I also used my food processor instead of my mixer for a smoother finish. I followed cehinksman's advice and cranked the over to 350 for 35. I'll definitely do this one again.

To this recipe I added 1 large clove of garlic and it was delicious!  Loved by all.  I did have to bake it for about 35 minutes though at 350oF before is started to brown on the edges.

I made this and the plate was licked clean by picky middle aged women. A definite crowd pleaser.

A friend made this for me years ago and I loved it!  Definitely add 1T fresh garlic though!
