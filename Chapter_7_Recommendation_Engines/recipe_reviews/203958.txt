Made these for a bbq and were a big hit.  I tripled the recipe and used a bag of precut granny smith (tart) apples.  The white chocolate was difficult to break up, I think that I should've spread it even thinner.

These taste really good but are tedious to make.  I ended up not doing the white bark and just drizzled it over the chocolate dipped apple slices at the end to spend up the process. I needed to let my apple slices dry just a bit before dipping since they were juicy and the chocolate was seizing up from the juice.   My kids loved this special treat.
