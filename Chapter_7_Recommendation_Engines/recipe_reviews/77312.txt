I made this cake for some friends. They loved it! The only suggestion that i can make is to put in in the fridge for an hour before serving, otherwise it is very messy. I will be making this again on thanksgiving.

This was too sweet for us, and I had a hard time spreading out the chocolate layer.

This is the best dessert I have ever tasted. The mocha/chocolate/cream cheese flavor is out of this world. All the ingredients blend together beautifully. It makes a very large dessert, I thought it would be too much, but the family devoured it. I was sad that there was only a little bit left to bring home. This is a definte keeper. Will make again and again. Thank you for sharing.

I only had 9 inch pans, so I had to break my cake up into pieces to make the layers. It worked ok but the cake was really soggy. The flavor was out of this world though!

This was pretty yummy.  I dusted the top with confectioner's sugar and added fresh raspberries on top too for a pretty presentation.  I only gave it 4 stars because I'm just not a fan of soggy cake.  The fillings were awesome though...I can taste the espresso sauce on top of ice cream.  The whipped cream filling could be used in a chocolate cookie crust pie with the espresso sauce as topping.  Really really yummy.  I would suggest letting it sit a day too so everything is nice and cold and the flavors have time to meld.  We ate it a couple hours after I made it and it was good, but for breakfast the next day it was much better.  :)
