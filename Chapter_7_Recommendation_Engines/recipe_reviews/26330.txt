The flavor and texture was just OK. I made it with strawberry yogurt, homemade graham cracker crust and Splenda. Also pureed fresh strawberries, sweetened with more Splenda and a dash of Grand Marnier, and served on the side as a fresh compote-type sauce (see picture) which helped the presentation. ALTHOUGH I KNOW THIS RECIPE DOESN'T CLAIM TO BE NY STYLE CHEESECAKE, I found it to be nothing more than a wannabe. So sorry, but it's hard to get all excited about this one. A Jello cheesecake mix scores higher for flavor and texture. I had expected a whole lot more from reading previous reviews. I found its main virtue to be that it's easy, although truthfully not all that much easier than making the real thing. I won't be making this again because to me, I'd rather spend the very little extra time to make the real thing which always yields spectacular results, even when substituting Splenda for the sugar. This dessert was so aggressively mediocre that we didn't eat anymore after trying our first slice - we ate the strawberry coulis over fruit salad, since that part was wonderful, but the rest got thrown out. To make a long story short, it's passable, at best.

Perfect!!  I made my own crust and used blueberry yogurt.  I also used a can of blueberries to make my own topping (there is usually a recipe for pie filling on the back of the label!) - avoid the artifical colors, etc.. that are usually in canned pie filling!  This baked perfectly!!  Tastes perfect too!!  This is the ONLY cheesecake recipe to use!  I will try it with more sugar and 1/2 cup pumpkin puree for Thanksgiving to experiment!   *** 9/18/2007 - - Great 2nd time!!  This time I used strawberry yogurt and strawberry extract!!

Made this with cherry-vanilla yogurt - yum!  Yes, as one reviewer noted, you can probably make a better cheesecake otherwise.  However, it doesn't get much easier than this, the use of yogurt to flavor it is quite clever, and it tastes pretty darn good!  Every one of our guests requested a copy of the recipe -- that's a five-star recipe for you!

The BEST I've had in a long while.  My family keeps begging me to make it again.  I used Splenda rather than sugar and reduced the calories even more.  Wish I could rate it better than 5 stars!

Yum.  I used Splenda, low sugar mixed berry yogurt and a pre-made Oreo crust.  Thanks for the almost guilt free recipe!

So far the filling tastes great...not done baking yet. I increased the sugar to 1 cup since I had to use plain yogurt. I have been looking for a plain cheesecake recipe that did not have sour cream (since I was out) in the recipe. This is going to be used as a layer in a "S'mores" cake. I'm only concerned about the consistancy and will be freezing it before making the cake.

For a lower fat cheesecake, this is really good.  I used fat free yogurt, and it worked out great.

Well, I didn't have 2 packages of cream cheese, so my mother told me to add another container of yogurt in place. The yogurt seemed to really work with the eggs and now it's more of a souffle or pie; maybe even a cake. It smells delicious though.
We went on the wild side and decided to use a banilla (banana/vanilla) yogurt. It actually worked out extremely well.
I will use this recipe in the future. It's hard to find cheesecake recipes that use yogurt with cream cheese as it's main ingredients - which is the best way to make it.

What a great recipe!  I made a few changes and it turned out perfect =)  First I increased sugar to almost 1 cup.  Second instead of yogurt I used sour cream.  I buttered the pan very well (it gave the side edges a nice golden color) and baked it the full 40 minutes.  I'm making a blueberry sauce to drizzle on each slice. Turned out fantastic, I'll make this again for sure.

Fantastic. I used vanilla yogurt and a dash of nutmeg, to give it that 'vanilla bean' look. No, it's NOT 'authentic New York' LOL. It never said it was. But it's really, really good.

I cut the recipe in half and used nonfat cream cheese and regular lemon yogurt to make mini cheesecakes in a muffin pan and they turned out surprisingly well. They are strangely shiny on top and the texture and richness are, of course, not the same as traditional cheesecake, but they are close enough for someone desiring yummy cheesecake goodness with less guilt.

I made this for Valentine's Day. I used strawberry yogurt and put canned cherry pie filling on top. It was very good. Nice and moist unlike some cheesecake recipes.

The cheesecake was wonderful.  I used cherry vanilla yogurt.  My boyfriend loved it because it was moist (even tho I think I baked it on the long side) and I loved it because it was healthier!
