if you make a graham cracker crust (2 cups graham cracker,1/2 c powdered sugar, 1 stick melted butter)and press into a 11x 13 dish you will elimanate crust problems.  Also if you used egg whites only, they will beat up a lot quicker, about 10 min.

Well I thought this pie would be the main dessert for my Christmas dinner, but it didn't exactly turn out the way I had hoped it would.. first of all it took forever to get the filling beat up 15 minutes I really thought that was way to long then by time I got to filling in the pie crusts and all that jazz it was running over.. must have just been me I dunno but it was messy.. it still tastes good but its runny and it really shouldn't be..Well maybe better luck next time!!

The pie has a very good flavor, however I had difficulty with the filling running over.  I would suggest using a casserole dish and placing graham crackers in the bottom instead of using a graham cracker pie shell.  This dessert is very messy if you use the graham cracker pie shell.  This is also a dessert that has to be eaten within two days.  This is not a good pie to keep in the fridge for more than a few days.

Oh!    Readymade crusts are fine, but so much better if you put under the broiler till crispy (watch carefully!) Let them get back to room temp before filling. And, please, pay attention to the recipe. Room temp "softened butter", never melt it any at all.

I think someone forgot to list cream cheese as an ingredient to this recipe. My teenage daughter made this for a friends birthday party. It was runny and not very easy to eat. Although the girls were polite, if she would have made this for a fundraiser/bake sale, she would have been embarrassed.

To cut down on a messy pie, put the crushed pineapple in a strainer, a bit at a time, and mash out the juice.  You might want to use more pineapple in order to completely cover the pies.  Also, try adding a layer of sliced strawberries on top of pineapple. My family loves this pie.  MityMini

My husband's secretary gave us this recipe 20 years ago. We serve it at birthdays; it's that special. I make my own crust from a box of vanilla wafers/crushed and a stick of melted butter. Easy to do and so much better. (I keep the crust in the fridge until the filling is finished to firm it up.)

I make this very often and I've never had a problem with it being runny. YOU HAVE TO BEAT IT FOR at least 15 min, I beat mine for 20. And you must drain and squeeze out the crushed pineapple. The best way to do it is to put it in a dish towel and squeeze out all the juice. Assemble the pie and refrigerate over night. It's always a big hit.

I agree with other reviewers.  This pie looks great until you cut into it.  Then it is very messy.  I took it to two different dinners and was embarrassed to see how runny it turned out.  I don't know if it would be better to freeze it and then put out at the start of dinner so it was still quite cold when you serve it.  Other than not looking very nice when cut, the flavour is delicious.

I used to make this years ago, but I lost the recipe. You definitely need to beat the egg mixture the whole fifteen minutes. Several rafters said they added cream cheese, but then that makes taste like any other dessert. The filling in this recipe is what makes it so unique in flavor. Yum!
