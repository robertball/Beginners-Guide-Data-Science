The recipe didn't specify what type of cranberries; fresh or dried, I used fresh, the bread itself was very flavorful but the fresh cranberries made the bread extremely tart, everyone ate the bread but picked out the cranberries.  I plan to make this again using dried cranberries.  I also plan to chop the mandarin orange segments to make it less chunky.  I baked mine in a bundt pan and dusted it with powdered sugar.

I used 1 1/2 cups craisins, plumped first in the microwave, reduced sugar to about 1 1/3 cups, used navel orange segments instead of mandarin,  substituted 3 T. orange zest for the extract, and baked them in a minimuffin pan. They were wonderful!

This recipe is awesome. I have made it twice now and both times it came out perfect. I brought a loaf to work and my co-works loved it. I had several people insist I give them the recipe so they could make it right away. The only thing I changed was that because I had no orange extract...I substituted orange juice for the milk...I also left out a half cup of sugar (to make up for the sweetness of the orange juice). I also used craisens. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!!

I made this earlier this week and it was so yummy!! I made a couple of adjustments.  My aunt who is a master baker recommended I chop up the fresh cranberries to make them less tart (worked perfectly) and also used a whole orange (peel and all) in the food processor. The peel gave it extra flavor and a great substitute for orange extract.  Also, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream as that is all I had. I will definitely make this again.

This was fun & easy to make and turned out very yummy! FYI high altitude (I'm well over 5000ft) you'll want to bake for 55 minutes for a perfect turn out. :)

This bread was absolutely delicious - very moist, with a terrific flavor.  I substituted Craisins, which I first plumped in the microwave with a little water and patted dry.  Since Craisins are sweeter than fresh cranberries, I reduced the sugar in the recipe to 1-1/2 cups.  Definitely a "keeper!"  I can't wait to serve this bread on Christmas morning.

I was looking for an alternative to my Banana Nut Bread and this is it.  A tasty addition with the following changes:  1/2 tesp. baking soda, pinch of salt, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 med. naval orange, used all zest instead of extract, peeled and cut up to same size as dried cranberries and only used 1 cup of the cranberries, also 2 tesp. vanilla as I always double vanilla in all recipes and finally 1/2 cup of sour cream 'cause that's all I had.  Baked in two loaf pans for 50 mins. and it is totally awesome. Moist and delicious and one flavour doess not overpower any other.  It's wonderful!  This is in my recipe box with a star on it!!

Absolutely wonderful! Very moist. The only change to this recipe I made was to use orange juice instead of milk for extra flavor. And since I only own one 9x5 loaf pan, I decided I would try baking it all in one 8x8 baking dish. It looked like alot when I poured it all in, but it baked up perfectly without overspilling the pan. It took about 50 minutes in the 8x8 pan. This is a keeper.

O.M.G!!! You want talk about some good bread, THIS IS IT!!! It's a perfect combo of sweet orange and zesty cranberry. My husband has me making it for his lunches, he shares it with his buddies and everybody raves! The only change I made was to change out fresh cranberry for cranraisens because they are sweeter and not tart. I just put the cranraisens in a measuring cup, put hot water over the top of them, let them sit for about 10 minutes, drain them, squeeze the excess water out of them, and add to the recipie as it calls for it. The crans plump right up and are nice and sweet.

Delicious! Moist and flavorful...I used dried cranberries, rehydrated in orange juice; substituted OJ for the milk and used all vanilla instead of orange extract. Everyone loved it at Christmas dinner!

This is a wonderful recipe! I made a few modifications for a slightly healthier version without compromising the flavor. I substituted equal parts whole wheat bread flour for the all-purpose flour, used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, craisins instead of fresh which I soaked in OJ substituted for milk, and instead of butter I used coconut oil. Also added in some walnuts for a crunch. Super moist and delicious and just the right amount of sweet. Great with coffee/tea or an afternoon snack. This will be my go to recipe for now on.

I improvised a little bit with this recipe, and it turned out great!  I had fresh cranberries and mandarin oranges on hand, so I used those (cutting the cranberries in half, and the oranges into small pieces).  I also substituted orange flavored greek yogurt for the sour cream, and added about a half cup of white chocolate chips.  For the most part, the white chocolate chips melted and just about disappeared into the bread, but they gave it a really great flavor.  I didn't have any orange extract, so I just used some zest from one of my oranges.

Delicious. Moist and dense without being heavy. I wasn't sure about baking with canned oranges, but they broke down a little and added a great contrast. If you like these flavors, make this bread!

I cut this recipe back by half. The recipe did not specify which kind of cranberries I should use, I used dried. Instead of milk, I used orange juice and I increased the flour to a cup and a half for a HALVED RECIPE. The batter for this was incredibly moist even with the additional flour. I made muffins out of this recipe, I did get 12 regular sized muffins out of a halved recipe. This took 22 minutes to bake at 350* and even then, I'm not really happy with the end result. The muffins turned out incredibly spongy and really.......wet looking plus the texture is odd. I think maybe this recipe could have benefited from an additional quarter cup or half cup over what I had added. I don't know that I would try this again to find out.

This bread is wonderful.. I used a naval orange chopped up to equal one cup, used half oj half milk instead of all milk and orange zest instead of the extract!! A colorful tangy bread-we are all enjoying it! Also used orange flavored dried cranberries from trader joe's about 1.5 cups. added one cup of sugar since I didn't use the cranberries!

Made this for Thanksgiving day breakfast and two out of the three kids loved it. Used craisins plumped in the microwave with the juice from the oranges and reduced the sugar (per suggestions from other reviewers.)

I’m a guy in his mid 40’s.  I only cook at Thanksgiving and Christmas ( I enjoy it, but my wife is a fabulous cook!). I’ve made this bread three times this holiday season because it has been such a hit with the whole family.  I made it exactly as suggested- I’m not that creative to attempt to change it and the only negative reviews seem to be from people that altered the recipe.  Have fun and go for it- cheers!

I am a former professional baker, and this recipe is excellent! I made mini loaves for Christmas gifts and everyone loved it. I got 4 mini loaves per batch. I didn't have oranges so I substituted frozen orange juice concentrate. I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup brown sugar. Delish and perfect texture. Just made it again for New Year's.

GREAT recipe;  and easy too!   I didn't have orange extract, so I zested a navel orange and then I cut it into pieces and used that in place of the mandarins.  I also read that cranberries were too tart, so I used whole cranberry sauce instead.  It was wonderful!  Made this bread for coffee time at church, and it was a big hit!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious!  I followed another reviewer's advice and used craisins and I decreased the sugar and it was a HUGE hit with everyone!  One thing I noticed though, it is a lot better cold then it is warm.

I loved this recipe!!!  I love the sweet/tangy flavor combination. I did make changes, although I'm sure that it would have been very tasty as originally written.  I used 1 cup of chopped orange (as opposed to mandarin orange segments - wanted to use up old oranges), zested  2  of the oranges and used that instead of the orange extract (which I didn't have), and I used 1/2 c milk and 1/4 c of the juice from the oranges.  I made them in four  "mini" loaf pans and baked for about  25 - 30 minutes, until toothpick came out clean.  Oh, I also used REAL cranberries, not craisins.   I shared with friends who all RAVED wildly about this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper if you love sweet and tart flavorful breads!!

I used 2 cups of leftover cranberry relish (which is cranberries and whole oranges), instead of mandarin oranges, whole cranberries and orange oil. Added two handfuls of chopped walnuts. Turned out wonderful!

The first time I made this, I followed the reviews that said they used Orange Juice in place of milk.  The resulting loaves collapsed in the middle and were too moist, almost like fruitcake, even though I baked it longer than called for and it passed the toothpick test.  The second time I made it, I used milk - as called for - and it turned out well.  One batch made ten mini-loaves which were done in 35 minutes.  Thanks for a great alternative to banana bread as a holiday gift!

Fabulous!  I chopped my 2 cups of cranberries instead of leaving them whole.  I didn't have any orange extract so I used the zest of 1 orange. My took 55 min. to bake.  Thanks for this great recipe!

My husband and I loved this.  It tasted more like poundcake than bread, but it was still delicious.  Next time I'll try to use fresh cranberries instead of dried cranberries (although I did soak them in hot water to try and plump them up a bit!).  I think I may try to make them as muffins as well by using cake flour and by whipping the egg whites, folding it into the recipe, and then adding in the yolks.  Can't wait to make this again!

This is delicious bread. I used orange juice instead of milk, no orange extract and craisins instead of cranberries. Next time I will only add 1 cup of craisins and will double up on mandarin orange segments.

I suck at baking but i followed this recipe's measurements and changed a couple items and it turned out absolutely wonderfully!

I didn't have anymore white sugar in the house so used brown sugar instead, it was still a touch too sweet for me, but still moist and delicious.

Didn't have mandarin oranges so used a very ripe medium orange cut up into tiny segments. Not enough peel to make enough zest so added tablespoon of orange brandy. 

Didn't have a full cup of cranberries so half of it was raisins. 
Used soy milk since I didn't have milk.
Used fat free Liberte yogurt since i didn't have sour cream. 

I am extremely pleased with the results... the only change I would make is I would cut the sugar next time to half.

I took the advice of others and used Craisons and chopped up the orange segments.  I baked them for 16 minutes in mini-muffin cups and they came out great!  Moist and delicious!  I'll definately be making these again.

I made a couple of changes-used 3/4 almond flour in place of the app flour and used orange juice instead of the milk. Also used regular oranges because I had them on hand. It was easy to make and has a great flavor. The cranberries made it a little too tart for me so next time I’ll add a little less .

Don't overfill your pans. 2/3 full should be good. I doubled the recipe and it overflowed the pans. Next time, I'll skip the cranberries, oranges and sugar on top and just stir the fruit in. The cranberries burned, the orange were unnoticeable (sank?) and the sugar dissolved. The loaves took over an hour to cook. This would be better as muffins or mini loaves, something that didn't take as long to cook through. This is a very sweet batter, although that offsets the tart cranberries. I followed the recipe, although I did add the zest of an orange. That was a delicious addition.

My boyfriend LOVES this bread!!!!  I have made it for holidays and as gifts for relatives and my boyfriend's customers!  Where it calls for the orange extract I actually use Cointreau liqueur (orange flavored) and I only need to buy the miniature bottle for $3.00 at the liquor store and it lasts for a long time!  Enjoy!!!!!

Very good and moist. I experimented with it using leftover cranberry cause I did not want to throw away.  It worked.  My husband had three pieces before it was cooled off!

This was pretty good - definitely super moist (almost too much so). I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour, used vanilla fat free greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. Next time I might try to substitude applesauce for half the butter, or just cut the butter down a bit. The can of oranges I opened were huge slices, so I cut them into each into three pieces. Next time, I might add nuts, or some type of crumb topping.

Loved this recipe, with a few suggested tweaks...  1)I replaced the vanilla and the orange extracts with just ove 2 tsp of pure almond extract; 2)I used one large navel orange, peeled and sliced into small chucnks, in place of the mandarin oranges. To cook, I made one pan loaf, and used the other half of the batter for a tray of mini muffins (cooks those for 30 - 35 min).  Both were DELICIOUS!!

Made this recipe yesterday. Actually we halved the recipe, to test it out. I was considering using this bread as our Christmas presents for our neighbors, but I wanted to try the recipe first before making them guinea pigs!! The verdict is that this is a WONDERFUL recipe that my entire family loves. I'm using the small sized loaf pans. I made a few minor modifications as suggested in prior reviews (a bit less sugar, chopped fresh cranberries, half craisins (I soaked mine in oj), orange zest instead of the extract. I also used the craisin-soaked oj for part of the milk. Oh, since I had zested an orange, I used it for part of the oranges called for in the recipe. I also chopped the organges and mandarin oranges. This recipe will be used many, many times and hopefully enjoyed by my neighbors as well!

after reading reviews and other recipes, I chopped the cranberries and oranges and used zest.  I had meant to use 1 c white sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar.  I forgot the brown sugar, but it turned out delicious!  I couldn't stop eating it!  this is definitely one of the best bread recipes I have ever made!

I loved this recipe!  Easy and so tasty.  I did course chop the cranberries, as one of the reviewers complained they were too tart.  Mine turned out perfect.  I also followed the advice on high altitude.  Will definitely bake this often.

Used craisins, 1/2 c freshly squeezed OJ, the zest from the orange. Outstanding sweet/tartness. Only problem I had was getting it out of the pan after letting stand for 15 minutes. Next time blutter and flour to prep the pan instead of cooking spray.  Bet the flavor is even better tomorrow.

This is the 2nd time I made this recipe. I like my breads more like a casserole so I added chopped almonds, figs and pumpkin seeds. I also used milk with lemon juice and bananas instead of sour cream. It is beautiful and delicious.

Excellent. Really moist. I used dried cranberries/cherries and didn't cut the sugar and sweetness was fine (soaked them a bit first). I didn't have orange essence so added some orange/lemon zest and it was still very good. Took longer to bake by about 20 minutes, but may be because my fruit was wet.

This is yummy.  I roughly chopped the cranberries and the mandarin oranges and used my 18 - mini loaf pan.  I gave them as gifts to coworkers.  I think I will use a little more leavening in it next time though.

I followed the recipe exactly as written because I’m not a creative cook, and I am very much pleased with it. The cranberries were very tart the day I baked it, but the flavors all had blended more the day after, making an incredible taste treat. This is going to the top of my Christmas favorites list. I will also be making it to give away to friends.

I made quite a few changes to this bread.
First, I took a package of vanilla wafers and 1/2 cup pecans and crushed them. I mixed in about 1/3 cup of sugar. I melted around 3/4 stick of butter and added to the vanilla wafers. I used the mixture to line the bread pans.

Also, I used 2 regular oranges. Peeled them and threw them in the blender with the cranberries. I added a tsp of orange extract. 

I cut the sugar in the bread recipe by app 1/4 cup- could have cut a little more.

I added a 1/2 tsp orange extract to the wet mixture so I used a total 1 1/2 tsp orange extract.

I believe it was the sour cream which added moisture to the bread and it was truly wonderful.  the cranberries and mandarin orange slices were tasty, tangy, sweetr and sour.  they all combined to make a truly delightful treat.  great recipe.

Healthier substitutions.  2 cups all purpose, 1/4 cup old fashioned oats and 1/2 cup quick oats. Cut sugar back to only 1 cup. Kept butter at full 1/2 cup. Used Greek honey vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.

This orange cranberry bread is excellent!  I skipped the milk and orange zest and used orange juice instead.  Absolutely delicious.

I made this with gluten free flour and it turned out great.   I did add some orange rind and the juice of one orange for extra orange flavor.  It is so flavorful and moist!

Delicious! Please use fresh cranberries in this recipe instead of dried. Just pulse them in a blender or food processor first.  I didn't have any orange extract so I subbed orange juice for milk but that was the only change. Lovely flavour and appearance.  Great way to use up leftover cranberries and mandarins from Christmas.

This recipe looked so tasty and moist and it was. I made a few changes because I didn't have everything on hand.  First I wanted to make it gluten free.  Just used the GF 1for1 flour for that.  I cut the sugar to one cup.  I didn't have the mandarin oranges, so I used drained crushed pineapple.  To keep the orange flavor I used orange juice instead of milk and put in 8 drops or orange essential oils as I didn't have orange flavoring either.  I figured the orange juice would be okay as the sour cream would help with the milk type constancy.  It needs to cook more because of being so moist.  So glad I gave it a try.

This is a great recipe. I added 1 tsp. fresh orange zest and only used vanilla extract. I also used leftover fresh cranberry relish from Christmas for the cranberries and mandarin oranges since the relish contained the same ingredients.? Because I did not have two loaf pans in our cabin, I used two 7 x 11 Pyrex dishes. Cooked for approximately 35 minutes until tested done with wooden skewer.

Fabulous!  I substituted orange juice for the milk, because I didn't have orange extract.  I also chopped the oranges some, because I prefer smaller chunks in my bread.  It turned out divine!

I love this bread. However, I wasn’t sure about adding 2 cups of fresh cranberries, so I altered it a bit. I took 2 c of fresh cranberries and slightly boiled them in the juice from the mandarin oranges with 1 Tbl sugar, I then drained them. (I had read how people were picking them out because they were too tart) Turned our delicious.

Delish!  Along with another reviewer, made the following changes: used Craisins instead of cranberries (soak in hot water to rehydrate, drain and pat dry).  Also used 1 whole orange (put in food processer)  instead of mandarin oranges and orange extract, and only used 1 cup of sugar and it turned out perfect.  Fabulous recipe!

I used a fresh mandarin as well as the zest. I also used fresh cranberries so it the bread had a wonderful fresh flavor. The only change I will make next time is less sugar, I will cut it back to 1 1/2 cups.

This is delicious!!!  And I think those who use Crasins for this recipe are Crazy!!  I also slightly chopped fresh clementines instead of canned mandarin oranges.  I absolutely love the fresh cranberries and oranges throughout the bread!  Use FRESH cranberries and turn on Little Women for a wonderful old fashioned Christmas treat!!

I used two clementines with zest instead of extract, chopped fresh cranberries, and about half milk/half OJ.  It made four mini loaves.  My oven took about 35 minutes to bake.  Very dense and moist, more like cake than bread.  Delicious.

Loved this!  Made it for new neighbors for Christmas.  I had a ton of fresh cranberries, so I coursely chopped in food processor (which is a MUST if you don't want crazy tartness) and like others substituted OJ for the milk.   YUM!  Came out golden brown and to die for??.

Used frozen blueberries instead of cranberries (though I had some but no...),  replaced some of the milk with orange juice and reduced the sugar by about  1/4 of a cup. Also took al ot longer than 40 minutes to bake. Very good, will definitely make again.

I test a lot of recipes out on my coworkers and they usually love everything I get from this site.  They loved this bread.  My husband who doesn't usually like cranberry orange even liked it.  Thanks for sharing.

Everyone in our family LOVES these! :) I do make a few changes, 1/2 of flour is whole wheat, sub oj for the milk, use only a little over a cup of sugar, no orange extract, but 2 t vanilla and 1/2 t soda. I also add lots of pecans... they are AWESOME!!!! :) I make them muffins and they take about 35 min.

Best bread ever!  I always buy extra bags of cranberries at Thanksgiving and freeze them so I can make this bread all year.  I use whole wheat flour and fresh oranges every time.

Used a whole organic orange insured of canned.  Chopped 3/4 of it and added to the batter.  Sliced the rest and put in the pan pouring Batter on top.  Used dried cranberries and walnuts.  Sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger on top.  Very most.

This is an amazing recipe.  If I had made no substitutions, it still would have been amazing.  I didn't have orange extract, so took other cook's advice and used orange zest.  I didn't half my mandarin orange segments and I'm glad I didn't.  I love biting into this bread and tasting whole slices of oranges.  I did cut my fresh cranberries in half but I have a feeling I would have liked it even if I hadn't done that.  I love cranberries and I love the tart flavor.  This is a keeper, for sure.  Thank you!

After reading the previous reviews, I decided to replace fresh cranberries with dried and cut the sugar to 1 1/2cups. The result was a wonderful rich moist not too tart not too sweet bread. Warmed and served with frozen vanilla yogurt might be tasty.

I made this today and it is wonderful! I substituted OJ for the milk and omitted the orange extract because I didn't have any, and it didn't seem to matter! Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

Fabulous!  Moist and rich.  My husband absolutely loves this recipe.  I made two loaves for Thanksgiving and he ate one all by himself!!  Easy and delicious. 
I would note that I followed the recipe exactly and I would not change a thing, except it takes a bit longer to cook than what is specified. 
I would also note that I don't understand how people change four or more of the main ingredients and then complain that the recipe is not good.  It actually is delicious if you follow the recipe!!

Excellent and very easy to make. I subbed the zest of a navel orange plus the juice of half of it for the can of mandarins.  The berries are tart but it's great with the sweet bread.

We all absolutely loved this recipe. Took the advice of other reviewers and used dried cranberries instead of fresh. I make the original recipe for my family, and for myself I make gluten free muffins. I just replace the flour with the same amount of any GF flour mix and it tastes great. The cream cheese keeps it moist with just the right amount of "gooey-ness", and the vanilla and orange extract mask the taste of the gluten free flour.

This cranberry bread was a hit, I had to make a second batch for my guests since the first was gone in minutes. I used fresh cranberry and fresh satsumas. I cut the cranberry using my Cuisinart food processor which once sliced you cannot detect the tartness. I also used orange rind instead of orange extract. Saved this for future use. Thanks Ina.

I was a little skeptical with the orange slices in the bread. I thought that it might be too moist or rather soggy, but to my surprise it was just right.  The recipe doesn't state whether the cranberries are fresh or dried.  I had fresh on hand and it came out great!  Kudos to the cook!

This recipe is amazing.  I used mini loaf pans and baked for 30 minutes. Husband loves them and I bought cranberries to freeze to use at a later date.  Doubled extracts as some other reviews.  Try this one!!

Fantastic! I made 2 loaves for my co-workers and was asked for the recipe again and again. It was a real hit. This is what I am making for Christmas gifts for our neighbors. Since we live in Maine I substituted Pure Maple Syrup (1 c.) for the sugar.

I recommend this recipe even for restaurants and bakeries. The moisture, consistency, flavor and affordability of this "bread" is remarkable. I make these and give them as Christmas gifts as well as store them baked in my freezer. Sometimes it's good to pre-slice them and wrap individual pieces in plastic wrap then put into a freezer bag so they'll stay fresh and you can thaw one piece at a time to save on wasting them.

really good. I will try baking longer next time- as the loaf kind of fell apart upon taking out of the pan, but was very tasty. I almost wonder if was a little too moist with all the moisture from the cranberries and the mandarin organges- but great base recipe. may play with it a little next time. Cut down the sugar as well. I halved recipe as well-- didn't need 2 loaves laying around here!! :)

Needs More Baking Time!  I made this recipe exactly as given and the loaves were definitely not baked through completely after just 40 minutes at 350 degrees - it took more like 60 minutes.  Like other reviewers, I used fresh cranberries, however I cut them in half which resulted in them not all sinking to the bottom of the bread, which I have experienced previously when using large berries.  The orange extract is a must - it really brings out the flavor.  Be sure to completely drain the mandarin oranges - too much moisture here and the bread will be of a soggy consistency. Sprinkling chopped walnuts on one loaf and coarse sparkling sugar on the other enhanced their appearance and added a delightful crunchiness.

I did it with fresh cranberries but I put a little sugar on them first (like you would do with strawberries) to cut the tartness.  Everyone who likes cranberry/orange anything LOVES this recipe.

So my sister announced an impromptu game night at her place and I was in need of something edible to bring and share. After a frantic internet search I found this cranberry orange bread recipe. I had most of the ingredients on hand, with suitable substitutes to make it work with my vegan diet... so cranberry orange bread it is! YAY!

I may or may not have eaten half the finished batch of bread all by myself...




maybe. 


ok, so I did. -_-

Here are the changes I made: I used raw cane sugar in place of white sugar and used 1/2 a cup less than called for. I subbed Earth Balance for the butter, orange juice in place of the milk, non dairy yogurt instead of sour cream, Ener-G in place of the eggs, I dropped the orange extract (because I didn't have it) and added an extra cup of cranberries (all of which I roughly chopped). I made one big batch in an 8x8 pan because it's all I could find so it took quite a bit longer to cook. As other reviewers mentioned, definitely let this bread cool COMPLETELY before you tear into it. Not only will it save your tongue and mouth from being melted off by the *hotter than molten lava* cranberries, but it also tastes LIGHT YEARS better once it's cooled! 

I will definitely be making this again, soon! What came home from game night was quickly devoured by my 15 year old who LOVED it! Maybe next time we'll even share with everyone else! ;)

Absolutely wonderful!  Incredibly moist, delicious and full of flavor.  Doubled the vanilla, and like one reviewer sprinkled the buttered pan and the top of the loaves with cinnamon sugar, and some coarse sugar on top, which gave a nice subtle crust and lovely finish.  The end product doesn't need any extra butter or cream cheese on top, unlike many fruit breads I've tried before.  Made it for the first time on Christmas and it was a HUGE hit; will undoubtedly be making it many more times.

Excellent recipe, bread comes out tasty and moist!  A couple of changes that I made: I had fresh mandarin oranges on hand so I substituted those.  I used 3 1/2 small mandarin oranges.  the downside of using fresh oranges is that you get a bit of pulp but it softens up while baking.  I didn't have orange extract so I used some orange zest from the oranges I was using.  I didn't measure the zest -but it was maybe 1/4 tsp.

This recipe was great!  I will definitely make this again.  I was craving cranberry orange muffins (like the ones that Dunkin Donuts used to make years ago) but I couldn't find them anywhere.  This was exactly the taste that I wanted!

I made a few minor changes to the recipe:  used fresh mandarin orange sections, 2 tablespoons of frozen OJ concentrate mixed with 1/4 cup of water.  I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup also (since I used the sweetened OJ concentrate). I used the fresh cranberries b/c I like the tartness factor but I did take the advice of several others and coursely chopped the cranberries so that they weren't too tart. 

The bread turned out very moist with a pronounced orange flavor that really came through without being overwhelming and the tartness of the fresh cranberries was perfect!

I have to share that I made this up, albeit extremely tired for Christmas morning brunch. I forgot to add the butter, but the finished results still came out PERFECT. My granddaughters that live nearby love fruit and veggies, so this works out great for them, especially being able to see the orange segments, and the craisens work out well too. I use a larger can of mandarin oranges and let them drain for about an hour before working on the recipe, and even generic dried cranberries work. You will NOT be disappointed in this recipe at all. I did use half white sugar and half brown. Seems to add another level of richness to the bread.  Good luck and ENJOY this.

Wow! Easy to make and was moist and yummy. I used mini loaf pans and gave for gifts. Because of this I put the oranges in a colander and mashed as I was afraid the chunks would be too big. i also used craisans and it turned out perfect.

I have made this twice now and it's excellent! I love tangy, so I've used fresh cranberries and its been quite popular with my family. I usually throw in the whole bag, which is slightly more than the 2 cups called for.

Absolutely the best cranberry orange bread I have ever had.  I've made more than one batch now, and they are consistently excellent.  Here are the substitutions I made: used (1) whole orange sent through food processor instead of canned mandarin, used orange juice instead of milk, and used twice the vanilla and zero orange extract.  FYI, use fresh or frozen cranberries.  PERFECT.

Used 1-1/2 tsp. orange zest instead of orange flavouring and diced fresh oranges rather than mandarins.  This was awesome!!!  So moist and flavourful.  Definite keeper!

This is a great cranberry bread recipe! I chose it over others because I had most of the ingredients already. I did not have orange extract, however I had lemon extract and I substituted 1/2 tsp of the lemon extract instead of the orange extract. I also added about 1 cup of chopped pecans. I split the batter into three loaf pans instead of two. Worked great - being at higher altitude (6500') things usually take longer to bake here, so if I tried to put the batter into two pans it would have taken much longer to bake.

I tried this recipe a few years ago and thought it was very delicious.  I'm keeping it as a standard.

I added this to our Thanksgiving dinner.  I substituted the orange extract for orange zest and it was still a big hit.  This is a keeper!

WOW - was our initial response.  This has to be the very best cranberry orange bread ever!  It disappeared within minutes of being served - even with a table full of Thanksgiving treats.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thanks for submitting this!

I loved the tartness of the fresh cranberries mixed with the sweetness of the oranges. It was such an easy thing to throw together, and I will definitely be making it again.

Just delicious!!  The only thing I substituted was orange zest for orange extract and am VERY happy with the outcome.  The bread came out super moist, husband said it tastes like a pound cake (which we love).  There is a subtle sweetness to the bread that is lovely.  Plus it's beautiful!!  Great for the holidays.
