I made a few changes to this to suit our family. I was afraid that it was going to be a little on the flavorless side, but this surprised me by being a very good dish that my husband said was "stinking amazing". I used cous cous instead of rice, added about a clove more of garlic, and seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt and pepper. Followed the cooking directions to a T and it turned out amazing! I also used a blend of parmesan and asiago, and sprinkled some more on top when serving. Will be making this again!

The cauliflower and brocolli were very mushy as well as the cauliflower giving this a "lacking something" taste.  I expected more of a fresh veggie taste with this dish.  The chicken was good tho.

Yay an easy healthy dish and me and my husband both liked it! the only problem was that my garlic burnt:( 
still turned out though, because i just added some more after cooking chicken. Also used veg oil not spray, and cheddar cheese:) thanks!

A very easy weeknight dinner option.  I substituted one sliced yellow squash in place of the frozen veggies and they were steamed perfectly by sitting on top of the rice while it cooked.  Needed a little something to finish it off and a splash of lemon juice did the trick to add a lot more depth to the dish.

Very good though I skipped the garlic and parmesan but it was so easy to make and is so flexible I think it could be seasoned for any taste

Four stars, but only with my changes/enhancements.  I used 4 breasts that were a good 1” thick totaling 1.5 lbs.  I seasoned the breasts liberally with Adobo and Crazy Janes (my “go to” seasonings).  The cooking spray was good to use to brown the breasts, but that’s about it.  After browning I kept them in a warm oven.  I added about 2 tbspns of butter to the pan and sautéed some left over chopped green onions and white onions that were in the fridge, and doubled the garlic (but I always at least double the garlic) until they were soft, not browned.  Then added the rice along with ½ tspn rosemary, ½ tspn marjoram, ¼ tspn savory (mixed/crushed spices with a mortar & pestle).  Let that cook for about 2 mins, then add the broth.  I found that 1 ¾ cup was not enough and had to add some.  I’d go w/2 cups next time.  Heat to boiling, cover and reduce to low and cook for 10 mins.  Then I added some frozen mixed veges and peas (not a fan of broccoli – vile weed – or cauliflower) and the parm cheese.  After cooking for another 5 minutes I added back the chicken, covered and cooked for another ten minutes on low.  The chicken was moist and the rice flavorful.  I squeezed ¼ of a lemon over it all at the end.  Next time I will only add the parm cheese and some lemon on the individual servings.  The cheese, which I doubled, could not be tasted at all.

This  is a good base recipe that can be modified & personalized in many ways.  I'm only rating it a 3, because as written, it lacks in flavor.  With the addition of different seasonings, the recipe  can be suited to almost anyone's tastes.

The whole family really liked this recipe.  I added a bag of frozen broccoli with cheese sauce (cheddar) and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and thyme.  Also omitted the parmesan.  May be a weeknight regular!

No Changes - Good Flavor but not great.  If you like garlic, add another clove.  The veggies are very bland and you have to use salt and pepper to up the flavor.

I made this as a quick trying to be healthy meal. The chicken was bland, and the rice and vegetables were mush. I doubled the recipe but that is the only change I made. 
I will not be making this ever again!

I made and it came out very good. I made some changes I cut the chicken breast into cubes, also made risotto rice made with broccoli and added Worcester sauce. My husband and I went back for seconds. Thank you for another great recipe.

Pretty terrible. Absolutely flavourless and mushy.

This could be drastically improved if you substitute quinoa for rice, add the vegetables in at the end instead of the beginning, and use some spices for h*ck's sake!

As it stands, it's edible, but barely.

Won't make again, only eat half and I'm not fussy in the slightest. Very flavourless and the cooking times are wayyyy off. I'd make that many changes it would be a different recipe!

Good flavor but the frozen vegetables need to go in later.or be fresh.After they cooked so long they turned to mush. I also cut up the chicken to make it a one bowl meal.

Very simple (read: kinda bland), but I livened it up a little.  Seasoned the chicken well & extra garlic after browning it. Also added frozen peas which I love.  Some lemon juice and parsley at the end.   I bet saffron would be good in this...

Very good and very easy to make and my husband liked it. :) The only thing i did different was add the garlic after browning chicken because garlic tends to burn easily. Will make this again

I was disappointed in this recipe. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, which helped, but the rice was very bland and dry. It definitely needed some seasoning and a sauce of some kind. I won't be making this again. UPDATE: Rather than throwing out the leftovers, I cubed the chicken, added half a can of Progresso tomato cooking sauce, and stirred everything together. This made the dish much better.

We all loved it and it was so easy to make.  Very quick and effortless.  Even my daughter who is beginning to realize she doesn't like veggies ate them
