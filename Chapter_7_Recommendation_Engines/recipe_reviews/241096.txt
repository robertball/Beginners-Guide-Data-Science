This was excellent! We're not vegetarians, but trying to eat more plant based meals. It was definitely on the spicier side, which was totally fine by me and my older kiddo, but was a little much for my mom and little kiddo. I will definitely make again, just cutting the cayenne in half to appease the more sensitive taste buds. Thank you for sharing this.

Spicy and filling!  Easy to make! I kept the onions, garlic, beans,and  spices in one pan, while the rice and corn were in another pan.  Then, I layered the bean mixture and the rice mixture onto the tortilla shells.  Delicious!

Way too spicy and needs some extra flavor (preferably a sauce) like sour cream.

Very yummy vegetarian burrito! But too spicy even though I usually do fine with spicy food. I'll reduce the spiciness next time. I probably will be cooking this frequently :-)

I don't like spicy but I loved this! I followed the recipe about 99%. I only used half the pepper  because I don't like too much. I was puzzled by the fact there was no liquid even though it was to cook on the stove. So I added vegetable broth. It worked well. It's pretty great. I think I found a vegetarian meal my carnivore friends will like.

It was pretty good! My kids liked it and didn’t think it was too spicy. They added cheese and sour cream. I think I’ll tone down both the black and cayenne peppers, I like a little kick but it was a bit much for me. I also think some grilled bell peppers and onion would go great with this as I found it a little bland. I used plain fat free Greek yogurt with it and it was delicious.

These were really good!  I did cut back on the black and red pepper a lot, and they were still spicy enough for my family.
