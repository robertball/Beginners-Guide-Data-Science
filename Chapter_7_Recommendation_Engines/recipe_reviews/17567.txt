This is the Red Velvet cake recipe I grew up on. It is a dense, moist pound cake and the only way to make Red Velvet cake! The other (cake like)Red Velvet recipes here can't hold a candle to this one. This IS a true Red Velvet Cake. The title should say pound cake though.

I think the people that have complained or not liked this particular recipe are looking for the cake like type with icing between the layers. The kind like you buy in the grocery store. 

To me that's not REAL Red Velvet cake though. This is like my grandma and mom always made and will always be a family favorite! If you are looking for a great moist Red Velvet pound cake, this one won't disappoint you.

If you like the grocery store version...there have them in the bakery section.

When I saw that this recipe didn't call for vinegar, I should have known to just keep looking for another recipe. But I gave this one a try. Not too terribly disappointing, but I have to agree with the review that calls this cake a butter cake. Red velvet cakes are dense (thanks to the vinegar) and moist. This cake was buttery with no density and the flavor of a butter cake, not a chocolate cake, which is really what red velvet cake is.

This recipe was easy and quick but my cake was dry without a lot of flavor.  I prefer the Hershey's Red Velvet Cake recipe.

This was a definate disappointment.  I'm still quite puzzled as to the title of this cake...it's certainly not an authentic red velvet cake.  Perhaps you meant buttermilk, as opposed to regular milk, in that aspect, I can understand why it wouldn't need the vinegar, as the buttermilk is quite acidic enough to allow the baking soda to rise.  I will stick with my family's heirloom recipe.  Thanks for trying to share though.

this is a very moist, rich cake that came out perfect on my first attempt.  it was very easy to prepare, however, use a very large bowl for mixing.  it makes a lot of batter!  i used a cream cheese frosting that not only tasted well but presented well, especially at christmas parties.  this is a great recipe and has become a family favorite.  ann davis

This recipe was a lot of work, but it's hard work to make this kind of cake anyway.  It was worth all the effort.  It had a unique flavor and I was given many compliments on it!

Love this recipe. Easy to make, very appealing to the palate and eye. I suggest using a big pan because of the large batter.

This is not a true Red Velvet Cake and is more of a butter cake, very heavy.  Too much batter for the pan.  Friends were disappointed that it was not Red Velvet.

I baked my cake on 2 8-inch cake pans for an hour.  I think I over-baked the cakes I bit too long because of how they looked when I took them out of the oven.  The taste is yummy... the cakes are a bit dense and I love it this way especially when the cakes will be covered in fondant!!
Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!

Way to much red food coloring.  It had a chemical taste.  To dense, it was like a ton of bricks and had a flour taste as well.  And 5 Eggs...OMG.  I have to find a different recipe.

If you don't like the taste of heaven then don't make this cake. This is only the second cake I have ever made and I have to say it was sooo good. I made it for my fiances birthday and he and his family loved it. One small peice is very filling and satisfying. It just melts in your mouth. I tried a little from the middle before I put frosting on it and I didn't even want to put frosting on it because the cake itself was so good (and I'm not usually a big fan of cake) So I would recomend this to anyone. Its like a cake brownie! And it would feed 14 people it's so dense. Very good! This will will be my go to cake for sure! Thank you so much!!!

This was a good recipe, but took time. The recipe prepares a LOT of batter, so I had enough to make 24 cupcakes and a thin 9x13 sheet cake I then cut into heart shapes to top half my cupcakes (12 hearts). It is pretty dense, but definitely tastes like red velvet. Also, I wasn't able to get a bright red color, and that was after 15 drops of food coloring. Deep deep red/brown. Overall, I would make it again, but only for a home gathering- not to show off at a party of something like that.

It just wasn't that tasty...barely any chocolate flavor.  A couple other people told me they liked it.  I'll definitely use a different recipe next time.

The only problem I had was that I didn't add enough red food coloring to make it  dark red like in the picture that I seen of the completed cake but other than that I did great with the recipe.

Its edible but not very good. Overly chocolaty which isn't a bad thing  but the flavors of the cake were not proportioned well and the shortening when mixed in would not completely melt and when I baked the cake it had white specs on the top  of shortening because it didn't melt completely while mixing. Maybe use another recipe next time.

Pretty good Red Velvet Cake. However, I do have to agree with some of the comments. I had to use nearly half the bottle of red food coloring just to get it into a purple, almost magenta color. And then even after I put a little extra batter into the Bundt pan, I still had enough batter to make half a dozen cupcakes! Overall, I liked this recipe - it had a very nice flavor and texture, there were some technical errors that I had to work out.

I made this in the form of cupcakes and the taste and texture was great......but mine did not turn out red, it was sort of light brown. Also while my cupcakes were cooling, they started to fall instead of stay puffy.

Me and my friend made this cake it looks very nice but when we tasted it we were not pleased. It was rather bland and was not like most red velvet cakes. I would say that it was too chocolatey to be a red velvet cake and the chocolate flavoring was repulsive. So I would not recommend this recipe for further use.

I just made this cake on a whim. I liked the list of ingredients cause they're easy to find around the house! Although this was more of a red velvet pound cake. If I were to make it again I would probably use more cocoa powder and more baking powder. That way it rises more ( becoming more moist) and chocolatier.

I love this cake and its fairly easy to prepare. It's the consistency of a pound cake verses a traditional Red Velvet, but I love pound cakes, so I have no complaints.
