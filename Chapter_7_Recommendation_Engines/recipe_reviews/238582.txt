I think as written, this is a four star recipe to me. As others mentioned, it comes out a bit bland. I made it as called for with the exception of cooking my lentils in beef broth. After tasting, I added a half teaspoon of cumin, and maybe a quarter tsp of garam masala. I found this stepped it up a notch, but really what makes the dish is the Greek yogurt (or sour cream) you serve it with. With a little extra spice and the yogurt/cream on top, I think this is five stars. I've been looking for budget friendly dishes to work into my line up. I think I'll make this again.

This is on the mild side, so other herbs can be used for additional flavor!  It is great as written, though.  Thanks!

for non-vegetarians, adding italian sausage does a lot to enhance the flavor.

Very tasty!  I used vegetable stock instead of water . . . added just a little more tomato paste, and then a teaspoon of cumin with the ground chili. Loved it. Oh, and I didn't even bother with the salt and pepper. Thanks much!

This was excellent, I used some of my bone broth and Mole’ instead of water and tomato paste. Very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  It was easy to make but I thought it was quite bland for my taste and needed something more than just the chili powder...hence the 3* rating. However the contrast in textures was great...lentils against the sweet flavor of the carrots!  I’d make it again but experiment w/ some seasonings.  Bay leaves for sure. Thank you for the recipe!

I forgot to put in the tablespoon of tomato paste, but we still loved it. Will definitely make again!

I cooked this exactly as the directions called for. It had very good flavor but the problem I had was the carrots weren't cooked. They were half cooked. Next time I will add the carrots to the lentils cooking and keep them in longer than 2 minutes.

I used vegetable broth. To overcome the blandness others wrote about I tripled the garlic and added 1/8 teaspoon of rosemary, which resulted in quite a nice dish.

The recipe was good, but the next time I make I will double the amount of tomato paste and chili powder.  It needs a little more kick.  I liked that it really fills you up.

This was okay, but I probably wouldn't made it again. Even with all the garlic and onions, it came out rather bland.

This is a keeper recipe for me. I did use a small can of tomato juice rather than open a can of tomato paste.
I may try adding curry next time.
