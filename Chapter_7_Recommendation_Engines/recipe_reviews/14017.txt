This recipe is great, and was even better the next day. Did not go over well with the my child, but he did allow a little to be sprinkled over cheese in the tortilla. Wonderful for using up the zucchini from the garden. The spice mixture is Indian; if you do not like curries and other Indian fare, don't make this.

Rani, thank you.  This recipe glides above the rest with an easy to cook sommer delight which is both healthy and gentle to the palate.  My only two additions were Philadelphia garden variety cream cheese instead of sour cream and sun dried tomatoes.  I am wrapping up my last tortilla right now (now pun intended), so again, thank you. And keep adding recipes!

Didn't like this one, sorry.  The ground cloves were too overbearing so toned them down a bit... didn't help.

These were absolutely delicious. I was curious to find out how ginger was going to taste with the varied list of other spices, but the whole combination was delicious and actually left me craving it for dinner. Substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream which was the perfect accompaniment.

my husband loved this -- and he doesn't usually like cinnamon! As someone else mentioned, the cloves are a little overpowering but that could easily be omitted.

I added grated carrot and garlic to make it more interesting and used smaller tortilla wraps.

These were VERY good.  The spice combination is unusual but it works so well together.  This was a fun food to make and eat.  I used a very small grater (because I didn't have a larger one) and it made the consistency almost like that of refried beans.  I don't think that was Rani's intent, but it was good.  One mistake I made that I'll avoid next time is to limit the warming of the tortillas to only a minute ... I left them in the oven for about 3-4 minutes and discovered they hardened and were difficult to roll.

The clove taste was pretty weird with the zucchini.  Some people would probably like this, but it wasn't to my taste.

This recipe had a mild curry flavor -- I was expecting mexican! -- still I liked it.  Pretty easy to make, and one of my two kids liked it as well.  (I was looking for ways to cook zucchini so my kids would eat it.)

I am gluten-intolerant, so I used corn tortillas instead. And I must say that the corn tortillas were the best part. This recipe has an interesting flavor, but it's probably not something I will want to eat again.

This is my favorite way to eat zucchini.  I combine this with spiced black beans, a bit of cheese, and salsa on a tortilla, and warm it in the microwave.  I thought there was too much cumin, and it was too spicy, so I used 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 2 dashes of chili, 1/8 tsp balck pepper, and 6 whole cloves.  It turned out great.

I thought it tasted fine. Just a different flavor then I was use to. I think it needed cheese though.  Or maybe I needed to add more salt. There was just something lacking.  I will be making it again.

This was good, but I thought the cinnamon, clove, and ginger were too strong for the delicate flavor of zucchini. I served it with spinach leaves on grilled naan bread, and it made a nice sandwich. Next time, I'll make it with just the cumin and mustard seed, and serve it on the naan bread, but with hummus. Thanks for the inspiration!

I enjoyed this Indian-flavored dish as a tasty way to use up squash in the summer, but my family was not impressed.

This was tasty! I didn't have any fresh ginger so I used ground instead, and I substituted the cloves for allspice which gave it more of a Mid-East flavour. I would only recommend this to lovers of ethnic or spicy foods, or else you might not enjoy the flavour combinations. Also, try it on warm pita bread instead of a tortilla.

Sorry, but I did not enjoy this and could not finish it.  The spices did not work together for me.  I thought the cloves and cinnamon were way too strong.

Wonderful! The flavors remind me of indian food. I didn't have cumin seeds so I substituted cumin powder at the end, and added some fresh chopped cilantro since I had it handy. Delicious!

This was good, but a little on the bland side for me.  As another person suggested, I added a can of black beans (regular) and some salsa. Very good with those additions.  This definitely has an Indian flair to it, so if you are not a fan of Indian food, I wouldn't make this. Great way to use up that squash!  Thank you!

I thought this recipe was very good and easy.  I did leave out the cinnamon and cloves because I didn't have any.  I used a whole wheat tortilla and served it with fried sweet potato straws and cilantro pesto...so yummy!  My only advice is to sprinkle the grated zucchini with some salt, but it in a colander, and press it down with a bowl to drain some of the liquid out.  I did this for about half an hour before I put it in the pan and it really helps keep the mixture from being too watery.

My, what a great summer recipe! These wraps are truly delicous and surprisingly easy given the long list of ingredients. We used whole wheat tortillas and plain yogurt instead of sour cream.

Using half the amount of cloves and adding the zucchini mixture to some brown rice really makes a great twist to the hum drum burrito.

this was very tasty & filling -- i loved the combination of spices!  so easy to make, and a great way to use up all those summer zucchinis!  i used yogurt instead of sour cream, and i think the yogurt taste complemented the spices much better than sour cream would have.  super!!

I made these, leaving out the following simply because I don't like those flavors:
mustard seed, cumin seeds, grated fresh ginger, ground cloves, and ground cinnamon. I thought they were great! My boyfriend loved them too!

I did not use the Ginger or Cloves. I added Garlic Pepper and Sriracha sauce  and grated Cheese. Love it will make again for my Veggie Friends and Family. So Good.
