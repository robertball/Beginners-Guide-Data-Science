Made this last night for a New Year's Eve dinner - super easy, very very tasty and pretty on the plate to boot! I used two bunches of asparagus, about 3/4 pint of tomatoes, oil and 1/3 cup cheese. No salt or pepper. VERY good - will make again!!! Just 5 people almost ate it all up!! Tip: When steaming the asparagus, steam slightly underdone as it will keep cooking during the few minutes that the cheese melts. Also, drain off the water real well so you don't get watery cheese.

I was looking for a quick recipe to use up a bunch of asparagus we had lying around and decided to give this a try.  Instead of just olive oil, I used a garlic balsamic vinaigrette that I had already made (EV olive oil, garlic, dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, sugar, salt, black pepper).  I let the asparagus simmer for a couple minutes in the vinaigrette with the added tomatoes then grated fresh parmesan over the top before serving.  We loved this!  It was such a fresh & delicious side dish!  Thanks for the great idea!  :)

Awesome!  I didn't have any tomatoes so made it without and it was still a hit. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the steaming time in half and reduced the amount of cheese. Leftovers were excellent the next day on the salad I had for lunch.

I used this recipe as a guide, but made a number of changes, including changing the cooking method.  I used 1/2 bunch of asparagus, cut into 2-3" pieces, tossed in just a little olive oil, adding salt and pepper.  I increased the tomatoes using 10 grape tomatoes for basically 1/2 the recipe and also tossed them in olive oil adding salt and pepper.  I roasted the asparagus at 400 degrees for about 6 minutes and then added the tomatoes and parmesan for another 2 minutes.  My asparagus were pencil thin and came out perfectly and the tomatoes weren't mushie and had just begun to collapse a little.  I would do it this way again.  Same concept, but different method.  Pretty, too!

This was a great recipe - dinner guests loved it. The tomatos added such great color to this dish. I did hit the Asparagus with some sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe! I made it for Easter and there wasn't a bite left. The only change I made was to add a splash of white balsamic vinegar with the olive oil. I will definitely be making it again.

I made this to accompany steaks last night.  It was excellent.  I just drizzled about 2T olive oil over the asparagus as I thought 1/4 cup was too much and used about 15 grape tomatoes since they were small.  Turned out perfect.

This asparagus is too pretty, too good, to be called just “Asparagus Side Dish.”  It simply doesn’t do it justice.   One criticism on the recipe itself, however – 10 minutes cooking time would have turned this to an army green mush.  Just a few minutes is plenty, given you’re going to continue cooking for another couple of minutes once you add the tomatoes.

Oh, wow this is absolutely delicious! It looked so simple and figured it would just be like any other sauteed asparagus I have made. But, it was much more elegant looking and tasting. Next time though, I might try using less olive oil and parmesan cheese, but only because a lot of it gets left on the bottom of the pan. But, I loved the asparagus and little tomato combination.

Made for supper last night as a side totally awesome. I did however do my own thing but kept the basic recipe. I like to snap my asparagus by holding ends and bending them till they break so as to remove the tough section. I did braise with julienne carrots for about ten minutes then drained but put into a cast iron skillet and arranged for presentation. I then topped with chopped Roma tomatoes, a blend of fresh grated Parmesan, Asiago, Romano cheeses, some fresh homemade Queso cheese that I had and a little and some grated mozzarella. Seasoned with a little salt and pepper and oregano drizzled with olive oil and put in broiler to just melt cheese then topped with some fresh snipped cilantro. Absolutely wonderful accompaniment to any dish. If anyone does not like asparagus you got to try this, you will be converted. Great change from the lemon & garlic and grilled, baked etc. Will be making this again and again for sure. Thank you Cari for the recipe. Your recipe in Italian contorno di asparagi.

Can a person eat too much asparagus? I hope not, because I keep making this recipe!
I actually boil the asparagus first, then drain and add to the pan with olive oil, tomatoes, and seasonings (salt and pepper) - just for a few minutes, to mix it all together.  I don't use anywhere near that much olive oil...just enough to coat the asparagus.

This recipe was so easy to prepare and was delicious! I might cut down the olive oil a bit next time but other than that, it was a wonderful addition to the grilled steak and sweet corn. Got the husband and son stamp of approval!

I made this side dish for Easter dinner to accompany a honey citrus turkey and au grstin potatoes.  It was a wonderful additional to the meal!  My adjustments: I sliced carrots lengthwise and added them with the asparagus.  I grated Dubliner Cheese instead of parmesan for a little extra kick.  I'll definately be making this again!

Delicious! I steamed the Asparagus for slightly less time than suggested, and even with less Parmesan than suggested it was full of flavor.

This was very good. I do think that the cheese added some oil so next time I might omit the olive oil or just add a tiny bit. I will make this again, it was easy and tasty.

Sauteed some pine nuts and added to the veggies.  This is a very nice fresh side dish, and it will be made often in this house.

Wonderful recipe. Makes enough for us two old people two days. Only thing  I did different was add more tomatoes simply because we love them cooked. Good low-cal recipe.

Mmm.. I'm not a huge fan of asparagus, but this was very good.  Adding tomatoes was a perfect idea. You could even add bread crumbs with alittle parmesan cheese would be good with this also.  Will be making this again!

I made this last night with a chicken recipe i got on here. Ive alway's loved asparagus but never made it because well im not that skilled when it comes to cooking.This recipe was simple and it was delicious.I didnt make to much because i was afraid their would be to much left over. Every one finished and wanted second's.

Tasted nice. This could definitely use less olive oil & less parmesan. I had clumps of parmesan in mine.

I just kinda eyeballed a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to drizzle on the asparagus because 1/4 cup did seem to be a little on the heavy side.  Other than that, the recipe was amazing as is!  Everyone in the house devoured it.

I followed this reciped exactly.  It only got two stars because I love the taste of asparagus so much.  Otherwise, the dish is too oily and the cheese is too tasteless.  I won't be using this recipe again

Great side dish, but like others, I cut the steaming time almost in half, and only used a drizzle of olive oil after draining. Will make this again...maybe next time with slivered almonds added with the parmesan.

Very, very good. I'd add more than 10 grape tomatoes though, I felt like we didn't have enough for 4 servings but other than that, a wonderful side dish!

OMG this recipe is awesome!  This was my first try at making Asparagus and I chose this recipe and am I glad I did, the flavor of the tomatoes with the Asparagus is great. My husband loved it.  Next time I will use less olive oil.

You know it's a good veggie recipe when your 4 year old asks for seconds. This was so quick and easy, and the flavor was wonderful. The only change I made was adding more tomatoes (because I had to use them), and chopping the asparagus into kid-size pieces. Excellent!

I made a large batch for a church supper.  I added sliced baby portabella mushrooms and sliced sweet onions.  I cooked it on the grill for about 45 minutes and it turned out great!

Wonderfully delicious!  I'm no cook; this was easy.  
But I did add someone else's notes: balsamic vinegar with 1 tsp. garlic, 1/4 tsp. Dijon mustard, 1 tsp. sugar, 1/8 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. black pepper.

I did exactly as recipe said, presentation was 5 stars, but there was absolutely too much olive oil and that ruined the whole dish.  I recommend much less olive oil and more tomatoes.

Beautiful! A very easy and delightful way to enjoy asparagus...I added julienned carrots and gave it a dash of unseasoned bread crumbs just before serving. I will add red pepper in place of tomatoes at some point.

Ultimately I decided to make this because the picture is so pretty.  But I was really surprised at how great it was!  The acidity of the tomatoes was a great burst in the mouth with the asparagus and parm.  Oh and use fresh parm....fantastic!

This is so very good!!!! I made it just the way it is, and it was fantastic. I didn't think it could get better, but I added some Balsamic Vinegar to mine on my plate, and it sent it out of this world!

I'd skip the rating if I could, since I changed this up, but I can't.  The asparagus at the store looked so bad I made this with broccoli instead.  With broccoli:  5 stars!

I really enjoyed this.  My 2 year old son LOVES asparagus and tomatoes so this is a perect side dish!  The second time I made it I cut the steaming time in half because we all prefer our asparagus crisp.

Taste was great! And so basic, there's no way you can mess this up. I think next time I will use a little less olive oil though.

I adapted this for the grill by not steaming but rather grilling the asparagus and olive oil over low direct heat for about 10 minutes then adding the tomatoes for about 3 more minutes.

Brought as a cold BBQ side.  I blanched the asparagus then threw it in ice water. Chopped it to bite size tossed with minced garlic olive oil salt pepper. Added prosciutto shreds. Grape tomatoes and Parmesan flakes. Really good!

I loved loved this recipe and so did my family.  The only thing I changed was the parmesan cheese.  I used grated Italian cheese and I used delivered almonds to top it.  Oh and I feel you can use those super sweet cherry tomatoes too. So so good!  Thanks for sharing.

I use an electric steamer for all of my veggies, so I only steamed the asparagus for half the time before transferring into a pan and sauteeing with the tomatoes. I'll add more cheese next time. Yummy!

NB - In photo is the asparagus side and salisbury steak with mushrooms, also on All Recipes.

These were a delicious side dish and I love how this dish not only included the asparagus but also added ingredients like tomatoes. Even thought I personally don't like asparagus it was a huge hit with my family and they enjoyed it all the way.

I made it exactly as the recipe read and it was delicious. I love roasting asparagus so the family is used to that but the tomatoes added a wonderful sweetness to the dish. Will definitely make again. Great for summer dinners outside.

We steamed these with butter over apple pellets on the grill.  Omitting the olive oil and then moved it to the oven at 275 degrees for 15 minutes to let the cheese melt and tomato warm. Was a hit for our New Years gathering!

Deeelicious!!! I will definitely make this easy recipe again. Brings out the natural flavor of the asparagus but adds some yumminess with the Parmesan cheese. I will cut down on the olive oil (maybe by half) as I found it a little oily. But otherwise fantastic as is.

Left out the Parmesan, instead I lightly browned a bit of minced garlic and then added the tomatoes and asparagus. So simple to do, and delicious!

This was really good. After breaking off the woody ends of the asparagus, I cut them in two to three pieces and followed the directions as stated but added Lawry's Season Salt and some ground black pepper after added them to the pan with the drained asparagus and added the EVOO and Parmesan cheese. Very yummy. Thanks Caricooks.

Simple and delicious! We like adding shredded Parmesan just before removing from heat so it doesn't melt entirely.

Excellent! I didn't have olive oil so after I steamed the Asparagus I drained the water and added a heaping tablespoon of butter and sprinkled with  kosher salt. Otherwise followed the recipe  :)
Have made this several times now and I have been combining the asparagus, olive oil and 1/4 cup of water. Cover and bake at 350 for 10 mins. at 350, uncover and  add parmesan. return to oven  until  cheese is melted and a little browned., a few minutes.

I am a big asparagus lover so I was excited to make this. Unfortunately I just found it to be boring and bland. Added a little balsamic to it and didn't make much of a difference.

I made this dish last week, and it was a hit in our house. I did use slightly less olive oil and added about 10 sliced mushrooms in the beginning when steaming the asparagus. I also did what another person suggested and saved some cheese and sprinkled on after plated.  There's no need to salt this dish, as the cheese adds a lot of flavor. This is a very attractive dish and tasty too.

Void of sufficient seasoning.  However given its simplicity I expected as much and therefore was not disappointed.  I will make this again.

I wanted to spice up dinner for my Husband, I've gotten tired of making the same thing all the time, I made this tonight and it was a hit! Simple and delicious. It was great as is but I did add raspberry vinaigrette to it, and less oil. It went really good with the Parmesan cheese!!

This presented beautifully. It was a bit oily for my taste. I believe the oil should be halved and will add more tomatoes next time.

This is my favorite asparagus recipe! The asparagus is tender and the tomatoes really take out the bitterness. You could leave off the olive oil if you wanted to reduce the calories.

This is a great simple side dish especially since its asparagus season.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written except I cut the steaming time to 5 min. and added some fresh baby spinach leaves to the asparagus while it was steaming.  Will definitely do it again.  Thanks.

Nice and simple. I added a dash of sea salt. I only had jar Parmesan. Next time I'll be sure to use fresh Parmesan.

This recipe was super easy to make and was the best asparagus I've ever made.  I usually mess up other asparagus recipes that call for frying, broiling, or baking asparagus but not with this one.

Good overall, but it lacked a little salt.  I also added diced garlic for extra flavor. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the lack of seasoning.  On a side note: Don't let it steam more than 10 minutes, it will get too soft, almost mushy like.

This is very good.  I added julienned carrots as well. Very colorful.  Next time I make it I think I'll use a little less olive oil. It was a bit oily for my tastes.

This is excellent & very pretty! I didn't make any changes to the recipe except my parm was grated 'cause that's what I had. Bet it would be good with a dash of balsamic vinegar, though.

Loved it, I only made two small changes to the recipe. I added a few artichoke hearts (halved) and instead of evoo I used about 1/2 a cup of fat free italian dressing. It was wonderful. Thanks for the idea

YUM. Super easy and gorgeous. I used mozz because I'm not crazy about parmesan. This was a HUGE hit. I will be making this again soon! Thank you!
