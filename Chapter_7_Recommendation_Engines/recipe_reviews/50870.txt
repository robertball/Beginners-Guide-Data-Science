This is out of this world good!  I doubled the marinade for 2 lbs. of pork, but kept the amount of olive oil the same and always use low sodium soy sauce.  I added 2 tbsp. each of brown sugar and rice wine vinegar along with 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger.  I let this marinate for a full 24 hours.  With marinades, the longer the better some times.  I kept the basting sauce the same (didn't double) and used 3 Tbsp. of brown sugar.  It thickened up nicely.  I skewered the pork sepapate from the veggies and pineapple as they cook at different rates.  This went great with "Sesame Noodles" from this site.

These are awesome. I have made them twice now. The sauce is very good. Changes that improve the kabob experience: 1. Double the marinade and marinate the vegetables also 2. Make the skewers vegetable-only and meat-only. This helps with safe and even grilling. 3. I think that the marinade is still good if you reduce some of the oil (too greasy) and replace that liquid with rice vinegar. 
This is a great keeper, though! They smell and look delicious, and they reheat beautifully. I use chunk pineapple in the can (though I am sure fresh would be yummier), tomatoes, red onion, bell pepper, and portabella. Everyone enjoyed on rice. Thanks!

These kabobs had a great flavor and our guests loved them.  However, they do have a little kick.  If you don't like spice, I'd cut back on the red pepper in the marinade.  Also, the sauce was really salty when I first tasted it.  I was expecting it to be sweeter since it is called teriyaki.  I added more brown sugar until I got the flavor I wanted.

I made this exactly as stated and was pretty good.  The marinade was the best part, it had good flavor and was tender, hte chili peppper did give it a small kick.  The sauce was a little bland and I had just enough sauce to cover the kabobs with nothing left to baste them with which was ok because it was already seasoned with marinade.  Most of the sauce cooked off leaving moist kabobs lightly flavored.  I broiled the skewers in the oven and microwaved red potatoes, both were done in just 10 minutes.

Excellant! I ran out of soy sauce, so I used worchester instead, omitted the salt and increased the brown sugar to 2 tbs. Next time, we will use cherries instead of tomatoes. Also, next time we will cook the onions on a separate skewer and cook longer to make sure they aren't crunchy. All in all, a great grill dish!

This is the first review I am writing and it is because this was the most excellent pork kabobs ever!!! My man loved them...the pork was so tender, the sauce was superb( and there was plenty of it) and it was super easy to do. The marinade and sauce were perfect.The only thing I changed was instead of using red onions I used green bell peppers(don't care a whole lot for onions). They were beautiful and scrumptous. Will be making again and again and again!!!Thanks!!

We felt this was way too salty - and I like salty food.  I even used low sodium soy sauce along with the low sodium beef broth.  I did, however, marinade it overnight as opposed to three hours and maybe that played part.  I was also a little disappointed, probably my fault because I wasn't paying attention to the ingredients beforehand, but I was expecting something more BBQ-like, as in BBQ sauce.  "BBQ'D" Pork Teriyaki Kabobs would be a more accurate title.

This is a great recipe. Very tasty and easy to make. I had plenty of basting sauce as I BBQ'd the Kabobs. I will be making these again! I did add alot of pepper for a kick of my own.

All I can say is "WOW"!  The most tender pork we've ever had.  My husband said it's one of the best meals he's ever had, and definitely wants to have this again.  (I did omit the red pepper flakes.)

This is good. I added some lime juice to the marinade and doubled the glaze. I only used pork and pineapple on the kabobs, but sauteed some mushrooms seperatley in the glaze. Turned out great - thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was okay.  I really liked the marinade, however I didn't care for the beef broth sauce.  It really tasted just like thick beef broth.  I would leave that out next time and make more marinade to baste with.

I didn't like the tomatoes.  The sauce did taste too much like beef broth.  I added more brown sugar, and then it tasted like sweet beef broth.  I even used fresh ginger, but it didn't help.  In the end, I added some fish sauce and rice vinegar, and then it was okay, but not really good.  I think I will use bottled teriyaki in the future.

Way too salty if you marinade overnight. Not sure the pork would be tender enough if you only marinaded for 3 hours.

These were delicious!  I used pre-marinated Teriyaki Turkey simply because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great (and a little more healthy).  I served these with brown rice, mixing some of the basting sauce in for added flavor.  Definitely will use this recipe again!

These were delicious! I marinated for about 6 hours and basted with the extra sauce. I made the sauce as stated, except I grated fresh ginger into the marinade instead of using ground ginger. I will definitely be making these again!

This is a great recipe for kabobs, especially for summertime when you can get fresh pineapple readily. I don't use tomatoes on my kabobs - just green pepper, onion, and pineapple along with the pork. Yummy. Make sure you add a little sesame oil for an added taste boost.

These are wonderful! We substituted some of the extras on the kabobs because of the taste of company we had over. The glaze that goes on while grilling is really spectacular. We fixed them with red potatoes and the Eggplant and Zucchini casserole on this website. Very tasty!

This was good and easy.  Substituted one tbls of olive oil with sesame and added a tbls of rice wine vinegar to marinade.  Family liked extra basting sauce kept on side for white rice.  Still like the marinade for flank steak on this site better though.  Can be used on steak, chix or pork for outstanding results.

Best pork I have ever had. I did add chili sauce and a tbsp of rice vinegar....and I just cooked up the left over marinade to baste. I used pork tenderloin and like I said, it was the best I have ever had. SOoooo tender and moist.

Fairly good, though be careful to keep the basting sauce warm, otherwise it forms a skin. Removed the red onion as I don't care for it, and served the kabobs on rice with a crunchy salad.

This is a great recipe for pork! I used whatever veggies I had on hand for the kabobs and made each person their own to accomodate likes and dislikes. This one is a keeper ~ and I didn't make any changes for once!

GREAT flavor and easy!  Used beef sirloin instead of pork and the crushed red pepper was perfect (I was a little worried at 1/2 tsp).    I did up the brown sugar to 3TBSP as some readers recommended, crushed the garlic and used fresh ginger, and it made a lot of sauce, I would cut sauce in half next time.

Yummmmm!  Pork never tasted so good!  I marinated my pork for about eight hours and it was amazingly tender.  I used fresh pineapple, red bell peppers and red onion on my skewers with the pork.  The sauce is terrific as well.  This is a great dish for a small dinner party on the patio....looks impressive but with minimal work!

This is probably my favorite pork recipe. Absolutely delicious! I altered slightly per other reviews. Added a small scoop of brown sugar and a couple shakes of ginger to the marinade. Also, I doubled the marinade ingredients except for the oil. I used 2 TBS of olive oil and 1 TBS of sesame oil. Marinated 24 hours and skewered the pork alone - no veggies on the skewers. 
I mixed together the sauce but didn't baste the pork while grilling. I actually used the sauce as a dipping sauce for the pork. The sauce would also be delicious on white rice which I will try next time I make this recipe. 
I served with an assortment of fresh veggies I marinated in Teriyaki sauce for about 4 hours and grilled in a grill pan. 
I will make again - and soon!

Excellent.  Meat very tender.  Only problem was tomatoes.  They cook before everything else.  Will use red peppers next time.

Really great! I followed the advice of the other comments and used low sodium soy sauce and honestly found myself adding a little salt later. Really great flavor though, my family loved it!

This is OMG good!  I got things going ahead of time, but ended up not cooking last night, so I combined the sauce ingredients with the pork and marinade in the bag until tonight. I just skewered the pork with pineapple chunks and basted the kabobs while grilling. So, so, so good!  I will definitely double or triple it up next time and serve the sauce over some rice. The only negative was there were no left-overs for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks for this winner!

Delicious! this is a keeper!!! I marinated over night.  I packed extra meat on the end of the skewers because I ran out of skewers. Keep meat pieces spaced out in order to cook through. I doubled the marinate recipe due to the amount of meat I used, but the basting sauce didn't need to be doubled. So good!

Easy and absolutely delicious.....since I used big hunks of pork, I put my veggies on a different skewer because of the different times in cooking.  I also basted the veggies with the same sauce used on the pork.  I would definitely fix this again and I am also referring it to my friends.

15 minutes was WAY too long to cook these skewers - 8 - 10 mins would have been better so making note for next time.  These were so overcooked it was like eating pork jerky.  Other than that, they were easy to put together and had great flavor potential so will be making again. Hubby liked them well enough. Just need to be wary of following cooking times without checking the food often.

This was a great marinade! I have used both a pork roast as well as a tenderloin cut into cubes.  Both were amazing. I boiled the extra marinade and put it in ramekin dishes for each person to use for extra dipping!

I made these once as directed while pork was on sale and they were okay. I had kabobs in the past with cherry tomatoes and did not like how they tasted, as well as the way they tend to burn your tongue when you bite into them. I decided it had been awhile and I would give them another shot, which turned out to be a bad decision. The thing with cherry tomatoes is more of a personal preference; however, my only qualm with the recipe itself was the sauce, that in my opinion did not add anything, other than a mess on the grill. This week chicken was on sale so I made these again with chicken, leaving out the tomatoes as well as the sauce. This time I felt like it was a much more enthusiastic “okay,” but still just okay nonetheless. If I made these again, which I do not think I will, I would make it like I did the second time, except replace 1 tbs of the marinade for the meat with sesame oil to give it a bit more of an Asian flavor.

Amazing! The marinade was perfect and gave the meat a nice kick that was complimented well by the sweet teriyaki sauce. I made extra sauce but it wasn’t necessary. I used chicken broth because it’s all I had. Just FYI, I did only marinate for 3 hours and it had a perfect salty flavor too. So don’t marinate it too long because I bet it would be too salty.

We loved this recipe.   I marinated it overnight.   But the sauce was the key.   It kept the kabobs from getting dry and building up the flavor.

This was very good and very well received by my family.  I added red pepper chunks to the kabobs and served these with fried rice and chow mein noodles.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought this was very good and very easy to do, I too, used low sodium soy sauce but thought it was a little salty. It was very tender and the sauce had a great taste.

This had so much flavor!  I love grilling in the summer using fresh ingredients.  I made as the recipe stated with the addition of fresh ginger over ground.   I also left out the salt since I was using soy sauce.

Very good.  Did not make kabobs but used it for a marinade for a pork loin.  Made the basting sauce and used that while it was grilling.

This was so easy to make and just plain yummy. Even my 4 year old liked it, he actually asked for more.  
I doubled the marinade for 2 lbs. pork but kept the sauce as is and it worked great.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I marinated the pork all day. It was soo tender. The basting sauce was great. I did do separate skewers a vege one and meat one as previously mentioned in a review. Really good.

GREAT recipe as written. I will make again but will marinate veggies and pork together first.
