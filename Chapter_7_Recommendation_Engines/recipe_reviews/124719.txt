The first time I made these they were so wet and messy i threw them away!  But they sound SO~~  Good that I had to give them another shot!   This time I upped the cooking time and measured the banana out exactly.  I also substituted chocolate chips for the nut (Per my husband's request) and used three heaping TBLS of cocoa and they turned out perfect.
  OF COURSE THEY HAVE A BANANA FLAVOR!  They're "Banana Nut Brownies"  if they were "raspberry brownies" you'd expect a raspberry flavor wouldn't you?  These are really great, gooey, chocolatey, brownies with a nice banana flavor!

Amazing! Yum. This is what i changed: 2 T of milk, 1 1/2 t vanilla, 3 heaping T of cocoa, AND about 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Also used Jumbo eggs for more moisture. My bf and i could sit and eat the whole pan while they are warm.

PERFECT.  I had a ripe bannana, was craving chocolate, and didn't know if "banana brownies" existed. I searched for it here, found this 1 recipe, and it's PERFECT. Excellent texture, excellent flavor.  It's GREAT.

The recipe makes a dense, moist cake-like bar, but it would require twice as much cocoa to mask the banana flavor. If I make this one again, I'll use only one banana and more cocoa.

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe, had a little less banana than called for, but added a little more cocoa.  This is now on my "make regularly!" list.

Great brownies...super moist-I did leave them in longer than the recommended time though, just to make sure the inside was done and to get a nice crispy edge around the outside.  Very banana-y tasting, if you love bananas, but also chocolatey and the walnuts give them a little bit of a crispy texture. We really enjoyed these....

Thought these were easy and fabulous!  I heaped the tablespoons of cocoa and measured the mashed bananas as recommended by other cooks.  Mine only took 45 minutes to cook and I probably could have taken them out at 40 minutes because they were more cakey than fudgy.  But still tasty!

These are delicious!  So moist!  The cocoa makes it a brownie, but it definately is a banana item.  I'll make this again.  I doubled the reciped and baked in a large cookie sheet.  They baked in 25 minutes.  I took them to a picnic and they were a hit!

I didn't add the cocoa, substituted pecans for walnuts and spread on homemade peanut butter frosting after they cooled. (1/4 cup of PB, half of banana (mashed) with 1 to 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar and a little milk) YUMMY! Bananas and peanut butter - what a yummy combo!

I agree this is more of a cake-like texture, but very moist with the banana. Instead of walnuts, I added dark chocolate chips with macadamia nuts.

I just made these brownies and they're absolutely amazing! Definitely more cake-like than dense fudge, but I love their light texture. I added chocolate chips as well which goes well with the nuts and banana. If you like banana and chocolate, this is an amazing recipe!

This recipe sounded good so I gave it a try but I personally don't like the way it turned out.  It has a texture between that of cake and brownies but I'd rather have one or the other.  My husband who usually eats up all of my baked goods only had one piece and didn't touch it again.  But I'm not saying this is a bad recipe or that it tastes bad and that's why I still gave it 4 stars. If you're looking for that kind of texture and like all the ingredients go for it!

I was excited to try this recipe but when I tasted them I was let down. Not sure why. Others who had them liked them and my dish was empty and saw none in the trash can so they couldn't have been that bad. I might try them again.

Should of wrote it months ago. From first time I'd tried this recipe it became number one for my wife and daughter. Sometimes they ask me and I make'it three times in a row. Sometimes I'm omitting cocoa and it comes out with softer taste. I do tend to add tsp of brandy/malibu rum for flavour. Many thanks for this recipe.

I wouldn't call these "brownies" - they are more like a cake and very similar to an apple walnut cake that my mom makes. I added a few extra tablespoons of cocoa, used canola oil instead of butter, left out the nuts and added chocolate chips.  I would not make this again unless I find a way to make it less greasy (sub applesauce or yogurt?), but it did have a good flavor.

A great tasting brownie, and different from your average recipe is what I liked most about the Banana Brownies.  After I baked them while still warm I spread powdered sugar on top then after they cooled I topped them with Duncan Hines cream cheese icing, and spread additional walnuts over the top it really complimented the taste.

The taste was okay but the texture was really bad, this turns out like a soggy cake, not a moist brownie.  Even my kids who love banana chocolate chip muffins couldn't tolerate this recipe, find something else to try!

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes due to dietary needs within my family but it seems to have come out excellent. I substituted whole wheat cake a pastry flour for the all purpose flour. I used 1/2 cup organic cane sugar and 1/2 sucanat for the 1 cup of sugar. Instead of 1/2 cup melted butter I used a jar of baby prunes. I couldn't add the nuts as my husband is allergic :( but I'm sure they would taste wonderful! I had to bake them an extra 10 mins, probably due to all the changes I made. Nice texture, fairly healthy treat. Thanks for the recipe.

As I was making the batter, i didn't realize my oven had died! I ended up microwaving the brownies for about 10 minutes on high. It was very moist and cakey, I actually think it was slightly underdone. The flavor was really nice, though. I had used 1/4 cup of cocoa, and it was a great chocolate/banana combination.

I had a craving for brownies and a couple of brown bananas sitting around, so this recipe seemed like it was meant to happen.  It turned out pretty good, but . . . .  You CAN taste the banana -- it's not a bad taste, but you can taste it.  And it turns out as more of a cake-like brownie, whereas I like a fudge-like brownie.

Tasty! I didn't change anything. Make sure they're still a little gooey in the middle when you take them out of the oven. These are best when eaten warm.
