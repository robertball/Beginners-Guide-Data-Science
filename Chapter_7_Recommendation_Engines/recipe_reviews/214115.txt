Yummy.  My grandma used to make a fresh strawberry pie sort of like this, so I thought I'd add a few of her tricks.  For one thing, I used a regular pie crust, poked it with a fork, and baked it before adding the filling.  Graham crackers just seemed a little off.  My favorite thing that she did was spread 4 ounces of cream cheese on the warm crust before placing in the halved fresh strawberries.  To me this is a MUST!  I also threw in some blueberries because I was a little short on strawberries.  My husband and I loved this pie.  It's a hard one to mess up-- just be patient and make sure that glaze is nice and thick, stirring it constantly!!  I posted pictures to show the nice color added by the blueberries.  This was a pretty pie.

Very disappointing. The combination of a graham cracker crust with strawberry rhubarb  was not to my taste. Definitely needs more rhubarb. Added a whole cup and still could not tell there was rhubarb in it. The layer of strawberries on the bottom did very little to enhance the flavor or texture of the pie. Was very easy to make and it did set up beautifully.

My family loved this but I made one change and would make one more next time.  I omitted the rhubarb because we don't really like it, and increased the strawberries in the sauce by 1/2 cup.  If I made it again, I would bake the crust for 15 minutes to set it up better.  It's tough to serve and leaves behind most of the crumbs.  Still, we loved it and will make it again.

This was a fantastic recipe.The only thing different I did was add a 10 oz frozen bag of chopped rhubarb.I like the tart taste.I also used prebaked pie shells.Taste just like my mom used to make.Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe (for once!) and it was beautiful, tasty, and gone in a flash.  Topped with fresh whipped cream, this pie was refreshing and because I could make it ahead and not heat the house by turning on the oven----it's a summertime keeper!

I have been making this type pie for many years using just strawberries (no rhubarb) and then topping with whipped topping. Very easy and good but you need a lot of strawberries ( about 2 large boxes). I use whole strawberries standing on end in the shell and cover with the mashed strawberry syrup. Excellent and keeps in refrigerator if you have any leftovers.

This recipe really doesn't have enough rhubarb to give it the zest a real strawberry rhubarb pie should have. It was easy to make and the filling did set up well; but the flavor just wasn't there.

I modified/cheated a bit and used packaged pastry. It turned out to be a phenomenal pie and a huge hit. I am going to make it again tonight.

This is an easy to make and delicious recipe! The only change I made was adding 2 cups of rhubarb and cutting it down to 1/2 cup of sugar because in my opinion the pie was too sweet, and I enjoy the tartness of rhubarb. Also make sure that the filling is very thick because I don't think I cooked the filling long enough and it was very watery. You'll probably need to upgrade to a 10 inch pie crush to accomodate the extra rhubarb. Other than that, great recipe!

Because the berries were so sweet, I used 2tb domino light, ( sugar/stevia sweetener) instead of 3/4 cup reg sugar.
Will cook the rhubarb and water a little before adding the rest of the ingredients.
Was delightfully tart with berries and rhubarb equal in flavor.

It did not work for me as a pie it was too crumbly.  But I served it in some ramekins.  It was sweet and tart at the same time.  Easy.   Will make again.

DELICIOUS AND EASY. I made it with both graham cracker crust and regular pie crust. My family could not decide which was better. I doubled rhubarb like many others

Very easy and delicious!  I had about one and a half cups of rhubarb in the freezer, I just added it all with the strawberries and increased the sugar bu a couple of tablespoons to offset.  This made two pies that I brought to Thanksgiving dinner at the in laws, and it was a big hit.  I will make this again!

Fabulous!!  This was my first time making this kind of pie and I thought it turned out great.  My husband and kids said it was delicous.  I used a store bought graham cracker crust and added some extra strawberries and rhubarb because we had ALOT of both from our garden.  I kept all other ingredients and directions as stated and the pie came out great (set perfectly).  Will definitely make this again.
