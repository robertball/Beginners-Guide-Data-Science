I'm Dawn's husband, Kevin.  For over 20 years, I've been the winner.  Dawn puts so much into her cooking and loves putting new dishes in front of us all the time.  The Carmel Macchiato Cheesecake is another in a long line of great recipes Dawn has come up with.  It's the best desert I've had and, thanks to Dawn, I've had a lot of great deserts!

The first time I made this recipe, I overbeat it and didn't use a waterbath. The cheesecake rose while baking, then fell and cracked. It was the ugliest thing I'd ever made! I ended up cutting off the high edges to make it level, then covered the top with a chocolate ganache. Everyone loved it! I've made it two times since and it has turned out beautifully each time. Don't overbeat your cheesecake, and bake it in a water bath (see instructions on baking a cheesecake). The ganache is still a nice complement--scald a cup of heavy cream, then pour it over 1 1/2 cups of chopped chocolate. Let it sit for 5 mins, then stir until melted. Add 1 tsp. of vanilla, stir, and pour /spread on top of cheesecake.

This cheesecake was absolutely incredible! I went to Starbucks and asked for a quadruple shot of espresso, used 1/4 cup for the recipe, then froze the rest in an ice cube tray to use for iced mochas.  I baked it in a water bath, and when the hour was up, I turned off the oven and left the cheescake in the oven to cool for a few hours.  Absolutely no cracks!  I made it a couple of days ahead so the flavors had time to mature, and served it with drizzled caramel and whipped cream, just like in the picture.

Creamy and smooth, and absolutely decadent with homemade caramel. Make sure to bake the cheesecake in a water bath for that perfect texture. If you can manage not to eat it all at once, the individual slices freeze and defrost really nicely -- just make sure they're wrapped really well in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. 30-60 minutes out of the freezer, and a divine treat without all the prep!

Wow! If you love cheesecake and you love caramel and coffee flavors then this cheesecake is for you! I mean this is one fabulous dessert! It just doesn't get much better than this.  There's just enough coffee flavor in here so it's not overpowering and just subtle enough to really come through and compliment the caramel topping.  The richness and creaminess of the cheesecake is well...as one of my guests put it "to die for".  I always bring my ingredients to room temperature before mixing and don't overbeat - plus do a waterbath to avoid cracks.  I topped it with homemade whipped cream and it was beyond delicious! Thanks for a great recipe Dawn!

This. Was. Amazing.  After reading some reviews, I opted for crushing chocolate teddy grahams for the crust and added 1 tsp instant espresso granules to the crust. I also doubled the espresso in the filling, and added 2 Tbsp caramel.  I took the suggestion of placing the springform pan on a muffin tin pan filled with water, and I left it in the oven a few hours after turning it off. It turned out perfectly!  So smooth and cream, no cracks, and a wonderful blend of flavors!  

I topped with homemade caramel - melt 1 stick butter and 1 C brown sugar, boiling about 5 minutes until smooth.  Turn off heat and add 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla and enough evaporated milk until it reaches desired consistency - about 1/2 cup (will thicken as it cools).

Made this for Christmas Eve and it was delicious!!! Everyone loved it and thought it was sore bought! I did put a tsp. of cinnamon in the crust. I also wrapped the bottom of the springform pan with aluminium foil and baked it in a water bath to prevent cracking and to cook more evenly. It turned out great!

I made this recipe but split it over 2 ready-made crusts..I wonder if splitting the filling (which made the cheesecake part thinner) took away from the taste.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe, but I thought that there were 2 things that I would fix for next time: it needs more coffee flavor (even though I used very very strong coffee and added instant coffee granules to the batter) and it needs to be just a little bit sweeter, so I might add 1/3 cup more sugar next time.  As for the caramel, I made my own (sugar, water, lemon juice, and heavy cream) and I really think that homemade caramel made it extra special.

This is the most awesome cheesecake I ever had! I didn't change a thing! For some reason most of the reviews are always how people changed them before they even try it the way the recipe says and then give a review on the changed version of the recipe. I will definitely be making this cake often just the way it is! Thank you so much for the recipe.

I gave this recipe four instead of five because I think the coffee taste could be stronger.  I used bold instant coffee and doubled the manufacturer's amount (which came out to be 1/2 tsp for 1/4 cup).  Next time I will add 1 tsp for 1/4 cup.  You absolutely must use a water bath with HOT water when you put it in the oven (I heated a tea kettle and placed the cake plus pan on the oven rack then poured the hot water into the pan in the oven).  I did not have a spring form pan with me, so I used a traditional cake pan with these modifications: cut a circle of wax paper and placed it at the bottom below the crust, sprayed the sides with non-stick baking spray, after baking and counter-cooling I sprayed some plastic wrap with non-stick baking spray then covered the cake, after chilling I then used a tray + plate to flip the cake out and then flip it right-side up and gently remove the plastic wrap.  The cheesecake came out beautifully.  No cracks, no sinking, no browning.

This is a great recipe and it turned out great! I had to make some small changes based on what I had. My graham crackers were stale, so I used Trader Joes Ginger Cat Cookies for the crust. The recipe calls for too much butter in the crust. It is too much regardless of the crumbs you decide to use and you may find butter dripping from the bottom of your springform and causing smoke in your oven. You can cut the butter in half easily. I used Godiva Pumpkin Spice coffee and made it strong for the coffee portion of the recipe. I opted to make some homemade caramel sauce for the top instead of store bought. Just minor changes, but this is a fantastic, moist, cheesecake everyone will rave about!

Cheesecake got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. Changed servings to 18 to accommodate a 10" springform pan. Also added extra espresso to taste (we're a family of coffee drinkers) and used a sea salt caramel topping.

This cheesecake was delicious.  The only thing that I did differently was add a couple of squares of a 90% Chocolate bar to it that I had available.  It was so smooth.  As with any cheesecake recipe bring the eggs and cream cheese to room temperature and only beat the eggs in until just mixed.  Mine had no cracks or bubbles.

I have a few problems with this recipe.  First, if you have it without the caramel, you can taste the coffee.  It's a delicate flavor but definitely there.  To achieve this flavor I bought some decaf french roast and double brewed it on the strong setting.  (I am sensitive to caffeine but love the flavor of coffee.)  But once you add the caramel, it overpowers the flavor and it's much harder to taste.  Second, the baking time is wrong.  I've made cheesecakes a few times and usually I bake at 350 for 40-50 minutes.  But given that the ingredients in this one had added liquid from coffee and a full cup of sour cream, I thought I should do as the author instructed and did it at 325 for 1hr and 5 mins.  My cheesecake was overcooked.  A cheesecake should not appear browned anywhere and the top of mine was getting browned after an hour.  I did bake it in a water bath, even with that I had this odd experience of it not sinking in the middle but rather it was high along the edge with a dip just inside that then rose to the center. I also did everything I could not to over beat. The cheesecake was also not smooth and creamy - perhaps this was in part due to being over baked.  For my preference, the crust is also double what I needed.  What saved this for me was the caramel sauce, but mine was not store bought.  With the addition of a nice caramel sauce, I would give it 3 stars.  As written it is a 2 star recipe.  It sounds nice, but falls short of what it promises.

O.K. Made this last night in preparation for today's annual first quarter parent/teacher conference teacher dinner, in which parents provide dinner for the teachers who are stuck at school from 8am-8pm. Anyway, so I was "assigned" dessert. Since I'm famous for cheesecake these days, and I've been looking at this recipe for months, I decided to try it. This made the ugliest cheesecake I have ever made... but that was my own fault - I tried to marble in some caramel, but I just ended up with cracks the size of the Grand Canyon. I almost didn't bring it - made a strawberry-banana cake as back-up - but when I looked at my lonely, cracked caramel macchiato cheesecake in the fridge, the one for which I went to Outpost Natural Foods to pick up the best Espresso this side of the Mississippi, I knew I had to do something with it... especially after I sampled a slice. This cheesecake tasted TOO GOOD not to share. So, I strapped on my apron, whipped up some vanilla whipped cream, added a delicately thin layer to the top of the cheesecake, and drizzled it with caramel sauce. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! Perfect creamy caramel espresso flavor.

I used vanilla wafers for the crust, added 3 T caramel sauce to the filling, and had to use a little bit of plain yogurt because I didn't have enough sour cream. Other than that, followed the recipe to a T. Definitely a cheesecake I'll be making again... just not with the caramel ribbon.

First of all I'd like to mention that there is a VIDEO of the creator of this recipe making the recipe on youTube in which she not only makes the recipe but shows you step by step how to do a water bath. This Cheesecake is DIVINE! I made some slight changes but I don't think they made much of a difference into the final DELICIOUS result of this fabulous and smart recipe. The only changes I made were , I added 1Tb of cinnamon sugar to the crust, I replaced 1/2TS of the vanilla extract for almond extract (Since I was using Carmel/Vanilla flavored coffee) and I didn't want to potentially ruin the cake so just to test the waters I swirled into HALF of the cheesecake (in the center) 2 Tbs of the Carmel topping and that half turned out delicious as well although I preferred the Carmel on top. There was one small crack in the middle of mine but I didn't do the water-bath thing as I ran out of foil paper. It still looked great and I will submit a picture later. Some said the coffee flavor wasn't enough but it was perfect for me, I just made some Vanilla/Carmel flavored coffee with DOUBLE of the amount of grinds you're supposed to use, and on top of that added a TS of instant coffee  (I would wait until the coffee cools a bit as it might cook the eggs if you put it in hot) halfway through baking my entire house smelled like a Carmel Macchiato! Make this recipe, you wont regret it!

Amazing! One of the best cheesecakes I have ever had. I used 1/3 cup of espresso and added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the graham cracker crust. I topped it with caramel cooled for an hour then added ganache. Delicious!

The best cheesecake I have ever tasted!  I made this for a coworkers birthday and it disappeared.  Served it with PC butterscotch - ridiculous! Used a water bath to bake, left it in the oven with the door open for 1.5 - 2 hours to cool, left it on counter to get to room temp (or near it) about 1 hour, then to the fridge - no cracks, light creamy crazy.

People are raving about this as I write this review! I brought this in to work today and everyone is LOVING it. I followed the recipe, but changed the method... since I didn't want to do a water bath but I didn't want to risk it cracking, I decided to bake it at 300'. Worked like a charm. It took longer (about 75 minutes). I turned off the oven, shoved a potholder in the door to keep it cracked open, and let it cool. Set it in the fridge overnight, and voila! =)  I made a caramel sauce to go with it and it looks great! **In the future, I might try using a smaller pan or adding more cream cheese to make it taller... and I might add more coffee. but it's wonderful as-is!! Glad I finally made it!!

This was perfect...followed to directions to a T and came out great.  I did put a pie place full of water on the bottom shelf of my over to prevent the cheesecake from cracking and it worked....next time i will add a bit more coffee or even instant coffee to make the coffee flavor stronger.

This is the second time I have made this cheesecake in 2 weeks. I make one every weekend ( a different flavor each time). This was one of the family's favorite. The first time I made it without the shot of coffee. I also poured half the batter in the crust, and then added about 1/4 C store bought caramel sauce, then added the remaining batter, and topped it off with swirls of more caramel sauce, being sure to use a knife and swirl it all together for a great presentation--so it was a caramel cheesecake. The 2nd time we used the coffee, and we made homemade caramel sauce. The 2nd one was better by far (both are very good), and we still added the caramel after pouring half the filling in, then adding remaining and topping with more caramel, then used a knife for a swirl effect. Gorgeous and very delicious!! LOVE IT!

Nothing should be this good!!  If you love coffee and cheesecake...this recipe is for you!  My family LOVES Starbucks coffee, so I used 2 packets of Via Colombia in 1/4 cup of water and it was just right for us. Dawn, thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe!!

This was really yummy.  I left out the coffee and instead put about 3 T. of the caramel topping into the cake batter.  Also, once the batter was in the crust, but before it was baked, I drizzled some caramel topping over the top and swirled it around with a knife.  It looked beautiful once it was baked.  It won second place in a baking contest. :)

Wonderful texture and flavor...and I personally liked it best without the enhancements of whipped cream and caramel. Some time ago I came across an allrecipes reviewer that filled a pan of boiling water and placed it on a rack beneath the cheesecake while cooking as a less complicated alternative to the water bath and I've been using it ever since for all cheesecakes. It worked like a charm here. The cheesecake did not crack and the texture was perfect. Do follow the recipe's refrigeration instructions though...I cheated and had my first piece only 2 hours after refrigerating and I must admit, I wasn't all that impressed. Then I had it for breakfast the next day (yeah, shameful, I know :P) and it was 100 times better! This cheesecake is a keeper!

This is my new favorite cheesecake! I made a salted caramel and swirled it in as well as drizzling it over the top. Made fresh whipped cream...wow! Only other change was to add some cinnamon to the graham cracker crust.

This was outstanding. I got 4 shots of espresso from the coffee shop but then got confused on how much to use. Recipe calls for 1/4c and video calls for 4 shots. I ended up using 1/4c and used the other 1/4c to make another one the next day!What a hit! We cut & froze leftovers and when thawed tastes just like it did the day it was made. Thanks for our new Keeper!

I used 1/4cup double strength espresso. Baked in a waterbath. The result was a beautifull cake !!! 
A delicious moccha cheesecake for coffee-lovers. This got very mixed reviews: my boyfriend loves coffee, but didn't finish his piece.... And my mom who isn't the worlds biggest coffee-drinker, loved the cake.
It definately needs a caramel sauce - without the sauce it's quite boring. 
Loved the experience, but probably won't be making this again.

OH MY GOD... This is the BEST cheesecake EVER! It was quite a hit with the family AND my 80 year old mother. I was told by several it was the best cheesecake they had EVER tasted. I baked it in a gas oven and had to add about 25 mins to the cook time, testing with a thermometer. I also used the water bath method. It turned out PERFECT with no cracking. Definitely recommend!

I love caramel macchiatos, but this recipe was missing something.  It didn't have the strong espresso flavor i was looking for, nor did it have enough caramel to my liking.  It was still pretty good, but not exceptional.  If i make it again, I will definately think about getting 1/2 c espresso and adding a lot of caramel to the batter, maybe in swirls and layers.

I think this is an AMAZING cheesecake! I love coffee and caramel! However there are a few changes that I make to the recipe.  When making the crust I add in brown sugar and cinnamon (it's sooo good!).  Then for the caramel topping I boil sweetend condensed milk for 3 hours then carefully spread this topping onto the cheesecake.  It is a beautiful outcome, I always get rave reviews!!

Want a LOWFAT LOWCARB version? I used a crust of 1-1/2 cups toasted pecans, 2 tbl soy flour, 2 tbl Splenda ground in food processor. Add one egg white. Press in pan and bake 350 for 15 minutes. (Blaine's Low Carb Kitchen recipe) For the filling, I used lowfat cream cheese (One 8 ounce pkg.), lowfat sourcream (8 ounces), one egg, 1/3 cup sugar. For the topping, I took sugar free cool whip and mixed in a little caramel syrup and layered it on thick. YUM!

My kids have insisted on Oreo cheesecakes forever, but my now-empty nest allowed me to stray to this divine dessert. I made it exactly as stated, after watching the video and using the water bath, and everyone raved. Thank goodness there were 10 of us to share, or the husband and I would have eaten the whole thing. I shocked to see a cheesecake without cracks (I use to hide my cracked cheesecakes under whipped cream for the kids), and the presentation was gorgeous with the caramel sauce. I did see lots of butter dripping from my pan, but the foil wrapping for the water bath kept it from burning in my oven. I also bougt a triple espresso at Starbucks for the coffee, but may experiment with instant espresso next time. Oh yes, there will be a next time!  Thanks, Dawn!

DAWN, YOU ROCK!
I made this for Easter.  Double foil wrapped it and baked in a water bath.  Not only was it picture perfect -- it was OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD delicious.  I will definitely make this again and again.  (NOTE:  15 whole graham cracker slabs = 2 cups of crumbs)  Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good! Use half the sugar, you don't need a full cup. With the caramel on top & whipped cream it's plenty sweet. But definitely a keeper ;)

Delicious in every way. Followed some users' advice, and put some caramel sauce in the actual cheesecake itself. Used instant coffee granules to make the coffee. This cheesecake is legit.

I made this over the weekend to take to a party.  I've never made a cheesecake in my life.  To my surprise it was not that difficult and I had great results.  It did crack on top, and I was sad when it happened.  After reading other reviews, I'll have to learn more about a water bath for cheesecakes.  Did not change the flavor, and all who tasted it raved about it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The flavor of this cheesecake is fabulous. I combined 20 caramels and evaporated milk, cooked over low heat, stirring, until smooth, it was an idea from this site (chocolate caramel cheesecake). This sauce was very tender, it wasn`t necessary to buy caramel sauce in a store. I used 1/4 cup brewed coffee and this cheesecake had real coffee flavour. The cheesecake was very tender, light and delicious. Definetily I`ll be making it again. Highly recommended!

I made this exactly as written and took it to our Thanksgiving get together, I should have made two! This was by far the favorite dessert out of all of them (and there were a lot of desserts). Will be making this again for Christmas day when the family and friends comes over.

I made this for a dinner with my son and his friend and we all loved it! If cheesecake wasn't so filling (and we hadn't just eaten a huge meal), it would have been gone. I used a really good local coffee in it, brewed strong, and topped it with Stonewall Kitchen coffee caramel sauce. O. M. G. I almost feel guilty over how easy it was to make. It sunk... and cracked, but this only created the perfect spot for a coffee caramel lake! Next time, if I want to make it pretty, I'll follow another reviewer's suggestion to use a water bath and to not over-beat it. There WILL be a next time, though.

Made this for my sister as she loves cheesecake and caramel macchiatos. Topped this with homemade caramel sauce to make it even more decadent. The cheesecake turned out creamier than traditional cheesecake but the overall flavor was perfect. Didn't even need whipped cream.

Great flavor and texture, baked up perfect with a bowl of water placed on the lower shelf. Thanks for the yummy recipe. Only wish it would have had a recipe to make the caramel sauce to go along with it. Instead I opened a container of dulce de leche and thinned it.

Fabulous! I used strong coffee instead of espresso and it tasted great.

Nice consistency.  For coffee flavour, need stronger coffee.  Water bake method.

Since I used an 8 1/2 inch springform pan, I changed the crust to 1-1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup softened butter, 1/4 teaspoon each nutmeg & cinnamon.  After the cheesecake was refrigerated, I added about 1/2 cup finely chopped & toasted pecans to the top & left off the caramel, since friends were anxious to eat.  Following the advice previously given, got espresso from Starbucks.  Everyone loved.  Wonderful flavor.

my family and I love this cheesecake!!! I have made non-cheesecake lovers into cheesecake lovers with this recipe but of course i make a couple tweeks to perfect it... I know it might sound lazy but I rather buy pre-made graham craker crusts but I always get chocolate because it adds a different flavor. I also add double brewed french vanilla coffe intead of strong coffee... it adds so much flavor to it. I have made this recipe for thanksgiving, chritsmas and I am making it today for New Years and every time I get compliments for the cheesecake. thank you OP for a great recipe!

While most people seemed to enjoy this cheesecake, I think it was the homemade caramel sauce they were mostly tasting. The cheesecake itself was good, creamy, but lacking in coffee flavor. Also, note: definitely not a good dessert to serve if there are children around. I got a yuck face and a "is there anything else for dessert?" question.

I made this exactly as instructed and the whole family and several friends enjoyed it! At first I didn't think I would have enough graham cracker crust because I used a 10-inch springform pan instead of 9. But it tasted great. The kids had fun spraying whipped cream and drizzling caramel sauce over their own pieces. Thank you for the recipe. It's a keeper!!!!

I have been wanting to make this for a very long time and I finally did. WOW I am glad I did, I'm sorry I waited so long too.  This was soooooo yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out so delicious.  I baked it in the water bath and it came out perfect! I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful cheesecake.  I work at a coffee house and this is one of our top selling desserts.  I have made it many times and it always comes out perfect.   Don't forget the dish of water on the bottom shelf of the oven to prevent unwanted cracking.

I made this cheesecake  this past wednesday for my boyfriend.. He loves starbucks caramel macchiato drink & this tasted just like it!!! I dont enjoy coffee flavored things such as ice cream & ect, but this was soo good I ate seconds!! I also went to starbucks and ordered a tripple shot of exspresso & then cooked the cheesecake in a water bath and then turned the oven off and allowed the cake to sit in there an additional 15-30 mins! I had no cracks and it came out beautiful!

This was awesome. I'm not the biggest fan of coffee but I wanted a change from regular cheesecake and this fit the bill perfectly! I made Praline Sundae Topping (also found on this site, but omitted the nuts) and used it over the cheesecake slices instead of store bought caramel sauce. I also drizzled some slices with chocolate. Both versions were delish and I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this cheesecake for my adult daughter's birthday this weekend. She wanted something other than a traditional birthday cake.  And when I told her about this recipe, being a Starbuck's addict, her mouth started watering just thinking about it.  The outcome--my husband normally doesn't like cheesecake and our son-in-law doesn't drink or like coffee.  The four of us rate this a 5+ as THE best cheesecake if not THE best dessert we have ever had.  And we are all dessert connoisseurs!!  I used two shots of espresso from the local coffee house, and for the 3 pkgs of cream cheese I used two lowfat and one regular.  It was simply decadent!!!  Definitely a keeper in my recipe file!

Absolutely wonderful! So smooth and fluffy and delicious! Everyone loves this cake. It baked up beautifully in the times and temp in the recipe. No water bath needed and no cracks in the cheesecake. Thank you for this one, Dawn!

All I can say is, LOVE IT!!  I've been making cheesecake for years, and I was soooo happy to see the suggestion of sitting the spring form pan on top of a muffin tin filled with water as your "water bath". How easy is that?! And it works! Also followed other reviewer's thoughts on the cinnamon in the crust, using strong espresso from a coffee shop, and leaving it in the turned off oven with door slightly propped open for another hour. Creamy cake, no cracking.  I also, due to dietary issues, made mine like I always do with Tofutti brand Better than Cream Cheese for the cheese and their Sour Supreme (both non-dairy products) and everyone loves it.  You would never know it's not dairy.  Thank you Dawn for this wonderful recipe.  Coffee and caramel, what's not to love?!

I let the cheesecake bake in a waterbath and it came out with no cracks! The cheesecake came out very rich and luscious! I don't have an expresso machine so I just ordered a double shot at Starbucks and it came out with a great coffee flavor.

Made this for an office luncheon and it was a big hit.  I used the lower fat cream cheese, low fat sour cream, sugar free caramel and light whipped cream.  It came out with that perfect golden color on top.  I will certainly make this one again.

OMG!!!! Me and my 10 year old daughter made this for my husband's birthday a few weeks ago and he loved it. It is delicious. We added some simple steps: drizzled hot caramel and sprinkled pecan pieces on the crust (before pouring in the cheese cake mixture) and on the top and we also used coffee abstract. We will use this recipe again for sure!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!

OMG  This us so yummy, I'm gonna try adding just a bit more coffee, or maybe just some superfine ground "good" dark roast coffee beans too.  As for the carmel ice cream topping.. I recommend perhaps cooking it down a little, to make it thicker,and a tad darker.  Oh Let me stop... its just plain good...  Enjoy, & Make 2, You'll want to share because its just THAT GOOD. !

What a delight.... I did crush some pecans, finely chopped and put into graham cracker crust. I added about 3/4 cup. 
I didn't have expresso- so I just made a strong fresh pot of regular coffee and it came out perfect...still using the amount called for. 
Cooking it in a water bath is the answer, no cracks at all.  
Thanks for this incrediable, easy recipe

I found this to be sickly sweet, as did most of my guests.  It could easily serve 16, as the serving size has to be tiny in order for it to be edible.  Maybe I went wrong somewhere...

An easy 5 stars for this one!  
I followed the recipe exactly...was a liiiiiiiiiiiiitle too sweet for my taste (not for others eating though!), so next time I'd probably skip the sugar in the graham cracker base & go with a little more espresso.  I ran down to the coffee shop downstairs & got a double shot in a cup for this, so maybe next time I'll get a triple!  Great recipe though - Dawn really knows her cheesecake science!  Gotta let it cool slowly in the oven!

I'm usually a purist when it comes to my cheesecake - just New York for me please - but I have to admit, this is absolutely delicious!  No changes necessary.  Make it and enjoy it.

if you like coffee cheesecake this is the one for you. used starbucks brewed espresso (2 to 3 shots is 1/4 cup).  baked for an hour and half and let sit in oven for another hour- no cracks at all (used water bath).  drizzled with saunders caramel sauce.  I bet chocolate somewhere in there would be yummy.

Wonderful!!  Couldn't be easier.  Coffee strength can be adjusted according to taste, but I think - the stronger the better in this case! :)  Great recipe!

This is lovely, with just a hint of coffee flavoring. I went to starbucks and asked for two shots of espresso, and used it right away so it wouldn't get bitter. I swirled some caramel into the top before baking, but then liked the caramel so much that I poured it all over the top once it was cooled. 

Use a water bath, bake for an hour, then turn oven off and crack oven door for one minute, shut door and let cheesecake set in oven another  hour. Chill overnight. I have never had a cheesecake crack. Never.

This was delicious !  Definitely will store this one in my recipe file.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for but I used my food processor.  Made it super simple.

Best cheesecake ever.  The top cracked as I didnt use a waterbath, but I'm more about taste than I am presentation. Fantastic! If it was a healthier choice I'd have it everyday! Followed recipe exact except i ran a butter knife through the caramel on top before baking.

This is absolutely incredible!  Definitely go with the espresso, a double shot is the perfect amount, just a touch over 1/4 cup.  I had a pan of water on the bottom rack of my oven preheating left it in there.  Only had one tiny crack, very impressive!!  The caramel and whipped cream cinched it!  Brilliant!

So good. I've been told I can make this any time at all... and it was my very first cheese cake! I followed the directions to the letter, and I did use a water bath to bake it, so there were no cracks at all. A little bit of the water did seep into the foil, and the pan I used was a bit big, maybe, so the cheesecake part wasn't as tall as I thought it would be, but it was gorgeous and delicious. (Though I was asked if it was an Irish Cream cheesecake... I may use an espresso shot next time like some reviewers suggested. I just brewed some extra strong coffee and used that). Very easy and presents very well.

Exceptional!  I used gingersnaps instead of graham crackers for the crust, and as one other person suggested, added a few dots of caramel after pouring half of the batter in the pan.  There were no leftovers!

The best cheesecake I've ever made. I served this as one of my desserts for Christmas Eve dinner and it was gone in a matter of minutes. I have been requested to make this again for our next family dinner.  I made slight changes. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the crust, used 2 low fat cream cheese blocks and 1 regular as others suggested. I used low fat sour cream and cut the portion to 1/2 cup (4 oz). I also used 1/3 cup of strong coffee and dissolved 3 tsp of instant espresso in it prior to making the cheesecake. I made a basic caramel sauce and thinned it a bit to lightly glaze the entire cheesecake. This will be a favorite for years to come!!!

Served it today to family who loved it, too. As with all cheesecakes this needs to be beaten with the mixer on the slowest speed possible and only until the ingredients are mixed into the batter; this prevents air bubbles that cause the surface to crack when baked.  I did not use the water bath method to bake it.  The only change to the recipe I made was to use hot brewed coffee then I added about a teaspoon of instant coffee and stirred until it was dissolved.  This made a stronger coffee flavor.  Actually I liked it better without the caramel sauce topping, but that would require a change of the name of this recipe.  I already sent the recipe to one person who asked for it  several times today.

This is absolutely fantastic.  We have a game with our dinner club where they pick a flavor they want and then I go find a recipe.   They picked Caramel but that didn't seem interesting enough - and then I found this.  It's very light and jam packed with interesting flavors.  I'm making it for the 4th and 5th times this week and the only changes I would suggest are to wait until you're ready to serve to add the caramel and whipped cream.   For added texture and color, I sprinkle a handful of miniature chocolate chips (the really little ones) on top after adding the caramel.

This was my first time making a cheesecake from scratch and it came out perfect. I made it exactly as described, no modifications, except that I baked it in a water bath and left it in the oven for slightly longer than 15 min after it finished baking (I forgot about it). It didn't crack at all, and it came out of the mold perfect. The creaminess and taste of this cheesecake were unbelievable; even my cheesecake-hating son loved it. The only thing I'll change next time I make it is that I'll use homemade caramel rather than caramel topping.

Very delicious - the caramel sauce helped to highlight and enhance the coffee flavor in the cheesecake. I did find that even after doubling the amount of coffee in the cake, that the coffee flavor was very faint. I would imagine that adding instant coffee granules would help to make the coffee flavor even stronger.

I made this for my husband's birthday, and I can quote him with a mouth full of it saying "you have to enter this in a competition!" In other words this is a delicious recipe! I followed all the ingredients and steps exactly and was very happy with the finished cake. I used salted caramel topping which was a good compliment to the richness. Yum. I am saving this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the result!  This was my first cheesecake recipe and I was nervous that it would come out cracked or uneven.  I didn't have a pan that would fit a hot water bath so I popped it in the oven and prayed.  It came out perfect and creamy.  The flavor was exquisite with a mild coffee flavor that complemented the cheesecake wonderfully.

Tried this recipe but since i cook low sugar I tweaked it to fit. Instead of graham crackers I used Joseph's sugar free cookies and instead of butter coconut oil.For the base instead of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of truvia baking blend,omitted the sour cream and replaced it with Greek yogurt. Turned out great. skipped the carmel sauce.

Delicious - I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but made this as written with the exception of swirling a bit of caramel sauce onto the top before baking. It was creamy and delicious, and not overly heavy...Just a hint of coffee flavor. Mine did crack a tiny bit, even though I used the water bath, but it cracked near where the caramel was swirled, so maybe that had something to do with it.

Everyone loves when I make this. To make it more of a caramel macchiato cheesecake, I make my own caramel sauce and then add it to the cheesecake before baking it, just to give it that extra kick and then add it to the top when serving

Couldn't really taste the coffee flavour.  I would have added more, or made it more concentrated.

I have made this a few times, always in a water bath and it has been excellent.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be less dense than I normally like so I have omitted the sour cream.  I add one cup melted milk chocolate to the batter.  I also use three cups oreo cookie crumbs in the crust instead of graham crackers.  Lastly, I use about a third cup of brewed (Starbucks) expresso coffee.  It is everyones favorite!

Great recipe! I made this cheesecake for my sister's birthday and it was a HIT. I did use cinnamon sugar graham crackers and just strongly brewed coffee. My only complaint was using store bought caramel ice cream topping. It was too this and spread into one fine layer on top of the cake, not keeping the beautiful design I had drizzled on top. Next time I make this recipe I will use homemade caramel instead. Will make this cheesecake again!

Cheesecake is creamy and not too overpowering with the coffee flavor.  Even my kids and I, who are not coffee drinkers, enjoyed this cheesecake.  But my husband, who is a self-professed coffee addict, loved this cheesecake.  Make sure to leave enough time to chill this before serving, and get a really good caramel sauce, not an artificially flavored one.

This is a coffee lover's delight.  If I could give it more stars, I would.   I wasn't about to take any chances with my coffee brewing skills, so I stopped at Starbuck's and got a real espresso.  I used a different graham cracker crust, one with almonds and caramel mixed into the crust.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This is yummy!  I made it for my hubby's bday, since he loves cheesecake and the drink.  My friends couldn't believe it was homemade, and the waiter at the restaurant we went to wanted the recipe.  It's very easy to make.  I added some caramel to the recipe and cooked it over a pan of water, as was suggested in some of the other reviews.  Awesome recipe!

I'm not sure what went wrong but my cheesecake didn't turn out so well. Maybe I should have used the waterbath like other users had suggested. I tried baking it the way the recipe was written and my cheesecake turned a golden caramely brown on top (but it didn't taste very appetizing). The inside was good but the fact that the top was almost "burnt" looking and we had to scoop out the edible insides, made it a little strange for my taste. I'm not giving up though and will try a water bath next time.

Okay, there must be something wrong with me.  This didn't turn out well at all.  It was one of the worst tasting cheesecakes I have ever had.  I have to think it was something I did since everyone else seems to love this cheesecake.  I gave it two stars because I did like the graham cracker crust (which I am normally not a fan of).  I used cinnamon graham crackers.  Other than that, I don't think this cheesecake has any redeeming qualities.  I may try making it again, though, just to be sure it wasn't user error.

OH MY GOOOODNESS YES!   First.. I thought I was only a true lover of the dense new york style which this really isn't and second.. we used a brand new springform and didn't know til I was putting it into the fridge to chill that the fit of bottom to sides was imperfect and so.. water would have gotten in.. and it did. .a little .. most of my crust was imperfect but not inedible.. AND STILL this is a 5 STAR cheesecake.  MAKE THIS CHEESECAKE!! While eating it we were figuring out the next event where it will be a must on the menu!!   My mother in law was saying this will be a must have at every holiday.  Seriously.. this is Oh My G** good!!  I will cut back a little on the sugar next round to see if I prefer it a little less sweet.. but that's it.   Thank you bunches for posting this wonderful recipe.

I followed the recipe to a T, but I do recommend taking the suggestion of others to use an espresso as opposed to just a strong coffee.  Mine had the perfect coffee flavor and it was 2 shots of espresso from Starbucks with just some regular coffee added in for volume.  Also definitely use the water bath. AMAZING! My cheesecake looked professional and everyone raved :)

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday.
and it was my first cheesecake. I added more espresso (about 1/3 cup + 2 tbsp)
reduced sour cream (2/3 cup) and added 1/3 cup irish cream. Sub. digestive biscuits for the graham crackers (I live in Italy) and omitted the sugar in the crust. also cooked it in a water bath.
it turned out perfect! Maybe a little too sweet for me but everyone loved it.
i will make it again!!!
thanks for the recipe

Made this for a large dinner party and it was a huge hit.  I was told it should be named "the big O"  'cause after the first bite everyone's eyes would get huge and the first word out of their mouth would be "OH my...(goodness, gosh, etc.)"  I did use some toasted, ground almonds in the crust and used a double shot of espresso from Starbucks for the cheesecake.  A double shot was exactly 1/4 cup.  This one is a keeper.

Amazing!! I love coffee and cheesecake, and this was the perfect combination of both! I only had an 8 1/2 inch pan, so the center turned out a little soft.  I think 5 more minutes would have done the trick.

I'm a huge cheesecake and coffee fan, so this cheesecake was right up my alley! I made this cheesecake for a party, and it was a huge hit! I did make my own caramel sauce, rather than use the caramel icecream syrup. Definitely a 5 star recipe!***Made again, this time making it low carb. For the crust, I pulsed 8 oz pecans in my blendtec until they were finely ground. I added butter & 2 t stevia. Baked @ 350 for 10 min. For the cheesecake, I used 1 T stevia. For those wanting low carb, I served plain or with fresh berries. Made homemade caramel for the others. Everyone loved it...even my daughter who normally hates anything with stevia. It was nice to find a cheesecake that didn't require flour. Will definitely make again!

this is my first review,and my first attempt at making a cheesecake.
i used extra light cream cheese,and light digestive biscuits which are the uk version of graham cracker crumbs.
i also grated a little chocolate on top of the cheesecake.
i have to thank my aunt paula,as she gave me advice about using a water bath.
i love coffee,and we all adore cheesecake,and we love this one!
thanks for a lovely recipe.

Made this tonight for a housefull of swedes. It was a great cheesecake and I will definately use the base cake and change the extra flavours. Next time I'll serve with more caramel as I didn't wanna overdo it this time. The only thing I changed was adding a heaping tablespoon of instant coffee at the very end to the batter. The ones inside melted in but the ones on the top made a really pretty display. Thank you!

I've discovered a tip for doing a water bath while using a spring form pan and since I've yet to see a review or recipe with this tip in it I'm going to tell all my food loving friends. Put your spring form in a slow cooker liner bag then put it in your water bath. Leave the bag open and roll the edges down towards the rim of your cheese cake pan. Works like a CHARM and works like a hammock when lifting the cake out of the water when done.

Love this recipe. Make sure your coffee is STRONG. I do my own cold brew for this recipe - steep 1/3 cup coffee grounds in about a cup of water overnight then drain for this recipe. I’ve used coffee liqueur in place of coffee and that works, too. Otherwise, I make it exactly as written and it’s always a hit.

I've made a lot of cheese cakes and this is the best on ever. I made it for Christmas last year and everybody that tasted it said, "oh my God, make this every year." I brewed strong coffee then added instant coffee to that. The taste was amazing.

I used 1/2 and half Oreo cookie crumbs and graham wafers as well as the addition of Watkins real coffee extract 
I made it for my daughters baby shower, everyone loved it, there was none left, it fed 12 people!
I would definitely make it again??

I've made this cheese cake many times. I always follow the receipt the first time. Now I make this with only 2 packages of cream cheese and think it has a smoother texture. The flavor is outstanding and there is never left overs.

One exceptional cheesecake!   I didn't bother with the water bath.  Don't overheat the ingredients and you'll likely avoid the giant crack :)

I used regular coffee - brewed with the Kurig and on the 'small cup' setting.  Everyone agreed the coffee flavor was subtle but definitely distinguishable.

I love this cheesecake!  Everyone raves about it!  I use the oreo crust just because I like it better with caramel!   I make it two days before so that it settles and the coffee taste permeates it!

This cheesecake was a total hit with my friends and family and was devoured quickly! I made my cheesecake with a doubleshot of espresso (decaf) from Starbucks and added some homemade caramel sauce on top for a marbled effect. 
One thing I will stress is how important it is to let your dairy products sit out for at least an hour before making the batter, otherwise you'll get too many lumps. I baked the cake in a water bath for an hour and it came out beautifully! Once cooled I topped it with some Heath toffee bits and homemade caramel sauce (if you need a good recipe, try the recipe from the Brown Eyed Baker blog.) I would highly recommend this recipe - the coffee taste was not overpowering and the flavors blended beautifully. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is the exact same as one I've used for years and it always turns out perfectly - the only difference is I do not pre-bake the crust before pouring in the filling. If you omit the coffee flavour you have a really nice base for a plain vanilla cheesecake to add whatever flavours/fillings/toppings you like. 

The key for me to have a perfectly baked cheesecake is to make sure the batter is cold before baking, and to bake it in a water bath - the water bath is 100% necessary or your cheesecake will probably be overbaked and/or cracked.  You only need to bake it until there is a slight jiggle in the middle when you tap the pan. This may be more or less time than what the recipe calls for, so I usually start checking at the 45 minute mark.

It was my first cheesecake and this recipe made it easy. Tips: 1 Sprinkle 1/8 tsp of cinnamon on top to really bring out the caramel flavour. 2 Make homemade caramel sauce so you can add a shot espresso to that as well to make caramel espresso sauce.

This is this BEST cheesecake ever! I made it for my girlfriend's birthday who is a gourmet cook and she could not stop raving about it. It was smooth,creamy and not to overpowering with the coffee flavor. The caramel topping was outstanding. I will definitely be  making this again.

I made this for a family Thanksgiving dinner. I only bake cheesecakes once or twice a year. When I made this one, I stuck to the recipe. It came out great. I was worried that there was not enough coffee flavor when I tested the raw batter, but it really came out during the baking. Thumbs up by everyone there.

I knew the name alone made this dessert sound amazing, but after reading other reviews, I knew to try it. This is a delicious cheesecake and is different from the others due to the small addition of coffee. Since I made this for friends I wanted to make sure everything was perfect so I sampled it at random points when mixing. Upon the sampling, I realized that I needed another 1/8 or so of coffee to make it stand out. I also used a pack of cinnamon graham crackers instead of honey graham crackers. I knew it was not that big of a risk since cinnamon always finds a way to fit in with caramel and desserts. The crust was and is immaculate and it compliments the entire dessert.   Recommendations that I would give are to mix well, but do not over-do it, use unsalted butter, don't be afraid to use a pan other than a springboard since there are ways around the transferring, don't over-fill your container, and lastly, as i did it also, put a separate, oven-safe dish in the oven with about 1-1.5 cups of water when you are baking the entire cheesecake. The separate dish of water adds the perfect amount of humidity to the oven.

Terrific recipe. I did a water bath for the first time with this cheesecake and it came out perfect. I forgot the espresso so used the smallest coffee cup setting on my Keurig. As a result we could barely taste the coffee flavor, but it came out great nonetheless. Added a little cinnamon to the crust like another reviewer.

This was my first time baking a cheesecake and because I only had three blocks of cream cheese this recipe fit perfectly as the others called for at least 4. I followed the recipe exactly only with ONE minor change, and that was I did not have sour cream on hand so I used yogurt. I did have the eggs and cream cheese at room temperature, I did not find that the 1/2c butter was too much for the graham crackers (15 whole). baked it for 8minutes and let it cool. On to the batter, I added 1/4c of strong coffee, but perhaps I should have used espresso or more coffee, I could not taste the coffee flavor too much in the end. I did the water bath and foil--worked perfectly NO CRACKS I did leave door cracked open as directed for around 40m. I refrigerated over night and tried it the next night for dessert. I drizzled caramel sauce over it and whipped cream--no where close to a caramel macchiato, but quite tasty. It is nice and creamy a little bit tangy on some bites, maybe it needs more sugar? **One thing I do not know why it happened was when I sliced it out of the springform pan, the crust did not come off with the slice. A lot of the crust was still on bottom of the pan. I did grease the pan before baking so I'm not sure why this happened??  If i make this again I will add way more coffee as 1/4c is not enough for my liking and maybe I will add cinnamon or brown sugar to the crust
Overall easy recipe..

This cheesecake is wonderful. I made it exactly as the recipe says although I did bake it in a water bath. It came out perfect! I made my own carmel sauce and used 2 T of coffee in it to intense the coffee flavor. I plan to make this again as a company dessert.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day. We loved it! However, I feel that a little chocolate is always good so I found a recipe for an Oreo crust and made that instead of the graham crackers. I found some other recipes that put a layer of caramel between the crust and filling and that might be a good addition to this next time. It was delicious and my DH says it is his favorite cheesecake ever! Oh, I did substitute the Splenda/sugar stuff for the sugar cutting it in half, saving a few calories I guess. I also used the water bath method to bake this since I live at 7000 ft. Worked great! The baking time of 65 minutes plus 15 minutes with the oven off and door open was perfect!

My elderly mother and I made this fabulous dessert twice so far.  Every person in my family and extended family thought that this was the best cheesecake they had ever tasted.  Fairly easy to make. Did not feel I needed to alter the recipe. Thank you Dawn for sharing!

I didn't taste the coffee.  I used regular coffee, and I must not have brewed it strong enough.  The texture is fantastic.  It tasted great regardless.  I want to try it again with stronger coffee.

Outstanding.  I used two regular cream cheese and one light. Used light sour cream.  Cooked in a water bath and at the end of cooking time I turned the oven off and let the door stand open for a half hour.  No cracks.  It was so smooth! Get reviews from family at Easter.  Next time I will definitely put a layer of caramel in the middle of the cheesecake and then drizzle a bit more over the top when serving.  The crust seemed almost cookie like.  Really so good!

I made this cheesecake in December for an office Christmas luncheon and it was a huge hit!  It is delicious.  I made the cheesecake recipe exactly as written but did make Chef John's Salted Caramel for the topping which is extremely delicious as well!

Absolutely Delicious!!I made this for the holidays. 
Everyone loved it. I did cut the serving sizes very small.
 I made homade carmel sauce, the Starbucks lovers were excited to try this.
As Requested by all, I will make this again next year at our Christmas party..

Excellent! Made as instructed in recipe. My oven is really hot so I watched the temperature and it seemed to settle nicely at 310 degrees and I needed to bake the cake about 1 hour 20 minutes. Topped with dulce de leche. My sister-in-law said it was the best cheesecake she has ever had. Thanks - this recipe is a keeper.

Dear lord in heaven. I'm not religious, but in the future I might worship this cake. The coffee flavor is subtle enough to please non-coffee lovers and coffee lovers alike. We made our salted caramel topping and the sweet and salt on top put this amazing cake OVER the top. I didn't change anything in the recipe.

This cheesecake is perfect. I have never made a cheesecake that didn't crack, but this one came out like it was straight from The Cheesecake Factory! I made it exactly as written, and used the water bath method. I think the perfect timing on the recipe, the water bath, and the "being careful to not over-mix" were the causes of my perfect cheesecake. 

The flavor is so fantastic. I was thinking that only 1/4c of strong coffee wasn't going to be enough, but it was perfect. The caramel is totally necessary to give it that depth of flavor. 

Thank you for this recipe! It was so fantastic!!

This was wonderful to say the least!  For those who thought the coffee flavor was not strong enough,  I can see where the quality will make a difference and also letting it age for a day or 2. When it had cooled, ran a knife around the edge to loosen it from the pan and sampled what was on the knife. It was not very coffee like, but 2 days later, what a difference!. I did make a gluten free brownie crust since that is what I had on hand to make GF and still awesome! Everyone loved it.

Easy recipe, amazing taste. I'm not a coffee drinker so I didn't have fresh brewed coffee on hand, however used my mother-in-laws instant coffee packet. To make it strong I mixed one to-go packet with 1/4 cup hot water. It worked out great.

I made it for my bros birthday, it turned out great. I used a carmel and chocolate sauce ontop. I made the sauce into a tiger disign. I was worried i put too much sauce on and it would be over powering but it balanced out perfectly. I used a waterbath and turned off the oven and let it cool off inside but it still cracked, idk why cos i didnt over beat it. I used 3shots of expresso from Tim hortons, tasted amazing. Great recipe!

This is an absolutely superb cheesecake.  I made chocolate ganache and gave my guests a choice of toppings.  Other toppings would work as well.
Baked it in a hot water bath, turned the oven off after the 1 hr, 5 min. baking time and left it in the oven for another couple of hours.  I then placed plastic wrap on top and refrigerated it for 9 hrs or so.  Incredible!!

Great flavor, but even though I followed the recipe exactly, it was over-baked. Next time I will lower the temp by at least 50 degrees and try a waterbath.

I just made this cheesecake last night.  It was my first ever cheesecake.  I had felt pretty intimidated about making a cheesecake but this recipe is easy.  It is amazing!  No cracks!  I didn't have a spring form pan so I just used a 8 inch cake pan.  I used a water bath too.  I followed the directions but left the cake in the oven with the door open for about an hour.  I also used a caramel Starbucks Via for the coffee flavoring.  The directions for the coffee say one packet to 8 oz water.  To make it stronger I used 4 oz hot water and let it cool in the freezer.  I took the 1/4 cup for the recipe from that.

My first cheescake and it was absolutely delicious. Made it for a party and a man insisted that it was store bought. I'm not sure if I should be offended or thrilled. After it was cool I topped it with caramel.  I whipped up some heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla and "filled" the top with it then drizzled it with more caramel. It was like having a latte on a plate! Definately going to be making it a lot in the future. Thank you!

I am going to try to use fat free sour cream and cream cheese. Probably not as good that way I can eat more and feel less guilty. Also I poured caramel on top and swirled it before baking.

I never made cheesecake before but I wanted to try so I decided to make this one. I bought the Starbucks DoubleShot Energy + Coffee (In regular coffee flavor, it comes in a can from the soda isle of the grocery store). I decided to add more than the recipe called for, about 1/2 cup instead of 1/4. Also, I bought cinnamon graham crackers instead of the regular and the crust was AMMAAZING!! The whole thing was amazing!! I decided to use a water bath so I just used an 8" circular cake pan and put it in the middle of a 9"X11" cake pan filled with about a half an inch of water.  It turned out absolutely perfect and was the best tasting and best looking thing I have ever made!!!

If you like coffee this one is a winner.  I bought a double shot of espresso from Beaner's and you could definitely taste the coffee!  My mom didn't care for it because she thought it wasn't very sweet, but my husband and I loved it.  The crust proportions are perfect.  I found the texture a little but off-- maybe not as smooth and creamy as some cheesecakes, but still very good.

I made this cheesecake with between 1/4 - 1/3 cup of espresso since the other reviews said it wasn't strong enough. the taste became bitter and next time I make this, I think I'll make it with only 1/4 cup of espresso. Also, I will drizzle caramel on top of the cheesecake before baking. By drizzling caramel on top of the cake after it was all done didn't really give the caramel taste to the cake. In my opinion, if there were some heavy cream in this, it would have made an even better cheesecake. I may be wrong though...
overall, this is a good cheesecake... I love caramel macchiato... iced or hot or even a cake! ^^*

For my coffee I used Starbucks Carmel flavored VIA diluted in 1/4 hot water then waited for it to cool before adding it to the rest of the mixture.  I baked at 300 for 1 hour 15 min in hot water bath.  After baking I cracked open the oven and let the oven cool.  No cracking here!!  This turned out fantastic.  I was afraid the coffee flavor wouldn't be strong enough, but the VIA packet was perfect.  Repeatable

Amazing with caramel swirled on the top of the batter just before cooking. Otherwise I think it is mainly a mocha cheesecake.

I don't eat cheesecake, but this sounded interesting so I made it for those who do.  Needless to say, 5 stars, it went over extremely well.  One person told me I had to make this everyday!  I made some very minor changes though.  The smallest pan I had was 10", so I used 2 1/4 cup graham crackers (after the fact, I think 2 in the original recipe would've been just fine), and used only 6 tbs of butter.  After reading some of the reviews, I put a pan of hot water on bottom shelf of oven, baked at 300 degrees for 1 hr 15 mins, turned the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in there for an additional 30 mins before taking it out to cool.  Will definitely be making this again even though I don't eat cheesecake.

This was absolutely the perfect cheesecake :) Made just a few changes (sandies cookies instead of graham crackers to avoid hydrogenated oils, and let the entire cake chill for 24 hours) and it came out flawless. No cracks, no lumps, firm, and delicious! I made it for a BBQ, and everyone gobbled it up so fast. Honestly - best dessert I've ever eaten!

I had high hopes for this because of the rave reviews, but I thought it was nothing special.  I made it for my parents who are caramel macchiato fanatics and they did not enjoy it.

I followed the recipe except I used Biscoff cookies (the kind served on Delta Airlines) for the crust.  Turned out great but I would have liked a more distinct layer of caramel.  The Biscoff crust was a great compliment to an otherwise terrific cheesecake.  Definitely use a water bath.

Fantastic!  I made this for a friend’s birthday and I had a group of, usually civilized, women who were literally arguing over the last few slices.  One of the guests who happens to be a local restaurant owner was so impressed that she asked if I would be interested in judging in an upcoming baking contest.  Thanks Dawn!   And, yes I gave Allrecipies.com and Dawn credit for this amazing creation.

This was a very creamy delicious cheese cake! We added extra coffee and some caramel ice cream topping. I think sour cream in cheese cakes makes them lighter and creamier. Yum!

I made this twice in 2 weeks.  First time I followed the recipe exactly and I used instant espresso.  It was so smooth and silky, my co-workers said it was the best cake I ever made.  The next time I made the instant espresso stronger and I didn't use a water bath.  I don't know if it was the quality of the coffee but I didn't like the stronger taste (and I LOVE coffee).  Also the crust tasted burnt without the water bath. My guests & husband loved it though. I will stick with the original recipe for a 5 star cake.

Amazing cheesecake! I took a chance and did not do the waterbath and it turned out Beautifully!! I've made a lot of cheesecakes and this is probably the prettiest one I've ever baked. I'll be posting a picture shortly. I did make sure to leave it in the oven for the recommended amount of time after baking to prevent cracking. I followed this recipe to a "T" and I wouldn't change a thing in the future. It tasted even better the second day after baking!  I'll make this one again and again. Thanks for posting!

This cheesecake is absolutely FABULOUS! It lives up to its name! If you are a Starbucks fan and favor Caramel Macchiatos, you will love this, guaranteed! Do make sure to add whip cream,and caramel topping, it gives it the whole kick! I advise highly a waterbath, to prevent cracking and drying out. Truthfully, I always do waterbaths on all my cheesecakes, it saves the heartache of a flop cheesecake. This is for 100% guaranteed sure ,one of my favorites now! And do make sure you use cold Espresso in this recipe for its full flavor, I made mine in advance and let it sit in the fridge while I prepared everything else! Like I said, this is a dream come true for cheesecake lovers and Caramel Macchiato fans!

This is a GREAT cheesecake and it tasted exactly like a Caramel Macchiato! I have made it twice (no water bath)--one cracked and one didn't, BOTH delicious! I forgot to go to Starbucks for the espresso.  Here's how I got my coffee strong enough:  I ground it very fine and used a french press with 3X more coffee than necessary for the amount of water used and it came out great!

Man this good cheesecake. I love a good carmel macchiato from Starbucks and this tastes JUST like one. I got a better review on this dessert than any other I have ever made ( and I bake often). The only problem/complaint that was probably my fault is that the texture wasnt creamy and smooth. It was kind of...eggyish. But that is probably because I didn't bake it in a water bath. All in all, this is one of the greatest foods to touch my plalette :) .

Great flavor! I discovered a way to avoid seepage from the water bath. I used a crock pot liner bag around my cheesecake pan. I had already used foil but the narrower type, so it had a seam and I wanted it watertight. So I tucked the top of the bag over the foil to keep it secure. I think it took a bit longer to cook because of it.

I never baked a cheesecake in a waterbath before this recipe, and I never will again.  I made the first cake in a bath, and for some reason, the entire bottom of my springform pan was soaked with water.  I checked my tinfoil, and couldn't find a hole.  I have no idea how it happened.  The second time I made this I did not use a waterbath, and the top cracked slightly.  I hid it with whipped cream and caramel topping (since it's how a caramel macchiato is served, I didn't think anyone would notice).  Four stars for taste; I would have given this five stars if I wasn't forced to make the second cheesecake.

This was my first cheesecake that I have made.  My husband's favorite drink from 'that' coffee shop is the Carmel Macchiato, and he loves cheesecake.  Perfect match!!  Everyone at the party raved about it.  This is something I have already been asked to make again.  Thank you very much!!

If I could give this 100 stars I would, it is definitely worth it!!! I went to Starbucks and got a double shot of Espresso and it was a perfect taste. It wasn't too much or not enough. I have always wondered why my cheesecakes come out SO ugly and I figured out the water bath is a MUST. I filled a roasting pan with steaming hot water (about 2 inches) and set the pan in that and followed the cooking instructions. Thank you SO much for a wonderful, amazing, delicious recipe. My husband will NOT share this cake with anyone...

Delicious!! This cheesecake has the perfect amount of espresso and caramel in it!! I used a prepared graham cracker crust - I should have used 2 of them because I overfilled the crust and still had quite a bit left over. Also, mine cracked (a first for me). So, next time, I will use two crusts, cook them for half an hour and then let them sit in the oven for an hour. My teenager and her friend were so excited to try this recipe and now they love it!

FANTASTIC! This was my first cheesecake and it was very easy to make...however i forgot to wrap my pan with aluminum foil before i put it in the water bath...as a result, water leaked in and the crust got soggy..but nonetheless the cake turned out DELICIOUS! 

I bought both the caramel sauce and a double shot of espresso from Starbucks!!!

Loved this cheesecake. My sister said that it is her favorite of all the cheesecakes I've made (quite a few).  I had a little trouble getting my coffee strong enough. Than, I thought that there was not enough coffee taste in the cheesecake.  Next time I will make some strong espresso.

WOW!!  This was a great tasting cheesecake.  Very easy to make.  The caramel and whipped topping make it even better.  I made this for a work function and everyone loved it.

I have made this once already, and plan to make again this weekend for my large family get together...it's an italien theme and this will go along perfectly!  I didnt' change a thing the first time and it came out awesome!  Even my 'coffee-haten' husband LOVED it!  Like other reviewers have stated, make sure to use STRONG BREWED coffee.  I make ALOT of it and use part for this recipe and the other with the CAPPUCCINO ON ICE recipe found on this site..  YUMMY!!!

This is the first cheesecake I have ever attempted.  I made it for my hubby for V-Day.  I used chocolate graham crackers and added some choc. chips to the batter.... absolutely decadent!!!

I have used this recipe so many times for cheesecake now... I usually don't add the caramel or whipped topping and usually leave out the coffee, but the base recipe  for cheesecake is so good! You can add fruit in the summer or canned pumpkin for fall -- whatever you want. Mine always turns out delicious!

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  This is an excellent recipe.  My husband made it for a New Year's Day party and everyone LOVED it.  He made it exactly the way the recipe states and used a water bath.  PERFECT!  I just had another slice and it tastes better today than it did yesterday!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for our first Christmas dinner, and my first attempt at making cheesecake. It was absolutely wonderful. I think expresso would have made it taste a little more coffee-like.

This was really good. I got rave reviews from my friends, the only thing I would change is to have a thicker crust. I felt it was too thin. Other than that: faboulous!

I used strong coffee as I didn’t have expresso, and for crust I ran out of graham crackers, so used teddy grahams to make the full two cups. Because of this, I cut down my sugar in the crust to 1 1/4 tbsp. This turned out really well. 
I still have not mastered how to bake a cheesecake without a few cracks in the top, so I filled them with cool whip, and did a very thin layer over the entire top (1/4 inch) before drizzling caramel sauce. It got tons of rave reviews from friends and families.

Carmel macchiato is my daughter's favorite drink too. So we tried this for her birthday. Very good. But not our favorite cheesecake. The texture wasnt creamy. But we did enjoy that it was the perfect amount of sweet!

UPDATE: I’m coming back several days later to change my review from 4 stars to 5. After the cheesecake settled in the fridge for a few days, the consistency thickened up. This was sooooo good!   Original review: I feel I need to disclose that for whatever reason, my baking skills are lacking and something always goes wrong. I was very nervous about attempting a cheesecake especially because I made a lemon pie last week and the cream cheese turned out very lumpy. So before starting, I read up on some Cheesecake tips. First, I made sure to bring all ingredients to room temperature (about 2-hours). I had graham cracker pie crusts on hand so chose not to make the crust in the springform pan. Also, instead of using my kitchenaid mixer, I used a hand mixer and beat the cream cheese for several minutes before adding the sugar. I followed the rest of the instructions but when I poured the mixture into the first pie crust, I realized I had enough for BOTH pie crusts. I was very concerned about how long to bake 2 shallow cakes vs 1 deep one. I kept the temp at 325, did not use a water bath, and started checking at 45 minutes. I pulled them out at 55 min, totally forgetting about turning off the oven and leaving them in for another 15 min. My cakes didn’t crack, which surprised me. I thought the coffee flavor was wonderful! However, the consistency was lighter/fluffier than I was expecting. I like a more dense cheesecake. Maybe I will only use 2eggs next time.

This recipe is outstanding as is.  Make sure you go to your local coffee shop and get a quad-shot espresso.  It only cost me $3 and was strong enough to give a great coffee flavor.  You have to use a water bath which isn't directly mentioned in the recipe but should be as she uses one in the video.  Most perfect cheesecake I've ever made.

A complete hit at our holiday/birthday dinner with family.  I followed the recipe and also baked in a water bath,  and cooled down in the oven for a couple of hours.  Turned out perfectly.  I changed up the topping by making a fruit glaze of blueberry, lime, and peach preserves pureed together with a TSP of corn starch added to thicken, and then topped off with fresh blackberries.  Lastly,  made fresh whipped vanilla cream for topping (not that it really needed it).  The background flavor of the coffee really sets it apart from other cheesecake recipes I've tried.  It has officially become a new birthday/holiday tradition!

I’ve made this recipe several times and it has turned out perfectly each time. I typically don’t like cheesecakes that involve candy of any sort, so was a little leery of doing a caramel cheesecake… But this was wonderful. I have had so many compliments and requests for this cheesecake from family and friends.Thank you for the recipe.

Not sure if I would make again. It was good and my guests seemed to really enjoy it but I have been making a lemon cheesecake for years that is still the family favorite. Wanted to try this for a change of pace.

thank you! this recipe is the greatest. i used a strong brewed coffee and it came out amazing, the caramel and whipped cream on top are extra.   I made it exactly how the recipe instructs you to.  maybe had to cook it a little bit extra though.   thank you Dawn for such an amazing recipe!!!!

I am new to wanting to cook and or, bake.  As a bachelor, the microwave is a good friend.  However, after browsing recipes here, and really liking cheesecake, I decided to try to make this one. To say the least, wow! So good.  Either I am an amazing natural baker or this recipe was crazy easy.  Either way, (spoiler, it was the latter), a tremendous cheesecake.

I absolutely loved this cheesecake. Made it for a gathering and it was a big hit. I did have a bigger springform pan, made a slight adjustment increasing the ingredients and it was superb.

Now a favorite dessert in my house. The only change, I left out the sour cream and swirled caramel onto the top before baking. Definitely sweet but now an asked for treat from the family.

This is a good recipe as is but instead of just drizzling caramel on top I set aside 1 cup of the cream cheese mixture with everything mixed but the coffee and add caramel to the 1 cup. I than add the coffee to the remaining batter then put the espresso later on the bottom and top with the caramel cheesecake.

I made this for a coworker's birthday and it received rave reviews.   I followed the recipe for ingredients to a tee.   I did bake it in a waterbath for about 65 minutes and then let it cool for an hour and covered with foil and refrigerated.   The crust came out perfect, firm but tender to cut.     NO CRACKS!!   The espresso flavor is not too strong and tamed by the sweetness of the caramel sauce.   

I used Hershey's caramel syrup and homemade whipped cream (heavy cream, 2 tbsp. powdered sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla).

I've  made this recipe several times, mostly by request. This is a GREAT tasting dessert. My only criticism is C'mon man, using canned whipped cream on this masterpiece is just WRONG!  Make your own whipped cream, or even better give a try at Paul Prudhomme's Chantilly Cream. You wont regret it, it has just a splash of Brandy and Grand Marnier. So Good.

My hubby's favorite coffee is a caramel macchiato, so when I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it. This is the first cheesecake I've made from scratch (first one was from a kit). 
My family loved it! I've used this recipe as a base for 3 other cheesecakes I've made.

It tastes amazing, I went to my local cafe and got higher grade espresso shots so the coffee taste was stronger and more bitter. The only downside was that I cooked it for 20 minutes extra and the centre still isn't done :(

I made mine with a chocolate cookie crust....OMG!! My husband literally made himself sick on this cake he just wouldn't stop going back for "one more little piece ". Sooo addictive.  I would give this one ten stars if I could. I have already made two of these, I think it's safe to say I would absolutely make it again.

I have made this many times. Thank you Dawn for an amazing recipe. 
First few times--- followed recipe  exactly --- many cracks.
Next few times --- tried putting pan of water on bottom rack so oven has moisture, still cracked.
Then tried making a water bath with my too small aluminum foil (all leaked inside and soggy crust)
Finally tonight I actually got some oversized aluminum foil from Costco and cheesecake turned out absolutely fantastic with no cracks.
Overall excellent, excellent delicious recipe, but make sure to do the water bath.

Amazing! I didn’t do a water bath like some suggested, I made the recipe as directed and my family loved it! I used a medium strong brew espresso. I didn’t put the caramel and whipped cream on it, as some of my family doesn’t like overly sweet desserts. I kept it on the side so everyone could put on as much as they’d like. The cheesecake was delicious and the perfect amount of coffee flavor.

Okay so I’m bad at baking and I just mixed it all together at once (the batter part the graham cracker crust went well) and the cream chessse was so chunky and um the smoke detector went off... just make sure you do it EXACTLY how the recipe says the batter was also extremely liquid to when I made it though the reviews all say it’s rrally good so I might try again idk I have like 17 minutes left of bake time

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious! Best cheesecake I’ve ever made. For the coffee part I used a packet of hazelnut instant coffee mixed into 1/4 cup of water. Perfect amount of coffee flavor. Wonderful dessert that went over very well!

I, honestly, wish I could give this mores stars. This is has a delicious, subtle coffee flavor.  The texture is creamy and smooth. My husband's favorite dessert is cheesecake.  He said this is the best dessert I have ever made and that this is the best cheesecake he has ever tasted. High praise, indeed!  May play around the with coffee amount (perhaps adding a Via packet to my pulled espresso shots).  However, this is perfect as written.

Made this for my son's birthday. Followed the recipe exactly except I reduced (boiled down) regular coffee instead of using espresso or just regular strong coffee. It turned out beautiful, was delicious and everyone loved it. I bought Torani caramel sauce to use, and added it to each slice when serving it has a tendency to spread.
Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my first time making a cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly as is. I did use a water bath (muffin pan underneath as someone mentioned in the reviews) and it worked great. There was no cracking, except for when I ran a knife around the edge and it was just barely. The texture and crust came out as good as I could have hoped. The only things I would change is next time I'll use an extra 1/2 cup sugar in the filling and maybe try to figure out how to make the coffee taste come through a little better.

My very first cheesecake, didn't do a water bath, so it cracked.  Nonetheless, it was delicious, have since made it again every one loved it.

I made this cheesecake exactly as directed, and it turned out perfectly - looked beautiful (no cracks) and tasted delicious!  It even held together when I accidentally dropped it while trying to release it from the springform pan.   I would definitely make it again.

I made this twice : first time cooking the crust, and second time by putting instead the crust in the refrigerator and with less butter.I doubled the coffee and increase the sugar, but both times the crust was fluffy and sticked to the pan. I also backed 30 more minutes than my usual cheesecakes.

I did make changes to this based on things I just thought would taste good and what I had in my house on a snowy day.  I made a homemade caramel sauce.  I also made a sour cream topping, added milk chocolate shavings to the top, and drizzled the caramel over it when the cheesecake was cool.  I didn't have strong coffee, but used coffee grounds in a paper towel tied at the top..submerged it and let it sit for a bit.  I was quite positive I wouldn't taste the coffee, but, boy, did this method work well for me!  I brought it to a gathering, and a man told me he dreamt about the cheesecake that evening.  That must be a good sign.  So, my "tweaks" were only because I felt like it, but it turned out excellent.  No need to do what I did, but it's fun experimenting...especially when there's no way to go out due to a snow storm.  Enjoy!

First I would like to say I am not a dessert baker. I had some problems and not sure why. 
It tasted really good, but the looks failed and the tasted even though it was good, not what i expected. The coffee taste was too weak. My cake browned a little on top, never saw cheesecake look like that. Mine had a raised edge on the outside, meaning there was a lip on the cake. The cake did not look smooth when it was cut, the cake looked rough or grainy. I used caramel syrup out of the bottle. I believe that was too runny. But it tasted really good in spite of my flaws. I would make at home and enjoy every bite, but I wouldn't take it where I cared about the look and presentation of it all.

This cheesecake took the "people's choice" award in a friendly cheesecake baking competition at the organization I work for. I took a few notes from the comment section regarding baking the cheesecake in a water bath and assuring that the cream cheese was at room temperature before I started putting the recipe together.  
Other than that I didn't change a thing, and it was awesome.  I wish my husband liked cheesecake as much as I do so that I could make this over and over again.  I will have to find an excuse to make this again.

Cheesecake was excellent.  Followed suggestions  given by others to cook in water bath. Only thing I wouldn't do again is use Reddi Whip t o decorate as suggested.  Cream didn't hold up at all and I put it on close to serving time. Brand new can too!

This was probably the best cheesecake I've ever made. I added some cinnamon to the crust and used a water bath. I was careful not to over mix or over bake. No cracking and so creamy!!

This recipe was really easy to make. My husband actually made it while I stayed and kept up with our two boys. It was very easy to make and it came out great and we're actually going to have it at Thanksgiving tomorrow so I'm very excited thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe with us!

On my second attempt I did not tightly pack the crust and did not press the crust up against the edges of the pan, Doing this the first time, the crust on the edges was too hard.
This one was perfect

YUM! This was fabulous! When I went to make this, I couldn't find the bottom to my 9" spring form pan so I decided to make this in a 9" deep dish pie pan instead of running out to buy another one. It worked great, so if you don't have the spring form pan, you don't have to get one. I baked this in a water bath for 65 minutes and then I turned off the oven and let it rest in the oven for about 2 hours. I refrigerated it for two days and before serving, I decorated the edges with redi whip and drizzled caramel sauce over top. It was picture perfect but I forgot to take a pic and it was gone before I knew it! I'll be making this again though.

Followed the recipe. Coffee taste could be stronger, so next time I would make a stronger espresso (used instant espresso powder). Texture was a little too soft, I've made many cheesecakes and this one was light and fluffy but a little on the loose side. Recipe is definitely a keeper but will need some tweaks next round!  :)

Followed directions, but used two premade crumb crusts and cut cooking time to 30 minutes. Everyone enjoyed it and I have the second one for another time.

Yummy! I loved the consistency of this cheesecake. It's much creamier than most recipes and the taste is wonderful. I think the baking time is spot on. I followed Dawn's instructions to the letter and I had no issues with under- or over-baking. The cheesecake turned out beautifully (no cracks!). This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe, Dawn!

This is my second time making this cheesecake.  I made no significant changes to the recipe.  I used two shots of expression (strong) from our coffee machine and I did make my own caramel.  I shaved some chocolate over the whipped cream (really for looks more than anything).  It is currently being referred to as the best cheesecake ever.  I do recommend using some form of a water bath.  I fill a muffin tin with water and set the springform pan on top.  Not a single crack or blemish on this cheesecake.

Absolutely lovely. Made this for my father's birthday, and he loved it, as did I, and I am not a coffee fan whatsoever.     I ended up making two cheesecakes out of this recipe, but that was fine with us! Both were gone within 3 hours! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

I made this with 2 shots of espresso from Starbucks. The flavor is amazing! It's strong enough to taste it, but still delicate. The first time I made this without a water bath, and it came out perfect, no cracks. I'm making it again tonight, this time with a water bath, we'll see how it turns out! All of my roommates loved it, it's super rich, with good flavor. This is definitely something I'll make over and over again :)

Excellent recipe! My only changes are that I cooked the cheesecake in a waterbath to prevent cracking and I left out the whipped cream decor. I have made this recipe many times and it is always a crowd pleaser.

Perfect - texture, sweetness, and cheesiness.   I made four minis.  I put a cupcake liner in each pan and used 1/4 cup graham cracker mixture.  I own a coffee shop so I pulled a shot of espresso and I can't even tell you how good it smelled!  I wrapped foil around each pan and sweezed tightly so water couldn't get in or condensate on the foil and drip in.  I baked in a water bath for one hour,  turned oven off, let sit for one hour and then refrigerated overnight.  I poured caramel (kinda like ice cream topping) on top and then a little whipped cream.  The combination of the caramel, the espresso, and the whipped cream was just like a really good latte.  These are now totally on the menu.  I also have eight more in the oven (without espresso).  I'm going to top some with caramel and Heath Chips, some plain for raspberry topping, and some with lemon curd.  Seriously, NOBODY will be disappointed!  $5.95 for Classic and $6.95 for Flavored.

Made exactly as written, and it is really good.  I had a 10" pan instead of a 9", so I increased the ingredients by 1/4, and it fit perfectly, but took longer a little longer to cook; about 1 hr 20 min, but I checked it every 5 min to make sure it didn't overcook.  Really is foolproof, and a huge hit with my family.

I made this cheesecake for dessert on Christmas day. It was a huge hit with adults and kids alike!

I didn't have access to a springform pan, and was feeling pretty lazy, so I used store-bought graham cracker crusts instead. Which turned out to be fantastic - I had enough filling to fill two!

I personally used more espresso than the recipe calls for, but I love coffee.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I think the 9" spring pan I used was too small. It has expanded too high. I haven't sung my fork into it yet: it looks good, but I could have done with a larger pan or just less cheese filling. Next time, I'll make it in a larger pan, or decrease the amount of cheese.

Mine came out cracked because I did not use other reviewers suggestion of a waterbath. It still tasted great, but next time I will try the water bath when baking it.

I have made this cheesecake numerous times. It comes out absolutely perfect.  I have also made it using the chocolate wafers from Oreo's (without the creamy centers) for the crust and used a little Hershey's chocolate syrup on top with a few sprinkles of the crushed Oreo's on top. Perfect if you don't like caramel. I love it both ways and everyone always raves that it is delicious.  Thanks Dawn for this recipe. It has definitely become my go to recipe for cheesecake.

This is really good! I always bake cheesecakes in a water bath and I had no problems with cracking. This came out so smooth and creamy. I only wish the coffee flavor was a little stronger.

Creamy and delicious overload! This is an excellent cheese cake that is smooth and creamy with excellent flavor.  This would be great served not only with the caramel sauce but fudge sauce would be wonderful too.  I baked it in a water bath and had no cracking issues.  You may have to extend the baking time as I did.

The first time I made this cheesecake, I did it exactly per the directions.  It was awesome, but the second time, I altered it. For the crust, I used 1 cup graham cracker + 1 cup vanilla wafer crumbs, adding 1/4 teaspoon espresso powder, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and only 1/2 stick of melted butter.  I pressed this into the bottom of the 9 inch spring form pan and up the sides enough to cover the seam well, and did not pre-bake it. Pre-baking the crust is not a necessity with me for a cheesecake - I love the result when I don't. I hold a large spatula or wide wooden spoon about an inch over the batter and pour the batter onto the spoon or spatula and allow it to gently flow onto the crumb layer, preventing the batter from forming a hole in it.  The only change I made to the filling was to make my espresso twice as strong as I did the first time because the flavor was not strong as I wanted it to be the first time around.  I did bake it at 325, but used the water bath method. I garnished with Smuckers Caramel Ice Cream Topping and then chopped up some cinnamon spiced pecans and sprinkled them around the edge all the way around. It was perfect. This cheesecake is exceedingly good and no doubt I will be making it many times.  Everyone I have served it to has truly enjoyed it.  Thanks, Dawn, for posting this one!! I posted a picture of the second one I baked.

A-maz-ing. I used the comments/suggestions and have made this multiple times with great success. Just make sure you use room temperature ingredients, 3 shots of Starbucks expresso, a water bath and cool down slowly. Then you are almost guaranteed a crack free super creamy & yummy dessert!

I found this recipe to be outstanding and results were perfect. I used a pie crust in substitute of graham cracker and butter base. I used 3/4 cup of sugar since the Carmel would make it sweet any way. If anyone would like to experiment this approach, use 2/3 of the recipe to minimize waste. Again awesome recipe. Thanks.

This is a great recipe. It came together easily. I did make a few changes that I think enhanced it. After I baked the crust, I put a layer of caramel sauce on the crust before pouring on the cheesecake mixture & baking it.. Then after it was baked & cooled I made a chocolate ganache to put on top. These two little changes pushed it up to 6 stars.

Made this recipe exactly as stated, no water bath, and it came out of the oven looking amazing!  I took it to our dinner party, worried that it wouldn't taste as good as it looked and it exceeded my taste expectations!  Everyone raved about this recipe!  My husband and I joke that any recipe with coffee is a keeper and this recipe certainly would fit our criteria!

Excellent recipe.  Mine cracked a bit in the middle, so next time I will use a water bath, but the taste was phenomenal.

My eight-year-old brother and I made this together for Thanksgiving dinner. The entire family really enjoyed it (save for my brother, because, obviously, there was coffee and as an eight-year-old, coffee is gross [and he shouldn't have it anyway, so he ate pumpkin pie, instead]).
I didn't use QUITE as much sugar as the recipe says; I only used about one and a half cups. I also drizzled caramel in layers with the cheesecake. I didn't put enough, but that's okay; it was fun, and the caramel came out of the sides and, amazingly enough, didn't burn at all.
I also didn't use a water bath; it still came out completely perfect!

This is by far the absolute best cheesecake recipe I have ever found!!  I followed the recipe, with the exception of using low fat cream cheese and sour cream.  Amazing!

I made this pie for thanksgiving dinner. Very good pie. You can taste the coffe and the cream cheese. I will definely do it again. I substitute 1 cup of sugar for 1/2 cup of  condensed milk just because I love that milk almost in any desert.

I made this for company last week and it was a huge hit! My husband took the leftovers to work the next day, and everybody there raved about it too. The only complaint is that the caramel sauce hardened on the cheesecake so that it was difficult to get through it with a spoon - or your teeth! I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for my daughter's birthday.  Her favorite drink at Starbucks is Caramel Macchiato Latte.  She LOVED this, as did the rest of my family.  Highly recommend.  Followed the directions exactly.  Just coulda baked 10 minutes longer.  Favor is 5 stars!

I've made the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and chocolate cappuccino cheesecake from allrecipes, but this one is the best!! Soooooo good. I took half of it to work with me and it was gone within a couple hours. I'll be making this again soon for sure!

I made this with two pre-made 9" crusts and it was the perfect amount of batter. My cheesecake did crack, which was expected because I didn't bake it as directed in a springform pan and water bath. 

Maybe it's me, but it tasted like a "regular" cheesecake to me that required more work than other recipes I use. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not as spectacular as expected. Maybe I need to use stronger coffee or espresso next time. My boyfriend loved it though, and it was his birthday dessert, so that's what matters!

Perfect! I made this for my family (none of whom particularly like cheesecake) and it was a hit! I was told this could be the best cheesecake they have ever eaten. Not too sweet, which was perfect with the caramel topping. A DEFINITE keeper!

Very good flavor. The caramel overpowered the wonderful coffee flavor so it would be a good idea to mix in some instant coffee powder to the whipped cream, however the cheesecake can stand alone without the caramel in my opinion. Also the cook time wasnt enough and it being my first cheesecake I followed the directions exactly. I would give it an additional fifteen minutes. All in all very good.

I absolutely love this recipe! I added a bit more espresso, though. I needed to taste more coffee than cream cheese in the batter. I love the taste of coffee. It was a big hit for my family, they're all starbucks lovers.

I served this for my husbands Granny on Easter and it went fast. The recipe is great and I used the can of Starbucks espresso from Wal-Mart and was worried it would be too weak and poured in too much coffee. I will make it again with the amount of coffee the recipe suggests. Everyone was bouncing off the walls and my husband liked it but said it was too much coffee. The consistency was perfect smooth and no cracks using the waterbath. Not bad for being my 1st cheesecake!

I don't even like cheesecake that much but this one is soooooooo good. I highly reccomend it. The water bath for the springform pan makes the cake softer.

This was the first cheesecake I've ever made. It was soooooo good! I had no idea cheesecake was so easy to make! The only thing different I did, was to put it into a 9x9 glassware, for lack of anything better to use. Thanks for a great recipe! We'll be using it again!
