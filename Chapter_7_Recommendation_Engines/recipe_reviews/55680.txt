Excellent, easy and delicate texture!  Also an impressive dish for company.  The sauce though, only makes enough for 3 1/2 to 4 (not 8!) servings in our family.....we LOVE sauces and this one is perfect for the Timbale.

Sooooo rich and delicious!  It tasted very gourmet.  However, it would be better if the portion were smaller and it were served as an appetizer.  It was hard to eat as the main course because it was so rich.
