I've made this many times now, very good. I did have one loaf that didn't turn out, and that was because I over beated it, and it sunk in after I took it out of the oven. Other than that 'one' mishap, this is quite fluffy and sweet.

Really good simple recipe.  I've never tasted a "milk cake" before- it really did have a sweet milk flavor to it.  I liked the texture alot, similar to angel food cake but WAY easier prep.

I should of realized this recipe was flawed when the sugar ingredient was only 1 1/2 teaspons.  But I still gave it a try and it came out exactly like my expectations.  No flavour not even spongy.  Maybe there was a typo with the ingredients. If I added more sugar this cake could of probably been saved.  But instead it falls flat!
EDITORS NOTE:
The incorrect sugar amount was due to a technical error on our part. We have fixed the recipe, and apologize for the inconvenience.

Followed the recipe exact.  Texture was exactly what I was looking for (perfect) but it was very "eggy" tasting and not very sweet.  My daughter said it tasted like plain pancakes.  I couldn't serve this (made it for strawberry shortcake) It went in the garbage.

This cake is a great tasting, easy cake.  I almost didn't make it because of the previous review but saw the editor note and proceeded.  My young son helped make it.  Also is a great recipe for using milk that is about to go bad ... LOL!  Thumbs up!

I made this sponge cake again in muffin pans (using paper muffin cups)... and this really helped solve the problem of it sticking to the pan.  I recommend it!

This was a tad on the dry side, but all the better to soak up the juices from the macerated strawberries I served it with for Strawberry Shortcake.   It stuck horribly to the little shortcake basket specialty pan I prepared it in and when I finally got the little cakes out it wasn’t a pretty sight – I'm sure it was the pan’s fault, not the recipe’s!

I made the mistake of making this cake once; now my husband won't shut up about it. It IS really good though—if you're like me and prefer desserts that aren't super-sweet, give this cake a go because day-um. Great hot and cold.

I agree with the previous reviewer.  This cake tasted eggy to me.  I used an angel food cake pan.  It tasted good with peanut butter cup ice cream though.  :)

This is an excellent cake and so very easy to make.  It stays moist for days.  My picture doesn't do the cake itself much justice as I used the cake as a light dessert for Christmas.  I put pastry cream on top then fruit on that.  Just excellent.  I'll be using this recipe a lot
