There is WAY too much sauerkraut in this.  I'm wondering if there's a mistake in the recipe?  It just tasted like sauerkraut with a few random pieces of fish here and there.  I loved the flavor and will definitely make it again, but I'm going to either halve the sauerkraut or double the tomatoes and fish.
