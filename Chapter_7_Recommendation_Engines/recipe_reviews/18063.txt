I made this awhile ago and didn't review it. I thought it was really good---I love the tastes of apple pie and cheese together! I used another recipe from this site---Grandma Ople's apple pie I think it was. Very good combination! Thanks for the post!

My teenage daughter made this recipe last year and had such compliments that she chose to make it again.  She made the crust in a food processor and chilled the shortening in the freezer for a few minutes and it came together beautifully.  Not much crumbling for her.  Her grandfather has enjoyed cheddar cheese on his apple pie for years and this was a new and enjoyable twist to it.

Great taste!  Though it's very crumbly and difficult to roll out.  Roll out as best you can, but it's easier to press it into the pie tin rather than roll it out to perfection.  Double the recipe if making a top crust as well.

This pie crust was exactly what I was looking for. I used it to make an apple pie and it turned out fantastic. Everyone wanted to try it and everyone loved it; even the skeptics. It was a bit crumbly to work with. i think that gives it a rustic quality. I made an extra doughball to make chicken pot pies one night. wish me luck!

My family has long had a slice of Cheddar on top of their pie, so I was excited when I found this recipe.  It was a BIG hit, with my husband (the pie crust fanatic) and my mom (first time they've ever agreed on ANYTHING). It is very crumbly and difficult to handle though, so good luck!

I was not a huge fan of the cornmeal in this pie crust. It came together really well for me, and I will try it again without the cornmeal.

Made as written.  This crust is not my cup of tea. First,  I did not like the texture of the cornmeal at all. It was crunchy, which I find odd in a pie crust.  Second, it was difficult to keep together.  I did what someone else suggested and refridgerated for over an hour and still it fell apart.  I had to make a crosshatched pattern because one simply can not roll this dough out.  I did push it down on the bottom of the pan.  It browned nicely and fluffed up.  Lastly, I did not like the taste.  I think I would prefer something more buttery

Great Crust.  I used it for a shepherds pie, because my husband refuses to try anything new with his apple pie.  I'll be sure to sneak it in someday though.  The crust was very difficult.  I was in a rush so I ended it up pressing the dough into the pie tin which worked well.

maybe I did it wrong, but the crust came out way too thick for my taste. It was hard to roll out without crumbing... Maybe I should have just kept adding water, but I had already added extra... Good flavor though!
