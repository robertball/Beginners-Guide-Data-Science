Tasty but mine hadn't cooked long enough. Followed recipe exactly as stated and it was grainy. Remade recipe, extending cook time to 20 minutes and it was very tasty. Such a creative use for a shortcake shell!

Our camper is in the shop,, so I made this in the oven.. I used a pyrex glass pan.  I melted the butter, then stirred in  the low sugar blend brown sugar.  Placed the pineapple slice with cherry in the middle, with cakes on top.. 
Baked for about 15 mins on 350 degrees.  I used a baster to put some of the butter/sugar mix on the tops of the cakes.. then set the oven on 425 and baked for at least 10 mins more,, I wanted the butter/sugar to caramelize a bit.. Very tasty.  We will make these when camping.
