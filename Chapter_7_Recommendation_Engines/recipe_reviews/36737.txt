Yummy!  My 12-year old and almost-2 year old both really liked it (the adults did too!). I used green enchilada sauce, and it was a better fit for both visual and taste purposes.  Will definitely make again.

I almost didn't try this recipe because of the lackluster reviews, but I'm really glad I did!  I did make some changes - I used a 10oz can of Rotel tomatoes in step 1.  Also, I only used 2 tortillas per layer instead of 4.  With the extra liquid and fewer tortillas, it wasn't dry at all.  Finally, I used prepackaged shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese in both the sauce and topping.  Delicious!  My husband couldn't believe it was "light."  It was even better the next day for lunch.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe.  It smelled really good while I was making it and then when it was baking but the taste was pretty bland.  I ended up adding a bit of chili powder to kind of spice it up.  My husband thought it was ok but on the dry side and I thought the corn tortillas made it kind of mushy.  Not sure if I will make it again.

This was great!! I left out the green chiles, added some chili powder to the broth, used white corn tortillas and it turned out wonderfully. My husband was shocked when he found out it was a light recipe. I will definately be making this again.

This is a really good recipe.  We ended up putting light sour cream and exra salsa on it when we ate it. It was a little dry.  I also used red enchilada sauce.  I would like to try the green as well.  I will definitely make this one again!

I couldn't hardly wait to post about my experience with this recipe. This takes W-A-Y to long to prepare for what you get in the end.  This was not "enchilada-like" at all.  It more resembled a mexican dip.  The corn tortillas absorbed a lot of liquid and turned to mush and the chicken was soooooo overpowered by all the cheese.  Overall, me and my family waited almost 2 hours (from prep time to cooking) for a mexican dip.  I even took the advice of some of the posters and omitted some of the cream cheese...sill only to have it soupy and quite disgusting.  This could have easily been made in the crock pot and served with chips.  Which is what I'll do if I ever have a need for soupy chicken with cheese.  Do yourself and your family a favor....don't bother.

This recipe was a keeper--delicious, though I didn't pay attention to the type of tortillas and so forgot to get corn at the store, so I used flour tortillas and it still turned out yummy!  (Since then I have made it many more times the right way.)  I like how liquidy it is, nice and gooey so you don't miss tons of cheese so much.  Mmmm!

This was EXCELLENT!  As recommended by other reviewers, during Step One I added some (diced) Mexican stewed tomatoes, tsp. of garlic power, cumin, some black pepper & paprika.  I also used red enchilada sauce b/c my hubby doesn't like green - and I couldn't decided whether or not to use flour or corn tortillas so on one side I used corn and on the other I used flour.  We liked the flour side better even though it didn't absorb as much of the sauce.  I also added some green onions and sliced black olives on top of the cheddar cheese which made for a nicer presentation.  This was absolutely delicious, had lots of flavor and I'm sure I'll make it again and again!!

This was very easy to make and very easy to eat.  i made it twice.  The first time I forgot about the cream cheese, so I added light sour cream instead.  This gave me a thinner sauce, but a good taste, if you like sour cream.  The second time I made it, I used soy cream cheese, but did not like the heavier consistency that the cream cheese added.  I added chopped red bell peppers to give the dish more color.  I also sprinkled chopped green onions and olives on top to give it a better presentation. Definitely a delicious meal that also tastes good as a leftover.  Might be good for a large group, a pot luck or something.

This was pretty good. I added extra chili powder, but I wasn't paying attention to how much I shook in the pan so it was way too spicy. :) I didn't have the mushiness problem that others had. I used flour tortillas and block cream cheese. I don't know if that helped. Next time I think i will leave of the crushed chips on top too. I don't think that it added that much to the recipe.

I ADDED A TSP. OF CHILE POWDER, AND TBL. OF GARLIC POWDER, AND CUMIN, WHICH GAVE THE CHICKEN MIXTURE MORE FLAVOR.  IT'S NOT AS CREAMY, BUT I GUESS THAT WOULD ADD ALL THE "CALORIES" AND NO LONGER BE "LIGHT".  HOWEVER, THIS WAS VERY TASTY WITH THE ADDITIONS, AND MY KIDS ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH.

Wonderful!  I ended up using just 9 of the 12 tortillas called for - that cut a few calories that were not missed.  Most of the chicken broth was absorbed, so there was none leftover to "reserve."  I made the mistake of adding a few canned chipotle peppers - we had to smother each bite with fat-free sour cream to cool the heat!  Next time, I will leave out the chipotles, so that I can really enjoy this simple, tasty dish.

This dish was wonderful.  I used fewer tortillas and started with chicken filling on the bottom to make it lower in carbs.  Next time I think I'll add salt and use boneless chicken breasts to make it faster.  My kids and husband loved chicken in a new form. Would probably be good with mushrooms and jalopenos.

I made this casserole last night and was very pleased.  The sauce is creamy and spicy.  This is definitely not a quick casserole to make, there is a little work involved, but if you have the time the results are tasty.  If you enjoy spicy mexican (southwestern) flavored food then this casserole is for you!

What a wonderful comfort food!  I ended up using lean pork loin instead of chicken, and added some sliced zucchini and chopped cilantro (both added to the onion).  Like others, I adjusted the number of corn tortillas, but that was it.  It was very tasty, and even my 4 year old son ate it!  I'll definitely be making this again and again...  (I might even replace the meat with thickly sliced portabello mushrooms to make it a vegetarian dish...)

This is the recipe I've been searching for! A local Mexican rest. serves chicken enchiladas w/ a cream cheese/enchilada sauce/pepperjack cheese sauce that I CRAVE. This is the closest thing I've found to it! I admit that I didn't use low fat and fat free ingredients per recipe, and I did use 8oz. cream cheese, but it was PERFECT!! We will have this many times to come!!

I was concerned by how mixed the reviews for this recipe were, but my husband and I both loved it.  By 4 year old however is in a stage where she will try nothing new and wouldn't even put it in her mouth.
To cut back on prep time I used a store bought rotissarie chicken.  I then sauteed both cans of chilies with the onion, and added the broth with the cheese and enchilada sauce.  I did use all 12 tortillas, but easily see how it could have been cut to 9 and may try that next time.  I used white corn tortillas in the recipe.  I didn't find mine to be dry at all.  In fact, I was very concerned it would be too soupy, but turned out with perfect consistency.  My husband already plans to take the left overs for lunch tomorrow and has asked that I make again soon.

This was a very good recipe. Next time I make it, I may try flour tortillas instead of corn. But I didn't think it tasted bland at all. The sauce had plenty of spice to it from the enchilada sauce. Those who had to add more garlic and such must have a dull tongue! lol My 5 and 2 year olds loved it as well.

This was OK. The flavor was good, but it didn't have a punch. I think I'll make it again, but this time I'll marinate the chicken before cooking it, and add some beans and black olives to the mix and top with salsa.

WOW this was good!  I adapted it to make it lower-carb and it worked out just fine.  Used "lower carb" tortillas and used way less than they recommended.....about one for each layer, ripped up.  Skipped the tortilla chips entirely.  Also did not bother using light cream cheese and I think this may have helped make it less watery as other reviewers had complained, because I did not find it watery at all.  Also, when simmering the chicken prior to shredding it, I added some cumin, garlic powder and onion powder to give the chicken a little extra flavor.  This was so easy, delicious, filling and I can't wait to make it again!

I used neufchatel cheese by accident, and regular milk instead of evaporated milk, but it came out fine. Instead of Monterrey Jack, I used a Mexican 3-cheese blend. I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the chicken broth for cooking the chicken, and used white corn tortillas. I only used about 1/4 of the called-for enchilada sauce, and it came out really creamy and good. I did not top with extra cheese and tortilla chips, but I served it with sour cream, salsa, corn and black olives. Definitely will make this recipe again!

I'm amazed that there are so many diverse reviews on this recipe.  My family loved it.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and was very happy with the way it turned out--it wasn't too mushy or too dry--just right!  My son and wife both loved it too, but my son did say that the tortillas gave should have been "left out."  I don't think he liked the consistency, but I thought they definitely belonged.  Was it bland?  Heck no.  There was more than enough flavor--it was just fabulous.  I can see having this again and again.  I can hardly believe this is "healthy eating," but one can't argue with the nutrition information.  It's there in black and white.

Delicious! It had so much flavor. I'm not sure why some people thought this was dry. Mine turned out a little mushy because the mixture was so soupy, but it turned out pretty good after cooking. The wonderful flavor totally took our minds off the slightly mushy texture. I didn't try the lowfat version. I used regular cheese. I actually used a little whipping cream instead of all the milk. I added a little black pepper because my boyfriend and I love spicy food. I also used red enchilada sauce. The recipe did not specify which kind to use. I'll be making this again!

The corn tortillas soak up all of the liquid and it comes out really cheesy and gooey.  Still, it was missing something.  I will try it again, and I think I might use 9 tortillas instead of 12 and I might add corn and add some beans.  Served over rice if it was a bit more liquidy might be good too.

I thought this was good...it got the job done, anyway.  Nothing that knocked my socks off, but it was quick, easy, and tasty enough.  Will probably top with black olives and green onion in the future.

Great recipe!  I have already made this a couple of times!!  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and some extra cheese.  Everyone in my house loved it!

This was good (& my husband especially LOVED it) but I thought it was a little bland. Next time, I will use spicy enchilada sauce for more zing.

BLAND.BLAND . BLAND.  i love Mexican food, and this had no flavor. without a shaker of salt by my plate i would not have eaten it.  i followed the actual recipe exactly. i had no problem with the "texture" of the dish--including the tortillas--it just had no flavor--and i mean none.  i should have added SOMETHING to give it some zing!

This was delicious. I ended up using more than the called for amount of broth to poach the chicken. I also used fat free cream cheese. I left off the chips on the top. It was a little spicy, but not too.. wasn't in the mood for hot food today. Next time I make this, I think I will add some spices to the chicken mixture as well as maybe some spinach or broccoli.

This has been my husband and I's all time favorite meal and leftovers taste even better!  I follow along with the recipe but usually add one more can of green chilies and cut the corn tortillas in half.  This will reduce some extra calories and will keep the casserole from getting dry since there is less tortillas to absorb the liquid. I have also tried using pepper jack for the cheese and it gives a fantastic kick!

EXCELLENT!!  Love this....even though I screwed up and thought I had enchilada sauce, I substituted pizza sauce for this dish.  LOL  Can't really call it mexican then I guess, but it turned out GREAT!  So I guess if you don't like this cause of "enchilada sauce", try pizza sauce!! LOL  Will make this again for sure (with enchilada next time!) LOL

This could be a 4 star, but im not quite sure how yet.  I will have to play with it.  I followed it exactly and it did turn out OK, but it could be better.  Still good.  I guess we just like a lot spicier food.  Needed cayenne or tabasco.  Otherwise good. Creamy.

This was great!! My family loved it and so did the gang at work.  I did not have skim evaporated milk on hand so I used 1/2 cup 1% milk. It was perfect. Not too wet or dry.  I think I will add additional seasonings next time.
