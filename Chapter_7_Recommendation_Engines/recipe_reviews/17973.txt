This was my Mother's all-time favorite ham loaf recipe, that I thought had been lost for all time, after her death.  The sauce is what makes this ham loaf extra special.  Thank you for posting this!

I really liked this recipe!  I've been looking for a GOOD ham loaf recipe and I think I have finally found one I will make over and over. This will work great for holidays or a cold winter evening meal! I didn't think I was going to like the glaze when I mixed it up, but once it was on the loaf and in the oven.... WOW! It really made it grrrreat!  My loaf was done in a hour, but each oven varies. Thanks Pam! :)

This was surprising ..kind of a cross between deviled ham and spam, but WAY better!!! Served it with ham gravy the night it was made and used the rest for FANTASTIC sandwiches! I will definitely make it again.

This is a great main dish.  Even the kids (ages 3 to 11) liked it.  I used ham from the freezer that had previously been shredded fine. Did not add salt because the ham seemed salty as it was.

Great leftover too.

This recipe is almost identical to our family recipe. Some variations include adding uncooked bacon strips across the top of the loaf, basting a simple sauce of a 1 can condensed tomato soup diluted with 1 1/2 -2 cans water, and serving with homemade or store-bought horseradish sauce (1 pt. whipped cream, mix in one bottle well drained horseradish). Delicious!  One more thing, ground ham is not commonly available. You can buy a thick slice of ham and  use your food processor to "grind" it into a nice ground ham texture.

A few tweaks, as this isn't quite the recipe I was looking for and I haven't found it on this site. This is my MIL's-it's great!  I use 1 lb ground ham, 1 lb ground beef, 3/4 c. graham cracker crumbs, 2 egss, 1/2 c. milk, plus seasonings (onion, garlic,salt, pepper) Mix loaf.  For sauce, 1 can tomato soup, 1/2 or so dark brown sugar, 1/4 c. apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp ground mustard and 1 tbs Worchester, mix together, pour sauce on loaf.  350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.

Ham Loaf is a favorite in our house.  This is an excellent recipe to try.  I differ the glaze recipe, just a little.  I use:  1 c. brown sugar, 1 t. dry mustard, 1/2 c. vinegar & 1/2 c. water.  I bring that mixture to a boil and reduce and simmer for 2 minutes.  I then pour the sauce over the ham loaf and bake & baste the entire 90 minutes.  Added a salad, baked potato and 'Kim's Garlic Breadsticks' from AR and we had a terrific dinner.  Thanks Pam for sharing your recipe.

I've never had ham loaf before but my husband is from southeastern PA (York) and he had it as a lad and young man. So I tried this recipe and said it was right on. So thank you! I also enjoyed it and will be making this again. I only had 1 pound of ground pork so I used that. It was a bit crumbly so maybe that was from using not quite enough ground pork.

I used reciepe exactly as written and it was great!! I would change nothing. I went to local butcher and had him grind the ham and pork.It would serve 10 easily with two sides. I served roasted sweet and white potato cubes and a salad. Marvelous.

Very good.  The only thing I changed was to cut the recipe in half and baked in a loaf pan.  The vinegar was too strong for our tastes, so next time I will cut the amount in half.

Been looking to make a ham loaf since my grandmother passed away (hers was an absolute favorite of mine).  Finally got around to it and must say that this recipe was spot on!!  I did make a couple of substitutions.  I used ground turkey instead of ground pork and graham cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I also shaped the meat into several little loaves and baked for 1 hour.  My 2 year old devoured a giant portion.  No need to look any further for a ham loaf recipe.

Great ham loaf!! It multiplies good as well, I was making it for a big crowd and multiplied it 12 times to make a huge batch, and it was perfect, a lot of recipes don't come out the same when you make a big batch.  The sauce is EXCELLENT!!! Will make again and again.

This recipe is nearly identical to my grandmother's recipe.  We always had this for Christmas and I loved it.  I now make it and it's a huge hit.  The only thing I do differently sometimes is make the meat into balls rather than a loaf.  It uses less cooking time.

We had never had hamloaf before and didn't know what to expect.  We were very pleased as it was very tasty using the recipe as is.  Next time we make this we will definately experiment and add some onions and other items for a bit more flavor.

Just like my family recipe.  Terrific!  Our tradition is to make gravy with the extra glaze/drppings.  Sweet and delicious over mashed potatoes.

This was awesome!  So sweet and tangy.  My husband always talked about the ham loaf his mom made, and I'd never heard of it.  I made this exactly as the recipe said, and he loved it.  Thanks!

This is wonderful.  I had never heard of Ham Loaf until my mother was in a personal care home recovering and Ham loaf was served.  I was so glad to find a similar recipe here.  The only thing, next time I want to add a little ground clover for a bit of spice. Also, instead of one big loaf i made small (4oz) individual loaf, baked them 30 minutes, spooned the sauce over and baked for the additional 15 minutes.  I cook for my mother and myself, so i frozen the extra loafs with out baking, but they will be ready to go next time.

I made this last night for dinner and it turned out great - I only used 2 pounds of meat but all of the sauce - and added a little bit of ketchup to the sauce.  Looking forward to eating leftovers tonight :)

This is a really good recipe. I made it into 2 loaves instead of one so now I have one to freeze for a later dinner.

Yes it was awful! I would leave out the vinegar.. it gives it too uch of a twang. Made it have a spoiled meat taste.

THIS is my Great-Grandmother's recipe almost exactly! The only difference is graham cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. We had this every Christmas and Easter! I have tried other recipes since she passed away, but this one is IT!! Thank you so much for posting it, every other recipe was missing "something", this was only missing the graham cracker crumbs.

This was a hit at our house.  I did follow the recipe ingredients exactly but my loaf was done in 1 hour as well.  Had I cooked longer, it would have been dried out.  I do think the recipe ends up being quite salty from the salt in ham so next time, I would omit the salt completely and won't even bother with the 1/8 teaspoon it calls for.  I also think 8 servings for this recipe is conservative, it is would serve at least 10 people or more, unless you are feeding hungry football players :)  Great recipe.

This is my favorite allrecipe!! Only thing I do differently is make little loaves, stays together better and everyone gets their own.  The sauce is amazing, so I suggest doubling it so you have plenty to cover the ham.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe Pam!

This is a great and easy recipe. We have our butcher grind the two meats together (unfortunately we have to buy about 15lbs at a time). But, it freezes well. We made hamballs (like meatballs) served over rice. We even made HAMburgers on the grill. SOO Tasty!

My boyfriend wanted me to join up, just so I could leave a review for this recipe.  He LOVED it, and he is a picky eater.  He had 3 helpings of it, and could not stop raving about it.  It is the best hamloaf that he has ever had.  This is a keeper!  Thank you!!

This was very, very good. I used my food processor to grind up the ham as my market doesnt carry it. I will be making this more often.

I went into the recipe not really knowing what a ham loaf was supposed to taste like, so, I am sure that for a ham loaf it is probably very good, but, it is just too bland for our taste. The glaze was a nice compliment but we just didn't really care for the taste of the actual ham loaf. It took me a long time to figure out what it tasted like and I finally realized it tasted a lot like spam which I haven't had since I was a kid. I wasn't sure if the ground ham was supposed to be cooked or not, so, I actually ground up leftovers of a smoked picnic ham I had already cooked.  If it was supposed to be uncooked - I am sure this would change the texture for sure and possibly the taste.  I don't see myself making this again.  I'm going to try slicing it and searing it in a pan to see if we like it on a sandwich to use up the leftovers.

Ham Loaf is one of my favorite meals.  As a child we only had it for special occassions.  I found this recipe five years ago, loved it then but misplaced it.  When the kids asked what I wanted for my Mother's Day meal I had to find this recipe again.  So glad it's still here!  Hopefully the kids will get it right!

This is the first time I have ever even tasted ham loaf, and it was delicious! My dad raved over it too. I was afraid that I wouldn't like the glaze, but that's what made it so great. I will definitely make this again.

Great way to use up holiday ham.  It freezes well, so rather than wasting the left over ham, grind it up and make a ham loaf.  Wrap well and pop in the freezer.  I also put a copy of the glaze on the outside of the package so that when I want to use it, I will have the sauce instructions easily.  Excellent ham loaf!

I had not made a hamloaf in years and came across the ham loaf mixture at my local meat market so I decided to try it. Found this recipe and only added a little chopped onion to it. I made my own bread crumbs. I put it in my crock pot on high for about 5 hours. You know it's done when the edges start to dry out and brown  then I poured the sauce over the top and left it in another 30 minutes. Served with salad and fresh corn. My husband could not stop eating it I made it for my daughters family and they also loved it. All I have to say is don't eat on the day you make it because once you taste it you will be picking at it til is GONE!!   Makes great sandwiches too. I'm getting company for the week end and I am going to make it into meatballs.

My husband's grandmother made this for him growing up.  I tried over and over to replicate it.  When I found this recipe, he went crazy.  He said it was the best he ever ate and I have to agree with him.  This was amazing.  I don't know what mistake someone made that they had to throw it away, because this was perfect.

This was delicious.  My first time making and eating ham loaf.  This recipe seemed to be the simplest, with fewest ingredients, and simple dishes seem to turn out the best! It's a Lancaster, PA staple, and being a transplant had to find out what the ham loaf love was all about! I'm sold!

I was scared by the addition of the evaporated milk--it looked 'soupy'-- but this was hands down the best ham loaf ever!!! Made whipped sweet potatoes only flavored with butter and s&p, green beans and rolls. Think this will be a Christmas Eve dish this year!

Very good, the adults all loved it.  My 3 year old and 4 year old liked it too, and if I had caught them in a better mood they probably would have loved it as well.  The sauce is especially good.  I wish it were more dense, but other then that I think it is perfect.

So good.  I previously made this same recipe into ham meatballs with glazing them when in the oven with the sauce.  I found this to be less labor intensive for me and just as good!
I do put some of the sauce  into the loaf pan , and then pop the remainder into the microwave for a minute or two and it turns syrupy... cool and can pour over the slices.  Just doesn't get any better!   Since only two of us I do cut it all in half and do not use the evap. milk .    Thanks!!

I substituted sour cream  (1/2 cupJ for the evaporated milk and bacon rinds for the breadcrumbs to make it low carb.  I made the glaze with tapioca flour (2 tbs), maple exrtract and bourbon (2oz). I added 1/2 cup of Diet Coke for color and stevia for sweetener (4 drops of liquid)
Looked great and tasted good.  It was appreciated by those at the gathering who try to eat low carb.

Ham loaf turned out great! I made a honey and mustard glaze to serve with the ham loaf.  This loaf makes great sandwiches as a left over meal!

Excellent. I made it keto-friendly by subbing pork rinds for the dried bread crumbs, and heavy whipping cream for the evaporated milk. For the brown sugar, I used Truvia brown sugar.  I've made it several times for my husband and mother, and both agree that it is delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

It is a really good hamloaf recipe.  Besides being easy the mix to put on top gave it an unusual topping. Not the same old boring ketchup mix. Have made it twice now.

I was looking for a recipe for ham loaf that was as close as possible to what I've enjoyed eating many times in the northwestern Pennsylvania region.  In my experience, ham loaf is a staple of northwestern Pennsylvania "cuisine."   You can buy pre-made frozen ham loaves from any grocery store there.   Although my family roots are in western PA, no family recipe exists.  The best ham loaf I've eaten has an incomparable sweetness and a subtle spice to it that I can't put my finger on.  This recipe, while good, did not exactly replicate the ideal, but it'll do.  I admit to tweaking it just a bit even on the first try.  The recipe calls for a total of 3 1/2 pounds of meat, and anybody can tell that makes for a ridiculously huge loaf.  There is no need to have one gigantic loaf that has to bake for 90 minutes.  The ham loaf you buy in PA is always a rather petite loaf, so I just divided my batch in half and formed two smaller loaves.  Since the loaves were smaller, they did not have to bake as long.  I had to crank up the oven to 400 halfway through as well because a family member needed to eat and run.  It worked fine.  The loaves were done in about an hour and 10 minutes.  Also, I added just 1/8 tsp. of allspice to the actual meat mix to try to replicate the flavor of PA ham loaf.  It worked modestly well.  The glaze called for by this recipe, while seeming a bit strange at first, was fantastic, turning out beautifully.  I kept adding it with a basting brush until it was all on.

So I am gluten free and dairy free.....I used gf panko bread crumbs - about 3/4 cup, and then same amount of almond milk rather than evaporated milk.   I also had purchased only a lb of ground pork.   The leftover Easter ham was about 1.5 lbs.   It was awesome!!   A real keeper of a recipe and my son loved it!  I might cook it 10 minutes less the next time, maybe because of my adjustments, but the outside was sweet and crunchy.  I also used 2 bread loaf pans rather than a 9x13 pan.  Great recipe!

made these into meatballs using ground pork as the only meat. baked them in the oven, ala Alton Brown's method, ( make each ball a bit larger than the openings on a mini muffin pan, then suspend the balls over each opening in a large mini muffin pan).  As written, gets 4 stars cuz was a bit too sweet for our family, but that is just us. I actually forgot to mix in the egg and we never missed it! The meat  was not crumbly at all, really a perfect little meatball! The recipe seemed plain ( we like onions, etc..) so i mixed in 1 pkg of onion soup mix and omitted the salt, amped up the pepper alot, and added garlic powder. Really, probably deserves 4.5 stars cuz was wonderful, I just will ease back on sugar next time.  Thanks for posting, was awesome! To save time in rest of meal, I baked some rice that was flavored with add ins of onions, carrots, baked in broth... that recipe is from this site as "baked rice" and I  added that into the last 30 minutes of the baking.  A salad completed the easy and tasty meal!

Yum!!!   Ham loaf is such a comfort food and this is a great recipe.  I always make this when I have ham leftovers.  I put 2 T. ketchup in my glaze and wait til the last 30 minutes to pour on the sauce.  The leftover glaze is wonderful on baked potatoes!

Very odd....It wasn't bad, just different than anything I have ever had.  The glaze was very much needed.  Made it into 2 smaller sized loaves.  We ate one for dinner, then froze the other and ate it cold on bread like a meatloaf sandwich.  Won't make all the time, but nice for a change.
