Cheap, quick, and easy!  I put oil and three kernels in the pot, when all three kernels pop I add the sugar and stir it around well, then I add the rest of the popcorn kernels and put the lid on.  Then I alternate shaking the pot for three seconds with letting it sit on the burner for three seconds until I hear the popping begin to slow down, then I take off the lid and sprinkle some salt in, replace the lid, give it another shake and pour it out into a bowl.  Haven't had a batch burn yet with the "3-second shake and sit" technique.  ;-)

SUCCESS!!! The other reviewers aren't kidding, this kettle corn tastes just like the stuff at the fair. Here are some tips... I used a wide and heavy bottom stainless steel pan with high sides. Be sure to use the 3 kernel test (Preheat your pan with medium-high heat, add all of the oil along with 3 kernels of popcorn. When the 3 kernels pop, the oil is ready!). Once the oil is ready, add the rest of the popcorn and quickly sprinkle the sugar on top. Place a lid on the pan. Alternate, in three second intervals, between leaving the pan on the stove top and lifting and shaking the pot. Once the popping has slowed, remove from the stove top and immediately sprinkle with salt. Let it cool a little and try not to eat the whole batch!

I am the "sue" who submitted this recipe and I am so glad & thankful for the great reviews!  I had the 3 kernal test (I always use Orville Redenbachers's corn too as the better corn really makes a difference) in the directions and was a little disapointed to see when the recipe appeared online - had been left out.  I always use a stir crazy popcorn machine as this is always a multiple batch making recipe @ my house - left over corn is not as good but still always eaten!!  I heat the oil, put in 3 kernals and when they pop - add the sugar.  When it melts (happens quickly) add the rest of corn.  As soon as the popping stops, dump it into a waiting bowl and sprinkle with salt.  Dive in and enjoy!

Great snack, Sue. I added 1/4t salt to the sugar and oil. This way the salt and sugar form a crispy coating around the kernel. Yummy!

I don't have one of those neat hand-crank popcorn-making-thingys.  I have absolutely zero experience making popcorn on the stove.  What I do have is a pot that I normally use for chili and pasta, a fondness for kettle corn, and a heck of a of a nerve on me.  Here's what I did, mistakes and all:  I did the 3-kernel test, and then added the sugar and the popcorn at the same time.  (I'm not going to call that a mistake, but I think next time I'll add the sugar, let it melt, and then add the popcorn - the way I did it this afternoon, the popcorn started to pop before the sugar was melted.)  I used canola oil and thought it was fine.  I added 1 tsp of salt plus a pinch or two to the sugar; next time I might stick to just 1 tsp, as I found some pieces to be a little salty.  I did the three-seconds-on-the-heat/three-seconds-off-the-heat thing, shaking the entire time, and I probably pulled it a little early because I'd rather have a few unpopped kernels than burned sugar and popcorn.  The end result was very, very tasty.  Some of the pieces carmelized quite a bit, others didn't; I preferred the ones that didn't, but that didn't stop me from eating the entire batch by myself.  Cleanup was no problem; the cooled sugar melted right off again with hot water.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Edit:  Later, I tried letting the sugar melt before adding the popcorn.  I thought the sugar carmelized too much - it tasted burned instead of sweet.  I'll add them at the same time from now on.

Wow!  This became a really fast hit in my family.  After making it a few times, though, I do have some suggestions.  The last time I made it was the best.  Instead of using oil, I melted about 1/4 cup of butter flavored shortening.  It made the kernels pop much faster lighter, and had a hint of a buttery taste.  Very nice.  I also, added a  few drops of decorator's icing coloring to the melted shortening and sugar mixture.  When the popcorn pops, it explodes into a really beautiful color.

You can even mix two colors together[only two batches of popcorn is needed for that;)]

This was really good.  It did take me a couple of tries to perfect the technique though.  The first few times I made it, I had a big gooey mess in the bottom of the pot.  Make sure you start shaking as soon as the corn starts to pop and don't stop until it is done.

A few recommended tips :   1.) The shaking of the popcorn is key, however remove the popcorn from cooking pot ASAP, or the shaking you did over the stove will be rendered pointless.   2.) Heat up the oil with 3 popcorn kernels, when those 3 pop add sugar, and rest of the kernels. WAIT 30 SECONDS, this ensures all your kernels are the same tempature and will not burn.  3.)Use peanut oil if no one is allergic for better flavor outcome.  4.) Use both sugars, my family likes confection sugar vs. white sugar. Our ratio for the recipe is more confetioners sugar than brown.  5.) If you're a sweet and salty person add salt to taste. In our family we add a lot.  6.) For a small hint of butter, after your popcorn is done popping and is in a diffrent bowl, use the hot cooking pot you cooked your popcorn in to melt butter and then drizzle over your popcorn, this is simply delicious !   Good snack on New Years Day at 1 am, thank you !

This is the best popcorn I've ever had. I first added three kernals until they popped, then added the sugar to the oil and stirred it a bit so most of the sugar dissolves in the oil.  Then I added the rest of the kernels.  This is really easy to make and it absolutely taste great!!!

I've made this one many times & I absolutly love it!  Beware it's easy to burn!  I had a girls night out movie night at my house and all my girlfriends raved about it, it's addicting.  I haven't tried it with brown sugar yet. I think that I also added 1/4 tsp salt with the sugar. 

DON'T DO THIS AT HOME: DON'T TRY TO DO THE SAME THING WITH POWDERED CHEESE :)I did and it burnt like nothing else! I figured if I added the powdered cheese in place of the sugar it would coat the popcorn like the sugar does, well it doen't! :)

This is a great recipe!  I used half oil and half butter and added just two popcorn kernals. Once they popped I poured in the popcorn, sugar and a little salt.  Just keep shaking it.

Aftre three batches in a row, my neighbor and I perfected this: In a small bowl, melt 2tbls of butter.  Add the kernels, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1 tsp. salt.  Mix and set aside. Heat oil until one kernel  pops then add your kernel mixture.  Shake vigorously while popping.  Wait until completely cooled before eating.

This is a family movie night staple for us. Delicious, just like the kind made at festivals but without the $6-$8 per bag price. I put three kernels of popcorn in the oil while it's heating; when they pop, I know the oil it hot enough. Then I add the rest of the popcorn and shake the pot until the popcorn is covered in oil. Next, I sprinkle the sugar on top of the popcorn and shake to mix. If you pour the sugar into the oil before the popcorn, it clumps. I leave the pot on the burner for 5 seconds, then pick it up and shake it for 5 seconds, repeating until I don't hear any more popping. I pour the kettle corn into two large bowls and sprinkle with salt, mixing and breaking up any clumps of popcorn until it cools.

This recipe is ALMOST as good as the kettle corn I had at The Shaker Woods Festival (in Ohio). My suggestion is to not do the three kernal test as some have suggested. I did the three kernal test and the three popped kernals sat in the kettle and soaked up the oil while they waited for the just added kernals to come up to popping temperature. I ended up with a lot of unpopped kernals this way.  They got stuck to the sugary popped kernals which made my kettle corn not very much fun to eat. My suggestions is to put ALL of the oil and ALL of the popcorn in a big non-stick stock pot on med-high heat. Once the oil starts boiling add the sugar before the popcorn starts popping. After it starts popping alternate between leaving it on the burner and lifting it off the burner in intervals. When popping ceases,  transfer the popcorn to a BIG bowl. Before it "dries" stir it and salt it to your families taste. Then let it completely dry and stir it again. The popcorn  will easily seperate. Thanks for sharing!

Once again Im convinced that I dont need another cookbook-I only need Allrecipes.com!
This is an awesome recipe. I was at a farmer's market and bought some kettle corn and ate the whole bag myself. 
I needed to learn to make this myself-and this recipe is perfect.
I read many reviews and followed some of their advice:
*I did the 3 kernel test.
*I added a tsp of salt to the sugar
*I added the sugar to the oil after the 3 kernels popped and swirled it around to melt before adding the rest of the popcorn.
*I shook it like crazy.
*Im eating handfuls of it as I type.
Thanks for a great recipe. Next time Im going to try the brown sugar.

Smashing! I used a blend of white and dark brown sugar and the result was one that no one at the party could resist! I'm sure this will be our home-cinema snack as well. Thanks Sue. The second time I made this, I added a tablespoon of butter and popcorn has never been crunchier!

In a word - fabulous.  I've made this several times and have found that spraying the pan with nonstick spray helps in the popping.  I also heat the oil and sugar with a few kernals and once they begin to pop, add the rest.  I used 3 Tbsp. canola oil and 1 Tbsp butter. and finish it off with a bit of salt - perfect every time.

This is delicious! I have been looking for a recipe like that tastes like the stuff from the fair and this is it! When it' s just me eating it, I put 2 T of kernels in with 1 T oil and 1 T sugar. It's a perfect serving for myself (and keeps me from eating an entire batch).

I made this for the first time last night and of course the first batch didn't turn out well.  I had half of the popcorn kernels still left in the bottom of the pan and the sugar had turned into caramel. It took me a while to clean up my pan and I was determined to get it right.  So, I tried again using a non-stick skillet...making sure to shake about every 5 seconds and of course using a lid. I sprinkled the sugar over the kernels instead of pouring it all in the pan. The sencond batch turned out a lot better than the first.  I still had several unpoppep kernels at the bottom, but the ones that did pop were very good!!  Thanks Sue.

This is awesome!  Definately a keeper.  I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and made the corn with Butter Flavored Shortening & also added about 1 tsp salt to the sugar & corn.  I played around with it a lot, I found that the best pan to make it in for me was my Wok.  It seemed to pop faster and better than in a pot.  I also added colored icing (I read the suggestion wrong and bought that instead of the icing coloring), and made some purple and orange popcorn to give to our neighborhood kids for halloween.  I am so glad I found this recipe!  ****Update****  It has been 11 days since I discovered this recipe and I have made approximately 22 batches of this!  I made some for the neighborhood kids I know for Halloween (6 batches) & some for my sons classroom (8 batches).  The rest has been for the family & friends.  I just watned to add that I also tried the O.R. Butter Flavored Popping Oil and it's the same as using the shortening.  I will continue to use the shortening as it comes out cheaper.  One bottle of the oil makes 4 batches.  One package of 3 bars of butter flavored shortening make 12 batches and it is cheaper than the oil.

Living in Europe, I have become addicted to the sweet popcorn sold in cinemas here and have been trying to make it at home for months.  I recently tried a recipe similar to this one and ended up with a handful of burnt popcorn and a sticky black mess on the bottom of my brand new stainless steel pan, which took two hours to clean.  Then I found this recipe, read all the reviews, and learnt a few things.  1) Use a TEFLON pan.  2) Use WHITE sugar.  3) Heat three popcorn kernels in the oil until they pop, THEN add the sugar and remaining kernels.  4) SHAKE the pan constantly!  Success at last!!

THANK YOU SO MUCH! My neighbor saw this recipe here and passed it along to me! I love this site and frequent it often myself. I made a batch last night and it was INHALED - my 4 yr old prefers 'regular' (micro) popcorn, but my 7 yr old and my husband (10 mon old isn't allowed to have it yet!) just devoured it!

We went to the pool today w/ some friends and I made another batch this morning to take w/ us and we ate it all again. My friend who came along said she could have eaten the entire bag herself!

Thanks again! It's delicious! I use enough oil to coat the bottom of my pan, heat it til it liquifies, then add my sugar, half cup,  and popcorn, continuously shaking/moving my pan as to not to burn. Has come out perfect each time :)

Mmm!  I took the combined advice of those who came first: heat the 3 T. of oil with a few kernels until they pop, add the sugar and stir, add the popcorn, put on some oven mits and shake!  Don't forget to shake even after you take the pan off the fire because there is still a lot of heat/popping and the popcorn can still burn (I did it!).  Put it in a bowl quickly before it clumps or sticks.  Then I quickly sprinkle on salt, a little more sugar (or Splenda), and some Butter Buds.  Stir it up or shake it and it is a perfect snack!

I made this with my Stir Crazy popcorn popper, adding the oil and one popcorn kernal. When that kernal popped, I dumped in the sugar, and when that had melted (maybe 20 seconds later), added the rest of the popcorn and shook the thing til they were all popped... Aside from putting on a little salt, I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe, it turned out just perfect!

Fast, easy, really good! My daughter and a friend were settling in to watch a movie and the friend asked sweetly "Do you have Kettle Corn?" I told her sorry, but no, then immediately thought of allrecipes. I am by no means an experienced stove top popcorn maker but I rocked this recipe! I cobbled together the advice of several different reviewers and used my best pot (a heavy-bottomed stainless steel stock pot), preheated the pot at medium heat, added the oil and 3 kernels to the warm pot, and waited for all 3 kernels to pop. I had the 1/4 cup sugar ready (with 1/4 tsp salt added to it), poured it in and stirred it quickly to start it dissolving in the oil, then added the rest of the popcorn. I followed the 3 seconds on/3 seconds off method, holding the lid onto the pot with potholders. I swirled rather than shook the first few rounds to help dissolve the rest of the sugar mixture and coat the kernels. Using this method I ended up with very few unpopped kernels and no burned pieces. Some of the pieces were slightly browned/carmelized and the rest were glazed with a shiny clear coating. It was all delicious. Needless to say, this was a big hit with the girls (our guest asked me at least 3 times to give this recipe to her mom). My husband and I ate our share quickly for fear they would come back looking to raid our bowls. I look forward to making this again and again for family and friends.

First time making popcorn in a pan, ever.  And the experience was highly rewarding. Followed the three second directions from the top two reviews.  The popcorn becomes a perfect crisp that you don't find using a hot air popper or microwave.  Yummy!!

Ok, apparantly I was not meant to master the art of kettle corn! My husband and myself tried this recipe THREE times and each time it came out horrible.  The first time he went off the reviews and used 3/4 cup sugar and we ended up with a big gooey brown mess all over the popcorn! Yuck..the second time I used the amount of sugar the recipe called for and less oil (4tbls seemed like WAY too much) and it still came out horrible...I figured third time was a charm right?? I guess not because we used the called for amount of everything, I even took some of the previous reviewers advice and waited for some of the kernels to pop before adding the sugar (which is tough because you don't want to get hit in the face with a scorching hot popcorn kernel!) and it still came out horrible. I LOVE kettle corn, but could not master this recipe!  Please someone enlighten me! so maybe I will be inclined to try this again! Otherwise I'll have to keep it at 1 star and I hate giving up to easily! Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely incredible! I no longer make popcorn any other way! Kettle corn has always been a favorite of mine-- who knew it was so easy to make yourself? I usually halve the recipe which makes enough for 1-2 people. The first time I made this I burned it horribly, but I've caught on to a few tricks since then. First of all, add only the vegetable oil and three kernels. When the kernels pop, add the rest of them along with the sugar. I then use a wooden spoon to constantly stir the mixture until the rest of the kernels start popping. This prevents the sugar from burning and helps to evenly distribute it among the kernels. After covering the pot, alternate with three seconds shaking and three seconds on the heat until the popping slows down. You want to make sure the heat is high enough unless it will take much longer to pop all the kernels and most will burn. All in all this should only take a few minutes. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Doesn't work !   Tried following the recipe using medium heat, the corn popped but the sugar turned brown and stuck to the bottom of the pot. Increased oil - same result.  Increased heat - same result.  3 pots of mess was enough for me to declare this a failure.

Good but not quite as sweet as I expected.  We enjoyed it but the fair kettle corn is much better.  Next time I'm going to try the butter flavored crisco over the oil.  I'm sure it would make it more flavorful.

Kettle corn made at home, who would have thought it possible???!!!  This is just amazing.  I read the reviews before making the first batch, and it came out perfectly.  I have a new smooth ceramic top stove, so I can't shake the pan while it's on the burner...I just waited until it started to pop, then removed the pan from the heat and shook it, then put it back on the heat for a few seconds, etc.  The whole process probably took only a minute once the popcorn started popping.  Again, this is amazing.  Never will I pay $5 for a bag of kettle corn again!

This is SO GOOD!  I skimmed all of the reviews and took some things into account before making my first batch.  I used a Revere Ware pan that is at least 15 years old and is not coated (worked just fine).  I used peanut oil, which I think addresses the heavy oiliness that someone else mentioned - peanut oil has a high scorching point and very light flavor.  I did everything as in the recipe except I used 5T of oil instead of 4.  I cooked it on the "maximum output" burner of my gas stove, with the dial at level 7.  I couldn't find any documentation that listed the exact flame output of the burner, but I know it is on the high side of a normal household stovetop.  I think the key is to shake and sometimes remove the pan from the heat.  When it would really start popping, I would set it on another burner for about 15 seconds, or whenever the popping slowed.  At that point, I poured off the top (popped) kernels into a bowl, and then put the pan back on the heat.  Personally, I agree that sprinkling salt on when it is still warm adds the perfect extra flavor.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe was great. I didn't make it exactly but the directions on how to pop to prevent burning were spot on. I don't use white sugar but instead Truvia, 0 calorie sweetner. So much more healthy. Oh and I use olive oil and usually just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. DO NOT USE SPLENDA it just burns up and turns black. I won't buy packaged pop corn EVER!

My kid needed a quick contribution for a St. Patty's day party at school tomorrow.  To make colored kettle corn, add about 6 drops of food color to the oil before you begin to heat it.  The food dye will pop and sputter a little but don't let that worry you.  Add the corn and sugar and you'll have fun colored popcorn.  (Ours was green)

This recipe sucks. It doesn't tell you to add the popcorn, let it start popping, THEN add sugar, and mix. It tells you to add sugar and popcorn all at once. I did what the recipe said, and it turned into a nasty blob that never popped. I am poor, and do not enjoy wasting food. Look somewhere else, or at other reviewers tips.

AWESOME! Very much like the Kettle Corn at the Fair!  It was not hard to make at all... I let the oil heat up until the first couple popped then stirred in the sugar with a big spoon.  I did add about 1/4 tsp. of salt... will add more next time.

This tastes just like you get at the fair.  Much less expensive.  I will never buy Kettle Corn again.  This is so easy to make.  I tried the three kernel test like someone mentioned and then added my popcorn and sugar.  I also shook the pan for 3 seconds and let it pop for 3 seconds, alternating, like another mentioned.  I also added a little salt when it was done popping. Turned out perfectly delicious.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

My 12 year old declared this better than the kettle corn from the fair, and that's all she ever begs for when we go.  I did use the 3 kernal technique, and added the sugar and 1/2 tsp salt to the oil and swirled for about 10 seconds before adding the popcorn.  Worked beautifully.  The second time I accidentally added 1/2 c. sugar... NOT recommended!  The sugar mostly carmelized and gave a burnt flavor before the popcorn fully popped.

before i made this i was really nevous about it burning so i made sure i read all the reviews. I found that it works best putting all the oil and popcorn in the pan, when the oil starts to boil add sugar. When it starts to pop put lid on and alternate holding it over the heat for 3 seconds and shaking for 3 seconds. I also add about 1 tsp salt at when its done. I would reccomend using high quality popcorn, i've made this several times and when i use the orvel redenbacher vs the cheap store bran it turns out MUCH better

Eh. This recipe needs to be tweaked. You cannot merely dump the ingredients in a pot and shake over heat and expect it to come out right. This is what I did, and since the sugar and oil coagulate, the corn can't move when you shake it. This results in burning.  It was pretty sad. Mine burned pretty bad and the bottom of the pan was a black sticky mess.  What DID come out ok did taste fine. I would suggest using that corn-popper thing with the handle that you turn that other people here used on this recipe. I may try this again but for now I'll stick to the microwaveable kettle corn.  A lot less trouble and it comes out perfect. I'd give it fewer stars, but I fault the cook this time (ME) since so many of you had such good luck with this one.

Very good! I used half white/half brown sugar, shortening rather than oil, and added a teaspoon of "Butter Buds" with the sugars for a delicate buttery taste. I added a bit (1/4 teaspoon) of salt with the sugar, and sprinkled on a bit more salt when it was popped.

Thank you! This recipe is awesome! I love kettle corn from the fair and this is an almost perfect match. I used a whirley popper and it came out perfect. I will try adding just a touch of salt next time like the others. Again, THANKS!!!!

I too had problems with this recipe although it sounded wonderful.  I used an electric stove.  I'm wondering what Sue used.  I kept it on med. heat and it took a very long time and they all did not pop in fact it started to burn.  Maybe someone with an electric stove could submit a similar recipe.

My sister-in-law gave me a recipe for kettle corn years ago and after umpteen burned messes I finally threw it away.  The drive for kettle corn outweighed my fears, however, and I tried this recipe using a "whirly-pop".  Success!!!  I have to recommend using pure, unadulterated LARD for popping (or bacon grease).  It imparts a depth of flavor to this popcorn like you can't believe.  Think of slightly sweet-slightly bacon-y perfection.  Died and gone to heaven!

I used this recipe many times with results ranging from "edible but kind of burnt" to "scorched". Then I found Cat Cora's kettle corn recipe which calls for adding the sugar immediately AFTER the corn is popped, then heating for another 20 seconds while shaking the pot. It worked SO much better. I can't recommend Cat's method highly enough. I also recommend adding a bit of salt (or Flavacol!) with the sugar for an authentic salty-sweet taste.

I would never use vegetable oil for popcorn. Instead my family uses butter flavored popcorn oil (or coconut oil)and a bit more sugar. This was a hit for us!

This was a great snack!  For all those diabetics out there, Splenda works great in place of sugar.

This was excellent!!! As mentioned in earlier posts, I added a kernel or two to the oil and waited for it to pop before adding the rest of the popcorn and sugar. I also added a little salt at the end. A definite keeper!! Thanks.

I'd give this recipe 6 stars if i could! it was easy and fast and delicious. after seeing that this recipe was a little fattening, i lowered the oil to 3 tablespoons and used less sugar, but it still tasted amazing! A little pinch of salt brought out a lot of flavour. the trick for success is to cover the pan so that heat wont escape and the kernels will pop better. you also won't have popcorn hitting your face.i will never eat microwave kettle corn again. I also tried the brown sugar variation but it didn't turn out well. the sugar burned before the kernels could pop. the result was bitter and didn't taste like caramel at all.

This is a treacherous, yet absolutely delicious, snack. Beware of the un-popped kernels that have glued themselves to the popped corn, lying in wait to shatter your teeth. You must also be vigilant and avoid the molten sugar that hasn't cooled enough to solidify yet, lest your tongue be seared. If you are successful in avoiding these pit traps, be prepared for some amaaaazing mouthfuls!

I'll start out by admitting I've never really liked kettle corn.  And then I tried this recipe.  OMG, this was so amazing! I followed the 3 kernel test and used white sugar. I can't believe how crispy and yummy this was.  I'm excited to try brown sugar next time for more of a caramel taste.

Mine came out almost like carmel corn. I use organic, unbleached sugar which may be why (it's not brown sugar, but darker than white sugar.) I think you really need white sugar to get the real kettle corn taste/look. I won't make this again.

I have no idea what I did wrong on such a simple recipe but I used Safflower oil because its supposed to be healthier. followed the instructions to a T. The only thing I noticed was that after I added all the kernals (after the 3 kernal test) They didnt pop hardly at all and I was worried about burning it all. 
My result was brown popcorn that looked and tasted burnt. I couldn't taste the sugar hardly at all and what I could taste was burnt popcorn and oil. My kernals didnt even pop big... they were all small in size.
I will try this again but I am not going to get my hopes up.

We tried recipe as written first, and the result was burnt sugar and inedible.  Tried again adding sugar after kernels were coated in oil and ready to pop.  Due to electric stove top, we had to let sit a few seconds and shake, sit and shake, sit and shake.  After it finished popping, we added a sprinkle of salt.  Our end product was quite tasty and would rate 4 stars.

LOVED this.  The only thing it needs is salt, but I still gave it five stars because I figure the OP forgot (the "salty" is a just as much a main ingrediant as the "sweet" in kettle corn...right?) this is so easy. Constantly shaking the pan the whole time, after adding the sugar, is a must or it will burn.  For those that are still getting burnt sugar, you may be adding the popcorn and sugar before the oil is hot enough.  The three pop test should eliminate any guess work for when to add kernels. Just add 3 kernels to the oil before heating it. When the kernels turn into popcorn and pop right out of the pot the oil is ready for the sugar and other kernels.

This recipe is very hard to make without a whirly-pop style popcorn popper.  I tried it just in a dutch oven, but the shaking just isn't enough to stop the bottom kernels from over-browning.  I bought a Whirly-Pop, and what a difference.  The secret also is to salt the kettle corn at the end so that you have that balance of sweet and salty.

I have been making this for years and it has been a hit.  The key is to melt the sugar in the oil first.  You have to keep swirling it around until it is melted.  You then add the popcorn and keep shaking it until you hardly hear any more popping.  Immediatley put into large bowl and add popcorn salt, then  mix.  Comes out perfect every time!

Thanks to everyone's comments, my first try at making this was a HUGE success. I added 1/4 tsp. of salt to the sugar, and heated the oil on medium-high heat before adding the other ingredients.  I used my "detonator" popper (a version of the whirlypop) and didn't get a single burnt kernel.  The only thing I might do next time is reduce the amount of oil a bit.  Overall though, this is an awesome recipe!

I was excited to see this recipe.  In fact, in looking over the reviews, I bought a Stir Crazy popcorn popper just for this reason.  I also used butter flavored oil.  My first batch turned out a little brown, but the next time around I waited until the kernels were just about ready to pop before I poured the sugar over them.  Turned out fantastic!

This is awesome.  Some tips to really make it foolproof...I use my "stir crazy" popcorn machine. This really cuts down on the burn factor and it comes out perfect every time.  If you love making popcorn, the stir-crazy is the best.  We used butter-flavored popping oil instead of veg. oil and were sure to use the 3-kernal pop method prior to adding the rest of the kernels and sugar into the oil (this helps prevent having the sugar in there for too long and burning).  We also added a few shakes of salt in with the sugar, just for that sweet/salty mix.  A KEEPER!!!  I make a double batch each time!!

This is the ONLY way to eat popcorn.  I got hooked on this stuff at the V.P. Fair in St. Louis.  Now I have been looking for a recipe to make at home... This is it.
Can not wait to make this again.  Thank you for the post.  MY NEW FAVORITE SNACK.

Shake and Shake some more - Use a heavy pan - pop a few kernels first in 3 tablespoons oil NO TOO HOT - then add the rest of the oil and sugar, stir a few seconds - add the rest of the corn. cover and shake-shake-shake - this is the key to prevent burning. shake all the way to the serving bowl!  Add salt or butter buds or what ever AFTER you cook the corn!  Try half white and half brown sugar and add a half cup of crushed skinless peanuts!!!  To die for!

Great stuff and easy to make!  My 11-year old and his friends gobbled this up while watching movies.  Watch your heat with the popcorn.  You could get a mild "burnt" flavor if you have too much heat for too long.

This was so easy! I did buy a stir crazy popcorn popper just to try this recipe and am glad I did. I shared it with others and they all loved it. They couldn't believe how easy it was either.

I followed a prior review that used 2/3 cup popcorn and the same amount of oil and sugar.

I hate microwave popcorn but that was the only way I could ever get my kettle corn fix...until now! Per other reviewers, I used 3/4 of the sugar called for while the corn was popping and the rest when it was finished. Like others, I also added some salt.  My boyfriend loves me now!! A great complimentary snack (since they're both sweet) is fruit & fruit dip.  We snacked like kings tonight! Thanks Sue.

I used 3 tablespoons oil and it came out perfect!
This is DELICIOUS. Quick and easy. The kids will love it.  I followed the advice of others and popped one kernel first and then added the rest as well as the sugar, gave it a stir and started shaking. Yummy!

Thanks for the great recipe, the whole family loves it.  I make it our "Theater II Popcorn Popper" using 3 Tbsp of canola oil and it works great every time.  Be sure to use fresh popcorn.  Even better with a little salt!

This is just what I was looking for!  I made it last night and will make another batch tonight.  The only change is to add some salt while it's warm.  It's even better the next day!  If it doesn't come out on your first try, do it again!  It's worth it.

Oh, Sue I can’t thank you enough for this. I have been trying to get some of this Kettle Corn all week. I decided to check and see if there was a recipe here “didn’t think there would be” and it was here. I had no trouble make this corn what so ever and I used an electric stove, non-stick pan. I followed the recipe to the T and it was so EXCELLENT! I ate the entire batch before anyone even got any. Now I have to make more. I really thank you so much for taking the time and posting this for all to enjoy. God bless you and your family.

Heat the oil hot enough to pop the corn
 - add the sugar and stir.  Add the corn
and let pop. Remove immediately from the 
pan.

This is AMAZING!!!  This recipe is much better than any premixed kettle corn I've purchased in the store or on line.  I used the Whirley Pop and this was very easy.  I put oil in first then added corn, sugar, 1/4 t salt.  I did not have to preheat oil since I used the Whirley Pop.  Thanks Sue!

Came on allrecipes' website to find a recipe for caramel corn and came across this recipe. Made this twice. Easy and tasty. The first time, it was good but the second time I tried the method of putting the sugar in the oil before putting in the popcorn, it turned out that the sugar did not dissolve and sugar turned into rock-hard clumps. Had to restart, but it was good and am making it again! For me, the best way to start is to heat the oil, like the recipe stated, and the add the popcorn once the oil was hot, then right after adding the popcorn add the sugar. Also added in a 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the sugar. It does seem to want to stick, when you're moving the pot for a while, but, I would lift the lid just enough to get a spoon in there to stir it around so the sugar wouldn't burn. If it seems like the popcorn is popping pretty fast, you could even lower the heat somewhat so the sugar doesn't start to burn. I've seen where other reviewers said that they use a non-stick stock pot, but we don't have one of those. We use our stainless steel stock pot, and if you turn down the heat once it starts really popping, that helps it not to burn. That's what I did the second time and we didn't have any burnt pieces. What we did was to stir the popcorn once most of it was popped, while it was still in the pot, to help coat the pieces with the mixture. We will definitely keep this recipe! Thanks for posting, Sue202.

I cannot stop making (and eating) this popcorn!  I think the recipe calls for a touch too much white sugar, but for a caramel corn you will need nearly double the amount of brown sugar.  I also used the cooking method to make plain popcorn for my husband to doctor up with melted butter and garlic salt.  I'm so happy to have found this recipe - customizable, homemade popcorn makes movie night so much more fun.

Unless, you are fortunate enough to have the correct pot in your cubards and read the first few reviews this recipe will not work! I attempted 3 tries. The first time I used an enameled dutch oven pot with a lid  on medium and got mostly burnt popcorn with caramel sauce on the bottom. On the second try I used a thinner stainless steel type pot, and a lower temperature, and still got cooked caramel on the bottom and slightly burnt popcorn. Try 3 I noticed the first reviewer and the "3 second method," also specified by the submitter. So, I thought this would work. I decided to stick with the thinner pot, as on the second try, as to lift and shake the dutch oven pot with this method would get heavy after awhile. So, I put the oil and 3 kernals in as suggested by this method. However, by the time the oil was hot enough to come near popping the 3 kernals, with the lid off, it was already splattering quite badly although the heat was only on medium. Moving the pot back and forth also scratched my ceramic countertop stove so, I don't suggest making this if you also have a ceramic stove. I would like to know if a teflon type pot is best for this recipe? That is the only type I have not tried. But, anyway I would not attempt a 4th try either way.

I have made this about 8 times now. I thought that I would prefer the brown sugar version because I love carmel popcorn and actually don't really like regular popcorn at all, but after trying both ways I prefer with white sugar. The brown sugar tastes ok, but has a slight burnt flavor throughout. The white sugar version, I end up with only a few burnt tasting pieces depending on when I take it off the heat (no popping vs. a bit of popping still). I add salt at the end, as I put it in the bowl. Clean up is fairly easy and I am usually done the whole process only about 3-4 min after my hubby is finished making his microwave popcorn. When I made it for him- he loved it even though he thought it would not taste good.
If I only make it for myself I use 3 Tbsp of sugar and oil and 6Tbsp of kernels. It makes about the same as a bag of microwave popcorn. Not exactly 1 serving, but 1 delicious bowl anyway!! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good stuff! So much better than microwave popcorn, plus it's easy and kind of fun to make. I put a few kernels in and waited for them to pop, then stirred in the sugar and the popcorn. It took about three minutes. Added a little salt, let cool and enjoyed with our Saturday afternoon movie. I'll do this often! Thanks.

Okay I burned my 1st batch but not to be defeated by a recipe I read all the reviews and dove into my 2nd batch. I did use the 3 kernel test (put the lid on because flying hot kernels will burn your finger *my finger hurts* then followed the recipe as stated the bottom was burnt and made the entire batch taste off. Next batch I used the 3 kernel test with the LID ON, lol, added the sugar and salt on top of the other kernels after the 1st 3 popped, used the 3 seconds on then 3 seconds off the heat method and we had kettle corn perfection.. Ended up having to make 2 batches of the correct popcorn because the family loved it so much!! I enjoyed this recipe very much even tho I had a burnt batch and a burnt finger, lol.

FANTASTIC! I had been craving kettle corn for a long while now and thought that it would be too hard to make.  I settled for the microwave version and just wasn't happy. So I came to my favorite place, all recipes, and looked up kettle corn.  I read the recipe and thought "I can do *this*!" It was so easy and I ended up eating 2/3 of the batch myself!  Can't wait to make this through out the fall season (whose kidding... year round)!

Either I'm missing something or my process isn't right.... I dunno....   Tried three time... The sugar burned to the bottom of the pot twice, even though I kept the pot moving.    On my third try I used some corn syrup (Karo) with the sugar and got an un-burned popcorn, but it had very little Kettle corn flavor.  I'll keep to making the caramel sauce separate and tossing it with my fresh made corn....

Amazing! We won't be buying those expensive bags of microwaveable kettle corn anymore.  Everyone in my home enjoyed this recipe and it was quick, easy and inexpensive to make.  Who would've figured?  Just do not mistakenly add the sugar in with the oil like I did the first time;) That makes a bit of a mess and popcorn with a burnt taste. Oil, then popcorn, then sugar...pretty simple.

I make kettle corn professionally. Let me give you guys some tips if you want to make it at home. The sugar needs to be stirred CONSTANTLY. Just shaking the pot won't do it. (It burns REAL quick.)  Do this: crack the lid, insert a spoon and STIR the popcorn/oil/sugar while it's heating. Try to keep the cover on as much as possible. (to protect you).

Melted the sugar in the oil and added 1tsp salt before adding the kernels.  Made a 2nd batch as the 1st mysteriously disappeared.  Added about 2 more Tbsp. sugar.  PERFECT.  Took it to Girl Scouts for my daughter.  Gone in seconds!

We enjoyed it a great deal. Thanks for sharing and thanks for all the tips of the members 3 second shake and sit, 1/4 tsp salt, melt sugar in oil... absolutely lovely. Btw, I normally make this in a non-stick coated pan clean up is a breeze and he kernels are coated well. I used a stainless steel pot once, and had trouble coating the kernels properly but got a light golden color to the sugar which did not happen with the non-stick. :) I'll stay with non-stick, personal preference.

I recently got into the kettle corn biz because I love the stuff so much.  Here's some tips that I would suggest if you're doing at home.  There's a difference between using corn oil and vegetable/canola oil  Corn oil somehow gives the kettle corn a little more "corny" taste.  Before I bought a giant hot kettle to make the stuff, I tried doing it on a stove.  It wasn't the same as the festival stuff, just OK.  The reason is you need a VERY HOT heat source to BROWN the white sugar.  Just using brown sugar gives it a different taste.  What I would suggest if you DO try to attempt it at home is melt and brown the white sugar somehow before you put it in a popper.

This is excellent...the first two times I made it it was pretty good, but not quite right and I wasn't sure why.  Yesterday, I finally figured it out.  I did the three kernel method to tell when the oil is hot enough, then stirred in the sugar.  I let it go a little longer before I put the rest of the kernels in because I got distracted. The sugar and oil mixture turned a little brown, more like amber.  I was sure I had burned it.  But in the end, it was perfect.  The sugar had carmelized, but not burned.  It gave it a richer, toastier taste.  I also add just a little salt to give it a more authentic taste.  Terrific!

This is addicting, and oh so good and it only takes minutes to make.  A couple of tricks to get great results are: 1) after the oil is hot enough, dump the sugar in the oil and stir the sugar with a wooden spoon and mix well, stirring fast then add the remaining popcorn and cover pan with lid.  Also, make sure you use a pan with a thick bottom otherwise your popcorn will burn.  I used a medium heat setting on the stove.  And sprinkle a couple of teaspoons of salt on the popcorn after it is done cooking.  Store any leftovers in a zip bag or container with lid.

I can't even explain how much we absolutely love popcorn, but I REFUSE to buy, as I like to call it "microwave crapcorn".  When I was a little girl we visited King Richards Fair & I just loved the popcorn, or,  kettle corn that I ate that day but never had it again after that, until now.   Although the kids didn't care much for it, I will make it as a special treat for me, & maybe even share the memory with my brother..thanks, for the memories & the recipe Sue!

Works perfectly as written.  We used coconut oil and raw sugar, and it turned out beautifully.  I followed all the instructions, using the 3 kernel test for when oil was ready to have the sugar and remaining kernels added.  After we poured it out of the pot, we sprinkled it with coarse sea salt.  It's better than the kettle corn I shelled out $7 for at a local festival!

this is a great recipe!  I use my stir crazy popper.  I do the oil and 3 kernals.  When the three pop, I add the rest of the corn, a scant 1/4 C sugar, and salt to taste.  (I think i use about 1/2 t).  Watch very closely, as it scorches easily.  Enjoy!

I'm sure this is a great recipe for most, but our family loves that "crust" on the kettle corn we purchase from vendors. I actually used equal parts sugar and popping corn and it turned out just the way we like it.

Popcorn was delicious! Definetly put 3 kernels in as your oil heats, once they are popped add the popcorn and sprinkle the sugar. No need to premelt the sugar. It gives it too much time to carmelize and may result in a burnt end result. Also the 3 seconds on the burner 3 seconds of shaking works well(and keeps my ceramic top stove from getting scratched up). Hard to mess this recipe up. The people experiencing the burnt popcorn and too many unpopped kernels probably have the heat too high(or low) during popping.

amazing! A little bit of the sugar burned at the bottom of the pan so I had to pick out a few burnt pieces- but it was wonderful. I had no idea it was so easy to make such a special treat.   I used the reviews to assist in making this.  I'm glad! It's a winner. It was sticky the next day- so make sure to eat it all up on day one! Best served hot!

You only need to JUST cover the bottom of the pan with oil, then cover the bottom of the pan with a layer of kernels. I made one batch with white sugar and one with brown sugar. The brown sugar batch was WAY better...and this is way better for you than store bought bags....thanks!

This was really good - light and slightly sweet.  I liked it much better than kettle corn you'd get at a fair, which tends to be more heavily sugared.  We've made it twice now, and it does work much better in a wide bottom pan.  I used my dutch oven.  We tried the shake 3 seconds, hold 3 seconds method, which worked great.  Only a few pieces at the very bottom stuck to the pan, but I was slightly distracted too.  This is a keeper and will definitely make it again, especially for parties and such.

I use a heavy bottom skillet and tight fitting lid. I tend to use slightly more than 1/4 oil - I found it helps the popcorn from burning if there's slightly more oil than sugar. I also add all my kernels while the oil is heating up. Not only does the oil need to be ready, but the kernels need to get hot enough before they will pop. Right before they look like they're going to start popping I will add the sugar (I also add about a tsp/tbsp of salt to the sugar mixture) so it has a minute to dissolve. 

This can be fussy to make, but its really good when it comes together. Don't give up!!

This is a good snack. I added 3 kernels to the oil while it heated, and once they all popped I added the sugar and the rest of the kernels. Make sure the pot lid stays on while shaking the pot or you could burn yourself with the hot oil

Yum! I've been making this for a long time, and it's always great! I actually use only about 1-2 Tbsp oil and slightly more sugar, plus about 1/4 tsp. salt and it's never done me wrong!

Oh, we love this!  It took a bit of practice to get it right, but I may never buy kettle corn at the fair again.  Following others' suggestions, I pour my corn kernels in after the 3 test kernels pop.  I pour the sugar on top and then stir.  After that the shaking is really important.

For anyone who is having trouble with burning--make sure you are using "regular" sized popcorn kernels (like an Orville Redenbacher).  The first two times I tried this I used a small kernel variety, and the bottom layer of popcorn was burnt by the time the popping had slowed to more than two seconds between pops.  Also, I made sure not to turn my heat up higher than 5, did the three kernel test, and didn't get any burning.

I made it with white sugar following directions exactly, and it was wonderful!  Yum!  Thought I'd get smart and just tried a batch using only 3 Tbsp of oil instead of 1/4 cup, and a little more than 1/4 cup white sugar - what a mess!  Moral of the story is don't mess with success!  Thanks for the recipe!  I won't be changing a thing!

Wow tasty! Only took 3 min. Of shaking to pop. Left pot on the stove for 2 more min. And it caramelized (fancy for burned). Listen to the popping stop and rmove immediately!

I don't know what I have done wrong.  I made it first time following directions...it was nasty. Second time I followed Sue's post and melted sugar then added popcorn...same results. My popcorn was an icky tan color with no flavor.

I'm so excited, it's possible I'm still on a sugar high from the 2 batches of kettle corn I just ate! I made some for movie night for my family, and we loved it so much I made three batches for a pre-fourth of July party. Everyone LOVED it and asked for the recipe. I felt guilty eating it, but was reassured with the fiber content in the corn itself.   I liked how crispy and crunchy it was. And the pieces were easy to break apart when a few did stick. I also liked how every piece was covered with the sugar mixture. I did add the 1/4 teaspoon salt in with the sugar during cooking. I used a large cast iron pot. I have an electric stove and shook and swirled the entire time, removing pot from heat occasionally. I didn't burn any and it was my first time ever making popcorn. It was way way better than any overpriced bag at a farmer's market. I too splurged on the more expensive Orville Red. popcorn. Thanks Sue, I will bring this tasty snack to ALL my summer pool parties.***I just made this again, except this time with brown sugar, hoping for caramel corn. I was disappointed, the sugar just didn't cook the same, but the kids still ate it. Still, I won't make it that way again.

A hundred times better than microwave popcorn.   Using others' suggestions, I added the sugar once the oil was hot and stirred to dissolve as much as possible before adding the kernels.  The result was near perfection on the first try.  Thanks to everyone!!  Make a large batch, it will go quickly!

You have the right idea but..... you are forgeting the "salty" part of what makes kettle corn so great. Kettle corn is supposed to be sweet and salty, thats it's trademark. try adding one tspn of salt, coarse salt if you have it, to the mix, and you acheive that old time wonderful taste we all love from kettle corn!

Keep your lid on only long enough that the corn does not pop out of the pot, then keep popping without lid. By doing this moisture will be released and the popcorn will be crisp not moist and chewy tough.

Good Recipe, glad I doubled. I mixed in a pinch of salt in with the sugar before I put it in the pan. I then waited a couple seconds before putting in the corn kernals. Just remember if you do this on the stove keep sliding the pan across the burner to keep from having burnt popcorn. I saw some reviews saying 3 seconds on and 3 seconds off the burner, never tried that method, I continuously shake the pan(side to side and back and forth, always having contact with the burner) to avoid burning.

I am rating this recipe a five- on technique and the overall result. The only thing I change to get that true kettle corn sweet/salty flavor, is to add salt. I look forward to going to the fair because I love kettle corn so much! This is just like it! I am pleasantly surprised! To one batch, I added regular salt, and to the other, I added season salt. My family likes both. I will experiment with using half oil and half Smart Balance, too. I KNOW I will be making this often! Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the highly rated techniques (3 kernel test...) and have made this five times in the last several weeks.

Using a high sided stainless pan, the recipe easily doubled with success.  The test I used to check (before starting the recipe) was to dump the measured popcorn in the pan, if it makes a flat layer, the amount of popcorn will work.

I love kettle korn and I love this recipe.  While it isn't the same as getting it at the fair, it is darn close and a great substitute when it isn't fair time. I only use 2 TBS of oil which works fine.  I also test with one kernel before adding the rest of the kernels and sugar.  You do have to make sure that you shake the pan a lot otherwise it will burn.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

This was so delicious and so easy - I'm impressed!!  It only took a few minutes to make and was eaten up even quicker.  I heated the oil, did the 3 kernel test, added the rest of the corn and then added the sugar.  I flavored with a little salt when it was done popping.  I like the taste of canola oil, but peanut oil cooks the sugar better (be careful of peanut allergies). Thanks for the recipe, Sue!

Excellent recipe.  We've been making this for a long time.  When the kids have friends over, it's such an easy snack to make that goes a long way AND it's inexpensive!  ONE BIG TIP... Popcorn Salt.  Just sprinkle it over the popcorn after it has popped.  The popcorn salt is ground up very fine into almost a powder.  Regular table salt will do but the popcorn salt is exceptional!  It can be found at your local grocery store.

A very easy recipe to make. I would definetely reccommend using a whirly pop or something similar to make this in. And it defintely needs some salt. A new family fave!

A good old fashioned recipe. My Grandfather has been making this for many years - always with BROWN sugar (the flavor is so much better!)Here's a trick to make it a little easier: bring the "sauce" ingredients to a simmer in a small pan on the stove top; meanwhile pop a bag or two of popcorn in the microwave. Pour the popped corn into a large bag. While the popcorn is still hot, drizzle the "glaze" over the popcorn in the bag, fold the bag down a few times and then SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE! Make sure you shake it really well to coat all of the kernels. My grandpa would let us all take turns shaking the bag. Simply pour it into a bowl and toss the bag - no pan to clean!

This recipe was a hit when I brought it to a Halloween party.  I made 5 batches and filled up a black cauldron and put a sign on the front that said "Kettle Corn".  Everyone at the party was so excited to have homemade kettle corn! 

I followed the directions of others with the 3 kernel rule then added the sugar and then the remaining kernels.  I also added red and yellow (to make orange) food coloring. I added the food coloring when I added the sugar.  I had several people ask me for the recipe!

This is such an easy, foolproof kettle-corn recipe.  I add slightly more sugar, and it's even better!  It has become a staple whenever we rent a movie in our house.

I always thought the kettle corn at faires tasted kind of burnt - but not this recipe! It couldn't be easier to make.  I sprinkled it with salt at the end because I like sweet-salty combinations.

Yummy nummy! Tastes delicious! A word to the wise...keep stirring the sugar until your arm feels like it will break off. Otherwise you won't get a nice even coating. I had easily made 20 batches of this stuff since getting the recipes. Never again will I pay for the prepackaged stuff! Thanks Sue!

OH NO! I'm almost upset i found this recipe! I was secretly hoping it would be terrible because now i am hooked and will be wanting it about every night...it is just as good as kettle corn you would find at a festival. It's very easy to make, i just suggest that you continue to shake the pan while cooking, even taking it off the burner and hold with pot holders to get a good shake in once in a while. Add salt when it is still warm. Fabulous recipe!!

This is a great recipe! I add the oil & 2 kernels of corn until it's hot enough that they pop, then add the rest of the kernels & sugar (I add a dash of salt too, to bring out the sweetness.) This should help with burnt sugar concerns.

I noticed one other reviewer said this didn't work. It worked great for us, but I think there must be 2 keys: use MEDIUM heat as the recipe states (most people tend to make popcorn on the highest heat)and really keep it moving in the bottom of the pan. We have one of those poppers that has a crank and it works great with this, but probably would be fine with a regular pot if you keep shaking. Really yummy!!

when making this I found that adding the sugar at the same time as the popcorn made caramel corn not kettle corn. I suggest adding the sugar as soon as the popcorn starts popping as well as 1/2tsp of salt to get that true sweet and salty taste.

I made it last night and it's delicious.  I made it with oil and butter to equal 1/4 cup and 1/2 c dark brown sugar, packed.

My husband has always loved Cracker Jacks.  He said this is better.  I just sent the recipe off to a bachelor friend who loves to cook and suggested Spanish peanuts (the redskins), be mixed in, too.

I could have taken a picture, but forgot because it was just SO good.

I realized that I first saved this recipe and have been making it for over three years now, and this is my go to base recipe for popcorn. My adjustments over the years include using the three kernel test to make sure the oil is ready and heated properly.  I use peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, just prefer the taste, the smoke point may be slightly higher as well. As a side note, coconut oil is supposed to be very good cooking popcorn in, but the smoke point is much lower, I have never tried it yet. I also add 1/4 tsp of Flavacol to the sugar before adding it to the pot. Just mix it right into the1/4 cup of sugar. (It's the addicting salt additive that movie theatres use in their popcorn, I'm sure it's terrible for you but it's soooo good.) It takes this popcorn recipe over the top and this popcorn gets devoured in my house, it's so delicious! Another note: This may be due to the fact that I have a gas stove and a stainless steel popcorn popper with a rotating handle, but  I've learned over the years for the best results I have to move fast and to cook it on a med-high to high heat. Once the oil is heated and all of the ingredients are added, rotate constantly and stop when popping slows to every 2 -3 seconds, sometimes sooner, (a few unpopped kernels are better than an entire batch of burnt popcorn) Have a container ready to pour popcorn into immediately to avoid burning, because the sugar will burn quickly.

I really love this recipe now that I got it right. The first time I made it I used half white sugar and half raw sugar thinking that it would be a nice balance between caramel and sweet. It tasted alright but it was tricky to make because the raw sugar does not dissolve nicely like the white sugar. Not only that but I got a bit lazy with the 3 second shake rule and I almost burnt it... a few times. Let me tell you, the other reviewers are not kidding it burns very easily. The next time and ever since I have used just white sugar and have been absolutely dedicated to the 3 second rule and it has been wonderful every time! I would definitely recommend this recipe, but just make sure you stick to the 3 second shake rule and shake it like the dickens!

My favorite way of eating this fantastic popcorn is to drizzle a little EVBO (extra-virgin bacon oil; aka bacon grease!) over it instead of butter after it's done.  This is far too good for any king who ever lived!  Bacon grease is far better than butter for certain things and this is one of them.  One of these days I am going to pop the corn in EVBO instead of vegetable oil and see what happens.  My guess is that the corn might burn.  But I am going to try it sometime anyway.  No guts, no glory!

My family is addicted to this! We use our crank style stovetop popper, and it works amazing! Just as good or better than you can get at carnivals and street fairs, and it's CHEAP! Only thing we changed was sprinkling and tossing with a little salt at the end.

Originally from the Dutch Amish are of Pennsylvania, this isn't quite as good as what I've bought from the fair...with that being said...this is an awesome recipe!!  I've made this several times and have NEVER had it fail.  I use Orville Reddenbacher, canola oil and a Whirly Pop popcorn maker on just a tick below medium heat on an electric flat-top stove.  I use the 3 kernal test, add the rest of the corn, turn handle to coat the kernals, and then add the sugar.  Might add a bit of salt next time and see what that does.  All in all....huge success with everyone I serve it to.  Thanks Sue.

This was terrific. I would suggest listening to everyone's suggestion about using three kernels and waiting for them to pop in the oil to know that you have reached optimal cooking temperature. As is, the recipe is terrific--though I added a bit of salt. Out of eight times, I only successfully made the popcorn twice. I only use a standard cooking pot. Each time the popcorn failed, a big mess was made with smoke everywhere and sticky, black, and rank popcorn. However, my suggestion is to use a wooden spoon directly after emptying the popcorn and sugar into the pot and keep stirring until it starts to pop. After that, shake the pot and hold the lid up a bit so that the air can enter. Popcorn won't pop without air due to the pressure within. But, with all the effort, it's very much worth it; it is absolutely delicious. I much prefer kettle corn to butter popcorn; it's just so nostalgic.

My husband adores kettle popcorn so being able to make it for him at anytime is fun. I also am trying to find the right balance between salt and sugar to get that farmers market fresh taste.

Perfectly popped kettle corn without going to the fair :)  You must SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE the pan back and forth to prevent burning.... tastes great!

I'm eating this right now...it's still warm! And it is oh-so-good! I've been in a homemade popcorn phase of late and wanted something different. This was the ticket! So easy and so good...just sprinkled a bit of sea salt on at the end for that true kettlecorn taste! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made the recipe as is and it was good, just as easy as I thought. Then I made a second with some salt and I liked it better. The sweet and salty combination is my favorite. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this and took it to a party once and the host ate nearly the entire bowl!  She loved it so much that for Christmas I made her enough to fill a garbage bag with.  Easy and delicious!  Just make sure your heat isn't too high or your syrup will quickly burn!

Used homegrown popcorn, electric stove, 3/3 shake method, took off burner when popping slowed, removed lid, waited a bit until it quit popping, shook on a few shakes of salt, and poured into a couple bowls.  Amazing, it was sooo very simple.  No mess. No burnt sugar or popcorn. Easy cleanup.  Would be fun to add food coloring to the sugar for special occassions or events.

I had never made homemade popcorn before, I grew up on air popped or microwave bags. This was so simple and easy and really yummy I ate the whole lot of it! 1/2 cup of kernels makes about 12cups of popped corn so you need a big pot! I will be trying the brown sugar next time and I did throw in a 1/4 teaspoon of salt with the sugar to get that sweet & salty taste. I wonder if you could add a bit of butter to the oil for flavor as well?

I made with coconut oil...a presumably healthier alternative.  It was great!  I went light on the sugar (a mix of brown and white) and then followed the other directions...no problem in my stainless pan with a little intelligent shaking as it cooked (including shaking after it is off the heat but still in the pan).

I used the 3 second rule and burned the sugar the first time. The second time the sugar turned brown and the inside of the kernels were black. If the kernels weren't burnt it would have tasted similar to caramel corn. I'll stick to the farmer's market popcorn.

Not sweet enough.  But it was easy to make.  I kept shaking and it did not burn.  I have never make popcorn on the stove before and that was easy. But this tasted like regular pop cor, very little flavor.

Ahhhhhmazing! SO SO GOOD! My kids said its better than the kind we get at the fair! I added about 2 tsp of salt to the sugar....I will definately be making this again...it definately is more work shaking a heavy stock pot around but so worth it....I have memories of my grandma making regular popcorn for us like this, and the taste can't be beat! On the upside, you burn all the calories you eat shaking your hips like that! LOL!

I used a stir crazy popcorn machine,  let the oil heat 3 minutes & then added the popcorn and poured the sugar on top. the stir crazy stirred the corn perfectly, and I can't believe how easy it was to make this great flavor.  Clean up was not bad either.  Popped perfect amount.  Thanks!!

This recipe is PERFECT for achieving the results you get from the fairs.  Our neck-o-the-woods is famous for their craft fairs, and while I could care less about the crafts and go out of my way to avoid the crowds, I would eventually cave to the call of fresh-popped kettle korn.  I'd pull in, find the nearest kettle korn stand, get my goods and dash back to the car.  Now, I can avoid all the commotion AND save a ton of $$ with this recipe!  I've searched hi-and-low for YEARS to find a kettle korn recipe, and this is it!  Made it last night for movies, and my guests ate it ALL up!  My son's friends LOVE this treat when they come over.  Makes a GREAT snack for road trips.   TIPS: 1.  The three-kernel test is ingenious, and really ensures quality timing.  The end result is crunchy and all this is good about kettle korn.   2.  Make sure to dump the corn out of your cooking vessel when it's through popping; otherwise the sugar on the kernels touching the sides have a tendency to start scorching.   3.  Also, I cook this on medium-high to HIGH heat.  I've found the hotter you can cook it, the better the results.  The lower heat means the sugar tends to stay in the pot too long, and you wind up with caramel corn instead.   4.  Don't dump warm korn into a plastic bag--paper is best; the steam may prevent the sugar from setting as it cools and you'll miss out on that famous, crunchy glaze on your kernels.   5.  Shake, shake, shake once the kernels start popping.

Yum!  1/4 cup didn't pop much corn, but I was afraid to pop more in one batch in case it burned easily.  I popped two batches of 1/4 cup each and followed the recipe and directions exactly.
UPDATE:  I tried using 1/4 cup raw sugar (sometimes called turbinado) and it was wonderful too.  More carmely.

Tastes fine, but not quite like any kettle corn I've tried...not really sweet enough.  Will probably try again with butter instead of oil and more sugar.

Just like the kettle corn at the fair! The first couple of trys were not the best, I tried to stir the sugar into the hot oil to dissolve it but that didn't work. The first time I had the heat too high or something because it burned. I was determined though as I'd read enough reviews to know I would get it right. Glad I did. This is a keeper for us!

This is an excellent tasting popcorn.  My husband, who is the popcorn making king in our family, is now making it every night for a snack.  We love it!  It also works in well with our Weight Watcher's program.  Something sweet, something high in fiber and low in points.  Only five points for the whole recipe.

This turned out so well! Came out just like the kettle corn from the farmer's market. I used the "3 kernel method." Heat the oil and add 3 kernels into the pot. When the all of the kernels pop the oil is ready. Add the sugar and mix to let it melt. Then add the rest of the kernels. Mix/shake so it won't burn while cooking (it was recommended from other reviews to shake 3 seconds and let stand for 3 seconds). And finally, enjoy!

Great recipe, turned out perfect on the first try. I used brown sugar instead of white for a slight caramel flavor.

I followed this recipe as is. The brown sugar burnt on bottom of the pan. I even shook it constantly- the kids hated the taste of even the 'good' popped kernels. i have made popcornn before in the same pan and came out perfect. something is wrong with the sugar part in this recipe.

Yum!  This recipe is so easy and quick and turned out just like the kettle corn i can only get once a year at the fair.  I did try 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and did not like the results.  The next batch I stuck to the recipe and used all white sugar and IT ROCKED!

I LOVE this kettle corn! My kids take it to school parties and sleepovers all the time - I add food coloring to the sugar before I dump it in. It makes very pretty colored popcorn!
I don't have the patience to make it in a pot. I use my popcorn popper (the kind you put oil in, not a hot air popper). I put the oil and kernels in. When it starts to sizzle, I add the sugar. When the popping slows, I dump it onto a cookie sheet and sprinkle it with salt -I use kosher cause I like the larger grain.

Ok, I am only giving this 1 star, but I am hoping it was something I did!! We had to throw this out-my was all stuck together and browned.  Almost like the sugar tried to caramalize.  Maybe too hot, but sugar just didn't want to melt-help-what did I do wrong?  may try again.

I own a kettle corn business and I use 100% corn oil and C&H granulated sugar with the seeds.  The oil should be hot then add the seeds and sugar.  You have to stir constantly or the sugar will burn. I recommend that you tilt the lid so that you can get a long spoon in there to constantly stir it. Or dome it with aluminum foil so that you can stir it.  Once you hear the seeds popping madly, remove from heat and continue to stir.  Ligtly salt it or kick it up a notch with some garlic salt.

I love this recipe, it is so good and easy.  I made this and could not stop eating it hot or cold.  I made mine with brown sugar and salt.  Will be making this again, maybe on movie night.

oh wow... great!! I used extra virgin olive oil and salted it at the bottom of the pot, then placed in the kernels. When they began to pop, I THEN added the sugar, and shook it like crazy... oh my, it was bangin'! I used to wait til there was a street fair in town to get kettle corn... now I just walk in to the kitchen!! Thanks!

Amazing and amazingly easy! I wanted to give this recipe a 4 instead of a 5 because it left out a key ingredient to kettle corn - salt - but it just tastes too good and is too easy to make to give a 4!!! The 3 kernel test, adding the sugar, then the kernels is perfect. Finally, when you remove the pot from the stove, sprinkle generously with salt - true kettle corn from a fair is always salty but sweet. Thank you for this awesome, easy recipe. We will definitely be making this on a regular basis!

This was awesome! I made three batches over the weekend. Here is my technique (thanks to all the previous reviewers for the tips):
Put oil and 3 popcorn kernels in the pan. Heat the oil - when all three kernels pop, you are ready to go.
Add the kernels and the sugar at the same time. Leave the pan on the stove for three seconds, then pick the pan up and shake it for three seconds. Repeat until corn is popped.
Pour the popped corn into a big bowl and immediately sprinkle 1 tsp of table salt over it and gently toss. (Be careful though - the syrupy coating on the corn is hot!) The salt is absolutely necessary to get the authentic sweet-and-salty kettle corn taste! Really, really good stuff. I was surprised that this tasted just like the stuff you buy at fairs, etc, and it is MUCH cheaper.

Use a non-stick pan. If you want to make multiple batches, all you have to do is wrap a paper towel around a spoon and wipe out the excess oil and leftover sugar, and make sure the lid is tight-fitting and clean. I like my kettle corn extra crunchy and sugary, so I use a 2:2:1 ratio of unpopped kernels, sugar, and oil respectively. I also made Christmas-themed batches of this to give out to friends and coworkers. You can prepare bowls/batches of this ahead of time and do three in a row if you want! In a separate bowl, simply mix 3-5 drops of food coloring in with the sugar and make sure it's well-blended. If possible, avoid using water-based food dyes. If you use more than 5 drops, the popcorn kernels will start to pop less and your kettle corn will burn. Keep a nicely-dampened paper towel handy to wipe any oil spillage off the side of the pot. A cheery mix of red, green, and gold kettle corn was a big hit with everyone; and I am consistently told that my extra sugar version tastes better than the stuff at the fair. Wonderful recipe!

I add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the popcorn before it pops.  That way it coats the kernel and tastes very yummy.

Truly the best and easiest Kettle Corn!!  My husband always gets the huge bags of kettle corn at fairs and he says this is his favorite!  I did change things up a bit, I used all organic ingredients and substituted coconut oil and raw sugar.  There is a danger of burning the sugar, to prevent this add the oil to the pan and 3 corn kernals, only after those kernals have popped add the remaining kernals and sugar.  Stir constantly with a wooden or metal spoon making sure no sugar sits on the bottom.  When it's done, sprinkle on the salt (I increased the amount of salt a little) and prepare to have to make some more!  P.S.  This cools and stores fabulously!

Made this recipe just this evening following PABLOJR's wonderful directions. This recipe is faultless and absolutely yummy! It was even better than the kettle corn at the fair because it was so fresh. Make a big batch tonight!

This is awesome!  I only give it a 4 instead of 5 bc it doesn't call for salt, and I can't imagine it without salt!  I used grated sea salt and sprinkled it over right when it came out... maybe a teaspoon full.  It's the perfect balance of sweet and salty.  Only bad thing is that I'll have to make this every day.

Wonderful! I used a non-stick medium saucepan with a glass lid on an electric stove. I pop plain corn all the time and don't bother to measure anything. I coat the bottom of the pan with oil and eyeball the kernels needed. Then get your oversized bowl ready. For this recipe I measured out the sugar into the lid and held the lid there by the pan while I waited for my oil to heat up. That way I could use the lid as a shield if oil spat out at me. Then I shook the sugar from the lid onto the kernels and put the lid on. For popcorn in general, hold the lid down tight and shake the pan good and hard so the kernels bounce against the inside walls. It's not how fast you shake it but how hard you shake it and make them bounce around. I shake a few seconds, let it sit a few seconds, etc. When the popping slowed down I immediately dumped it into the waiting bowl and added salt. Don't wait til it stops popping completely. It's better to have a few unpopped kernels than to burn the whole batch. You'll catch on with time. Dump it out of the pan immediately too. Be sure to use fresh popcorn (check the expiration date). Beet sugar may not do as well as cane sugar, so check the type you are using. Brown sugar is nothing but molasses and regular white sugar mixed together. If you are having alot of trouble, try popping plain popcorn and see if that comes out right. If so, just keep practicing with the kettle corn recipe in small batches until you get it right. It's very tasty and addictive!

Great recipe! I burned a tiny bit of the popcorn on the bottom of the pot, but everything else came out perfect.  Be sure to remove the popcorn IMMEDIATELY from the pot after it slows in popping because it burns quickly if kept in the pot for longer than a second or two.  I added salt afterwards and it tasted just like something I'd get at the fair.

This recipe is fantastic!! I used to buy this at the local farmers market, which could get quite pricey. Now I just make my own at home with my old fashioned hand crank popcorn maker. Saves having to shake the pot and this way not one kernal burns, I use 3 tbls of oil and 3 tbls of butter and it is perfect every time!  Thanks for sharing this simple but great recipe!

Very good,  but trying to pop the corn in a frying pan is really tricky.  Constant stirring is key to keep the popcorn from burning, but without a lid, the kernels fly everywhere, and you will burn youself with the hot oil

I was ecstatic when I found this recipe because I love kettle corn and hate the microwave version of it.  It took me two attempts to get this to work but I was determined to have kettle corn.  The final flavor was fabulous but I am only giving this 4 stars because of the "hassle" factor.  First attempt: I used a stainless steel pan and dumped all the ingredients in.  Even though I shook incessantly over medium heat, all I got was a nasty burned mess.  Second attempt:  I used a non-stick wok, added 1/4 cup oil and three kernals and left it over medium heat until the kernals popped.  Then I added the sugar, stirred until it appeared well mixed, added the kernals and shook until all the corn popped.  Poured it into a bowl, added some salt and I am eating it now as I type this review.  My best advice is to be patient and keep trying because it's worth it!

I've been dying to find a good recipe that will give me the taste of good kettle corn at home.  This is fabulous!  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.  I followed previous recommendations to pop the 3 pieces of corn first to avoid burning.  Added a tiny bit of salt at the end and PERFECT!

This was very good.  I did use the butter flavored popcorn oil instead of vegetable oil.  It gives the flavor that little extra something.

MMMMMMMMM....I tried Kettle Corn for the first time at a festival a couple of weeks ago--had never even heard of it. I am not usually a big fan of sweet/salty combos, but this changed my mind. Allrecipes to the rescue, I found this recipe for kettle corn. Made it, loved it. Not just like the fair kettle corn, but I think you need an actual kettle for that. This is the closest you'll get! Thanks for the recipe!

Two words can rate this recipe, excellent and easy. I prepared this recipe in 3 min. using my WhirlyPop® popcorn popper. I added the ingredients, turned the handle on the popper and in 3 min,I had perfectly popped kettle corn.

I am so happy I found this recipe!  I have made it 3 times since I found it this week.  It is a big hit at our house!  I add a little salt while it is still warm,  and it tastes just like the kettle corn found at fairs.  I think it tastes even better the next day.

I almost didn't try this because of all the reviews but went ahead and did and it worked fine.  It did not burn. I used a regular stainless steal pan and popped it like I would any other popcorn.  I almost wonder if the people that had so much trouble are used to microwave popcorn and not using a stove for it because this popped no differently than every batch of popcorn I've ever made.  Quite good if you like kettle corn.

We make this over every campfire we have, which is basically every weekend. My kids LOVE this and it is a HUGE hit every time. Add a tiny bit of salt at the beginning and shake it over a camp fire in a chestnut roaster or long handled popcorn pan. YUM MEEEE!

I'm sold.  This hits the spot.  We actually use our Stir Crazy Popcorn Popper and shake it as we go.  We also heat the oil and sugar in the microwave for about a minute to get the sugar a bit de-crystallized.  We also add salt!  It's addictive!!

I was a little afraid to try this recipe after reading some of the bad reviews but was desperate for kettle corn.  It was wonderful!!  I added the sugar when the oil was hot just before the corn started to pop and shook like crazy.  I didn't have any problems with scorching.  We will be making this again and again!  Thanks Sue :)

I made this recipe 3 times in one day and it turned out great each time.  I followed everyone's advice and shook the pan like crazy. Sparks were flying everywhere and I even caught one of my hot mits on fire, which was terribly exciting do to the fact that I was wearing it!   This is the most dangerously, delicious recipe ever and worth all the wounds!

I tried this reicpe twice without success using a regular pan. The result was a hardend, burned lump on the bottom of my pot. Then I decided to try a non-stick pot and it worked wonderfully. I definately would try using a non-stick pan before you give up! I took the advice to test the oil with a single kernel of corn and that works great.

It and it came out burnt. The thing is i made this before in culinary school and it turned out great but when I tried it at home it tasted all burnt. I think I know the reason we have an electric stove. It is very flat and you can't control any flame. I used a gas stove at school so when we shook the pot it was able to make the sugar go with the kernels. So to sum it up go with the gas stove to make kettle corn. This is my opinion on things so have fun!

I am NEVER going to waste my money on expensive fair kettle corn again!  This was so easy to make and it tastes so good.   
I added 1 tsp. Brown sugar and 1/4 tsp salt to the white sugar and this tastes just like the fairs kettle corn.  Now I'm confused why they charge so much for kettle corn.  Hahaha.  
Delicious.

Amazing, perfect kettle corn.  The tip to shake 3 seconds, heat 3 seconds was really key.  My family LOVES when I make this as a treat.  Once, I put the sugar in with the oil by accident.  I was sure I'd ruined it, but I kept going.  The sugar turned brown and caramelized.  Delicious caramel corn!  I was pretty happy with my mistake.

I made this recipe this afternoon. I did substitute 2 tablespoons of clarified butter for oil for a buttery flavour. I also added 1/2 teaspoons sea salt with the butter, oil, sugar mixture. The clarified butter helps to prevent burning because the milk solids are removed. For people that are having trouble with burning a heavy bottomed pot is essential and keep the pot moving. This is as easy as making regular popcorn. I will be making again for sure.

i was pleased to find this recipe, as I remember making this years ago when I was a girl for my family and I to enjoy while watching movies at home.  Here are my tweaks:  Use the very best popcorn kernels (Ive tried them, all and now swear by PopSecret brand); Try using superfine sugar (not confectioners powdered sugar!) to cut the time it takes for the sugar to melt, reducing the chances of it burning;  If using salt, mix it right in with the sugar instead of sprinkling it on top of the popped corn afterward; And if you want colored popcorn, measure out your sugar into a small cup first, then add 3 or 4 drops of food coloring (one color per batch) to the sugar and stir well so that the sugar granules are now lightly colored, then add to your batch at the correct time.
A couple of more CRUCIAL tips: Keep things moving, and keep the heat on medium-low!  After making MANY batches of this stuff, I can attest that most of the accidents and burnt batches reported here had little to do with the recipe and more to do with user error.  The whole shebang takes a mere 5mins, so devote your full attention to your pot and you'll be rewarded with a really wonderful treat!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and the result was a delicious, albeit it addicting, batch of kettle corn.  The perfect snack to take to my daughter's softball game tonight.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, SUE202!  No more expensive kettle corn for me now that I know I can make it just as good, if not better, at home!!

Are you kidding me?  I tried this recipe multiple times after reading all the helpful comments and making sure the oil was ready with the three kernel test.  All I got was charred popcorn and a huge mess each time I tried.

I have to say when I saw this recipe I was pretty excited about using it. BOY! was I wrong. I followed the directions to the letter. LOL! adding the ingredients all at once actually  cools to pan down a little to where sugar burns even when you stir it constantly. Also adding sugar to the pan with the popcorn slows the popping process. Read most of the reviews, I'm glad for those people who had success with it.

All the bad reviews here are from those who did not do it right.  You must be fast, you must keep it shaking!!!!Dont't let the sugar burn!!!  It turns brown and gooey and gross if your method is not just right.  My husband is awesome at it.  He gets it right every time.  I have, on the other hand, messed it up because of my technique.  Same recipe,but when I am not fast enough it won't work!!  When you do it right it is an amazing yummy treat.  Each kernel is coated with clear, shiny sugar.  Add a little salt and you are in heaven!!!!

Ok, So I feared making this as I was afraid I would have a sticky mess to clean up afterwards.... ok who are we kidding... I was afraid to make it because I was afraid I'd get yelled at by my wife for the hot sticky mess I'd have left for her to clean. 
But, I made it anyways... I followed the suggestion of leaving 3 kernels in so you know when it's ready then add the sugar and popcorn and doing the whole, "sit for 3 seconds then shake for 3 seconds" method. 
The popcorn came out great and was a huge success. It was nicely coated on the outside but still crunchy and fluffy inside.
I made this for a laidback movie night at our home and now it has become a requirement for EVERY movie night! It made the perfect amount for us and is a great recipe. 
We will try a mix of brown and white sugar to see if we like the caramel flavor the brown sugar brings. 
We would recommend this to anyone who loves popcorn but is feeling a little more adventurous than the same ol' salt and butter routine. 

Oh... and clean up for me (wife won the coin toss) was a breeze!

Add just a touch of salt, maybe a 1/4 t along with the sugar. Perfection! I also followed the tip about using the 3 kernals pop and stiring the sugar and corn mixture for a few second before putting the lid on.

I love this recipe! I use it all the time. In fact, I just did, and as usual, it turned out perfectly. The key is to make sure that sugar doesn't burn! I usually finish mine off with a shake of cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little salt. It's great!

So delicious! You don't need to have many ingredients to make this so it's a great last minute treat. I halved the recipe, no problem. But when I was shaking- dropped the pot and lost another half of the popcorn... :(

Very good! And easy. I burnt my first batch, but didn't give up. I use my large all-clad pot on my large burner set at 6/10. I dump the kernels and sugar (with a touch of kosher salt) all at once, throw the lid on, grab both handles with two ends of a kitchen towel (so the lid doesn't clang around and so I don't burn myself) and shake, shake, shake! I don't lift the pot or pause, but I do shut off the burner when I hear the explosion of popping and finish off with the residual heat. Then immediately pour the popcorn into a large bowl or cake pan. If you burn the first time- don't give up!

I did the 3 kernel test first as the oil was heating and I also mixed my brown and white sugar together before I poured it over the kernels delicious. Also instead of vegetable oil I used sesame oil..

Delicious! Made in my big cast iron dutch oven using this method:

Placed oil (I used organic coconut oil) in dutch oven over medium high. Put 3 kernels in oil. When they popped, I poured in the remaining kernels and sprinkled sugar over them. Stir a little bit with a wooden spoon. Cover and cook, shaking the pan constantly, until popping slows to just a pop every 6 seconds or so. Remove lid, sprinkle with kosher or sea salt and dish up. Wonderful flavor!

I've tried this recipe several times over the years, different pots, different stoves, different techniques, hoping for yummy kettle corn.  Never happened.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe because excellent results aren't easily replicated.

It wasn't sweet and was very oily. Perhaps using less oil or more popcorn and more sugar?

Very disappointing since I'm looking for alternatives to sweets.

This was so good!  Out microwave died this week and with the holidays coming it will not be replaced any time soon.  I dug out my Pro Popper (stove top popper) and made this.  I used about 2 tbs canola oil and added 1/3 tsp salt since I love the sweet and salty flavor combination.  It turned out great!  This is a real keeper for us!

I used my Whirley Pop and a mixture of white and brown sugar! I love being able to make caramel corn right in the pot! No separate glaze is so much easier. I don't need a paper bag and I'm not risking a serious burn! Delicious!

I am now thinking that I should invest in the type of popcorn popper that has a handle to turn while on the stovetop.  Sugar did not dissolve, so there was a big clump of burned popcorn/sugar.  I kept shaking the pan every few seconds, but the popcorn burned anyway.  And apparently my nice pan doesn't have a great seal....a bit of the oil splattered.  Not a big deal, but odd...  So we will try this again someday, with another pan.  Seems like a fun recipe if it works!

OH HAPPY DAY!!!  Excellent, easy recipe.  This recipe turned out the best, tender, sweet kettle corn.  No burning.  Definately use a premium popcorn--it does pop up fluffier.  I used butter-flavored pan and grill oil from my local Gordon's Food Service.  Also, I used the "3 kernal rule" without fail.  I do not understand the rationale, but it must indicate an ideal oil temperature.  When the oil is ready, simply dump in the premeasured popcorn and sugar all at once.  Keep shaking or stirring (I highly recommend the Whirley-Pop) until done.  Pour out into a large bowl and lightly sprinkle with salt.  Mom is a rock-star again!  Thank you for a great recipe.

Love this popcorn, I have been making it for years.  One hint that may help others: it is recommended NOT to add salt until done popping the corn,  it burns much faster with the salt in it.  Enjoy!

Mine was finished popping like 3 minutes from when I put the kernels/sugar in (after the 3 kernel test). Is that usual? I was expecting longer, but then again ive never made popcorn on the stove and I must say this was a worthy effort! I can't wait for hubby to come home and eat it with me. If there's any left haha! Very yummy. Perfectly seasoned with the white sugar plus 1/2 tsp salt. Not as crunchy like candy like you get at the fair but not bad t'al. I am gonna make the brown sugar version too!

One question: When shaking, do you lift the pot and shake? Or hold it by the handles and slide it back and forth on the cooktop?

***edit***
after having done the brown sugar, I must say that the white sugar version is indeed better!

my question above still remains.  (I'm upping my rating to 5 for the white sugar version)

I am eating my 4th batch and have now perfected the technique!  Yes, use the gourmet corn.  Yes, put in the 3 kernels and then the sugar once they pop.  After about 15-20 secs add the corn kernels.  Keep stirring the Whirley Pop until you hear the popping almost over.  Remove from heat and add some salt to  machine and stir a bit.  I have a smooth cooktop and medium heat is just right.  I burned the first batch after cooking it over med-high.   Using the  magic eraser cleaned my pot beautifully after I had soaked it all night and tried baking soda to scrub it off.  I AM ADDICTED TO THIS STUFF, by the way...

Decent, but nothing I'd write home about. I used the 3 second rule in one of the reviews, and the 3 kernel test from another, but I still had some burnt sugar on the bottom. I probably won't make this again unless it's requested, and I highly doubt that.

After much experimentation, I have to say that sesame oil is the best for popping corn.  Sometimes a do a 2-1 ratio of sesame to olive oil.  The sugar addition to the popping is amazing.  I think I'm going to have to make some tonight!  This is one of my "great finds" on allrecipes.  I'm very happy!

I tried it three times, trying different things people suggested, and only one batch was half edible/half burnt. The other two were oily, sticky disasters. I'm a good cook, too. If I could give it 0 stars I would.

Add some food coloring to the sugar/oil mixture and the popped corn will turn colors!  Great for parties :)

I made a double batch and have almost eaten half of it in one day! it's so good! I used my stir crazy popcorn machine like the recipe submitter suggested. I just tossed in the oil with 3 kernels as others suggested, put the top on and when those popped I added the whole cup of corn and put the sugar on top. once it was done popping I transfered it to a bigger bowl and sprinkled with salt. Yum!

This was very good and very easy.  I did have a thin layer of "extra cripsy" ones, but that was my own fault because I kept it on the heat a bit too long.  I sprinkled the bowl with a little bit of salt after they were done, and that made them perfect.

Made it exactly as written and WOW it is fantastic!  I also follow the 3 kernel rule (heat oil over medium heat and add 3 kernels. When the 3 kernels pop, the oil is ready).   I always make stove top popcorn but usually I make it spicy.  This was such a nice, sweet treat and I will be making it again!  Thank you for a great recipe!!

Good, simple and quick.  I was a bit scared when the sugar hit the oil and sort of clumped up, but I just threw the kernals in, put the lid on and crossed my fingers!  I didn't really count the time, just made sure I moved the pot around pretty constantly which worked okay, though I did have a few "well done" kernels.  I might be a bit more careful with the heat next time, but I'm sure practice will make perfect, and I will get lots of it because I will make this again for sure.  Thanks!!

This is the best recipe!! Perfect each time!! I made 4 batches last night. I have an electric stove and I never turned it past "5". I mixed the sugar with the oil then I added the kernels and mixed it until the sugar started melting. I then shook it constantly and never needed to remove the pot from the heat until the popping slowed. I added a 1/4 tsp of sea salt after it was done popping. This was so easy, I told my 14 year old son how I made it 'only once' and this morning I smelled kettle corn. Yes, he "mastered" it the first time around!!!! He was so happy.

I've tried this recipe twice, once using granulated sugar, once using brown sugar, and both times all I ended up with was a nasty, sticky, mostly burned batch of popcorn.  I make our popcorn in a large kettle all the time, so my failures aren't due to my being someone who's only ever microwaved popcorn.  I followed the directions exactly both times, I never stopped moving the pan, and both times the sugar ended up turning into a browning/burning gloppy mess that never melded with the oil.  A large percentage of the kernels never popped, and popping seemed exceptionally s-l-o-w.

It is very important to use patience and follow the medium heat guideline for the stove. The first batch I made burnt badly because I turned the heat up too high. The second batch I made turned out perfectly tasty and crunchy. I followed the 3-second rule of shaking and sitting, and I stirred in a little salt after removing the pot from the heat. I will definitely be making this again!

Needed more sugar.  I have an electric stove so to get my temp to stay consistant was difficult.  My sugar did not melt into my oil it got really clumpy so it did not coat my popcorn evenly.

I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I put in 3 kernels of corn and listen for them to pop.  Then I put in the rest of the kernels, 1t salt, and the sugar, remove the pan from the heat for 30 seconds to let the kernels all come up to the same temp as the oil (I read this somewhere about cooking stovetop popcorn).  I find that this recipe turns out for me about half the time. . .the other half I burn it.  I think it's stove/technique and not a problem with the recipe.  When it turns out, it's delicious!!

This recipe is dead simple and absolutely delicious. The first two times I made it, I accidentally used only 1/4C popcorn kernels which resulted in a totally burned, terrible mess. Third time was a charm! I've got a huge bowl of the stuff sitting in front of me now. :) Super crispy, perfectly sweet, and perfectly salty. Will be making this again.

I musts be the only person on the planet that did not know you could make this at home!!! It's easy, and delicious, and addictive!! (My concern was that the pan would be impossible to clean--not so, washed up easily.) Next, I will try the recipe with brown sugar...

I've made this twice - once with white sugar and once with brown sugar.  The white sugar version turned out much better than the brown.

LOVED it! It was easier than I thought and it was so delicious I had to stop myself from eating it! ** I got some "gourmet infused sugars" from a spice shop in Florida, so I tried this recipe with the raspberry-infused sugar... HOLY MOSES was it amazing! If you can find flavored sugars, definitely give them a whirl with this recipe!

I made this but used 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar instead of white sugar. I have one one those hand crank whirly pop pans that keeps it stirred. I was afraid I was going to make a burned mess but it came out great. I did the 3 kernel pop test first then stirred in the sugar and added the corn.

This recipe is so easy and so incredibly good!  I pay $3.00 per bag at our local farmer's market, and can probably make the same amount at home for less thatn 50 cents!  Not to mention it tastes better!  Thank you for this awesom recipe!

This is EXACTLY like the kettle corn you get at the fairs.  I had the "mushroom kernal" corn from our local bulk food store and used it.  I did the 3 kernal test posted by other reviewers and it worked great!  Just make sure you let it cool!!!  Don't be tempted lile me and burn your mouth!

Good but not really like the Kettle Corn you get at the fair. The sugar/oil creates almost a candy coating rather than the light sweetness you get in fair popcorn. This is still delicious though! I use the WhirlyPop which makes it very easy and keeps it from burning.

Awesome! Quick, easy and delicious. I could eat the entire batch myself. I also recommend doing the 3 kernel test first before adding the rest of the popcorn and sugar. But really, you can't go wrong here. It's true, classic Kettle Corn.

Who knew kettle corn was so easy! I made up 3 batches and took it to a friend's bonfire.  I did sprinkle with salt when it came out of the pot.  The only problem I had (that has nothing to do with the recipe) is that I had a lot of unpopped seeds and because of the sugar they stuck to the other kernels so I had to pick them off which was a pain in the butt.  Next time I'll buy better popcorn.

I've done this recipe several times now and haven't been absolutely satisfied yet.  If I add the sugar before the kernels (after the 3 kernel test) , its so caramelized it tastes a little burnt. If I add the sugar at the same time, some of the pieces don't get any sugar on them.  Every time I've held it on the heat 3 seconds and off the heat 3 seconds shaking the whole time.  I always have a bunch of kernels that don't pop.  Maybe my 3 qt. dish is too small for the 1/2 cup of popcorn?  Maybe I need more oil?  It just doesn't work for me!

I too use the 3 kernel 'trick.' Right after they pop, I take them out. Then I add the sugar, stir it around a bit. BUT NOT FOR TOO LONG!! The first time I made it I made the mistake of waiting for the sugar to cook all the way down. The popcorn ended up tasting like burnt sugar. But if just stir it around for like 10 seconds and then add the popcorn, it turns out perfect. The 3 seconds on and 3 seconds off also works well.

I use about 5 tablespoons of oil and mix it with the sugar and keep shaking the popcorn.  It is very easy.  My family likes this more than the regular popcorn

This kettle corn is fantabulous!!  What little was left the next day was just as good, although warm is the best.)  Just be sure the follow the directions exactly (I kept shaking the whole time while over the burner) and do NOT try to double the batch.  It will burn if you double it!  I also added a few shakes of salt to the sugar/oil before adding the popcorn.  YUMMY!!  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing recipe!  I was skeptical about getting real kettle corn taste out of something I made at home, but it worked!  I had to scale down the recipe so that there'd be just enough for 2 people to consume in one sitting, and I used a Stir Crazy machine.  For 2 quarts, I used 1/3 cup of white popcorn, 3 tbsp. oil, and 3 tbsp. plus a pinch of white sugar.  I did the 3 kernel test, and then added the sugar and waited for it to melt, but it seemed the longer I waited for it to melt, the less melty the sugar looked, so when it got to a sort of clumpy consistency, I figured I'd better add the corn, but I wasn't expecting much, as I watched everything turn around with clumps of sugar peppering the kernals.  Once the corn was all popped, I immediately turned it out onto a foil lined sheet pan, sprinkled it all with salt, and had a taste.  Perfection!  The sugar lumps managed to melt in time and coat every single piece with just enough crispy, sugary goodness, and it really did have that brown, sugary, oily flavor that kettle corn is all about.  This is going to be a staple in my household from now on!

This did come out well and is tasty. But please remember it's a special treat! So many people are saying "I just ate two batches".... um, it has almost 1000 calories a batch. Another reviewer said it had 5 Weight Watcher points... absolutely not. It has 23!!

I made this in my Stir Crazy popcorn popper.  I let the oil, sugar and salt heat up a bit before adding the popcorn.  When it was done popping I transferred to a large bowl to break up the clumps and added a touch more salt.  Delicious!

This is great! I sprinkle a little salt after it's all popped, gives it that awesome sweet/salty flavor combo. Also, I've made this in my stir crazy popcorn maker. So easy! YUM

This was so delicious!  I burnt the first batch making like the instructions, but I took the advice of a reviewer and added 3 kernels to the oil and when they popped I knew my oil was done.  Then did 3 seconds on the burner and 3 seconds off shaking the pot to keep it from burning.  I also added a dash of salt at the end.  SO GOOD!  Great experience to share wtih kids, my son had never seen popcorn made on the stove before so was amazed!

Delicious and so easy! I like to add salt to mine for that great salty/sweet contrast. One time I thought I'd get creative and add cinnamon to the mix. It turns out cinnamon scorches easily, and it just does not taste good that way. I'll just stick to this perfect recipe!

I will drive to a local craft fair just for kettle corn, so when I saw the rave reviews for this recipe, I got my hopes up, and it didn't disappoint!  This really does taste like the kettle corn you get at fairs.  I did add salt while it was still hot, and that really did make a diffence. I followed the rules of 3 (3 kernals to know when oil is hot, then shake for 3, let it sit for 3).  I've made about 6 batches in the last month and each one has been perfect.

The fam and I love this popcorn, so much so that we made several batches in one day!  It is fun and easy to make, we did it over the stove with a large saucepan.  Took others advise with the 3 kernal test and had no problems.  We shouldn't love something so much but, we've made this everyday for the last week.  I don't know if its b/c its so good or just really fun to make.  Not to mention once it starts popping, it starts drawing a crowd!  We have experienced some carmelization but, that may or may not be normal.  Nobody has complained and a couple of the kids fight for the carmelized pieces.  Great recipe!

This is DANGEROUS!! I made a batch, and we had it gone before we were halfway through our movie! Definitely use the 3 kernel test (add oil, and 3 kernels of popcorn...when they pop, add sugar and the rest of the kernels).  I made this in my stir crazy popper, and it was SO easy not having to stir it all the time. This was quick and easy, and DELISH!

This was very, very good, and very, very simple. Making popcorn on the stove is always fun. The only improvement I can say is to use a little less sugar. Personally, I found it too sugary, even for kettle corn. But, it was still very tasty.

Fantastic!  I did the 3 kernel test, added the sugar when they popped, gave the pan a swirl, then added the corn.  I did 3 sec on the heat, 3 sec off while shaking.  While I did burn a little of the sugar, I still got no complaints :)  Nice light sweetness!

GREAT and easy recipe - wouldn't say it tastes as good as the fair fare ( ;) )but really, REALLY liked it!!  Especially liked one reviewers tip of putting a few kernels in to see when the oil is ready.  Just to note - I used Orville Reddenbacher popcorn kernels and a followed the recipe exactly - felt the oil & sugar amounts were a little too much - have since made the recipe cutting back on the oil and sugar - IS PERFECT THIS WAY - super recipe! Thanks!

Maybe someone could help me!  I just tried making this recipe 2 times and both times were failures!  I used a large stock pot, and the first time I tried doubling the recipe, the kernels didn't pop after 10 minutes, and my sugar was brown, so I threw it out and started over. (I even did the 3 Kernel test)  This last time, I made the recipe for the quantities stated- after the 3 kernels popped, I added the sugar and salt, stirred, then added the kernels.  I put my lid on and did the 3 second shake, rest 3 seconds.  It seemed like it took forever for my kernels to pop again and when they did, it was at a very slow pace.  Then after 5-7 minutes, I had a very small amount popped and it was all really dark brown.  So, I'm really confused.  Was my oil too hot or not hot enough?  What have I done wrong? I would really like to use this recipe, after seeing so many wonderful things written about it!  I still rated it good, b/c I didn't want to hurt the ratings! If anyone could help, it would be greatly appreciated!

I like the smidgen of salt as well added to this treat. I have the BEST tip for popcorn pan. Use your Wok. Use a big lid from any frying pan- the popcorn goes upward with the shape and you will burn nothing! I use a few table spoons of Peanut oil for added flavor to cook the kernels in. To make the butter a bit more healthy, I use Lee Iaacocca's butter spread. Actually is a very good butter substitute! Thanks- Mrs. Ratfire

I made this using white sugar, and my husband and I gobbled it up so quickly the kids barely had any!  I used the 3 kernel test as recommended by another reviewer and popped the corn as I used to as a child.....holding the pot about 1 inch above the burner (on high) swirling the pot constantly.  I toss/shake the pot every 15 seconds or so.  When the popping slows I take the pot off the burner for a few seconds and swirl...put it back abover the burner for a few seconds to listen for more pops.  If there are no more pops within 2 seconds you are finished.  I toss for another 30-45 seconds while the pot is off the burner as it cools a bit.  It sounds like hard work....but think of it as a great shoulder work out!  I think I will add a tiny bit of salt next time ....as kettle corn in these parts is a sweet and slightly salty mix.  great recipe...thanks.

This came out good. The sugar did end up burning to the bottom. I may have left it on too long. I'll be trying this again.

I just made this recipe - we're up late watching the World Series and the kids wanted kettle corn. It's excellent! I added salt right after it was finished popping. The next time I might use butter-flavored oil or part butter to get a more buttery flavor, but it came out crispy and perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmm, mmm, good! This was my first time making stove-top popcorn... Did as the other reviews suggested: 3 kernel test & 3 seconds/off. My popcorn turned out perfect, I have yet to burn a batch! My favourite way to prepare it is by mixing spices (1/4 tsp 4-spice + 1/4 tsp cinnamon) into the sugar before putting it in. I add it at the same time as the kernels. I actually love it best cooled, bring a bag with me to nibble on throughout the day.

The main problem with this recipe is that salt is not in the ingredients list. I just used a salt shaker to sprinkle a bit on before serving.

Also, it takes practice to keep the sugar from burning. I am used to making popcorn by shaking the pot over a burner, but I still had some trouble with burned sugar. 

Just watch carefully and read the other reviewer's tips for success. My first attempt was still pretty good, not at all gooey as others reported.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!  I attempted to make this recipe after I realized that i missed our street fair today, and I refused to wait several more months until I could eat fresh kettle corn again.  After trying this recipe I can honestly say that I will NEVER EVER buy kettle corn at the fair anymore!  This tastes the same, if not better, than the stuff at the fair..and since you make it yourself you can control how much sugar you put in it.

I followed the advice of other users and my kettle corn turned out perfectly first time around.  I used a non-stick wok with a clear lid so I could see what was going on.  I heated the oil to medium high along with three kernels.  Immediately after they popped I threw in the sugar and the kernels and had to use a spoon to mix them up at first because they didn't seem to mix even after shaking the wok, so the spoon worked great.  I covered it and did the 3-second-shake-and-wait deal and it turned out perfectly!  Just sprinkled with some salt and it tasted perfect!  Thanks for submitting, and thanks for the tips to make it better allrecipes users!

I wouldn't go as far to say this was just as good as REAL kettle corn, but it was ok.  Although, it was pretty oily.

I'm giving it five stars for taste, 4 for appearance.  I followed the directions as stated, doing the 3 second shake method.  My sugar carmelized but due to the constant shaking I didn't have a big burned mess.  I'm sure it will just take more finesse and maybe a little lower temp to make it not as caramelized looking.  Kids loved it and we gobbled the whole bunch!

I added 1/2 tsp. salt to the Oil/Sugar Mixture which I heated and stirred first like another cook said. My first attempt was scrubbing the burnt gooey mess for 1/2 hr.  My other thought would be to pan spray the pot first.  For a "Hot and Sweet Variation" add 1 tsp. Chipotle Powder for those who want an extra Zing!  The original recipe is fabulous and give it 5 Stars :-)

Wow!  I made this in my "Stir Crazy" popper w/equal parts OR butter flavored oil and canola oil.  When the oils were hot, I added sugar (didn't measure...maybe 3-4 tblsp?).  Then, the kernels.  Next time I will add more sugar (I was a little conservative this time not knowing how the sugar would work in the popper & am not a big fan of cleaning messes :) ), but I kinda like the mild taste w/less sugar, too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I bought a whirleypop popcorn popper just for this recipe.  I think I gained 5lbs in a week because I made and ate so much. It has spoiled me, I can't go back to microwave kettle corn.

I made this exactly how the directions said along with other reviewers' tips for testing 3 kernels for oil rediness and the 3 seconds on the burner between shaking (I did 3 seconds on the burner & 3 seconds of shaking).  It came out perfect!  You do have to let it cool or else you'll be eating a gooey ball...lol.  I guess I was a lil' impatient the 1st time but I couldn't help myself.  As it cooled, it was perfect.  I had just enough kernels to do this batch. I have to run out to the store for more!

I doubled and tweaked this a bit.  Used 1/2 white sugar, and 1/2 brown, added a tsp of vanilla. Yum!  Oh and I like to do half oil/half butter too. (I have a crew to feed here, thus the automatic doubling ;) )
Thanks for the start!

Absolutely wonderful!! I used some butter flavored popcorn oil instead of the vegetable oil and I used the 3 secind interval method suggested in another review and it came out perfect on my first try!!Its the most work i've ever put into making popcorn since I have heavy pots but it was totally worth it and increased my appetite so I can eat more. Thanks!!

This is a fantastic recipe--I've made it many times now.  A couple of things you might want to keep in mind: medium heat on my burner ended up being 4 out of 10 heat levels (there were a couple of scorched bottoms before I figured out what was the proper temp.)  When the popcorn is done, it is REALLY HOT so be careful, and have a bowl ready to dump it into.  Finally, since this is so sticky, watch out for unpopped kernals (hard on the teeth!)  Overall, though, a really great recipe!

Really good taste, used a bit more than 1/2 cup corn kernels, used 1/3 cup sugar, stuck together a bit, had to break it apart after it cooled some.  Used Crisco instead of veg. oil, doesn't burn nearly as easy and doesn't leave an oily residue on popcorn any way you cook what I always use fo regular popcorn too.

What a treat! I halved the ingredients just to try it first and see if I wouldn't burn and waste it. Then of course, gobbled it right up just to satisfy my ego. If I could do it..so can you! I used a stock pot and an oversized lid and followed the directions verbatim. I took the advice of other reviews and mixed the sugar and oil first til it was hot and carmelized. I kept a wooden spoon in there stirring the bottom of the pot. Then added my kernels. Watch out, some of the hot kernels will pop out of the opening where the wooden spoon is and get your skin. Once it starts popping, be quick: shake, stir, shake, stir! If you are using an electric burner, take the pot off the burner when you hear the pops more than 5 seconds apart. No farmer's markets w/kettle corn here in Okinawa, Japan. I will make this over and over again!

This kettle corn is awesome!  It's the perfect blend between salty and sweet, my favorite combinations.  I followed the directions by one reviewer:  PabloJR who wrote on 11/30/05.  Do as he says and you'll be completely satisfied!  Tonight, I also made "Vickie's Beer Bread" and it's wonderful, too!

it turned out ok with white sugar but when i made it with brown sugar it burned too quickly.  maybe it would work better on a gas range but i have electric.  i'll stick to a different caramel corn recipe i already have.

I used my Whirly-Pop (which is great for keeping the kernals moving rapidly), butter-flavor popping oil and about 1/2 tsp. salt in with the sugar.  I put the 3 kernals recommended by other users into the oil and when they popped I quickly added the popping corn then the sugar/salt mixture. I found the sugar seems to make it take longer to pop so you have to be very careful that it doesn't scorch.  Mine didn't really but it was just "this side" of scorching.  It was a little sticky at first but separated and dried quickly.  Very tasty - I almost ate the whole batch myself!  Can't wait to try this for my kids and husband - he loves kettle corn!

This was a difficult recipe to get right on a gas stove. The first time, half the kernels were not popped because I was afraid to burn the corn. The second and third time I tried it, it was burnt and I even did the 3 kernels in the pan first then add the corn and sugar. The fourth time was best: Add 1 extra TB oil than what the recipe called for and add the kernels. Wait to hear the first pops, then quickly add the sugar to the pot. Shake the pan continuously until the popping slows down. This is the only way I’ve tried to keep it from burning on a gas stove. I’m addicted to this stuff! Plain popcorn just doesn’t appeal to me anymore, ?

Holy cow, this kettle corn is AMAZING!  My husband has been buying microwave kettle corn, and I don't think it tastes right at all.  This recipe actually tastes just like the stuff I used to get at the Farmer's Market when we lived in the US.  I added about a teaspoon of salt (I highly recommend doing this!) and used buttery flavored popping oil.  I'd give it another star if I could, just because you burn some calories shaking the pot before you even start to eat!  I sat my two oldest kids down with a big paper bag full of this, and I haven't heard a peep out of them since!

Just like the Fair! I have a Video Store with a commercial popcorn popper, so I don't have to worry about stirring or shaking, but I'm sure the "Stir-Crazy" or comparable work just as well. I use coconut oil and increase the sugar a little, and customers just love it! For Christmas I'm going to try alternating each batch with red and green food coloring for Christmas colored Kettle Corn! I'm sure it will be a big hit! Thanks Sue!

This is really good, probably as close to the fair corn you can get. The first time I made it, however, I had a sticky, somewhat burned mess. Be careful not to get distracted! I tried it again right away and shook it contantly, as well as adding the sugar ahead of the pocorn and mixing it with the oil. Thanks!

Delicious!!  I substituted butter flavored Crisco for the oil and waited for the 3 kernels to pop.  Then I added the sugar, swirled the pan until it was dissolved and added the corn.  Covered, then shook till all had popped.  I salted mine when it was done and poured it out on waxed paper to cool.  Great holiday gift!!

This popcorn is so yummy! For best and easiest results get a Whirly-pop popcorn popper. You can find them at Target. Also, my kids love it when I color the popcorn in their favorite color! Simply add 4-5 drops of food coloring with the oil and sugar. I always send this with the kids to school on their snack day. All of their classmates sing thier praises!!!

This recipe is awesome and the popcorn totally addictive. After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure I'd get it right the first time, but it turned out great. I did follow the suggestions by many to let three kernels of popcorn pop in the oil before adding the sugar, then stirring it quickly and then adding the rest of the popcorn kernels. And shake it the whole time. For what it's worth, I used a Calphalon pan, and it worked fine.

The ONLY way to have popcorn!  I became addicted to kettle corn on a trip to the US earlier this year and couldn't rest until I'd mastered it.  I recently bought myself a Whirley Pop popper and it makes this SO easy (the Whirley Pop also allows me to reduce oil to 2 tbsp., which I like much better.)  Anyone without a popper:  follow the instructions to the letter (as well as the advice of people on here who have success with this recipe) and you will not be disappointed.  A sprinkle of salt after it's cooked is mandatory!  YUMMMMMM...

This is my second review of this recipe.  My first was almost exactly 3 years ago.  This has become a favorite snack of not only my family, but many of my friends as well.  I have made eight batches in a day for cub scout meetings and hundreds of batches for family movie nights and computer gaming nights. I know of several families who now own Stir Crazy poppers as a result of my spreading this recipe around. The Stir Crazy makes this recipe a cinch.  I put the oil and sugar in together, and when the sugar is mostly melted I put in the corn and cover it up.  I do not shake the popper (that's what the stirring rod is for, right?). And I add salt at the end. The only downside is the cleanup, which can be difficult since you cannot immerse the popper.  My Stir Crazy is getting pretty worn out after all the use, so I'm considering getting a Whirly Pop as a replacement.  I think the clean up will be easier, and I can take it camping.  I can't stand s'mores, but I LOVE Kettle Corn!

This is our new family favorite!!
My kids ask for it everyday!
I used the suggestion of putting 3 kernals in first and added some salt...and it works perfectly!! YUMMY!!!
I have an old fashion crank popcorn popper which makes this recipe So easy! 
Thanks a million!!

Good Stuff- I was tempted to make a second batch after my mom and sis gobbled the first one up in seconds - I followed the suggestions of putting three kernals in 1/2 cup oil and it was foolproof - just don't lose hope, it WILL pop eventually and ignore the groans and complaints of family members when your constant shaking of a pan begins to annoy them- they will be thanking you later. Also, i'm a sugar-a-holic so if you want that at-the-fair-coated-with-sugar treat i would suggest adding more.

YUM! But ya gotta follow the modifications that others have suggested.  It comes out perfect every time.  Place 3 Tbsp oil in the pot and a few kernels of corn.  Once these kernels pop, immediately add the rest of the corn and all the sugar.  Shake constantly without peeking.  Definitely sprinkle the popped corn with a little salt.

I had no trouble with it at all. I am old enough to remember when we used to always make popcorn on the stove and I knew that I had to shake from beginning to end. Don't try to do something else at the same time. Just keep shaking!

Thank-you! Thank-you! Thank-you! My grandfather used to make this for us kids 40 years ago.  It brings back wonderful memories of cold winter nights of sitting around the kitchen table, playing rummy and eating popcorn.  My mother and I have talked many times about this recipe and have looked through all my grandmother's old recipes to find it...with no luck. This tastes exactly like I remember my grandfather's to taste!!!!  I can't wait to suprise Mom with it on a cold evening this winter.

Turned out great!  I just wish I had the kind of popcorn kernels that pop as big as the ones at the fair...then it would be perfect.  I followed the other hints that others listed...so it turned out delicious.

This is a good one!  I deviated slightly from the recipe for two reasons: 1) I was not sure that I had a large enough pot for the standard size recipe, and 2) I did not have any vegetable oil in the house, but wanted to try the recipe right away!  In the place of vegetable oil I used equal parts clarified butter (easy to prepare your own) and light tasting olive oil.  It turned out well; I am not sure if was as good as the kettle corn I recently bought at a festival, but then again I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be trying this again with canola or corn oil (can't wait!).  You've got to try this one!  If you've never had kettle corn before, prepare to enjoy!

I was very happy to find this recipe.  After reading the reviews I remembered that I have a Stir Crazy popcorn popper (I rarely used it).  It really made this recipe a no fail one.  With a little salt it tastes just like the kettle corn you buy at fairs. Thanks!

The first time I had kettle corn was on my honeymoon.  I was so excited to be able to make this at home.  I've made this 3 times and I've found that it works well to use a frying pan instead of a large sauce pan.  Great recipe!!

I'm 16 meaning I'm not a very sophisticated chef!! But I love kettle corn so I had to give this a try.  The other reviews kind of scared me, but I tried to follow most of the tips... we didn't have any no-stick pans, so I had to make the best of it. It worked considerably well even though its not evenly coated... just thought I'd let ya know its pretty kid-friendly!

Help!!!  I tried this recipe three times in a row.  Here are the stats:  Calphalon Commercial pan over medium gas heat popcorn, oil and sugar (I doubled the recipe, is that the problem???) all three times a burning mess, not to mention tired arms from shaking and "popping" my pot so many times (Calphalon is heavy stuff).  Please anyone with advice help me.

Worked great!  Electric stove, medium heat, large non-stick skillet with lid.  I mixed it all together, heated it up, and waited until it began popping.  Once popping started, I continually shook the pan.  Nearly every kernel popped.

Delicious! Better than commercial kettle corn. I read all the reviews and tried a few ways until I found what works for me. Pouring out the popcorn quickly once it’s done popping is very important or it burns. Adding a little salt to the sugar makes it even tastier. Try it a few ways until you find what works for you.

Yums! Great method. I use an all clad steamer pot. Heavy and tall sides. Lovely light crunch as it cools. Just a hint of sweet. Perfect. I also add a tsp. Of salt for a savory/sweet taste.

You have to be really fast - toss it all in once the oil is good and hot, and then shake immediately and keep shaking the whole pot. 

 We add a teaspoon of salt as well to make sweet and salty kettle corn. Love this.

First time making popcorn in a pan on the stove.  Substituted brown sugar for white and added 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Easy as so many other reviewers instructed techniques.  Hubby, who doesn't care for Kettle Korn said he liked it as it wasn't as sweet as store/fair purchased.  I'm thinking this would be great with peanuts, M&Ms and/or colored with your favorite football team colors.  I can imagine one add food coloring at the time you add the sugar.

Great recipe! Don't forget to do the 3 kernel test for the oil heat! 

I added 2 drops of lemon essential oil to the oil when I added the sugar. Added just the right depth of flavor to the sweet popcorn!

Really yummy! Tastes really good if you use coconut oil and turbinado sugar instead! I used the 3 kernel strategy on the first go and it turned out perfect!

Wow, this stuff is good. And don't feel like you have to eat it all the same day. It was good the next night too! I used the 3 sec shake rule and peanut oil. And added salt at the end. Oh, I did burn my finger when I picked up a piece of popcorn that had the melted sugar on it. Let it cool for a few minutes!

Great recipe - the closest I have come to making homemade popcorn is Jiffy Pop! This is a winner - sweet, salty and yummy! Easy to do too - I followed suggestions from other reviewers and let three kernels pop, stirred the sugar in (I used Stevia) and shake-shake-shake! Thanks so much for sharing!

I am sitting here eating a giant bowl of awesomeness and it was my first attempt. Even though I burned a few pieces at the end, it was still amazing! I mixed brown sugar and white sugar but next time I'll probably just do the white sugar. Perfection!

Perfect! I always cook my popcorn on the stove, so this was really just adding the sugar, but boy did it turn out wonderful! First try came out great, every piece was coated it a sweet crisp coating. I heated my oil (coconut) to temp, added my sugar and swirled it in, then dumped and swirled the popcorn. 

I use a large heavy dutch oven with a snug fitting lid for popping corn, and always keep my pan moving, but I cook on gas, so lifting the pan slightly to shake and toss the corn isn't a big deal. As soon as it was ready, I dumped it in a large bowl and sprinkled sea salt over it. Since I already always make my popcorn on the stove, I know the technique well. if you are not used to stove top popping, I suggest trying a few regular batches first to get a feel.

Delicious, will be making this again!

Followed the recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN and was disappointed with the results - it looked like caramel, but lacked the humph (flavour). Crunchy good! Approximately half of the corns did not pop!

This recipe delicious. When I make it I like to add brown sugar along with the white. I also add salt to the oil and sugar so it is more evenly distributed. I don't  do the 3 kernel test I just let my stove get hot while I gather everything together, then added the oil sugar and salt, stirred it around for a second then added the popcorn. Perfect!

Wow! Wonderful! This is very quick and delicious! Never knew it could be so easy to make. I made a large bowl and stored in small serving size baggies for quick snacks!! It doesn't matter if the sugar clumps or browns to much ( but don't burn it) because it tastes that much better!! Very crispy to the bite!!

Turned out awesome. Only thing I wish is that the sugar had more even coverage. I may try a little more oil next time to see if that helps. Otherwise, Tasty!!

I use Virgin Coconut oil and a good quality Himalayan sea salt when I make this. The coconut oil gives just a slight hint of coconut goodness without overwhelming and is also healthy, the high quality sea salt makes a noticeable difference by adding an additional layer of flavor.

I've been making popcorn in a pan on the stove my whole life and decided to try something new. I overheated the oil and burned the sugar on the first batch and scalded my arm with oil splatter on the second. The upside, the second batch was delicious!

I love this recipe!  I can't believe I can make kettle corn on my stove that tastes just like the stuff you buy at fairs!  I never buy it at the fairs anymore because this is so easy to make.

One more thing, with all the shaking of the pot this is a great arm workout!  :)

I sized this down and used sunflower oil rather than vegetable oil for health benefits.  It was an all around yummy and basic recipe for kettle corn that I will continue to use.  I will also experiment with coconut oil in the future since our local popcorn shop swears by it saying you get the biggest, fluffiest kernels by using it.

Failed, when tried with brown sugar,I followed directions and still it burned and was a mess.I always do popcorn and never had a problem. I can even do white sugar well but the brown sugar was a failure for me.

The kids, husband and dog gobbled it up and immediately demanded more.  I used the 3 kernel test, like others suggested, and followed one reviewer's advice to mix unpopped corn with a tablespoon of melted butter, sugar and salt before putting into the hot oil all at once. The kernels came out evenly coated with a light layer of crunchy caramel, just lightly browned.  Perfect!

Took a few tries, but now I've got the hang of it! Stir the pot with a wooden spoon when you first add the sugar to make sure everything coats nicely, and then don't stop shaking!

Tried doing this with the sugar added in with the oil first to melt.  The popcorn was good but was more caramel in color.  Tried it the second time just as stated with 1/2 teaspoon salt thrown in.  Turned out perfect!!!  The 3 second on/off heat was right on.

Great recipe. I had to make it a few times to perfect it, but I finally did it. I definitely recommend putting salt in with the sugar. When the popcorn cools you can separate the pieces that are stuck together.

the kerneel test didn't work,  and the pot was difficult to clean.  The popcorn was not easy to make as it was burnt, and small explosion occurred.

The kids and I used to frequent the NC State Fair every fall, but after my husband's job moved us to southern Texas we had to find ways to incorporate old traditions in new places. This recipe brought back the crisp mornings and sweet smells of fall leaves even in 90 degree weather where the leaves won't turn till after the new year. 
Excellent recipe, so glad we found it and can add it to the ever growing list of "reminds us of back home" things. 
We used the 3 seconds on, 3 seconds off trick and the very first batch came out perfectly. Now all we need is a great candy apple recipe and some hot apple cider :)

I did the 3 kernel test (put them in the pan when the oil is not heated yet - then they won't fly out if the oil's already hot), added my sugar next (might go a bit over 1/4 c next time) and immediately after sprinkling it in to the hot oil dumped in my kernels and placed the lid on the whole thing.

I think the key is the rigth pan and the right heat on your stove, so some people might have to test this a few times.  I used my Lagostina stainless steel skillet (with a clear glass lid - made it easy to see when done) which has a handle on each side which made the shaking easy.  I put on oven mitts, gripped the lid with my thumbs and shook vigorously, lifting the pan off the heat for 4 second intervals.  You need to shake hard enough to get the kernels on the bottom OFF the bottom.  This will alleviate burning.

All in all, I've learned I like a bit more sugar and also think that next time instead of dumping the whole lot into my bowl, I'll dump in layers, adding salt as I go.  It was hard to distribute the salt evenly when the korn was still sticky.

Awesome!  I never knew I could make kettle corn on the stove, and I'm super excited because I loooove this stuff!  Followed the recipe exactly aside from halfing it, and I did do the "kernel test" like I always do with popcorn.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Delicious!! I also added salt so it would have that salty/sweet combo. I'll definitely make this again! I was nervous about burning the sugar and it sticking to the pan, so I sprinkled it on the popcorn once it was cooked.

So Darn good!!!  Wicked easy to make.  Followed directions exactly cooking on medium heat so as not to burn the sugar.  I have a theater time popcorn popper so constantly swirling the kernels.  Sprinkled with a little kosher salt and wahla!  Thanks for the recipe it will save me losts of money.  No more buying bagged Kettle Corn.

Fantastic recipe!!!!! The secret to it not burning is to heat the oil on med and pop 3 kernels of corn, take out the 3 pieces of pop-corn so they do not burn. Add the popcorn and the sugar and stir well. (I used Bakers ultra fine sugar, it melts easy and coats the corn.) Now holding the lid on the pan swirl the pan in a small circle over the burner until the corn stops popping. Delicious, perfect kettle corn. We put a dash of salt on the finished kettle corn. Yummy!!!!!!!!

Amazing and simple.  I might do a little less oil next time, but other than that it was PERFECT.

The first time I made this it was awesome.  Then I tried to halve the recipe and it burnt every time.  Make this exactly as it says.  I test with 1 kernal before adding popcorn and sugar.  Then shake continuously til it pops, then every three seconds or so until popping slows.  I cook it on 6 or 7 on my electric range.

I have had this recipe saved for a while but had not tried it. I kept making the microwave popcorn from this site because I thought this one would take too long. Well I was wrong and sad I had waited this long! It was fantastic! And super fast! And totally worth the dirty pan (which was actually a breeze to clean)! This will be a regular at our house from now on!!!

Did the Caramel Corn variation with brown sugar instead of white...it was awesome!  I think it was even better with some salt added.

Easy and Fast! Do make sure to heat your oil first! Also, sprinkle with a little salt when you dump it into a bowl - makes a ton of difference.

My second attempt at this recipe was a success!  I did the 3 kernel test, added the sugar and made sure it was dissolved, then added the popcorn.  Shake, shake, shake and perfect kettle corn!  If I don't divide it up into seperate bowls I will eat it all myself. YUM!

I really did not expect this to taste like the kettle corn you get at the local fairs or farmer markders But let me tell you it sure did.  So easy to make it was crazy.  I used my Whirley Pop and I used coconut oil and it was amazing.  Make sure you do you use the 3 popcorn rule. I could not stop eating it.  I have to figure out how to make it so there are less calories, since I WANT to make it a couple times a week. Great recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I used the 3 kernel rule and a Whirley-pop.  After the initial kernels popped, I added the sugar and "whirled" it a bit, then added the rest of the corn and whirled it constantly. Turned out nice and crispy.  All of the corn was evenly coated.  I added a few sprinkles of salt when it was done. I can't believe kettle corn is so easy! Edit - I now add salt (less than a tsp) with the sugar.  The salt adheres with the sugar.  Also, like other reviewers stated, quality popcorn is key!

My version is a little sweeter - I use 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/4. After it's all popped I sprinkle a little sugar on top & a few splashes of salt to give it more of a kettle corn flavor! BIG hit at this house (I have a 2 & 3 yr old)!!!

OH MY GOODNESS!!! OKAY... First of all I must say that I am from East Texas and absolutely love pop corn, but there is this guy in East Texas that is always at the First Monday trade days in Canton, that I think makes the absolute best kettle corn I ever ate, well until now. This last month when we were there, of course I got some and thought I tasted just a hint of cayenne in it, and maybe that was what made it different. Well, of course when I saw this recipe, I thought, I must try this and add me some cayenne, just to check it out. All I can say is ...mmmmmm mmmmmmmmm good! Thanks so much for sharing this!

I don't have it down to a science yet, but even without it being perfected, I know the taste will be WONDERFUL!  The hints I can offer from my first time making it:  quality popcorn probably does make a difference (I had store-brand on hand, so that's what I used - a lot of my kernels didn't pop); I used 2T oil & 2T butter to = the 1/2 cup of oil that's called for, but I'll cut back next time; DEFINITELY do the 3 kernel test; I kept my heat between medium/medium high the entire time and had the slightest of burning issues, but it was more from a lack of vigorous shaking; have your sugar and popcorn already measured out and ready to pour in so you can start stirring right away and get the lid on.  

I am testing this recipe out to give as a favor for a baby shower, so I added food coloring.  If you are doing this, add it at the same time you add the sugar & popcorn.  I don't know how much I added, it was more than I planned, but it does not entirely cover the popcorn.  There's a lot of white leftover, but it still looks nice.  You'd go thru a lot of bottles to get every bit colored.

My kids loved it; my husband & I can tell the potential for greatness is there, I just need to do a bit of tweaking.  Still, for my very first time making it, I give it 5 stars because it's good, cheap, and homemade!

Very easy to make and tastes exactly like what I have to pay over $6 for at the local outdoor markets! I made this and put in paper lunch bags and gave as a Christmas gift to those on my kid's paper route. It was a hit!! I also make this whenever we have a sweet tooth.

Use a heavy pot and lid, follow the directions and keep shaking!!

I skimped on the sugar and it did not come out as well. Cheap and easy and so much better for you than store bought if you are using canola oil.

When I read the reviews I just had to try this recipe even though I thought it was too good to be true. Well, I just finished the whole pot myself and will have to make another lot for my son this afternoon. I used ghee (for the butter taste) and it was so easy to make and no mess! Thank you for the good advice. I followed it and had no problem whatsoever. No more ordinary popcorn for us!

This is an AWESOME recipie... I've been making this for years.  My love for fair kettle corn forced me to experiment in the kitchen. I found that shaking the cooked corn in a large paper bag with a sprinkle of salt helps to break up the chunks and distribute the saly evenly... ENJOY THIS

I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible, and found that the sugar caramelized before the popcorn popped, which made it burn before the popcorn was done popping. i then read the other reviews -  use 3 kernel test and that you add the sugar AFTER the kernals pop! i'll have to try it again with the review info duely noted!

This tastes exactly like the kettle corn I purchased at the Flea Market here in San Antonio!  The only difference is they use a mushroom popcorn kernel instead of the normal kernel.  The mushroom kernel is fluffy and bigger.  

  This did take a few attempts to get the technique down.  For this amount in the recipe, I used a smaller pot.  I was using a large stock pot, but the results were not good and would burn with the original amount called for in this recipe.  Once I switched pots, it was perfect and so easy to make at home!  I would recommend trying this and you'll love it!  Very inexpensive to make and so easy!  I love kettle corn!  I did follow the recipe exactly, just added popcorn salt (you can use regular or sea salt) once the popcorn was dumped into a bowl when finished.  NOTE:  I did use the 3 second technique and would lift the lid (just a little tiny bit) to allow some heat to escape.  I found that lifting the lid helped to not burn the kettle corn.  I make this stuff like 2-3 times a week! We all addicted to this stuff!  Everyone who trys it, loves it!!

Tips: SALT & COCONUT OIL!!!  A 1/2 tsp of salt is a MUST, and use coconut oil (i like Nutiva brand, but any extra virgin, organic, unfiltered, unrefined coconut oil should do) it's healthier, tastier, less likely to burn! I only use coconut oil when poopping popcorn. Oh I used a stove top popcorn popper, my "pan shaking" version burned.

Bestill my heart, I have a new favorite popcorn recipe!  For those of you who have burned it, the trick is to keep the pan moving constantly over the heat.  You will be well rewarded for your efforts.  YUM!

This was perfect! Thank you!  (I added a tsp. of vanilla extract with the oil)  We've dubbed this "Noisy Popcorn" because the crispy texture of the popcorn makes a rattling sound in the bowl. :)

This is the BEST popcorn ever.  I learned how to make it and I can't stop eating it.  Everytime I make it for friends they beg me for the recipe.  I also do the 3 kernel trick to know when the oil is ready and it comes out perfect everytime.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Very good and simple! Good just the way it is but I think next time I may add a little salt or butter to the crisco before popping.

I love this recipe. I had a lot of luck with it when I had a gas range but I moved and now (unfortunately) have an electric stove top. Now I  have trouble keeping the sugar from burning on the bottom of the pot. I shake shake shake but it still ends up sticking and burning. I have fluctuated the heat, kernel to oil ratio and timing but to no luck. I guess I am just not accustomed to the new burner. My only advice....be sure to shake.

This is wonderful.  Just like the kettle corn you buy at farmers markets and fairs.   I used a handcrank popper and I had no problems with sticking or burning.  My family and I really enjoyed it and I will make it again.

This kettle corn is AMAZING! I swear I make it like every night almost... since my little girl is sensitive to dairy, I cant have my typical late night sugar fixes - ice cream, cookies and milk, etc - and this hits the spot. Use confectioners sugar tho... yummy!

This is a great recipe!  I'm giving four stars instead of five because it took a couple times to get it right..  Here's what I've learned: using a glass top pot is better so you can see in.  Cut the recipe in half, and it'll all cook a bit faster and leave less time and chance for burning.  I used a large tall sided frying pan with a lid.  The 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup sugar is fine.  Although I threw about 2tsp of salt in with the sugar.  When it finally worked right for me, I've reduced the popcorn to 1/4 cup as well.  I use about 10 kernels for the pop test and once they all FULLY pop, count to 30 before putting in the sugar and popcorn.  Shake 3/3 like others have recommended...  Lastly, I dump it all out on a sheet pan or waxed paper and shake it, in batches through a wide strainer to get out any unpopped kernels...  Family loves it --- especially on those cold movie nights!!!

This was amazing! I've never made popcorn on the stove before and was worried I was going to mess it up but it turned out great.  I added about a tsp. of salt to the sugar and it came out tasting wonderful! I will never buy microwave kettle corn again. This is about 100 times better than any microwave popcorn I've ever had.

This is very tasty.  My 10 year old daughter and I made this and the only thing we changed was to add a pinch of salt for that sweet and salty taste we associate with kettle corn.  Thumbs up!

I love kettle corn but it's so high at the fair and I want to be able to have it more than once a year.This is a good recipe but the kind I get at the fair is a whole lot sweeter.I guess I'm just used to the sweeter kind so I add more sugar and of course I have to salt it after it pops.I use a whirley popper which works great.Be sure and take it off the heat as soon as the popping slows down because it does burn very easily.The only problem I have is it's highly addictive and I can't stop eating it!

All I can say is delicious!!!  I have been paying high prices for Kettle Corn Popcorn..and now I can save my money and make my own!  It is so much better than buying it at a fair or supermarket.  I followed Krystenl directions on the 3 seconds and mine came out perfect.  Thanks everone!  Now I am going to eat!

So good.  I used coconut oil and it added a subtle coconut flavor.  I used less sugar and added salt.

So easy & yummy...and so much cheaper than buying it at the fair or farmer's market. I did add a dash of salt like other reviewers' recommended. Sugary, salty goodness! Since I don't have a large pot to make this in, I just halved the ingredients and made it in a 10-inch covered skillet, and there was still plenty.

We loved this! I used 3/4 cup kernels instead of 1/2.  Mine ended up caramelizing a bit on the popped corn- it was delicious!  The second time I made this, I mixed it with a second batch of popcorn I made with salt and melted butter- that was an amazing combination!

I made this for my kids as an after school snack.  When they came bursting through the door, the first thing they said was, "I knew that smell was coming from our house!"  They could smell it a block away.  Even other kids on their way home were making comments about that delicious smell.  It was very tasty and quick.  I also added a little bit of salt with the sugar (about 1/8 - 1/4 t).  The bowl was empty in a matter of minutes.  We'll definitely make it again.  (By the way, I hadn't ever heard of the 3 kernel test before.  It's pure genius!)

So nobody else has mentioned this that I've seen, but my oil was popping like crazy before my three kernels popped, so it was dangerous to try and look and see when the kernels actually popped. Has anyone else had this problem? I added the popcorn and sugar too soon because I thought the three kernels had popped when they hadn't, so some of the popcorn burned. But I'm giving it 4 stars because the stuff that isn't burned tastes yummy! (By the way, I used half coconut oil, and I used sucanat instead of refined sugar. yum!)

Yum, Yum Yum and easy too!  I tested 3 kernels.  When they popped I added the sugar and kernels.   I did the 3 second rule...shake for 3 seconds and cook for 3 seconds.  Didn't burn and tastes sooooo good.   I will use this again for an easy snack.

I followed the directions per the review from February 24, 2005, three second rule. I attempted the recipe two times and the second time it worked great! I even used Xylitol, brand name "Ideal no calorie Sweetner" and it was so good. My two younger children, 9 and 5 love it.

I always make popcorn on the stove because it is SO delicious.  This recipe is a great change from normal popcorn!  My daughter LOVES it.  For variation, I put food coloring in the sugar!  My daughter brought it to school for "Purple Snack" day!

my Ethiopian born children love it when I make this recipe!  They say it reminds them of Ethiopia!  Nothing wrong with a little comfort food.  The only problem I have had is that I can only make two batches(I have seven children!) if I try a third, I need to let the pan cool a bit before I make it.  Otherwise, great!

This was my first time making Kettle Corn.    I wish I had read some of the reviews before making it.  As is, the recipe calls for too much oil.  The popcorn tasted too greasy and oily for my taste.  Next time, I'm going to try using 1/8 c. oil.

Worked like a charm (did the shake/heat thing suggested in other reviews) and tasted great. Even less burned corn than I expected. Will definitely make again!

This was great! My husband and I were trying to find a healthy snack so we even reduced the oil and sugar to 1/8 cup each as some others had suggested. This came out fabulous. We can't wait until our daughter is old enough to enjoy! Thanks for posting!

This was a hit with my insignificant other. She loves kettle corn and I spiced them up by making my own inventions. Cinnamon kettle corn was really good as well!   Next time I will use a little garlic salt.

I tried this in the Presto Microwave Power Pop using 1 Tbsp oil and brown sugar with 1/3 cup pop corn.  I mixed it well before putting it in the popper.  I turned out well but next time I would add a little more sugar.

I just paid $2.87 at the store for a bag of kettle corn that was equal to the portion in this recipe.  Not only is this recipe a money saver but it tastes WONDERFUL!!!  I did heat the oil until one kernal popped then added sugar and kernals.  When it finished popping I added salt to taste and mixed until dry. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!

oh so yummy. I too added a few pinches of salt to the sugar. BE SURE you don't leave this to pop on it's own. I left it on probably 30 seconds too long and had a lot of dark brown spots. the very light brown spots were the best part though. I will never make popcorn any other way now.

Great recipe..I tweaked it a little by adding 1/2 teaspoon salt for an extra kick.

Like others, I burned the first batch because my electric is awful.  Turned it down to like a 6-7 out of 10 so it didn't cook TOO fast. Yum!

Oh my goodness, this is the yummies popcorn ever!  It really does taste like the kettle corn from the fair, if not better!  I followed the tips for the 3 kernel test, as well as 3 seconds on the heat/ 3 seconds off the heat & shaking.  I add the salt in with the sugar so it's evenly dispersed.  I've made about 8 batches this week!!! I tried with brown sugar and didn't like it as much, but still good.

I have made this 3 times now.  It worked perfectly as directed each time.  I like a sweet/salty version, so I added a little salt, twice with the sugar and once after it was popped.  Both worked.

Just made it.  Added some coarse salt (about 1 T.) Next time I might add some more sugar.  I made it in a wok.  Very good!  Plan to do the drop a few kernels in first and then add the whole lot when it's popping time.

Excellent recipe, just what I was looking for, really gets that county fair flavor.  It takes a couple of tries to find the right temperature to make the sugar form a crispy shell, but once you get there, man-oh-man is it delicious!

GREAT KETTLE CORN!!!!  I used the three kernel test and it worked great.  I will make again and again.  I also added a little salt to the sugar.  I like the sweet and salty taste.

This is really good! Definitely follow the "three kernel test" as described by the top reviewers. I would also suggest adding a little salt. Great Saturday night, movie watching snack.

I've never had kettle corn before, but heard good things about it, so I thought I'd try it.   My first attempt was with brown sugar as I was out of white....and it was dreadful.  The next two times I used white sugar and it was phenomonal!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I work part-time in the kettle corn stand at the local baseball stadium.  Our kettle corn is VERY popular with the locals and I have to say that this recipe pretty much duplicates the taste of our kettle corn.  I enjoyed it very much!  Adding butter to the recipe turns it to caramel corn if you let the butter and sugar heat long enough without burning but I prefer this recipe just the way that it is.  Good job!

Delicious! I followed another reviewer's advice and used half butter and half oil. I did the three kernel test with the oil and added the butter along with the sugar and kernels. This added a much better flavor than just the oil alone (I made two batches). Also, I learned (the hard way) that you really have to shake shake shake that pot while its popping or you will end up with toasty kettle corn (not good). I halved this recipe using a smaller pot and the results were fantastic! Enough to share with another (or eat by onesself...),  Thanks for posting this Sue202!

PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT. I've made it three times now. After years of spending $5 on a bag at the farmers market or fair, I can make a nearly identical recipe at home. This is both a blessing and a curse- blessing because I'll be saving $ and having fun making my own kettle corn, but a curse because now I have WAY too easy access to addictive kettle corn ;).  I actually just attempted to make a single serving (using the allrecipes serving calculator)... I can happily report success :)! Just use a smaller pot/lid. Now when I have the craving by myself, I won't have to compulsive gorge a massive bowl!  Also, don't forget to sprinkle salt on at the end!

WOW! My Dad and I are kettle korn fanatics, and THIS stuff is phenomenal! The sugar makes a hard-ish casing around the popped corn creating a delightfully crisp crunch when eating! I followed everyone else's advice and followed the "three kernel rule" as well as the "three second rule" regarding shaking the pot. I've never had it to burn or brown when using these methods!

This is addictive! It is so easy and cheap to make and we love it. Use the 3 kernal test for your oil and use a little salt. My 11 year old wants it everyday and she thinks it's great that something so tasty comes from 4 wholesome ingredients.

All I can say is I'M AN ADDICT!  I found this recipe Friday and since then I've made at least 2 batches EVERY day!  The 3 kernel test is a must, and the 3sec on/3 sec off is a must.  I wait until the popping slows down to about 2 or 3 pops then take it off and whip it into the bowl.  As I watch the brown carameled goo come off the bottom of the pan I quickly dash on sea salt and break the popcorn apart with a fork for easy hand to mouth action.  OMG!  I cannot believe it took me this long to find this recipe.  NO MORE STORE BOUGHT KETTLE CORN!!!

I am certain this would be a great recipe, but for some reason I can't keep the sugar from burning. I followed all advice, including 3 second rule, but it still burns and takes forever to pop. Our family loves kettle corn, guess I'll just keep buying Trader Joes Kettle Corn.

Awesome!  I use my Whirley Pop hand-crank, stove-top popcorn popper.  I add a little salt at the end to give it that salty/sweet taste from our fairs.

Good recipe.  I have had good success with the white sugar method.  The brown sugar method is awful and tastes nothing like caramel corn.  Don't go there.

This recipe really does taste like the kettle corn you get at a fair, festival etc...  Follow the method suggested by the most helpful reviewer - the 3 kernel, and 3 seconds on/off the heat method to avoid scorching.  The only thing I would suggest is cutting back on the oil a bit - the end product was a bit greasy (but that may just be the nature of the beast!)

This stuff is great!  Never had kettle corn before (either they don't sell it here in Canada or we've been living under a rock) but wow is it ever good.  Even my husband who doesn't like popcorn wolfed down a huge bowl.

it was good, but mine burnt and a lot of the kernels didnt pop all the way. I'm going to try adding the sugar after the kernels are about to pop next time and see what happens.

This recipe in it's original form did not turn out very good. I had not tried making kettle corn before.  When your cooking the popcorn on med. and you add the sugar in at the same time the results are burnt sugar popcorn. I did look at the reviews and some were helpful. The ammount of oil was too much and made the popcorn too oily. The popcorn needed to be cooked on med-high so not to burn. The 3 sec. shake and cook works. Also I think it would have been better to add sugar(powdered) after it's done and still in the pot warm, shaking to distribute evenly.  I had to make a few batches before I figured out the right way to make Kettle corn.  Trial and error are the best learning tools.

Needs a touch of salt. And don't let it rest in the pan after it's popped, or it starts to burn! Edit: Somehow my first time making this was the best--I've been burning it ever since lol. Definitely need to use the right ratios--this isn't something that works by just throwing things in the pot!

My son and I really love good kettle corn, so when I saw this recipe I thought "can it really be this easy to make at home?" Well, it was!  We LOVED it and with it being so easy, I am sure we will be enjoying it often!  The only thing I did different, was to add about 1/4 teaspoon salt which really gave it the sweet/salty combination.

This was our first attempt...some of it burned although it still tasted okay. A really fun and tasty way to have popcorn. Thanks for sharing!

Update: Made using white sugar instead of brown. MUCH BETTER!!! Used the 3 kernel test and had no burned pieces. Can't wait to make again!!!

We love this recipe.  You really have to keep shaking the pot to keep the sugar from burning and make sure to dump it as soon as it's finished otherwise the popcorn on the bottom gets a little burned.  Pop it up and grab the kids and eat it under the stars!

Thank you so much for this recipe!! Absolutely yummy kettle corn. Came out perfect on the first try- the hubby and kids were asking for more! I own a Stir Crazy popper(by West Bend). I figured the stirring mechanism would help keep it from burning, and it worked just fine. I did add a little popcorn salt to the sugar and popcorn before adding to the popper...delicious!

This was great and the kids loved it. Don't forget to keep shaking your kettle and sprinkle with salt at the end when it is still warm. Nice change from "regular" popcorn on movie nights!

I've made this a few times and my family inhales it.  It is sooo good.  Only once I burned it and that's when I was trying to use the recommended 3 kernel thing from the other reviews.

This was delicious.  It did get a little burned even though my DH shook it, as suggested by other reviewers, in three second intervals.  We'll keep trying, as it was really good nevertheless.  The salt is a must, and I think my sweet tooth might have enjoyed it even more with a bit more sugar.  :D

I will never pay $8 for a bag of kettle corn again!!! I have made this many times.  A little twist...I had some left over cotton candy floss from a carnival I used it instead of the sugar.  Adds some color and flavor to it.

What an incredible recipe.  I was spending alot of money downtown for fresh kettle corn and decided to try to make it myself.  I couldn't believe how easy this was!  Good idea to add 3 popcorn kernels to the oil before you add the sugar and rest of the kernels.

Wow!  This is a wonderfully simple easy with awesome results.  I cooked mine in a wok and didn't have a single burnt piece and almost every kernal popped.  I'll never do popcorn any other way.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was really yummy.  My kids and I gobbled it down.  I had a bit of problem with it being kind of sticky, though, rather than fluffy like the kettle corn you get at the fair.  Gonna have to experiment with it a bit to get it just right.  Overall, though, it was a really good recipe that we will definitely make again.  Thank you!

I love this recipe. I have made it many times and will make it many more. I only change I make is to add a bit of salt as I like my kettle corn to be sweet and salty. It's so simple and just perfect.

Sooo good! After three tries...the thrid and fourth batches were great. You do have to watch that the oil doesn't get too hot and burn the sugar (like I did). 
And yes it's important to add 2 tsp. of kosher salt right onto the hot popcorn after popping. I'll make this again and again!

We eat kettle corn in Kansas like it's going out of style--it's my favorite!  This recipe was pretty good, but I suggest adding a little salt, and I prefer mine just a tad sweeter.  We have a Stir Crazy popper and I just made ours in that.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! I just made this and I am very impressed with how closely this resembles kettlecorn, even in texture. Once it had all popped, I melted some butter  (a little less than 1/4 cup) and painted it on lightly with a basting brush, tossing often to ensure no sogginess. Delicious.

The popcorn turned out good, but where's the salt? Not to worry, I added my own. Just sprinkled some right on top. I've got enough Kettle Corn to last me a week!
Thanks for the recipe.

My 12 year old daughter loves to make this for movie night. We have a "Whirley Pop" popcorn popper that you crank and it is fast and easy.

This was so easy, and so good!  Being a huge fan of kettle corn I was very pleased with this recipe. Don't forget to add salt at the end, the the 3 second method works amazing!

Awesome recipe! First time was a success!  Remember to keep moving the popcorn as it cools too so that you don't have one big popcorn ball.

This is a hit with my son (and me!).  I tried all the suggestions others gave me, but here is what I did to make it perfect.
1.  I use a whirly pop. Saves clean up and never burns
2.  I do three test kernels, even though whirly pop says not to.
3.  I start on hi (perhaps my flat top electric range is cooler than others), turn it down when it really takes off, and take it off the stove as soon as it gets too full to turn the knob.

Yummy!

I have been making this recipe for years and it's awesome, but today I made some changes and OMG, what term can you use when you improve perfection?

I use the 3 kernel method, use coconut oil, add 1/4 tsp salt to the sugar, and after pouring in the sugar, add about 1/2 tsp vanilla.  After it's done, sprinkle a little salt over it. I use a whirly pop

Followed the 3 second on/off the heat as recommended and used a LARGE pot with a lid. Used the exact measurement for ingredients. At the end, after taking pot off the heat, I stirred with a wooden spoon to get all the good stuff off the bottom of the pan and coat the popcorn- pinch of salt, and it was RAPIDLY consumed in my house- SUPER!!!

I made this last night and my kids and I loved it. They ate every last bit, and that's really something at my house! I followed the other reviewer's tips and added the popcorn after 3 kernals had popped, then added the sugar on to of that. I used my stir crazy popper and it was as easy as could be! We usually have to wait for the county fair to have kettle corn this good!

This stuff is amazing!  And don't even think that you can make one recipe and not finish it all by yourself!  Taste JUST like the fair stuff and was super easy.  Can't believe I pay $7.00 a bag for this stuff when this is a fraction of that.

Works great with a popcorn pan. You won't need as much oil. Add 1/4 tsp. salt immediately after popping & toss.

After finishing a bag from a local amusement park I just had to give this recipe a try. My kids and I think its great and almost exactly like the ones you buy at fairs. I will be making this a lot. I wasn't sure how it would come out on my electric stove so I made it on the side burner of my barbeque. It worked great.

Wow. I was amazed at how easy this recipe was when you use a Stir Crazy. If you are an avid popcorn eater, this is definitely the way to go for a sweetened version. I do think that the kernals pop up smaller than the fair Kettle Corn, but that is okay when you compare price and availability!

I thought this was really good.  The stuff you get at the fair made in the big kettles is a bit better in my opinion, but considering that I could make it on my cooktop in a few minutes I think deserves a tip of the hat.  One secret I learned after the first time I made it is to have your serving bowl at the ready, and dump the contents into it immediately after taking the pot off the burner, or it will burn quickly.

This was a tricky recipe for me - I made 3 batches, and none of them were good enough to serve to my friends. The sugar burned every time, even when I tried the different methods suggested. I'll try it again, but next time I'll keep shaking the pot over the burner.

This is a very simple recipe, but it does take a knack to be able to pop it without burning or browning it. I found, after I pop it, if I drizzle a tiny bit of melted butter (1/2 TBSP), then salt it, it changes it from good to downright excellent!

This was yummy and easy to make, but it didn't taste exactly like fair kettle corn. I'm not sure what ingredient would make the difference? It did taste more authentic after it cooled, though. I used Crisco vegetable oil, Orville R. popcorn, sugar and salt. Maybe next time I'll try butter flavored oil? I've been trying to find coconut oil because I've heard that's great in making movie theater-like popcorn, but haven't found it locally yet. Maybe that would help? I made this recipe in our WhirleyPop and it came out light, crisp and not burned at all.

The only problem with this recipe is that it is highly addicting! I have to admit, the first time I tried making it, I burned it.  The second time, I followed the advice of another reviewer and used my stir crazy.  I added the sugar after the oil started boiling.  I added salt to taste after it was popped.  Absolutely wonderful!

Just made this. It turned out great, but I would add a little more sugar. I added 1 TBS. butter in with the oil. Added the sugar (along with 1/4 tsp salt) right as the corn began to pop. I also added scant dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg... we once asked a guy making kettle corn how he made it and he said there were spices in it, although he wouldn't say what those were. So, this is a good recipe. Quick and easy. This takes less than 10 minutes for start to finish. Thanks!

I love this recipe!!  I make it all the time in my Stir Crazy popcorn popper.  Sometimes I also add 1 teaspoon of Five Spice Powder (Rachel Ray recipe).  I put the oil and 3 kernels in the popcorn popper, when those kernels pop, I add the sugar, 5 Spice Powder, and the rest of the popcorn.  Very yummy!!

This was great!  I added about 1/4 tsp. popcorn salt with the sugar so I got the sweet and salty snack.  I used my Whirley Pop stovetop popper and I'd have to say it's even better than our farmer's market kettle corn.  And I had no idea it was so easy.  But keep those kernels moving...mine burned a little bit on the bottom.  This will be a frequently used recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

I was pretty skeptical reading this recipe.  I love kettle corn and couldn't believe I could replicate it so easily at home.  This is one of those times where I'm very happy to say I was wrong.  Amazing and easy.

I added the sugar and popcorn after a few kernels popped in the warmed oil because of other review comments. make sure to shake often and remove as soon as its done to avoid scorching. Add salt just after removing from the stove. I also added a bit more sugar and it was DELICIOUS!! I have been craving kettle corn constantly since we went to a corn maze and the microwave stuff just doesnt cut it!! this recipe is to die for! :)

VERY YUMMY!!  Used the 3-kernel method as suggested and, the 2nd time, used the butter flavor Criso...very good!!  Also, I popped in dutch oven (enamel coated).  Clean up was easy when I just dumped the corn out, added a little water to the pan & let it simmer a bit.

THANK YOU for sharing this recipe. It's awsome. I just tried kettle corn for the first time at a festival up north and fell in love. I used micro popcorn and peanut oil (all I had in the house at the time) and heated the oil and sugar in a pan and tossed in a bowl with the popcorn. I think the peanut oil added a little 'nutty' flavor to it too. Picked up a few 'tricks' from the other reviews as well, thanks so much!

I didn't know if I could make this turn out but it was awesome!  My husband and I devoured it in about 15 minutes and I can rarely get him to eat popcorn.  I used olive oil because I didn't have any vegetable oil and I used the three kernal test and sprinkled it with salt to taste in the end.  It was so light and delicious!  Wonderful recipe!  Will definately make frequently.  Thanks for the recipe!

I can't believe it's this easy to make Kettle Corn!  I never popped corn on the stove before, but I followed previous reviewers tips and it turned out perfectly.  Making my own is WAY cheaper than buying it!

I tried this recipe last week with brown sugar and I thought it was pretty good.  I think I was looking for something a little sweeter though.  It really could not have been simpler to make.  Thanks Sue!

We love Kettle Corn! But usually only get it at the local fairs. Never thought of making it at home. My wife had just popped some microwave kettle corn and it was awful. Found Sue's recipe here and decided to give it a try. Fantastic on our first attempt. Came sooo close to burning it though. The sugar makes the popping less noisy, and with all the shking going on I didn't realize it was done. Used our "OLD FAITHFUL" popcorn pot but we are going to look at the crank type poppers so many have lauded. Has anyone tried a combo of white and brown sugars? read a lot of the reviews but not all.
You do have to keep it SHAKING! Biceps looking better already! LOL

Using a gas stove, it was difficult to cook the popcorn on medium heat (I usually use high heat for regular popcorn), and not have the sugar slightly burn (I used brown sugar for this recipe). It was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.

After reading many of the reviews I also made some changes to this recipe.  I used the ingredients as suggested by Sue, but put only the oil and 3 kernels in a pot, as suggested by many reviewers.  While that was heating up, I "browned" my sugar in a small non-stick frying pan (melted it).  Once the three kernels popped, I added the melted sugar (which does turn a little brown so don't be surprised) and the rest of the popcorn.  Next time I might try brown sugar for a more caramelly flavour.

It turned out great, and none of it burnt.

tastes good when you dont burn it. I followed recipe exactly- burned. Tried heating oil and kernals first then adding sugar when a few popped as others had suggested and it turned out better- DO NOT STOP SHAKING POT!

This makes delicious kettle corn.  I tried substituting brown sugar for the caramel corn flavor and I didn't like it at all.  Make sure you don't have the heat too high when you are cooking the popcorn or you will end up with a big, stick, burned lump in the bottom of the pan.

I really liked this recipe, but I would definitely reduce the amount of sugar unless you like your popcorn coated in it.  I also added a litlle salt at the end for that salty/sweet combo.  I am about to make up a few more batches adding food coloring to two of them (1 red, 1 green), and then mixing them together and then bagging them up into individual gift bags for Christmas gifts.

When the recipe works it's very good.  It's just very hard to get it right.  DO NOT LET IT GO UNATTENDED!!  I've tried the recipe several times, and if you stop shaking it for more than 3 seconds at a time you have a disaster.  I've always tried popping 3 kernels first and then adding the rest, but maybe I'll try all of them at once.  I usually have to add more oil before I add the rest, though.  Have fun, but be patient!  This is one that takes some practice.

Yummy, yummy.  Just made it for a rainy afternoon snack for my girls. We all munched it down.  We didn't even save any for daddy - just have to make it again for him sometime :). Thanks for the recipe!

Taste just like the county fair! I didn't but the sugar and oil together. I put the oil in first so it could get hot then I add the sugar. Then the corn. I also put a pinch of salt to have that sweet yet salty contrast!

I would never use a teflon pan to make popcorn!  It would totally ruin the teflon coating.  I put the oil in and a few kernels until they popped.  Then quickly added the sugar stirring with a metal spoon and the popcorn.  The secret to this recipe is to have everything measured out and ready to go--working quickly!  I also added a little salt after I poured it into the bowl - yummy!

I tried out a test batch using half a recipe.  I heated up the oil with 2 kernals of corn.  When they popped I added the rest of the corn and the sugar.  I used a T-fal pan and just shook the pan, occasionally lifting it off the burner.  The corn came out great.  I might use a little bit more sugar next time.

I was so excited -- but this recipe was AWFUL. It didn't work AT ALL. Yes the popcorn popped, but it sure doesn't taste good. YUCK.

Wow!  This is incredible popcorn.  My kids still prefer butter and salt, but I think this is what I'll be making for myself from now on.  I can't wait to try it with brown sugar!!!

The tricky part is to get all of the popcorn to pop, and not burn it up in the process. I think the temperature is critical, on an electric range.
you'll just have to experiment with it. My first batch came out great, while the second batch burnt. The first batch tasted very good. I added salt to the finished product.

This is pretty close to the real thing, I have to say.  I did use turbinado (raw) sugar instead of white, and added a little bit of salt for a true authentic taste.  It's not messy in the least,  but you do have to use a fairly large covered saucepan for it to work.  Thanks, Sue!!!!

This was great - I love the kettle corn at fairs, but the microwave stuff that's out now is a poor imitation.  This was easy, fast, and as good Oor better, in my dh's opinion!) as the fair kettle corn.  You have to add salt, though! Will make again and again. Thanks!

I loved this popcorn!  I was a little skeptical at first but it turned out great.  It tastes just like the kettle corn I've had at fairs, especially when I added a little salt after the popcorn popped.  I can't wait to make it again!  It's so much better than that new microwave kettle corn!

Don't let the reviews deter you from trying this recipe.  I used 6 TBSP. of oil instead of four and I also sprinkle the finished popcorn with a little salt for a sweet and salty kick.  My family loves it!

This is a really good recipe.  If you have a stir crazy popper be sure to use it.  I think that may be the trick.  Instead of white sugar, I used Sugar in the Raw turbano sugar.  It made a really nice glaze.

This is GREAT!  I was just "browsing" the recipes when I ran across this one.  Decided to try it and was glad I did.  I used 2/3 cup popcorn and kept the oil and sugar measurements the same.  I also used my Stir Crazy popper and first heated the oil, then added the corn and sugar and shook the popper while it was popping.  When it was done, I gave it a sprinkling of salt.  The result was a wonderful snack that wasn't too sweet or too salty!  My husband and 4-year old loved it, too.  Only trouble was, I used the last of my popcorn on the first batch and everyone was asking for more -- looks like I need to make a trip to the store!  This will become a standard at our house.  Thanks!

This was great!  Very easy very very tasty and way too addictive.  It will be hard to eat plain popcorn again.  I did take the advice in previous comments and added the sugar on top of the popcorn, but I had no problems.  I added no stick spray first, since my pot has an enamel finish.

My husband absolutely loves kettle corn, so when I saw this recipe I just had to try it, it is a fantastic recipe!!  It was really quick and easy to make, I used a non-stick 3 1/2 quart pan and had no problems at all.  I will definitely be making this over and over again!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, my husband loves it (and so do I!)!!!!

Great recipe.  Made it in smooth top electic stove with a non-stick pan.  Poured 1/4 cup oil in the pan.  Let it heat up on just above medium heat.  Then put in the 1/2 cup of popcorn and then the 1/4 cup sugar.  Shook it around and then wait for it to start popping.  Once it started poping, i would shake for about 5 seconds, let it sit on burner 5 seconds, shake 5 secs, sit 5 secs, over and over until it was done popping.  There is going to be some smoke, and prepare to make a mess your first couple times, but my first 2 batches turned out great.  Never new it was this easy to make Kettle Corn.  Thanks Sue!!!

This was a great recipe.  I added the oil, sugar and popcorn all at the same time and shook it until it was done and it was absolutely fabulous.  Don't give up if you don't get it right the first time. I was barely able to get any away from my husband.  Gotta go make some more, Thanks Sue for a great recipe.

Good-bye, microwave popcorn.  Good-bye, air-popper.  This is awesome stuff and amazingly easy to make.  I just threw everything in a stir-fry pan, covered it, and waited for the popcorn to start popping.  While it was popping, I shook the pan every now and then, but not constantly.  Turned out wonderfully.  Thanks, Sue!

I had my first taste of kettle corn a couple of weekends ago at a local fair and I was hooked! I just made a batch and it was easy, quick and delicious! I used an old Faberware stainless pot and had no problems at all.
Thanks for a great and delicious recipe!

WONDERFUL.  I actually had just brought a bag home from the fair today. So I made this recipe and compared both side by side.  With a shake of salt...this recipe tasted exactly like the corn I purchased at the fair. I made it in a stainless steel pan with a tight-fitting lid.  I had no problems what so ever.  Very easy and delicious

I went to a fair and tried kettle corn for the first time.  I was hooked. I am glad I found this recipe. I have made it twice since yesterday.  It worked great for me, but you have to take it off the stove quickly so as not to burn the popcorn.  My family loved it too!

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I kept the heat at medium and used a non-stick pan and it came out TERRIFIC!  The hardest part of the recipe is the waiting!  I ate a piece while it was still hot, and really have to say that the flavor got better as it cooled.  I would definitely make this recipe again - no more waiting for the fair or paying outrageous prices from the vendors!  Thanks!!!

we heeded the warnings about cooking it on medium heat and we continually shook the pan as the popcorn was popping - this allowed us to avoid burning the corn. however, we found that there was too little sugary coating for our taste, and it was a little too dry. we may add a touch more oil and sugar next time. overall, delicious!

I told my husband I was going to find a recipe for kettle corn on the internet.  He said, "Yeah, right.".  After reading all the reviews, I admit I was a little leery about trying it (I hate it when the smoke detector goes off when I'm cooking.) but I did, and it turned out perfect the first time!  My husband and my six kids were delighted.  Thanks, Sue.

I bought a stir crazy popcorn popper for making this kettle corn.  I put in the oil and then the sugar until the sugar begins to melt.  Then I add the popcorn and the machine does the work and I end up with the highly addictive kettle corn!  It is fabulous and the only way to eat it is fresh.  It disappears within minutes at my house.  Much thanks to Sue for submitting this recipe!

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  Now I don't have to wait to go to festivals to get kettle corn.  I read the other reviews first and kept the heat down on medium,and shook the pan constantly.  I also added a 1/4 cup more corn than called for since it seemed like a bit too much oil.  It turned out perfect!  We'll have this often.

This recipe was SO easy and SO quick.  I loved it.  I would have thought that making good kettle corn would be painstakingly hard, but it wasn't and it was a good (if not better) than storebought!  Thank you Sue (the recipe submitter), and www.AllRecipies.com!

I thought that the recipe was fairly easy to make.  What I did not like was that it had a greasy taste and that overpowered the sugary taste.  I did follow the recipe exactly and I did use Crisco oil.  I retried the recipe using only 3 TBS of oil and 1/2 cup of sugar.  Worked better.  I did make the recipe in a plain pan on the stove top and it did work fine but you do need to remember - medium heat and shake the pan often, otherwise it will burn.

I made this on an electric stove and it turned out great the first time and then the second batch burned on the bottom.  I then tried again the next day and realized that if I heat up the oil on medium heat, add the corn and then put the sugar over the corn. It works great.  You have to shake the pot real well though.  Not from side to side, like with Jiffy Pop, but kind of pop it up every 15 seconds or so... I put a dishcloth on the lid and held it with handles to keep the lid on while I "popped" it.  Also, you have to take it out of the pot AS SOON as the kernels slow down or it will burn.  If your family likes the taste, it is well worth the effort.

I noticed a user said this was a failure.  I tried it in a regular pot without success.  BUT .. if you use  a stir crazy electric popcorn popper (one with a stirrer) and also used a stovetop whirley pop popcorn pan (the type with a handle & a hand crank to keep the popcorn moving).  Our friends and family LOVE this stuff & CAN't get enough!  I added more sugar for the stovetop method.

It’s pretty good I added 2 tbsp to the sugar and it was good but in my opinion it doesn’t have enough sugar in it.

OMGoodness!!  No more waiting for the local fairs to come when I can make this to my hearts content!  I asked for a popcorn popper that has the bar on it that scrapes the bottom so I don't need to worry about burning/shaking ... just need to concentrate on the CONSUMING of this!  Thanks for the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing.  (I'm so full now!)

Really happy with these instructions. I never thought about making my own kettle corn before, but this was delicious. You do have to be careful not to burn the sugar, but just keep the temp at medium and keep shaking, and don't let it sit for long waiting for the last kernels to pop. Get it right in the bowl! I sometimes have a handful of brown popcorn, but only to be expected and not a problem in my eyes. Enjoy! :)

Definitely needs salt. Maybe something else too since vegetable oil doesn't have a very pleasant taste.  Ghee or clarified butter  (emphasis on clarified) would give the popcorn a more pleasant taste and still has a high enough smoke point not to burn. Don't add the sugar too early or it will burn.

Love this!  No need to make any changes.  Using the recommended 3 pieces of popcorn/3 second/3 second method  is definitely the way to go.

I have been making this for several years after reading this recipe.  I use an old Stir Crazy.  To make it very easy, I have the corn, salt and sugar measured and mixed together in a small bowl.  Once a couple kernels pop, I pour it in the Stir Crazy.  When it starts popping, I gently shake it back and forth and turn it over when the popping stops.  AMAZING popcorn!  For cleanup, Immediately after turning the base, I spray the cooking surface with my sink hand sprayer  - and the bowl washes easily.    This is better than the fair!  thanks so much for posting!

I don't know why I didn't look this recipe up sooner.  My husband and I love kettle corn and always have to wait for a carnival or fair to make a special trip to get some.  Not anymore!  This recipe is excellent.  I did the "three kernel" method with the oil, added the sugar and popcorn and was in business.  I also added a little salt because the combination of salt and sweet is what I love about kettle corn.  This was the first time I made it and it was good, but not perfect.  That was my fault, not the recipe's.  Be sure to really combine the sugar and the oil before adding the popcorn.  Take the pot off the heat if you need to while doing this so that the sugar doesn't burn.  I had a sizable clump of sugar in the batch and my popcorn wasn't as sweet as it should have been.  I'm sure next time it will be perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

State Fair Popcorn, I swear! So great! Follow recommendations of heating oil and three kernels in the oil! Then when they pop, add the rest of the popcorn and sugar! Then do the 3-second shake and pause! Love this! Date night snack for my hubby and I when kids are at parents or when they're in bed!

Delicious! I added the salt that Maggie had recommended below. Instead of Vegetable Oil, I used Grapeseed Oil - which always works better for me. Done in a Cast Iron Dutch Oven...perfection. A Yummy quick treat, just make sure you shake shake shake - I’ve ruined it a few times by not shaking enough!

Great recipe,  I add salt at the end.  By the way, I never shake popcorn, I cook on high.  The trick is to take it out of hit pot right away.

I melted over simmer a full square of almond bark and poured it and stirred over half of the popped corn, made just like the recipe (I used Canola oil). Turned out fantastic!!

yes and it was perfect. So good and I love it. Hint: don't use a cast iron pot, you do have to move it to a bowl quickly. Cast holds heat and is heavy to maneuver.

Just made it for the 1st time, came out perfect! I eyeballed the amounts. No burning & easy clean up. No need to buy microwave kettle corn & chemicals! 

My tips: 

1. I don't think the 3 tester kernels are necessary unless you really don't know when your pot is hot. For me, it was just extra work to go fish them out. 

2. Keep the pot moving mostly, to avoid burning & ruining the whole thing. I stopped it sometimes but just not for very long.

3. Use a convenient or ergonomic lid. I used a big frying pan as a lid & the handle just made it easier shake & hold. A regular lid would have made me crabby.

4. Safety - resist the urge to peek! My urge was strong & I peeked right when a hot oily sugary kernel shot at my face & STUCK to my wooden spoon.  DO NOT MESS WITH BOILING SUGAR! It's not worth it. Just don't.

BONUS related tip: you can microwave popcorn using only a paper bag! Just add popcorn kernels, fold the top a couple times & zap. I then like to melt butter & add salt. 2ND BONUS related tip: use the bags from fast food meals. It's green to re-use & you will realize you eat more fast food than you thought.

This recipe is so good to have in the snack arsenal.  I have used it as much for technique in popping corn as well as for the sweet/salty no butter goodness.  I have adjusted the recipe to my taste.  I use only enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot, once the 3 kernels pop, I add only enough pop corn to cover the bottom of the pot in a single layer, then I sprinkle about 2 or 3 Tbsps of sugar over the corn.  I let it heat up a few seconds and start shaking the pot.  I also control the heat better by removing the pot from the direct heat occasionally to keep it from possibly burning and I lift the lid up slightly to release some of the moisture so it pops fluffier.  I salt the corn as I put it into the bowl a little at a time.  I love it because it doesn't need additional butter so it remains crisp and there's no worry about greasy hands !

Really good and easy. I added a bit of salt at the beginning. Next time might do brown sugar for a little more flavor.

Perfect! I read the reviews and used the three kernel test. I also added 1/4 tsp of salt to the sugar. So easy to remember and make! I will be making it again. Thanks!

I can tolerate it, but it wasn’t nearly sugary enough. i would use a third or a half cup instead of a fourth. my kernels are barely coated.

I tested the oil with three kernels as recommended. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I shook off the burner for three seconds then back on the burner for three until the popping slowed down. Sprinkled in some salt at the end and viola! It was absolutely delicious.

Switch the sugar addition until after all the popcorn is added....this provides a heat sink so the sugar won't burn... this made a good recipe perfect.

I followed the directions except substituted butter-flavored shortening for the oil. The popcorn popped up quickly and beautifully - no burns. I simply did not love this. It was really bland. It barely tasted any different than plain popcorn. I think it would probably benefit from more sugar plus some salt. I may try again at some point.

I followed the suggestion to let three kernals pop in the oil before adding the sugar.  I then added the popcorn.  It was just right (stirring often to prevent  burning).  TIP:  a friend turned me onto a popcorn called "mushroom" popcorn.  I haven't see in mainline stores; had to get it at a kitchen supply.  EVERY kernal pops with a giant mushroom shaped plume of crunchy, airy goodness.  Seek it out if you can.

Fast, reliable, and tasty!  Last time I used "cold pressed and unrefined" coconut oil, instead of vegetable oil, and it seemed to really give it an even better flavor.  I'd recommend trying the coconut oil if you have it!

Made this exactly as posted, we loved it!  THEN...I made it by simply throwing everything in the pan at the same time - STILL came our great!  FINALLY, I took the advice of one of the other reviewer's and made it in "single serving" size...Holey bologna cakes batman, I'm in heaven!  We enjoy both the white sugar and brown sugar versions, and this is fast becoming our favorite after dinner treat recipe!!

the key must be to be able to keep the sugar from burning. I have no idea how to do that. My arms are wore from the shaking of the pan. yet it still burned. please do not take this as a negative review. I will find a way to correct this problem. no to address the burnt sugar in the bottom of the pan.

I give it 5 stars.
It's definitely tasty. 
BUT...I'm still looking for the popcorn my Nana used to make. It had a thicker sugar coating. She'd make a recipe with white sugar and another using bright red food coloring then mix the two batches together. 
OMG what a memory, I can still taste it !

Great recipe! The popcorn is delicious, however, It is a tiny sweet to my liking so next time I’ll use less sugar. As suggested, I placed 3 kernel in  the pot with the oil. One those started popping, I poured the remaining kernels and sugar in and gave it a stir. As the popcorn popped, I rotated with the three seconds pop, shake, pop, shake. When finished, remove from heat and poor salt on immediately and stir until popcorn seperate from one another.

Oh oh oh sooooo good! The only thing I would say is change it too a half cup of sugar because it’s light on sugar. And use the three kernel test. Heat your oil on medium high instead of medium, add three kernels, once they pop, take the pan of the heat and add the kernels and sugar, mix with spatula together then add back on heat and shake constantly.

I love kettle corn but with my allergies I'm afraid to buy it prepackaged so finding this recipe was great! I made it following the directions and found it too oily. So I reduced the oil to just enough to cover most of the nonstick pot. Added popcorn and sugar together at the same time. Followed the three second rule and it's the best kettle corn I've ever had, save for the stuff at TRF. Will keep this forever. Thanks!

I love this recipe, simple and we have popcorn stirring pot,  very quick.   Takes a minute to start, but when it does.. it's done in 30 seconds.  1/4 C fills our pot.  To make it healthier, we use sunflower oil, or coconut oil.

It was good but as other people have mentioned, the sugar just burns. Some of the popped corn on the bottom gets burnt. Tasty though but wouldn't recommend.

I will not make this recipe again it was AWFUL. Instead i found my own way of making it without dirtying any dishes or scrubbing off that crud at the bottom after making it. I put 1/4 cup un-popped kernels  in a brown paper bag then put popcorn oil and sugar on top and microwaved it till it stopped popping and topped it with a little extra sugar. WAY better than this recipe.

Great, simple kettle corn recipe. 
Tip: Make sure you leave it on medium heat like the recipe says. I mistakingly lowered the heat, and the kernels popped too slowly and ended up burning. Like other reviewers said, the 3 second on-and-off tip also helps to prevent burning.

This was excellent! I followed other suggestions and cooked for 3 seconds, then shook for 3 seconds. This was an afternoon snack for myself and my kids and, I think if I had let my son lick the bowl, he would have. I did add a small sprinkle of salt when it was all done and shook it one final time. Absolutely addicting!

It is easy to make and delicious, but I have a caution.  Be very careful  when removing the popcorn from the pan as the sugar is extremely hot.  I got a burn on one of my fingers.  Best to use a spatula.  Also, shaking the pan did some damage to my smooth top range.  I'm considering getting a whirly pop pan to make it in the future.

Really good. First time I made it it tasted a little flat. So I added a teaspoon of fine table salt to the kernels and sugar before popping.  It tasted much better. But I really like salt. So adjust accordingly.

This is wonderful and it makes a lot. I heated the oil with 3 kernels in it, and when they popped I poured in the sugar and  popcorn, stirred it up quick, put on the lid and started shaking the pot. I let the pot sit for 3 seconds, then shook it 3 seconds off the burner, but after doing this a few times I just put the pot on the burner and shook continually. When the popping slowed, I lifted the lid and the pot was full to the top. Not one kernel was burnt, and there were only a few unpeopled kernels.  I transferred it to a bowl adding salt every now and then. When I ate it I felt it needed more salt so I added more but the popcorn at the bottom of the bowl was much too salty. I think next time, and there will be a next time, I will add 1/2 tsp. of salt in with the sugar and kernels and I think that may distribute the salt more evenly and moderately. I think the whole process took less than 10 minutes from start to finish, and only 1-2 minutes to pop. It was not difficult to clean up either, with any sticky sugar melting in the hot soapy water. This is much better than pop-in-bag microwave kettle corn from the grocery store!

This popcorn delight is so easy even a husband can do it! Great snack to make for a movie night. Make sure to stir or shake continuously or the sugar will burn. Excellent recipe, thanks for the share!

This was awesome! Inexpensive but slightly decadent! Loved that there weren't the chemicals like in packaged kettle corn. It does take a bit longer to pop...I got a little worried...but it was worth the wait!

I read the reviews and followed their instructions of putting 3 kernels in the pot and waiting until they pop to add the sugar and rest of the popcorn kernels. This turned out perfectly. It is rather sweet, so be aware that adding the sugar does indeed give you sweet popcorn, which is exactly what kettle corn is :)

Delicious every time, and really easy to make.  No need to alter the recipe at all.  I always have to make more than one batch though.

This is such a great recipe because it's simple and I always have these ingredients on hand. I have made this a couple of times now and the last time I added a little more sugar by accident and it worked to my advantage. Just about a tablespoon more makes it slightly crunchier when the mixture cools on the popped corn. I also add salt to the mixture to taste while it's cooling in the bowl. Sometimes my kids like to add colored sugar sprinkles or "fairy dust" on top.

This is a five star recipe with cooking technique updates. I made this following Krystenl's recommendations  and it is amazing. I used coconut oil and a little bit of turbinado sugar mixed in with the white.

I just popped a bag of popcorn, melted desired butter (about 1/5th of a cup) and dissolved 2 tablespoons of sugar into the butter. Finally I tossed the mixture with the popcorn. Simple. Delicious.

The first time I tried this, the sugar burned a little along with some of the popcorn. I recommend adding the sugar a couple minutes after adding the popcorn kernels. Also if you like the sweet and salty, sprinkle some salt over the popcorn while it's still warm and it will really give that kettle corn flavor.

I made 3 batches.  The first 2 came out so perfectly that  I got a little cocky with the 3rd batch and didn't shake it as much and it burned a bit.  The key is to shake it constantly.   Delish!

Omg!  I made it for the 1st time today & my boys & I devoured it in no time!  I will have to make another batch for my husband when he gets home from work!  This recipe is so easy & quick.  I did everything others suggested:  used a heavy bottom stock pot, 3 kernel test, shaking alternating with heating on the stove.  I added 1/4 salt as someone suggested as we like the salty & sweet combo & it was just the right amount of salty & sweet.  I love that I can make this at home without any other additives.

Pretty good for the first try!! I did the 3 kernel test but it didn't seem to matter when I poured in the sugar and kernels afterwards. It took a bit to heat up again it seemed. I used the butter flavored shortening as another reviewer did and liked the buttery flavor addition! I didn't burn it but the sugar did turn brown during the process. I added 1 tsp of salt in with it but it needed more. Hubby loved it, I will definitely make again!

Loved loved loved it!  Definitely be sure to add the sugar after the oil has heated enough (the 3 kernel test), otherwise it'll taste burned (my mistake the first time I made it).  But oh my goodness this was good!  I also sprinkled a little salt for the salty sweet effect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't generally care for popcorn, but I've been getting the odd craving lately and this did not disappoint. I did the kernal test and stirred in the sugar until it melted before adding the rest of the kernals. I poured the kettle corn into a bowl, gave it a quick shake to seperate any unpopped kernals, and added a pinch of salt. Next time I'll probablly toss in a little garlic salt to suit my personal peferance  or add a dash of vanilla if I'm in the mood for something sweeter.

I used white sugar and it was good but I don't know that I would make it again.  I don't know if I thought kettle corn was salty and sweet or if this just didn't taste as I was wishing.

Delicious. I had a late night craving for popcorn and this did the job. I used a deep pan and kept the top on during the popping
Changes I made: Used butter instead of vegetable oil (past experience turned me off of vegetable oil...soggy and flavorless). 
Kept the sugar the same, but added a couple tablespoons of sugar and salt after the popcorn was done popping. Definitely keep shaking the popcorn while it was popping. Still there were some burnt pieces but the overall result was golden and delicious.

Last step, add salt!!!!! Nothing like salty sweet kettle corn.  Remove from the hot pot as quickly as you can and watch out for rogue popping kernels. Very very good recipe.

this is my go to popcorn recipe now. I usually use coconut oil and have used white sugar, Brown sugar, and raw turbinado sugar, (not simultaneously) and all three have come out delicious!

Wouldn't make it again. Made more of a mess to clean up and it burned about 1/3 of the popcorn. Thought I would try something a little different that hot air popped corn, but I am now satisfied to stick with the hot air popcorn.

This one is a keeper. Just make sure that like some other  reviewers have warned, remove from heat as soon as the popping slows down. I kept shaking it for a few extra seconds to make sure all the kernels popped and it burned on the bottom a bit. The rest of it turned out great, though.

Very good except it needs just a sprinkle of salt after you cook it to enhance the flavor. Trust me! I used coconut oil to make it healthier and it gave it a yummy buttery taste. But do not used coconut palm sugar like I did once because it seemed to burn much quicker than white sugar.

Wow!  This is the real deal alright.  Saving money for a really good treat is just awesome!  I cut it in half because I wanted to make sure it worked :)  I did the 3 kernels in oil to make sure temp was right for sugar to dissolve & corn to pop.  I used medium heat setting for my stove & the sugar got very caramelized & it was similar to caramel corn & it was delicious!  I guess if I didn't want it quite that caramelized, I would need to lower the heat setting.  I will definitely be making this again & again!  Thanks for a GREAT RECIPE!!

Followed other reviewer suggestions.  At the point of adding 1/2 cup popcorn, I added 1/8 cup confectioner's sugar, 1/8 cup light brown sugar, and a healthy amount of freshly ground Himalayan pink salt.  Shake well, return to heat, using 3 second interval s of shaking and heating on the stove - 3 seconds on, 3 seconds of shaking, etc. When popping slows, remove from heat and place in a bowl.   I melted 3 Tbsp of salted butter and poured over the popcorn, stirring well.

I found this same recipe in a different cookbook. I have used it many times, and also used it with brown sugar. Shaking the pan is very, very, very  important. Try to shake the pan a few, like 2-3 inches away from the heat source, so that the popcorn still pops, but the sugar doesn't burn.   Also, if you have a large, deep pot with two handles.....it would be excellent.

Wonderful!  Only complaint is how addicting it is!  I followed other's suggestion to put 3 kernels in oil until they pop then added the rest plus the sugar.

Not a fan.  I might try it again,  but not sure.  I used brown sugar instead of regular sugar and the popcorn had a real bitter taste.

SUCCESS! This is the reason I love this website. Followed the recipe as is. The 3 kernel test is key to make sure the oil is hot enough. Also, although it's a lot of work, make sure you follow the rule of having the pot in the stove for 2-3 seconds then taking it off to shake it so the sugar doesn't burn.  Enjoy!

Perfect the first try. I was hesitant after reading some of the failures reviews.  I tried Orville butter flavor oil and used a gas stove.  Don't know if it will make a difference once I use an electric stove.  Once done I added some sea salt.

Made this in a pinch for a concession stand for my daughters softball game....needless to say there is nothing left of an entire container of corn popped.  I used the kernel trick to ensure everything was ready to go, added the corn and then added the sugar....it helps so that the sugar does not burn or separate during the process. LOVE IT! BTW: my husband doesn't like kettle corn from the fair but loves this stuff! :)

Raining outside and on couch with my husband eating this now.  Tasty and easy to make. Only mildly sweet.  Could use a little salt.  But I took care of the salt part and we have both enjoyed.  Glad I read the comments on shaking.  I kept pot above heat and shook afraid it might burn or scorch...but it did perfectly fine.  VERY good snack!

Fantastic, delicious and easy!! Burns quickly so do not stop shaking and remove from heat ASAP. For a few cents you get same results from $5 bags at Fair

Super simple yet still requires a leaning curve. Once it starts really popping its important to shake it vigorously to avoid burning.  It took a few try's to perfect method & flavor but totally worth it

This popcorn is addictive!  It came out perfectly. One negative-my glass cooktop is scratched from all the shaking!  Any suggestions to avoid scratching glass top surfaces?? I will keep making it though. It's too delicious not to!

I saw this and I just had to try it and it was a success when I sprinkled some salt while I was pouring the finished popcorn into a bowl. My grandmother loved it and I can't wait to make it again.

I have a stovetop stainless steel hand-crank pot, and this recipe came out perfectly. However, as with many of the most popular recipes on Allrecipes, it was WAY too sweet, even with half the sugar. I think Americans have gotten used to everything being twice as sweet as it used to be. I did not think it was like fair kettle corn at all. Too, I only used two tablespoons of oil and I thought it was too oily. Will use only one tablespoon as I usually do, with 1/4 sugar, next time.

Great recipe!  Super easy, too!  The key to success is CONSTANT MOVEMENT of the pot.  Otherwise sugar WILL STICK AND BURN!!!! I also sprinkled kosher salt a few times, while popping and shaking.  A little goes a long way....CAREFUL!  A really delicious, crunchy treat!

This is really tasty!  I used a le crueset stock pot and olive oil (not extra virgin) and brown sugar (because I was out if white).   I have a propane stove so it runs really hot.  I added oil and three kernels but when they started sizzling I added the rest of the kernels and swirled so they were all coated in oil.  When all the kernels started sizzling I added the brown sugar and put the lud on and swirled the pan vigorously ever 3 seconds for about 3-5 seconds.  Turned out perfect.  Pour popped corn into a bowl immediately because it will burn from the heat of the pan.  I sprinkled with salt, super tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

As a fall variation, I combined the brown and white sugar to still get the 1/4c I needed. When it was finished, I transferred it to a cookie sheet to cool but added pumpkin spice to it. My next one will be in white sugar, topped with cocoa powder and add mini marshmallows after it completely cools. There are so many ways to enjoy this!

I've used this recipe many times before and it's the best.Then I tried it again and the substitution I made is I use a about 2-3 tblsp of the popcorn oil and seasoning bar. If you happen to have a whirly pop it comes out even better it's delicious!!.

Wow this was amazing! I added a little salt, and followed a previous reviewer's advice to follow the 3 seconds on the burner, 3 seconds shaking rule and it didn't burn at all. Thanks for the recipe!

Our new favourite snack! I've made this about 10 times now. The popcorn would burn until I read about the 3-second rule (3 seconds of shaking, 3 seconds of rest, etc.) and now not a single kernel is burned. Delicious!!

I don't know if it was due to the pan I used but the sugar burned before half of the kernals popped. I tried it with a lower heat and the same thing happened.  I may try it with a different pan because so many other people had success.

Couldn't quite get it right. Followed the instructions and also modified as some of the reviews suggested. This is just not what I was looking for. And I made at least 4 batches. Sorry

Amazing! I mean how can you go wrong? Personally, I like to add a sprinkle of salt to my kettle corn for that sweet and salty taste.

Very easy and very good.  I might try a little less oil next time, we could taste it a little bit.

I thought this was a good recipe. I think that it will be one of my favorites. I used a butter flavored popcorn oil and it was excellent. It had just the right amount of sugar.

Not terrible, but doesn't taste at all like the corn you can get at the state fair. The oil gives it an off taste.

I've made this several times now and love it! Hubby (who doesn't like kettle corn) devours this with me! So easy to make. Used others suggested 3 kernel & 3 second shake routine. I also put it in glass bowl to serve/cool rather than plastic as it is very hot from the sugar.

Tried this last night. Before I was always waiting for the country fair or the farmer's markets to show up and get it there.  Then, it was the packaged stuff from Costco's.  This homemade recipe has the proportions down pat, to a T.  Worked perfectly the very first time.

Hints: use a big wok or a huge double boiler pot. Shake or constantly move the wok or pot during popping; do not stop moving it. Do not second guess when the last kernels are popping. Better to remove from heat earlier than later to prevent burnt popcorns. Remove popcorn from wok or pot and immediately transfer to a serving bowl.  Salt gererously.  

Using mushroom popcorn gives that perfect round country fair popcorn look.  But regular high quality fresh popping corn is just as good. I used a new jar of Orvilles. 

The popcorn clumps a bit due to the sticky sugar, but it is easily de-clumped by crumbling it with your hands. 

Going to try again tonight.

This was great. I used my pampered chef pot and easy clean-up. Also this looses it's crunchy-ness pretty fast, so eat fast. I will add more sugar (1/3 cup) next time.

The 1st try didn't succeed.  I thought to make it have buttery flavor, I used about 3 tbsp of butter instead of oil and add the sugars and salt to the melting butter and pop in 3 kernels.  The kernels didn't pop at all, I was tired shaking it so as not to brown the sugar.  But, since it took so long, it was brown anyway.  Maybe the butter can't get as hot as the oil?

2nd try I followed the directions, as others said, add the sugars and salt to the hot oil and pop in 3 kernels. 2 kernels popped, so I added in all the other kernels.  They wouldn't pop either.  I didn't time it but it took a long time too and I was shaking it the entire time. The sugar turned dark brown, but I didn't want to give up.  I thought maybe i didn't use the regular popcorn packages, but buy by the pound or that it didn't stay long enough on the burner.  So I left it longer on the burner and they did pop, but it tasted bitter.

I was determine to eat the popcorn; I had 1/4 cup of kernels left (1/2 the recipe), so I tried again.  This time heating 1Tbsp of oil, then put in all the kernels.  Waited for some to pop, then add in mixture of white and brown sugar.  Keep stirring til all the sugar melted, then closed the lid and 3-sec on and off the burner (shaking). It took about 8 minutes from the time I put in the kernels to popping.  After it was done, I sprinkled some salt on it.  Finally, it was a success! Tastes great.

My advice to you who tried and failed, try my last method and you should succeed.

I am not a fan of popcorn...but kettle corn is a different thing. This was so easy and perfect the first time I made it. My daughter buys kettle corn every week and pays $6 a bag(which makes her quite reluctant to share). When she tries this, I will quickly become her favorite person in the world. Method: 3 kernel pop test in 1/2 reg, 1/2 butter flavored oil, added popcorn, then sugar, shake 3 secs., rest 3 secs. Poured in a large bowl and lightly salted it. Yummers.

Very nice recipe. On an electric stove, this requires a careful eye and patience. Do NOT walk away, even for a second. Shake constantly, and remove from heat the INSTANT you hear popping slow down. Pour into an awaiting bowl immediately after removing from heat to prevent after burning (but be careful). You really have to add salt to taste. The sweet and salt is the best part about kettle corn.  My kids absolutely devoured this.

I use this recipe all the time. Everybody loves it and whenever I buy kettle corn at fairs or other functions I am always disappointed because this is better. I do put a little salt in when I add the popcorn. I use pop secret jumbo corn mostly and always do the 3 kernel test.

Yummy!  I burned the first batch due to eating only microwave popcorn for so long and forgetting how fast this pops.  I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.   There was some splattering but I used a stockpot so it was o.k.  I think a skillet will be easier to manage next time.  My kid loves it!  I like the review that suggested adding some salt along with the sugar and will try that next time.   Thanks for the recipe!   I did not know kettle corn was just white sugar, figured you need corn syrup or something.   Excellent!

Excellent!  We used unrefined coconut oil and it made a sweet, coconut and caramel flavored glaze.  A pinch of salt made this popcorn so extraordinary my girlfriend blurted out between bites: "This is the best thing I have ever eaten!  Period."

So so so yummy! I've made this 3 times now and every time it is wonderful! I too alternate shaking and letting it rest on the burner for a moment. This last time, I tried coconut oil (healthier than vegetable or canola) and it added just a hint of sweet coconut flavor that really worked. I also used half white sugar and half brown. Mmmm... the batch went quickly.

After following the suggestions of the tried and tested 3 kernel pop method it was perfect with a dusting of salt.  Tonight I made it again but with coconut oil and WOW.... End of story.

I have had my hits and misses with this.  I have scorched it, lightly overdone it and cooked it to perfection. I don't like it with all white sugar and prefer 1/2 evaporated cane sugar (Rapadura) and 1/2 organic sugar.  I have also tried it with canola, corn, grape seed, vegetable and coconut oils. Hands down by far, the best (tasting and cooked) was prepared using the coconut oil...who knew? Now I do...amazing.

My first attempt at making the kettle corn and it was pretty good. I think my corn may be old as a lot of the kernels didn't pop. But I think over all, it's a keeper. I too did the 3 kernel test and it worked!

Great recipe! I've only burnt it twice in the many times I've made it haha so thumbs up ;). My brothers love going to the Farmer's Market for kettle corn and this tastes just like it! Thank you for the wonderful recipe to remind me of Farmer's Market days :).

So good.  So easy.  There was a moment there when I put in the sugar and it kind of solidified to my spoon that I stirred it with that I thought it would be a disaster.  Lo and behold, it came out perfect, only a few unpopped kernels left.  I did sprinkle and toss with salt at the end.  Just like the stuff at Farmer's Market!

This is delicious! I didn't have any vegetable oil on hand, so I used 1/4 cup canola oil with some salt added. I used 1/3 cup of sugar because I wanted mine extra sweet. I don't know if it is because of my changes, but it took a little longer to pop than it does without sugar, so don't worry if it isn't popping right away! The sugar forms a crispy crust on the popcorn. Yum.

I made this last night not expecting much.  I already pop corn in a pan on the stove with crisco - so I didnt think just adding sugar would make it like fair kettle corn.  Why did I not think of this years ago???  It really did taste good.  I over cooked mine just a smidge because I wasnt ready for it.  Have your bowl ready and shake, shake, shake that pan til it is popped.  I put a bit of salt on after it was cooked.

I read some reviews that made me scared to try this recipe. This stuff is absolutely excellent!!! So quick and easy. Follow the directions and it will turn out perfect. I added a little extra oil and sugar just cause I like the extra topping. If you like kettle corn from the fair, this recipe will not disappoint!

So easy and delicious! Just like what we get at the farmer's market. We'll never get microwavable popcorn ever again. We used the three-second-on-three-second-off method as one reviewer suggested and came out with fabulous results. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good.  Used my "Whirley Pop" which has a built in stirring arm which made it easy to mix the sugar in and not get burnt.  I'm sharing it with my kettle corn fanatics in my family.

Just made this for the first time... WOW! Great snack and oh so quick and easy! You do need to move quickly so you don't burn the sugar. I also went with adding salt to the pot, as some others did in their reviews. Can't wait to make it again and change up the flavours... ie adding some heat or other spices, similar to the Spiced Almonds I recently made. Thanks for posting this recipe... love the allrecipes site!

Delicious popcorn. However, I think the 15 minute cook time is very excessive.
It only took about 1-3 minutes. I used a Lodge Pot.
Also, don't touch the popcorn at first! Ouch!!!

delicious! I also use the 3 kernel technique to know when oil is hot enough (add oil and 3 popcorn kernels to pot, when the kernels all pop oil is ready!) Then added the rest of the corn/ sugar and gave it a good shake every few seconds to; the popping ceases. When it's done be sure to add a generous amount of salt to taste! It definitely enhances the sweetness of the kettle corn. :) I store leftovers in an airtight container (Folgers coffee can, actually!) and it stays crunchy and delicious enough to enjoy for the next couple days (if it lasts that long). :)

I've been using this recipe for several years, and everyone loves it.  First, I tried making it on the stovetop with mixed results.  Then I invested in a StirCrazy popper, and it made all the difference in the world. (I really hate it when I'm cooking and the smoke alarm goes off.)  I've made multiple batches for scouting activities and other group events, and the StirCrazy makes it super easy.  I know I sound like a commercial, but it really does make a huge difference.  The only other thing I do is sprinkle on some salt while the corn is still hot.  Yum!

I made with butter flavored Crisco, as someone else had suggested, and brown sugar. It's pretty darn good. Next time I'll throw some nuts in the mix. Thanks for the recipe :)

Perfect every time! Quick and easy and everyone loves it! And it does not scratch ceramic cook tops.  Maybe if there's something between the pan and the stove, such as debris, but my stove is has incurred no scratches each time I make this.

Good Popcorn!  Not exactly country fair, but kinda close.  If only I can get it to taste like it does at the fair when they can get it that perfect sweet/salty combo that just tells your brain, "OMG! this is so good!"  Like I said, good, and close, but not quite there.  I will try this with food coloring for my next party, though. :)

Loved it! Def make sure you add the 3 kernels to know when its ready and as it pops remove the pot from the burner every few seconds so it doesn't burn. Oh and make sure you have a tight fitting lid or the oil will splatter! :)

This popcorn is really tasty.  I rated it a four because you will have to add salt to get the true kettle corn taste. My children thought it was yummy.

This turned out pretty good. It was quick, easy, and convenient, but I have to admit I like my kettle corn covered in a thin crispy sugar coating. To me this tasted just slightly sweet, and I even added a few extra tablespoons of sugar. When I make this again I'm going to add 1/3 a cup of sugar instead.

Followed the directions using the 3 kernel test, and I put the sugar on immediately after I put the corn kernels in the hot oil, and I used the 3 second shake rule.  Came out perfect!  I put them on a few paper towels and sprinkled with salt.  This tastes so much better than the stuff in a box!   Very easy to do.   Great recipe!

I love this recipe. I'm almost addicted. I like it plain like the recipe calls for and I also like it adding cinnamon to the sugar. Great recipe. (Be careful not to break your teeth on unpopped kernels sticking to the cooked popcorn)

This is so good.  Every time I make a batch it runs out so fast that I end up making another.  I just add all the ingredients at the beginning to the cold pot and shake and it seems to work out fine.  I like to sprinkle it with a little salt, too, because the combination of sweet and salty has always been a weakness of mine.  It turns out so good, beware that you will eat the whole bowl.

This is good stuff. Definitely try it with salt though, made all the difference for me. I had been making it as is for my little brother and didn't think much of it until I thought I'd try a sweet/salty version-just a generous dash of salt once the kernels are all popped. Nice.

I came across this great recipe, and just had to give it an updated review, it is FANTASTIC! Thanks Sue! I have made this a dozen times or so now .. my kids like to show their friends just how good their mom can make kettle corn.  The recipe makes quite a bit, but you find yourself munching handful after handful, so I guess it's perfect :).

Awesome snack! Our family tried this tonight and loved it.  Used the 3 kernel method and then had the popcorn, sugar and salt premeasured (we added at the same time and didn't stir) so that we could start the 3 minute on/3 minute off shaking process - which worked perfectly.  No problem with burnt popcorn.  I think two things which really helped were using a pot with a clear lid and then soaking the pan immediately afterward.  The popcorn was great and the clean up was easy.  Thank you so much!  We love this kettle corn!

I loved it, my husband said it was just almost too sweet.  Which means it was perfect for me.  The three kernel warm up test was a great idea.  Definetely be watchful, this will go to the burn stage pretty quick at the end.  I pulled it off just right, but another 30 seconds and I think I would have had to throw it away.  This really isn't 5 helpings, maybe two, but only if both are feeling generous with the popcorn.  It would have been a little too much for me in one sitting, but I could have done it!

I made this recipe for my daughter who kept begging me for the microwave version and we were out of it. She did not like it at all...however, I LOVED it! The recipe was great and it didn't burn at all. I immediately sprinkled on some salt after pouring it into a bowl and mixing around, it was so good! I can't wait to try it with brown sugar!!

Made this for my daughter's sleepover birthday party and they loved it!  Tastes almost as good at the real stuff.  I used the suggestion of mixing 1 tsp salt into the sugar and melting that first and it was great.  Thanks for a nice easy variation to an inexpensive treat for a group.

This was EXCELLENT and so easy to make!  I also used 1 cup of popcorn kernels, and just added salt to taste at the end while the popcorn was still warm.  Also a see-through lid was helpful.  Delicious taste, made lots. This one is a keeper.

We just bought a Whirley Pop at work and I ordered some mushroom popcorn online.  I made this today and it was fantastic!  I did use slightly less oil, around 3 Tbsp instead of 1/4 cup.    The Whirley Pop instructions said not to add salt to the popper so I added a little as I poured it out into a bowl.  I added 3 kernels and when they popped I added the sugar, turned the crank a few times, then added the 1/2 cup of kernels.  It was perfect and no burnt corn at all!

I only give 5 star ratings to recipes that my super-picky 6-year-old likes.  His exact words were "Popcorn-y goodness!  This stuff is great!"  I'm going to try the brown sugar option tomorrow.

Good recipe...  Great if you double the popcorn so you have 1 cup and keep the sugar and oil at 1/4 cup each.

I made this just as the recipe states... It was yummy! I added some salt once in the bowl just because I personally like the salty and sweet combination... Keep the pot in constant motion if cooking on the stove top and transfer to a bowl immediately after popping and you will be fine. I did not have any trouble with burning..... enjoy!

SUPERB!  Just follow the other commenters about the on and off method and it wil turn out fantastic!  I have a crank pot to make popcorn, so I think it made it easier to prevent burning.  I made a double batch and it disappeared quickly!

Target and other stores sell PopStir, a modern day old fashioned stove top version of a popcorn popper. It goes by other names also.  Put it on the burner and it has a crank that stirs the corn and seasonings so it doesn't burn.

Amazing....I did the 3 kernel test...using our ceramic top stove, kept the temp at 6, and used the 3 second shake/3 second rest method and it turned out amazing....I used dark brown sugar at first and was really good although the bowl I thought was next to me, I had to quickly root for so the sugar singed a bit....the second time that day I used white sugar for the kids and its being devoured as we speak....definite keeper...

Wow!  Such a great treat!!  All the other tips helped me make this a great batch of popcorn!  I changed the amounts just a bit to make it more low cal -- 1/8 c sugar and 1/8 c olive oil....same amount of popcorn.  And I am enjoying a yummy bowl of kettle corn!

This was YUMMY! I also did the "kernel test" because I never popped my own corn and I wanted to be sure that I did it right. This recipe worked out perfectly for an evening snack while watching movies. I also added some salt to the popcorn once it was done to achieve the salty/sweet combo. I will be using this recipe often, my family LOVED it! Thanks for sharing. :)

Going by other reviews and comments, I tried things a little differently - I used 1/4 cup of popcorn with 1/3 cup of sugar and 3/4 teaspoon of salt in a Whirley Pop stovetop popper.  It came out a bit too salty and slightly burned and carmelized.  Next time, I will try it in a normal pot like others with a bit less salt and hopefully it will come out better.  However, it wasn't bad for the first try, using some alternative methods and quantities.

This was an awesome recipe, my whole family loved it!!!  I added 1tsp of salt and it was perfect!  I haven't tried the brown sugar yet but will next!  I also love the food coloring idea, I think that will really impress my 10 year old :) I totally recommend this recipe.  I did use a stove top crank handle popper for this and it worked great!

I LOVE this recipe!!!!! Hubby wants it a bit more saltier, so I'm working on that. Otherwise it's wonderful! I do the 3 kernal test and the 3 second on, off and shake others have mentioned too. Works like a charm!

YUM! YUM! YUM! You will not be disappointed with this one. It is delicious. Be sure to use a good quality popcorn so you get big kernals. Also, I did what others suggested. I put the oil and 3 kernels in. Then I waited until all 3 popped. Then I put in the sugar and the popcorn and stirred it all together. Put on the lid and shook for 3 seconds, let it sit for 3. It turned out amazing on the first try. I added salt after it was out (and still a little sticky), but I also might play around with adding it to the pot. Can't wait to try it with brown sugar too. My parents were over when I made this, and they were impressed. Easy, cheap and YUMMY! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I would have never thought of making this.

Delish and super easy.  I too used the West Bend Stir Crazy popper and it could not be easier.  We will never have to buy kettle corn again!  Can't wait to try it with brown sugar to see if it tastes like caramel corn.

I am so excited I can make this at home! I used the 3 kernel and the shake and sit tips (though I should have picked it up from the burner to shake- not too much burned though). Next time I'll use a tad more sugar. I can't wait to make this for my 7 year old! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

It's crazy how quick and easy this recipe is.  I used my coated cast iron pot and added the sugar and popcorn simultaneously after the three kernal test.  Once popped I topped with popcorn salt and stirred around, but I think I'll use black truffle salt for a special treat the next time, and will definately experiment with flavored sugars!!  Easy, fun and very inexpensive.  Thanks!!

This was pretty good! Not quite as good as some friends' kettle corn (they had a kettle corn business), but WAY better than the bagged microwavable kind!  I did the 3 kernel test and alternated shaking and sitting it on the burner every 3 seconds (made for a great ab workout!).  Turned out great!

try #1: i made it 50% brown sugar and 50% white sugar. the technique is a little detailed; need to improve on that... but otherwise being a bit too burnt, it's quite good

Sue thank you for posting and Krystenl thanks for the tips.  I can not tell you guys how much money I have just saved by being able to make this at home.  I use a wok with a lid and had no problems even on the first try.

My boyfriend actually makes it due to his love of kettle corn and it turned out great -- almost like the stuff he reminisces about getting at the farmer's market in SoCal.  I've never tried it til he made it and love it.   We've used the  'shake & sit' technique plus added salt with the sugar.  Turns out perfect every time!

I am so excited to find this recipe!!  It is wonderful.  I have one of those stove top poppers with the crank handle.  I put the sugar in first and let it dissolve before adding the corn and then just kept stirring.  It turned out great and I will be making it often. Thanks!!

This tastes very much like the kettle corn I like to buy at the state fair! I didn't think it would work, because my kernels didn't pop until I raised the temperature to high rather than medium. This made the corn pop, but also caramelized the sugar...next time I make it, I will stick to the medium heat and be a little more patient! I did sprinkle the popcorn with salt while it was still hot and sticky; it gave it that wonderful sweet/salty kettle corn flavor! Thanks for sharing this recipe...I will be making it often!

This is awesome.  I had never liked kettle corn until last weekend and I've had a craving since.  My first go around didn't come out like the picture, unfortunately, but it tastes great.  Mostly my ineptitude and my crummy stove, which burned some of the sugar.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt and will add more next time, 'cause there will definately be a next time!  Thanks!

This was fantastic!  I will not go back to microwave popcorn!  I too used others suggestion of adding the sugar into the oil and dissolving prior to adding the kernels.  I used butter flavored shortening as my oil and it gave a nice light butter flavor.  I shook for 3 seconds then lifted slightly off the heat for 3 seconds until popcorn poppings slows.  Immediately pour into large bowl and salt while warm.  YUM!!!

I just finished making this recipe minutes ago. The three kernels test is a good way to start the first batch.  I placed the oil in the pan, then the popcorn.  Once the oil starts to sizzle then, sprinkle the sugar over the popcorn.  Leave as much of the top of the pot open as possible and use the 3 seconds on, 3 seconds off the fire rule.  FANTASTIC!!

I should have read the reviews first. It would have helped to know right off that try and have the sugar melt before adding the popcorn.... the flavour is nice and it went down well when we got it right, but you have to keep the pot moving to avoid a sticky mess on the bottom of the pot.  We do, however, prefer more savoury popcorn so will not make this often.

Okay, so this recipe took some practice. Once I got the hang of it, I ended up with wonderful kettle corn!!! Like the other reviews, I do the three-kernel test. Once those 3 have popped, I add the kernels and the sugar together. I stir that once or twice so there aren't any clumps, and I leave the pan on the burner until the popcorn has started popping really well. After that, I do the 5 second on, 5 second off bit that was mentioned in another review. This popcorn is really easy to burn, and it may take some practice, but the end result is soooo worth it!!!

This was great!!  I used all the suggestions - 3 kernel test and 3 sec on and off shake.  Took me 2 tries to get it right - I thought there was too much sugar as written.  And it definitely needs some salt - very KEY!!  With these modifications, it would 5 stars!!

I found this recipe 20 minutes ago and my kids are eating the Kettle Corn right now.  A great, easy, fast recipe.  I made it according to the recipe in my Stir Crazy (electric popper with a rotating rod in the base).  I waited until there was 3 seconds after the last pop before turning it off.  Burned a little of the popcorn so next time I will stop it when it sounds like the bulk of the popping is done.  Can't wait to try it with brown sugar.

So simple! I added 1/4-1/2 tsp of butterscotch flavouring and a pinch of salt and it taste just like caramel corn, with the same crunch. I know I'll be making it often.

This is a good one...the only thing that I didn't like was that the popped corn sticks together.  But my daughter said it is even better than what you buy from the "Kettle Corn Man" in our town.

This turned out great!  I use a "Back to Basics" popcorn popper, like a Wirleypop.    Husband, who doesn't really like popcorn, came back for seconds!

Awesome recipe. I made it tonight for the first time, and it was pretty good. I'll tinker around with it a bit (I thought it had too much sugar, a guest thought not enough), but this is definitely a good recipe.

This recipe gave me the courage to make popcorn on the stove for the first time! I like my Kettle Corn sweet, salty, and caramelized, and my result was close. It turned out light brown, and very close to burnt, and I didn't add enough salt. But for my first try I'd say that's pretty good! The lid on my pot steamed up, so I couldn't see how many kernels were left, which is why I almost burned it.

This is so much cheaper and tastier than the microwave brands. I'm on a diet, so I'll use less sugar next time.

Great flavor, but mine burnt.  I was shaking constantly, so I don't know what went wrong.  Maybe I'll try it with a non-stick pan.

I love this recipe!  Works perfectly with my 3-qt Hello Kitty Popcorn Maker which stirs the oil and sugar consistently for me and has the exact room to make 1/2 cup kernels of popcorn.  Topped off with a bit of salt.  YUM!

This kettle corn is great!  I'm so happy that now I don't have to wait until the fair to have kettle corn, and I can have it without spending $8.00 for a bag!  I didn't have any problems with burning.  I used half butter and half popcorn oil, and the same amount of sugar, and used a Whirley Pop for cooking.  I think being able to constantly stir helped the popcorn not to burn.  This popcorn is so good that if you don't have a Whirley Pop, I would go out and buy one just to make this kettle corn!

This is AMAZING! It just might be the best snack ever. And it's easy and cheap. Well, it seems easy. My husband made it for me in our stovetop popcorn maker. We followed the recipe and just added a little popcorn salt at the end. He did the 3-kernel test. Some of the sugar formed little chunks; maybe it wasn't melted completely before we added the kernels. But the end result was still perfect! We will be making this often.
Update: Watch out! This kettle corn is so addicting! We make it often for our friends and it's always a hit. People request it when they come over to our house. We pour it in a bowl and top it with popcorn salt--it really needs salt for the perfect sweet and salty flavor.

I used brown sugar and mine had a mild burned taste to it. I shook it constantly as directed but for some reason mine still burned- I will try this again however, because the recipe is worth perfecting. Next time i will lower the heat just a tad.... 
oh yeah- i did add just a bit of salt to it.

Great recipe!  I am on a salt restricted 
diet, now I can have kettle corn and control the salt.  I also tried a readers
suggestion and used butter and brown sugar.
It's great also.  Not so heavy on the caramel.

OMGosh!!! This was awesome!!!! I made it on a splurg and I needed something to do with this this cheap kernel corn i bought and this was it!! I made 2 batches in one night!! I cut back on the sugar and let it melt in the (popcorn)oil before adding the kernels and only added 3 to see when they would pop then added the rest, and I took anothers advice and kept the corn moving, either stirring or shaking and when I added it to the bowl, I layerd the salt on so that I got salty/sweet throughout. No more regualar popcorn in my house!! Thank you sue!!

Soooooo good, and easy. I think I have a new snack, as I always have these ingredients on hand! I followed the 3-second method as suggested by others and used a pressure cooker pan as I wanted to ensure a lid that was tightly on since you need to shake it around. I used sea salt and next time I think I'll just use table salt and sparingly so, but that's just me. Thanks for making a treat I normally only get once a year so easy, and just as delicious!

Oh my goodness! I thought this recipe was too simple to be very good, but I was wrong. The only thing I did differently was to add about 1 tsp. salt at the same time as the sugar. SO GOOD! Who needs to go to the fair now?

Amazing!!!!! We loved it. We tried 3 batches over the stove with a big pot and they all burnt. So today I was at a thrift store and saw a wirley pop that I heard others talk about. I snatched it up for $2 and brought it home. We made the best Kettle corn that I've ever had. I put just plain table salt on it right wen it was done. Not a burnt kernel! I'm hooked! Thanks so much.

That is whatever I managed to salvage ;)  So, I always make popcorn, but for some reason didn't even think to cover this pot- DUH!  COVER THE POT!  Popcorn started going everywhere- too bad we weren't videotaping.  My teenager and I had quite a laugh over it and enjoyed what was left- yummy!

Wow- I couldn't even get a picture, this disappeared so fast!  I took the advice of others for the popping technique and it was so easy!  

And this turned out Amazing!!  We will NEVER buy kettle corn at the fair, ball game, etc again!   Thanks so much for sharing!

8/29/08- just an update...  We bought some kettle corn at a college football game last night- and it seriously sucked compared to this recipe!  My bf says "my" kettle corn is his favorite dessert I make!

Oh yum. I made this last night and it was delicious. I have never had kettle corn at a carnival or a fair.. just the microwave stuff and this was perfect. I had no troubles with anything burning or sticking. I just shook the pot, set it down for a few seconds, then shook the pot again.. just like everyone recommended.

I may try to replace some of the sugar with splenda and cut back on the oil to make this less of a diet disaster :). I'll have to read through the reviews to see if anyone has tried this yet.

Probably the closest you will come to kettle corn at home. Follow PABLOJR's instructions. Don't forget the salt. Start with a couple of teaspoons of kosher and adjust to your taste. Good stuff!

Just tried this about a week ago, and have been making it almost daily since!!! Not exactly healthy I know, but so addicting! The first batch was a little clumpy, but since then, Ive pretty much mastered it. The best!

OK, I normally hate when someone comments on a recipe that they changed...but this is more like a tip (or that's what I mean it to be) You can achieve this taste with just microwave popcorn and two or three spoonfuls of sugar!  All you have to do is sprinkle the sugar on when its still hot and shake or mix up and ta-da!!  AND it even works with splenda for anyone with diabetes or is watching sugar intake!!!  YUMMY!

WONDERFUL!  Just made my very first batch and it is PERFECT. used the 3 corn kernal test, than the 3 second sit and shake method -- perfect.  Not a burnt piece in the pan, although there are a few unpopped kernals, but It's a generic brand of popcorn, so that might be why...
EXCELLENT STUFF!!!!

This is a fantastic recipe! My kids love kettle corn but I've been trying to find healthier ways to make it than the microwave bags you get at the store. This is nearly as easy, cheaper, and doesn't have the extra junk that the microwave bags have. Not to mention that it tastes SO much better! We added a sprinkling of salt after it popped (but while it was still sticky) and it was perfect. We did the 3 kernel test and I alternated the shaking and still ended up with some kernels at the bottom with burned oil/sugar on them but it was my first time.

WOW WOW WOW, Never will pay $5 for a bag at the fair again.  I cut both the oil and the sugar back by 1 tbsp and added salt at the end after popping like others suggested.  PERFECT.

Thank you for posting this recipe, even though basic.  I had never made it before.  I used air poppped popcorn and just drizzled the butter/salt/sugar mixture over the hot popcorn. Delicious!

This is the cure for PMS!
And WAY better for you than eating a bag of chips!
I used half the sugar called for (and it was plenty sweet enough), and mixed corn oil and olive oil to a bit less than called for (was all i had).  I stirred everything together after using the 3 kernel rule (see other reviews) and just popped until I had a pot full, none were burnt.  I added salt after and I just finished eating 2 bowls! YUM!

I had never made this before. I used my heavy duty pressure cooker pan to pop the corn in. It came out right the first time. My husband had me make another batch. Getting the oil hot is the key and shaking the pan so the sugar won't stick and burn.
This is one I will make all the time. Boy I bet I saved tons of money by making it myself. And it was so easy.

Yummy recipe - but all of the oil is REALLY unnecessary and only adds fat. I made it using the three kernel test and only 2 tbsp oil, and it was fantastic.

Boy I wish that I could give this more stars as it deserves more!!!  Unbelievable how good this stuff is!  I could eat the whole bowl myself and YES, it is much better than the stuff you buy at the fairs or in front of some stores!  Followed the suggestions of others, 3 kernel pop test, than add the rest of the ingredients.  I sprinkle salt on after it was in the serving bowl, toss, tasted and added more salt to taste.  This is going to go on my cookie platters next year for Christmas and will now be something I take to parties as my "treat" to bring!!  Thanks Sue!  Can't wait to try with brown sugar.

I am SOOOO addicted to this stuff! I've had a couple messy flubs along the way (you really need to know which pan pops corn the best, know your stove so you've got the right setting, and be sure you shake the pan as other reviewers have said). I like mine a bit salty, so I add a bit with the sugar and corn. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!!

We recently bought some kettle corn at a local festival and I thought, "I can make this" and was delighted to find this recipe. BUT, I'm a little naughty....I upped the sugar to 1/3 cup...I like it a tad sweeter...YUM!

This was excellent!! My son came proudly home the other day with a bag of unpopped popcorn and was so excited that it was so cheap.  He didn't understand that you just couldn't put it in a pan and pop it.  Well, with this recipe you can.  It has become the family favorite, especially of my husband, who is not a popcorn lover!  Very helpful review also.

So I've never had kettle corn at the fair.  The only kettle corn I've had is the kind out of a bag you put in the microwave.  I'm not sure how this was supposed to turn out - it sort of has a glaze over it.  It is very good and I'll make it again.  I think I burnt some of the bottom b/c some pieces are a carmalized brown color.  The flavor reminds me of a popcorn ball.

I've been using this recipe for quite some time and I'm not sure why I never rated it.  This is PERFECT!!!  We used to do it on the stove with one of our pots, but now we have a whirly pop and that's even better.  Perfect ratio!  Love it!!!

This is a great recipe.  The first time I followed it as it is, and my popcorn burned.  I tried it again using the directions from the person who gave instructions on her 11-30-05 review, and it turned out really well.  Thanks.

Very good popcorn recipe! :) Mine came burnt though, and a lot of kernels didn't pop. I followed the 3 kernel-test method. :\ Oh well, at least it was still delicious! I'll try to add butter next time, and make other improvements to my taste. Thanks though! :)

Decided to play around with this, used a combination of brown and white sugar and a few tablespoons of butter in place of half the oil. Tasted rather different. I would highly suggest sticking to either brown OR white, not both!

I love kettle corn!!!  This is a wonderful recipe to get a favorite for a fraction of the price from vendors.  Don't forget the salt!  It doesn't taste exactly the same until you do.

Very easy to do.  I made this in my dutch oven pot and it filled it to the top.  I would like to try a little butter with the oil and maybe substitute brown sugar to see what happens.  I msde this for a church group tonight and got rave reviews.

I've been trying to find a good kettle corn recipe for a long time. This is perfect! I think the trick is adding the sugar after the first kernal pops. I used my Whirly Pop and I've had success each time. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do I feel like a dope for paying $2 a bag for kettle corn at my farmer's market! If I only knew just how easy it was! This turned out perfect the first time, the only thing I did wrong was not make enough!

I'm glad I thought to look this up.  It's much easier than I expected it to be. I had some of the sugar burn a bit, but that was my fault.  I'll follow PabloJr's advice as well. This is going to be a family treat.

Great snack for the kids and they love it. I do add just a little salt to have that great sweet n salty taste. I just the crank style popcorn pot I bought my husband and turns out every time. I did not like it with brown sugar though.

I used to make just plain popcorn from scratch. But now my family always begs me to make kettle corn, my dad even thinks it's better than the stuff you get at the fair. I always add salt at the end just to even out the flavours. Keep shaking while its popping, trust me, it's worth the workout. And sometimes i'll even add food colouring before the pop corn has started to pop, because i'm cool like that XD I haven't tried it with brown sugar, but i might soon.

this is the bomb!
The first batch I burned...so I tried the 3 kernel trick and added the sugar later too and it worked out great. Some added salt really makes for good eats!

This is very tasty.  The only problem now is that my kids want this instead of plain popcorn!

Thank you so much for this recipe!! This is just what I was looking for.  I did the three kernel trick as well, using my hand crank popcorn popper and I used peanut oil just because I had some. I added about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt to the finished product.  It tasted just like the kettle corn I get at Cornish Christmas!

This recipe turned out pretty well.  Like a below reviewer, I used a wok my second time around, waited until the three kernels popped, then added sugar and the rest of the kernels.  This will definately take some practice to perfect, however.

Yummy!  We halved the recipe and used a stove-top stirring wand type popper.  We used the three kernel tip suggested in several other reviews.  It was wonderful!  Easy to make and tasty!

I, too, used a stainless steel pot and ended up with a slightly sticky mess.  I think, though, that you should use the same judgement as when you are using microwave popcorn: stop cooking after it slows to 3-4 pops per second.

I thought the popcorn was way too sweet.

This was great!  I followed some other reviewers advice & used the buttery topping instead of vegetable oil, added a little salt & used a few kernels to test when the oil is hot enough.  My toddler thought this was a great after nap snack!

This recipe is SOOOO good that it's worth tearing up your stove and scorching your pans if you HAVE to, but...  for $19.99 you can get a whirly pop at Bed, Bath & Beyond or Linens N Things that makes absolutely PERFECT kettle corn and makes it very quickly without any burning.  Definitely add some salt at the end, though, to get that classic salty/sweet kettle corn taste.  Thanks Sue - we'll never eat it any other way again!

The family loved this.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and heated the oil before adding the sugar and then I added the popcorn.  Came out great!
