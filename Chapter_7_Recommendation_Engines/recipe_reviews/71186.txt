This should be called DIABETIC STRAWBERRY TAPIOCA because it is made with no sugar or substitutes.  If you have any sense, you know that you have to use the very sweet strawberries, not the sour early season ones!  Also, since it is not made with milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla, this is not going to taste anything like what you are used to with tapioca pudding.  This dessert is made to taste totally different from your ordinary tapioca and it does it's job VERY well.  Whenever I make a recipe the first time, I make it exactly the way the submitter suggests.  Then if I am going to change it any, I do so on the second or third run.  The next time I make this, I will make a few changes:  I will mix half milk and half water, I will also sprinkle sugar on it or add a tbsp of honey

Not much flavour ---- added a bit of sugar, that helped, but needed to add chopped strawberries to the final pudding to make enjoyable.....

Sorry, this was horrid.  It had no taste, and I had to add sugar just to make it go down comfortably.

What a poor little recipe . . . .this is not the "normal" vanilla tapioca, which calls for milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla . . .this is sort of like tapioca jello or a tapioca fruit pie minus the fruit pieces and sugar.  I used defrosted frozen strawberries (what I had) and the liquid from the strawberries for the water.  When I tried this right after making it while it was still hot, I wasn't thrilled--a little too tart.  However, let it cool in the fridge and the sweetness of the strawberries will come through.  I topped it with chocolate chips thinking that would help, but I should've swirled them through while hot--it's a little too much to eat the tapioca and chomp on the chips.  Still, that's my addition that didn't work as the textures are too different.  Don't be afraid to try this, but don't expect traditional tapioca, and don't be afraid to experiment.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a non-sweet version of tapioca - no sugar added.  It is not creamy like the vanilla, milk and sugar kind.  Still it is good and it's something different.

Every recipe is subject to the cook's opinion.  I did some tweaking myself, and found it satisfactory.

if you add some sugar, it makes it taste less like strawberry jam.  nothing like the familiarity of vanilla tapioca though.

I think this is best when strawberries are in season...getting that natural sweetness from it.  I made an ice drink from this by pre-cooking small colored pearl tapioca (asian store) then cooled; slightly crushed ice first in the blender then crushed with the strawberries leaving some bits and pieces, then mixed in the cooled tapioca and added a bit of water. I had to add splenda also because my strawberries wasn't ripe enough.

I've never come across a bad recipe on allrecipes, till I came across this one. Flavorless and looks/tastes/texture are unappealing.

This works better if you use frozen strawberries and all or most of the liquid is what comes out while thawing.

I made this recipe as directed, except I added 2tsp of coconut sugar and let it chill completely before eating. It really is a good recipe! If you are looking at the negative reviews, just remember ~ this is not a traditional tapioca pudding! This is light and fruity and fresh. Perfect when strawberries are in season, I actually made this because I went strawberry picking yesterday and came home with 16lbs of strawberries so I am making strawberry EVERYTHING today! ;)
