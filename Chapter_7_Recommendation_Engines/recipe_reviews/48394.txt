I sauteed some garlic in the butter before adding the flour.  I also added some dill weed.  This was delicious on salmon cakes.  

This sauce is quick to make, but have all your ingredients out and ready to go.  It thickens quickly once you add the flour and milk.

To satisfy a craving I made salmon patties with asparagus for dinner but something was missing. I needed a sauce that would go with both that was quick and didn't require searching the Earth for ingredients. I tried this recipe and it was fantastic. The best part is it can be made in the microwave. Thanks. I'll be back for more.

I LOVE this sauce!  I even use it as a much easier (and healthier) hollandaise for eggs benedict.

This sauce is great for salmon patties!
I use the 2 Tbsp. Lemon Juice, and then add a packet of True Lemon. I also add a bit of thyme, granulated garlic and just a pinch of oregano and basil. I use half&half instead of milk... and don't be afraid of the cayenne... it really makes the sauce! 
Delicious, and thanks for the post!

I loved the concept of this recipe. I added a garlic clove to the flour and butter mixture (maybe next time I will only use half) I also added some lemon pepper and black pepper as I didn't want it to be too lemony. I didn't measure my lemon juice I just squeezed half a lemon into it. Loved the cayenne pepper in this. I put this on a salmon steak. I cooked the salmon steak in the oven with butter, garlic salt, lemon pepper, and cayenne pepper. It all turned out delicious. It was on my husbands plate a whole of 30 seconds!!

A great base for a sauce.  I was looking for something to top our crabcakes and this sounded like the crabcake sauce we get at a favorite restaurant.  I knew I just needed a couple additions and it was EXACTLY like the sauce we love.  I used 1/2 cup 1% milk and 1/4 cup half and half.  After bringing to boil, I put a big drop of yellow food color to give it a nice pale yellow tint. I did about 2 1/2 tbsp. of lemon (because that was the juice of a whole lemon).  At the end, I stirred in about a handful of finely diced fresh red bell pepper and about a heaping tbsp. of capers.  Not only did it taste great, the addition of the peppers, capers and food coloring made it look beautiful.  Thanks for sharing!  It made our crab cakes PERFECT!

Very good sauce.  Both my husband and I loved it.  I served it over salmon patties I made using the Oregon salmon patty recipe on this site.  I added a little extra lemon juice since I used bottled juice.  Needs a little color though.  I used 2-3 drops yellow food coloring and it definetely gave it more eye appeal.

CopperPot, I think you read the recipe incorrectly.  It is 4 teaspoons of flour, not 4 tablespoons.  Also, any sauce made with flour should be cooked for a min. or two before adding other ingredients to help cook off the floury taste.  Hope you'll try it again.

This sauce is really rich and wonderful.  I added lemon and lime juice and added heavy cream instead of milk.  It was a great hit at a recent dinner party on top of crab cakes.  Thank you so much.

Meh.  I found this sauce too floury tasting.  I needed to add more cayenne than the recipe calls for in order to taste it.  It was still pretty boring, so I added some dill to give it more flavor. Maybe it would be better with some lemon zest.

Excellent sauce! I did add a couple Tablespoons of capers and used a mixed pepper blend to replace the cayenne because I had no cayenne. Tasted oh so perfect with my salmon cakes!

This turned out waaay too thick, and kind of tasted like mashed potatoes to us.  Needs more salt, lemon juice and milk to thin it, or maybe use 1/2 the flour.  With a lot of tweaking, it would be great.

I made this recipe to go with my salmon patties, i'm happy that it was just a little something to top them!  This is really quick and easy to make- the only thing is that I thought the color was a bit funky, a little see through and a little opaque at the same time. I could see using this as a base and adding more flavor to it: Dill, parsley or something to liven it up a bit.  I did like it though, thank you for sharing!

Yum! Made this sauce to go with the Oregon Salmon Patties from this site. I used rice milk because of a whey allergy and added dill. I think some white wine would also be a nice addition, will try that next time. I love the simplicity of this sauce and it came together really quickly. Be sure to whisk quickly and have all your ingredients ready to go because you can easily burn this sauce if you let it sit on the heat. Thanks for sharing, will try this on tilapia and probably shrimp too!

Yummm!! I made it as directed except I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I added a sprinkle of chili powder. I also added a sprinkle of garlic powder and a sprinkle of dill, since I was using those spices in the Oregon Salmon Patties recipe (this site), and I wanted to tie the flavors together.

Perfect for tuna cakes and salmon cakes. I tasted it right after I made it and didn't think it was that great, but once it was on the seafood cakes it made the flavo pop! For some reason it got way too firm as it cooled, but thinning it with warm milk, worked well.

Followed the recipe exactly for use with Oregon Salmon Patties from AR. The sauce was bland and flavorless. Even after tripling the lemon juice and adding dill, it still completely masked the flavors in the fish patties, making the entire dish taste like nothing.  The salmon patties were excellent with just a little lemon juice.  I will not be making this again.

This is a great basic sauce to know, and can have endless variations. The original recipe is great to go with salmon, as above. Another great one is, instead of the lemon, put in garlic and parmesan- great sauce for green veggies such as broccoli and asparagus, or even for pasta.  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

Made this tonight to go with the "Potato Salmon Patties" from this site and it was perfect!  I, too, was a little concerned about the cayenne pepper because I really don't like spicy but I put it in anyway and it was just the right amount of "kick".  I will definitely save this recipe!

I made this sauce with salmon patties.  It was pretty good.  We would have liked more lemon flavor, next time I will use more.  It was very good with the roasted asparagus that I made along side the salmon.

I'm surprised at the many reviews that said this was too tart and/or "lemony".  I upped the lemon to 3 TBS. and it still was very light to me.  I guess I'm a "lemon-oholic!"  If you love lemon, you'll need more than this recipe recommends. It's a good base sauce.

This is excellent sauce for salmon patties. Would probably also be good on Salmon steaks. I added a shake or two of Thyme too.  Thyme and lemon always go together. The red pepper makes the sauce. Didn't think the 2T. of lemon juice was too much as others thought.

A great sauce to pair with salmon patties.  It adds a little perk for the senses and adds a great taste.  I recommend it for almost any baked white fish too.

Wonderful base recipe!  I opted to use some half and half  and skim milk.  Added a bit of chopped chives and chopped capers.  This really is divine with salmon patties.  But it is equally good on veggies such as roasted asparagus.  Will make this regularly.

I really like this sauce.  I add capers at the end.  I use this on many different forms of fish.  Not just salmon patties.  I use a bit more lemon (I love citrus).

I made this as a sauce to go on crispy skin salmon.  My girlfriend absolutely loved it!

I browned some diced Canadian bacon and threw that it with the melting butter.  I'm so happy I did.  I feel like that made the sauce for me.  Also, I added some red pepper flakes for a little exta heat, but I like very spicy food.  

Great recipe

fantastic!  I served this over the Oregon Salmon Patties from Allrecipes.com.  the only thing I did differently was I added some grated orange rind because I happened to have it on hand.  It did make quite a bit though so tonight we're going to try the leftovers on some floured chicken cutlets.

This was super quick and very good on the salmon burgers we had last night. Per other reviews, I used a little less flour (3 tsp) and it was still plenty thick (very good)! I added a little more lemon juice than called for and also added about a Tbls each of lemon zest and fresh dill. Thanks for the great recipe. Will definitely make again!

Very nice compliment to the salmon patties! Even dad ate this and he is a true believer in just fresh lemon on his patties. Had leftover sauce, going to try adding it on some baked chicken.

I made this exactly as per the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  Although this sauce is intended for salmon patties, I used this as a topping for Normandy Mix veggies, and it was delicious.  I will certainly use this recipe again the next time I make salmon patties.

After making it, I tasted it and it wasn't lemon-y enough for me so I added another Tablespoon and it was perfect! Used it to top the Potato Salmon Patties from this website and a side dish of broccoflower. Excellant on both.

I made this sauce and used it on on chicken breasts. It turned out great. The whole family loved it. I used a fresh lemon, some garlic, and some fresh parsley. I omitted the cayenne only because my son doesn’t like it. I will make this again. It had a very light and fresh flavor.

This was really delicious. My boyfriend almost loathes salmon cakes yet, after adding this sauce to them, I was able to get him to eat half of one cake, lol. I followed the recipe as is; I only implemented light milk cream for the usage of regular milk. I even dipped my French fries in the sauce. Thank u for this one!

This was a nice addition to my salmon dinner. I just added it as a side sauce. Would use less flour next time, as it turned out a bit thick for my tastes. Also added in a little pepper and fresh garlic as well.

A prefect mild lemon flavored sauce for the Oregon Salmon Patties. Not over powering at all. Made as stated, but could kick it up a notch with alittle more cayenne if you prefer.

Excellent and easy! Added 2 cloves minced garlic and sauteed in the butter before adding flour. Not a big cayenne pepper fan, so used Old Bay Seasoning instead. Also added fresh parsley and dill. Served over Oregon Salmon Patties. Phenomenal! Yum, yum!

This sauce was pretty good, but it was a little thicker than I anticipated.  I think it would have worked better to stir the cooked butter/flour (roux) in by the spoonful to an already warm mixture of milk and lemon juice (saw the tip on another recipe and it worked well).  I think by adding the cold milk, it made the sauce chunky.  I ended up adding some white cooking wine to thin it out and then had to add more lemon juice.  I added some dill, but the sauce really came together after I added some garlic.  I didn't actually care for it on the cod I made it for (since I thought it was lighter), but it was fantastic on the rice.  Love the tanginess and spice--would like to try again.

Really good and can help with the fish if it's a little over cooked.  I added a little more lemon juice to give it an extra zest.

I cut the recipe to two servings and we had plenty for four salmon patties. We enjoyed the sauce on Oregon Salmon Patties from this site. I think I cooked the sauce a little long because it got pretty thick. It tasted a little cheesy even though there is no cheese in it. I had to put my pan back on the heat the get the sauce to smooth out after I added the lemon juice.

I really didn't like this sauce. I prefer a lighter sauce without the flour. It was like a lemony rue.

I made as written for my salmon patties but ended up having to add garlic, dill, and more cayenne to kick up the flavor.

Excellent! However, it definitely could use a garlic kick to it. After I made it and tasted it, I added garlic powder and salt and that definitely made the sauce taste better.

This needed way more lemon in it.  I re-made it with 2 TBS and some grated zest. MUCH better.  Also threw in more salt.

This turned out fantastic!  By following the recipe precisely, I wasn't really satisfied.  I ended up adding a cap full of lemon extract (from the small McCormick bottle; probably about 1/4 of a teaspoon) to really kick up the lemon flavor.  I also added in Johnny's Seasoning salt instead of just plain salt.  Before I covered the salmon with the sauce, I sprinkled salt and pepper and a little bit of the Johnny's Seasoning Salt on the patties.  Once I covered the the patties with the sauce, I sprinkled more cayenne pepper over the top, because I felt it needed a little bit more of a punch.  It ended up very tasty and tangy and pleased the whole family.

Used this sauce on top of Oregan Salmon Patties from this site.    To sauce, I used reviewers' suggestions & added a little dill and 1 clove minced garlic.      Hubby loved it!

Very, very good on salmon patties. I didn't change a thing and my entire family loved it--husband, kids, and even my parents who came for a visit. I agree with another reviewer who said not to skip the cayenne. It is so good with that subtle kick.

I just finished eating this on rice topped with salmon. I think for fish it was too thick. It was very good (I added dill and garlic also) but if I make it again, I will use less flour to make it less like gravy and more like a sauce. I think fish tastes better with lighter sauces.

I made this sauce to serve over flounder. I did modify it just a little, added 1 tsp. fresh lemon zest, a pinch of lemon pepper seasoning, and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. My family enjoyed this with the flounder. I think it could be used over any type of fish.

I just made this to go with some salmon patties - yum! No cayenne pepper, so I put in a dash of chili powder. It worked out really well. The lemon turned out to be perfect. I'll prob ably make salmon patties more often now that I have a lighter "topping" to go with it.

This sauce was easy to make and turned out ok.  It wasn't quite as flavorful as expected, but may be very nice if you want something light.  A good lower calorie, milder alternative to hollandaise.

This went very well with the potato salmon patties I made. I just used a dash of the cayenne pepper, and that was enough of a kick for me. Still seemed like it needed something, but I couldn't figure out what, but it turned out smooth and lemony -- a good dipping sauce for the patties.

I did make one change. Whenever I can, particularly with fish, I substitute lime juice for lemon. Changes things up a bit and for our family makes everything better.

Good! I used 2 tbps of cornstarch  in stead, since I had that on hand. Then I blended the whole thing in my magic bullet after it was cooked so it was smooth. 
Sauce definitely saved my dry salmon patties!

I wanted a lemony sauce for grilled chicken--I used this one and added a tsp of sugar(accidentally added 1/2 tsp cayenne) Sauce was not  a thick sauce like tartar, but a smooth sauce to pour over chicken and not too overwhelming, still had zing of cayenne effect.

Really nice sauce for the salmon cakes I made from this site.  Before making this, I read several of the reviews, and added some minced onions, garlic, dill, and additional lemon, to taste.  As with most of the food I prepare, I go by taste, more than by the actual recipe.  But, I will make this again, with the revisions.

The sauce was a little meh when I tried it on its own, so I added some garlic salt and pepper to give it a little more flavor. I served it a top a salmon filet with brown rice and spinach, and it was really tasty all together!

Delicious with the salmon.  A little too thick; try 3 Tbs.flour (Wondra never lumps).  I always have Minute Maid frozen lemon juice on hand.  Was out of cayenne so stirred in Sriracha to taste.

This was a very easy, basic recipe!!

I did make a couple changes. First, I used coconut flour instead of regular flour, because my daughter needs gluten free. Coconut flour goes farther, so I just eyeballed it and added till it looked like enough. 

I didn't have any lemons, but really wanted a citrusy topping for my salmon patties. I substituted lime juice. Obviously these two changes effected the flavor--but based on the way it turned out, I know this would work well with the original ingredients as well! I'll definitely be using this one again (hopefully with lemons next time!)

Wanted some sauce for salmon burgers, thought this would do the trick. It had a bit of spice to it, but I loved it like that! I would suggest adding a little more lemon to the sauce, but other than that it tastes great.

I also added a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice since I saw others used bottled lemon juice as well. I gave it more of a snapped. I also add a tad more cayenne pepper, but it still didn't have the bite I needed. So I added Lemon Pepper and that worked just right! This is a good sauce and I will continue to use it in the future! I didn't use it for patties, but for salmon fillets. It still was great!

This sauce was ok, but the cayenne overwhelmed the lemon.  I wish that the sauce had a few other flavors to make it a bit more complex.  I would use it again, but I will also search for other sauces.

This sauce was so easy and tasted wonderful!  I added extra lemon juice, dill and a bit more pepper.  It is very delicious and versitile - It really made the seafood I prepared salmon patties elegant.  It would be great on other seafood dishes or almost anything.  Loved it!

Sorry, this lemon-flavored white gravy just did not appeal to us for salmon patties.  Making a homemade tartar sauce is easier, faster, and tastier.

Super yummy.  Loved the tang and spice together, and the creamy texture was perfect on tope of the salmon...and the asparagus, and probably almost any veggie.  We'll be making this regularly!

I have a cream sauce recipe I use for crab and salmon patties, but having misplaced it, I tried this recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  It certainly is edible- my kids even ate it without complaint, but it's nothing to write home about.  I'll keep looking for my old standby.

This was a great and simple recipe! We got a bunch of fresh salmon and made some great salmon patties but there was something missing. This sauce had a lot of great flavor and my hubby was amazed. I added a little more lemon for some extra kick.

This sauce was very good. The cayenne pepper is an interesting touch and adds just a touch of spiciness. Don't judge it before you eat it with the salmon!

Great flavor. I didn't have any cayenne and used 1 tablespoon mild green tabasco and 1/2 teaspoon red tabasco. I also minced a clove of garlic and sauteed in butter before adding flour. I misread it also and used 4 TABLEspoons! Had to add more butter, milk and lemon juice. Awesome once I had it back into the proper balance.

I've been looking for a good simple seafood sauce for a long time and this is it.  It's not too rich, not too fattening and is very quick to make.  We served it with salmon patties and this will be a staple in our house from now on.

This is a great topping for salmon or tuna patties. I've also used it on my salmon loaf. If I have any fresh dill on hand, I'll add it for a change of pace.

Very good!  I added dill, like some suggested, and it was really good!  I'm anxious to try it on some other foods.

I halved this recipe and still found the amount more than adequate for 2 cups of salmon.  I did double the lemon juice for an extra kick.  This made the simple salmon patties a "real meal".

I wasn't that enthralled with this sauce.  I thought it was quite sour, and had a "floury" texture.  I added about a tsp of sugar, which SORT of helped, but I wasn't really sure what to do to improve it.  I liked the cayenne pepper in it.

I used this sauce over grilled chicken with garden rice pilaf.  I added a little more lemon, plus added 1/4 minced garlic to the butter.  The sauce was smooth and tasty...I will make it again.

Sorry, but I have to agree with other reviewers.  This particular recipe needs "something else".  I felt it was quite bland tasting.  I used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh - could that be a factor?  Maybe some fresh herbs is what this recipe needs to perk it up.

This was good, but I found 2 T of lemon juice to make it just too tart.  I would use one T then do a taste test.

It was ok.   Fairly mild.  I probably prefer ketchup, but this is quick and classier.  I would add lemon zest or more lemon juice next time.  Good, thick consistency.

Pretty good - a bit on the floury side.  I will try with less flour next time. I added 1 small minced garlic to the butter in the pan, then added pepper at the end, with a little less cayenne than called for.

It didn’t have very much lemon taste and looked more like gravy.  I added yellow food coloring to make it look a little more lemony just to pretty it up.  If I made it again I would probably need to add a little more lemon juice for the flavor.

I tried this recipe to go with the Oregon salmon patty recipe from this site and I was really disappointed. It tasted more like a béchamel sauce. I could not get the flour taste out even after letting the butter and flour cook for awhile before adding the milk. It was very thick and ended up being bland. I even tried adding more lemon and cayenne.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The ratio of butter to flour is off.  There isn't enough butter to cook the flour.  Hence the floury taste.  I will try making it with a 1:1 ratio and giving the flour a chance to cook, a basic roux.

I have to update my review due to finding out more information regarding sauces.  The ratio of butter to flour isn't proper to cook out the flour taste and this is what causes it to become off balance.  Maybe the amount of butter was reduced for health purposes but it still needs more to allow the flour to cook out instead of becoming so clumpy.  It needs a bit less cayenne pepper and much more lemon juice.   My fiance liked the sauce stating that it tasted something along the lines of horseradish.  If you like that taste then he is correct, with some tweaking this could be good. If you are looking for a light and lemony sauce, then this is not it.  I would take the effort to tune up this recipe for him but would never make this for myself again.

This was great and super easy....ingredients that anyone would already have in the kitchen.

I don't like a lot of spice, but I might add more cayenne pepper next time.

Like others noted, I also added garlic to the butter.

Delicious -- thanks for sharing!

This was an incredibly simple and incredibly tasty sauce. I'm not much for spicy so instead of the cayenne pepper I added in some garlic powder, and it turned out better than I imagined it would be. I will definitely be making this again!

This was a great sauce: quick, easy and used ingredients that I already had in the pantry! I did add ¼ teaspoon of garlic powder for a little extra taste. I drizzled it over salmon fillets with white rice and broccoli and cauliflower. Perfect addition to a healthy meal.

I must have done something wrong, but can't figure out what.  The sauce was very bland, even though I added more lemon juice, and it was also quite thick, more like a chicken cream gravy...I even added more milk. Will try again with more tweeking.

This was an excellent sauce for my salmon loaf. The only thing I measured was the milk. I wanted more lemon flavor so added the juice of one lemon. My son thought the lemon was too strong. I liked it like that but next time I may tone it down a bit. I was skepical about the cayenne pepper but I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was gross.  It tasted like flour with a hint of lemon.  It was too thick, so I added a 1/4 cup more milk - still this didn't help.  I should have heeded the 4 Tablespoons of flour as a warning, because I use 6 Tablespoons of flour when I make my cream of brocolli soup.  Sorry for the bad rating, but this isn't a good recipe.

This sauce was perfect.  Next time I'll put yellow food dye like another reviewer stated and a little more lemon juice and cayenne.

this was just okay for me. only because i think i was expecting something , maybe sweeter. also, i used it for scallops. just a little too lemony for my taste. great consistancy though. will try again with less lemon juice.

Hmmm,what can I say about this recipe. I guess I can say one thing. It is the foundation to some good gravy, but the recipe alone it lacked flavor in my opinion. So to spice it up I added; 1 chicken boullion cube, 1/2 lemon slices, then I finished it off with a little lemon season salt and WALAH!!! some real good gravy, that not only taste good but looks good on your favorite dishes. So I am going to give this recipe a 3 for good effort.

I must have done something wrong because the sauce turned out very bland with a heavy flour taste.

I liked that I could use milk instead of cream, which I didn't have on hand.  I added more lemon juice, left out the cayenne and added it to some spaghetti and leftover salmon and just mixed it all together.  Great last minute meal.

I used this sauce on some salmon patties and it was very good.  It would work well for all types of white fish.

This recipe turned out really yummy.  It is a little rich, but all the ingrediants balance out really well.  I also added some basil and garlic to it.  I will make this again!
