This did not work for me at all, unfortunately.  The sugar and extract would not set and I ended up throwing it out.

This was a great recipe, but I found that adding about 1/6 c. of water helped to form the dough.

These were ok.  Personally I liked them, but my friends and family weren't thrilled.  I also do not like the idea of uncooked egg whites in the recipe.  The texture is kind of different and hard to get used to.  It's not solid or chewy...it's creamy and powdery combined.

i really liked this recipe, but i find it is even better when you replace the peppermint extract with vanilla extract. I also add about a teaspoon of water to the mixture to make it more manageable.

Very good recipe, after I took the suggestion of adding water. Without the water, it was nothing but a powdery mess. I also dipped these in white chocolate, which made a really pretty presentation.

The candy mixture was difficult to work with. The recipe suggests that this makes 12 servings. The peppermint flavor was so strong that I formed patties about the size of a half dollar and the recipe served 30. The candy tastes better when dipped in chocolate.

These were good but they tasted mostly like mint-flavored powdered sugar.  They were much much better when dipped completely in semi-sweet chocolate.

These are candies! Not cookies, obviously! They are like the little pastel mints in the bowl at old-time restaurants.  On your way out of the restaurant, you would take a few using a little spoon to lift them out.  They are supposed to be powdery on the bite and with a bit of light sugar crust on the outside. I can’t believe they are being rated as a cookie!  I needed tablespoon of water and it can help when shaping them. (It’s not an exact science-egg whites are all different volumes, and we all live in different climates and altitudes!)

Turned out fine, just like I remember them as a child. Fella confessed afterwards he doesn't like peppermint so I won't be making them again!

Wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Was more like a breath mint than a cookie or anything else I've ever made. Could taste powdered sugar alot.

Excellent. I even covered them in melted semi sweet chocolate and give them out as Valentine's gifts. Everyone loved them and so did I...
