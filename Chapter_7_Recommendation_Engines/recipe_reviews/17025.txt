Here is the secret...#1 Use Sweet Baby Ray's HONEY BARBEQUE SAUCE, and you won't need any additional sweetness, #2 Use CRUSHED PINEAPPLE INSTEAD OF CHUNKS, and #3 Use Boneless Chicken Thigh meat or dark meat.  I used thigh meat, and chopped into cubes oh and i used the red onions instead of yellow, and i doubled the peppers and added red and orange peppers also and about 5 min before i served it, i added 2 bunches of chopped green onions to the pot and served with chicken fried rice asian sides.  It was awesome!

This is a tasty meal however it can not be cooked for 8-9 hours in a slow cooker on the lowest setting, I've burned it twice!  It does cook well for 4-6 hours.

I was hesitant to make this because of the mixed reviews. The ingredients sounded so good, though, that I decided to give it a chance. I'm very glad I did -- it turned out great. I used four chicken breasts, one bottle of Dave's Fire Pitt BBQ sauce, and a small can of crushed pineapple, as well as the garlic, peppers, and onions. I cut the cooking time down to six hours, which I think is the key to this recipe. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and I served it over rice. My boyfriend loved it as well -- he added some pepperjack cheese on top of his. I'll be making this again!

This was so good but I did make some changes:
Used a whole chicken, cut in serving pieces and skinned (left the bones in).  The dark meat cooked an hour longer (4 hours on hi) than the breasts (a little more than 3 hours on hi). For the sauce, I used 
About 1 ½ bottles of Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce, 18 oz each
2/3 of a 18 oz bottle of Sweet and Sour Sauce
Bottled Szechwan Sauce to taste, about 3 tablespoons (it’s spicy).
In the cuisinart chopped 
About 7 cloves garlic w about 2 ½ large thumb size pieces of ginger and added to sauce.
Used more vegetables than suggested and added carrots to the mix.
½ of the vegetables went into the pot with the dark meat and the other ½, minus the green peppers, went in with the light meat an hour later.  The last hour I added the green peppers and  about 3 or 4 tablespoons of sugar to taste.  About 15 minutes before serving,I added cornstarch mixed with the leftover pineapple juice.  It was SO GOOOOOD!  If you want to cook on low I would suggest not cooking breast meat more than 6 or 7 hours.  I have a Rival Crockpot.  THANKS TO ALL THE NOTES AND ADVICE that helped  so much!!

The family asks for this every week! I did make a few change the first time to what I had on hand. Instead of chicken, I used 2 lbs of beef sasuage, 2 16 oz packages of frozen pepper and onion mix. (Our Kroger grocery store carries this in the Kroger brand and it has red, yellow and green peppers with onions.)I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. One bottle of the regular and one bottle of the Honey Chipotle - adds a nice kick. I serve it over jasmine rice. I serve this dish 2-3 times a month (the family would like more often!) so its nice to be able to use the sausage as well as the chicken. Thank you for this dish!

Excellent!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and cut the recipe to 4 breasts, 1 bottle of BBQ sauce, and left the other ingredients as listed.  We loved it over rice!  Thickened the sauce with cornstarch as other reviewers suggested.  A keeper!

very good but I drained the pineapple and kept the pineapple in the fridge and chopped the peppers and kept them in the fridge  until 1 hr. before the chicken was done. Then added it. It just maintains the pineapple and peppers from getting too mushy.

I used a real thick bbq sauce, but the sauce ended up real thin, so I just added the reserved pineapple juice,  a bit water and about 4 T. of flour, and it came out perfect consistency.  Next time will use more veggies:)

This recipe rocks!  It has quickly become a favorite at our house.  I use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and the combo of flavors with the pineapple is even yummier than I expected.

I used pineapple slices instead of the chunks.  I used "Bullseye" Brand barbecue sauce.  It was delicious!  Smelled good while cooking too!

Sweet and Simple. We like that. The best part of this was coming home after work to a nice meal. My man felt that the worst part was coming home early and the wonderful aroma greeting him before it was ready. 

I added some of the pineapple juice to this and wish I had added more of the onions and peppers.

Was a bit hesitant after the mixed reviews but this turned out well, good for an easy midweek meal. Husband really enjoyed it and has asked for it again.  Only used 2 chicken breasts and 1/4 a bottle of bbq sauce. Added the juice from the can of pineapple and for a little kick some dried chilli flakes.  Did not need to thicken with cornstarch, just turned the slowcooker to high and left the lid off for the last hour of cooking and that did the job.

I really like this recipe, and my husband likes and frequently asks for it. Here's what stops me from making it all the time- after even 4 hrs.- boneless/skinless chicken breast dries out. Also our crock pot is pretty big, meant for large crowds. Instead I use my dutch oven on the stove to cook it up and all the while I watch the time for about an hour and it works wonderful. A great combination of flavors and textures!

Thought this was good but lacked the tang.  I agree with others that the sauce is too thin.  I dissolved about 1/2 cup cornstarch in 1/2 cup vinegar and added it at the end, with the crockpot on high.  That gave the thickness and tang I was looking for.  Also, FYI, I used skinless, bone-in chicken thighs and it was so great.

This was in my inbox today so I decided to give it a shot ... with my few changes based on all the other reviews. I used 4 frozen boneless chicken breasts that I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and Accent. I mixed a bottle of Kraft Honey Roasted Garlic BBQ sauce, one onion quartered, 3 slices of fresh ginger julienned, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, a pinch of red pepper flakes a tsp of dijon and half the juice of a can of pineapple. I dipped the chicken in this sauce before I poppped into the crock, then poured the remaining sauce over  it. I started it on high for about half an hour then reduced to low. I cooked it for about 5 hours total. In the last 30-45 min I added about half the can of pineapple, and nice sized chunks of half each red, green and yellow peppers. I mixed the remaining half can of pineapple juice with 1/2 tbls of cornstarch and added that when I added the vegetables. I served it over rice. My husband and 21 yr old son rated it "have again". My 28 yr old son thought it was ok: didn't love it, didn't hate it ... but had seconds. It had a nice layersof flavorl with a final note of heat. The sauce could have been a tad bit thicker but I was overly cautious with only half can of juice.   I was thinking this would be great with orange juice concentrate rather than pineapple juice, (omitting the fruit then too).

This was really very good!  I used a President's Choice spicy BBQ sauce and--yippee--this dish had bite!  My husband, who normally asks for the hot sauce after tasting a new recipe, was pleasantly surprised and ate happily, exactly as I served it.  The chicken (6 boneless, skinless breasts) was wonderfully moist and exceptionally flavorful...but not too moist for my tastes (I much prefer dry as cotton chicken, ha ha, but have to accomodate my husband who prefers it very moist) I added 1/2 a red and 1/2 a green pepper for color, as well as grated some fresh ginger into the slow cooker half an hour before dinner was served.  Ohh, and I added 5 cloves of garlic too--we're garlic addicts.  Next time, I will add all the pineapple juice at the beginning but NOT the pineapple chunks until half an hour before serving, just to retain the pineapple's color and crunch.  I may also add 1/4 each of red and green peppers at that time, just to spruce up the visual appeal because all the ingredients sort of took on the BBQ color.  I will also add diced bits of ginger next time rather than grated...we love ginger!  Maybe some carrot 'coins' as well an hour before serving so they aren't too mushy.  My parents, unexpected guests for the weekend, both gave this recipe rave reviews even though my Mom is not a fan of too much spice.  Thanks for sharing this recipe--it's definitely sweet and tangy!  :)  (Served with spanish rice and caesar salad...next time I'll serve it with buttered noodles or ma

This dish was very easy to make and quite flavorful.  I used: chicken breast cut into chunks; bullseye Honey Mustard BBQ sauce; about 7 cloves of garlic sliced; 1 green pepper and one onion.  I seasoned with normal seasonings and set placed all mixed together in the fridge overnight.  It cooked for about 6 hours on low and was just at the brink of being a little dry.  I will probably cook for about 5 hours next time.  Thanks for the post.

Awesome!  My husband saw me throwing everything in the crock pot, saw the pineapple, and refused to eat it...in fact, requested that I not throw in a breast so he could make his OWN supper...but it smelled so good he couldn't resist a bite, and then had 2 servings and took dibs on the leftovers! LOL Served it over rice and all 3 kids loved it too. Left out the bell pepper since now of the kids like it, and used some dehydrated sweet pepper flakes instead (what they don't know doesn't hurt them, right?) Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

USE LESS BARBEQUE SAUCE, With a a few minor adjustments this was a great recipe. I took a few suggestions from other reviews and this is how I did it. First I only used 4 chicken breasts and one bottle of BBQ Sauce, but next time I think I might only use 1/2 the sauce. I did use a whole can of pineapple and most of the juice. The onion, pepper, and garlic I did according to the recipe. I did add water chestnuts, and would consider adding more veggies next time. My husband really liked it too, but said seasoning the chicken first would have made it better. I also only cooked it for 5 hours or so (cutting up the chicken after 4 hours) and the chicken was cooked perfectly in that time. I served it over rice and will surely make it again.

This was just okay - don't think we will make it again.  The BBQ takes over and you really couldn't taste any of the other ingredients.

Very good! I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, 1 can of pineapple chunks drained, 3 chicken breasts, 1 yellow pepper,1 green pepper and 1 1/2 onions. Within 4 hours it was done. I served it over brown rice. I like this recipe because you can add more or less vegetables depending on what your family likes.

First off I am a novice and loved this recipe for its ease and delicious taste! Read many of the reviews before I decided a course of action. It was a ninety degree day but i wanted a special meal for a birthday dinner and that's what I got. Put five plump chicken breasts in the crock pot on high with 1 18 oz. bottle of original Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and the juice from a 15 oz. can of crushed pineapple and some garlic. At four hours I shredded chicken added 3 peppers: green, yellow, and red, with some carrots. Along with the crushed pineapple from one can, I also added about a half of another mix of sauce and pineapple juice,feeling more sauce was needed with the addition of the veggies. The taste was delish, a nice balance of all ingredients and a recipe that would be tasty with just the meat. We all had seconds! (Used new six and a half quart crockpot.) Total cook time was five hours on high.

Good recipe. I only did a couple of things slightly different. Total cooking time was only 5 hours. After 4 hours I took the chicken out and shred it and then put it back in for the final 1 hour. We had it over white rice and was just as good warmed up the next night.

This was pretty good. Definitely can't cook longer then 6-7 hours, it would be too long. We used a Sweet baby rays (honey) bbq and chunk pineapple. Because of the sweet bbq sauce, I added a hot pepper with the other peppers and a dash of red pepper flakes to even it out. Our sauce was a good consistancy, as we used a whole bottle bbq, small can of pineapple for 3 chicken breasts. Served with rice. Will make again!

Very good!  I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  I cooked the chicken for 6 hours, as I saw many others had done, and it was perfect!  Would have been very dry if I had followed the recipe instructions for 9 hours.

Used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ as so many reviews suggested.  I halfed the recipe and used 1/2 the can of pineapple chunks and juice.  My husband w/ a major sweet tooth said it was almost too sweet and would be better next time w/ regular bbq sauce.  Other than that we thought it was great, the kids (2 & 4) both gobbled it up.  Served over jasmine rice, added pineapple chunks, red pepper, carrots and pea pods 1 hour before finishing.  Will make again.

My family loved this.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory BBQ sauce and followed the directions.  My chicken was done after 6 hours of cooking on low.  It was delicious served over rice.  This will go in my crock-pot rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

This chicken was very moist.  I did use about 4 lbs of thighs and drum sticks since I needed to use them up. I used a 40 oz bottle of bbq sauce and I believe an 18 or 20 oz bottle would have been enough. It made a LOT of sauce. Otherwise, this is very good. I did cook it for 8 hours and some of my chicken was slightly frozen. Will do this again. Thanks Jan from another Jan!

I think it is a great easy recipe.  I did not make any changes and it turned out great.  I chopped the bell peppers and onions in large chunks so my son could easily pick them out.  I served it over rice and it's great because there is alot of sauce.  Yummy!

Very simple.  I used 4 good sized chicken breasts, which i used just salt.  I found they were moist/tender and cooked in about 2 1/2 hrs(on Low).  I removed them and thicken the sauce with corn starch and continued to cook it on high for abot 10 minutes more.  I turned off my slow cooker and put the chicken back in to absorb more flavor.  I think this would work good in a sandwich.  My husband liked alot, too.

This recipe was super easy to make. My kids loved it which is a huge plus. Next time I would changes it by cutting back on the BBQ sauce a bit and adding more veggies...I think chopped carrots would go well with this meal. Also, 5 hours on LOW setting was plenty of time for this to cook. Any longer and the chicken would have been too dry. Over all, a good recipe and I will make it again. Thanks!

Ladies and Gents don't give up on this recipe.  Put the veggies in the crockpot first.  Place chicken on top.  Use a thicker BBQ sauce which you like and don't use so much.  Add a little low-salt soy sauce as few did to the BBQ sauce to your taste.  Set sauce to the side.  Lower the cooking time and when the veggies are slightly tender and chicken still juicy ladle off some of the juice and reserve. Add the BBQ sauce to the pot.  Stir a little corn starch in the cooled reserved juice and pour into the pot and thicken.  It is very good.  I do realize that tastes very and this may not be for some but we sure enjoyed it.  Hope this helps.

Very easy & tasty.  I love the combination of the spicy bbq & sweet pineapple.  I halved the recipe, using only 2 whole breasts.  I also sliced & added one carrot.  Mine was well done after about 5 hrs on low in the crockpot.

Kids loved it!  I used one bottle of barbeque sauce with the meat alone for about 3 hours in the crockpot, then added one green bell pepper and a can of pineapple chunks.  I added about 1/2 cup of water with the barbeque sauce.  I served this over couscous and my family loved it!  My ten year old (who hates leftovers) heated it up again for lunch the next day.  Great recipe and SOOO SIMPLE!!

Excellent.  Didn't change any ingredients.  But I don't think it needs to cook for 9 hours.  Turned my crock pot to warm for 2 hours.

Too sweet. I rinsed the stew after trying my first plate because 2 bottles of BBQ sauce was way too much. I added one red and one green pepper and one onion. Next time (if there is a next time), I'd add more garlic as well. One bottle of sauce may be enough but the combo of all of the sauce and the sweetness of the pineapple was not good. After eating leftovers for two different meals, I trashed the rest. Would not recommend this recipe.

This was my first attempt at cooking with a slow cooker. After reading other reviews, I opted for 4 hours instead of 8; the chicken was tender enough to cut with a fork, and the pineapple chunks retained their color. My favorite aspect of the dish was the peppers/onions/pineapple and liquid over the rice. Slicing the chicken a bit before cooking it will allow it to soak up more of those flavors as well. Lastly, I second other reviewers' recommendation of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. Their original flavor is my favorite to begin with, and it didn't disappoint in this recipe.

I used teriyaki/soy sauce from Trader Joes. I didn't have any BBQ sauce. Over rice it was delicious. We also reduced cooking time to under 7 hours. First 2 hours on high and 5 hours on low.

This was very easy to throw together on my lunch hour, however, the taste was too barbequey.  I would probably make something similar again in a slow cooker but with my own tried and true sweet and sour sauce recipe.

This is one of our families favorite meals!  Here are the changes I made: 8 trimmed chicken breasts, 2 bottles of spicy bbq sauce, 2 cans pineapple chunks, 2 T. dried minced onion, 2 t. dried minced garlic and because we don't like peppers we add 1 1/2 cups chopped carrots and cook for only 4-5 hours.  I serve this over brown rice and it has always been a huge hit even when entertaining guests!

My Boyfriend loved this recipie, I thought it was so-so. We did use the Sweet Baby Rays brand Honey BBQ sauce as many reviews sugested, as well as crushed pineapple. I'm on the fence about this dish...maybe I will use less green pepper next time? Can't put my finger on what I'm not digging...

Mixed reviews on this.  One liked and two less than liked.  It wasn't bad just wasn't real good.  Personally I like spicy food so that was the problem for me.

This was excellent! i cut the serving size down to two, since it's only my husband and I, and added some taco seasoning to give it a little kick. I think the cook time is a little over the top - mine was ready in about 4 1/2 hours.  Overall, this was a great meal and just as good the next day (leftovers)!

this worked very well.. used sweet baby ray's original bbq sauce. I about doubled the pineapple because I liked it. I covered the chicken in a baking dish and just baked at 350 for about 40 minutes, turned out perfectly.

This was really good, the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that the sauce was pretty thin.  I will make this again but try some of the suggestions for thickening the sauce next time I do.

I also made this with less BBQ sauce and it made plenty. I was afraid the Sweet BBQ sauce would be too sweet so I used HEBs new Texas Specialty series which has pretty good heat in it.  One 14 oz bottle with 8 boneless, skinless thighs to reduce calories and fat worked well.  Based on reviews, I added some ginger and served this over Jasmine rice.  Its a keeper!

WOW!  I used a left-over gallon size zip lock bag of Thanksgiving turkey from the freezer instead of chicken, pineapple chunks (next time I'll use crushed), half a medium onion, and one bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  No garlic or peppers on hand.  This recipe would work well with pork (for pulled pork sandwiches) or beef.  Sounds weird, but you have to try it.  It's stupid easy!

This was good but the sauce was a bit strong in flavor.  I know it's determined by what sauce you use and I used a teriyaki BBQ which I thought would be perfect but ended up being really spicy/sweet if that makes sense.  I think I'd try to dilute it next time.  Just a note; your veggies will take on the brown color after cooking in the liquid for so long.  To keep a bright color on them I think you need to quick cook them and maybe add them in last.  I like the idea of throwing everything in one pot though... That's why slow cooking apeals to me  Easy peasy...

I'm a single guy and I use my crock pot on th weekends to generate leftovers for lunches during the week.  I think I'm going to be eating a lot of Subway this week.  This recipe seems like a great starting point, but the finished product  definitely needs something.  The promised 'hawaiian flair' from the pineapple is completely overpowered by the bbq sauce taste.  When the author said this was tangy, they  weren't kidding, as the sauce is so tangy it borders on being downright sour.  I was expecting a bit more sweet and balanced flavor.  On the positive side, the chicken came out very nice and tender as did the veggies.  I will use a slotted spoon to separate the food from the sauce and reuse the chicken meat and veg in a simple stirfry.

Definitely need to use a thick bbq sauce!  We like Famous Daves Texas Pit-it's thick and spicy.  It's great served over whole wheat couscous. A favorite at our house!

This tasted amazing!  I added a red and yellow pepper, and used 12 chicken breasts instead of 8 and there was plenty of sauce to spare. Cooked on low for about 7 hours.  I will be making this again for sure!

IF I make this again, I will reduce the cooking time to about 7 hours instead of 9.  My chicken turned out a bit dry.  The sauce was very flavorful, but runny.  I added some cornstarch to it to thicken it up.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce (about 1 and 1/2 bottles)

love it! I always half the recipe and use Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce. after its done, I take chicken out and pull it, its shreds so easily, and put it all back in the suce for about 30 more minutes. Usually serve over brown rice, left overs are great for bbs chick pizza, or on crusty rolls with sauted onions and melted cheese

This did not go over well in my family. It had an acidy taste. The only thing I left out was the green pepper because I didn't have any, but I don't think that would have made it a whole lot different. I also think it was too much onion. I will have to tweak it and find a taste that we might  like but I will not be making this again in it's current form.

I made this last night for dinner and it was great. I cooked it on high for 4 hours instead of low for 8 due to not having enough time and it still came out awesome. Everyone in my family that tried it, loved it. The chicken is so tender it just comes apart with a fork. We will definitely be making this again, and it's so easy to make too.

We loved this recipe.  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to read the reviews.  After trying the recipe, I would add more peppers and onion.  I had really big chicken breasts and four of them.  They cooked for 8 hours and were perfect.  I served it with white rice and it was wonderful with lots of yummy juice.

I cooked this last night, and woke up this morning to great smells in my kitchen :) - BUT... I would agree that 9 hours is too long. The barbecue sauce smelled a little burnt when it was all done and the chicken is too dry... I prepared it and cooked it exactly as instructed. Next time I will try a shorter cooking time on Low - perhaps 5 hours?... I am using Hamilton Beach Programmable Slow Cooker (6 quart) - Model 33967. ---   Came back to edit this... it turns out that I stupidly forgot the Pineapple! - sorry - I'm new at this.... I guess that I DIDN'T follow the instructions... So I will try it again with all ingredients, but still, I think that I'll try 6 or 7 hours instead of 9...

This was definitely a hit! The only difference is that I only used one bottle of sauce and didn't use all of the pineapple, but did add some of the juice.

I, personally, could not get enough of this sauce!  However, my family classified this as "just barbeque chicken."  I did thicken the sauce with corn starch - and that really helped.  (Remember to dissolve your corn starch in a little cold water before adding to sauce.)  I will definitely make this again, because as far as barbeque chicken goes, this was pretty good!

We are in the final stages of a "down to the bare studs" kitchen remodel. Throughout I've been really uncomfortable handling raw meat, especially chicken because of the less than ideal clean up facilities. But we are SO sick of packaged microwave food and going out that I finally broke down. I thought traditional barbecue sauce might be a bit too overpowering so I used Yoshida's Hawaiian Sweet and Sour Sauce/Marinade. 15 minutes before serving I tossed some sugar snap peas and some cooked rice into the slow cooker. I ended up with a welcome "real" meal all in one pot that I wouldn't mind even when I have a fully functioning kitchen. Thanks Jan, for an easy slow cooker meal that's not just 3 cans of cream of "something" soup plus meat! I would give the dish a 4 but my husband wasn't a fan, so it's a 3.

This is my first crock pot meal.   I followed the directions exactly, except set it to high for several hours then turned it down to low, because I didn't have 9 hours.   Anyhow, it was a big hit!!   I made it for several other friends and we all enjoyed it.   We were away on a girls weekend and the aroma teased us all day!  I Can't wait to make it for my family now.

Was pretty good.  I scaled down the recipe  for 4 people and cooked it on low for 8 hours.  That was a bit too long.  I'd say cook for 6.5 to 7 hrs.  Plus, you have to watch the overcooking because all the sugar from the pineapple juice will burn.  But otherwise I will try it again and shorten the cooking time.

I thought this was excellent!  I used a habanero based BBQ sauce (made by Tastefully Simple) and since I didn't have green pepper, I sliced up some red pepper.  Also threw in a dash of cayenne and sprinkled some crushed red pepper.  Very easy, and the chicken was delicious and tender!  Will make again for sure!

The chicken was very moist.  The sauce was a little too salty and thin.

Sorry, but this was really, really bland.  The chicken was nice and moist, but it literally tasted like nothing.

Pretty good!  I only made this once and used the cheapest BBQ sauce I could find.  It was good, flavorful, but could have been thicker.  Next time I will take the reserved pineapple juice, thicken it with cornstarch, and add it an hour before the end of the cooking time.

I followed the recipe exactly except for scaling back on all the ingredients because I only made two chicken breasts. I left it in the slow cooker for 9 hours on low, the chicken was so moist and tender it fell apart! For all those changing everything, it's unnecessary; it tastes great as is. I served it over rice and my husband and I loved it! This will be in our rotation for sure.

This was tasty.  I put in 8 frozen boneless chicken breasts and set the slow cooker on low and cooked them for 5.5 hours and everything was perfectly cooked.  I didn't use 2 full bottles of sauce, just 1.5 and there was still lots of sauce leftover.  My fiance says this is a definite must for another time.

Five Stars because the whole family LOVED it.  Even the picky eaters had seconds and thirds.  Used one bottle of Sweet Baby Rays, 2 cans of pineapple chuncks, (one with the juice, one drained).  6 chicken breasts.  Cooked 4 hours on low, then turned to warm for 3 more hours.....perfect.  Served over white rice.

I tried this recipe today and it was fantastic! My whole family enjoyed it. It was pretty simple to put together, as it cooked in my slow cooker the wonderful aroma of barbecue sauce had everyone saying "That smells delicious", and when we had it over rice today, everyone cleaned their plates, and wanted more.

I only kept in crock pot for hours, any more and it would have been overdone.  Next time I'll use less bbq sauce, it was a bit overpowering.  I cut up the chicken and put it all over rice.  Kids called it chinesse food.  My husband suggested adding water chestnuts-we'll try that next time.

The sauce was very tasty - however 8 hours in the crockpot was too long.  The chicken was definately overcooked.

I halved the recipe and found the one bottle of BBQ sauce to be just fine-not too much liquid at all.  I added more orange and yellow bell peppers.  I shredded the chicken after it was done and served this dish over rice.

Very easy to make.  I cut the recipe down to 4 breats and was told to use 1 bottle of BBQ sauce, it was to much in my opion, so if only doing 4 only half a bottle of BBQ.  Would make again

DELICIOUS!!!  If I could give this more than 5 stars, I certainly would.  Followed recipe ingredients as given; simply reduced the amount of chicken by half (4 pieces instead of 8), and used only one bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce, leaving the other ingredient amounts as stated.  This is DEFINITELY a keeper.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was a little too sweet and tangy for us.  I cooked mine on low for 6 hours, with frozen breasts to start.  I was thrilled with the chicken - not overdone in the crockpot!  But, the onions were too crisp for me, and I think the fact that they didn't melt into the sauce was what was missing.

This was delicious.  Even my picky husband who's not a huge fan of chicken breast loved it.  I cut everything in half except I still used a whole can of pineapple, and I didn't have a bell pepper.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce and served over white rice.  Definitly will become a regular recipe in my house

I made this with 3 chicken thighs....I skinned them before I cooked them...I barely used a cup of BBQ sauce and used a whole 8oz can of crushed pineapple...I fixed it in my 1.5 qt crockpot and they were done in 2 hrs. and 45 min...

This was very tasty. I only needed 4 hours cooking time on the low setting for my slow cooker. I added the green pepper and onion after 2 hours so they wouldn't be so mushy. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this dish to dinner guest.

Just finished up cleaning the crockpot from this recipe. My husband gave it 5 stars and wished he could give more.  We cooked on low for 6 hours. Added ginger, bag of frozen chopped peppers and onions. Didn't crush the pineapple but did drain. Cut up 1 chipotle pepper.  Plenty of sauce!  I would suggest  18 oz bottle for 6 chicken breast.  Definitely sweet so go ahead and spice it up. It will be great.  Definitely a keeper.  Will try a bolder BBQ sauce next time.  Served over brown rice made it a perfect meal!  chicke was so tender and moist!

Delicious! I used Sweet Baby Rays honey bbq sauce and this really tasted a lot like sweet and sour chicken. I halved the recipe,cooked 3 large breast and it all got eaten.I served it with Rice A Roni chicken flavored rice.My husband mentioned several times how good it was so definitely a keeper. Thanks!

loved the pineapples! they were flavorful, and gave the recipie a mild sweet kick. i also put hot sauce, onions and bell peppers into the cooker because it seemed like the right thing to do. I cooked it for a little get together and everyone liked it. will cook this one again

Was not really happy with this recipe,the only change I made was to use crushed pineapple instead. The chicken came out nice and tender but the sauce just tasted like BBQ.

This recipe is great and can also be made with pre made meatballs (frozen)...It is an awesome appetizer...I serve the meatballs at parties...everyone raves about it...Also if you use a spicy bbq sauce it gives it a wonderful kick...Enjoy!!

This was absolutely delicious & a keeper. My family loved it. Poured rest of sauce over rice. I just used 1 bottle of BBQ sauce & that was enough.  Thanks Jan.

Way too sweet for a main course.  Be sure to serve it along side something salty, so that the sweet doesn't overwhelm.

I was a little worried after reading some reviews, but I liked the ingredient list and the ease of putting this together.  I did have to make a couple of adjustments - I didn't have 2 full bottles of sauce and the can of pinapple I bought was larger than called for.  But this was easy and really good.  Served over egg noodles.  Picky husband gave it a thumbs up!

I am so mad about this recipe right now.  I planned this to eat for two nights' worth of meals this week, plus lunches (lots of food-- expensive!) and when I got home today, I discovered the chicken on the bottom had pretty much burned. It infused the entire sauce, which I'm sure is very good normally, with a burnt taste, and of course the chicken was terrible.  I really don't think it was my Crock Pot or anything I did wrong.  I have a Rival, and I cooked it on low for 8 hours and warm for about 2.  I really think the recipe should have instructed to place some sauce on the bottom prior to placing the chicken.

This dish had a strange aroma when I came home from work. Even my kids said that it smelled "funky". I should've realized that onion don't go with pineapple but gave it chance after reading the great reviews. The onion was what made the "funky" smell. Maybe it should've been omitted?!?! Just my opinion. We ordered a pizza. Sorry :(

I love this recipe! It was the perfect amount of tangy and sweet, just like the name says - I added a half bag of frozen mixed yellow, red and green peppers, half bag of frozen onion, some ginger and some red pepper flakes - SO GOOD! Nice change from the usual slow cooker recipes! I served this over brown rice - this one is going in my recipe book!

Yum!!! This was so easy and flavorful. I love that you can easily change the flavor to your liking just by changing the BBQ sauce. We like using Sweet Baby Ray's. My whole family loves this recipe!

We really liked this a lot. Hubby said to add this to the rotation! I only used four chicken breasts, one bottle of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, but kept all other ingredients the same. Served over white rice. Yum!

This receipe is great!  My husband loved that it didn't taste like plain BBQ chicken. I used chicken breasts and cooked it on low for 7 hours. The chicken totally fell apart because it was so tender!  I added some minced ginger. I also added corn starch an hour prior to eating and it thickened up nicely. We ate it over white rice and it was delicious!  We will definately be having this again!

Very easy and tasty.  I use brown sugar  barbecue sauce and add carrots.  I also add cornstarch during the last hour or so to thicken the sauce and serve over rice.

This recipe turned out to be pretty good. I was looking for something very simple & easy to make, and figured I'd end up with a result that was cloyingly sweet with the bbq sauce in this, but that wasn't how it turned out. It was really quite good (especially over rice). Even my husband said he would say yes to making it again.  I used 3 bell peppers (red, orange, & yellow), 2 large onions, and 10-12 small whole (not crushed) garlic cloves. I chopped veggies into large dice. I also added 1.5 tsp of ground ginger, + 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. I used bone-in breasts. Cooked on HI for 5 hours, and the chicken was perfect. Result was exactly as titled: Sweet and tangy!

I just tasted this dish this morning after letting is slow cook for 9 hours.  It is DELICIOUS.  I cannot wait to eat it this evening.  I did use the Honey BBQ that was suggested and the crushed pineapples.  I am debating whether to pour this over rice as a meal or substitute the rice for something else.  All in all, I thought it was great.

This is a great recipe. I am a firefighter always looking for a easy to fix meal that will easily and cheaply feed 5 guys at a busy house.  I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  The one thing I did after looking at the other reviews was to watch the chicken while cooking.  I cooked mine only about 5 hours.  I have to say the guys were speechless while eating this and they can be some of the harshest critics.

This turned out tasteless. I used the correct ingredients, the right amounts, the right amount of time, and it burned on one side.

I thought it was GREAT!  Chicken was tender, and not dry.  I didn't have the bell pepper, onion or garlic, but just the BBQ sauce and pineapple was enough.  A little runny like other reviewers said, but I mixed the juice with rice.  I will use pineapple chunks next time, instead of crushed pineapple, but it was yummy!

I made this last night and it was a hit with my husband.  I halved the recipe and only used 3/4 of a bottle of BBQ sauce with no onion or pepper.  I added a little bit of teriyaki marinade.  Before adding the pineapple, I drained and saved the juice.  After cooking, I added 1/2 of the pineapple juice to make it a little sweeter.  Then it needed some cornstarch to thicken it up.  I ended up shreding the chicken and cooking it for another 1/2 hour then serving over rice.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't teriyaki-y enough to go with the rice, but not BBQ-y enough to go in a bun as sandwich meat.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe - it was a big hit. I did alter the cooking a bit - used 4 large frozen chicken breasts, one bottle of BBQ sauce, and one can of pineapple. I don't think I cooked it quite as long as suggested either (usually I check slow cooker meat early, just in case). I'll be making this again.

I thought this recipe was good and my husband and boys (6,5&1) liked it too.  I made a few changes - I didn't add the peppers, only used 1 bottle of bbq sauce (a sweet kind) and added 2 tbs. soy sauce, 1/4 tsp each of allspice, ginger, and ground mustard.  Like other suggestions, I added a little brown sugar and cornstarch at the end to thicken it up.  Yummy over rice!

This was a very easy recipe, but WAY too "saucy".  Next time, I would only add 1 bottle of BBQ sauce, and probably put in 2 cans of pineapple.  The sauce would also be better if it were thickened with some cornstarch.  My husband loved it, I thought it was a bit bland.

This is a great recipe!  Even my kids love it!  You can play around with the barbeque sauces and get the taste that you want.  I use a honey sauce so it isn't too spicy for my kids.

I thought this recipe was good with some help.  I used bone-in chicken parts and only used one bottle of sauce.  I think the sauce needs thickening, but othet than that, it was good.

This recipe was tasty, but the sauce burned and it made it look rather ugly.  It made tasty sandwiches, and it was easy.  But I think next time I'll add some water next time.

I was surprised that the chicken wasn't dry or overcooked considering the length of time in the cooker.  Very flavorful!  My husband loved it!

I thought this recipe sounded really good, but I didn't care for it much and neither did my husband. The chicken was dry, sauce was too thin, and the pineapples were gross. Too sour!!

WHat a terrible dish. I thought the ingredients looked good, so I tried it. Yuck! The sauce is horrible and the pineapple were even worse. A very expensive and dissapointing mistake to have made. Don't try this one.

The sauce turned out spectacular!  Next time I think I'll cook it a little less because the chicken came out a bit dry and brown around the edges. Once the cooking time is corrected this is an easy and tasty meal.

This is the first recipe I've tried from this website. I followed the recipe exactly except no garlic. This is also my first time using a slow cooker. I cooked the chicken on high for 5 hours. The flavor was amazing but the chicken was dry. Probably didn't need to cook for 5 hours.

Was skeptical because of the reviews but this is delish.  I salt & peppered chicken thighs & seasoned with a little garlic powder.  I also added about 2 tbsp of honey for a little extra sweetness.  I used a large yellow onion, 1 green pepper & 1 red pepper.  I also used sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce.  Definitely a keeper.  Oh and only cook on high for about 3.5 to 4 hrs.

Very yummy! The first time I made it, just regular BBQ sauce was too spicy for me, so the second time around I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ and it was perfect. I eliminated the onion and the garlic, added a red pepper, and used a large can of pineapple tidbits instead of chunks. My husband and I both loved it :-)

Yum!  Que sabroso!  I wanted MORE sauce!  (I'm not understanding how people thought there was too much sauce.)

I used every drop of two 18-oz bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and one can of crushed (not chunk) pineapple with all the juice.  I used 2 green peppers instead of one.  Garlic and red onion as directed.  I used 8 skinless boneless chicken thighs.  (My experience is that dark meat chicken is the best to use in a slow cooker.  Breasts dry out in a slow cooker.)  

I cooked it on low for 8 hours and it wasn't overcooked at all.  Perhaps that's because I used dark meat instead of breasts.  Dark meat cooks more slowly.

Served over rice.  Kids ages 11, 13 and 13 raved about it.

Next time, I will double all the ingredients except the chicken.  Like I said, I wanted more sauce!

Fantastic!! I made this recipe with (7) boneless, whole chicken breasts.  I used Kraft BBQ (1/2 original, 1/4 thick n spicy and 1/4 honey bbq) and a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe, and it turned out terrific -- very juicy and tender!!

This turned out delicious! I did have to leave the green bell pepper and onion out, because I was out of them at the time. I only had one bottle of bbq sauce so I added a half bottle of teriyaki 30 minute marinade with the bbq sauce. I will be making this again, but the exact way the recipe says!

I made this over the weekend and it was a huge hit with my mom and dad.  The one thing though I recommend is using a thick BBQ sauce.  I used a thin BBQ sauce called Montgomery INN I do believe...I had a coupon for 2 free bottles and this called for 2 bottles so I went and got it. This is very good sauce taste wise, but it's very thin.  I had to add some corn starch to thicken it up a bit.  But otherwise I followed the recipe to the T.  I didn't have garlic so I just used garlic powder and it taste great.  Reminded me of a Hawaiian dish.

Good, but nothing special.  WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE!!!! I would suggest 1 bottle of BBQ instead of 2. I would leave pineapple the same, but drain off the liquid, and I would add carrots and pea pods.  It was easy and tasty though..served with rice.

We liked this recipe, but I shortened the time in the crock pot ( but I halved the recipe).  I also used thighs.

The cook time is too long on this.  The chicken was dried out and the bbq sauce tasted burnt.  I will not make this in the crock pot again.  If I use the recipe again, I would just bake it in the oven for 45 minutes or so.

I really wanted to like this, but it was just sort of... eh. Not bad, certainly, but my family didn't just fall in love with it as so many previous reviewers had.   Here's what I did, that added up to nothing truly special: 1+ bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce (maybe about 1 1/3?), juice from a large can of crushed pineapple plus a bit of the fruit, lots of garlic and a bit of fresh ginger combined and added to crockpot with chicken straight away; as per the advice of others, I waited to add the remaining fruit and peppers (1/2 red, 1/2 green) until most of the cooking was done.  The flavor was ok, but I was disappointed that the chicken was kind of dry. I let it all cook for about 5 hours -- way less than the 8-9 stated in the original recipe, but still a bit longer than other reviewers suggested, because I had about 5 pounds of chicken going, so I thought it would take some time. Oh well!  Next time I make this -- and I will try again! -- I will *definitely* reduce the cooking time even more, or else start with frozen chicken breasts. Also, I think I'll try the pineapple CHUNKS, as originally stated, since the crushed just seemed to get lost in the sauce. I will probably add even more peppers and some other veg, to add some more color and different texture.  I'm going to hold onto this recipe, because it is OK, but I need to keep playing with it.

This turned out SO WELL! Changes: I used about 25 oz bbq sauce, a can of crushed pineapple, extra (frozen) green pepper, and 3 cloves garlic. The chicken was almost completely thawed so I was able to cook it for 3 or 3.5 hours on high and it turned out perfectly. Serve it with some brown rice - it sops up the juice and tastes so good.

This is a great recipe to make a simple sweet and sour chicken in a slow cooker.  I followed the recipe but cut the BBQ sauce down to one bottle, (I used Sweet Baby Ray's, my absolute fave), crushed pineapple, red onion and celery (no green pepper on hand).  Tasted great served over rice; definitely sweet and tangy!

I served this for Sunday dinner to my husband and step-daughter.  She asked me if I could rate the recipe, and I asked how many stars.  Definitely 5 she said.  It's a keeper!  My husband wanted to give it 10 stars!  I'll be making this again for sure!  I made it as written, but I did reduce the time to 6 hours on low.  I was wondering if the chicken was frozen for the 8 - 9 hours as recommended in the recipe.

This recipe is one of the best I ever made! Here's a few pointers..definitely do not need 2 bottles of bbq sauce that would way too much sauce, I used honey bbq sauce which I  think gives a great added flavor then regular bbq sauce and I spiced it up with red peppers too it doesn't need to be cooked for 8 to 9 hours you can cook it on high for 4 to 5 hours. Rice or Couscous made plain went really well with this because you have all the juice and flavors from the chicken that you don't need to add anything to the rice etc. I will definitely be making this for a long time! I got rave reviews and it goes great with Zinfandel as recommended!

My family really liked this but I wasn't 100% impresed, but I think it had more to do with the fact I don't like rice and chicken meals like this, so I wasn't a  huge fan. I made just as directed but I used thin sliced chicken breasts and they were sort of tough. Next time I'll use regular chicken breasts and I think they will turn out more tender.

This is one of the best crock pot recipes I've tried yet. I used the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce as others suggested but only needed about 1 and a half bottles. I used breast tenderloins because that's what I had on hand. Delicious!

Excellent and easy prep - my type of recipe! I did dissolve about 1/2 cup of corn starch in cold water and added to the last hour of cooking for a thicker sauce since mine turned out thinner than I liked.

Simple, delicious and versatile. We used thigh meat and after 7 hrs of slow cooking it comes right off the bone. Put in any veggies you want! With the pineapple and peppers I included snap peas and carrots. Serve it with a plain rice, like brown or jasmine; otherwise the fried rice flavors compete with the tangy chicken.

Flavorful! I made this recipe today but used drumsticks instead of chicken breasts and also added 1/4 c. brown sugar. Just the right amount of sweetness. As another reviewer suggested, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ and didn't cook the full 8-9 hours as instructed.  The meat was cooked and practically falling off the bone at 6 hours on low. Will definitely be making this again!

This was good! I modified the recipe to one 28 oz bottle of BBQ sauce, 1/2 white onion, and 4 chicken breasts. It produced plenty of sauce for the chicken. The combo of BBQ sauce and pineapple is delicious!

I used the recipe as given, I think I will not make so much sauce (less juice from the pineapple maybe). My husband loved it, and my fussy 6 year old daughter even gave it a thumbs up! Tender and moist chicken, found it a bit bland over plain white rice.. maybe do some seasoned fries on the side next time.

Very good flavor.  I made this for my son to pack in his school lunch and for me to take to work.  It reheats wonderfully.  Served with rice, the sauce is perfect.  I only cooked it for about 5 hours though after reading other comments about others burning, it came out just right.  I may add some red peppers to it next time for a little more kick.  Very good, will be making again!!

This was a big hit with our family. My 6 year old loved the chicken on a roll as a sandwich. 
I used Sweet baby Ray's honey bar-b-que sauce and pineapple tidbits. 
I did use cornstarch to thicken to the sauce.
Oh, and I used frozen chicken breast and frozen red/green/yellow pepper mix from Trader Joe's. Easy Easy Easy!
Yummy!

Super easy and I had the ingredients on hand, but my slow cooker BROKE when I tried to turn it on (with all ingredients inside) so I put them in a casserole and put them in the fridge till later. I baked it covered at 350* for 1 hour and it came great. Probably would have been even better for just 1 hour. I used 5 breasts, about 18 oz of Jack Daniels bbq sauce and 1/3 of a 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks. I'll try crushed pineapple next time. My mom really liked it too and she isn't much of a chicken person.

I really loved this recipe. I'm pretty new to cooking, so it was super easy. I made this after getting off of night shift, and woke up to a delicious smelling kitchen.
I also used the crushed pineapple instead, it turned out great!!

I used a hickory barbeque sauce and I wouldn't recommend it. It had a very smoky flavor which seemed an odd combination with the sweet pineapple. Don't think I'll make this again...

Well... I am sad to say that I'm not typically a picky person, but I really didn't like this chicken. I don't know if it was the BBQ sauce I chose (honey) or what, but the flavor was unappealing and the chicken was dry after the 9 hours. I won't be cooking this again. Maybe it was BBQ sauce?

Overall ok. I made this today, used 6 boneless thighs, bottle and a half of Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce, 1 garlic clove, and a little over half a can of crushed pineapple. Wanted to throw vidalia onion in there but was running late for work so all I had time to do was sprinkle a bit of onion powder. Silly me also forgot my slow cooker liner so there was a slight burnt taste to the sauce. I think the liner would have helped. I cooked on low for 8 hours and it was a tad dry but fell apart nicely. We didn't like it much with rice. Would probably try this again, add more garlic, less of the juice from the pineapple, and serve with redskin potatoes. Definitely has potential to be tweaked to ones tastes.

This was actually better then I thought. I too used Baby Rays BBQ Sauce and cut down to 4 chicken breast . Cooked on high for about 2 hours then turned to low for about 5 hours.. This chicken fell apart wonderfully and is great . Thanks!

Awesome! We loved it. I cooked it for 8 hours and it was not dry. The chicken was really tender. 
The sauce was a little runny, but I put it over rice and they loved it.

This recipe was good, but nothing to write home about. It needs to be cooked for less time because the chicken was sort of dry.  The sauce was okay but I thought it was going to be better than it was.  I didn't put all the barbeque sauce in and I still thought the barbeque sauce overwhelmed the pineapple.  It was quick in easy though so who can complain about that?

The barbecue flavor was too strong for me and I used 14 oz of honey barbecue sauce. I had thought this might be more of a pacific-rim fusion type of flavor, but really it was just barbecued chicken.

I made this dish tonight and instead of using breast halves (I find that there not as juicy as drums or thighs and tend to dry out) I used drumsticks and thighs and found this recipe great, I used honey garlic bbq sauce and chick n rib, about half and half, pineapple chunks and minced garlic. I did find that the sauce was like soup so I added a little bit of flour to thicken it up. Served it over butter and garlic rice, and some broccoli. A very good meal, I will definately try this one again at a social function. I only cooked it for 7 hours. The chicken was falling off the bone! Succulent!!

My family loved this. I did make some changes though. I left out the bell peppers, used instant onions instead of real ones, and added a touch of garlic salt. I used a 20 oz can of drained crushed pineapple, and used 1 3/4 bottles of Kraft Original bbq sauce. The sauce was very runny, but when served with rice, was wonderful.

After reading some of the reviews, I really struggled with rather to make this or not.  I wanted to like this, but I just didn't.  The chicken was alright but the pineapple was way to sweet after the 2nd bite.  The sauce was thin and the onions didn't reduce down like I thought they would.  It left a weird after taste in my mouth.  My husband wasn't a big fan either.  I will be wiser in my recipe selection next time.....when people say it's not that great, there's usually a reason for it. Thanks anyway!

There was nothing special about this recipe.  It might have been my choice of BBQ sacuce (Bull's Eye Honey BBQ) but it just didn't taste that great.  It was really tender and falling apart when I took it out ... but it tasted dry.  I didn't know that combo was possible.  I definitely won't make this again.

My family wasn't so crazy about this one. I followed cooking time as per recipe and the chicken was a little dry. If I make again, will decrease cooking time, or maybe substitute kielbasa in place of cx.

Made this recipe for my 9 college roomates (7 guys, 2 girls) and they loved it! Smells delicious cooking all day and pretty easy to make. Go with canned pinapple as called for, fresh pinapple is tough to cut up!

I cut this recipe in half, given that some reviews were not great.  Yet it sounded so good I wanted to try for myself!  I followed other users advice--used sweet BBQ sauce and added carrots, and also added some cornstarch for thickening in the last 30 minutes, and only cooked it for about 7 hours.  It was OK.  I did have leftovers and served those with soy sauce, which I think made it taste better, but nothing I'll run out to try again.

This recipe is definitely different!  I didn't care too much for the pineapples. I think next time, I might just pour in some pineapple juice for that sweet flavor. The chicken came out wonderful, though, very tender. I served it over rice.

Perhaps the BBQ sauce I used was not a good sauce, but this recipe was unpleasantly tangy to all but two of the eight people who ate it.  I will certainly try it again with a different sauce and hope it will have a smoother taste.

I used some left over veggies(carrots, Broch, etc.) and crushed pinnapple(all I had).  Meat was very moist and flavored throughout.  A different kind of taste.  Hubby liked the change, kids wouldn't touch it.  May try again with chunk pinapple and more garlic.

This was very good.  The sauce was too thin to use on the rice "as is"; so I ended up thickening it with a cornstarch mixture after cooking.

One other thing; cayenne pepper gets hotter with prolonged cooking!  This was a bit spicy/hot for some of us.  This time I used Open Pit barbecue sauce.  Next time I will use a milder & sweeter sauce, like Sweet Baby Ray's.

Note, I only used one bottle of  BBQ sauce and cut the amount of chicken.  very easy and nice contrast with the BBQ sauce  and pineapple.  Chunks worked fine.  Next time I make will add more ingredients, like cashews and other peppers

Very sweet and tangy. It was good served over rice but I would use about 3/4 to 1/2 of the barbecue sauce.

Followed exactly as written except decreased 2 bottles of BBQ sauce to about a bottle and a half and it was fine.  Did thicken with some cornstarch at the end but you don't have to do that, still tasted great.  Only cooked for 6 hours as well and it was done.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ as suggested by others.  It is a different taste, much sweeter but it grows on you!  My husband LOVED it.  If you like a sweeter BBQ taste, give it a try!  VERY easy to make!!

This was perfect! I double the amount of pineapple and add fresh pineapple during the last 30 minutes of cook time. I then served over rice. Very sweet and tangy with a mild kick at the end.

I highly recommend this recipe, with a few changes. If you are going to cook it all day, use the big chicken breast (split with bone) instead of the more expensive ones - they take longer to turn into mush. Also I followed the advice of others and used crushed pineapple instead of cubed, and Kroger's frozen 3 pepper and onion mix (it's red, yellow and green bell peppers).  

I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce too - cooked it in 1 bottle, then added the other bottle at the end. You may need to thicken it a bit with a little corn starch. Even my husband liked this one, he said it was restaurant quality.

Very simple to fix.  I did not have 8 to 9 hours to cook it, so I cooked on high for about 3 hours.  I did cut the chicken breasts in half. The chicken cooked up so tender you could cut it with a fork.  Ti was not bad at first, but then seemed to "grow" with every bite. I think it was just too much sweet and tangy for my taste buds.

It has a very intense and unique flavor, one that I just couldn't grown on. I used Baby Rays sauce and made as the recipe calls. I'm nursing my infant and knew that if I ate this, it would eventually get to him and make him uncomfortable. The best part about it was the rice.

This was the very first recipe that I tried in my new crock pot and It's absolutely delicious. I used Honey bbq sauce since I  figured that would go best with the flavor of the pineapple. Like the other reviewer said, it definitely does not need to cook for 9 hours. Mine was done after about 5. I also think next time I will drain the pineapple  since there was A LOT of liquid left at the end. I had to leave the pepper out since the peppers at the store looked terrible. But it tastes fine just the same!!

Totally burned after the recommended 10 hours on low.  Not a pleasant thing to come home to after a day of work.  I use my crockpot all the time to have dinner waiting after work.  This was no longer dinner!  Made sandwiches instead.

I made this exactly as written and served over rice. Delicious! I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and crushed pineapple, and cooked on high for three hours. The meat was fall-apart tender. My boyfriend commented that he'd like this better as a sandwich filling, so I think I will add cornstarch some time for a thicker sauce and serve as sandwiches. However, I also think it would be delicious over rice with vegetables such as carrots and peapods added. In that instance I think I would prefer the diced pineapple to crushed, because the pineapple chunks make this more like a sweet and sour dish - which is basically what it is, but with a barbecue flavor.  I know I will make this again soon!

Hubby and kids loved it.  Will be added to the regulars list.  Did add flour to the broth to thicken it up.  Hubby also suggested maybe adding potatoes for a full meal in the crock pot.  Will try next time.

I thought this was very good as is. I really didn't change anything except cut the recipe in half. Used my little crock pot and cooked on high about 4 hours. Chicken was tender and the veggies weren't crispy - I had wondered if they would be done. I think the only thing I will change next time is use crushed pineapple instead of chunks.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I ended up being a rush and cooked on high for about 4-5 hours.  It was a little soupy but I added just a bit of flour to thicken it up.  I would definitely recommend this recipe and will be making it again!

Bitter! I used the sweet baby rays buffalo wing sauce and we could not finish one sandwich. The taste was too strong and bitter. Use a different sauce!

Delicious!  I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breast, 1 bottle of BBQ sauce, half green pepper, half red pepper, and the rest of the suggested serving sizes for the other ingredients.  Served it over brown rice.  My husband and I loved it!

The sauce mixture was great, but way too long a cook time, even though I cut it down to 6 hours, the chicken was tough and chewy. Probably would be better as a pork recipe.

This dish was disppointing. It smelled great all day in the crock pot, but a little bland. If I try this one again I will wait to put peppers and onions in at the end.

Loved the flavor of this and best of all, how EASY it was! I had so much sauce left over that I think I will only use one bottle of barbecue sauce next time. Very, very good!

Definitely was done in six hours on low---perfect time.  I used the crushed pineapple and a yellow pepper.  My kids weren't big on the pineapple but my husband and I really liked it.  Served it on rice and was really good!  I did thicken with 4 T of flour upon suggestion of other review and and it helped thicken it up.

This was awesome! We had it over rice.  I used red pepper because I like it more than the green. There are four of us and I only used one bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's.  I also only used four chicken breasts that I seared in the pan and then cut into chuncks.  Awesome! Still have some left over! Chicken was soaked in sauce and was very juicy. Took others' advice and only cooked for six hours though!

Very delicious!  Added a bigger can of pineapple to it and the sauce still worked out great, then pulled the chicken so it was shredded consistency...would be delicious on a sandwich that way!

This was an excellent recipe and my family loved it.  I used the thighs as well boneless and skinless.  I also added the sweet and sour sechwan spicy to mine when I plated it because it would be too hot for my husband.  Will defintely make this again.

Not wild about this. Probably won't make it again. Easy and quick to put together-love to use the crockpot. The chicken was very tender and had pretty good flavor, the pineapple was saturated with all the flavors(didn't taste like pineapple).  Sorry

The flavor was decent, but the directions for cooking time were way off. Next time I will see how its doing after half the time. Served it over rice, but I think this could also be pretty good as a sandwich.

My family loved this!    I had to make some slight adjustments:  I cooked this on HIGH for 5 hours, then I shredded the chicken with 2 forks in the cooker, and cooked for another hour on high.  I used an orange pepper (don't like the green ones).  Next time I might up the garlic a bit, but only because we LOVE garlic!  I served over rice last night, but I think this will make EXCELLENT "Hawaiian bbq'd pulled chicken sandwiches" on those yummy sweet Hawaiian rolls!

My dh and I both really liked this. He put it together for us,  put it into the crock pot, and I turned the crock pot on - to high, actually, because there was no time to cook it longer than about 4 1/2 hours. It was done beautifully! The chicken was fall-apart tender and we ate it over rice with just a dab of soy sauce, which bumped it up perfectly. The leftovers are being frozen and this dish is one I will recommend to friends. Thanks so much for a winner.

My children would not eat it.  My husband thought it was OK.  The chicken was extremely dry.  Which in itself is kind of amazing since it was completely covered in sauce.  I had such high hopes for this recipe.  Definitely will not be making this again.

I made this last night for the 1st time and it turned out surprisingly well! SO EASY! I took the advice from others, and used a can of crushed pineapple instead of chunked. I also cooked it about 5-1/2 hrs on high, and the chicken was fine. There was plenty of sauce (which I also thickened) so served it w/mashed potatoes, however next time I will try it with white rice or even egg noodles.  Yum!

SAVE the sauce!!!  We had leftovers and while the chicken was not dry when reheated, having the extra sauce and putting it over rice was a GREAT (and low effort) second meal!  Also, your choice of BBQ sauce is key.  I used a honey BBQ sauce which was good, but I think you'll want to find something with a relatively milder taste as its easy for "bolder" tasting sauces to overpower the pineapple and dominate the flavor of the chicken.  So choose wisely, but this is a recipe SURE to delight!

completely overcooked the chicken--7-8 hours on low is TOO LONG...and the taste was just too fake or something.  Maybe real pineapple would make it taste more real.

The sauce base was great. I did not have chicken available so I cut a small boneless pork sirloin roast into thick "chops".  I used the sauce but added fresh pineapple(I did not have canned handy), also added red pepper with the green. I seared the "chops" then put all in the crock pot for 6 hours on low. Came out wonderfully moist and tender. I served with baked rice and garlic french cut green beans. Easy and Delicious!

I really didn't like this and I was so excited.  It smelled really good while cooking, but then when it was done it didn't have any flavor, except this weird tomato taste.  Was very disappointed and won't make again.

We made it a five star for our family who is not big on sweet and sour but loves bbq!  I used one bottle of jerk sauce instead of 2 bottles of bbq. More minced garlic from a jar, and frozen chicken breasts because they dont seem to dry out in the cooker.  Also added 2 cups of chicken broth and no pineapple....Delicious jump off recipe to use and alter in many directions!!

Excellent!  I browned my chicken in olive oil to give it a little more flavor.  I added all of the ingredients and just let it go.  This was an excellent recipe!  I will make again.

The chicken was a tad dry, even with the sauce.  The sauce however had a great flavor.  The next day we had leftovers so we shredded the chicken and made tacos!

Very easy, quick to prepare and...delicious! Great for busy days when you want to know you are coming home to a good meal--avoiding the temptation to stop somewhere and "get something quick."  Family raved about it.

This was fantastic and really easy to make.  I didn't have any onion or bell pepper, so I left them out.  I also added a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper and used crushed pineapple instead of chunks.  As usual with cooking boneless skinless chicken breasts in the crockpot, the chicken turned out pretty dry-- so, I shreaded the chicken, thickened the sauce on the stovetop with corn starch and mixed it together and had fabulous bbq chicken sandwiches.  I also used the sauce to mix with some canned baked beans to have with the sandwiches.  I used Kraft Spicy Honey bbq sauce and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey bbq sauce.  It was VERY sweet with these 2 sauces.  Next time to cut down on sweetness, I'll probably use only 1 honey bbq sauce and 1 other not so sweet one.

This is not bad.  I used chicken pieces instead of breasts--I had this huge chicken to use up.  I skinned and defatted as best I could the dark meat and plopped it in with the sauce with the bones still in the chicken.  It's a simple matter to use a slotted spoon and separate the bones from the meat after cooking, so that's what I did.  I kind of overfilled my crockpot, so it rewarded me by overflowing.  Oops.  It didnt' affect the taste of the dish though, and it's all my fault anyway.  I think I got a bit carried away with the bbq sauce and I didn't realized until after I'd mixed everything together that my can of pineapple chunks was a 20 oz, not 15 oz can.  Anyway, the sauce was thin so I added about a cup of water and cornstarch mixed together (a cup total) to the the crockpot and let it cook another 1/2 hour, and it thickened up.  I added carrots instead of peppers since I didn't have peppers--the carrots were still crispy, which surprised me.  I served on bread.  Bf really enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good. The chicken came out nice and tender.  I probably could have used 1/2 since I had about half the chicken but with the rice was a nice flavor blend.  I used sweet baby ray's honey bbq sauce.

Followed the recipe as is, using Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, and my wife and I found it sickeningly sweet. Definitely needs something spicy added to offset the sweetness. If I try this again I'll using a HOT BBQ sauce, not sugar-based BBQ sauce, to balance out the pineapple and sugar. Or maybe add chopped red chiles like General Tsao's Chicken to give it some kick.

BTW, our friend, who sprinkles sugar on ice cream, loved this dish.

This recipe did not work for me. As other reviewers mentioned, the chicken ended up extremely dry and the combination of flavors was odd together. I don't feel as though this one is worth tweaking to try to make it better. The concept is good but the execution is not.

I wasn't real impressed with this one.  The only thing I changed was that I only added one bottle of BBQ (Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ).  There was still plenty of sauce, and probably would have been too much with both bottles.  My family ate it, but just didn't think it was that special.

Delicious but didn't need anywhere near 8 hours, even on low. I'm making it again today but this time I'll probably cook it on high for about 2 hours. Also, when I made it the first time, I included the pineapple chunks. I thought the actual chunks were gross, but my fiend liked them. This time, I'm only adding the pineapple juice.

This was great!!!  I wanted BBQ and this really hit the stop.  I made a smaller batch so it was really cooked by the time I got home because of the size of the crockpot, but it was still great.  I scooped the chicken and veggies out and shredded it up and ate it on a roll with purple cabbage slaw on top and it was WONDERFUL!!!

I cooked mine for 6 hours and it came out black and dry. I might try it again to see if it comes out better.

the sauce was excellent but the consistency of the chicken was awful. i followed the recipe exactly and don't know what other did to get a tender chicken but mine was somehow TOO tender. i even cooked it an hour less than it suggested. i'll just try the sauce on a stir fried breaded chicken next time for a sweet and sour chicken dinner.

Made this for the Memorial Day weekend and was not disappointed.  I used the crushed pineapple as suggested and the Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce.  Served the chicken over brown rice.  Easy to prepare and that's always a plus for me!  For me, I think the next time I will cut the green pepper in to larger chunks instead of chopped, and perhaps add red pepper as well.  This is a keeper recipe.

This was great. A very picky husband loved it!!!!  I didn't alter the recipe at all, but maybe should have added a little soemthing to thicken up the sauce. I made chunks of onion and orange peppers very big so that they were easy to pick out. I am definitely making this again and again.

We really liked this recipe.  I used three good size chicken breasts and one bottle of honey flavored bbq sauce, but left all the other ingredients the same.  I through a package of frozen stir-fry vegetables on top and cooked it all on high for 5 hours.

Thought it was good...but could have used a bit more flavor.  I did add ginger, as suggested by other readers and should have used cornstarch to thicken, but ran out of time...had hungry folks waiting.  The aroma it put out was wonderful, but didn't feel like it tasted as good as it smelled.  I did add carrots, onions and green pepper with the pineapple...may play around with the sauce next time?  Maybe some soy sauce?  Will probably make again though, so worth the time.

My family really did not like this.  Maybe it was the BBQ sauce we used (Sweet Baby Rays Honey)  The chicken was done long before time was up as well so was a bit dry (I cooked it 7 hrs)  Won't be making this again.

This was very good, though a bit strong in flavor. Perhaps it was the bbq sauce I used. I also added diced potatoes which added a nice texture.

We likes this recipe very much.  We served it over rice and for the non rice eaters in the family over spaghetti noodles.  I added some soy sauce and saved some of the pineapple juice to add some corn starch to thicken it in the last hour.

I made this recipe for the first time when I had people coming over and followed it exactly.  Out of the 9 people over for dinner, NO ONE LIKED IT.  We ended up ordering pizza.  The pineapple was not good after sitting in the bar-be-que sauce all day and the chicken was really dry.

My husband loved this recipe and so did I.  It was very easy and the chicken was ultra tender.  I took the others suggestions by adding corn starch to thicken the sauce. This made for white chunks I had to fish out but helped thicken. I cooked on high for 31/2 to 4 hours.

I used less bbq sauce and a whole fresh pineapple. I forgot to put in the bell peppers...I was planning on using red. These boneless skinless chicken breasts just fell apart. I served this over brown rice w/ a side of steamed broccoli. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I didn't care for it at all.  I prepared it strictly by the reciep and didn't like the flavor.  I see that several others made certain changes recommended in the reviews.  I probably should have done the same.

This tasted really good. I did mess with it though. I baked it in the oven since i don't have a crock pot...hazards of being newlyweds. I only used barbeque sauce and the pineapple chunks. I marinated the chicken in some barbeque sauce and the pineapple juice for about an hour. Then i poured rice into the juice and baked it in the oven for about 25 minutes. I then added rice as needed, flipped the chicken, poured more barbeque sauce on it and added the pineapple chunks. Then i let it bake for another 20 minutes.

I did this recipe as I was leaving to drop off my daughter at school...so last minute!  I had all ingredients except the green pepper.  I used 4 frozen chicken breasts and cooked on high for about 6 hrs. and low about 4-5.(just because we weren't ready to eat yet).  I shredded the chicken and it was really good and tender.  I didn't find that it was runny at all.  I also had cous cous in the house so I put it over that.  I'm sure rice is good too.  It was so easy, I would make it again!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I cut the chicken into pieces before I put it in, and since my girlfriend doesn’t like pineapple I used crushed instead of chunks.  I only cooked it for 6 hours on low and the chicken came out great...very tender and moist.  The sauce was thin but perfect over rice, and it thickened after it sat awhile.  I’ve been adding soy sauce and Frank’s Red Hot with each bowl, but next time I think I’ll put them in the sauce with the other ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

My picky eaters loved it. I only used 1 bottle of bbq and it was honey mustard. I also used fresh pineapple and added a little white wine to make up for the lost canned pineapple juice. I will definitely make it again!

We made the following changes to the recipe:  Used cut fryer pieces instead of breast halves, used 1 1/2 bottles BBQ sauce (Kraft Honey BBQ), omitted the onion and bell pepper, substituted Garlic salt for the cloves, and only used half the pineapple juice.  Also cooked it for 6 hours instead of 9.  
The chicken pieces came out juicy and thoroughly cooked, and while not spectacular, it was OK. 
Even though we reduced the liquids, the sauce was very thin and we think the pineapple chunks detracted from the sauce.  Maybe crushed or tidbit pineapple next time.  We served it over rice with sweet corn on the side.  Not going to be in a hurry to make it again, but I've had worse.

Pretty easy to make.  Chicken was very tender.  Taste was just ok though.  I would use less BBQ sauce next time if I do try it again.  Still looking for some "wow" recipes for the crockpot.  Anyone???

Good easy recipe.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  It was a hit with the family.  I used less bbq sauce (honey).

We thought this recipe was great!
My husband wants it again
I halved the ingredients and converted them to Australian quanities.
I used a bottle of Homebrand (woolies) BBQ Sauce 500/600ml.
I didn't add much Capsicum either
And I only used 3 Chicken Breasts

My husband, the human garbage disposal wouldn't partake after his first bite. This, ladies and gentlemen is unprecedented.

I am a grrreat cook. No fault of my own, except perhaps feeling a bit lazy with a new baby and wanting to break out the crockpot.

This was good and very easy. I left out the green pepper because I didn't have it on hand. I found that there was a taste element missing, but I don't think that the green pepper was it. I still haven't decided what would be the right thing to add. Also, the sauce was very watery. I was hoping for something a little thicker. It is good in a pinch.

Chicken was dry, and as other stated the sauce did not have a very good flavor.  I added brown sugar in an effort to save it; however, it is not something I will make again.  Thanks anyways.

Usually when I bake or put my meat in the crock pot I put the sauce on last so that it isn't watery.  But this time I followed the directions.  I think the recipe would have been better if I had done like usually do.  I'm going to try it again.

This turned out so good! I didn't have any green peppers so therefore I didn't use any and I halved the recipe. We served it over rice. When my fiance woke me up for work he said, "I don't know what you're cooking in there but it sure smells good!!" We were both very pleased with this recipe and will be making it regularly.

I read mixed reviews about this recipe before I tried it in my slow cooker,I did not like this recipe,I tried to be objective but the taste was bland and the sauce, although I thickened it with corn starch,was not good. My family ate it but was not enthusiastic and didn't go back for more. I say thumbs down for this one.

The  chicken was really dry. The cooking time needs to be reduced by a couple of hours. I also added cornstarch near the end to thicken the sauce. I won't make this again.

My husband said he really liked this, but I thought it was only ok.  My four year old also thought it was ok but not great. We ended up using the leftover chicken in Fabulous Fajitas (another recipe on this site) and the tangy flavor tasted good in the fajita! Liked it better that way.  Might not make again.

This recipe was very good and very easy.  I only used one bottle of BBQ sauce and I used 2 cans of pineapple chunks with juice and it turned out fabulous!

My picky little family all loved this dish.  It had a little bit of everything in it for all of my boys and they said they would love to have it again. Thanks!
