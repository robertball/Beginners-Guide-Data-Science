I have a very similar recipe however it calls for cubed hashbrown potatoes, and I actually use the O'brien version with the pepper and onion in it already (do not use the tomatoes).  We have this breakfast almost everytime we go camping in the summer.  The kids and my husband love it and it is a great way to start the day.

I did not have any bacon on hand, so I made a vegetarian version of this recipe.  I was skeptical about adding garlic at first, but I ended up adding two cloves and thought it added a fantastic flavor!  I also added some mushrooms and red pepper instead of green and used red potatoes and left the skins on.  I whisked the eggs and seasoned with salt and pepper before pouring on top of the sauteed veggie mix.  Then I added the cheese to the top and put the lid on the skillet until it melted.  It was a tasty and filling breakfast!

To be Honest, This had to be the worst thing I ever made my kids eat. It was horrible. I did everything perfectly. I was extremely disapointed.

Very good! I didn't use tomatoes and instead of cracking the egges in the skillet, I beat them first with a little milk and poured overall, cooking until they had set. My boyfriend added some salsa but I liked them as they were.  Great with the strawberry smoothie we had to accompany this! Thank you DD!

Very, very good! I did make some changes to better suit our taste such as adding more bacon, adding mushrooms, and decreasing the amount of tomatoes. Overall, a great base recipe with lots of possibilities! thanks!

I made this last weekend and I'm going to make it again this weekend.  The ingredients were easy to find (I live in Korea and it's sometimes difficult to find things listed in recipes), making the breakfast was super easy, and my wife loved it!

This was absolutely delicious. I opted not to make it an overly healthy version by frying the potatoes until crisp, in the bacon grease after cooking the bacon pieces. I drained the potatoes and then sauteed the veggies, I added jalapeno, a drained can of tomatoes with green chiles and cayenne pepper to the veggie mixture (we like it hot). I added scrambled eggs to this mixture and cooked until it was at the desired firmness and then stirred in the potatoes and cheese! It was a hit, my bf, his brother, mom and friend all had seconds.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Love any excuse to eat runny eggs.  Forgot the cheese, didn't miss it.  Added some chopped kale and cilantro.  Will be making again.

Nothing to complain about with this recipe. The entire pan got eaten so I consider that a win. I didn't think about taking a picture : ( Hopefully I will remember next time)  We didn't have bacon, so I used some left over smoked sausage, other than that I followed the recipe. I did cut the potatoes before boiling. they cook faster and  it is easier than trying to cut when they are soft (and waiting for them to cool enough to cut). I will make this again; probably trying many variations of meat and vegetables. Thanks for a quick hearty breakfast.
