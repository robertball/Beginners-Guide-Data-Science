Wow, this salsa is HOT! a little bit of a kick is an understatement. I don't normally associate jalepenos and chipotle peppers as being hot either. Also, my salsa was thick and kind of pasty like. I never saw that with salsa. I am starting to think that Paleo recipes don't include salt. This one didn't have it either. I am going to have to modify this somehow or blend it with another recipe to thin it out and cut back on the heat. I am giving it 3 stars, because I think I can manage something out of this to be able to eat it. I am just not a hot foods person, I guess.
