I hate it when people give less than 5 stars when they didn't FOLLOW THE RECIPE!!! Mine just came out of the oven and they were perfect!! They are airy, spongy, light, and a little sweet! There is no need to add more flour, so don't read other reviews and automatically add tons more flour. I added a little to the spoon as I was putting them into the muffin tins but that's it! If you add a cup or more of flour, of course you're going to have more dense rolls!! Stick to the recipe and you'll get good results!

I am a professional pastry chef. I don't specialize in bread but rather sweets so when it came to dinner tonight and our standard loaf of bread in the kitchen had gone moldy I was scrambling to find a quick yeast bread to put on the plate next to my stuffed pork loin. I found this and boy am I glad I did!!! What an easy recipe and SO tasty for the tiny effort they took. The other reviews that state that the dough was " too sticky" simply did not know that this kind of quick yeast dough is supposed to be a gloppy mess before they bake. When you mix this stuff up in the bowl it will look like very sticky cake batter....that's fine, don't freak out. Just let it rise as stated and when you SCOOP it into the muffin tin after the first rise use a large scoop. yes, will still be  very gloppy but still continue on. Let them rise a second time and then bake as stated. Mine were a golden brown on top and so buttery on the inside. Stick with the recipe JUST AS WRITTEN and don't worry that you can't kneed this dough...it's not that kind of dough. You will be richly rewarded if you try this one.

Didn't have any shortening so I used bacon fat, no sugar so I used molases, in a hurry so I used cold water, no yeast....used baking powder, only had a hard boiled egg, tried some garlic salt, no AP flour so I had to use corn meal. Didn't come out anything like the picture.

Oh my goodness!!! These are the best rolls I've ever made!  I've never been able to make rolls, until now.  My husband and I ate every one BEFORE they made it to the dinner table.  I did have to make some adjustments, but they came out wonderful!  I had to add a little more flour because the dough was too wet and I used margarine instead of shortening because I was out of shortening.  They still came out great!  I let them rise about an hour, then rolled them in 2 inch balls in a 9x13 pan instead of a muffin tin.  They came out kind of square shaped and I just pulled them apart very easily.  I am making them again today, and doubling the recipe!! Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe that I will make over and over again!

YUM!
These were easy to make. I did worry a little about how the dough was so sticky, but I went ahead with the recipe as-is. They turned out great. It was a little hard getting the dough in the muffin cups, but that was the only problem. Don't let them rise TOO much in the muffin cups as they will rise a good bit in the oven while baking.

I have been using this recipe weekly to make hamburger/sandwich buns.  The dough stays sticky and wet throughout the process- I don't even worry about the usual process of shaping into a ball and greasing with oil before it rises- I just knead it with the dough hook on the Kitchenaid and then just leave it all sticky in the bowl to rise.  It works out fine every time.  When I have added extra flour to thicken the dough up a bit, it tends to produce a heavier/more dense roll.  I substitute butter for the shortening, maple syrup for the sugar (when I remember to do so, I try to cut back on the water a little bit to accommodate the extra liquid) and I use home-milled whole wheat flour for all of the white flour called for.  We eat them all the time and I have even begun giving them out to neighbors and friends each week as they are requested.

I loved this recipe. Still, I made a few adjustments. Along with the 2 T. of shortening I added 2 T. butter. I also increased the sugar to 1/2 c. and the flour to 2 1/2 c. Absolutely wonderful! I ate three as soon as they came out.

I can't imagine why the raves; the proportions were so off on this recipe that I might as well have rewritten them; the dough was too sticky to work with in even shaping balls to go into the muffin tin; I probably added 3/4 cup flour, which in turn made 12 rolls.  

I made these rolls again with my own changes and they were much better.  I substituted 3 tablespoons honey for the sugar, reduced the water to 2/3 cup; made it with 1-3/4 cups whole wheat flour and 3/4 cups white flour (as per the suggestion of another reviewer); this made the outcome perfect.  I would suggest reducing the water to 2/3 cup to make the dough less sticky and easy to work.

A really great recipe...I ended up spooning them out on a small, round cake pan (all smushed together with sides touching) and they still came out great!  They tasted like the pull-apart yeast rolls that you can find in your grocer's freezer section.

We LOVE these rolls! This is the second batch we've made and after changing a few of the ingredients, they are much tastier! 
  Instead of shortening, use 2 tsp butter. Add 1/4 cup extra flour, knead 4 minutes (with electric mixer) then allow to rise 45 minutes. Punch the dough down, then using greased ice cream scoop, scoop out large balls of dough and place into greased, glass casserole dish. Allow to rise until doubled in size (about 30 minutes). Melt 1 tsp butter with 1 tsp honey and brush over the tops of the rolls.  Bake at 425 for 10 - 12 minutes. Enjoy!

This was the first time for me to try the daunting task of cooking with yeast and I couldn't have tried a better recipe! These came out AMAZING! It was even more amazing considering my oven was on the fritz and I had to bake them in the toaster oven. I also put them in a pan and they became awesome tear apart buns. My husband loved these! He ate most of them and then while I was relaxing two days later he says " I think you should make more of those buns". I will definitely add more flour next time (dough was a little too sticky)and I guess I too will have to double the recipe! Thanks!

I've made a whole lot more complicated roll recipes that didn't taste as good as these easy rolls do.   They do need more flour than the recipe calls for but that is easily remedies.  They definitely do better in the muffin tin.  I had one clean so I made hald a double batch in and the other half in a regular pan.   The ones in the pan don't brown evenly, rather like biscuits, but that could be fixed too by brushing them with water to start with.   I have honestly never seen rolls rise this fast and not be poor textured.   Great recipe.

Very pleased with these quick yeast rolls.  This batter is to be dipped  into the muffin cups as it is very sticky.  By using 2 1/2 inch muffin cups and about 2 Tablespoons of batter per muffin cup, I had a yield of 12 rolls.  Upon removing from 425 degree oven, I brushed the top of each roll with melted BUTTER. Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is truly a QUICK yeast roll and a keeper for me.  Mine looked just like the Allrecipes picture.

Very easy and tasty...I wish the directions had more to go on such as how long to wait until the yeast is dissolved (10 minutes) and how many minutes to let the dough rise (30 - 40 minutes each time).  I added three drops of vanilla for  flavoring.  I did not knead the dough but when I emptied it out onto a floured surface, I used a floured plastic spatula to cut it into pieces small enough for the muffin cups. The dough was sticky as mentioned and filled 12 silicone muffin holders (not 8 as the recipe says).  Big, fluffy, tasty rolls, but had to do a lot of guessing.

These are a wonderful quick yeast roll, made even quicker if you use your microwave to raise the dough. Put a cup of hot water in the back of the microwave along with the dough (covered with plastic wrap). Microwave on the lowest setting (mine is 10%) for 2 minutes. Let rest for 3 minutes. Repeat once and your dough should have doubled in size. Put dough in the muffin tins and let rise again while the oven heats. It cuts down the time considerably! I can make these with Rapid Rise yeast in less than an hour! Fabulous light and airy!

I followed the recipe exactly and they are PERFECT! I love making bread and have made some very complex recipes, but this simple recipe trumps them all!!!!  FYI the dough is very sticky to put into muffin pans, but if you use a pair of rubber gloves it doesn't stick a bit!

What a pleasant surprize! I followed the recipe exact only subtracting two tablespoons of flour and adding in two tablespoons of dry buttermilk powder. These turned out spongy, light and just.......WONDERFUL. Everyone loved these and these were just so galdarn easy. I bet these would be really good as a "breakfast puff", taken right out of the oven, dipped in butter and then rolled in cinnamon/sugar. Yum yum! Easy and delicious--I'm VERY happy! NOTE: For those of you wondering where to get dry buttermilk powder, you can find it in down your baking aisle right along with the dry nonfat milk powder.

I was very worried after following the directions and making the dough.  While considering adding extra flour, I decided to read some reviews first.  So glad I did.  This is a wet dough, but it still rose perfectly and baked into pillowy-soft, slightly sweet rolls.  These went perfectly with our chicken chowder tonight and my kids are taking their sandwiches on these rolls to school tomorrow.  They are so easy - I will definitely make these often.

AMAZING. quick, easy and oh so tasty. i followed another's suggestion and just plopped everything into my food processor and gave it a buzz and let it rise in there, then transfered into muffin tins. my whole family loves them! the dough is very sticky, but trust me, it's supposed to be that way.

Take my advice and don't change this recipe at all.  The dough is VERY sticky to start, but keep stirring or kneading until it is quite stretchy.  After the first rise is complete it will no longer be so sticky, but will be a very soft, perfect dough to make into rolls.  The softness of the dough means the rolls will be much softer and lighter than rolls made with a stiff dough.  Enjoy!

I was interested in making yeast rolls but wanted something easy.  I was very happy to find this recipe because these were VERY easy and they taste wonderful.  I read the reviews so I was not too concerned about the "sticky mess".  I was surprised over the texture - sort of like cake or muffins- but the flavor is just what I was looking for.  I baked the rolls in a muffin tin and they came out perfectly browned.  I appreciate the fact that someone was generous enough to share this recipe with all of us.  I will make these again - they are quick, easy and great tasting.  If you have doubts, just try it one time.

I made these for the first time yesterday for a dinner party...I must say they turned out great. Every one was asking where I bought them. I will make these more often, my family loves them. This is definitely a 5 star recipe. I followed the recipe just as it was. It was a wet dough but I just put a little flour on my hands made a little balls and put them in a round cake pan instead of a muffin pan..yum yum great with butter.Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I LOVE this recipe!! I must admit that it made me a little nervous the first time I made them to follow the recipe as is, but I am SO glad I did!! They are the easiest darn things to make and still have that worked in kitchen all day flavor. It's perfect for a quick throw together roll to complement a fall stew or roast. They don't create a bunch of dishes and that alone deserves five stars in my book! Really-Just ignore all the comments about adding flour and use this recipe as it's written. It is a roll in a class all it's own. I now call them MY Easy No Knead Rolls and I make them all the time. Hope you guys trust this recipe and find out that slaving over a complicated process should be saved for some other roll recipe. This one doesn't 'knead' it! Enjoy!!

Outstanding!  Too many people are focusing on the "rolls" portion of the recipe name.  These are QUICK rolls, and therefore have a wet, sticky dough like a quick bread.  There is absolutely no need to increase the flour at all - despite any misgivings you might have when you first see the dough (I had them, too) they come out light and fluffy and absolutely perfect every time.  I've made four batches of these in the past week for different holiday dinners and they've worked perfectly every single time.  This is the most responsive dough - I use SAF yeast and if you watch the dough not the clock these can be completely done from start to finish in an hour and ten minutes.  Use wet hands to smooth the dough in the muffin cups for a smoother appearance, and for an extra yummy bonus brush them with herbed butter after they come out of the oven.  Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!

Wet doughs make for light, moist breads -- this is a quote from my cooking science book.  If you add flour like some suggest, you have ruined the recipe.  These are delicious and addicting if you follow the directions!

I made these twice, first time I followed the recipe. They came out very nice.However I wanted to make it healthier so Second time I substited Lard for the unhealthy shortening, they came out much lighter. Lard has now been proven to be better for your heart and arteries then shortening.

Just took the first batch of these out of the oven. Yum! They are light and airy and, although they have the appearance of a muffin, they definitely taste like a roll, NOT a muffin. I don't agree with other reviewers who said the measurements were off. I doubled the recipe and only had to add about 1/2 cup extra flour. As with any bread recipe, more or less flour may be necessary depending upon the humidity level. Do not over work the dough, stir it only until it comes together. It should be very sticky but not wet. Remember, you do not have to knead this dough. Adding too much flour and overworking the dough will cause the rolls to be dense. I used a greased serving spoon to drop the dough into the muffin cups. One tip, make sure you grease the muffin cups very well, even if using a non-stick pan.

Delicious! I'm so happy to find something easier than the recipe I've been making. These are much faster & I used Quick Rise yeast so the dough rose much faster. I also put the bread in a loaf pan instead of muffins tins. After letting the loaf cool completely I sliced with my sharp serrated bread knife & we made sandwiches with it. They taste better on fresh bread. It's a great thing knowing that I know what I'm putting in my kids mouth. No preservatives is the best way to go. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Good, soft rolls!  I put mine in an 8X11 inch pan and they expanded nicely.  I had to cook them a tad longer than the recipe indicated.  As others wrote, follow the recipe and you'll get great results!

Awesome recipe.  I had to give just 4 stars though because I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I used butter instead.  The rolls came out just fine and my family loved them!  I had a hard time keeping them away from the rolls while I finished making the rest of our dinner!

I have made a lot of rolls in my 54 years and this one tops the list for speed and flavor.  Most of my roll recipes require rising for a much longer period of time, but I let these rise, covered in the bowl for 20 min and for another 20 after scooping the dough into the muffin tins.  So we had delicious rolls for breakfast within an hour.  Yes, it is a very wet dough, but they turned out beautifully.  I added some ground flax to the mix for added fiber.

I normally never give a recipe a poor rating, but there was no other options for me!  The instructions could have been written better.  DROP BY SPOONFULS into your muffin tins.  Yes, I followed the recipe exactly as written and didn't change a thing.  The rolls were dense, very sweet and doughy.    It just goes to show you that there is no shortcut for great yeast rolls.  These really weren't that much of a timesaver ultimately and they were a huge flop.  I'd have been better off using Rhodes frozen dough roll..   I've baked breads for over 30 years.. these just weren't all that great.

Yum, these were so good, especially when the ease of them is considered. This may be the second easiest roll I have ever made. I followed everything as is just subbing and equal amount of melted butter for the shortening. The directions are just a tad vague in they don't give a time to expect for doubling of the dough or roll. Mine was about 32-35 minutes each. I used my new glass bowl for my Kitchen-Aid mixer and being able to see the dough made this super easy. I mixed the yeast and dough with the dough hook and covered the top with plastic wrap and let it rise right in it. Normal dough rises at about 115 deg. I found that 100 deg. was sufficient with these, possibly because the amount of sugar. I did let the yeast proof for about 15-20 minutes stirring a few times. I made 9 rolls, but next time will try to up it to 10 as they were huge! I used a mashed potato scoop to ladle the dough, as it is more like a sticky batter. I sprayed the Reynolds foil liners with a Bakers Joy and that worked great for no sticking or clean-up to the muffin pan. They took 12 minutes. These are going into the recipe box. They were great with soup. TY!

I have to agree with others on here about the complaints, I have made this recipe nearly 20 times. It is an old basic recipe that my 91 yr old Grandma still makes. She taught me how. These are light airy and tender. I believe some folks try to profect something that is already perfect!  These are not store bought,these are good down to earth yeast rolls. Please don't play with it and give it another try. Its well worth trying again and NOT trying tofix something that is not broke. Best during Easter split open and put a slice of ham in it, AWESOME! thanks for a wonder old recipe!

It was so simple to make that I still cannot believe it. Yeah, the dough was a little sticky but I could still work with it. I put it all in a baking pan and used a knife to make cuts to get individual rolls. I even received kudos from my wife, who is not a fan of bread.

Personally, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't like these rolls.  They are delicious.  They have a great yeast flavor and are very simple to make.  You don't have to knead them and that takes out all of the work that goes into making rolls.  The batter is gooey and that's how it's supposed to be.  Try them as according to the recipe before you try to modify them!  I'll never modify them.  Oh, another thing.  Now the recipe did say that this makes 8 rolls.  We made 9 and they were pretty tall.  I think we could even go with the whole 12 in the muffin tin next time and still have a big enough roll.

These rolls turned out very light and fluffy and tasted AMAZING!  The dough is very sticky, which made me think I did not add enough flour.  However, I decided to let it rise and see what happened and they turned out perfect.  I am glad I did not add more flour because that would have made the rolls a lot more dense rather than the fluffy dinner rolls that they are supposed to be.  This is my new roll recipe, goodbye biscuits in a can.

As a high school FCS teacher I am always looking for recipes that don't take a long time to complete. During my search for a cool rise yeast bread recipe, I came across this one to use at home. I tried it last night EXACTLY as written and the rolls came out perfectly and were delicious!
I read through people's comments in their reviews and became increasingly frustrated by people who do not know how to read and/or follow a recipe! This is a yeast bread BATTER - not intended to be handled at ALL by one's hands! I used a large scoop to fill my muffin pan and it worked beautifully - I spread the batter between all 12 cups because I didn't know how much rising to expect. Next time I'll stick to the 8 cups and see how much more volume I get for each roll.
Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

These came out so light and fluffy and tasty. I am glad another reviewer mentioned that the dough is supposed to be very sticky, because I followed the recipe exactly and they worked out great. For newbie chefs, you stir this very sticky type dough with a fork to mix, and you obviously have to flour your hands really well to handle the dough and separate into roll portions. They will have a light flour coating on the outside.
  I let mine rise in a lightly warm oven (about 100 degrees) to speed up the rising process. I baked on a cookie sheet instead of a muffin pan. Then I cut in half and made garlic bread with them. I chose this recipe because it was quick, I needed bread on short notice and I enjoy making things from scratch. 
   I printed this off on a 4" by 6" and into my recipe box it went!

LOVE these rolls. I followed the recipe amounts exactly but I did make one change in steps. I bloom my yeast in the warm water (120-130 degrees) first then add it to the sugar / shortening mix. I really got such better rise doing it this way. The rolls themselves are DELICIOUS, thanks so much for sharing it, my family and friends also say thanks!

I have made this recipe about a dozen times now.  I've exchanged the sugar for honey, used a cake pan instead of muffin tins, used muffins tins, added  .25 cups of cheddar cheese and doubled the recipe.  Came out wonderfully all but the very first time when I put too much of the dough (which is much more like an extremely sticky batter) into the muffin tins.  If you are using standard-sized tins, I recommend using about 2-3 heaping tablespoons of batter for about 10-15 muffins.  I normally let the dough rise 30 minutes in the bowl and then an additional 10 in the tins  or pan before baking.  Use a floured wooden spoon to scoop into tins.  If using a pan, put large dollops of dough to make individual rolls.  A hit every time, but beware of eating too many to those who have yeast issues.  These rolls are seriously addictive and are great with fresh apple butter right out of the oven for breakfast, or with a home-made chicken soup.  Love them!

This is exactly the recipe I've been using for rolls for many, many years.  Easy and fabulous!  I usually form them into little balls & put three in each muffin cup (I'm sure there's a name for this that I can't think of right now!) The trick is to keep your hands floured so that the dough does not stick to your fingers as you form it.

I tried these rolls last night 10/08 and the recipe is easy, but for some reason mine came out sort of tight. I followed the recipe to the T. I'll still give it 5 stars. What did I do Wrong?

These ARE quick.  I wouldn't worry about the stickiness, just use a spoon to 'spoon' the batter into the muffin tin.  The rolls came out better when I filled all 12 muffin cups.  These rolls don't have as much flavor as a more traditional bread recipe requiring kneading and a little bit longer rising...but a dab of butter after baking helps!!  The texture is more like some kind of bread muffin hybrid than an actual bread roll.  I would not have tried rolling this dough into balls, it really is more like a batter.  So, over all, I give it a 4 for ease and a 3 for taste - that rounds up, doesn't it????  Also, they are still good when substituting half of the flour with whole wheat.  This recipe is a little bit on the dry side - I personally wouldn't follow the other reviews suggesting a higher percentage of whole wheat flour than 50.

SUCCESS Finally!!!
Yeast recipes and I don't get along, after I saw what my "blooming" yeast was doing, I knew I was on the right track this time. I gave myself an online lesson about yeast and this is what I did.

Water was at approx 117°, I added the sugar and fresh active yeast (not rapid rise). Leave alone for 10 mins. 
Put 2 T softened butter in stand mixer bowl. Added the yeast mixture when it was done, added egg and incorporated it into mixture. Gradually added flour and salt, which I had wisked together in bowl. Mixed on medium speed for 3-4 mins. 
My house stays at 65°, so I preheated oven to 200°, then turned off, left oven light on. Covered bowl (same one I mixed in) with damp towel, and put in oven. After 1 hour of rising, I dropped dough into the well greased muffin cups, then lighty covered with greased plastic wrap, put on top of stove while it preheated to 425°and waited 30 more minutes. Baked in 425°oven for 12 mins.
I had also added 1 T of honey before adding flour. (Saw it in another review and it sounded good.) I apologize if this review (my first) gets anyone's panties in a bunch, but for those of us who need to start somewhere with a successful yeast recipe I am hoping these detailed instructions help!

Great dinner rolls and timing is perfect.  I doubled the recipe with no problem.  Instructions say to let rise until doubled and after dividing dough into muffin tins let rise again.  Both rises took 30 mins each and then 10 mins to bake.  I brushed melted butter on the tops before baking.  Perfect with Slow Cooker Beef Pot Roast from Chef John's recipe here on All Recipes. Thanks for sharing!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  This simply could not be easier or more delicious.  I didn't have shortening so I replaced with an equal amount of veg oil and it worked perfectly.  I also added some dried thyme, rosemary, sage and garlic powder to make them herb rolls.  The texture on these were incredible.  Will absolutely add these to the permanent files!

Wonderfully easy and fantastic tasting. These are the rolls I remember from my childhood - fluffy and yeasty. I did substitute butter for the shortening with no problems. We immediately started a second batch. No problems with the dough being too sticky to handle- just dip the utensil or measuring cup as I used into flour to coat and the dough comes out. Thank you I am so happy with these!!!

These were fast (as rolls go), easy, and delicious.  My kids' only complaint was that there weren't enough!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, which makes for a very wet dough, but works perfectly.  I mixed in the kitchen aid for about 3-4 minutes once I added the flour, and then let rise about 45 minutes.  Then I used a greased ice cream scoop to scoop dough into greased cupcake pan.  (This recipe made 12 rolls for me.)  I let rise about 30 more minutes, and then baked at 425 degrees for 10 minutes.  Perfect:)  Will definitely make again!

I needed a quick and easy roll recipe for Sunday dinner and this worked out great!  The dough is really sticky, but it was easy enough to put a little flour on my hands to roll the dough into balls for the muffin tins. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were a great and a special Monday night treat for DH and me. They were very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. The dough is extremely sticky, but that can be remedied by spooning the dough into the greased muffin tin instead of rolling into a balls. Again, really great, tasty, quick yeast rolls!

I followed the ingredient list exactly.  My dough was nice and soft and only slightly sticky.  I deviated from the recipe by transferring the doug to an oiled bowl to rise.  Something came up so I punched it down and allowed it to rise again.  Then I shaped the dough into 9 balls and baked them in my 9" sq pan for 11 minutes.  They were amazing while they were hot and still quite good at room temperature.  As with most yeast dough, the longer you let the yeast work the better the result.  Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

This recipe couldn't be easier. Hardly any mixing and no kneading. They turned out yummy. I would have liked a bit sweeter, but a little honey on the top does the trick. This recipe makes 8 HUGE rolls. Next time I'll make the whole dozen in the muffin tins for smaller rolls.

Delicious and so easy! Thanks DCASH for an amazing roll recipe, just what I was looking for! Dough is extremely sticky and gooey. I just spooned it into my muffin pan. I know everyone always hates on people for rating when you change the recipe. I made these by the recipe and they were great, made them again with honey instead of sugar and they were great too! I'm always tweaking my own recipes and rarely make something the same way twice. Isn't that what cooking is about? As long as you have a good base recipe, I say go for it, have fun cooking and tweak it to fit your tastes and mood! Thanks again for a wonderful roll recipe!!

Super easy and very tasty.  More of a batter than a dough, so don't panic when it doesn't look like bread dough.  You spoon it into the muffin tins.  Don't try to roll it or form it in any way.  Excellent recipe.

These were easy and oh, so good! I added the yeast to the sugar & warm water to let it bloom before adding it to the other ingredients, then I used my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook and set it on medium for 5 minutes. I just left it in the bowl & covered it for 30 min to rise. It was very sticky, as others said, but I just spooned it into the muffin tin & let it rise another 15 min. I will definitely be making these again and again!

READ THE RECIPE.  Nowhere in the recipe does it say to roll the dough into balls before placing in muffin tin.  So don't complain that the dough is too sticky because you're not supposed to be handling it! Just cut up the dough in 8 pieces and throw them in the pan - they rise uniformly.  Best rolls ever!

I have been baking bread for over 30 years.  I win ribbons at county fairs, get requests for gifts and for church suppers.  I knead my dough with vigor, smack it, and slap it around.  I roll it, braid it, slash it, mound it, mold it, free form it. .  And then I found this recipe while looking for a quick roll for supper tonight.  I watched the video that goes with it, thank goodness, or would not have believed it possible to get rolls out of such wet batter.  After the first rising, I poured the batter onto a flour dusted counter, dusted my fingers and patted the dough into a rectangle,  cut it into 12 strips, which I laid into the channels of a pre warmed, greased, cast iron bread stick pan.  The second rising took 15 minutes in the 200 degree pre warmed oven, and the bead sticks rose to double their height while baking.  They were beautiful, and good thing they came out of the oven and went straight to the table.  If they had waited to cool on the counter, the family would have eaten them before supper!  Because I rarely use sugar in my bread, I cut the sugar to 1 tablespoon.  Because of health concerns, I use canola oil instead of butter or shortening in all recipes I try.  I don't consider these two changes as altering a recipe, because they are my standards.  This is a wonderful recipe. Thank you for introducing me to the puzzling, new procedure of making bread without kneading and with wet batter.

Just follow the recipe! Not all bread is kneaded- include this in that category. Think of this recipe as if you are making a batter, it will be sticky and gloopy, but it will turn out wonderfully- just follow the recipe!! These are great for pulled pork sandwiches- I double this recipe when I make them.

I loved how these rolls came out. I followed the directions and did not change a thing and they were awesome. I got several compliments on how fluffy and good they were. Next time I will fill all twelve muffin cups in my muffin pan however, I tried to only make 8 like the recipe called for and they were HUGE. Awesome recipe, if I can do it anyone can. :)

Followed recipe exactly but added in a little seasonings because I used these for mini burgers to make sliders!  Next time I would put them in bigger muffin trays rather than the standard smaller cupcake/muffin tin size because the 8 I made were quite big.  GREAT QUICK AND EASY RECIPE!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and I ended up with 8 beautiful muffin shaped rolls!  I didnt have shortening so I used butter.  I put everything in my kitchenaid mixer and mixed it with the dough hook.  It was incredibly easy and so very tasty!  Thank you for sharing this! :)

I made these for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved them.  Instead of putting in muffin cups, I just put them directly on a cookie sheet. They came out beautifully. Other than that, I didn't change a thing.

OMG!!  I've made various attempts at baking bread but this has been the easiest ever.  I thought I did something wrong because of the stickyness but wow, just keep going.  All I did was flour my hands and a spoon to cut them into the pieces then rise again.  By far the best recipe ever.  Thank you for making bread making easy!!!

I made these yesterday with a batch of chili. And these are the best buns ever. So easy! My husband and I went for a walk while they were rising in the muffin tin. Came back put them in the oven, and 10 minutes they were done. I give these a five star.....

WOW!

I used butter in place of the shortening, and 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of all white flour, then baked as 9 pull apart rolls in an 8"x8" pan.

 I must say I am truly amazed at how light & fluffy these are, as well as the delightfully crispy exterior.

I will most definitely be making these again. And again. And again. LOL

I made these with the addition of 2Tbsp butter and upped it to 1/2 c sugar like the previous review reccomended and i poured melted butter over the top just before they were done. They were awesome!!!! I made mine in a circle pan all grouped together and they made a really nice rustic look. Definitely five stars!

These are the best rolls I've ever made.  I added just a bit of extra flour, sprinkled a bit of corn meal over the tops before baking, and brushed on melted butter after baking.  I halved the recipe and it made 12 2-1/2 inch balls which I baked in a 12 x 9 glass pan.  Really great recipe and I can't wait to try it for cinnamon rolls.

Excellent!  Followed exactly and they turned out great.  Don't let the "wet" dough fool you into adding more flour, just use a bit of flour on your spoon as you spoon them out into the pan and they won't be too sticky to handle.  I also add 1 heaping tablespoon of Honey to make them a bit sweeter and chewier ... either way they are great!

Maybe it was my error, but these turned out heavier than I expected.  Decent taste, but texture was off.  Although the MIL and grandma thought they were great!

These are the best rolls I've ever made!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I don't have a muffin pan so I just put 9 scoops into an 8x8 pan.  They turn into pull apart rolls.  I also did not have an egg so I substituted heavy cream in about the amount of an egg.  It worked and tasted delicious.  I also used butter instead of shortening.  I'm going to make these again today to go with a pot roast.  This time I'll use the egg as I'm sure they will be even tastier.

Easy and delicious! I needed a quick recipe to serve with soup and salad and this worked really well. I did double the recipe, and when the dough was risen, I dipped my hands in flour (because of the stickiness) and made balls. I placed them in loaf pans, and increased the baking time a few minutes. They turned out great and were enjoyed by all.

So easy, speedy, and tasty. Followed another reviewer's advice to follow recipe as written. I did let the dough-batter rise in the same kitchen aid bowl I mixed it in, and spooned it into the muffin cups as it was too moist to really handle. Even using 100% whole wheat, they were fluffy, and the whole family scarfed them down.

I like a very chewy thick french-bread type bread.  But I'm no bread-baker, so this is a good quick recipe and goes especially well when dipped in soup or stew because it has a very open, absorbent crumb.  The yeast should ideally be between 105 and 115 degrees, too hot and it kills the yeast, too cold and it won't activate.  Also, I heat my oven to 200 degrees, then turn it off, and put the bowl in the turned-off oven, covered with a damp tea towel, for the first rise.  This takes about 45 minutes.  The second rise takes about a half hour, and sometimes I warm up the oven again, but be sure to turn it back off for the rise.  Last batch I added 1/2 + C shredded asiago cheese to give a little flavor and they went GREAT with my potato soup.

This is a great recipe. It's very easy and delicious. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! It looks really sticky at first and you may think it won't work out, but if you follow the directions it will come out fine. I like to use a little egg wash on it before I cook it so it won't come out white.

Great flavor but don't do what I did and double the recipe!  I ended up having to pour the batter into two (2) loaf pans and ended up with two fabulous loaves of bread!!  I'm about to make a one-recipe loaf of bread now and remembered I hadn't reviewed it when I made them the first time for Christmas dinner! LOL

This was the first time I have ever used yeast and this recipe was really simple to follow and I followed exactly. These rolls are delicious, I didn't have any problems with the dough not going into the muffin cups and they baked up huge and fluffy and have a wonderful taste.

I do not understand why people have given this recipe any less than 5 stars! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderful! The dough is sticky, but once it is baked the rolls turn out to be the most soft and delicious that I have ever found! TIP: Follow the recipe exactly and they'll turn out great!

I expected a ball of dough, but realized this recipe calls for a muffin tin for a reason!  I simply spooned the dough into the tin and waited for it to rise the second time.  My family was thrilled with the results!!  These rolls have an amazing texture and the flavor is unbeatable!  I am getting ready to make them again now!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I gave them 4 stars because I know that they can be better even though it's my fault that I made them a bit dense.  I followed cookin8e's advice and instructions.  I am going to make these again and make them in Texas size muffinpans and will update you on how they came out. I cooked them longer than cookin8e said because her picture looked undercooked. See my photo if interested.

Wow...I just took these out of the oven.  They are outstanding.  The only change I made was I used half Whole Wheat Flour.  I got 9 real good size rolls from this.  Next time I may try & brush w/an egg wash.  Years ago I had a wonderful bread machine but it is no longer & my husband & I were trying to decide if we want to get another.  Especially because of the cost of bread now.  Guess what???  I just saved us $200.  These are soo very easy.  They will taste great with our Sausage soup this evening.  Also for our Thanksgiving meal.Thank you Allrecipe you are great.  Wonderful recipes & review are such a help.  Keep up the good work.
Happy Holidays to all you cooks & Allrecipes.  
Happy Cooking!

These rolls are so EASY if you follow the directions exactly! I didn't need to add anything extra... the dough is a little runny (more like a batter), but it's going in a muffin pan so it totally makes sense.  They turned out great and we'll definitely make them again.  The only "issue" I had is that because they bake in a muffin pan, they look like muffins, but taste like rolls, so it plays with your mind for a second.  :o)  I may try them in a loaf pan or something else, but for the extreme ease of this recipe, a little mind game is totally worth it.

Absolutely the best rolls I ever ate. I let the yeast bubble a bit in the water before I added the flour. This gave it a nice airy quality. I know this recipe by heart now.

I loved this recipe. My girlfriend has made them twice for me and they have come out perfect both times. Instead of using a muffin pan, we baked them on a vented cookie sheet, and they came out as a perfectly shaped bun. These buns stayed soft in tupperware for 5 days. GREAT for breakfast sandwiches too!!!

I followed this recipe exactly with one small exception. I didn't use the muffin pan. Instead I shaped the dough into six balls let them rise again and baked them on a cookie sheet. They were perfect. Try It!!!

These are awful!! I followed the recipe to a tee. I knew they were too easy to be true. They tasted like water if you can imagine that. No flavor whatsoever. Will never make this recipe again.

I was very happy with these rolls and will be making them again.  I told my husband that I thought they tasted like the ones served at a local restaurant.  He said that he had the same thought when he smelled them coming out of the oven.  Definitely a winner.

These came out very well. I made the dough in the morning and placed it in the refrigerator for the first rise. In the afternoon,  I transferred the dough to muffin tins and did the second rise in a warm place in the kitchen. I baked these just before serving and they came out great. I will definitely make these again

LOVE this recipe! It may seem like the dough is too sticky and goopy - but it results in light and fluffy beautiful rolls. I used silicon cupcake cups. So good!

HARRAHharrahHARRAH!!! For the first time ever (and I've tried often) my hot rolls were a success! It's difficult to make yeast rolls in high altitude (I'm in Denver CO), but this recipe WORKED:-) They are light, rise and don't fall-like other recipes. I made them into rolls, not in muffin cups and I used 1/2 whole wheat + 1/2 bread flour. YUMMY rolls, highly recommended, esp to those live at high altitude (over 5,000 ft).

If you follow the recipe EXACTLY as it is written it is a great basic yeast roll recipe.   If you did not follow the directions and added a bunch of flour like you do when making pizza dough you’re an idiot.

Great quick rolls that were very light and airy. Note: They are supposed to be a sticky gloopy mess, these aren't the type of rolls you knead and shape, hence cooking them in a muffin tin. I made them for Thanksgiving and with 4 of us, there were none left over. The only change I made is to use butter because I don't have shortening and they were still wonderful. With really vigorous yeast, they were oven ready in less than an hour. Make sure you cover the bowl during the first rise and the muffin tin for the second. I greased some plastic wrap because I didn't have anything that would fit over my muffin tin.

I don't usually comment on anything anywhere on the web but I couldn't believe how easy and quick bread making could be. As a mother of 4 foodies, I'm always tired and I didn't have the strength to knead bread regularly. This recipe IS a blessing. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I have used this recipe many times for a quick and easy roll recipe. Everyone always loves them, and I always end up doubling (or tripling!) the recipe. You must follow the recipe exactly to get the results that you are expecting. Many people think that shortening will work the same as butter, but it will not! They will not taste the same if you use butter, and may even end up being flatter. Butter flavored shortening has the best flavor, and it the one I always use. Although it may not be as healthy for you, you really do not use enough to do any serious harm. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a delicious and easy roll recipe-  so much better that store bought!

Follow the recipe EXACTLY as it is written! They turned out great!! I was able to make twelve out of the amount of dough the recipe produced. Also, don't worry about how sticky the dough is, it is supposed to be like that.

I made this recipe exact many times. Yes. The dough is sticky. So this time I thought I would take the advice of other reviewers. Big mistake. For several reasons. 1. Too much flour means the dough doesn't have enough moisture to rise. 2. Too much flour also means your rolls turn out so heavy they could be used to brick your next house...my advice...deal with the stickiness of the dough. The end result if worth it

These were incredible!  I am a complete novice in the kitchen, and my husband comes from a family of the best Southern cooks ever, so I am nervous when I cook something I know they do well.  These are so much easier than biscuits, especially in a *well greased* muffin pan.  I brushed the tops of them with butter before and after baking (thanks, Chef John), and presented them to my husband….who promptly ate the whole batch.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I'v been baking bread forever...this is so easy and absolutely delish!!!!...I did use honey in place of sugar, I make this when I have anything pasta....goes great!!!!...THANKS FOR THE RECIPE....UPDATE..DONT ADD EXTRA FLOUR!!!...this isn't the bread your knead 8 or 9 times..its suppose to be wet and gooy..follow directions exactly and you will be amazed!!..I just use a spoon and stir everything...proofing your yeast is your biggest step...make sure its frothy looking before you add egg and flour.These have to be baked in a muffin pan.

I thought the directions were vague & didn't have time to read the reviews so I ended up changing things a little.  I used coconut oil for my shortening and Pink Himalayan Sea Salt for the salt, which I was a little heavy handed with, I'm afraid.  I used about a tablespoon of honey instead of the sugar.  I sprinkled a little more flour over the top of the sticky dough (about a tablespoon) and then gave it a little kneading- three or four folds & covered it for rising for about 45 minutes.  After it rose, I rubbed my hands with oil and broke off portions to fit into my silicone muffin cups and rotated the dough under so the top was smooth and the bottom "hid" the edges of the rolls.  I let them sit about 10 minutes before smearing a finger dampened with olive oil across the top, which I think helped give them a golden top.  They were delish with our soup on this chilly night.

I made two batches of this for my first try, and. Made them pull apart in 8x8 pans instead of the muffin tin. The first batch was regular, which turned out delicious! For the second batch, I used 1 1/2 tsps garlic salt instead of regular salt, then added 1 tsp rosemary, and 1 tsp thyme. The regular ones were delicious, but the herb-seasoned ones were to DIE for!! This is definitely going to be my go-to roll recipe from now on!

As for the dough, yes, it was very soft, but like everyone else says, MAKE IT AS IT SAYS, and DO NOT add extra flour! They are PERFECT as the recipe is written!!

I was so excited to try these because they looked like my mom's yeast rolls in the picture. They were so doughy, even after cooking for 4 additional minutes (after the suggested 10). They had no taste and were not light and airy at all. Maybe if I sifted the flour before adding they would have turned out better. Who knows.

Loved the rolls....I did increase the sugar and the salt a little, but other than that just followed the recipe. This one is a keeper for sure.

THIS RECIPE MAKES A BATTER-LIKE DOUGH.  IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WET!!!  DON'T ADD EXTRA FLOUR!!!!
There are only 2 things that need changing in this recipe - first, don't preheat the oven until part way through the second rise.  it's silly to put "preheat oven" in the first stop when it's going to be at least an hour before you're ready to use it.  Second, double the recipe.  It doubles and triples well.  These rolls are so good, they'll be gone before dinner if you only make 1 batch!

What an absolutely fabulous recipe! I've been trying recipes from this site for years now but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. These rolls were amazing. I followed the recipe exactly as written down and, for the first time ever (I am hopeless at making bread and all my previous attempts at making bread rolls have invariably produced rolls with the texture and appearance of small rocks) I managed to bake the most wonderful bread rolls. Even my extremely picky teenager raved over them. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I can't believe the reviews! I followed the recipe exactly after reading many reviews. The dough was exactly what I expected. I baked as tear-apart rolls instead of in muffin tins. After ten minutes in the oven (per instructions), I removed them and brushed with melted butter, and returned to the oven for 2 more minutes under the broiler to give them a golden color. They sure looked pretty. Then my husband (who could eat a dozen good yeast rolls at a time) tore into one and cringed. They were not raw, as in there was no part "uncooked", but the overwhelming yeast smell and doughy texture immediately turned him off. So I threw the whole pan back in the oven for another 12 minutes, and the same reaction. While the texture of the dough looks promising, there is WAY too much yeast, and the flavor is terrible. Will NOT make again and cannot recommend on any point.

I made the recipe exactly as described and they turned out great.  My wife thought they were some of the best dinner rolls I have ever made.  They taste great and have great texture.  I will be be making them again.

What most people don't realize is that when it comes to breads, you can't always follow the recipe exactly. It depends on humidity, the moisture in your flour, amount of gluten, freshness of your yeast, etc.  You have to adjust a little and do it by feel sometimes.

This recipe is great! The dough was gloppy and hard to work with. Next time I will grease my fingers before dropping in the pan. In my opinion, sweetness is good, but they could use a bit more salt. I just used plain shortening (which has no flavor at all) as the recipe called for. To me, they would have had a more buttery flavor if I had used margarine or butter, or butter flavored shortening. They were very light and fluffy, melt in your mouth. I let rise about 30 minutes the first rise, then about 30 minutes the second rise in the cake pan. Next time I will allow to rise a bit longer. I didn't use a muffin pan, just a 9x12 rectangular cake pan, and they spread out a bit, making square shaped pull apart bread, a little smaller than your average hamburger bun. I really think my pan was to big, and they expanded out instead of up. But all in all, I enjoyed the texture and the taste was a little bland, but once I spread some margarine on it, they were great. Next time I will add more salt and use margarine instead of shortening, or maybe a 1/4 t. of butter flavoring to the shortening mixture.

I absolutely love this recipe and it will always be my go to recipe for rolls.  I have tried making rolls before and failed.  My brother (a chef) makes delicious rolls.  He showed me how the dough should look and feel and therefore I decided to look for an easy yeast roll recipe to try and I stumbled upon this recipe.  The rolls were sooooo delicious, very light and airy.  I will definitely make these rolls again and again.

They were so easy and forgiving! I was in a rush to make them I didn't let them rise as long as I should have and I didn't mix or knead as long as I should have and they STILL came out light fluffy tender and very good flavor the perfect dinner roll! I am so glad I have this recipe. My family loved them and have said from now on we want THESE dinner rolls! Thank you for posting this recipe!!!

This recipe is SO good.  Follow it to the tee and you won't be disappointed.  The only thing I changed is that I used flour marked as high altitude flour (I'm up in the mountains).  But it was so good.

Okay, so I know mysterman was joking to make a point, but I have to say that I didn't have shortening or margarine or butter...but I did have bacon fat- so I used that (inspired by him :D). I also try to avoid using processed sugar, so I used molasses. I did, however, use flour and yeast. Yes, the dough was very sticky, but I just spooned it into greased muffin tins and baked for 8 minutes (I made 12 rolls). They were wonderful!

FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS: They are supposed to be sticky/messy at first. These turned out wonderful! I have never made anything with yeast and was definitely impressed!!  Yay, they were so easy to make as long as you followed the directions, i just covered the bowl with a warm, damp cloth and let it rise.   Will absolutely make these again, probably tomorrow, as time got too late to make another batch tonight!   lol
Thank you for sharing this recipe

I've been doing Allrecipes.com for the past two years and this recipe was SO good that I'm finally doing my first rating. Followed previous tips that said to 'NOT add any flour' ...it's suppose to be a little liquidy...no worries. Follow it to the recipe to the T! I let the dough rise 1 hr and then 30 min in the muffin tin. It helps when rising the dough in the muffin tin to spray PAM on saran wrap and then lay it over the muffin tin. They rise better and then don't stick to the saran wrap when you're done.

I was totally ready to bash this recipe when I saw how soupy the dough had turned out. However, these turned out to be some of the best rolls I had ever eaten. They are very economical, easy to make and tasty. The only drawback I had was the portioning.The dough is so sticky, it cannot be rolled in a traditional manner. I dropped the portions, by spoonful, onto a medium floured board, rolled lightly, dropped into the muffin tins and buttered the tops before serving. Voila.

Easy, FAST, and just like my grandmother used to make! Yes, a little sticky, but try to resist adding more flour, as they just aren't the same texture if you do.  I always melt butter and brush them as soon as they come out of the oven.....big fat yum !!

So easy, so good, followed recipe to the T but required a few more minutes in the oven. I had no issue with the dough/batter consistency because I have made the no knead bread which has a similar stickiness and it was wonderful.

Best buns I've ever made. for 3 years i having been trying to make dinner rolls and some how always fail in one way or another. I have tried many recipes and this is the first recipe that worked on the first try. Beautiful, fluffy and soft. Taste amazing.
 I was really worried when it was looking more like cake batter then any bread dough I'd seen, but I just let it rise in the bowl and spooned it into the muffin tins. It took everything in me not to add flour but it was so worth it.
 Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!!

I made this last night for dinner.  The recipe is perfect. Kinda reminds me of what I grew up with. I rolled my dough into balls the size of golf ball and put them in a greased baking dish.  Turned out wonderful. I will make these a lot.

Made these last night and doubled the recipe as suggested in another review.  Placed extra rolls in the freezer and hoping I can just heat them up like you do Rhodes brown and serve.  If so it will save me lots of money on my grocery bill.  My gradkids LOVE bread.... they come by it honestly.

These are amazing! I usually suck at making dinner rolls, but these turned out perfect. I loved everything about them the flavor, the light texture, and how easy they are to make. Right after they came out of the oven I brushed the tops with melted butter. Thanks for the great recipe, I will be making this alot!

I am terrible at making yeast breads.  I have tried or 5 years and the only thing I make somewhat decent in Ciabatta.  So when I ran across this recipe my mouth was watering for a great chewy yeasty tasting fluffy bread.  That was 2 hours ago.  So I made the recipe exactly, except I found that I only had instant yeast.  The texture is more like cake then a yeast roll. but very tasty and quick.  I wish the recipe writer would have given more information about times to let rise.  I took the 1 hour and 40 minutes to deduce that. Will I make this again? yes.  If I am in a pinch, and I do want to try it one more time with regular yeast.  I did substitute butter for the shortening as I rarely cook with shortening and mine had an off smell.  Could that have made the difference?

The rolls turned out great,  it may seem like the batter is wayyy too sticky to knead or roll, but i think that,s the way its meant to be... to help shape the rolls i did add some flour to my hands.. the rolls turned out sooo soft and yummy... i have made it twice thus far... and will make it again and again

I made these rolls for Thanksgiving, I couldnt believe how simple they were. The rolls turn out perfectly and they were absolutely delicious and a big hit with the family, so much so I made them for Christmas and got the same result. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe until time to drop into muffin pans... the dough was super sticky, so I heavily floured my table and rolled it ONLY *just* enough to make it easier to work with.  I wouldn't even call it kneading, really. Then I divided it out.  They turned out great!  They might have been fluffier if I hadn't added flour, but they still turned out great and very airy.   The only complaint I have for this recipe is that there isn't any kneading- so how else do I take out my frustration?  ;-)  Guess I'll just have to eat an extra roll or two.  
Next time I make this, I think I'll use oiled spoons to divide and drop the rolls into muffin pans.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have muffin cups so I baked it in an 9 by 9 pan and it came out great. I will definitely make it again.

DO NOT add extra flour to this recipe! The wet dough makes nice fluffy, light-as-air buns. This is an excellent beginner recipe. I lightly grease my hands and roll the dough in to little balls and make buns as we like these for lunch as well. I have cut the recipe in half a couple of times and get consistent results.

I made these rolls and had just taken them out of the oven when my son and his family
(FOUR BOYS) came in. the rolls didn't last long. They were light and fluffy. Glad I read the reviews, the batter was very wet but because of the reviews, I didn't add flour.   very good.

I was really happy with this recipe. The dough is very wet but I just dusted it with flour then grabbed globs and put them in the cupcake pan. Very fluffy and no nonsense. I double and bake them-use what I need and keep the rest in the freezer and reheat. Thanks....good recipe.

Very soft & fluffy, I used this recipe for the dough to make coffee cake for my husband & his army buddies.  They absolutely loved the bread for the coffee cake, but they'll eat just about anything ;) 
As for the stickiness I just sprayed my hands w/cooking spray & that worked out great. 
I will use this for future yeast rolls & my coffee cake.  No longer buy the frozen ones :)

OMG!  So good!  This was my first time making buns and I needed a quick recipe to take to dinner.  Tastes very similar to my mom's buns, and putting them in muffins tins makes it so easy!  Will make again and again!

I have recently made a few different rolls, now that I have conquered my fear of yeast!  THese were the best I've tried yet.  I used bread flour, not all purpose, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. These will be a staple in our household. My two teenaged boys couldn't get enough of them.

This is an awesome recipe;  I use a little less flour and mix just until dough stops sticking to bowl.  I also have made herb rolls and cinnamon rolls with this recipe.

Having never cooked with yeast, and then having read some of the reviews about shaping into balls and greasing the outsides, I wonder if the recipe instructions were incomplete.  Is it a given that one should do these things?  Also, mine came out actually tasting like yeast.  It was a bit unpleasant, and not at all like yeast rolls I'm used to at restaurants.  My husband liked them okay, and ate two at dinner, but I couldn't even finish one.  I will try these again some other time to see if they turn out better.

I did make this exactly as is, with the exception of the cooking in the muffin pans. Didn't change any ingredients. May have been the weather, but I think I'd like a little more flour. I will continue to use this recipe, however. It was great, and extremely easy to make. Thanks so much.

**I feel I have to re-rate this recipe as to cancel out the ratings of a couple of recent "experts"  First of all do not rate a recipe that you have changed--this is not beneficial for the original recipe.  Secondly, in response to a couple of recent "expert" postings--this is a "quick yeast bread" recipe so it is DESIGNED to be a little wetter--DO NOT add additional flour to this recipe.  Thirdly, this is NOT a bread machine recipe--this recipe is meant to be made the "Old Fashioned" way and the EXPERT who claimed her precious yeast was "Waisted" if the recipe is followed as directed then no ingredient will be WASTED!  This is an exceptionally easy and wonderfully delicious recipe.  The rolls bake up light, fluffy, and slightly sweet and yeasty.  I would kindly like to remind those whose gave a lower rating because of the dough texture--This dough will be more like a STIFF BATTER and not like typical bread or roll dough--so it will not be able to be shaped into balls, etc.  A very good and easy recipe just the same!

I followed the recipe exactly, and these turned out pretty well.  They were more dense than I expected-more of a muffin than a traditional roll.  They tasted great and were easy to make; however, I will probably try another recipe to get the consistency I was looking for.  I will probably make these again since they were so simple!

I didn't have any all-purpose flour, (I know, how can a baker run out of that!), so I used a little over 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1 and 1/4 cup = 2 tablespoons cake flour.  They turned out light, airy, with a slightly sweet taste and a nice slightly crisp outside.  My husband, who doesn't like wheat bread, even liked them!  I can't wait to see how they turn out with all-purpose! :)

These rolls are perfect as is.  Do not add flour or they will be too dense.  Just use a spoon to pour batter in muffin cups or pour in individual portions in 9 x 13 pan and they will rise and bake into individual rolls.  So simple!

These came out awesome! Followed the recipe exactly and had no problems what so ever.  The trick to remember is this is more of a batter than a dough, so no, you wont be able to roll it in to neat little balls - I just spooned it in to the muffin tins and they came out perfect - a definite keeper!

Thank you for sharing such a wonderful and easy recipe for us first timers. I had tried a recipe from an old recipe book of my grandmother's to no success. That didn't discourage me in the least, and had my mind set on making more rolls as soon as possible. I found your recipe and followed it to the letter, and" bam" beautiful yeast rolls.  Thank you again!!

These were absolutely amazing! I have no idea why anyone would have rated these poorly.  The only substitution I made was 2 T of butter because I was out of shortening and I followed the rest to a T and they turned out great!  I will make theses whenver I get a chance!  Thank you for the amazing recipe!

I haven't made home made yeast rolls in many, many years, but decided to make these when I read how quick they were. I'm so glad I did! These were great! Our guests loved them and so did we. I didn't put them in muffin tins, however. I just put them in a rectangular pan and let them squeeze up next to each other. They pulled apart beautifully! I will make these again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very easy, Make sure you keep dipping a table spoon in Flour while putting the mixture into the Tins.

I don't know what I did wrong. They turned out very spongy and dense. I didn't add any extra flour like some suggested. After the initial rise it filled up 12 muffin cups instead of 8. When baking, the tops didn't want to brown up and the sides got very dark. Not sure if I'll try this recipe again.

I was making dinner for my mom and had promised dinner rolls but forgot until I had started dinner.  I found this recipe and let them rise on the stovetop while I was baking like another reviewer said to help them rise quicker and it worked like a charm.  They turned out great just as the recipe is!  And my mom was impressed.

Thank you! Followed recipe exactly, and it's so good, so easy! Perfect for one person who can't do kneading anymore due to arthritis. If family is coming, I will certainly double recipe and impress them!!  Thanks again!

Word to the novice...yes-the dough is extremely sticky, but it is supposed to be. The stickier the dough the lighter the roll- do not add more flour it makes them too heavy. If you follow the directions then this recipe makes perfect airy light yeast rolls. Thank you so much for sharing this one!!!

I thought these rolls were ok. I, like others, do not care for shortening in much of anything I bake or cook but I had some that I needed to get rid of so I used it. I felt the flavor of the rolls was pretty bland. I think I prefer a more simple and healthy yeast roll that does not require butter or shortening. I think I am in the minortiy in this thinking though so don't take my word for it.

SORRY! FOLLOWED THE RECIPE TO THE T.  This was the most sticky mess.  I had it stuck everywhere by the time I got this batter in the muffin pan.  They were just ok. Not worth the stress and mess.  I will keep looking for something that works for me:)

WOW!!! I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of baking the rolls in a glass pan instead of muffin tins. I will definitely have to make at LEAST a double batch next time. As they have only been out of the oven for 15 minutes and 4 are already gone, they are not going to make it to dinner! I have been looking for a good dinner roll recipe for a long time and I have finally found it!!! Thanks for posting these terrific rolls!

YUM! We had 3 rolls left after dinner tonight and they're calling to me to come back for more! ;) I used quick yeast and followed the instructions on the pkg for the first rise, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My dough was sticky also but I just went with it and we thought they were phenomenal!!

These turned out really well.  I used butter instead of shortening.  It made 12 large rolls, instead of 8.  The dough IS sticky, but don't worry, they turn out well. My husband really loves these, and I love how easy they are, no work at all, just a little messy!

The flavor was OK. I think next time I will use butter instead of shortening. Also, add 1/2 tsp. salt. The texture is also not as light as I would have liked. But, they are easy to make and I will probably make them again with minor modifications.

These were delicious!  I substituted the sugar with an equal amount of honey, and used 1 c. of whole wheat flour for 1 c. of the all-purpose.  Three of us (my husband, 2-year old, and I) almost finished the whole batch!  I will double it for guests, and maybe even for us next time!

I loved these rolls! I've had a hard time with other recipes getting my rolls to raise and be fluffy. These plumped right up. I was a little worried at first with how sticky the batter was, but I went ahead and spooned the dough into the muffin pan and they turned out great, and huge! I finally found a recipe I can make!

Really liked these, and very easy to make.  This was my first time making yeast rolls by myself, and absolutely no problems, followed the recipe exactly.  However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my hubby and I both thought it tasted a little too sweet.  Next time I might add a little melted butter, and less sugar to get closer to the flavor we were looking for.

These rolls were pretty good, but not what I was looking for. They cooked up relatively quickly, but like it says, you still have to let them rise. They were a little too cake-like for my preference, but had good flavor

Pretty good.  A very versitile, user-friendly recipe.  The dough was a bit sticky, but it is not designed to be tossed like a pizza.  I added extra sugar and 1 TBS 1/2 of Herbs de Province (with lavender) to the dough.  I topped with crumbled Feta before baking.  I also substituted 8 mini loaf pans for the muffin cups, for a fluffier roll and unique presentation.  These cute little loaves complimented my dinner nicely, and were a tasty alternative for sandwiches the next day.  I will make these sooon, and perhaps experiment with shallots or roasted garlic.

My whole family are bread lovers, so I have been trying different recipes.  This is one of the best.  It is really easy and quick.  The advantage of using the muffin cups means I don't have to roll these out by hand.  Definately a good roll.

I've never made bread or rolls from scratch in my life and these worked out great!  I had to add  a little more flour because my dough was a little too sticky, but other than that, they were great!

Good grief bakers! These are great. Follow the recipe AS IS. It is not an elastic dough that you will shape. So don't worry about it or try to make it be that way. The recipe is wonderful. Relax and try not to tweak this.

These came out perfect!  DO NOT CHANGE THE RECIPE!!  The  dough will be runny, so do not be tempted to add more flour!  If you follow the recipe, they will turn out great.  My family loved them!

Just came out of the oven and my goodness! They are just perfect! I did however used a regular baking pan rather than a muffin pan and I added egg wash to the top of mine before baking to add that extra brown and they are so good! My husband loves them! Will certainly be baking these again!

I've been making these rolls for our weekly big family dinner, doubling the recipe, baking them on a buttered sheet pan (I get two dozen rolls) and brushing the tops with honey butter.   Everybody loves them!   Today I ran short on time so greased the sheet pan liberally with olive oil, dumped out the whole glob of dough and spread it into a focaccia --topped with sea salt, a dusting of granulated garlic, and fresh rosemary.   Really easy and really good.

TIP: Spray Pam or oil hands before working with dough. -  Ive never made yeast rolls before- but I've made  ALOT of other breads before! These are great!! I made the recipe as is!! No extra this or that! I use a muffin tin for giant muffins and got 6 big boys! The hubby is eating them like a horse and he has the flu!!  - I made them with homemade chicken soup. Yes the dough is soft I just used a spoon to drop it into muffin tin. If you add more flour - you ARE changing this recipe to a regular dinner roll recipe.  And they will not be as light and fluffy. I did proof my yeast - first with 1 tbs. Sugar and 1/2 c.  Warm Water for 8 min. - just out of habit! Idt it made a difference.  Proof or not - these are GREAT!! Tip: Oil hands before working with dough ( keeps it from sticking to hands!) I also coated dough lightly with oil before first rise- like you do with other bread recipes) I've made these at least 10 times so far!! Follow the recipe as written - oil your hands and coat your dough and you won't need extra flour at all!

This recipe is definitely going in my recipe box!  I followed it exactly and the rolls came out great.  The only "quick" yeast roll recipe I have used before is the one that came with my Kitchen Aid, and that one is not nearly as good. I'm glad I read the reviews because I would have been weirded out by the super sticky dough otherwise.

Woweee...I just got done making these rolls and they delish...the recipe was easy to make.  After I let the dough rise in the bowl I punched it down then separated it and put it in the muffin pan. I was able to get 10 nice sized rolls. Thank you  so much for such a good and easy recipe.  Please NOTE...YOU DO NOT KNEED THIS DOUGH. You simply stir and rise.

Perfect!! Just like store bought. Follow the recipe exactly! I just coated my hands in flour and scooped the very sticky dough into muffin tins. I actually got 12 rolls out of this recipe.

Made these exactly as the recipe details and they were perfect.  Prior reviewer from 2011 (pastry chef) stated dough s/b sticky and gooey and to use a scoop to transfer to muffin tins.  Followed his advice! Definitely a keeper.

I used exact measurements, threw it in my bread machine, shaped my own rolls and used my Grandma's skillet to bake till golden brown (12 mins).  They were perfect!

Turned out beautifully, didn't change a thing. Dough was sticky. I coated my hand in coconut oil and pulled off pieces of the risen dough and dropped them into the muffin tins. Rose for 35 mins, got twice as tall when baked.

I was so surprised that it would take so little time to make yeast rolls, but I'm sold on this recipe!  The rolls turn out light and fluffy and dreamy!  It's a pretty sticky dough, and I don't really think it's one that's meant for a ton of kneading.  Just make sure the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, and you'll be fine.

If your rolls come out looking any less than totally jacked up, you added too much flour. If your rolls have smooth tops and you were able to handle these without sticky fingers, you added too much flour! Back away from the flour, people! Don't be scared! I typically go with the super quick rolls that take about 35-40 minutes from start to finish. However, I was a bit bored with them so I decided to try this recipe. Kicked the 40 minute rolls to the curb and these have been moved to the top of the recipe binder.

I doubled the recipe which made 16 rolls and they were all gone within 24 hours (between myself, my husband, and three young boys). I used my kitchenaid mixer and will be tripling the recipe this time so I can use all the muffin cups in my two 12-cup muffin pans.

The only change I made was to use half whole wheat flour and half AP organic flour since the AP organic gets expensive. The rolls were really very good and I assume it would be even better with all white flour. I baked them for a total of 13 minutes because they were not quite done after 10. I stuck a knife in two of them and they both were still very doughy toward the bottom.

Do yourselves a favor and follow this recipe as is!! These rolls are super easy & so delicious. I read other reviews & decided the best way to make them was the exact way the original posters great grandma had made them. I seriously do not like when folks tamper with recipes & then complain about the outcome. It's a very loose & sticky dough so use heavily floured tools to cut & spoon into tins. You will not be disappointed!

Excellent recipe! Wanted an easy, no fuss, light yeast bun to accompany Turkey Corn Chowder. This was just perfect.
Mixed the dough in the food processor with the knead attachment and let it rise there. The dough was quite loose, but I didn't mess with the ingredient proportions. Glad I didn't!
Didn't feel like messing with a muffin tin, so I doubled the recipe and dropped large spoonfuls into a large casserole dish lined with parchment...the rest went into a loaf pan. I also brushed melted herbed butter over just before they went in the oven.  When cooled but still warm, popped right off the paper in the casserole pan like pull apart buns, and the loaf sliced beautifully. Came out light and fluffy.  Scrumptious!

Try these and follow the exact directions for the dough! I baked them differently because I couldn't find my muffin tin. I dropped the dough in a little flour then placed them in a cast iron pan. 

Baked the same and tasted perfect!

This was my first attempt at making bread, ever.  I waited over an hour and the dough never doubled in size.  I moved the gloppy mess into the muffin pan and waited another hour and it didn't rise a millimeter.  Finally, I gave up and threw them in the oven.  After 12 minutes they were done on the bottom but still raw and doughy inside.  The parts that did cook all the way through were extremely dense.  The taste was alright, so I'm going to say this is mostly my lack of experience.

AMAZING!!! DELICIOUS!!!  I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and they turned out PERFECT. I am a working Mom and I love to cook. I am always looking for a good recipe, especially for recipes that remind me of my mother and grandmothers  cooking. These yeast rolls made me think my Nana was in the kitchen. I agree the most recent post, don't change anything and follow the recipe exactly as it is written.  (I have eaten 3 rolls while typing this review). DELICIOUS!!!  YUMMY!!!

These yeast rolls are very tender and just a hint of sweetness!  
I baked in a cake tin and they were all touching like easy pull apart rolls and came out perfect. 
This is a favorite!!! 
Thank you !

I followed the advice of the pastry chef and did not alter the recipe at all. I DID however mix it all in my food processer and the dough came out great, sticky like everyone said, but totally worth getting my hands all sticky with dough for the great taste of homemade yeast rolls. I have never made hem at home, but this recipe was so quick and easy. Can't wait to make them with my daughter and let her get her hands all goopy. Thanks so much.

WOW. I could not believe how easy and delicious this recipe was.  I made it exactly per the original instructions and the texture and density after baking was perfect! The dough was gooey prior to baking, but like other reviewers have stated this is how it is supposed to be for a quick-bread like this. I will make them again tonight and add a little extra salt and some herbs for personal preference and experimentation - but overall this is a great recipe for super quick fresh-made dinner rolls.  Ignore the nay-sayer reviews on this recipe and just follow the instructions and they will cook wonderfully.

If you try this recipe and follow the instructions completely, you will not be disappointed.  This is best tasting bread, and it so easy to make.  Soft, flavorful, simple.  I used mini ceramic loaf pans for sandwiches.  I just poured/scooped with a spoon the wet/sticky dough in.  So perfect! I will be making these regularly.  Thank you!

Easy, fast and good. Exactly what I was looking for. The dough is sticky, gloopy, runny, almost like thick pancake batter, its fine trust the recipe. When these bake up they are fluffy, soft, lightly sweet and DELICIOUS! I used butter instead of shortening because of personal preference. Fresh rolls on your table don't get any simpler than this, maybe 10 min of actual effort, tops.

EASY AND DELISH! I used melted butter instead of shortening, and doubled the recipe with no problem. I used a WISK to mix the whole thing in a giant bowl. DON'T KNEAD. The dough is SUPPOSED TO BE SOFT. Don't add flour. I let it rise on my dryer for an hour, then scooped it into buttered muffin tins with a buttered spoon and let them rise another half hour. (Melt butter in a measuring cup and brush it on the tops, the spoon, etc. which is so easy.) Baked for 10 minutes, as the recipe says. Very nice!

I have made this recipe exactly as written at least a dozen times.  The only change I sometimes make is dividing into 10 rolls instead.  My family loves the taste of these fluffy fresh rolls.

I kept wanting to ask questions so thank you to the other reviewers for helpful tips! This are light and fluffy and delicious. I doubled my batch and used 5tbsp of butter instead of 4 shortening per recommendations when doing substitutions (I don't keep shortening on hand). I used bread flour and quick rise yeast which sped up my rise times a little. I did one batch in my muffin pan and the other on a greased cookie sheets, basically putting globs on the cookie sheet, no clue how someone made balls as it is very sticky. Both turned out good though! Just don't overthink it ;)!

This is.a Great recipe!  Let yeast set for 10 minutes till it foams.  Stir very well.let rise about an hour in a warm place, maybe a cooling oven. After 1st rise stir again before putting in cups. To get a nice brown, after 3 min in oven, brush tops with either milk or egg wash(beaten egg) I actually had to look on 4 different sites to find the yeast time, rising time and brown tips. I would a saved a lot of money and time had I known these things, so its a good recipe just not great instructions..

I've used this recipe twice so far but instead of making rolls out of it I've been making it in loaf pans. Easy and delish. The whole family can't stop eating it until it's gone. Thanks for the great recipe.

Ok it is seriously ridiculous how good these were. As some other reviewers I made them in a small round cake pan. I did brush them with melted butter and sprinkled Weber's garlic and herb seasoning on them before baking. They went great with my home-made split pea soup! So yummy! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

Super easy recipe if you hate to wait forever for yeast rolls. Worked well if I just spooned the very sticky batter into the muffin tin. You will get 8 extra large rolls or you can stretch the dough a little further and get 12 regular rolls. I was able to triple the recipe successfully for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! Thanks!

Follow the recipe! The batter is supposed to be sticky. The benefit of this recipe is that there is no punching down and no rolling like typical yeast rolls. After it's doubled once, you just pinch off pieces of batter and place them in a muffin tin to rise again before you bake.

I have never posted a review on this site but felt the need to.  I really have never baked before and just happened upon this recipe while looking through recipes for Thanksgiving.  They were extremely easy to make and were absolutely delicious!  The only change I made is using margarine in place of shortening because I didn't have any.  I will definitely be making these several times in the future. WAY better then store bought buns!

I doubled the recipe this time; they turned out even better! I live in a cold climate, so I made sure to give them plenty of time to rise next to the woodstove. My husband and I agree, this batch is the best! Light, airy, not too sweet; we almost don't want to share them with the rest of the family.

These came out perfect! At first I thought the amounts were off because the dough was so sticky. I was amazed when I opened up the oven! These were perfectly fluffy and delicious. I'm glad I found this recipe before Thanksgiving.

Great recipe....I used lard in place of shortening and more flour for easier handling. I also doubled the recipe to make 18 twin rolls in muffin tins. Although I made some changes, I gave it 5 stars because it's a keeper!

I made these last night and they were gone before dinner arrived!  I have tired 4/5 different recipes and this is simple and AWESOME.  I did not change one thing about it.  It is perfect for me being single to have a recipe for only 8 rolls and the option to double it if I need to. I used a round cake pan vs a muffin tin but plan to use the muffin tin next time and do the cloverleaf affect....TY for sharing this with us!!!!

Amazing, delicious and super easy! I had almost given up on making buns after numerous failures. I followed the recipe except I used butter instead of shortening. I also used quick rise yeast so rise time was faster. I spooned the sticky dough into the muffin tins, let rise and voila - light, airy tasteful buns!

I just made these rolls for the first time and they turned out very well.
I did find that the dough was sticky but proceeded with the recipe as written as I always do when trying a new recipe from this site.
This recipe is a keeper as written. Very easy, nice flavour.  I will make again for sure.

This was pretty good; you have to realize that the "dough" is pretty batter-y.  The only advantage was no kneading.  Very light and fluffy rolls.

Followed the recipe perfectly and got very nice rolls, although a bit bland. Just tasted the sugar slightly. Maybe needed more salt? Or maybe I am desiring the flavor of whole wheat? I made these once before using nothing but whole wheat; I think the taste was good but the texture suffered. Next time I'll probably try a split of both flours. Well, as for this recipe-accurate batch I'm sure a little butter on top will fix them up.

I wouldn't bother starting to preheat your oven until you're done with step 2. Too many yeast recipes tell you to preheat your oven when it'll be 1.5-2 hours minimum before you use it. And yeah, recipes should spell out the fundamentals of yeast for us newbies :( The first yeast recipe I used was a waffle recipe that had me adding the yeast to scalding hot milk!

I'm a culinary arts teacher and use this recipe all the time. The dough is sticky but it works great. Adding more flour to dry out the dough does'nt hurt the recipe. mix the yeast in 110 degree water to activate for quicker rise time.

This is my first time making rolls from scratch... I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out wonderful! My fiance and I both tried one as soon as they came out of the oven, and had the rest with dinner... I'm in the process of making another batch now... My fiance asked if I would make more to have with honey tomorrow for breakfast.... I love how simple this recipe is, and how versatile these rolls can be... We plan to try some with italian seasoning and garlic powder sometime as well! Thank you for sharing your family recipe!

These are so yummy, I ate 3 right out of the oven and wanted more! I used butter instead of shortening and dropped them by spoonfuls into a greased 8" x 12" pan. Mine baked 12 minutes. FAST, FLUFFY, DELICIOUS and EASY. I will be making these often since my bread machine broke. Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I use it quite often and have never had any problems. What I love the most about this recipe is that you can just scoop up some of the dough, drop it into a muffin cup, and bake it and they turn out perfect. Depending on what I serve these with, I usually either keep the sugar amount the same or just use 2 tablespoons.

I was a little worried by how sticky the dough was, but I heeded the other comments. I was not disappointed and neither were the kids. This is now my Go-To when baking dinner rolls. 
The only thing I've ever done to alter the rolls is when nearly done is brush it was fresh pressed garlic butter and a sprinkling Parmesan. 
Excellent recipe.

Wonderful!!  I should have read the reviews before I made them, because I added a little more flour not knowing that is the way they are suppose to be.  They were light and tasty...am planning on making four or five batches for Christmas.  I didn't use muffin tins...I just dropped them by tablespoons on the pan.

This was a great recipe! I don't have that much experience making bread,but I really wanted to try. I found yeast and went to work. I made this recipe twice. Last night I made it with liquid shortening and I didn't t wait long enough for it to rise. Needless to say they were extremely gummy. :( This afternoon I decided to try again. I substituted solid butter for shortening ( the butter melted) and I waited over an hour for the dough to rise. This was great! I also put a small pat of butter in the middle of the dough before it rose in the muffin pans. They turned out crispy and salty/ sweet on the outside. Definitely will be making these again. :)

Great rolls!  Easy and delicious, used butter instead of shortening in a pinch but no extra flour. Used ice cream scooper to get them in muffin tin because its a very sticky and stretchy dough and turned out awesome, soft and tender. Made 12 rolls that we devoured!!! Also used about half of sugar since I didn't want them sweet. I've made these as 6 hamburger buns too! Got huge and a bit flat but still worked and soooo much better than regular buns!

Extremely simple to make, and they turn out amazing! For anyone adding extra flour to whats recommended don't! The more flour you add the denser the rolls will be. It IS sticky but they turn out very light and fluffy. To help spoon it into the muffin pan lightly grease your spoon and just scoop it from the bowl no sticky fingers but amazing, light dinner rolls.

the taste was good, but my problem with with the rising of the dough...  my first rise in the bowl went great - the 2nd rise in the muffin cups not so good.  They rose, but then spread out and my muffin tin looked like it was a sheet cake pan - no discernible individual rolls at all.  This was my first try, so I will give it another shot and see if it was something I may have done in error.  Thanks for sharing!

Not sure what happened but the dough was so sticky I couldn't work with it, even after adding almost double the flour. I ended up forming them into two large round loaves and cooking at 375 for about 30 minutes. They're ok though a bit too sweet.

I didn't have AP flour so used half whole wheat and half bread flour. The texture was just OK, but that may have been because of my flour substitutes so I am not basing the stars on that. I give this recipe 4 stars because it is quite bland. I would increase the salt next time by half tsp and use butter, margarine or butter flavored shortening in place of regular shortening. I loved that these were done in less than 2 hours. Also, my dough was not too wet. A tad sticky, but nothing like cake batter like others have mentioned. It was a sticky bread dough, nothing less. Perhaps due to the flours I used. Will make again with my prior noted adjustments. Thanks.

These are fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly, the dough was very sticky but I persevered and didn't add extra flour.  Definitely worth the extra hand washing it took to get it off my fingers.  The texture is perfect!  Top it off with some cinnamon honey butter and you can't go wrong.  
UPDATE:  I made these again the very next morning, I substituted butter for shortening and it worked great.  Also, spray an ice scream scooper w/ cooking spray and use that to scoop the dough into the muffin pan, it works like a charm!

Very Good Recipe! Nice light and fluffy.. went very nicely with our soup. I was afraid that they wouldn't turn out very well because they wouldn't double in size the first time, I think maybe it wouldn't hurt if you told us how long to wait for it to double, because if you are a beginner like me, you have no idea :)
So, they didn't double in size the first time, but the second time, after being in the muffin cups, did double in size and they cooked perfectly. Very yummy, everybody enjoyed them. Also, I did not use shortening, I used regular margarine. Seemed to work fine. Thanks for the recipe, we very much liked them.

I made these to go with dinner tonight, and they were very good. The dough was very wet. I had to pour it into the muffin cups, but they cooked up very nicely/ The only issue I had with them was that they were a little bland. Next time I will probably add something extra for kick. Thanks for the great recipe.

Cannot mess this up! If I can do this, despite all the disappointing blocks of bread and biscuit  and roll rocks that have come out of my kitchen, then any body that can read and follow directions can too. I am done buying store bought rolls. Came out just wonderfully and I am so pleased. Thank you DCASH30526 for sharing this easy to follow recipe.

VERY sticky dough... not the kind you can roll out but have to spoon into tins or onto a baking sheet. Mine came out quite dense and a little gummy. I will not be making this recipe again as there are so  many better bread roll recipes out there.

My roll recipe search has come to an end.  My family enjoyed these very much.  I followed the original recipe except I formed the dough into 8 balls and baked them on a baking stone instead.  Five star recipe for sure. =)

Followed the recpe but they turned out weird.  The dough was very runny. I made 10 rolls but I could have easily gotten 12 as soon were spilling over the muffin tin tops.  The rolls had a thicker crust on them, almost the consistency of a cornbread crust and the inside of the roll was almost like a sponge cake.  They were light but not anything like I expected and I won't make again.  The search goes on for a good yeast roll.

I made this recipe today and it came out wonderful. I did add a bit of butter to the recipe and they tasted great! If you follow all the directions here you will have a great roll. I have been cooking for years so the adjustment that I made was easy for me.

I wish there were more stars to give these rolls!!! I just got them out of the oven and they are fantastic!! I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I made was to cook them for 9 minutes instead of 10 because I used a dark pan. My only worry is trying not to eat them all tonight.

These rolls were very easy. I used a KitchenAid mixer to do all the work.  The dough was very sticky, though I just used a spoon to portion it into the muffin pan. I thought they were a little yeasty tasting, but with how easy they were to make I didn't mind.

I followed the recipe exactly, even proofing my yeast mixture. The reviews are correct when saying this dough is really sticky, so don't plan on trying to roll into a ball and making rolls in a cake pan- it's not possible with this dough. I tried dropping spoonfuls into the greased cake pan and the dough ran together. For me, it was disappointing. It sounds like this recipe works very well if baked in a muffin tin, but I doubt I will try this recipe again only due to  being limited on how to bake it.

I made these according to the recipe and they turned out great! Very soft with a sweet taste. I'll definately make these again.

These were great! The only thing I didnt like was how sticky the dough was. It made them really hard to work with. I did not add more flour like others did, I made this recipe as written. I think that is important to the wonderful texture of these rolls.

I tried this recipe one night after I realized I didn't have any prepackages roll dough...and I will never use prepackaged roll/bread dough again! These are sooooo easy to make and my family LOVES them. I now make them 2-3 nights a week.

I love how easy this recipe is if you follow it. No kneading, just mix,let rise, place in greased muffin tins, let rise again and bake! It is ok if the dough is sticky, once baked it is tender and moist, perfect!

Really great recipe. The dough was very sticky but I trusted the previous reviewers and didn't add more flour. Will definitely make these again, but I might try substituting butter for the shortening.

I did not like these at all.  The dough is WAY too sticky to deal with.  I had to spoon them into the muffin tins.  They were not light and fluffy the way you'd expect yeast rolls to be.  They tasted like they were missing something....still can't figure out what.  I will not be making them again!

Mines were heavenly!!! I tried to make some before but the down fall was some Dead Yeast. I got discouraged but I tried this recipe and the family loved it. They were a little sweet because I added raw sugar to it for my husband diabetes (easily digested) and I added cloves, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon and it mixed it with the raw sugar and the kids ate it for breakfast and I almost ate the whole loaf

Oh. My. GOSH! These rolls were amazing!!!! SO easy too! A trick I used was rapid rise yeast (was in a pinch to make dinner) and they were ready to go in 30 minutes start-to-finish. Delicious. Hubby loved them! Will be making these for Thanksgiving for sure. Thanks for such a great recipe!

These were very quick to mix up, rose beautifully, and look a lot harder than they are. I substituted 3T of honey for the sugar.  I used the bowl of my Kitchenaid to make the hot water mixture, then used the mixing blade to stir in the flour and develop some of the gluten in the dough.  I just used a spoon to plop the dough into a muffin tin - made 12 rolls for me that way. I guess I was expecting a slightly finer crumb, more like a Parker house roll, but that might have been due to the honey and of course, these rolls are WAY easier than Parker house rolls.  All in all, great recipe!

This recipe reminds me of spoon rolls. No where did it say knead it and roll into balls. The recipe was great as written. Too easy and my family loves them.

I admit, if I hadn't read the reviews first, I wouldn't have thought these would ever amount to anything.  But sure enough, they were as good as everyone said.  

I made only three minor adjustments.  1.) I don't like my rolls sweet, so I cut the sugar to 2 tablespoons  2.) since I use bulk yeast instead of packets, I used only two teaspoons and that was plenty, and 3.) my muffin pan had only 6 places so I didn't bother with the muffin pan.  Instead, I dipped my spoon into flour then scooped a spoonful of dough, rolled the spoonful of dough in flour and then placed the ball in a 9 inch pie pan. This worked great - just like pull-apart rolls.  Other than having to cook them an extra 3 minutes, everything else was the same as the recipe and they were delicious.

Made these for the first time following the recipe exactly.  Like others said, they were sticky and a little hard to get into the pan, but they turned out very nice.  I might add a little more sugar next time, but I tend to like things sweeter than most.  Overall, very good!

I love, love this recipe!  It's easy and the rolls come out very moist and dense which I love.  The batter is very loose, so it's best to spoon the batter into the muffin pan instead of trying to form balls.  I can't wait to make these rolls for my mother.

99This is a BATTER DOUGH, it is  a loose dough about the consistency pancake batter. So adding more flour is only going to result in a tough bread. Follow the amounts and you will end up with airy light rolls.

I have been looking for a good yeas roll recipe for ages.  This is perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was so easy.  I will definitely make these for company.  The only thing I would do different  change the 1 tsp of salt to 1/2 teaspoon, but I would actually try it before recommending it.  They were just a bit salty, but delicious, soft and the best I personally have ever made.

These rolls are so easy! followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I did different was I brushed them with butter before I put them in the oven and again after they cooked for 5 minutes. Brush them again after you take them out of the oven and before serving. These rolls are light, fluffy and perfect for Sunday lunch. Thank you so much for the best yeast rolls recipe!

Good, fast yeast rolls.  Sticky dough was not a problem, i just plopped down chunks next to each other on a 9x13 pan and let them rise.  Used whole wheat flour in place of all purpose.

I was looking for a good thanksgiving roll recipe. These were a bit odd (the dough was very sticky), but I like that you don't have to roll or knead them at all. Mine turned out just like the picture and are very good, perfect for thanksgiving! Thanks!!

very good as is. I made it sticky and came out good, just used a spoon w/flour on it to scoop out the dough as someone suggested. It was a little bit plain tasting though might try honey next time.

Made them exactly as stated. Scooped the batter into the muffin tins with a big spoon. The dough is a lot like muffin batter so don't expect dinner roll bread dough. Don't add more flour! I got two dozen medium sized rolls from this recipe. Everyone loved them! Thank you so much! I might try them with grated cheddar and Jalapinos next.

So simple and SOOO good!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY --wouldn't change a thing!  It was very sticky and you can not form balls with this.  Just spoon it directly into the muffin tins.  My batch made 12.  The smell of these rolls in the oven dragged my 10 year old daughter away from her video games to come see what smelled so awesome!   There were no leftovers.  We will be having these with Thanksgiving dinner this year!  Thanks for sharing.

Perfect - they come out golden brown, with crispy sides and only the slightest hint of sweetness.  Plus, no kneading!!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!! I followed another reviewers recommendation to NOT CHANGE THE RECIPE against the advice of other reviewers. I would not change a thing! The dough is a little wet but it makes the rolls soooo fluffy.

These are outstanding!  I've never been able to make consistent yeast rolls until now.  I doubled the recipe exactly---did NOT add extra flour.  The doubled recipe made 2 dozen rolls!  Yes, the dough is sticky, but all you have to do is take a spoon and drop it into the muffin cups.  They come out nice and light---adding extra flour would make them heavy in my opinion!  Great recipe---thanks for sharing!

First time I ever made yeast rolls, so I am not sure what they are supposed to be like.  These tasted very good, although the texture was a bit rough. I subbed butter for shortening but otherwise followed recipe.

So quick & so easy!! I have made these rolls twice. The first time, I added extra flour because the dough was so sticky. They were good. The second time I used the suggested amount of flour & spooned the dough into the muffin pan. They turned out amazing!! The were light & fluffy. My family could not quit eating them!!

So very easy yet soooo delicious.  I can't believe how good these are for how simple they are to make.  Yes, the dough is sticky.  It's supposed to be.  Don't try to knead it!  I used two spoons to scrape the dough into the muffin tins.  No problem!

I have a hard time understanding why some raters keep going on about the dough being too sticky to knead or make into balls, etc. As the directions indicate, you are not supposed to knead..just get in the muffin tins. I used a cookie scoop with no problems...dough didn't stick to the scoop, no mess, no fuss!  That probably should have been stated in the recipe to alleviate any confusion. We thought the rolls were pretty good for what they were...quick and easy! Thanks for the recipe, and thx to the other reviewers for the good suggestions.

OMG! These are the best rolls ever and the fact that they came out perfectly just makes it sweeter!  Because the dough/batter is so difficult to work with I opted not to use muffin tins,so instead I dropped spoonfuls,(about 24 even sections) onto a square baking dish and let them rise a second time, and then put them in the preheated oven,(I dropped the temp down to 415 because the first time they browned a little too quickly) and I left them in for about 4 minutes longer to insure even baking. My family begs me to make these now,it helps to use a pastry scraper and also to turn the dough out on a well floured surface too, that way your in a little more control of the floppy dough,btw the first batch I used white sugar, and the second I used an equal amount of honey instead for when you proof the yeast,both are good but the honey is better. MMMmmmm good!

These rolls turned out so light and lovely! I added about 1/4 cup more flour and they are perfect! 
This has become my regular recipe as they always turn out!

These were really good and easy.  Make the recipe as written--this is a batter roll and as such the dough is very soft.  You get a completely different product by adding more flour.

These were fine, but not the type of recipe I'd give to friends if they wanted a good roll recipe. They were bland. They also weren't particularly quick, but they were very easy -- maybe a good recipe to start out with if you haven't done much bread making. As far as the quickness is concerned, kneading doesn't add that much time and these do still have to rise twice. They take about 35 min of rising time with fast-rise yeast. I would prefer to take an extra 5 to 10 minutes and have superior flavor.

This was my first attempt at any sort of dough that required yeast.  I think they turned out wonderfull.  I didnt feel that I needed that much extra flour, unless you count the flour that was needed to coat my hands and my prep surface while I was kneading the dough.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written.  The dough is indeed super sticky, but you are just mixing it with a spoon, so that's fine.  These were super easy and they are the lightest yeast rolls I have ever made.  They are heavenly!  And, they were a huge hit with everyone who tried them.  I will make these again and again.

Quick and easy dinner rolls. Dough was a bit sticky so I would use a little less water or a little more flour.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made these to go with spaghetti tonight and was so very pleasantly surprised!  They were light and delicious..and very easy to do. I love it that you don't have to knead the dough! Next time I make them to go with an Italian style dish, I'll add some garlic butter on top before placing in the oven.

This was the first yeast roll that I ever made and it was fabulous! My husband, who is very picky, loved these rolls.  I did not change a thing.  I will say for us "novice" bakers, the 2 tablespoons of shortening means 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil!  I really did not know this at first!  This is a quick, easy delicious roll and will be going in my recipe binder!  The dough is sticky but if you use an ice cream scoop to get it out, it works perfectly.  I made 9 large delicious rolls! YUMMY!

This was my first time making yeast rolls and I'm impressed at how easy and fool proof it was! I followed the recipe word for word. The dough was sticky, but I coated my hands with non-stick spray in order to fill the muffin tins. They were delicious! I was expecting them to be a bit more dense, but they turned out light and fluffy.

Great recipe.  I've made these 3 times. The proportions are spot on.  This is a no knead batter recipe so the dough is going to be sticky and thin. As a rule of thumb any recipe that calls for a muffin pan is going to be for batter so everything was as expected.  Simply scoop the batter from the mixing bowl and rake into the muffin pan with well floured fingers.  The first time I went right by the recipe and had 8 really large rolls.  Nice, but a bit bigger than I preferred so the next time I made 12 rolls and the size was just right.  The third time I used oil instead of shortening and the consistency was even better.  Just remember to grease your muffin pan well on the top of the pan as well as down in the cups because as the dough rises it will expand across the top of the muffin pan and stick to it if the top is not greased.  This is the least labor intensive roll recipe I've ever used.  Aside from the rising time it really takes very little time or effort to make.

I just finished making these and they are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written and agree with those that say NOT to add more flour. After the first rising, yes, the dough is sticky, but I just use a cookie scoop to get it out of the bowl.  I had enough to make 12 rolls.  They came out light and fluffy!

There's no such thing as "quick yeast" rolls.  It's worth the time and trouble to make yeast rolls from a starter.  I followed the recipe as written and had no problem but they didn't have the yeasty taste I like.

This was a FANTASTIC recipe....definately a "keeper". I was a little worried about the sticky dough. I just continued with the recipe as instructed and made no variations. The rolls came out perfectly. Next time I'm going to experiment with wheat flour and honey.

I've made these a few times, and the first couple of times was tricky to handle the dough.  BUT...hubby likes them so much that it's worth it, and the time makes it a breeze!  Thanks!

Super easy and dairy free! I was able to easily double the recipe, and I baked them in a 9x13 pan as another reviewer suggested. I think I will try them in the muffin tins next time. They tasted great though! My kids gobbled them up!

This is probably about the best you can get with a quick roll recipe. I made the recipe with bread flour.  I also used rapid rise yeast and the hot water easy mix method.  I butter my bread when eating it, so there was no sense in substituting butter in the recipe, which would have also added to the water. Total time was about 1 hour from start to finish.  I used an ice cream scoop to measure into 8 muffin pans and wiped the bowl with paper towels.  No real mess.  The 8 standard muffin cups were slighly rounded full, then over an inch more after rising again.  I smoothed the tops a bit with wet fingers before the 2nd rise. For shine and color, I brushed the tops before baking with one egg yolk beaten with 1 tbsp water after the 2nd rise.  Used the knife test as suggested and had to bake for 12 minutes total.  The bread had risen another inch in the oven.  Concerning flavor, there is no way a quick yeast bread recipe like this is going to have a lot of flavor without adding or changing ingredents.  One possibility would be to use beer instead of some or all of the water.  You can use about 1 tbsp cider vinegar (remove 1 tbsp water).  You could start the yeast, one half of the water, salt, and flour several hours ahead or overnight then add the rest of the ingredients and start the first rise.  This would develop a more intense yeast flavor.

Very good. To me this was a cross between rolls and popovers. The center was like rolls and the outside like a popover. My dough was pretty moist, not sure if thats why, but it was yummy anyway! Wasn't sure if I should have covered during the first rise time; I did and it worked well. Great flavor!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I have made bread before and the consistency wasn't right so I kept adding flour until it pulled away from the bowl. Maybe 1 more cup. With that this recipe is 5 stars all the way. Great white bread for sandwiches when made into a loaf! Thanks for sharing your heirloom recipe!

I just made these rolls for dinner, following the recipe exactly as written. I did make 10 rolls as my muffin tins were really full with only 8. I think 12 would be a better number. The dough was a little on the sticky side, but I used a silicone spatula to transfer it to the muffin pan and that worked well. They were golden brown, soft inside and had a really nice flavor.  The next time I make these, I may use butter, but the shortening was fine. I WILL make them again! Quick and easy recipe.

I tried this recipe b/c I need a quick bread 4 dinner.  I was pleasantly surprised, really easy,tasty,& cheap to make.  It made 12 good sized light rolls, that were good, even the next day.  Only change I made was to use 1/4 cup of wheat flour. Like many others, I believe the key to these rolls are in the rising. I'll be making these again & again. Thanx for another great recipe fm this site.

I didn't like this recipe at all, nor did my husband. I also followed the recipe exactly as written!  To me it didn't taste anything like a yeast roll.  I make homemade rolls all the time and love trying out new recipes. I won't be using this one again.  It tasted more as a bland muffin.  If you want a muffin, get a good corn muffin recipe and if you want a yeast roll recipe, look elsewhere...

Awesome recipe! I substituted EVOO for the shortening and reduced the sugar slightly. The result was a super fluffy, spongy, yeasty dinner roll. This recipe is a keeper for me.

CAREFUL! This is a wet, sticky, gloppy dough. It's not a dry, pliable dough that you can handle. Don't add flour. Treat it like muffin batter that requires rising and you won't be disappointed.

These were great.  I am used to working with slack doughs so that part was no issue.  I did substitute honey for the sugar.  I first made them as pull apart rolls in a springform pan, they didn't last 10 minutes they were so good.  The second time, I changed the dough.  I added about a teaspoon more of honey, vanilla and almond extract to the batter.  I baked it into a loaf.  It was great the next morning for breakfast, just added a little honey for a final touch.

I made these last night to go with our roast. True, the texture is different, sort of a light, spongy inside, but truly, I must say as a "roll" lover, these are lovely. My picky family loved them, the taste and texture, and the next day they are just as good. 

To preclude the "sticky situation" in getting them into the muffin tins, spray a metal spoon lavishly with Pam. It helps a lot. 

I only added  1/4 cup extra flour to this, and they were perfect. I also did 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat, with a bit more of the white. I also replaced the shortening with melted butter. I highly recommend this, as butter is both more healthy, natural and tasty!

This was the easiest recipe and everyone loved the rolls.  It was nice to have them ready in such a short period of time.

These looked like muffins, had the texture of muffins, but NO FLAVOR.  Total dissapointment and I'm easily pleased.  If you think these are going to turn out like Texas Roadhouse or Logans, think again. LITERALLY they are like unflavored MUFFINS.

I thought these rolls were great. They were so quick and easy I could not believe I was making yeast rolls. I did add about 2 Tablespoons of extra flour, but that's expected in making yeast bread. The flavor and texture of these rolls were like rolls you would get in a restaurant. I will be making these rolls again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

The first time I made these, I thought there wasn't going to be enough flour, so I altered the recipe and added more. They turned out good. I just made them again and exactly followed the recipe. They were so delicious and fluffy. This recipe doesn't need to be altered.

Don't add extra flour!

These are very dense but good; add a little sugar or honey to get a steakhouse sweet yeast bread taste.

I will give this recipe props for being quick.  My rolls turned out too salty and a little dense, but I think the density was because I was pressed for time and didn't give them a proper second rise.  Still, WAY too salty.

Excellent rolls. Very easy to make, they rose quickly and were ready in about 2 hours.  My husband loved the slightly sweet taste.  I will definately make these again.

These rolls are just "plain". I wouldn't make them for a special occasion. Mine weren't as smooth as the ones in the photo. I think if I made them again I would increase the flour AND the sweetener (sugar, or maybe honey like another reviewer suggested). 
I actually did eat some with honey on top as an after-dinner snack.

I was sooo worried because these rolls looked too runny and they weren't rising very well.  I added a little bit more flour, gave them time and they turned out marvelous!  I would definatly recommend them to anyone, much better than the canned variety.

We were hoping for the kind of yeast rolls you get when you go out to dinner, that melt in your mouth...these were not even close. If you had named them quick rolls, I may have given it a higher rating, these are nothing more than dry dinner rolls. Sorry.

I tried this recipe out yesterday to check it out and 'practice' for Thanksgiving dinner...and we gobbled the rolls up!  They are very good.  After reading the reviews, I was expecting the dough to be sticky, and it definitely was...I didn't want to dry them out by adding too much flour, so I just spooned them into the muffin pan.  I do think I let mine rise a bit too long, because they were very large and not as pretty as the picture.  But the taste was good, for sure!  I made a batch again today and also another pan made substituting wheat flour and they both turned out great...made another this evening to take to my Mom's for T-giving tomorrow.  I guess you could say I'd recommend this recipe  ;o)  Very easy!

Perfectly perfect. No changes at all. I am a novice bread maker and these are my first yeast rolls. I followed the recipe exactly and they are AMAZING. They got rave reviews from my hubby who isn't easily impressed. Luckily they are super easy to make - practically foolproof! - because it looks like I will be making them often. I can't tell you how well they hold up the next day because I was so impressed that I had to come write this review asap. But even if they taste terrible tomorrow I still give this recipe a 5 star for how great they are right out of the oven. Thanks!

This recipie was (is great).  The only thing I did differently, was to mix everything in my bread machine-- I followed the recipie's instructions though, not the ones for the order of my machine.  When it got to its proof stage, I turned it off and let the dough double, then just pinched off enough to fill greased muffin tins and baked.  My husband loved them-- he even ate some for breakfast the next morning!

My kids have been begging for homemade yeast rolls, but there was never time after work and before dinner. Till now. The recipe made 12 for us in muffin tins. The kids wolfed them down. Not as good as our favorite Memphis rolls, but they take all day long. This is a great recipe. Thanks  a lot.

Splendid recipe. For those whiners  that throw shade because the dough is a little sticky ....amateurs. Obvious  they've  never made brioche. Rookies I  say. 
After first rise, divided into nine balls, placed in 9x9 square for second rise. I sprinkled with course sea salt just before baking.
Outstanding

I tried this recipe using whole wheat flour. They came out pretty dense because of it. Afterwards, I looked up how to substitute whole wheat flour for apf, and I found that I needed to add less flour and more sugar. I'll try this recipe again soon and update my rating. Great instructions for a newbie!

The buns are very easy and tasty. The dough is sticky, hence I used a spoon to scoop them into muffin tin. They rise beautifully! Since we don't like sweets much, I cut on sugar to 1 tbs, next time I'll try it with brown sugar. I had to lower the temperature to 190'C and bake them for 15 minutes otherwise they would be baked on outside but raw inside. We will bake them soon again!

I used butter instead of shortening. Also used about 3-3.25 cups flour in mixer. Used this for family recipe fried bread. Turned out super yummy.

I will use this again.

I don't know that I have ever had fresh made bread right out of the oven before but these were very good! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great (my dough was easy to work with, not nearly as sticky as it is in the video). I let the yeast dissolve for 10 minutes then let the dough rise 30 minutes each time, as others recommended. I also covered the dough with damp paper towels while it rose. I separated the dough into 16 balls and put 2 balls into each muffin compartment so they were easy to pull apart and butter up!. I will definitely make them again.

It was sticky when you first make it into a dough. but you have to work with it, stay with the recipe it was really easy too make. yes it takes time, but worth it and you don’t have to use a cupcake pan if you don’t want to.

I took the advise of some of the most positive critiques and avoided the temptation to alter the recipe with things like adding more flour, kneading or treating it like more traditional bread making. I followed the recipe exactly and boy did it pay off.  These are surprizingly easy and very tasty.  I will add more salt next time, but that's just a preference thing.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.  I will make them again.
I see it over and over again on various recipes and I do not understand how people can rate a recipe if they have made modifications to said recipe.  If modifications are made they are not rating the original recipe they are rating their own recipe.

This recipe was good though I did alter it. I used butter and honey. Not big alterations but ones to mention. I also needed them and rolled into balls. They tasted great had a good texture and were moist. They could have handled more sugar, but the sugar in the recipe is more food for the yeast than to sweeten the taste.

I too followed the directions and with the tip of kind of gooey dough these were fantastic. Left the dough in the mix bowl, yes it was gooey, let it rise. Spooned into a cupcake pan. Still a little  gooey. Let them rise again. Baked and enjoyed. I have never made a better roll!

What a great recipe!  Easy to follow, very forgiving, and quick to complete with excellent results.  I was afraid I had over-worked the dough with my stand mixer, then I let the dough rise too much on the first proofing.  Even with these "mess ups" the rolls still turned out fantastic.  They rose perfectly, were soft and light with a beautifully consistent crumb on the inside and had a golden brown smooth textured crust.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with 28 good sized rolls.  These will be great toasted in the morning!

After reading the reviews I followed the instructions exactly as written.  I would describe the dough as gloppy, which after making other types of dough that require kneading, was a bit foreign. But I trusted the process and they were great.  The recipe says 8 rolls but I think you could make 10 or 12 smaller rolls.  I brushed the warm rolls with a bit of butter as they came out of the oven.

Seriously one of the best roll recipes I’ve made and it was super easy. I’ve read other reviews that say it needs more flour and that is just not necessary.  I’ve made it to the recipe specifications many times and it has always come out perfectly airy.

I live and bake in the Desert. Maybe depends where you live, and environmental conditions. The dough was way too loose, and when it rose the second time in the muffin tins, just oozed over the sides.  I was bummed.

This made a delicious batch of super fluffy dinner rolls. Great recipe. I will probably cut the amount of sugar I half for the next batch though as these were just a tad too sweet for my tastes. But overall simple to make, soft and delicious.

I give this a 10 star rating. I made a test run before Thanksgiving with in 10 minutes they were all gone. So I made more for Thanksgiving and all the family that came over devoured all but 6 (six) of them and I made 4 dozen. They didn't even touch the store bought rolls. They are asking me to make even more. I have my work cut out of me now. Thanks for a great recipe.

It makes a nice, simple roll.  Not too sweet and not too dense.   When I first took these rolls out of the oven,  they were still a little doughy in the center,  so I had to put them back in the oven for 5 minutes or so.  The result was crusty outside and a soft inside. 
I also used quick rise yeast.  Note,  if you are having difficulty getting the dough to rise,  place the bowl or pan in a larger container with warm water, 120 to 130 degrees.  The temperature is important.  I had to do so with both the mixing bowls and the muffin tin with a half sheet pan with this recipe.

I had always been intimidated by trying to bake anything with yeast. Letting it rise etc. without having an exact time frame for it all. But while I was baking my pies, I thought I would give it a try.  And... they turned out great! I did not change the recipe and I will be making them again!!! I pulled the dough apart into balls and put them into a round greased cake pan. They still came out huge, and so next time I will just make the balls a bit smaller and use two cake pans to bake them in.

Great taste! Even though I skipped the second raise (husband came home early and wanted dinner sooner) they still were fluffy and yummy.

So so yummy!! I followed recipe exactly except for I used honey instead of sugar and butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any sugar or shortening.

These were super easy to make and tasted great! Didn't change a thing. Just be aware than it is a gooey dough that you don't handle by hand. Scoop it with a spoon. Trust the recipe!

I guess this recipe may yield results that impress a beginner, but as an avid baker I found nothing remarkable about this recipe.  I decided to try something new and regretted it when it came time to serve dinner.

Update: I've been experimenting, and tried these with 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1.25 cups bread flour and they great, with a slightly more cakey crumb. Definitely recommend with some cinnamon honey butter!

These were wonderful. I actually found that this recipe made more than 8 servings, as the recipe says. 

The only reason I can't give this recipe 5 stars is because it is so poorly written. If your recipe is unconventional, as this one DEFINITELY is, you should be noting things in your recipe (like the consistency of the dough). Most of the poor reviews and people changing the recipe here are coming from the fact that these are in no way a normal yeast dinner roll, and that's making people furious. 

Now, I know the purists will have kittens, but I chose to use bread flour because I wanted the extra gluten development, and these were perfect. The first rise only needed 40 minutes, and the 2nd rise almost wasn't necessary, because by time I had filled the muffin tins the dough was already blooming massively. So in my experience this recipe went a lot faster than 1h 40m.

I brushed mine with butter as soon as the tops had set, and gave them a light egg wash just a few minutes before completion for color development. The entire family raved about these rolls, and we can't wait to make them again! The texture and taste were awesome and this is definitely getting saved.

This was a simple bread to make. I love it and my family gobbled it up. Next time I’ll add a little shredded cheese garlic and sesame seeds to the top before baking.  Great yeast rolls.

These are so fast and easy, and they taste great! My family asks for these regularly. A little different than a traditional roll, so it’s a nice change up.  Just follow the recipe, don’t add more flour than called for. Yes, the dough is goopy and wet, and no, you can’t roll this into balls. I double the recipe and fill 18 spots in muffin pans. You can substitute butter for the shortening.

Really good flavor and easy to make.  I’ve made them a few times.  I am tweeting the amount of water because I’ve had to add extra flour to get the dough to pull together.  I’ll keep making them because the family loves them!

I made these according to the recipe except I used butter because I didn’t have shortening.  The dough is VERY sticky, but I scooped each roll out with a floured spoon and put them in a round pan.  These were amazing.  Very light and fluffy and large.  I may make them into 12 smaller rolls next time.  I will definitely be making them again.

I have made these dozens of times. They are highly requested by the family and always a hit! I usually swap out the shortening for butter (same amount) and brush the rolls with butter before baking. They always turn out great. The batter is a little gloppy and hard to work with but dont add more flour, i promise they will be great!

Followed the recipe exactly, used bacon grease as the shortening. Except for dealing with extremely sticky dough, it was easy. The rolls came out light, fluffy, slightly sweet and delicious.

Made the dough as the recipe directed.  Easy and fun to make with great results.  I weighed out 2 oz. of dough and made 11 smaller rolls.  Would be great for a first time baked not having to use any unusual flours or gadgets.  Plain and simple and delicious results and rolls.

Excellent.  I wanted an easy bread that didn't create much mess.  This recipe is exactly that delicious and made entirely in one bowl, no kneading so no flour covered hands or countertops.  I was surprised how soft these rolls were, too.

I really like the way the rolls came out, although I may add a minute or two to make them a little darker. They are fluffy and light.  This is the first time I have made any type of bread. I may also try a different pan as some people mentioned in the comments for a different shape..

Simple and delicious. The rolls end up light and flavorful. Just follow the recipe, don't add more flour or anything. It should be wet and sticky when you plop it into the muffin tin.

These were quick, easy and a big hit with the family.

I only made six from this batch because I have a large muffin pan, not the standard, just  cooked them a little longer and they were great.

Delicious rolls! I followed the recipe with no changes. Let the dough rise in the bowl 40 minutes, then 20 minutes in the tins. Light and fluffy. Thank you!@

These were awesome!
My Mom said last year, "somebody in this family needs to learn how to make some fresh rolls!".
I took that as a hint, and I'm so glad I found your recipe!
I followed the recipe exactly :o)

I added sharp white cheddar and garlic powder to mine. Also, I make balls and dip the dough in a mug of butter before placing it in a 9 inch round pan. That way they just fall apart from each other and are easy to pick up and eat. This way you can make smaller rolls to feed more people. There are never left overs!

Great rolls, family loved them. I only ride them because they are faster than average. I’ve made a lot of bread, so my family knows what good homemade rolls are supposed to be. They really enjoyed them. Make them as directed. No need to change anything, and they come out perfect.

Quick and super easy. Great recipe. I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit. I am making another batch now. On the 2nd batch, I added a little honey. We will see how those turn out. 
These are simply delicious.

So easy! I followed the recipe all  except I used 2 1/2 cup flour. I cut the dough in 12 pieces right from the bowl..got 12 perfect rolls...they do not look like muffins. I under baked them slightly so I can heat them back up at my moms today!

Made these using all whole wheat flour.
With the whole wheat I knew they would take a bit longer to rise. I put the bowl in the oven with the light on as I always do when making bread.
After reading some reviews I did what one suggested, and that was to use a ice cream scoop to fill the muffin tin.They took about 18 minutes to bake but that is because of the whole wheat flour.
I got 6 good sized rolls,  and we enjoyed them.

These were easy and very tasty and I will make them again..

I made this recipe last night to go with dinner and my family absolutely loved it! These taste just like I had hoped and were easy to make. I didnt have shortening on hand so I substituted equal parts butter and it worked just fine. Definitely adding this one to my regular recipes!

The rolls came out great. The only change I made was sifting the flour prior to measuring it. The batter is supposed to be sticky, but I had no issues getting it into the muffin tin. (I used an ice cream scoop, you should not be using your hands!).

When I think of yeast rolls this is not how I imagine them.  The recipe does have potential, but it’s not out of this world.   If you insist on making these coat your hands in butter or non stick spray to handle the dough when putting in the pan.   The smell was there. The flavor was okay, but the texture was not that of yeast rolls I’ve had before.

It worked better for me to just simply let it rise an hour, and then knead for 5 minutes rotating. Also I added 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter in at the end of the mixing process cut into small pieces. It made it super fluffy.

Very quick and simple for a yeast bread.  I dumped everything in the mixer and let it go.  I spooned into 12 muffin cups and was very pleased.  I may used quick yeast next time to speed it up even more.

Perfect homemade roll recipe! I used quick rise yeast which cuts down on time. I let them rise in the muffin tin then bake them off and they are perfect every time. I also prefer 12 individual sized rolls instead of 8 giant rolls.

Baking is not my strong suit. I love baking I’m just not good at using a recipe.  I almost made that mistake when I was making these rolls with my son. It was him reminding me what I’ve preached to him about. “Baking is Chemistry” follow the recipe and you’ll have great easy and fast rolls. Let your kid follow the recipe and they will have a memory for a lifetime.

I altered it slightly and used butter and honey instead of shortening and sugar. The first time I added more flour they were ok. The second time I followed exactly except for my honey and butter they turned out amazing.  Give them plenty of rise time and they are light and fluffy.

I am planning on making it for my county fair this year, the only thing I needed to do personally (because the fair makes me do it) I needed to add some more flour because I need to make different  shapes out of it otherwise it was really good! and I would for sure make it again!

First time ever making yeast rolls! How rewarding, followed the recipe and used an ice cream scoop to fill cupcake tin.  Needless to say my tin runneth over with mammoth rolls.

I decided to make this because it was so easy. And being gluten intolerant i missed eating rolls or biscuits. So i made a couple of changes.i had no shortening so instead i used coconut oil plus 2 tab of butter. And for the flour bobs red mill gluten free flour 1 to 1. It was great. A little dense but having to use the gf flour this was s not unexpected. They came out like a biscuit. Also made it in a cake pan for a pull apart. But for anyone wanting a gf yeast roll or biscuit this is the one to try. I might try next time to use a little bit of extra xanthum gum it might give it a lighter density. Even if i dont this is one ill be making again (probably a lot)

These are AMAZING! (I did put a tiny bit more water in the dough) After they were baked I put some butter on top to brown them and then put some garlic and Italian seasoning and man did that make um'! They are sooooooo good, follow the recipe and you should get the right outcome.

I’m always on the hunt for good yeast dinner rolls, not much luck thus far until this recipe. Extremely easy to make. I ended up making 12. It may have been due to adding extra flour. I had a really sticky dough at first, didn’t know if that was the right consistency. So, I added the flour and kneaded it a bit before initial rise.

Yummy, light, and easy to make.  Tip...the dough is sticky, so I use Pam spray to coat my utensils  as I go.  Makes it much  easier to put into pan!

Super easy to make. I didn't have shortening so I subbed for butter, also divided into 12 portions and it turned out perfect. I'm glad I read through the comments first because it was really gooey and I would have wanted to add more flour but I resisted the urge. Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is fantastic!  Light and fluffy rolls are what you will get if you have a little patience.  Yes, the dough is sticky, but just use a cookie scoop to fill the muffin tin and you'll be fine.  Try this recipe...you will not be disappointed.

There are not enough superlatives for this recipe!  I followed it to the letter and the rolls were absolutely perfect.  Yes, the dough is sticky, but you don't shape the dough into individual portions; you grab a handful and put it into the muffin pan.  They rise beautifully.  

Straight from the oven, I brushed the tops with melted butter.  Dinner for four meant that each one of us got two.  I'm ready to make them again (except I may not share).  :-)

These rolls are awesome. Super quick and easy. The only thing I do extra is mix up some honey and butter to brush the rolls with as soon as they come out of the oven.

Yum. They were light, airy and delicious. Yes the dough was sticky but all you had to do was drop it by the spoonful in a muffin cup. No need to shape. It was very quick and easy.  I got 10 rolls from this recipe.  This will be my 'go to' dinner roll from now on.

Very tasty and fluffy. made ten, could've been 11 rolls. this dough is very sticky, but if you avoid working it, it turns out wonderfully. just get in there with both hands and learn how best to squeeze the dough off your fingers!

I made involuntary changes but they turned out very well and I'm ready to make them again.  I  used  a pan that makes mini meat loaves (rectangle).  I love bread, I haven't made rolls in a long time.  Thanks for sharing.
The didn't rise like I thought they should, but they were delicious and I'm ready to make and eat more.

This is my new go to for dinner rolls!  Thank you for sharing!
I made these on a snow day from school.  The recipe made 10 for me, in silicone muffin pans.  My 2 teenage boys ate 8.  They turned out fabulous :)  I greased an ice cream scoop to place in the pan, as suggested by another reviewer.  Great idea!

These came out amazing!! Fresh Hot dinner rolls with minimal effort. I made these for Christmas and followed the recipe to a T.  The dough is very sticky. Work with 2 spoons to add the dough to the muffin tin. Definitely worth making for your next holiday dinner. Thank you for a great recipe.

Finally a truly good, homemade yeast roll.  My new go-to recipe.  Thank you!!!

There are few things more disappointing to a cook/baker than putting in the money, ingredients, effort, and time on a recipe - only to have it not turn out.  This happened to me this Thanksgiving when I attempted a yeast roll recipe from the Food Network website (boooo!).

This recipe did not disappoint on any level.  Doubled in size in the bowl - check.  Doubled in size in the pan - check.  Good, bread-like texture - check.  Tasty - check.  Made the house smell good - check.  They were also incredibly easy to make - proving that our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents knew what they were doing.

Just keep in mind that the batter is supposed to be goopey.

These are terrific! Great texture and so easy. Sometimes trying to sneak in home made rolls on Thanksgiving doesn’t go so well. I only had the fast acting yeast so it only had to rise 1 time. It’s a very sticky dough. I used a medium size cookie scoop and put 3 balls in a muffin tin. They were quite large when I baked them. Yummy and so easy.

Followed the recipe exactly. Definitely a gloppy dough, it did rise incredibly fast and became a gloppy mess in the muffin tin. I scooped it back in, baked it and they came out good. They were done, easily came out of the muffin tin, but it was literally the taste and texture of white bread. Just wasn't a huge fan of them.

These were a hit!  I love “yeasty” rolls and these did not disappoint. The only change I made was to use 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1-1/4 cups of white flour. I will definitely make these again.

Excellent. As others have said, DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. The dough is very very sticky but it doesn't matter, just shove it in the muffin pan however you need to, it will turn out perfect. They are very light, fluffy rolls. Perfect for Thanksgiving.

Wonderful Recipe helpful to watch video and read comments. I did not have plastic wrap so I used a towel and give it time to rise. It will be a wonderful addition today for thanksgiving.

I didn't like them at all.  Too spongy  and more like a muffin than a roll.  Would have tasted great with frosting.

Made a double batch using instructions as stated. My family requests these rolls every family dinner we have!  Dough is very wet and you spoon it into muffin cups. I have also made in a large pan but comes out more proportionate in the muffin cups. Light, airy rolls. DELISH!

I cover them in plastic once placed in the muffin pan. The plastic stuck to to top of my dough.  However they baked relatively well. I would do this again and take more care not to cover in plastic or anything else once they’re in the muffin pan.

These rolls are amazing! I've been using this recipe for several months now and I can say, you really need to follow the recipe. I've tried changing it up a bit, but it never comes out as good. The only thing I do differently is, I put them on a baking sheet instead of in a muffin tin. I just didn't like the texture of them when baked in the muffin tin.

Easy and tasty! I scaled to 11 servings as 3 cups of flour is perfect for my bread machine. I used unsalted butter for shortening, skim milk for water, halved the sugar, reduced salt to 1/4 tsp as I am on a low sodium diet, put everything in the bread machine on dough cycle. I used a 1/4 cup scoop to divide dough into the 12 muffin cups, I baked at  375 for 18 minutes, brushed with butter when removed from oven. My son said these were pillows of perfection, don't fool around with flour and liquid amounts as it is supoosed to be loose to be scooped into the cups not shaped.

I have made these rolls many times and they are absolutely amazing for the effort! So easy and so good. The only thing I would say you should change is the amount. I always at least double it! Sometimes I add a tablespoon of garlic and half a cup of Parmesan cheese per batch to make Parmesan garlic rolls. If you try this add about 10 minutes to the cooking time.

I didn't have my muffin tin cause I lent it to a friend so I made muffin cups with aluminum foil. I watched the video cause I was a little unsure of how moist the dough was and since my dough matched the video I went with it. They were amazing! Covered them with butter after they came out and my dinner guests called me a "Food wizard" and asked for the recipe. I will be making these again!

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written and it was just ok. I didn't mind the dough consistency, it was sort of drippy but I was able to spoon it into the muffin tins with a large spoon, no problem. They looked great! Smelled great, but they didn't have much flavor. Maybe I will try again and use butter instead of shortening, also might add a bit more sugar.

I just made these, they are very good. Light and fluffy, I will make again but I will cut down on the sugar. I also had a problem with the sticky dough.I used to be the baker for the school where my children attended. I never had my rolls come out this sweet.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made EXACTLY the way it is written. The video was super helpful because it showed how gooey the dough would be. They were VERY EASY to make. My shortening was in the fridge, so I microwaved it in the water until it dissolved, then followed the recipe exactly. I will absolutely make these again, and again, and again.

Tastes great! Dough is sticky,  but don't add more flour.  I floured my hands when making the dough balls,  but that's all the extra flour I used.  I add a little meted butter to the tops of rolls before baking and again during and at the end,  maybe a quarter stick of butter all together.  Great easy recipe!

I have always been hesitant to work with yeast because I'm afraid whatever I make won't turn out right because of the multiple steps to let things rise. It just seems too complicated for me. I buy it hoping to get over my phobia but then it expires and I throw it away. This morning I found an expired jar so I looked up how to tell if yeast is still good. I proofed it, and it was still good. I looked up what to make with yeast and this recipe popped up. The word "quick" in the title appealed to me, so I thought I'd give it a try. For those who are afraid to work with yeast, this is a perfect starter recipe for you (us). I didn't change a thing. However, as a previous reviewer stated, I wish the recipe stated how long to wait to let it rise. I let it rise about 40 minutes. While waiting, I read several reviews. I'm glad I did because that way I wasn't surprised to see that the dough was sticky. That meant I was doing something right! I sprayed my muffin tins and scooped the dough into each one. I let them sit for another 30 minutes to rise again. I baked them for 13 minutes at 400°. They turned out perfectly and tasted delicious! There are no tweaks or changes necessary. They turned out fluffy and soft. Perfect!

I made these rolls for the first time this past Sunday without ANY changes.  They are absolutely scrumptious!  I was so proud of myself for having FINALLY made a homemade pan of rolls like my grandmother used to make!  My husband loved them too.  So grateful to the person who posted this recipe.  I baked mine in a 12 cup square brownie pan and they looked so good!  I had 2 rolls left over.  Took them to work the next day and had them for lunch.  What I did was put 1 slice of American cheese (folded in quarters to fit the roll) and a slice of deli buffalo chicken.  Put it in the microwave for 1 minute.  You talk about something delicious!!  It made a great lunch with a bag of potato chips and a seltzer water.    

Thanks again for a fabulous recipe.  It will be my "go to" for homemade rolls!

I made this recipe about a year ago and re-found this recipe and plan on making it again. They are soft and are so great warm with a little butter melted on top. They are a perfect addition to any meal or are great to just eat whenever (I'm definitely a bread girl haha).

I doubled the recipe and made the dough in my mixer. Dough was very sticky but trusted some of the other suggestions to "just follow the recipe". It made 24 nice sized dinner rolls. They stuck a bit in the muffin tin but turned out light and tasty!

I made these and had them on the table with dinner in an hour and 15 minutes, first try. I used a well greased round pan and dropped the batter by the spoonful  to make pull apart rolls. The dough  was sticky and wet, as described, but boy, were they good! These are going into regular rotation.

Excellent.  Just excellent.  Thank you so much for sharing this.   Note to others trying this for the first time:   Do not adjust portions - the dough is supposed to be a sticky mess!  Also, I recommend unsalted butter instead of shortening.   I find that dipping my fingers in water before putting the dough in the tins keeps it from sticking.    I make these at least once a week, and I recommend them very highly.

I made this unusual home-hack recipe as written;  it results in a light, spongy, yeasty bread cupcake.  It looks like many people liked the strange taste and texture, but I found it somewhat repulsive.   This is an unusual cake batter recipe that uses the wrong ingredients and no real method or skill.  On the good side, it is easy and fast, it doesn't require any baking technique or skills, just mix everything together and bake.  It results in a peculiar hybrid between a roll and a cupcake, which isn't necessarily bad, but I didn't like the results.   For instance, this recipe is a cake batter recipe that requires a liquid fat, but instead calls for shortening.  Shortening is hydrogenated vegetable oil that is solid at room temperature and melts at a temperature (>117F) that is above what is typically needed for a yeast-based dough.  So the first step is a perplexing 'mix with hot water and cool, then add yeast', so you resolidify your shortening, and you are left with something is neither a wet-ingredient-mixture or a dry-ingredient-mixture.  Since yeast are most active around 110F, using chemical leavening and/or vegetable oil (or other liquid fat) would be better, but as written, this recipe is incompatible.  You are better just skipping this recipe and learning  proper bread making techniques using a standard recipe and a standard method.

OMG these rolls were amazing. Me and my family had eaten them all before we could take pictures! I made them with a goat- cheese spread inside and Swiss melted on the outside, but the rolls themselves were heavenly. please check out my recipe for Chèvre and Swiss Cheese Rolls!

I admit that while making it the dough doesn't look like a standard dough, but I made no changes and they came out great! I used a regular spoon with some flour on it to get the dough into the muffin tins and if  you just round it at the top they came out very pretty!

I made only one change to this recipe by using 2 tbl. of unsalted butter instead of shortening.  I made it  using the dough cycle on my Breville bread machine, which includes rising.  I scooped out what I could onto a baking sheet and made several circles of dough, which quickly spread due to its wet consistency.  I sprayed olive oil onto a sheet of plastic wrap and covered them and let them rise  again in a warm place for 30 min.  When I saw the results after 30 min. my heart dropped - I had one huge rectangle of dough.  I decided to ditch the idea of rolls altogether and made it into a pizza.  The results were disappointing, flavor and texture-wise.  Too sweet and kind of spongy.  Will not make again.

Instead of adding shortening, I added two tablespoons of coconut oil. And since the dough was pretty sticky I made sure to oil my fingers and the tips of them, especially so that I could put them into balls of dough. I allowed the dough to rise for two hours. One hour after I finished making the dough and another hour after I rolled the dough into balls... They came out great!!!

I've made these rolls four times now and they are perfect each time. The recipe is strange if you are a traditional bread maker and the dough is gooey but have no fear just persevere and you will be rewarded. Trust me - I was skeptical too! Enjoy!!

Tasty, if a bit bland.  I found I could make a whole 12 and use all the cups of my muffin tin with no problem.  I think it's best to turn them around in the middle of baking in order to make sure they're of a more or less uniform colour (this varies from oven to oven, depending on heat distribution).  I also used butter, but no matter what fat you use, try and cut it (or divide it) into dime-sized pieces so it melts in the hot water.

I made no changes to this amazingly easy recipe.  The only yeast roll recipe that I have mastered on first try!  They are simply wonderful, light, fluffy and tasty.  This is the only recipe I will ever want to use for homemade dinner rolls....and the men in the house told me so.   Thank you so much for sharing!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  These rolls are easy, quick and delicious. I make them regularly! 
Don't let  the batter like consistency bother you.  I use a large cookie scoop to put the dough into my muffin pan.

For those of you adding extra flour because you think you need to work the dough, DON'T. It's supposed to be a wet dough. It'll still rise until doubled, then you spoon it into the muffin tins. I made 12 rolls instead of 8 in a regular sized muffin tin. Do let it rise the second time until nearly doubled, because it makes the rolls light and fluffy. They keep very well in a Zip-lock bag.

I used butter instead of shortening, cut the sugar down to 1 T. and put them in a 9" round pan which took a bit longer to bake. They  turned out awesome. So fluffy and tender. Yum :)

These were very good.  It is a dense roll.  Not a typical fluffy one with a crusty exterior.

These rolls turned out fabulously! I didn't have shortening, so I substituted butter and it turned out just fine. The dough rose more than I expected, and in my muffin tin it ended up making an even dozen. This is not a bread that's intended to be kneaded or shaped; I used a cupcake scoop to measure it out into the tin and it worked great. Looks, feels, and tastes exactly how I expected considering the moisture and fat content.

Followed recipe closely...best yeast rolls that I have ever baked.   So light, airy and flavorful.  This will be my only yeast bread recipe to recommend and to use!   At 69 yes of age...I have never mastered any recipe containing yeast.   THIS alone should speak volumes to most folks.   Thank you very much for sharing.     Looking to see more of your recipes.

Great also with vegan substitutions: 1 Tbsp of ground flax or chia seeds, soaked in 1/4 cup of warm water, and vegan Becel margarine (now available next to the "regular" Becel).  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and they turned out excellently.   I didn't add any more flour than the recipe.  Yes, the dough is sticky, so I used a big spoon to scoop it into silicone muffin cups.

Dough was stickey but I cut it into 8 pieces and put them into a greased  muffin pan. They looked ugly and misshapen but after rising and baking they turned out nice. The rolls were very moist  but had good flavor and texture. I will make these again.

Don't let the stickiness of the batter fool you - this is the way it is supposed to be. This recipe does not need to be kneaded! After letting it rise the first time, simply spoon the dough into the muffin tin.

I tried to make these.  I started late afternoon since there was no indication of how long it would take these to rise.  The dough rose in the bowl just fine.  I put it into 9 muffin cups and let it rise again but before I was ready to bake them, they rose and spilled out of the cups.  I baked them anyway (putting the muffin tins on a sheet pan) but they didn't rise anymore, they simply spilled over the muffin tins making a mess.  I tried a bite of  one roll and they tasted okay  but  I will not attempt this recipe again.  I did not to add any extra flour as indicated in some reviews but the rising was so uncertain that this turned out awful.

I made these earlier, and they are amazing!  I do believe these are the best dinner rolls I've ever had.  The dough is soft and sticky, so I used an ice cream scoop with a release handle to scoop the dough into the muffin tin.  This will be my dinner roll recipe from now on!

Fabulous recipe! I didn't change a thing. (I simply sprayed my hands with a light coating of grape seed oil and I easily scooped the dough out of the mixing bowl and into the pan).

Followed the recipe as is, except I added 1/4c of flour. Dough looked really wet and sticky. It didn't really rise. I put the dough in the cupcake tins and let it rise again. Still nothing. I ended up baking them. Turned out, solid cooked dough. Will be not making again.

I'm giving this a 5 star for taste, and because I believe the vast majority of reviews that say this comes out great--- but mine, while tasty, fell literally flat. I didn't get that rise out of it, though it was a crowd pleaser for my family diner with soup. I must have done something wrong with the yeast.... I'm still new at making my own bread, so I'm off to investigate how I went wrong here. Thanks for the recipe, I'll try it again!

These are amazing!! I was looking for an alternative to japanese milk bread, and these saved me an hour and a half of time. Follow the recipe exactly as it says, no you don't need to knead it. I let it rise for the 1st time for an hour ontop of my warm oven while baking cookies and then a 2nd time in the slightly cooled oven for 20-30 mins. I used an ice cream scoop and a silicone spatula to scoop it into the muffin tin, using the spatula to get the rest of it out of the scoop because it is a very goopy sticky dough. Mine didn't brown but i didnt put any kind of oil or egg wash on top and I don't have the best oven but they taste AMAZING!! This will definitely be my go-to dinner rolls from now on. So quick and easy!

Finally, a yeast roll recipe that is easy to make and great tasting. I have been looking for a go to roll recipe and this is it.  Don't be afraid of the dough looking wet-it rises fine. Will definitely make again.

Perfect as written!  Approx 1 1/2 hour for first rise. Approx 1 hour second rise. Shortening didn't melt in warm water, so I chopped it up a bit with the fork before adding dry ingredients. Consider using butter instead of shortening. Scooped (not balled) into 12 sprayed muffin tins. Baked 7 minutes. Could be baked as one pull apart bread. Family preferred individual rolls.  Update: second batch - used butter in place of shortening. Also excellent.

These were amazing! They are the fluffiest rolls I have EVER had. They were a little weird eating them right out of the oven. But after they cooled down they were delicious.  I did substitute the sugar for honey, but that's it. They are sticky, BUT FOLLOW THE RECIPE. they are supposed to be sticky, its a quick yeast roll. They are by far the best rolls I have EVER made.

Not bad!  Had to sub butter because  we didn't have shortening.  I wasnt a huge fan of using the muffin tin, muffin shaped bread rolls looked a little awkward to me.. but the rolls themselves made up for that in taste.

I made these tonight and loved them. After reading reviews and seeing how sticky the dough was, I scooped them into the greased cupcake pan with an ice cream scoop straight from the bowl. They are so soft and light!  I might make them with butter flavored shortening next time.

I followed the directions exactly as written and they turned out fabulous! They are really sticky but I kept going and they came out light, fluffy and delicious. My family has requested me to make them almost weekly. I brush some butter over the top before I bake them and it is perfection!

Thanks for sharing. A real hit with my family and relatives. I prefer butter instead of fat.

These rolls were delicious!!  Only thing was after 10 minutes the rolls didn't brown. Therefore, I will bake them at a higher temperature next time to achieve a warm brown finish to the tops??

Thank you for the awesome recipe. I used this recipe to make a loaf bread instead of the rolls. It is too good to put in words. My search for a plain bread recipe is finally over.

These were delicious! I substituted butter for the shortening because I didn't have it on hand, but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful! The dough is definitely sticky but resist the urge to add flour because they turn out perfect!

I made these exactly as written.  They were tasty, and would have been perfect, had I not made a mistake in the preparation.  I wanted to share my mistake with others, so it doesn't happen to anyone else.  I let them rise too long for the first rise.  I got called to work for a few hours at the last minute, right after I had set these aside for the first rise.  When I came home 3 hours later, yes, they were risen, so I thought everything was fine.  I punched them down, put them in the muffin tins, and let them rise a second time, for about 30 minutes.  But after I baked them, the texture was a little "off".  The insides were a little doughy, and the outside a little too crispy.  I think this is probably due to the over-rising.  We still ate them and enjoyed them!  But if I were to make these again, I would be certain to keep an eye on them during the first rise and not let it go too long.

I will make these rolls again. They exceeded my expectations.   
Full disclosure:  I accidentally added a second tsp of salt &  so added another egg plus another 1/4 cup of flour.   I also added about a tsp of thyme because at that point why not, right?  
The sticky sticky dough rose beautifully in the bowl & again the muffin tins and I baked them for a punt 12 minutes total at 425. Immediately out of the oven I spread butter once over the tops & garlic powder then repeated.  I let them cool then tested one with my family. They really liked them!  I love these rolls because no kneading!  Thank you!

I made it and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight.  I am going to try it  next without the egg, I think the egg makes it a little heavy.

I made these exactly as the recipe suggested and they came out perfect! The yeast just took a while to rise but that did not bother me. The only thing I did different was before I put the rolls in the oven, I brushed them with some honey butter. I was also able to get a good dozen decent sized rolls. I also used an ice cream scoop when putting the dough in the muffin tins. They are really good and fast! I will definitely be making these again!

Spectacular! Yes, it's a sticky batter, but stick to the recipe, use a spoon to transfer to muffin pan, let rise and cook accordingly and I promise you... you will not be disappointed. Very light, fluffy, yeasty and wonderful! Not to mention, no kneading necessary! This will be my go to recipe for yeast rolls from now on! So delicious!

I use this recipe almost weekly, and not just for buns! I let it rise twice much longer in the warmest place in my house, and match the amount of shortening with butter in addition for flavour. do not fear the sticky consistency!

These are the best!  They are not ones you have to knead - they are a bit sticky and looks like you might have messed something up, but just follow the recipe and bake.  They are soooooo good!

Easy to assemble but the dough must be given about one and a half hours to properly rise. Can easily provide enough dough for 12 rolls rather than 8

No shortening so used same amount of soften unsalted butter and reduce sugar to 2 tablespoon. Used 1 C regular AP flour and  1.25 C  MW AP flour (makes softer flour products-- pound cakes turn out awesome). Followed directions and mix a few minutes in Kitchenaid using hook. Sticky but came together enough to make 12 medium rolls. Also buttered pan with softened unsalted butter. Dinner was late so full second rise not complete. Overall great bread.

Made exactly according to recipe. I've made rolls before, and in comparison, this dough was ridiculously sticky and difficult to work with. I even tried gloves as suggested by another reviewer and it was still really difficult to work with. The rolls were okay, and cooking them in the muffin tins was the only way that would have worked since the dough was way to sticky to form into balls. They turned out good, but due to the difficulty of working with the dough and they weren't the soft, fluffy dinner rolls I was looking for, I probably wil not try this particular recipe again.

Super easy and delicious recipe for someone who doesn't bake much! I read the reviews ahead of time and knew to follow the recipe exactly. The only change I made was to bake them in a casserole dish instead of muffin tins so they would look prettier for Thanksgiving. I used my stand mixer with the dough hook for mixing the dough and used the mixer bowl for the first rise. Because the dough is sticky, it was a little tricky to form the rolls, but I used a greased spoon and my hands. My family loved them and I will definitely bake again!

If you need a dozen traditional bread rolls in a hurry, this is a go-to recipe. So light and fluffy!  Trust the recipe... dough is VERY wet and sticky like a batter but you can use an oiled ice cream scoop to portion the dough into a couple muffin tins.  Husband LOVED them!

This is by far the best and easiest yeast roll recipe ever. Dough was a little too sticky to work with nonetheless added a half cup more flour and the rolls were so soft, moist, and very tasty. Will definitely make these again...

I thought these were very good, especially for a quick roll.  My husband didn't like the texture of the roll.  However, he had it cold and not right our of the oven.  The rest of the family really liked them.

Really good and light and fluffy, but not quite as much as I really want.  Not sure why they are called quick, as they still take two rises!  Overall, easy to make and the family loves them

I haven't made rolls before that didn't required kneading. It was a sticky mess and turned out amazing. It proofed almost too fast. I tripled recipe because I needed at least 20 for a dinner party. I would experiment putting in refrigerator so I can cook at last minute. I've never had anything rise so fast and had to cook them much sooner than I had expected. It's a keeper.

The dough looked and felt a little sticky but I expected that. I read comments BEFORE making these so I knew enough to give it a try before adding any extra flour. They were light and airy and tasted delicious! I will be making these again and again!

Quick and easy with consistent results
Because I was baking a large quantity, I prepared using several methods of preparation:
1 made and bake 
2 made and  delayed the second rising by refrigerating, until I could finish
3 made, frozen, then bake
All methods of preparation, produce light delicious rolls.

the dough is just fine! I made an error while converting cups to grams, so I ended up putting more flour than needed, but they still turned out delicious. next time I'll make sure to get the measurements right and maybe use just a bit less sugar. The recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made the recipe almost exactly as it's written (used butter not shortening).  Turned out GREAT! This is more of a batter that rises (not a dough in the traditional sense). I've already made them twice.  Yum.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this for my family and they were gone before I could get all of the dinner on the table! This is by far the easiest and quickest yeast roll recipe ever, and if you think the proportions are off... they're not. The dough is a sticky dough and when you go to put it in the muffin tin I suggest spraying the fingers with a little nonstick spray like Pam and then you can pick it up and pull off pieces big enough to go into each cup without it sticking to your fingers much if at all. Great recipe, no changes needed AT ALL!!! Will be making these on a regular basis everyone who's had them absolutely loves them and it doesn't take all day! Love, love, love these. Thanks.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated and they are perfect! Don't worry about the sticky dough. You do not need more flour. Stick to the recipe and you'll never use any other dinner roll recipe ever again!

The dough will be all weird and squishy and that is the way they work!

When I made them I was dubious as well. The dough looked way wrong.  But read the instructions - there is no kneading required, so the super squishy texture isn't really a problem. Put it in an oiled bowl and leave it be.

I used fresh yeast (just doubled the amount from dry) because it is what I have here.  Turned out perfectly.

The only thing I would change is that I would divide the dough into about 12 pieces because they really exploded over the top of the muffin pan and were bigger than I wanted.

I was hoping to love this recipe but didn't.  I followed the recipe exactly as written any the rolls were just ok.  They don't have much flavor and the texture was meh.  I will give this recipe one more try but they aren't like what my grandma use to make..

Very light and tasty.  I used half butter half shortening, It's supposed to be a sticky dough so don't add more flour, I used a scoop to portion the dough into muffin tins.

Great, simple recipe.  I'm not a baker, so I trusted the recipe as gloppy as it is while preparing.  Once they rise and go in the oven they come out great.  The only changes I made was reduce the sugar to 2 T instead of 3 because we don't care for sweet rolls and used lard because I didn't have any shortening.  Yummy. Definitely used the muffin tin to contain them. A keeper.

I've made this recipe over and over again. The only issue in this recipe is not saying the dough will be extremely sticky. Also I like to let mine rise almost to the point of blowing.

The only thing I changed was use Smart Balance (light) because it's all I had. I used a jumbo muffin pan (yields 6 rolls) and Cooked them  about 6 or 7 minutes. Light, airy and delicious. Of note I didn't even touch the dough...just mixed it with a spoon and used an ice cream scoop to transfer to the pan after the dough had doubled in size. So easy!

These are great rolls! Only change is I used 2 Tablespoons of salted butter instead of shortening. I let these rise until doubled the first time (around an hour) and I put these in a nonstick muffin pan that I lightly buttered and came out with 9 rolls. I let them rise the second time in the pan for about 30 minutes because they are so moist, the dough more or less spreads instead of rise up so they were all touching while they baked so I might make them smaller and fill all 12 cups next time. Overall a great no knead recipe. Definitely would make again!

Doubled the recipe, they were perfect - had a rotisserie chicken from Costco that we hadn't completely used so boiled it with onion, celery and seasonings. Thickened to make gravy, mashed potatoes and these rolls - a dinner that everyone loved.
Will make these again - make these exactly as written the 1st time, then, if you don't like the results make your changes. They are great.

I am not a cook or Baker. I usually never even review but I had to, these were perfect. Followed the instructions exactly. used a 1/4 measuring cup sprayed with PAM to "scoop" the dough into the muffin pan.

They are perfect, just like the Italian Rest. down the road. See Picture under I made it.

I probably rushed these a little bit, and they still turned out great.  The recipe made 12 large dinner rolls.  The rolls were pretty light and fluffy, just a little cakey for my taste--maybe because of the egg?  Any suggestions?

These were quick, easy and very tasty!  The texture is somewhere between a dinner roll and a muffin.  The batter us really wet/loose but don't be alarmed!  I will definitely make these again!

These rolls are the best and so quick and easy. I followed the recipe exactly using butter-flavored Crisco. I used 1/4 cup sugar and two extra tablespoons flour. I let the dough rise 50 minutes, then scooped into muffin tins using greased ice cream scooper, as per another reviewer's suggestion. 

I let the rolls rise again for about half an hour. I brushed tops with melted honey butter.  It took 12 minutes in my oven for them to be lightly browned. 

This recipe made 12 medium rolls for me. I filled the muffin tins 2/3 full.

They were perfect, so flakey and lightly sweet. This recipe is a keeper.

These were really good. I doubled the recipe because I didn't think 8 would be enough. I ended up with 24.  My granddaughter really liked them and asked me if I made them or bought them. The dough is very wet but the texture of the bun is nice. I wouldn't add more flour at all. I will be making these again for sure.

So good! Quick and easy. I had to add about a 1/4 C more flour. Not uncommon. Some flour is more "thirsty" than others. Will definitely make again!

It was the first time I ever made a bread and it was so easy! My only difficulty was finding the conversion for active dry yeast to instant yeast. So I used about 1.5tsps of instant yeast. The other thing was I wasn't sure if I should cover the dough? So I ended up covering for a short time n then I left it in the open as it rose. I didn't really keep track of the time it took to rise but I did the first rise washing up and preparing the muffin tray. Second rise I timed it using the 10mins pre heating of the oven. Seems to work well cos the bread turned out nice! Thks for sharing this wonderfully easy bread recipe!

As others have mentioned, it's pretty sticky at the dough stage.  Used an ice cream scoop to dispense equal amounts into the tin.  Did an egg yolk wash, added seasmie seeds & smoked sea salt to finish.  Came out really well.

This has become my go-to yeast roll recipe.  It's so easy. No is not like any other yeast roll recipe. Yes it's more liquidy. But give it a chance exactly as written first.  I like to use butter flavor shortening and substitute honey for the sugar and the rolls are reminiscent of the rolls you get at some steak restaurants. I also like is use a greased ice cream scoop to transfer to dough to the muffin tin or pan. I come back to this recipe time and time again when I make rolls for family get togethers. I can't tell you how many times I've doubled and tripled the recipe and bring home an empty bowl.

Great recipe it just needs a little bit more sugar and maybe brush some butter on top of the yeast roll after it's finished cooking

I absolutely love this recipe!! I have made it several times. My husband and daughters LUV this bread, too! I generally don't stray from the recipe but I have used agave nectar instead of sugar (no taste difference) & I have added Chia seeds and Flax seed meal for a little extra nutrition.  
Also, if you don't enjoy getting your hands too sticky, it bakes well in a cake pan for the same amount of bake temp & time!! It smells & tastes AWESOME!!! Great recipe :-)!!!

I followed this recipe exactly for a double batch for Easter Dinner (2016).  It was very straightforward and I had all the ingredients in the pantry. I would have probably freaked out at the moist sticky dough had I not already read the review by mikathegreat, who said it's supposed to be a sticky goopy mess.  I put the dough by half cup scoops in a muffin tin and it yielded eight very large crowned rolls.  My family and guests loved them, and I even had to pass on the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I was very happy with the end result.  The dough was very sticky, which made it a pain to work with.  Other than that, these are pretty easy and you end up with a nice tasting roll.  I did not like how mine looked like muffins so I will explore some alternatives to cooking in a muffin tin.

OMG! I used buttermilk flour and added sour cream and these rolls were awesome. I did have to use double the amount of flour and they were still a bit sticky, but the outcome was fabulous!

Didn't have cupcake pans so made one batch and baked in a large bread pan. Very good, soft, a touch of sweetness, light. Easy to make,  very little kneeling and quick time from scratch to dinner table.  Differently a favorite.

I made these for Christmas and they were incredible! So light and moist. My husband and guests raved about them. I am so glad the pastry chef wrote the comment about "scooping" the dough. Without his comment I would have panicked. It is a VERY wet dough.

Speedy, delicious and a great base recipe. Its spooned into the muffin tin not rolled, kneaded or shaped. Yes it's a sticky wet dough because it is intended to be fast. Made this just as in the recipe, lovely light bread rolls, will make again and of ten. Thank you!

I added just enough flour so that the dough was a little less sticky so I could smooth it in my hands.  After the first rise, I rolled into individual balls and let it rise again.

My family devoured them all in one sitting!  These were a huge hit and I will be making them over and over.

Added a little less sugar. Can't believe how light and delicious they were and so simple. I did not have a lot of time for raising and only did about 1/2 hour for both doubling times. Although after making the rolls I did let them raise in a 170 degree oven . One negative- dough a bit sticky.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I never have shortening, so I sub with either butter or margarine (whichever I have on hand). Have been making them for 2 years now and perfect and awesome every time! FYI, the dough is supposed to be sticky! That threw me off the first time...trust the recipe!

These are great, no frills rolls that are good the way they are; would most likely be even better with a bit of butter.   I paired them with some salmon, greens, and garlic dill potatoes.  The fam loved it!   The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the fact that the dough's rise time wasn't accounted for.  But hey, I'm a noob to baking bread and maybe it's a given?

Pretty good, very nice flavor.  I think they would make good sandwich rolls. I didn't put them in muffin pans, instead I oiled a 1/4 cup and scooped out the (very sticky) dough and rolled it in to balls and placed on parchment on a cookie tray.

My 10 year old just made these all by herself and they came out perfect! The inside was the perfect texture, the outside had just the right amount of crust, perfection.  She is thrilled, this is her first try at baking bread, she followed the directions to the letter.

I loved how simple the instructions and ingredients are.  Don't stress the details. It is supposed to be sticky and gooey, and just spoon it into the tin. (It doesn't need shaping.) I didn't even wait for it to fully "double in size" before baking and they puffed up and where nicely fluffy while baking! A keeper for sure!

I made these just as instructed and they were good. I was hoping for something a little airy-er but they had a great flavor and texture. I will make them again. Update: they do not keep well. The next day they were already like a cheap dinner roll texture-wise.

Fantastic recipe!  Like others, I read some helpful reviews and this is what I've found:  Follow the recipe as is.  I did hold off on adding the egg and flour until the yeast had proofed for 10 minutes and it came out fine.  I used the dough hook on my kitchenaid and mixed it just until it came together.  Yes, it will be a sticky gloppy mess that resembles sticky cake batter more than it resembles dough.  Let it rise for an hour, then use a spatula or spoon to "punch it down" (don't use your hands).  Liberally spray your muffin tin with baking spray then drop in spoonfuls with your spoon and spatula.  I filled them about a third to halfway and they rose beautifully.  Let them rise again in the muffin tin until ready to bake.  Bake 8-10 minutes (mine we done after 9).  Then enjoy.  They're absolutely delicious and easy to make!

I've been looking for an easy yeast roll recipe for years, that actually turns out right every time.  This is it!!  I've made it several times now and the rolls have turned out perfect every time.  YES THE DOUGH WILL BE STICKY!!  Almost stringy.  I used a cookie scoop lightly dusted with flour and it was easy and little mess.  No kneading.  Awesome.  Be sure to let the dough double in size twice.  This is one nice, easy recipe.   Not quite sure why people change everything around and then slam the recipe.  Follow this recipe and you'll have good results!

I was in a pinch for dinner rolls and found this gem of a receipe, I was lacking regular shortening and used butter flavor shortening instead.  I followed the directions to allow to rise once in the bowl and again after putting in the muffin pan...THESE rolls are AWESOME!!  Light with just the right amount of sweetness.  I brushed mine with butter right after they came from the oven.  These rolls disappeared!  Will definitely be making these again!!

It was my first time making dinner rolls ever...or buns for that matter....the only thing i changed from the recipe is using butter instead of shortening(dont have any in hand and didnt want to buy it) ~~It came out pretty good~a little dense, but overall good!

This was the best!!! I'm a REAL beginner and this recipe was so simple!!!. I doubled it and added a little extra flour to make them rolls instead of putting into muffin cups. My family LOVED THEM!!!

Best rolls ever! My whole family was raving for more. Stick close to the recipe, and you'll get good results. After the first rising, just grease a tablespoon and scoop into the muffin tin like cupcake batter before letting it rise again. Delicious!

I made these today, the day before Christmas to test on whether my family would like them.  I followed the receipe except I didn't have shortning.  I used margarine .  Like everyone else it seemed a little but I didn't make any other changes.  They tasted really good.  But they looked more like muffins than yeast rolls.  nothing like the pic.  But that could be  because I used the margarine.  I guess I'll try them on the family tomorrow

Delicious!  The flavor and texture is fantastic, light and fluffy.  The dough is runny, but just stir it with a big spoon, and scoop it into the cups with the spoon after the first rise, no need to dirty your hands to make this bread, though a finger dipped in water helps to smooth the tops after dropping the dough into the cups.  So little mess or effort, I do it all in one bowl.  Seems to work out fine if I substitute 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour.  So quick to cook, makes it easy to have them ready with the rest of the meal.

These were AMAZING! Made them for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved them. This was the first time I made rolls from scratch and I thought it was so simple. I made them about a week ahead of time and stored them in the freezer until Thanksgiving morning. I took them out of the freezer in the morning so they could come up to room temp and just warmed them up a bit before serving. I used a parchment lined foil pan instead of a muffin tin, and I needed to add quite a bit of extra flour so I could work the dough into a ball shape as the dough was super sticky. But if using muffin cups I'm sure just scooping it in would be fine. Will definitely make these again.

Follow the recipe! Yes, if you've made any bread ever you'll think the consistency is absolutely crazy but trust me, it'll be fine. They kind of end up like muffin rolls and oh so yummy. I'm making this for the second time to try freezing a bunch so I always have some on hand.

This recipe is an easy way to make dinner rolls.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The dough is sticky, but I resisted adding more flour.  I scooped the dough into 8 muffin cups, but I think I will divide the dough into 12 muffin cups in the future.  The rolls were huge when making only the 8 that the recipe called for.

They didn't rise much. They were also very hard and dense. The only positive thing that I can say is that the flavor was nice.

I made these exactly as the recipe says. The dough IS very sticky. Do not add more flour. You will not make balls, but rather scoop off portions and drop them into your muffin cups. These rolls bake up fantastically moist, yet light and spongy. Very slightly sweet, and when the warm yeasty flavor combined with some sweet cream butter, it was absolutely the perfect roll to go with Thanksgiving dinner this year.  I have saved this recipe and will be making it again and again!  Thank you!

I have used this recipe 3 times and will bake again tonight.  I place the  wet ingredients then dry ingredients in my bread maker place the settings on dough.   Once the dough was completely mixed, I take the dough out and it rises in a bowl.  I follow the  recipe as is.

These were super easy, fast, and DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe as best as I could and read lots of reviews thankfully! I didn't want to sweet of a roll, so I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 tbsp. I also used rapid rise yeast bc that's what I had. I made 5 batches for Thanksgiving and had more than 50 rolls!

Really good,easy recipe. This dough is suppose to be sticky and wet. Don't worry, you didn't do anything wrong so don't add flour or anything else. Just spoon the dough into your  muffin pan. I did use use bread flour instead of AP flour,just because I prefer the gluten content. I am also a pastry chef with specialization in breads. I use this recipe for a quick  go-to at home for fresh bread with little work.

I portioned the dough out on a flat baking pan, after the 10 min cook time I lightly sprayed the tops with olive oil and toasted the tops on broil for an additional 2 min. fantastic dinner rolls.

I made no changes and these rolls turned out perfectly. 

For those of you wondering about proofing times, here's what I did. 

After stirring in the yeast I left the mixture to bloom for 5 minutes, but next time I would wait longer. After adding the flour, I left the dough to proof for 1 hour. My kitchen was very cold and after half an hour I had little progress, so I let my bowl sit over a pot of warm water. The dough was very much like a sticky cake batter, so I scooped it into muffin tins using a 1/4 cup measuring cup. I left it to rise again for 10 minutes before baking. The rolls rose beautifully and are very light and fluffy. I do wish they had a more yeasty flavor, but that is probably due to the type of yeast I had on hand.

Used this recipe tonight to make hoagie rolls and bread sticks. I must say they came out perfectly. They were light, fluffy, and a little sweet (not too sweet, just perfect). After I made the hoagie rolls I decided to make the bread sticks and added some garlic, oregano, and basil. Then I topped them with shredded cheese right before baking and they are so delicious. Great recipe! I highly recommend using it and as I said it is great for more than just rolls. Make sure you let them rise or they will not be light and fluffy.

I love this because it is so simple!! I hate the longwinded recipes (ain't got time for that). The only thing I don't like is the smell of yeast.  I wish I could make bread that looks and taste great like this without yeast.  Maybe there is a recipe out there. The only change I made was used butter instead of shortening.  Shortening is not good so I stay away from it.  Will definitely be making again!

Excellent!!!  I will try this recipe again and use a normal pan to stack the rolls side by side.   We loved how the rolls turned out.  After baking for more than 20 years,  I can certainly see why this won the state fair award!  Thanks for sharing!!

I'm famous for my homemade rolls, and wanted a quicker recipe than mine so I tried this one. I went by the recipe except I didn't have shortening so I used butter. They turned out more like biscuits than rolls, and not nice ones at that. :-(

I just made these and they were fabulous! The only substitution I made was using butter instead of shortening since it is no longer a staple in my cabinet. I followed the recipe by the instructions & I'm amazed at how easy these were to make!

Made no changes to the ingredients, only the process. Bloomed the yeast with sugar and 100 degree water, mixed in shortening, then egg, then flour and salt. I also gave it a second proofing after panning them. Dough will be sticky but /do not work it/. I just used an 4oz scoop to scoop blobs into a cake pan so the end product was a beautiful round "loaf" made of many individual pull-apart rolls.

Would I make this again? Absolutely. This is my new Thanksgiving recipe.

I have made these rolls twice in two days! No changes, and they are SO light and fluffy!!! This is a batter yeast dough and you do NOT want to add more flour! I let mine rise and then take a spring loaded scoop and scooped the dough into a muffin tin (first time) and a cake tin (second time). First time I got 12 rolls/muffins second time yielded 16 rolls.

Made no changes to the recipe. Sticky dough but just use a spoon and dump it in the muffin tin. Let it rise for a bit then follow baking directions 425 for 10 min. Super great, and easy. A sure family favorite forever.

These were pretty good.  I didn't have any shortening, so I had to use butter instead.  I do think the rolls could use a bit more flavor, but I liked the texture and how easy they were to prepare.   We've had them three times already.

Light, fluffy, yeasty little clouds! Tastes just like Grandma used to make. I was worried about make a yeast bread as I do not have any experience with it, but this was so easy. If I can do it, anybody can!

Don't change the recipe! It's amazing as is! My whole family LOVES them. And for goodness sakes don't substitute every single ingredient then complain and give it 2 stars because it didn't turn out right.

This is my go-to yeast roll recipe. They are wonderful. For a family of five, I increase the recipe by 50%. I don't change the ingredients or proportions at all. The dough is wet and you spoon it into the muffin cups (I use silicone ones for easy clean up). Great for breakfast with jam, or dinner rolls. The longer they rise, the better they are.

Wow! I followed this recipe exactly, except I used butter instead of shortening. These are the BEST yeast rolls I have had. Even the dill-dough yeast rolls we made in pastry school (for laughs) wasn't as good as this. This is getting printed and put on my corkboard, because it is fantastic. For those worried the dough is too sticky, use a spoon to scoop dough into the tins. I promise, it will turn out! They are as light as store bought and as flavorful as fresh-from-grandma's-kitchen.

Very tasty. I made these just as stated on the exile, EXCEPT I used bacon fat instead of shortening (cause that's some nasty , y'all!), and cut the sugar in half. They rose very quickly for the first rase (about 25 mins), then more slowly after i had glopped them into muffin tins (about 40 mins). Batter is a little hard to work with. I found that using a silicone spat in one hand, and scissors to cut the dough up worked really well. Cook time needed about 4 more minutes than stated in my oven. My rolls stuck pretty bad to my pan, so grease those cups, even if they're nonstick. Tasty right out of the oven! I made these to go with Caesar salad, Grilled steaks, and caraway-roasted carrots. Definitely should have kept the sugar as specified, since it would have added some moisture to the dough. I docked one star due to the dough being so gloopy and hard to work, sticking to the pan, and the rolls don't taste that great the next day.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the finished product was so much better than I expected for such a simple recipe!! It doesn't instruct or even suggest rolling these into balls AND IT STATES that the dough IS sticky...ya gotta spoon em into the muffin tin. Nothing's wrong with the recipe...as sticky as the dough was, the rolls were better than some breads I've spent hours and hours making! Simple. Airy. Moist...perfect yeast roll! My husband and son tried to convince me that they "needed" to eat em all :) 
I suggest reading the recipe in its entirety before ya get started and then..just follow it....try it, they're really yummy!
 I will be making these more often! Good job!!! And thank you!!!

These were the best dinner rolls I have made in quite a long time.  SUPER easy, and extraordinarily fast.  I'm not sure why others had problems with the sticky dough...it was slightly an issue, but I followed other recommendations and simply dusted the cutting board and knife before cutting (no problem).  Rolled the dough into rounds, and allowed it to rise together in a cast iron skillet...YUM!  Next time, I may experiment by adding a little veggie oil or milk to vary the softness of the dough, but overall this is an absolute winner.

I make bread fairly regularly, so I was really confused when this recipe didn't call for any kneading. The dough was also very sticky for bread dough. I read the reviews, and many people said to just follow the instructions exactly and to go with the sticky dough. I tried it, and it worked and my family scarfed it down.

However, I have to say, this dough really needs kneading if you want it to be a bread roll. Without the kneading, it's very cake-like and very much like a biscuit.

These are a staple in my kitchen. I replaced the shortening with butter and they are SO amazing. I usually top them with a bit of melted honey butter when they come out the oven. Delish!

These rolls are super easy to make and very tasty!  I followed the directions but used butter instead of shortening.  As others have said, the dough is sticky.  But they turn out so well.  These rolls remind me of pull-apart dinner rolls.

I have made these several times exactly as written. Very easy to make! I allow the dough to rise 40 minutes in the bowl and then an additional 40-50 minutes once divided into the muffin tins. They've come out perfect every time and my family and my neighbor LOVE these rolls. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe came out extremely wet. I live in the south though, so I'm not sure what caused the mess up. There wasn't enough sugar in this recipe to allow the yeast to rise quickly, either. Yeast needs warmth (75-90 degrees) and sugar to grow. It took me 5 hours to get them risen enough to be considered rolls, and even then not all of it rose to my occasion. Eventually, when it wasn't rising, or doing absolutely anything (an hour later...) I had to keep adding flour too. Bread should not be so sticky you can't touch it, because kneading it is what gives it it's fluffiness. It gets it airy and light. In fact croissants are kneaded multiple times to get them light. All in all, I got several compliments on them, but they were not quick. I ended up adding another entire cup just to get it to where it should be, and then there was very little yeast flavor. It tasted more like flour and water biscuits. Again, maybe being in a hot humid location didn't help me out here.

I love these rolls!! I did exactly as the recipe says to do except for the fact that I used butter because I didn't have shortening. The dough is more like an airy cake batter. Don't let that scare you and DON'T add any additional flour!!! They come out PERFECT if you do exactly what the recipe says.

I woke up today craving for bread. I searched the internet for a really easy and quick recipe and found this! It turned out great! I made a few adjustments. I used an Instant Rapid RiseYeast instead of the Dry active Yeast since thats all I have. I also replaced the shortening with butter.

While I was mixing the ingredients, I also turned the oven on for a a minute or two. I turned it off immediately since I just wanted warm place to store my dough to help it rise. After about or 10 minutes, the dough was double the size. I used a spatula to kind of punch the dough but I did not remove it from the dough. I used an Ice Cream Scoop to measure and transfer the dough to the muffin pan.  Instead of just 8 rolls, I had 10. :)

Thanks for posting this recipe. It made my day!  Ill try it again next time and hopefully I get the same result!

I thought the dough was difficult to work with (may have just been me though). The rolls were light and airy on the insides and had a good flavor.

So quick and easy! I used to make a standard yeast parker-house roll in pie tins, but those take 4 hours minimum. This recipe provides a fast, substantial roll with minimal effort - no kneading, and no additional bowls for rising! Just mix, let sit, and scoop into muffin cups!  I've made it twice; the first time I filled 8 cups as the recipe called. They ended up spilling over the top, so next time I filled all 12. They turned out perfect!

I just made these rolls, and they were wonderful!  They would be a great roll for a beginning baker, with no kneading or shaping of the rolls.  Thanks for a great recipe!  And I followed the recipe exactly!

These turned out so yummy.  Follow the recipe with some faith, and they will turn out just great (but also ugly).  Don't add lots of flour like some of the other reviews suggest as it will make them more dense. I did knead them for a few minutes the third time I made them, but that was only to help make them prettier. You can dust them with flour to help with working them when you get ready to portion the rolls.  I turned my broiler on to brown them on top the first time, but an egg wash accomplished the same thing without over cooking them.  I will say my first two batches looked absolutely NOTHING like the pretty picture up top.  I did finally figure it out with the extra things I mentioned, but I really wish there was a video showing how to make that happen.

No sticky problems here!  Used glass bowl, metal serving spoon to stir.  Left spoon in bowl for first rising (about 45 mins) and used same spoon to "cut" the dough against the bowl.  Used plastic spatula to encourage dough off the spoon.  Made 12 good sized rolls.  Thank you Very Much for the recipe!

Wow! These were so easy and even though they don't have as rich a flavor as my regular go to recipe the time saved is worth it! I followed the recipe exactly, the dough is gooey, but thanks to previous reviews it was not an issue.  I might add some extra butter to the shortening next time just to see if it deepens the flavor, but they're great as is!

Good basic bread. Either add more sugar to make it sweet, or more salt and other spices. As is it is a bit bland. Always turns out. 2.5 tsp per 0.25 oz yeast.

AMAZING! I ended up adding about an extra cup of flour to make the dough more manageable and I also added some thyme, basil and oregano to the mix. Also after letting them rise for the second time (in a baking dish, for pull apart buns) I brushed them with a little melted butter and then sprinkled a little bit of parmesean cheese on the top! I brought them to a family gathering and they were a HUGE hit! :)

After creating versions of this recipe, I  went simple, I would call them bread cakes. They taste like bread. I put two cups Plain Flour, & one cup instant potatoes. add 1/2 teaspoon Salt, two eggs, 1/2 teaspoon yeast, in 12 oz warm water, mix yeast mixture well. Then stir full recipe. Let set in a covered pan for about 4 hours. Drop about 6 biscuits on an oiled griddle, @375 deg. flip when half done, finish on other side. It makes about 6 bread cakes 3/4 in thick, I live at 2000ft altitude. If you want a cinnamon biscuit, just sprinkle a little cinnamon & sugar, & you have a great low sugar coffee cake.

Easiest recipe ever.  I followed the directions and did exactly.  It came out perfectly.  These are simple quick yeast rolls.  I have made them several times since and used butter instead of shortening.  My husband eats 4 or 5 each time I make them.  For a quick easy yeast roll this rates high in my menu book.

This recipe was just like my grandmother's yeast rolls. I never tried making these before, but these turned out great. I thought I was doing it wrong because they were a little  sticky trying put them in the muffin pan but I watch the video too and notice that was OK. Just follow the recipe and they'll be awesome.

Made these yeast rolls last night and they are really easy and super delicious.Dough is very sticky so to handle it I sprinkled a little flour. Made it much easier. These would be easy for a beginner to make they are so easy. Didnt take as long as it says for them to rise because I turned my oven on. Used a big glass bowl and sat the bowl of dough near the stove and covered it with a clean towel.The slight heat from the oven being on kept it slightly warm. (dough will rise faster in warmer conditions for those that dont know)

I love this recipe. I was looking for something quick and easy since I forgot to buy dinner rolls. It did help that others said that the dough would be sticky. I didn't change the recipe at all and they came out great.

Followed the recipe and it turned out delicious.  I used an ice cream scoop "divide" the dough directly from the bowl and I got nine rolls.  Soft, light and yummy.  Will make again

I'm new to making my own bread. The recipes I try only work out about 50% of the time. This one I followed to the T. It turned out to be the most delicious rolls I have ever had! These rolls will become a weekly thing in my household. It was very easy and totally worth the time

The bread came out great! I said next time I'd add a little more salt. I will definitely bake these again!

Followed it to a TEE except I used coconut oil and butter since I don't eat pork(lard) or shortening. Came out perfect. Let it rise for 30 minutes and then 10 minutes in the pan. Found this as an emergency recipe for my Christmas dinner with unexpected guests. Will use again and again and again!

The only good thing I can say about this recipe is that it was easy.  I have regular sized muffin tins, not tiny, but this recipe made a dozen rolls for me, and I followed the recipe exactly.  They rose so high in the tins that the dough baked on the sides and I had to cut them out when they had baked.  And the rolls are more like cupcakes than bread rolls.  I won't make these again.

Fool proof!  Used 1 1/2 tbsp more of sugar.  Used fast acting yeast, put a damp hand towel over the bowl & sat it on the stove (while it was preheated) almost the full hour to help the dough rise. Made 6 big ones instead of 8 in a cupcake pan. Baked for 11 mins, & put on the hot stove for couple more mins.  Came out perfect!  Thank you!   This was my first time making something using yeast! :D

Followed this recipe EXACTLY and they are the BEST rolls I've ever had! My hubby flipped! No changes needed!! Will only use this recipe from now on!
P.S. They taste like restaurant rolls, have the texture of restaurant rolls,  kind of sweet, but they look just like biscuits!

I made these rolls and used the recipe just as it was written.  The dough was sticky but I read other reviews and just went with it.  They came out beautifully- light.

This is an amazing recipe for quick and very tasty buns.  The dough is VERY STICKY.  However there is no kneading required.  After the first rise, I just scooped out the dough into the muffin tins and let the dough rise again.  This recipe is a must keep for sure.

I give this five stars because they were just as I expected! Light and spongey, took about an hour or so to make. Only alteration I did was substitute butter for shortening, it's a preference of mine :) I formed mine into nine portions, and put them in a 9by9" brownie pan and let them rise 20 minutes. Because it is a very sticky wet dough and I was forming them into balls instead of muffin tins, I put a generous sprinkle of flour over the mass of dough so I could lightly handle it, and portion it out into 9 "balls". After baking they poofed together (es I expected) into a square shape but still separate rolls(used fork to lift them out and separate a bit). I have experience make rolls and bread often (weekly) so I knew how to handle a wet dough like this. As other raters have said, do not add extra flour to initial dough mixture! Use flour for lightly handling after first rise, if you decide to.

Please make these rolls just as in the recipe! They are so easy and so good. The flavor is really delightful with just the right amount of sweetness. Fastest and tastiest roll recipe I've ever tried. Just try the recipe as is! I wouldn't want to change a thing!

I've never made yeast rolls before, but the video made it look so simple, I decided to give it a try. 
They were so easy to make, and my husband and I love them! Today I am making them for thanks giving, I'm sure they will be a hit! 
Side note: I used real butter instead of shortening, because I don't keep shortening on hand. After reading some of the negative reviews, I thought it may have added some flavor to the recipe.

Rolls were really great!  Easy to make and followed the recipe as is.  My only suggestion is this recipe makes more than 8 rolls, more like 12.  They rose quiet nicely for me so I really should have made 12, as my 8 rolls were huge!

I made a double batch thinking it would make 16 rolls.  It made 24.  I did follow the recipe exactly except for the doubling.  I did use a kitchenaid with a breadhook to mix and they turned out fine.  A little dense, but they're yeast rolls not croissants, folks.  I will absolutely make these again.

These were delicious but tasted more like Portuguese Sweet Bread than a dinner roll.  Will definitely make again but use real butter instead of shortening, and half the sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly and yes as stated in previous reviews the dough is VERY sticky and it will continue to be sticky even after the first proof. Keep to the recipe and you will be richly rewarded as these are delicious and SO EASY to make homemade rolls!!!

These rolls are awesome! I followed the directions just as written and they came out perfect. The dough will be sticky....just oil your hands when rolling them out. I cooked them in my grandmothers cast iron biscuit pan and WOW.

I have been making these quick yeast rolls for 4 years. They are easy for me to make, since I don't have much experience baking bread or other yeast goodies. No kneading needed!

To get the mixed dough to rise more quickly, I turn on my oven to 300-350 degrees, put the covered mixing bowl on top of the stove, and then rotate the bowl every 15-20 min. 

I use butter instead of shortening. The dough is sticky, but drops off of a serving spoon into the muffin tin's cups. Since my muffin tin holds only 6 rolls, I use 2 to 4 small Pyrex custard dishes in which to bake the remaining rolls.

I will be interested to try rolling this dough into balls and baking them in a 9 x 13, as other reviews have said they do.

I always wanted to make yeast rolls but never did--UNTIL NOW! This recipe rocks and they came out great. I want rolls and not muffins so next time (soon) I will just drop them on parchment covered cookie sheet instead of using the muffin pan.

This is my new go-to roll recipe. Fabulously light, chewy and delicious. I make the dough in the breadmaker on the dough cycle (90 min) then scoop into the muffin cups, greased with a little shortening to make them release easily. Yes, the dough will be sticky, but don't add flour! These rolls are delish.

Wanted a quick easy recipe for thanksgiving. This was perfect! I made two batches today. Go exactly by the recipe! I wasn't paying attention and added a little extra flour to the first batch. The second batch turned out GREAT!

A simple yeast roll to make. The dough is a little sticky, but don't add extra flour.  That will result in a heavier roll.  My muffin pans are smaller, so my yield was 12 rather than 8.  DH is the bread eater and he loved them.  They are best eaten warm on the day they are made.

Let me start off by saying the dough is supposed to be sticky. I made these twice in one week. Both times they were gobbled up. Just try the recipe as is. Won't be disappointed. I ate them warm or cold.  They were divine.

Super quick and easy, followed directions exactly as written. Don't even worry about the dough being too sticky - you can still portion it with your hands into the muffin tins. It made 12 LARGE buns for me, so I can't imagine it making eight. Brushed the tops with melted margarine when they came out and my family raved about them. Apparently they taste like doughnuts? All are gone already. I'll probably double this next time.

I love to cook and enjoy baking a few loaves of banana bread every now and then, but I was always reluctant to try yeast rolls! I decided to make a go of it with this recipe. I used an eight section mini loaf pan and they came out perfect on my first try! Thanks so much for this recipe! My family thanks you as well.. My thighs on the other hand does not thank you! What my mouth loves my thighs do not! Lol! :)

Love this recipe. It's a good base. 
I made a couple changes.  
Used honey instead of sugar, used half the salt and only 2/3 cup water. 
I also just flattened dough into a 9x9 stone and scored with a pizza cutter before baking. Added a few minutes to baking time also. 
TASTED GREAT! FLUFFY BUNS!

Honestly I loved this recipe! It was quick easy and fun to do with the kids. But I do know what DOJAGRAM  was saying about the flour. The thing is some of us sift flour and some just scoop it out of the container. If you sift the flour or "fluff" your flour you will have less than you need. But technically your not adding anymore than you need if you add more. But to make it simple don't sift it. The dough was sticky but just leave it that way cause the rolls come out amazing. You might think they won't BUT THEY WILL! :)

Made these rolls exactly as written and they were perfect!  Yes the dough is suppose to be very wet and sticky, that's what makes them light and airy.  On the second rise it only took abot 30 minutes and they rose so much that I would suggest only filling the muffin tins half way.  My husband said he has never had better rolls anywhere!  I agree!

These rolls weren't really rolls at all. At least not what I was expecting. They were very easy to make, however they were very dense. Not airy like I was expecting. I probably will not make again. Good taste but rather muffin like.

I tried these last night and they were great!  I followed the receipe exactly and the rolls came out so light and fluffy.  Also, if you want a little taste of heaven, put some cold butter on one of these rolls hot out of the oven.  AMAZING!  They were so easy too.  I didn't even need to use my mixer -- I just stirred everything together.  This recipe is very forgiving too -- I forgot to beat the egg before adding it, so I beat it in the bowl, and I noticed there were a few lumps of shortening as I was putting the batter in the muffin cups -- no problem.  It all came out fine.  You do have to be careful not to let the batter rise too much in the muffin cups.  I'm thinking about trying to use mini-muffin cups next time because these rolls were so huge!

Read the comments before I started and started w a dbl batch. Half done in the muffin trays and half as tear-away buns. Both turned out great! Dough was slightly sticky but floured surface and hands took care if that problem. Already have plans to make again.

This is a great recipe!  The rolls turned out so light and fluffy. I used a mini muffin tin and brushed the tops with homemade honey butter. Delicious!!!

This was my first time baking any kind of bread and I'm a novice in the kitchen overall. This recipe seemed like a great one to start with. I followed it exactly, using a new package of yeast and not increasing the flour. I did not use a muffin pan but put scoops of dough onto a cookie sheet The flavor was really good but the rolls turned out crusty and dense like biscuits. I was so disappointed since I was hoping to get yeasty, soft rolls. I'm sure the recipe isn't at fault! What did I do wrong? I gave it four stars only because it sounded so simple but it's easier to mess up than it's made out to be.

So easy!  I got the greatest compliment "These taste just like grandma's!". Only one slight substation, oil in place of shortening. Other than that, followed it to the letter.   I have a son with both soy and dairy allergies so store bread is out. He ate these up and so did everyone else!

This is the best and easiest roll recipe . . ever. I don't know why there are reviews that say you need to change it up a bit. Indeed, the dough is sticky but the rolls come out great anyway. They don't burn and are quite soft & golden on the top. Even when I spilled most the water, sugar, and shortening in the beginning (it was late & I'm clumsy) and subbed some of the shortening with olive oil it did not effect the outcome. 

I've cooked so many recipes, and I'm learning that a lot of the best recipes I've ever tried are actually the simplest ones to make; complicated does not mean better.

As others stated the dough was waaaaay to sticky and almost like a batter when I made it so I had to add much more flour.  BUT, with more flour it turned perfectly and these were the best rolls I have ever made.  So, next time I will try 2/3 cup of water as suggested by another rater and keep using this recipe with some tweeks.  I am also going to use this as my go to all-purpose bread recipe.

The only thing I'd like to add is that you should knead the dough a little bit after  step 2. I tried it both ways and the texture improved greatly when kneaded at that stage to pop some of the air bubbles before more are formed.
Otherwise, like others, I also subbed butter for the shortening and used different types of flour, because that's more to my taste. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Fantastic! Make these as written and you won't have an issue. Yes the dough will be sticky hence the use of a muffin tin. They are really yummy with peanut butter!

I followed the recipe exactly and these rolls where perfect!!! I used a cookie scoop to help distribute the dough evenly and ended up with 10 rolls instead of 8. My family loved these rolls. Thank you for this super easy and quick recipie!

Super delish!  My family LOVED them!  Super easy to make & I didn't change a thing.  I sprayed a serving spoon with spray oil dropped them next to each other in a pan instead of muffin tins. Looked & tasted great!  I'm saving this one!  Thanks for sharing.

This was my first time making yeast rolls and they were FANTASTIC!!! Yes, the insides where a little different than commercial rolls, but they were sweet and delicious none the less! 

Thank you Mikathemighty for your review, I did not make any adjustments to the recipe and they really didn't need any!

YUMMY! EXCELLENT! Was gone part of yesterday and decided to make homemade bread for supper.  It was our mom & dad's 59th wedding anniversary and they were coming to my sister's & my house for supper.  We're sisters whom I'm the one who does most of the cooking in our house. I didn't have too much time to make bread and checked a few of my cookbooks first before looking online.  This recipe is quick & easy. We always love leftover homemade bread and I wasn't sure who all were coming but it ended up being just the 4 us for supper last night.  Due to the time I had, I used quick-rise yeast and doubled the recipe. I had muffin tins to make 12 muffins.  Then I put the rest into 3 mini loaf pans.  Could have used 2 but I didn't want the loaves too big.  I also didn't have enough plain Crisco but used butter-flavored instead.  YUMMY! They were light & fluffy when warm but still was light & soft after they sat for awhile. I have Psoriasis on my hands & feet. Also, my hands hurts sometimes.  So, this recipe was just what I needed.  I used my 20-yr.-old KitchenAid stand mixer and let it do the mixing for me.  I do plan to experiment with this dough to try it with wheat flour and herbs.  I also plan to make muffins to freeze so that I can have them anytime I want.  I have officially found my bread recipe!  LOL

Wow! I was very impressed with these rolls. I followed the recipe except for using half whole wheat flour, and buttering the tops with LOTS of butter. They turned out amazingly good. The texture isn't exactly like normal rolls, but it was still fine. I will definitely be making this again.

I made the quick yeast rolls, they came out really soft and airy. I read the reviews first so that I do not make any mistake I watched the video too. I had some guests over they loved and took the recipe so they could prepare the rolls.

I used Splenda instead of sugar and it worked great.

I bake a lot of breads. If you know breads, you know the more flour in your dough, the denser the consistency of your bread. If you modify a recipe, it's not a recipe to review, it now has became your own. 
As for this recipe, it's fabulous. Expect a sticky dough. Using a greased large serving spoon helps to transfer it into muffin tins. I like big rolls, so I use a deep muffin pan and fill them high.

There's a word for these rolls and its "strange".  While the taste was good, the texture wasn't the same as a regular yeast roll and they looked awful! So glad I made a batch before I served them to guests.  I also didn't see where they were any quicker then regular  yeast rolls. Sure you dont have to knead them but if you have a stand mixer & a dough hook, that does the kneading for you. I think I'll stay with traditional yeast rolls.

I read several reviews before trying this recipe and I decided not to change a thing. I let my dough rise both times for 30 minutes. The dough was very sticky so I used my medium sized scoop from Pampered Chef to scoop into the muffin tins and it worked great. I also made some in a round cake pan and it also worked fine. I put some melted butter on them when they came out of the oven and they were delicious! My kitchen smells great and it's snowing outside!! Perfect. Me and hubby are Happy, Happy, Happy!!!

This recipe is so delicious. I follow it exactly as written except I do add a handful of grated extra sharp cheddar cheese and 3 tsps. of garlic powder. The smell is amazing! Yes, this is a very sticky recipe, but nothing that a spoon cannot handle. The only extra flour I add is on the surface that I turn the dough out to and on the spoon. 

The rolls come out so soft and delicious! Very quick and easy! Love it.

These were very quick and tasty.  I had used a different quick yeast roll recipe for years and it was good, but the leftover rolls were very dry the next day.  These keep well.  I'm not a fan of sweetness in breads so I'm going to cut the sugar in half when I make again.  I do not use shortening so I used butter and it was just fine.

My husband has been wanting me to make yeast rolls for the longest time. I put it off because I was a little intimidated about using yeast. I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out perfect and so delicious. The recipe is so easy to follow .I will definitely be making them again. Thank you for sharing.

Loved these!!! Easy, quick....for yeast rolls..rushed a little...only let rise in bowl for 45 minutes...muffin pan for 30 min....then baked for 11 minutes. Took 1 hour 25 for me...not the 1 hour 40. Came out great. All 3 kids loved,but my baby loved the most and normally passes on the bread :)

Best rolls I've made yet! I doubled the batch, because I have a large family and 8 just simply ain't cutting it. It went along great with the turkey, I made it kinda like a sandwich with the meat between :D Sooo yummy. Although, I did think it had hardly a flavor, which is good in some cases. :)

This was a fantastic recipe! I always follow the recipe when making for the first time, then I run with it after that. This will be a family favorite very quickly I'm sure, as the entire pan was gone in one meal! Very delicious!

Absolutely delicious and easy. The recipe stated it would make 8 but I got 16! I used about 2 tablespoons of dough in my muffin tin and as I said I got 16 rolls. Very good ones too.

These are awesome. I have made them several times and they always come out great. Yes, the dough is very sticky, but the rolls will be awesome if you follow the directions. (Sometimes on humid days it doesn't hurt to add just a little extra flour.) enjoy!

My family loves yeast rolls. Never had any luck, but I needed some bread one nite and I found this receipe. It sounded easy & had been rated high so I thought I would try it. DO NOT try to cut corners by putting in microwave as one suggested. I tried the first batch & it was set at the suggested power level of 10% just like they said. Had to throw it out because it partly cooked it. Follow the receipe exactly and it will come out beautifully.  This is a keeper.

These were not good AT ALL! They were a lumpy mix between a biscuit and a roll... not soft and fluffy in any respect. And even with butter they were just really bland. If you put water and flour together and baked it would probably have more flavor than these. If I had to describe these I guess I would call them a dry, bland, crumbly muffin and I have no suggestion of how to improve these.

I made these rolls several times over the holidays and everyone liked them.  They are so easy to make and require little hands on time.  Very convenient if you are pressed for time.  Doubled the recipe and refrigerated half the batter to make buns for ham sandwiches the next day.  This recipe is a definitely a keeper.

I agree do not rate something if you don't follow the directions. This dough is meant to be sticky and has turned out great every time I've made it (which as been numerous times)... I have added more flour to make cinnamon rolls out the dough this is my go to roll/cinnamon roll recipe!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing it!:)

I love these rolls. Had trouble with them not rising a couple times. Last night I added in a handful of sugar and some warm water when they weren't rising & it did the trick. My kids love them & they're really easy.

I made these rolls for Christmas dinner, substituting margarine for the shortening. My guys loved them! I found I could have made 12 smaller rolls instead of 8, but all of us enjoyed them. I brushed the tops with melted margarine before baking. So easy, too!

I only changed one thing but only because I didn't have shortening.  I used butter instead, shortening is not s something I usually have on hand but butter is.  These still came out tasty and perfect.  Follow the recipe and you'll have no complaints

This is now my go-to bread roll recipe, especially if I'm short on time.  Everyone loves the bread, whether its in dinner roll form or loaf form.  It lasts about 5 seconds in our house.

I made it exactly as written. The rolls were ok. Nothing special. I was disappointed based on it having such great reviews. The recipe was super easy. The rolls were average. This is one recipe I won't be keeping. I have tasted better.

These were delicious.  The first time you try this recipe make sure you follow the instructions as best you can.  I used butter for shortening.  Dough is sticky but just use a spatula to mix, a spoon and spatula to get it into the muffin pan, and it's easy enough without getting your hands messy.

Wonderful recipe! Used this recipe to go with a pot roast and mashed potatoes and ended up most eating dinner rolls because they were AMAZING!  I've only made homemade bread a few times but this is now my go to recipe for dinner rolls.  I definitely recommend this.  A lot easier than you would expect.

The temptation is to add more flour. I almost did and am glad I didn't. I stuck to the directions and the bread turned out beautiful and delicious. I used an ice cream scoop to put the dough in the muffin pans after it rose the first time. I have mini loaf pans and I used those to make about 4 small loaves. It all turned out great and helped make our Thanksgiving a success!

Very, very sticky and messy. I added an additional 1/2 cup of flour but not any more because I did not want to end up with dense rolls.  The additional flour did not help.  I would have given this recipe 2 stars because I think too much liquid is added, but they tasted alright in the end.  However, I'll use a different recipe for rolls next time.

I have a good bread recipe but it's one that is laborious. This one seemed that it would be easy and I wanted to try it with my new Kitchen Aid mixer. Well, they didn't raise and were doughy inside, and heavy.

I have made my own bread and rolls for close to 40 years. I wanted something quick for thanksgiving before the turkey began roasting. This recipe fit the bill. However I am a traditional yeast bread baker. i.e. "add flour and knead until no longer sticky". But, after reading the reviews I heeded the advise -No kneading, and the dough is sticky, very sticky. I measured 1 and 1/2 times the recipe and I actually had 15 rolls. They were light, chewy, and a wonderful flavor and soooo easy. Did I mention NO kneading. A few rolls on the outsides of the muffin pans were a bit brown, I was fooled by the pale tops. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will modify the temp a smidge, and possible brush the tops with milk or buttermilk. I also wrapped them in foil to warm at a low oven before serving.

I followed the recipe and got very good results.  I used to bake bread on a regular basis but other than a pizza dough I don't handle yeast breads that often. It is often enough to be somewhat skeptical of the wet batter dough, but other reviews assured me this was to be expected.  The were quick, easy and way my sons gobbled them up assured me they were good. They were made for a holiday gathering but I will be making them again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Sorry to buck the trend with this recipe, but can only give it a 3 star. I followed the recipe to a "T".  First it took longer to rise that I had read (although that can vary according to your kitchen environment.  But, most of all, although they did have a yeasty flavor that I personally like, I felt they were kind of bland.  As they say, "nothing to write home about". My husband was nice about it and said they were"good" but I could tell he was no more impressed with them than I.  Next time I will bake my usual even thought it takes longer.

Followed exactly as written, and they were perfect! Actually got 12 instead of 8. We live at 5545' altitude and no adjustments were necessary!  It is very difficult to not eat every one of these rolls as they sit next to me, fresh from the oven...and I can't even describe how amazing the house smells.

How long does it take this to rise?? I have mixed this dough up twice and followed the recipe exactly but my dough is still heavy and not at all wet like the video shows. Can a more experienced roll maker suggest what I might be doing wrong??

Pure perfection! I think these are the best rolls I've ever eaten. Don't make any efforts to change anything. My mother & grandmother were the best baker's I can ever remember. This is a wonderful remembrance to all they taught me. Well worth it and a simple recipe.

You have to look at this as almost a yeast doughnut/muffin.  I made it with 2.1/4 flour and it came perfect.  I used a fork to mix and followed up with a spatula in the bowl before the first rise.  I spooned the batter into the muffin tins and it was perfect.  I did use butter instead of shortening which can make it heavier but the cream factor does give it a richness.  Great easy go to breakfast muffin!!!

This is my favorite recipe for yeast rolls. They're quick and easy enough for a midweek meal, but delicious enough to serve with a holiday meal. My husband requests them with dinner all the time during the colder months. We just love them!

This is the best recipe I have ever used. I can never quite get rolls to work. Even my hubby has teased about the "door stops" I usually make; soft in the middle, if you can crack them open! I've used this recipe twice now and the second time, I made them larger for use as sandwich buns and they came out perfect, just like the first batch of dinner sized rolls. They were so yummy, both hubby and I just ate one plain hot out of the oven. Wonderful recipe ~ Thank you for sharing!

These were so delicious.  I used butter instead of shortening and added about a tablespoon more flour to the dough, as well as sprinkling another table spoon over it before I formed the individual rolls, and it was incredibly easy to work with.  The dough was quick to make, and the rolls were soft and delicious.  We used them as buns for crabcake sandwiches, and then everyone ended up going back for seconds on the bread. This will definitely be my new go-to roll recipe.

Sorry, but I wasn't impressed. Then again... I've never had much luck with baking yeast rolls... that's why I ended up giving it 3 stars, instead of one. This time it could have been the baker's fault. ;)

Followed recipe except dropped large spoonfulls into greased pie plate instead of muffin tins (I don't know why...I guess it just wouldn't feel like a roll in a muffin shape LOL!) Anyway, tasted great! My hubby absolutely adored these...went for seconds & thirds. I look forward to trying different variations...will probably add a little more sugar next time or maybe even honey. This is a keeper!

Very happy with this simple bread. Approx. 2 1/2 hours from start to finish.
I used butter instead of shortening and a cake pan rather than muffin pan. They spread together on cake pan, tasted awesome.
Thank you for recipe!

Love how easy these rolls are to make!  I added 2 extra Tbs of sugar to sweeten them for my kids, but they would still be very good with the amount in the recipe. Will be making these quite often.

This recipe is outstanding ingredient-wise. Perfect proportions! The only changes I would recommend are in the way to cook the rolls. I've made this recipe a few times now and this is how to make it a whole lot easier: instead of cooking them in muffin tins, I double the recipe, mix the ingredients as stated and do the first rise in the mixing bowl; after they double in size, I then punch down the dough with a spatula and glob and scrape the mixture into an oiled 9x13 inch pyrex pan and spread it evenly to the corners (you kind of have to be rough with it, lol). I then place the whole pan in a warm place for the second rise to double in size. After that I bake it at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes until golden brown on top(don't overbake!). When the mass has cooled (in the pan) for maybe 45 minutes, I take a bread knife then gently cut the "rolls" while still in the pan. Then I remove them with a narrow spatula to serve. So easy, no kneading and everyone raves about how good they are!! Thank you for a great recipe :) I give it 10 stars!

Being a novice, this recipe wasn't anywhere near specific enough for me.   Made a couple of boo boo's which I attempted to correct.  Added the egg last by mistake so it was hard to blend into the mixture. Used butter flavored crisco and it didn't melt so I took it out of the bowl and nuked it and then returned it to the bowl. The end result was better than I expected except that the rolls were uneven and bumpy on top - not smooth like the photo.  Also I think they could have been a little browner. I'll try again. Any tips from experienced bakers appreciated.

These were great :) The first time I made them I followed recipe exactly, except I added more flour (I am new to bread making and mistakingly thought this dough should be kneadable). Anyway they turned out smooth and yummy, but a bit dense. After reading reviews I see that I should not have added the extra flour after all. I am excited to do these again :) THANK YOU for such an easy recipe, love it!

I made these to go along with a Pot Roast meal.  They are delicious.  I did change a thing.  They are sticky but I used a large spoon to transfer the batter into the muffin cups.  Thank you to the reviewer(s) who listed times for allowing he yeast to disolve/proof and waiting until it had doubled.  I am a novice and was wonder how  long I had to wait for these steps.  I've seen many yeast rolls recipes but this is the simplistic one that I have found.  Just a few ingredients and a few steps.  I will be using this one from now on as my goto dinner roll recipe.

Outstanding! Follow the recipe exactly. Dough will be loose but don't add flour. That's where most people go wrong because it's not consistency of most bread recipes. My husband loved the bread and that's a blue ribbon winner to me.

I have made this recipe several times and my entire family loves these yeast rolls. I can't imagine anyone having problems making them. Expect them to be sticky however, I use a spoon so I don't make a mess. The only touching I do is one finger to push the mixture off the spoon into the baking pan.

This was as easy as it sounds.  However,no one at the table was impressed.  I like bread of all kinds and this is more like store bought white bread.  I will not make again.

These are definitely sticky but fear not! Made these yesterday and they were so easy, sticky yes but easy. I used butter in place of shortening only because it was all I had. Came out fine. I just sprayed my muffin tin with butter flavor spray and spooned in the batter as evenly as I could and they turned out beautifully. My son wants me to try making these into sandwich roll size for burgers etc. so I thought I might try using a 'muffin top' baking pan to keep the rounded shape. They would make good burger buns! Thanks for the recipe.

Flavor was good, but texture was odd.  Rolls were crumbly, like a biscuit.  Not sure if this is how they are supposed to be or if mine went wrong somehow...

This is a very easy recipe. Anyone who can read can make this. It also taste great. I have made these several times. Once, I did forget they were rising but it didn't hurt them, they came out fluffy and light. Matter of fact, I think they were lighter because of the extra time they were allowed to rise. My family loves them!

Not sure what I did wrong with this recipe, but the bread did not rise very well. I did use the fast rise yeast, maybe I did not wait long enough at 30min-1hr. However, the rolls were very good! My husband commented that he thought they tasted like Schlotsky's (sp?) bread. . . So he REALLY liked the rolls, even though they did not rise very well. Thank you for the recipe!

Yum! These are really good! I followed the recipe and yes, it was a very wet and sticky batter, but I just scooped out the batter and put into muffin pan! I'll be making them again! ??

My daughter made these today for Easter.  Very good !  they were very sticky - she couldnt roll them into balls; just sort of scooped up and put in the muffin cups.   Also - they were perfectly done in 8 minutes not 10.

Made these rolls today ahead of time to see if I liked them to serve for Easter.  These rolls are awesome! and so easy to make.  This recipe is a keeper.  Fluffy, light and delicious.  I did not change a thing, followed directions exactly as shown.  So happy I found these rolls.

Excellent quick rolls! I'm going to try adding some extra flavours and spices next time. They don't taste as good the next day so it's better to eat them fresh from the oven, if possible.

Made these tonight to go along with "hunter stew" - smoked sausge with boiled potatoes in a beef broth.  They were delicious.  I've made rolls using the Pillsbury hot roll mix and these taste so much like them.  I was a bit confused after I viewed the video.  If the dough doesn't have to be kneaded, why turn it out on a floured surface?  Can the dough be spooned directly from the mixing bowl to the muffin tin?  Next time I will try this and see what happens.

My house must be chilly, it took 2.5 hours from start to plate. I am glad I read the reviews/warnings about how sticky this dough is and to give it a chance (you can NOT handle it with your hands it is way too sticky for that, use a spoon sprayed with cooking oil). The only subs I made were using Butter Flavor Crisco and honey instead of sugar. The recipe made 12 rolls for me (for WW followers they were 3 points each) and they were melt in your mouth delicious.

I divided this recipe into 4 "buns" and baked for 13 minutes. Perfect for French Dip sandwiches! Had to add flour for kneading, not mentioned in the recipe.

the result was great. but the dough was very very sticky. it felt like it needed more flour, but i didnt add more than was stated bacause i wanted to follow it exact. i strayed from the directions in that i mixed the dry ingredients first, then added the wet ingredients and used water as hot as possible from the tap.  i didnt use a muffin tin but put them on a baking sheet.they came out as delicious buns. my only complaint is that it was so sticky it was hard to handle the dough.

Easy, easy, easy!  Almost what I was looking for, just not as light textured as I want.  But for no kneading, the taste is there!  Thanks for a really fast, easy and tasty recipe!

I also hate when a recipe gets a low rating when they didn't follow the recipe as written. I followed the recipe exactly, and I didn't have a dough; I had more of a batter. I thought 3 tablespoons of sugar seemed like it would make a very sweet roll, but I did as written.
This is where I was forced off script from the recipe. Once I wound up with a consistency that was unworkable I had to add flour just to get a dough. I liked the rolls, but it was very sweet, especially considering it had an extra cup of flour from the original.
Overall the recipe was okay. I think there is just too much liquid listed and otherwise it would have turned out well especially if you like a sweet dinner roll. Someone else suggested 2/3 cup water. I think that sounds more like the correct ratio.

This was so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out light and airy, I will have to say I could have made 12 rolls with the amount of dough and will next time for sure!!

Just what I like, easy and good!  I allowed 2 hrs. before dinner to make these, and that was perfect.  The texture is so tender, almost cake-like.  And the recipe is so easy, I think I could remember how to make these next time without looking. Thank you, DCASH.

I've made these before and I see my review didn't get through.  Make exactly as the recipe says, they are so nice, perfect!  The dough is supposed to be 'goopy' and I love the different texture when working with it.  The reason we come to Allrecipes is to try new things, not complain they aren't all the same!

I made these rolls tonight and found them to be great as-is but also a great starting point for some creativity.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have the time to allow to rise (only about 30 minutes total) and baked them in a cake pan after cutting into the 8 portions. They took about 16 minutes to bake them this way but they were still light and soft despite the short rise time.  Very easy and a definite keeper recipe!

Very popular! These are the most successful and quick rolls I have tried. I substitute olive oil for the shortening and just use hot tap water so I don't have to wait for the water to cool.  It makes it take less time and still comes out great.  Also, bonus, add some crushed garlic to the water.  They are heavenly garlic rolls!

The first time I made this it was tough.  It was inedible.  I tried it again.  It was definitely batter.   But still a work in progress.  I think unlike a lot of people on here I need to reduce the flour.  The dough seems to be to dry.  I am not sure my mine is coming out so different but it is.   I doubled checked the recipe three times to make sure I was putting correct amount in.  I was so I think that the problem is to much flour.  If anyone else has a possible suggestion I would like to hear it.  I am going to rate it  a threat this time.

Recipe forgot to mention to punch down dough after it rises in the bowl...The video on Yeast Rolls is very helpful...I would reduce the salt by half & only bake 8 mins. the next time...the bottoms were too dark, almost burnt after the full ten minutes...Overall good recipe.

This, like many other roll recipes, is supposed to have a sticky dough! You are supposed to not be able to knead it. I think this is why folks keep adding too much flour. Do it like the recipe says. It never once calls for "kneading the dough." Because you can't. You have to spoon it and such. They are delicious.

These rolls are amazing! So simple yet so satisfying. You're family will love them. I made these last night and we devoured them. I let the, rise for the 1st time for a few hours, covered in plastic wrap. It is a sticky dough...do not add anything else to this recipe, it is exactly as it should be. I scooped it by hand into the muffin tin, messy but effective. To iChat I'm making these again tonight but I have 2 bowls full of bread dough rising on the counter right now. I didn't want to double the recipe and mess it up. :) Enjoy! We did.

As others have already expressed......the dough did take me by surprise, very gooey and sticky.  Nevertheless the outcome was pretty darn awesome!!! My entire family LOVED them. I didn't have shortening so I used vegetable oil, and I brushed butter on top before baking, all other ingredients were used just as recipe calls for.  And yes! They were still wonderful......light, fluffy and golden brown. However, I was a bit rushed therefore my rise time was maybe 30min each time.  I must admit I often work with yeast/dough but this recipe was by far the most easiest with the best results. This recipe is indeed a KEEPER!! I must do these again......Hmmmmm looks like this yeast rolls recipe just made it to my Christmas menu ;-)  Yummmmy!!!

These are awesome! I even messed up making the rolls themselves and they still came out great! This is foolproof. I also had to leave for a few hours so heated up my oven to it's lowest setting of 170 degrees, put the dough in it's bowl in the oven and then turned it off. It was raised beautifully when I got back home. I did not make even mounds for the rolls, they were all different sizes, but they were still delicious. Almost as good as my mom-in-law's, but not quite. I don't think it's possible to beat hers!

Made these for the first time and the family loved them.  Soft, sweet and delicious.  I did not vary the recipe, though I did wind up with 12 rolls versus 8.  Trying to cram all the batter into 8 rolls  would have been too much.  I filled the muffin tins a little over 1/2 way and the dough rose to nearly full before I baked them.

Fabulous recipe, just added 1/2 tsp more salt. Have made it over 5 times in the past 2 weeks for family and friends to rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, let the yeast proof for 10 minutes, let the mixture rise a full 45 minutes in the bowl, covered and in a warm place and another 45 in the pan, also covered and warm, before baking. I buttered the tops for the last 3 minutes of baking. Perfect every time.  Makes your home smell heavenly!

Made these for Thanksgiving. Wish there was a note in the recipe about not adding extra flour.  I made the same mistake as other reviewers and added flour before I realized that it was supposed to be super sticky.

Just made this.  Delicious and perfect.  I used butter but otherwise followed the recipe.  Let it rise 45 min. the first time, 30 mins. the second time and brushed it with butter after scooping dough/batter into tins.  I notice the one's I baked in tin pans were fluffier than the ones I baked in thicker dark pans but have no idea why. Thank you for the recipe.

I made these last night; they didn't taste like yeast rolls.  They were more like corn muffins without that cornbread taste, not yeasty at all.  Not bad, just not what I was looking for at all.  I am going to try again, hope for better results.

I love how easy this recipe is to follow. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and had great results--a nice airy roll with good flavor. Next time, I'm going to throw a little twist in and add some fresh rosemary to the dough before baking. As I'm partial to butter, I'll probably also substitute it for the shortening as well.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner. Easy & delicious! I did use whole wheat pastry flour & butter instead of shortening. I was worried about the very sticky dough & ending up dividing into 9 clumps & baked in a pan. Came out light & fluffy & I did not use extra flour.

I LOVE these rolls!  This was the easiest recipe to follow, and the rolls are light and delicious!  Maybe the people that rated it lower than 5 stars aren't familiar with making yeast rolls?? Anyway, it's suppose to be sticky and gooey, adding flour definately weighs them down and makes them much denser.  This is one recipe that I will definately make on a regular basis! Oh, and the whole family loves them!  They're amazing with fresh honey too!

Easy and good, but I prefer the "Sweet Dinner Rolls" from this site. The other recipe takes a little longer to make, but it's worth it since they have a richer taste and a nicer texture (in my opinion).

The taste was good but the dough was very sticky and hard to work with. I will try to make them again but I will try a few changes.

I have made these rolls countless times and find them so versatile.  They are fabulous exactly as written.  The flour amount is perfect for the light rolls they produce.
After making a number of times as written, I have tried with both shortening and unsalted butter.  I prefer the rolls made with 2 tbsp unsalted butter instead of shortening.
I use these buns as dinner rolls, buns for sandwiches, tuna melts, hamburger as well as hot dog buns. Great with soup and chili.They are delicious and fast to make.
I mix up in the morning, let rise an hour or so, drop  dough on a parchment lined sheet, let rise an other hour or so and they are ready for lunch or to bake for use later in the day. 
I sprinkle a little poppy seed and coarse salt on each bun while they do the second rise.  A nice touch.  When I make for lamb burgers I sprinkle the tops with coarse salt and a bit of dried mint..for chili a little shredded cheese, ....Enjoy

Followed the recipe and these turned out amazing!! The dough was very sticky, which made me nervous, but they were great! Next time I will spread the dough over 12 muffin cups. They rose beautifully in the over and made 8 huge rolls.

I didn't care for this recipe. I followed the recipe and instructions and to me, these rolls just tasted like yeast.  If you are looking for a quick bread recipe, try the quick and easy pizza crust recipe from this site. I've used that one with great success and rave reviews to make focaccia, garlic bread, cheese bread, breadsticks, as well as pizza crust and it doesn't disappoint... ever. Takes less time too. I would skip this one and go straight to the other. It's much closer to a traditional bread, just takes less time.

I tried the rolls and they were edible but not light. I didn't add more flour or knead the dough.  The only thing I think could have been the problem was the temperature of the water. This recipe does not indicate what the temp should be, but I think mine was not warm enough (even though it was lukewarm) and the yeast was not activated properly. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

These are wonderful! I spent my whole day cleaning, and didn't realize that it was almost time for my husband to come home! I threw together some of my no-soak, quick beans, and some bacon chicken with mashed potatoes. The meal didn't seem complete, and I came searching for the perfect roll recipe. Well, I found it! I've already had three, and it's not even dinner time yet!:]

I finally found a light and fluffy roll!  I did add more sugar, (1/2 cup) which I thought made it just sweet enough and also added a little more flour (+1/2 cup) and 2 tsp butter to the mix!  I wish I had time to let it rise, as I think it lacked in apperance, but all and all it was a great yeast roll recipe!

Very tasty, but need to perfect. I used a cupcake pan and using only 8 of the cups, they were way too big. They overflowed and were very difficult to remove form the pan. I did find however, that when they cooled a bit, they became easier to get out. 
They were kind of crunchy on the outside and light and airy throughout with a delightful flavor. I will definitely make them again, just need to adjust the size.

These rolls are so good. This recipe is fast, easy and I used a ice cream scoop to distribute the dough.  Using the scoop creates the perfect size roll. Another hint, it was hot outside today so I put a lid on the bowl, with the dough in it, and sat it on my patio table...took no time to rise. Perfect!

These rolls were amazing. I have never made bread before so i was scared at first, but this came out awesome. The dough is sticky to handle, but as any good cook knows rub flour on your hands so the dough doesn't stick to you when handling it. I actually sprayed my hands with PAM and that worked even better than flour. :)

They were good, just a little plain. And i think my muffin tin must be bigger then the one that DCASH305226 used because they were huge. Would make these again!

Perfect. Substituted butter for shortening. These are amazing. Used the recipe to make pull-apart bread by rolling 1/8 cup portions in butter and cinnamon sugar and then baked at 350 for 25 min. Again, perfection.

I love baking, but have always been intimidated by bread recipes, especially living in a humid climate. I'm also gluten free which makes bread-baking that much trickier. I found this recipe and loved that it was so simple. All the 4 and 5 star reviews sold me on the idea of trying it and I'm so glad that I did. I followed the recipe except I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour and 1/5 tsp of xanthum gum instead of wheat flour. The finished roll was tender and moist and delicious! Thanks for sharing this easy and excellent recipe!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! These were wonderful even though I tried everywhich way to screw these up! 
First, I put the dough to rise in the oven  at "Hold" (170 degrees). I always turn it off after a minute, but this gives me a warm spot to raise dough. Forgot to turn the oven off! Finally realised my mistake and pulled the bowl out after 4-5 minutes.
Second, forgot the egg! I added it when I "punched" the dough down, before filling the muffin tins, along with about 1/4 cup of cornmeal. Mixed it in with the aid of my Kitchen Aid mixer.
Baked according to the recipe and they tasted like sooo much more! 
Next time I make these I will pay closer attention to what I am doing, and not talk on the phone with friends! I don't think they can taste any better...they were that good. (I also will either add more cornmeal or eliminate the 1/4 cup. We couldn't even tell it was included.)

This was a big hit with the family, nice texture and flavor, very quick & easy addition to a meal. Tried following the recipe exactly & with increasing the flour slightly, both ways turned out.

The dough was too wet, hard to manage. Once baked, it was spongy, with the texture of a sponge cake without the flavor.

Perfect, quick and delicious recipe. Mix them together when you start making supper and you will have beautiful, sweet, warm rolls by the time you are ready to eat. This is my go-to recipe for baking buns. Wouldn't change a thing :)

These rolls are soooooo good! Make them just as the recipe says and you won't be dissappointed. The only thing different for me is I get a whole dozen rolls when I make it. This recipe is very quick and easy for yeast rolls. The only hard thing is to not eat the whole pan. My husband, myself, and my 2 year old son eat more than we should when I make these.

Sorry to leave such a low rating. I was thrilled to find something so quick and easy. I followed the recipe exactly.The texture was ok, Not as light as I had hoped but they were still nice. They looked ok and were soooo easy to make but they truly lacked something. I wouldn't make these again and will remove the recipe from my recipe box.. If you put lots of honey butter on them or add something to make them into herbed rolls then they would be ok. Just don't expect these to be anything like Ryans, other restaurants, or most yeast roll recipes. I was disappointed. If you want to make some for guests, I suggest a trial batch before your dinner to find out if they are something you would enjoy.

I never like to give a negative remark to anyone, but I was very disappointed. I followed the recipe to the letter and I don't know what happened but I will definitly have to try another recipe, these had a very bland taste to them. Congrats to everyone who succeeded in using this recipe, I wasn't so lucky.

WOW! These rolls are light and airy and delicious. I made a double batch for dinner for my family of 5 and they were all gone by the end of the night. I didn't change one thing (except to double the recipe) and they turned out perfectly! Will definitely be making this again. Thank you for sharing!

I loved this recipe! I made it to go with my pot roast, and my husband couldn't wait for the roast to finish. He ended up eating half the rolls before dinner!

Instead of making them in a muffin tray I just put them on a baking sheet. Worked out wonderfully.

Good recipe.  Texture is nice and fluffy.  Taste is a little flat.  I think nexst time will add a few other ingredients (herbs, butter, etc).

I followed the recipe, no adjustments. The rolls taste good, but mine turned out more like biscuits than rolls. Since most haven't complained of this, maybe it was something I did... not sure what, however.

Super Easy! I was a bit intimidated about using yeast, but this was simple. I don't think the dough quite doubled before I put it in the pan, but the buns puffed up and baked beautifully, just the same! I followed another review, saying don't mess with ingredients and I didn't. Perfect just the way it is!

These are great!  I have been looking for a yeast roll that is like my great-grandma's and this is very close!  I followed the recipe exactly and the rolls came out so yummy...not dense at all.  Thank you for a great recipe!

These were very good, the whole batch was demolished in a setting!  I did have to add more flour, though, as well, probably close to a cup or so more.  Other than that they were amazing and shall certainly be made again.  Thank you for posting!

Absolutely fantastic!!!  They just came out of the oven and they are light fluffy and golden brown.  SO easy to make too!  I have a 2 year old and a 6 month old and I was easily able to make these while juggling the babies ;)

I'm glad I read one comment where she mentioned something about spooning the "dough" into the muffin tins because it's quite sticky and that made it super easy.

I got 12 rolls out of the recipe and I followed it exactly.  I think I just used a smaller muffin tin than the person who posted the original did.  They are the perfect size so I know this will be my go to roll recipe from now on!

Great recipe! Very Easy to make. They seemed to be a bit bitter than expected so maybe next time ill just add a little bit more sugar and less salt. Another thing is I used self rising flour instead of all purpose, due to past experiences with the all purpose. It never rises nor does it taste as good. You'll always get better results with the self rising.

These were AWESOME! I took another reviewers suggestion and mixed everything in my mixer with the dough hook and then let it rise in the same bowl. I didn't add any additional flour at that point but I did have to add some to break it into  pieces. I baked them in a greased 9X13 pan and they were soft and light and wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

I made these rolls today. Very easy to make. I followed the recipe and didn't change one thing. They came out ok. Very easy to make. I have to give this one 4 stars. I will make again and make a few changes. Overall a good place for first time bakers to start.

These came out wonderful!  I've always had a problem baking with yeast but this recipe was so easy I just had to try it.  I doubled the recipe b/c I was baking for my bread loving family and they all loved it!  Next time I will use butter instead of shortening b/c shortening doesn't have any flavor.  Oh and I followed this recipe word for word.  A must try.

I was reading the reviews before starting this recipe and was getting worried... thankfully I read jen's review also and decided it was worth a shot to try as is first. I am glad I did. they came out great and were gobbled up before the meal that I was making them for was finished.

These were wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitively be making more of these delicious rolls!  My only suggestion is if you do not want to use a muffin pan and you use a regular pan cook them at a lower temperature like 350 degrees or they will burn.  Other than that these were perfect!

These were delicious! They turned out golden, light, and crispy on the bottom, with just a hint of sweetness. I dropped 3 Tablespoon-sized balls of dough into each muffin cup and they puffed up like popovers. I used a 6-cup muffin pan. WAY better than any of my grandmother's rolls!! I used to be neutral towards yeast rolls: now I LOVE them! Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made a couple of times. Really easy using a muffin pan. do take some time like all yeast recipes and make sure you don't kill your yeast. These were requested on thanksgiving by family if that is any indication of how good they are :)

I have made these rolls 6 times. They are the perfect quick yeast roll. My husband and I both love them. I followed the recipe except for 2 Tbs of sugar instead of 3. Yes the dough is sticky but thats how it is supposed to be. I just greased the muffin tins and dropped spoons of the dough in. No handling the dough is needed. The rest as the recipe says. Baked 10 min and had wonderful golden brown rolls. I will use this recipe often. Thank you !

So yummy and quick (for a bread).  My husband requested i make these more often.  They are a little sweet, SO yummy with a little butter.   The dough is sticky but its not a problem.  Just continue as directed.  I used butter b/c i didn't have shortening and they were still awesome.

It tastes good so i couldnt really give it too many stars off. But it took me 2 times to make this recipe.  First of all there is NO KNEADING! Just stir, let it rise, spoon into the muffin tins, let rise, and into the oven.  Which begs the question, is it bread if ur not kneading it? With a little more sugar it'd pretty much be a yeast risen sponge cake. The crumb is lighter than a muffin!   I dont know if it can really be called a roll, so im only giving it 3 stars. Not enough texture.

I made these for my family this evening and they were a huge success! I was a little nervous about how wet the dough was as well as the fact there was no kneading but I trusted the other reviews and didn't tamper with it. The end result was amazing! I did not have any sugar so I did sub an equal amount of honey which worked out just fine Thanks for this recipe...I'm sure it will be showing up on our dinner table again and again!

These were good but it didn't say anything about kneading and rolling into balls (which balls were mentioned in one of the reviews). The dough was very sticky so all I could do was drop the dough into the muffin pans. They were tasty but do not look like the picture (all round and perfect). I may try again but will add flour to roll into balls next time. Will lessen the sugar a little too cause they were sweet.

This was the best quick bun recipe I have ever tried.  I honestly thought it was too easy to turn out any good, but I was wrong.  DO NOT add extra flour.  I know it doesn't look right, but it is.  The dough looks way to sticky, but it is correct.  I had a bit of difficulty getting the dough into the muffin pans evenly, but once I got it all in I was able to distribute it out.  This makes only 8 buns, but was quick enough to whip up in time for supper.  I will definately make these again.  Great Recipe!

This was my first attempt at making homemade yeast rolls. I found the recipe very simple and quick, however the rolls were a little bland. I even added a bit of honey after the first rising as was recommened by one reviewer. Overall the rolls were great in texture and rose beautifully, just needs something more in the way of flavor. Maybe next time i'll try adding molasses or beer instead of water as another reviewer suggested.

Delicous and easy dinner rolls! Followed the recipe exactly and the dough is sticky but it's not like you have to knead it, so it really doesn't matter. They were very easy to get into the muffin cups without any additional flour. Just follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed!

AMAZING! you usually get easy or delicious homemade taste when it comes to yeast breads and these were surprisingly both! the important thing to remember is that they are closer to a batter bread so the dough will be sticky just spoon it into the muffin cups -if you insist on adding more flour, add a little more sugar in the beginning and salt make sure you let it rise properly or you will end up with dense rolls -obviously

Very easy, I just started about an hour and a half before I wanted them to be done to ensure enough time for the dough to rise.  My husband said they were just like the ones his grandmother made growing up.   This recipe is a keeper and I plan to make these rolls again and again!

Yummy and easy!  I am NOT good with bread, but thought this sounded like something I could do.  I read the reviews, and I did not change the recipe at all.  It is a lot soupier than most bread dough.  Looks more like a muffin batter.  BUT, if you trust in the recipe you get moist yummy rolls!  My family loves them!

Okay, so I've made these things several dozen times now, and they have turned out excellent every. single. time. It is such a consistent, easy recipe!

Ignore reviews saying the dough is too sticky, and to add flour. Yes, the dough is sticky, and it's supposed to be -- adding flour only increases the density.

I do usually use butter rather than shortening because it's usually what I have on hand, and it doesn't seem to affect anything one way or the other.

These are always a hit with company, and this is a recipe that will stay on rotation!

I followed the recipe and I got muffin-y rolls. I thought it was way too liquidy but figured I would follow the recipe to the T. I will give it a try again. BUT I did follow the recipe exactly and was not super happy with my burnt muffin rolls.

I've never made rolls before or even used yeast, but this recipe was so easy it didn't matter. I followed the recipe exactly and used no extra flour and they just melted in your mouth! They were devoured only a minute out of the oven - we ate them with butter and raspberry jam - these rolls are almost biscuit like and would make a good breakfast as well as a side to soup or stew - I will definately be making these again (Actually - my husband just pointed to the kitchen and told me to go make more! lol)

Made these for dinner tonight, LOVE that they are SO easy and quick.  I made 2 batches, one exactly to recipe, were very soft, but a little chewy to me, 2nd batch added about 1/2 cup extra flour, still very soft and had a nice crust to them, more bread like then fluffy roll like though.  I am inexperienced with yeast, so I think the chewiness was due to something I may have done wrong, but still great recipe and will definately make again. Finally a bread product I made that isn't crumbly and can't be used as a deadly weapon!!!!! (all my past efforts turned out that way LOL)

Even for rolls that need a little rising time, this is a good and relatively fast recipe. Tasty!  I make mine in the really tiny muffin pans and freeze `em for future use.

I was less than impressed.  The dough was SO sticky and entirely unmanageable.  The rolls stuck to the bottom of the muffin cups, and as a result, I lost about 1/3 of each roll.  The taste was still good - the part of roll that was salvaged was light and fluffy.  I'm undecided if I would try these again.

Loved this recipe! I used half wheat flour and half white and a little extra water to proof the yeast with a pinch of sugar. Warning -- I had to SPOON the dough into the muffin cups! If you make bread a lot, you'll worry that this recipe needs more flour -- and it doesn't! Just spoon it in... it will be delicious and set up perfectly. My husband's comment on these rolls -- "If you want me to stay on my diet, don't make these anymore! :) This recipe makes a simple soup supper seem spectacular.

I make these when I decide at the last minute that I want to have fresh bread at dinner, and they never disappoint! I use butter instead of shortening and, like another reviewer said, use two spoons to help get them into the muffin tins. My kids and husband devour them!

I made two different times.It is true,  dough is soggy.The first time I had to add more flour and kneaded(didn't realize you don't have to). They were beautiful but tasteless and heavier. The second time the dough was soft but did not have to add extra flour(and did not knead). The finished product was more like a muffin.Although the rolls turned out like picture, they were bland.I did not like.

The recipe was a breeze to make.  I am trying to get more fiber into my family's diet so I used half All Purpose and half whole wheat flour.  I liked making rolls from scratch and I will play around with this recipe some more to fit our tastes.

These were very good.  I did everything the same except margarine instead of shortening because we don't have shortening where we live.  After you mix in the flour, it really looks like it needs more.  Don't add any.  It doesn't need it.  Just spoon the dough into the muffin tins and it comes out wonderfully light and fluffy.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Very Very Very good :) I have never made yeast rolls before, and so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy these were to make. I didn't pre-heat my oven first thing as the directions say---it took nearly an hour for my dough to double in size. (don't know if that's normal) I did however followed the rest of the ingredients proportions exactly--didn't make any alterations--I did use my KitchenAid with the dough hook to mix the ingredients as one of the other ladies did.

I measured accurately, but made six instead of eight.  These came out wonderfully!  I will make again. No fuss, no kneading, but a delicious yeast roll taste.

These were great and very simple to make. I divided the dough into 12 muffin cups using a sharp knife to cut the ball of dough into 12 roughly equal pieces. It took awhile to rise, but that could have been my yeast; next time I will let the dough rise in the oven with light on.

I've now used this recipe several times and have loved it each time. I just use a spoon to do the drop biscuits but this past time I got very creative. To one batch I added brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon. To another batch I added turkey pepperoni, basil and mozzarella cheese. And of course I did the regular recipe, all were great hits. Just get creative with it. Add what you think you or your friends and family will like and remember make a ton and freeze some to pull out when you have people coming over for dinner, its an easy way to impress on a week night:)

This was a very easy. I made it just like it said. I thought it needed more flour in the beginning because it is sticky, but I did not add any additional and it came out really light and fluffy. Next time I will have to triple it because everyone loved it.

I like the ease of this recipe, and didn't mind so much that they look more like biscuits than rolls.  But I don't think they had a lot of flavor.  More salt would be a starter.  I actually salted one cooked roll after buttering it, and that alone made it better.

These roll are awsome, family loved them.I was wanting something special for christmas dinner this past christmas but was a afraid to serve them with out trying it out first so I made some the day before on just a baking pan, turned out great, other than that I followed the  recipe to the T. The next day I made a tripple recipe and my family and friends were amazed. This time I used muffin pans.

I agree with another person, don't change a recipe then give it less than 5 stars.    This recipe is awesome, they turned out GREAT.  The batter is very sticky, but resist the urge to add flour, and you will be rewarded with light fluffy rolls.

Oh my goodness!!!  I tried these and they were delicious!  My only problem was the stickiness of the dough.  Next time I make them I'll use a large cookie scoop to plop them into the greased muffin tin.  AND DOUBLE the recipe because they are so darn good!!!

Excellent texture and very simple to make. These are my new go-to rolls. I love them.   One caution: the recipe is very bland as-is. I use 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and the rolls come out perfectly. They are not salty at all even with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt.

The taste of these is great, but I've made these twice so far and they keep coming out dense and heavy...definitely not light and airy light some of the pictures.  What am I doing wrong?  I don't have a bread maker so I've been kneading by hand like I do all breads I make.  My yeast seems to be proofing okay too.  Someone help me out.  Whats the trick to a light and airy roll???

These are yummy! I wouldn't recommend doing what I did though, haha. I doubled the recipe thinking I'd just make 12 big rolls instead of 8 smaller ones. My first mistake was that I originally forgot to mix in TWO packs of yeast and had to add the 2nd one once the eggs were already mixed in... so my dough didn't rise very well. And then I had to bake them a lot longer b/c they were so big. Still tasty, that's for sure... but next time I'll just stick to the recipe.

I tried this recipe without doing anything different, besides the fact i used bread flour instead of all purpose. Anyways, the dough is way to sticky to do anything with! Thats why i only gave it 4 stars. Once i did add more flour, about 1 cup more, it was perfect. We made them for Thanksgiving and everyone, including my picking dad, LOVED them. They were slightly flacky and prefectly sweet. Basically, they were a hit!

These are pretty delicious although I prefer something slightly sweeter and dryer. I am glad I read the reviews before making these. The dough is super sticky so make sure you use a spoon to get it into muffin cups. I didn't touch the dough with my hands at all, just used a big spoon the whole time and it worked out great.

Let me add my endorsement of this recipe.  I've had some difficulty in the past with yeast rolls/breads but was able to make this recipe quite easily.  I substituted half the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour (without adding additional flour) and they do rise significantly during baking so be sure and leave a little extra room in the muffin cup or it will overflow.  The dough is very sticky so use a spoon to put it in the muffin cups, as opposed to trying to divide it like you would a drier dough.  Finally, using this recipe I made 6, as opposed to 8, so I baked them for 14 minutes.

This is a very good 'fast' hot rolls recipe.  I DID work in about 1/4 cup extra flour to make it easier to handle but this is a batter-type roll recipe..that's why it rises so fast.  It's not intended to make a loaf of bread.  I made mine in an oblong pan with sides touching, otherwise it was as the recipe recommended.

I really like this recipe, the  dough will be very sticky and hard to work w/ but DO NOT add more flour and  they will turn out moist and fluffy! I did brush them with milk prior to baking and again w/ (sugar & butter ) mixture 5 min prior to being done.They were super good!

Turned out wonderful.  I've been looking for a yeast roll that still tastes good after it's cooled; most of them are great right out of the oven, but become dry or heavy after sitting for a few hours.  This one held up very nicely.  Very light and spongy.  The only difference I made was to use melted butter instead of shortening.

Made these for dinner last night. The texture was light and fluffy, just how you would want a dinner roll to turn out. I will practice this recipe a bit more, since I am not that good with breads. I found this dough SUPER sticky, added much more flour than the recipe required... that is the cooks fault though :) All of my dinner guests said the flavor was great. Next time will add more sugar because I like my dinner rolls a bite sweeter.

These rolls are so easy to make and my family loves them! I add only a wee bit of extra sugar since we like them a bit sweeter. I have made them 5 or 6 times and this recipe works every time!

i made this recipe exactly as it was written, ingredients wise. they were DELICIOUS! LIGHT, FLUFFY AND SWEET. the only difference is that i divided them(with two floured spoons, because the dough is impossible to handle otherwise) and put eight rolls into a pie dish and cooked for about five minutes longer. they turned out like the pull-apart rolls. i cannot rave enough about these! they were not as much work as other reviewers have insisted they are. you just have to decide you are making them a good hour before dinner. that is all.

These are fantastic, I make them in the kitchenaid and let them rise in the bowl as another revewier suggested. I use a cookie scooper to transfer the batter into the muffin tin. Do not alter this recipe and you will be happy with the results.

i made these and followed the recipe exactly. they were good but i felt it needed more salt and maybe more sugar. were a tad bland but that may be more of a personal thing. i have used a recipe somewhat like this before but you just stored the batter in the refrigerator in a bowl and could use it over a period of 5-7 days. it produced a more dense roll probably due to the lack of double rising.  this recipe is good and thanks for a quickie bread for supper.

They failed miserably as bread rolls for me (they were too dense), but they worked beautifully as pizza dough and made awesome breadsticks.  I can't blame the recipe as I'm fairly new to breadmaking, so I'm sure I did something wrong.  Despite my mistakes, however, I thought they had a really good, yeasty taste and now I feel like a real bona-fide cook!

I was making a nice pot roast dinner and wanted some quick rolls so I made these and they were great!  Very easy, too.  I didn't have shortening so I used butter; didn't have a muffin tin so I dropped them into an 8X8 cake pan.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  And yes, they were very sticky, but I wanted to know if they would work that way and they did.  They were yeasty and yummy!  I will definitely make these again!

Good recipe...but I wouldn't say that it was anything extraordinary. The dough was indeed very sticky...more like a batter than dough.

I whipped these up as a last minute addition to a large sunday dinner.  They were really good!!  I like my rolls a bit smoother in texture, but these really hit the spot and were a huge hit.  I might have baked them a little too long - hence the texture issues.  Will definitely make these again though!!

This recipe was the best I have ever used. I used the bread machine to make the dough, then kneaded and shaped and let rise the second time. My family loved them. Easy and simple, with great yeast taste, and very fluffy.

Only a master poet could describe in words how good these taste. Right out of the oven they have a texture comparable to cotton-candy, but not too sweet in flavor.  Instead of using butter I painted them with ghee right out of the oven.  That gave them a nice flavor.  Considdering all the sugar and saturated fat this is a "once in a while" food, but totally worth it.

These were great. I ate them way to fast upon pulling them out of the oven they were so good. It was my first ever try at yeast rolls and they came out perfect and fluffy. I followed almost every thing to a T, even when it came out super sticky. I only added an extra bit of sugar because I like my rolls sweet, and I am not a big fan of yeast flavor. They were good but...too sweet, not by much :) All my fault, I'm going to make them again tonight exactly as it states to go with my Buffalo Chicken Soup. Sweet and spicy can't wait to try.

Excellent quick rolls.  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved them.  The only thing I will do differently next time is instead of using 8 of the muffin cups, I'm going to try dividing it up between all 12.  The rose so much that they almost went over the side of the pan.

This was wonderful, quick and easy!  I made this for 24 servings and I got 2 dozen muffins and 2 loaves of bread.  I used a cookie scoop and put 3 small scoops in each muffin tin.  The bread made great buttered toast.

A great, quick, minimal effort recipe for very light rolls.  I made these Easter morning while baking several other things, and the no-kneading-needed recipe was much better than the regular knead-rise-and-knead-again ones that I have made most recently.  So easy and very delicious.

I needed something relatively quick for an emergency batch of cinnamon rolls and tried this recipe. I ended up using quite a bit more flour to make them just not-sticky enough to roll out. I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly suprised! Even with the extra flour and handling, they were still actually the lightest and fluffiest cinnamon rolls I've ever made. I'm definitely impressed and so was my family!

These rolls were quick to make and delicious. The only thing I wrong to me was the quantity. I wanted 40 rolls, so I changed the quantity. I ended up with 5 dozen rolls, a loaf of cheese bread, and a fruit stollen. All were very delicious and came in time for the blackout from the winter storm. I will definitely be making this recipe again, as you can make anything from it.

I have to say that these are my backup plan rolls for many many meals.  When I have forgotten to make a bread to accompany mealtime, these always come through.  I sometimes make them smaller and can get 12 out of a batch.

This is my first attempt at bread and it went quite well.  They turned out great and tasted like the canned bread!

Great rolls, loves the small recipe size.  Of course the stickier you can manage to leave the dough, the lighter they will rise up.  The next time I make them I'm going to add a ton more salt, but I think that's just our families thing.

This is a super easy and super good recipe! I made one and a half of the recipe and since that made the need for two eggs I added a quarter cup more flour. They are so light and airy. I had no problems with the recipe as written. A real keeper! Thanks to the Great Grandmother of the person who originally submitted the recipe.

Very good recipe! Easy to make, pretty straightforward. The rolls came out soft and fluffy just the way I like them! My only suggestion would be to add a bit more sugar, but that's just me since I like my rolls a bit sweet. I strongly recommend this recipe!

DON'T CHANGE A THING. YES THE DOUGH IS ULTRA STICKY. HOWEVER,IF YOU SPOON THE DOUGH INTO A REGULAR LIGHITLY SPRAYED MUFFIN PAN YOU HAVE TO DO NOTHING ELSE. I FOLLOWED EVERYTHING TO THE LETTER AND THEY WERE DEVOURED BY MY FAMILY. A++ AND BRAVO TO THE CONTRIBUTOR.

Quick yeast rolls are excellent for beginners in this medium.  This recipe really plased my 90 year old mother, and for that I am pleased.  Without having the extensive experience with yeast dough, I felt this gave me a very acceptable product in a reasonable amount of time and with little effort.

This recipe was so simple and quick.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't like baked goods with shortening in them so much. But I'm sure you could substitute margarine for the shortening. I loved this recipe because even in my cold house, the dough rose really quickly. It was rather sticky, but adding a spoonfull of flour helps with that, and then you just spoon it into muffin tins.

I use to make yeast rolls a lot but quit making them because of arthritis. The kneading was not easy for me.
This is a great recipe. Just made some and they are delicious.

The rolls (muffins in this case) on their own weren't bad and everyone liked them well enough (I made them for Thanksgiving dinner), I didn't care for the texture or the appearance though and they just weren't like yeast rolls as I know them.  I made the recipe as is - maybe I didn't let them rise long enough?  (45 minutes before transferring to muffin tins and 30 minutes once in the tins before the oven).  I will probably try the recipe one more time with adjustments from other reviews.

I realized very late in the afternoon that I did not have rolls to go with my lasagna for my husbands birhtday dinner so I came to AR to find one.  At first this seemed pretty easy to put together and I had all the supplies on hand.  I did loose faith in the rolls when I tried to put them in the muffin pan. So I came back to read more reviews that confirmed my batter was the right consistancy and that, hopefully, all would end well.  AND IT DID!!!  These were very good and rose up very wonderfully in the tins.  I would make these again and again!!!!

Very easy..followed directions and they came out great.  They are a bit sticky, but that didn't seem  to phase the end product.  The only problem I had was after 8 minutes they were defintely done.  But, that could have been my oven.  Will make again often.

Great recipe :).  They're best when served hot, but they were delicious after a few days too!  I added a little bit of honey to the water/shortening to make them a little bit sweeter and I also substituted 1/4 cup of the flour with dry oatmeal (I was in an experimenting mood).  Also, before cooking them, I brushed each roll with melted honey/butter and topped half of them with crushed pecans.  They turned out great and I ended up with 24 fairly large rolls (I doubled the recipe).  At least half of them were gone before dinner was even served, so I'll definitely make these again, with or without my personal touches :).

Just tried this recipe today.  Outstanding.  Would change a couple of things though.  First, would add a little more sugar-rolls were great but not sweet enough for me.  Also added slightly more flour so dough was not as sticky.  Rolls came out light and flavorful.  As pull apart rolls in a pan they were excellent.

This was the first time trying to make any kind of bread and it turned out great! They were a little heavier than I had thought but I think it was because I added a little extra flour. Overall excellent rolls!(update) made them again! YUM, came out perfectly this time, fluffy this time, I guess I overworked the dough last time. Love it!

Don't be scared of the sticky dough--these rolls are GREAT.  Took the advice of another reviewer and used an ice-cream scoop (sprayed with cooking spray) to plop the dough into the muffin tins... that worked well.  I would make these every night if I could!

Followed this recipe, as is and it turned out great.  The family really enjoyed them, the dough was sticky as everyone has said, but I just used a ice cream scoop that I sprayed first with, a little pam.  No issues after that, good overall recipe.

These went so quick!  The only thing that I changed was the shortening...I don't ever use that, so I replaced it with butter.  I rated it as a 4 instead of a 5 just because of the stickiness when I was trying to make them, I kept adding a little more flour but as hard as it was to form them, they still came out perfect!!  (I used a pie plate instead and gently made them touch, they pulled apart just great!)

These are pretty good.  I've made them a few times now and they always turn out fairly well.  I never put mine in muffin cups, I just dump spoonfuls of the dough onto the pan and they turn out just fine.  I don't know why everyone's so uptight about the dough being sticky, since you don't have to knead it at all.  The recipe is good as-is.

These are the best rolls I've ever made, and I know it has everything to do with the recipe. I loved that there was no kneading involved as that is my least favorite part of bread making. I only changed one small thing. I added a 1/4 c extra flour to make it easier to handle. I'll definitely by using this recipe again!!

This was quick & easy but not the best rolls I've made.  The flavor & texture was a little different than I was hoping for.  But from start to hot rolls was only about an hour so I'd make them again if I were in a hurry.  As mentioned in other reviews, the dough was quite sticky so I used a 1/4 cup ice cream scoop to scoop the dough into the muffin tins.  It was very easy and cut out a lot of mess!

Wonderful rolls from this recipe.  As others have said, the dough was sticky to handle so I added enough flour from a shaker to my hands, countertop, and ball of dough to make it manageable.  I got 16 rolls using a 9" x 9" buttered baking dish.

These were alright if you are looking for something quick. The dough was very sticky and somewhat hard to work with. Probably won't make again.

This recipe is awesome!  I have used the same "family hand-me down" recipe for years and thought that they never tasted just right, and it took hours and hours to make.  These rolls were soooo easy and simple, and light and fluffy! Still takes a little time for the yeast to rise, but to be expected. I tripled the recipe and put them in a pan for pull-apart rolls.  Excellent, excellent!

Thought these were very good for the effort involved.  They need a little more flavor, not sure how to fix that.  They were very sticky, might decrease water by 1/4, or add a little more flour.  Plan to experiment and try garlic knots, some butter and garlic and tie into knots.  I will baste with more butter and garlic.  Will let you know results

These rolls weren't bad, they weren't great either. Mine had a hard dark skin on the outside, that was probably because I cooked for five minutes on the bottom rack, and five minutes on the middle rack. They were sort of a mix between a muffin, biscuit, and cake.

Made these because I needed a quick roll to go with supper, but my kids and husband ate them better the next day for a snack.  Update:  My bread flopped so went to this go-to recipe!  Thought I would half it, but realized part way through that it is difficult to half an egg!  So just added the whole egg!  They turned out great, fluffier and less yeasty tasting!  Next time will make the original recipe with 2 eggs.

These were just okay to me. Too much like a buiscuit in texture, not the yeast rolls I am looking for.

Very nice.  The recipe easily made 12 rolls, as others have noted.  They were super easy too.  I think next time I will try adding a little bit of honey.  The flavor wasn't quite what I was hoping for.

Yes, they were quick and easy, but something was off about the texture. Taste was ok. I won't be repeating this...

I loved this recipe! I usually make bread every thanksgiving and this year I may have found the best recipe yet. I did have one batch that did not rise very well but it still turned out pretty good.

Excellent recipe! These are super easy so anyone can make them. Other reviews state disappointment, but these are exactly what they say.....QUICK! They do not taste like rolls that have taken all day to make, but are still wonderful, light, fluffy and a great addition to any meal. I will definetly use this recipe again.

Have used a lot of recipes on this site but this is my first review, the rolls turned out like the pix, sticky like it says but worth the try I used a muffin pan and the pie plate as one of you did just to see. Muffins better. I really love this site, thanks to all for your recipes.

OMG these were so good.   My muffin tins must be a bit smaller because when I made 8 they were huge.

Saving this for future use.   Loved them.
