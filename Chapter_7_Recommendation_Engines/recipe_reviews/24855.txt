overall, this is a very good pie with a nice taste.  the time for baking is much longer than 30 mins at 325 however.  Every time I have baked this it was at least 50 mins.  Because of this amount of time in the oven, you may want to put aluminum foil around the edge of the pie to prevent the crust from becoming too brown.

The way you make the design is you just use a second pie crust and use the dough.. Just roll it out and use cookie cutters to cut out your designs.. place them on top and wala!!! :-)

This pie has become a family favorite.  I just love all the spices.. they give it so much flavor!  I have found that you need to cut back on the cloves though because otherwise they tend to overpower everything else.

I have been making this pie for over a year now! It was kind of a spoof idea last year to try something new. I'd never made pie before so it seemed like a good starter recipe. I probably made two every week till couldn't find pumpkin anymore!! I LOVE it. Everyone at work loves it, my mom's beau wants it all the time, and I'm going to make a whole bunch to give to co-workers for Thanksgiving this year. A tip- use a DEEP DISH pie crust. If you use a regular pie crust, you WILL have left over filling! I double it up and it fills 3 frozen regular pie crusts or 2 deep dish. It is actually easier to make 2 at a time since pumpkin puree comes in 30oz cans. I don't know where you guys are getting that there is too much salt... Are you not stirring the spices in a separate bowl first? Some day I will try this in a stoneware pie dish! :)

This was a big hit with my spice-loving family at our Christmas dinner.  My modifications were to make it with butternut squash and to add 1+ Tbsp. of fresh lemon juice, with gives pumpkin/squash pies a brightness.  Love this recipe and will definitely make it again and again.

This was an OK recipe.  I think it has too much salt because thats all I could taste in this pie. So maybe cut the salt to a 1/2 tsp?  I like spicy pies, so I thought this one would do the trick.  I will probably not use this recipe again.

I just tried my first (I made them in tart form) and it could use a little bit more sugar. I added 2 tsp more cinnamon and only used 1/2 the cloves and glad I read the review about the cloves being overpowering!

It was ok, probably human error but mine seemed a little grainy to me. And though I didn't mind the spices, I prefer regular ole pumpkin pie. And I put some of the leaves on top, but I definitely needed more. It looked kinda silly, so in this case, more is more! Good recipe though!

Yes! I agree with many others that this pie reminds them of what mom/grandma used to make. I thought Mama made the absolute best lemon pies - ones that taste like lemon with some sugar rather than sugar with some lemon. The balance is perfect. Thank you.

Way too much cloves and I only used 1/2 of what was recommended. Our lips were numb and the heartburn was intense. However, if you like cloves, you'll love the pie. It did also have the perfect consistancy, just way too much spice for my husband and I.

WOW!! my family ate the whole pie in under 20mins! i didn't get but a taste! Yes, it's strong on spice, but the label said so.. and my family prefers it that way!  It took 1hour 15minutes to be completely cooked which is a bit more than originally stated, but that could also be the type of oven.  100% incredible recipe! Thank you sooo much for sharing this

Don't make this pie!! We could not eat it at our Thanksgiving. It is so SALTY. It has now become the family joke "Hey, would you make your SALT pie for my birthday?" Besides, we like spicy, but this is TOO spicy. Cut back on the cloves and the salt and it may turn out fine. To be safe I would make another one of the great pie recipes on this site!

I see someone else remarked on the saltiness, and I agree.  We could not eat it, the salt ruined it.  I will try it again because I think it would be quite good once the salt is cut WAYYYYYY back.

Perfect! Best I have ever made.  I used fresh pumpkin I had frozen. When I measured it I had about 1/3 cup extra and went ahead and dumped it in..still came out perfect. Ohhh. I only used 1/2 tsp. of cloves, dear husband is not a big fan....but it was perfect.

Every time I have baked this it was at least 40 - 50 mins. So put aluminum foil around the edge of the pie to prevent the crust from becoming too brown.  Also I didn't have allspice so I left it out and couldn't tell.  I usually add 3 eggs.

Kathy, I can't say enough thanks you's for posting this wonderful pie recipe! I loved the spice in this. I only used half of the clove called for since my husband doesn't like clove and other reviewers said it was a bit much. We loved this pie. This is soooo much better than our usual recipe, this will be on our holiday table for Christmas too! My husband LOVED this pie and he doesn't usually won't touch anything that clove even thought about being in, much less being strong like it is in this recipe. I even cut the clove in half and my husband still loved this pie! This turned out so creamy and had a lovely smooth texture and great spicy kick to it!!! LOVED IT!

This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted! I made it exactly like the recipe. The only difference is that I did use fresh pumpkins rather than canned.

I've made this pie over and over and we adore it.  My boyfriend won't even eat a store bought pumpkin pie anymore.  We've made this with canned and fresh pumpkin.  A MILLION times better with fresh.

I do reduce the salt.  Everything else is exactly the same.

I've been looking for a spicy pumpkin pie recipe since Mrs. Smith stopped making them. This one fits the bill. Followed the recipe exactly and loved it. Had filling left over and made about 6 mini muffin-pies with the rest. Baking time was 15 minutes longer for my oven.

This recipe was enough for 3 frozen pie shells.  Luckily I had an extra pack in the freezer.  I used McCormick's pumpkin pie spice and used the recommended amount on the container and it was very mild in flavor.  Think I will try the individual spices next time.

The texture and appearance were great, but I guess I like my pumpkin pie a bit sweeter. The spices gave it a bite instead of a blended flavor to me. My husband liked it, so I guess it's a matter of taste. I know I was looking for that traditional pumpkin pie flavor.

I think it turned out nicely. I noticed, however, that the bottom crust didn't seem to cook well... maybe it was slightly soggy? And it definitely took longer to bake... waaayyyy longer in a new stove even. I made it the night before, anyway, so a lengthy bake didn't matter much.

Wonderful! I doubled the recipe as this is my husband's favorite. Only thing I changed was using half brown sugar to half granulated as I had seen this on the Food Network. We loved the spiciness.

I did not care for this pie.  All you could taste in it were the cloves, and I even took others suggestions and cut them back a bit.  It needs more of all the other ingredients.  It also took me almost 2 hours to cook, I dont know why.  I do not recommend it to anyone.

This pie was both easy to make and wonderful to eat! I left it slightly to long and the top browned a lot, but it was still good!!!! It was gone in about 2 minutes when I took it to my office! Thanks!
