This dish was very well liked by the whole family. And Yes the kids do love it. I used all fresh vegetables and seasoned the pieces of chicken so the prep time was longer than stated. Well worth the work. I used less oil as I was using a not stick pan and I used a little less ginger than the recipe called for, knowing my family is not fond of it, but added it to my own portion since I love it.

YES YES YES, full of flavor an easy to make. There is more then one step but still easy. I steamed my veggies, except the pepper and onion, I did those as posted. Steaming made one less step and still had so much flavor. I made this as posted  adding  steaming and a little extra ginger and garlic, we are in love. So much flavor so much taste. Making this again isn't the question, the question is when can I make this again. I used red cabbage, golden beets, carrots, and corn fresh from the cob.

In today's world where we buy and prepare the protein (chicken, pork, beef, etc) in bulk at one time to be efficient, this meal was quick, easy to follow and infinitely better for our family than take out. Particularly on the wallet.

I made this last night without the chicken. I used chopped Brussels sprouts, squish, and zucchini along with the red pepper. I also scrambled an egg in butter before adding the rice. The recipe only calls for 2 Tbs of reduced Sodium soy sauce; I added at least twice that.

This turned out really well.  But I had to cook the vegetables and chicken much longer than the directions.  For instance the carrots/broccoli, etc. I had took cook about 20-25 minutes to get them to the point we like them.  I did not have some of the veggies it calls for, so I used what I had on hand - peppers, onion, snap peas, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower.  And then added some frozen peas and corn (because I love those veggies).  Such a good flavor!  Added a tad more soy sauce too.

The recipe is well-written, easy to follow, and quick to put together. We used six cups of Birdseye's stir fry vegetable mix (a bag and a half of the 14.4oz packages), which was easier and faster than chopping the veggies suggested in the recipe. The dish was tasty, but not better than recipes we use that call for day-old rice.

Followed directions but added suggestions of other reviewers: more of each of these--ginger, minced garlic, and low sodium soy sauce. Served a doubled recipe for 8 and asked the guests compare this recipe with a good similar Japanese veggie-chicken fried rice (commercial). Hand down, this was a winner by wide margin.

Lots of veggies for the amount of chicken but you honestly don't miss the meat with all that's going on.  Great balance of tastes, not too salty.

Didn't have green onion, carrots or sesame oil.  Subbed frozen peas and Tyson pre-cooked chicken (partially cooked in microwave in advance).    Used powdered ginger instead of fresh.

Will definitely make it again!

Yesterday was the first time I tried this recipe.  I eliminated the salt, it wasn't even missed.  When I make it again, and I will, I'll try to cut back on the oil a bit.    It was full of flavor and wonderful.  It is a bit labor intensive but well worth the time.  My husband gave it a thumbs up, too.

Delicious! I added 3 c cooked rice and upped the soy sauce. Also added about 3/4 lb. chicken.  Used as a main dish. Brother loved it, Mom too. Will make again for my husband.

No, and I wouldn't.  The ginger/garlic should have been cooked more thoroughly prior to adding  rice, and more  soy sauce would have made it more flavorful

Great recipe.  We're on a health kick so I substituted scrambled eggs and marinated tofu for the chicken and used even more brown rice.  It's a meal not a side dish.

I always put an egg in and mix it into the rice when almost done. That gives you vegetable fried rice with a protein if you don't  have chicken. Serve with duck sauce.

This dish was very good and so easy as long as you prep it.  I doubled up on the cabbage as well as adding the sugar snap peas, carrots, zucchini, pepper, onion and broccoli.  I also threw an egg in with the rice.  While I was concerned about the one single chicken breast, you don't miss the meat at all.   For those trying without sesame oil, don't. That is critical to the flavor.  I would consider adding some thai basil and chilis to bring the heat and flavor up a notch in the future.  Overall, this is a fantastic way to up your veggie intake.

This recipe was really good. The ginger, garlic, and onion really gave it a lot of flavor. I was able to use some fresh vegetables and some left-over steamed vegetables in the recipe, and it worked well. I changed the order of some of the additions since some vegetables just needed to be heated through and not cooked. I loved that the recipe was heavier on vegetables than on rice. I also used more chicken than listed in the recipe in order to increase the protein in the dish.

Very yummy! Used kale instead of cabbage cause that's what we had. Perfect fried rice! Just make sure to let the rice get pretty crispy before you add in the vegetables.

This is my first time making fried rice at home, and the first recipe I found on All Recipes for fried rice.  Cooked as recipe provides (minus cabbage and zucchini), adding scrambled egg (2), and using two Uncle Ben’s boil-in-bag pouches.  This filled my wok nearly full.  This turned out excellent.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.  I’ll definitely be making more of this...soon.  Dave C.

This was very good and gets less stars primarily because it needed more seasoning. It is NOT traditional fried rice; the vegetable-rice proportions aren’t right for that.  But I knew that.  As written, it also has very little protein so for my household wasn’t really suitable as a main dish.  I used slightly different vegetables and in different proportions (too much carrot for me). I came close to doubling the soy sauce, and it would have benefited from more ginger and garlic. For 6 cups of vegetable, I would probably use three cups of rice and two chicken breasts (or not bother with chicken at all and use tofu/egg), plus increasing the garlic, ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil. It still would have plenty of vegetables. Oh yes, I steamed everything but onions, red pepper, and mushrooms to cut down on the oil.

Just realized I forgot the broth. Evidently we didn't need it. I skimped on the soy sauce but it definitely needed the full 2 tbs. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable and sesame. Not having sesame probably cut down the flavor as well. I used frozen veggies I had on hand and fresh zucchini.

I never review a recipe, it goes to show how amazing this recipe is. The way this is cooked, the steps, perfected how I make fried rice. the sauce was just right and it was even better leftover.The only thing I would change is the amount of oil, I would lessen the oil as I go only because there was oil left over after each step.

Only changes I made was that I used less garlic than the recipe and substituted white rice for the brown rice.  It was very good and my husband did not complain about the 2 cups of zucchini. I will make this again for sure.
