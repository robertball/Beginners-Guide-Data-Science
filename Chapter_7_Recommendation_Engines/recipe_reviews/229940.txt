My hubby liked this a lot!  I made it with the exact ingredients but in a little different proportion plus a little olive oil to mix with the butter when cooking the chicken..  I used a Costco packet of boneless skinless chicken breasts, a mix of 4 tablespoons of ranch dressing and 2 tablespoons of Dijon, and all the wine.  It was very easy to put together and very easy to serve.  He thanks you very much for the recipe!

Loved this dish!  My husband said this dish tasted great and I could make it anytime.  I did tweak it a little since we like bold flavors, I added blackened seasoning to the chicken instead of just salt and pepper.  Also I used light ranch dressing.  I didn't measure and estimated the amounts of dijon, ranch dressing and white wine in the sauce.  I probably added a little more white wine and a little less dijon.  After tasting the sauce it was really tangy so I added about a tablespoon of sugar to offset that and it was perfect.  This is such a wonderfully delicious and easy recipe.   We will be making it again.   Thanks for sharing.

My husband thought this was great. I couldn't eat it. I literally had two bites and couldn't handle the tangyness of the dish. I tasted the sauce after making it (followed the recipe exactly) and it was so strong that I decided to add some sugar like Occasional Cooker did. It slightly improved but I still did not like it. My husband did enjoy it so I will make it again but will greatly reduce the amount of dijon in the sauce.

I made this recipe without the pasta, just wanting a dressing for the chicken.  It was great.  This is a simple recipe to adjust according to your taste buds, so keep that in mind when mixing the dijon mustard and ranch dressing.  There's no way it shouldn't turn out if you taste as you go.  I also got ahead of myself and mixed in the wine with the mustard/dressing mixture, but it didn't matter as it still turned out great.  Will make again for days when "just" chicken sounds boring!

This is a good recipe.  I made it as is - more eyeballing the sauce ingredients bc I was using 6 cx breasts and wanted enough sauce.  Definitely needed sugar to cut the sour/tangy taste!  I thru some in and would taste as I went along to get the right amt, around 2 tablespoons.  4 of six of us really enjoyed it.  The others are extra picky, and don't like mustard in general.

The success of this recipe depends on which ranch dressing you use.  Many ranch dressing have way too much "bite" for this recipe.  I'll try this again with a much milder ranch.  First attempt was just ok but not great.  I'll try one more time.

My husband and I tried this recipe and we loved it. I used home made butter milk ranch so it was to or liking, I agree with sweetening the sauce, rather than sugar I had honey, I also used bl/SL chicken thighs, they are more moist than breasts and you can get a huge batch individually packaged at Costco for $15. We will be making this again

When I read the reviews, I was hopeful for this recipe to be a hit at my house.  Neither my husband, my 19 year old, my 13 year old, or myself cared for this. Definitely not a repeat recipe at my house!

This recipes was delicious! I did cut the Dijon amount in half and I also substituted the white wine with apple juice. Great recipe and we will use again.

My family and I really liked this!  It is tangy....more mustardy than ranch.  I will definitly make again, I might try less mustard next time, just to experiment a bit.  Really thought it was fantastic!

Made this tonight, substituting chicken broth for white wine and decreasing the amount of mustard to a couple tablespoons. I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't eat it, but my husband LOVED it! He raved multiple times during the meal and again commented later "good find". My young daughter's wouldn't eat it because the sauce was brown....though one did try it and liked it!

Awesome! We had it with asparagus and it was a great combination. My Italian Mother-In-Law, however, was probably rolling in her grave...pasta with mustard and salad dressing. I really appreciate the  feature on this site which allows you to adjust the recipe to suit the number at your table. --Nello

It was alright. I wouldnâ€™t make again, but not bad enough to throw away. I love ranch dressing, and I love Dijon mustard, but the combination of the two was a bit strange. The smell of the sauce was off putting.

This was really easy and quick.  I served it over a rice/quinoa mixture.  We loved it.  I may try the sauce over salmon sometime.

We made this as written and it was excellent.  As the meal wore on, my wife and I discussed expanding this wonderful recipe in some other directions to pull in some other options.  Our thoughts went to adding mushrooms, cutting the chicken into chunks (more surface area for sauce ).  We served ours with asparagus on the side...more sauce!  Why not cut the asparagus and add to the mix.  Heck, why not add the pasta too and make one big, wonderful flavor fest!  Now I know that these are basically different meals, but none of the 'changes' actually change the base flavor blend!  Thanks Abbey!

Even though I used less mustard than the recipe, it still tasted too tangy for me, so I added some tomato paste, which both thickened the sauce and cut the sharpness.  Not bad!

Thought it was okay, but probably will not make it again.  My son loved it.  I guess for me it was a bit too strong on the dijon mustard.  Not what my taste buds were looking for.

Good, but very tangy. I decreased the mustard and added a little sugar like other reviewers said, but it was still very tangy. I would make it again, but next time just pour a little sauce over the chicken and pasta instead of drenching it.

I made this for my fiancee and his Mother and her husband while they visit us for an extended stay. Looking for a quick and easy dinner that two picky eaters would eat I came across this recipe and decided to try it. It was a huge hit and devoured with no leftovers! I substituted chicken broth for the wine, and I will try it with the wine next time, as we will be adding this to the collection of recipes.

We made this with Minorcan Datil Pepper Mustard, a spicy mustard made in St. Augustine, FL, since we didn't have any Dijon. It was spicy! And, very tasty. I used chicken broth with a bit of white wine vinegar since I didn't have any dry white wine, which may have added to the spiciness. Will make this again!

I tried this today and was quite pleased although I tweaked the recipe. I followed the advice of others and only used 2 tbs of mustard as I don't like strong mustard flavors. I sauteed green onions after cooking the chicken and included that in the sauce.I didn't have wine so I used apple juice. I used bacon ranch dressing and added crumbled bacon and mushrooms to the sauce.This will definitely be added to my rotation.

This recipe sounded good, but didn't taste good. My husband likes ranch dressing and he didn't even like it. It might be the ranch, cause that's all I could taste.

This looked really good on paper.  It literally tastes like nothing but mustard.  Plus, it is really ugly.  Brown chicken on pasta with a really ugly yellow-brown sauce.  No wonder there is no photo of the finished product!  My husband usually eats anything and loves Dijon.  He did NOT like this one.  The mustard was really overpowering.

Needs less Dijon, or buttermilk added to the simmering sauce . . . Otherwise the sauce is a bit too strong.

I like to taste the chicken in a chicken dish. The sauce totally overwhelms the chicken. It's pretty much like eating Dijon mustard and ranch dressing.

The chicken was great but the sauce is way too tangy.. I love Dijon but it was too strong as well. I added chicken broth and milk to the sauce to dilute it and then had to thicken it up with cream cheese. It was STILL too tangy for us.

I made a few small changes to this recipe. I added some sliced green onions to the pan just as the chicken was finishing cooking. I then removed only the chicken and added the wine and sauce to the pan. I also added about 1 TB of sweetener to the sauce while it simmered. This recipe wasn't bad

This is a very nice easy recipe to follow and quick to make; perfect for a busy week night. There is a bit too much mustard, however. Next time I will cut the mustard in half.

Ate the dish but I felt like a child eating a dish my mother would make me eat until I finished my dinner. I am so thankful I didn't put the sauce in the rice. Children had it with BBQ sauce (only way they'd eat it).  Will never make again. Sorry Kat.

Tasty and fast!  Made this on a weeknight when there is always less time to cook, and with just a few ingredients this tastes like you have spent hours in the kitchen!  I used Marzetti Simply Dressed ranch which was light and delicious.  We like the tangy taste of Dijon, but could see reducing if you do not like that flavor to be as strong.  I cooked rice noodles instead of pasta, and they really soak up the sauce which was great.  Will definitely make this again!

This was awful, Save the ingredients and don't make it.

Way too much Dijon.  I would recommend a quarter cup at most.  Season the chicken any way you want,  the sauce is about all you'll taste.

This was ridiculously good!  Took some tips from other reviews and scaled back the mustard to 2tbls, poured in a little more white wine and seasoned the chicken with Tony Chachere's creole seasoning- yum!  Hubby cleaned his plate!  Definitely use this one again.
