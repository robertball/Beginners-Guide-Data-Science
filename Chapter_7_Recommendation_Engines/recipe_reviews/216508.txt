Very tasty although I did alter the recipe a bit. I kind of combined this recipe and the Flat Iron Steak and Spinach Salad recipe from A/R. I'm not a big fan of raw mushrooms so I sauteed 1/2 sliced red onion, in about 1 T of olive oil until tender than added 1 sliced portobello and 1 1/2 sliced red bell pepper, and a splash of red wine and cooked until tender. I served this on top of some baby spinach, with the steak, parsley, tomatoes and dressing from this recipe. So satisfying!
