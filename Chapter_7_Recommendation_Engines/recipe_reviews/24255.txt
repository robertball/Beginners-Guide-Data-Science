So much better than store bought and so quick and easy to throw together why bother with the bottled stuff?  This was exactly what I was looking for to slather on our Reuben sandwiches.  When I make it again,  I think I'll try more horseradish.  (For those who are not sure, the chili sauce called for is Heinz 57, or something similiar, not the hot chili sauce!)

Not quite what I expected but still good. Next time I'll increase the amount of chili sauce. This would make an excellent dipping sauce for boiled shrimp!

I have to give this 5-stars because it was wonderful even though I used lowfat mayo.  I also used this over a shrimp salad.  Yummy!!!

Very good, and so easy to make!  I always have these items on hand so it's great to be able to make this homemade vs. buying the stuff in a bottle and it tastes so much better too.  I used this for "The Earl's Sandwich" from this site but I'll be sure to remember this for reubens too.

great flavor.  I didnt use it on salad, just for dipping seafood and in recipes.  I dunno what that other person meant about not liking the color, it's around the same color as thousand island dressing, a kind of really light pink/orange.

Just what I needed for my Reuben sandwiches. I only added just a touch of garlic powder and a little fresh ground pepper. Thanks!

I should have rated this a long time ago. It is quite simply excellent.  Easy to prepare and much better than anything out of a bottle.  I like to make this salad dressing to go with "Tasty Tender Pork Tenderloin" which you can find on this website.  The little bit of extra effort is well worth the end result:  Succulent and Delcious!

Yummy! Perfect the way it is. Has a nice bite to it. A little less chili sauce or horseradish would make it taste like your regular store-bought russian dressing.

Delicious!  I used fat free mayo and low sodium Worcestershire, fresh parsley.  I made my own ketchup previously (low salt & sugar free) and used 3 tablespoons of that in place of the chili sauce along with 3 tablespoons chili powder.  I used my stick blender to combine the fresh onion and parsley.  Everyone thought it tasted fresh and was more flavorful than the bottled version.  Will be using this in place of store bought from now on.

I just made this to use in Cranberry Sauce Chicken II. I really wasn't sure my granddaughter would like it at all but she asked for a taste and her response was, "Yummity yum yum YUM!" We'll use it on salad tonight and probably have to make another batch for the chicken tomorrow night. I used Hellman's Light mayo and the dressing is delicious. Thanks, Sal.

Great recipe! I finely grated about 3 teaspoons worth of onion into the mixture directly, juice and all. Also, I used fresh parsley (about 1 tablespoon), used Crystal Hot Sauce for the chili sauce, and ended up using about 2 tablespoons of ketchup and 1 tablespoon of sugar in order to sweeten it up. I also added black pepper. I will make this again.

I feel bad that I haven't taken the time to review this recipe in the 6 years that I have been making it. I like it very much. I make it Exactly as stated. In particular, I use light hellman's mayo and  a chili sauce that's sold in the refrigerated produce section of upscale grocery stores. I'm going to make this tonight so my boyfriend can try it for the first time. I also plan to make it for the holidays this year for my eastern European friends and family, because I think they will really enjoy and appreciate it.

This is very good and easy, and keeps well.  I don't keep 1000 Island dressing on hand; I made half the recipe when I needed it for reuben sandwiches.  It was great and I didn't have a ton left over.

I liked this dressing.  I thought it turned out very good.  I didn't have Horseradish so instead I used Seafood Sauce, about a tablespoon.  It still turned out great.  Used it for the Russian Dressing I needed in another recipe and that turned out great too.  Thanks for sharing

This is tasty, and as close to Carnival Cruiseship reuben sauce I could find! Goes well with Reuben sandwich II on this website.  I didn't change the recipe at all.

Very good dressing, however, I wouldn't call it "Russian" because it's really more like 1000 Island.

I'd never use a thick, gooey dressing like this for a salad, but I am reviewing this recipe because I used it in the Beef-stuffed squash recipe also found on this site. The dressing turned out very well and is quite tasty.

Good, but not awesome.  But then, I'm not really a Russian or Thousand Island person (because these two dressings are very similar).  That being said, I tried it as a dip for cold crab and it was delicious!

Easy and excellent! I didn't have chili sauce but I did have sambal Olek which is similar so I used that instead. This went great on our pastrami sandwiches and I would highly recommend this over store bought Russian dressing.

For a Russian dressing, this was good.  Did not taste at all like 1000 Island, in my opinion.  I added an extra half teaspoon horseradish for an extra kick and it was perfect for Reubens.  Also was just fine with light mayonnaise.

This is a great salad dressing and very easy to prepare. It also makes an awesome dip for veggie platters.

Too much mayonnaise compared to the other ingredients, for my personal taste. But not bad overall!

I needed Russian dressing to make the Beef-Stuffed Squash on this site and the only bottle in the grocery store looked pretty lame, so I made this--yummy!!!!

I've been making this dressing every so often for the last year or so, and it is always delicious.  I made it again today using  homemade mayo (EASY with a stick blender!!! and free-range eggs. Yum.) for a salad from our garden.  This has become my favorite dressing.  It has enough flavor to complement just about anything, but not so wild that it overpowers the tender young greens.

Excellent.  Used this last night on reuben sandwiches.  Perfect for these and probably even better on a wedge salad.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe! I even made a eggless version by using fat free plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise. Had to tweak the proportions just a tad and add a bit of salt.

I went looking for a Russian dressing since we were making reubens with lefover corned beef and I can't even GET bottled Russian dressing at the store anymore. Must not be a hot seller.... My only minor complaint is that it is TOO thick an gooey. It should be creamy, but not gooey. That was easily fixed with adding 6 TB of milk to it. Also: the flavor was much better after it sat in the fridge for a few days. (The leftovers used later were better....)

I had actually never had Russian dressing before trying this recipe, but if Russian dressing is supposed to be like a spicy yummy mayonnaise, than this did the trick!  Also, it was *easy*.  I made it to use in the Beef-Stuffed Squash recipe that I found on this site.

Very good.  Next time I will double the horseradish and cut the hot sauce down to 1T.  I don’t mind the spice, but IMO, the horseradish give a more flavorable and less painful heat.

I cut the recipe in half for Reubens.  Did not have  chili sauce, so I used ketchup with added chili powder for substitute.  Happy with the results.  Thank You for the recipe

Tasty. So easy! I used the dressing to make "Golfers Chicken" (another wonderful AR recipe!) I had to substitute grated ginger for the horseradish. It was really delicious with the ginger. Am making it again for hoagie night.

I made this to go with Corned Beef Special Sandwiches from this site.  I didn't have chili sauce so I had to make up my own using chili powder but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was quick and easy and tasted great on our sandwiches.

I used this with the Pork Tenderloin recipe on this site and didn't have a jar of Russian dressing. So I found this recipe and it is so easy to make. Next time I plan to try using part mayo and part plain yogurt.

I'm not sure what is meant by "chili sauce" but the only chili sauce I know of is Sriracha. I know this sauce is really spicy so I just used one tablespoon. It was still too spicy for Russian dressing, so I added some sour cream to dilute it. The dressing still didn't taste right to be so I added some dill pickle relish which helped. After my alterations it was really good on corned beef sandwiches.

I made this dressing today to go on the Earls Sandwich from this sight.  This dressing was actually really good!  I am not sure if I would enjoy it on a salad or anything because it was a bit heavy, but what I did use it for turned out great.  As I didn't have chili sauce I just subbed in some hot sauce.  Also, I didn't have onions, so I just subbed onion powder instead.  The taste of everything blended very well together & I enjoyed the bite of this dressing.  If I make another recipe that calls for Russian Dressing, this will be my "go to".
