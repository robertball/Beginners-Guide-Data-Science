my husband and i loved this recipe.    i used broccoli and red pepper, and you don't need a food processor to blend all the ingredients - i just used a wisk.  this will def be added to the weekly favorite meals.

ps - the recipe says it serves 4, but the two of us ate it all (and we're not big eaters).

The veggies and chicken turned out well, however, the title of this dish is a bit deceiving.  There is a very prominent nutty flavor from the sesame oil and peanut butter.  I would recommend this only to lovers of peanut sauces in their Chinese food.

Don't get me wrong...I thought this was a very tasty stir-fry.  But Honey-Mustard?  The predominant flavor to me was Peanut Butter.   I used vidalia onions and green onions as the only vegetables for the stir-fry but served broccoli on the side.  Added at least 1/4 cup additional liquid to the sauce to make it  a good thickness to spoon over rice.

My husband and I really liked this served over rice, and enjoyed the flavours. I did add a few more vegetables to the mix to bulk it up a bit more.

Very tasty. The only thing is it is more of a peanut sauce than honey mustard. Still very good, but a little deceiving. I love the peanut buttery taste, but may try lessening the peanut butter amount to tste more of the other flavors next time.

Thos recipe was okay. I also would add more mustard and less peanut butter. The peanut butter made it too heavy for a stir fry. I used zucchini, broccoli, asparagus, red pepper and bean sprouts.

Switched rice for Asian instant noodles. Mixed noodles into the mixture before serving.  Changed zucchini for carrot and green pepper.   Very good. We too used a little less Peanut Butter and a bit more mustard.

All we can say is EXCELLENT.  As the other reviewers noted, you can vary things to taste, but the sauce is perfect.

Very good!  It needed an additional Tablespoon of peanut butter, and I doubled the sauce ingredients so there was extra to go over the rice.  Omit the cayenne if your family does not like spicy!

I thought this stir fry was fantastic.  I added mushrooms, snow peas, and water chestnuts to the mix since I like a lot of veggies.  My family loved it!

This wasn't nearly as good as the other reviews implied.. 

The sesame oil is too strong and over powers the other ingredients (as noted in a previous post). I'd cut it way back. I also up the mustard, soya sauce and honey.

It definitely has potential and I may paly around with it in the future.. I'd suggest you do the same while making the sauce!

the peanut butter was overpowering and therefore the honey mustard taste almost non-existent. next time i'll reduce peanut butter to 1T and add extra honey and mustard as well as more hot pepper.
