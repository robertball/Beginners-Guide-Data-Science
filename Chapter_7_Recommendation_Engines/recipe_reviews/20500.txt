This was a smash hit at my party! I ran out of this one in 45 minutes (I made 20 servings). Very fruity and easy to drink not too alcoholic (because of the majority of daiquiri mix) but still gets your heading a'spinning! The floating ice-cube hand (made by filling rubber glove with water freezing it and then removing the glove) was the perfect touch. Overall very very excellent!!!:-)
