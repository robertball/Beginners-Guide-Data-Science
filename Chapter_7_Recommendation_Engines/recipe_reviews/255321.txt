Wow this recipe is super easy to make and at the same time looks really fancy. The potatoes have a nice crispy coating before biting into a tender center. This is a perfect date night dinner!

This review is for the potato part of the recipe. Absolutely fabulous. The potatoes turned out crisp and tasty. My husband said it was one of the best potato dishes he's had.

This recipe (without the potato part) was featured in AllRecipes Dec/Jan 2017 magazine. I made that version. Absolutely delicious!!! And truly easy to make -- 4 ingredients. Hubs loved it too! Thanks!

This was very good. Made exact to the recipe but used tri-color potatoes. Will make again!

This is awesome! Almost too easy I can appreciate time consuming meals since I feel cooking is an art. I love how the herbs and seasonings compliment the flavor of the salmon and don't overpower it. And the potatoes came out perfect. Thank you:-)
