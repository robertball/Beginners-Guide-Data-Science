I used canned beans, which reduced the cooking time significantly. This is a very yummy and very easy chili recipe. Make sure you have sour cream on hand!

Impressive!!!Our neighborhood community had a chili cook off and I won 1st place ($75 prize) using this receipe.I did use canned black beans/kidney beans to save time.  Whole Foods does sell buffalo meat but a $1.+ & I was able to find the meat @ a reg.grocery store.  My chili was completely gone at the end of our community chili cook off.

Love, love, love this recipe. I use canned beans vs. dried beans, leave out the zucchini, add 1 can of green chilis, and use the entire jar of salsa. I also put it in the crock pot in the AM on low and it is perfect at dinner time!

Mmm, good chili!  The zucchini goes wonderfully with the other flavors, I would never had thought of adding it to chili.  I used canned beans, and added water to a small can of tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce.  I added about a tsp. of garlic powder,(out of habit), and had to skip the jalepeno pepper,(we are spice wimps).  I will be using this recipe for chili from here on out.

So how's about that changing around recipes?
I used half beef and half buffalo meat, one can each of northern, red and black beans, an onion, a large can of tomato sauce, a thing of spicy salsa, and then seasoned the heck out of it with crushed red pepper, chile powder, cumin, etc.  The cumin gives it much more of a Southwestern Mexican flavor than just the spices.  I didn't have any jalapenos on me, so instead I used a few Thai chile peppers.  I tend to not like my chili overwhelminly tomato-y, so this version came out great!  I'll probably add more meat next time, though.
And however insecure East Texans are, West Texans are certainly not immasculated by adding a few beans into their dishes.

No true TEXAN would and or could enjoy a chile made with "beans".  All of the Terlingua chili cookers will have a good chuckle at this recipe.......

Very good recipe.  I also used canned beans instead of dry to save time.  I'm not sure what chili sauce is and couldn't find it, so I omitted that ingredient.  I served it with shredded cheese on top and corn chips.  Very yummy.  I wonder if the flavor would be any different with another type of ground meat (turkey, beef, venison, pork, etc); I'll probably be trying this recipe with other types of meat to see.

I made this for a Sunday afternoon football watching gathering, and everyone LOVED it!  We decided to double the recipe to feed the masses, in doing so we doubled all ingredients except: both types of beans (I used 1 can of each instead of dry), zucchini, and I omitted the bell peppers entirely.  Great flavor, my husband said to never make another kind of chili again.

The buffalo tastes excellent. This recipe could use a little more spice though.

This is a flavorful recipe.   I added 1/2 t. of ground cumin and extra crushed red peppers.  My husband loved the zucchini in the recipe.  I used one can each of red kidney, black and white northern beans.  It made the chili very colorful.  I will share this recipe with friends.

I have made this a few times now and everyone loves it.  I follow the recipe exactly and wouldn;t change a thing - I do add a tiny bit of sour cream in my own bowl but it is great without it.  It is too spicy for my mom and a few others but this is my dad's favorite too so thanks for sharing.

This was really good - i especially liked the black beans with the recipe. I don't know if it was because the pieces of zucchini were too big, but they stayed too firm and I'll probably leave them out entirely next time I make this. A great use for buffalo meat!

Made this on the stove top rather than the crock pot due to time restraints.  Let it simmer about 3 hours and it was great.  My husband called it a "hearty chili" because it was so thick.  I will make it again!

This is our goto chili recipe, I've been making it for years, but have never reviewed it. I've made it both with buffalo and ground beef instead. I too use canned beans most often (I can never remember to soak the beans the night before). The only reason I'm giving this four stars is that without four or so garlic cloves and some cumin, it is definitely missing some layers of flavor. BTW I have sauteed the ground beef and put everything in the crock pot with great results.

We made a double batch, added two habenero peppers, and mixed in some venison. We served it to our Southern CA church people. They LOVED it! We didn't tell them until afterward that it had both buffalo and deer in it. They were shocked that game could taste this good! We didn't even get to take any home with us, because they ate it ALL! We're making it again for Monday Night Football. :)

I couldn't find ground buffalo anywhere (the woman on the meat counter at Meijer looked at me like I had 3 heads when I asked if they ever got it), so I used crumbled up buffalo burgers instead. I also used a can of kidney beans to save time. This was very tasty - hearty and filling. Thanks, sockgirl!

This is a fabulous recipe. I used Buffalo steak as well as ground buffalo, and also added a pound of ground venison. I added a habenero pepper that I had cut into tiny bits and took out the seeds. I also used canned beans. It tasted absolutely amazing. Even my mother liked it and could not tell the venison apart from the bison. This is a great recipe!

This was very good.  However, we prefer the Colorado buffalo chili recipe from this site (with our modifications).  The only thing I did differently was that I used canned beans.  We liked the addition of zucchini.  It seems like the meat could use a bit of seasoning while it's cooking. This dirtied a lot of pots, but it was tasty.  I'm curious if it would taste as good in the slow cooker.

A great chili! I also used canned beans to reduce cooking time. Came out great. I also added some garlic and lime juice. Delicious!
