I love this smoothie recipe! This submitter has a few good smoothies I really love. I actually lost weight drinking this smoothie when I had a chocolate craving. Changes I have made are subbing the milk for vanilla almond milk. The banana being frozen is a must for a cold creamy texture. I get 2 servings at 255 calories each. Thanks, Linda LMT
