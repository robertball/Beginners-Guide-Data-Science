I really liked the taste of this dish.....the only reason I didn't 5 star it is because it was little runny....thinking it needs one more egg!   I will make this again

The first time I made it, I used fresh red bell pepper and it was really good!  Today, I am making it with extra spinach, black pepper, fresh green bell pepper, and capers.  This recipe is so good, I think I could add cooked chicken cubes or bacon, and it would be great!

I wanted something prepared ahead for breakfast when I need to get out the door quickly.  This fits the bill.  I used fresh diced red pepper and fresh spinach.  Because I am lactose intolerant, I used a lactose free cottage cheese as well as Cabot's lactose free cheddar in place of the mozzarella.  That all worked out fine.  I used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano and added some salt and pepper.  Very good and I will definitely make this again.
