An alright recipe, but I don't think it had much flavor.  I definitely added some extra soy sauce.

This was pretty good. I prepared it as written but next time I'll add some ginger and garlic to the pan before adding the peas/carrots.  As per Salser713, I'll also add sesame seeds when serving next time.  I had no problem mixing the soy with cornstarch as did jen55.  However, it would be easy, with no change to the taste, to combine the soy, cornstarch and broth and add it to the pan all at once.  There's no need to make it 2 steps.
I'll make this again according to my notes above.  it's good to have simple recipes like this on hand

I don't know if I read something wrong, but 1 tsp of cornstarch does not dissolve in 1 tsp of soy sauce - it makes a paste. And once you have snow peas in your skillet, it's near impossible to then mix that paste with the broth in the skillet, so you just get small bits of soy sauce paste scattered in your skillet. Or at least that's what happened to me.

Nice easy recipe. I julienned the carrots as I was in a hurry. The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds over the veggies when they were done. Thanks!

Very, very good! We have snow peas coming in from the back yard garden.  My husband also pulled a couple of leeks when he picked peas.  I sliced that and stir-fried along with the peas and carrots.  Not sure how much flavor that added since I have never made this before.  But it certainly did not hurt!

This is really good.  I added a little salt and pepper and I used a little more sesame oil (love the taste of it), but this was really a great side dish.  My husband loved it!!!

This  was a very nice quick veggie side with an Asian flair.  We had found some beautiful snow peas at the store and could not pass them up.  Did not know how I was going to fix them until I stumbled across this one.  

Instead of carrots I used a can of water chestnuts which complimented the sauce and still gave you some crunch and crispness to the dish.

I absolutely love this dish. I agree with some of the others & I added ginger, minced garlic, & a lil garlic powder to the dish while cooking. I also added some soy sauce to my bowl.

Simple, tasty recipe that is now a family favourite.  As other suggested I added some sesame seed prior to serving.  I also added a 200 gram pack of udon noodles to soak up the sauce and served with a pork chop.

As it is a good start to a flavorful dish.  I added fresh ginger, garlic, and a little hot pepper oil. We like a little heat.  Sometimes add mushrooms.  For the protein, chicken or shrimp is a wonderful addition.  After a little additions it is a 5 star dish.

It was a bit too saucey for me, probably due to not having quite enough snow peas, so I splashed with a bit more chicken broth to lighten it up.

I had some fresh snow peas I didn't know what to do with, so I tried this.  It's a great easy side for any main dish, Asian or not, and also tasty over rice.

I added broccoli, onion, garlic, green pepper and yellow squash.  Then I multiplied the rest of the ingredients by 1/2 again and added about 1T sesame oil and about 1 tsp salt to the veggies while cooking.  It was absolutely wonderful.

A perfect side for Asian dishes (I made this with Slammin Salmon, which is ridiculously delicious, btw), and then served it with rice.  I liked the sauce over the rice as the Slammin Salmon's sauce was too overpowering for me.  This makes a lot of sauce so it was perfect for plain rice.

I think this would be great with a little more flavoring - maybe a dash more soy sauce? I also think it would be nice to add some baby corn to the mix of veggies. I'll let you know how it goes next time. I also put toasted sesame seeds on it for just a little extra touch!

This turned out pretty good overall.  Quite a simple dish.    However one person commented on how hard it was to mix the corn starch and soy sauce in on top of the peas and I agree.   I think next time I will mix that with the chicken broth and pour it in that way.   Also, the recipe called for using sesame oil and I didn't see where to use it in the directions.

Made it as written, and added a chicken breast.  It's a good base, but I'll add ginger and garlic and pepper next time.
