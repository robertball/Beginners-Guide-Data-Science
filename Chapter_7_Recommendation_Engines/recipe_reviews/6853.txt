This was a disaster!  The biscuits and blueberries flooded all over the place.  It turned out too gooey and soggy.  Any way to fix this?

Took this to work and got rave reviews.   Made in a bundt pan and the only change I made was that I used 3 cans of buttermilk biscuit dough instead of 4 (rose just the right height and did not make a mess all over my stove)and used fresh blueberries instead of frozen.  Thanks Eleanor

An interesting twist to regular monkey bread. The batches that I made for my dorm floor were gone in a few hours. Very good with raspberries too.

This breakfast sweet was a hit at all the brunches I've brought it to. It's a little labor intensive to roll all the biscuits in cinnamon and sugar, but it's well worth the time. I have also substituted strawberries, raspberries,blackberries, and peaches.

Mmmm, delicious!  THis takes me back to when I was young and we'd get stickybuns for 75 cents...

I didn't have canned biscuits, so I used 2 packages of "bisquick complete cinnamon swirl" biscuits and made a 1/2 recipe in a 8X8 square pan.  cooking time was closer to 45-50 mins, and I used raisins instead of blueberries.  Also, I just dumped the extra couple of Tbsp sugar/cinnamon mixture from rolling the dough in into the syrup, so it is thicker & less gooey.

One thing I need to stress is that you should invert this over a cake plate immediately! If you wait for it to cool, it won't want to come out due to the syrup hardening.  

This would be amazing with chopped walnuts as well.  I would layer them under the dough so that when the syrup goes through to the bottom and you invert it, therewould be a caramely walnutty topping.  YUmmy!

This got rave reviews at my office. Here's what I did: I used 2 cans (12oz each) of the biscuits. All other quantities werre the same. I compiled it the night before and popped it in the oven in the morning so it would be hot to take to work. I only used half of the sauce (other reviewers said there was too much sauce), but due to the overnight refrigeration, I could have used more. It wasn't as gooey as others described when I baked it, but more moist with blueberry sauce. Was great and can be modified to fit almost any taste. Could also use frozen rolls and compile it the night before - just stick it in a cold oven overnight, and turn the oven on when you get up!

This was fantastic! I stuck loosely to the recipe, using just 2 jumbo buttermilk tube biscuits, (accidentally) adding about 1 or 2 tablespoons of vanilla, using 1 quart-sized ziplock bag of blueberries for the entire recipe, and using the remaining sugar/cinnamon mixture that I rolled the biscuits in for the sugar/cinnamon/butter mix that I boiled on the stove. Even with these adjustments, it came out great. We didin't even wait for it to cool before we all dug in.

I only used 2 tubes of biscuits and ended up making extra sauce because I thought the finished product was too dry; maybe I boiled the sauce too long because I was doing other things at the same time.  It was good and some people had "seconds and thirds".  Suggest using margarine as directed because using real butter gave it more of a 'butter' flavor. than 'blueberry'.

I made this for my bible fellowship class and everyone loved it.  I put it together the night before as suggested by one reviewer.  I would recommend not doing that.  I put the bread in an angel food cake pan and juice leaked out the bottom in the fridge and I think that's why the biscuits were so dry.  I recommend putting it together and baking it the morning you are going to serve it.

This was the first monkey bread I ever made and it was GOOD!!!. I only used one 16 oz. can of biscuit dough to make half the recipe. I also put some cream cheese inside every piece of bread. My hubby who usually doesn't eat what I make had two pieces!!!

This bread is awesome! I have made it several times. I only used 2 cans of biscuits each time. I also made this a couple of times with cream cheese. Just put a chunk of cream cheese in each piece of biscuit. A little time consuming but well worth it!

I had to change this a little to use what I had on hand-- mainly, I put it into two pie plates since I don't own a tube pan.  The outer edges got done faster than the middle, so I put foil over the edges until the middle was done.  I also used two 16oz tubes of biscuits since that's what I had available, and they were enough to fill the two pie pans.  I liked this recipe for something different, but I'm not sure I'd make it again-- I think I prefer to use my blueberries in cobblers or muffins instead.

This is extremely tasty.  I can't walk by it without grabbing a piece even after I've had my fill. 
One thing I've noted since cooking it twice...there are too many biscuits.  It has twice smelled up my house with burning blueberry goo and forced me to clean my oven(not a bad thing) from overflowing wonderful tasting blue goo.  The cake is worth it however!  Try using 3 cans of biscuits.  
If not for the mess, I would definitely give it 5 stars.

Great! Not overly sweet. I used frozen blueberries. Got a little "tough" on top layer (technically bottom layer after flipped) where blueberry reduction was poured. Might adjust cooking time or temp?

I changed this a little bit and used home-made cinnamon roll dough instead of biscuit dough, and I used Frozen mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries and blackberries).  It was a little dry and doughy.  But it was probably the dough that I used. If I make this again I will use a different dough and use more cinnamon sugar mix.

I made this yesterday for my very picky kids and they loved it! I use to make a basic Monkey Bread camping in Girl Scouts, but I love this variety.  I used blackberry instead because that is what I had. I also used a cup of brown sugar with the butter to pour on top of it all.  I am curious how good frozen peaches would go with this recipie.

This is GREAT!! You have to make sure you use ALL the sugar/cinnamon mix. Do not make this in advance or you will have a nasty mess on your hands. I tried to make this the night before and I had solidified dough in sugar water. This HAS to be made fresh. If you like blueberries, you will LOVE this.

pretty decent.  the strange thing is, although i don't particularly like it, i CANNOT RESIST continuously popping these little buns into my mouth.  
changes:  used only 2 tbsp butter; used 2 cans pillsbury 10 pack; used frozen blueberry, raspberry mix; sprinkled in some raisins; used a pyrex bowl for baking;
results:  turned out a little overcooked;  i recommend INCREASING the syrup to prevent dryness; did not maintain cake shape after immediately inverting onto a plate, but fell apart;

This was very good but I did make one big change; I used fresh strawberries in place of the blueberries. My son requested monkey bread 'with strawberries and cream cheese' for his birthday brunch, so I also topped the whole thing with cream cheese icing. Everyone enjoyed it, thanks for the recipe JJohn32!

I probably won't make this again, although with a couple of minor changes it would probably be pretty good.  First of all, I accidentally got very large blueberries.  Smaller would definitely have been better.  Secondly, 65 minutes was too long to bake.  The top was -- not burned, exactly, but definitely sort of black and crunchy.
