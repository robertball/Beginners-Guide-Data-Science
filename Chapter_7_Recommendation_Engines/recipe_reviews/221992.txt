Tastes great but it only made 5 pints. I've made salsa for years & decided to try a new method this year. I've never peeled my tomatoes or cooked the salsa prior to canning. I don't think I will again as it takes way too much time. It is tasty just too much work. I do like the addition of tomato paste & will add that to my normal method of canning salsa.
