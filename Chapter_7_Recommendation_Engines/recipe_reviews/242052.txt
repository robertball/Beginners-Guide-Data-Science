I first made it exactly to the recipe and, although I liked it (good crunch and enjoyed the sweetness mixed in), I thought it was a bit bland.  As a result, I gave it 4 stars.  I have since made some changes: I divide the oil between sunflower seed and sesame seed oils which gives the dressing a deeper, nuttier flavor.  I also brown the seeds and nuts.  Instead of dried cranberries, I added pomegranate (although this takes more time so if you're in a hurry, I'd skip).  Finally, to speed up preparation, I slice/chop the brussels sprouts in a food processor.  Quick clean up with just a rinse of the food processor.

This was very good! I did add more honey to the dressing as I thought it was too sour and wanted a bit more sweetness. Also, I think it could use more dressing, maybe another 1/2 recipe or so, but that's just my opinion. I suggest mixing this and allowing it to 'marinate' in the fridge for a couple hours b/c to me, it was even better that way. Next time I'm gonna add some chopped green onions b/c I think that would be a great addition. Even got hubby to eat Brussels sprouts this way, lol! Thanks for sharing. :)

So glad to have found this recipe; it is delicious. I agree that it needs more dressing, at least half again more. Did not have honey so used Splenda to taste. Did not use sliced apple or pumpkin seeds; instead added more sunflower seeds, almonds and craisins as well as about 1/4 C finely diced dried apricots. This is a keeper in the recipe file.

I made this as written and it's very good. My husband loves slaws,  when he tasted it he thought it was missing something. He added some blue cheese crumbles and WOW! It became a 10 star recipe! Thanks for a new slaw recipe

This was surprisingly wonderful.  We love brussels and are always looking for new ways to eat them.  

The only changes I made were- used olive oil because I couldn't find sunflower seed oil at the last minute.  I also added shredded chicken, making it a full meal.   Husband loved the dressing!  I'll be making this again (with the right oil next time)

I hate cooked Brussel Sprouts  but I wanted  to try something a little more healthy to add to my Thanksgiving table this year. Made per the recipe except I grated the apple and per the other reviews doubled the dressing, except for the mustard and added honey to taste.  These were good! My husband tried it and said, yep, I would eat this.  Will make again but may added a few more cranberries for a little more sweetness.

I used Bosch pears instead of apples and added diced broccoli stems. It had a nice mix of tart and sweet.

Salad was delicious and everyone in our group loved it.  I did make a bit more dressing and used about a pound of med-large sprouts to get the 6 cups.  Will be making again soon!

I love brussel sprouts and have never had them raw before. Theyâ€™re a bit like cabbage so this recipe is like a very nice Cole slaw. I completely agree with other reviewers that recipe needs more dressing to fully complement the ingredients. Also, I felt that refrigerating for several hours or overnight helps to meld the flavors

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used walnut oil, and the result was a perfect combo of sweet, tangy, and salty, with a nice crunchy texture. Leftovers were just as good. A definite keeper!

Admittedly, I made changes: we watch all forms of sugar intake, so I did not add the honey. Perhaps this is a deal-breaker because the result was pretty heavy sprout-tasting. Leftovers do keep (we served this over a couple of meals to accompany grilled meat). I had some leftover crushed pineapple that I served at dinner tonight, so I tried combining the two on my plate and it was WAY better - so I suggest to others that either you do not skip the honey or you add sugary fruit (like pineapple) because it really does need the sweetness.

My entire dinner party loved this salad.  I didn't care for the sunflower seeds, perhaps mine were stale.  I felt a little more honey to the dressing was helpful and I added bacon bits to the finished salad.  Using a mandolin made this an easy task.

This is a great recipe was excellent! Best made ahead of time and refrigerated for at least 4 hours or even the day before.
I used raisins and cashews and loved it and so did my family.

This salad went over VERY well with my family!
I tweaked a few things after reading some of the reviews beforehand. I used just 5 cups of brussel sprouts instead of 6, McIntosh instead of Gala apples, and raisins instead of dried cranberries. I think the latter two changes helped balance out the bitterness from the dressing. I'd definitely make this again!

I never thought Brussels sprouts raw and in a salad but this was very tasty. I sliced the Brussels sprouts using a mandolin but I did not have grapeseed oil ,so, I used olive oil and I had to omit the seeds due to allergies. I thought the salad was good but was lacking something? Even so, the Brussels sprouts & apple combination was delicious. Thank you! Will definitely make this again.

This is a very enjoyable salad with great crunch!  Thank you for sharing!  Next time I make it, I will substitute another oil for the sunflower seed oil as it seemed to overpower the other flavors.  I believe the sunflower seeds themselves would've added enough of that nutty flavor.

Quite nice, a very good combination of textures and flavors. but chopping brussels sprouts is a complete pain. Next time I'll do it with cabbage instead to save time.
