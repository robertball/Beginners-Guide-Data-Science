I made this and the glass jar exploded sending little shards of glass every where in my kitchen even into the refrigerator and ceiling. DO NOT PUT A LID ON THE JAR, cover with a dish towel or something light.UPDATE : The glass jar is the problem, use a crock like you would for pickles or sauerkraut. It needs to be sealed for the fermenting process but not with a glass jar.

Got my starter made and needed to do something with my fruit.  I took a cake mix...I had french vanilla on hand and added 3 eggs, 3/4 oil & about 3/4 cup water  and two cups fruit starter fruit chopped up.  Made cupcakes and baked for 25 minutes at 350.  Turned out great.  Have my starter going for my 30 day cake now.

I had gotten a liquid starter 20 years ago, and did not have the fruit starter to start making the cakes again, then I found this recipe and it is just what I wanted and it turned out great. I had enough fruit to make three cakes, and enough juice to start all over again. Only this time I will have enough starters to give to friends.

Emily, thank you so much!!  I've made this starter and cake about 15 years ago. Someone at my job brought the starter in and we all began making the 30 day cake. I placed the starter in the freezer for later and forgot about it. When I moved I ended up throwing it away. Recently I began thinking about the cake, but I couldn't remember the name of it, and I didn't have the starter. One day I went to Allrecipes, and put cake starter in the search, and up popped your cake starter. Thank you soooo much. I'm starting the starter this weekend, and my cake 21 days after that.

Thank you so much.  This is the only recipe for a fruitcake that my husband would eat.  His aunt has given me the recipe and a starter.  I allowed my starter to deplete and Aunt Debra as well as my husband have passed on. 
I was so excited to be able to revive this wonderful cake recipe that brings back wonderful memories of my husband and his aunt. ps. this cake freezes well too.  thanks a bunch

I have been looking for this recipe for YEARS!!! In the '80s my grandmother and her circle of friends had these cakes going around and I loved it!  She passed in 1998 and even though she gave me her recipe box before she died, there was nowhere to be found a recipe for the starter!  I remembered more or less what it had but I couldn't remember how it worked or when you were to add what...THANK YOU SO MUCH for posting this recipe as I can FINALLY make these cakes for a whole new generation and culture!!  :)

THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!!  In the 80's my family ALWAYS had a friendship cake on their counter, . .  I loved to help with this as a kid.  I haven't seen one of these in YEARS, and was so glad to have found this, . .  I made a TON of these for Christmas gifts this past Christmas (a bit behind on my ratings).  Everyone was SHOCKED!  It was very nice to find this recipe.  Thank you so much! We are no longer friendship-cake-less!

This awesome!  My mom was given a starter in the 70's and made this cake for years.  Sadly, she passed away in 99 and I let my ONLY starter go bad after a few years in the fridge...I'm so thrilled to find this recipe and the fond memories of my mom it brings back.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

My grandma used to make this when we were kids and we loved it.  The recipe died with her 12 years ago and I recently have been trying to find it.  I am so excited to have found it again! Thanks!

Very good recipe for the starter.  My husbands grandmother from Louisiana made this every Christmas and he has been craving it. I was concerned that it only marinated for 3 weeks, but it turned out great!  The brandy flavor is excellent!  I went ahead and made a cake from the starter fruit and the cake wasn't as moist as the 30-day version, at first.  But, as it sat for a day or two it became more moist  & delicious!

This has been something I used to love doing with my grandma and hope to pass this down to my girls to start their own family traditions one day. I also hope to bring my friends closet by making and sharing this with my wonderful neighbors. We are going to pass around the starter for the cake as well as the bread!!

Used this recipe and loved it. My personal recipe is for adults only...I got my starter jar from a person in Newfoundland and made cupcakes with it. Two cupcakes and you weren't legal to drive. What a hit they were. I continue to add to the original formula and have shared it a few times. The fruit is REALLY enjoyed all by itself too.

Great except I didn't have the stated amount of liquid, even after pressing the fruit, but just added a little water.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I remember having this sitting on the counter as a kid.  When I was recently discussing it with friends, no one had heard of it.  I'm excited to get this thing going!
