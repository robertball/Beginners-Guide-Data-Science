Tasty but a little too sweet, too much like pudding.  Good with tart fruits and berries but too sweet for melons (which is what I was looking for).

I brought this to work and everyone asked for the recipe!  They thought it was a custard, and couldn't believe it was so easy to make! I served it as a topping for a fresh fruit salad.

This dip makes for an excellent dessert with berries and vanilla wafers!  I added a full cup of yogurt, which made it less thick and not as sweet.

This dip is wonderful!! I doubled it to take to our tailgate and came home with an empty bowl! It's sweet but not too sweet like ones I've tried that contain marshmellow whip. The only change I made was to use vanilla yogurt because that was all I had on hand. Also, I liked the fact that it was a little thick becuase it didn't drip off the fruit right away like some do. Everyone wanted the recipe and couldn't stop raving about it! Even my husband who absolutely hates yogurt and hardly ever eats fruit had more than his fair share. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!

This dip was way too thick, and way too sweet for my tastes.
It was tasty otherwise and maybe would be good on something
other than fresh fruit.

With the recipe as stated, it was much too thick and I didn't like the taste/texture. I added milk to thin it to a reasonable "dip" consistency and it was good. I used peach yogurt with the vanilla pudding and that turned out well.

This dip is tasty and not too sweet.  It became very thick after being refrigerated overnight.  Maybe cut back a little on the pudding mix.

This is really good and really easy!  I used strawberry yogurt but I'm sure that almost any flavor would taste good. The sour cream is key b/c that way it's not too sweet.

Delicious!  I do recommend thinning it out with extra yogurt, though.

This dip had an odd texture and consistency when I followed the directions.  It was the color and consistency of deviled egg filling.  Maybe it's because I used full fat ingredients and most people did not.  I corrected the problem by doubling the sour cream and doubling (probably ended up tripling)the yogurt and adding skim milk.  I also had to use the blender to smooth it out.  Once I made these corrections, it tasted good.  I used it with apples and grapes.

I have never made this with yogurt, although I add Kahlua ( to taste) to the sour cream and vanilla instant pudding.Very good.

Great flavor, not too sweet. Very very thick, though. My kids and DH loved it. I think it would make a very nice after school treat spread onto graham crackers topped with sliced strawberries!

After reading the reviews about this being too sweet I tried plain yogurt and instant lemon pudding in place of the vanilla.  Delicious and a perfect complement to a fruit salad!!

I think a little drained, crushed pineapple added to this dip would taste fantastic.

I followed the recipe, but used vanilla flavored yogurt. The taste was rather mild and needed a little zip. I took it to a party and someone commented that it reminded them of "spackle"; could have used a little more liquid to smooth out the texture. ;-)  I would make it again, I prefer a yogurt-based fruit dip to the marshmallow/brown sugar versions.

Very tasty dip. Easy to make & light on the wallet!! I use white chocolate chip or cheesecake flavored Jello Pudding, will try coconut pudding mix next time to serve with pineapples & other tropical fruits :)
