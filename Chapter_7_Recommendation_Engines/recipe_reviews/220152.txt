AMAZING. I used crushed plain Cheerios instead of bread crumbs and I didn't have any ginger (and I substituted brown sugar instead of fake sugar) but these turned out INCREDIBLE!! Make sure you are VERY generous with the cooking spray though so everything sticks. I served mine with a little bowl of melted chocolate chips! :)

Delicious and easy! I used crushed cornflakes instead of bread crumbs and baked quickly in my toaster oven.

These bananas are great!! I used half tbsp. real sugar instead of the no cal. This is such an easy, quick and delicious recipe. I never would have thought to coat bananas with bread crumbs. This is a keeper. Thanks.

yummy and really simple to make, I didn't change a thing but next time I think I'll cut back on the bread crumbs since I had plenty left over after using 1 banana. Thanks for sharing!

We loved these little treats! They aren't too sweet, just right. I don't love ginger but went with it, and it was perfect with banana! I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed rice chex, because it's gluten free. I can't have artificial sweetener so I used 1 1/12 Tbs. sugar. This will be our go to snacks from now on! I can't wait to bake these for the grandkids!

I've made these twice now following the recipe but won't make them again. We served them to 30 diners today. It's an excellent idea  but we were glad we served the bananas with ice cream and a chocolate sauce.

Only change we made to recipe was graham cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs. The seven of us were ages 5 to 73 and none of us complimented the results. It was exactly as the 3-stars say . . . "OK". We'll move on and try another recipe next time.

They turned out really good, but are they supposed to be mushy when they come out of the oven? Or should they stay in the oven until they are crunchy?

What a great healthy dessert idea! So easy and delicious! Like others, I used brown sugar instead of fake sugar. I also did not find the need to spray the bananas before rolling them in the mixture. It stuck just fine without spraying them. I also think they would be great drizzled with chocolate!

Very easy to make and tastes good. At 110 calories per serving (1/2 of a banana) it's great for diabetics and those counting calories. I'll fix them often
