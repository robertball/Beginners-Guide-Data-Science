Just like I remember my Mom making for us as kids when we went camping.  I didn't use gum drops and I didn't have any peanuts. So, I used different kinds of chocolate chips (peanut butter chips, milk chocolate, and semi sweet).  It was a hit with the kids and adults.

We used microwave popcorn.. 4 bags of popcorn  1 & 1/2 cups of cashews and 1 & 1/2 cups of M & M's.  It was too much Popcorn to fit in the bundt cake pan, so we put the rest in the bowl. what a treat. Everyone love it.. Wanted to share our idea and experiment with you. With 13 teenages here for a party it was gone!!!!Yummy!!Yummy!!Yummy!!!

Yum Yum, so good. I like how you can cut slices just like a cake. Wasn't too keen on the gumdrops and I am a major gummy fan. Next time I'll leave those out and maybe substitute m&m's.

I love the idea of this cake! It is so versatile and you can use it at ANY holiday function. Plus you can make it colorful so kids love it as well. I made it for a Halloween potluck and used Candy Corn and Peanuts. Then I pressed it into a bowl, drizzled orange frosting on it and made it look like a pumpkin. I melted and molded chocolate to make a stem - so it was all edible. You could use any mold and the possiblities are endless with this one. Almost everyone asked me for the recipe - And it's SO SIMPLE! AWESOME!

This is a fun cake, it's like popcorn balls without the fuss.  You can change the candies according to the holiday you are celebrating.

This is very easy and very tasty! I mixed in honey roasted peanuts and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also pressed the mix into a 9x13 pan instead of bundt so I could cut squares.

Delicious!  It tastes just like a popcorn ball without having to go through the hassle of cooking a syrup, using a candy thermometer, etc.  I used my air popper and used the required 1/2 c scooper to measure the kernels.  That yielded 14 c of popped corn, so about 1 1/4 batches made enough popped corn.

This was good! It was easy to boot and a great recipe for those hot days when I don't want to turn on the oven, but need a tasty dessert! Instead of gumdrops, I used chocolate chips, and it eased that chocolate craving!

I made this cake for my sons 6th birthday party because I made cake pops and needed a cake to put candles in. I had stumbled onto the popcorn cake and was so excited to try it. I am so sorry to say that I am the only one who liked the cake. It looked beautiful. The candy additions I used were awesome. Smarties, mini rolo's, chocolate covered pretzels all mixed together with that yummy marshmallow covered popcorn. I couldn't use peanuts as all kids facilities are nut free here in Toronto but still, I can't understand why no one liked it. Not one of the kids took a 2nd bite. Personally, I give it 5 stars because I thought it was delicious and a nice alternative to a traditional cake but the kids have spoken, all of them. Thank goodness I made the cake pops!!!!!!

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ today; the kids especially enjoyed it as well as the adults.   I used 3 packages of Microwave popcorn and found some red and blue M&M's to use for decorating the top.  Was very festive looking.  There were no leftovers. I like how you can change this to compliment any occasion.  Thank you for sharing.

I only use 14 C of popcorn to make it slightly more gooey. Yum! My favorite is M&Ms with honey roasted peanuts. We aren't big gumdrop fans.

I made this recipe when I needed a quick and easy, gluten free treat to share. I popped the popcorn with our Whirley Pop, using a 1/2 cup of popcorn. It gave me about 15 cups of popped popcorn and I felt it was a good amount for this recipe. I added 1 cup each of peanuts and M&M's instead of the gum drops. I loved how colorful and festive it looked and it tasted great too! My kids loved it and the grownups did too. I will definitely make this again.
