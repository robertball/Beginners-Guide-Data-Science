This is great ! I did brown meats first then mixed everything together (I omitted the egg) and filled peppers. I covred and cooked them in the microwave on high about 12 minutes. I only did 4 peppers and put the extra filling in the pan around the peppers. Quick, easy and delicious. Prep took longer than cooking :)

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I love the combination of beef and sausage, and the herbs and spices are perfect. I think I'm going to be using this recipe as my new standard. The -only- thing I did differently than the recipe is to put a layer of plastic wrap between the peppers and the foil so that the acid from the sauce didn't corrode it.

The first time I made this recipe, I made it exactly as written.  It is very very good! The second time around I added a bit more sausage, just because I had already thawed it out, and I used red peppers because the green didn't look all that great at the store.  Still very good with more sausage but didn't really love the sweetness of the red peppers.  Back to the green for next time.  There are only two of us in my house so I freeze two more meals for the future.  They do freeze well too.  I would reccommend trying this recipe if you have been searching for a GOOD stuffed pepper recipe like I was until I found this one.  Thank you for sharing!

The Italian twist to the traditional stuffed pepper is great.  The recipe tells you to put the peppers in the oven at 350 degrees, however it does not tell you for how long.  I did make a change by spraying Pam on the bottom of the Pyrex and also adding some of the pasta sauce on the bottom. We also added a bit more mozzarella, you can never have too much cheese! I will definitely make them again.

These were very tasty, I didn't change anything.  The meat may have been slightly dry but that's because all of the fat baked out into the bottom of the pan.  I may try cutting the peppers differently next time so the juices can stay inside the mixture in the pepper.  Also a whole can of sauce isn't necessary, is it? Unless I did it wrong, I had a ton of sauce left over.  But overall I really liked this.

I've been making my stuffed peppers Italian Style for years and just made them again last night and my daughter said "Mom, this is so good, you should share your recipe on that food website that you're always looking at".  So this morning as I was getting ready to post my recipe, I came across this one that was VERY similar to mine.  There are just a few minor differences, I use just Italian sausage, no beef, I don't use the egg or Worchester sauce - other than that, everything else is the same.  Last night I didn't have mozzarella cheese and I was too tired to run to the store so I used what I had on hand.

This recipe is so good, healthy and easy to make that you can't go wrong.

My wife loves stuffed peppers, and we always enjoy trying variations. This one is very good -- we both loved it. I browned the ground beef and sausage first, and also parboiled the peppers for 10 minutes before mixing everything together and stuffing. I baked them for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.

These had a lot of flavor and were pretty easy to make.  That being said I much prefer my old stand-by stuffed peppers.

When I made this, I accidentally bought beef sirloin vs. ground sirloin, so I omitted the beef and just used Italian sausage. I would definitely add beef next time, but it was still a huge hit!

Super easy! I made the mistake and put way to much rice (put three cups instead of one) so was a little bland. But the family loved it. Fiancé never had them before and request I make them again

It was OK. I added more garlic but otherwise followed the recipe. When it calls for LARGE peppers it means large. I thought I had big peppers but I had a lot of filling left over. I also don't get cutting them lengthwise. Next time I will stick with my old recipe for stuffed peppers.

VERY TASTY! Only changes were using my own sauce and quinoa in place of rice and halving the HUGE green peppers we had and only needing 2 peppers!

We enjoyed this recipe.  However, I did use 5 green peppers, cut in half as indicated in the recipe, and I used a lb. of ground beef PLUS an entire lb. of Italian sausage.  I used 2 eggs, but basically the same amounts of everything else.  I put them in my roaster pan with a lid, and they were done just right in 90 min.  My kids liked them; my husband loved them, especially with the sausage in them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Terrific with tons of rich heart-warming flavor.  A hit with the entire family. The only variation was that instead of plain brown rice, I used a rice with quinoa & garlic mix because I was surprisingly out of brown rice. That mix has lots of garlic, so I'd probably add more garlic if I make it with plain brown rice next time.

I made these a few months ago and my family loved them so much they wanted them again the very next night. Even my 5 y/o cleared her plate so that's saying a lot of the recipe! The only thing I sub'd was the rice for a very small amount of Italian bread crumbs- they were not dry at all once I reduced the amount of breadcrumbs). You could also do a whole other green pepper..... I had so much of the meat mixture left over the first time that I added another pepper (halved so you will end up with 2 more portions). Easy, delicious, fast....my kinda dinner! Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe.  I omitted the rice made my own sauce and used poblano pepper. The poblano peppers added just a little kick.
Reminded me of the pepper appetizer at Johnny's in Cleveland

I liked the Italian twist for a change. I did 1/2 beef and1/2 sausage. I also cooked the meat first omitting the egg. I also substituted the rice with orzo because my husband isn’t crazy about rice. I followed the rest of the recipe except for cook time. I baked about 45 million then added mozzarella when it was nice and melts I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Good recipe!

Used this as a guideline. I used a ground beef and pork mixture instead of the sausage. I also added diced onion and more classico sauce .  Substituted rice for bread crumbs.  And once the meat mixture was stuffed in the pepper, I pop a couple of bocconcini cheese pearl in the center.

Made these today and they turned out  wonderfully tasty.  We did not find them dry but quite nice.  I wondered if people finding them dry cooked 1 cup of rice dry, instead of using 1 cup of cooked rice?  I did add an extra garlic clove and used all the pasta sauce.  Will be using this recipe again, and again.

I'm not keen on stuffed peppers but my husband loves them. He  enjoyed these so much and I liked them better than the normal pepper recipe because of the sausage. Will make again.

Very good. Kids like it better than other recipes...if is reminds them of spaghetti, you can't go wrong!
Second time: 1.5 the recipe, still one jar of sauce, precooked the meat, mixed in most cheese, topped with remaining. Baked for 30-40 minutes. Two whole peppers, 4 cut in half, 4 half peppers for leftovers.

This was really good! I did them a little different. I used yellow,red and orange peppers as we don't like green peppers too much.  I also left out the beef and just used 1 lb Italian sausage. easy to make and will make it again!

Delicious! I made this dish minus the brown rice. I also added a bit more cheese since I love cheese :). This recipe makes for a very rich flavorful dish. I paired this with wine and that made it all the more better.

Great recipe!! I've made it several times and it never fails to please! Since its just my husband and me, I make the full recipe and freeze the rest. They taste just the same months later. Love it!
