My favorite Rhubarb recipe so far!!!  Yum, Yum!!!  I took previous writer’s advice to add red food coloring to syrup and froze the dough for 20 mins. prior to rolling out to avoid stickiness.  I also used my food precessor to finely chop the Rhubarb. Worked great! 

Caution!!! A bit messy!!! Don’t assemble when you have mail on your counter!  

May use less sugar and add pureed Rhubarb to the syrup next time for extra flavor.  But it doesn’t need it.  Great the way this recipe written.

This was really, really good. Like another user stated it was sticky and hard to roll up, but it sure tasted great.

This recipe is a family favorite, to the syrup we add 2 cups chopped Rhubarb to make a basting syrup. 
Also we like to add some red food coloring to the syrup.

Very tasty and interesting way to use rhubarb!  I chilled the dough in the freezer for 20 mins due to its stickiness.  When I rolled it out I did it on floured wax paper.  This worked great.  The glaze you pour on before baking seems like a ton of liquid, but it turned out wonderful!

SO GOOD!  One thing we did a little different was to puree some of the rhubarb so that it wasn't all just chopped up rhubarb.  We then mixed it together with the chopped rhubarb and strained out some of the juice.  It was definitely messy, but so delicious and a different way to use up all my rhubarb!

Excellent!! I will cut down on the sugar though because I thought it was a little sweet. May try with granny smith apples, cinnamon, & brown sugar for another variation.

This recipe mimics my in-laws' cherished family rhubarb rolls recipe and tasted just as good! The only difference I made was I used brown sugar in the filling (instead of white) and I added a bit more cinnamon.

If I could go higher than 5...I would.  These are wonderful.  I did a couple changes.  When you add the rhubarb to the sugar & cinnamon it immediately starts to ooze, so I sprinkled the sugar mixture onto the dough and then put my rhubarb on the dough.  I also added some cardamon to the sugar mixture, about 1t., and add a little red food coloring to the simple syrup.  It just give the rolls a bright, cheery, pink color.  These are absolutely wonderful rolls.  Another suggestion....I use either dental floss or fishing line to cut my rolls, give a nice, smooth, clean cut!!!

I just got a whole bunch of fresh rhubarb and was looking for fun new recipes to try. I saw this one and decided to try it out. It was delicious, easy to make and everybody really really enjoyed it.

I  must have done something wrong.  The dough was so sticky, I had to keep throwing flour at it just to roll out.  Then, I couldn't roll it up once it was full of rhubarb, because the rhubarb kept ripping and poking out of the dough. It should be made on wax paper to facilitate rolling up. I finally dumped everything willy nilly in the 13x9 pan and then poured the syrup over and it came out with a nice crust, but all gooey and sticky and yucky at the bottom.  It looked awful.  My husband ate the top baked portion with the rhubarb, but even the dogs wouldn't touch the slimey bottom.

My mom made a similar recipe called Rhubarb Roly-poly, so I’ve loved this since I was a kid.  We always serve with heavy cream, but ice cream also works.  I agree it is a mess, but I’ve learned to get the dough ready (I just use my hands to push it out as I find that is easier than rolling sticky dough), then mix the rhubarb, sugar and cinnamon and immediately put on the dough and roll up.  I’ve also found working on wax paper helps, along with using a dough scraper.

Looks good in the pan, but has the texture and taste of a cobbler. Next time I'll go with a yeast dough like a traditional cinnamon roll.

A very similar recipe to one I used to use but unfortunately lost, and proved to be a good replacement. Be sure to use fresh rhubarb not frozen, mine turned out quite wet.

Delicious! I made it in a 9x9 pan since the rolls weren't big enough to fill a 9x13 tray.  I only used about 1/4 of the water/sugar/butter mixture in combination with the rhubarb juices (see below for explanation).   I combined the dough ingredients using a food processor adding the milk little by little (I ended up using a little less than the suggested amount).  Unlike some other reviews, I didn't find it too sticky; however, I did let it chill in the fridge while I assembled the filling.  I pulsed the rhubarb in the food processor to save on time, but it did add a lot of liquid into the mix.  For that reason I used a slotted spoon when dressing the rolls and pour any excess rhubarb liquid on top of the rolls (before baking) for flavour

Made this just as written...my family wasn't too impressed but I really liked them...they were a bit hard to roll up and I thought it would be too much rhubarb but once it cooked down it was perfect. I'd make these again- just would choose a different crowd to serve them to!

Followed it to a T.  Very easy and very tasty. Not super sweet. It is just perfect. The dough is very easy to work with.  I will make it again and again.Great recipe! Please use a stand mixer if you have one the dough went together real well in mine. It was so easy to flatten out. Very quick to make. Best way to use rhubarb!

I was unsure how this recipe would turn out, but it was great in spite of a significant error that I made (adding the sugar to the chopped rhubarb too soon).  I didn't realize that the sugar would pull SO much liquid out of the rhubarb SO quickly!  So, don't do what I did -- make sure that you add the sugar to the rhubarb just seconds before you place it on the dough!  These rhubarb roles were a great hit and tasted just as good the next day.  I will definitely make these again -- and these rhubarb roles motivated me even more strongly to grow my own rhubarb next year!

I did not find the dough sticky once I put flour underneath it and on my rolling pin.  It was messy rolling it, juice was running out of the sides and it did seem like way too much liquid before going in the oven but it did soak it all up. I found it had a bit of a soggy bottom s if you are expecting something similar to a cinnamon roll, it's pretty different. It was still very good and a nice change from rhubarb muffins.  Would be delicious with vanilla ice cream!  I may try it with a tad bit less syrup next time just for personal preferance.

Oh wow! More dishes than I like to wash for one recipe, but these were quite a treat.  Followed a helpful review to add more 2 cups rhubarb with the water for the syrup and simmered until tender before adding the 1 cup sugar.  The rolls were still very sweet but had just a touch of tart.  I also used 2 drops red food coloring to give the sauce a slight pink hue.  Rolled the dough out on a floured pastry cloth- no problem with stickiness.  Biscuit-type rolls were tender and moist but not soggy.  I'm freezing my rhubarb in 5 cup increments for future Rhubarb Rolls!

Very tasty, but messy, messy, messy to make! Be sure not to toss the rhubarb in the sugar until right before you roll the rolls up or you will end up with syrup running all over your counter. I only got 9 rolls out of the dough, and used a 9x9 instead.

Taste was okay but such a horrible mess to prepare.
