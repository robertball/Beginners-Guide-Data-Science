Very good recipe.  I read the reviews first though and made the following changes - used only 1 teaspoon of baking powder and also split the 1 cup of white sugar to be 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas - 3 ripe bananas.  These cookies were very moist, very cakelike and gone very quickly!  Extra chocolate chips never hurt!

I'm eating one of these fresh out of the oven as I type this..... These cookies are wonderful! My sister made cookies like these when I was little, but she doesn't remember making them anymore and I could never get the recpie from her. These are almost exactly them.... 

I made these with milk chocolate chips (compliments the banana very well), reduced the baking powder to 1 1/4 tsp, and used 3 (about 1 and 1/4 cups mashed) very ripe but NOT brown bananas... I couldn't wait for them to ripen that much ;) The banana flavor is delicate, but definitely there.... I think those who want a more banana-y flavor may want to try replacing some of the vanilla with banana extract. The cookies do have a slightly "muffin-y" texture to them... but don't let that put you off of trying them. I've never had muffins as good as these cookies.  (also, I baked these on parchment paper, and found they rounded themselves out reasonably well - better than it sounds like they did for other with just an ungreased pan)

Excellent cookie!Used parchment paper rather than greased pan. Added Dutch chocolate sprinkles. Dough is a little sticky and is easier to handle when chilled. Cookie stays moist and doesn't spread while baking.Increased banana to 1-1/2 cups and flavor is still subtle.Decreased baking powder to 1 tsp.Used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar.My family loved the results!

I made a few adjustments (1/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup, low calorie butter, 2 bananas instead of 1, 1 cup chips instead of 2) to make them a tad healthier and they still came out great.  I really enjoyed these cookies.

Excellent recipe!  I needed to use up some old bananas and these cookies were perfect!  I added some walnuts in addition to the choc chips.  Will definately make again.

I've never heard tell of baking a cookie at 400 degrees.  This cooking temp HAS to be off!  The only things I would ever bake at that temp are yeast breads such as French, and homemade pizza!  Any cookie or quickbread recipe calls for no more than 375!  While reading these reviews, over and over u see the phrase, "the first batch burned"...be careful and adjust the oven temp.  350 would be a good place to start.  Would hate to see bakers waste ingredients.

Very Yummy. The only changes I made was to substitute the sugar with Splenda, put carob chips instead of chocolate chips, and I halved the baking powder to 1 teaspoon. They are still coming out of the oven, batch after batch, and my 5 year old son is eating them up! He's had 2 so far, and loves them. These are nice puffy cookies that would be GREAT with a cuppa tea. I will be using semi sweet chocolate chips next time I make these because I love the two flavours together and carob just doesn't do it for me. ;) I was trying to be healthy about baking. Is there such thing really? hahaha!  Thank you for sharing a great recipe!

I made these in the shop a week ago.  I was going to double the recipe, but I miscalculated the butter when I started, and in order to avoid wasting the ingredients I had already added, I ended up having to make what amounted to 10 batches.  I ended up with sooooo many cookies, I thought we would never get rid of them.  So I set out tastes of this cookie for the customers, and all the cookies were sold within two days.  Our customers loved them.  I stuck to the recipe exactly and they were perfect.  Thanks, Evelyn.

I found these cookies to be okay.  I used the correct amount of bananas and still the flavor isn't that significant.  I don't think I'll make these again.  I'll probably try out the oatmeal/ banana cookies.

Bananas would have been better used in a cake, not cakey cookies. They were ok I guess if you like that type of cookie. Flavour was very good but personally did not like texture.

A nice twist to the standard choc chip cookie (and great use for those ripening bananas).  Next time, I'll 1/2 the baking powder.

This recipe is fantastic!  I did make the following changes as others recommended: 1 tsp baking powder, split the sugar 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown, more like 1.25-1.5 cups banana.  I also had some extra finely chopped pecans (maybe 1/2 cup?) around from a different baking project and threw them in the batter...it added a little more body to the dough and gave it a bit of a savory balance to the sugar.  My husband doesn't like banana-flavored anything, but loves these!  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe has a great flavor! I like chewier cookies, so I flattened the cookies mid-way through baking. I also doubled the banana and used a 1/2 cup brown sugar and a 1/2 cup white sugar. Really easy and really yummy!

I tried this today for the first time.  Because many other reviewers said that the texture was soft/cakelike/muffin-like, I went ahead and put the batter into metal cupcake liners rather than prepare them as cookies.  The result was marvelous -- yummy soft chocolaty muffins with a surprisingly strong banana aroma.  If you make them this way, they yield about 24 muffins and need a couple of minutes more in the oven (test with a toothpick).  Thanks, Evelyn Brown.

Followed the recipe almost exactly and the cookies were the incredibly soft kind.  I had frozen 4 ripe bananas and after thawing them, they fit in a cup.  If you have never frozen bananas, they turn black and when they thaw, they almost liquify, but it really enhances the flavor of the cookies.  Be sure to thaw them in a container.  Then I added 1 cup of peanut butter and called them the Elvis cookie!  Peanut butter, banana and chocolate chips - Awesome!

I thought these were good! I followed others' comments and used half the amount of baking powder and added more banana. 12 minutes was too long in my oven so the first batch had kinda dark bottoms. If you like banana and chocolate and you don't mind a cakey/muffin-like cookie, you will likes these!

These were a nice change from banana bread or muffins.  I changed the white sugar to brown, and cut back on the chocolate chips by about a half a cup.  I wish I would have used mini chips instead.  A good cookie-more cake like than a normal cookie.

My sons insisted that I join just so I could rate these cookies!  One said these are now his favorite cookies. The other said they are much better than plain chocolate chip cookies because of the banana.  The banana taste is subtle but just enough to make the cookies interesting.  I used 3 bananas, half whole wheat and half white flour, and followed others suggestions to use less baking powder (used 1 1/2 t.)and used half white and half brown sugar (used a little less than 1/2 c. each).  I added walnuts and raisins and only about 1 1/2 c. of chocolate chips.  The dough is fluffy rather than stiff and easy to use.  I baked them on a stone and after 12 minutes they were nicely browned.  They had a nice light texture (I didn't at all see a resemblance to muffin tops as some reviewers did).  They tasted wonderful.  My new favorite recipe for using up ripe bananas!  Thanks for the recipe.

Moist & Yummy!  I wish the banana flavor was a little more intense and I have some banana extract so I may add that next time.  I added about 1/2 cup more flour since my batter was really sticky & that did the trick.  I also only used 1/2 tsp vanilla and added 1/2 tsp almond.  They are very good and are moist... like a muffin consistency.  GOOD!

Fantastic tasting cookie, and very easy to make.  Thet texture is soft, just short of cake-like.  My young children loved them.  The recipe is very flexible, which I appreciate.  I cut back to 1/2 c butter, threw in some nutmeg and cinnamon and 1/2 c shredded coconut for added texture.  They do brown quickly on the bottom, so switch upper and lower racks halfway through and watch carefully.  Mine were done in 12 minutes.  Although delicious, they are not the most attactive cookie--a bit lumpy and inconsistent in coloring.  But, really, who cares about looks with a taste like that?

I was looking for something to do with my ripe bananas other than a quick bread.  My interest was piqued when I saw this recipe because hubs had been requesting chocolate chip cookies.  The color turned out light even though I split the sugar between white and brown.  In my opinion they were on the bland side.  However they have a nice texture.  More cake-like.  I suggest you watch your oven temperature.  I had to reduce mine to 375 degrees after the first batch, as the bottoms were starting to brown too quickly.  Next time  I'll add a teaspoon of cake spice or cinnamon to the batter for a little more flavor.

Great cakey texture.  Easy enough for an unskilled baker like myself.  Banana flavor could be a little more obvious

Great recipe!! I made a few changes. I was out of butter so I substituted butter flavored shortening. I cut the baking powder down to 1 tsp. Instead of a cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I upped the vanilla to a teaspoon and a half. Added dark chocolate chips, crushed walnuts, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and a half tsp of cinnamon. Mmmmm : ) I think I've found my go to recipe when I have overripe bananas!! : )

These cookies are more cakey/muffiny than gooey/soft, but they are still delicious. Upon reading the reviews, I used only 1 tsp. baking powder instead of 2 and I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1cup white sugar. I think next time I will add 1/2 cup more of banana since I wanted the taste to be a little stronger. Instead of 2 cups of Choc. chips I put 1 cup chips and 1/2 cup of walnuts...I actually think 2 cups of choc. chips would have been way too much! All in all, I like these muffiny cookies=)

My boyfriend and I really like these cookies.  I actually like the fact they are cake-like.  Possibly baking this in a tube pan would compliment the texture better, slicing it like a loaf of bread.  I did add 2 extra bananas as I noticed a lot of people said the taste was faint.  I am also a big fan of extracts and added a drop of banana extract.  I'm very pleased with this recipe and plan to share it outside of the home.  BTW, if you plan to make these you may want to eat them up right then and there because they do not store well.  They're extremely moist and tend to stick to one another.

Amazing recipe! It is very cake like but, that doesn't change how awesome these cookies are. I used 2 in a half cups of bananas. I highly recommend trying this recipe!

I have to say I was really disappointed with this recipe.  I love bananas and I love chocolate chips but this just did not yield what I was looking for.  Other reviews are completely correct that this recipe yields more of a cake or muffin like texture.  It just didn't seem like  a cookie to me at all.  I used half white/half brown sugars and used super-ripe bananas.  And there was relatively little discernible banana flavor.  I think there is potential for this recipe to make a banana chocolate chip muffin, but not a cookie.

There were 2 overripe bananas in my ref so I decided to bake these cookies. I love them, will definitely make again! I reduced oven temperature to 350 and baked them for 15 mins. Instead of choco chips, I used 1 c of white choco chips and 1 c of dried cranberries.

Very moist, almost cake like which I like.  However, did not have a lot of taste.  Not bad tasting, just bland and I used VERY ripe bananas.  Probably won't make again.

These cookies are just delicious! My hubby and I loved them, and I will be making them again soon. Lovely flavour and nice texture. 

I followed the advice of the others on here who reccomended using 1 tsp. of baking rather than 2, and I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. 

Thanks for a great recipe. I look forward to making these again and again. :)

Using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white but otherwise following the recipe, these were just great.  Baked for about 10 minutes due to high temperature.  When you mix in the flour the dough will seem VERY thick at first, but keep going and mix in the chips - it turns out fine.

These are not crisp cookies, they are basically banana bread in texture.  But my kids will eat them and they won't eat banana bread!  I use less chocolate chips, 2 cups was too sweet for my taste.

These were really good! I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter so I could cut some fat and they turned out well. Amazingly enough I think I will cut the chocolate chips in half next time. I did not need to bake them for more than nine minutes!

these do taste a lot like Banana chocolate chip muffin Tops.  Good non the less, I added, instead of suger, Nutra-Sweet, also I put in 1/2 butter instead of 2/3 butter.  Good, very tasty, if you like muffin tops. . . I know I do ;)

These cookies are very muffin like.  They don't have a cookie texture.  The taste was pretty good but would maybe be better made as muffins with like a sweet cream cheese topping.

Oh my heck! I think I am going to LET my bananas rot just so I can make these cookies :). If you love banana bread, you will love these! They are a little muffin-like, but they are awesome cookies. I gave them 5 stars, because they are easy to make, have great flavor, and a melt in your mouth texture. Thanks for sharing!!

I like this recipe!  I omited one egg and add extra bananas (4 whole bananas in total), I also freeze my bananas so they are sweeter when thawed.  These cookies brown on the bottom but don't change much on the top.  I also find they take 12-14 minutes to bake.  test the tops with your finger to see if they spring back, then they are done.  I find these taste just like banana bread. chocolate chips make them even yummier!!

Perfect...even my kids friends that don't like banana's really enjoyed these. I would suggest putting them in the fridge after they have cooled in a tuperware container really brings out the flavor and they keep much longer :)

very good recipe. I did have to decrease my heat to about 325F because they'd get too dark on the bottom and then not cooked through if I took them out sooner. So I baked them at 325 for 8 minutes. Pictures to come soon. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe!!! VERY YUMMY!!

I hate to have to give a bad review, but I tried this recipe even with the suggestions others gave (an extra banana, half the baking powder, chilling dough first, didn't overmix) and they spread out tremendously and the texture was like a pancake. The flavor was just so-so.

Substitued 1/2 cup oatmeal for flour, 1/3 cup applesauce for butter, cooked at 375F for 10-12 min on high rack(not conventional oven).  Also used 1tsp of baking soda and half brown and white sugar as recommended.
Were really good.

I used veg oil instead of butter and found the batter very runny, wasn't sure it would keep any sort of shape on a cookie sheet so I poured it into muffin cases- the best muffins ever!  So tender and tasty, really rose up high, only filled the cases 1/3 of the way.  Oh, and the bananas I used were so old they were completely brown and the peel was actually starting to harden...never need to throw away a banana again with this recipe!

Very good. Only thing I did differently was use 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of butter to make it healthier. They turned out very fluffy and yummy :)

I made these cookies but added in chopped walnuts and followed TAMMYSHAEFFER's changes. They turned out delicious! Fresh out of the oven I was a little worried because they almost seemed tasteless but once they cooled off they were fantastic. The soft texture is a treat and the aftertaste made me want more and more and more! My friends were also very impressed!

I had some bananas in the freezer to use up, and didn't want the standards, muffins, bars, or bread, so I chose this recipe.  I made as written, but used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of some of the AP flour.  This tasted wonderful, but were very cakey for a cookie.  Will make again!!  Thanks for sharing!!

My 7 yo rated this at this point, because I am fasting.  He loved it; he told me it was not too sweet, which is exactly how he likes it.  Only things I changed was reducing baking powder to 1 1/4 teaspoons and only had 1 egg.  They certainly smelled good. He also loved the cake-like texture.  I will now use this to use up my old bananas occasionally instead of my banana bread recipe.  Thank you!

These are yummy! I only used 1 tsp of baking powder and they turned out good. I also changed the temp to 350 and baked for 15 minutes. I think they are more of a muffin top than cookie though but are delicious whatever you label them! I would've rated them a 5 if the original recipe didn't say 400 degrees (they would've burnt at that temp)

As suggested, I reduced the baking powder to 1 t. and used 1/2 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar.  Perfect!  I just need to stop eating them long enough to get them into the cookie tin!

Loved this as did my kids!  Did not have baking powder on hand so didn't use it - didn't need it!  Used 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar.  Was very good - wasn't cakey to me!

I really like these cookies, I will be adding this recipe to my book. I did change a few things though: I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp banana extract,and I cut the chocolate chips down to 1 cup. Great recipe for sure :)

Not as good as I expected.  I prefer a chewy cookie, this was more puffy, cake-like.

This recipe really suprised me!  It was very good.  My kids loved these cookies too.  I only had two cups of flour left so I threw in a couple packets of Kashi Maple Brown Sugar Oatmeal in with the flour(making banana oatmeal choco chip cookies).  I also only had one stick of butter and 3/4 c. mini choc. chips but they came out really good.  Mine got a little crispy on the edges and soft in the middle.  Baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  They are very much like a "muffin top".  Yummmm!

I give it 5 stars - but I must admit that I changed a few ingredients! Living in Japan is often a source of frustration when trying to find "normal" ingredients such as good chocolate chips!  I couldn't make a Costco run today so instead I added dried cranberries, white chocolate (chopped from a bar) and walnuts!  The result was FANTASTIC!!  I will make this recipe again for sure...tomorrow and the day after and the day after that and....

Ok, this gets 2 stars because I baked my first batch for 12 mins @ 400F, and they were so burnt on the bottom I had to throw them all away >:( My second batch turned out perfectly at 9mins @ 325F. Personally, I would give them 4 stars for taste and texture. Like others have said, they are more cake-like than cookie. Even with VERY ripe bananas, the flavor is quite subtle - you might want to add a few drops of imitation banana if you want a more pronounced flavor.

Very dry and little taste. I added a half cup of golden raisins. Took out of oven in 12 min. Probably 11 min. would of been long enough.

I read all the reviews before making these cookies and took much of the advice given by combining most of the suggestions. The changes I made are: 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 4 bananas, 1 1/4 wheat flour, 1 1/4 AP flour, 1 ts baking powder. I also included chopped walnuts (2 handfuls = 3/4 c approx.) with the chocolate chips. The cookies are more of a cake-like consistancy like mentioned, but very addicting!

My dad's boss has been baking us these "secret family recipe" cookies for years.  We've been begging her for the recipe, and this is it.  Add a bit of cinnamon to the recipe and sprinkle a little cinnamon/sugar on top for flavor.  These are yummy cookies!

Instead of adding the chocolate chips, i took 2/3 of the batter and added chocolate powder. I swirled the two batters together and it tunred out to be a marble cookie..it turned out delicious..

The cookies were excellent.  The only variation I found was the cooking time.  The first round that went into the oven came out burnt when I only baked them for twelve minutes.  Other than that, there were no complaints.

My roommates (both Captains in the Marine Corps) finished the entire batch in less than a half an hour, and then seemed surprised that there weren't anymore.  They are a nice change from the Toll House cookies, puffed up and very moist.  I will make these again!

This was a really good recipe, but the cookies seemed to fall apart really easily.  I added extra chocolate chips on my second try, and that seemed to cement them together better.  :-)

Unbelievable!  My babysitter and her friend ate 15 of them in one evening.  Too bad :(  I had to buy more bananas to let them get old! Will make these once a week at least!  Made tons of cookies!

These cookies were different for a change. I love anything banana!!! I did use mini chips instead of regular and brown sugar for the white. I think they turned out real good. I took them to work with me and I didn't stop hearing rave reviews from everyone. My boss kind of turned up his nose when I told them what they were. I just don't think he was much for the combination of banana and chocolate together. Oh well. I loved them.

A tasty soft choco chip cookie. Not having crumbs fall in my lap was a nice change from those crisp cookies we are all used to. The banana adds a certain something that everyone enjoyed.

Cookies are tasty, but next time I'll reduce the baking powder and sub brown sugar for 1/2 of the white sugar. Also, baking at 400 is crazy. I did my first batch at that temp and they burned after only 10 minutes. Reduced temp to 375 and baked for 11 minutes and they turned out well.

These cookies are actually delicious, I decided to take my batch and put it into three parts, the first one I did just plain banana cookie, as my oldest boy doesn't like chocolate chips. The second batch I did with a healing  huge tablespoon of peanut butter , And added peanut butter chipits . The third bowl was mixed in with chocolate chips as the recipe called for.

I turned my oven down because I found 400 was too hot as my oven cooks quickly, so I used it at 350°and cooked  the cookies for 12 minutes.

They turned out perfect, the plane banana ones taste just like a slice of banana bread and the other ones are delicious as well. The peanut butter is perfect in them

They are sooo delicious, just like a little piece of banana chocolate chip cakey heaven!!! YUM!!

The first time I made these exactly as written and my family loved them!  Yes, they are cakey cookies but seriously they are like eating chocolate chip banana bread but in cookie form. I did find that 400 was too hot with my oven, I lowered it to 375 and that was better but I was able to get great looking, nicely cooked cookies with an oven temp of 350 baking them for 10-12 minutes.

I made them again and added some variations: added in a few tablespoons of ground flaxseed, 3/4 tsp cinnamon and using half whole wheat flour and brown sugar in place of white.  They turned out great!  I love recipes I can play with and add in my own variations.  I will definitely make this as written and with my own changes when I feel so inclided!  I recommend!

I was surprised by the high temperature and long cooking time listed for these cookies. I baked them at 350 and they were done in 7-8 minutes. 
I used Reese's peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. Used 3 bananas..didn't measure them. We liked the cookies okay. I think adding some chopped walnuts might be good

These burnt for me after only cooking the 12 min @ 400*F on a dark cookie tray.  The non-burnt part tasted very good though...just need to reduce the cooking time and/or temp from what the recipe says.

These are really good.  Something different than using over ripe bananas is bread!  As others stated, I used 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Used 3 ripe bananas.  Instead of 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips, I used 1 cup semisweet chips and 1 cup peanut butter chips.  Bananas, chocolate AND peanut butter.  Yummy!

Delicious!  I did turn down the oven temp to 375 right before putting them in, and I only baked them for 10-11 minutes because I was using dark cookie sheets (and my husband is picky about brown cookies). I made no changes to the ingredients. They turned out cakey, moist and beautiful.  Normally my chocolate chip cookies come out flat, but these puffed up nicely and stayed that way.  They are not strongly banana flavored, but the banana may become more dominant as they cool (as I have only had them warm from the oven so far).  A definite keeper recipe for any black bananas no one will eat!

I used 1/2c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar. They were pretty sweet so I  will try reducing a bit next time. Definitely not a tradition cookie...more like a muffin top. I would suggest taking them out of oven after 9min. I would have burned them to a crisp if I left for the full 12-15 min.

After reading some reviews I also changed up the recipe, splinting the cup of sugar to 1/2 each of white and brown sugars. I also used 4 ripe bananas.  The first dozen out of the oven were a little more done for my liking do I dropped the temp to 375 and cooked them for 10 mins.  They were perfect.  This recipe only makes about 3dozen.  They were gone in minutes!

They just came out of the oven and they are fabulous!  Soft and amazingly delicious!  My kids were skeptical, but they loved them!  They are softer than other cookies, but not cake-like.  I replaced 1/2 the butter with applesauce and only used 1 c chocolate chips.  Per other reviewers used 1 t baking powder and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I will be making these more often since they are so much healthier than regular chocolate chip cookies...if those can be healthy.  :)

I made these cookies exactly as posted and found them to be quite delightful.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because they are not "to-die-for" in my opinion.  Never the less, my whole family found them good.  I never measure bananas for these kind of recipes, I simply used three old bananas that I had in the freezer.  Let them thaw while the butter softens and they plop right out of the peel.  I also baked mine on stoneware and made about 3.5 dozen total.
As to the type of cookie, these are not comparable to most chocolate chip cookies, but are more like fluffy old fashioned sugar cookies.

Thanks for the recipe.  We followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only change we would make next time is to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Just a little too sweet for our tastebuds.

My four year old helped me make these. They're more like muffin tops than cookies, but that hasn't stopped us from enjoying them. The banana flavor is very mild. I used a cookie scoop to portion them out and got about 36 of them.

I double the recipe but make the following changes:
use only 1 cup of butter, use 1 cup of brown sugar, half a cup of white sugar, and use 3 cups of bananas.  I add a bit extra flour if the batter is sticky.  SO TASTY!

The taste of these cookies is really great, however I cut the amount of sugar and butter in half, as the last time I baked these cookies they were much too greasy (for my taste).
I'd bake this again!

Okay flavor, but too cake-like for a cookie. Recipe might have worked better as muffins or possibly as banana-chocolate chip bread. If I make this recipe again I might try cutting down on the baking powder and/or baking soda to see if it makes these cookies less cake-y. Also, when I baked these, the edges got too dark almost to the point of burning, even after only 12 minutes of cook time. I would advise either turning down the oven temperature a bit, or lessening the cooking time.

My kids and my husband loved these. My only change was using margarine instead of butter and adding chopped pecans. It seemed that 400 degrees was too hot and my first batch burned on the bottom after 10 minutes. I turned the oven down to 350 and they were done after 14 min.

These have good flavor. But I was hoping for a bit more shape like a choc. chip cookie. They bake up pretty much exactly like how you plop them on the tray. I baked them for 12 min. They were golden brown and a bit dry for my taste. For the second batch, I flattened them down a bit with the spoon. I also did not bake them quite as long, I did not let them get brown, and they were much much better!

I was disappointed in how cakey these cookies were. Better name for these would be Banana Chocolate Chip Muffin Tops.  Took a long time to bake through that the bottoms got a little brown.

Very good, moist cookie.  I followed some other reviewers advice and did 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I also decreased baking powder to 1 tsp and used 3 bananas.  Will make these again, but will try adding walnuts.

I used part brown sugar, part white sugar and added 1/2 cup oatmeal (I cut back on the flour by 1/4 cupand also used an extra banana. They are soft and cake like but very yummy. Also baked them at 350 for 14 minutes.

These cookies were pretty good.  However, I cut the recipe in half to get 18 cookies and instead, I ended up with 2 dozen monster-sized cookies that were about 1 inch thick and 3 inches in diameter.  It was crazy!  They were also a bit too sweet, so next time, I'm probably only going to use 2/3 cups of sugar.  After all, bananas are naturally sweet.

these are like mini banana cakes!  light and fluffy.  i used 1/2 cup of oatmeal instead of 1/2 cup of flour to give the cookies some texture.  i also used 4 smallish bananas and pureed them in the magic bullet.  used less baking powder, as advised by other reviewers.  chopped up a few blocks of semisweet baking chocolate (all i had) and it nicely dispersed itself throughout the cookies.

Love it!! :) In my oven at 400degrees any longer than 7minutes the cookies would be a darken golden. If you like just a little crisp on the outside and soft in the inside, then leave for 8minutes. The recommended time would have burnt my batch! Just have a careful watch :)

Fantastic! My kids loved it, and it was a great way to use up the old bananas. My cookies turned out more like mini cakes...no problem with that, I love softer cookies. It's great knowing that they get some "extra good stuff" when they eat these. Definitely a keeper.

I LOVE this recipe! The only changes I made was the  amount of baking powder and baking soda. I removed the baking powder from the recipe completely and only put 3/4 tsp of baking soda. The cookies were very puffy with the original recipe and with the modifications it made the cookies flatter and more, well, cookie-like. Another simple way to make sure the cookies are more flat is to flatten the top with the back of the spoon before baking. Overall really great recipe!

I just made these cookies and they turned out awesome! I did however make a few changes in terms of sugar content. I felt like 1 cup sugar was just way too much to begin with especially considering 1 cup of mashed bananas AND 1 cup of chocolate chips going in the mixture. Instead I added about 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar. I also changed 2 tsp baking powder to just 1 spoon. The texture however is beautiful. Cookies are so moist, I feel like I'm eating chocolate chip banana bread but in cookie form. I will definitely be baking this a whole lot more!

These do have a nice taste.  They have a more cake like texture which is not quite what I had in mind but can definitely understand based on the recipe.  The reason they only got 3 stars is because I thought the sugar content was too much if you follow the recipe (which I did).

These were a hit! I took the advice of the other reviewers and altered the recipe ever so slightly, splitting the sugar so it was 1 part white and 1 part brown, and I added 3 whole bananas to make sure they had a strong banana flavor. Only 12 minutes and then right on to a cooling rack. These were eaten up so fast!!!!

NOTE:  I have a newer Kenmore Elite oven and I had to cut the temp down to 350 with a bake time of 10 mins.  It is a convection oven BUT I did not use the convection setting and as written the temp and time is way off, atleast for my oven.  I can understand why several reviewers have said the flavor was mild/bland if they followed the recipe as written.  After reading many (not all - I didn't have tons of time before two kids were due off the bus and ready for a snack) reviews, I decided if I was making banana cookies, they had better taste like banana so I opted for 4 medium sized ripe bananas.  I did cut the baking powder to 1 tsp as many suggested and for a little extra sweetness, I added some (about 1 tbsp) cinnamon and sugar I had mixed up for breakfast toast.  What resulted is a yummy moist sweet disc of heaven!  My personal opinion is as long as they can stay moist - bring on the cake like, muffin like, bread like cookies!  To note:  this recipe was so fast and easy, simple yet great flavors - the best kind of recipe a busy wife and mother needs!  Thanks to the author!

Great recipe to use up ripe bananas! I changed the baking powder to 1-1/2 tsp and the baking soda to 1 tsp. By leaving the temp at 400 and using small scoops (used small food scooper), the cookie comes out more like a cookie with a crisper outside and a soft mosit inside.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my cookies came out like muffin tops. My fiance said, "Remember what you did wrong, these are the best!!!" I followed the recipe, except I added a little more bananas than called for (I had an excess). They were AWESOME! And super-moist. Thanks for the recipe.

I substituted Hershey's cinnamon chips since I don't like chocolate. The cinnamon flavor worked so well with the banana. I also added chopped walnuts for some texture.

These are very similar to cookies my mom used to bake. Cake like cookies aren't a favorite of mine, but banana chocolate chip cookies taste so good as such. I modified the ingredients slightly. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour,1/2 white flour and used only 2/3 the amount of sugar (half white, half brown). I substituted half of the butter with half cup of applesauce which likely added the cakiness but worth the health benefits. Also I modified the quantity to make 27 and ended up with 70 cookies! They are kind of small but definitely large enough for little ones like mine. Thanks Evelyn!

I followed the reduced baking soda suggestions, added 1/2 tbs of banana extract, 2 bananas, used an equal mix of wheat and white flour, used turbinado sugar instead of white sugar, used the mini-chocolate chips, added 1 tsp cinnamon and added 2tbs of plain non-fat yogurt to moisten up the cookies. We absolutely loved them!! The plain yogurt really served to get rid of the "cakey-ness" that the 1st batch had (even though this wasn't bad). I personally like moist, doughy cookies and these hit the spot! My husband and I ate them all within a couple days and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next time we have over-ripened bananas! I have rather limited baking facilities so ended up making them in 1/2 dozen batches in a pre-heated 350* toaster oven for around 15 mins a batch. We also chilled them in the fridge over-night and liked them best a little cool. (It helps that the apt is pretty hot in the summer.) The first couple batches merged together but we cut them into squares and devoured them. :-D delicious! :-D

Good recipe, but not the best cookies, came out more like muffin tops, so I deiced to add about 1/4 cup milk and about 1/4 cup more white sugar, put it in a 8x8 pan and baked it like a cake at 350 for about 40 minutes.  I then made a butter cream glaze out of confectioners sugar and butter and iced it.  My family loved it, my daughter asked if I can make it for her birthday cake this year!

I used 1 1/4 cup mashed bananas and 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  Could not taste bananas.  Turned out to be a soft, very bland, chocolate chip cookie.

I would have rated this 4stars because it is delicious, but these are not cookies, or even "cakey" cookies.  They are mini, light, chocolate chip studded banana breads.  Very good if thats what you're looking for, but if you're looking for a cookie you will be disappointed.  Very good, nice banana flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

these were awesome! I used 2 medium-sized bananas instead of 1 cup, and they were great! they work real well if you flatten them with the back of a floured spoon. plus, i only cooked them for 10 minites at 400 f. I LOVE THEM!!!!!

Didn't like this one at all, i just made them because i had a couple of over ripen bananas at home. The cookies were too cakey for my taste even when i just used 1 tsp of baking powder. They come out better if you just use a small amount of dough per cookie and flatten it a little bit before baking.  I also reduced the temperature to 350 and baked them for nearly 20 minutes. They were still soft but not THAT cakey.

Even my son who doesn't like bananas loves these cookies!  I did as some of the other reviewers and reduced the baking powder to 1 tsp and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also used 1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour in place of some white.  Next time I will cut the chip amount in half.  There is just too much chocolate for me.
We will be making more of these.

I made these cookies a couple of weeks ago because I had some bananas no one was eating. Everyone who tried them liked them and my niece asked for the recipie(she's 10). My sister and niece made them last week and since they had so many ,my sister brought them to work. She recieved many emails from fellow co-workers asking for the recipe.

These cookies were a favorite of my dad's, but I lost his recipe....but here it is!  These are amazing!  I also like to make this in mini loaf pans and slice it for snacks.  This recipe works well for cakes, loafs, cupcakes or cookies, just change the temp and baking time accordingly.  You have to try it!

Too many chocolate chips are distracting from the banana flavour. Even when I increased the banana to 1 1/2 cups, the banana flavour wasnt strong. Nice cakey cookie though.

I was a bit disappointed. I'm cooking in poland and using the metric conversion. had to cook for twice the allocated time and they came out very cakey. Guess I'm more the wet and chewy type :-)

I thought these were good, but definitely they baked through at 10 minutes and 350 degrees. I used 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 semi sweet choc chips, which worked well.  next time i think i'll make these in muffin tins, which may require a longer baking time...

I made these exactly as written, except for baking time and temp.  I made them into bar cookies - and while they were good - they weren't great.  Next time - I think I will try substituting brown sugar for the sugar and maybe using a bit more vanilla.  Very banana-y and good - just needed a little something else.  I'm a big peanut butter fan, so I may even try adding in some PB instead of some of the butter...

These burn when baked at 400 for 12 min.
Very cake-like and nothing to rave about
as far as flavor.

Good cakey banana cookie.  I used half white and half brown sugar.  My banana's weren't very ripe so I added in a dash or tsp of banana extract.  They cookies did have a banana flavor.  My fist batch did burn on the bottom so I had to adjust the temperature.

I had to change it to metric as I am in Germany. Also I didn't have enough banana's so I added applesauce for moisture. I found that 12 mins was too much time for the cookies. Also add a bit more flour, as the cookies will spread out too much if you don't.

I love trying new cookie recipies but these taste more like a muffin than a cookie. I even added cinnamon chips and walnuts trying to salvage the batter some how. The kids loved them though.

These cookies were good. I read some of the other reviews and was happy to know that they turn out more like a muffin cookie.  All of my other cookies turn out flat and hard, so this is the kind of recipe I needed!  My co-workers really enjoyed them.

a great recipe to use up those dreaded brown bananas! Being gluten intolerant, I substituted 2 cups Rice flour and 1/2 Tapioca flour for the all purpose  flour. I also added 1 teaspoon of Xantham gum to hold the cookies together.
I too, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar  and used 1 tsp of baking powder, instead of the 2 teaspoons. The batter was more like a soft batter than a cookie dough, so I put my dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes to help firm it up a bit. I also baked the cookies for 10 minutes and they came out perfect. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

These cookies were awesome!  I omitted the butter and put in a total of 3 mushy bananas instead.  They turned out puffy and soft and flavorful and delicious!  I look forward to serving these in the future.

I only added 1 teaspoon of baking powder and I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar as suggested by previous reviewers.  The cookies are soft and fluffy, and they remind me more of muffin tops than cookies.  The consistancy of the mixture also seemed much closer to that of muffin batter than cookie dough.  They tasted good with the chocolate chips and a bit of banana flavour.  Yummy :)

Not the crispy edges, chewy middles type of chocolate chip cookies I like (more fluffy), but my husband loved the banana element, says he likes them better than average chocolate chip cookies as not as sweet.  Great way to use those ripe, frozen bananas I have had in my freezer forever. 4 smaller frozen bananas=1 cup mashed banana.

I followed the advice of some others here. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also cut the amount of baking powder and used 3 bananas instead of one. Still a little too cakey for my taste and I would use even more bananas next time--maybe 4? I split the batter and used chocolate chips in half and peanut butter chips in the other half. Yum!

YUMMMMMYYYY!!!! :)  These were great, I just finished baking them 5 minutes ago.  I adjusted the serving amount to 20 and put two banana's in the mix, but I will add three next time for more banana flavor.  They are moist, just chewy enough, but not cake like.  Perfect consistency!  For the sugar part I added half brown sugar instead of all whte sugar, I don't know if it really made a difference, but I love brown sugar so I always do this when baking. GREAT RECIPE!!!!

This is a really simple and extremely YUMMY recipe!  My only suggestion is to at least double the amount of bananas.  My husband won a cookie contest at work with this recipe . . . the cookies are extremely soft and moist!

I will make these cookies again and again! They are delicious.
I adjusted the oven temp to 355 and had to leave in a little longer because my oven scorched the cookies at 400, other than that the recipe is flawless and the cookies are delicious!
Thank you so much!

Like others, I did half and half white and brown sugar, and reduced the amount of baking powder to 1 tsp. They came out great.

Okay recipe. Had to make a few adjustments based on other reviews, including using only 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup white sugar, and a little over 1/2 cup of the semisweet chocolate chips instead of the 2 cups it calls for. I added a 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I used three very ripe bananas and that came out to a little over 1 cup of mashed. I always substitute vegetable shortening for butter in every recipe, so that was a norm for me. I reduced the cooking temp to 350 and cooked them for about 13 minutes.

They turned out delicious!!!!!!! I am very happy with this cookie and will use this base + my alterations again and again, but I will probably lower the sugar amount just a tad next time and see how that turns out.

VERY cake-like. I wondered when I saw the excessive amount of baking powder used if the texture would be odd. It was.
Not cookie-like at all. The 'dough' is more like a batter. The flavor was 'meh'. I won't make these again unless I alter the ingredients somewhat; not why I choose to use allrecipes site.

Not thinking, I used two bananas and didn’t measure.   Sooo. My happy accident = some delicious muffins rather than cookies. I lowered the temp to 350 and  baked for 25-30 min. Not my original plan but pretty tasty just the same

I'm only giving 3 stars because I wouldn't call these cookies. They are basically cookie shaped banana bread. I could have just baked them in a bread pan. I love banana bread and this recipe tastes great, but I really wanted them to be more cookie like.

10-16-19 Made these last night, my husband thought that they ok, nothing great.  At first I thought the same, but the next day I thought they tasted much better.  I think they r more like a breakfast pastry than a cookie.

I like the idea of bananas in addition to chocolate chips for these cookies.  But, like many other reviewers have said, the cookies have a very cakey texture, probably too much baking powder? Also my first batch burned because I baked them at 400. Baked the second batch at 350 and they were better. Could also use some more banana.

I followed other reviews and reduced baking powder, used half white/brown sugar, and used 3 ripe bananas. I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour as in the recipe. They are so good! Needed a few extra minutes in the oven as they're quite fluffy, but the extra time added a bit of a crunch to the bottom which is nice. Next time I'd want to try with even less sugar because they are quite sweet. Maybe use dates instead. Would definitely make again!!!

As mentioned by someone else, these are very cakey, not sticky or chewy. That was ok for me, but they also came out very bland. They don't taste bad, but they're kind of dull, and barely any banana flavor. I often do lots of substitutions, but as I hadn't made them before and need to bring them to an event, I went by the recipe exactly as is. I will try them again in future but will substitute brown or coconut sugar for most of the white, and maybe also use a more flavorful flour blend with coconut and/or almond flour. I'd also use a lot more banana. But they are fine to have as a simple snack with coffee or tea.

I had 3 very ripe bananas , so I tried this recipe. My family loved them!  Two changes I made though, I did turn down the oven temp to 350 degrees and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. You really do have to watch , because the tops stay very light, but the bottom gets brown quickly, so parchment paper works better for these. Also I did add 1 cup chopped pecans. Very soft cake like cookie.

Love this! I followed the comment to make 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar, and only added 1 tsp baking powder. 

I also changed it up by adding 3/4 c ground flax seeds and it just added a little presentation texture and feel and really liked it. 

Also did a batch with the flax, and added nutmeg and cinnamon for flavor and  a 1/4 c oil to make more dense and 1/2 c oats. These were my favorite variation. 

Really nice light cookie. Love making them small and bite sized!

These were very good.  Sophia didn't want to try them bc of the banana.  But she really liked them and kept sneaking more.  I used 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar.  *****The correct baking time for my oven is 7 min at 400 degrees.

OMG!!!! These were soooooooooo good!!!!!! The perfect cookie for my “Half Good, Half Bad” mantra! Bananas and chocolate are a great combination. I used cacao dark chocolate. I would reduce the cook time because some of the cookies came out a bit overdone on the bottom.

These were quite good!  Like a traditional chocolate chip cookie with a twist of banana.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a cup of crushed walnuts.  The were moist and crunchy.  I will make them again.

I followed the recipe. It's a nice cookie and a wonderful alternative to the usual banana nut bread. I will make it again.

LOWER THE BAKING TEMP...400° Is ridiculously high for cookies. I made 1st batch at this, and of course they burned. 2nd batch I baked at 350° for 12 min, they were OKAY. I am not blown away, but, they'll knock out a sweet tooth. I upped the banana, and chocolate chips. still, very cake-like, and not overly amazing. Used my too-ripe bananas, so I am happy about that.

Ce sont des galettes moelleuses avecune texture de gâteau. Pour donner une tasse de bananes, il en a fallu 3 petites. Le goût de la banane est bien présent. Elles sont à refaire pour utiliser les bananes extra mûres, cela fait changement des pains et muffins aux bananes.

Added 1 cup of Ancient Grains Oats.  This is what I would call a soft cookie (cakey).  When I dropped them by a spoonful on the pan I then used the bottom of a cup to flatten them a bit.   It was an okay recipe, may make again.  Made 4 dozen.

I read previous reviews and did half cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar and lowered the baking powder to 1 teaspoon. I also made these into a bar cookie. I baked them at 350 degrees for 25 minutes and they were perfect.

I used 4 bananas but they weren't extremely ripe so I ended up with very little banana flavor.  I'd try them again but will wait for the bananas to get very soft, mushy soft. Other than that, they were good.  Remember, MUSHY bananas!

Great cookies with a cake like texture. I followed others' suggestions and used three bananas and 1 tsp baking powder. We didn't add the chocolate chips, but instead put a variety of toppings on top (crushed candy, sprinkles, etc).

Great way to use up overripe bananas when you're bored with banana bread. I used bittersweet chocolate chips, which gave a nice deep chocolate flavor. I echo using parchment paper--the first dozen I did on a greased sheet had tough bottoms,  My oven runs a little hotter than the temperature readout says, so I reduced the heat to 390 degrees and the cookies were nicely browned in just ten minutes. So beware the time given here.

Well, I gave this recipe 3 stars because I think it could have been better.  When I made it, I adjusted some things, but the biggest thing that stood out in the original recipe was 400 degrees for 12-15 min -- I cannot see how this could not burn them to a crisp.  I typically make regular choc chip cookies at 375 for 8 min., so I tried these the same way and they were perfect.  I did make some other adjustments, though:  I used 2 large bananas (about 1-1/2 c.), unsalted butter (but added 1 tsp. salt), I used 1 tsp. b. soda and 1 tsp. b. powder instead, and bumped the flour up to a full 3 cups.  This made beautiful cake-like cookies.  Perhaps the originals are more dense?  I don't know, but I wanted a more cake-like cookie, and this worked perfectly.

The first time I made these I made them exactly according to directions. They were awesome and my family made them disappear! The next time I substituted whole wheat flour for part of the flour to add more texture. They were still good, but not as light. This time I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and they are still good! Whether you make them according to directions or with adjustments, these will be enjoyed.

These were awesome. I too tweaked the recipe by following tips from the reviews. Made it with half brown sugar and half white sugar, used 3 bananas and only one teaspoon baking powder. I added a little extra chocolate chips. It's delish!

I could hardly taste the banana and the chocolate. They tasted like flour with just a slight hint of banana and chocolate.

Recipe is very good.  It's like a cake cookie and would go great with coffee or teas. I only made one change, after baking half of my cookies I added walnuts to the last half.  Each turned out wonderful..,  fluffy and yummy

I like them but they are a little more chewy like. I made a double batch as I had 6 very ripe bananas that I needed to use. I also did 1/2 and 1/2 brown sugar/white sugar and actually cut back on the sugar a little. I didn't have any baking soda, so just used baking powder. I also baked at 350 and found that 14 min was perfect for my oven.

I followed the suggestions of past reviews and used only 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also only used 1 cup of min chocolate chips. They were delicious :)

I made these today. I doubled the recipe because I had 6 very ripe bananas. However, I only had 1 12oz package of semi-sweet chocolate chips, so that didn't get doubled. The only other thing I changed was that I used 1 1/2 C of white sugar & 1/2 C of brown sugar instead of 2 C of white sugar in my doubled version. Everything else I used as written in the original recipe, only doubled. I personally don't like bananas so knew I wouldn't be eating them. My spouse however loves the banana chocolate chip cookies that his mother makes. He said that these had sort of a synthetic taste to them. He did however eat 3 more after eating 2 and saying that, so I guess he likes the synthetic taste.  :-D  In doubling the recipe I was able to make TEN DOZEN cookies! Also, I baked them in a 400 degree oven for 11 minutes probably for the first 6 or 7 batches, and 10 minutes for the final batches. They were also baked on parchment paper. Hope this helps others!

My favorite kind of cakey cookie.  I split the sugar 1/2 cup each brown sugar and white. Also added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Yum!

I am pretty non-discriminatory when it comes to cookies, but these were pretty bad. I read what another reviewer had said about the cookies being too cake-like (not surprising considering  I can't imagine what they would have been like with the full amount.

I have an electric oven at at 400 degrees F these finished baking at 10 minutes and were nicely brown (not like the photo). They are delicious and my six year old thanked me about 6 times for making them.

Very cake-like and very tasty. I had 3 very ripe bananas, so I used all 3 for this recipe. For the chocolate chips I decided to use 1 cup semi-sweet, 1 cup dark chocolate to give it a little bit of that somethin'.

I would like to continue to play around with the recipe and try out some of the suggestions in the comments but I wanted to try it my own way unaffected by comments. I was asked for the recipe right away when I left them at my sister's as a thank you gift, the other half of the batch went home with me and I'm not sure if there will be any left when I get home from work.

For the future, I would like to try working with brown sugar to see how it changes the taste and texture.

I'm rating these a 3 start because I made them exactly as the recipe said and they were just OK. No bad, but not great. These have a very light flavor, kinda bland.  They are more like a muffin top than a cookie. Everyone in the house said they were good/ ok but no one wants me to make them again. After the second tray I had to lower the heat because the bottoms were getting crunchy/ crispy.

I did find the baking temp of 400 to be too high, lowered it to 375. I live at sea level in Anchorage, Ak. Also tried the 1 1/2 cups of bananas with a bit less butter and they turned out great. Couldn't stop eating them!

They turned out to be puffy and pale yet too brown on bottoms, dry, and pretty flavorless.

I love this recipe!!! It has been my go to recipe for cookies for a couple of years. Its perfect as is, but I like to add 1 tsp of Banana Extract if I'm short a banana, or they aren't quiet black enough for this recipe.

I only tried this recipe because I had 3 bananas that were going bad and thought it seemed easy enough.  I have to say that I would not really consider these a cookie.  They look and taste more like muffin tops.  My kids liked them but I found them lacking in taste.  I followed the recipe exactly so I guess they are just not to my liking.  I will probably not use this recipe again.

I just made these cookies today and everyone loves them!  I followed the ingredient list exactly and did not change a thing.  The only thing I did do was to bake them for only 9 minutes instead of the recommended 12-15 minutes.   I also did not grease the sheets, but used a rubber baking mat that I had.  I will use this recipe again when I have the black bananas in the freezer to use up!

These cookie recipe is a favorite at my house!  I did change a few things.  I only put 3/4 cup of sugar.  I use "can't believe its not butter" instead of real butter.  I mix in the banana, vanilla and egg with a hand mixer and ADD a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the wet mix, and a mix of cinnamon, clover and all spice (add spices based on your preference)When all these ingredients are mixed together, then I blend in to the dry mix.  At the end, I add a full bag 300 grams of chocolate chip. also, if you like raisins, throw some in as well.

Don't cook these at 400 for 12-15 minutes!  My first batch was over-done at 12 minutes.  I lowered my temp to 375 and my time to 10 minutes.  I like a cookie to be slightly soft. These were delicious with the adjusted cooking time/temp. 
My modifications - used half brown sugar, half white.  Also used Reese's pieces instead of chocolate chips. I probably wouldn't do that again as the color came off the candy.  Regular choc chips would be better.

This is a great recipe for light and delicious cookies my kids love! I also tried substituting honey in place of sugar and virgin coconut oil in place of butter and it still turned out great!

These are yummy!  Batter was sticky, which worried me... But the end result is fabulous.  A cake like cookie with a crisped outside. My husband compared them to muffin tops.  He also told me to add this recipe to my book!

First of all, I put the first batch in for 15 minutes and they came out burnt. Second batch I put in for 12 minutes and even then the bottom of the cookies were a little too brown for my liking (yes I greased the baking sheet). I recommend using parchment paper. The cookies are very cakey, but good.

Followed the suggestion of 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and used 3 ripe bananas - Delicious!  Used parchment paper rather than greasing the pans and only needed to bake for 10 minutes. Got about 4 dozen soft, moist and flavorful delights. Next time will try adding chopped nuts. And maybe frost with chocolate icing or drizzle with melted choco chips.

I had some very ripe bananas that I wanted to use but I didn't want to make banana bread so I tried this recipe instead. The reviews are very accurate to the recipe. The cookies were cake like--similar to a sour cream cookie. I ended up using 2 small very ripe bananas and I felt that there was a lot of banana flavor. I was surprised how sweet the cookies actually were. These cookies were not bad, but I felt that they didn't really taste like a cookie. I didn't have much cookie guilt eating them because they tasted more like a health cookie, or  a muffin. Personally, I would prefer a traditional cookie recipe, and I think I'll go back to banana bread the next time I have ripe bananas.

I've been using this recipe for years...a family favorite for sure. I suggest that you use shortening instead of butter, and it doesn't have to be butter flavored. These also make great cookie bars, if wanted. So moist and tasty!! They never last long.

Very yummy, used 3 ripe bananas mashed (about 1.5 cups) for more banana flavor and cut back the butter to 1/3 cup. They are cakelike but we didn't mind that. Baked at 375 for 14 minutes and they came out perfect.

Always looking for different recipes for super ripe bananas besides banana bread. My banana bread is a favourite with family and friends but I wanted something new to try. These cookies are delicious! I did take hints from other reviews and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I added a bit more banana as well,  we really like banana in I our house. I split the batter in thirds,  some plain,  some with chocolate chips and added blueberry flavoured dried cranberries to the rest.  Everyone in the house loves them! They are like a cross between a cookie, a muffin and banana bread.  Excited to experiment with different additions. My teenage son suggested adding crushed pineapple for half the banana. Thinking I will be making lots of different takes on this yummy cookie!

Great cookies! Tasty right out of the oven, crunchy on the bottom soft on top. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, as well as only 1 tsp of baking powder as per other reviews. Very nice :)

So delicious, I couldn't get enough! Make sure not to bake any longer than 12min since they turn hard and be aware that these cookies rise a lot.

These were a little more cakey than I usually like my cookies to be, but nevertheless they were a great use of the old bananas sitting around in my kitchen. If you're looking for a crisper cookie, this recipe is not for you.

Yes these cookies did turn out cakey but they turned out wonderful. I added about five small ripened bananas. I also put in a couple scoops of peanut butter. I would add some ground-up nuts and maybe some seeds next time.  They would make a great breakfast cookie.

This is fantastic! I didn't have sour cream and I had promised my class banana bread so I went searching and found these! I wasn't sure at first because there wasn't any brown sugar (which is needed for a real chocolate chip cookie) so I put 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It turned out good and I am confident my class will agree. One of the best cookies I have had.

Opted to make these into bars - spread the batter in a greased 13 x 9 pan and baked at 375 for 35 minutes.  Turned out great!  As others suggested I reduced the baking powder to 1 tsp and 1 c of rough chopped bittersweet baking chocolate.  Next time I'd like to toss in some coconut too.

Switched to half and half whole wheat, decreased sugar and added stevia.
Added a half teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of cardamom and increased the baking soda by a hair. I reduced the chocolate chips slightly because sometimes with smaller cookies the chips dominate or fall apart.

I know,how can I rate a recipe when I changed it so much? They tasted great even though there was less sugar. Salt seems critical.

Thanks for a great recipe! My mother made these when I was growing up, and they bring back awesome memories. I used three super ripe bananas that I had frozen, I think that they were frozen may have added additional moisture that made them need to cook slightly longer... I read so many people saying they were burning... And I don't get it. I listened to reviewers and cooked the first batch at 350 and the cookies took 20 minutes! 400 degrees was perfect... You just need to use a light colored pan, not one of those heavy dark ones. And this is a cookie that is MEANT to be cake like! That should be clear from the ingredients... Just don't eat this with expectations of a "normal" chocolate chip cookie, its not supposed to be that, no matter how badly you want it to be. DELICIOUS!

Delicious recipe. Very easy to make. However, I think 15 min of baking is a little bit too long. I baked the first tray of my cookies around 13 min and found then to be a bit over baked. I adjusted to 11-12 min and it went well. The cookies were softer than I expected, but the flavor was great. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was better and the banana flavor was more obvious .

Just a bit too cakey for my liking - but the kids loved them.  Followed recipe exactly.

Just made these and they were pretty good.  I read many reviews and made the following changes.  1/4 tsp baking powder, brown sugar instead of white, 1 egg, 1 cup of chopped nuts.  I used a silpat on a dark cookie pan so I lowered the temp to 350 and cooked the full 12 min.  I also flattened the dough before baking to make them less cake-like.  Tried the first batch and thought it a little "flat", so mixed in some chunky peanut butter.  They were much better.  This makes a lot, I got 7 dozen using a small cookie scoop.  I am sure my grandkids will love them.

These turned out very cake/muffin like, but have I nice flavor. I prefer less cake like cookies, but these are still pretty good.

Changes I made: 1 t baking powder, subbed 1/4c nectresse for the sugar, used 1.5 c all-purpose and 1 c whole wheat flour, used 2 bananas (slightly less than a cup mashed), added a small splash of almond flavoring, and used 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and 1/4 c sweetened coconut flakes instead of semi-sweet chips. I also let the batter sit in the refrigerator for a while to make it less sticky.

Very good cookie if you know what to expect.  Most reviews were similar with my results - a very cakey kind of cookie.  It might make a good muffin.  I also split the sugar half and half between white and brown. And I turned the temp down to 380 and took them out promptly at 12 mins.  Walnuts were a nice addition to half my batches.  Oh, and I used mini chips so every bite had a bunch of chocolate, yum. Very good with coffee or a glass of milk.

I love these cookies! HOWEVER DO NOT BAKE THEM AT 400! The bottoms burn/were too done for my liking. Maybe 350-375. Anyway, that being said I followed the recipe exactly with the addition of 1tsp banana extract! I did use very ripe bananas, but I feel like the extract really kicked up the banana taste! Great recipe though! I loved the cakey consistency.

Per other reviewers' suggestions ~ decreased baking powder to 1 1/4 tsp, increased mashed banana to 1 1/2 cups, and used milk chocolate chips. Changed baking temp to 375 degrees which seemed to cut down on the over-browning cookie bottoms. I think I will try parchment paper next time to reduce burning potential. Very yummy though and will make again. Thanks!

I made a few alterations...  1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup loose brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup chocolate chips.  I also substituted a mix of different gluten free flour for the regular flour.

Id like to start by letting ya know this is a puffy cake cookie, much like banana bread, but do NOT cook them at 400, did the 1rst batch at 400 for 12 mins they started to turn black, so bake em at 350 for 12 mins then perfect golden brown....and only grease if its a non stick pan, and I used marg as its cheaper and better, in my opinion.

Loved this so much that I made a second batch for my daughter in law who has to eat gluten free (I used a gluten free flour mix that has all of the necessary additives).  It is as yummy as the others.  I did use the suggestion of 1 tsp. baking powder.  And I used 1/2 C. white sugar and 1/2 C. raw brown sugar.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweets. I will make these again!

The first batch just came out and they are just about finished!!!  So yummy!  I substituted 1/2 cococut flakes for 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips and I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar as others have mentioned.   I might add some oats to the next batch!!

Great recipe although I found after 11 minutes they were getting very brown on the bottom.  I also used less baking soda and half chocolate and half peanut butter chips.  Next time I would adjust to 375 degress.  Very tasting though!

Just baked these, they only took 10 minutes.  Definitely cake-like.  I used 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. banana, next time I would use all banana.  My bananas (3 medium) were not completely brown, but covered in brown "freckles" and very soft.  Still not much banana flavor.  Also, you need to really make the bananas into mush, if there are any chunks they will burn.  I got about 65 cookies.

Wow. These are great! They remind me of little muffin tops, so if you're not into chewy/cake-like cookies...these are not for you. I also halved the baking powder, did 1/2 cup white sugar; 1/2 cup brown sugar and I added 3 very ripe bananas (I didn't measure). I left my oven at 400 and baked them for 12 min on my stoneware, which generally adds more time onto my cooking time...so, for me, the oven temp was good. If you're using a reg cookie sheet- maybe turn the temp down. Thank you!!

These are cakey cookies--which are very good, but I was glad to have the heads-up!  I also used 3/4c. sugar and substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips for peanut butter and chocolate chips.  Very yummy!  My kids keep coming back for more.  A nice alternative to banana bread when you have ripe bananas!!!

I baked these cookies, I followed the recipe thoroughly but it turned out like a lumpy and soft pancake. I don't know what has gone wrong. I altered 1 cup white sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. However, the cookies taste great but they are too soft to be called cookies :( I will try again and see how they go. Any tips?

These cookies taste Amazing.  They are very moist, yet not as fluffy as a muffin.  I followed the suggestions from others, used only 1 teaspoon of baking powder and also split the 1 cup of white sugar to be 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also used 3 ripe bananas.  I also added a cup of oatmeal.  Very Yummy!!

These are delicious.  The only change I made was cut down on the sugar to 1/2 cup and used homemade lard instead of butter.  They were more like a thin cake rather than cookie.  I could even see them as mini muffins, but however prepared they were delicious.

this was a really good recipe, the cookies definitely came out more cake like than cookie like.  They were real soft but not chewy and gooey (like I usually like them to be).  I like to have fun with baking so I added coconut and walnuts and it was awesome.  The banana flavor was minimal though, so next time I'll probably use an extra banana ( I used 2 ripe medium bananas) and let them ripe a little longer.  I used round table spoon fulls and yielded about 40 cookies. Will definitely use this recipe again!

p.s. don't put cookies on bottom rack, could make them burn at the bottom too quickly

I veganized this recipe, using shortening and egg substitute NOT the greatest. 

I am sure the regular version is fine so I gave it 4 stars. Although, like the original recipe, these cookies cam out muffin/cake-like. Not my idea of a cookie.

I am a sweets person all the way, and cookies are my favorite sweet treat.   I used milk choc chips, but otherwised follwed the recipe.  I must say, these are WONDERFUL.  They are not overly sweet or rich and the banana flavor is perfect, not over-powering.  The texture is more muffin-like, but I don't think I would change a thing because removing the b.powder could leave them greasy.

I've made this recipe a few times and its great! They're almost like minicakes or mini muffins. My husband and boys love it! You get the sweet tooth satisfied with these delicous cookies!They turn out soft and dense however you may want to watch the baking time depending on your oven and baking dishes. I found that 11-12 minutes is perfect for air bake pans.

These aren't amazing, but aren't at all bad. They were tasty fresh from the oven, warmed up, or cold! I really liked these for breakfast since I always want something sweet. & I really liked the texture of these. As someone else mentioned, it really is like banana bread with chocolate chips.

400 is way to hot for these cookies.  I made my first dozen an the specified time and heat....burned the bottoms.  I turned down to 350, and it was perfect.  The taste of these cookies was just ok....they need some work, and some tweeking...maybe it was just not my taste preference. I might try again....but with some modifications.

I just finished making these cookies, and they are fantastic! I followed the advice of others, and reduced the baking powder to 1 tsp. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar. The last little tweak made was a request from the person I was making the cookies for - instead of using chocolate chips, I used mini peanut butter chips - DELICIOUS! Thanks for a great recipe!!

These are great cookies.  I was looking for a recipe to use up a couple of over-ripe bananas.  This is a great find!  I will definitely use it again.

these were gud but i wasnt knocked out by it.I love the cake like texture which i look for when i incorporate banana's into my cookie recipes.However i think i may add more sugar next time,or more cocoa for extra flavor.It just wasn't sweet enough for me.due to my lack of butter i had to halve the recipe which still yielded a nice amount of cookies.

I have to admit that I was skeptical at first of the two flavors going on here.  But I really like banana bread and I love chocolate chip cookies, so I decided to try these.  They are wonderful.  They are a moist, cake-like cookie and both flavors come through very well without one over-powering the other.  I use mini chocolate chips so that you get a little chocolate in every bite.  Otherwise, make as written.

I did not like these. The flavor was not there. They were very soft muffin like ch.chip cookies. Hardly any banana flavor. If i try this again, im going to double the banana and add some cinnamon

These were absolutely delicious! I added some Pumpkin Pie Spice because I love it so much and that worked out really well. I had a problem with the heat. 400 was way too high, my first batch I threw away. Not sure if my oven runs hot or what but I turned it down to 350 and baked them for 12 minutes and they came out perfect.

I just made these cookies today and they are amazing! If you like moist, chewy, almost cakey cookies then you will like these. I can understand why some people say they don't like them, but I personally don't like really hard cookies that are like chewing on inch-thick peanut brittle. I like really chewy cookies myself, and these are a great treat! Thankfully (in my opinion) the banana flavor isn't TOO strong but it's what makes them chewy. (Maybe next time I will use a little less banana, to compromise in between traditional cookie texture, and this cakey one.) So, you could always add in a stronger amount of flavor extract... I used imitation rum cuz we didn't have vanilla, but it didn't influence it much. For next time, I have a hunch that Peppermint extract will give it a nice touch! Also, when I doubled the recipe, it was such a pain trying to figure out 2/3 cup (5-1/3 tbsp) x2 butter which was Almost 3 sticks but not quite, so I just threw in the three sticks. To account for the extra butter, and in the end it seemed a little runny of a batter anyway, so I added one extra cup of flour. Usually my "experimentation" blows up in my face, but this time it turned it simply wonderful!! Oh, and I also used half & half white sugar & brown sugar too.  I dunno about the rest of my family, they are picky and haven't decided yet, but this is definitely MY new favorite cookie!! Thank you!

This recipe is awesome!  I used 1/2 butterscotch chips and that worked great.  They have a banana bread type texture which was what I wanted so we loved them.  Some reviews say there was not much banana flavor but I thought it had plenty.  It basically tasted like my favorite banana bread, but a bit yummier!

I used half brown and half white sugar, like many of the reviewers suggested. I mostly blame my terrible oven, but I got a bit mixed results each time I made this. Also, as many people have commented it's more like flat muffins than cookies. But delicious nonetheless. =) Thank you for sharing!

These cookies are very good. I added a good cup of walnut pieces. Used half brown and half white sugar and 3 bananas. I ended up with 30 cookies. They are great for the office! Thanks!

Delicious! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup white. I also took the recommendations of the other reviewer and only used 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown. Great banana flavor!

Awesome!  I took some of the suggestions...I used half brown and half white sugar, 3 bananas and only 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  I also added 1/2 cup sour cream...they were awesome!  I make a muffin similar to this so my kids thought this was a dream come true...a cookie that tastes like their favorite muffin!  Thanks for sharing : )

making these right now and the first batch just came out of the oven.  I can't wait for them to cool, so I ate one and ohhhh yummmy!!  I plan on frosting them with a peanut butter frosting.  I also changed only the flavor of the chips.  I used Dark Chocolate chips.  Super good!!

4.5 actually. I usually like the crunchy cookies, but these cake-like cookies are delicious! Will try with peanut butter chips next time. My sister-in-law said these were the first baked good with bananas in it that she's ever enjoyed. Will make again!

Made these exactly as printed and took them to Senior Citizens group.  A huge hit with all. Loved the fact that they were soft. Much preferred to crisp cookies.  Thanks

These were very good cookies.  After reading the reviews, I made the following changes... 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  They turned out very cake like with just the right amount of banana flavor.  Will make again with the above changes.

These were really good. I also used the parchment paper, no clean up, yeah! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, along with 1/2 cup white sugar. I only baked mine for 9-10 minutes until done.  Am thinking of having these for breakfast tomorrow morning. :)

I think these cookies are pretty good and despite most ppl bashing the more cake instead of cookie like appearance, I like how theyre something different that still tastes good enough to dump in milk!!!  HOWEVVVERR...the only things Iwould change is using 3 ripe bananas and add a couple spoonfuls of sour cream to the final batch so they dont come out too dry like mine did.

Delicious. Banana flavor is there without overpowering the cookie. We followed the recipe exactly except for sprinkling a little cinnamon on top- yummy! The cookies are full and cake-like.

I am sorry to give this recipe such a low rating because it is based on personal preference and isn't a reflection on the cookie itself. I have never had a banana chocolate chip cookie before but I had some bananas I needed to use so I decided to make these cookies. But I hated the taste of banana and chocolate cookie together. Some others tried them also and agreed it is not a good combination for a cookie.

Amazing cookie if you use Almond extract instead of vanilla, and use 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 butterscotch chips.  The almond extract really brings out the flavor of the banana.  I followed other reviews of using 1/2 brown sugar and only 1 tsp baking powder.  Results are a soft cakey cookie with a unique flavor.

I thought these were so fabulous! I love bananas & chocolate together & I had some ripe bananas to use up. Here's what I did differently though: Cut baking powder to 1 tsp, only added 1/2 c. butter, and I added 3 ripe bananas. I thought the flavors were perfect. These are cake-like cookies though but that's ok because they are very good!

This is my favorite cookie recipe! Delicious every time (I like the cakey quality).
Following the comment of some other reviewers, I made the following changes:
Split the sugar between brown and white
Reduced the baking powder slightly, to only one teaspoon.
Added a good amount of banana extract - Although the dough is always very banana flavored, much of it is lost when it is baked, so I add two teaspoons or so of banana extract per batch, and less or no vanilla extract. Finally, I use a bit less chips, the original recipe calls for too many in my opinion, and it overwhelms the banana.

GREAT RECIPE!!!!Made two changes: Instead of 2/3 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup. Added 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips instead of the 2 cup.  Thanks a lot for sharing this recipe.  It is my first one by the way.

Seemed more like tiny chocolate chip banana pancakes, but it still tasted good overall.  Will maybe add 1/2 cup more bananas next time to really get the banana flavor

I am in the process of baking these off and needed to write a few notes of the changes I made.  I used (same amounts)cake flour instead of AP and butter flavored Crisco instead of butter.  I added about 1/4C finely chopped pecans (will increase this next time) and chilled the dough overnight (even for 1 hour is fine).  I used a medium PC scoop so each cookie was uniform in size (even baking) and the result was a delicate cookie with a great banana & chocolate flavor. My new favorite way to use up 2 very ripe bananas for my cookie monster family.

These cookies were just average. I used 3 ripe bananas, but was still disapointed with the lack of banana flavor. Also, the texture was way to cake-like for my liking.

These were ok, but I would try using banana extract or flavoring instead of vanilla because the chocolate chips completely overpower the banana I could barely taste it and wouldn't have known if I hadn't been trying to taste it in there. Maybe a little less on the chocolate chips, or smaller chocolate chips? I used Ghiradelli, and while tasty, these are large chunks, with a very strong flavor. This was a nice, cake like texture cookie though.

Two cups of chocolate chips was bit too much. I thought I was eating a chocolate chip bar   more than anything else. Also, the cookies seem to get stale easily. Otherwise, its a good cookie recipe. I will try to see what it will taste like with less chips or no chips at all.

I like these and disagree with the earlier review that the banana flavor is too subtle.  If you use overripe bananas, the flavor is very pronounced.  They should definitely be called muffin tops instead of cookies.

The kids love these! They're quite cakey but that's what baking powder does. The flavor is wonderful. I substituted milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet. Delicious!!

I love their taste and....omg!!my house smelled so well!!! but i actually prefer crunchy cookies, this were cake like. I love nuts so I added 1cup chopped walnuts and just 1cup chocolate chips, probably next time i may not use chocolate and try to add some almonds and hazelnuts.

I made the recipe exactly as is, except with about three large ripe bananas for the one cup it calls for.  I did, however, drop the temperature down to 350 degrees and baked for about 18-20 minutes (I made them large and added more banana).  They turned out wonderful!  They have a beautiful light color, with slightly brown edges, and taste just as delicious as they look!  Very moist, as well, and taste better the day after!  Our family loves them!  :)

I made these for a church picnic this past weekend. They were very muffin like, which was something different for a change. I am more of a crisp crunchy kind of cookie girl. But the thing I think I liked best was that they had a very healthy feel to them. The oatmeal and banana made it feel like I was eating a healthy treat, even with the chocolate chips. I think next time I may use raisins andn nuts and ommit the chocolate for an even more healthy feeling treat!  I liked, but didn't love them, only reason was because like I said I like a crispy cookie myself. But they were still good all the same.

Like everyone has said, these cookies are cake like, and the oven temp seems to be slightly off.  They do, however, taste very good!

These cookies are very "cakey".  I realized I didn't have any chocolate chips so I added white Ch. chips.  They all went fast but I was expecting more of a cookie.

I give three stars because this really shouldn't be called a cookie.  It is more like a mini banana cake.  The flavor isn't lacking-it's just weird to eat a cookie that actually tastes like a cake.  For me it isn't a keeper recipe-maybe make in mini muffin tins instead.  Bottoms do brown very easily. Be careful. I did bake at 375 for 14 minutes on the upper third rack of oven. The next day they were even worse because having them in an air tight container-they became too soft and yucky! Thanks anyway but I'll stick to just bread or muffins with bananas.

Delicious!  I was looking for a recipe to use up one banana after making a loaf of bread.  I halved the recipe since I had just one banana.  I used 1/4 cup of butter, did 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 white sugar.  I further reduced the baking powder (1/2 tsp).  Turned out soft, puffy, I'd say better texture than a muffin - cakey but better than cake!  I ate two right away when I got the sheet out of the oven- yum!  Good way to use up some banana!

Excellent fluffy cookies.  Two bananas will get you 1 cup.  !!You only need 1/2 cup of butter, if you're watching your health.

Very good cookies...more like muffins or tea cakes.  Great banana flavor (I used 2 very ripe frozen bananas).  I used raw sugar and half white/half whole wheat flour and used mini chocolate chips.  I only needed to bake 10 minutes...12 resulted in dry cookies.  Made about 4doz.  My boys loved them.  Will make again if they ask me to!

These are really yummy!  They are soft and have a cake-like texture - my favorite type of cookie!  The flavor is really good too.  I used about 1-1/4 cup of mini-chocolate chips and that worked very well.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange.  I liked them but you have to make sure the bananas are very ripe.  The cookie came out a little like a muffin, rather than a cookie; which I liked.

Such a good recipe!  The cookie felt more like a cake though, it definitely reminded me of a muffin top.  So if you like the combination of banana and chocolate, this is definitely the perfect recipe!

The cookies are EXCELLENT. I ate about five right when they came out of the oven. I used two very ripe bananas that were compressed when I picked them up gently, no baking powder (because I didn't have any) and 1 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, because I love the smell so much. I mixed them on high for a few minutes right after I put in the broken up bananas to get some air in them. They were absolutely amazing, with a perfect blend of banana and chocolate. I don't think you will be able to keep them in your kitchen for long.

I used 5 Tbsp. margarine and found that they came out light and fluffy, like little muffins. I prefer that over a dense cookie, although you may not.

A good and flavorful use for overripe bananas.  An alternative to banana bread or banana muffins. The cookies are are moist and cakelike. The chocolate chips make these special.

This is an unusual cookie, cake-like as many others said. Kids loved it though- I only used 1 tsp baking powder, and used 1 t baking soda (this was an accident but they turned out ok!)Also threw in white and chocolate Callebaut chunks in place of chips. They also seem to take on whatever shape they take when you drop them on the pan- use a rounded tablespoon for nice shape. Baked these on my stone, as I do all cookies and it worked well. Won't likely make again unless requested by the kids, it was just not nice dough to work with.

These were OK.  I think I was expecting more of a traditional chocolate chip cookie, so I was a little disappointed with how they turned out--which was more of a cake-like or sugar-type cookie.  I did like the banana flavor because it made the cookies a little different tasting and the banana flavor wasn't too overpowering.  However, since I prefer the traditional chocolate chip cookie texture, I'll be sticking to those.

These are not cookies... they are muffins!  My sister made a big batch of these to surprise me last night, and boy were we ever surprised.  Instead of a crispy-on-the-outside and chewy-on-the-inside cookie we were anticipating, we ended up with big, puffy muffin globs.  That didn't stop us from eating them.  They were good for breakfast, too!  I would recommend that if you are looking for a cookie recipe, you might want to keep looking.  Right, sister???

I baked them for 9:50 mins instead of the times on the recipe and found them to be great.  I also used chocolate chunks.  Next time I will add more banana. Great Cookie.

I used mini chocolate chips and I wish I had only used 1 cup.  Too chocolately...and I love chocolate.  I think they would have turned out better if I had used 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped walnuts.  They are not bad, but not great.

My son loves these cookies!  A friend of ours makes almost the identical recipe, so he was excited that I had learned how to make her cookies.  The banana flavor isn't strong at all.  If someone would like a more pronounced flavor, I would suggest adding more bananas.  The baking powder makes these cookies much more cakelike.  Not your traditional chocolate chip cookies, but a staple now at our house!

My children loved this recipe.  It's very easy and a good way to get rid of ripe bananas.
