Great cookies! I have been using this recipe for years, - but there are a few tricks!!!    Cream butter, sugar, add vanilla then milk.  Stir well, add cherries and pecans (don’t stir until you add the dry ingredients))    Mix dry ingredients in another bowl… then add a bit at a time to the wet mixture while you stir.  Once you add the last bit - knead the dough with your hands.  If the dough doesn't stick well, add a tiny bit of milk at a time until you get a good form.    Break balls in half…  and roll into 3 inch logs, then roll the logs into the coconut (if you want a better coating of coconut… brush the outside of the dough logs lightly with milk before rolling).    You can freeze this for a couple of hours - then slice and cook, but it's best sitting in the fridge over night.    The tip to not get the coconut to burn, is to slice the cookies very thinly (approx 1/4 inch), and either line your cookie pans with silicon sheets or parchment paper.  Keep an eye on the first batch until you know the desired time!    Recipe says 375F… I say 350F! Check them at 10 minutes, then add a couple of minutes to that (if needed).  You want the bottoms golden, not dark - and the cookie should still be a little moist…  Leave them on the pan until they cool (they will finish cooking this way)

This is a great recipe!  I have been making these for a long time and instead of rolling the logs in coconut i just put the coconut in the dough.  It's much less easier to work with and tastes better in my opinion (coconut stays nice and moist).  My family loves these and my dad requests them every christmas.

I made this with a friend a couple weeks ago, but she uses chopped dried cranberries instead of candied fruit.  Absolutely delicious cookies!

I have been making these for years also.  I have never had a problem with the dough, but my version calls for ONLY 3/4 CUP BUTTER.  I always use real butter and freeze the logs overnight or longer before baking for easier slicing.  I also substitute chopped maraschino cherries (drained on paper towels) for the candied ones.  I may try cranberries one reviewer used.  The BEST part of the cookie for my family is the FINAL STEP I added.  After cooling drizzle dark chocolate in one direction over the cookies and then white chocolate in another direction.  It adds a lot to the taste and makes the cookies beautiful!

Excellent cookie that got raves from everyone who tried them!  I made the recipe a few days ahead (minus the nuts) and froze them instead of putting them in the fridge.  It made slicing them easier, and I just let them thaw for a few minutes on the pan before I cooked them.  I was worried they would be too sweet, but the combination between the candied cherries, coconut, and cookie was very nice.  I will definately make these again!

I love the way these taste, BUT the centers won't bake before the coconut turns very brown.

What did I do wrong?  I could not make this dough stick together.  Would not roll into logs.  Just fell apart.  Added a little more milk- still would not roll together.

Turned out great! i rolled the dough out on parchment paper then put the coconut on top of the dough and around it and rolled them out that way then just rolled them up in the parchment paper and stuck them in the fridge.

I've been making these for years!  Yes the dough is very sticky but I sprinkle the coconut on wax paper and shape the dough into logs while I'm rolling in coconut and then put them in the freezer.  After they are frozen I take out and slice for baking.  Great cookies!

Wonderful cookies, not too sweet.  Have used this recipe for years but had misplaced it.  Played around with the oven temps as everyone has there own theory of perfect temperature.  Definitely 12 minutes at 375.   Tried it at 350 and every 2 minutes checked it...it took a total of 16 minutes at 350 and was not as happy with the outcome at a lower temperature.   Next time will try and mix the coconut in with the dough and use dried cranberries, that sounds really interesting!!

I have been making these cookies for at least 5 years.  They are my favorite Christmas cookies.  I usually multiply the recipe x3 or 4 because the cookies are small.  They are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly and haven't had any issues.  I add the coconut to the dough sometimes to prevent singeing Santa's whiskers.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Thank you for posting this old fashioned favorite.  Thankfully, JJ, you posted this recipe here at allrecipes.  My daughter and I were thrilled when we read Tamaralynn's comments and suggestions. We followed them and the cookies turned out terrific!  Thank you, JJ, Tamaralynn and allrecipes!

I made these for Christmas because my son loves candied cherries and I can't stop eating them!  They have a great texture.  I used 1 1/2 t. vanillia and 3/4 pecans though.
