This recipe turned out great!  Definite crowd pleaser.  The only change I made was to chop up five slices of bacon and  fry them up in the pan first.  Then I removed the bacon pieces and added a little olive oil to the grease so I could use that to brown the chicken in.  Added a nice depth to the flavor.  Tossed the cooked bacon in when I added the vegetables.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, but I think I could have made it even better by making a couple of changes.  I wish I'd have had some fresh rosemary and oregano, but I lost my plants this summer in the heat.  I used one packet of Costco's organic boneless skinless chicken breasts and so cut the recipe in half which worked well.  I think you could start with one fourth of the milk and flour and add more as needed because I had a lot left over, and I went a little short on the seasonings.  If I'd have cooked the chicken for an hour, it'd have been way overcooked, so I was glad I took it out after about 20 minutes and covered it with foil to finish off the cooking.  When I was eating it, I kept thinking that a pat or two of butter in the wonderful sauce would have been perfect.  Next time I'll add that little bit of butter!    Thanks, CRawson!  We really enjoyed our dinner!

I love chef john's coq co vin but my son and wife don't, this recipe is different but very, very good.  Very few spices still provide a nice, complex dish.
