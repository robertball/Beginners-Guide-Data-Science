I wanted a breakfast casserole without all the bacon and sausage and this was fabulous! I used yellow squash and added some thin-sliced carrot strips to add more color. I added about 1 tsp of minced garlic when sauteing the veggies, and for those that aren't big on "to taste" directions, I used 2 tablespoons for the lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 1/4 tsp garlic salt. Had to drain a little extra liquid off the top when it was done cooking, but it cut and served beautifully! It was a big hit with my husband.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. The only problem I had is that after I finished cooking the veggies there was a lot of juice in the pan. I didn't bother draining it because the instructions didn't say to. The result was soggy eggs. I thought it was still pretty good, although could be 5 stars next time by draining the veggies before adding them to the 8x8 pan. Thanks for a great recipe!

Tasty, easy, and healthful. I used the recommended veggies, whole eggs (beaten) instead of egg substitute, and sharp shredded cheddar. Egg substitute would have been healthier, but I didn't have any. We liked the lemon juice/worstershire flavor, but also could imagine seasoning the veggie saute with herbs de provence or just play with different seasonings. It's a wonderful template for a quick, filling supper or breakfast.  Thanks for a great idea!

This is a delicious, versatile recipe.  First time, I followed recipe exactly.  Since then, I've altered it to use all my left overs - cabbage, broccoli, carrots and bell peppers.  You just can't go wrong with this.  What I love about this is, it doesn't rely on heavy meats and cheeses for flavor.  Combo of lemon juice and Worchestire sauce is very savory.  Great job!

We really liked this--kind of like a quiche without the crust.  The Worcestershire sauce adds great flavor.  My only change was to add a little mayo to the eggs to make them creamy.  Thanks!

I have been doing something like this for years. However, I do not cook the vegetables first. They are going to be in the oven cooking; I don't like soft veggies. I spray individual glass bowls and add my veggies then pour eggs and grated cheese over top.  These can also be cooked in the microwave very slowly.  Any vegetables you like and experiment with different cheeses!

I've been making a similar dish for years. Versatile enough for any meal of the day. The lemon and worchestershire sauce is a different combination. Go easy on the Worchestershire. It's an overpowering flavor that can quickly take over a dish, and in this dish you do want some of the flavor of the lemon to come out otherwise why use the lemon? A great brunch dish, nice enough to serve to guests.

I should have read all of the reviews before making this.  The lemon was way too much.  I threw the whole thing in the trash. The base is good and I would make it again without or with little lemon.

This is a great recipe! I made the recipe as is with no substitutions. I did drain the sauteed veggies before adding to the baking dish to prevent a watery texture. It was delicious and we make it at least once a week!

I followed the recipe and will do it again.  I did follow one of the reviewers who gave specifics for the amount of lemon juice etc. rather than "to taste."  Next time I'll go with "to taste."  Too much "W" and lemon for my taste. The major objection I have to this, and most other recipes, is the prep time.  I would challenge Emeril to do this in 10 minutes.  If you purchase decent baby spinach you are going to have 10 minutes just cleaning and chopping it. I'll just add 30 minutes to the prep time of all recipes and enjoy!

Made this dish tonight. Turned out great, love all the veggies, good flavor. I did follow the advise of others and drained some of the juice from cooking the veggies. Used real eggs (4) beaten w/ a little milk added. I did cook it a little longer 25 minutes. Great recipe will make again.

I loved the flavor of this recipie! It was somewhat watery though. I was wondering what might happen if I mix the sauteed veggies in with the eggs (or egg substitute)and mixing well before pouring it all into the pan, then topping with the cheese.  I really don't want to drain and discard that wonderfully flavored liquid.

I had been having trouble getting enough protein and veggies in my breakfast and this was a huge help!  I've struggled on a low carb diet because I got sick of eggs and I have to tell you it's he only thing getting me through!  That being said, WAY too much liquid and I'm glad I read the reviews to drain the veggies.  It's the only thing keeping this recipe from being a 5 star!

I was about to put everything in the oven when my wife came in, suggested we some left over seasoned ground beef in the mix. I was trying to keep it healthier, but I thought "why not?" It turned out fantastic! It's simple, fast, and very tasty! I just used this as a basic guide though. Used whatever veggies were around (squash, tomato, eggplant, kale, broccoli, cauliflour, etc.), and rather than hot sauce, I used a wee bit o' chili powder. Very easy to modify, and easy to please to family :)

Eggy Veggie Bake Haiku: "Should've been five stars. Lemon & Worcestershire, ick. Sad with the results." So I made this as instructed (oops, just noticed that I forgot the mushrooms!), but I put the sauteed veggies in a colander and pressed out some of the excess liquid b4 putting in a round, not square, baking dish. I didn't think the lemon and Worcestershire (I only used a scant 1/4 tsp.) jived w/ this at all. I think it also could've used minced garlic as opposed to garlic powder, and a bit more than 1/4 c. cheese. It has major potential w/ tiny adjustments, but unfortunately my tummy didn't do a happy-dance when eating this.

Yum!  This gets 5 stars for ease and tastiness!  I did everything as directed for the most part, but was sure to drain the water off of the cooked veggies.  Oh, and I used 6 eggs instead of egg substitute and added just a bit more cheese to the top.  I didn't add the cheese until the very end.  I beat the eggs with a little mayo and half and half.

This was very tasty, and was made on the spur of the moment this morning.  I had some leftover veggies (fresh and frozen)that I tossed together, along with 1 tsp of basil pesto. Didn't use the lemon juice, and just a quick dash of wor. sauce.  Perfect for a no-meat breakfast!

Nice & easy recipe, I used lots of green onions and green peppers in the veggie mix as well--you don't have to follow the recipe exactly, just put in whatever you like!  Real eggs are good too!

I bought a GTExpress about 6 weeks ago and thanks to this recipe, it has now made an appearance out of the kitchen cupboard.   I didn't have egg substitute, (haven't seen such a thing here in Scotland) so I used fresh eggs, it was a brilliant Saturday morning/afternoon brunch.   Thank you for sharing.  Sylvia446

I modified this recipe quite a bit with the veggies, but I followed the other ingredients closely.  We thought the worcestershire made the vegetables taste funny.  Might make again without it and substitute a different sauce.

Loved the recipe! This being said, I did change it a little. I substituted red pepper for tomatoes and broccolini for the zucchini. I also went very light on the Worcestershire sauce, (1/4 teaspoon) since it can overpower the taste of your food. I did not add any hot sauce and put only 2 tablespoons of lemon juice into the mixture. Besides that the recipe was super amazing! Make sure to drain the excess water from your veggies after you sauté them! (:


** Also did not put in mushrooms, but that was just because I didn't have any.
