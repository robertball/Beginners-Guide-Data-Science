Excellent just as written. By the way, "6 stalks" of rhubarb means 3 cups of it (diced or chopped), as a cooking standard.

This is delicious.  If you like strawberry rhubarb pie, you'll probably like it.  I didn't really taste the orange flavor, but that could be because I didn't have fresh orange zest and had to use dried.  Despite that, though, this cake is very light and refreshing.  I like the fruit and it'll go into my few beloved cake recipes of applesauce cake and carrot cake (I'm not a big sweets fan).  I used a bundt pan and it worked just fine.  Thanks!

This was very tasty!  At first I was thinking the fruit would end up inside the cake somehow, but it stays on the bottom - sort of like an upside down cake.  I haven't really baked with strawberries or rhubarb, and I was hoping the fruit would retain it's color somewhat, but it turned light pink - at first I was disappointed in the appearance, but it still tasted good.  The orange flavor comes through nicely - without being too "fruitcakey" - and compliments the strawberries and rhubarb perfectly.  Served with real whipped cream - pretty sure I'll make this one again!  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good!  The only change I made was to increase it 50% and bake it in a 9 by 13 pan.  I didn't even need to bake it longer.  It was sooooooo delicious that I had to pass it along to my Amish neighbor who is an excellant baker.

MMMMM...this was great!!!  I made it at work for a group of 20 people, I tripled the recipe and baked it in a full size hotel pan.  I needed 2 tablespoons of orange zest, but only got 4 teaspoons from the orange I had, so I used 2 teaspoons of orange extract to make up the difference.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger (will add more next time)to the flour mixture, and also substituted part of the all-purpose flour with stone ground whole wheat flour to up the nutritional value.  The cake did take about 20 minutes extra to bake. I think next time I'll bake at 375 instead.  I served it warm with a swirl of whipped topping on top.  Delicious!  *** I recently made this exactly as written and it was fantastic.  A keeper for sure!

My mother-in-law is diabetic so I completely replaced the sugar with Splenda and it turned out wonderful.  It would be interesting to see how that changes the nutritional info.

This was good, but too a little too sweet.  I had more rhubarb than the recipe called for, about 6 cups (and used a 9x13 pan) but didn't increase the sugar and still thought that I should've used less sugar.  I loved the orange flavor, though!

Very, very good! I recommend this to anyone who loves strawberry rhubarb pie.  The orange zest adds a little kick to this very moist cake.

Quite delicious! This was the first thing I ever made with rhubarb, and I was impressed.  I didn't have oranges at home so I substituted lemon zest for the orange.  I think the dish came out perfectly.  The crust was evenly brown, sweet, and crisp.  The fruit/sauce was mildly sweet and very tasty.  Thanks for a very nice recipe!

Very Good!  I mixed the orange zest in with the strawberry/rhubarb mixture instead of the batter.  It baked up perfectly!  I will definately make again! Great served with a dallop of French Vanilla Coolwhip! Thanks for sharing---Cathy H.!

I gave this 5 stars for taste.  It's a little messy serving to guests but once they taste it I don't think it matters what it looks like.  A great combination of flavors for sure.

There is really nothing I would change in this cake!  The only thing I did to make it a like more healthful was to substitute some of the white flour with whole wheat...they'll never know the difference!

I baked this cake as recipe called, but substituted dried orange peel.  Absolutely delicious!  My husband, small children, parents and relatives visiting from Europe had nothing but high praise for this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Was super-easy to make and turned out fabulous! 

I only had a 8x8 pan so I spooned some of the extra fruit and batter into a few ramekins and baked them alongside.  These turned out even better, since the crust got a bit crispy.

Loved it!  The orange zest gives it a fresh flavor.  Only problem is the rest of the family didn't really enjoy it.  Rhubarb, you either love it or hate it!

This was very good. Next time I will use less sugar, and possibly try substituting lemon zest for orange.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday, he was so impressed and grateful he was nearly in tears! The orange zest added a unique flavor to help make this a grown-up version of the birthday cake. I used a 9x13" pan and added 50% more of each ingredient (5 cups of rhubarb), per another reviewer's suggestion, and it came out perfectly. Every oven is different, so this may be irrelevant, but the cake was done 6 minutes early.

Yum! Delish and straightforward. In case anyone wants measurements in grams, just over 3 C of rhubarb was 400 grams and a smidge over 2 C of strawberries was 300 g. I decreased the sugar to a half cup and a half cup. Used oil instead of butter. Used 4 g of fresh orange zest, which is probably double the amount called for. Oh, it smelled so nice cooking!

This is Ex-Cell-Ent!  The orange zest in the batter adds so much. Shared it with my neighbors...they loved it. Will make again FOR SURE.  Don't change a thing.
