It tasted good, but my husband found it "weird". Anything other than what he is used to is "weird". The maple sure made it tasty, but the texture left to be desired - came out sugary (due to the use of maple syrup instead of the usual Karo syrup).

A complete waste of time and grocery supplies. I made this to take to my parents house for Thanksgiving and it was a disaster. The texture was unlike any kind of pecan pie I've had and the taste overall was disappointing.

This pie is absolutely wonderful!  The texture is unlike any other pie I've ever had, and for a pie lover, like myself, it's nice to find a recipe that's different.  I substituted walnuts for the pecans, and it turned out great.  Like maple walnut icecream.  This pie is better served chilled.

A great pecan pie that's not nauseatingly sweet.  Love the way the syrup melts in the mouth.  The original recipe comes out soupy so I add a little more flower and less whipping cream and butter.  With the right combo though it turns out great.
