Wonderful dish, I will definitely make this again. This was the first casserole I have ever made, it was very easy to follow the instructions and end up with a delicious meal.

Very easy to make. The kids had no idea the zucchini was in there, we have a lot shredded. There were no left overs. I also used long grain brown rice instead of white rice which my husband loves!!

Thought this had a really nice flavor! Oven wasn't working, so I just fried my veggies and threw all the rest in a pot on top of the stove, until rice was done. Had to watch it a bit more but turned out great. Didn't have chestnuts so added a can of bamboo shoots and some red pepper for color!

This dish is delicious!  We regularly have different group sessions in our home and this is a regular on my list to serve!  I will substitute cream of chicken for the mushroom sometimes, or use one chicken and one mushroom.  Still just as good.

Not worth eating again. Spent time purchasing items, prepping, cooking, and then eating. Just okay. So not worth cooking again.

Prepared as per the recipe and to be quite honest, it tasted really bland.  Don't think I'll use it again.

This is delicious in it's original form BUT it works great for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Chop some up and toss it in instead of chicken!

I traded the cream of mushroom out for cream of chicken soup. I shredded the zucchini, put in a cup of celery, and omitted the water chestnuts. Not necessary and you get plenty of crunch from the celery. Not your typical leftover turkey recipe but SO delicious.

I followed all of the directions and spent a lot of time making sure it was perfect. It was extremely easy to make but I couldn't eat it. It was way too creamy and the taste was bland. Maybe it was the mushroom soup or the mayo? I am not a picky eater at all but I couldn't stomach the taste and creaminess. My boyfriend didn't even want to eat it and he'll eat anything.

I doubled this because I feed 3 teenage boys - only had enough water chestnuts to make one. My family preferred the dish without, but still polished off both casseroles in under 24hrs. This recipe will go into regular rotation in my house.

My family loved this. i did make a few changes to accommodate my pantry and personal taste: i used chicken broth and brown rice instead of water, boullion, and white rice. Cream of chicken soup and 2 cloves garlic replaced the mushroom soup with garlic and added a 1/2 t of salt and a bit of fresh ground pepper to the saut√© veggies. thats it. So good.

I used green beans instead of zucchini. I did not care for them. Over all the dish was good but not great.
