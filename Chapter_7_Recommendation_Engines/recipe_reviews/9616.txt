I wanted a sugar cookie that called for cream of tartar specifically, as I like the light, sandy texture it imparts to cookies. I also wanted butter, not shortening, but not a combination of butter and vegetable oil. The helpful ingredient search identified this recipe and it was exactly what I was looking for. For what I had in mind I skipped the raisins, used vanilla instead of lemon extract and, in keeping with spring, added a cup of pastel-colored sprinkles instead.  As I mixed up the dough I found I could easily do without 1/2 cup of the flour, so I used 3 c. flour rather than 3-1/2.  I used a medium-sized scoop, probably about 2 T., and baked the cookies at 375 degrees rather than 400, until set but before they began to turn brown. Given variances in size and individual ovens, I'd say 8-9 minutes.  The cookies are pretty and crackly, soft (like Hubs likes 'em) but still a little chewy (the way I like 'em!).  Bottom line?  This was just what I was after, a quick and simple, attractive, soft, buttery sugar cookie!

These have a very nice, bright flavor. The texture isn't really my favorite though; they are more of a sandy cookie. The dough was super dry even though I soaked my raisins in hot water before adding them to the batter, which added a little moisture. They baked up well though and are pretty little cookies. The lemon and raisins are a nice combination. Thanks! :)

Loved the recipe.  However since I read the review of another reader I boiled my raisins in one cup of water for 5 minutes and after it cooled added the liquid and raisins at the end.  I received rave reviews from my friends.  Love the bit of tang of the lemon.
