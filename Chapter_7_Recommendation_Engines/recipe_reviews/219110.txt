Great recipe...I added 4 cloves of fresh garlic.  I think what really makes this over the top is...what you do to the chicken before the sauce.  Seasoning the chicken before they go in the oven is key.  I use, cayenne pepper, tex mex seasoning, montreal steak spice, salt & pepper and chinese five spice seasoning.  Make sure you add these spices to both sides of the wings, and oven bake these babies.  Make sure the sauce you've made and chicken wings are both hot when you mix together.  No regrets here, and no wings are either.  Happy New Year!!!

I was asked to make chicken wings for 2012 Superbowl party. I'd never made them before, nor paid attention to them at other parties. I found this video by Chef John & made them off the video directions, replaying it several times to get the gist. (2nd time see recipe) In the sauce, I also added his suggested 2 finely chopped/ mashed garlic cloves. That’s the easy part! (15 minutes? Make sauce after wings are baked.)
         I bought two, 4-lb bags of Wayne Farms frozen Wingettes (no tips). [8 lbs made 40 pieces] Thawed. Washed, cut off extra skin, seasoned & floured (30 min). Baked to very crisp in the oven, a 1 & a1/2 hr process @ 450 degrees, turning often.
          One thing I did was to place them small bunches, from oven to stove-top simmering sauce for 5 minutes. These few minutes soaked sauce into wings and I think was key to their infused, succulence. Arranged into two 7X12 Pyrex dishes so they could be warmed separately. Provided a water bowl with cut lemon for 'finger-dipping..."
           A chef was present at party who caters & owns a popular deli. She took a photo & emailed her boyfriend that he was missing “the best wings she'd ever had!”  [Helpful as I had no comparison]
          Now when making second time, I see that I didn't have to 'glub-guess’ the recipe from video! Hope they turn out as good as my 1st guesstimate.
         Wings were spicy & sweet-- but not too sweet. Absolutely delicious. Now, I will notice wings at parties & doubt any will compare.

I cooked the chicken wings my usual way- barely seasoned and naked on a lipped cookie sheet in the oven at 425 for about an hour.  Then I made this sauce and tossed the wings.  I made it basically EXACTLY as stated except used half the amount of sriracha- for the kids sake (but we had a bottle at the table for us).  This is a really great recipe!  I looked at it in the pan and thought it did not look like much so I doubled it.  MISTAKE.  A little goes a long way of this stuff!  Oh well, I will just use the leftovers for a slow cooker meal I think. (shredded orange chicken breast, anyone??)  Seriously finger lickin' deliciousness.

I made this to serve on grilled chicken. Once the chicken was almost finished, I glazed it with the wing sauce. Tastes great on a dinner salad!

This was a good alternative to chicken wings. Wasn't as spicy as I thought they would be.  Probably needed to add more chile pepper sauce.  I will definitely try this again.

This was very good, BUT I would highly recommend you taste it before adding the soy sauce. (By the way, the video and the recipe on his website calls for a TEASPOON of soy sauce, not a tablespoon.) If your Asian chili pepper sauce has a lot of salt like mine does, you won't want to add the soy sauce.

Chef John says in the video to use Sambal chili paste/sauce or any red chili sauce. I couldn't find Sambal, so I used (red) chili garlic sauce, which has quite a bit of salt. Because of that, I left the soy sauce out, and it was good. He also recommends you add a couple of cloves of smashed or finely minced garlic, which was already in my chili garlic sauce. 

I think next time I'll try halving the hoisin sauce, to let the orange flavor take center stage a little more. It was very good, though, and I used it on baked chicken drumsticks. It would be even better on wings, and it would be great on breaded chicken bites and steamed broccoli over rice (for restaurant-style orange chicken).

Easy and interesting sauce. I think much depends on the marmalade and hoisin sauce you use and whether you like marmalade in the first place...

Even though I tweaked it, I still gave it 5 stars. I didn't have the chili pepper sauce so I used 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes. Also added 1 minced clove of garlic as he suggested in his video. I only boiled the sauce for two minutes so I could reheat it later before serving and it not be too thick. There was enough sauce to put over Jasmine rice and some to freeze for the next serving of wings. I always do my wings on the grill, instead of the oven. I find it's quicker, less fatty, and more tasty. And on a day like today, with a heat index of 108, it keeps the kitchen much cooler too. This is a must try recipe!

I followed oven frying directions from Chef John's blog & followed the recipe with the addition of 2 garlic cloves. It is a lot more "orangey" than the lovable bear restaurant version, but really delicious. For less orange flavor I might go half marmalade, half Thai Sweet Chili sauce, but as is, my whole family loved these wings. They stayed crispy even after sitting in sauce for an hour.

Very good flavor with my oven baked wings! Only change I made was to add a couple cloves of mashed/minced garlic. Be sure to only boil or simmer sauce until SLIGHTLY thickened or you will have very tasty glue! I boiled it until it was near the consistency I thought it should be, then removed it from heat for about 10 minutes. It got thicker than honey after I took it off the heat. Can't wait to make them again and get it right!

great recipe.  I used Dynasty Hot Chili Oil which has plenty of garlic flavor added.  I cooked sauce a little longer & added juice from 1 mandarin orange & 1T of potato starch which thickened it nicely.  Perfect "Panda Sauce"

Before making wings last weekend, I rounded up a bunch of new sauce recipes to try. While most were just ok, this one was awesome! My husband was very pleasantly surprised. I'll be making this in addition to the usual buffalo sauce from now on. Thanks so much!!!   =)

Strong hoisin taste, but great. I tweaked with a little honey and some drops of chili and sesame oil. Served over chicken nuggets that had been breaded with Panko and fried in coconut oil. Yum.

I have used this recipe many times, truly love it! Have to say I only use 1 T Asian sauce. This is a keeper, I also just use it on breast cut into chunks! 
I use the oven fried chicken recipe from here as well! The one with the Italian bread crumbs.

Tips: John's wing recipes assume you're serving a crowd. In my case, it's just me. So I've found at Costco they have 'certified' (whatever that means) organic chicken wings in packets of 3, with 12-13 wings in each. So I can try out his various versions.

Also: I keep old washcloths, and when eating wings or fresh crab or ribs, I wet one in hot water and use it while eating to manage the sticky experience.  

Though I agree with another reviewer that his Ginger-Garlic Wings are better, these were darn good, too. I seasoned the oiled wings (before oven baking) with lots of garlic powder & powdered ginger, not usually my choice. But it added depth to the flavor. One could add fresh garlic & ginger, but then that would defeat the whole point. Next time I'll try adding some orange zest to jack up the orangey flavor.

Very good recipe.  Almost a little too sweet and needed a bit more tang or orange sour flavor.  I made three recipes from this site, and while we liked all, this was the least favorite.

We just did not care for orange flavored chicken wings. Sauce seemed more appropriate for a beef stir-fry maybe, with lots of other chinese vegetables.

Recipe was great! I've made it twice in 2 days! Just be careful which marmelade you choose. The first one I used was great, the second go around my sauce came out bitter because of the icky marmalade I used. Moral of the story: stick to what works!

Great recipe. I think I will add a bit more chile sauce in the future to add a bit more of a bite. But, I followed Chef John's description to oven fry from his Garlic Ginger wing recipe, which gave a good crispy exterior. I just need to watch the amount of flour I cover the wings with in the future, you could tell there had been flour on the wings when done (even though it didn't look it).

A little too much salt.  If you're going to add soy sauce, I would definitely half the salt in the baking soda mixture.  Other than that, another masterpiece from the chef.

I did Not add spicy sauce( i dont eat any spicy food). This recipe is delicious! I used 2 chicken breast diced ( probably enough for 4 chicken breast). Is well balanced sweet and sourness. I seasoned my chicken with adobo, fresh garlic and ginger. Browned the chicken first and then added the sauce mixture and let it simmer until sauce got thickened.  Very delicious!

WAY too sweet for my taste and I also cut down on the chili sauce. Added some minced garlic and sesame oil to try to balance it and more rice vinegar. I'm glad we just sauced our plates. I'll make something else for the leftovers and keep my orange chicken recipe.

Delicious!  I served this with a side of stir-fried veggies over rice noodles for a very good dinner.  The next time I think I will add a drained can of mandarin oranges in the sauce.

Made these for a Super Bowl party. Everyone complained about them having too much salt. I used John's Baking soda recipe for baking the wings. That just added salt . No one would eat them. Won't be making them again.

This is my go-to wing sauce. I threw a party and made wings with this sauce. It was definitely a crowd pleaser and a favorite among all the sauces I made. (I made 4 different sauces including this one) I did, however made some adjustments. instead of orange marmalade, I used a Peach/Mango  preserve I  found and added a touch of cayenne and a few cloves of garlic to boost the kick of the Asian Chile sauce.

My family loved this recipe.  I made three different kinds of wing and this was the first one gone.  I will definitely make again.  I did add a little more of the asian chili sauce to taste.  I am thinking this would also be goo on breaded chicken bites for a good orange chicken recipe.  Will definitely make again.

This sauce is so friggin good! I put it on some oven fried wings. This has made its way into my regular dinner rotation. The ONLY adjustment I make is to reduce the sambal by half. Amazing, sweet, spicy, sticky goodness. You'll be licking your fingers afterwards, wishing you made more wings!

Good especially on drumsticks or thighs. If you want spicier substitute normal vinegar and add 2 tablespoons of Szechuan, sweet chili sauce or Louisiana style hot sauce.

I loved it as is, but I added sautéed onions and garlic ( I love onions and garlic too much not too). Some one also suggested to season you chicken well- that's a must! The person suggested to use five spice Chinese season (sprinkles and more to taste of everything else too), tex mex season (couldn't find it), montreal steak season, ( I added) season salt, and pepper. Boy was this tasty!!! I'm adding the sauce to my pan fried (in olive oil, onions, and garlic) chicken, let it all simmer together, and reheat for dinner. Boy is this one tasty meal, or stir fry sauce!!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made if for the first time for Superbowl 2013. It was very easy to follow, plus the site allowed me to adjust my servings with ease. Everyone loved it. I even marinated pork chops in it, and they came out good as well. Making it today 3/30/13 for an Easter potluck for work. THANKS CHEF JOHN!
