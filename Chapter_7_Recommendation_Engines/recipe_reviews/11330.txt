these were delicious and easy once i did a little tinkering. the dough is very straightforward and could easily be used for chocolate chips or any other type of morsel you want to use. you could even substitute brown sugar for 1/2 the white sugar if you wanted and they come out well. i used fresh, sweet cherries, and i found that after grinding them in the food processor i needed to put them in a strainer and let the juice drain for about 15 minutes before adding them to the dough- otherwise it was just way too wet and the cookies came out mushy and turned blue. also, i found that the bake time was more like 18-20 minutes before they were a nice golden brown- crunchy around the edges and chewy in the middle- but that may just be my oven.

Although these cookies were tasty and a great way to use up my cherries, the flavor was less cherry and more sugar.  I didn't completely grind the cherries, just pounded them a bit and then let them drain as other reviewers suggested.  The chunks of cherries were delicious.  Next time I will try to keep the cherries more intact for bursts of cherry flavor. Despite the lack of cherry flavor, they were soft and delicious.  I actually think they're tastier the second day instead of straight from the oven!

Very easy, very tasty.  Great way to use up some cherries from the tree.  My husband says these taste like chocolate chip cookies minus the chocolate.  Dough keeps well in the fridge so you can make a warm batch when you want.

These cookies are yummy and very easy to make! This recipe is a great way to use up cherries. Just make sure to rinse the cherries well, or your batter will turn blue.

Hmm. Well I followed the recipe and they were just plain boring. No real cherry taste, more like a little gray sweet biscuit. Tried adding dark chocolate chips and it was still ok, tried adding m&m's, again just ok. Kids weren't interested so all the work for nada.
Oh well.

This was a good way to use up my cherries.  They all got eaten in one day and they were very good and soft!

There seems to be some confusion by the author as to the fruit actually being used in this recipe.  Unlike tree-born cherries, 'Ground Cherries', which are produced on bushes and are contained within husks, do not have pits.
Otherwise, it appears there is a mistake in the ingrdient description.  It's confusing at this point.
