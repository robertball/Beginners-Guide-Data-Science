Excellent!  I added 1/2# of bacon, and browned the sausage and vegetables in about a T of the bacon grease.  Will definitely make again.

Brown the sausages in oven=proof skillet; add remaining ingredients and put right into oven. Remember to leave this uncovered; the point is to thicken the sauce to be more like a gummy paste; sounds gross but tastes very good. I would make again, but my husband does not like baked beans any way you fix them.

I added a bit of diced jalapeno to give it a kick. Skipped the celery, just didn't seem to fit. 
Super, the kids really liked it!

DH liked this one.  I liked it okay.  The kids ate it but didn't rave over it.  I might have over dashed the W.shire.  I will make it again though.  Maybe used diced tomatos rather than sauce.  Thank you for sharing it.

I doubled the onion and left out the celery and used liquid smoke instead of worcestershire, since that's all I had.  It had a lot of flavor and only took a few minutes to assemble.

This was good. I liked the wine in it. It's a grown up beans and weenies :) Honestly wasn't a fan of the kidney beans in this but that was just me. And I forgot the celery :S Oops. I cooked this on the stove not in the oven. So I added 2T butter to brown the sausage and cook the onion in. Then added everything else and just let it simmer on the stove until it thickened up. :)

I adapted this a bit, since neither my husband or I liked ketchup and I didn't have canned baked beans on hand.  I used barbecue sauce and all navy beans which I cooked up from scratch.  Was tasty served with a side of garlic bread.

This was quite yummy. I had to alter it slightly due to what I had on hand, and personal preferences. I added a little more celery, black beans instead of kidney, crushed tomatoes rather than tomato sauce and only a little bit of red wine and ketchup. It was just sweet enough, but not overpoweringly. My picky 10 year old daughter ate most of what I put on her plate, and that is a miracle because I didn't think she would eat anything but the meat. As for cooking it, I added all the ingredients to a large cast iron skillet and cooked it on the stove for about 20 minutes before putting it in a 400Â°F oven for another 20 minutes and it came out very nicely.

We thought the flavor was good
 I made it in my crockpot for 4 hours on high. I have some recommendations. Cut your kielbasa diagonally into 2 inch pieces. This way the kielbasa keeps some of its flavor.  The half I cut into 1 inch coins lost all flavor.  In the crockpot, a lo>t of extra liquid forms. Even though I cooked it uncovered for the last hour, I removed a half can of liquid at the end. Maybe add less liquid, or using tomato paste instead of sauce would help. I served it in bowls with a salad and bread.,

ok--casual supper.  I cooked on stove top, preferring not to run a hot oven on a hot day.  Carrots seemed a better fit than celery.

I halved the recipe and had to make a couple of substitutions b/c I didn't have the ingredients. I used only kielbasa and omitted the red wine. I am sure it will be even better with both and I definitely a quick go to recipe! I mixed up the half cans of kidney beans and tomato sauce to freeze and use the next time. We'll see how this works!

Good to know what's going into your food, BUT the much easier way to make this side dish is to dump a couple cans of baked beans (your preference of brand)  into a pot & add sliced kielbasa, then turn on the burner, 10 - 12 minutes later.... Poof. Done.

I really like this recipe.  I really like beans and smoked sausage so, I knew I'd go for this.  I did add a diced green chili pepper.  Very good.
