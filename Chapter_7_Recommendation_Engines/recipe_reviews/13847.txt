Very easy recipe. I used gala apples. I also added more walnuts and grapes. I had quite a bit of leftover dressing, so I omited about a 1/4 cup of it. Chilled it for about an hour before serving, and my husband loved it. This is certainly a keeper.

This was really good.  I used granny smiths.  I didn't have walnuts so I used chopped candied pecans.  I also added a couple of small scoops of sour cream.

I will definitely make this again.

I wanted to try something healthier with this recipe so I did make a few changes.  I omitted the salad dressing/mayo and took a large container of whipped cream and added in warmed up package of cream cheese.  I also doubled the recipe used granny smith apples and stirred in a bag of mini marshmallows.  I also used a bag of glazed walnuts because they were less expensive. I made it for a ladies fellowship.  Was loved by all.  and they even took the leftovers home.

Delicious!  I had to add some mini-marshmallows, though, or my kids would have been severely disappointed.  The sprinkling of nutmeg added a nice flavor.  This was a great addition to our Easter table.

Very yummy recipe that reminds me of egg nog (because of the mayo and nutmeg). I used light mayonnaise and, instead of cream, fat free Cool Whip. I had no lemon, but I think the salad came out great regardless. I added cauliflower and diced boneless/skinless chicken breast. Tomorrow for lunch I will be eating this salad on a whole wheat pita, but it also tastes amazing on its own!

This was a good, unique salad. It turned out just a bit mayonaise tasting, so next time I will definately reduce the mayo input.

This was a big hit at for a party!  The only changes were using Honeycrisp apples, craisins instead of raisins, and pecans instead of walnuts.  I also seasoned it with salt, pepper, and celery seed.  I did not have time to whip the heavy cream, so I omitted it.  I will make this many times in the future.  I also added chicken one time, and turkey breast another.

Wasn't like the Waldorf I remember as a child... it was a little too sweet.  Added celery salt and it brightened it right up.

This salad is so good.  Excellent choice when looking for a salad to go wth ham or turkey.  My mom made a variation of this every Thanksgiving.  I will definitely make it again!

Was very good.. I used red and green apples, plain yogurt instead of mayo mix (thinking I might try a raspberry vinegarette next time!), and candied pecans instead of walnuts.. was delicious!

I like this recipe but not a fan of using so much mayo. I used about 2 tablespoons of mayo and 1/2 cup of vanilla flavored yogurt for the dressing.  The nutmeg really adds a good twist.

Big hit at bookclub! I am not a big fan of mayo, so this is a great option.
