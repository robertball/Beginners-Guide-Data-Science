I made this last night. It was awsome. I used a little hot sauce, no peppers. only because I have family who can't take it. My husband liked it so much we used it for our pot roast in the crock pot again today. I will update when it's finished. Thanks for sharing this

Sadly I didn't have all the ingredients so managed with what I had on hand.  The recipe was easy to put together with only negative being marinating 3-8hours.  The lemon citrus was very noticeable snf s good blend to other ingredients. Will most certainly try this again.

I followed the recipe but put a little extra lemon juice and used low sodium soy sauce.  Plans changed last minute and I did not get to cooking the steak when I had originally wanted to.  The steaks ended up being marinated for almost 2 days.  The steaks were cooked on the grill.   They were the most tender and flavorful steaks we have ever made!

Great marinade to really enhance the flavours of the meat without overpowering them. I made no changes except that I excluded the optional ingredients. This recipe is the one for you if your looking for something easy, with a slightly different taste than your average marinade; a very welcome surprise. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making it again! :)

I marinated one steak without the optional red pepper flakes and hot sauce and one with the addition. I marinated for about 8 hours.   The steak without the hot sauce & red pepper flakes we thought had both a sweet & savory flavor and we liked it very much.  The steak with the hot sauce & red pepper flakes was pretty spicy and seemed a strange combination with our porterhouse steak.   It definitely gave it a kick!  I would rate the regular marinade a four, but, the spicy addition to the marinade a three.  If you go with the spicy and marinade it a long time you may want to reduce the amount you put in the first time you try it.

I used ghost pepper sauce but used less than 1/2 the amount.
