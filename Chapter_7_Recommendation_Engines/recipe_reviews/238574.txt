I had fresh green beans from the farmers market that were begging to be used and came across this recipe.  Not only was I able to use the green beans but this recipe satisfied the carb portion of dinner as well.  The only changes I made was to use fresh tomatoes and basil as I can't abide using dried or canned when fresh is at hand!  Nice mix of flavors for a side dish that will complement a main course beautifully but won't steal the star of the show.  Served with Chicken with Mushroom also from AR. Thank you tlriney for the submission.

Great side dish!  Easy to make too.  I didn't have any pine nuts but tasted good without them.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good.  The roasted pine nuts give it a delicious nutty flavor.  
I used cut frozen green beans.  Even good cold as a pasta salad.

Yum! I followed the recipe fairly loosely...I used a combo of fresh and canned tomatoes since that's what I had, added some red pepper and cannelini beans and sauteed all the veggies together instead of steaming, increased the basil and added oregano and Italian spice mix, and added extra parmesan on top on the plate. The result was delicious. I loooove the toasted pine nuts and next time I think I would double them, and maybe not mix them in but add them to the plate so that once it becomes leftovers they don't get mushy from being mixed in.

Very good recipe.  I made 2 changes.  I didn't have any basil, so I substituted Italian Seasonings, and I had part of an orange pepper leftover, so I chopped it and warmed it a bit in the microwave.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  We thought it was very good.  Next time I think I will use lemon olive oil, double the Italian seasoning, and use at least 1.5 teaspoons of salt.  It just needed a little extra zing to be 5 stars!  Thanks for posting.  Update:  It made great leftovers.  It need more oil, so I used the lemon - but any flavor would work.  I served it hot and cold and add the extra seasoning.  One day, I add cooked chicken, cubed into small pieces and mixed it all together.  It was great and was a definite "planned-over,"  not a leftover.

Nice recipe that can easily be modified for whatever you have in your fridge/allergies. Made mine with just fresh green beans, olive oil, basil, and fresh tomatoes tossed with spaghetti noodles with a dash of salt and pepper. Lovely meal:)

Surprisingly very, very good considering how few ingredients there are.  This will be a regular main dish for me.

I loved it..the kids didn't care for it, but they love and have had the components separately so idk. Would still make it again though.
