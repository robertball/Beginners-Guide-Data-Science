As a major cheese lover, I can't believe I am even going to bring myself to type this, but this recipe just had too much cheese.  The scallions bring a really great flavour to this dish, but we easily could have cut down on the fontina cheese.  I will try this dish again, but next time, I will use 6 oz of fontina cheese and 1/2 cup cream.  On a side note, try a bite before adding additional parmesan cheese on top!!

VERY heavy. I would suggest using light cream and half the butter. Taste was good, but again... heavy. Make sure the cheese doesn't have time to harden or it will separate from the butter and cream.

This was truly decadent!  Oh my gosh, it was like something out of a wonderful restuarant!  The only thing is that I would cut the butter amount in half, I think it is really too much.  It kind of pooled on top of the sauce and separated a little.  I was a little short on fontina, so I upped the parmesan to 1/4 cup.  Sadly, I had no fresh basil, so I had to use dried.  Still good though, but I can't imagine how much better it would have been with fresh!

Such an easy recipe.  Had trouble finding Fontina cheese, so settled for a cheese labeled as "Dutch soft cheese."  Close enough for me. 

To cut down fat, I used low fat milk instead of cream, but it was still creamy enough for my taste.

It was great! really tasty.. I added one box of frozen spinach (thawed and REALLY WELL DRAINED) and a little bit of lemon juice right at the end.  My husband suggested we put pancetta and mushrooms next time.. a GREAT recipe to work with.

I hate giving this recipe a three rating, but I felt that it needed a little perfecting. I made my sauce the same way as I would for mac and cheese. That means cutting the butter amount in half, adding flour to make a roux, then adding the liquid, stirring until thickened and finally the cheese. In this case, I used fat free half and half and found I needed more than suggested. Fontina is one of my all time favorite cheeses, so I was thrilled to have a reason to buy it. I shredded it instead of cubing and probably used a bit more. I also added some seasonings to the sauce. This was a great start to a comforting and delicious dish. Thanks!

very quick and easy to prepare.  the delightful, creamy, rich cheese sauce goes well over broccoli or any veggie, too---easy way to feed kids! shallots give  a wonderful flavor; fontina cheese---any day, any time w/ anything! very filling dish with gnocchi---will try penne or bowtie pasta next time! thanks for sharing!

This is straight up comfort food! I made my own gnocchi, bc I dont like pre-made gnocchi. I did twist the recipe a little bit, I added garlic and sage to the shallots, and took off the basil. This was delicious! I strongly recommend adding fresh minced garlic; it makes a huge difference!

This was a tasty sauce and easy to prepare.  It was my first time trying fontina and I was glad that the taste was not too harsh.  I did add some milk to this recipe - probably about 1/2 cup.  It was just REALLY thick!

Not sure what everyone is saying about it being too heavy or strong...of course it's going to be strong! It's supposed to be! My family is from Naples and I've had this exact dish while I was in Italy, and this recipe is almost on the dot. 

I kept the sauce simple. I just made it with butter, fontina cheese, and heavy cream. A pinch of garlic and herb seasoning. That's it & perfection!

This recipe was excellent.  It was very rich, so I will only make for special occasions.  I reduced the fontina cheese to about 6 ounces and also added sauteed scallops.  Again, a wonderful recipe and very easy to make.

This recipe is good.  I always feel I need to add more herbs to the sauce to bring out the flavor.  I added dried oregano, salt & pepper, and some parsley along with the basil.  My BF really likes it.

MY SAUCE CAME OUT WAY TOO THICK...I ENDED UP ADDING MORE CREAM.  I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE TEXTURE OF THE SAUCE AND THE FLAVOR WAS JUST OKAY TO ME.

I followed the sauce recipe to a T, and I wound up with sauce, with a giant cheese ball in the middle. The only reason I'm even upset about it is that the cheese I used was VERY expensive, and just wish it had at least turned out. Thankfully the sauce that the cheese ball was in was still pretty tasty. Needless to say I won't be making any more cheese sauces in the near future.

I did not find the cost of the cheese prohibitive.  All of my company just loved this dish served on September 5, 2010.  The next time I make this, I will add just a little more cream to thin the sauce.  Very easy and elegant.  This sauce could be used in many ways depending on your mood!  Great stuff!

I love this dish. However, I made some changes to make it a more balanced meal. First I sauted, half a large onion chopped in 4 tablespoons of butter and 2 tbsp of olive oil. Then once cooked down a bit (5-7min), I added cooked deli ham chopped into the onions and saute that all together. In a measuring cup, I put 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of chicken broth and microwaved for 2 minutes. I sprinkled 1 tbsp on flour down on top of the onion/ham mixture and cooked for 1 minute then added in the cream/broth mixture. I let that all heat through. I then added the cubed fontina and stirred till almost blended. I then added a handful of frozen peas at the very end. Overall, it was delicious and my husband was very excited to eat it! Great recipe!

My only change - add a little bit of white wine to the sauce.  Not too much or it won't come out right, but it seems to add a little something and makes a bit "lighter".     It's very rich, so I serve this with a salad topped with an oil and vinegar dressing.

This dish has a wonderful flavor, the fontina cheese is a creamy tasting cheese. I only used 4 table spoons of butter and it worked just fine. I personally would use homemade dumplings next time because I felt the gnocchi was a bit too soft and squishy for my liking. I also placed the gnocchi's and fontina sauce over a fresh bed of baby spinach and it was amazing. Definetly give it a try if you like spinach!! :)  Thank you for the recipe!!!

The sauce was extremely rich, but it was not perfect.  Fontina cheese is fairly pricey and I think i would have gotten more enjoyment from eating it on crackers or in an omelet. Won't be making again.

I gave this four stars because I thought it was good but too salty. However, my husband loved it and wants me to make it again. I did try it once with Muenster cheese and that turned out pretty good (and its a lot cheaper than Fontina cheese). Thanks!

The sauce rocks! I couldn't fine gnocci at two different grocery stores so I ended up serving it on ravioli instead. I'm sure the gnocci would have been even better. The sauce is so rich this is definitely not something you can make too often.

It was rich, but we couldn't quit eating it.  It made a LOT of sauce for just the gnocchi called for, but it was delicious.  We added halibut to ours for some "meat" in the dish to make it more of a main dish than an entree.

Oh!  Yummy, yes!  Rich, oh yes!  Fattening, definitely!  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I had no problems with pooling butter or separation.  One need eat only a small side of this dish to be satisfied!  Just sinfully fabuolous!

Delighful! I used refrigerated gnocchi, fat free half-n-half, only half of the butter called for. Whips up really quickly and my kids loved it!

Made just as written; it was ok. Too rich and cheesy for my taste. I think adding something acidic like tomatoes or roasted red pepper may help cut through some of the cheese and bring in another flavor.

Very good...just like a high end restaurant would serve!  I used light cream and found that I had to adjust (use more) accordingly as I was make the sauce.  I also used Asiago and parmesan cheese as well as reducing the amount of fontina.  Very rich sauce...I found it needed something so the next time I served it I added some sauted wild mushrooms on top...made it absolutely perfect!

This recipe is simply decadent! Excellent. For those that said it was too think a sauce, add alittle more half and half if it appears to be too thick while melting the cheese, sheesh. 
This makes plenty of sauce, so you may have alittle less than half left over. This sauce is perfect for a fondue sauce, so keep the extra sauce, grab some crusty bread and enjoy with a loved one. 
Be warned: This recipe is VERY rich, so you won't want to make this every week. Once a month or for a special occasion like Valentine's Day or an anniversary would be perfect! ENJOY!

I LOVE Gnocchi!  Can't get enough of those little doughy pillows of yumminess, but this sauce was very disappointing.  Much to salty and thick.  Will keep looking for other sauces for my little doughy pillows of yumminess.

MMM!  I added garlic and used milk, not heavy cream, adding enough to achieve my desired consistency-which was way for than 1/3 cup for a halved recipe!  I also added some salt to bring out the flavors and several twists of freshly cracked white pepper.  I was fated with 'you can't find something when you look for it,' so I served tortellini instead of gnocchi.  I really like gnocchi, so next time I run into them, I shall have to buy them and make this again!

This was ok. I only used 4 tbsp butter and skim milk. It looked to thick so I added some more milk. It was nice and creamy on the stovetop , but my husband was late and by the time we ate the sauce was gloppy.

The flavour is delicious, but the texture is not as great. The cheese congeals quickly once the dish starts to cool. Perhaps a roux-based sauce made with grated fontina would work better. However, it is worth tweeking for the lovely flavours. Thanks!

The cheese sauce was a little strong and tasted a bit salty between the fontina and parmesean.  Next time I'd use a bit less fontina and add a bit of mozzarella to make it a bit more mild.

This was the 1st time I've ever had gnocchi but my brother has made this recipe and gave it rave reviews so I thought I'd try it for Mother's Day dinner.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written and everybody loved it!  I served it with grilled chicken & corn on the cob.  Unfortunately it was gone before I could get pictures of the meal.  I will definately be making this again.

The flavor of this dissh was excellent! It was very rich and would be better as a side dish served with grilled chicken. The sauce would also be great over fettuccine. This was a fast and VERY easy recipe to make!

I thought the sauce was too rich, too thick. Kids ate it for dinner without snubbing their noses but the leftovers were thrown away. Which was disappointing after spending that much on cheese.

This is a very rich treat of a recipe.  Don't make it unless you are a big fan of rich gooey cheese and deep buttery flavor.  I used dried gnocchi in place of frozen and they were still perfect.  I added a little garlic and pepper when cooking the shallots.  My sauce was way too thick so I added more cream at the end until I had the right consistancy.  This is best eaten warm and right away.  If you reheat it expect some seperation from the sauce. I served it hot over a lightly floured and pan fried chicken breast.  I recommend serving it with something like chicken or pork to let your palate have a break from the richness of the pasta.

Very good flavor but I wish there was some way to keep the cheese sauce from gumping up as soon as they start cooling down on your plate.  These were so rich and filling that we could only eat a small amount of them.  I think I would make these again but as a side dish.

I made this for my dinner group this week and it was the most popular dish out of all the ones I served.  The only trouble I ran into is that Fontina cheese is incredibly expensive here, I could only find it at Whole Foods.  Because I was cooking for 10 people, I ended up using less Fontina than the recipe called for, and increased the butter and parmesan slightly to compensate.  It was very rich, but extremely tasty.  I do recommend tasting this sauce as you're mixing in the cheese to get the right combination of flavors.

Delicious & decadent! I made homemade gnocchi using the 'Quick Gnocchi' recipe on this site & seasoned with crushed rosemary & salt/pepper. I did change the sauce a little and followed other reviewer's suggestions to reduce the butter by half and I did use half and half cream to cut down on fat. I substituted the fresh herbs and seasoned the sauce instead with a splash of white wine, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp ground  mustand. It was soooo good!

We've never had gnocchi before, and discovered tonight we don't like it. I don't know if I overcooked them or what, but they had a horrid gluey heavy texture. The sauce was ok, but not worth the calories, and definitely not 10 bucks' worth of cheese. Disappointing. Thanks anyway.

this is a great recipe! Living here in Europe it's easy to get gnocchi and any number of different sauces all the time. This sauce is just the same as I get from our favorite resturant here. ALL sauces here are thick, hearty, filling and wonderful. American sauces tend to be thinner. I followed the recipe exactly and added just a bit of fresh garlic, served over homemade gnocchi I learned to make in Italy.  LOVED IT.

This sauce is delicious, it's very rich and thick. My husband really loved this sauce and had no qualms about giving it 5 stars.  I made it exactly as the recipe is printed.  I am curious to see how it reheats tomorrow for lunch.

I really love making this, or more so eating it, but just a side note: even though it's tedious, make sure to cut the gnocchi up into small bites, or else it can be overwhelming to eat.

Heavenly!! 

I used gnoccetti for this recipe (smaller sized gnocci) and it turned out perfect! It was a very rich dish with great flavors, but not too heavy for me. A kale salad complemented it perfectly (I should post the recipe!). I ended up adding more cream (whipping cream), but only because I accidently boiled the sauce while preparing a salad to go with the meal. That said, I think the texture of mine was a little different than it's supposed to be; due to the boiling, some of the cheese separated onto the bottom of the saucepan, but the texture was suitable. I garnished with the fresh basil as advised and I couldn't imagine the dish without it. This dish is a total winner. I will be holding on to this recipe when I need something good for picky guests. Thanks!!

This is the first time I have served gnocchi (store bought--for now) and this sauce is delicious! I thought the cheese would be heavy, so I doubled up the heavy cream, but left the cheese the same. It was amazing! My husband and I enjoyed it greatly!

Followed recipe exactly but will not be making this one again. Sauce had a nice consistency but taste was not there for me. Tasted like it was missing ingredients.

Loved this recipe, sauce was thick but decadent. We added some chopped bacon to give it some texture and salty flavor, and it was delicious!  Check our food blog out at http://KickinCuisine.blogspot.com

I thought it was very delicious. The cheese was a bit stringy, but overall everything went together wonderfully. I upped the cream to a 1/2 cup, but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. My husband wasn't big on the gnocchi, so I plan to try again with linguine instead.

Sorry but this did not go over well with my family.  The sauce is way to thick and we were just not thrilled with the taste.  Will keep looking.  Thanks for letting us try

Followed recipe, as I feel we all should the first time making a dish.  Had fontina on hand as I bought it on accident.  Thought perfect!  I'll use it up.  The sauce  was good, but can't reconcile the cheese sauce being more of a melted, pliable cheese vs. a sauce.  It tasted fine, even good,  but the line " heart-attack on a plate" ran through my head all throughout dinner.  I'm also concerned about how the chunk of cheese sauce is going to reheat as the leftover "sauce" had congealed into a block by the time we were clearing the dinner table.

Not sure if I'll make it again.  Think there are better sauces to be made for my gnocchi.  But it was good, after all, it's fontina cheese we're talking about.

This is a wonderful rich sauce that can be used on any pasta (I've made it for chicken fettuccine). Working with white sauces like this take a careful hand. It's easy to get distracted (well at least for me - with kids & pets charging through the kitchen), so take to heart the "don't let it get to a boil" warning.

There were a few comments about it being heavy - but when you see a recipe with butter AND heavy cream, belly up (no pun intended) to the bar on that one.  Good suggestions are using 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and lessening the butter or swapping out half with an equal amount of good olive oil (my personal favorite).

Decadent and rich, and a taste of heaven! I added pan fried prosciutto with the fresh basil to top it off, and it came out perfect. This is a very heavy dish, so I would suggest modifying the amount of butter and lighter version of cream. A little goes a long way. Five stars as this is the best version of Gnocchi I have found!

great basis for being able to modify to what's on hand...had to use half/half...no shallots...added 1 and 1/2 fresh mushrooms sliced and minced garlic...no fontina on hand so used blue cheese....next time will use the shallots and fontina for sure....
