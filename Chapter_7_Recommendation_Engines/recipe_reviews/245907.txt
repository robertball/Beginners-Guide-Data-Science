This turned out excellent! I'll admit that I didn't have high hopes but was just looking for a weekend project. Well, mid-week I used it in a stir-fry and it blew my mind. It was present but not overbearing in the dish. Neither me or my husband are huge ginger fans. A little goes a long ways. Stir-frys that call for fresh ginger are just too much for us. This infused oil is the perfect solution!
