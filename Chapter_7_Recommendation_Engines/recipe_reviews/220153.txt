I have made this recipe many times over the years.  It can also be sugarfree using diabetic jellos.   I really do not know why it is always described as a childrens dessert because it is very much appreciated by adults and a wonderful addition to Xmas desserts.

This is a great recipe but substitute the graham crackers for lady fingers.  It is a very light dessert and the presentation is very colorful

This recipe was a must for my sister (rip).  It was my sister's signature dessert.  She was asked to make this for every family event.  Did not make a graham cracker topping.  Was not needed. But, instead of a 9x13 pan, it was made in a mold, when she needed to unmold it, placed bottom of mold into warm water until it was able to unmold onto a plate.  Placed a plate on open side of mold, turned it over to unmold onto the plate.  Spectacular!  Nobody has attempted to make it.

The only thing wrong is the jello. 
Use 1 cup hot water and 1/2 cup cold.
You will have better results when you combined all.
Jello will stay together.

Growing up, over 50 years ago, this was my all-time favorite.  We called this "Broken Glass Torte".  It was made with a graham cracker crust in a springform pan.  I omitted the graham cracker topping and only used 1/2 cup of cold water in each flavor.  This was a hit in the 1960s, and it is still a hit today.  A golden oldie!

I made this but found the Jello had way too much water as when I went to fold it into the whip cream part it fell apart and looks awful. I think it will taste okay thought.

In 2010, I tried an earlier AR version of this recipe. VERY GOOD. Be sure to give the final product plenty of time to completely set up.

This is such a pretty dessert or salad (without graham cracker crumbs).  Back in the 50s, for large crowds as salad, the cooks used to pour the Jell-O mix into 1# cans, refrigerate until set, punch a tiny hole in the bottom end, slide the Jell-O out, slice in 1 inch increments and then place 1 slice on lettuce on a salad plate. One of my favorites.

Love this stuff!! Growing up my grandmother made this every Christmas. We called it "Cracked  Glass Cake". This really tastes like hers did. I wish I would have asked her for the recipe when I had the chance.

I only saved 3/4 cup of the crumb mix for the topping and I added a fourth gelatin
Lemon, Strawberry, Berry Berry, and Concord Grape.
I had this every year for Christmas (do to it's celebratory colors) and at Thanksgiving (due to its easy and not so filling/rich tastes and flavors)
This is a fabulous dish that everyone should try

After making this dessert and chilling it, I noticed that ontop of my cherry jelly it began to appear black on top. I also saw that the cream in the cake was not as solid as I thought it would be like the other broken glass cakes online.

Jello made with only 1 1/2 cups of liquid keep a nicer shape. I decided to top mine with rainbow coloured coconut as it adds nicely to the flavour. I had never thought to put it on top of graham crust so two thumbs up for that suggestion its in the fridge now cant wait for dessert tonight:D

My Mother made this dish, fabulously,  over 40 years ago! I sure wish I had her expertise here, now, because my version of this recipe was a TOTAL DISASTER.
 I followed it to the letter, but I suspect something gets lost in the communication, . . .  not with the original author's talents. It's not too bad-tasting, if you don't mind pouring in into bowls. I suspect the handling of unflavored gelatin is the culprit.

This just wasn't a seller with my family or the company we had over.  The jello was pretty but, for the labor involved, the results were disappointing.  I would save my efforts for something different than this.

I have made a similar recipe for many years, but it is called "Broken Glass Salad."  It's not really a salad per se because it has a bottom crust made of vanilla wafers (with more crumbled vanilla wafers on top).  I think a better name for this recipe would be "Broken Glass Dessert."
