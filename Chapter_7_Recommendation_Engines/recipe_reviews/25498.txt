These were wonderful but I changed the recipe to reduce the amount of fat.  First I did not add any butter in the 13x9 pan and it wasn't missed at all.  Secondly  I used olive oil to sautee the onions and garlic.  I sprayed the mushrooms with butter flavored pam before cooking.  I did as others suggested and cooked the mushrooms in the microwave for 5 minutes before stuffing to reduce the water content.  I also used a melon ball scooper to remove the stems.  It worked great! Finally, I used turkey bacon.  I used skim milk and a little cream and they held together great.  I sprinked parm. cheese on them right before baking.  Best mushrooms ever!  I promise you won't miss the fat!!

This was AWESOME!!!!! I did however, make a few changes to the directions, not the ingredients. Instead of large mushrooms I used regular mushrooms so that they were more of a "finger food". I also made the filling the night before so that it would cut down on the prep time for the next day. These were so yummy that my friend who doesn't usually eat mushrooms, wanted the recipe!!! A must for any gathering....

Excellent recipe! I made it verbatim the first time, but the second time I made them I was running short on time, so I cheated...I used a box of Stouffers frozen spinach souffle, and onced cooked and cooled a bit, I mixed in a little minced onion and bacon...tasted EXACTLY the same with a 1/3 of the prep!

These mushrooms were fantastic and went quickly. I loved them and will definitely make them again. I used 3/4 c of fresh spinach but next time I will probably use a whole cup.  I might also make 1 1/2 times the filling so I can pile it on high.  Also a good tip would be to sautee the mushrooms before baking to get the extra water out of them.  They were kind of messy to eat with the juice dripping out of them.

Served these at a wine tasting and they were gone in no time.  Everyone loved them.  Very easy to make.  Actually made them the day before and baked them just before the party.

To make it healthier, I used olive oil instead of butter and used milk instead of cream.  Still very rich and delicious. I've made it a number of times for guests.

The mushrooms were great but the real crowd pleasure was from tnhe left over filling.  I put it in a dish added grated parm to the top and baked it along with the mushrooms.  I served it with hawaiian bread and tortilla chips.  EVERYONE at our party RAVED!!!

Awesome, I brought these to my Mom's (where I am known to bring my stuffed mushrooms).  These were a great change from the sausage shrooms that I usually bring.  We loved the spinich in these.  I skipped drizzling the butter on the top & microwaved them for 5 minutes, perfect!  I suggest investing in a melon baller if you make these often, it makes it much easier to remove the stem.  Fantastic recipe Gail, - thank you!!

This recipe appealed to me b/c of the use of spinach in the stuffing mix.  This recipe was fantastic!  I was able to put it all together, even with two girls 2 yrs. and under.  I did make a point of doing some of the prep work during their nap time.  Also, I substituted 5 oz. of fresh chopped spinach for the frozen spinach.  I also sprinkled the stuffed mushrooms with parmesan before putting them into the oven. We definitely plan to make this recipe again.

I have no problem taking shortcuts in cooking as long as they don't compromise the dish and I found the reviewer Mare's use of Stouffer's prepared spinach a brilliant and excellent one.  While she used their spinach souffle, I used their creamed spinach which already includes Parmesan and Romano cheeses.  Didn't even bother to cook it, just thawed it in the fridge overnight.  Cooked the bacon in the microwave, eliminating dirtying a pan and saving another few minutes to boot.  I did cook the onion with the garlic and added it to the thawed spinach along with the cooked and crumbled bacon - I didn't bother with the mushroom stems. These were quick and fun to make and ohhh, what a pay-off! So delicious!  We ate this as a side dish to our dinner rather than as an appetizer and they were excellent as well as elegant.  Kudos to both the submitter for her delicious recipe and to the reviewer Mare for her genius shortcut.

Ever since i made these for a christmas party a couple years ago they make me bring them to every function now! UGH! Here's the only changes i've made over the times i've made them:

triple garlic (I'm a garlic lover)

The first couple times i made them they were very tastey but they were swimming in liquid when i took them out of the oven. Here's what i do now to make sure that doesnt happen again:

- do not butter the baking dish
- SQUEEZE the ever living **** out of the spinach, make sure you get all the water out
- do not drizzle butter on top - there's plenty of fat in these.


That's it...thanks for a great recipe!

A good, easy stuffed mushroom recipe! I liked how these are healthier than your usual stuffed mushrooms, as they use spinach as a base, instead of the cream cheese, breadcrumbs, or sour cream used in most traditional recipes. I skipped the 2 tbs. of melted butter for the drizzle, as I felt that the mushrooms really didn't need it. I also had no heavy cream, so I subbed whole milk instead. They came out really tasty, and my mom and I enjoyed eating them. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

Everyone loved these mushrooms.  They're so flavorful and so different from the breadcrumb version.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used light cream (all I had on hand) with wonderful results, and I did not drizzle on the melted butter before baking; it wasn't even missed.  A delicious appetizer.

Sooo good!  I had a tapas party last night and served this as one of the "small plates" - definitely the "sleeper hit" of the party!  I used smaller mushrooms so they would be bite-sized, used a slightly leaner cut of bacon, half & half instead of cream, and then sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top as well.  Also you really don't need any of that extra butter.  You don't need to butter a pan and you don't need to pour melted butter on top prior to baking.  I just baked them on parchment paper and they came out amazing.  Great recipe!

Good flavor but way too greasy for us.  No need to drizzle the butter over the tops.  If I make these again, I will definitely cut back on the butter.

This recipe was indeed good.  Quite savory, but not too rich.  I used Smart Bacon, to make this a vegetarian dish.. and also a bit more cheese, just bc i love it.  I used 9 baby portobellas for a a more hearty meal addition and it worked great.  I will make this again!  (the mix.. before stuffed in the mushrooms, was great on crackers too!)

My husband  LOVED these.  We renamed them Mushrooms Rockefeller. A few changes I made was to pre-cook the mushrooms while I made the stuffing.  That cut cooking time after stuffing.  Their liquid had blended with the butter in the pan for a yummy sauce.  I also blanched fresh spinach instead of using frozen.  I use Fat-free half and half to thicken all my recipes that require cream.  I used the extra filling to garnish salmon tonite.  Superb!

I can't believe I haven't rated these yet! I've been making these for a couple years now and they make a great appetizer for parties. The only trick here is that you must drain your spinach really well otherwise the filling will be a little watery instead of creamy like it should be. These are very good.

FANTASTIC! We just did a "test run" with these mushrooms for an upcoming party. They certainly passed the test! We ended up making a meal of them...they were that good! Made the recipe as written. I did sprinkle a little Parmesan on half the batch and a little crumbled Feta on the other half the last 5 minutes of baking. Both were outstanding! Highly recommended!

I made those mushrooms for Thanksgiving this year, I also doubled the recipe.  The mushrooms taste very good.  I took the advice from one of the reviewers and zapped the mushrooms in the microwave for 5 minutes to extract the moisture out.  I also melt 3 tablespoons of butter and coat all the mushrooms in the butter before I stuff them, that way, you don't have to butter the baking dish.  

One trick I learned from French cooks is you can peel the mushrooms to get a bigger cavity for stuffing.  After removing the stems from the mushrooms, simply peel from the cavity area.

Excellent! I didn't use white mushrooms. Instead I used portabella's. I also cleaned them out and finely chopped up the stem to add to the mix for seasoning. Not to mention topped them off with a smokey swiss cheese!

I make a LOT of stuffed mushrooms b/c I learned early on there are not enough parties for me to get my stuffed mushroom fix! These were a lot of work and I don’t think that is necessary for stuffed ‘shrooms, they should be easy.  I also recommend small (not large) mushrooms for stuffing. They are a much tastier bite and they fit in your mouth and don’t make a mess. Besides, people love them and they go fast, the smaller ones go a long way.  
I used thawed frozen spinach and therefore eliminated the “cook spinach” phase. I just squeezed it well. I used 2% milk not cream or H&H. And I sprayed them lightly w/ cooking oil instead of more melted butter. Cooked ‘em at 400F for 20 min. That being said…They were very good but I prefer my other stuffed ‘shroom recipes that are easier and just as tasty.

Delicious!  My 5 year old could not get enough of them.  I used pre-packaged bacon bits and half & half instead of the cream and it was to die for.  The recipe makes enough stuffing for at least 24 mushrooms.

These are amazing! Staple appetizer in my house. Everyone that has tried them has loved them. Substitute the parmesan cheese for Feta if you're feeling adventurous. It gives it a real kick.

At last...another way to get Mr P to eat spinach! Made these last night as a side dish and they went down a storm. Followed recpe but with a couple of very small modifications (used olive oil instead of butter and upped the parmesan). The spinach mixture is quick & simple to make and unbelievably tasty - as well as this recipe, will definitely use it either on its own as a side or as the filling for other dishes like omelettes. Many thanks for the recipe.

Delicious.  Will make again over and over.  I used baby portabellos and added grated parmesan and italian mix cheese.  Served with wild rice as an entree.  My husband wants me to make again soon.

We enjoyed this recipe. We made both smaller mushrooms and also large portabello ones. Definitely liked the smaller ones better - the larger ones were almost overwhelming. My husband said that next time I should add sausage or crab, so there's more meat and a little more flavor. I think it would be great with more garlic and maybe a little white wine and seasoned breadcrumbs added to the filling. It's a fun recipe that you can cater to your own individual tastes.

Very good version. We have shellfish allergies and so many stuffed mushrooms use shellfish in them. This is a very nice and easy alternative! Thanks.

I'd give this more stars if I could.  This recipe was fantastic.  I used italian sausage instead of bacon to compliment an italian dish that I made and I cant imagine it getting any better than that.  This is my favorite appetizer recipe ever.  Will make to impress everyone I know, hehehe.

it was easy and as others have said you don't need to drizzle the butter over it when you put it in the oven.  I used fresh spinach since that is what I had,  half and half instead of heavy cream, used parm-romano cheese.  it was delicious.  I served it over couscous.  VERY tasty and I'll make it again, will try a healthier version next time with olive oil instead of butter.  may cut back the bacon.  I found it did not need salt added since there is so much salt in the bacon and cheese.  I think this is a great recipe to use as is or alter according to what you have on hand.

I loved this and so did my guests. I used a bag of fresh spinach sauted in butter instead of the frozen. Its better and has a nice bright green color. I choose Half and half instead of heavy cream only because I had it, worked fine. I also used green oinions. Either the 400 degree temp is to high or the cooking time is to long. They were starting to burn at 20 minutes. But my oven maybe off.

High fives all around from my family.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for subbing scallions for the onion (couldn't see cutting into a whole onion just for 2 tablespoons).  I'm thinking about adding just a dash of nutmeg next timesince spinach and nutmeg pair so well together. Thanks for the recipe!

So Yummy! I used swiss chard instead of spinach, as my garden is over producing that stuff! Chopped up stalks very small and fried in a little oil! Absolutely a keeper!

These mushrooms were very good.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen as I like the taste of fresh better.  I also boiled the mushrooms as others suggested to take care of the water issue.  Easy to prepare and seemed so fancy on the plate!

Although I plan to alter the ingredient amounts a little the next time I make these, I still had to give it 5 stars for being so tasty!  For my taste, next time I'm going to add a bit more bacon and either more parmesan or a little mozzarella.  I rubbed the dish with a little butter and sauteed the onions/garlic in a bit of butter, but didn't see the need in adding even more butter at the end.  Really a great recipe, I just want to make sure that the tastes of the parmesan and bacon are able to hold up against all of the spinach!  OH - like others have mentioned, for some reason these seem to take longer than expected.  It's not as simple as mixing the filling and stuffing the mushrooms, so plan ahead!

I used Swiss cheese and added breadcrumbs and shredded cheese to the top before cooking.  First to disappear at a pot luck.  I will make again with large portabello mushrooms and serve with rice as a main dish.

These are a Great change from most stuffed mushrooms and are worth a try.  I did cut back on the butter though.  Less than half used in the pan for coating and I didn't add at the end, they didn't need it.  Also as a note, I only cooked for 20 mins(w lg mushs) and they cooked great, no need for 30 mins.  I think that saved me from too much liquid like some have mentioned and the spinach wasn't too dark as someone had mentioned.  I willl cook again.

OMG!!! These were so good I made these as a test run for an upcoming halloween party. My neice and Idevoured them. I totally blew my WW points for the day. But anyway. I followed the recipe exactly except I used bacon peices instead of bacon slices and I only used 3 tablespoons of butter for sauteing the onions, garlic and mushroom peices.   The next time, I'm going to lighten it up by using turkey bacon, low fat cheese, olive oil and fat free evaporated milk.

I made these exactly as written and they were delicious.  The absolute best stuffed mushrooms I have ever made.  I had a little bit of the stuffing mixture left over and so we ate it up with tortilla chips.  Will definitely make again and again.

I started using this recipe in 2003! You should see the printed copy, it is in the old Allrecipe.com format! We only alter two things, double the recipe and use as many small common mushrooms as we can. This dish is wildly popular and great for the holiday season. If you like mushrooms and bacon this is for you. Even people that don't like spinach gobble these down. There is never enough!

I added a little flavor to this recipe by using sausage rather than bacon.  Easy to make and delicious!

I prefer mushrooms stuffed with crab meat, but these are an inexpensive alternative.  Most guests love them, but there's always someone that refuses to eat spinach!

These were pretty good...not my favorite stuffed mushrooms, but certainly up there with the best of them.  Next time I will probably sprinkle a little more parmesan cheese on top before baking.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  Great recipe.

Awesome!  Took the suggestion of melting the butter and dipping the mushroom bottoms in it versus butter the dish.  Was worried that the mushrooms might be overcooked, so in my oven I only cooked them for 20 minutes, then turned off oven and they cooked/sat another 5 min. Will definitely make again!!

These were the best stuffed mushrooms I've ever had, and everyone raved about them. I used Cremini mushrooms, which I think added to the flavor and I also sprinkled a little extra Parmesan on top before I baked them.

You don't mention what to do with the spinach after you cook it, but I assume you just mix it in at the end.

These were really good!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and cooked it with the onion and garlic.  I also used pre-cooked bacon that I had on hand and threw that in towards the end to heat it up before adding the cream.  I used butter for the drizzle on top but olive oil to coat the 9x13.

This recipe turned out well. It looked beautiful but didn't have the flavor I expected. Will definitely add some spices next time and maybe some ricotta cheese.

wow, really easy and good, but I really didn't know how to remove the gills of the mushrooms and I wish you would have added that. Wonderfull recipe. My first time using large portabella mushrooms and this was a great recipe.

This was fabulous!  I omitted the butter and sauteed the spinach in bacon drippings.  Also, I used spinach and chard as I didn't have enough spinach.  I pureed the filling so it would be easy to fill the mushrooms.  I dirtied lots of dishes, but I think the result was worth it.

The mushrooms were gone quick as a wink!  We substituted cream cheese in the place of the heavy cream.  Some we used white cheese, and others we used Cheddar.  It was fun doing something rather extravagant with our daughter and my husband.  This time I knew the right time to cook them.  That helps!

Oh, these were sooooo good. I made them for this year's New Year's party, and they were gone! These have a great flavor which is different than most stuffed mushrooms I've had in the past. I tripled the recipe, which really took a long time (it took about an hour to prep). It made much more stuffing than needed (perhaps because the mushrooms were too small?), but that was fine, because we ended up eating the leftover filling with crackers.

Followed the recipe exactly. I did use a melon baller like someone suggested and it did make it a lot easier and faster to prepare. Loved these mushrooms. Took them to work and a lot of people asked for the reciped.

Wonderful stuffed mushroom recipe. I substituted low-fat cream cheese instead of heavy cream and had to add some bread crumbs. Tastes good with or without bacon.

Like others I substituted all the butter and sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil. And used spray butter on top before baking them. I didn't add bacon or cheese, and they were still very good. So I know they would have been 4 stars if I had inculeded them! This is  definitely going in my favorites!

These were pretty good. I followed the recipe except I used cream cheese instead of the heavy cream. I was worried that they would be kind of wet. Nice flavor. I had some extra filling and baked it in a dish and served with tortilla chips. I actually liked it better served with the chips. It gave a bit more contrast of textures.

Huge Hit! I brought these to a party (multiplied the recipe by 5) and everyone raved about them. Then I served them as a side dish and it was something different that made a pretty presentation. I can't recommend this recipe more highly.

These were wonderful.  I used some large portobello mushroom caps and then some normal sized portobello caps.  I think the smaller sized caps worked better because mushrooms naturally shrink when you cook them.  My guests ate all of the smaller size I think because they could just pop them in their mouths.  I'm not sure that the butter drizzle was really necessary and I did add an extra clove of garlic.

These were fantastic!  Will definitely make again.  I used baby bellas to stuff and added a little extra parmesan cheese to mine.  The stuffing was so delicious that I ate all the left over stuffing before I even cooked the mushrooms!  Definitely will use this again!

I love stuffed mushrooms and have made a variety of them...and I was not satisfied with this.  My boyfriend and I both loved stuffed mushrooms and thought this would be great but they just were too bland for us.  I'm giving it 3 stars bc there is room for improvement.  We may try these again but alter the recipe some.  Also, we went with others suggested...and put them in the microwave first...and they shrank up!

shopping in nola shorting after the storm, spicach wasn't available.  i used chopped brocolli.  still very good and all my quest took seconds.  i had no left overs.  
didn't add all that extra butter.  
i also microwaved the shrooms for a few seconds first to get some of the moisture out.

GREAT results, but I had to make some changes to lower the fat content.  I cut it in half (there are only two of us), subbed in 1 tbs. neufchatel + 2Tbs. fat free half and half for the cream, and cooked the onion & garlic in chicken broth.  I didn't use any butter but sprayed the pan and the stuffed mushrooms with butter oil spray.  It came out FANTASTIC, and I'm sure that the original would be even better, it's just too high in fat for us. Thanks Gail!

Pretty good recipe.....  I omit the bacon being a vegetarian and its fine.  I add extra cheese like Roman or something sharp for flavor.  Also add a squeeze of lemon.

I prefer to use medium mushrooms to make them bite sized finger food.  

For some reason they have better flavor the next day.... although I would not recommend making them in advance.  Much prefer the texture of fresh roasted mushrooms.

I think I may have to rename these as OMG Stuffed Mushrooms!! I could eat the stuffing as a meal! I had a little left over and I  took a bite...well I couldn't wait for these little gems to be done! Next time I will double this recipe because these went SUPER FAST and everyone wished they had more!

This was a huge hit with our guests and us! Will definitely do again. One guest said he preferred these over any other stuffed mushroom caps he's had in the past! I sprayed the pan with fat rather than butter the pan. Cooked the stems, onion and garlic in the pan I'd cooked the bacon to catch any residual fat and flavor. Patted the fat off the bacon with a paper towel. And used milk instead of cream. All in all....Yummy!

Great with minor changes.  Microwave caps to eliminate excess water (5 min).  Used fresh spinach. The kicker - blue cheese instead of parm.  Makes a great appetizer for a dinner of beef Wellington , garlic mashed, an NY cheesecake.

I made this recipe with the following changes and it was a HUGE hit:
-Substituted frozen spinach for an 8 oz bag of fresh baby spinach, coarsely chopped, then sauteed with garlic and onion in some of the bacon grease
-Omitted all butter
-Used "baby" portobellos to turn this into a finger food
-Placed mushrooms on the grill over lowest heat until browned

Grilling allowed much of the excess moisture, both from the filling and the mushrooms, to drip off. These were delicious while warm off the grill, and the excess filling was great on crackers (I didn't share, ate it all while doing other prep). I will make extra filling next time to use as a second appetizer.

Followed the recipe as far ingredients but did a few changes;
-I cooked the mushrooms slightly before stuffing.
-I used fresh spinach.  I didn't cook it, just cut it up and put in with other ingredients to sauté.  Spinach cooks quickly.  
-I used real bacon bits rather than cooking the bacon strips.
They turned out very tasty.

These spinach stuffed mushrooms were great! And easy peasy appetizer for your holiday party! I used fresh spinach because that’s what I had on-hand and cream cheese in the place of the heavy cream, also because it’s what was on-hand. I’m sure I will be making these again in the future!

This recipe got rave reviews from all.  I'm not a spinach fan, but this was delicious.  I however did not drizzle the butter over at the end.  It does make lots of extra stuffing.  Just spread it all around and cooked.  We loved the stuffing alone as well.

Bought 2 pkgs of regular mushrooms from Costco and used 30.  Making  the stuffing was a pain in the neck with all the ingredients to chop finely.  My husband took that job over.  The cream did nothing at all. Should have used a can of cream of mushroom soup.  

5 stars because when they came out of the oven they were gobbled right up. Everybody raved about them.  

I will never make them again.  Way too much work.

I used only 4 T of butter and skipped drizzling over the top such that I could use the butter on my crusty bread. Also used 1% milk rather than heavy cream. I had about twice as much stuffing as I needed, so I just put it in the pan. Added a tidbit of Bella Vitano cheese  Sartori to each mushroom.

After trying it as is, I wanted to try variations.

My favorite filing is chopped bacon, mushrooms and garlic and chopped spinach sauteed in the bacon drippings, Italian bread crumbs, and shredded sharp cheddar.

Stuffed to overflowing in small portobello mushroom baked on a foil covered tray  at 350*F for 15 minutes and allowed to cool for 5 minutes before eating.

This tasted great!  I had to make a few  changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed with the mushrooms stems and garlic.  I had no heavy cream so I used light cream cheese. I also eliminated the butter; I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and instead of drizzling with butter I used my olive oil mister.

After trying a few other stuffed mushroom recipes none of which really managed to impress and with a box of spinach in the freezer I thought I would try these as sort of a secondary side as I didn't have high hopes. Turns out they are amazing! Everybody agreed that they were much better than the main dish... sigh :-)

In 2010 I gave this recipe a 5 star. Making this today, I give this a 3 star. Here's the differences I made when cooking, which I believe is the reason for the 3-5 star difference.

2010 VERSION - I used 5 portobello mushrooms (instead of the 12 large mushrooms) and doubled the recipe. Because the portobello mushrooms have such a small stem compared to the cap, there wasn't very much mushroom in the stuffing. I also made sure to drain the cooked spinach very very well. After I finished cooking the stuffing (hadn't stuffed them into the mushroom yet), the stuffing tasted amazingly delicious, very creamy, and full of flavor.

TODAY'S 2013 VERSION - I used 12 large mushrooms, like how the recipes asks for. Because large mushrooms have a gigantic stem compared to the cap, I ended up with a LOT of chopped mushroom in the stem. This made the ratio between the heavy cream and mushroom/bacon/spinach a lot smaller. I also drained the spinach well, but not as well as the 2010 version. So when I finished cooking the stuffing, it seemed like there was barely any cream and mostly just spinach/mushroom/bacon. I even added an extra 1/4 cup of cream but it was definitely not as full of cream as the 2010 version. When I tasted it, it wasn't amazing. Just good.

CONCLUSION - If you're using portobello mushrooms, use all the stems in the stuffing. If you're using large mushrooms, only use half of the stems or less. And make sure you drain the spinach very very well.

Excellent .. but a lot of work. I scooped out the centers of the mushrooms before filling it gave it more room and less likely to fall out when baking.

These are really good stuffed shrooms. I dont care for the heavy cream cheese/sausage ones. EVen though this recipe calls for cream, i used milk to make it even lighter, and it was fine, just reduce it a little. Tastes very light and fresh. WARNING, because of the freshness, you can eat alot of them!

Very good!  I used this stuffing in portabello caps, and it was delicious.  I left out chopping the stems, since I always think portabello stems are nasty anyway.  :)  It was a nice "different" take on the traditional stuffed mushroom - the spinach and bacon is delicious together!

This was a big hit with my family, however, it's not as quick and easy as the directions say.  Not recommended for a last minute addition to your meal - but it you have the time - it's well worth the effort!

It was a great recipe.  I would add either walnuts or pine nuts to the stuffing, or add shredded cheese to the top of the dish to give it a bit more texture.  But otherwise, it was amazing!!

The best stuffed mushrooms ever! I did not use any butter however and used pam olive oil spray instead. I also used fresh spinach that I sauted in olive oil. I added bacon to half the mix for meat eaters and left the bacon out for the vegetarians. YUM!

These were great with the following changes...used button mushrooms 12oz, no butter but spray olive oil. Skipped the heavy cream and added 4oz lowfat cream cheese.Only baked for about 15min.

These were not my favorite.  Too heavy, too salty and we just didn't enjoy them very much.  I think we're going to continue to play around with the ingredients and try to lighten it up a little.

These were wonderful! We love stuffed mushrooms, and these were tastey and fairly easy. We had lots of left over stuffing, and it was so tasty that we ate it on tortilla chips while we were waiting for the mushrooms to bake.

Very good...I substituted low/non-fat everything and used turkey bacon and swiss cheese instead of the listed ingredients.  I know it sounds like a lot of substitutions, but we're on a lo-sodium, low-fat diet (high blood pressure) so it's necessary.  Still, great blend of flavors.  I highly recommend it!

I didn't try these in the mushrooms (don't like mushrooms).  I was told these were good, but not great - thus only 4 stars.  I had some filling left over and put it in an omelette the next morning, and I thought it tasted yummy.

Theese stuffed mushrooms were good but not that good, i had to go to the store to buy the stuff because you dont have the ingredients at home, and for the amount of calories in them you would think they would be better, i probably will not makes theese again

These were very good.  However, did not like the bacon so I skipped it.  I also added parm cheese on top before baking and some shredded mozerella on top right before they were cooked.  Great basic recipe that was easy to spice up.

This is the best recipe for stuffed mushrooms I have ever eaten!  My husband and I loved it.  However, I didn't use spinach at all. (I accidently burnt it when I was cooking it. *oops*) This recipe was delicious!  I highly recommend it... without the spinach anyways. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were okay for me. Served them at a party and most everyone tried them but I had left overs. They didn't have a yummy presentation as the spinach turned almost black and they seems to have a "juicy" texture. Not what I was looking for. Probably wont make again.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!  I made this dish for a Thanksgiving get-together and brought it home empty. Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was instead of frying the bacon, I bought a jar of real bacon bits.  Works just as well and saves lots of time!!!  I also left out the onions . . . but was SSSOOO delicous!!!  Thanks for sharing this one.
