This was great!  I used 1/2 cup of pecans instead of the full cup (because I didn't get enough) and it was delicious.  My husband didn't like the look of it, but he loves the taste now!  I've had gastric bypass, so I can't eat sugar.  Good news for other bypass patients, the amount of real sugar in the brown sugar blend was minimal enough that it doesn't make me sick if I have a small bar (1"x2").  Keep these great recipes coming!

YUMMM...
the perfect snack bar for a "nuts about nuts" kind of guy like me.

VERSATILE TOO!
i liked the idea of using whole wheat flour instead. try adding sesame seeds and a hint of ginger to perk up the flavor.

IN ANSWER TO
a reviewer's question (fsnodderly):
to my knowlede, there is no straightahead brown splenda yet. just the blend.

the only SF brown sugar subs i've seen are "brown sugar twin," and "sweet 'n low brown." but may leave aftertaste.

SUBS
make your own by adding 2-3 tbs molasses to 1c splenda. remember none of the above can caramelize in baking; not enough sugar crystals.

OR
use turbinado sugar, which is raw sugar.

BETTER YET
try the only SF sugar sub that caramelizes successfully is "xylitol" to which you can add molasses to get brown sugar.

perfect for making sugar-free creme brulee!

good luck!

This recipe was splendid!  No kidding.  I made it for a church fundraiser, wrapped the plate in colored Saranwrap, used pretty autumn ribbon and attached a small pumpkin ornament and a copy of the recipe to it. It sold right away and the couple who took them home told me they really loved the bars, especially because he was diabetic. And she really appreciated having the recipe.

I'm making it again this weekend for a Bible class picnic to share it with everybody.  The "over 50" crowd needs all the help we can get to keep our weight down.

Please continue coming up with more great recipes for those of us who love sweets but not all the calories.

These bars are absolutely yummy!  It does fit 9/13 pan.  My first time to use Splenda Brown Sugar.  I think I'll add chocolate chips next time.  These are great!

these are excellent!Rich and satisfying. I am wondering why I can't find the brown sugar splenda straight instead of just a sugar/splenda blend.

I made this tonight and it was very tasty. One thing wrong with the recipe though. It calls for a 13X9 pan, there is no way it fits in that size pan. I used a 9"square pan and it worked out nice.
Thanks for such a good recipe
