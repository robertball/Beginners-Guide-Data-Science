They tasted OK the next day, but the effort was too much for an OK cookie. However, I did not find them too 'spicy' as others have.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!  I can't tell you how many times I have made these.  I am on a low fat diet and it's hard to find a treat that I can still enjoy. These are so yummy and soft!  I added a bit more ginger and they taste just like soft gingersnaps.  YUM! Not to mention, we ended up making a haunted gingerbread house out of your recipe!  I don't like the thought of wasting lots of eggs and butter on something you're never going to eat, so I used this recipe, baked it for 15 minutes and left the pieces out overnight to dry out.  It worked out beautifully.  Thanks again!

I made the recipe and frosting just as written, and both were so excellent that you could not even tell they were low-fat! The frosting was a little strange to make, but worked beautifully for piping onto the cookies. The cookies were so moist and tasty as long as they weren't overbaked. You must make sure that you bake them only as long as the recipe states; baking them to long will yield an inedibly hard cookie! Next time I will use some whole wheat flour to make the cookies even healthier!

This is the best!  I made them for Christmas every year since 2005.  My family would not be happy with out them.  The Stronger the Coffee the better.  Last year I made the coffee wtih a bean called jet fuel.  The best yet.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I was most impressed with the results of the recipe. It does take a lot of work, but so do all cut-out cookies. The texture of the cookie was like that of regular gingerbread cookies; firm but not tough. The frosting recipe that came with it is perfect. It's sweet and sticky enough at first to hold sprinkles well, dries enough to make the cookies easy to store, but doesn't become too hard. The problems I did have with the recipe was that I had to use twice as much liquid to get the dough to hold together, and even had to spray it with water later, then re-flour to roll it. If this affected the final product, it didn't spoil it. I also used Post-um instead of coffee and found it was still good, though next time I will add more ginger to compensate for loss of flavor.
   This may seem like a lot of work and tinkering with the recipe, but it's well worth it to have a good, fat-free gingerbread cookie.

The recipe's great, but the instructions could be a little better. First of all, my dough was very crumbly and difficult to stick together, even after adding two teaspoons of water to it. Second, it should be noted that the cookies expand significantly when baked, so leave lots of room between each gingerbread-person on the tray. Finally, for some reason I was never able to get the icing firm enough. It says to beat on high for 7 to 8 minutes: I beat on high for 20 minutes and it still didn't form stiff peaks. As a result, the icing ran a little on the cookies, making it very difficult to make faces, buttons, and the like. If you're short on time or simply want to avoid the mess, It's probably a better idea to buy the icing. Otherwise the cookies are delicious and low in fat - definitely a keeper!

My family and I didn't care for these cookies.  The spices were too strong and they were difficult to roll out.  If you like strong flavor and cake-like cookies, you may like these.

woo-hoo! a super delicious low-fat cookie! I'm giving it 5, because on my own, they were a four, but my guests LOVED them. I would use more spices than called for, the dough is plenty spicy, but once baked, it's not! Also this is some sticky dough, so roll it out between two sheets of wax paper to really get it laid out, or else flour your surfaces well. if you flour your rolling surface, brush off flour with an oiled pastry brush for better presentation.

I thought these would be like gingersnap cookies, but the spice was so overhelming I could not even eat them. I used canned cake icing instead of the recipe included and that made them a bit better. I also had problems with rolling out the dough, since after refrigeration it was too crumbly to roll.

Dough was very crumbly.  I added some water and that made it rollable.  Think I'll use 1 cup coffee next time.  Still tasted good.
