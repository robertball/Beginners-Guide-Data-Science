If you like Andes Mints or Mint Choc. Chip Ice Cream ~ You'll love these!  In fact, Andes Mints makes their own mint baking chips - which I used and highly recommend (found next to the toffee bits and M&M's in your grocery store). I don't think you need 2c of them though - somewhere between 1 to 1 1/2 cup should be fine (start w/ one cup and add more to taste and texture). However, I did use the full two cups and found these cookies extremely minty *which doesn't make them bad...I'll just cut back next time.  However, when I pulled them out of the oven, these cookies had a uncooked (whitish/green tint) look to them.  I was worried...who would eat these?  They don't even look cooked. Then I got an idea I used on another cookie - I melted some chocolate almond bark (just a couple sqaures of it) and with my spoon, lightly drizzled chocolate criss-crossing over the top.  Not only did they look fabulous but tasted great.  Any true choc. mint lover can appreciate these cookies.  Even my boyfriend who isn't so fond of chocolate mint had his share over the holidays.  I'll make these again and again...using my changes or additions.  Thanks a ton Clare!

These are so good--and healthier without the butter! Instead of mint chocolate chips (which I couldn't find), I used regular choc. chips with a few drops of McCormick's Mint Extract. mmmmmmmmm! My coworkers love these!

I've made this recipe for cookie exchanges for years. I prefer making the recipe with butter instead of oil, and I roll the dough into balls and coat them lightly with sugar before baking. The resulting cookie is delicious, and goes really well with a cup of coffee.

These are soo delicious! They smell great when they are baking, the whole house had a chocolaty minty smell. I had never made cookies with oil before and was a bit skeptical, especially because the batter seemed kind of liquid when it was all together. I chilled it for a little while and then baked for 10 minutes. I agree with the previous reviewer who felt these were very light. Mine were perfectly done and they were very light. I did not dust them with sugar before baking, it's the only thing I changed about the recipe. I absolutely loved these and they will be added to my recipe box permanently. Thanks for an awesome recipe, Clare!

This recipe sounded great because we really wanted cookies and didn't have enough butter left. The dough tasted a little boring, but I figured that was just me being used to butter taste. I ended up having to bake these for almost twenty minutes to get them to a "done" apppearance and taste. They didn't make a cookie shape at all, just stayed how I baked them. Even with a sugar coating, these cookies tasted like boring bread with random chocolate chips. As another review said, it was like the dough was a holder for the chips. I will not be making this recipe again.

Not a big hit. The oil made the dough really greasy and I found it hard to keep the chips in the dough. Not bad, just not great.

I made this recipe because I bought mint chocolate chips and wanted to try them.  I did not like how sweet the cookies were.  I will not make these again.

These cookies were interesting to make, I don't think I ever made cookies with oil and I don't think I ever will again. They were really too soft to roll into ball and after baking the first tray they got really sticky. I found they tasted more like a weird cake then cookies. Sorry but I don't think I'll make these again, probably just make my regular chocolate chip cookies and add the mint chocolate chips. Oh and I got 72 cookies using a tsp.

My hubby said that these cookies were okay, too moist in the middle.  The only thing I did different then the recipe was to use green colored sprinkles instead of white sugar to roll the cookies in before I cooked then.  I also found the dough didn't stick well to the chocolate chips.

these were so tasty. They were sweet enough, so i didnt roll the in sugar. Also, i didnt have mint chips. So i used semisweet chips and added mint extract. Very tasty.

These were good, however I recommend using only one cup of chocolate chips - it was really hard to work in the the full two cups, I ended up taking out about half of them. Also, note that the cookies will retain their shape. I flattened them with my palm before baking them. Also, put 1 tsp of mint extract in place of using the mint chocolate chips, just used regular chocolate chips instead. All in all, one good cookie!

These cookies are OK.  I took someone elses suggestion and only used 2/3 cup oil, if making them again I would use the full 3/4 cup.  I also substituted in almond extract for the vanilla.  The cookies don't really spread out when baking, so I flattened them a little bit with a glass.  As far as taste goes, these are great.  They are a pretty light, delicate cookie.  I'd probably make these again.

Yum! Nice and light. I had a bag if white chocolate mint chips and came here to find a recipe to use them in. I had a hard time with the dough being way too sticky to roll ito balls at room temp, so the rest of the dough is currently chilling in the fridge. These particular chips have little red and green non-pareils on them, so the cookies have a festive look to them.

I used butter instead of oil because that's what I normally use and they came out extremely flat! I'm a little disappointed, but I fear that I had my own errors in calculating them. Also added cocoa powder so as to make the color look better, I may try this again sometime - I just have to be absolutely sure that it won't be too wet!

A delicious cookie! I think I used more than 2 cups of chips; I used a full 10 ounce bag, but it had melted and reformed so I had to break them up; so I didn't measure them in a measuring cup.

I chilled my dough, and found that 2 out of every 14 cookies baked flattened. I ate them. (The rest are for Christmas.) Problem solved, I say!

Bravo for a tasty recipe!

I made this recipe for years and when we moved I lost it.  It has taken me several years to find it; thank you!  It is my son's favorite cookie that I make at Christmas time.  I now will be able to surprise him this year and mail them to him out in Texas.  Thanks again! Delicately minty and soft.

I substituted 1/2 cup butter for the oil like other reviewers, and it was so dry, so I added 1/2 cup milk and used reeses pieces instead of mint chips, since that's what I had on hand.  The dough still was weird so tried to make a big cookie, and wound up making candy bread.  Seriously, it was thick fluffy sweet bread with reeses pieces in it.  Flavor wasn't bad, but it was difficult to work with, and I dunno if I'll make it again.

Not a fan. Used 1/2 cup butter instead of the oil, consistency of the cookies was alright, but too soft and doughy in the middle when the outside was done. The dough itself didn't have much flavor; it was more like just a holder for the chips. They come out looking funny too, I'd try something else if you're looking to impress.

Oh, yum!  Easy recipe with lots of mint flavor.  I couldn't find mint chocolate chips so used a bag of Andes mint chips (for cookies).  Also, the instructions say "the egg" but there are TWO in the ingredients.  Make sure you put them both in!  No need to grease the cookie sheet.

This was my family's all-time favorite cookie for Christmas.  They would search the grocery stores to try to find the mint chips for me when they became rare and are now extinct.  They miss these cookies.  I found, though, that you can put 1/4 teas. mint extract in a zip bag with semi-sweet chips for 24 hours and make your own mint chips, so I'll try again this year.  The taste is not as good if you just put the mint extract in with the mixture.  A few hints for those of you having problems:  Do not use all the chips in the cookie mixture; add to the cookies on the sheet, and as needed in the dough.  Flatten a little with a glass dipped in sugar for a less sweet taste, but barely flatten.  The 1-inch size is okay, but a little bigger is easier to work with and will not over-bake as quickly.  DO NOT over-bake; get them out of the oven and off the cookie sheet before they finish baking or they get hard as a rock; under-bake a little, if possible.  I rate these a 5 for taste, but a 3 for difficulty.  Keep a constant watch while baking.

My kids and I made this as written, and the finished product is delicious! They are easier to handle when chilled, that's for sure. We used a 2 Tbs. scoop to drop them onto the sheets, instead of rolling them, and just had to manage some escape chips a bit. Very tasty, I don't miss the butter at all.

I really enjoy these! They are quite sweet, and it was a little difficult to keep the chocolate chips in the dough, but overall, they were excellent! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and they seemed to work just fine. I had to bake them for 12-15 minutes, because I made them a little larger than walnut size.

mmm... Very delicious!   I substituted 3/4 C of butter for the oil.   Might I say, it was very delectable. (:

Dry, and too sweet.  I love sweet things, and these are just too much, batter is basically there to hold the mint chocolate chips, and there are too many of them.

A great ladies tea type cookie.  I did use the oil (note most that used butter didn't like the cookies) but I did cut it to 2/3 c. to make sure it wasn't oily. Don't bother w/ the vanilla, I used 2 t. of almond flavoring. Much more flavorful.  Careful w/ the chips, too many, it gets too minty. Dough was thick but it dropped well (I din't roll them) and made a nice cookie shape.
