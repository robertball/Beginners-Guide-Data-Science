I liked it.  I changed the veggies to potatoes and mushrooms.  Next time I'll use whipped or soft cream cheese (or take it out of the fridge early to soften it) so it will mix with the eggs better.

I liked this recipe....with a few changes, I am not a big fan of cilantro but I do like spicy..so I left out the cilantro and I added some green canned chilies, and sauted onions in olive oil and for an added kick I browned some turkey sausage and added to the mix, the cream cheese  makes it fluffy and lite... great recipe  thanks for the post

It was so good that we ate too much of it very quickly and may not make again too soon because of that.  It also stuck to my pan so it came out in pieces but that's probably the fault of my pan.
