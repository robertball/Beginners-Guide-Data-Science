06/20/11  Oh my goodness this was delicious! Was hesitant about making this at first due to the amount of apple cider vinegar, margarine/butter and salt.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the salt.  I cut the salt amount in half, as I was unsure if omitting it would affect the recipe.  To be honest, the next time (and there will be a next time) I make this recipe, I will omit it completely, as I don't normally use salt in my cooking, and I don't think it will be missed.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

DELICIOUS!  I was a little unsure about the 1/4 cup of salt, but I put it in anyway.  This chicken was very moist and flavorful...didn't even need salt on it when we ate.  We will definitely make it again.  One thing to note..the vinegar smell is REALLY strong when you are cooking this.  My nose was tingling even at the back of the house!

I loved it! Don't be intimidated by the vinegar, it actually ends up with a mild flavor. I didn't have quite enough vinegar on hand so I made up the difference with apple juice. Also cut the salt down to 1 tablespoon. It does have a very strong odor when boiling so keep a window open. Next time I may try boiling it on my grill's side burner - no smell in the house and I can transfer it right over to the grill when it's done boiling.

Moist and great tasting.  Made the recipe as written and it was packed with flavor.  Great way to use bone-in chicken.  Thanks Coasterphile for sharing your recipe - it's a keeper.

I must say that I was surprised at the flavor, absolutely delicious. The only change that I might make is reduce the salt by half. But other than that, this is definately something that I would make again.

Really good! Instead of salt, I used chicken seasoning. My family liked it! I used chicken legs and threw them on the George Foreman!

Have made recipe twice and loved it each time!  Sounds weird, smells pungent, tastes amazing.  Skin is crunchy, inside is juicy.  Last time I used chicken leg quarters so cheaper and more juicy.

OMG. My husband and I loved this chicken. My husband said "Don't tell anyone about his recipe we can cook it for company and be a big hit". 
I love vinegar and it had just a hint of it when it finished on the BBQ. Be careful not to overcook in the vinegar it will still cook more on the grill.

This is an awesome recipe. I will definitely have to make this again. I didn't have the full 5 cups of apple cider vinegar and so I only used 2 cups but kept the same amount of Worcestershire sauce at 2 tbps. I also reduced the salt to 1/8 of a cup as other reviewers suggested. I used butter instead of margarine and used boneless chicken breasts. The flavor of these chicken breasts was so delicious. Unfortunately, when I took my chicken breasts off of the grill (I grilled on a stove top pan), the breasts weren't fully cooked through. I ended up halving the breasts and putting them pack in the pan for another 5-6 minutes. This made them a bit less moist, but the flavor was definitely still there. I've learned my lesson and next time I'll halve the breasts before cooking or else pound the breasts to make them thinner. My mistakes aside, the recipe is a keeper!

Ya it's ok but I like my chicken more grilled or breaded or fried.  This is healthier but you can still cook somewhat healthy chicken  if breaded or lightly fried with the right seasonings and drainded of most grease.  Just not all the time.  This chicken to me was ok but kind of boreing.

This was SO wonderful!  Unfortunately I cooked too long in vinegar mix so chicken wasn't as juicy as others report.  

We thought salty-tangy flavor was just right, but if you aren't used to salt in your cooking, I recommend maybe 1/8 cup salt instead of 1/4.  

WILL make again, cooking for no longer than 25 minutes in the vinegar next time!

Unless I'm missing something, you can't taste the vinegar execpt on outside pieces and it's NOT strong. I followed the recipe exactly. Both my husband & I felt the same way. Like another reviewer said, the vingar smell is very, very strong when boiling and after.

I made this more than a few times.  The only changes I made was to only boil the chicken for 20 mins max.  I also use the mixture as a marinade I take it out of the fridge and take the chicken out and bring the brine to a boil and then cook the chicken.

When grilling I add some garlic powder.  If calories are not an issue I add a pat of butter under the skin after I flip them on the grill.

YUMMY !!!!!!

This is amazing.  Stinks to high heaven while you're boiling it, but so worth it.  My husband claims this is the best chicken he's had in his life.

This recipe is fast,easy & delicious.  Like other reviewers I have done this with chicken saddle legs, and wings. I also add some garlic & onion powder and white pepperto the brine mixture. I put the wings in later in the boiling process so they don't fall apart.  Everyone at my house loves it. Don't be intimidated by all the vinegar and salt.

I made a change due to the ingredients I had on hand. ~First off, I only had 4 cups of Apple Cider vinegar on hand, and a 1/4 cup of Cider (only) vinegar.  So, I added 3/4 C of Distilled White Wine vinegar; to get to the 5th. C of vinegar asked for.  Secondly, after reading a number of reviews, I only used 1/3 C of salt.  I also used butter, instead of margarine; as we do not use margarine. 

~The vinegar stunk up my house for HOURS, after only boiling the chicken for 20 minutes!  The recipe states to boil for 30 minutes.  According to another reviewers suggestion, I only boiled for 20 minutes; and that was a little too long as well.  After 6 - 8 minutes total, on the grill, the breasts were a little dry.

~So, the bone-in breasts were too salty; and a little dry.  I may try this recipe a second time with: 5 cups of  FULL Apple Cider vinegar; a little less boil time; and doing the boiling on the BBQ!

I'm in!  This was so good.  I did not change the recipe at all except to use thighs and drums.  (Yes, I went with the full salt, but did use Kosher salt.  Don't be scared!)  Next time I will probably poke the chicken pieces with a fork first to get that salt and vinegar flavor into the interior of the chicken.

This has been a popular recipe in our family for many generations. Passed down from my great grandpa who got it from the Ruritan that he belonged too. Always a favorite at cookouts. We marinate ours in the oven on very lowest setting for hours to set the flavor in then crisp it up on the grill. So yummy. Thanks for sharing. :)

The only change I made was I used parts rather than breasts.  I raise my own meat chickens and rarely buy just breast meat.  My birds are normally very juicy, but this result was rather bland and under-whelming.  It needed some kind of sauce, but I don't know what I would recommend.   It was also rather grey in color.  Not very pretty, even with some char on it.  We ate outside in the dusk,  so I let the veggies be the sta on the plate.  Not bed flavor, but would not make it again.

I loved the flavor but the chicken turned out quit dry, probably due to using skinless breasts. I will definitely try this again because the flavor was awesome!

I think this would have been very good, but they burned on the grill, and were very dried out (too long on the grill?). Probably not worth the extra time needed to poach in the briny mixture; it boiled over while simmering and made a huge sticky mess all over my kitchen stove and cabinets!

I'm giving this a three, because my mother and my husband raved and my kids liked it, but I thought the vinegar flavor was just too overwhelming.
