the hardest part of this recipie was locating the parchment paper. i found out it's located in the 'kitchen gadget' section of the grocery store. i'd never used it before but now i use it for all my recipies. i used this recipie at Christmas & everyone loved it. The dollar store is a greast place to find jars.

I had 9 girls over for my daughters b-day party and they made these. I guess I should have made them and baked them up before hand because the moms who did bake them said they were awful and dry.
A real bummer....

The recipe was a little dry but once you make them into balls and bake them, They are wonderful!  I will use them again!  I did not use parchment paper my Pampered Chef Bar Pan worked great as it was!

Very easy to make and they taste wonderful!!  Didn't use parchment paper though, just gave the cookie sheets a very light spray of Pam.

Delicious! I gave these cookie jars as gifts and got calls back wanting the recipe.  I made them myself without parchment.  Turned out fine.  I will be making these more often. Yummy.

It's so easy to build a jar full of cookie dough. Then making the cookies is very easy as well. But the best is their taste; excellent!

I agree they were dry... I think a critical ingredient was left off (like milk?).  I added a 1/4 cup of milk and it was much improved.

I tried this recipe ahead of time and loved it, so I gave these out for holiday gifts. Everyone whos tried them have loved them, but my sister was honest: she said the cookies were good, but spent half an hour chipping the brown sugar out of the jar. I hadn't thought about that factor, but it makes since that four months later the brown sugar would solidify when it was packed in so tightly. Other than that, a great recipe and turns out very pretty. also: crisco works just fine instead of parchment paper.
