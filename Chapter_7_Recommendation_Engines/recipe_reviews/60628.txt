This recipe was amazing.  We used "Wham"; which is vegetarian and fresh okra. added a bit of hickory powder.  A great change from the usual tomatoes and okra.  Thank you.

A friend asked for this for Thanksgiving and I wouldn't admit I had no idea how to make it. Luckily I found this recipe! It turned out great and he loved it. I did substitute smoked ham hocks for the pickeled pork shoulder though.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was mushy and not much taste.

Plain comfort food!  I didn't add the meat or butter.  Because I used fresh not frozen okra, I might have added more than needed, but it worked!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used Chicken Stock to cook instead of water. Love the flavor.

This was really awful!  I do not recommend trying it.
