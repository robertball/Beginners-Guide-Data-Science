This is a tasty recipe.  For those of you who find variations on this recipe bland, it is important to note that you **must** use Basmati rice to make this dish, as the Indians do.  Basmati has a fairly rich, nutty flavour that contributes to the delicate spice flavours.  If you are making this with regular long grain rice, yes it will be bland to some. Basmati is available in the foreign foods section of most North American grocery stores.  Also one could probably stand to cut the butter down a bit if one were trying to cut calories out of this dish.

I love this rice.  I've made it at LEAST a dozen times and my husband has officially declared it illegal for me to make "regular" rice again.  It takes a little longer than regular rice, but it's sooooo worth the extra effort!  This dish is aromatic and TASTY.  Do yourself and your family a favor and make this once.  You'll NEVER go back.  Thank you Kimber for this wonderful recipe!

Basmati rice is a MUST!  I used only 2 tbsp of olive oil instead.  If you don't have Saffron threads 2 tsp of tumeric powder also adds a nice flavor! I also toss about 1 tbsp of sesame seeds at the beginning when I fried the spice.  It goes well with just about every kind of Asian food.

This looks just like a recipe that my Indian grandmother passed down to me.  I also add 4-5 bay leaves at the beginning.  It goes really well with South Indian dishes.  And yes, basmati rice is a must!

This rice gives new meaning to the word AROMATIC!  It smells great and tastes great.  Much stronger saffron flavor than any restaurant I've been in yet.  I used the recommended Basmati rice.  I don't think it's been mentioned yet that Basmati rice benefits from being rinsed a couple of times with cold water before being cooked--it cleans off the talc that is added for shipping and storing.  I've found Basmati rice in the ethnic section of the discount-foods type grocery stores or in any Arab/Indian specialty stores.  BY THE WAY, the Saffron was 1/2 the price at an Indian Store than it was in an American grocery store...worth the search!

At first I did not like the flavor of this dish, however by the end of the dish I had completely changed my mind this is a dish I will make again for sure. I did not have basmatti rice so the next time I will be sure to and see what kind of differance it makes!

Fabulous recipe. 2 T olive oil is plenty. One time I sprinkled in some fennel, mustard, and caraway seeds since I didn't have any cardamom, and didn't really notice a difference - the cinnamon and cloves are the strongest flavors. Also added a tsp. turmeric when I stirred in the rice.

Not overly fussy to make and the extra work does make a difference. I had it with lamb kebabs.

I would say that my rice was cooked and fluffy after about 20 minutes, I wouldn't leave it for 40 minutes!

Excellent. I made this to accompany a medieval feast and it was a hit. I added slivered almonds at the end. I will definitely be making this again.

Takes a bit of time, but tastes INCREDIBLE.  I use twice as much saffron as reccommended - awesome!  Also goes great with Satay chicken recipe!

If they served rice in heaven, this saffron rice may be it!!  Very easy to make, and very rich in flavor. Though you only use 4 cloves, they add a lot of flavor, so does the cinnamon. Only one observation: It didn't take nearly 40 minutes for the rice to cook. It only took 8-10 minutes for the rice to absorb all the water, and when I tasted it, it was completely cooked.

This was not that much of an effort. It's how you make good rice. Basmati is the way to go. Next time I think I'll make it with some slivered almonds and either dried cranberries or currants. My rice took about 20 minutes, not 40...so pay attention while it's cooking.

I only give it 4 stars because I had no idea about the soaking of the saffron. I made the rice because I purchased the saffron after hearing how good the rice is with it. I have always used a little oil never butter (butter makes the rice mushy, while oil makes rice granules fluffy and separate). I never use olive oil not even the light taste because it imparts the olive flavor. I like using corn oil (yes, even canola oil has a certain aroma) as it seems to be the most neutral in taste. I recommend storing the basmati in the fridge (I have had two bags that were infested with weevils).

This recipe is delicious but I usually cook basmati rice with a liquid to rice ratio of 2 to 1 and it cooks very quickly (15 Minutes) when it is rinced and has soaked for 30 minutes.  It always comes out very fluffy that way.  Has anyone found they needed to add more broth to this recipe?  Also Costco sells a large bag of Indian basmati rice for a great price.

This is a very different version of saffron rice. I wasn't sure I liked it at first..but the more I ate the more it grew on me. Only changes were I used a pinch of ground cardamom...did not have seeds...and used 2 cinnamon sticks instead of 3. I was a little worried it would end up cinnamon rice. I would not personally want more. Hubby really disliked it at first....but it grew on him too..though not as much as me. My big summary is that this definitely has a middle eastern feel to it for flavor. Next time I think I will make it with half brown or wild rice for more added nutty flavor. I did make it a second time and played with it a bit. Since the flacor was potent and those with an "uneducated" palate (aka kiddos) didn't like it I made with brown rice (for nutty flavor) but half of all the spices for a tones down version. That went over a lot better for general appeal. I also added almonds for a pilaf type dish.

Very flavorful!! Basmati is mandatory.  Also, I used ghee instead of the butter.  Because I only had ground cloves and cardamom, I used 1/4 tsp. and 1 tsp. respectively.  Also,  I knew my saffron wasn't very strong so I increased it to 1 1/2 tsp. and added ~ 3/4 tsp. of tumeric as well.  This filled my house with a wonderful aroma and it went very well with 'Steamed Lemon Grass Crab Legs' and a nice spinach salad!! Thanks for the recipe!

This makes a delicious delicately flavored fluffy rice.  The changes I made : Basmati rice, chicken stock, and more cardamom straight from the pods.  The aromas dance throughout the kitchen.  We ate with Juicy Roasted Chicken.

I didn't understand what to do with the solid spices -- cinnamon, clove and cardamom -- and asked others in the group. We decided to remove them from the butter after frying, which was difficult with the cloves and cardamom seeds. I added a shake of ground cinnamon and ground cloves. Will try the recipe again, but only after reading other versions of Saffron Rice and figuring out a better process for the spices. The rice was good-not-great.

I used basmati rice that I rinsed and soaked for 30 minutes.  I also used chicken broth.  I read somewhere about using a folded tea towel and put it between the lid and the pot which worked great and seemed to catch some of the moisture and keep the rice fluffy and dry.  Will make again.

I made this for 2 of my husband's co-workers that came to Texas for a month from India.  I, for one, am in love with this rice!  It is so fragrant and delicious.  The guys from India said it was good, too, although they were so polite about everything and had nothing negative to say the entire time they were here!  :)  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making it again!

Eating this rice was like eating a bouquet of flowers... in all the right ways.  I'm generally blase about rice, but it was so good that the leftovers didn't last 2 days.

This is different. First I want to say that I never cooked with saffron threads and cinnamon sticks, therefore using these ingredients was a first for me. I had to use powder cardamon seeds and powder cloves in place of whole cardamon and cloves. The rice was good, but not the best rice I had. Rice was a little bland, so I had to add a bit more salt to rice then what the recipe required.

I altered this recipe just a little bit. Used one 14.5 oz can veg broth, added some garlic powder & one 14.5 oz can Hunts Fire Roasted tomatoes and used brown rice instead of the long-grain. It was really good! My husband & I enjoyed the rice with our salmon & carrots!

Outstanding recipe.  I used California Calrose Rice with great results.  This is a very flavorful and aromatic dish that accompanied pan fried wild halibut and steamed Swiss chard perfectly.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Delicious!  I would suggest using a fairly small onion.  Added cashews when I added the rice to the saute mixture and golden raisins when I added the broth. Made my house smell so wonderful.  Plan to make again in the near future.

A delicious use of your time. Well worth the effort and exploding with flavor. I don't know if it is traditional and I don't care, I liked it!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this rice and the fragrance makes me drool just thinking about it. My family thought it was ok but their palates are limited...

Some of the best rice I've ever had in the world, Saffron is actually a pretty nice spice. For the first time making rice, I think it was pretty successful.

Saffron rice is one of the best, I found saffron from Amazon, the best one was Mahsun Saffron with a good price.
 And also you can buy it from their website:

Made the recipe just as it was printed.  Loved the layers of seasonings: saffron, cloves, cardamom, onions, and cinnamon, and the nuttiness of the basmati rice. However, the rice was ready after only 20 minutes of simmering in the broth.

Absolutely delicious!  I used ghee (clarified butter) instead of regular butter and chicken broth instead of veggie broth.  I also added a pinch of salt for added taste.  Excellent recipe.

Woo Woo Woo! I love Indian dishes, spicy or not. So I've made this about 3 times because I can never seem to keep onions in the house. We just got finish celebrating Thanksgiving, and I had so much food that I hadn't used so it was the perfect opportunity to make my favorite saffron rice dish. I used basmati, of course, had some celery on hand, chopped up one stalk (about 7 or 8 ribs) and added that when I added the rice. I also added sliced Cajun Conecuh sausage when it was time to add the onion, and fresh pineapple, chopped, when I added the broth. I used 6 chicken bullion cubes to 3 cups of water and instead of cinnamon sticks, because I had none, I used 2 tbsp of ground cinnamon. I also used cumin seeds. Fantastical! At the end when it was finished, I added fresh chopped

First time I made this I used cardamom and some people were allergic- Use equal parts cinnamon and nutmeg in place of ground cardamom (5 whole = 1/4 tsp ground).
Perfect!  It's just a little bland so definitely use as a side dish.

Wonderful side dish.  Even my 18 month old loved it.  I had to use chicken broth, but look forward to having it with vegetable broth next time.  I make a lot of Persian food and was able to use the spices, as well as Basmati rice in the recipe.  Took about 15-20 minutes to cook after I added the broth. Not sticky or gummy, just right.  Yum!

Had it for company. Everyone loved it. Son and husband said to save the recipe. Did not have saffron or cardamon seeds so just used cloves and cinnamon sticks. Will cook again!

I should have read the reviews first. Definitely need to cut back on the butter. I also think my saffron must be too old because this didn't have much flavor, mostly tasted like butter.

Excellent! Loved this. I didn't have cardamon seeds (did put ground cardamon in the cart, but couldn't find it anywhere when I started cooking). Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely. My rice was done in 25 minutes though & I didn't have time to soak the rice for a half hour. It only soaked 5 minutes and it still turned out well. Oh, and  Chicken broth because I didn't have veggie.

Yum!  I didn't use whole cardamom or cinnamon, so I used ground, but it was still lovely.  I also made this entirely in the rice cooker, including the sauteeing of the onions and other ingredients; it really was pretty easy.  Absolutely delicious!  Even hubs enjoyed, and I thought he'd be grumpy about the cloves in the dish, but he wasn't.  We do love us some saffron rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Saffron is much cheaper in Israel, and I had ALOT of it. I was starting to worry that it wasn't getting used up quick enough, so I tried this recipe. It was so delicious that I'm having to buy saffron here!

As suggested in the other reviews, I used Basmati rice.  I did rinse it twice, then soaked it for 30 minutes.  I didn't have cloves, and I also added a bay leaf and fresh thyme.  This was VERY flavorful and a BIG hit with the boyfriend. :)  (I made the Garlic Lover's Chicken along with this, using double the garlic in the recipe.)

This recipe is very good, however I use chicken stock cube dissolved in hot water for better taste and omit the salt. U could substitute oil for butter if you’re counting calories.
