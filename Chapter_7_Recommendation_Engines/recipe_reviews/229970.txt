I used my own homemade spiced applesauce. Baked at 350*, these were done at just around 22 minutes. Out of one recipe, I got 18 good sized muffins. My family really enjoyed these.

I'm deployed right now and am always looking for easy recipes to bake in my little toaster oven, and these were a hit. My mom sent a box of spice cake mix, a can of 15oz pumpkin and a bag of cinnamon chips. Baked at 325 for about 20 minutes (toaster oven bakes hot), perfectly moist and flavorful! I didn't have applesauce or pumpkin pie spice, and they still turned out great. Put all of the ingredients in a bowl, used a plastic spoon to mix until blended and had no issues with dryness or rising. They didn't bake with a smooth top like a typical muffin, but that didn't seem to bother anyone!

I really wanted to like these. They were quick and easy to put together but they came out very dry. Also they didn't rise at all, what I put into the muffin tin is exactly what I got out of it. An egg would have made a big difference in the recipe.

I must be missing something... first of all my blender which is a big powerful one didn't have enough liquid to blend, are you supposed to use mix the cake mix as on the box first, then add the rest of the stuff... just didn't work at all for me.

I didn't have the pumpkin pie spice, but decided to make these anyway. I knew they'd be good as a friend had brought some to share at work. I used mini chocolate chips. They are so moist and so delicious! Turned out perfect!!

I didn't have cinnamon chips, which I'm sure would be fantastic, so I added semi-sweet chips in their place.  They were so moist and delicious. I will make these frequently. Thank you for this recipe.

First let me start out and say I love pumpkin anything  So I new when I seen this recipe I had to try it! Woohooo and  I love the fact that they are  low fat! and not to mention such few ingredients I figured how could i go wrong! These are Delicious!I did add a bit more applesauce and chocolate chips instead of cinnamon chips! These are terrific! If you want something quick and low in fat try these!!
