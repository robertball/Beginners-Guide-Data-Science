Absolutely delicious.  The maple syrup really gave the chicken a sweet and savory crisp flavor while the water/syrup bath kept the chicken moist on the inside.  I would have preferred to leave out the chile pepper because I think it was just a tiny bit overpowering but it still didn't detract from the flavor.

loved it, so did the family and that can be tough at times! Used hot peppers from the garden instead of chile peppers.  The sweet and spicy was a great combo and a nice change from turkey for thanksgiving.

I used corn syrup because I didn't have maple syrup.  I only used a slight  sprinkling of cinnamon.   It  tasted okay but the next day it tasted  better.

This was fabulous! I cut the maple syrup down to 2/3 cup - no more was needed - and rather than use chili peppers, which I felt would be too hot for the kids, I used a shake of red pepper flakes. This came out super flavorful, and created lot of gravy, which went wonderfully over couscous.
