The base of this recipe is outstanding, it is so versatile. I toped mine w/portabella, and feta, dropped the olives.  If you turn your oven to the highest setting, sprinkle your pizza pan w/corn meal, before adding the crust.  Then cook the pizza when the whole oven is really hot, the crust is crunchy, and cheese melts perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was very good.  The only thing I did differantly was use a Boboli crust and it turned out great. My family loved it.

This is a great, easy recipe!  I made some slight adjustments...used a "light" alfredo sauce, cut back on the amount of cheese used, and used a pre-made crust.  My 3 yr old niece LOVED it and asked for me to make it again.  Will definitely be a staple in my meals to make.

Only change I made was that I pre-cooked the pizza crust before adding all the toppings. It was not soggy, and it was tasty!

This recipe was great the only thing I would change is lessen the amount of spinach.  The spinach kinda over powered the whole pizza couldn't really taste the alfredo sauce.  On my second try I used 4oz  spinach and I thought it tasted great.

Nice and easy.  I prefer to use fresh veggies, but with my and my partner's schedules, we have to use a lot of frozen and prepackaged items, so this was perfect for us.  I think it could use a bit less alfredo sauce, but I still give it a 5-star rating.

This was a great recipe! I would suggest a little less spinach, it sort of overpowers the taste of the alfredo. Also, I love artichokes, but I think this recipe needs some chicken with it instead of just artichokes. It was tasty though, I'd make it again!

Fantastic recipe - and SO easy.  I froze the left overs and just grab a slice when I'm on the go and zap it in the microwave.  I will definitely make this one again!  (Could maybe use a little garlic.)

Yummy, yum, yum!  I adore spinach on nearly everything!  This was sooo good!  I'm thinking next time, which might just be tomorrow I'll try Feta instead Mozzarella.

I made a few changes...I sauteed the spinach, artichoke, just a few tomatoes and mushrooms in a bit of olive oil. I added garlic salt, the red pepper alfredo sauce and parmesan cheese to the skillet and mixed together until cheese melted. I brushed olive oil and garlic salt on the crust and pre-cooked it. I spread the mixture onto the crust and topped with mozzarella. (too bad hubby doesn't like olives) But it turned out nice. Nothing overpowered. Would be nice with either sauteed onions and/or chicken as well.

Loved this.  I added some ham to the top with the mushrooms.  It was a hit at my get together and I was asked for the recipe.

This recipe was very good, but I made a few changes that would better suit a person on a low-fat, low calorie diet or even a diabetic. I used a Calorie-Free (also fat, sugar and cholesterol -free) Alfredo Sauce. I also added thinly sliced tomatoes, portabella mushrooms, yellow onions and diced green bell peppers. One clove of minced garlic  and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning was added to the alfredo sauce. Mozarella cheese made with skim milk and whole wheat pizza crust was used. I omitted the parmesan cheese and artichokes. This pizza was gone within 5 mins of hitting the dinner table. Taste awesome!

I think had I not tweaked this it would have been a little bland for my family. I added in turkey bacon. I used veggie cheese to cut out dairy and packaged alfredo sauce so I could use soy milk. 

Next time I will cook the dough a little first and use garlic dough. 

Other than that it was easy to do and did not cost much to make.

I used original crescent roll dough for the crust, par baked prior to adding the toppings (next time I will def use the garlic dough!). Also I used fresh mushrooms which turned out great. Turned out very nice if you like a softer crust. Prep and cleanup were a breeze. I halved the recipe and used 1 can of dough. Thanks MLDEWITT!

I had let over chicken  breast so I sliced that up, chopped up 6 cloves of garlic & added that, and in the end, I sprinkled on a 1/4 cup of crumbled Blue Cheese. I used to "cans" of Pillsbury Pizza dough that I brushed with melted garlic butter before adding all the toppings. AWESOME!

Made Alfredo from scratch, sauteed some fresh garlic and green onions with the spinach before putting on pizza, used a pillsbury canned crust and topped with peperoni, black and green olives and mozzarella cheese.  Best pizza I have ever eaten! wannabe_chef on twitter and extremeonlinedeals on youtube

Everybody loved this recipe. I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand and on personal preference.  I used fresh spinach and mushrooms.  I sauteed them in a pan with olive oil.  I skipped the artichokes and olives.  Everything else was as written.  This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper. My boys have already asked me to make it again :)

Fabulous! Just a few changes.  I made my own Alfredo sauce (Easy Alfredo Sauce in Allrecipes), prebaked the crust for 2 minutes on a hot pizza stone before adding the toppings, and no spinach or olives and it was a major hit! I love all types of pizza and this was one of the BEST!

I was not impressed with this recipe as is. Maybe if it was tweaked a bit it could be tasty. I found it a bit dry and salty.

This was excellent, I made into a calzone, but same idea.  I left out the artichokes, but next time I will definitely use them because I think it would be even tastier!

Very good, but I omitted the artichoke hearts (nobody I know likes them).  I added sun-dried tomatoes & fresh bacon bits.  I also made the alfredo sauce from scratch (using the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce on this site, it's awesome).

I made my own gluten free pizza crust for this recipe.  I used Bob's Red Mill pizza crust mix (gluten free) Followed directions on back of package.
For the alfredo sauce I used a gluten free recipe I found online.  The alfredo sauce was the only thing I changed in the pizza ingredients.  What I will do different next time is use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  The frozen gives an overpowering taste.  I also did not care for the artichoke hearts...I will leave them off also.  Other than that I thought this was an awesome pizza.  I have worked in a well known pizza store and have made a lot of pizzas.

i left out the artichoke,olives and added bacon, instead of parmesan and garlic  i used Ragu parmesan and garlic alfredo sauce. It was amazing, shame i only made one.

I Loved it!   My first time making a pizza and it was so easy.  I also added some of the grill chicken that is made for salads. It turned out great!  The ones who had the idea of pre-cooking the crust a little before adding the toppings was a good idea.  I would surely make this again and it gets five stars!

This recipe was very good. Instead of using plain alfredo I used Mushroom Alfredo and also had pre baked crust, but it still came out delicious!

We don't like the mushrooms, artichoke hearts, or olives in the pizza, so we leave those out, and the pizza still tastes amazing!

Missing something. It was also very difficult to cook the pizza crust, and have it not soft on the bottom after the rest finished cooking. It was a very wet pizza and not very balanced, but I enjoyed it, and would love to play around with this recipes some more.

Excellent...I tweaked it a bit - less cheese and I added some diced tomato.  I also made the dough and the alfredo sauce.  Nevertheless - this is a good recipe!

Used a Boboli, spread some chopped garlic on the crust first. I only used about 7oz of spinach and layered that, then the artichokes, then poured jarred Alfredo sauce over all.

This was excellent, and we made it lactose-free by using the "quick and easy alfredo sauce" from this site.

This was an excellent recipe however, I added some garlic and omitted the olives and accidentally left out the parmesan cheese.  Next time I will add the parmesan cheese and I am sure it will be excellent as well.

Very good.  I could only take in small bits, couldn't over eat this, which was good.  My hubbikins really enjoyed it too.  I did however slice up some garlic and put it on top of the sauce, which made it ever better.

My entire family thought this pizza was delicious. The only things I did different was use the entire 16oz. jar of the Clasico three cheese alfredo (the recipe suggests 10oz) because it just did not seem like enough sauce with the 10oz. of spinach mixed in. Also, as other reviewers did, skipped the artichokes and substituted chicken (I cut up three medium-sized chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces) and mixed it with some sauteed minced garlic. I used the Pillsbury dough and it took much longer than 20 minutes (more like 30-35 and the toppings almost started to burn), so I probably wouldn't recommend using that. The recipe itself - WONDERFUL!

I have made this many times now.  I think it is great when I want a pizza, but I am sick of the same old thing.  It is a nice way to dress up an easy meal.

I added some chicken and garlic to the ingredients and it was fantastic. I think with out the additions it would have been a tad bland for my taste, but overall it's very yummy.

Made this for lunch, scaled to 1 pizza. Added pieces of chicken and slices of roma tomatoes and omitted the olives. Delicious! Will make again! Thank you.

Maybe I'm just not a huge spincah fan, but I thought it was a little bland. My husband really liked it.
