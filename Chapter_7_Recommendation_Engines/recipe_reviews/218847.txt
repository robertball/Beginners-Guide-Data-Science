Wonderful and easy recipe.  I served mine over farfalle and it was perfect for us.  We love, love Johnsonville Italian sausage.  I removed the casings and quick-fried pieces of the sausage along with my onions and peppers.  I then added the tomatoes and let it simmer about an hour just to impart all the fabulous flavors.  Leftover sausage and peppers will make a terrific hot sandwich.  Great recipe!!

We just loved this.  I have to admit that this is not the first time that I have made this, we have it regularly.  Love this sausage and we usually eat it as a sandwich.  Tomatoes on the bottom of the bread with sausage, onions and peppers piled on top.  Too yummy.

This was delicious!  My family ate the entire batch and asked for more! The Johnsonville sausages were absolutely delicious.  Perfecto!

This recipe is very similar to Johnsonville Italian Sausage and Pepper Skillet. The two main differences between these two recipes: (1) this one has more liquid to it because of the amount of tomatoes and (2) it doesn't have basil like the other one. The other one is perfect for making a sandwich whereas this one is perfect over pasta. Both are delicious, quick, and very easy to make.

We love sausage and peppers.  It is so easy and tastes great.  I served it over penne pasta with garlic bread.

I was looking for something easy with ingredients I had on hand... I never expected it to taste so amazing. Even my kids loved it and that says a lot!  It will be a recipe I keep on hand again and again!

Excellent recipe! It screamed spaghetti noodles for me! Loved it! I used the hot Italian sausage but that's what we love!

This recipe was quick, easy, and had a good flavor. My only issue is, it yielded a lot more sauce than I expected and so I am not sure how to serve this. I was thinking it was kind of like the sausages in the buns. However, after following the directions as is, it seems more like something one would put over rice or something similar. I did have to cook the peppers and onion about 7-8 minutes before adding the sauce instead of the suggested 2. Still a quick meal to get on the table. ty

This was so simple and turned out delicious. My husband never eats Italian sausage I caught him tasting it next thing I knew almost the whole pot was gone.  I followed it exactly and will be adding to our rotation.

I didn't have Italian tomatoes so I added a 14oz can of pizza sauce.  My husband loved it!  Just the right amount of sauce.  I will definitely make again!

This came together super easy! I love those kind of recipes. I served it on a sausage roll and added Ore-Ida tater tots on the side. This was a great meal to serve up in a hurry.

I nice, easy to throw together recipe that the family enjoyed.  I added extra pepper and onion and served over orecchiette pasta.  This would also be great on a sandwich, over rice, or even on it's own!

I make something very similar with my johnsonville Italian sausage. I just use tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes. I use different pastas depending on my mood. Angel hair pasta is awesome with this recipe.

Pretty classic combination.  I make something similar on occasion, but I never thought to add the tomatoes. I like it served as a sandwich...yum!
