This is a yummy recipe, however, I made a few changes.  Instead of the penne pasta I used boil in a bag white rice.  I also added some cilantro in for taste. And instead of  heavy cream I used 2% fat milk.  My fish began to crumble when I put the other ingredients in so I stirred everything in except for the rice and created a gumbo-like mixture.   I forgot to put in the spinach, but it turned out delicious anyway.   I placed the mixture over a bed of  boil in the bag rice, because I have not perfected my rice cooking skills.  It turned out excellent.  It reminded us of a Pappadeaux menu item.  My husband was extremely pleased and I will most definitely make this again.  Thank You

This dish (with a few modifications) is absolutely one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.  If you're browsing this site looking for something to do with those fillets you've got in the freezer, STOP LOOKING NOW!!  You've found it!

First of all, I recommend serving it over rice instead of pasta.  I've tried both, and rice just seems to fit better.  Secondly, the amount of liquid listed in the recipe is nowhere near enough.  I use 2/3 cup cream and 1/3 cup lemon juice (for 4 fillets).  I also use more jalapenos, enough to fill 1 cup when diced.  Usually that amounts to about 4 largish ones or 6 smaller ones.  Finally, the listed amount of cayenne pepper might be a little too strong for some people, especially with the increased amount of jalapenos.  I use 1/4 teaspoon and it still packs a nice punch without burning your mouth off.

Follow the directions as listed, except mix together the sauce ingredients (except the spinach and tomato) in a measuring cup FIRST.  If you add them all the skillet one by one, mixing them will be impossible without breaking up the tilapia.  When mixing in the spinach later, add a little bit at at time to make mixing it in easier.  Put the rice (or pasta) on the plate first, then top it with the sauce and fillets.  Finally, I recommend sprinkling the chopped tomato over top of the fillets after they're on the plate.  That way the tomato pieces will stay firm, and plus it adds a lot to the presentation.

Bon appetit!

This was a delicious dish.  We loved it.  The next time I make it I will make double the sauce because it is so great.  That is the only thing I would change though - very tasty and has a kick to it.

I just finished using a portion of this recipe, i omitted the pasta & spinach, i added seasoned panko to my batter, used an entire can of jalapeno (minced in my food processor) and drained most of the oil before adding the ingredients for the sauce. The sauce makes the dish, so don't let it be absorded by pasta and spinach. Put your veggie on the side and enjoy the jalapeno sauce on the fish!  I paired it with the southwestern roasted corn recipe also found on this site.  Got rave reviews!!

Great recipe, the fish came out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The flavor was delicious. Pasta didn't really seem to go with it. There was very little sauce left over after pan frying the fish. Maybe I messed up somewhere but I would have preferred the fish with some couscous or rice instead.

Very good!  Next time I will make it with shrimp because the fish doesnt hold up.  I added some cajun seasoning to it for extra flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this at least 3 times since I found it and we love it! I serve the fish over brown rice and spoon the spicy cream and tomatoes over it instead of mixing everything together. And, even though we love spicy, I cut the cayenne in half and it still has a good kick for us. My super picky husband loves this dish.

I wasn't sure how much I'd like this recipe.  It was such a pleasant surprise how delicious it really was.  Perfect amount of heat.  Great use of tilapia.  I think next time though, I wont fry the fish and just cook it as is.  The sauce provided so much flavor I think frying it is unnecessary.  I think the tilapia could easily be substituted with chicken or shrimp.

very very tasty,  used whole wheat pasta and tortilla crusted talapia.  Added chopped cilantro at the end with the tomatos.  I agree, you need to double the sauce recipe

I coated the shrimp in the sugar and prepared everything else the same and then added a little at the end. Great recipe and its a "do it again" in my fam:-)

OMG!  This dish was delicious! Thank you for sharing. I did not have heavy whipping cream on hand so I used half and half. I did not use tomatos because my family does not eat them. Those minor changes did not affect the outcome. After I served it up, we sprinkle it with parmesan cheese. My family of four enjoyed it.  My eldest daughter told me to remember to post a comment. My husband who does not like spinach loved it. This will be a family favorite for sure.

Tried this last night, I really liked it because the flavor was awesome (I like hot) but my husband didn't because it just looked like a pile of mush.  Next time, I will not put the fish on top.  I will serve the dish with fish and rice side by side and top them off with the sauce.  

I will also saute the chilies, onion, garlic before adding the cream or tomatoes.  I will make it again because I know this can be a winner but I just need to make it work for my family.

Made this for the fam, and it was a hit!  
I only made a few changes...
I doubled the sauce like others suggested, omitted the tomato, and wilted the spinach separately. 
It all came together just as quickly as the recipe said it would.
 For serving, plated the pasta, added the fish fillets, poured the sauce over top, and used the wilted spinach almost as a garnish.  
Looked and tasted amazing!  
Definitely a keeper!

Loved it. I followed the recipe except I left out the tomatoes and doubled the sauce. Next time I will add less garlic powder, I love garlic but found it to be a little too much.

This is my first review but I had to, this was amazing! I made it "lighter" so I didn't feel guilty.  Instead of dipping in melted butter I just sprayed a little "I can't believe it's butter" then dipped in flour.  Used half/half instead of cream and a dash of chicken stock to help make more sauce.. DELISH!!

I make this a few times a month and we LOVE it. We also make more sauce (maybe triple the amount called for), and I also add sun-dried tomatoes because I think it gives it even more flavor.

I don't see how anyone can cook 4 pieces of fish in 2tbs of oil. I should have made an adjustment but decided to follow the recipe's measurements since no one mentioned it. The flour just caked up in the pan. I made it again minus the flour a nd added more oil but would still only give this one star

So awesome- the lemon juice makes the sauce. We did not have spinach so served it over chopped romaine lettuce as a pasta salad. It was even good cold. Also easy to make it kid-friendly by removing fish before step 3 and serving with some reserved pasta on the side. 2 and a half year old has refused all fish to date until trying it cooked this way- she was licking her fingers before we even started eating. Yum, thanks. Neigh.

My boyfriend and I made this. We made a couple of changes, for our preferences and LOVED IT!
We are looking forward to trying this again with a different type of protein. 

We included chopped onion with the Jalapeno's, TASTY!

In a word AWESOME! Even my 15 yr old extremely picky daughter loved this dish. We made this the other night for a friends birthday dinner and it was a hit with everyone. Simple, quick and delicious. What more could you ask for?

Made exactly as written this is a dry dish.  Fish flaked apart in pan, which was fine.  I removed seeds and ribs from the jalapenos, so not overly spicy.  Leftovers were even more dry.  Recommend doubling sauce or using less pasta.

Wonderful recipe. I doubled the sauce, used only 1/8 tsp. cayenne, substituted with half & half, and whole wheat spaghetti. Definitely will cook again. Very rich and filling. A generous serving for 4.

That was the best tilapia dish I've ever had! I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles to give it a little healthy kick. Awesome.

Delicious! I altered the recipe to 6 servings, and adding the extra jalapeño was a bit much.

It turned out very tasty, but next time, I would cook the fish and the sauce in different pot and just combin them before serveing, otherwise the sause is all absort by the fish.

My family (which I must admit are rather picky and not fond of spicy food) didn't like this at all--even though I put only one jalapeno pepper rather than two.   They requested that I delete it.  I thought it was okay (but far from great).

Okay, so I can't rate the fish, because I swapped with chicken, but the pasta recipe is great.  Pretty spicy, but not too overbearing.  Very quick and easy recipe.  Next time will add more tomoatoes and linguini instead.

This recipe is an easy 5 stars. It is a bit spicier so it's maybe a medium rather then mild.. Decided to double it and I definitely needed a bigger pan but it turned out awesome. Taking it to work where there are some fish haters so we will see how it goes. This is my third time making it and I love having leftovers. Have recommended this to quite a few friends.

I visited to a local "country italian" restaurant for a company Christmas party and had a tilapia pasta meal that blew my mind. For weeks I wanted to go back but it was very costly. I was soooo excited to find this recipe!!!! It is as good as the restaurant's dish. My kids loved it!! Great recipe!!!! Thank you so much. Now I can make it any time I want.

That was soooo YUMMY!!!  My husband and my kids (7 & 1) all loved it, as I did.  I think everyone had 2 helpings.  This is totally a keeper recipe.  It would be interesting to see if it tastes as good if all the items were layered instead of mixed together?!!

My husband said this was the best dish I had ever made. I love linguini with clam sauce, but never could get it the way I wanted. I tried this recipe and found it (only with tilapia). So so good. Even my 4 year old ate two bowls. 
I made a few changes though. I doubled everything in the sauce (including butter and garlic). I Didn't have any cream, so I used equal amount of evaporated milk, no lemon so I used half the amount of apple cider vinegar and left out jalapenos and cayenne pepper and used a few canned Roma tomatoes instead of fresh.

My family really loved this dish. My youngest son proclaimed it to be 'perfect'! The only changes I really made to the recipe were to add extra spinache, because we all love it, and just about tripled the sauce...otherwise it would have been much drier. I was looking for quick and easy recipes for a change of pace to spice up my repertoire, and this one really hit the spot. I will be making this again soon. Thanks for sharing!

This dish was awesome!  The only thing I did differently is that I didn't bother with dredging the tilapia in flour before frying, and I also made double (maybe triple) the sauce.  It is ALL about the sauce.  I agree with others that this may be better over rice, of even over linguini perhaps. I don't think penne is a good match.  I will definitely keep this in my line-up and will also try it with shrimp and chicken.

I thought this was very tasty.  I also would double the recipe for the sauce and maybe use half the salt that the recipe calls for.  The sauce was great on the pasta by itself too and could be served without the fish altogether i think.   I didn't have tilapia so i used mahi mahi and it held up great!

This was "the bomb" according to my fiance. haha.  We both loved it.  While I was making it I was nervous because I thought it would be more "saucy" but, it was absolutely awesome.  I also added some onions with the peppers, just 'cause.  Great recipe!

Used half & half instead of heavy cream, and whole grain pasta, to try to control the calories and fat a little. Still came out pretty good. Might add some onions and green pepper next time.

Just got done making this and it was just delicious!  One of the best dishes I've made at that ease level.  I used Smart Balance Light and Half and Half to make it a little lighter.  My husband made fresh pasta and it matched perfectly.  I did end up taking the fish out of the pan for a few minutes in order to properly mix the spices, then added some more half and half and a little more Smart Balance.  Easy and wonderful - we are already planning on making it again.

I don't know what happened but I followed the recipe exactly and it ended up with very little sauce and very little spice or pizazz at all!! My husband and I were both disappointed. it needs some fresh herbs maybe basil or cilantro to kick it up. and the sauce can easily be doubled or maybe the pasta cut in half. I might try it again with a few major modifications!!

this was very good.  I however used two Large Peppers and it was a bit hot.  I also used the other suggestions and doubled the sauce.  I wish I would have taken a pic of it because it did not look like I thought it might.  After mixing in the pasta and spinach, the fish was broken up.   It was very good though, and My husband ate it and he doesn't like fish or spinach!!!

We coated the fish with cajun seasoning and grilled both the fillets and the jalapenos, then followed the recipe as written.  While enjoyable and easy to make it did lack a wow factor that would earn it's place in my recipe file.

TOTALLY DELICIOUS!!!! I fried the tilapia as instructed but took it out of the pan  I sautéed onions in the remaining garlic margarine , then added 3x's the sauce recipe along with capers and Kalamata olives. Didn't have the fresh tomatoes but added 1/2 a can fire roasted diced tomatoes. Added the tilapia back in and broke it into chunks Served over the pasta and topped with shredded parmesan!

The flavor was really good, but the tilapia got super mushy. I would make it again, but with chicken instead. The mushy texture was very off putting.

This was awesome and I will be repeating.  The only changes I made were using almond flour for the breading.  I fried the fish and made the sauce separate.  I served the fried fish over rice instead of pasta and topped with the sauce.

This was one of those recipes that made me frown as I read the ingredients but based on the reviews I tried it anyway. So glad I did. I doubled the sauce as others suggested and I used instant rice instead of pasta because that's all I had. This was shockingly good and I will make this again and again. Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe is the reason I started using Allrecipes.  It is simply excellent!  The only changes I make are that I like to double the sauce and that I use about 1/4 tsp of Vitamin C instead of lemon or lime juice as my girlfriend is allergic to citrus fruit.  Works great with spiralized veggie pastas. Enjoy this wonderfully flavorful and spicy dish!

I made this last night. I didn't have any jalapeño peppers so I used green peppers, but with the cayenne pepper it still had a good kick. It seemed like a lot of steps but it was worth it! My husband and I both loved it!

Flavors were wonderful together.  I did double the sauce as suggested in other reviews.  Tip:  don't double salt and spices in doubling the sauce - it's way too salty and spicy that way!  Also, I made it gluten free (GF pasta and flour) and it turned out well.

Very good, light, but filling meal.  I made no changes.  In the future I might use one jalapeno because not everyone in the house likes spicy.  I LOVE spicy, so it was perfect for me.  And it was pretty to look at, too.

I made this with chicken as hubby said "no fish today please" I used milk in stead of cream and used less pasta as there were only 2 of us.  Other than that I followed instructions as is.  It was amazing.  I can't wait to try it with shrimp, fish, and beef.

I made this last night!
Instead of pasta I used brown rice and I marinated my fish in Cajun spice over night, so the next day when I came home from work I coated the fish with wheat flour and cooked it!!
The fish was delicious and the sauce was to die for!!!! I agree with everyone else!!! So I made sure when I made it I made plenty of sauce!!! The only thing I wish was I made it hotter!!
Simple, easy and great to fill you up without filling guilty!!!!!

Awesome! Followed the advice of others and doubled the lemon and cream. Added a bit of parmesan to the flour and to the finished top of the dish. I did not add the pasta to the skillet but served it with the fish on top. Delish!

This was bursting with flavor! I did make it alittle different, i didnt add any of the hot spices, added a half tablespoon of basil instead, and instead of flour i covered my tilapia in bread crumbs (i had italian flavor) then baked it for 5 min on each side. I didnt add the heavy cream and spinach because i didnt have any, plus i think its better without those, and lastly i added a little of parmesan cheese at the end. Really easy and fast and definitely the best pasta ive ever made

Forgot to buy Tilapia at the store so I used chicken and shrimp, the dish turned out super.  Two jalapeños made the dish a little hot, will try one next time.

My melted butter got cold when I dipped my fish before frying.  Had to reheat it to get the fillets coated.  The sauce had a very nice flavor but there is not enough of it.  My filets crumbled when tossing the sauce.  It may work out better to plate the fish before adding sauce.  The pasta absorbed the sauce very quickly so more sauce would be helpful.  With a few minor changes to the method of preparation and a little more sauce this could be a 5.  I will try it again for sure.  :)

Wonderful!   I let the fish completely fall apart into the "sauce".  I might try making sauce separate from the fish next time and pour over the fried filets.   Maybe double the liquid needed for sauce (cream and lemon juice)?

We eat this at least twice a month.  This is the best recipe ever.  I doubled the sauce because we like sauce.  I spoon the sauce over the tilapia and pasta instead of mixing it all together.  I have also tried this over basmati rice and I prefer penne pasta.  Stef

My husband LOVED this dish, but I did make a few changes. I fully cooked the fish and removed it from the skillet. Then I prepared the sauce in the same skillet and spooned it over the fish before we ate. This was great because the fish was crispy. I also doubled the cream as some reviewers recommended. I used Mexican cream (similar to sour cream) and I added a little bit of milk because it was too thick. I did not add the cayenne pepper, paprika, or garlic powder as I felt that the sauce was savory (and spicy) enough without them. The pasta really doesn't work with this dish, I recommend serving it with white or brown rice.

I used chicken tenders instead of tilapia and it turned out very good.  I doubled the sauce and still added about an extra 1/2 cup of milk---it just seemed like there wasn't much sauce.  It had a very nice bite from the jalapeno and I will definitely make again!  Next time I will have all of my spices measured and ready to go and the lemon juice squeezed---it just seems like I was dashing around trying to get it all together after I put the cream in the pan.

This is the best tilapia recipe I have tried. I used half-and-half instead of cream, and I broke up the fish after it cooked so that it was evenly distributed when I stirred in the spinach, tomato and pasta. It has a nice kick to it. Definitely a keeper.

This was super delish!! I will definitely make it again. The only things that I changed were that I doubled the cream cause there didn't seem to be enough sauce, and I also added cilantro. Very easy and very yummy. If you don't like spice, take the seeds out of the jalapeno and use less cayenne. I loved the spice though, it was perfect. I added more cayenne than called for.

As unbelievable as this sounds, this recipe was absolutely tasteless.  So disappointing, I wanted to cry.  And tons of work.  Removing from my recipe box now.

Absolutely worth making. This was awesome and took little to no work. I would suggest adding 1/3 to 1/2 cup of heavy cream instead of the 1/4 cup. The dish was dry with only 1/4 cup. I ommited the tomatoes (hate tomatoes). Other than those two modifications this recipies is a 5 Star winner.

This recipe was fantastic. I separated the sauce prior to cooking the Tilapia, in order for my vegetarian sister to have it without, and it was just as great. Thank you!

This was really good . . super easy which was surprising for how good it tasted.  I used Mahi Mahi instead, just because it was what I had around. Also I chunked it up after it was cooked just so I could get the good saucy flavor all over it. Also used cilantro instead of spinach because it's what I had, sounds weird with noodles but worked really good considering all the other ingredients.  Definately a keeper

I made some minor changes based on suggestions/what I had on hand. Mixed about 6 crushed crackers in with the crust for more crunch. Cooked fish in some of the butter mix instead of oil. Cooked fish through and took out of pan. Used whole milk instead of cream, upped lemon to 3T, subbed 2 tsp crushed red pepper for jalapenos and added about 1/8 C cilantro. Served layered, with pasta on bottom, spinach in middle and fish on top. SO GOOD!

Wow.. this was so good!! I used garlic salt in the melted margarine and used bread crumbs to coat it instead of flour so that it is more crispy. I also used 2% milk instead of cream and frozen spinach. I also added some bell pepper strips for flavor. I did not mix the fish and the pasta but instead served the fried fish on a bed of the pasta. It was like we were eating a restaurant-made dish. Yummy!! Thanks for sharing!
