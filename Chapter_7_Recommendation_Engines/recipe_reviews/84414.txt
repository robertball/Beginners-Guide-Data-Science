I wanted to like this. Flakes never softened. It's a great idea- but next time I would cook the instant potatoes in the microwave like I usually do, then add the mayo, relish, mustard, & onion.

This works well as a "mashed potato salad" if you're really broke and you want to make a cheap side out of whatever you have in your cupboard. Usually, you'll always have potato flakes on hand. To make it a little....more pleasing, I would recommend you use low sodium or organic chicken broth to reconstitute the potatoes and instead of milk you use a little sour cream. You can add what you would to this potato salad to make it more hearty, just like you would a regular potato salad like chopped celery, eggs and bacon. It's great in a pinch and it's always super filling and it's never the same as it was the last time. GREAT for White Trash Parties!

i do not know if it matters what brand of instant potatoes you use, but i used Kroger, and this came out like potato soup. made an additional cup of flakes with one cup boiling water, added to the cold first batch, and it corrected the consistency problem, but had to double all the other ingredients to adjust the taste. to each serving, added a hard boiled egg, a little fresh ground pepper and garlic salt, and it was a nice quick substitute for potato salad from scratch. will play with the recipe and post my findings :)

I did not care for this. Mine tasted okay, but the consistency was like loose grits. The amount of liqued in this recipe was twice what the potato box called for, and I could never add enough additional potatoes to get it right. I don't think I'll be trying this one again, easy as it is.

This does taste like potato salad with the mustard and mayo but then all you can taste is the cardboard taste from the insant mashed potatoes. I had to add another half cup to cup of the flakes and I only added 1 tbls of the milk. I would not make this again, my kids wouldn't eat it they said it looked like baby food.

Next time I will cook according to box directions and then add the other ingredients.  I wish I had read reviews first. I am hoping it is less grainy after it has set a while.

Just tried this, it is great, but I changed two things, I added another teaspoon of relish and warmed it slightly in microwave. Oh, and I heated the flakes and water in microwave for 2 minutes before adding rest of ingredients so the flakes will all dissolve.

I made this with high hopes.  I used Hungry Jack instant potatoes.  It just didn't have any real taste to it.  It could have been just me but I wouldn't make it again.  My husband said, you tried something new, didn't work; no biggie!  I appreciate trying it though.
