WE LOVED THIS!!!! I only used 1/2 cup flour and chicken broth in place of the water/boullion b/c I had that on hand (I actually used a 32oz. carton). Also, I do not use canned chicken, so I used some fresh chicken breasts that I baked in the oven w/ evoo, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Perfect amount of spice for us...used salt and pepper to taste. This was a HUGE hit at dinner tonight and I already have requests to make it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This had very good flavor.  But 3/4 cup flour is way to much.  I would cut down to a few tablespoons.  More like a dip this way.
