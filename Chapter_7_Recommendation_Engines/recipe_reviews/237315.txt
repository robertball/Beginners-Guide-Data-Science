I've made this several times, as written and with variations.  I've used bacon instead of ham, and scrambled instead of boiled eggs. It's delicious every time.

This is exactly what the recipe is supposed to be!  I did add a little Tajin to mine.  I could have used a little more flavor, but that's not what this was advertised to be.  So in that respect, this fit the bill.  I do think that you could use less sauce for the amount of egg and ham.  A biscuit would maybe have produced more flavor, too, than my English muffin.  I'm thinking one of those biscuits with thyme or rosemary in it.  We did enjoy having this, and it served us well tonight for dinner.  Thanks, jeffy!

I poured the mixture over a croissant because I didnâ€™t have biscuits. Good!

Because some said it was bland, I used a little more salt and black pepper and added a sprinkle of chili powder and some minced onion. Great!

Love this recipe. I've made it twice so far. The first time was perfect,  I season to taste. The second time I added diced jalepenos and onions, and instead of ham/bacon, used smoked chopped sausage!
Delish!

I was looking for a way to use up a little bit of ham and a whole bunch of hard boiled eggs from Easter. This worked perfectly for that! The sauce was a little bland so I added some Tajin seasoning and a few teaspoons of lemon juice.  I gave it four stars because everyone thought it was good, and it was a fine dinner of leftovers. I will probably make it again. But it is definitely not impressive or something I would go out of my way to boil eggs for.
