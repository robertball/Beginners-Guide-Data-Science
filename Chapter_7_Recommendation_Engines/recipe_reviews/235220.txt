I used dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips to create the illusion of being healthy. I also baked this in a loaf pan instead of a muffin tin because I'm lazy like that. Reportedly this makes 18 servings, but my family decided it was more like 5.

Quite moist and delicious.  I halved the recipe and got 8 BIG muffins, could have probably squeezed a dozen out of the batter if I made them smaller.  Used mini chocolate chips.  Nice flavor!

Great recipe.  Added walnuts, just because my family likes them and only made some minor changes (only because I wanted to use what I had on hand) - topped up the pumpkin with some unsweetened applesauce, as I didn't have enough pumpkin, used whipping cream - because I wanted to use it up.  These get most of their sweetness from the chocolate chips.  My two year old gobbled these up. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe as is and the family loved them!  My daughters soccer teamed devoured a double batch.  I have used the brown sugar and substituted white sugar.  I like the brown sugar best.

Love how these turned out! My only suggestion is I made less than what it called for mainly cause I like to make them a bit bigger. They could use a little extra sugar and if you're going to make them bigger I made 12 muffins, set my oven to 375 at 16 minutes and that did the trick.

The only changed I made were substituting unsweetened applesauce for the oil and skim milk for the soy milk. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and they are delicious!

I ran out of whole wheat flour, so I only used a little of that, and made up the difference with almond meal and a little 5-grain cereal (which gave it a nice nutty texture). I also didn't have brown sugar, but I improvised with white sugar and extra molasses, which worked fine. As others have mentioned, the muffins are beautifully moist and delicious. I've saved the recipe and I'm sure I'll make it again!

Some friends & I had a Halloween brunch where we had brunch & did activities. They stayed the night & I needed a bunch of recipes- pumpkin-y ones! These were a big hit at my brunch. I'm looking forward to making these next Autumn. They were perfect & I didn't have to make any changes to them. They were surprisingly moist. My muffins are usually dry.

So tasty! I had to sub out an extra 1/4 of veg oil as I realized too late that I was out of eggs, and they still turned out amazing. I also opted to omit the whole wheat flour and stick with all-purpose, and swapped out chocolate chips for raisins. My kids love these. I see a lot of future batches coming out of our kitchen.

Wow! My kitchen smells awesome!  Moist, flavorful muffins!  The only thing I changed was I used 1% milk instead of soy milk, and I may have added a few more chocolate chips than called for!  Really good recipe, thanks for sharing!

These are so good! I made mini muffins. This recipe made 66 minis. All six of my kids love them, which is amazing. They smell amazing too. The only thing I changed was replacing the vegetable oil with applesauce (didn’t have the oil), and they still turned out fantastic. This is a keeper for sure.

Followed the recipe, using my own puréed pumpkin. Made 24 smallish muffins for kid lunches. My kids loved them! I might omit the spices and try root beer flavour next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Although I'm not a pumpkin or nutmeg fan (don't ask why I decided to make this recipe, since it calls for both), I really like these muffins! Can't say love, because of the nutmeg. I'm just going to skip it next time. I used my own pureed pumpkin, though. I will make some more tomorrow - gluten free for my daughter.

Easy to make, satisfying. I will say it wasn't as sweet as I happen to prefer...if it weren't for the chocolate chips this would not be worth the calories for me. I'm glad I tried it though

Just tried the recipe today and thought they tasted very good!!  My husband agrees. I used coconut milk instead of soy milk and used fresh pumpkin I cooked/pureed instead of canned.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Took about 15 minutes to bake.  I won't make any changes to the recipe and will be making it again.  It seems like a pretty healthy muffin with only 1/3 cup oil and whole wheat flour.
