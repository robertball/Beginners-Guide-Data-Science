I've been looking for a peanut butter cheesecake recipe for a long time; once I found this recipe, I had to try it. I gotta say I was quite skeptical when I poured the cake mixture onto the crust. I increased oven temperature to 260Â°F and bake it for 1 hour after decreasing the temperature. When cooled, the cake looked perfect. I spread jelly on the top, and I became skeptical again: wouldn't it be to much? Wouldn't it "cover" the cheesecake taste? NO: this cake turned out perfect, not too nutty, not too sweet and very fresh. I'll surely make it again, keeping in mind that temperature has to be slightly increased, as well as cooking time.

This was ok.  I was worried about the crunchy peanut butter and I did not like it at all when it was finished.  I would recommend regular peanut butter.  Also don't put your jelly on the entire thing.  I did and turned out not to like the jelly I picked.  Try different toppings.

good, I omitted the jelly, increased the PB to 1/2 cup, added chopped up peanut butter cups and a layer of fudge to the bottom and the top.

So good. I used a large chocolate cookie crust instead of the graham cracker crust and it was VERY good but VERY rich. I also used seedless raspberry jam to compliment the chocolate crust and it really was quite good. The texture on this one is excellent too.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving desert and it was a huge hit.  I eliminated the jelly and drizzled hot fudge ice cream topping over it.  Excellent!

This was a really yummy cheesecake. I made it for my daughter's birthday since she loves cheesecake and peanut butter. I would suggest cooking it for 5-10 minutes longer, though. I left off the jelly, also, but I bought chocolate whipped cream to put on top. It is really fabulous plain, though!!!

This is so good!  I omitted the jelly because I was only interested in the PB.  I added PB chips but I wouldn't recommend it, it's better without.

Thank you for the recipe. I made this recipe for Open Class for the county fair and I got a third place. I was quick and easy to do. I did put crushed up peanuts in the filling with the peanut butter. Also had to bake it longer than 1hr. I am going to make it for an Officers Call.  Thank  you again.....

This was great. It was so easy to make (especially for a cheesecake)and my whole family loved it. Did have to bake it about 20 minutes longer, but then it was fine.

I only give this four stars because with jelly was weird. Pairs better with maple syrup as a topping! With maple syrup topping this cheesecake gets a five star rating from our house!

I just used the jam idea on my own cheesecake.  Warmed 1/2 cup of plum jam, stirred in 1/8 teaspoon pure orange extract, poured on and spread on refrigerated cheesecake, and refrigerated for another hour. OMG!  Delicious.

Very strong taste for only 1/3 c. peanut butter!  A dense cheesecake that I needed to bake for about 15 minutes longer than stated in the instructions.  Would make again, but not for a special occasion of any sort.

This recipe just didn't turn out right.  I was skeptical about it, and my hunch proved correct.  I had to bake it a lot longer than the recipe required, even though I used an oven thermometer to make sure the temperature was correct.  It came out gooey in the middle and I had to cook it for maybe 30-40 minutes longer than stated.  Once I did that, it was okay.

I love this recipe, although the cooking time didn't work out for us so it was a little more pudding than cheesecake. Still great flavors and texture!

I make this all the time for potlucks and such, and it's always a big hit.  I usually skip the jelly and dress it up with chocolate.  Last time I used chopped up peanut butter cups and mini chocolate chips and chocolate syrup.  It looked fantastic.  I also like to substitute a chocolate crust.  Be forewarned, the cheesecake takes 30-40 minutes longer to bake than called for, but doesn't crack at all.

Very good, though I did increase the peanut butter and the cooking time. I used pureed Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site for the 'jelly' and sprinkled with chopped peanuts and peanut butter chips. Thanks for the recipe!

2 tbls butter for the crust is not enough. I used 4. I also decreased the sugar by a tbls and added a dash of cocoa powder and cinnamon. While it baked I mixed up the cake. Make sure your ingredients are at room temp. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup because I didn't want it super rich and added a dash of vanilla. Baked it at 325 as written then decreased temp to 260 for 45 minutes more. Oh, and I also placed a pan of boiling water on the rack under the cake to keep it creamy, also so it wouldn't crack. Works perfectly every time and easier than a water bath! If the cake is set but still a bit jiggly in the middle it's done. Took it out, let it cool, then topped it with jelly and that took it to the FANTASTIC level. Recommend heating the jam in the micro for a second so it will spread. Do not skip the jam, it's what makes this recipe. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Ingredients were added exactly as recipe instructed. I followed the advice of another reviewer and decreased temp to 260 and left it at that temp for 50 minutes, cooled for one hour and then refrigerated over night. The cheesecake was runny. I had to put it back in the oven in the morning for another hour. Additionally, I would advise using creamy PB instead of crunchy for a better texture. The randomness of a crunch made the peanuts seem out of place.
I have made many different cheesecake recipes and this was the worst so far. Nice idea, just didn't work.

Oh my goodness!  This is so yummy, rich, and...just perfect!  I did leave it in the oven for about 10 minutes longer with the oven turned off.  My oven is old and I usually have to adjust bake times.  Anyhow, this was the first time I attempted to make a cheesecake, and I must say, it came out perfect.  I will definately make this one again.

This was a great cheesecake recipe. I used smooth peanut butter and didn't top the whole cake. I put chocolate topping on mine and used raspberry jam on other slices. The chocolate was great! I also had to bake the cake a little longer than written. Thanks for sharing!

I made some modifications, and it seems to have turned out well.  I will know more when I actually eat it, but it looks great.  

I did 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of 1/3, I also omitted the flour, as I have to eat gluten free, and I have NEVER put flour in a cheesecake that I have made.  I also baked it at 350* for 50-60 min in a water bath.  I've always made cheesecake that way, so I decided to do it that way again.  I'm really pleased with how it set up as it baked.  It looks just like the many other cheesecakes I have made.

I have used this recipe on many occasions! It's wonderful! I omit the jelly and add my favorite yumminess to it. One thing Ive  noticed, though...I have to bake it 30 minutes longer than the recommended time. Needless to say, it comes out perfect everytime! Thank you!

This was my first time ever making cheesecake and I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't end up with a cracked surface or an undercooked cheesecake.  I did increase baking time to about an hour.  Also, I was put off by how hard it was to spread the jelly evenly onto the cake so I put it into a bowl, microwaved the jam (I used Smuckers Strawberry) for about 15 seconds to loosen the consistency, stirred vigorously, and more or less drizzled it onto the cheesecake.  Very good!

I read the reviews before making this so I decided to increase the baking time to 1 hour. I left it in the oven to cool and it was still not cooked when I took it out several hours later. Other than the cooking time issues I liked this recipe. I think it is a great idea and it is not something that is commonly made. I think next time I make this I will have to cook it longer and not be so scared to over cook it.

So so...I was hoping for more of a peanut butter flavor, but all you can taste is the jam.

Excellent. I used creamy peanut butter, but otherwise followed the recipe. Also left it in the oven for an extra 15 minutes.

Delicious. I took the advice of the other reviewers and topped half of the cake with chocolate. Both the jam and the chocolate tasted fantastic. I would definately make it again.

This recipe had me second guessing the attempt. Have always used condensed milk for cheesecake and never used sugar in my crust. However, l took the gamble and it paid off! Peanut butter flavor was not overbearing and cake was rich & smooth. I did need 3 additional tablespoons of butter to get the graham cracker crumbs to form properly. The other minor change was using cherry preserves instead of jam for the topping.

This is a very good recipe.  First time to make and it was a great hit.  I made two (one for my husband to take to work and one for myself).  No left overs!!  I made as per recipe and only change was the cooking time...which I increased.

I made this and it was very good, I do have some suggestions though.
1. I put some jelly on top of the cheesecake and made swirls before putting it in the oven, DON'T do that, it gets a bit soggy in the parts where the jelly didn't blend well and where it did blend the flavor is lost. I did however put jelly on top of the crust before pouring in the cheese mixture and that turned out great. 
2. If you use organic unsweetened pb make sure you up the sugar, I used 1 and a quarter cups sugar instead of 1.
3. You can omit the jelly and pour chocolate ganache and end up with a delicious pb chocolate cup cheesecake

I have made this many times and it always turns out great.  I usually bake it a bit longer though.  Sometimes I add a handful or two of mini chocolate chips to the batter.

Wow Is the timing off! I had to cook for an extra 45 mins. After being in the oven for an hour and 10 mins, I turned the temp up to 325 bc I was afraid it would dry out and the crust be like a brick. Next time I make this, I'm going to bake at 325 for an hour. That's usually how I bake them, but decided to give this recipe a try. I used 6 chocolate oreos and 6 vanilla oreos crushed for the crust, and melted a cup of chocolate chips with 3 tablespoons of half and Half and poured half of the cheesecake mix in the pan and put 3 tbs of chocolate then put the other half of batter on top and scooped 3 more tbs of chocolate and took a knife and marbleized it. I also turned the oven off and let the cake cool inside for an hour to prevent sinking. I didn't use the jam, did the chocolate instead. After huge frustrations and pulling my hair out over the baking process it turned out good. If you do bake it at 250, it's going to take at least 45 mins longer than called for. But I recommend just doing 325 for an hour.
