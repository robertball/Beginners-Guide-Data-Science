Wow!  This is one BIG sandwich. It's actually more of a hoagie or sub depending on where you're from.  I have to laugh because I added some lettuce to make it "healthy" - as if it could possibly be any good for you. But, I guess you have to splurge once in a while.  I made two and because there was no way we could finish these I sent the rest to work with my husband and he told me the guys renamed this "The Widow Maker".

Delicious.  Made it for hubby and myself for tonight and it was great.  I played around with the ingredients a bit and it turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

I make this all the time.  Try using a big, round loaf of King's Hawaiian Bread, slicing and assembling the same way.  I add some bacon to the tomato layer and omit the onion and use real cheddar instead of American.  Top with sesame seeds, butter, and garlic salt.

What a fun and wonderful sandwich! I didn't get 5 layers either. I couldn't find a good bread knife either, part of the problem. I wanted to go to Subway and borrow theirs. I added shredded lettuce from the bag and banana pepper rings.  I am going to make this again for the ballgames this weekend. Thank you.

Excellent!  Made this for a football party, and everybody loved it.  I couldn't get five layers out of it either, so I just did four, and it was delicious.

This makes a great sandwich.  I used a round loaf of Italian Boule, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  It was very tasty and my picky husband raved about it.  Next time I will try the French bread as we had a ton of sandwich left over (not that that's a bad thing!).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous!!!! Made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it including my very picky teen-aged daughter. She even requested this for her lunchbox today. Followed the recipe to the letter and only difference was I ended up with four slices instead of five. Not a big deal. I just put the last two layers together. Loved how this became more of a pressed sandwich later in the evening. Very, very good. Cannot wait to make for game nights or the Superbowl!

Fun to make for the Superbowl tonight.  Tasty but needing a little something.  Maybe some regular mustard, dill pickles or even peppercini's to add some flavor.  Liked it though and will make again:)

Delicious and fun to put together with friends.  The Costco rosemary french bread worked wonderfully with it (only got 4 layers).  Wasn't sure about the horseradish and mustard, but melted together beautifully.  Would make it again!

I've made this sandwich before and loved it. I lost the recipe and was happy to find so quickly. I make it in the morning and serve it for a picnic lunch. I've never had a problem with soggy leftovers. But I always use a chewy bread. I find it is less likely to get soggy when it is made ahead of time.

Too much of a mouthful. This is a sandwich you need to eat with a fork and knife.

This was very very good, one well make again and again.  The only down side was the leftovers weren't to good. Edited to add that we have made this sandwich again and held off on adding the condiments until peices of sandwich were served.  That way if there is any sandwich leftover it saves much better since the condiments made the sandwich soggy.

We loved this sandwich!  It was a great, fun meal for our traditional Saturday "Movie Night" get-together!  I used French bread that had a firm crust, but was very soft inside.  For that reason, I had a difficult time slicing it without smashing it.  My husband took over and did a much better job.  Next time I think I will try Italian bread, but I will definitely make this again.  Thumbs up!
