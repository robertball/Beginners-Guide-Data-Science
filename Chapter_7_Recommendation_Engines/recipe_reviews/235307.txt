I loved having a way to get use from a turkey carcass leftover from Thanksgiving. The soup is basic as others mentioned, but I found adding a bit of ground ginger or cayenne to individual bowls added nice spice. The recipe froze and reheated well, so i was able to enjoy the soup during the cold winter months.

I give it 3 stars as it's written. A good starter recipe. I added way more seasonings than what's called for because it was too bland. I added a lot more of the black pepper, more salt, more garlic and onion powder, a chicken bouillon cube and a couple dashes Worcestershire sauce. Made it twice once with rice and another time with elbow macaroni.

After reading the other reviews and knowing that turkey rice soup can be a bit bland if you arenâ€™t careful, I took most of the advice submitted by others and will summarize what I did differently to reach the rating I gave the soup.  I refrigerated the stock when it was done then skimmed off the fat the next day.  After letting the stock reach room temperature, I added chicken bullion (1 cube or 1 tsp), I doubled all the seasoning (including the garlic) listed in the recipe plus added 1 tsp of parsley to ensure a flavor boost.  Before I put in the meat and rice, I added 4 tsp of salt (this took the soup to a good base that people could add a bit more if they wanted) and 2 tsp of pepper.  I agree with one of the other reviews that more meat is needed so I added 2 more cups of turkey; adding one more cup of rice gave it the consistency I was looking for.  Hope this helps anyone out there who wants to try this easy recipe and is looking for more flavor.  Enjoy!

This is a good classic Turkey carcass soup recipe.  The only change I made was to add chicken broth instead of water.  Gives it an extra punch of flavour.  I also added more Turkey meat- about 2 cups more.

I made this to recipe I only added 1 tsp of poultry spice to stock and I did refrigerate the stock overnight to skim the fat off, which I think you should always do!.  It made 8 us quarts of stock and I seasoned with 6 to 6.5tsp. of salt and the rest of spices from recipe.  I found it had a lot of flavour and the whole family loved it.  I would definitely recommend to try it out.

I made this exactly as written, and we loved it. I've made turkey rice soup before but it was always very bland. This tasted like Thanksgiving in a bowl! Thank you for a keeper recipe; I'll be making this every year, with the remains of our turkey.

I added a lot more spices, used fresh garlic, celery, carrots and onions in the soup (no frozen veggies) plus twice as much rice.  Husband loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

I used powdered Rosemary, because that is what I had. I also added some thyme and parsley to the final cooking. I wasn't sure how much salt to add, so, next time I will put in a couple teaspoons. This is a great basic recipe, and would be good with brown rice, wild rice, or some kind of noodle as well as the plain white rice.

I had already made broth from the two turkey frames I had so I skipped that step. I added a lot more spices and herbs, cooked wild rice and stirred in creamed spinach (leftover about 2 cups) just to heat through, gave a creamy finish and some additional veg. Yummy!

Changes made were using lots of leftovers from the holidays.  I had made broth in November, saved turkey  and used the roasted veggies left over from a family gathering on New Year's Day.

This was a terrific recipe. I didn't have turkey bones/carcass so, for more flavor, I used Better Than Boullion, Chicken flavor. MAde homemade biscuits and it was a wonderful meal.

Instead of rice, I used Orzo, which was my grandmother's recipe. She came to the USA from Greece when she was only 16 years old.  Her special soup would make me well fast whenever I had a cold or flu.

This was a really substantial soup. I left out the celery and swapped out the poultry seasoning for some sage. Plus, I added cooked rice at the end ...for each bowl.  I will definately make this version again.

I love the idea of using the carcass as the base, but I felt the taste was missing some depth or something.  Fairly bland, but I couldn't put my finger on what was missing.  Will probably make this again using this as a frame work and tinker with it as I go.

Seemed like a lot of work and the end result was mediocre with not much flavor. Really wanted to like it, but it was just kind of blah.

Just made this soup today and it was fantastic........if I do say so myself! The only thing I changed was I used egg noodles instead of rice.
