Not quite what I'd call French, but it works as a dressing. As for Rebecca's comment about it tasting like oil... you need to let it sit for a while. I make dressings like this a day ahead so the flavors have time to marry. If you just mix it and use it... the herbs have not penetrated the oils.

I think there's something missing.  I made this, assuming that the recipe would call for adding the wet ingredients later.  It was really oily and heavy.  Bleh.

As far as I can tell, many people (Americans?) tend to think of French Dressing as a sweet, tomato-e dressing.  Bottles labeled French Dressing bought in the store are usually that type.  The real original French is a vinaigrette so this recipe is correctly labeled.  I liked this very much, although I used much less sugar as I do not like sweet dressings.  I used red wine vinegar and less oil than the suggested.  Be sure to let the dressing sit, overnight is best.  Shared with my dad and his wife and we all really enjoyed it.  Yay, another dressing for my arsenal.

Love this recipe!  SO easy and tasty!  It's even better if it has a day or 2 to sit after mixing with the wet ingredients before you eat it.  Lots of flavor!
