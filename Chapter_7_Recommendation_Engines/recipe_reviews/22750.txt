This turned out well, but it originally calls for WAY too much sugar. I only put 3 cups instead of 4, and it was still a bit too sweet. Everyone ate it and said they enjoyed it, but there was a discussion about the sweetness and the amount of sugar called for. I had to use ground cardamom (couldn't find whole). I also made it in the rice maker, to save time and space. I added the food color and 1 teaspoon cardamom to the rice maker with the rice and water (no soaking). When that was finished I heated 1 1/2 teaspoons cardamom in oil and added cooked rice, sugar, and 2 cups of skim milk. I let this simmer about 5 minutes, and added the nuts, fruits, and ricotta. It was delicious in the end.

This is in response to the previous reviewer's question: Usually with Indian/Pakistani etc. sweet rice, use fresh water (so you don't keep too much starch). And if you use basmati rice, the rice/water ratio is 1:2--so for this recipe, you would boil 8 cups of water.

I'm sure this recipe would have come out better if the directions were more clear.  Maybe someone could post the proper amount of WATER to use throughout the recipe?  Also, are we supposed to use the water that the rice has soaked in, fresh water or additional water?  This recipe is not clear but it came out good the way I made it - I just used made rice the normal way without soaking it and added the cardamom and food coloring to the water.  I also added a lot more raisins.
