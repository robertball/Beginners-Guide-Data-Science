Growing up I always had to peel the green bananas with a stick or the back of a butter knife, this was very easy - BUT it's WAYYYY too much coconut milk for 6 bananas, for 6 bananas I'd only use a can of coconut milk (or cream) and maybe 1/4 onion, but I've never made small quantities of this stuff (always for family occasions and my dad usually makes it), but this was easy.  Make sure your bananas are GREEN, if they're even the slightest yellow they're ripening and it won't be the same - you do need to add salt.

This was awesome though I added my own touches as I did not think the onions would be cooked enough for me so after boiling and peeling bananas I lightly sauteed the onion in coconut oil (so as not to deviate from the original taste) and also lightly sauteed the cooke bananas. When the onions and edges of bananas were lightly brown and the pan was extremely hot I poured in a lite coating of coconut milk then did it again until all the bananas were covered with a lite creamy coating of the milk then I seasoned with salt and Adobo. Let me tell you we went WILD over them. They were AWESOME. This is my new picnic food instead of potato salad! Much more nutritious!

We did not care for this. Perhaps the bananas weren't green enough but the flavors didn't mix well.

Oh thank you soooo much for posting this. When I was younger and we had a big family get together there were always made. They're harder to come by now but luckily you posted this. I love eating this with corned beef and ketchup.

I had this for the first time at the Polynesian cultural Center here in Oahu. I could not believe how delicious it is. The others are correct you have to use green apple bananas are very small green bananas. I also only use one can of coconut milk when I prepare mine And add a pinch of salt. It's a savory side of bananas your taste buds will thank you for!
