the youngest redneck wanted to learn how to make my creamy pasta. I was going to walk him through it but decided he should try on his own. So I opened by RB for him to decide. A young teen will not take long to make a decision-last pasta recipe saved first one he tried-This was so good, Maui, the perfect carb supper for our busy day. It was very easy and came together quickly even for the young one. Used garlic chives and a cut up tomato. Do not skimp on the cream, I rarely measure cream when I make pasta,  this is a great amount for a creamy pasta. We used 1/2 whippping cream and 1/2 coffee cream, delicious. The young redneck even took a pic, our camera is bad, but he likes your pasta:) Thanks Maui.

This dish was delicious. My husband and I are not lovers of pancetta but once it was fried up and drained I think it added a nice subtle salty bacon flavour to the dish. The "crisp white wine" was a wonderful suggestion too.

I made this tonight and my whole family LOVED it!  I didn't have fettuccine, so I used a chicken tortellini pasta.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.  My husband got thirds, and my "difficult to please" children sang my praises:)  This is a keeper!

Recipe Group Selection:  22, June 2013 ~ Maui Girl – this fettuccine recipe is out of this world!  My family went nuts about this dish!  I could not find pancetta bacon, so I subbed Canadian bacon.  I had 2 c. of heavy cream on hand and 2 c. of half and half – so I used those.  I know my sauce was a littler thinner than what it should have been, but the taste was still incredible.  Loved the tomatoes and fresh basil (from my herb garden) taste in this dish.  It really did make it taste like a summer meal.  I served this with a simple green salad and multigrain French bread.  We had a wonderful meal and I have a “new favorite” summer meal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, glad AR decided to publish this one.

This was a great meal.  I changed a few of the ingredients, instead of pancetta I accidentally used very thinly sliced cooked ham and 1/2 half and half with 1/2 whipping cream.  I also added a clove of garlic and blanched asparagus.  It turned out really well and I'll be making it again- using either pancetta or ham.  The ham went well with the dish.  Thanks for recipe.  It was easy to make and very tasty.

Made this for Recipe Group...FANTASTIC!!!!! I did have to use bacon b/c they did not have any pancetta at the store, but we loved it w/ the bacon. I only used a pint of heavy cream, and I think it made the perfect amount of sauce. The little guy chose the pasta shape so it wasn't fettuccine, lol, but it sure was delicious! The whole family raved over this...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sahring. :)
