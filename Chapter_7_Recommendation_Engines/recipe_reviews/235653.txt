I have been making something similar for my family, but I use boneless breast pieces, not cut into nuggets.  I add season all, old bay, any seasons that you like to the rice krispies.  Then I place the chicken in a pizza pan or cookie sheet, and then if there are any rice crispies left over I put them on top and  put some melted butter/margarine on top then bake at 350.  It is my family's favorite recipe.  The rice krispies are awesome when they are cooked. I am not saying that you have to   change the recipe, just suggesting for people who might not want to fry.

I made these tonight for the family.  I used Rice Krispies and crushed them in a ziploc bag then added some seasoned salt. I cut chicken breast into thick strips and soaked in an egg wash then put the pieces in the bag to coat.  Fried until golden brown. Everyone loved these. Even my pickiest son! So crunchy and tasty. Definitely a keeper!! Thanks.

Kids will love this!  Adults will want to add more seasoning (I like Papa's Seasoning Salt from this site).  I made this as directed.  It took me 30 minutes from start to finish, but that was with interruptions and fixing other things, too.  So this is an easy dish to make on a busy night.  My husband really liked it!  Thanks, Bryon Dean Thomas!  EDIT:  If you use a combo of butter and coconut oil to fry these little gems in, your house will smell wonderful, and little kids will lick their plates clean!

Finally got around to making these and they were terrific! Marianne's picture made my mouth water last week and I knew I had to make them. With her suggestion of adding more spices, garlic powder, cayenne salt and pepper it really came out scrumptious. Nice and crunchy too. I didn't serve with orange marmalade but wished I did. My husband said don't lose this recipe and wants to try it with the marmalade next time. Leftovers tonight with fettuccini alfredo. Yum!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I used two large chicken breasts and coated as instructed.  I hate frying things, so I baked in the oven at 350 for about 16 minutes and they came out juicy and perfect.  I didn't make the sauce (it was great with either ketchup or sweet and sour), but will give it a try next time.

This was excellent!  I didn't have to beg my kids to take more bites, they voluntarily cleaned their plates. Score!  I added extra seasoning to the krispies, and used peach preserves since that's what I had (and I HIGHLY recommend the preserves for dipping - SO GOOD!). Be sure to pat your chicken good and dry before dipping in the egg wash or your krispies will slide off while frying. Great recipe!

I've tried many chicken nugget recipes but I don't need to look any further! My kids loved these. You can customize it so easily by adding as much spice or herbs to suit your family's taste.

My little picky eater put two thumbs up to these. We added some seasoning to them once they came out but she just had the plain ones and LOVED them. We used the air fryer and turned them half way during cooking and came out very crispy. Two thumbs UP!

I made this last night.  I'm a lazy cook,  so I used chicken tenders and cut them in cubes. The family really enjoyed it.  I read all ther reviews first.  I made some with just the salt and  pepper seasoning. Then I made some with the kids favorite seasoning, Paprika. They liked both.  my question though is,  how do you keep the coating on the chicken? I kept having to sprinkle more coating on while cooking.  Is there a secret? help me, please. And thank you.  
PS- definitely making again!

I've been making this for years, only a little different. Before the egg dip, I dredge the chicken in flour and spices...salt, pepper, onion, garlic, whatever! Then, dip in egg, and rice crispies...DELISH!

8.9.18  I do agree with other reviewers, you do need to “season” the breadcrumbs with something (I didn’t, wish I had).  In spite of that, these chicken nuggets still were very good.  I think in the future, I’ll use orange marmalade with a splash of Triple Sec instead of the apricot preserves and water…just more flavorful.  I also took a suggestion from another reviewer to use coconut oil instead of olive oil, and certainly would do that  again, as well.  These were simple to make, good, and I certainly would make again.

This was my first time pan-frying anything and it turned out delicious.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of rice cereal because it's what I had in the pantry.  Served it with a "pb&j" sauce of orange marmalade and melted peanut butter (inspired by a similar dish at Traylor Park restaurant in Savannah GA).

Very tasty chicken recipe, I put my chicken in the oven for about 15 min after a quick fry in the skillet. That was my only change. Will make again!

This was really not too good. Hate to write bad reviews, but using cereal did not stick at all to the chicken. Flavor also only marginally ok using rest of recipe. Would not recommend!

Very bland. The only real flavor was the apricot dipping sauce and that was because of the 1 tsp of Dijon mustard I added.  I should have listened to my gut instinct. I'll still make chicken nuggets/tenders but just not this recipe.

I will make these again. Next time maybe add savory spices. Kids will love these. So easy to make too.
