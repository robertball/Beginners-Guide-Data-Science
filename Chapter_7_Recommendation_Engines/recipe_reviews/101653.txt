this is great!   I did not cut my salmon,  used a 3 lb piece of filet, not skinned,  and just poured the ingredients over it.   Was Wonderful.  The key is to NOT overcook the fish.  THe second time I made it,  instead of using the basil,  I sprinkled some Blackened Redfish spice mix, about a teaspoon,  over the fish after I put the oil and lemon and garlic mixture on.  It was heavenly.  The fish cooks to a moist, soft consistency and tastes delicious!

This is great!  Easy to throw together and very tasty.  I didn't put the whole amount of salt in and used a good-quality Spanish olive oil and wild salmon.  Served with brown/wild rice and Honey Glazed Pea Pods and Carrots (from this site).  It was an easy, but gourmet, meal!

This was wonderful!
I loved the garlic and basil flavor, which mixed well with the salmon without over powering it. However, i didnt realise that we didnt have lemons so i had to use lime juice insted, but it still turned out great! I will be sure to make this agian!

So easy to make, especially when you don't have a lot of time at night to make gourmet meals.  I used just a little less oil because salmon is an oily fish anyway.  It was fantastic!

I'm not a fish person but this was so delicious.  I told my hubby that it should be served in a restaurant.  Its so simple and flavorful.  Made 4 times already and will definately make again.  definately great to serve to guests.

Great taste and it was very easy to make.  I added cherry tomatoes (cut in half) and green,yellow peppers (sliced).  I only used 1/2 the amount of olive oil.  Very good. Thanks

Another great salmon recipe from All Recipes.  I cannot believe how many good recipes are out there.  Delicous.  The next time I make, the only thing I would change is to cut down on the olive oil a little.  Thanks

It turned out drier and less flavorful than expected.  I just always go with Norma's Baked Salmon II.  It takes a bit more time, but it's easy and well worth it.

Simple and great tasting salmon recipe.  I did add 1 tablespoon of dijon mustard to this recipe.  Definitely added flavor and made a nice topping when I poured the remaining mixture over the salmon.

This recipe is possibly the best one I've ever stumbled upon. It's the first dinner meal I ever made, and it worked well for Valentines day with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil also found on this website. I've made it at least 20 times since.
Also, I've screwed it up so many times, forgetting the lemon juice or the dried basic or the ground black pepper, and somehow it still managed to taste great. Not to mention it's as simple as dipping and sticking in the oven. 
Although salmon is a little expensive for a college student, this recipe is quick to put together and great for a week night if you don't mind splurging a little bit. If I could give it more than five stars If I could.

WOW! Great tasting, easy, fast, and is good for you. This is something you would want to make for the first time your cooking for "Him" or "Her" I followed the directions for 2 and it came out perfect.

This recipe was awesome, made just as it said in the recipe except I added a minced jalapeno to give it a spicy flavor. Me and my husband loved it and will be making this again and again.

This is excellent.  You can either cook it exactly to specifications and have and OUTSTANDING salmon dish, or do what I did and put slices of lemon in the tin foil wrapper while cooking and serve over a rice pilaf.  It was a huge success.

This was quick, easy, and fabulous!!!  My husband and I put the kids down early and had an adult dinner.  This was perfect b/c of it's simplicity! (I also folded my aluminum foil in half before wrapping and drizzled what was left of the oil mixture on top before baking.

This salmon was good but I didn't love it. the boyfriend liked it more but I found it to just taste like salmon doused in garlic, which didn't really enhance the flavor of the salmon. However it was a very simple, quick and easy dish good for a weeknight meal. However I most likely will not make it again.
