I made this recipe with coconut oil instead of sesame oil . I don’t like the flavour of sesame . I keep them in the freezer  in a ziplock instead of the fridge . Good healthy snack .

This was a great option to make for our vegan neighbors rather than the holiday cookies I make for everyone else. I wasn't sure about the sesame oil, but they're really good.

At first I thought there was too much salt but after eating on these little beauties for a couple days they are growing on me and the salt flavor is diminishing.  Used half the amount of sesame oil as well which I recommend if you are sensitive to it.  Yummy little snack!

Loved these. Easy to make, can be made ahead of time.  We made so many we took them to a pot luck the next evening and we think they were actually better the next day.

Made these using a half teaspoon  of sesame oil.  Wish I wouldn’t have done that.  Next time I will make them using  light olive oil because all I taste is  sesame it drowns out the dates and coconut. Otherwise this is a good recipe.

I've made it twice, they were so good.  I lowered the salt and decided I liked it better with the listed amount.  I'm a Weight Watcher and they are 6 points, sadly.  But, I'm pre-diabetic and the sweet from the dates along with the nuts isn't as bad as a lot of desserts.

These are yummy but we didn't care for the sesame oil as it is a really strong taste.  Next time I think I'll leave this out or susti
