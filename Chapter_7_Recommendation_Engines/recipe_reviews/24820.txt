First of all, like others have mentioned, I had trouble with the glaze. I tried twice. The first time, all the water evaporated, leaving a crispy, sugar powder. The second time, I didn't let it get to this point, but the resulting glaze was too watery. This stuff is my fault. I'm sure that making a caramelized-glaze is one of those things that I should have learned in home ec. But there are major problems with the ratios of ingredients. The orange actually overpowers the wasabi! I increased the wasabi by 5 times, and the orange was still overpowering. I would probably only use 2T to 1/4 c of orange juice. Also, the sauce is much too sweet. At least in these proportions, the sugary-orange wine glaze does not compliment the wasabi taste. The orange/wine glaze is really delicious, though. I gave the recipe two stars because this combination is so unique that I'm sure that just a few changes could make this a really wonderful dish -- just not in its current form.

My hubby and I thought this was very refreshing.  The fresh lime juice was an excellent addition.  We brushed the chicken with the glaze while it cooked on the grill and added the extra glaze (once it cooled) to the salad. Thanks.

You can save yourself a lot of trouble by using 1/3 cup orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice, and reducing the amount of wine.  Add only what water you need to get the desired consistency.  Warm gently in a saucepan to meld flavors.  Do not worry about a raw alcohol taste, as it will continue to cook off as the chicken cooks.

The instructions on this recipe are not complete.  And I tried 3 times to get the sugar and water to a "dark amber color," but it seized on me every time.  Very difficult recipe, and I am an avid cook and enjoy trying new recipes.

The dressing came out really flavorful but the glaze on the chicken was a little too sweet. Maybe add more wasabi. Also, I used a chicken substitute (Veat) since I'm a vegetarian and it worked out just fine! Served with some bread it was a satisfying meal.

The glaze was a little tricky at first. The water evaporated and the sugar clumped up and did not turn into an amber color. I tried it again by reducing the amount of sugar by half (I thought it was too sweet) and increased the amount of water. I cooked it over low to medium heat until it was reduced to a syrup like consistency. 

Overall the salad was great. I also added black beans and white corn.

The glaze was too watery.  Will add some honey and less liquid to give it more texture, taste & gloss to the chicken.  Otherwise the chicken is pretty disappointing but the salad itself is quite lovely.

Too many competing flavors to enjoy this recipe.  Can't say that we'll be making this one again.

i tried the glaze a couple times and also ended up with crunchy sugar every time.  i found that using high heat, not med high like the recipe suggests, works much better.  i added a tad more water once it seized and kept cooking.  then it re-dissolved and caramelized very quickly.  next time i will use less orange juice and more wine and brush the glaze on the chicken near the end of baking since all that time in the oven turned it to a watery mess.  but i loved the flavors and will definitely make this again.

I, like others, had problems with the glaze.  I like others' idea of using orange juice concentrate.  I was in a huge hurry after wasting my original glaze attempt and ended up throwing together OJ, red wine, wasabi, and a little corn syrup and molasses.  I'm sure it's not exactly the intended result but in a hurry it worked.  I also subbed sliced portabella mushrooms for the chicken.  The flavors were great!
