Made these a couple of times.  My granddaughter loves soft cookies, so she really enjoys these.  The only thing I didn't like were the butterscotch chips.  The chips  taste very "phony", not like true butterscotch,  so I now use either "Reeces Peanut Butter Chips" or Chocolate Chips.  They are awesome tasting cookies and not overly sweet like other cookies.

I enjoy tweaking recipes to my personal liking, but there was very little to change with these cookies. The sugar was spot on, (not teeth numbing sweet) and the 1 cup of chips were perfect not the traditional two.
The only thing I changed was using 3/4 cup of oil instead of one cup. I also used 3 eggs instead of two. This still was very soupy so used the rest of my oatmeal (around 3 cups.)
What a cookie! Delicious!

Everyone in my family loved these but I did make some changes based on my taste and available items.  I cut down the brown sugar to 1/2 c.  Next time I'll probably take the 1/4c out of the white sugar.  Added raisins and walnuts to make them even more filling.  Also I did half crisco and half butter as I didn't have butter flavored crisco.  They were yummy and soft.

This is a nice oatmeal cookie, I couldn't really taste the pumpkin though.  I was a little short on butterscotch chips so I added some chocolate chips.  Baked for 10 minutes and they were perfect.  I did not use Crisco.  I used half butter and half Organic vegetable shortening which worked well. The addition of the nutmeg, as suggested in the cooks notes, would have been great.

I was overall pretty happy with the way these cookies turned out. After reading previous reviews stating that there wasn't much pumpkin flavor  I increased the pumpkin pur√©e to one cup. I still didn't feel like they had a strong pumpkin taste. I also added the nutmeg as suggested and used toasted walnuts instead of the butterscotch chips. Overall a very tasty cookie for the fall season. They are very soft and cake like so not for those who prefer a crispy cookie. I stored between layers of waxed paper because I felt certain they would all stick together.

Tried today, and they did not disappoint on an early Fall day! Made these changes... half butter/half Crisco, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, subbed butterscotch with white choc chips, and added pecans. Also added about 1/4 tsp salt to half batter, which did wonders for flavor and rising. Next time I would do 3 eggs and more oats since they took a bit to cook and didn't hold as expected.

These are the first cookies I couldn't stop eating after I made them, and the first cookies where I wish I'd made a whole batch, instead of the usual half. My favorite! I sub coconut oil for shortening, and walnuts for butterscotch chips. I daresay the walnut version is better than the butterscotch.

I made these cookies with the following changes.  I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch chips.  I added 1/2 a cup of raisins.  They do not spread so you have to flatten them out before you bake them.  They were delicious.

I used a cup of butter and a 1/4 cup of shortening instead of a cup of shortening. Used 12 oz of butterscotch chips. Dough was not quite as thick as it should have been. However, they do taste great.

Crispy cookie with dark chocolate...perfect for Thanksgiving.  I prefer a crispy cookie; changes: 1 egg,  1 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown, temp 375 for 11 mins. I live in altitude (6000) so take this for what it's worth:)
