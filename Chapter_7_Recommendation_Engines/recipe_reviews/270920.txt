Made as written except that I grilled my chicken instead of boil for an added depth of flavor. I wasn't sure how the broth/cream cheese mix would do in the blender but it worked out perfectly. I ended up adding more cheddar for color and would probably do all cheddar next time. I anticipated the cream separating but it didn't happen. This turned out great and it is one I would make again.

I wasn't sure how blending the cheeses, broth and other ingredients would turn out. But it worked out perfectly. I added Lawry's Seasoned salt and used fresh cracked pepper. I substituted Hatch Chiles for the Poblanos because that's what I had and I used only 1/2 lb chicken because we don't like our soup too thick. We enjoyed this very much and will make again.

I doubled the recipe and cooked it in my crock pot. Came out perfect in no time. Next time I’m going to use double cheese. The kids loved it too.

I make this at least once a week, it’s my wife’s favorite soup.  I am trying canned Pablano peppers today instead of preparing fresh peppers which is time consuming.

One can looked like about 4-5 Pablano Peppers.

This soup is amazingly delicious.  I added kale to make it more healthy and some organic potatoes. The poblanos were the most time-consuming part of making this soup, especially because I doubled the recipe.

I made this exactly by the recipe because after all it wouldn’t be a Poblano soup if you omitted the peppers.  But I did add 2 tablespoons of smoked chipotle salsa and it was perfect!

I made quite a few changes: doubled the recipe, salsa instead of poblanos, added a pack of taco seasoning, used sharp cheddar and a little velveeta and cooked the chicken instead of boiling it.  My end result was DELICIOUS and I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it deserves it for giving me the groundwork!

Loved it. I decided to make this because I had already roasted  & peeled some Chillis & I had all the other ingredients on hand. I added some leftover roasted corn, and ate 2 bowlfuls. Yum!
