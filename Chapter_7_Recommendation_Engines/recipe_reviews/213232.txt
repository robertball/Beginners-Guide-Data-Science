Very tasty! I made this twice and changed a couple things the second time.

-  Doubled the recipe as it doesnt make very much.

- Halved the chilies, as this was super spicy.

- Extra water needed to be added. After I added the amount of water and lemon juice that was called for, there was no way it would come to a boil.

- Needs to be cooked longer. Both times I made this it took about 45-60 minutes after the potatoes were added. Leave yourself time for that!
