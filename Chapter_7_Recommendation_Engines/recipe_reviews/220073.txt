This is very good. Dad can not do spicy so I used Mild Italian Sausage and it worked great.  Followed the recipe except for the sausage and everyone commented that they really liked it. The only change I will make next time is to add more cheese to the grits. They lacked just a little in flavor. Overall, a great dinner that we will enjoy again and again.

This was good.  Substituted turkey sausage.  We like spicy, so I increased the Cajun seasonings to one teaspoon and added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Next time, I will thicken the sauce and try it over pasta.

Excellant! This was really good!I used the hot Italian sausage by Johnsonville and followed the recipe. I did add extra cajun seasoning (low salt) I am already planning on making this again.

I made this with Kohr's Spanish Rice instead of the Grits. It was amazing! Delicious! I would definitely make this dish again.

Very tasty - I omitted the corn and tomatoes, but otherwise it's a very easy recipe.

This is very good. We are not fond of grits so I did this with Polenta. I doubled the cheese & the garlic for additional flavor. This was a company worthy dish. Thanks for sharing!

This turned out very good.  The only thing I did was cut the recipe in half.  I loved the Asiago cheese in the grits.  This was pretty easy to make also.  I didn't realize it but I had bought quick grits, so that cut my cooking time considerably.

Really good--I used Johnsonville chorizo instead of hot Italian sausage and it went so well with the shrimp!  Next time, I think I'll make a sauce out of sausage drippings, a little flour, half & half, and Cajun seasoning to finish it.  Delicious!
