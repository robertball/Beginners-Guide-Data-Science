Super simple to make! I was looking for something different to do with the cucumbers from my garden. This was a nice change. I omitted the cayenne pepper so that my kids could eat it too.

Experimenting with some new cuke recipes with the TONS of fresh from the garden beauties we've gotten so far this summer... This was an interesting mix of flavors, not the best but not the worst either.  Only change I made was regular vs. baby carrots.  Wondering how it might be different/better with lemon juice instead....

This is very good. I like the combination of the lime, chili powder and cayenne. I made one batch with out the cayenne for my daughter. Easy to make and taste very good.

Great recipe! I must admit though that I added a little more than a pinch of cayenne. I love the heat. Thank you kellieann.

This is a very good quick recipe for a refreshing cucumber salad.  We enjoyed the chili powder combined with lime juice.  And the cayenne adds a kick.  Thanks kellieann for sharing your recipe. :)

Not my favorite; definitely different but probably not going to have mass appeal among our friends.

This recipe was pretty to look at (I followed the picture and out the carrots through the centers of the cucumbers), but I found the taste to be only so-so.  I was hoping for a fun new side to go with Mexican dishes, but I don't expect that I will make this again.

This was a simple and different recipe for my collection of "what to do with all these cucumbers" recipes.
I made it just like the recipe said and it was good.   Wished I would've had some cilantro to through in it for added zing.  If I make it again that is what i will do.

Didn't measure anything, added cumin and honey and it was a great splash of sweet/acidity with a kick, along side my chicken fajitas.  Yum!

This dish is O.K. but nothing special.  Not sure what changes I'd make to make it more to my liking.  Really wish I liked it better because it's simple, quick and low cal.
