Used this one with shoulder "country ribs" in the crock pot. They came out very tender and very tasty. Make sure to use regular soy sauce. I also added teryaki sauce for the last hour of cooking for extra flavor.

I will make this again, it smelled great and was so easy to make! I used garlic powder instead of garlic because I was running late for work, and doubled the sauce to make sure it covered all the meat. I also used low-sodium soy sauce.

Stunning.  I put it in the crockpot late, so gave it 3 hours on high, and the meat was still meltingly tender and very flavorful.  My superfussy 2 year old just came and scavenged a whole rib off my plate!

OK, I hardly EVER give a bad review.  But I followed this one exactly and they were totally so-so.  The line that says "6 hours or until tender"...well, after 10 hours they were so tough, I didnt finish one rib.  Either my meat was bad or this recipe just didnt work for me. The flavor was just mediocre so I wont even try this one again.

My boyfriend and his brother loved the ribs.  First I marinated the ribs with hoisin sauce, honey, soy sauce, and dry sherry.  Cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 hours.  The last 2 hours I added the mixture in this recipe, but used apricot preserves instead of the marmalade.  It came out great.  The sauce from the recipe made the ribs great.

I didn't have marmalade so I used peach preserves. Definitely cook down the liquid in a sauce pan at the end-it tastes wonderful and also makes it easier to skim off the fat. I've already sent this recipe to my daughters

Excellent recipe! My husband told me to keep this recipe because it was amazing. Notes: We like garlic, so I added an extra clove. To add a bit more complexity of flavor, I added a splash of rice wine vinegar, a splash of sesame oil, and a Tbs of Chinese five spice powder. Cooked it three hours in the Crockpot on high. Delicious!

After reading the reviews, I doubled the sauce ingredients, using apricot jam that I already had.  Also added 1 T Chinese five spice and  Rice vinegar and Sesame Oil to taste.  Added the sauce over the meat in the slow cooker.  At the end, I reduce the sauce by half and thickened with corn starch and water.    The entire family wanted seconds and declared it a keeper.

I didn't have marmalade, so I just used some orange juice & chopped up some canned peaches for sweetness. I felt like it was lacking something though because it wasn't quite a sticky sauce. I ended up pouring some of the sauce in a small pan & thickening it up with some flour.

We had this tonight and my husband and I loved it.  I couldn't find the marmalade so used duck sauce.  I vented the lid for the last hour or so of cooking and it thickened the sauce. This was really great.  Thanks.

Delicious and inexpensive meal when the pork is on sale. I also added Teriyaki and next time will cook down the sauce, to get a richer flavor.  Great shredded and served over white rice with the thickened sauce.

I am giving 5 stars on the sauce alone.  I had to rush a dinner so I cut up a pork roast into strips quickly pan fried and added your sauce.  I told my kids it was boneless pork ribs they gobbled it up!!

I made this yesterday using a pork loin roast instead of ribs.  Also substituted homemade tomato marmalade since I had no orange marmalade in the house and added a teaspoon of dried ginger.  Yummy!!!! served with rice and broccoli

Meat incredibly tender (the kids all inhaled the meat), but juices were discouragingly bland - disappointing, it smelled like it would taste fantastic.  Maybe cooking them down might do it but I doubt I'll make it again.

To my husband and I, this was one of the most tasteless recipes I have tried.   I had even added more marmalade in the beginning as I love it and wanted that sweet taste.  Maybe the problem was the meat, I don't know but will not make it again.  Sorry!

Double the sauce because it is sooo yummy! You do need extra for more flavor. The meat was very tender. I will make this again. Very easy.

I used shoulder pork ribs.  My whole family loved this.  The meat was very tender.  I would save some sauce though for putting extra on the ribs when on the plate to eat.  Other than that, it was easy and delicious!  It's a keeper.

I liked this recipe myself but my husband and son both said it tasted too tart. I followed the recipe exactly. My husband didn't like it any better the next day. Maybe it needs something to add some hotness to balance it out? I'm not sure.

My family of picky eaters loved this dish.  Next time I'll serve it over rice with broccoli.

I thought it was a bit too salty - would decrease the amount of soy.  Otherwise easy to make.

This was so tasty and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly the only exception being it was cooked for 8 hours instead of 6. It was sweet and salty with a good texture in the sauce.

I think this is the recipe I used but substituted apricot jam for the marmalade.

I don't think the ingredients gave the ribs enough flavor .... tasted like plain ribs slow-cooked in water. Might try this recipe again with double the ingredients, which hopefully might give it the right amount of flavor.

These are fabulous.  Even the picky eaters in my house love them.  It seems that I never have any orange marmalade though, so we always use honey.

My very picky four year old had thirds!  Following the advise of other reviewers, I reduced the sauce a bit before serving.  I added a little bit more marmalade to the sauce while reducing it.

What a fantastic recipe and it's so easy to make. Followed recipe exactly. My husband and I loved them. They were so tender they melted in your mouth. The only thing I might do next time as June suggested is to thicken the juices. They were a big hit. Thanks for the recipe June.

My ribs came out moist and falling off the bone, however the taste left something to be desired.  Both my husband and I are exprerienced cooks and we could not figure out what was missing from the sauce.  I even thickened the sauce after it cooked all day in the slow cooker and added salt, pepper and some ginger to the sauce.  I was disappointed in the sauce and seasoning of this recipe.

The five stars are for the sauce alone. I would use this on many things, it was that good.  I tried the recipe exactly, and honestly, after trying them, I really do not like country style ribs.  However, this was still awesome.  The sauce reminded me of orange beef sauce (I did add one little squirt of sriracha to it for some heat).  So, if you like that kind of flavor, you will really like it.  I will edfinitely use it again, just on another cut of meat.

Very easy!  I used bone in country style pork ribs and it turned out just great!  Thank you, this is definitely a keeper. I will double the sauce next time to have plenty to pour over rice!

This came out very good, I did add about a 1/2 tsp of honey and when it was almost done, I drained the sauce out and put it in a pot and reduced it, which thickened it without the need of flour. I also splashed in alittle teryakai. Good recipe. I'm always looking for one that is not soooo barbacueeeee. june

This recipe is extremely easy and yummy!  I used boneless country pork ribs and added a little extra teriyaki sauce on top to cover meat.  My 2 year-old also loved this!
