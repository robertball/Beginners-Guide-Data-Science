I made the  recipe as written and grilled the packets.  The flavor is absolutely delicious. I will say, it made too much! So I froze half of it for future use. You can safely halve the ingredients of the glaze for the amount of salmon specified.

I used this only as a guide, but what a tasty guide it was! I foil wrapped baked the salmon filets with just the sauce while I stir-fried veggies (onion, match stick carrots, red peppers, broccoli, rehydrated shiitake mushrooms, sugar snaps and green beans) and cooked chow mein noodles.  Then, I added the remainder of the sauce to the veggies, stirred in the noodles and served the salmon on top of the veggie chow mein. I made the sauce as is, but substituted about a teaspoon of dried ginger and white wine vinegar for the rice vinegar, as that was what I had.  Yummy!  I would make this again. ...my way.

YUMMY, the fish was flaky and moist and the veggies perfectly steamed. So simple to make and great tasting!!! The grill was out of gas so I baked two fillets on rack in oven for 15 but check first. Mine was done but hubby's was still pink in middle (oops) I used red wine vinegar and canola oil because that is what I had on hand. Also no mushrooms, but I am sure any veggies would work. Used more sauce while cooking and added 1 clove of garlic. Will make again and easy clean up a plus!

We liked this, but probably will not make it again since we have other salmon recipes that we like way better.

I wanted to fix something with an Asian flare and use up some Alaskan salmon. This recipe fit the bill! I didn't have any terrakki sauce,so I used plumb sauce,and low sodium soy sauce. Everything else I had,and this turned out to 4 stars delicious! Next time I'll make it with terrakki sauce and it will be a five star recipe for salmon! Very easy recipe and easy to clean up too!

I doubled the ginger in the sauce, but I really like ginger. The sauce seems pretty versatile. I used sugar snap peas instead of snow peas, and the husband seemed to enjoy the mushrooms in his (I don’t like mushrooms so I left them off mine).  I imagine you can add whatever veggies you want - baby corn, bamboo shoots, etc, and it’d cook down well.

Easy. It was good, but not great. Sauce was a bit too gingery for my taste.  Followed the recipe except I used sugar snap peas. And I used regular foil (rather than non-stick) sprayed with olive oil. There will be extra sauce  so be sure to servie with rice.

Delicious salmon recipe. I made this on the spur of a moment and had to substitute some ingredientDid not have fresh ginger so used dried ground ginger. Also did not have rice vinegar or sesame oil  so used balsamic white vinegar and grape seed oil instead. Let the salmon marinade in sauce for about an hour and then baked in a 450 oven in stick free foil packets for 20 min. It was cooked perfect and delicious.

I will be making this again!!  I forgot to get the teriyaki sauce at the store so had to compromise and replaced it with Hawaiian-pineapple sauce. It was amazing! Plus, the foil really helps cooking this perfectly!

I am not a fish kind of person, so I was worried that the veggies would taste too fishy. They were actually very tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly (minus mushrooms, not a fan.) I used the extra dipping sauce, my hubby did not. I will make this again!

It would be more helpful if I'm supposed to serve over hot cooked rice if the directions start by telling me to cook the rice. Otherwise very flavorful. I wasn't sure that 10 minutes would be enough but it was.
