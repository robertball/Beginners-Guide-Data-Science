I made this for Dinner today,  I subbed the dried Thai-style rice noodles, wide (such as Chantaboon Rice Noodles) for regular rice noodles as I had no time to go to the Asian market, I also used 1/2 a serrano pepper instead of 2 cos the kids were going to eat it too.  I added some red and yellow bell peppers to compensate for the serrano pepper reduction and for added colour. We all liked this recipe and I will be making it again, Thanks DeborahB for a great recipe!

Very yummy, just a little on the too-spicy side for me (I should have either seeded my pepper or used a half). If you can't find the thick soy sauce, consider mixing 2 tsp of molasses with 1 tsp of reg. soy sauce. I used a thin-cut pork loin chop. It was really delicious, and next time I'll try with tofu for a veggie version. Thanks for the fun recipe! The spiciness was cut down by the ice cold beer I had with the dish.

This was an interesting dish to make. Don't get worried if it tastes a little weird while you're cooking it, everything comes together in the end. The ingredients in thick soy sauce are soy sauce, molasses, sugar, and salt. It can be found in a jar in the soy sauce section of an Asian market. Next time I will just try to use regular soy sauce and brown sugar instead because it had a little bit of a weird taste. I think that I kept the noodles in hot water for too long because they started to fall apart into 1" pieces... and I didn't even keep them in for the suggested full 1 hour. Definitely check the noodles while they're cooking so you don't overdo it. Otherwise, the taste was delicious.

Absolutely delicious and it doesn't require any special or hard to find asian ingredients.  I made a few changes.  I didn't add the basil during cooking.  I waited until right before serving the noodles to add fresh, chopped basil.  I also added fresh,chopped cilantro and green onions.  The fresh ingredients made a huge difference.  Next time I am also going to serve with chopped peanuts.

I made this tonight for dinner, very very good!! I used chicken breast cut into strips instead of pork because I had to use them tonight. I went a couple different places and finally found the thick soy sauce. My hubby really liked this and asked for me to make this weekend for his parents. Thank you Deb for this wonderful recipe!!

With only 1 total teaspoon of thick soy sauce in the entire recipe, this lacked some moisture for me.  My husband added a lot of extra sauce at the table, but I was never able to enjoy it.  We also added the full serrano pepper, and thought it needed much more in order to compare with the Thai restaurant down the street!

I made this for lunch today and it was very delicious! I cut the serving down to 1 for me alone but I wish I made more. I subbed chicken breast strips for the pork (since I hardly ever eat pork) and sweet peppers for the bean sprouts (I don't get those here) This turned out so delicious and since I like spicy food this really hit the spot! Thanks for sharing your recipe Deb!

This was great! I just had chipotle peppers so I used those. Also used very thin Asian rice noodles and added chopped peanuts at the end. Fantastic!

I'm giving this one four stars since I changed the recipe "a little" when I made it.  I doubled the noodles, cuz I love rice noodles.  I had some fresh ginger on hand so I minced about a tablespoon and split it between the noodles and the pork.  Since others complained of dryness, I used a ridiculous amount of sauce (1:1 molasses: regular soy sauce). 2tbsp with the noodles and 7tbsp with the pork.  Also added in 3/4 red pepper with the pork which is why I added SO much more sauce.  In the end, this is one of my favorite recipes that I've tried from this site.  Thanks Deb for the great mix of flavors and "template" recipe.

Sooo good!  This dish had a lot of flavor!  I couldn't find the large rice noodles since my store had a very small ethnic section but they had thinner ones for which I followed the directions on the package and they were fine... I used another reviewers suggestion to make the thick soy sauce with brown sugar and I probably doubled my oil but I didn't measure, just poured some in the pan.  I added one whole serrano chili that I seeded and it was just mild in heat. I threw in a handful of shredded carrot and a little crushed peanuts on top.  So yummy, I will definately make this one again! :)

I made my way to the Asian market for thick soy sauce and it was a worthwhile trip.  Prepared as directed this recipe was excellent.  I was concerned about a lack of moisture and was plotting what I would add to fix it, but no fix was needed.  Excellent!

I gave it 4 stars for being the only drunken noodles recipe on here and for not having any crazy hard to find ingredients. I did what everyone said to make thick soy sauce with molasses and soy sauce but the recipe definitely needed more sauce. it also needed something to spice it up more. I added the thai chili sauce but just a little. I also added a red pepper for some more color. Definitely will make again!

I thought it was just alright, but dbf thought it was great. Pork turned out pretty salty, next time I might leave out or halve the salt in step 3. For thick soy sauce I used 1 t. soy sauce and 1 t. brown sugar; I know it's not the same but I am hurting for cash right now! Just for the record, when I stumble home from the club, a recipe this complicated is NOT what I would come up with!

The thing I love most about the pad kee mao at my favorite Thai restaurant is that it is extremely full of flavor. This, sadly, is not that pad kee mao. While the finished product was decent, it was not what I have been searching for. I think to have the right flavor it needs more of the thick soy sauce, as well as maybe some other mystery ingredient. As it is, it just tastes a bit bland and unfinished.

The spiciness of jalapenos is what makes this dish so great.  I have made it numerous times and have used different meats - beef, pork, chicken, and even shrimp.

Stellar! And simple! Oh wow, I love this dish! I used seafood, fresh rice noodles; added mushrooms and omitted the sugar. I added extra thick soy sauce and I believe the thick soy sauce is a must, because it imparts flavor that regular soy sauce does not. I didn't have fresh basil, however, I did have fresh pesto, so I blended it at the last minute.  Must try! Thanks, Deborah B and your husband!

The flavor is decent, but it is missing egg, which is in every Pad Kee Mao dish I've ever had.  Our local restaurant also uses mushrooms and bamboo shoots in their dish, which might not be "authentic" but I love.  Overall, this was pretty good, but I'm going to try it again with an egg for sure, mushrooms and bamboo shoots, possibly in place of the bean sprouts. I'm also going to try replacing some or all of the serrano pepper with chili paste.

Good recipe, though I prefer to leave out the sugar, use fish sauce instead of salt and THAI-basil leaves instead of the common basil leaves. The serrano pepper is only there to give the dish a rich and spicy taste, but should not be eaten, unless you like a very spicy taste.

I followed this recipe exactly, and found it rather bland. I was disappointed because Pad Kee Mao is one of my favorite Thai dishes, but this is nothing like what we get at our local restaurant. The basic ingredients are there, but the sauce is wrong. It doesn't taste like much... just a little salt flavor. Plus, I couldn't even taste the spice from one serrano pepper. I will try making this again, but will play around with marinating the meat and finding the right sauce.

This was a fast and easy to put together, filling, tasty meal. I didn't use the wide noodles, because the thin was what I had. Also added a few veggies that needed to be used up such as a carrot, a couple of small red and yellow peppers and a few mushrooms. I also reversed the directions and cooked the veggies and meat prior to the noodles. The sauce was wonderful. I didn't feel the dish was hot at all and could have had more peppers added to it, but for my daughter, it was perfect so based on that, if you want more heat you can always add more to individual plates.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  After searching for a few weeks and going to several stores, I never did find "thick soy sauce".  I used a ginger flavored soy that had molasses and sugar in it.  Also, I did add julienned carrots and red bell peppers.  Not much just enough for color.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again.  I'll be looking for "thick soy" the next trip out of the boonies...

Twas pretty fantastic. I doubled the garlic because me and my roommate are garlic fanatics. The rice noodles proved to be a bit of a pain but I googled ways to speed up the process a bit and it was recommended to boil water and use a metal strainer-thingy to dip the dry noodles in for a minute or so until they are soft. Otherwise the flavor was great and it was very well received by my roommate and my boyfriend.

Excellent! I made with regular soy though, rather than thick soy. Hubby suggested maybe next time adding some shrimp to it. Will make again for sure! Thanks!

This has become a "go-to" dish for nights that I just don't feel like cooking but don't want to go out either.  Its so quick and easy and adaptable to whatever is on hand.  We have experimented with many different shapes/sizes of rice noodle and really love using a vietnamese noodle that is fat and sticky!

Excellent way to use leftover pork.  I didn't add any pepper since my family doesn't like spicy food.

This was really tasty.  Will add some green onion and fresh cilantro at the end next time.  My wife (who is Chinese) actually liked these more than I did since she has a love for rice noodles that borders on the absurd.  She also claims that the pork and mushrooms (we added sliced mushrooms) should be fried up in the sauce with some fresh ginger and a little extra salt.  Anyway, well done!  Thank your husband for us.

Wonderful flavor!  I doubled the sauce and added some red bell pepper.  I've also tried it with chicken, it was good, but I prefer the pork.

This was a really fun, quick and easy to make. This is one of my favorite takeout dishes and while I was skeptical initially it turned out delicious!!! I could find the noodles they specified so I just used Annie Chungs whole wheat rice noodles and cooked according to the package directions. I also have no idea what "thick soy sauce" is and I was too lazy to google it so I used a mixture of hoisin sauce and low sodium soy sauce. I also used jalapeño as I couldn't find Serrano peppers. Despite the changes and my inevitable laziness, it turned out great. I love spicy and this was a very very perfectly spicy dish. Will definitely make again!

excellent.  Substituted tofu for the pork and made it vegetarian.  Added extra serranos too and fresh basil from the garden.  With a nice Cabernet.  Yummy.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was not to my liking.  NO way around it. I went online to find another recipe.  Please, please...use a different recipe instead of this one.  Your taste buds will thank you.

I made this using zucchini “noodles” instead of rice noodles. Instead of using pork, I added more vegetables,  the mixture tasted somewhat bland so I added a little fish sauce and oyster sauce. I used Thai chili peppers instead of Serrano peppers. Thanks for the recipe:)

Wow this was amazing! The only thing I did wrong was I thought I could handle three Serrano peppers, my mouth is still burning after half an hour.

Loved this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  Used more pork and used a cup of bean sprouts since I needed to use them up.  I have a lot of sweet basil, so I used that and as another reviewer suggested, added it with the bean sprouts.  Another reviewer suggested using more thick soya, and since I added more meat and bean sprouts, I used more thick soya.  I took the advice of other reviewers and made my own thick soya using molasses, soya, salt and sugar.  I added a TBSP peanut butter to the sauce.  I didn't have the pepper, so I heated some dry chili's in the oil before frying.  I used a combination of sesame oil and vegetable oil for more authentic flavor.  We enjoyed very much.

Delicious!!  Thank you for sharing. I replaced the Serrano peppers with 3 Thai chili’s. I also left the pork and bamboo sprouts out, and just added sliced red pepper and carrots. The sauce was very tasty. I will be making this again.

GREAT recipe, however I changed it up a bunch. 

First - I couldn't find the fat noodles so used thing Rice Noodles, which worked fine. 
Second - I also could not find the thick soy sauce so made my own (cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes 1C Soy Sauce,  1C and 1 Tbls Spoon Brown Sugar. Let sit for a few minutes before using)
Third - I used shrimp and beef instead of pork and my veggies were  Green and Red Peppers, half an onion
I also added some red chille paste at the end for some extra heat.

This recipe was delicious. I made mine with baked tofu I made with another recipe and it was so delicious. It definitely stands up to the Thai restaurants here. The one thing I would change is boil the noodles based on the bag directions rather than let them soak. My noodles soaked overnight and they still didn't have the needed texture. Boiling them for 5-6 minutes corrected that.

I threw carrots, a green bell pepper and tofu into mine since that's how I'm used to getting it at my favorite thai restaurant, it had a nice flavor but definitely not what I am used to and if you like even a little spice I would suggest more then one Serrano pepper.

I think this recipe is close to the dish I had at a restaurant.  The flavor was slightly off but it still tastes very good. I wonder if it is because I didn't use thick soy sauce. I simply used regular soy sauce. I have no idea what is thick soy sauce! All in all, this is a great recipe and is super easy to make.

The whole family loved this and that's with 3 kids from 5-16. There aren't many meals that have them all raving! We used pork as instructed and added the thick soy sauce to taste as the recipe was coming out on the dry side. With the range of ages and tolerances we have I only used a portion of a Serrano pepper to keep the spice to a minimum. Also used some red and yellow pepper for color and flavor. Due to preference I also reduced the amount of basil by about half. We were all amazed at how close this recipe tasted to the popular Thai restaurant we frequent. Making tonight with chicken to see how that compares - can't wait! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I haven't tried to make this yet.  I'm just writing to thank you for that great explanation of the name of the dish!  I have often ordered in the great Thai restaurant nearby and have wondered why I can't taste any liquor in it!  Thanks so much!

I used regular soy sauce and brown sugar as another reviewer suggested. I also added oyster sauce and extra soy sauce. I made veggie style with peppers and onions instead of pork. The basil is so delicious! A must for the dish. Will make again!
