This is a very good recipe.  I didn't have the Chinese spice so I mixed Herbs De Provence with the finely chopped Garlic and Rosemary.  I also cooked a whole duck (put some of the spices inside the duck while cooking.  For the wine sauce I used a blackberry port and raspberry/blackberry jelly.  This was a great meal for three or four people.

The wine I used was kind of dry, so I added a little bit more of the jelly/jam. Ran out of the five-spice powder, so I also substituted it with a little bit of mixed herbs.  It still turned out really good. Will definitely make this again!

I loved the cooking method for this duck and will do again. I had two duck legs, so I used an 8x8 pan, and only had dried rosemary. I put about a Tbsp of olive oil, with rosemary and five unpeeled garlic cloves (I was afraid they would burn without the peel and they almost did anyway)on the bottom of the pan. Baked as directed. I used chipotle jam (no currant jelly) and added a bit of agave syrup for sweetness to the red wine mixture. The sauce really did add a nice flavor to the duck; I also added the drippings, after I poured off the fat, with rosemary to the sauce, ummm, ummm good! (Only problem was I used kosher salt on the duck and it was a bit too salty; stick to sea salt or use less next time.)  Overall very good! Thank you for the recipe seattlelove.

Great recipe! I skipped the five-spice powder and used an herb mix instead.  The sauce is perfect!

Thank you so, so much for this recipe! I don't have a ton of experience in the kitchen, I'm competent, but I'm single, so I never cooked all that much until a few months ago when I moved to a new place with a gas stove/oven. Suddenly I find myself inspired. Anyway, duck is one of my very favorites, but I didn't have the courage to attempt it at home. That is until I saw some frozen duck legs at the grocery store recently and thought, 'hey, why not? it's not a whole duck, not a huge commitment.' Did my search on AllRecipes and found your recipe. Tried it tonight and it came out perfectly! So, happy that I can actually cook a good duck dish in my own home. It was so easy, it seems impossible to screw it up. I couldn't find Chinese 5-Spice at my grocery store, so I made my own concoction by combining cinnamon, cumin, coriander, Chinese ginger and coarse-ground pepper (and sea salt). Worked for me! Anyway, I will definitely be making this again and you have given me the courage to try other duck recipes. Thanks so much!

This was absolutely delicious and very easy to execute.  I followed the recipe as is.  I did however reduce the sauce further after the 5 min simmer as it looked a bit thin.  It resulted in too little sauce in the end.  You want as much as possible as this sauce makes the dish.  Served it with white wine risotto.  Making it again for Christmas!!

I followed the recipe, but made a few changes. 
For the sauce, instead of red current jelly, I used my homemade cherry jam, and added a splash of Port. Delicious! 
Also, I skipped the garlic as I was serving roasted veggie with LOTS of garlic cloves.

It was great.  I didn't have current jelly so I used lingenberry jam.  It tasted really good.

Superb, one of my favorite ways to prepare duck.  Also works great on turkey thighs (if you can find them!).
