I would rate this cake 4-5 stars on taste, but on procedure and appearance I'd give it a 3.  First off, it tastes delicious.  I bake a lot, and this will definitely be made again.  My husband and I almost just polished off 1/2 the cake.  On the baking process, I will not use the blender next time.  I will use my stand mixer and follow the same process.  The blender did not mix it well and it was almost spilling out.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice since I don't have that.  I would have to alter the recipe if I wanted to serve it to others (other than me and my family) because I didn't like how it didn't fill the pan enough so it wasn't a nice tall bundt cake.  It stands low.  i used a silicone bundt pan and it took about 40-45 minutes to bake through.  Great tasting, I love the syrup in it, but would use my stand mixer next time.  Thanks for a good tasting bundt cake recipe!!!

Unfortunately, I didn't care for this cake at all.  It reminded me of flavor of those fat-free apple muffins that they sell at 7-11.  I do agree that it was easy to make. It just didn't suit my personal taste.

Super easy and super YUMMY!!!  Used the apple with the peel left on and threw it in the Vita-mix (excellent machine for easy and healthy cooking) did the apple with the milk and pulsed it to chop it, then added it back in at the at the end.  THANK YOU, will use this one regularly!

This tasted really eggy. I made a glaze with powdered sugar, cinnamon, maple extract and water which improved the taste some, but I won't be making this again. An expensive waste of maple syrup.

this is FAAAABULOUS!  the whole house smelled wonderful, just a few minutes into baking.  i ran out of maple syrup, so i wound up using about 1/4 cup maple syrup, and the rest the "fake" low-cal stuff my mom buys.  then, i added about 1/2 teaspoon of maple extract...still tasted great!

This is a pretty good recipe. It was easy and fun, I'd never made a blender cake before.  The only things I'd change is that I'd leave out the allspice, was a little overkill with the other spices, and I'd add more  chopped apples.
