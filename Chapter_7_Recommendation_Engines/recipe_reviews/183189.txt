First let me say these taste great and I will be giving some as gifts.  I'm not sure how these are supposed to look...I was looking for a "glazed" pecan.  They were not glazed...kinda crumbly.  My camera is broken, otherwise I would post a pic.     I first measured out 10 c of pecans and realized they would not fit into two 9x13 pans in a single layer.  So, I reduced the amount of pecans (about 6 C. fit into three 9x13 pans). I also didn't put the whole Tbs of red pepper bc of kids. I cooked a little longer to "roast" the pecan, but watch carefully, you don't want to burn the sugar/candy coating.  Enjoy!

I made these and, sadly, let them burn a little. The chili flavor was very strong, so I decided to cover them in milk chocolate. Oh my goodness, not to discredit the original, but I would recommend it! At first bite, it tastes like your regular chocolate covered pecan, but then the spice kicks in. The chocolate + chili/cayenne makes a party in the mouth.

I love these pecans! It was pretty hard to stop picking at them. I put them in a salad with feta cheese, strawberries, mandarin slices, and balsamic vinaigrette. I accidentally put my first batch on wax paper and I couldn't get them off so make sure to use parchment!

Wonderful!  I made these as belated Christmas gifts and also served at a Superbowl party (they go great with beer!).  The only reason that I did not give it a 5 star was because they were a little soft from soaking them in the sugar...not sure how to solve this to get them to come out crunchy.  Otherwise, I loved them!

These were tasty!  I really wanted them to be sweeter, so I may increase the sugar or decrease the chili powder or both next time I make these (and there will be a next time).  I followed the recipe almost exactly, only reducing the cayenne because we have kids.  Maybe I should have baked them a little longer, because they were sticky and soft.  I let them cool completely on the counter, hoping they would dry out and crisp up some, but they didn't, so I put them back in the oven at 225 and roasted them "chex mix style" for 1 hr and 15 min., stirring them every 15 minutes, and they got nice and crunchy without burning.  I'm glad I didn't give up on them because they are a unique, yummy snack to set out for company. Thanks for this recipe! :)

I make these for the guys I work with offshore and it doesn't last very long.  Great recipe, not too spicy and not too sweet.

These didn't turn out nearly as crunchy as I would have liked. I accidentally incinerated the last batch I made.
