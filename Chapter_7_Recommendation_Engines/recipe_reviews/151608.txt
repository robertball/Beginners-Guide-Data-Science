This was really great... very easy too!  

I didn't have any flour tortillas so I used
3 cups of elbow macaroni, measured before cooking.  It worked well, with a little leftover.  

I made the recipe for 10 since there were guys over to play guitars and jam a little with my boyfriend.  It made ALOT but they devoured it and had 3 bowls each which left just enough for one bowl for myself and a little leftover for lunch.  

I added chopped onion, chopped garlic, cayenne, and a no salt organic seasoning which I picked up at Costco some time back and this really turned out tasty!

This recipe was ok only. I made it as written, but it would need some changes to make it more to my liking. Taco seasoning would help add some zip. My flour tortillas stuck together and gummed up a bit, so I wouldn't add them into the skillet next time. I was thinking that corn tortillas would possibly work better. That being said, my family did eat every bite. I think I may try it again with some changes.

this recipie was from a magazine so i was going to add it,but looks like that was already done. but i have to say this recipie is really really good, exept i didnt use tortillas because i thought that they would absorb the soup part and get to soggy. so instead i used tortilla CHIPS. this turned out well. it gave it and extra crunch here and there. i also found that this recipie is easy to eat as a dip sort of thing. i ate it like a dip with the tortilla chips also. all in all i thought this recipie was great and that is the only thing i changed! =]

I used leftover seasoned taco meat in this recipe, other than that, I made no changes. Good base recipe, next time I'd goose it up a bit with more add-in's. Even with the seasoned taco meat I used, it was still bland. I made little bowls of shredded lettuce, chopped black olives, chopped green onion, diced tomatoes and reduced fat sour cream as toppings for this dish. Each of us was able to top our serving with what we liked.

Big hit with the family.  I also added drained diced tomato and chili beans to bulk it up, and add a bit more protein.  We loved it.

I selected this recipe for a ski trip because it was quick and easy. I used whole wheat tortillas and added a diced onion, some crushed red pepper and several crushed garlic cloves after cooking the meat.  Topped with some lite sour cream, shredded romaine and diced tomatoes.  Yum!!

Excellent! I added macaroni, taco seasoning and kidney beans. I didn't use tortillas. My husband loved this, it is a keeper! Thanks!

I have been making this for years. It's always a big hit with guys, and it's super quick and easy. If you don't like soggy tortillas then this isn't for you, but personally that's my favorite part.

I think that this dish is so simple, yet so amazing. For it being so versatile, I keep it simple and stick to the recipe(which is a rarity in and of itself). However, instead of adding the tortilla chips in WITH the Mexican/beef combo yummy stuff, for fear of them getting soggy, I turn this into a dip and let the kids chow down from their own bowls full of it! Delicious and three thumbs up!

Very good meal. I did add taco seasoning and chili beans as recommended by other cooks. My little spin to the recipe was I took the pieces of flour tortillas and fried them in my deep fryer, mixed, and then put in pyrex for 25 minutes at 350.

This was pretty good, we ate it all.  It was extremely easy and even the kids helped make it.  I followed the recipe exactly, except used some already shredded taco cheese I had to use up, it made it have quite a bite to it.  Next time I'll try it with the sour cream and possibly some corn.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the thought of Tomato soup in the mix sounds gross.  I'm not a big fan of Tomato Soup.  But this recipe did inspire me to make a 5 star recipe!
I used 2lbs ground beef, 1 pkgs taco seasoning, 1 10oz can of Rotel Chunky Tomato & Green Chilies, 1 10oz can of Rotel Mexican lime & cilantro tomatoes, 1 cup Salsa, 1/2 cup water, 1 cup corn, 1 1/2 cups grated mild cheddar cheese, and Doritos Nacho chips.  Brown and drain meat, add in the water and taco seasoning.  Add tomatoes salsa, and corn. stir and heat through. In a 9 x 13 pan layer meat mixture, doritos,cheese, meat, doritos cheese.  Bake uncovered at 350degrees for 20 min. just long enough to heat through and melt cheese.  Serves 8 and so AMAZING and full of flavor!

Really good! I'd say 4.5 stars. . I added a bit of minced garlic, taco seasoning, salt & pepper, and corn. . . besides that I followed the recipes, using both variations. (sour cream, mexican blend cheese, and corn tortillas.) Simple and delicious! :)

I make this with a few additions.  Instead of Campbell's soup and water, I use a can of diced tomatoes, Philadelphia Cream Cheese Sante Fe flavored, sour cream (the Phila CC is a tad salty), sauteed onion and garlic.  Corn tortillas are more flavorful than the flour.  This works well with ground turkey also.  My family loves it!!

The flour tortillas just ended up being gummy and soft.  Next time I'm definitely going to add elbow macaroni instead as well as a lot more spices.

Honestly, I was surprised.  Who knew tomato soup and salsa could taste good together??  I was a little concerned how these flavors would meld, so I mixed together the browned beef, soup, and salsa and then tasted.   It definitely needed a little more flavor, so I added some taco seasoning (recipe from this site) and a little ground pepper.  Knowing that the tortillas would swell up once they were added to the ground beef mixture, I only used four, that quantity was perfect for us, and this meal was good to go.  This is pretty darn good for something you can put together in literally minutes with ingredients you most likely have on hand.

I have been making this for a couple of years and it's good every time. It's easy, quick, and hot. The only change I consistently make is to use a whole jar (16oz.) of medium salsa, eliminate the water, and use a whole cup of cheese (if you like cheesy). Occasionally I will substitute ground turkey or pork, or add some corn. It's good any way I make it.

This was pretty darn good! Of course I can never follow a recipe exactly... So I added some diced onion, diced red bell pepper,  and minced garlic to the meat mixture. I also added a small can of chopped chilies and a small can of black beans and used corn tortillas instead. Served it with a side of rice, and it was delicious! I will definitly remake this one!

I would give this 3.5 stars.  Pretty good for a weeknight meal.  Overall, fairly easy and quick to prepare, and inexpensive.  The dish had a pretty strong tomato soup taste in my opinion, so I might suggest adding sour cream towards the end of the cooking to try and ton that down a bit.

I personally would have given this recipe 4 stars, but since the whole family ate it, it gets 5 stars in my house. The only difference, is that I added a packet of taco seasoning (as others suggested).

This was surprisingly good...I don't think of it and therefore don't make it as much as I should!! Great with corn and a loaf of bread or a nice salad.  Even my picky children eat it without asking with the "tortilla" things are!!!!  I have altered it to omit the salsa and cheese, and replaced it with a pounch of taco seasoning.  Just had it the other nite....YUM.

I added a can of corn, and fresh chopped tomatoes to the mixture.  This is a great recipe that my children love.  I love it because it's quick and easy peasy, so when I am short on time, or just feeling lazy, I can make this and still have a hearty meal for the fam.  There are tons of variations you can do too based on what you have on hand.

On a positive note, this recipe was quick and easy to make.  However, it needed a LOT more flavor and the combination of the condensed soup and the flour tortillas gave it a thick, mushy texture with little flavor due to the lack of any sort of spices or seasonings.  Both my husband and I had heartburn shortly after one serving.  If I ever made it again, I'd make some significant changes. - A bit more water.  More salsa.  Taco seasoning mix for much-needed flavor.  And instead of cooking flour tortillas into the skillet and having them get too soft and saturated, I'd add corn tortilla chips at the very end to give it some crunch.

I followed the directions exactly. Probably the worst taco ever. The tomato soup adds an odd taste and with the tortilla pieces it tastes a lot like spaghetti o's. If you've got make this, substitute tomato paste or puree for the soup and add a package of taco seasoning. Or, you can eliminate the tomato ingredient and use a can of refried beans. Only saving grace is that it is a one-pot entrée.

I ended up doubling this recipe. I also used whole wheat tortillas, added Kidney beans, and served over white rice - very yummy! Everyone ate it up! I do think I will maybe add some taco seasoning next time to kick up the flavor, but overall, this was an easy & tasty meal!!

Followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was fabulous!!! Second time I had corn I wanted to use up in the fridge so tossed that in, did the same with odds and ends of other veggies. Just a great recipe to play around with and make your own

This was very easy but delicious. I did use corn tortillas and cheese dip instead of shredded cheese. Definitely a keeper.

Nobody in my house really liked the soggy tortillas, but the flavors were nice. I would make something similar to this in the future but with some additional spices and with noodles.

If you make this with flour tortillas, it is like eating a big gummy mess, hence the "2" rating.  If you use corn tortilla it holds up so much better. If you use tortilla chips it is nice and crunchy and kids will lap it up.  Super easy to throw together.

This was fantastic! I used chunks of grilled chicken instead of beef and I think it's even better that way! If I could give this more than just 5 stars, I would! Great recipe!

Pretty good.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and added taco seasoning and beans.  Those additions made it more like Taco Dip than a type of enchilada casserole, which I'm guessing is more what Campbells was going for.  I will try it without the beans for sure next time.

I followed the directions completely, however next time i'd definitely add my favorite mexican seasonings and use tomato sauce or paste as opposed to the soup.

So delicious!!!  My little family and I loved dipping the tortilla chips in our bowls with sour cream.  It is simple and good budgetable meal.  I added the Chili & Beans can to the saucepan to be simmered whiile I browned the ground sirloin and the sauce beame thick.  I only spent less than $10 for this supper.  Wonderful taste!!! I give this recipe FIVE STARS!  Thank you, Campbell!  You rock!!  Oh, before I forget, I omitted the flour tortillas as I thought it was too much for my diet. Ha! I like the tortilla chips better.

Solid recipe. As is, I give it three stars. Even with tweaks it is three stars, but it was delicious and quick and my kids really liked it because it is pretty mild. I'd make it again. I did use the chips and corn tortillas, because I found out I didn't have flour tortillas. Oops.

This was surprisingly delicious! I was flipping through my mom's cook book and I came across this recipe. I happened to have all the ingredients and decided to give it a try. It was extremely easy and quick to make. The only think i did differently was I added taco seasoning to the beef while I cooked it. I used corn tortillas and although it was a little mushy, we loved it!

We loved this recipe! We followed the recipe and made no changes. It was very delicious. I wanted to add some seasoning because I was afraid it would be bland but Hubby said no. Just a little black pepper was all it needed. The tortillas were not gummy, just soft and hot and delicous.  Next time I may try crispy tortillas for a change of flavor or texture & Hubby said using ground turkey would be good too and would make it healthier. We will definately make this again.

This is pretty good with a couple of changes.  As others already offered, adding the tortillas in makes them soggy, so I would either have them on the side to put the filling in, or use chips to scoop them up.  Also, I would add a packet of taco seasoning.  Last, you could try to use a soup with a little more zip.  This is would a great offering to munch down while watching a football game!

This was really yummy!!  I had to change it a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients but it still turned out soooooooooooooo good.  It always bugs me when I read reviews and people totally change the recipe and then say it was good but this time I really had no other choice and I want others to know that it still turned out awesome!  Instead of tomato soup, I used a 15 oz can of chile con carne (no beans).  The only salsa I had on hand was a salsa with mango and peach which gave it a really subtle sweet taste.  I did saute the meat in onions, then added some garlic, salt and mexican seasoning to the meat directly after draining it.  I followed the recipe as far as putting the tortillas in the mix and that was my favorite part!!  So yummy.  The whole family loved it and we will definitely be repeating this one.  Thanks!

I loved this. It was so easy to make. I was nervous about putting the tortillas in there after reading some of the reviews about them sticking together, but I'm so glad I did it anyway.  It was delicious. If you don't add the tortillas the sauce will be too runny. I added a little bit of taco seasoning to give it more flavor and next time I will add more and I will put onions in with the meat.  It was so good!

I thought this was pretty good.  I think the taste of these types of recipes depends on the salsa used.  If you use a mild, bland salsa you will get bland food since it is really the only thing flavoring this dish.  I used medium salsa and I also added a little chili powder (1/2 tsp) and garlic powder (1-2 tsp).  Used taco flavored cheese.

This is pretty good. I only added 3/4 can of the soup. I jazzed it up with some cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and Tabasco Sauce. I crushed up Sweet Chili Doritos and mixed those in after I dished into bowls. I'm making tacos tonight with the leftover meat.

My son and I both really liked this recipe. I did add a packet of taco seasoning to add a little more zip. I only gave four stars though because my husband didn't like the mushy consistency. I will definitely make this again but maybe stir in tortilla chips to my husbands instead of flour tortillas.

My family loved the taste but did not like the  soft taco shell in the mixture.  My husband and son requested that I just make the beef mixture and leave out the taco shell.  They suggested I just make burritos.  I will also cut up vegetables on the side to put in the burrito.

"It's good." That's what my friend said after taking a bite of this quick and easy skillet supper. Substituted the beef with Johnsonville Hot Sausage. Garnished with sour cream, avocado and tomato. Really flavorful. I might sautee the tortilla pieces to make them crispy before adding them to the tomato/meat mixture. If you're hungry for Mexican food, save time and money and make this dish at home. Ole!

There was nothing special about this recipe. It was kind of bland even after I added taco seasoning to the meat. I would probably just make beef tacos next time.

Was a hit here. Would definitely use taco seasoning on meat next time to boost flavor. Also, used ground turkey instead of ground beef.

We make this all the time and love it. I think you need to know in advance that the tortillas are SUPPOSED to get soggy, kind of like dumplings. That being said, it is delicious, quick, and easy. Gourmet? Nah. Good, quick, weeknight cooking? Yes.

I really liked this recipe. It was very easy to make. The tortillas are better freshly put in. They do alright reheated, but not quite as good. I highly recommend making this!

I really needed more body to it so I added all sorts of things, taking advice from many of the previous comments. I added chili beans (black or kidney beans would have worked as well), salsa, diced tomatoes, taco seasoning, and a few other assorted mexican staples. Turned out great, and I just had to add a little water upon reheating to create that soupy consistency. Turned out a lot like taco soup in the end, topped it with sour cream and mozzarella and ate it with tortilla chips.

So far it's a 3 star for me. It just didn't seem like it was complete, and though it tasted really good the soggy flour tortillas ruined it. My family and I would not want it again, as is. But with some personal touches (I'm thinking making it into a rice dish with sour cream and tortilla chips as a garnish) I would give this another try.

We liked this a lot. Fast and easy. Plan to spice it up next time, perhaps with chilis, black olives and onions. We actually liked the cooked tortillas, they did get soft but more noodly than gummy. Though as I think about it now, I used low carb/high fiber tortillas. Could be the difference.

this is the same recipe at the Chicken Tortilla Bake on here. except it uses milk instead of water. My family likes the milk addition instead of water because it makes it a bit more creamy and the cheese can melt into it better making a cheesier sauce.  Idk whether i should say campbels knocked this off of someone else or if i should think someone else knocked it off of campbels....

This is a great dip but you need to add the following: 1 package taco seasoning, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1 cup mexican blend cheese .  Serve it as a dip with tostitos scoops.  This makes the perfect dip.

Great recipe, I needed some thing simple yet tasty to take to work and feed my crew. I made some additions and adjustments. I used 2lbs. of ground turkey. I added black beans, taco seasoning, 1 onion, chilis verdes, corn and sour cream. I also added a 1/2 cup more of shredded cheese and 1 jar of mild salsa. I'm not into gummy chips, so I left those out and provided them when meal was served. I also took shredded hearts of romaine, guacamole and sour cream as toppers. Everyone loved it!

I agree with some of the people here who didn't like this. Turn this into a casserole instead and use tortillia chips, taco seasoning for the browning of the meat, and everything else is fine. Bake in a 350 degree oven until tortilla chips start to wilt, then cover with cheese and bake an additional five minutes, all done.

One of my fave easy super fast family dishes.  I usually add a bunch of chopped veggies (think peppers/zucchini) to add bulk & nutrition.

Delish!

This was a fast easy meal to put together on a weeknight. I used tostadas that I broke up for this instead of flour tortillas and mexican blend cheese. I seasoned the beef with some onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder, and crushed red pepper because I only had half the salsa. Because I'm a tweaker and have to add my own touch I used chicken broth in stead of water. (and it was in the fridge needing to be used up) We enjoyed this. I would fix this again.

I made this as is, except that I stopped at about 3/4 the tortillas because I felt like they were going to take over the skillet any second.  I think about half would do.  They did give it an odd texture - not soggy and not bad really, but a little odd.  Pretty decent stuff overall and reasonably easy, but I agree that it could use something.  Useful for a busy during-the-week meal.

Good dish, but I didn't care for the tortillas in the skillet.  They got too soggy.  I preferred to use tortilla chips to scoop it up.

i thought it was good. i expected a more "taco" taste though. next time i will try to use tortilla chips because that sounds like it would be better than mushy soft taco shells

Good recipe.  I added onions, garlic, cummin, and chili powder to spice it up.  Also added black beans to increase nutrition and used whole wheat tortillas, they hold up better.  Corn tortillas work great as well if you don't like mushy tortillas.  The kids love this recipe and it is fast.

Was a good base recipe. I added cumin, chili powder and garlic to season it up a bit. I read the other reviews too late about the tortillas mushing up, and sure enough that is what happened. Would be good as others have suggested to use corn tortilla chips instead.

This was not good. Maybe because of too much tomato soup? I doubt I'll make again.

I made this with taco seasoning instead of salsa, pasta, and hard taco shells.  If I make this again, I will put the shells in last because they got sort of mushy and I would've preferred some crunch in the meal.  My family members gave it a very mixed review so that's why I rated it a 3 (My mom said I should give it a five, my sister said 2).

This was a good basic recipe but a few changes are essential.   Mexican food should never be bland and without some spices this recipe will be very bland.    I added a package of hot and spicy taco seasoning mix.   I also added about 1 tablespoon of chopped up jalapeno peppers.   For my wife and I that was just right.   Instead of tortillas I used the original Fritos corn chips.   I did not add them to the mix.   I spread them out on the plate and spooned the mix over them.   They stayed crisp and tasted great.    With these changes it was a great dish for Cinco de Mayo.

So simple yet tasty with only a few ingredients. I made this as written but I think black beans and corn would work well in this. Great for a busy night! Thanks for the post.

The tortillas really make this yummy, so don't skip them for fear they'll become soggy, just stir them in right before you serve.

very good base recipe, but would have been very bland without adding taco seasoning. Use "Taco Seasoning I" from Bill Echols on this website (so good!). Also added half can of corn and half can of black beans. topped with sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips. Very tasty. I ate with with a fork, my husband scooped it with tortilla chips. Good either way. Will make again.

Not a bad recipe, but it needed a lot of doctoring.  I made it exactly as written, and it was incredibly easy.  That's the good part.  Unfortunately, it is also incredibly BLAND.  I ended up adding some taco seasoning and a can of seasoned beans which made it much better.  It's also too sweet because of the tomato soup.  I'm not sure how to fix this - I like the texture the soup gives it, but don't want it so sweet.  I'll probably make this again, but will experiment with browning my meat with taco seasoning and using one can of soup and a can of tomato puree or something like that.  Maybe a spicier salsa would help, too.

Wow, very good by itself and a great platform to build on. I put crushed tostadas on top. Next time I might use 1/2 corn tortillas and 1/2 flour tortilla and more salsa.

This is an okay base. But I had to add a lot to it, then it tasted great. First off I had 2lb of ground beef. I put one can of black beans, one can of creamed corn, two cups of salsa, 1tsp of crushed red pepper, & half cup of tomato soup. (no water since there was extra liquid)Also while cooking the meat I used minced garlic, dried onions, and cummin. Once meat was cooked i added everything to it and I let is boil for about 10 minutes, let it sit for about 10 mins. Then I made tacos from it with cheese and lettuce. It was good. I think next time I'd leave out the soup since i like the salsa instead for more of a kick.

Good basic recipe. My husband said it was delicious. I used low-fat/low-sodium soup, 3 whole wheat tortillas, 1/4 cup lite sour cream, 1/4 cup fat free plain yogurt, and added a small can of drained sliced olives. I sprinkled the cheese on after 5 minutes of cooking and then cooked 5 more minutes to let the cheese melt on top. Quick and easy. I'll be making it again.

It's such an easy recipe, and you can't really mess it up. I use corn tortillas and throw them in at the end, like 3 minutes before it goes on the plate. I was surprised that they don't just disolve and the skillet is all soupy. Kinda like a noodle. I make it all the time.

I made it dairy-free (no cheese), added half of a taco seasoning packet and it was really good! We topped it with freshly sliced lettuce to round it out and it was perfect.

This is kind of like a casserole - the wet tortillas ended up having a consistency similar to thick lasagna noodles. I may not add quite as much water next time - this came out just a bit soupy. Also, I think the recipe is very flexible. I think you could cook red/green/jalapeno peppers with the meat if you wanted, or add corn. Anyways, I will definitely make this again - pretty easy and quick!

This was an awesome dish and very easy. I added taco seasoning, garlic powder and cumin for more flavor. I also did not use tortilla shells, we took tortilla chips and scooped it up.

The main problem I have with this recipe was the flour tortillas. Made the dish a big gummy mess. Maybe this recipe would be better with tortilla chips, instead.

this was so delicious! Boyfriend approved. I did read a couple of other reviews and changed just a few things. I used some taco seasoning and instead of using tortillas i used tortilla chips. It was more like a dip but still really good!

Pretty tasty. I used medium taco sauce instead of salsa and it turned out quite well. Also, I added some minced onions, garlic powder, black pepper, and salt while browning the meat. I saved the cheese for my family to put on as much or little as they wanted. Will most likely make this dish again.

My family loved it.  I made a double batch last night so we'd have enough to take to lunch today, but it was wiped out at dinnertime.  It's definitely something I'll make again.

We added enchilada sauce and taco seasoning (good thing too because it would have been very bland without), but we are looking for a substitute for the tomato soup because it almost tastes too sweet.

I loved the soggy tortillas.  I added Black beans, taco seasoning, and the original cholula hot sauce made it with a medium salsa and it had a nice kick.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I did as many others did and added a package of taco seasoning to the mixture and it was perfect! Even though I had to tweek the original recipe, I'm still giving it 5 stars because it was super, super easy to fix. On the table in less than 30 minutes and delicious. You can't beat that!!!

I gave this recipe a 5 star rating because it is easy and tastes good. I had all ingrediants on hand. I did not use tortillas for fear that they would be gummy, so I used tortilla chips,sour cream and cheese. Yummy! It is kinda like chili meets taco salad. Very good, will make again.

My husband made this for us, as written, and we thought it was quite good.  We are new to fixing Mexican dishes and are happy with our success with this.  We know there are many ways we can change the recipe and still have it be good.

I took the suggestions on the site...I am rating this based on my doctored product: I added 1/2 pkt taco seasoning, 1/3 c sour cream; black beans but chili beans would be good too. It really was tasty w/ the added taco seasoning. I did the tortillas and cheese separately.

Very good recipe for an easy and fast dinner.  Used hot salsa and added tortilla strips at the end per other reviews.  Will make again.

Wow - this was great!  I, too, added mexican seasonings, corn and black beans - otherwise made as directed.  My kids inhaled it!  The tortillas ended up tasting like dumplings, which we like, so no problem there.  We also topped with a few crushed chips and sour cream.   Might try making this with chicken next time - overall a terrific, super fast dinner - will make this often!

Quick, easy and tasty! I changed up the recipe a bit and used tomato bisque rather than tomato soup. It gave it a thicker, creamy texture.

This was okay. Not five stars. I followed another reviewer and subbed chili for the tomato soup and omitted the tortillas. The result was a yummy, beefy chili. I might use this recipe to make chili next time but a skillet supper it was not. Thanks.

I used this recipe as a base and "hooked it up" from there. I seasoned the meat with Taco seasoning,hot sauce and sour cream and used elbow macaroni WITH tortilla strips, but it really seemed to please everyone in my family.  More than anything, this recipe it VERY quick and was done within 45 minutes start to finish. Yay!

I've been making this recipe for years.  My family really enjoys it.   It can easily be spiced up by adding a hotter salsa or you could add taco seasoning to the meat.  I always add a chopped onion while browning my beef.

Recipe was ok. I doubled it and also added chopped tomato and onion, and added a pack of taco seasoning for a little zing. The flour tortillas did tend to get very soggy. I think the next time I make this, I will leave out the condensed soup, add some chili beans for bulk, quickly brown the tortillas and add them at the very last.

Yum! Very easy and tasty, my children loved it. I did make it with the sour cream. Also Macaroni instead of tortillas. 1 cup water to help cook the mac. You can certainly add veggies etc, tastes great! Did I say easy? Yep, great for last minute dinner all ingredients on hand. :-)

I gave this a 4 because it was a good dish,not spectacular but a good dish to make. I used beef broth in place of the water and I added garlic,salt and pepper,cumin and that was all.  My only advice is don't put sour cream and garacumole on top, it really takes away from tasting the dish itself.

One of my favorite casserole dinners. I prefer corn tortillas over flour and add more cheese than the recipe calls for. It is easy to tweak to your preferred taste.

This is one of the  standard recipes in my household that I can't kill. I've given it to friends too, and some substitutions we've made when we really want this is a can of chili with meat or refried beans in place of the ground beef, tortilla chips in place of the tortillas, added textured vegetable protein or onions to the ground beef...basically it's a great base for anything as long as it goes with the flavor of the tomato soup. You do have to be willing though to eat very soft tortillas, and chips are even softer but they blend great!

As a user recommended, I used corn tortillas, and they held up pretty well. This is just ok, very bland. I added chili powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper, and it still mostly tastes like pre-made enchilada sauce.

Very good! I made it real spicy by using hot taco seasoning in the meat and hot pace picante. Unfortunately it was too spicy for my son so next time I won't spice it up. I also fried the tortilla strips in oil for a few minutes to give it some cruch.

This is pretty dang good!  And very easy. I used a fresh salsa, added warmed-frozen corn, and chopped black olives to ours and it was really good. My husband also added a sprinkle of garlic salt to his and said it was perfect. We didn't even have enough left over for an entire serving today.

Fantastic! Couldn't stop eating it! Very, very tasty! The only change I made to the recipe was to sprinkle the beef with about a quarter of a package of taco seasoning mix while it was browning. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Definitely a keeper. Can't wait to make it again.

This is an excellent, quick and filling dish and perfect for when your pantry is a bit bare.  I had everything on hand and everyone loved it.  I made some changes:  I added a small onion and minced garlic while the meat was browning; I seasoned the meat with cumin, chili powder, garlic salt and pepper, and I only used 3/4 can of tomato soup.  My family loved it...even my finicky 2 year old twins!

This is a FABULOUS, cheap, easy, no-fail meal!  I've made it several times (actually got the recipe from a magazine)and it is ALWAYS a hit with the fam.  This Summer we even made it at our family campout because it only requires a single large skillet.  Again, it was a hit.  After adding the cheese, I usually cover with a lid for 3-5 mins to allow cheese to melt nicely.
