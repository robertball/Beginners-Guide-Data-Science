Just had a piece of this pie - it's delicious! Be warned the filling appears too thin when poured in the pie shell (I used Keebler's premade graham crust)but it sets perfectly overnight. A very nice, light pudding-like taste. Thanks for the recipe!

This pie is fantastic! I misread the recipe and instead of using grated chocolate I used chocolate chips which of course sunk through the marshmellow mixture and out of sight! However, once the pie had set and been covered with broken oreos instead of graham crackers it looked fine. It was most fun as people cut into it and discovered all the chocolate chips at the bottom! I would recommend doing this for children as they loved trying to find them all! ha ha. A happy mistake with a great recipe, thank you.

My mother use to make a pie like this, it was called Icebox pie,I always loved it and so does my family. for years I lost the recipe and made my own version of it. before I used 40 marshmallows and and a tsp of vanilla and a beaten egg added to the mixture. I also used a premade graham crust.  I made this one as it is and its delisious too. A rich and delicious pie. I think it fools you because it doesnt really taste like marshmalllows..it taste GREAT!!!!!!

This pie was easy.  We don't have Graham crackers here in Aussie but I just happened to have some from a USA outlet.  But any pie base made of sweet biscuits could be used for this too.  For the Aussies too I used all the white marshmallows out of 2 Pascalls marshmallow packets.  Was about 40 of them.  Worked out great though.  (now I have to eat all the pink ones!) Really yummy.  The guests enjoyed it too - thank goodness, as they were taste testers as well!  Made a decent sized pie in the springform tin.  We have leftovers!

I love this pie! So easy to make & so impressive. Men really love this one, I've found. In Australia, we only have a few brands of marshmallows & they're always mixed pink & white in the packet, so I make 1 pink & 1 white pie -both look great. One of my favourite recipes ever!

This pie is very light and refreshing. What is more, for us in Europe, it's an unusual one. I did not count the marshmallows, but used 7.5 oz, and made a pastry instead of a graham cracker crust. Thanks to the Beatles for speaking about marshmallow pies in "Lucy In The Sky..", for I wouldn't have known such a pie could exist. Thanks for the recipe, Nancy.

This pie is absolutely delicious. It does seem a bit thin when poured in, but after being refrigerated for a few hours comes out with two layers of goodness. Tastes good with or without chocolate.

This tasted like creamy chocolate marshmallows, but very good.  I used chocolate chips but ran them through the food processor.  I think this would be good with about 1 1/2 ounces of white chocolate peppermint Hershey's kisses instead of the chocolate.

(2 1/2 stars) Oh gosh! I so wanted to like this. I had problems with the directions. It doesn't tell you for instance, if you should WHIP the whipping cream or not. But I assumed that you do since it said to FOLD into the marshmallow mixture. Also, the crust directions are a little vague. I wondered if 16 graham crackers was referring to 16 whole or 16 halves of the whole cracker. I followed the recipe for Graham Cracker Crust I. After making that, which used 1 sleeve of crackers, I can say that 16 graham crackers refers to 8 whole crackers, 16 halves. If I had put 16 whole crackers in (2 sleeves) it would have been all crust! Besides all of that, I finally had a slice this morning and was under whelmed in a big way. :-( This is edible, but I won't be making again. Sorry!

My in laws were visiting and my father in law mentioned this pie and how it was a secret family recipe. So of course, I looked and found it on here and made it for him :) He was very happy and said that it tasted exactly the same as when his sister makes it. It was super easy to make too!

Everyone loved it! I used chocolate chips to grate them in the mixture, and got tired of grating after a while so I put a handful on top with the cracker  crumbs which looked pretty. It would be good with chocolate syrup drizzled on top too.

I have a handwritten recipe from a friend's mother - she made a couple of changes.  15 whole graham crackers (not 16) - not a big deal.  11/2 cups of whipped cream (because every chance to have more whipped cream is a good thing).  And, double the chocolate.  Now it's perfect.  Richer than rat poison though.  Made it yesterday for Easter and the crowd went wild!

I've been making this pie for years. Whenever I share this pie with others I am always asked for the recipe.  I love that it's chocolatey and light.

Sorry, just not our thing.  Just tasted super sweet.   I know its Marshmallow Pie and not Smores Pie, but would have been better with more chocolate in my opinion.

I accidentally misread and used a half cup of milk but it still turned out just fine. Super delicious! 

I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and a half cup of powdered sugar to the cream before whipping it because I'm pregnant with a massive sweet tooth. :)

I also may or may not have added double the grated chocolate

When I was a kid, my mother would make this with only 2 small changes.  Instead of grating the chocolate, she would melt 1 square with the marshmallows.  And, along with the whipped cream, she added chopped walnuts (because she put nuts in everything)!  This can be made ahead of time as it freezes well (and thaws quickly).  It's a quick, light, fluffy dessert - perfect for kids.
