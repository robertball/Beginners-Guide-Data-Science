What gives this recipe its distinction from other zucchini bread recipes is, indeed,  its "spiciness" - it includes  three different spices, not just the typical  cinnamon.  I generally (not always) see this combination of spices in pumpkin bread; not so much in zucchini bread.  It was  pleasantly spiced - nice, not overkill at all.   As for sweetness it has an appropriate level - not as sweet as some, yet sweeter than some others, therefore, this one should do a fairly good job at generally pleasing the palate.  I bowed out of the optional nuts but did add the raisins, a nice addition with the "fall-ish" spices.  I followed the recipe just as it directs, but for my needs a loaf wasn't practical; I baked a half recipe that produced  ten  nicely shaped and domed plump muffins - 350 degrees, about 25 minutes.  Happy to be the first reviewer and give this two thumbs up.

Delicious!  We did add a little extra vanilla.  We didn't have 2 loaf pans so we baked 1/2 the mix in a loaf pan and made muffins out of the other 1/2.  We baked the muffins for about 20 minutes and they were perfectly moist and look just like the picture.

This is a very tasty zucchini recipe.  I altered a couple of things:  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and one cup of white and I replaced 1/2 of the oil with applesauce.  I used only the raisins and no nuts.  I got 24 muffins out of it which I needed to bake for 26-30 mins.

This bread is super moist and yummy.  I did cranberries and mini-chocolate chips instead of raisins and walnuts since I am allergic to the nuts and my kids don't like raisins.  I also used about half the sugar because it isn't needed.   But here is a secret I want to share:  If you don't want your bread to be skinny on the sides and pointed on top as some have had trouble with, don't grease the sides of your pan, just the bottom.  This allows the batter to stick better to the sides and rise up along with the middle.  When you take the bread out of the oven put the timer on for 10 minutes to let the bread settle a bit.  Then run a knife around the sides and remove the bread to a cooling rack while it is still warm.  This is the secret to keeping it from sticking to the pan.  Hope you enjoy this recipe!

I thought this was excellent even though I am picky about my zucchini bread, not too sweet but hearty, warm and treating. I think I am going to add some brown sugar next time though.

These are very good. I used pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have any ground cloves and I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and substituted 2/3 cup of coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  Used muffin pans and cooked for about 25 minutes as someone else suggested.  I will be making these again.

Pretty nice, rich taste. Also baked as muffins for 25 min. I used half AP flour and half WW flour. They have a brown color which is perfect for this spiced treat :)

Great bread recipe.  Baked well and it was exactly the spiciness I was looking for in a zucchini bread.  I made this recipe times 6 and it used up two big baseball size zucchinis (which I peeled and seeded, then shredded).  My kids loved it, so it is now my new keeper (make lots for the freezer) recipe!

Mom's Spiced Zucchini Bread Haiku: "This was a nice bread! Spice was a bit overkill. Still I'm glad I made." I know the additional spices are really what set this apart from countless other zucchini bread recipes, but the cloves were just too much in my opinion. I made the bread as directed, not using the optional walnuts nor raisins, but instead tossing in about 1/2 c. mini chocolate chips. Unfortunately 50 min. was too long for my 2 loaves; maybe my oven was feeling more hot than usual or maybe I should've started checking the bread sooner, but my loaves turned out really dry and I've had to slather them in butter to make up for it. If I make this recipe again, I'll drop the cloves entirely and either bake for a shorter time, or make them into muffins instead as many people suggested in their reviews.

I made this out of desperation  after my zucchini went Jurassic in my garden. This came out nicely. it was easy to make and had a great flavor. I went with the base recipe to start, no raisins or nuts, but I think apples or bananas would be just as tasty. I will be making this again as I still have 20 cups of shredded zucchini left.

Made it exactly as written without nuts or raisins. Family loved It!  Took a loaf to a coffee house and it was a hit. Really tasty with cream cheese or freshly  whipped cream.  Even better the next day after spices mixed! I did have to bake it about 12 minutes longer, which could be my zuke was juicy or my oven is a little off. I didn't wait for a toothpick to be completely dry. Wonderful recipe!

Nice flavor and didn't turn crispy on the edges while I was waiting for the middle to cook.  Made 24 muffins with one batch and 2 loaves of bread with the second batch both turned out great!

This is nice, moist zucchini bread with great texture.  The spices were an ideal blend that worked for us.  I didn’t/wouldn’t make any adjustments.

So moist and tasty. I substituted Stevia in the Raw for the 2c. of sugar, added extra zucchini (as we live in a high altitude area and must add extra moisture to any bake good) and there was no difference in taste. Hubby was a very happy man as he had requested Zucchini Bread for Christmas.

I love this recipe and my husband loves it too! I was worried because I used chopped zucchini that had been blanched and frozen, but it turned out fine. Nice crust on the top and edges, but moist and tender inside. This is a keeper!

Super delicious,  though it did get thicker as it sat to go into the pans. We doubled the batch, 5 mini loafs and 2 regulars. Prepared the pans with ample butter and the bread crust was amazing.  I did add 10 minutes cook time for higher elevation and used frozen zucchini thawed and excess moisture pressed out.

Love this recipe! I am a huge fan of the spices in this bread and have made it many times, with only one real change - I replace half the oil with milk. Usually when I make this, I bake half into a loaf and make mini muffins out of the rest.  I have also used this recipe with apples instead of zucchini - the spices don't need any adjusting. Delicious!

I made it exactly as written and mine was just a little dry.  I'll try it again and maybe add a little more zucchini and a few chocolate chips.

Made this today for the first time and it's really good.  I love the spices.  As I normally do when making something for the first time, I use a bit less of the spices than called for so I can alter later more or less.  I made one loaf of the bread splitting sugar and brown sugar as others recommended and for the rest of the batter I made muffins and added a handful of chocolate chips.  The bread was delicious but the chips in the muffins made them a bit too sweet.  I will skip them next time.  Will definitely make again and I'm sure these will be all gone in a couple of days.  My hubby loves both the bread and muffins!  Thanks AR!

3rd time - still great. Used frozen shredded zuchini's this time, and it was too moist, falling apart. I do however, use less flour than stated, I only use 2.5 cups due to using self rising flour. so... if you use self rising flour, may want to use the full 3 cups of flour if the shredded zuc's have been frozen. Everyone still loving it, and I am being asked by extended family members to make it for them. This recipe is forgiving, you can skimp or double this or that, still great.

I made this with almond flour to reduce the carbs, a cup of Splenda and 1/2 cup of sugar. It was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was so doughy it looked and felt like Play-dough, I couldn't add the zucchini it. I threw it out and went with a different recipe.  I was very disappointed.

Turned out wonderfully.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup since I added some chopped cherries.  They were moist, light and just sweet enough.

I have made this cake (rather than bread) a few time and everyone loves it. I cut the sugar in half(or less) added to the amount of walnut and raisins, reduced the amount of cloves (too potent and caused alergy for me) and added some cardamom. The reisins give some sweetness off after day one so the amount of sugar can be drastically reduced and yet the cake will be yummy (and healthier). I also tried this with 3/4 cup oil and replaced the white sugar with brown one. I use as many organic ingridients as I can. The result is very satisfactory and we all keep craving this cake again and again.
Couple tips: sift or spoon the flour for more airy result. Use parchment paper and you don't even need to clean the pans much. :)

This recipe tastes the way I remember my Grandmother's recipe tasting. I added toasted, chopped pecans instead of walnuts (I'm allergic), but that's the only change I made.  I baked 10 loaves and a dozen muffins-some to freeze and some to share. My husband says it's the best I've ever made.  Awesome recipe.

I made this as opposed to Mom's Favorite Zucchini Bread (also excellent).  I like this one better because of the additional spices used.

This recipe was exactly like the one my mom used to make - so good! I cut the recipe down to 12 servings as I only had a small zucchini and 2 small loaf pans - otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. It will be my go to (non-chocolate) zucchini bread recipe! Thank you for sharing.

These loaves came out great; the taste was nice. I left one loaf plain and added pecans to the other instead of walnuts. I also took some of the pecans, which were chopped fine, added just a little soft butter and a big tablespoon of brown sugar and put this mixture over the bread. Very good. It's always so hard to wait for quick bread loaves to cool, especially when they smell as good as these did!

This a wonderful recipe! We had large zucchini from our garden and I wasn't sure what to do.  I followed the recipe as directed except I didn't have ground cloves.  I took a few whole cloves and mashed them in a Baggie.  I actually made them into muffins (cupcakes to my kids).   I baked them for 20 minutes.  They were delicious!
