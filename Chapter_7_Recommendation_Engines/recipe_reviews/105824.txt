I used unsalted butter and plain bread crumbs as well as skip the additional salt and came upon a beautiful finished product...even though my picture is a bit lacking. We served this for brunch with Crockpot Scrambled Eggs assorted breakfast meats and fruit salad etc... Thanks Jessica for sharing your Mom's recipe it was a nice addition to our table.

wanted to love it...followed the recipe as is- tasted like a salt lick with a side of potatoes.
