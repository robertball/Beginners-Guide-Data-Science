This is awesome - we used this on our salad (baby mixed greens and arugula) the past two nights (with pear slices the first night and avocado the second), and my husband is still raving about it!  Having read the reviews first, I used equal parts of balsamic and maple syrup, and a little bit less olive oil(proportionately), but kept the mustard (dijon, because that's what we like best), pepper, and a pinch of the salt.  I used my mini-food processer to blend everything together, and it has stayed emulsified (yet not thickened, like mayo); don't know if the processer is what did the trick, but the dressing sticks to the greens, rather than sinking to the bottom of the bowl.  Thanks for a great recipe!  This will be wonderful with winter salads (sugared nuts, goat cheese) ... yum!

This Maple Vinaigrette is exactly what I was looking for. A couple of suggestions I would make is to cut the vinaigrette amount down. Plan on at least 1/2 a cup then begin adding to taste. And, DO use REAL Maple Syrup. And I prefer a thick honey mustard (the ones in a jar) over a thinner mustard but that is just my preference. We added Pears, Blue Cheese, Walnuts, and fresh mixed greens. This dressing is the star of a great fall winter salad! This would be good with Apples, goat cheese, pine nuts etc... Great with any fall fruits.

This was great!  I think it tastes like an expensive restaurant's dressing.  It would be great with a goat cheese, walnut, cranberries and mixed green salad.  I didn't take out the blender, I just whisked it to combine.  I also added a tablespoon or so of mayo to give it gloss.

Very good - I cut the recipe in half and used REAL maple syrup. Be sure to use a good quality balsamic to ensure good results.

This has become my salad dressing of choice, though I must say it is perfect for my spinach salad, which we eat more than once a week. When using it on the spinach salad I had a couple pinches (or more) of bacon pieces (bottled kind) and then heat he dressing in the microwave for a few seconds.  The only change I make to the original dressing is to add a tad less maple syrup.  As a few other readers have said 'using a good balsamic' makes quite a difference.  This is without a doubt the best all around salad dressing recipe I have.

This is very good.  I threw together a salad of spinach, shallots, craisins and almonds and was looking for a nice vinaigrette to whip up with ingredients I had on hand.  This one fit the bill!  My only complaint is that it wasn't zippy enough for me, so I added more vinegar.  One thing that I should note is that you MUST use pure maple syrup, not the pancake stuff.

I needed a quick salad dressing to take to a barbeque to dress greens. I had made something similar, so tried this recipe and it was a good choice as it was the hit of the gathering. I added dried cranberries and sunflower seeds to the greens, and the salad was great. I made the recipe as directed, just calculated for 4 servings.

Delicious! Didn't need to change a thing (I didn't use any salt & pepper, didn't feel it needed it, but it would have been fine with a little added if someone wanted it). Used it on a salad of mixed greens with red peppers, green onion, craisins, walnuts, and chicken. With a side of Italian bread, it was a perfect dinner!

Great dressing - I especially like it on salads with spinach and fruit, but it's good on any salad!  This time around I added 1 small chopped shallot (about 2 Tbsp) and replaced half the mustard with horseradish for a little extra kick, and it was delicious!

This was a wonderful salad dressing, and one that I will definitely be making again with the tweaks suggested by other reviewers, (i.e. added one clove of garlic, and a little less olive oil).  Next time I think I will add more syrup and less vinegar.

This is fantastic poured over a salad of mixed greens, cranberries, walnuts, and feta cheese.  I used 100% pure maple syrup and used a whisk rather than a blender (one less thing to clean).  Thank you for the recipe :)

GREAT dressing! This came together quickly--decided to use this rather than a bottled cranberry walnut vinaigrette... glad I did! Tasted awesome with arugula, chopped pecans, cranberries, sliced apple, and a bit of parm cheese. Wonderful blend of flavors - I recommend mixing lettuce and ingredients to coat and then serving onto plates... much better results.

Nice.  Different, a little sweeter than the dressings I generally lean toward.  This lends itself very well  to salads that include fruit and/or nuts along with a tangy cheese.  I used Romaine, thinly sliced cucumbers, toasted chopped hazelnuts, dried cherries and crumbled Gorgonzola.

This tasted too oily to me as written and the oil drowned out the other flavors. I added more mustard which thickened it up and gave it more flavor.

11/20/2009: I used good quality ingredients and pure maple syrup.  I did reduce the oil to 1/2 cup as it is way too much oil.  I used 1/4 t. kosher salt and 1/4 t. black pepper.  It really doesn't taste good with maple syrup--it has an "off" taste.  With honey, it's easily 5 stars! 1/19/2020 still making this with honey, 1/2 cup evoo, adding 1 T. Cider vinegar for a kick. 5 stars with honey!

FINALLY,  a salad dressing recipe keeper.  I'm constantly on the look out for a great salad dressing recipe and this is a great one.  Great blend of flavors. I'm using it on my NJ homegrown: kale, spinach, arugula, peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers. I added feta cheese, pecans and dried cherries.  DELISH!  Thanks again!

I love this recipe! I've used it dozens of times as both a dressing and a marinade. Yes, it's very balsamic-y, but balsamic vinegar naturally has a very pungent, robust favor. I love this about balsamic vinegar, though--and this is an ideal recipe if you're a balsamic fan.

This tasted like pancake syrup with vinegar added. I should have taken the advice of another reviewer and added honey. I usually make red wine vinaigrette but was out of red wine vinegar. I'll never run out of it again.

This is a wicked good salad dressing! It has the perfect amount of tanginess and sweetness. It's really versatile, too - I've used it on a strawberry spinach salad and a plan vegetable salad and it was great with both of them. I'll be making this one regularly.

Wow!  This one's really good!  I used real maple syrup and canola oil instead of olive oil.  I just whisked it in a bowl and then shook it up in a jar to finish emulsifying.  We won't hesitate to make this one again!!

Very Good and a very nice change.  We really enjoyed the flavor.  Great with a salad with some kind of roasted nuts in it.  Thanks for sharing!

I will definitely make this again ! Simple and delicious!  Made it exactly with the ingredients  given. My salad included Mixed greens although I wanted to do just spinach but both taste good sliced apples sliced hard-boiled egg chicken red onion sesame seeds cranberries with Maple Dijon dressing.  If I had goat cheese I would have put it on as well !

Excellent dressing and so easy to make. I used a good quality light-colored balsamic vinegar, Boars Head grainy dijon mustard, real maple syrup (not pancake syrup), and EVOO. I did use my blender to emulsify the oil into the vinegar mixture. Dressed a salad made with baby spinach, poached pear slices, toasted pecans, blue cheese crumbles, dried cranberries, and onion straws. A+++

Loved it.  I used real maple syrup.  I am wondering if the negative reviews were by people who substituted the real thing for the high fructose fake .  Use the real deal!

I had Maple Balsamic dressing at an upscaled restraunt last week and loved it. I found this recipe and gave it a try.  Wow....I was happy !!  It tasted almost like the one I had at the restraunt. The only thing I would do next time is use a little less balsamic vinegar.

Didn't really measure anything, just did it to taste and it was fabulous!  Used much less olive oil than called for.  Served on a salad made from the last greens of the season, dried blueberries and cranberries, sunflower seeds, and an apple from the tree!

Love the hint of maple in this balsamic salad dressing. Enough to flavor, but not overpower.  I only made a half batch because i wanted it for just a few salads.  I refrigerated the leftovers, but it turned very thick.  When I let it come to room temp the consistency was pourable.  After that I did not put back in the fridge and the dressing was fine.  Thanks stefychefy for sharing your recipe.

Wow, so easy and tasty!  I made a quick salad with romaine, strawberries and toasted pecans (cleaning out the fridge) and this vinaigrette was perfect.  Fast and easy.  I mix it in a little Mason jar and shake it up.

Great dressing. I only made 2 servings, but used a full tsp. of Dijon mustard. I like the idea of subbing some of the mustard for horseradish for more kick that some reviewers mentioned.

So very good. I have also made it replacing the maple syrup with honey and adding two cloves of garlic. So versatile, simple, and so much better than anything store bought.

I love this dressing for a number of reasons. I cannot tolerate most store bought dressings due to chemicals.  Secondly it's easy, and most of all, it tastes good on almost any salad.  I use it on most green salads, especially ones that I put blueberries, craisins, or strawberries in. This has been a hit for a number of years at our home.

Loved this recipe.  I adjusted the recipe a bit because I use it sparingly - I used a 1:1:2 ratio for the maple syrup, balsamic vinegar and oil respectively.  Used this on my fav salad with greens, goat cheese and dates.  Perfection!

I made this again last evening.  However, I made a mistake in that I added 2 Tbsps versus 2 Tsps of Dijon mustard.  I am glad I did so as it gave it a bit more depth of flavour.  As Michael Smith would say, "A recipe is just a guide".

I tend to lean toward creamy dressings.. Ranch to be exact.. Lol I am not a big fan of vinaigrette because they are usually too tangy.. So if I am make them I am always putting a ton of honey...  But this Receipe is AMAZING... I will never make another dressing. This will always be my go to..

My son, who does not normally like Balsamic dressing, really liked this.

I followed the recipe and then adjusted and added a bit more Dijon. I omitted the salt but did use black pepper. I added crumbled bacon to the dressing. I made a spinach salad with toasted almonds, cranberries and sunflower seeds. I used large pink, grilled shrimp with a touch of garlic on top of the spinach salad and it was great! Thanks for the awesome vinegrette!

This is good! After reading some of the quantity comments,  I used only 1/3 cup of apple cider vinegar and also reduced the olive oil to 3/4 cup.  I added 3 T orange juice which really brought out more flavor in comparison.  I made a gallon for a fund-raising event and had several requests for the recipe.  It was tossed with broccoli florets, toasted sunflower seeds, finely chopped carrots, chopped bacon, and dried cherries.

The oil/vinegar ratio was off for my tastes too much oil and I only used 3/4 cup of oil. I also felt like it was too sweet. I added another teaspoon of mustard and a tablespoon of mayo whisked in to help it stay blended for longer and to tone down the sweetness. That help a lot. I served it with a salad of butter lettuce, goat cheese, dried cranberries and spicy roasted pecans

Do you like a little salad with your oil???  Then this recipe is perfect for you!  I cut the oil to just about 1/2 C and also reduced the vinegar accordingly.  As written, not for us but a good starting point.

Made this to go with our Christmas starter. Tossed it in with some rocket and topped it all with A slice on Chef John's cranberry and walnut Brie wrapped in puff pastry. Delicious. Would definitely make this dressing again!

I made this exactly as written and it was amazing.  I prefer to make my own and was looking for just the right mix of ingredients...this is it!  I also like that it makes a good quantity.  Everyone raves about this dressing!

Came out very nice over our salad, a tangy taste with a little bit of natural sweetness.

I was looking for a dressing similar to the one used in Chick fil a's Kale Salad. This  recipe is better! I've made it a few times.  The 1st time it was a little to vinegary for me.  I now double the maple syrup and mustard. Delish! I make a mean kale salad and let the dressing marinate on the greens for about an hour.  I used a good quality olive oil and vinaigrette; and real maple syrup.

A perfect balsamic vinaigrette that I use almost every day. Excellent on all kinds of salads, especially spinach salads. Also extremely good on roasted vegetables, pasta and other dishes. It really enhances the flavor of beef. I haven't used it on chicken or pork yet. 

It'll get too thick to pour if you refrigerate it, so I just leave it out on the counter.  You could always add a little water to thin it if necessary.

This is simple and amazing!  I followed the recipe, but added about 1/2 tsp maple extract to help bring the maple flavor to the front of the tastes.   This worked perfectly!  I used my standard blender as my food processor was too small.   I used the dressing on a roasted butternut squash, cranberry and walnut salad- fabulous!

I did it a bit differently, made this way from Canadian Maple it is way too sweet, to get the sweet and sour effect try white vinegar and less maple and no mustard, that way you don't mask the maple flavor and the sweetness is balanced out.
125 ml white vinegar 70 ml canadian maple syrup (dark amber, grade A), 1 teaspoon salt, dash of black pepper and 250 ml extra virgin olive oil. Add syrup, salt and pepper to vinegar and whisk well till combined and salt is dissolved, gradually add oil while whisking till combined. Use on leafy and seafood salads.

It didn't have any stand-out qualities in my opinion.  

I followed the recipe faithfully and felt that it called for too much EVOO as it was very, very thick after blending.  I also used my good balsamic and I think that along with the maple syrup only made for a flat, overly sweet dressing.  I should have used the cheaper balsamic vinegar that I use for cooking in this recipe to add a bit of acid.

Great! Followed hints from reviews for dressing but for a pork chop marinade I added one large clove of garlic minced and a few shakes of Grill Mates Smokehouse Maple seasoning and pepper and it wad soo good baked, broiled or grilled! Our salad was the original recipe with chopped apples over romaine with avocado and feta ( I didnt have goat cheese )

Very good. Used it on a chopped pork tenderloin, pear, and spinach salad. It was very sweet for my taste, so when I make it again, I will probably cut the maple syrup down a bit. I used a wisk instead of a processor and it turned out just fine. Thanks for the recipe!

I have a good friend who is an amazing southern cook, Sherry, and her salad dressings are the best.  I am always trying to recreate them with no success.  This recipe is THE BEST salad dressing I have ever made and comes very close to one of Sherry's that I love. Made the recipe exactly as written except cut in half as there's just two of us.  Like another reviewer, I used real maple syrup and good quality balsamic, which obviously makes a big difference in a recipe with only 5 or so ingredients.  Will make again and again!

The balsamic is definitely a strong flavor in this dressing, and I cut it some based on reviews.  I will probably cut it a little more next time.  Otherwise, still a very tasty dressing that I will make again!

Love this recipe! Perfect amount of sweet. Something a little bit different to try. I used some... random mustard I found in our fridge that I think I bought in France... I think it would work well with just about any fancy mustard. :)

I am always looking for new salad dressings to try and this one was FABULOUS! I did cut back on the olive oil, which made it a little thinner, but the flavor was perfect for a cool sweet but tart dressing.

The balsamic vinegar was very sharp. It over powered the whole vinaigrette. I really did not care for it at all.

Tastes great! Not too sweet, not too strong.
