This is a really easy and tasty dish! I cooked the recipe for 8 servings, but only used 1 pound, not 2, of pasta. I guess the sauce would be a bit more dispersed over more pasta, but I really liked it a bit more intense. I also used wholewheat pasta instead of egg, and threw in some green onions and just a touch of Thai chili sauce. The wholewheat pasta added a nice earthiness.  The only other changes I made was to use chunky Jiff peanut butter (so killed sugar) and a couple Tablespoons more soy sauce. This will be a regular in my house!

I made this for a potluck at work and received rave reviews. I made a double batch of the recipe to serve over 20. I poached 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and shredded them, then added them to the final salad. I also added two more tablespoons of black tea to the peanut butter to cut the peanut flavor even further. This recipe works well with a peanut butter that is not sweetened. If you don't like Thai flavor combinations, this may not be for you. I love peanut sauces, and love the fact that this recipe is relatively inexpensive to make. I will absolutely be making it again.

I made this for a Halloween potluck; it was very well received. I included 1 cup of chopped green onions to garnish and balance out the cilantro flavour.

I made this a couple nights ago and noone would touch it. This was a waste of time and ingredients. I made this exactly according to the recipe.

Easy dish to make.  I cut the egg noodles to 1 lb and added 1 lb of cooked shrimp.  Perfect hot weather meal.

Good recipe!  We used regular spaghetti instead of the egg noodles - and turned out great.

I'm sure glad I had all the ingredients on hand. I'd hate to think I made a special trip to the store for these results - I followed the recipe to a tee.  It tastes like straight peanut butter.

Really great and easy!! I didn't use all the peanut butter it called for, just enough to give it the flavor.  I bought the peanut oil just for the recipe but it wouldn't have been necessary.

Great recipe.  I didn't change one thing about this recipe.  Although my husband thought it lacked meat...so I may add cold shredded chicken next time.

3 but potential to be a 4 if spiced up a bit. Also Rob would like a crunch (add peanuts).

I marked this one star, but mostly because of personal taste. I should note that I made it in advance and the reheated it. It came out curdled. The taste was weird to me, too. It was like peanut butter melted on hot noodles, which wasn't very appetizing. I guess some people like that, but it's not for me.  I used regular peanut butter and omitted the sugar. I also used whole wheat spaghetti. Only downside was that I didn't have peanut oil or rice vinegar on hand and had to buy them just for this recipe, making it a bit expensive.

I didn't like this much and I love Thai food. It is bland and the peanut flavor is overwhelming. If I were to make this again, I'd up the jalapeno and salt, as well as add some coconut milk, onion and sesame seeds.

I make cold sesame noodles all the time, in varying ways. Suggestions/variations: substitute tahini for 1/3 to 1/2 of the peanut butter. Use toasted sesame oil, not regular. I consider chopped scallions (mostly green parts, in generous amounts) an essential flavor in cold sesame noodles. Julienned Kirby cucumbers (skin on) are even better than peeled/seeded regular cukes. Julienned snowpeas (used raw when young, thin & tender, or de-stringed & lightly blanched when older & thicker) are also marvelous tossed with cold noodles. Baby arugula leaves are surprisingly good as well, though non-traditional. Even crisp shredded iceberg can add delight. For more protein: cubes of extra firm tofu or shredded chicken breast. Garnishes: sesame seeds, chopped scallions, sriracha, chili oil or chili flakes. BTW, the common supermarket brands of egg noodles come in 12-oz. bags (not 1 lb.). To use 1 of those bags, adjust the number of servings to 3 (or to 6 for 2 such bags).

Really liked this recipe.  I used it for a hot noodle dish.  The tea really seems to help keep the sauce loose - I always have trouble with peanut sauces thickening too much.  This sauce had a thin consistency, and the hot noodles soaked it right up.  I substituted peri peri for the fresh jalapeno and only had powdered ginger on hand.  I'll definitely make this recipe again.  And again.
