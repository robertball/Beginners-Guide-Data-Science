My husband is from Nawlins (New Orleans to the Northerners). He says this recipe is the REAL thing...very authentic. It really is delicious. I made one without the cayenne for our son. It also tasted great, though to my surprise, he liked the spicy one.

I like fish a lot, and this is my first try with a cajun do.  Terrific!  I goofed a little in not having the pan quite hot enf to sear -- I nearly cooked the fish in this step!  I had also changed a little by using some olive oil in the pan because fridge temperature fish dipped in melted butter just caused butter globs on the first piece, and nothing for the rest.  I sprinkled the mixed spices onto each piece with clean fingers ...tidier that way.  We had it with ratatouille and a bottle of zinfindel. Killer good!  I will do again and, after searing, just simmer in a little of the dressing instead of baking which IMO is an unnecessary, drying out step.

While this recipe does sound tasty, members should be aware that it is not the original, authentic "Blackend Redfish" that was made famous in New Orleans and around the world.

Great recipe!

I changed a few things. Used sea bass instead of redfish. Reduced cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon ginger. Didn't have lemon pepper so added extra teaspoon black pepper. Used 1/2 teaspoon of "fake" salt. Sprayed on olive oil instead of butter.

Made Good Seasons Italian dressing. Dressing called for 1/4 cup white wine vinegar. I put 3 tablespoons of raspberry blush balsamic vinegar and filled rest of 1/4 cup with balsamic vinegar. The balsamic vinegar gives is a subtle sweetness. (um, not very Cajun, but tasty!)

My wife said that, "it is a restaurant grade dish". I don't know about all of that, but it was very tasty and I appreciated her compliment!

Great recipe despite the Italian seasoning. I'm from New Orleans and blackened anything is a winner. FYI: we don't say "Nawlins". That's a northerner thing

I caught a limit of red fish last weekend and wanted a new recepe.  This was great and easy!  Not too spicy but good flavor.  My 12 year old son thought it needed a bit more spice so he added some Tony's!  If you have never blackened fish, be sure to get your pan HOT on high and put a little olive oil(butter burns quick at this heat) in the pan and sear in those seasonings until they start to turn a little black but do not burn it.

I tried this recipe for supper and my husband and I agreed it was delicious!  I was skeptical about the salad dressing, but it made a wonderful sauce. I used "lite" salad dressing, by the way. This is a recipe I will definitely make again!

Excellent taste. Make sure the skillet is esp hot to sear the fish and keep the filet firm. If you use a prepared "blackening" seasoning cut back slightly. Otherwise, enjoy it's great.

I used tilapia instead and as I couldnt find the cayenne pepper, used normal pepper instead. I didn't find it amazing but my husband loved it.

I have made this over and over again.  My husband and I love it.   I always use tilapia instead of red fish, but otherwise follow the recipe.  I don't sear the fish on high though...smoked out the house the first time and I've found medium works just fine.  Leftovers taste delicious on garlic toast!

I loved the flavor! It was pretty spicy and I wish I read the reviews about smoking up the kitchen first - it DID do that! I found there was too  much dressing - I only used about half and it was fine. We caught a lot of redfish recently and I'll definitely  use it up again this way.

This was a GREAT recipe! I'm from Louisiana and I found this dish right up my alley.  There are two things though that are very important to note.  When you first seer the fish it will send a rolling wave of cayenne filled smoke into the air.  Be prepared to open all of your doors and windows.  Second, this dish is VERY spicy as is. Too spicy in my opinion.  Next time I make this I'm going to half the cayenne pepper. It was very flavorful and we loved it.

Wonderful.  Previously frozen fillets.  I removed fillet from skin.   Dipped in the butter.  On each side sprinkled some garlic powder,  Lemon Pepper and blackened fish seasoning.  The rest like the recipe.  Served with some alfredo pasta and salad.

I found this recipe to be fantastic if you stop at the frying pan! Just add a little oil to a heavy frying pan and go ahead and cook it all right there. No need to smother the great taste of fresh caught redfish in Italian dressing! I also added 1/2 teaspoons of onion powder and cumin and a a teaspoon of crushed red pepper to the seasoning mixture.

I followed the recipe, except I made my own Italian dressing with a touch of fresh squeezed lemon.  I was worried that I would end up with soggy fish, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The fish was juicy, tender, flavorful and less  "fishy".  My family was impressed.

My husband and great aunt are very picky eaters, but we had some fresh red fish and I followed the recipe up to the point of searing the fish in the butter and then just finished pan frying the fish until it was done.  Both of them absolutely loved it and are waiting for it again.  Delicious!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It definitely filled the Cajun craving that I was having.  However, I thought the spices slightly overpowered the fish and left me wanting more fish and less spice.

LOVE.  This will be my "impress company" recipe.  It's easy and quick.  Pan seared according to size of filet and only baked for about 8-9 minutes.  We added lump crab meat on top.  Delish!

This may taste good but this is not blackening, it's just cajun seasoning. Blackening is cooking in a firey hot skillet and must either be done outdoors or under a super strong kitchen fan.

This was good if you like Lemon pepper and Italian dressing.  We don't; and we especially don't like them together.  I did not find the taste of this to be very authentic Cajun.  I liked the process and I am glad to know how to blacken something.  I can use that knowledge on other fish, chicken and so on.  Next time I will use the peppers but not the lemon pepper and will make a different sauce. I may use "herbs de provence" next time as I think a french blend would be more authentic than "italian" dressing.  I used a striped bass I caught instead of the red fish.

This was a hit for our entire group while camping. It is such a simple recipe to make and was delicious. Some of the guys were hesitant about having fish different than just fried and they soon raved about this recipe so much that I ended up making it twice on our trip! I usually need tartar sauce with fish, but this recipe had so much flavor that I ate it just the way it is!

I have made this recipe alot and I am just geeting around to the review. We used to live in Florida and had alot of local fish so I have used this recipe with red drum, which is what the recipe calls for but they are a protected fish so you can't buy them in the market. I have also used black drum,snapper, blue fish and even shark steaks. It is a great recipe because you get that great blackend flavor without all the smoke. I think I will try the chicken next!

Absolutely delicious! We tried it with boneless chicken breasts.  Pounded to tenderize, put in ziploc with italian dressing for 30 min, then dredged in the dry spices and grilled on the grill for approx. 10 min each side. Awesome flavor with just the right mild heat YUMMY!

You would do well to make this in a well ventilated kitchen.

I used Catfish instead and I enjoyed this dish served with Rice Pilaf.  However, I'm from Louisiana, and do enjoy hot and spicy food.  However, I don't believe 'blackened' is just 'hot' and to me this recipe was 'hot'.  My children could not have eaten this (which is good that I fried them some catfish instead).  My hubby liked the dish, but said the fish was too hot to 'enjoy' it.  I will make this again, however, will omit the black pepper or something b/c it's too much.

Very tasty.  Great way to have a healthier fish dish.  I used Smart Balance in place of butter.

iT IS A GOOD RECIPE BUT THE ITALIAN DRESSING IS A BIT OVER POWERING FLAVOR WISE AND THE PROBLEM I ALWAYS HAVE IS THE POISONOUS FUMES GENERATED WHEN SEARING THE FISH

Loved it!  Used a premade blackening seasoning (had to add salt because it was salt-free).  Followed the directions and used my dad's cast iron skillet for searing.  Baked the fish about 20 minutes and did some chicken the same way for the fish hater in the family.  He missed out because the fish was way better.  This was delicious and I would definitely make it again.

I made this and forgot the whole butter part.  So I just melted some butter in the pan prior to putting the fish in nd it worked out great. I don't really like fish, but this recipe will be my "go to" for fish.

Great recipe with lots of flavor.   Will reduce the cayenne next time - it was a little too spicy for most.

Made this 2 nights ago. It was my first time making redfish and this recipe came up when I was looking for recipes on how to cook. It was so buttery and I loved the spice! Did a side of pesto angel hair and wilted spinach. Will definitely make again!

My husband loved it. Didn’t have Italian dressing so I used a honey mustard one I had. Used about 1/2 of the amount of dressing that the recipe called for. Still quite nice. Also used bassa fillets instead of redfish. Great.

Easy and flavorful.
It was equally good for the fresh catfish as it  was the fresh redfish.

This was incredible...didn't have cayenne so I subbed powdered red pepper.  Nice spice to it!  And redfish is soooo good when caught fresh.

I've made this twice already and my guess love it. You can use prepared cajun seasoning also. I recommend cutting back a bit on the Italian dressing. the first time I made it, there was too much and the second time, i used less and it was PERFECT!

My husband and I went fishing and for the first time caught and ate redfish. They are very large so I deep fried the first time and had to try something else. This was IT! The hubby loves blackened. I did scale back about 1/2 cayenne (because of me). I blackened the fillets in a skillet with some bacon grease and the left-over butter. Then drizzled the blackened filets with the Italian dressing (maybe 2 T) because I know my husband wouldn't like all that dressing. The little changes made it PERFECT for both of us. TY for the recipe.

I have tried many red fish recipes and this is absolutely incredible!! My husband catches them fresh in the morning and I like to make it for supper that evening. He said that this is by far the greatest redfish recipe he has ever had!
I followed the recipe to a T but had a lot of seasoning left over due to having only 1 large fillet. (save for next time!) Make sure you do blacken on both sides for just a little bit before tossing into the oven. It locks in all that flavor! I sent the rest of the fish along with my husband today for work and was so jealous! ;) 
Tip: try following the recipe exactly how it says first and then the second time around - make adjustments as needed. I promise you won't be disappointed!!

Loved the recipe,however fish rub was not enough for 4 fillets. Not sure if tablespoons of the ingredients would not have been better than teaspoons. I also did everything in one saute pan including putting the pan in the oven. Because that pan is already hot it took less than 30 minutes to finish in the oven. This will all depend on the thickness of your fillets.

Fresh fish always are better. This is a great cajun recipe, almost blinded myself searing it. The cayenne in the face and all. That is my fault though. I am gonna try it with catfish next. 
Like my Mom said, if it is smokin' it is cookin'. When it is black it's done.

Not great. Waaaay too salty and too much lemon flavor. And with the Italian dressing it doesn't make sense to call this "Cajun" blackened redfish. I suppose one could tinker with the ingredients but it seems a lot easier to just pick up a commercial blackened fish seasoning.

This was good, and I will use it as a base recipe. I thought the dressing step was not needed.
