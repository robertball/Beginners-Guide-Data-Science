I used red pepper instead of paprika simply because I didn't have it. I also didn't have the wine or mint but it was still PERFECT. It was spicy sweet and citrus all at the same time. My husband even said it was worth the wait, which is REALLY good. Definitely my new favorite chicken!!!


Today I again tried this recipe but with pork chops, STILL AWESOME!!

I love this recipe the way it was written and my five stars are for that! (If you don't like recipe changes, just stop reading now.)   However, should you go to make one evening and find yourself without any limes, try these tweaks:  1 tangerine (or clementine, etc.) zested and juiced 1 T jerk seasoning (instead of paprika) 2 T white sugar (instead of brown) 1T red pepper flakes (instead of mint)  You'll still get the delicious crunch and citrus zing, but with a hint of heat.

I followed the recipe until the mint.  I added cilantro instead.  It is awesome!  I really like the flavors, sweet, smoky, lemony.  Really good!

this was great. i had thinner chicken breasts so i baked only for 25 minutes instead of 45, and they came out incredibly tender.  i threw some broccoli and orange peppers in with the broth and wine too. The orange/yellow peppers really gave it an authentic taste and look. definitely adding my arsenal of recipes.

It was very good. I made a couple of changes though, I replaced the lime with lemon and i put a little more chicken broth and more brown sugar than it called for other than that it was GREAT! A+++++

Would not make again - mint makes it interesting but in a distracting way. Would make the KEY WEST chicken on the website over this.

I was not expecting much from this dish but I was very pleased with how it turned out! The sweetness was nice and cut through by the lime, and the breading and baking techniques kept the chicken moist. I served this with steamed vegetables and rice and it was an easy weeknight meal.

Made this pretty much as described, though I only had an orange and used that instead! Also put a tiny bit of ginger into the flour/paprika mix (which I made with gluten-free flour, being celiac). It was still just fantastic; threw some sliced orange bell pepper into the skillet before popping it into the oven. Delicious, and my husband especially liked it.

This is a good recipe. I substituted sweet basil for the mint and added cilantro to counter the sweetness of the brown sugar. All in all...definitely thumbs up.

My whole family loved this recipe!  I will definitely be making it again.  I did have to substitute the chicken broth for vegetable broth and didn't use the mint but still came out great.  Recommend it!

Absolutely delicious.  The first time I used unrefined white sugar instead of brown sugar just because I didn't have it.  I also used twice as much lime zest and beer instead of wine.  Tasted great!  We're trying it with chicken wings and brown sugar now.  We used the double lime zest and beer again.

Tasty and easy, which all in all is a good combination. Brown sugar with lime zest added a nice texture and tangy flavor however the taste teattered slightly to the sweet side, perhaps a little more zest. I was apprehensive about the mint, but couldn't resist its refreshing smell, and the result was a nice subtle addition; perhaps a Mojito along side next time to provide a complimentary flavor. Served with steamed rice topped with a spoonful of the baking broth and side of fresh steamed green beans topped with coarsely graded Parmesan, both from the local organic market. Plan on trying this recipe again with a breast cut, as the leg meat was a little fatty.  Mental note, make sure to crack a window to avoid any fried chicken odor noticeable the following day. :)

This has been one of my favorite recipes for 12 years!  I do usually use boneless chicken breasts, and during the winter use 2 tsp. dried mint when fresh is not readily available.

Oh, this was wonderful -- moist, flavorful, and the aroma just heavenly!  I cut back a little on the paprika and added about a 1/4th tsp of chili powder for that extra kick as well as to counterbalance the sweetness.  Served it with a zucchini/summer squash/tomato saute -- my husband is still raving about it!

The flavor was pretty good, and my two small children enjoyed it.  I substituted chicken breasts for the chicken thighs.  I wasn't crazy about the brown sugar topping; the lime and mint were a nice touch though.

This is probably my favorite dish from Allrecipes to date! I didn't change a thing other than the portion size since it was just for my husband and I. Oh, and I had to use a lemon instead of a lime.... LOVED IT!!!! I will definitely make this again in the future!

This was an interestingly flavored dish. Half of us enjoyed the flavors and half of us didn't. The chicken was very tender but I didn't get a large lime flavor from it. Also, I really didn't care for the mint flavor, if I make this again I will use cilantro.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and this chicken is to die for. It's so tender and juicy that it just falls apart. We loved the brown sugar & zest topping so much that I think I'll put extra on next time.

My husband and I both liked the recipie.  My 10 year old did not.  I made it excactly except for the mint.  It was flavorful and it made its own sauce while cooking.  I think I will try it with lemons next time around.

Very delicious! We endeed up having this for Easter lunch, I think I would have preferred white meat instead of dark meat...maybe it could have been a little healthier since it was breaded chicken.

Very good.  Instead of regular paprika, used Smoked - Delish!  Will make it again for sure.  Also used fresh mint, and a table white wine.

I made this with chicken thighs, but kept the skin on b/c I like to have crispy skin on top. I used 2/3c of flour b/c I wasn't sure if 1/3 would be enough. I put it in a large ziploc bag with the salt and paprika. I browned for a few minutes in olive oil, which next time I will not use. I placed them in the baking dish with the rest of the ingredients. This was my first time zesting anything, and I found it a little frustrating, but the little bit of zest I got was enough. I did not use the mint. I poured more broth over the chicken as it was cooking. Overall, it was tasty and my picky boyfriend enjoyed it and took it to work for lunch the next day, and his spanish coworker enjoyed it. I did have trouble with the aroma in the house afterwards, which smelled like a lime beer brewery!

We made some substantial alterations to fit our schedule.  We placed chicken legs (not thighs) in crockpot and drizzled with lime, salt, paprika, olive (not vegetable) oil, 2 T coconut (not brown) sugar, and1/4 cup each wine and broth.  After cooking on low 6 hours, we transferred to a roaster and roasted for fifteen minutes at 400 degrees to crisp the skin.  Before serving, we drizzled with lime juice and sprinkled with lime zest, leaving off the mint at others' suggestions.  DELICIOUS.

Simple, different, and my husband agreed it should be added to our regular rotation : )  I am not a big fan of paprika, so I used 1/2 Tbs of curry powder in place of the Tbs of paprika.  I also used apple juice in place of the white wine, since I didn't have any white wine on hand.  Tonight I'll be making it again - this time with orange and lemon in place of the lime.  (The limes at the grocery did not look so hot this week.)

When we made this I put it in the slow cooker for a few hours after making, then into the oven to crip it up and we loved it. The chicken was so tender it fell off the bones. Will do it like this again.

Great recipe for a nice summer day! I love the citrusy flavor that the lime gives the dish. I made just as suggested in the recipe and it turned out great. I have to say, though, that my oven cooking time was MUCH shorter than in the directions. I served this with green beans and cornbread.

this was really, really good! 
I omitted the salt, used only 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, sprinkle of poultry seasoning and pepper with the flour. 
I only needed 2 tbsps oil to fry the chicken. 
For the sauce I used 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp lime juice, 1 tbsp chicken better than boullion and 1 tbsp minced garlic mixed into 1 cup water.
I added the sauce and leftover flour to the frying pan and whisked while bringing it to a boil, added the chicken back to the pan then baked 30 minutes at 350.
Next time I make chicken piccata I will add 1 tbsp of brown sugar I think it really made a nice flavour in this recipe.

The chicken had a really interesting flavor that was bit like fruit loops.  I missed the step where you dip the chicken in the lime juice, so I cooked the chicken in the lime juice instead of oil, which gave it a much stronger lime flavor.  I put a lot of mint on the top of the chicken before putting it in the oven, but because it didn't have any moisture we lost most of the mint flavor.  Next time I'll mix the mint in with the liquids so it doesn't dry out.

We just had this for dinner this evening. It was just not good. I thought it sounded fun sort of like a mojito chicken. Brown sugar and chicken do not go together.

I only had 2 chicken breasts so I pretty much third every ingredient except I didn't have flour so I subbed with corn meal, no paprika so I used red chili pepper.  And for the lime I juiced what I could salvage from a mixture of 4-5 limes/lemons that were probably at least a couple months old, lol..the REAL reason I was looking for a recipe to use up that stuff.  Also, I just had the meat sit in a ziplock bag of the acidic juices over night instead of mixing it with whatever the recipe calls for.  And after browning the meat and prepping it for baking, I spooned the brown sugar over the still hot chicken and sprinkled dried sweet basil I had on hand until it looked pretty! (I didn't have mint)  Also, I probably browned the meat between 8-10 minutes and then had them bake in the oven for 25 minutes.  Came out tender, moist, and flavorful!

We thoroughly enjoyed this.  It's super easy and super tasty.  Next time, I will plan to serve this over noodles, and thicken that wonderful chicken broth-wine mixture in which the chicken cooks.  I did use chicken tenders, and cooked them for about 30 minutes in the oven.

Absolutely wonderful!!!! I followed directions almost exactly the only things that I did do differently was to add a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the flower seasoning and to switch out the mint for cilantro because fresh mint was not available where I live. So incredibly delicious!!! Could not get enough!! I will definitely be making this again very soon... maybe with my own twists on it!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this, and I'm not big on chicken so that's saying something!  We left out the mint and since we didn't have low-sodium broth, we cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp without a need for more.  Next time (and trust me there will be a next time!) we'll try using cilantro in place of the mint, and maybe lessen the sugar as it was pretty sweet.  Overall a delicious recipe though!

I have to be honest that I did not make this as the recipe stated. I read it and then began making it while doing 8 different other things. Here is what I did: I used breasts (not thighs) and did not measure any of the ingredients. I only drizzled a tad bit of oil in the pan to brown the chicken (wish I used more) Once I transferred the chicken to the baking dish, I did not have a fresh lime so I just sprinkled more lime juice over the brown sugar. I glanced at the recipe and saw chicken broth so I poured some in the pan and sent it to the oven. I probably didn't put near enough liquid in that was called for...BUT...the chicken still turned out rather well. The flour was a bit gummy in spots but overall, not bad for not reading the directions clearly. I will try this again and really follow the recipe!! Thanks...

Very good! I didn't have a lime so I used lime juice from the bottle and did not add lime zest. We really didn't care for the mint so next time I'll omit that. I would definately make this again.

I have made this several times.  My only change is I cut chicken breasts in half to resemble the same portion size as a thigh.  I used dried mint once and fresh mint the second time and really could not taste the difference. I have a book that I print recipes out and put in plastic sleeves only after they have been taste tested several times.  This one makes the cut!!!! Love it.

Sorry folks, my family really didn't like it.  Too sweet, not enough lime or mint and the flour coating was just soggy.  On the plus side the chicken was very moist and tender.

This is a great recipe. Saute the chicken in a cast iron pan and then bake in the same to get all the goodness.
family loved this and it was so tender and flavourful. 
will be adding this one to my regular dinner menu list.

Looks pretty, but just tastes okay straight out of the oven. The chicken is nice and tender, but the flavor doesn't quite develop  until the next day or so.

I think it might need more lime zest or lime, but I'm not sure.

Great easy recipe. I added a bit of butter to the pan when frying to add that extra bit of flavor. I added a bit more of the wine and stock then drained off the extra into the pan that I fried the chicken in. I topped it up with the rest of the stock that I had from the can, the juice of 1/2 a lime and reduced it down over high heat. Made an excellent glaze. Will make again, thanks for the contribution.

Excellent!  I didn't have any white wine so i just used the chicken broth and i didn't feel like a trip to the store for mint so i substituted cilantro.  The lime with the brown sugar is delicous.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved the flavors.  Pounded boneless chicken breasts until even thickness and baked for only 20 minutes after they were well browned.

next time i'll use less brown sugar.
(i thought it was perfect but my husband said it was too sweet)
i also added cayenne pepper to the dry mix/ coating.
now, dont know if its just me, but i missed the part in the recipe about where to put the deglazed drippings?
i poured it over the chix ( i used chix breast fillets so cooking time was 15 mins ) before baking which might've been a mistake; the chix was not crunchy  . it was very moist, not dry at all thanks to the sauce i added!
oh, & i used the zest of 2 limes (tip: invest in a microplane/ zest grater.  a cheese box grater just doesnt do)
all in all, this was delish!

I made this for dinner two nights ago and it turned out very good.  The chicken was moist and crispy.  I loved the combination of flavors, the lime was very tasty and the brown sugar and lime zest with mint was a great combination.  Will definitely make again.

This has to be THE best chicken recipe ever.  Don't change a thing!  Except maybe for the wine choice, could be complimented nicely with a margarita!

It was good. I used whole wheat flour and no white wine or Mint all three because its what I had or didnt have.. It came out good. I expected it to be more limey it wasnt. I'll make it again and try to make it more Limey next time. Overall good :)

This smelled SO GOOD while cooking.  I didn't think the chicken broth/wine was necessary.  I am going to experiment in the future with ways to make it crispier and limey-er, but otherwise it was delightful.

Chicken was very moist and flavorful. Exactly the right amount of lime to give it a bright, fresh taste.  Husband liked it and asked to put it in our recipient rotation.

Made it exactly as written and enjoyed it, will make it again.  Paired it with just vegetables and a small starter garden salad and white wine.  No ingredients overpowered each other and liked the lime and sweetness that made this dish unique.

I doubled the recipe but followed it to the letter.  I liked the flavor of this recipe.  Everyone said that this recipe was a keeper.  What is the real teller, is the fact that my husband stood by the baking pan after dinner, scraping it.  Now anyone who is married knows that that is a 5-star indicator.  LOL

It's fine.  I didn't taste the lime at all.  I really only tasted the brown sugar which gave the chicken a nice sweetness.

OMG, I tend to try recipes while my trucker boyfriend is on the road, this one is perfect! I worried, because I thought there may have been too  much wine (and god forbid I taste it); LOL 
But wow easy, tasty and different!  Didnt change a thing!
Making this when he's home again, I'll dress it up and make it a special dinner! Thanks for the share ??

I really wanted to love this recipe, but the final result was just okay.  The only change I made, out of necessity, was using dried mint in place of fresh (since I didn't have any).  The flavors were good, but cooking it in the broth/wine just made all of the nice crispy coating on the bottom very soggy.

This rating represents a split between me and hubby because he really liked it and I thought it was just OK.  I did use chicken breasts and omitted the mint but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was moist, but I wanted more zip to it I think.  I like trying new ways to fix chicken, and this certainly did fulfill that!  Thanks for the recipe, and thanks for feeding my hubby well!

This Limehouse Chicken was sweet and zippy!
Only thing I did different was along with the paprika, I added a dash of cayenne for a smidge of bite. Also, instead of mint, I used basil ribbons to finish it off because that is what I had already chopped for the baked zucchini I served it with. Wonderful dinner!

I always use skin on bone in thighs for recipes like this. The skin was crispy and delicious, and if you don't like the skin you can always remove it after cooking. I find it greatly helps both the flavor and keeps the meat nice and moist.

Very yummy. I don't usually fry food in oil, but this recipe intrigued me. I used very little oil, followed the directions except topped with red pepper flakes instead of mint. The mint just didn't sound like it went with the rest of the ingredients

I've made this a couple times now and always get rave reviews, even with small tweaks when needed.  It's a very forgiving recipe and versatile with different herbs and citrus.  I also try to cook paleo as much as possible, so I use almond flour for this and it works great in place of the regular flour.

This was okay. I thought I browned the chicken well enough before I put it in the oven, but the crust came out kind of soggy. I did use less chicken, which was probably a factor, but despite the texture, the flavor wasn't enough to knock my socks off anyway. Although one bite I took did taste like lime Trix, which was awesome.

Have made this recipe about a dozen times now and it is pretty much my favorite chicken recipe!  The only thing i change is that i usually don't have any mint on hand so I have a cilantro seasoning blend I add to the top.  My picky kids even like it!  Thanks so much for sharing!

One of my best finds in a long long time!!!! The brown sugar and mint you put over the top kind of caramelizes over the chicken creating a nice light crust on the top. The flavors are amazing, and this is the first time I can say that for a first run with a recipe without altering and adding my own touches to it. I should have made a double recipe for my family of 4 as a fight almost broke out with my kids over who got the last piece of chicken. This will be in the regular rotation for sure! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Awesome recipe!  I did not change a single thing and it came out unbelievably delicious.  My husband, who HATES bone-in chicken devoured it.  I've made it twice and it is definitely a keeper!  Very easy recipe to impress dinner guests as well.

I thought this dish was great but BF did not like it. I used BLSL thin sliced breast. In place of paprika I used chili powder. Would make again for myself.

Overall this was a simple and delicous recipe. Made it with the thighs and boneless skinless breasts. Both were tender and juicy.

This recipe is totally delicious.  The paprika with lime and the sweetness from the brown sugar make this one of my new favorite chicken recipes.  In my opinion the mint is optional.  If you like mint/lime (think: mojito) then add it, if not then don't, simple.

Very delicious!  Excellent, unique sweet & tangy taste.  Loved it!  I omitted the mint because I didn't have any, substituted chicken broth for the white wine, and used about 6 chicken breast halves.  Will definitely make again!

Kind of disappointing...I found it to be a little bit bland, and really quite salty. 1 tsp of salt would suffice, and I would probably use 3/4 cup wine to 1/4 cup chicken broth to cut the saltiness. Not sure if I'll make it again.

I liked this a lot.  I forgot to dip the chicken breast (I didn't use thighs) in the lime juice.  So, I squeezed fresh lime juice over it after it came out of the oven.  I only used about 1 1/2 T sugar but next time I'll probably use just 1T.  I pounded out the chicken breast before hand; it only needed about 15 minutes in the oven.  It was so moist!  Cooked perfectly!  Next time, I'm going to use chili powder instead of paprika.  I think it will go great with the brown sugar!!

This was a really good and simple , easy recipe . I've made few changes , i mixed paprika with smoked paprika , and also the juice turned out to be too runny , so after it's done , i poured all the juice in a skillet and i added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up . Other than that , it was perfect ! I served it with rice and brussel sprouts .

Nice easy recipe. I read some of the other reviews and did add red pepper as well. The chicken was fabulous and the juice it produced was great over the rice and squash we served it with. My only other change was to mix panko crumbs in the flour mixture. It added texture and nice little crispies to the juice. Thanks! Will make again

My family loved this!  It's delicious smell permeated my house - and I was asked to make it again soon!  I didn't have any white wine so I just used the same amount of chicken broth.  I dribbled a little lime/jalapeno-infused olive oil on it when I was browning the chicken and I think it was a nice touch.

This was delish!!!  Made it with chicken breast (4 big - cut into smaller pieces) as hubby does not like dark meat. Doubled the recipe, and served on top of brown rice.  (I also did not have the mint.) It was fantastic.  

Kids were bummed there wasn't enough to take as leftovers for lunch. 

House smelled great too!

I would have to say that I think 5 minutes of Prep time is a bit optimistic - when you think of having to zest and juice the limes...

(Like others, I was a bit sus about the lime and brown sugar - but it turned out grand.)  Highly recommend. 

Enjoy.

I was unsure about the brown sugar on chicken and the paprika, but this was so good.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I also really liked the fresh mint.  My husband and I loved it - we'll have it again.  Unfortunately, the kids weren't too wild about it, but that's nothing new!  Thanks for the yummy dinner.

I made this for Father's Day with rice and another recipe (garlic broccoli).  The chicken turned out perfect.  The only thing I did differently was use  bottled lime instead of fresh and sprinkled dry mint instead of fresh (just didn't have on hand).  The chicken was absolutely PERFECT.  My daughter has her degree in Culinary Arts and she was praising the chicken. A+!

Was snowed in and looking to use my boneless chicken thighs without having to go to the store for something.  Ran across this, and even though I didn't have the fresh mint nor the "real" lime I thought I'd try it.  (Instead of the lime and lime zest, I just used lime juice from one of those lime bottles.)  Turned out fabulous!!!  I served it with white rice and used the juices from the baking dish to spoon over the rice and chicken.  Will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks!!

This was great! My husband who usually prefers just the breast that this was a make again recipe! We loved the lime! My thighs were a little thin and took just 27 minutes and came out the same time the Rice-a-Roni was ready!

I made this as close as I could to the original, but I did cut up the chicken before coating and I didn't have white wine, so I used cooking sherry.

Yes. Absolutely yes, and will make again, by request. This was simple and delicious, thank you.

On a side note, it's occurred to me this might be delicious with bourbon instead of wine. I'll do that next time and report back, but this was amazing as is.

Works well with combination of thighs and legs or with just drumsticks alone. I've tried bone-in and skin-on, as well. Presentation is not a clean, perhaps, but I like it. Don't skimp on the salt, the lime or the mint. Wouldn't go any sweeter than a Riesling for the wine.

Made as printed except I used the iron frying pan rather than a baking pan in the oven. It was okay. Nothing exciting, and the brazing time may have been too long for the chicken thighs.  It seemed a little mushy (but moist)

I Had chicken breasts available so I used them instead of the darker thighs.I substituted the lemon juice for the lime since it was available. I also did not use the mintI found this recipe easy and very flavorful.

I only made 2 changes, which which included using boneless chicken breast because I prefer breast over thighs, and I followed another reviewer's idea to substitute some of the paprika with cayenne.  This time I used 2 tsp. paprika, and 1 tsp. cayenne.  Next time I will use 1-1/2 tsp. of each.  We thought this recipe was delicious, and will definitely make it again!  We loved the flavor of the lime with the chicken.

It was pretty good, but needs a few  improvements. Why waste the lime juice by sprinkling it on the meat  at the start? Makes more sense to pour it over the chicken right before baking it. Brown sugar did not help enhance the flavor, only added too much sweetness. It was a bit  soggy as well. Next time I will eliminate the wine and just pour broth and lime juice over it. I used cilantro rather than mint  because I think mint  would overpower the taste of the dish.

Reading some of the other reviews, I also used red pepper instead of paprika. It gives the chicken a little heat. I also used fresh honey instead of brown sugar. I mixed the honey and lime zest with lime juice from a second lime and used it like a glaze. It was delicious!

I loved this recipe. The only thing I did different is I added more brown sugar and minced lime peel. My husband really liked it.

This is a really nice chicken dish. Easy to make but very favorable. Be careful not to over cook the chicken in the frying pan.

Bit too limey for us, nice though but would probably change it a bit next time and not put quite so much lime in it.

I will definitely make this again. It was melt in your mouth delicious. My daughter did not like the hint of sweetness to it but I think it's part of the unique flavor. You can always omit or lessen the brown sugar to your taste.

Also next time a little less brown sugar , will cut the amount in half.

I used 6 skin-on, bone-in thighs and cut a large skinless breast in half.  Used coconut oil to sauté/brown the chicken then doubled the white wine and poured in with chicken to deglaze before popping into oven.  Did not use chicken broth.  I used the same pan for the oven cooking.  There was a bit more fat in bottom of pan when finished, but a quick drain on a paper towel would take care of that if it bothers you.  Reduce cooking oil a bit for skin on chicken.  The crystallized sugar and lime zest was perfect on top!  Wow!

Even as written this recipe gets 5 stars.  It's very tasty.  It's in our regular dinner rotation.  I now add garlic powder to the flour mixture and substitute cilantro for the mint.   I'm asked to double the recipe and we chop up what we don't eat for dinner and have it in tacos the next night.  YUM.

This is a delicious chicken dish and I have made it using not just lime but also lemon, orange and even tangerine, it never fails to hit the taste buds just right. When the chicken is done I drain the cooking  juices into a small pan and add some extra juice from whatever type  of citrus I'm using mixed with cornstarch to make plenty of sauce because we like it over rice and it really boosts the flavor. The citrus goes well with the brown sugar in the sauce. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because as written the serving size is kind of skimpy and that counts a lot in a recipe. We eat 2 thighs apiece and so I use 8 chicken thighs so we can have leftovers the next night.

We love both chicken and lime, but are cutting down on carbs, so I made a few osubstitutions to this recipe - chicken breasts (just a personal preference over thighs), almond flour instead of wheat flour, and just a couple of teaspoons of stevia instead of all the brown sugar.  The cooking time was a bit less due to the change from thighs to breasts, but the chicken turned out to be delicious and moist.  We served a side of zucchini noodles with a bit of the wine sauce, and a green salad. Great meal!

I used ½ tbsp of paprika and ½ of sumac because we love Mediterranean spices. Also used less wine and broth and added the remainder of the lime juice. You could add some cornstarch mixed with a small amount of liquid to thicken the sauce and serve over pasta or rice.  Also, it was perfectly cooked after 25 minutes.  Next time I will use ½ the amount of brown sugar but will definitely make again.

I didn't have many of the ingredients on hand so I just did my best with what I had. I used boneless chicken breast, flour, salt, paprika and garlic powder. I browned it oil and then baked with minced garlic on top. Very garlicky. Pretty good.

Sorry but we just didn't care for this chicken. The only change I made was to use 1/2 the brown sugar since Hubby doesn't care for sweet main dishes.  It just didn't have much flavor.  I won't be making it again.

Awesome. I always try making the recipe as is first before I review it and I don't think I'd change anything here. I used a bit of dried mint (with a light hand) and didn't find it added anything, so I might leave it off next time, but otherwise I think this is a great recipe!

I made this dish exactly as written.  We had asparagus as a side dish. My wife and I absolutely loved it. It was definitely a pleasant change from the usual tomato sauce based recipes. The lime zest, brown sugar, and mint gave it a wonderful unique flavor.  This is a definite make again recipe, worthy of dinner guests.

My hubby & boys all loved this recipe ! I didn't have the mint but I'm sure it would of been even more delish ... I wouldn't change it. Compliments to the chef ! What I would add is a glaze, using the juices, wine and broth leave behind with a bit more heat. Love it !

This was absolutely wonderful. I made substitutions based on other reviews and on our family tastes. I used cayenne instead of paprika; cilantro instead of mint; and bottled lime juice instead of the white wine. I did struggle with getting most of the fat trimmed off the boneless skinless thighs, but we are trying to keep our fat and calorie intake low. I will definitely make this again with my twists.

Delicious! Fabulous  instead of the cup of broth (didn't have any)  i added juice of half a lime a little more zest and my chicken had bones and skin (drumsticks). We had it with rice. A keeper.

I make this all the time, and it's delicious! I use smoked paprika instead of regular, and that adds a great BBQ flavor. I also have substituted cilantro for the mint, while leaving out the sugar, which is a nice variation.

Delicious. Changes: used two limes for juice on chicken. Next time I think I will use cayenne instead of paprika because I felt like it needed a kick which would go well with lime and sweetness of brown sugar.

Love this recipe. It's a great way to zip us some chicken thighs. My only change was to use chopped cilantro in place of the mint. AWESOME!

Yum! I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did use bone-in thighs and simply baked a bit longer. I also used a gluten-free flour mixture and omitted the mint since I didn't have any on hand. My husband and I really enjoyed it. The kids tend to be finicky about their chicken, but they did eat it. I will be making this again.

This was very good and different than anything we've had.  We'll be making it again for sure. We used Pinot Bianco (sp?) wine. This may have made the difference for us.

One of my favorite recipes on the site!  The only substitution I made was to use fresh chopped parsley instead of mint.  Delicious flavors that make a weeknight chicken dinner something special.

This recipe was outstanding.  I did make a few changes. I used lemon instead of lime.  I added turmeric and ginger to the flour mixture. I also used garlic flavored chicken broth.  I cut up red and yellow peppers (very thin) and cooked with the chicken.

Oh my gosh!!! Fantastic! A little finicky the first time I cooked it, so it took a little longer than anticipated, but soooooo worth it! I put it over white rice and used a little of the broth to drizzle over the chicken and rice...wow! I LOVE this recipe!!! A must try!!!

Followed the recipe exactly as stated, using only fresh ingredients picked up from the store that day.  The entire dish turned out bitter.  I'm not sure what went wrong but I will not be making this again.

Oh My!  Did the final step on the stovetop to quicken the process, also cut boneless thighs into bite size pieces.  Then served as the meat on a lettuce/spinach salad.  DH said this was a definate keeper!  Did skip the mint, and added the lime zest towards the end of cooking.

This tasted ok but wasn't a hit with the kids.  The taste of the lime was a bit much.  May try it again but reduced the lime content.

Wonderfully moist! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs-everything else I kept the same.  Served it with rice pilaf and french cut green beans.  Thank you ! I will add this to the monthly dinner menu!

We loved this chicken!  It was easy to make, and very flavorful.  I didn't think one lime would provide enough flavor, but it did!  I made this according to the directions, with the addition of a little garlic powder in the flour mixture.  We will definitely make it again, and a double batch next time.

This chicken is delicious and so easy and quick to make.  The lime and brown sugar give are a unique flavor and keeps the chicken so juicy.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked it per the recipe... amazing!  Will be great for guests!

Crowd pleaser. Family seated at the table already waiting when I serve this one. I use bone in thighs, ( bone-in meat has more flavor,IMHO )marinated for 6 hrs. in 1/2 c. lime juice, 1/8 c. tamari. add a generous 2-4 shakes of cayenne to the dredging flour to add another level to the flavor palate . . .   Top rack and broil for 2-3 mins. to finish in the oven . .just to caramelize a little crunch to the sugar topping. . . Plate it up with a sprinkle of mint sauce to make people promise favors for the recipe. Moderately fussy to make . . but sooooo worth the effort.

This tasted like two separate recipes smashed together - and not in a good way.  It was just salty and strange.  Also, frying then baking means a massive cleanup time.  The kitchen smelled weird and unappetizing also.  On the upside, the chicken came out very moist with a wonderful texture (under the strange salty taste).

Interesting blend of ingredients!  I wanted to use my mint leaves before they begin to rot, and found this recipe. I modified the recipe by > 1. I didnt bother frying the chicken. Instead, I marinated the chicken in chili powder + celery seeds + dried thyme + salt and pepper, while I prepared the rest of the ingredients. > 2. I omitted the both the wine and broth since I didnt have any.  Instead, I baked the chicken in my own broth (1 cup water, 1 cup carrots, 3/4 cup celery, red onions, some thyme, and dashes of lemon pepper) > 3. I added generous amount of mint.  

Even with my "lazified" version, we enjoyed the dish, and I give credit to this recipe for the idea.

Started with red wine instead of white wine, I painted the mixture with oil because I barbequed it and was trying to get it to brown. After 4 minutes on each side over direct heat I transferred it to an aluminum pan and added the broth and wine and finished with 8 minutes indirect cooking. It did set up and kinda browned but it isn't right.  Even that didn't ruin it. Very juicy (165 F and rested for 5 minutes). Great flavor and I bet it will be much better when I prepare it correctly.

Too bitter.  Too much paprika and I wouldn't put the lime zest in at all.  The coating was soggy.  I was surprised that this tasted so bad when everyone rated it so high.

The brown sugar makes this chicken very flavorful.  Even was good heated up the next day.

Husband said the lime was too strong...I worried that the sugar masked the lime flavor too much.  We both enjoyed it, though.

We loved this recipe. Very easy to make.  In fact I am making it tonight. The Lime and brown sugar are great together.  Nothing like the smell of freshlime.

This was good as is, but when I make it again I will definetly cut back on the brown sugar and add a bit more salt.

One of the best recipes I've ever tried. Can't say enough good about it!  I drained the wine/brith mixture off the chicken into a saucepan and reduced it.  Then I added some cilantro, lime juice and some cornstarch and it made the most delicious gravy. Just amazing!  Served with roasted asparagus.

This is one of the best chicken dishes I've made! It's incredibly easy and quick! I'm a triathlete so I made a couple tweeks...I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, browned chicken in coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar. Tastes great---almost like a Mint Julip!

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for a long time but never made it. I was looking for something for chicken thighs and came across it. It was very very good! I did what some other reviewer's did and added  red and yellow mini peppers to the sauce. Also I did not have mint, don't like cilantro so I added some fresh basil yummy!!! will be making this one often! Thanks Leah_Chris

this was some of the best chicken I have ever tasted. It tasted like something you would get served in a good restaurant. I  only had chicken breasts so I used those. I put them in a large baggie and squeezed the juice of two limes on top of the chicken meaning to cook it that night but didnt end up making it till the next day. Cooked it just like the recipe calls for except I didnt have any paprika or mint  but honestly I dont think that would have improved the flavor much. I dont know if it was the chicken sitting in the lime juice all night or the combo of that and the white wine and chicken broth but it was so full of flavor. Even my very picky 16 year old who usually doesnt like my bland tasting chicken loved it! I will definatly be making it again soon. Thanks

Just wonderful, the whole family really enjoyed this.  The lime and mint combination works very well.  Instead of brown sugar, I used Agave Nectar.

Delicious! I added the rest if the flour from the dredging to the oil in the pan and then poured the chicken soup/wine mixture into the pan and whipped it until smooth before pouring it over the Cutlets and baking. Everyone from young and old loved it!

Good! I used juice from 2 limes but zest from only 1. The thighs I used were thin,so I only cooked it for 20 minutes. My picky 4 year old even liked it.

We didn't have the mint and I didn't use the brown sugar.  It still turned out incredibly tender and delicious.  My sweetie LOVED it and it was so easy to make.  I didn't use a baking dish - I browned the chicken in skillet then put the skillet in the oven - turned out beautifully.
