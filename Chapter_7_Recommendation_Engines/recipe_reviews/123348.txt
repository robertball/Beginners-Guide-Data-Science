Basic recipe but use it as a base. I wouldn't really consider the name of this recipe to be correct. I added other veggies and left out the croutons.

This was not bad.  I think that next time I will add some zucchini as only having peppers and tomatoes it does not feel complete.  The flavors were good, it was just missing something.
