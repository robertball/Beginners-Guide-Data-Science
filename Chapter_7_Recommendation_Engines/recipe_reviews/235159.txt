Made this manicotti tonight and it was delish and so easy!  I made this for the opposite reason Chef John intended : I had some leftover homemade ricotta that needed to be used up!  Since I didn't have turkey leftovers on hand, I used meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken.  The only other change to the recipe I made was that I used a mixed Italian seasonings blend rather than marjoram as I didn't have any on hand.  I was really impressed by how much the crepes mimicked pasta in this dish.  I almost couldn't tell this difference.   And these are much easier to fill than the traditional manicotti shells (though truth be told, I always cheated when using those but slitting them open after I boiled them and before rolling them up around the filling).  I will definitely make this again!

I changed the crepe recipe to keep this low carb...it was awesome and my diabetic husband loved it.  Gluten free Almond Flour Crepes:  5 eggs, 1/2 cup almond flour, 2 T arrowroot (optional), 2 teaspoons sucralose, 1 t vanilla extract, pinch of sea salt.  Coconut oil for crepe pan. 

This is going into our low carb cookbook!

Instead of making crepes I bought jumbo shells then undercooked them a little. I doubled Chef John's filling recipe but substituted oregano for the marjoram and romano cheese instead of parmesan. I did double the filling recipe since I cooked the entire box of shells and had enough filling for 30 (there were 38 shells in the box). This is a great way to use 2 cups of leftover turkey but I think the stuffed shells need more than 1-1/2 cups of sauce, I used more than 2 cups. They're yummy by the way :) Thanks Chef John :)

Like I've said before, John comes up with some great ideas.  I leave the pepper flakes out, and I use basil in place of marjoram.  I also use cottage cheese, because that's what I always have in my fridge.  Everybody loved this.  I made a big pan of these and toke them to my Senior Center for pot-luck meal.

Fantastic! Was so bored with turkey sandwiches, turkey tetrazzini, turkey stew... this was such a clever idea! I had made Chef John's roast turkey and gravy for Thanksgiving this year, so when I was chopping my turkey, it looked EXACTLY like Chef John's! Thank you for making me into such a wonderful cook! I never alter Chef John's recipes when I try them. Why would you?

I made this twice before December and loved it both times. My wife wasn't crazy about the crèpes but I thought they were so tasty.

It tasted fine.  Thought the cooking time was a little too long though.

Great dish.  Making the crepes by hand brings a fun and rewarding element to the dish.  Don't cheap out on the sauce

What a find!  Don’t skip the crepe step because that’s exactly what elevates this dish ahead of other manicotti recipes.  This turned out perfectly!  I’m going to start a new tradition of making this dish the weekend after Thanksgiving every year.

I personally did not like these.  Had a weird tang to it, probably since it uses left over turkey.

I can't wait to cook these.  I have not had manicotti in quite a few years since I have to follow a gluten-free diet.  It never occurred to me that you could make gluten-free crepes in place of the pasta.  I looking forward to making these real soon.  Thank you, Chef John.
