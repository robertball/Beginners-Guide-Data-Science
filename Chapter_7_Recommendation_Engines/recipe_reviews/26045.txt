I too grew up eating this cake, and this recipe took me right back to my childhood.  It was quite yummy and lots of fun to make!  Thanks for sharing :)

I know it says that it tastes better without frosting, but I used a recipe for buttercream icing submitted by Sharon Gerstman and it was a wonderful combination!!

This recipe is amazing. I made a few minor changes which reflect what was available in my kitchen: I used Vanilla soy milk instead of milk, replaced the lemon juice with Key lime juice and baked it in a jelly roll style pan to lessen the cooking time. Mine took about 20 to 25 minutes and oh goodness, it's excellent! It has the texture of the cream cheese poundcake I make with out the extra fat. We ate it as dessert with sugared strawberries and whipped cream spooned over the top and have been attacking it plain since. The flavor is exactly like a perfectly smooth and soft sugar cookie.

This is the recipe I grew up with and this was the first time I've made it myself.  I find this recipe lighter than other poundcakes - not as dense, buttery, or sweet.  Reminds me of a sugar cookie in cake form and kids love it.  Makes very good strawberry shortcake, otherwise I'll just dust with powered sugar.

Very nice. This is not sweet enough to suit our tastes, however. This does taste somewhat like a sugar cookie in a cake. It is very light. I could not taste any lemon or butter. I doubt I will make again, but if you are in the market for a light, somewhat bland, not that sweet pound cake then this is perfect. I can imagine that this would be great with sugared fruit, etc. as a topping. By the way, I baked this in a bundt pan for 70 minutes and the edges had already started to burn a tad.
