I won't make this again. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so overly-spicy we couldn't eat it. We tried diluting it with additional water and milk and it was still too spicy. I think the tablespoons of spices should have been teaspoons instead. Plus it was an odd purplish-gray color from the wine. ??

There were way too many dried spices in this recipe!  I might try it again but only use 1/3 to 1/2 of the spices.

Too spicy for my kids to eat. And this is on me, but they skipped the step to drain the meat. This has potential if you cut the spices in half.

I thought it was okay, but made some changes. I did not use milk. I used less than 1 Tablespoon coriander and cumin; I didn't care for the coriander flavor in the stew. It's just not necessary. I also added a bit of Worcestershire for zip.

Made this last night and was disappointed for it have too much spices in it.  The spices need to be cut back probably at least by half in my opinion.  My guests all thought it had too much in the spice department.  I may try it gain but without so much in spices. The flavors are there to work with, it would be great with some adjustments made too it.

I did not use the coriander because I was out and despite that it turned out really good. Served over rice, it makes for a very good meal.
