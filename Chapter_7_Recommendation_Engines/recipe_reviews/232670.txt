Outstanding!  Had some cheddar cheese that needed to be used.  I usually make pimento cheese spread but was out of pimentos.  So I thought I'd give it a try.  I used extra horseradish only because my husband & I like things with a little extra kick.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.  Will definitely make this again.

For such a simple recipe, this is unbelievably good!  We made a roast beef dinner, and I usually make a horseradish sauce with sour cream and mayonnaise, but this time I wanted something that would stand up more firmly to a leftover roast beef sandwich.  This was so yummy! I can see this being a staple in my fridge - not only was it delicious with our original meal (especially melted into mashed potatoes), but it's a great spread for sandwiches or crackers, or veggie dip.  Only change was to add a bit of chopped fresh parsley for color, and I may have added more horseradish.    Yum!

Great cracker spread. I used double the horseradish and will add more next time, but (1) I like horseradish and (2) the potency of prepared horseradish can vary a lot.
