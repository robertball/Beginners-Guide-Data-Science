I made this for my son who cannot eat dairy.  I used olive oil and unsweetened almond milk instead and it has an uncanny flavor to original mac and cheese!  The rest of my family said that they preferred it over real mac and cheese, but I'm sure that they were just caught up in the moment.

I used considerably less garlic in this. It doesn't taste like the boxed kind of mac 'n cheese but that isn't a bad thing. It's creamy and quite savory. I used gluten free penne because I didn't have elbow pasta. This is very easy to put together. Thank you for the recipe.

While I have not made this yet, I plan too. Would like to make a comment/recommendation about choice of noodles. A lot of noodles use eggs in it, which is not vegan friendly. Be careful what you buy!

Made exactly as directed. It was amazingly delicious. And easy. No, it's not going to taste like your mom's homemade from when you were a kid.  But it's wonderful, nonetheless.

Will definitely make this again. Doesn't taste like the 'traditional' mac n cheese but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still delicious and satisfying. Husband loved it!

Next time I would use less oil. Otherwise, quite good. I used almond/cashew milk and I didn't have yellow mustard, so I used mustard spice instead.
