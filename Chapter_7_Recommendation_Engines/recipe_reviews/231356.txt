Made this for the Faceless Frenzy weekend 2013.  I loved the idea of making brownies in a cupcake liner since the plan is to freeze most of them!  I used milk chocolate chips and a small handfull of mini semi-sweet chips.  Even though I cut the recipe in half it yielded 12 cupcakes that were great.  Another plus is you'll nearly always have the ingredients on hand.

I LOVED this recipe! I also made it dairy free by using 1 cup of vegetable oil instead of butter and dairy free chocolate chips. The recipe came out great!

These turned out pretty good.  I did up the amount of chocolate chips I melted to 1 1/2 cups and also added about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. I also added some chocolate chips into the batter right before baking.  Because of the added chips I cut the sugar in half.  Turned out not super sweet but still good and my kids love them.

Can't beat the rich flavor butter gives baked goods, this recipe's best feature in my view.  They're light and milk chocolaty, which Hubs loved but I found a little wimpy in chocolate intensity, and I did boost the flavor with a pinch of salt.  Otherwise, nicely shaped, with rounded tops.  Great as is, perfection (in Hubs' opinion) with the buttercream frosting I dressed them up with.  (I gave the frosting a bit of almond flavor, but mint would be awesome good too!)

These brownies had a really good flavor, but were too cakey for my liking. I guess I was hoping for something a little more dense and fudgy. I found that adding a big pinch of salt (maybe 1/8 tsp) to the batter rounded out the flavor nicely. Also, this recipe yielded 24 cupcakes for me. All in all it's a good recipe--quick and tasty but if you're wanting a dense, chewy brownie this isn't it.

They were pretty dry and crumbly- even for a brownie. I tried frosting them but it tore up the top of the brownies. There wasn't much chocolate flavor even when I added a bit more chocolate chips than called for. I won't make this again.

Simple and delicious.  Made them for my son's preschool birthday snack.  Dusted the tops with some 10X sugar.  I actually made them two times-- the first time I baked them at the wrong temperature and they turned into hockey pucks!

These were pretty nice, and I didn't really know what to expect - it was sort of a random recipe pick. I made it exactly as written, with the butter being unsalted, and the chocolate chips being semi-sweet. They turned out to be just like the title, brownies in a cupcake form. For brownies, they were a little on the basic side, though, so I won't give this a full 5-stars, but I managed to eat all 18 cupcakes in about 8 days, and I liked them all. I'm thinking that maybe I should make these again, share them, and see what my friends think.

These were amazing. They were moist, delicious, and everyone loved them. The consistency was exactly like brownies, but the fact that the brownies were baked like cupcakes made them so easy to serve to a crowd! I used foil cupcake liners so I wouldn't have problems with the brownies sticking to paper ones. One reviewer said that the brownies came out too cake-like, but I didn't find that to be the case at all. Just perfect, in my opinion!

Fabulous!!  I used dark chocolate chips instead just for fun and added the remainder of the bag to the batter.  Next time I will buy two bags of chips and add more to the batter. :)

I followed the recipe as written.  I did not like the way they turned out.  They sank in the middle and tasted only of butter.  I will not make again

If it were possible to give this recipe 6 stars, I would.  I made a half batch last night for my husband's birthday and they were delicious.  Used slightly more semi-sweet chips than called for and topped with canned cream cheese frosting (it was a Monday night after work!).  Absolutely delicious, tastes exactly like a brownie, can't believe I didn't have a second.

After reading other reviews, I opted to make a few tweaks to the recipe when I made it. I added about 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder, a pinch of sea salt, and about 4-5 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter. They came out delicious! Super dense and flavorful. Can't go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate. :)

These tasted great but fell in the oven. They didn't look at all like cupcakes. The kids enjoyed them but I think I will stick to brownies.

These cupcakes were great! The ones in our first batch sank, but in our second batch we added baking powder and they didn't sink. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND ADDING A TEASPOON OF BAKING POWDER!

QUICK NOTES: • use dark chocolate • use less sugar • make full size brownies not mini ones    FULL COMMENT: I made this recipie in mini cupcake tins. About the batter: The batter was a good consistency but personally I would have added less sugar because it was too sweet for my liking and I would recommend using dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet for an extra chocolatey taste that I think these brownies were lacking. About the cupcake: The mini brownie cupcakes took almost the same amount time to bake as the recommended time for the regular size, and when one of the batches came out it still did not look done. After all of the brownie cupcakes cooled down they had really crumbly looking tops and when I bit into them they were rock hard on the top and oddly soft in the center.

Too buttery, and did not taste much like chocolate. I will put less butter and more chocolate or cocoa powder.

I did this recipe, and the cupcake part sunk. It tastes exactly like the ingredients and doesn't really taste like it even baked. But, I give this a 3 star rating because it was worth the time, and it tasted OK.

I make cupcakes for my husbands crew all the time. These were a great hit but I had a hard time to getting them to look just like the picture. They tasted amazing but they didn't really have that brownie look on the top of them, so I dressed them with frosting. Did I do something wrong?

Love the texture of these yummy brownie cakes. I did add chopped walnuts to the top just before baking. There not quite as chocolaty as I would like. Next time I’ll add some chocolate chips to the batter.

These were a little sweet the first time I made them according to the recipe. So the second time, I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of cocoa power. The result was a smooth, chocolatey taste that wasn’t too sweet.

I made these exactly as the recipe was written. It didn't say what kind of chocolate chips to use so I used half milk and half dark chocolate. They turned out awesome and chocolaty and chewy. Will definitely make again. As a  side note I used foil muffins cups for the first time and they were great too.

It was absolutely scrumptious. As an amateur baker, this was easy and perfect. I only added 1/4 a cup of cocoa powder  and a bit of salt, it made a world of a difference.

I would DEFINITELY make these cupcakes again. The only thing I would say that isn't really good about these is that they stick to the cupcake liners like glue and are really chewy. But I really don't mind!

Deliciously moist inside with a crunchy outer shell.  I followed the advice of fellow reviewers and doubled the chocolate chips and added a pinch of salt.  This is now my favorite brownie recipe!

I was very excited to make these because they sounded so delicious, but they didn't turn out how I hoped. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but they ended up being really dry and chalky tasting even though I followed the recipe perfectly. I tried to add frosting on top to sweeten them up but it still didn't make much a a difference. Overall, a disappointment.

Solid recipe.  I used olive oil instead of butter, 8 oz. baker's chocolate instead of chips, & maple syrup instead of sugar.  They were good and mildly sweet.

Wow, these brownie-cupcakes are amazing!  I made them several times and everyone loved them.  I added a fudge filling and some fudge on top and it was even better, would recommend. Only put a little fudge on because it"s strong!  The recipe of the fudge is 1/2 cup of chocolate chips,3/4 of a cup of marshmallows that have been heated in a microwave ( I heated mine up for 20 seconds),2 table spoons of butter,1/2 cup of milk, and a 1/2 table spoon of sugar.  Cook in a saucepan under low heat,stirring constantly until smooth. Cool for a  minutes then put on cupcakes!

The flavor of these was very good. I wish I could figure out how to get the top to stop cracking. Makes them messy to eat and difficult to frost - for those of us who think a "cupcake" is not complete without frosting :)

Was good mostly. Was so light which was nice but I expected a richer brownie. Did get so fluffy that is came up like the picture though. Shouldn't there be baking powder or something? It was just okay.

Yummy and super easy! The only change I made was to add half of the batter into the cupcake paper, sprinkle in a few chocolate chips, then  add the rest of the batter. It gives them an extra chocolatey gooey center.

My husband and I are in Florida for a month visiting our daughter and her family. We rent a home and I don't fully stock all the ingredients I keep in my pantry at home for just a month. We're heading for Sunday dinner at my daughter's home and I came across this simple but yummy recipe while looking for a dessert to make with ingredients I have on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly and added about 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips. I love the crunchy tops of these cupcakes and the soft middle! If you're looking for a fudgy chocolate brownie, these won't do. But they're delicious with a more mellow chocolate flavor and I'll make them again! I did get 23 brownies from the recipe.

Made these yesterday. Followed the recipe and the number made and baking time was right on. They even look exactly like the picture. :-) My husband and I had them for dessert with vanilla ice cream. We enjoyed them and will definitely make them again.

I added 1 tsp cocoa powder and 1/4 tsp baking powder  to the flour.  I also added about 1/4 cup additional chocolate chips.    I don’t know if it made a big difference as this is the first time I have made them.   I think adding a few chopped pecans would be yummy.  My husband text me saying “those were good”.

Very boring. Kind of a light brown color. Very little chocolate taste. I followed the recipe exactly, but they’re not to my family’s taste.

I’m sorry grandma Paige but this recipe is a big no! I decided to give it a chance despite it being vague as anything. And I really wish I didn’t. I don’t know what part of this is brownie maybe it’s the coloring It doesn’t taste anything like a brownie or a cupcake or anything in between. It was just awful I can’t even describe how awful it was just awful. I gave the keys to my mother just to make sure it wasn’t me but now she agrees it’s awful. I don’t know what’s with all these rave reviews saying it’s amazing obviously those people haven’t had chocolate in years. I’m sorry grandma Paige but you need to get out of the kitchen.

I made this and it was absolutely perfect! The only thing I would recommend, is do 3 cups chocolate chips not just 1. Mine needed a lot more chocolate then when they say to

This cupcake is amazing, very moist. I did half of the recipe, but I would have done the entire one, because the cupcakes finished in the same hour I took down from the oven.

Made this recipe and added a full piece of Carmel when 1/2 done - may have been to heavy as they still sunk to the bottom of the cupcake.

The recipe turned out great, but I had to make a small change. We couldn't find baking chocolate chips, so we just used regular ones. We heated the choc chips in the microwave at thirty second intervals (without the butter) and stirred in between each turn.  Then we let it cool. We folded it into the batter then slowly poured in one cup of melted butter.

All my friends liked it but some found it too rich, I don't recommend putting chocolate chips in it as they sink to the bottom and burn! Also the top was weird texture compared to the rest of the tasty brownie

Very good brownies and so easy.  I did add a bit more chocolate chips.  I took half the batter and added about a cup of coconut and chopped pecans.  So, I had a dozen by recipe and about a dozen more with coconut and nuts.  Both turned out very good.  I liked the coconut ones a bit more, but that is just me.  These were so very easy.  Definitely will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly.  these were easy to put together and turned out beautifully.  I checked at 20 minutes and they tested as done.  I didn't have enough to do all of them in large muffin cups so I ended up making 10 mini muffin size.   I tested them first at 10 minutes and they were actually done at 15 minutes.  These turned out cute!  
I agree with other reviewers that I'd like to have a boost in chocolate flavor next time.  My thought is that next time I will stir  some mini chocolate chips into the batter. ( I hate to mess around with the consistency by adding more melted chips or cocoa powder.)  I am  going to frost these with my granddaughter and decorate with dyed coconut and jelly beans to make little Easter Baskets for a cute dessert.

This was soooo good! It was moist and light, but I agree with everyone else, it needs more chocolate! I would have put a yummy chocolate frosting on these if I had time because that would have worked beautifully! Or you could put chocolate chips in the batter. But all in all, it was delicious.

Me and my friend changed the recipe by doing step 3 before step 2.  I feel like that was a necessary  change because the chocolate mixture might have cooled too much.  But besides that this recipe is really good, I suggest it.

The first time I made these, I did add a pinch of salt and a large handful of really good quality mini chocolate chips before baking.  I made half a batch and that made 8 delicious cupcakey brownies.  I wondered what it would be like, the next time I made them, to make them without the cupcake wrappers.  BIG MISTAKE!  BIG, BIG MISTAKE!!  They refused to come out of the cupcake pans resembling anything like a cupcake, just bits and pieces.  I had to take a knife and scrape out the bits and BITS of brownie cupcakes.

NOTE TO SELF!  Next time, make sure to use cupcake wrappers and don't even think of trying to not use the wrappers!!

They were delicious and super yummy the first time I made them and thought a scoop of good vanilla ice cream would really enhance them.

I will never make ordinary chocolate cupcakes again.  So delicious!  One word of advice: fill cups 3/4 full (still makes 18) and add 3-5 minutes to cooking time.  These don't rise like regular cupcakes and they sink in a little after they cool.

Super easy and SO good! They were perfectly crunchy on top while still moist and chewy on the inside. I also added some cream cheese frosting on top and it paired very nicely!

This recipe is nothing short of amazing!  I doubled the recipe for the singing at church. I used dark chocolate chips and I had all the ingredients on hand. It was such a easy recipe to follow. I put them in the oven for 28 minutes and they were perfect!  Keep the recipes coming!!!

Recipe called for 18  cupcake  liners . I made just half the recipe and filled 12 cupcake liners. But maybe my pans were smaller than most . However, they were excellent and everyone who tasted them asked for the recipe. I will definitely make them again!

This recipe was delicious, easy to put together and also made the exact amount as described, that doesn't happen too often!
I will certainly use this recipe again, I used semi sweet chips, but next time I might try, milk chocolate chips or dark chocolate chips. Just to change it up a bit for my chocolate lovers.
Thank you!!

I'm sorry but these were just awful . The first batch  were really dry and tasteless . I threw them out. I made a batch with extra chocolate chips and a pinch of salt and it still was awful. I  usually make the desert for all of the BBQ'S and have   requests for the recipes .

It is chocolate cup cake not brownie chocolate cup cake.  If you want brownie, Reduce the egg to 2, add couple tbs coco powder and couple tbs sour cream, do not over bake. If tooth pick come out clean means over baked for brownie.

This was a fun recipe, i was able to make these with my three little sisters, with things we already had in the house! I would say that they could be more chocolatey, we might add some cocoa powder next time.

I made these for a poker party.  I cut the recipe in half because I was low on ingredients.  I used half milk  chocolate and half dark chocolate to make the chocolate flavor stronger.  I followed the recommendation of others and added a pinch of salt.  Instead of baking regular sized cupcakes, I made mini cupcakes.  I baked for 10 -11 minutes, that's when the toothpick came out clean.  The half recipe made 36 mini cupcakes.  They were delicious and perfect snack size.  I would definitely make these again!

These are pretty good, but if I were to make them again, I'd use dark chocolate chips. Used milk chocolate and they're a little too light colored and sweet.

I substituted 3/4 cup of cocoa for the chocolate chips and 1 cup of sugar and several squirts of stevia for the missing sugar, everything else was the same.  I liked them and will try them again when I have the chocolate chips.  Mine were like chocolate cake. but they were good.
