I rarely give a rating of 3 and in this case, it has nothing to do with the flavor but does have to do with the finished dish. This recipe has so much promise but will need to be tweaked to arrive at a meal that doesn't turn into Lentil Porridge. I been using my Instant Pot for years now but never prepared a lentil dish in it. I followed the recipe exactly as written and the end result was a disappointment. With setting the time at 15 minutes and then allowing for the natural release caused the carrots, celery, and especially the lentil to completely disintegrate. The flavor was fantastic however, my husband & I were so disappointed in the final result. I will be keeping this recipe but next time, I will do a quick release after 10 minutes. Hopefully, that will allow the textures to remain intact.

I didn’t purée it at all, as I like a chunky soup. It was delicious!

This turned out great--very good flavor and filling. I made a mistake and used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, but it still came out well. I added some leftover shredded chicken to my husbands, because he has to have meat.

This recipe is a keeper! I followed directions but  only had regular paprika, not smoked, and added a few red pepper flakes. I used red lentils and used my new InstaPot. My vegan family and I loved it so much and I plan on making much more to freeze. This is a perfect comfort food that warms me up and is filling. The red pepper flakes added a slight "kick" to it. Yum Yum!

Excellent. Will be a regular part of my menu. Used a bit more diced tomatoes to round ingredient to a whole can. It was fine. I like more pepper to spice it up

Just finished making this and it is really delicious! I used a stick blender as the carrots and celery were still large pieces. I didn’t have vegetables broth so I used chicken instead, otherwise I followed it as written and really like it.

Yes.  This was the first time making it so I didn’t make any changes.

It was really very good. I cannot do certain spices, so even without the pepper and paprika it was still tasty.. I am sure once you add that it is even more amazing.

I added chicken stock rather than the vegetable stock.  I gave up ALL meat for Lent and this is a great way to get my protein for the day!

So good! Only changes I made: added an extra can of lentils, added a teaspoon of chili pepper flakes (we like a bit of spice) and cooked the parsley in with it instead of just sprinkling on top at end. I also don't have a pressure cooker so I just cooked it in a pot on stovetop for a few hours instead.

This is a great recipe! However, I do not have an Instant Pot, so used my Crock Pot instead. Also, added equal amounts chicken stock and vegetable broth, so was not vegan. But, was outstanding, nevertheless! Went over very well with the family!
