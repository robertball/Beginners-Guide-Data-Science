This turned out great.  I didn't have any tomato soup so used two cans of tomato sauce.  The only other thing I added was some garlic cloves diced up.  Thanks for a new fav.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  I went home during my lunch break and started preparing for dinner.  I browned a pound of ground beef (w/out the sausage) and threw everything into the crock pot.  By the time I returned home, the aroma was out of this world.  After doing a taste test, I thought it needed some sugar due to bitterness.  With the addition of sugar, I would rate this dish a 5.  Thanks for sharing!  Update:  I made this a 2nd time using a pound of ground sausage & a 1/2 pound of ground beef.  It was even better than the first time.

This recipe was great! Of course I customized, I always customize things.. I didn't use the pork sausage or the stewed tomatoes. I also added a half can of corn, a cup of dried black beans (soaked over night), kidney beans, sugar to taste, a little water as well as a little garlic bit of powder. My boyfriend said it was the best chili he ever had :)

I made this chili the other day.  It was very easy to make.  The house smelled good while it cooked.  Unfortunately the chili had a bad bitter aftertaste.  I am not sure which ingredient caused the bitterness.  I will search on for another easy chili recipe for my slow cooker.

This has got to be the SIMPLEST and tastiest Chili recipe there is!  In the effort to make it true chili, I left out chili beans (those are just a filler).  I swapped the crushed tomatoes for fire roasted diced tomatoes, and left out the onions (allergy reason).  This chili hits the spot!!!

I agree with the previous post. This has a weird bitter taste and bad aftertaste. I was told (as I brought it for a work potluck) that when you cook onions too long, the carmelized sugars start to burn. But, the bites with no onions were delicious! I like the canned tomato soup. It was a great idea.

My wife doesn't usually like my chili, but she liked this one!  I added 2 cloves of garlic and some jalopenos.  I didn't use the tomato soup but added one can of tomato sauce and one can of tomato paste.  It was excellent.

This recipe is great!  I made 3 minor modifications:  browned the onions with the ground beef, added a touch of salt, pepper, and garlic salt to the beef/onion mixture and only used 1 package of chili seasoning. I will defintely make this again!

I put everything into the crockpot last night and it was ready this morning. I also modified it just a little. I put bellpeppers and more meat. I also added a little water to it. I loved it. My husband said he thought it had a burnt taste also and a little to much spice for him. Next time I'll probably leave the onions out or add them maybe a couple of hours before it's done. I'd also only put one seasoning packet next time. Other than that it was a pretty good recipe.

Very tasy and easy - for meat I combined 1/2 pound of ground beef and 2 brats.  Only used one package of seasoning and I didn't have any tomato juice.

I found this chili on this site several years ago and its all I make now.  I have gotten nothing but rave reviews from friends and family.  I make this exactly as written no substitutions and I think its perfect that way.  I often times double it for larger crowds and when I do that I only add 3 packets of chili seasoning.  This freezes well and tastes even better the next day!!  I always serve with cinnamon rolls!!  (cinnamon rolls III from this site)

Same on me for not listening to the reviewers. There is a strange bitter aftertaste to this. 
I will stick to my recipe from now on.

Delicious! This was easy to put together--and fed a family of 4 with leftovers for the next day. My only complaint is that it was too spicy for my taste. I don't like my nose to run while I am eating my dinner...and this sure made it run! Maybe use 1.5 packs of chili powder instead of 2. Otherwise, everyone loved it!
