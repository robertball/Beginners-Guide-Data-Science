I dont' know if the dough will be stiff enough to roll. I think the measurements are off as when I check other similar recipes this has double the sour cream and double the butter for the same amount of flour. Perhaps I will have to bake it like a bar cookie and hope for the best. i will post additional information after baking.

I have made these a lot and have entered them in our local Fair. I have gotten told that they taste like a Loft House cookie when I make them.

Not sweet way too fluffy to roll.
