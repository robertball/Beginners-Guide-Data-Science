My mom used to make this for the holidays and I couldn't find her recipe until now. She also added whipped topping to this to make it fluffier. YUMMY! Thanks:)

I have made this many times for our annual ice skating party. It goes very well with the baked ham and beans that we usually serve. However, I use canned crushed pineapple, well drained, in place of the bananas.

This was really good.  I omitted the bananas since the ones I had were a bit too ripe and I only had 1 can of oranges but it was still a great easy dessert.  I recommend letting the sherbert sit out for half hour or so so that it softens and you don't have to sit there and stir and stir for so long until it melts.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Everybody liked this but said, "Next time leave the bananas out."   Definitely will make again, it's a very pretty salad, adds lots of color to your table!

Great taste!  I used only one can of mandarin oranges and took the juice from the oranges and used towards the water.  I also added some strawberries and chunk pineapple.  Great hit over Christmas.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a great recipe.  It was a bit sweet, but very yummy for a dessert-type salad.

Thanks!

This is a great recipe, but I have 1 comment.  The recipe lists 6 servings.  I divide the recipe into 2 molds and when served as a side dish, there are at least 12-16 servings.

This was very good and easy to make too. I was not able to use all of the sherbet because the mixture became too cool before I was done. I am not sure how you could use the whole pint without reheating the mixture. I used a can of crushed pineapple, one can of mandarin oranges, and two small bananas and it was just the right amount of fruit. I will definitely try this using other flavors.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I purchased the wrong size box of Jello so I had to cut the recipe in half. I think I will try adding pineapple and maybe miniature marshmallows next time. Great recipe thank you.

This is a simple, low fat alternative for a wonderful dessert.  I used sugar free jello  and, like other reviewers omitted the bananas.  We ate this on Easter and my family just loved it.  With a little fat free whipped topping, it reminded me of a creamsicle.  Next time I am going to try a raspberry version.

Not so nice - I had to use frozen yogurt because they don't have orange sherbert here.

Loved it!  We are big gelatin fans, and this dish is very refreshing. I halved the recipe, since only 2 of us were eating it and I didn't want the bananas going brown.  I went to pull out my can of mandarin oranges, only to discover they were peaches.  So this dish was made with peaches, this time, but I have purchased mandarin oranges for the next time. A nice summer salad/dessert.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the family enjoyed it... especially the kids.  Family preference is for nothing "chunky" in the jello salad so left out the oranges and bananas and it was still delicious.  I frosted with cool whip.

I followed the ingredients in the recipe exactly.  Rather than 4 cups of boiling water I drained the mandarin oranges and added boiling water to that liquid to make 4 cups.  The advice of another reviewer to let the sherbet sit out to soften was very helpful.  The first time I made this I had the same problem as another reviewer - using a mold and when I flipped it out it was not firm enough to hold its shape well.  This time, I looked a bit more carefully at the size of my sherbet container.  It is not a quart - it is 1.69 quart.  The first time I tossed the whole thing in.  This time I adjusted and really only used 1 quart.  Problem solved.  It makes a LOT and if you can't use it in a couple of meals the bananas turn brown.  Unless this is for a party, cut the recipe in half!  The flavor of this salad is excellent.  Love the orange, the mandarins and the bananas.  We'll use this again.

Perfect dessert on a hot day.  I used sugar free jello and it turned out fine.  Also drained the mandarin oranges prior to adding them in.

I followed this recipe to the T.  It was very tasty, but I tried to put it in a Jell-O mold.  It seemed to set well, but when I flipped it to a serving plate and set it in the frig, the entire thing collapsed and just kindof "melted" all over my frig.  I poured what remained into a bowl and served it.  I have made a similiar recipe before and never had a problem with the mold.  I don't know what happened!
