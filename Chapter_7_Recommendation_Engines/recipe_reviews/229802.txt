Lovely presentation for a "special" meal dessert.  I agree with the other reviewers that the instructions are very clear about how to make the cornucopias.  The foiled cones actually popped out a little bit from the puff pastry while cooking, making them very easy to remove and leaving perfectly-shaped pastry cones.  And the pumpkin mousse is light and just delicious.  I made the caramel sauce last night,  baked the cornucopias and popped them in a zip lock bag, mixed up the mousse this morning, and filled the cones.  Followed the recipe to the letter, and the only thing I did differently was sprinkle the cones with a cinnamon-sugar mixture rather than just sugar. These definitely have a little bit of a "wow" factor without a whole lot of effort.  Of course, the puff pastry cones are so neutral in flavor that the possibilities for other fillings are unlimited, so let your imagination run wild.

Crafters will love making this!  The directions to this lovely dessert are clear, and it's easy to make, too! I found that regular foil in about 4" wide pieces worked great with the cones that I used (Keebler).  I did find that at 13 minutes of baking the high points of the cornucopias started browning too much while the rest of the bodies weren't quite done yet, so I quickly covered the tops with foil to keep them from burning.  I filled a quart freezer bag with the mousse and cut the corner to fill the cornucopias.   I used Trader Joe's wonderful Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce for the glaze, and I went a little scant on that.  Very nice dessert for a special occasion!  Thanks for this recipe!  It can lead to a variety of variations for future use, and I'll keep the cones for that very purpose!

These are delicious, and do make a beautifully presented dessert!  I found it easier to wrap the strips one at a time instead of pinching two together like the directions state.  The mousse is heavenly!  You could serve it alone in a parfait glass with a drizzle of caramel and chopped pecans, but the puffed pastry cornucopia is what makes this a special dessert.  Fun for kids (older ones can help make this in the kitchen) and fun for adults as well.  I could see this bringing families together and settling feuds in time for the holidays!  Haha, really, it's fabulous, thanks for sharing such a neat idea!

FANTASTIC!!! The idea of using the sugar cones to make the 'cornucpias' is absolute genius, and worked perfectly. The mousse filling is to die for, and I could've eaten the entire bowl, lol, but I'm glad I didn't! These look like a dessert that you may have to spend a lot of time on, but it really couldn't be easier. These will definitely be making an appearance on my Thanksgiving dessert table, not only this year, but from now on~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This dessert is so beautiful! I just loved the presentation. It actually is a lot easier than it looks. When I looked closely at the ingredients I realized I actually had everything but the cones, heavy cream, and puff pastry. Puff pastry is pricey, but the recipe uses only 1 of the 2 sheets in the pack. I layed it out on a Silpat sheet and dusted both sides with flour as suggested. It was very easy to work with, to cut and shape. I realized too late that the cones were only used as a mold. Although, they do work great and the puff pastry pops right off immedietly, cream horn molds would have worked well too. I forgot the sugar topping until the last 7 minutes of cooking. I quickly sprinkled 1 Tblsp on them, and popped them back in the oven, and it worked fine. I used a 1M tip to pipe the pumpkin mousse and it was perfect for filling them quickly and easily. I had bottled Hershey's caramel syrup and didn't want to go out and buy something thicker, in a jar or make something, so I just used that. It was less of a drizzle, but worked fine for me. I also, didn't bother to toast the nuts. I personally, find them bitter when done that way. It saved time too. I would be happy taste and appearance wise to serve this to a small dinner party, especially for Fall or Thanksgiving.

This was a great way to use up pumpkin pie leftovers - turning it into mousse!  That being said, I wish all the ingredients had been fresh instead of processed.  I didn't think I could assemble a dessert like this, and I did!

Great Idea! These were amazing. We loved them. My daughter has requested them for her birthday which is on Thanksgiving this year. Next time I will make a double batch to make sure everyone has some. They disappear fast.

Loved this except the fact that my filling came out a little runner than I thought it would. I hope to make this again with less milk.

The outcome is well worth the effort and a great way to use up extra cones or puff pastry if you have it. It is quite time intensive though but a nice "wow" dish for a special meal.

The pastry was flaky, the filling was light and fluffy, and the extra added touch of the caramel and nuts made this dessert a hit at Thanksgiving!  I will be making these again and again since they are fun to make.

Clear instructions, delicate flavor, perfectly scaled serving for a great finish to a meal.  Though clear, there are quite a lot of steps, so this is definitely for those with the patience and the time to devote to a confection.  Do not skimp on the caramel topping, because it absolutely makes this dessert.  Sorry to come to an empty plate!

Excellent!  Very easy, and that's coming from someone who is a klutz with a pastry bag.  Added 1/8 tsp nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves to the mousse.

These were fantastic...what a wow factor to the end of a dinner.  I made the 'horns' in the morning, then the moose and put them together - do ahead and refrigerate.  Then just heated the carmel and added the pecans.  Only changes I made were added pumpkin pie spice and some brown sugar.  I did use sugar free jello and splenda in place of the sugar.  Did as one last reviewer suggested and topped with a splenda/cinnimon mix on the 'horns'.

Easy to follow directions to a beautiful delicious desert. I did add a few other spices (cloves and nutmeg) but I am sure this would have been just as good without.

My family really enjoyed these pastries - and they were delicious!  But personally, just too much work for a dessert.  Definitely a "presentation" course.  I will keep it in mind for when I really want to impress someone.

Super tasty, impressive yet easy.  I suggest you refrigerate the mousse a little while before filling the cornucopias so it doesn't want to fall out-it worked for me!  The mousse itself is divine, and given the expense of puff pastry (it was $6 a box!!!), I would probably make the mousse again as a stand-alone dessert and save the cornucopias for Thanksgiving and double the recipe for 12 to use the whole box of pastry.  Or if you're really good, make your own pastry.  The video made making these a breeze-I also cut my pastry with a pizza wheel as shown.

I made this as I wanted a lighter Thanksgiving dessert. It was a great hit. I did make a few changes: I used sugar-free vanilla pudding mix, used pumpkin pie spice mix instead of straight cinnamon, and used 1 container of fat-free Cool Whip instead of whipping up cream. This cut calories and fat content and everyone loved it.

Made this recipe the other day where I work.  The Residents and staff LOVED it!  I doubled the recipe and I still ran out.  For a family, it would be great!  I agree with the other reviewer, the pumpkin mouse is luscious!  I could eat the whole bowl (didn't of course!)  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This was so much fun to make and such an elegant looking dessert! As others stated the directions in making the cornucopias was very clear and so easy to make.  The mousse had a nice flavor and wasn't overly sweet in comparison to the caramel sauce.  I think the puff pastry horns would be so versatile.  Pefect for filling with a vanilla creme to make a cream horn or a chocolate mousse.

Wow these are good.  Really not too complicated- just takes a while for only 6 servings.  I sprinkled the dough with a cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking.  The caramel really makes these.  I didn;t add pecans- just warmed up some caramel ice cream topping and generously drizzled it over the top- delicious.

I have been bumped up from merely being "deviled egg girl" to also being "dessert girl" this Thanksgiving, an honor I intend to do justice, so I gave these a trial run tonight.  The instructions are very clear, and the video makes them even more so.  Since this is a sponsored recipe, I probably shouldn't mention that I made my own puff pastry for this endeavor, but there, I said it!  The filling is amazing- who knew something so simple could be so wonderful?  I need to invest in a pastry bag and some tips as I have nothing but trouble with the snipped bag method.  Others don't seem to, but I can never get it right.  Therefore, for the big day I think I will use a small spoon to fill the shells most of the way, and then use the bag to attempt to make the lovely flourish at the end.  I will also make my own caramel sauce instead of the jarred kind.  I can not say enough good things about this dessert- incredibly delicious, delicate and flaky, and impressive and professional looking to boot.  And simple!  Unbelievable how easy!  As others have stated, once you know the method, the possibilities are truly endless- and I don't know about you, but I find that exciting!  I can't wait to make my debut as dessert girl this Thanksgiving- I will be so proud to serve these :)

These are awesome. A little  time  consuming but we'll worth it   and makes an beautiful  presentation. Easiest way to fill them is fill a plastic zip lock baggie with mousse, snip end and pipe into shells.

These were adorable! I took them to a Thanksgiving gathering for a lighter alternative to the pies we had. Very cute!!

These taste wonderful and so impressive looking.  I made exactly as the recipe indicated so I could give it a fair rating.  I found it to be just right and didn't find it necessary to change/add/or subtract anything.  Please try these, they are so fun!

Loved this! Super easy to put together but it looks and tastes like you spent a lot of time on it. We really liked the pumpkin mousse. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the pastry. Skipped the pecans. I would definitely make these again.

Looks great with little effort.  I made the pastry horns the night before and kept them in an airtight container.  I made the mousse the next morning and kept that in the fridge.  Before serving, I quickly heated the horns in a 350 degree oven to crisp them up a bit and then let them cool.  I filled the pastries with the mousse using a ziploc bag that I had cut a corner from and it worked perfectly.  It got rave reviews and was a nice alternative to pumpkin pie.

This was just ok for us.  We didn't love the instant pudding flavor it left behind.  If I make again I will make them with pastry cream.
