This recipe was amazing! I would have given it 5 starts but I made some additions based on other reviewers comments. I fried the bacon in the olive oil instead of adding it at the end. Then I took the bacon out, browned the garlic and threw spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms and italian seasoning into the pan. Then I added the brie to the pan and it melted nicely. I tossed the whole thing with the linguine. mmmmm!

I was really interested to see how this recipe would come out since the reviews seem to be split. What I found is this is a very fresh and light flavor dish, so yes I can see how many of the people reviewing it said it seemed to be missing somthing.  Here are the modifications I made and still remained true to the recipe:   6 slices of bacon, completly cooked and crumbled   1/2 cup-ish of rind-free Brie (extra is good)   2 tbsp lemon juice   2 tbsp italian seasoning   1/2 bag of Organic frozen spinich (yes organic has more flavor)  I cooked and drained the pasta, then returned it to the pan. I added the spinich and brie, stirred it, then cover to let the hot pasta melt the brie and thaw the spinich. Turn the burner on low, add the garlic, bacon, lemon juice and itlian seasoning and a few tablespoons of water so it doesnt burn. Mix occasionally and keep stiring until all ingredients are well mixed.   Dice a fresh tomato and sprinkle on just before serving. Hope this helps you!

Oh and make sure you eat this right away, it doesnt reheat well.

I've never made anything like this before so I dont know if its supposed to be this oily or if I just used too much olive oil/brie cheese. I added tomatoes and mushrooms. I really like this recipe because its quick to make, and you dont necessarily have to measure all ingredients-you can just throw in how much you like, and you dont necessarily have to have all the ingredients in order to make it. I make a lot on the weekend and keep it during the week.

This was a good base recipe. I added mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, crushed red pepper, italian seasoning and garlic salt (because of all the "no-flavor" comments). It turned out to be a really tasty dish that I'll definitely make again!

the recipe should say to remove rind from the brie before you cube it. I have a recipe similar to this that uses southwestern seasoning, (chili powder, Mexican oregano, ground chipotle, paprika, ground cumin)and fresh chopped basil and parsely. I think that would eliminate any blandness. Throwing in some pinenuts for texture would be nice too.

This was great. I added the cheese to the spinach in pan to make sure it melted and it worked great. Also seasoned with parm. cheese. Will make again. Very easy.

This was great. The smokiness of the bacon paired really well with the earthy brie and spinach. I used tri-color veggie pasta spirals and added basil, parsley, smoked paprika, and a lil cayenne. My husband said it was very colorful. Also this was super quick and easy to prepare.

Great idea...  Sounds delicious and I really wanted to love it  but unfortunately it is really lacking in flavor.  I did add some chopped up sundried tomatoes to try to jazz it up a bit but still didn't do the trick.  It's not horrible by any means but really needs some flavor.  Maybe some basil and parsley?  Hmmm.  Thanks for the recipe as it has potential.

Sorry, my family did not care for this at all. I followed the recipe as written - with only the addition of a chopped tomato as suggested by another reviewer. I found it to be very bland. We love brie - so I was excited about using it in a pasta dish having never done so. But, it quickly melted down once added, and there was really no trace of it that could be tasted on the linguine. The only indication of it was the little pieces of skin, which was just sort of strange. I love all of the individual ingredients - but this is missing something. Perhaps more of a pesto instead of plain olive oil - and small chunks of brie sprinkled on top of each serving instead of mixing it in.

Made exactly and was just too bland for us not bad just not good . So we added a bit of fresh basil and salt and pepper and a bit of butter. Then grated fresh Parmesan over and then he loved it but I was still left craving flavor

This was delicious, after a few modifications. I substituted farmer sausage for bacon and added a can of Costco chicken breast for extra protein. I also used rotini egg noodles instead of linguine. I browned the sausage, removed from pan, added a t. bacon fat, 3 pressed garlic cloves and 4 small pearl onions to the sausage fat and browned them. I  added the can of chicken with juice, red wine vinegar, juice of half a lemon, salt to taste, 1 tsp each of oregano, basil, thyme, cayenne pepper, and 1/2 t. rosemary and let it simmer. I then added 2/3 of a bunch of fresh, chopped spinach. I added the juice of the other lemon half and let it stew until the spinach wilted. I then added about 1/2 to 3/4 c. cubed brie. I stirred until it melted  and added the pasta. Added salt and pepper to taste. Topped with parmesan cheese before serving. Was a hit!

This dish was a hit!  My husband and I generally have pretty different food preferences, but he went back for thirds with this one.  

Some adjustments I made or plan to make for next time:  
- half the amount of pasta
- at least 5-6 cups of fresh spinach, it cooks down so much!
- double the bacon (I used 6 pieces and it could have used a more)
- 2 containers of mushrooms, super tasty
- more garlic, but I believe in that for pretty much all recipes
- no olive oil.  

I did not put any olive oil in this time around, because it seemed like it would be too oily.  I'm glad I made that choice! Frying the spinach, garlic, and mushrooms in the bacon grease added a ton of flavor.  

A+ recipe.  I'll definitely be making it again.  In fact, when planning the grocery list for this week, my husband just asked if we could have this meal again while trying the above tweaks.  YES

This was awesome!  I used more garlic, as is my usual.  Also cooked down the spinach in some chicken broth for added flavor.  It was excellent!!!

I have family with celiacs disease so I tried it over jasmine rice and omitted the bacon and instead used olive oil.  I also increase the garlic and added chicken in small cubes and sundried tomatoes and baby bella mushrooms. It was fantastic. the Brie didn't melt quite how I expected, but added a nice creaminess to the dish.

We added halved cherry tomatoes and some extra brie to this.  My husband really liked it, but I thought it was a bit bland...Maybe next time we'll add some extra spices to give it more flavor.

This is a really simple, delicious recipe that I've tried many times, but never the same way.  It's so easy to add what you like and take away anything you don't without ruining the flavor!  Thanks.

Very good! I felt something was missing, though... maybe chopped tomato? I added more spinach (an entire 6 oz bag) and a bit more brie. I didn't use but maybe a dash of olive oil, because the bacon grease made it very moist. Super easy and very nice.
