This is the best vegetable pot pie! I did what someone else said and baked the bottom crust a little first. I also added some Lawry's seasoned salt and a touch of cayenne pepper.. I like hot food. Also I didn't have potatoe soup and used mushroom just as good, plus added a little can of chopped mushrooms to the vegetable mis.I got such great reviews... I am actually making another right now! It is so easy and taste so good!

Very tasty for how easy it was!  And beautiful, too.  I didn't use the egg on my crust and it still looked and tasted wonderful.  Took nearly no time or effort, and was a big hit with my meat-eating boyfriend.  This one goes in my everyday recipe box.

Very quick, tasty & was devoured by my kids (actually there wasn't enough!!).  To cut back on the fat content of using two piecrusts, next time I plan to double the recipe and cook it as a stew on top of the stove with Bisquick dumplings instead.

Fantastic and EASY.  I actually made 6 separate little pies in little tins by splitting up the recipe.  They were a huge hit for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.

I took the suggestion to cook the bottom a little first. Mine was not soggy at all. I only had cream of chicken. Added garlic. Super easy & quick for a busy night. Next time I will leave out the Thyme. I don't care for it. Hubbie loved it but asked where the chicken was. I told him it was a Vegetable Pot Pie . . . Thanks!

This is a favorite in my home. In fact, it is probably THE favorite with most of my family members, which is a little crazy considering how easy it is. I add a package of extra firm tofu prepared as follows: drain and press between paper towels; cut into cubes; add a couple of spoonfuls of all purpose flour plus garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to taste then stir to coat; fry in oil in a skillet until it is golden and the outside is a little crispy; then add to the pot pie filling mix.

Great and quick comfort food with only five minutes of preparation!  As per what I usually try to do, I followed the recipe as is.  It was just perfect.  I had to increase my cooking time by 10 minutes to get the correct crust doneness, but that was it.  It had the really good “pot pie” taste minus the meat.  I could even see myself just adding some chicken next time for the more traditional recipe.  The kids just loved it!  I am actually going to buy small ramekins and make individual portions for their lunches.  Thanks KDCG!

I used (thawed) frozen Italian veggies and I didn't have thyme, so I used fresh rosemary from my garden. This was my first pot pie and it turned out "very good" according to my fiancee. The bottom crust was still kind of doughy, and I kept it in the oven for about 1 hour, but maybe because of my substitutions.
It was so easy and I will surly use it again!

So easy and yummy! I made with only one crust (on the top) to save calories and fat. I also added a can of chicken. 
I loved it but my boyfriend thought there was too much pepper taste.

Very good vegetarian meal!  I used frozen mixed veggies and thawed them in a pot on the stove before draining them and mixing with a can of cream of potato and the milk.  I baked the bottom crust for 5 minutes before adding the filling and I'm really glad I did, it was the perfect consistency.  I skipped the egg glaze and added several other spices.  Next time I'll go a little easy on the spices, but that's my own fault.  Definitely making again, and looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow!

What a great little recipe! I've tried several veggie
pot pie recipes from this site, but this one is the
best. Followed the recipe to a tee other than omitting
the egg wash and subbing sage for the thyme. I also
tried it with cream of celery soup, but it's better with
cream of potato. 5 stars and highly recommended!

Baked bottom crust a little first, added minced garlic.  I must have added way too much garlic... next time I will just use garlic powder.

Easy meal and tastes great - only thing i would do different is less thyme (maybe half?).  1/2 a tsp was overpowering!  I also agree with cooking the crust first - we did for about 5 minutes but we should have cooked it longer.

If you're going to make this you should really try it with good quality frozen veg. I used a combination of cauliflower/carrot blend, brussels sprouts, red/green pepper and onion. Defrost the amount you want to use first (so excess water can be drained). Dry adding a bay leaf to the soup.  4 stars with these changes. This dish freezes well.

This recipe is very simple, flexible and easy to prepare. I used a cup of frozen mixed vegetables plus one cup of steamed broccoli florets and cream of mushroom soup. I also used less thyme  (like previous reviewers). Next time, I think I will try using more steamed chopped vegetables (time permitting!) because the frozen veggies did not taste as good, but overall, this made a great lunch when I heated it up again today. I would definitely make this again.

Great base recipe.  I used phyllo pastry instead of the pie shells and made individual pies, and substituted vegetable stock for milk.  I'll definitely keep using this one, and play with the spices and veggies.

I was skeptical about this recipe, even after reading the reviews. I shouldn't have worried! It was great and so easy! I was stunned and I got rave reviews on it.

 I did change up a few things though, I lessened the milk a touch to make a thicker filling, left out the egg, used refigerated pie dough, baked the bottom crust for about 15 mins and played with the spices. 

I put in 3/8 tsp of the Thyme, instead of 1/2tsp. Added Lawrey's seaoned salt, garlic powder and dill. The dill was probably the best additive. 

I will definatly be making this again. Great for a cool fall night!

I have since taken another reviewer's advise and make it in soup/stew form, no crust. But I do serve it with cheddar rosemary biscuits on the side.

This was delicious.  I used a 12oz bag of frozen mixed veggies with broccoli and carrots and waterchestnuts. Also, I added about a 1/2 bag of thawed hashbrowns.  It was a hit... and so easy to make.

Thank you SO much, I recently became a vegetarian and missed pot pies as one of my favorite foods. I didn't have any potato soup and used mushroom instead, still turned out great.

This is a good recipe to use as a starting point b/c you can change it up any way you like. I used pre-made pie dough, threw in some fresh thyme and rosemary (instead of dried herbs) and used frozen veggies I like (broccoli, peas and corn). Next time I'll make more filling by doubling the potato soup and even more veggies. There were no leftovers!

Easy weeknight meal. My husband & 2-year-old son loved it. I baked the bottom shell while I prepared the other ingredients (about 5 min.) and it turned out well. Also added 3/4 can of sliced mushrooms - otherwise, I stuck to the recipe & it was great!

This is great comfort food for vegetarians! And its sooo easy! I have made it many times I use frozen mixed veggies for canned. I bake the bottom crust for a few minutes before I add everything and I use less pepper. Sometimes ill add  ½ cup of shredded cheddar cheese for a little more flavor.

I just made this and it was totally awesome and really easy!  I gave it four stars because I wish it had a little more flavor.  I think next time I'll add some tofu for protein and more veggies.  It's a great meal to make for a broke college kid like myself.  Fabulous!

I make this all the time - simple, fast, easy, and it works with whatever I have. I usually use frozen vegetables. A perfect easy recipe for a winter evening.

This recipe was terrific! I have been searching for a good vegetarian pot pie for some time and this is the best I have made. Easy...moist...yummy. Instead of canned mixed vegetables, I steamed brocolli florets and carrots cut into coins until tender and added a can of drained corn. Regarding the ground black pepper...I used less than a 1/4 tsp. and it was just right.

We loved this dish.  I did use more vegetables than what was called for.  I used a 29 oz. can of Veg-all Homestyle mixed vegetables, which are the large cut size.  I also left out the egg and thyme.

My husband is a vegetarian. It's hard to find refreshing new things that don't involve pasta, rice or beans! He absolutely LOVED this and asked for it once a week during the winter season... that is rare!  I did make a couple of modifications. I added a half a can of cream of mushroom and some Morning Star Crumblers! Even our children loved it! Thank you!!!

Excellent pot pie. Used the suggestion of others to bake the bottom crust for 10 minutes before filling. Thawed a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and added a can of creamed corn instead of using the milk. Otherwise followed the rest as instructed. We loved this. Will definitely make again.

I added salt to the ingredients and made my own crust for four individual pot pies, which extended the total time to make it. Made it last night and just had it for lunch. It was actually pretty good.

I too added a can of chicken and some chopped potatoes. Big mistake was using frozen veggies and not thawing. If you do  use frozen... either defrost or plan on a longer cooking time at a lower temp... protect the edges of the crust. But holy cow.... not only Easy But flexible!

Pro's: (1) Extremely simple to make.  (2) Ingredients costed me $7 to make.  (3) Took minimal time!  

//

Note:  I followed the recipe almost exactly but I followed the suggestion that I should bake the bottom crust a little bit first.  This made for a mildly stronger crust. I stuck it in there for about 5 minutes then took it out to add the filling and top crust.  

//

CONS:
(1) However, doing so did make it a teensy bit more cumbersome to try to "seal" the two pie crusts together because the bottom crust was a little dry.  (2) The call for 15 ounces of vegetables was unclear.  I purchased a can of 15 ounces of chopped vegetables, but when you drain it, it is a lot less.  After cooking this pie, I found it to be a little on the thin side (could be good if you like a higher crust to filling ratio if you don't mind the fat).  I would say 20 ounces of veggies would be better.  (2) Due to the fact that I possibly used fewer vegetables than I could have, the pepper to filling ratio was rather high, so there was a strong pepper taste.  If you're using 15 ounces of veggies (undrained), I would say just use 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons of pepper.  (3) Could use a little bit of salt.

//

Otherwise, I thank you for this recipe.  It was a delight to make.  Please see my photos :)!

This was easy and delicious. Due to lactose intolerance, I replaced the 1/2 cup of milk with 1/2 cup of creamed corn. It was great!!!

Very good! I added some salt and parsley and used frozen veggies that I steamed before hand. So good! Made it for Christmas dinner last year and it was a hit with all the non-vegetarians (I'm the only one in my family). It's in the oven now and I'm drooling with anticipation!

This was a fantastic meal, it was so easy, I also followed the advice of others and baked the pie shell for about 7-8 mins before I added the filling.  I also added only half the thyme as I am not a big fan of that herb, but I subbed the thyme with dried basil.  My husband who was very reluctant to try the recipe ended up loving it!  Try this recipe its an amazing vegetarian recipe.

I love recipes like this that you can use as a *base* for your own ideas... I used frozen vegetables, cream of celery soup, thyme and sage, and used a cheese biscuit recipe, rolled out as the crust. Five stars from the family!

This was great, however I made a few small changes.  I used homemade pie crust, (and by the way, ONE crust will suffice for this recipe). I also used frozen veggies, which I defrosted in the microwave before adding.  I omitted the thyme and used dried dill instead. FINALLY, I added 1 egg to the soup mixture.  Baked up tasty!

This will be a regular dish at my house! So easy to make and very satisfying. I'm a vegetarian but my husband is a meat eater and he even loved it. Instead of canned veggies, I used fresh...about a cup of broccoli florets, a cup of carrots cut into thin medalions, and a cup of green beans cut in half. The thyme was a tiny bit too strong for my taste, I might cut down a bit next time. The ready made pie crust worked well. I covered the edging of the crust with a "pie protector" about half way through and it kept it from browning too much.I can't wait to experiment and try it with cream of mushroom soup, different vegetables, and maybe even some cubed firm tofu.

This was a great recipe and is even better if you add a little vegetarian cheese (unless you are vegan of couse!). I made it with asparagus soup and the whole family loved it.

I used Chunky Potato Cheddar Bacon soup and a can of mixed veggies and added a pat of butter, along with thyme and sage.
Very good and hearty!
I can see experimenting with any creamed soup or maybe even a Corn Chowder next time!

I have made this recipe several times since first trying it out and it has been a big hit with vegetarians and meat lovers alike. I use puff pastry to create a top crust only pot pie, and the magic number seems to be 400 degrees for puff pastry. A sheet cut to size, laid over the top and slit to steam baked at 40 minutes will be lightly brown. I will leave it in a bit longer and peek at it until I get a nice golden brown on the crust. The filling is creamy and delicious, I steam frozen vegetables until tender while mixing the potato soup base and then add the vegetables to the base to season and finish cooking through to let all of the flavors blend together. My secret to making this dish universally loved by meat lovers is to use rotisserie chicken seasoning and a bit of pepper. This gives the pie a distinct similarity to a regular chicken pot pie while still remaining vegetarian friendly! Because I use puff pastry to make this extra decadent, I do recommend letting the filling cool before laying over your top crust to keep the pastry from being doughy in the center. Cooling the filling allows the pastry to puff correctly in the oven! I have used cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, peas and corn for a hearty vegetable filling. I even added red peppers once for a twist. This is so easy and delicious!

Wow, we all had seconds, even my daughter who is in an "I hate all vegetables!" phase loved it so much she asked for it every night. 
I made a few alterations based on other reviews, and my own personal tastes. I used a homemade crust, half the amount of milk, half the amount of pepper, and instead of thyme I used a good sprinkling of garlic powder, seasoned salt, and Krogers Zesty Seasoning Blend. I also baked the pie for closer to 45 minutes, and it came out perfect and delicious, we will definitely have this again soon!

This was my first time making/eating a veggie pot pie. The store did not have cream of potato so I substituted for cream of mushroom. I also did not use the egg. The final result was tasty! It's not packed with flavour however, but good enough for me.

Really good! I used this as a starter recipe. I did add garlic powder but I also made my own potato soup by adding single cream and mashed potatoes and adding frozen peas, sliced carrots, mushrooms, and fake chicken. Will be making it again!

We're big fans of this at my house. We only did the bottom crust the first time we made it. Like others, I recommend cooking it before adding the filling. However, we felt like it was a bit too much crust for our taste and have since moved to a top crust only. We use fresh veggies in place of the canned mixed veggies. I pan fry all the veggies first before mixing with the soup. This recipe is pretty forgiving and can be adapted pretty easily. I do think the cream of potato soup is what makes it and wouldn't change it for anything else.

I found this recipe because my brother wanted to make him a veggie pot pie like the frozen cheddar broccoli one that Amy's has. I used this as a base recipe and made a few changes. I used fresh veggies (carrots, potatoes, broccoli and onions) instead of the canned ones. I cooked them in the microwave for about 7 minutes but will do a little more time next time because they were still a tad crunchy. Instead of thyme, I used a good amount of paprika and pepper and a dash of mustard powder, salt and garlic. I also added about a half a stick of butter. After I piled all the veggie mix in I did a layer of cheddar cheese about 1/2 inch thick between the filling and the crust. Didn't stay together well once cut but delicious and beautiful. I made my own crust and the bottom got a little soggy so next time I will bake that a little before with another layer of cheddar cheese on the bottom. My brother loved it, though :)

I made this the other night and it turned out better than expected!  I figured that because it was so simple, it would just a typical, boring dish...but it was actually really good.  Very tasty - the child even liked it!  I'll definitely make this again and again.

I did use frozen vegetables instead of canned, and I didn't brush with an egg because I didn't have eggs on hand.  I also didn't measure spices (as per usual; I'm very liberal with my spices).

My husband and I love Amy's pot pies, the only vegetarian one available.  This recipe fulfills our yearning for pot pie at the drop of a hat.  I made these changes: used herbs de Provence instead of thyme (just to experiment), didn't use the egg, added a can of white kidney beans (Ialways add a bean), used evaporated milk (had one open in fridge and had no regular milk) and used Pillsbury crescent roll sheets (all I had).   I threw it together in minutes at commercials and it came out with a flaky crust and creamy, savory filling.  Bake the bottom crust for at least 10 minutes before filling!  Warm the filling in the microwave for a few minutes before filling and putting on top sheet.  I used low, square Corning Ware casserole dish and baked at 375 for 20 minutes.  Heavenly meal with pantry staples in almost no time at all.  My kind of meal!!  And the variations possible are endless.

This was my first time making a pot pie and it came out delicious!! I ate almost half the pie myself. I changed somethings. I used fresh broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and mushrooms and canned peas. I also used 2 cans of cream of potato soup and 1 cup of almond (unsweetened) almond milk. I steamed my veggies first and sauteed them with an onion and 1 1/2 tbs of minced garlic. I also added some garlic salt. I had enough filling for two pies, at the rate I'm going will be gone soon. 

I love this recipe as it's a great base recipe for any pot pie. You can play around with cream of corn, mushroom and potato soups and add in any veggies you want.

Excellent!  I was a little nervous how this would turn out, but it is very very good.  I would next time cook the bottom crust like the other reviewers suggested, but even without doing it it was fine after it set up.  I used fresh pie crust and there is really such a variety of veggies and soup variations you could switch up using.  I will make again!

As a vegetarian, I was on the lookout for a pot pie, and this is it.  It's easy to make, even on a weeknight (so long as you have the pie crust thawed beforehand!).  I've also used the filling with homemade crust with excellent results.  I usually cut the thyme in half and add 1 teaspoon of minced garlic which goes great with the ingredients in the filling.  I have also added small chunks of cheddar cheese for a dairy and protein serving.  Thank you for this recipe!

Pie was very good. A few changes: used 3-inch deep 7x7-inch casserole dish. Did not bake bottom crust as intended, yet it was not mushy. Due to depth of dish, baked pie 1 hour. Bottom crust did not touch top edge of dish, which was good. Added mixture, top crust, and fluted edge. Covered edge with aluminum foil to prevent burning, baking 40 minutes. Uncovered edge, baked additional 20 minutes. Used ingredients on hand (12 oz bag of frozen mixed veggies + 1 handful frozen corn, cream of mushroom soup, refrigerated prepared pie crusts - kept on counter 10 minutes, as pkg directed, before rolling out). Didn't use thyme or black pepper nor did I brush top crust with egg. Pie was beautiful at end of bake; very pleased with results. Enjoyed making this - thanks for sharing.

So easy, so fast, and so good.  I used a 16 oz bag of frozen mixed vegetables, just because I prefer frozen.  I think the thyme adds a great flavor.  I made my own pie crusts using the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site, which is very easy and very tasty.  Crust plus filling only took me about 15 minutes and the pie was in the oven.

This was quick and cheap to make! Use very little thyme. I added rosemary and a touch of garlic powder. Also cooked the bottom crust 7 minutes first, as suggested by someone else. My family raved over this they couldn't believe that it was all veggie no meat! They love it! It is a keeper!

Easy, inexpensive, comforting warm meal!  We loved it!  The husband of course requested I add some chicken next time but I loved it with just the veggies myself.  This is a keeper and definitely part of my winter comfort food rotation.

Since I used several substitutions, I hate to rate the original recipe. I used Cream of Mushroom Soup as others suggested.  I substituted Mrs Dash for thyme and used frozen vegetables (my family is not big on canned veggies)that I had cooked for about 5 minutes in the microwave. Once cooked in the pie, they were not mushy and had a nice flavor.  I would experiment with other seasonings if I made it again.

I love this recipe! I have made it 3 or 4 times already, but when I went to the store I couldn't find regular, 9 inch pie crusts, so I had to use the deep dish pie crusts. Now I use those every time I make this recipe. I just use two cans of cream of potatoe soup and a bunch of veggies, usually whatever I have on hand, fresh or frozen.

This was SO easy!  I used cream of mushroom soup to add more flavor.  Next time I'll try making my own crust, and will also cook the bottom crust a bit before adding filling...it seemed a little soggy.   
My son and I each ate one piece, and my husband devoured the rest in one sitting!

This was really good!  Instead of using 2 can of mixed veggies, I put fresh carrots, broccoli, & zucchini in the blender and chopped them up and added a can of corn... I also used a can of cream of mushroom and the can of cream of potato.  Everyone loved it...thanks for the recipe!   My son sprinkled cheese over his and he went back for seconds!  GREAT!

This was excellent. I don't like canned vegetables, so I used fresh. I sauteed broccoli, carrots, onion, and celery until just tender. Added everything together with the addition of 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. Baked for 50 min. Was delicious! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is getting rave reviews! Changes that I've made:
The filling amount seems wanting, so I added an additional can of potatoe soup (but I kept the amount of milk the same), and because the mixed vegetables were heavy on carrots, I also added a 15 oz. can of Mexican Corn.
I added a very light dusting of nutmeg to the filling mixture as well as 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper.
Next time I think I will sautée some onion and celery for additional flavor.

this was very nice, but pretty basic.  I added a few little bits and bobs, and it came out very nice.  I sauteed a small, chopped onion and a clove or so of garlic then warmed the frozen mixed vegetables through in the same pan.  Included some Italian seasoning, and only used the top crust.  Very nice and the hubby went back for seconds---thanks!!

My husband loves this, and when the husband loves something, you keep it! I saved this recipe into my favorites. Now, the only thing I would change would be the dried thyme. Instead I put garlic powder, italian seasoning, and onion powder. Because this fantastic cook made this recipe so easy, you can do absolutely what you want with the flavor part of it, and I love that.

It was very easy, but I found the thyme was overpowering. I think that if the thyme had been halved, it would've been a better compliment to the dish.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  The amount of pepper was a little too much, but other than that I think this recipe is just perfect.  I may play around with different soups, vegetables, etc, but I love it exactly as written.

When you are looking for something easy to make, this is it! There was way too much black pepper in it for my family's taste, so I'll cut that in half next time I make it.

This came out beautifully. My husband said he could eat it either night.  I like this recipe better than the chicken one; however, I add chicken!

This turned out GREAT!  I did change a few things: used frozen peas, steamed some carrots, and sauteed onions and mushrooms for in place of the mixed veggie can.  Also, I followed recommendations by previous posters and reduced the thyme and pepper.  Cooked the bottom crust for 6 minutes prior to putting in filling.  Really happy with the outcome and will definitely be making again.

This was extremely delicious. My family loved it. I would next time add 1/4 tsp of pepper. Half of the family thought it was too hot. Also I doubled the recipe with using 2 (9") prepared pie crusts.

This is delicious! I used frozen vegetables instead of canned (just ran them under hot water first), used several pinches of an Italian seasoning herb mix because I had no thyme, and soy milk because I don't have milk. It came out SO SO good! Haven't had a pot pie since I went vegetarian 5 years ago and now I'm addicted! Made it two nights in a row! However, I can't seem to make the top pie crust stay up...the middle sinks down so it's an inverted pot pie. If anyone has advice on how to avoid this, please let me know. :)

The recipe only made enough to fill one deep pie shell. Therefore I expected to need to bake this longer...yet after 1h20 it was still too watery. Next time I will leave out the milk or only put in half as much. However, it tasted great, was SUPER easy and could be changed for variety by varying the type of soup, spices, and vegetables used. I am definitely trying this again.

So I modified this recipe- I made my crust (flaky pie crust recipe from this site) used it on top only- cooked up some potatoes and frozen carrots and peas in a pan then added a touch of poultry seasoning, cream of broccoli and about 1/2 can of lentils for protien- turned out really nice! Maybe a bit more work than the original but still easy!

Loved this simple recipe to get me started. I used some fresh brocolli, cauliflower and chickpeas on top of about 1/3 can of mixed vegetables and it was great. Even better the second day. If you don't have milk on hand or want a little more juicyness to the inside, try using a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil!

"That was better than what you could get at Cracker Barrel!"
My changes- based on "on hand" ingredients-
Substituted a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and about 1 cup of frozen diced potatoes instead of canned.  
Sauteed 1/2 chopped onion in butter, and 1 small chicken breast. Then added cream of chicken soup instead of potato,  defrosted veggies, about 2/3 cup of leftover gravy from the other night plus the milk to saute pan. 
Added fresh chopped garden oregano, parsley and basil.
Recipe took about 20 min max to prep.  5 min to eat!  YUM!

This was an easy recipe and just what I was looking for.  I used a bag of mixed Italian veggies (thawed, of course) based on someone else's recommendation in the reviews.  A little bit bland for my tastes though.  Next time I would probably add some garlic or other spices.

I might try it again (with less pepper), because it is one of the easiest meals to ever make.

I was almost too intimidated to make my own homeade chicken pot pie (i am not the worlds best cook) but I am so glad that I went for it.  Yum!  I used frozen peas and corn instead of canned cause thats what I had (cooked them first before adding to soup mixture.)  I also had fresh carrots so I cut up and cooked those and added them in.  I also used a boxed pie crust instead of frozen- again, cause that's what I had.  I took the advice of baking the bottom crust for a little first- about 6-7 minutes.  Oh, also added precooked packaged chicken strips- cut up- cause my husband is definitely a meat eater.  I liked it with the chicken, but I have to say, it would probably have been just as good without.  A definite keeper!

So easy & delicious!  My 4 year old loves to help me cook and this was one great for her!  

We made the following substitutions:  a pinch of Lawry's and a pinch of McCormick's Perfect Pinch Rotisserie Chicken Seasoning instead of the thyme, Cream of Mushroom soup instead of potato soup and used only 1 pastry crust.  We also diced up two small potatoes and added them to the mix.  Oh, and used frozen vegetables (2 cups) instead of a can.

We rolled out 1 pastry crust and cut it into 4 pieces.  We rolled them out into circles.  We then sprayed ramekins with non-stick spray and filled them with the filling and topped each with the pastry.  

As my little girls would say, "It's a keeper!"

I made this tonight and loved it!  I am vegetarian and did add some Quorn brand chick'n tenders. Yum!  I also cut out the thyme and pepper completely and used 1 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning, a dash of powdered garlic and less than 1/16 tsp of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I did use the egg wash, which gave the crust a beautiful golden color.  I forgot to bake the bottom crust first for 5 minutes per other reviewers, but luckily it turned out nicely anyway.  It was wonderful to have a pot pie again as a vegetarian and have it be so good!

Super easy and very satisfying. I lighten it up by omitting the egg, using fat-free milk, and only using one pie crust (on top). Instead of canned veggies, I use frozen vegetables - 24 oz, or 1 1/2 large bags. Fills your kitchen with amazing smells, and travels/reheats well, too.

I love this recipe.   It's my go-to for simple meals.  I love that it has so many endless possibilities too.    My favorite way to prepare it is with a bag of frozen stew veggies.  I cook them up in some veggie stock and drain before I add them to the can of soup mixture.    This fall and winter I want to try this without pie crusts but instead with a big fluffy topping of drop biscuits.

Amazingly good for such a simple recipe. I love pepper, but you really need to cut it down a bit- maybe to 1/4 teaspoon. I plan to add a few more herbs the next time around.

I was amazed at how tasty this recipe was, considering how easy it was to make! The only thing I would change is I would decrease the amount of Thyme to only 1/4 tsp because it was a little overpowering. Other than that, I added a little salt in the mixture and it came out great! THANK YOU!

This is a great pot pie! I bake the bottom pie crust for seven minutes, which makes it perfect. I use cream of potato soup, frozen peas and carrots, fresh broccoli and garbanzo beans (chickpeas) along with thyme and a tiny bit of black pepper. If you're using fresh vegetables, make sure to lightly steam them before using. My husband and I love this!

I love pot pie.  This recipe is basically how I do it except I add Quorn Vegetarian Chicken Nuggets, frozen mixed Vegetables, Tater Tots, and instead of canned soup mix, I make vegetarian Gravy (some I put in the pie and some to put over when served).  Here is the recipe: 1/2  C Flour 1    C Nutritional Yeast Foods 1/2  C Vegetable Oil 3    C Water Or Veggie Broth 6    tbsp Tamari Or Soy Sauce 1 1/2tsp Garlic Powder 1    tsp Thyme  For the vegetarian gravy:  Prepare gravy by mixing all gavy ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat untill a nice, thick, gravy-like consistency is achieved.  It comes out best if made in a nonstick pan.

This is DELICIOUS and so easy to make! I used frozen veggies instead of canned,  added a few mushrooms, subbed the milk for chicken broth  and omitted the egg. I also seasoned to taste instead blindly adding the pepper and thyme; I used a little of both as well as a dash of salt, onion and garlic powders.

I LOVE this recipe!  Instead of chicken I use a vegetarian substitute (Quorn Tenders) and rather than the canned veggies, I put in a fresh mix of asparagus, peas, onions, carrots, and mushrooms.  It is one of our favorite meals!

Yummy and easy! I added about a half of a package of frozen hash browns. My kids didn't really like it, actually they wouldn't even try it. My husband said it was the best pot pie he had ever tried. I liked it but since my children didn't I won't be making this one again.

Quick, tasty, and easy! I didn't use all the milk to keep my pie nice and thick. I also used a quick homemade crust for the bottom and a crumble crust on the top. Delicious.

Tonight I am making this for the second time. We love it and its sooooo easy. I omit the Thyme bc its not something I usually keep in my cabinet and I S&P to taste, as usual.
I recommend this to any vegetarian or someone just looking for an easy hardy meal for the family.

This was awesome!  I'm a vegetarian and it's hard to find "normal" recipes for my family.  I used frozen organic veggies (cooked most of the way first)and added chickpeas for protein. I did have to make my own crust since store bought ones aren't vegetarian, which is kind of a pain, but that's my problem! Hightly recommended vegetarian comfort food!

This recipe was great, and so easy.  I did make some modifications, which my family very much liked.
I added precooked chicken pieces to make this a chicken pot pie.
I also left out the Thyme and added some grated parmesean cheese, oregano and onion powder to taste.

This was great but needs a few modifications. If you are not a person who uses salt and pepper, it will be quite a bit peppery. Also, the bottom crust was doughy. Next time I will bake it for 5-10 minutes before adding the filling.

Yum! I added an egg and a little cheddar cheese to the filling.
Some things I might try in the future that other reviewers suggested - using a different cream soup, making a whole wheat crust, or using fresh steamed veggies.

This was a great recipe you could add just about any veggie to this and it would be great.  I made a whole wheat crust for this and it complimented the filling really nicely.  My three-year old and my husband both loved it.  What a nice comfort food.

I've made this a few times now. It is simple and works with whatever veggies or cream soup you happen to have. At my hubby's request, I tried making it with a layer of mashed potatoes and cheese on top instead of the second pie crust (his mum made shepard's pie this way). This turned out well. Thanks for the recipe!

So good and SOOOOO easy!!! 

I used cream of mushroom this time, but I'll probably use cream of chicken next time. I think any cream soup would work very well in this recipe. I did add some grilled chicken breast. I will probably omit it the next time around. It was plenty filling enough with just the veggies! This recipe is a great base! You really could change it up very easily! 

Oh, but you definitely will want to use a deep dish pie crust & two cans of mixed veggies. One just wouldn't be enough. And you could certainly add any veggie you want to it. 

Great recipe!! Give it a try!

This was really good and definitely hit the spot. I did make a few changes. Like other reviewers, I used cream of mushroom soup instead of potato. I also left out the thyme and instead used onion powder and salt. I cut the pepper down to 1/4 tsp, but next time would use even a little bit less. I also added about 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese (my family loves things cheesy). And last, instead of egg, I smeared some margarine on the crust. Very quick and tasty!

Okay, so I took the base of this recipe, but I will still rate it.  I found that I didn't have any pie crust and didn't have time to make one so I just made some drop biscuits with bisquik.  I took a can of mushroom soup, a can of mixed vegetables, half a can of vegetable broth and half a can of diced tomatoes and heated it on the stove with the thyme and black pepper.  It was awesome.  we just crumbled the biscuits and topped it with the "soup".  My hubby loved it and so did my 3 yr old.  Not quit the recipe, but really really good!  Thanks!

I used my own vegetables (boiled broccoli, potatoes, peas, celery) in lieu of canned, less thyme, and the 'Crust for Veggie Pot Pie' recipe instead of store pie crusts... it took a little longer, but it turned out  well.  Easy to make and yummy~

What a truly fast and easy recipe. I used cream of muchroom soup and a variety of thawed out to room temp frozen veggies. I also used only 1 crust folded in 1/2. (Like a pastie) Next time Im going to try using reduced sodium soup, and I'll also add all the required milk. I didn't this time, and it dried out a little but was still great!!!

This was a very delicious recipe.  Instead of the canned vegetables (which would have been good too, if I was short on time).  I steamed up some peas, corn, and broccoli.  Then I threw in some canned carrots and whole white potatoes.  Used cream of chicken soup and I had to use powdered milk because I was out of fresh milk.  Not sure how much vegetables I put into the pie.  I just eyeballed it to make sure that the veggies looked even (not too much of one kind of vegetable).  It was at least twice as much as 15 ounces worth, I really filled up that pie crust.  My husband loved this recipe.

Delish! This was so easy to make and it tasted great! It's best when you let it cool for a while. Don't use freshlly ground pepper; it over powers the thyme.

This recipe was great!  I'm a college student, and it was really easy to make at my co-op, and everyone loved it.  We're even adding it to the menu for dinner one night for 100 people.  I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of potato, and it worked out well.  It also might be a good idea to steam the veggies first (especially if you add potatoes) so it doesn't take as long to cook.  Thanks for the good idea.

This was really easy, but I've had better tasting.  For the time it took to prepare, it was very good.

My husband is a vegetarian and we find it hard to get him filling meals like you can buy in England. I made this recipe modifying the ingredients (I used cream of mushroom soup and mixed veg and homemade crusts). He loved it. I would make it again using various cream of whatever vegetable soup mixes. Great!

I didn't have cream of potato soup so used cream of celery & chopped up a potato. Since thyme can be strong & to make the texture better we used ground thyme at around 1/8 tsp which was just right. You could use thyme leaf also. I only put the crust on the top as I only had 1 on hand. Will make again & may try adding chicken & mushrooms while trying as others suggested herb de prov.

It was so easy and surprisingly good. I will definitely make it again. I put the crust in the oven as others suggested, but only for 5 minutes. Next time I’ll put it in for a few additional minutes. Next time I will also add additional filling

Quick, easy, and delicious. Perfect for a cold fall/winter night. This is now on our weekly/biweekly dinner rotation. Has a real homemade taste and aroma, which is nice after a hard work day.
I use Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts (which we buy, freeze, and thaw) and Campbell's cream of potato soup. I play with the canned vegetables. Right now, Del Monte Vegetable and Bean Blends- California Style is a hit (note that it has white kidney beans in it- which work). I agree with other reviewers: bake the bottom pie crust a little first- I do just a few minutes- until it's starting too brown- not too much).
Highly recommended for people who want something warm and cozy (without meat) and don't really have loads of time to spend cooking (or even if you do!). Thanks for this great recipe!

I make this all the time. One of my 20m old just scraped his plate clean with his fork. Huge hit with my kiddos and myself. It’s definitely a household fav. I do skim a little bit of the thyme and pepper off, I use the 1/2 tsp but I take a little out. Same with the milk.

Easy and fast recipe. We loved it, other than the thyme flavor being a bit too overpowering. Will cut the thyme in half in the future, because we’ll definitely be making this again!

Super yummy and super easy. I used frozen veggies and threw them in with the other ingredients without thawing-no problem. I also added fresh diced mushrooms I had in the fridge. I may have used too much pepper (eyeballed it) but it was good with heavy pepper. Will make again and I’m pumped for leftovers tomorrow!

After eating the leftovers I recommend using more soup to keep it from drying up.

This was a really simple, great recipe!  I really do NOT like to cook so I was looking for something very simple that would also accommodate a vegetarian.  5 minute prep, 40 minutes cooking, it was really great!  And, I have already made it again for another set of guests who weren't vegetarians and they loved it!  I did add salt and reduce the amount of thyme.  The next time I make it I think I will try another herb altogether!

I made this as the recipe called for.  It's fabulous and it lasted only a day we kept going back for more. I did however find the black pepper and that I'm a little overpowering for my taste I will definitely make again and cut those down maybe to half or 3/4 what is called for

Not a fan. The milk made this way too runny and too much pepper made it spicy. I would suggest skipping those 2 ingredients for a thicker mixture.

This is a great recipe. I've made it as is and have also done versions which included chicken and wild foraged mushrooms (Maitake). Herbs de Provence are great in lieu just using thyme. Precooking the bottom crust for about 6 minutes first also helps.

I've made this a couple of times now, and love it. The flavours are delicious and it is an extremely easy recipe to make (perfect for someone like me, who doesn't like to spend hours prepping meals).
 I followed the recipe, did as some others did and pre-baked the bottom crust for a few minutes, and I also added some fresh chopped asparagus (had some on hand) as well as some garlic powder, and a bit of frozen corn and peas. I added an extra 5 minutes baking time because of this. Came out perfectly.  Wonderful recipe!

So, so easy and so good. As suggested by others I cooked the bottom crust for a bit. Next time I’ll add a little less of the pepper. Pepper was a little too much and husband agreed. Will certainly be making this again and experiment with the spices.

This was a hit with my vegetarian family :D It was quick and easy to put together. I omitted the egg wash and halved the black pepper but otherwise followed the recipe; I’m glad to have halved the pepper since one of my kids still complained of it being a touch spicy. It was tasty, though next time I will try it with homemade crust and homemade potato soup - it tasted a little more processed than I prefer.

This is a very good base recipe.  I used store-bought pre-made pie dough and baked the pie in a glass pie plate.  The crust came out incredibly flaky and more like homemade, as opposed to using frozen pie shells. The only other change I made is that I added leftover rotisserie chicken along with some garlic and onion powder. This recipe is a keeper, and I will use it again.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my vegan sister so I outed out milk with rice milk and left out egg and butter. It was a hit with her she loved it and I think the rice milk made it sweet and savory. I over all love this recipe and would do it all over again.

its soooo good!! I like it best with the egg brushed on. I also substituted the milk for a vegetable stock and it adds a lot of flavor while removing some fat from the dish. the potato soup makes it plenty creamy.

Really good! Made my own potato soup with celery, onion, potato,  chicken boullion, water,  milk...cooked down to a mashed concentrated state, quite thick. Seasoned. Added the veggies. Loved the thyme in it. Cool before transferring mixture to pie shell. No egg wash. Thanks :)

I made a few changes based on other reviews. I used 1/2 cup each of frozen green beans, peas and corn along with fresh diced carrots and potatoes. Instead of cream of potato soup and used cream of celery. My spices were 1/4 tsp of thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper. I pre-baked my bottom crust and put all in a deep dish. My husband loved it and I will definitely make again.

My 11 year-old made this.  She used 1 can of carrots and 1 can of peas to the  cream of potatoe soup. We adjusted the cooking temp to 425f and also pre baked the bottom of the dough. This came out

Crazy-simple, and pretty tasty too! I used thawed frozen veggies instead of canned.

I have made this pie twice. I made a few modifications on the second one. I used frozen mixed veggies, cooked for 5 minutes in the microwave, drained, and cooled. I sauteed some onion in butter to add. I cut  the black pepper in half, as I found 1/2 is way too much. I added only a dash of thyme and a little Jane's Crazy Salt to taste. I  did not pre-bake 
 the bottom crust or use the egg on the top one. I had to bake the pie 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for because it was not browning. I turned the oven to 400 degrees for the last 20 minutes.  It turned out delicious. Hearty and filling.

I add dried celery flakes, and used cream of mushroom soup because I did not have cream of potato soup.  I also put some onion in it and added shredded cheddar cheese.  I did not put a crust on top for lack of having one.  I also used frozen vegetables and thawed them because I did not have the canned.  My husband loved it and so did I.  it was even good the next day.

Was soooooo easy to make. This will be a staple on weeknights! I will have to experiment with making the filling a little thicker. But other than that it is glorious! Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe tonight because I just needed a change.First let me say I rated this a 4 not because it wasn't good but because of the variations I made to the original recipe. The changes I made were based upon other reviewers. I used  frozen vegetables of broccolli, carrots, sugar snap peas and water chestnuts. I also added sweet corn and pearl onions. I let the frozen vegetables thaw and drain in a collander. I also diced a few red skin potatoes to add to the veggies. As per the original recipe I used a can of creamed potatoe soup and per another viewer added a can of creamed corn.  The mixture looked a little dry to me when all ingredients were added so I did add a small amount of half & half.  I pre-baked the bottom pastry as many had suggested. I added more thyme than called for and in retrospect would cut back on the thyme. (My own personal recipe I've used tarragon as a twist). At any rate it turned out a great dinner recipe. Next time I don't think I would par-bake the bottom pastry layer. Husband was happy. All he needed was to add hot sauce but he does that with anything I cook.

It didn't come out as expected it ended up really runny and not thick, what could I do? I make it exactly as is with fresh vegetables. I'm a vegan.

I usually make the recipes as written but had read allot of the reviews and followed some suggestions. I did bake the bottom crust about 10 minutes before adding the veggie mix. I omitted the thyme and added sautéed garlic, minced onions and mrs dash. There were no leftovers! Even my picky no vegetable eating child ate this pie!

TRY THIS, IT IS RIDICOUSLY EASY. How much effortless could this recipe be????? It turns out great!!!  I used a store bought pie crust.  I did bake the pie crust for 5mins before putting in the filling as other viewers suggested. I followed the recipe, but did not use the thyme, we don't like it. I sprinkled some garlic powder in the mixture. Baked at the time recommended. It came out perfect. Next time, I think I will cut back on the pepper it was a little  to much for us but it may be good for you.

Great recipe thank you.

This was my first ever pie. I am 45 and suddenly took a notion to start baking lol.
Anyway, I substituted quite a few things as baking what needed to get used up: coconut milk for milk, potatoes and carrots for the potato soup, added some veg stock/bullion, Dill instead of Thyme and some chopped spinach.
However, the method was 100% the same (and easy, appreciated by me) and more importantly gave me the inspiration to jump right in.
Delicious. Thanks.
PS. I also baked the crust first esp. because I had hand made it and it came from the fridge ice cold and also because my pie mix was a little runnier than the video.

I was sort of doing my own thing and then came here to see what people did for oven time.  
I added salt, pepper, parsley and garlic powder to the crust. 
Sautéed some Vidalia onion, celery and 3 cloves of garlic. Added the drained mixed veggies and condensed soup and heated everything up. Skipped the milk. 
Baked 450 for 15 minutes, and turned it down to 350 for about 40 more.  Beautiful.

Tastes amazing, but the innards turned out much too soupy for my liking. I'm going to try adding a little less milk next time, and thickening it with some corn starch before filling the pie.

Just made this and it turned out great. I used a deep dish so doubled the recipe and it worked great. Pre-baked the crust for about 11 minute and then added the filling and top crust. Also added broccoli florets with the mixed vegetables for a better veggie. Will definitely make this again.

Yum! So easy, so delicious. I've made this twice, omitting the egg wash both times and adding in boiled chicken once. Wonderful both times. Can't stress enough what an easy homerun this is.

I have made this many times and everybody likes it.  I use thawed and drained frozen vegetables to reduce sodium content.  The spice can be played with--no spicy foods for several family members, but the thyme in the recipe can be complemented by some rosemary (preferably ground), a little parsley...
I add garlic, too.
I struggle with trying to make this recipe a little healthier but it's so tasty as is that I don't want to mess too much.

I pre baked the pie shell for 7 minutes, sauteed crimini mushrooms and blot them dry and added it to the mixture.  I then added a little garlic powder along with minced onion (optional for the onions).  My family LOVES this so much, that it's become our fall/winter favorite comfort food dish!.

I'm giving it 4 stars on how easy it is to make; I'm sure I will make this again, but with some modifications.  The amount of pepper needs to be cut in half, and possibly the thyme as well.

I made this a couple of nights ago and my non-vegetarian husband really liked it.  I loved it.  It was perfect - not too runny or too thick.  I had it for lunch today and the crust was still hard (as opposed to soggy).

I made this pie exactly as written but the thyme overpowered everything else and the filling was too runny. The pastry was the only good thing about this pie but that's to pilsbury's credit.  Sorry I can't give a better review but I've made several other vegetable pot pies that were way better albeit more work. Will not repeat this one.

super easy, super good. the recipe is a good base to use and then add seasonings to your taste. I used seasoning salt, a little chili powder, and skipped the thyme. also, i only had cream of mushroom soup so I used that and cut up a potato or two into small chunks to throw in with everything else.

This recipe was fabulous! I used Campbell's cream of wild mushroom instead of the potato because its all I had. I love it! Big hit with the family :) I also added a dash of Cayenne pepper and seasoning salt for added flavour. Finally, I cut up fresh green onion and tossed small pieces of that into the mix. Will be doing this again soon :)

It came out great! I baked the bottom crust first, then fter adding the filling I put on the top crust and baked it. After 300 minutes my pie was ready. I should have made 2!

If I hadn't accidentally spilled so much pepper into it, it would have been better than the chicken pot pie.

When it says easy, it really means easy! It tasted great. I'm giving it five stars because for the amount of effort it took, it was definitely a five-star taste. Of course if you're looking for a more gourmet recipe, this isn't really the way to go. But still delicious!

This pot pie is not only delicious but incredibly easy to make! I doubled the recipe since my pie dish is quite big and instead of using canned veggies, I used frozen ones (carrots, corn, peas) and leeks. It was a *hit*!

This was surprisingly good and pretty easy.  I used frozen mixed veggies for less sodium (carrots, green beans, and peas) and one diced potato.  Skipped the beaten egg on top.  I took the suggestion to cook the bottom crust a little bit first. This made really good leftovers too.

This is fall favorite in my house. When my daughter was younger, this was often her Sunday afternoon "linner" request.  Now I use it to lure her home from college.  

I serve it with some warm crusty bread from the oven to make it the perfect comfort food meal.

So good and easy! Used refrigerated pie crusts and baked the bottom one first, used canned peas and corn, fresh herb mix of rosemary/sage/thyme, went easy on the milk to keep mixture thick, added caramelized onions, fresh garlic, cayenne pepper and cheddar cheese. Did brush the egg on top, it was beautiful.

Preferred using fresh vegetables instead of canned. Steamed the veggies to soften them. Subbed parsley and dill for the thyme, and added a few seasonings. Made two 9” veggie pot pies w/o top crusts. A little more prep time in chopping the fresh vegetables, but well worth it. A simple, basic recipe that delivers a tasty meal.

Love this! It's so easy and delicious! I took the advice of the other reviewers and baked the bottom crust for a bit first. I didn't use any thyme because I didn't have any and excluded the egg. Last time I used a combination of frozen and fresh veggies, this time just frozen veggies for convenience. The husband loves it too!

I have a turkey pot pie recipe that I love, but it takes a little more effort than this recipe.  So decided to try this and, I have to say, it's almost as good!  I used Pillsbury pie crusts and had no problem with the bottom crust - can't figure out how you could prebake the bottom and still crimp the edges together anyway.  I used a bag of frozen stew vegetables (carrots, potatoes, celery and pearl onions) and cut them up smaller after they thawed.  I also sauteed some zucchini, minced garlic and mushrooms for added flavor, then added the frozen veggies, some cream of mushroom soup, the milk, thyme and black pepper and heated it all through.  As an afterthought I added some chopped fresh spinach and let it wilt.  I used a deep dish pie pan, so having more veggies was a good thing.  I think my husband went back for a third helping on this one, so I would say it was a success in my house!

I added poultry seasoning instead of the thyme and it turned out great! I had to bake for a little longer but I used a smaller convection oven so that's probably why. Great simple recipe, thanks!!

I've made this many times and it's a family favorite. We like to add chicken and use cream of chicken instead, and it turns out very good. We also cook the bottom crust for a few minutes beforehand to keep it from getting soggy. I try to add a little less milk than it calls for though, because this sometimes turns out runny.

Stumbled upon this recipe this morning and decided I had to make some! I ran out and got the cream of potato soup and pie crusts (I had everything else at home). I didn't make any major changes to the recipe! I did a little less than a tsp of salt and rosemary like some suggested. I didn't do the egg, and I browned the bottom crust for a little bit while I made the filling and then pulled it out, spooned the filling in, put the top crust on, and put it straight back in the oven. If you don't wan a little spice, don't add so much pepper, but I LOVED it. Certainly a keeper!

Extremely quick and easy, if you don't make your own crust like I did. Baked the bottom first as others have suggested. I substituted basil for thyme 'cuz I didn't have any thyme. I used frozen veggies instead of canned and made two pies, one with cream of broccoli and one with cream of potato. Both were good but I liked the broccoli one better.

Like another reviewer suggested I added lintels for extra protein and I used an organic cream soup which might have changed the flavor a little. We thought it was very good and I will certainly be making this again.

Made this on a whim one evening for my boyfriend and he love it!  It was the first pot pie I have ever made and I think it turned out great.  The only issue I had was getting it to thicken up.  This is due to my lack of cooking skills rather than the recipe.  If anyone has suggestions I will take them!  All in all it was super tasty and I will make it again in the future.

Tried recipes-Great and Easy.  I do agree cooking shell first.  I used frozen veggies.  This time I am going to try cream of broccoli,  more veggies and some chicken bullion.

Great recipe! I only added 1/4 tsp of thyme because I'm not a big fan of that particular herb. But it was a great, easy and pretty cheap meal. Thanks!

Quick & Yummy, this is so easy to make, I took the advice of others and baked the bottom crust a little first, but otherwise followed the recipe except I didn't put the egg on the crust.  Next time, I will use frozen vegetables instead, the canned veggies are so mushy and tasteless.  I would also use a full cup of milk and instead of 1/2.

I added a diced chicken breast and used frozen veggies (broccoli, corn and carrots) instead of canned.  It seemed like there wasn't enough gravy when it was finally done, which I would typically expect from a pot pie.  However, I'm not putting that to the fault of the original recipe- the chicken absorbed some liquid too.  Next time I'll add either more milk or some additional chicken broth to increase the gravy.  Five stars for how easy it was to make, and on so few ingredients.  I'll definitely be making it again!

This was SUPER easy and VERY INEXPENSIVE!!!  However, I will tweak it next time by omitting the thyme, but only as a personal preference as it was very overwhelming to me.  I also LOVE lots of veggies and added 2 large potatoes (boiled to about 1/2 way done), used 1/2 bag frozen broccoli cuts (cooked first), 1/2 bag frozen peas (cooked first) and forgot how I HATE the taste of canned carrots, so next time I will use fresh carrots that I steam myself.  Because I used lots of veggies, mine was quite dry.  So next time I will try 1 1/2-2 cans of soup and 3/4-1 cup milk.  I did bake the bottom crust first for about 5 mins. as suggested by others and I did not use egg on the top crust and my crust came out beautifully after exactly 40 minutes.  Without the time and with a little more liquidity to it, I think it will be great next time!!  Best of all, I love the obvious ease with which this recipe can be adjusted to taste!

I would give this 4-1/2 stars if I could.  I think it benefits from using more than just thyme.  I've made it a few times and found the rosemary, thyme and sage combination to be delicious.  I frequently add either canned chicken breast or diced rotisserie chicken when we're looking for something not vegetarian.

One of my most-favorite vegetarian recipes.  My fiance loves it, too, & he's a meat & potatoes kinda guy.  This is one of a very few vegetarian dishes that he will eat with no complaints.  It's so good!

Great recipe.  My biggest suggestion is to put the pie pan on a baking sheet...mine bubbled over.  Also we all thought there was too much pepper. I did prebake the bottom crust for just a few minutes, not sure it made a difference.  I used the egg on top and it gave a nice brown to it. I served stuffing along side it.  Hubby and I liked it, but the 4 year old was not into it.

this is a good base recipe. In the future, however, I will probably use fresh veggies because, while this recipe as-is is definitely convenient, it has a bit of a "canned" taste to it. Also, it was a bit heavy on the thyme for my taste. Will make again with just a few modifications.

I had my doubts about this pie (was dubious about using canned veg but i doubt i could have told the difference once baked), but I will be making my pot pies this way from now on. It was delicious, every crumb was devoured. The only thing i would like to point out is don't allow the pie shells to defrost COMPLETELY otherwise they will stick in their aluminium cases. I had to use a fresh set and defrost for 15 mins only. Theres no way i could have used the completely defrosted ones; they were completely soft and stuck

This was very good. Only changes I made were to use frozen vegetables (about 2/3 bag) and soymilk instead of regular milk. I also didn't use the egg on top.  I thought the cream of potato soup made it very heavy. I think next time I'll try cream of mushroom instead.

This was super easy and perfect for a weekday after work dinner. The whole family loved it. I need to search for a more organic cream of potato soup to make it perfect for our family's taste but that is just our preference. Thank you for the great recipe.

Quick Easy and YUMMY! I like to use (thawed)frozen veggies and add a little extra seasoning (pepper, garlic etc). This is a great dinner for those rainy days when you want comfort food but don't want to cook!

Well! I made this for dinner tonight to compliment plain 'ol chicken breasts, and everyone devoured it.  I have a feeling I will make this simply made masterpiece over and over. I think next time I will make it (when no one is home), and see how it reheats the next day.  Thanks so much, KDCG.

I'm voting for 2 people! It was great and best of all cheap & still  flavourful. Finding vegetarian main dishes can be a challange. I will make this for years to come. I did add approx. 1/2 tsp garlic. Wonderful!

Delicious and easy! I make this quite often. I cook the bottom crust for a little bit before filling the pie so that it cooks completely.

I've made this before and it was great.  I would say to half the pepper and half the thyme and add sage in replace of the removed thyme.   As a quite comfort meal, try making this on the stove top and serve with biscuits.  My variation is as follows:  I double the recipe for leftovers.  1 can each of cream of mushroom and cream of potato.  Half the pepper, Half the thyme and replace the other half with sage.  Salt and/or seasoning salt to taste.  I warmed this on the stove and allowed the flavors to mix together.  Approx 20-30 minutes on low (after getting it hot/boiling).  Stir often.   Another variation, try this recipe in a casserole dish and add canned biscuits (uncooked) to the top of the mixture about halfway through cooktime.

I LOVED this recipe!  It was so, super easy and surprisingly yummy!  I added a little salt and didn't used the egg, and maybe I'll used some seasoned salt next time, just for more flavor, but otherwise, no changes are needed!  I try not to eat meat and it's impossible for me to find frozen pot pies without meat, so from now on, this is my recipe!

Oh My! I followed this just as described, (precooking the bottom crust a bit) using Marie Callendar's pie crusts. I also added Morningstar Farms spicy wings (cut up) for protein. It's going on the table Thanksgiving! Thanks so much!

YAY!  This was great!  It was so easy!  I used frozen veggies, cooked in microwave first.  Great recipe!  I didn't use the thyme either, not a big fan!  Yummy!

This was quick and easy!  I added shredded chicken that was left over from dinner last night and also cooked the bottom crust 7 minutes first, as suggested by someone else.  Turned out great!  I will halve the thyme next time...kids thought it was too "spicy".

Very Simple and turned out beautifully.  I made two.  One following the recipe (exactly) and a second using a Mexican blend of veggies and chicken breasts (cooked&diced) and cream of chicken in place of the cream of potato.  And a few teaspoons of hot sauce...  Both were quite good.  :)  Thanks KDCG!

I make this regularly in the winter - I leave out the egg, use one pie crust on top and use frozen veggies instead of canned. Great comfort food!

Great recipe!  Very good and so easy to make!  I substituted a bag of frozen vegetables for the canned vegetables and didn't change anything else.  (Although I did accidentally add the egg to the mixture instead of using it to coat the crust, but the pie still came out great, just a little thicker than it should have been.) Overall, the pie was very tasty and I will definitely be making this again!!

Yum, I cooked the bottom crust about 6 minutes and it worked well. I used about 3 cups of fresh veggies and it came out delicious but I was surprised that I could easily fit at least another cup and will do that next time so it's not so bready and possibly double the soup and milk too.

SOOOO easy, wonderful, and delicious!  Leftovers the next day were terrific, too.  Will definetly make again but use only 1/4 tsp of pepper. Hubby couldn't get enough and he hates veggies.  He is asking for it again next week, and I'm happy to do it!!!

The vegetarian approves! Extremely easy to make and tastes great. I didn't use the egg on top, and next time I'll probably only use one pie crust as it was too bready for me (I like having more veggies in food than 'everything else'). But overall, I absolutely LOVE it.

Really easy and tasty, and I didn't even have a regular pie crust (flour tortillas can substitute).  Agree with the other reviewers that the pepper is a bit much.  I will cut back on it next time.

Soooo easy! One of our guests for Christmas dinner was a vegetarian, so I wanted to make a dish that was substantial, but also easy. With all of the other cooking I had to do, I didn't have a lot of time to make another complicated dish. I made it earlier in the week just to make sure it was acceptable to serve (I hate making my guests be guinea pigs!). I used 1 tsp of thyme, like the recipe called for, and I didn't think it was too much at all. If anything, I think this could you a little more seasoning. I'll have to play around with it more to jazz it up a little. I used cream of celery soup, which I thought went really well. To me, cream of potato or mushroom just didn't sound good. I will definitely hold on to this recipe because it was easy and called for ingredients that are often on hand.

This was a great dinner for a cold night. Instead of the potato soup I used cream of asparagus and it was delicious. The pie crusts I used came in the refrigerator section, not frozen. I also used fresh vegetables. Next time I plan to steam them slightly before cooking because they came out a little crunchy. I left it in the oven for about 55 minutes so that the crust would be all the way done. Delicious and an excellent vegetarian dinner!

YUM! As a vegetarian its really expensive to buy a vegetarian pot pie. Since this was one of my husband favorites before being a vegetarian, I had to make it. He loved it and declared it a winner. I love that it takes no time to throw together.

Incredibly easy and hearty recipe, highly recommend. Was a tad bit bland for me even after though I had added a lot more black pepper than called for. I might try it next time with cauliflower instead of mixed veggies just for a change. 

I skipped the egg part and also made sure to cover the edges of the pie crust with foil before putting it in the oven, to prevent burning. I also used frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned ones.

Thanks for a great recipe! It's a keeper.

delicious! this was a great and fast recipe! i used frozen veggies because i could not find mixed veg in a can, but this worked fine! just cook the frozen veggie according to the bag directions and then drain/rinse under cold water before adding to the soup and milk mix. I also think the egg on top is a nice touch! yum!

Amazing. =) Being the only vegetarian in my family, I often have to cook my own dinners and after making this pie I pretty much had leftovers for a week.

The only thing I would change is the amount of pepper is wayyyy too much, and you can skip the egg; it will still taste just as good.

This was so easy! It was very good, although I probably will add less pepper next time, but that's just me because I'm not a big fan of pepper--I thought it was a little overpowering.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion of cooking the bottom pie for about 3-5 minutes before cooking the actual pie and it turned out great.

This recipe is tasty and very easy to make. I used mushroom soup and fresh veggies (steamed for a few minutes before adding) and the combination turned out great. Next time I make this I will try adding some cooked chicken to individual sized pies for the meat-lovers at my house.

Sooo easy, fast, and delicious! Make sure to drain the veggies well. I also added canned spinach (make sure to drain well!). I didn't use the egg on top of the crust and everything was still fine. My boyfriend and I ate 1/2 the pie!

Oh my gosh, this was my first attempt at any sort of main dish pie, and it was delicious! I loved the fact that it was so simple and easy to make. I wanted more flavor so I substituted cream of mushroom instead of potatoe. Next time I think I'll add a little less pepper, not being a big fan of it. Otherwise, simply delectable!

I love this recipe!  And, even better, my husband loves this recipe!  For me, a vegetarian, I use cream of mushroom soup and to make it a little lighter, I use only the top crust.  For my husband, a meat-eater, I use the cream of chicken soup and I add the pre-cooked, pre-packaged chicken strips.  I use whatever frozen veggies we have and create something new each time.

The bottom was way too raw and it seemed to need more filling. Otherwise, the flavor it was great. It was so easy to make.

Really loved this recipe because it was so easy and tasted homemade.  I could cook this any night of the week.  Another cool thing with this recipe is that you don't have to use mixed veggies, just the ones you like!

This was almost embarassingly easy and even my meat-eating husband liked it!  I added some extra milk/soup with dried lentils to give it added protein.

If pie crust on the top and bottom is just too much pie crust for you, it also serves up attractively with bread crumbs sprinkled on top.

This was so simple.  It literally took me 5 minutes to pop into the oven.  I skipped the egg part and added some chicken.  Who knew chicken pot pie could be so easy.  So long Marie Calendars!

I doubled the potato soup, added some frozen broccoli and pearl onions at my hubby's request.  It was good and very easy, but I will definitely reduce the amount of thyme for our tastes next time.

We did a few more changes to this one and we think we finaly have it.  We added cream of chicken soup in place of the potatoe, 1/2 cup chicken broth in place of the milk and 1 tsp all purpost seasonings inplace of the spices listed.  We kept the 15 oz of mixed frozen vegetables and we addes chicken pieces as well. Very good.

IT was quick and easy.  Add whatever vegetable you want.  I would NOT serve this to guest but it is a quick tuesday night dinner.  However, if you are used to eating healthy, make your own wheat crust.  The crust tasted like candy to me and my family.  I plan to make a bunch of crust at one time and freeze them.  That way the dish keeps it best quality-simplicity.

This recipe is great. I used chicken in my husband's and he loved it. I did use cream of potato soup and cream of mushroom soup for added flavor. I also added extra potato chunks.

This recipe was awsome and very easy to play with and make.  I didn't have any milk so I used some of the juice left over from the can of vegetables and then I decided to make the pie lighter (since I was only serving it to 3) and use only a bottom crust.  Instead of the top I layered on some steamed brocolli stems cut lengthwise on top to form a veggie crust and also added some onions that I had steamed with the brocolli.  Next time I'll probably add lots of carrots and more brocolli but it was a big hit with everyone the way it was!!!
Thanks!

I altered this a bit. I steamed fresh veggies and I used a non-condensed cream of potato soup. I think I will try it a different way each time I make it. (ie: different soups, different veggie combos)
