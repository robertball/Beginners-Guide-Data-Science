This is pretty decent. I followed directions with the exception of yogurt. I used mashed banana instead. It's definitely filling and feels like clean eating. It needs another ingredient to add that "yes!" feeling. I will try this again with that special ingredient...whatever it is.

These are sooooooo good! My husband and toddlers think so too. Followed the recipe exactly. There is a really nice apple flavor to it. I will definitely be making these again!

I made the muffins with a few changes. I didn't buy oat flour, I just puts some of the oats in the blender and pur√©ed them to make oat flour. I didn't use plain yogurt, I used banana cream yogurt. Since I like banana in my oatmeal, I also smashed 1/2 a banana and added it. The missions were delicious!!  To mKe them a little firmer, I left them in the oven about 15 minutes after the timer, with the oven turned completely off. Great recipe and I will make it again.

The texture of these was a bit gooey, but the overall taste was great!  I added raisins to the recipe and substituted pecans for walnuts because that was what I had on hand.  Next time, I might try adding coconut, too.  My kids and husband liked them warm from the oven.  Hopefully, they will still like them tomorrow for breakfast!

These were great!  Like some others, I used mashed banana instead of the yogurt.  I also just used regular flour instead of oat flour, and added coconut as well.  The muffins are very moist and hearty, and have a good amount of sweetness while still tasting healthy.  Will definitely be making these again!!

I made this exactly as written except I did not include the nuts. I think it had a good taste, but it was a little too gooey for the paper muffin cups. If I make it again, I will either use foil cups, or maybe just put it all in one dish.

Very good and lots of texture. I doubled the recipe, using 3 smashed bananas instead of yogurt and added more cinnamon. I also added about 1/2 cup shredded coconut. Very yummy! Thank you!

Delicious muffins!  I didn't have the oat flour so I used wheat/white flour and they turned out great!

I used rolled oats, whole wheat flour and unsweetened applesauce in place of butter..just based on what I had on hand. They turned out super good. The toddlers love them. Will be a keeper.

I love these, and love the versatility of them! The fact that they're gluten free is great for my little guy (and a bit easier on my waist too!) ;)

Excellent.  I also used bananas instead of yogurt but that was about the only change.  Warm with a little butter or jam - they were so good.

Very tasty. I substituted 2 mashed bananas for the yogurt. Yield was 15 regular sized muffins. You probably get 12 with larger tins.

I made the recipe in the wee hours of the morning and did not see that it called for Oat flour! I used all purpose flour and I also did not have any yogurt so I used sour cream as a substitute.  It still came out delicious! Keeping this one in the books.

Yummy! Made almost as is (no allspice but replaced with cardamom and ginger, and used regular flour), made 24 mini muffins cooked for 20 min. My toddler loved making and eating these!

Great flavor and very flexible recipe! I cut in half and used regular all purpose flour instead of oat. I also subbed raisins for nuts and used 1.5 apples instead of 1. I've been eating them for breakfast and love them :) Great with a hot cup of tea!

i didn't have cinnamon for this recipe so i used nutmeg, and they turned out really good! I also made a batch with orange mixed in  and they turned out pretty tasty as well, but you may not like if  you aren't a fan of orange spice. but this is a good base recipe! will be doing more experiments with it in the future!!!

Delicious. Made with plain Greek style yogurt, it's what I had on hand, and they turned out perfect.

Great breakfast option. Filling and tasty. My daughter added a layer of yogurt and bananas to the top as 'icing' which really completed the breakfast. Will make again and add extra spices as that's the one thing I think needed a boost. We love apples and cinnamon though.

I have made this recipe a couple of times now and these muffins are delicious. I mostly followed the recipe. I followed other people's suggestions and used a smashed banana instead of yogurt. I also did not have vanilla. I put in some Carmel syrup for flavor and also put in sliced almonds. Turned out great. This is a very flexible recipe.

Reduced butter to 1/4c and added nuts and coconut.  Delicious and moist
