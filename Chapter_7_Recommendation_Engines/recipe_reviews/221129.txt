Thank you Chef John - this is great marinade and made for a delicious fast and easy dinner.  I would marinate the meat longer than the 15 minutes called for and as for cooking to 140 - I don't agree - this meat should be pink in the center and only takes a couple of minutes per side on a hot grill.  Slice against the grain into thin strips and you can't go wrong.  Delicious!  Enjoy!

Wow!  Very rarely do I think something is worthy of a 5 star rating, but this is simply the best skirt steak I have ever had!  Not sure marinated it for 15 minutes would actually do the trick.  Maybe it's true, but I didn't want tough meat. So to be sure, I marinated for about a day and a half, turning it over and over in the fridge to make sure all sides were nice and juicy!  I can't wait to get more skirt steak to do it again!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is AMAZING!!  I didn't have skirt steak, so I used london broil sliced about 1" think and marinated it about 8 hours.  While the steak was grilling, I heated up the marinade and put it over hot rice.  This is a definite "keeper" and also quite an inexpensive meal.  My family likes things on the "zippy" side, so I use 2 tablespoons of the chile paste instead of one.

I followed the recipe exactly but I marinated the skirt steak over night and then grilled it outside.  DELICIOUS.  My 11 year old loved it.  When he tasted the steak he said "mmm....the steak is bomb".  Excellent recipe.  Thanks Chef John!

I prepared this recipe as written, fish sauce and all. I found it to be easy and delicious and will definitely be adding this to the list of keepers. As with most other Chef John recipes, there is not only a lot of flavor here, but it is also well-balanced. I also tried this marinade on pork tenderloin and flank steak and both were fantastic. I allowed those to marinate for 8-10 hours, though, because they were not as thin as skirt steak and I was looking for a serious hit of flavor.

This marinade really is fantastic.  I've used it for skirt steak, as shown, but also for salmon - delicious!  I agree with the previous reviewer who commented that skirt steak really only needs 2-3 minutes each side.

It has some great potential, I think a better cut of meat maybe worthy of a 5 star, I had the butcher cut two of the leanest flank steaks he could but they still weren't that good to me, going to try it with a London Broil cut in half to see if it makes a difference, I do not like any fat that I can taste in my steak....I did add about a teaspoon of ginger to it as well....

I made this today with high hopes that stemmed from the five star reviews. I followed the recipe to the "T" except the marinade time. I will never use skirt steak again. If I had marinated it for only 15 minutes it would have been even worse. On the other hand the Orange glazed carrots were very delicious.

Marinade was excellent, however, the skirt steak was still chewy after marinating for 12 hrs! Going to use it on salmon or chicken I think.

an addendum to previous thoughts.  Went to a recipe for bbq skirt steak and in recipe notes, it said to score both sides crosswise to facilitate marination.  Perhaps there's a difference between the definition of the east coast vs. west coast versions of skirt steak. again, marinade flavor spot on, but not so fab on shoe leather.

This was excellent.  I didn't have fish sauce so I substituted oyster sauce in its place.  I also let it marinate for about 4 hours.  Everything I ever made using Chef John's recipe  was wonderful.

I made no changes. Was concerned it might be too exotic for my grandkids...but everyone loved it. Both my adult sons (who cook) asked for the recipe as they plan on making if for their friends. Having lived in the Far East many years ago, I have the ingredients on hand so it's easy for me to whip it up. Main problem seems to be finding skirt steak.

The sauce was wonderful and I would make this again.  I took off a star for the skirt steak.  Next time, and there will be a next time for the marinade, I'd use a flank steak.  My hubby and I weren't that keen on the skirt steak.

I measured exactly and made one substitution: fish sauce instead of fish paste because it's what I had on hand. It was very bland, and I even marinated it for 30 minutes.

Had to ask the butcher for this. It is not something they place out at our grocery store. He gave us a bottom sirloin flap steak as it would be easier to cook since it is larger in his opinion. It was very good. Everyone had seconds.
