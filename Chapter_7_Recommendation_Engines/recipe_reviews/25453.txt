This was very popular with my guests and *easy*.  I had no sherry, so I substituted 2T of seasoned rice vinegar, and I used powdered ginger instead of fresh.

Very tasty, I substituted some yoshibas gormet sauce for the soy sauce for a slightly sweet taste, thumbs up!

Very good marinade! This also works well on shark steaks. I had to substitute as I wasn't able to find swordfish that was wild-caught. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

It was absolutely delicious! My husband couldn't stop raving about it! I adjusted the recipe slightly, based on what we had available and our taste preferences. I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil, white vinegar for the sherry, added some garlic powder, and increased the portions of soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. I let the steaks marinade in the refrigerator in a covered glass dish for a little over four hours, turning three times. We only made three swordfish steaks since that is the current size of our family (with one on the way) and grilled as stated in the directions. I reserved the marinade and put it in a small skillet while my husband grilled the fish. After letting the marinade settle, I removed some of the olive oil with a spoon and replaced it with spicy sesame oil. I cooked the marinade for a few minutes before pouring it in a glass measuring cup. When the steaks were done, I whisked the remaining marinade into a creamy texture and poured on our fish. We could have taken the fish off of the grill a few minutes earlier (it absolutely did not need the full 8 minutes per side on a gas grill) but the addition of the spicy sauce on top saved it completely! I will definitely be making this again. Super easy and absolutely delicious.

Well, it's snowing outside so I don't think I am going to use my grill.
I like to splash it with lemon juice and sprinkle it with garlic and onion powder, season with salt and pepper to your taste. Yummy.

This was so flavorful and delicious.  I used a little less oil, about 6 tablespoons, and two of those I used sesame oil.  I also used a n extra splash of sherry.  Prop to hubs, he grilled these perfectly!  Thanks for sharing your marinade, a definite do-over!

This is delicious. I used this recipe to marinade swordfish steaks for about an hour to hour and half and it was delicious. I followed exactly except used ground ginger (fresh called for 1tsp, I used 1/2 tsp of ground ginger) amd added some green onions.

This was my 13 yr. old daughter's first time eating swordfish, and I'm so glad we decided on this recipe!  We didn't have time to let it marinate that long, but it still turned out delicious.  The flavor of the sherry was a little strong, so I will reduce this next time.  Regardless, I liked the marinade so much that I put some aside and saut√©ed sliced mushrooms with it.  I'm sure this would be great with tuna steaks too...

We served this with a side of asparagus wrapped in proscuitto (drizzled with a little olive oil and basalmic vinegar).  Wonderful!

We made this for our Valentine's dinner. Excellent! I'd like to try this marinade on chicken. Maybe add a little honey

Wow! I am always looking for a great simple marinade for fish. This is it! I made the recipe just as it is written. Now that I have made it a few times, I would recommend letting it marinade over night. This is also good with tuna steaks.

So tasty and so easy!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My family gobbled it up.  Fish was moist and flavorful.  Our grill is broken so I broiled instead and it turned out beautifully.  Thanks for a great recipe.
