This was a pleasant experience all the way around. The taste was fresh and delightful and the recipe so easy to do my daughter has re-created it several times to impress her friends. Try it with a lemon/herb rice and sesame green beans. Letting the chicken "steam" in the pan gives it a nice texture.

This is one of my favorite recipes. We had a profusion of mint growing in our herb garden that needed to be eaten and this chicken recipe hit the spot! I kept the chicken breasts whole and used butter instead of margarine. Fabulous recipe. Thank you mom for me!

A simple, delicious meal. I added salt and pepper to the garlic and flour mix and let it lie for about ten minutes. The mint and lemon complemented each other perfectly. I would cut the margarine in half next time. Added a bit of chilli powder at the end. Thanks for sharing!

This chicken was really good.  Although next time, I will cut the lemon by about half or so, and add at least two or three more, or more, cloves of fresh garlic.  My husband and I really love garlic.  Will make again however, the flavors are best in the summertime.

This was so delicious! I did adjusting though and used olive oil instead of margarine, added 3 cloves garlic  and I had to season it w/ salt and pepper or else it was too bland. I definitely used less than 1/4c lemon juice, too. I think that would have been way too much. I served it w/ some fried rice that I made w/ more mint, onions and garlic. Yum!

This recipe was GREAT! The texture and consistency of the finished pieces were almost like chicken nuggets--except they were minty tasting! We really enjoyed these and I can see having them again and again.

I read other reviews before making this. I used 1/8 cup of lemon juice which was more than enough. I thought that it could of used a bit more mint, but overall the family really enjoyed this.

This was a nice easy recipe.  I used less garlic, but only because I generally despise garlic.  Made this for my girlfriend one night and she has cravings for it all the time.  Especially nice for a nice day outside with a mojito

This mint dish is marvelous!  I changed the margarine - I used butter, used 3 cloves garlic and a tad more lemon juice.  Also used a rice recipe from here, just browned rice with sweet onions before dumping in the rice cooker.  Delish and I would serve this to guests.  Our veggie was broccoli with a squeeze of lemon.

This turned out pretty well, I used Crisco (butter flavor) instead of margerine and that was probably not a good idea. The chicken turned out really greasy. I also used 1 tsp garlic powder in the flour instead of real garlic. and it wasn't enough. (we love garlic) So next time, I'll use margerine and extra garlic.

mmmmm......delish! It was super easy and yummy. I made it with cous cous which I flavored with a combination of parsley, mint, shallots, olive oil, honey, & red wine vinager. I also steamed carrots with brown sugar and it was so good.

I have not tried the meal yet, but it does look tempting. I would probably use 10-15mills of lemon juice and then add 1 - 2 tbls of cumin and throw some ginger in there... finish it off with a sprinking of coriander and rosemary for an interesting flavour.

Great basic recipe! Next time I'll cut the butter in half. Added some cayenne & a tad of red pepper flakes and used 3 large cloves of garlic. Will definitely make this again.

So good and different than the usual.  I am blessed with a large patch of mint so it was fun to have a main dish that used a good bit of mint.  The mint was not overpowering though I think I may have over done the lemon juice.  Still, everyone from age 7 to 43 snarfed this down!  We served it with brown rice and stirfried baby bok choy and snap peas.  It was a beautiful presentation.

This chicken was great! The name sounds a little scary, but it was an awesome, fresh taste. I'd reduce the butter a little bit though. Tip: before you squeeze your lemon, put it in hot water for a few minutes, then roll between your hands. You'll get the most juice this way.

DH and I both loved it - the only changes I made were garlic powder instead of fresh and the addition of seasoned salt.  Kids hardly touched it, but they were more interested in getting back to the new wading pool!  Unusual, simple and delicious!

I gave this a 4 not because it's very easy and fast to make!  The taste didn't "blow me away", but I do like it because it's different and fresh - light.

Needs salt And pepper.  Great flavor otherwise!

I used chicken thighs, bone and skin, so it needed to cook a lot longer.  The skin made it extra juicy, so well worth it.

Awesome flavor...I was running low on flour so I used half flour and half bread crumbs ( the kind in a can).   I also added two tablespoons of white balsamic vinegar and served with lentils....Delicious.  I think the sauce is what makes it, so next time I plan to use more lemon and margarine.  Serve with a nice sauvgnon blanc to balance it out!   Very light and refreshing!

I made 2 goofs, but it turned out great and my husband asked me to keep the recipe.  I cut chicken into tenders (just easier and quicker for me) forgot the garlic (darn)and for some reason thought the recipe called for 3/4 cup of lemon juice instead of 1/4 cup.  Since I like lemon, I went ahead and used it.  It was great!!  I just emailed the recipe to my son so I'll see how his turns out tomorrow.  Thank You, I love simple yet delicious recipes!!

I thought I'd make this chicken dish so as to use up some of the fresh mint leaves from the garden.  I tripled the amount of garlic and decreased the butter by half.  My hungry husband said it turned out well!

This is a nice, simple recipe. I just made it for dinner and we liked it, but I would make a few changes next time. I would use less lemon juice and lots more mint. I would also use more garlic. It was a nice, summery dish and it really filled me up. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks!

This was very good, but a little lemony since I didn't have fresh lemon juice.  Additionally, I tripled the garlic because we like it a lot.  Finally, I chopped the mint a lot smaller than shown in the picture.

Thanks for this recipe. I eat a lot of chicken dishes & am always looking for a new taste. This was one of the best recipes I've found in a long time. I loved the combination of the fresh lemon and mint!!  The only thing I changed was that I used unsalted butter instead of the margarine. This along with a small salad & some fresh baked crusty rolls is an excellant meal!

I really enjoy quick and easy chicken recipes that I can whip together after work, and this one hit the spot. Being able to use my container-grown mint for the first time was a bonus! It was very lemony (which I love) but if you are not into lemon - you probably won't like this. I will definitely make this again - especially because it consists of ingredients I often have in the house.

I used this because i needed to use up some fresh mint. It had a nice bright flavor but unfortunately the kids didn't like it. One doesn't like lemon and the other doesn't like garlic so not unexpected

Loved it! I added just a bit of salt and slightly decreased the lemon. Will certainly make again.

Way, way too lemony. I'm going to try it again with 1/2 the lemon and see how it is.

My husband (3 stars) liked it better than I (2 stars) did, but we weren't eager to make it again soon. The after taste is not so good.

4 stars for simplicity. I'm sure there are a few more simple things that could be done to make the flavor more complex though (saute the garlic first maybe?). Probably could make due with some black pepper if that is to your tastes as well, or something to spice it up a bit.

I liked this when I mixed the chicken in with some rice, but husband did not because lemon was very strong. Next time, will use about 1/2 the lemon juice and make up the difference with water or chicken broth.

Hmmm.... nice flavor, but I'm pretty sure I messed up the cooking.  I don't have a wide skillet, so I used a pot instead.  I don't thinkk it was wide enough and the chicken was crowded.  It didn't end up browning very well and the end result is chicken with a good flavor and a weird doughy paste that used to be flour...  i think I'll hold off on making this again until I can find myself a proper skillet!

While this chicken dish was light and refreshing, I found it lacking a bit in flavor. I added a seasoned salt while browning the chicken pieces and it gave it a bit more character. The dish was good and a hit with the whole family.

this dish was as tasty as was told in its review, though I added lemon zest for a stronger lemon flavor
